Charles L. Patton is to be the local Re
publican standard-bearer. â  ; â¢
With a storm of applause that spoke
volumes for the popularity of the man
whose name waa on every lip the Repub
lican Municipal Convention last night
nominated Char.es L. Patton for Mayor.
The circumstances attending t.he nom
ination were of a most' inspiring nature,
and may be taken as an indication of the
ng that will be accorded the candi
date at the polls next November.
After the nomination had been made
Mr. Patton appeared In person, and thank
ed the delegates â¢ for the honor that had
been conferred upon him an., at the same.
na prf ceUent to
his acceptance of the nomination. He de
jnanded a platform that would pledge thÂ«
and Its candidates to the -.correc
tion of existing abuses in the administra
te "ii of the affairs of local government,
end he plc-dged his own unswerving al
legiance to all principles of right and
Justice. . . .
Candidates for other offices were se
lected by the convention, and without ex
ception the men named are citizens who
have the confidence of the community
and the respect of the whole people. At
torney General William F. Fitzgerald
â was named as . the party candidate for
City and County Attorney. The other
nominations were: Asa R. "Wells for Aud
itor, John D. Siebe for Assessor, Isaac J.
Truman for Treasurer and Charles Til
to-n for City and County Surveyor. The
announcement of the name of each can
didate was greeted with applause and
cheers by the members of the convention
&s well as by the spectators who thronged
the galleries and the rear of the conven
tion hall.
As on Tuesday evening the proceedings
of the convention were marked by the
most perfect order and harmony, and
nothing occurred that did not tit per
fectly with the spirit of the occasion. The
nominating speeches wpre brief and to
the point, and the acknowledgments of
succesful candidates were appropriate
end timely.
Aa soon as the convention had been
ealed to order by Chairman Allen, J. C.
Daly announced that the committee on
permanent organization and order of
business was ready- to report. The re
port was handed to the secretary and
was read as follows: .

On motion of Judge Daly the report was
8 opted without amendment. The newly
elected officers wro then conducted to
the platform, and Mr. Allen, as.perma
nent chairman, announced that he had- no
epeech to niake..beeauM the time had ar
rived for the transaction of more import
ant business.
John M. Chretien, chairman of the com
mittee on platform and resolutions, an
nounced that his committee desired more
time In which to formulate its report.. On
motion of A. Ruof the committee was
granted until thli evening In which ..to
complete Us labors. Mr. Ruef also moved
thai the buatnesi of making nominations
tlons be proceeded with, all nominations
being subject to the indorsement of the
platform for the purpose of placing
It was so ordered and Chairman Allen
announced that nominations for Mayor
were in order. Meyer Jacobs took the
plattform for the purpose of placing
Charles L.. Patton in nomination. He
epoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: This is a representative body;
It is the representative of .the Republi
can party of San Francisco. It represents
Republican principles. I propose to nom
inate for the suffrage of the people to
head a representative ticket a representa
tive citizen. The gentleman I place In
nomination for the most important office
in the gift of the people of this munlcipal
The San Francisco Call
ity is the Hon. Charles L. Patton. (Cheers
and great enthusiasm.)
"I am willing:, gentlemen, to compare
this cenventlon-r-the Republican' conven
tion of San Francisco â and the Republi
can party of San Francisco to the Demo
cratic convention and ' the Democratic
party of Sin Francisco. In a great speech
at Metropolitan Temple a week ago Sat
urday night General Barries . compared
the Republican principles to those of the
fusion party. What is the Democracy of
this municipality but part and portion of
tne party known as the fusion party of
Sacramento? Can any good belong to a
party having affiliated in the unholy
union now existing between the Demo
cratic and Populist parties of the State?
It. is said that parties should nominate
good men. True, but we must look like
wise to principles. It Is as unsafe to nom
inate good men, pledged to support bad
principles, as it is to nominate, dishonest
men to abuse good principles. The gen
tleman whose name I have offered for
your consideration and whom, you will, I
believe, accept as leader of our party in
this municipality, la a man among men.
He is a man who represents Republican
principles. He is a . man loyal to the
principles of the Republican party. He is
loyal to the grand old party, the savior of
our country. He is loyal to our party,
which has preserved our institutions, the
institutions upon which our' Government
was founded; loyal to the man who has
guided the ship of state though the break
ers of strife and war. He is known
throughout the land for his' many noble
characteristics. He holds the respect of
this convention, of the business commu
nity, and is honored tor his executive abil
ity, his courage, his independence, his in
tegrity.
"Mr. Patton is a man who would not
seek office unless he could do so inde
pendently and know that none of hon
esty's principles would have to be sacri
ficed. Under no circumstances would be
attach himself to any element or faction
WhOM principles were inconsistent with
the principles of his party. He is \ Re
publican, has been a Republican and will
be a Republican. He will not affiliate

with party or faction un-Republican or
advocating doctrines inconsistent with its
time-honored principles. I now offer for
your consideration the name of the next
Mayor of Ban Francisco, if it is your will
that he should head our ticket, the Hon.
Charles L. Pat-tan."
At the close of Mr. Jacobs' address
three cheers were proposed for Patton.
Tht-y were given with a roar and for
several minutes the applause and cheer
ing was almost deafening. The nomina
tion of Mr. Patton was seconded by A.
P. Van Duzer. He said: . â 
"I desire to second the nomination of
the gentleman who will be .your next
Mayor. ' I regard it as an honor to sec
ond the nomination of such a man as
Charles L. Patton.
"During the past two years we have
seen the Mayor of this gr*at city of San
Francisco playing with the affairs of his
office like an actor on the stage â with the
sole intent of catching the applause of
the gallery. We have seen him using the
office to further his own personal ambi
tion; we have seen htm standing with
folded hands and closed mouth while he
watched the Botird' of Education, the
members of which are of his own selec
tion, steal sufficient lumber â  from the
municipality to build a.city of 1000 inhab
itants'. This Mayor of ours has watched
these officials steal almost everything ex
cept the schoolmarms, and it is not a cer
tainty that they did not steal some of
them.
"Charles L. Patton has shown himself
to be a born leader. If- elected to the of
fice he will perform his duty without fear
or favor. If nominated by this convention
you will have a chance to vote for a
clean man, a gentleman and not a- poli
tician. The present Mayor is now -en
gaged In the task of nominating a ticket

of his own. Charles L. Patton will eman
cipate the city from boss rule, and we will,
have for our Mayor one of nature's noble
men." (Applause.)
There being no further nominations the
chairman declared the nominations clos
ed, and on motion the secretary was in
structed to cast the vote of the conven
tion for Mr. Patton. On motion .of Harry
Gray a committee of threv. consisting of
Harry Gray, Meyer Jacobs and A. P.
Van Duzer was appointed to find Mr. Pat
ton, inform him of his nomination an-d
escort him to the convention hall.
When Mr. Patton appeared under escort
of the committee the delegates rose to
their feet and cheered their new-madÂ©
leader to the echo. He addressed the con
vention, as follows.
"Mr. Chairman and Kentlemen of the
convention: This is a proud moment for
me, as It would be a proud moment for
any citizen of this State to be nominated
for the highest office in the city and coun
ty of Sail Fia.nc.isco. x tliank you from
the bottom of my heart.
"I am sorry that your platform has not
yet been adopted, for untir it has been
formulated I cannot finally acept fhe
nomination which has been given me. The
Republican party of this city must stand
before the people committed to princi
ples that are necessary to good govern
ment. We must pledge our legislative
nominees to ratify the new charter, for
it is necessary that the wishes of the
people as expressed at the charter elec
tion shall receive legislative conflrma
tlon. The new charter. must not be set
aside. We must declare for a dollar
limit of taxation on ,an equitable valua
tion of the property of this city, and we
must declare for municipal 'ownership of
public utilities.. If these, things are in
the platform which you adopt I will'ac-'
cept the nomination which has been given
me here to-night; I will not .only accept
the nomination, but I will fight as hard
as I can to be elected Mayor' of this.'
'groat city. Gentlemen,- I thank you."
Mr. Patton was given three cheers, and
for several minutes the delegates on the
floor' indulged in a general uproar ex
pressive of their d-elight. .
In response to. the sentiments expressed
by Mr. Patton, A. Ruef' moved that the
committee on platform and resolutions Toe
instructed' to insert planks in the plat
form in accordance with the views c*-'
prossed by the candidates for Mayor. It
was so ordered.
Chairman A Hen announced that nomi
nations for City and County Attorney
were in order, and Judge J; C. Daly as
cended the platform for the purpose of
placing before the' convention the name
of Attorney General Fitzgerald.' He said:
. "Mr. Chairman and gentlemen -of the
conventionâ When I have performed the
pleasant duty of addressing you I pro- 1
pose to nominate fur the office of City
and < ourity Attorney of San Francisco
a gentleman who has never s-hirked duty,
a man who has never turned his back on
friond or foe. When I; heard our next
Mayor, Charles L. Patton,.take an hon
orable, independent stand I saw how fit a
companion he is for the man- I propose
to offer for nomination. It has always
been my. desire to select men whom I
know are fit and capable of performing
the duties they must . assume, keeping
well in view their integrity, their 'courage
and executive ability. These characteris
tics have made the leaders of our party
the admired of the people, of this. Gov
ernment. The man I will present is no
stranger in this community, and his rep
utation will carry hliri to victory and

The legislative, judicial, and educa
tional convention of the Republican? was
continued last .rtfpht ln the banquet hall,
XatSve Sons' building. The delegates lost
little time in getting to work.' Before
the close of the session they had nomi
nated the four Judges of the Superior
Court, fo<;r Judges of the -Police Court,
five Justices of the Peace and Superin
tendent of Schools. These, with the nomi
nation of-Senators, for three districts and
Assemblymen for the majority of the
districts, comprised the most Important
work of thie night. â¢ "â  .- â¢
. In addition a' list of names was sub
mitted for the offices of School Directors.
It- was decided that these- names would
be- passed upon by. a committee- of five
and then voted upon to-night by the dele-
gates to the convention.
The convention 'â¢will be called to order
at 7 o'clock, and it is expected that the
remaining .nominations will take but a.
short tlpae.
Owing- to the time consumed by the
delegates 'of the various districts in
electing? their ' chairman, the conven
tion â  was not called' to order
until 8:45 by Chairman E. I. Wolfe.
H. S. Mlllzner, chairman of the committee
.on permanent organization .and order of
business, read the report of that com
mittee recommending that: the temporary
officers be' made permanent; that J. W.
Burdette be elected vice-chairman, and
that three assistant secretaries be ap
pointed. The report was adopted with the
exception that it was agreed that the
customary fee of $10 was not to be ex
acted from candidates f.or the office of
School Directors. The delegates were not
of one mind on this proposition, some-fa
voring the charge on the ground that it
was exacted only as an evidence of good
faith. The. amendment finally prevailed,
and the report of the committee was
adopted.
Chairman" Faulkner of the committed on
platform reported that his associates were
not ready to render their report ' and
asked for " further time. He announced
that the committee would' meet at the
headquarters of .the County Committee
this afternoon, at 4 o'clock for the further
consideration of the platform.. Tho re
auÂ£st for additional time was granted.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Nominations for Superior Judges werÂ«
then declared in order. It was decided to
limit speeches to five minutes. Mr. Wolfe
called Mr; Burdette to the chair and pro
ceeded to place J. M. Troutt in nomina
tion. He said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: We have now arrived at the
most Important part of the work that will
devolve upon this convention. The people
of the city will scrutinize the men whom
you put forth as your candidates for the
Judges of the Superior Court. I desire to
name a man whom we all love and re
spect. He is James M. Troutt. He has
had a long and an honorable political life
and his elections heretofore on different
occasions have been decisive ones. On
the bench he has proved to be an honor
able man and his decisions have been just
ones, that have been rarely reversed. He
is an affable and genial gentleman, and is
assured of election if nominated."
Delegate Gunzendorfer seconded the
nomination. He was followed by George
Smith and S. Rosenheim, who spoke in
the same strain. Judge Troutt was nom
inated by acclamation, and then to make
it legal the secretary was instructed to
cast- the ballot.
Delegate Caldwell of the Thirty-ninth
District nominated Davis JLouderback. He
said:
"I do not desire to take up your time
by a Lengthy speech as the man 1 name
needs no encomium at my hands. He is
fitted by nature for the honorable position
of Judge.. He is manly and courageous
and has proved himself the possessor of
these qualities in times that have tried
men's souls. He ' has had wide
experience and brings to the posi
tion the reputation of his past work on
the bench. The people owe him a debt of
gratitude for his work on their behalf.
He is. honest and decent and is a man
who dares to do right at all times. I say
to you nominate Davis Louderback and
so sure as the sunbeams kiss the sky
to-morrow all over our beautiful land
just so sure will he be elected in Novem
ber."
The nomination was seconded by George
MeCorab.
I. Tausky of the Fortieth District nom
inated John D. Carson. He spoke as fol
lows:
"I wish to place before you for your
consideration the name of a gentleman
who has never held office, but who Is
well known here. He was born in Ire
land, coming here when young and resid
ing here nearly all his life. He was edu
cated here, finishing his legal studies at
Harvard Law College. He has a host
of friends in both the Democratid and
the Republican parties and will poll a
large vote."
Thomas Fitzgerald seconded the nomin
ation.
Edgar D. Peixotto nominated Henry
N. Clement. He said: "I nominate for
Judge of the Superior Court for the long
and the short term H. N. Clement. In
doing so It is not necessary for me to say
much in his behalf. He is a scholarly
man of marked legal attainments. Ho
helped frame the new charter for this
city, and his work is apparent through
out that instrument. In the election for
Freeholder he led almost all the other
candidates. If he is elected he will add
luster and pride to the party. He has
all the requirements needed of a man
holding a judicial position. I say that
to sit in judgment on your fellow-man
is as near the solemnity of the after
world as anything can be."
â¢ The nomination of Mr. Clement was sec
onded by A. J. Morgenstern. He dwelt
upon Mr. Clement's work for the new
charter.
The . secretary was upon motion in
structed to cast the vote of the conven
tion for Mr. Louderback, Mr. Carson and
Mr. Clement. Judge Troutt was previ
ously nominated by acclamation. Mr.
Clement 'â  was also nominated for the un
expired term.
Chairman Wolfe then announced that
nominations for the four Judges of the
Police Court were In order. Delegate
Tausky was recognized and nominated H.
L; Joachimsen, He said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: I wish
to place before you a candidate for a
judicial office. In a great city like this
the office of Police Judge is one of great
importance. He is called upon to pass
upon the preliminary hearings of many
important cases. The Judge is given
groat power and the men holding such
positions must not only be firm and all
that goes with.it, but must be capable
men. I wish to nominate H. L. Joachim
sen; .the Nestor of the judiciary of the
lower courts. He has occupied the posi
tion for ten years, with Increasing popu
larity. The people have confidence In
him and will return him to the office hÂ«
hate filled with so in-uch credit."
W. Guilfoyle nominated A. B. Tread
well. At the end of his speech the lobby
gave him an ovation, giving three cheers
for the nominee and calling repeatedly for
him. Mr. Guilfoyle said:
"In selecting candidates for the office of
.Police Judge one must bear in mind three
facts: .-First, is the candidate capable of
filling the office; second, is he capable of
acting as a barrier between the criminal
element and the public at large, and
third, is he honest and upright? The
gentleman I name has all these qualifi
cations. He has 'been, admitted to prac
tice in all the courts, and he will be up
held ln'aH his decisions. The reception
you have gi-ven his name indicates that
no eulogy of mine is required."
Edgar PiMxotto nominated Charles A.
Low, saying:
â¢ 'T do not need to say much in intro
ducing Mr. Low. He is not only O. X..
but he is O. R. I can point with pride
to the rec,ord he has njade during the
time he has been oh the bench."
The nomination was seconded by JÂ» W.
' Delegate Caldwell placed before tho2
convention the name of Thomas F. Gra
ham. It was received with tumuVtui>us ap
plause, hats being thrown in the dlr and
other evidence of approval being accorded
It. Mr. Caldwell said:
"I desire to place in nomination for the
office of police Judge ' a manly
man, a young man, one who was
born, raised and educated in this
city. He is a .self-made man. . As a
youth he was an apprentice at the union'
Iron Work?. .When his. day's work was
done at the forge. and anvil ho went to his
home and carefully studied his law
books: After a lime he left the anvil and
took with him the best wishes of all his
fellow workmen. He" graduated from law
college. Shortly after 'being admitted to
practice he acted as assistant prosecuting
attorney of Police Court No.. 3. Even a
Democratic Board of Supervisors recog
nized his worth and advanced him to the
prosecuting attorneyship.' He won the
esteem of all with whom he came
in contact. He will temper mercy with
justice in all his official acts." '
At the conclusion of the nominating
-c-ch delegates arose all over the hall
to second it. The nominations were
closed and the secretary instructed to
cast the ballot. When the result. was an- ;
nounced Delegate Nathan asked that it
be made of record- that he did not vote
for Judge Joachimsen.
The next order of business was the nom
ination of five justices of the Peace. An
attempt was made to adjourn, but It was
voted down. Delegate. . Morgenstern
opened the battle by nominating lhomas
Gnston Straus nominated Joseph E.
Delegate Burdette placed Frank H.
Kerrigan in nomination, eulogizing him
for the dignity and ability he has shown
in the office during the past four years
A M. Currie nominated G. W . F. Cook. ;
J. W. Bird nominated Oliver Olsen in â¢
an entirely unconventional . speech- that
amused the- delegates and drew applause
from them. He said his candidate rep
resented the : Swedes, Norwegians and
Danes. â  ..'
The name of G. C. Groezlnger was pre
sented by Samuel Rosenheim and sec
onded by Robert Dennis. The vote was
taken on rollcall of districts. Mr. Olsen
received the. smallest number of - votes,
and thus retired, .leaving the field to his
opponents. â  again, took the plat-
Edgar Peixotto again, took the Plat
form,, this time to .nominate R. H. Web
ster for Superintendent of Schools. The
nomination was made unanimous. For
School Directors- it was determined that
nominations be made and then _- passed
upon by a committee .of five. They will
be voted upon to-night. This conclusion
was only arrived at after an acrimonious
debate. â¢. â  : " â¢'Â«: - ... , ' .

The assertion made recently by the Ex

the Republican ticket In Alameda County
are pledged to vote, in the event of their
election, for M. H. de Young for United
States Senator, is a falsehood made out
of whoie cloth. . The legislative nominees
are not pledged for De Young or for any

only fair to make the iact known to the

BART BURKE OPPOSED
THE DEMOCRATIC SLATE
He Arraigned the Managers of the Municipal
Convention Last Night and Was
Wildly Cheered.
â¢ . . . â 
The Programme for Coroner Failed, but the Candidates for
Police Judges and Justices of the Peace Went
Through Without a Hitch.
Ex-Senator Bart Burke of Santa Cruz
raised his voice in angry protest last
night against the manner in which the
"slate" was being run through in the
Democratic .municipal convention. The
gallery and audience were with him and
cheered until their throats gave out.
Burkes arraignment of the managers
of the convention upset part of their pro
gramme. Dr. E. E. Hill, an assistant
surgeon at the water front branch of the
Receiving Hospital, who was not on the
"slate," carried off the nomination for
Coroner much to the disgust of the self
appointed bosses-. They had promised to
give the nomination to Dr. George M.
Terrill, but after Burkes speech they
were unable to carry out their contract.
The convention was called to order In
Odd Fellows' Hall at 8:1.". o'clock by
Chairman McGee, who announced that
the first order of business would ba the
report of the committee appointed to
canvass the names of aspirants for nomi
nation for the School Board.
â  Ex-Judge Cope, chairman of the com
mittee, reported that while many names
had been canvassed, no selections or rec
ommendations had been agreed upon. He
promised, however, to have the report
ready, to-night when the convention meets
in B'nai B'rith Hall.
George McGillivray reported for the
committee on Supervisors that they
would not be able to report before to
night, and further time was granted.
.timothy Lyons then placed Michael
Me.ipher, whom he described as an argo
naut of 1832, In nomination for Recorder.
"Mprigher is an oN.-time Democrat," said
Lyons, "and as he is out of business now
he will "have leisure and time to devote
to the office."
Edmund Godchaux. secretary of the
Board of Health, was named for the Re
cordership by Sidney M. Van Wyck Jr.
Van "Wyck asked the delegates to do
their duty by nominating Godchaux, not
withstanding any combinations that
might have been made. "When God
chaux was in. the Legislature," Bald Van
Wyck, "his every vote showed that he
was opposed to the railroad, and that is
the kind of men we want on our ticket."
Barna McKinne started out to second
the nomination of Godchaux and wound
up. with a denunciation of the railroad
and its methods. "I want to know," said
he, "if the railroad can come in here and
terrify the delegates? It Is a bad busi
ness to have the railroad running things."
McKinne then sld-etracked and was pro
ceeding, to name prominent Democratic
attorneys who were retained by the rail
road to fight damage suits, when some
one in tho gallery called time and he sat
down. : â¢ . . â  . .
Max Popper, in seconding the. nomina
tion of Moagher, said Meagher was one
of. the old-time' Democrats, and that he
had almost taken his life in hia hands
when he marched in Democratic proces
sions in 1860.
Judge Cope pleaded with the conven
tion to "do the fair thing" by nominating:
Godchaux/ He pleaded in vain, however,
for Meagher was on the "slate," having
been chosen by the bosses instead of ex-
Senator Plnder, who was driven out of
the fight by the Examiner.
The roll was called and Meagher receiy-
Ed 49 votes. Oodchaux had thirty-eight
friends In the convention, who voted for
him.
The nomination of Meagher was then
made unanimous on motion of Van Wyck.
When Chairman McGee announced that
it was next in order to nominate a can
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1898.
dldate for Surveyor M. C. Ilassett. ac
cording: to programme, moved that the
nomination be deferred until to-night.
"I object to any such procedure," ex
claimed Bart Burke. "We can nominate
to-night as well as to-morrow night. I
object to the way some people are try
ing to manage the convention. They
don't seem to have much confidence in
the majority of us. for they don't let us
in on their work. I now think that it
is about time some of us were taken into
the confidence of the convention. While
we have every confidence in the leader
of our local ticket. I know and the rest
of you know that he has satellites man
aging this convention. We want fair
play and if we don't get It, gentlemen,
the ticket will be badly handicapped. I
have felt and others have felt that w r e
are not being properly treated by the
managers of the convention. Let us nom
inate our candidate for Surveyor to-night
and stop the practice of postponing nom
inations from one night to another."
The gallery and lobby cheered and
yelled and Charles Fay, Mayor Phelan's
mouthplece. looked anything but pleased.
. "I suggest that Senator Burkt nominate
his candidate," said Sammy Braunhart
facetiously..
Braunhart was greeted with a storm
of hisses, and there were yells from all
parts of the hall for him to sit down.
"If I had a candidate," said Burke, "I
would not talked as I have. I'm not
making any slate for this convention. All
I want and demand is fair play."
The audience again cheered.
Ex-Judge Cope trupn placed Bernard
Blenfleld in nomination for Surveyor and
there being no other aspirants the secre
tary was instructed to oast the ballot for
him.
M. C. Hassett arose to "repudiate the
intimation" that there was a "slate," but
quickly sat down when the spectators in
the gallery commenced to hiss.
Dr. George M. Terrill was on the
"slate" for Coroner, but Burkes speech
killed him off. Dr. E. E. Hill was placed
In nomination against him, and the gal
lery gods shouted and yelled. They cheer
ed Dr. Hill into the nomination, for he
received 51 out of the 86 votes cast, and
was declared the choice of the conven
tion.
The slate was then brought out again
with the names of Charles T. Conlan,
Edward P. Mogan. William G.
and Finlay Cook on it as candidate? for
Police Judges. There was no opposition,
and Secretary Walsh was instructed to
cast -the ' ba.llot for them.
Mogan was nominated to fill the unex
pired term caused by the death of
Judge Campbell, and M. Greenblatt was
nominated for the unexplred term for
Treasurer.
William A. White. Leonard Stone,
George H. Cabaniss, Frank J. Burke, Jo
seph C. Meyerstein, Harry McClaughey.
Alfred J. Fritz, Frank Schilling and
John A. Carroll were placod in nomina
tion for Justices of the Peace. Stone, Mc-
Claughry, Cabariss, Burke and Fritz
carried off the prizes. The vote stood:
White 50, Stone 53, Cabaniss 66, Burke 53,
Meyerstein 41, McClaughry 62, Fritz SS,
Schilling 34 and .Carroll 27.
M. C. Hassett, Max Popper, Colonel W.
P. Sullivan, J. D. Maxwell and Rudolph
Herald were appointed to arrange for a
ratification meeting when the convention
concludes its labors.
An adjournment was then taken until
to-night at B'nai B'rlth Hall. '

hush every breath of suspicion his opoo
nents may endeavor to cast within his
path. He has lived twenty years in this
State, and for a decade has been a resi
dent of this city. His record is known
in every county, in every city and every
hamlet of this State. He has been a
member of the Supreme Court, and his

the State,, and the people accepted him.
No right suffered at his hands and no
wrong was permitted to outdo the right.
I present the name of William F. Fitz
gerald. [Cheers.]
"I do not intend to make a speech. I
see by your enthusiasm that you know
the gentleman. He will bring a tower of
strength to this ticket if nominated, and
by your demonstration I have no fear
that my wishes will pasÃ unheeded."
The nomination of Judge Fitzgerald was
seconded by A. Ruef. He said that when
sucn men as Judge Fitzgerald consented
to accept the nomination for City and

No other names being presented, the
nomination of Fitzgerald was made by ac
clamation. It was announced that he
would appear and address the convention
this' evening. '
Nominations for Auditor were called

you wilt strengthen it from top to bot
tom."
Mr. Slebe's nomination was seconded

HAD TO ABANDON HER
BIG LUMBER RAFT
THE PBOGBESO FOBCED FROM
THE CONTEST.
Stuck to Her Tow for Eleven Days
and Then Had to Cut Adrift
When Off Point Beyes.
The steamer Progreso arrived in port
yesterday without the raft of piles she
was towing down. Heavy weather was
encountered, and one-half of the .huge
mass broke adrift. Early yesterday morn
ing a heavy swell and a nasty cross sea
was met and the. rest of the raft broke
adrift. When the Progreso reached port
all she had to show for eleven days of
hard towing was about. sixty torts of chain
which was towing behind her.
As the Progreso gave up the attempt
j to bring the raft into port, the Humboldt
j is going to try it. She got in from Seat
tle yesterday at 2 p. m., and . an hour
later had discharged her passengers and
was on her way out to sea to look for the.
derelict. Captain Bonnlfleld had an ex
perience with the menace to navigation
early in the morning. At 8 a. m. the
i lirst portion was met, end from that hour
â  up to 10:30 a. m. floating piles were con
stantly passed. A lookout was then kept
for the remainder of the raft, and it-'wus
! sighted six or seven miles west of Point
i Reyes. " Seas were breaking clear over it,
I but it was intact. Should the Humboldt
| bring the remains of the raft in it will
be a lucky find for that fortunate vessel.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
i steamer Bertha arrived frqm St. Michael
yesterday. She brought down about sixty
miners and nearly a million' in gold, dust
I and drafts. Fourteen boxes for the Ala's-
I ka Commercial Company contained $350,000
! worth cf dust alone. The steamer Cleve
land was still nt St. Michael when I . the
Bertha sailed. Pat Galvin, who owns the
steamer's cargo, had to purchase the river
I steamer Tukoner in order to get his stuff
up to Dawson. .As soon as -it has been
discharged from' the Cleveland into the
Yukoner the former will return to San
Francisco.
T. P. H. Whltelaw and the workmen
who went Up with him era the Slntram
will return on the next trip of the Leele
naw. They have completed all the rivjÂ»r
boats and barges save one, and that one
will remain on the stocks until next
spring.
There was a thrilling accident on the
British ship Alcinous yesterday. The tug
Sea King was taking her to sea, and when
two miles outside the heads a sailor fell
overb oard from the ship's forecastle. Cap
tain Harry Marshall, of the Sea King,
saw the man fall and slowed up. The
men on the ship saw the accident also, for
as the sailor drifted past the vessel's
stern a line was thrown and caught, and
in a few seconds the sailor was aboard
again, none the worse for his ducking.
It was a wonderfully smart piece of work.
DOCKERY'S TRIAL
WAS POSTPONED
THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROS
ECUTION WERE MISSING.
Continuance Granted to October 19 So
as to Secure Their Attendance
if j-'ossible.
The Board of Health did not try Chief
Food Inspector Dockery last evening. The
Inspector was rendy and so was the
board, but the complainant, Isaac Leip
sic, scored a dismal failure as a prosecut
ing quantity. He did, in fact, appear be
fore the Board, being represemed by At
torney Wilson, but was only able to an
nounce that his witnesses, some twenty
in number, were all missing. Mr. Wilson
stated that he had just been called into
the case and knew little of its merits. He
asked whether the Board of Health had
power to subpoena witnesses to the case,
admitting the inability of his client to
get those. he had counted upon without
the compulsory process of the law. He
declared t hut Mr. Leipsic was confident
or proving that "Inspector Dockery was
incompetent, showed favoritism and was
moreover, addicted to drunkenness:"
Attorney Dunn of the. Prosecuting At
torney s office, representing Dockerv
stated that his side , was ready and
anxious to go ahead: that twenty-three
witnesses were present to vouch for Mr.
Dockery and rebut all charges brought
against him. The Inspector wanted no
whitewash and would do all in his power
to assist Mr. Leipsic in getting the case
tried.
Wilson replied that several of the com
plainant s witnesses had been present ear
lier in the evening, but had gone away.
He would be obliged to ask for a post
ponement arid any assistance that the
board could give in securing the attend
ance of witnesses for the prosecution.
Dunn assured his opponent that any
nelp which the prosecuting attorney's of
fice could rive in corraling the absent
witnesses for the other side would be
freely extended. At the same time he
stated that so. far as he knew the Board
of Health had no power to compel the
attendance of witnesses.
It. was finally determined to allow Mr
Llepsic to have another chance at Dock
ery on Wednesday, October 19.
The board then settled down to the con
sideration of Texas fever among Solano
County cattle and to devise some method
or keeping the diseased meat out of the
Â°Â«n Francisco market. Dr. Bazet stated
that the epidemic was becoming wide
spread in Solano County and certain
other sections of the State, and that some
Pteps should be taken to regulate the sale
of cattle dying from Texas fever.
Dr. Root presented evidence to the
board that the fever was now developing
all over the State, and declared that the
meat of cattle dying from it was being
shipped to this city. He further said that
there were so few outward symptoms of
disease in the infected cattle "that an in
spection by ordinary laymen was almost
useless. As for the meat being unhealthy'
to consume, he thought that it was far
preferable to other diseased meat, but
still was objectionable on account of the
febrile conditions of the cattle preceding
death.
The whole matter was finally referred
to the State Board of Health: "

HEAVYWEIGHT PUGILISTS.
JACK STELZNER and JOE KENNEDY. Who Will Meet To-Morrow Night
... in Woodward's Pavilion,
Joe Kennedy, the popular heavy-weight pugilist of the Excelsior Ath
letic Club, who has trained down from 220 pounds to 190 pounds in six
weeks by a Course of hard training, will meet the clever and hard-hitting
Jack Stelzner in a twenty-round contest to-morrow evening at Woodward's
Pavilion.
Kennedy was always selected by Tom Sharkey whenever the pugilistic
sailor had use for a boxing paTtner in this city. Sharkey frequently said
that Kennedy, when In condition, should hold his own with any heavy
weight In the land. In fact, the sailor had a great respect for Kennedy's
right fist, which on more than one occasion stirred up the fighting Dlood of
the herculean Irishman during sparring sessions.
Stel*ner, who has been the sparring partner of Champion Bob Fitzsim
mons, will introduce many new moves, which will doubtless puzzle the
representative of the Excelsior Club, whose style of fighting is round
arm. Contests between heavy-weights are always pleasing to the sport
ing; fraternity of this city, who delight to hear the sounds of the big
gloves when they patter on body or face.
The preliminaries will consist of ten-round contests between Patsy
Corrlgan and Jack La Rue, and Phil Green and Young Peter Jackson.
STRUCK THE BOY
WHO BIT HIS HAND
COLONEL PARNELL CHARGED
WITH CRUELTY.
The Secretary of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren Explains.
Colonel Parnell, secretary of the Cali
fornia Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children, has aroused the Indig
nation of a number of occupants of the
Central Market building at 223 Powell
street through his alleged, cruelty to a
nine-year-old boy who was left In his
custody by a mother who could not sup
port her children.
The charge has been placed in the hands
of Secretary Wadham of the Eureka So
ciety for the Protection of Children, and
he is now gathering evidence with a view
to having Colonel Parnell punished for
cruelty.
The trouble grew out of Mrs. C, John
son's effort to have her son fiarl and her
daughter Valentine sent to a charitable
institution, as she was unable to support
them. Young Johnsqn was brought to the
society's room on .Friday last, and when
the mother started to leave Without him.
he set up nn â  unearthly creaming-. .The
occupants of neighboring offices ran Into
the hall to learn the cause and- discovered
that they emanated from the society's
headquarters. The . doors were found
locked, and in trying to gain admittance
they attracted the attention of Mrs. Pres
cott, the assistant secretary, who opened
the door. At that woment the colonel wad
seen to slap the boy. and was immediate
ly remonstrated with by Indignant witr
nesses. . â 
A Dr. Henderson attempted to enter the
colonel's presence witn a view to stopping
further punishment, -when 'he was firmly
and coldly told- to leave. On his refusal
to- do so the now indignant secretary
pushed him out and closed and locked the
door.
One lady, Mrs. Sherman by name, who
has adjoining offices, was so grieved at
the boys treatment that she cried all af-'
ternoon. In speaking about the incident
yesterday, she said:- "I thought it was
strange that a society that cares â -. for
children should- treat them so Inhumanly
as did Colonel Parnell. its representative.
I was shocked, and had I been a man he
would not have acted as he did."
Secretary' Parnell's version of the affair
places the case in an entirely different
light. He stated that the boy- became
hysterical as soon as the. mother left
him. He screamed and carried on in a,
manner that caused -nearly â " all of the
people in the building to assemble In the
hall. Mrs. Prescott did all that ' she
could to quiet him, but the youngster
struggled and bit her hands until she was
almost exhausted. Then she turned the
boy over to the secretary, who had no
better success in quieting him. After
struggling to get out of the door the lad
got the aged soldier's finger in his mouth
and began to close his teeth down in a
manner that caused the colonel much
pain. The boy was struggling on the

MATAXZAS, Cuba, Sept. 28. â Matanzas, once rich and: prosperous, to-day presents a sad picture of con
tradiction. Here one sees the streets "filled with starving wretches who die almost too fast to find men to, bury
them. Twenty- rive thousand reconcentrados began congregating in the city in January of last year. A month
later they began to die from hunger, and have continued doing so ever since. Between January, 1897, and Sep
tember, 1898. 10,066 persons died in the city of Matanzas. 80 per cent of them, according to the doctors' certifi
cates, from starvation and nothing else. Fully half the reconcentrados have no shelter at night. They live and
sleep in the streets. It is almost impossible to walk a block in the heart of the city without seeing some wreck
of a human beihg. too weak to go farther, lying pn the sidewalk, gasping and moaning. Mothers, half skeletons
themselves, crouch with sad-faced children under the shadow of the arches at the palace, begging centavos of the
soldiers, who drive them away. Five or six drop dead in the streets every day. The first duty of the "Guardia Civ

cix weeks. His death was without

JURIST AND DIPLOMAT.
Career of Thomas Francis Bayard in
Which He Gained Distinction.
Thomas Francis Bayard was a distin
guished member of an eminent family.
Since long before the revolutionary war
times the Bayards have boen conspicuous
In the country's history as patriots and
statesmen, and many, acqilred national
fame as Jurists. Four mc-rnbers of the
Bayard family have had Senatorial hon
ors bestowed upon them by the / little
Btate of Delawareâ Thomas Francis Bay
ard, his father. James Asheton Bayard:
his grandfather, of the same name, the
negotiator of the treaty of Ghent, and his
uncle, Richard Henry Bayard. HA grand
mother's father. Governor Bassett of Del
aware, was also the recipient of Senator
ial honors.
Thomas Francis Bayard was born in
Wilmington, Del., October 29. 182 S. and was
a younger son. In his thirteenth year he
entered school at Flushing, L. I. Here
he remained two years. At the expim
tion of that period, being intended by his
father for mercantile pursuits, a clerkship
was obtained for him in the establishment
of Mr. Bayard's brother-in-law, August
Van Cortlandt Schermerhorn. Here he re
ceived an excellent business training. In
1848 his elder brother died, whereupon, at
the request of his parents, he returned to
Wilmington. Having a liking for his
father's profeesfon, that of law, he be
came a student with that end In view,

and was. admitted to the bar In ISSI. He
immediately began the practice of his pro
fession with his father, and was success
ful from the beginning, his local fame
spreading rapidly. In 1858 he was ap

for Delaware, but resigned the following.
year. â¢ â¢ '
. When the war of thÂ« rebellion began
Mr. Bayard was pursuing his profession.
With the first muuerings of war the
people of Wilmington set about estab
fishing means of, .self-protection. A mili
tary company was organized and Thomas
F. Bayard was elected its first lieuten
ant. In June, ISCO, the famous peace
meeting of citizens- was held at Dover,
and Lieutenant Bayard was. one of the
principal speakers. He denounced the
war, and his remarks on that occasion
have been quoted in later years as an
argument against his availability as a
Presidential candidate.
Meanwhile Mr. Bayard's popularity In
his native State kept growing 1 rapidly,
and In ISGS he was elected to succeed
his father in the United States Senate.
It Is noteworthy that on the day he was
elected to the Senate, for the. full term,
his father, who had resigned, ..was also
re-elected a Senator from Delaware to
serve for the unexplred part of his orig
inal term. This is the only case of a
father and san being voted for by the
same Legislature to fill the -Senatorial
offices.
In October. 18T.6, Senator Bayard was
married to Louisa, daughter of Joseph
Lee, a Baltimore banker. Twelve chil
dren were the result of the union. In
1877 Senator Bayard received the hon-
orary degree of LL.D. from Harvard
College. ; â  (. " '
' As soon" as the result of the national
election of 1884 was positively known Mr.
Bayard was the first Democratic states
man- invited to. consult . with President
elect Cleveland, and it was generally un
derstood that he was the first man of
fered' a place In the new Cabinet â the
leading place at that. This he finally ac
cepted, although It was said that he was
'strongly advised by leading Democrats
not to enter the Cabinet at all. asjiis de
parture from the Senate . would . tend to
weaken the strength of the party in' that
body. â¢ '."â ".â¢;:
At the close of Mr. Cleveland's admin
istration Mr. Bay. returned to private
life and to his legal profession. /
In March, 1898, Mr. Bayard' was appoint
ed Embassador to the Court of St. James
and served during Mr. Cleveland's second
term. :
. Mr. Bayard's first wife died In the first
year of his term as Secretary, of State.
Four years later he was married to Miss
Mary W. Cllnmar of Washington, who
survives him." Seven of the children' are

STRONG TESTIMONY
. AGAINST MMNTYRE
The Prosecution Announces That It
Will Close Its Case To-.tforrow \
Morning.
DENVER, Sept. 28.â The court-martial"
of Chaplain Joseph P. Mc.Tntyre of the :
battleship Oregon was resumed this
morning. Several witnesses testified that
the chaplain's remarks had been correctly
reported in the newspapers'. The sub
stance .of their testimony was that Chap
lain Mclntyre charged Admiral Sampson
with reporting himself within four miles
of the Spanish ship .Colon when she sur
rendered, when In reality he was at least
eight miles away; that he charged Cap
tain Evans of the lowa with running
away from the fight, referring to him
contemptuously as "Fighting Bob. " and
that he charged that Eastern shipbuild
ers obtained contracts from the Govern- !
ment by means of political pulls, and
That the Oregon was the only battleship
that was honestly built.
After these witnesses had testified
Judge Advocate Lauchefmer gave notice
that the prosecution would rest its casÂ»
to-morrow morning and would probably
introduce no more witnesses.

VANDALS ROBBED
COLUMBUS' TOMB
Portion of the Remains
Missing.
Officials Observe Great Secrecy in the
Farcical Ceremony of Remov
ing the Explorer's
Bones.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Sept. 28 (via Key "West,
Fla., Sept. 2Sr.)â Mystery and secrecy
surround all the official acts of the
Spanish Government. Especially was :
this the case In exhuming the remains
of Columbus, and this fact has caused
much unfavorable- comment and given
rise to errave rumors, which, though un
confirmed, appf lr to have some found
ation, as there has been no attempt at
denial from any source. The. removal
of the remains, which should have
been- a public ceremony, was' veiled in"!
the deepest mystery and was effected
behind closed doors of the: cathedral,
which was guarded by an armed force.'
Few of the authorities were present,
the names of those who were to attend
being handed. to the Chief of Police the |
night before in General Blanco's own
handwriting. The- Chief of PollceÂ«sug
gested that comments would be made
by the press upon the secrecy of the
proceedings and asked whether it would
not be advisable to allow representar
tives. of the newspapers to be present.
To this General Blanco positively re- .
fused to accede, telling the Chief of Po
lice to limit himself exclusively to the
list of guests which had been handed
to hi.m.
" No official account of the ceremony
or statement regarding the condition
i of the remains' has been made public,
â¢ but it has leaked out from an almost
authoritative source that they are not
in exactly the same condition as when
they were placed in the niche. When
\ the remains were placed in the maiiso
l leum a small casket was enclosed, con
taining coins, gold and silver medal's,
preckms stones and rolls of parchment,
as was then, the custom upon the occa
sion of a burial. It appears that this
j casket had been tampered with and
i rifled of its contents, and further ru
mors say that only portions of the re
mains arr> left.
Gossip of scandal and speculation ere
rife, the truth of which the authori
ties make.no effort to affirm or contra
dict. A quasi-official explanation,.
1 however, is to the effect that secrecy
was given to the ceremony because a
cable dispatch received here reported
that General Toral had been murdered
in Madrid the day before, and fears
were entertained that disorders might
, occur if the public and military came
together in great numbers.
Some of the more radical Spaniards
!go to the length of saying that the
whole ceremony was a farce, the Gov
ernment at Washington having object
ed to the removal of the remains and
this Government going through panto
mime in order -to make the public be
; Meve the remains, which are really left
I here, were shipped to Spain.-
CUBAN SOLDIERS FEAST
WHILE NATIVES PERISH
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. C opyrlgrh ted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
â Â® MATANZ AS, Cuba, Sept. 28. â About four miles from the city is the camp of General Betancourt, the in-
O surgent commander of Matanzas province. I visited it to-day with General Betancourt. There are about 700
Â® men, all well clothed and well fed. General Betancourt led me himself into the hut used for commissary stores.
O It was piled high with barrels of beans, cornmeal and. jerked beef. General Betancourt told me his men were
0 regularly supplied .with all the food they wanted by systematic contributi6ns from rich Cuban sympathizers. Ma
Â© tanzas thus has plenty of food for able-bodied men, but hardly a loaf of bread for the women and children dying
0 like dogs, in the streets. In the course of an interview I had with General Betancourt, he said:
O "We began this revolution against Spain for our independence,, nothing else. The thought of annexation
0 never entered our minds. We will never lay down our arms until Cuba is absolutely independent. It is all non
q sense for the United States to send any soldiers or officers here. We are abundantly able to take care of that
0 part of it ourselves." . :
QUEEN LOUISE
OF DENMARK IS
CALLED TO REST
Death of the Aged Wife of King
Christian IX Early This
Morning.
Was Known as the Mother-in-Law of Europe
and the Counselor of Crowned
Heads.
Special Dispatch to The Ca'.l.
COPENHAGEN, Sept. 29.â The Queen
of Denmark died at 5:40 this morning.
Queen Louise was born September 7,
loi7, and was the daughter of Land
grave Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel. She
was married to King Christian IX of
Denmark May 26, 1842.
l^ast August the report was received
that she had lost her mind and had
suddenly collapsed into, a state of
dotage.
Her illness was mental rather than
physical, and It was a great grief to
Queen Louise's family- and entourage,
for she was known until recently as
one of- the most clever women in the
Old World. She has been nicknamed
the "Mother-in-law of Europe," and it
is certain that throughout the reign of
the late Emperor Alexander of Russia
she. was his source, of inspiration and
his personal counselor, besides acting
as the chief adviser of her favorite son,
who reigns as King George of Greece.

KEYNOTE IS STRUCK
AS TO ANNEXATION
Republicans Deem It Necessary to
Secure the Next H ous^ of
Representatives.
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â A Washington special to the Herald 6ays:
New York Republicans have struck a keynote an the subject' of Phil
ippine annexation, which will probably be taken up by their party
throughout the country, and by the time the Congressional campaign
ia fairly under way the party will be thoroughly committed to an
nexation. At the Republican Congressional headquarters the greatest
importance, is attached to the necessity of electing a Republican
House of Representatives this fall, on account of the effect it will
have upon European nations, by showing them that the President has
the support of the country, in his policy in dealing with the territory
conquered from Spain. Representative Hull of lowa, chairman of the
Republican Executive Committee, said to-day: "Europe would regard
the election of a Democratic .House of Representatives as a vote of
lack of confidence in the administration and its policy, and would take
advantage of the situation to attempt to keep this country from shar
ing in the benefits that are to follow as a result of the opening up of
the Orient to- commerce."
She has always been averse to con
stitutionalism, and by many she Is
blamed for the refusal of her Musco
vite son-in-law to do anything toward
providing his empire with s. more lib
eral, form of government than that by
means of which he rules.
Queen Louise was in her 81st year,
and has never been quite the same
since her serious Illness a year ago.
The loss of her mental faculties, how
ever, is reported to have been very sud
den and correspondingly sad.
| It was first observed by the widowed
; Czarina on her arrival at Copenhagen.
, and she lost no time in summoning her
; brothers and aisters. who each hasten
' ed to Copenhagen a fortnight ahead of
the time originally set for the meeting.
The Princess 6t Wales, it. may be add
ed, was so much alarmed by the tele
gram of her sister, the Empress, that
she insisted -"on taking her family,

WILL CONDUCT
INVESTIGATION
AT SANTIAGO
Commission Will Gall Upon Gen
erals Miles and Shafter
to Testify.
Commander in Chief of trje Arroy May Decline,
Preferring to Trust His Case
to Congress.
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â The "Wash-
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: After completing their labors
In Washington the commissioners who
are investigating the conduct of the
war will go to Santiago. This will be
the last thing done. They expect to
spend a week in the Cuban port. An
examination will be made of the point
of landing of the army and of the facil
ities for landing supplies. Every point
bearing upon the work before the com
mission will be covered. This will in
volve evidence from both General Miles
and General Shafter.
Both General Miles and General
Shafter will be asked to go upon the
stand. They may refuse, it Is thought
by. some members of the commission,
but this Is not considered probable. The
commission, however, will spare no ef
fort to get a hearing from them. No
doubt would have been entertained as
to the willingness of these generals to
testify but for one fact. General MiTes
recently called upon Chairman Dodge
of the commission and requested that
he be not called befere it. General
Dodge gave no satisfactory answer,
but the understanding of the commis
sion is that General Miles had made up
his mind to be satisfied with nothirg
less than a Congressional Investigation.
From another source 1 learn that
General Mites has his version of the
Santiago campaign fully formulated
and when an investigation is had he
wishes to have It rigorous, acute and
final.
There is no concealment of the fact
that there are many differences between
General Miles and General Shafter, and
General Miles prefers to trust his cas>?
to Congress. In spite of this he will
be asked to appear before the commis
sion.
Secretary Alger also will certainly
bt asked to appear.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.â Only four
members of the commission appointed
to investigate the conduct of. the war
were present at the forenoon session
to-day, and In the absence of replies to
the interrogatories sent to the Secre
tary of War and his subordinates very
little business was transacted. Colonel
Denby was . elected vice-chairman of
the commission, and In the absence of
Chairman Dodge presided over the
session to-day.
The only Important matter brought
to the attention of the commission was
a report by General Wilson of the en
gineer department of the army, of
which he is the chief. No statement
was called for from him because there
were no charges against this depart
ment, but General Wilson, being a
member of the commission, concluded
that to furnish one would be an appro
priate proceeding. The document was
held for disposition, by the full com
mission, and, consequently, was not
given to the press. It is a detailed
statement showing the condition of the
department on the Ist of last April.
Just before the declaration of war. as
compared with Its condition on the 31st
of August last, after the cessation of
hostilities, and it deals especially with
torpedoes and fortifications. Included
in it is a letter written by General Wil

SECRETARY OF WAR
COMPLETES HIS TOUR
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.â Secretary
Alger has returned to Washington. He
came to the War Department imme
diately after breakfast, and was soon
besieged by a number of persons who
had been waiting for his return.
Later he made a verbal report to the
President on the inspection of the army
camps, which he has Just concluded.
During the interview Secretary Long
came over from the Navy Department
and joined the party in the Cabinet
room.
On leaving the White House Secre
tary Alger said he was much gratified
with the conditions of the camps gen
erally. In a general way the camps
were kept satisfactorily, but there
were, he conceded, points which m;ght
have been improved upon, citing par
ticularly the unsatisfactory condition
of the sinks at some places.
"The main trouble found," said Sec
retary Alger, "was, perhaps, the lack
of care the troops took of themselves."
Secretary Alger says the report of a
scene in General Breckinridge's head
quarters at Lexington when he was
inspecting that camp was absolutely
without foundation. There was no
scene, no high words and no excited
language. â  The Secretary says the story
was made out of whole cloth. Secre
tary Alger and Generals Ludington and
Sternberg each have lettens from Gen
eral Wiley, who was reported as hav
ing made accusations against them, ex
pressing his regret that any such report
was circulated.

UNCLE SAM WILL
NOT LOSE ON THE

Assistant Secretary Vanderlip
Says the Road Is Able to
Pay tfje Debt
He Also Tells of Plans for Shipping Silver
Bullion F ron ) Philadelphia to
San Francisco.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CalJ Office, Riggs House;.
Washington, Sept. 23.
Assistant Secretary Yamlcrlip of the
Treasury Department returned to-night
from a trip to Chicago. He went there
on two missions, one to investigate the
condition of the Central Pacific Rail
road and the other to arrange for an
enormous shipment of silver bullion
across the continent. Mr. Vanderlip
Bald to-night that he had not com
pleted either mission. It was impossi
ble to see many of the people he de
sired to consult about the Central Pa
cific and he had not completed arrange
ments for the shipment of bullion.
"It is contemplated," he said, "to
Ehip about ten million ounces of silver
bullion across the continent from the
Mint in Philadelphia to the Mint in
San Francisco. Such shipments are
usually made by express and we have
a contract %vith the express companies
to ship all the money by express. But
bullion is not money any more than
pig iron is, and there is no more rea
son why we should ship pigs of silver
by express than we should ship pigs
of lead that way. Ten million ounces
of silver weighs 833,333 pounds troy or
625,000 pounds avoirdupois. This is no
trifling weight and it would be a great
expense to the Government to ship it
by express. It will take fifteen or twen
ty cars to carry this amount. If we
ship it by express the companies will
assume the risk and furnish guards,
hut if we ship it by freight we furnish
our own guards and take the risk.
Really I believe there is little risk,
hardly any more so than if it were lead.
We would select the heaviest pigs,
weighing 1000 ounces, or about sixty
five pounds. These would be loaded on
cars and a tourist car placed at each
end of the train.
"The guards would occupy the cars,
and every time the train stopped they
would surround it and prevent any one
from approaching it. There would be
little opportunity to remove any of the
pigs, as the cars would be new and of

It Is Learned in London That General

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 28.â The newspapers
of the country are clamorously demand
ing that the Government take the pub
lic into its confidence in regard to the
Fashoda affair, having been Informed
that General Kitchener's report has
reached the Foreign Office and that it
makes interesting developments. They
appear to be deeply disappointed that
diplomatists are to have the settlement
of the question, and express the fear
that Lord Salisbury will prove suscep
tible to French blandishments.
The Foreign Office has issued a for
mal refusal to make public any further
details of the affair, some of which,
however, are leaking out.
The Sirdar, according to these, after
Major Marchand refused to furl the
French flag, formally announced that
he had come to raise the Egyptian flag,
but before doing so he desired to know
whether Major Marchand wished to
enter a protest.
The Frenchman replied in the nega
tive and the Sirdar then planted the
Egyptian flag aloneâ not the Egyptian

Mr. Vanderllp would say little about

men he wanted to see were out of the

was selected by the committee ap
pointed by Congress to investigate this
matter, consisting of the Secretaries of
the. Treasury and Interior and the At-
I torney General, and to make an inquiry
of the matter and report to them. He
â¢ will make his report in about three

The Daily Chronicle this morning de
clares that General Kitchener had full
instructions as to how to meet the

thing happened as had been antici

"There is nothing now for France,"
says the Chronicle, "but to extricate

the Minister of the Colonies, M. Trouil

is not true that Major Marchand has
been abandoned. Up to the present
time, the Minister added, the French
Government has only the British ver
sion of the major's occupation of Fa

matter until the French officer's re
ports are received. The Minister fur
ther remarked that one essential point
has been secured In the evidence of a

NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â The Wash

been .received, in Washington regarding
the intention of Aguinaldo to formally
inaugurate his so-called republic of. the
Philippines, at Malolos to-morrow and
issue a proclamation to the nations of

of his government. It. is not believed,
however, by the officials of the admin

General Otis will take any notice of
the proceedings at Malolos, or that they
will accept the invitations to witness

certainly not recognize Aguinaldo as

nation will do so. The war is still
technically in progress between Spain
and the United States, and if any third
i power should recognize the insurgents
as independent during the progress, of
the war and during the pendency of
negotiations to determine the disposi

Spain would have the right to regard
such recognition as a. hostile act. It

Judge Maguire began by referring to
the contest as one between the classes

holding equal rights to all and the Re

the Southern Pacific. He argued that

SPAIN TO MAKE THE
BEST TERMS POSSIBLE
PARIS, Sept. 28.â The Gaulois says:
"In spite of the mystery surrounding:
the .matter we are able, from a high
source, to give an outline of the. posi
tion of both commissions. While the
Americans have instructions which are
much more precise than those of the
Spaniards, there is a diversity of opin
ion in regard to the Philippines. Sen
ator Gray is ' a very ardent Democrat,
and consequently belongs to the party
which repudiates expansion. He op
poses all annexation, and his opinion,
therefore, totally differs from that of
the other four commissioners, some of
whom would be content. with a coaling
station at the Philippines, possibly Ca
vite, while others, like Senator Davis,
advocate the annexation of the whole
archipelago."'
The Gaulois, however, believes that
tne Americans, by mutual concessions,
will come to an agreement, and that
they wiir be largely influenced by ;>su
jor General Merritt's reports on the sit
uation. The instructions to the Span
ish commission, according to the Gau
lois, are, briefly, to hold out and make
the best terms possible. Madrid is well
aware, it appears, that the conferences,
at the best, are only had to please the
Spanish people, and the. only hopes en
tertained are that the Americans will
not abuse the situation too much. Pop
ular sentiment in Spain, it is added,
thinks it. better to abandon the Philip
pine Islands than to keep them under
conditions rendering them ungovern
able. .*.â¢'â 
ated; fourth, that all the men were
nominated that independent Republican
papers' opposed. "VVith this alleged
proof he concluded that some one out
side of the convention named the ticket
and therefore it must have been the
Southern Pacific, as it is a source 6f
political influence. :
The allied parties' position on the
railroad question, he said, was clear
and specific; the Republican position
vague. Democrats and Populists op
posed refunding; Republicans said the
question was settled.
He did not think any party had a
mortgage on the glory of the war. He
thought the war had a chapter of
shame, and that was the manner, in
which the civil authorities had con
ducted rt. He disposed of : territorial
expansion by saying his party agreed
with McKinley. He gave General
Barnes several hard knocks, speaking
of him as an attorney for the Southern

OUTPOURING OF REPUBLICANS
REPETITION OF THE RECENT
OVATIONS. :
Vast Assemblage Shows Keen Appre
ciation of the Logical Flaying
of the Demopopic
Nominee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RIVERSIDE, Sept. 28.â The tour of
Henry T. Gage and General W. H. L.
Barnes through Southern California
has aroused exceptional enthusiasm
among the rnasies. Popular ovations
which distinguished the speaking at
Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernar*
dino, San Diego and Santa Ana are
seldom witnessed in. other than a Pres
idential -campaign-. The ..multitudes
which assemble to hear the standard
bearer and the eloquent exponent of
Republican principles bring with them
Democrats, Populists and so-called Sil
ver Republicans.
Throughout Riverside and Orange
counties the people are aroused to the
dangers o-f Magiiireism and apprehend
that the election of the. fusion ticket
with Maguire at the head would bring
disaster- to' the State, In comparison
with which another dry season would
be but an incident. The fruit growers
and others of the industrial population
In the Santa Ana Valley are looking
forward with confidence, to a period of
great prosperity. Already many mort
gages have been lifted as the result of
toil arid economy, and inquiries con
cerning the Investment of capital for
the future development .of the great
resources of this region impart confi
dence. Men who have wxirked hard
to upbuild the State shudder at the
suggestion of a Muguire triumph and
the introduction of socialistic and sin
gle tax delusions in the affairs of Cali
fornia. The earnestness of the people
is manifested at every great demon
stration.
It is readily observed that Gage is
growing rapidly in popularity. People
hearing Him talk are convinced or his
sincerity. Any man who is sincere can
get a good hearing in these intelligent
and progressive cities of Southern Cali
fornia.
Another strong point in Gage's favor
is that he has never fattened at the
public crib. He never held a politi
cal office and never sought to hold one;
he never drew a dollar from the public
treasury. Industrious men who till the
orchard, run the farms and â¢ pay the
taxes- necessary for the administration
of government view with distrust the
type of politician known as â¢ the
"chronic office seeker" who lives on the
public and is never happy when- he is
not drawing a fat salary from the pub
lic treasury. Gage comes from the
people, and comes free from the taint
of persistent office holding.-
The reception accorded to Henry T.
Gage, W. H. L. Barnes and J. C. Need
ham, the Congressional . nominee, to
day and to-night, attest the enthusiasm
of the people ' of Riverside County.
Coming from the scene of a great out
pouring at Santa Ana, the standard
bearer and General Barnes arrived
shortly before noon at Riverside. At
the railway station they were received
by -a. delegation of leading citizens
headed by C. F. Huse, chairman of the
Republican County Central Committee,
and escorted to the Glenwood Tavern.
Gage Is still among his friends and
neighbors and soon many of them came
forward to grasp his hand. An intro
duction- to .General Barnes is seldom
necessary- If he does not know every
one, every one knows him.
The general is an alert, observer', and
picks up a vast deal of information on
his travels. He alights on many a fact
and incident which one not gifted with
rare power of discernment might pass
unnoticed. To-day he was the "first in
the party to discover that Riverside is
a prohibition city.
Early in the evening a train from
San Bernardino arrived bringing two
hundred active Republicans. Other
specials and the regular trains rein
forced the local ranks. As the hour of
7 o'clock drew near the people wended
their way to the Loririg Opera-house.
Shortly after the doors were thrown
open the spacious house was crowded.-
All the seats on the stage, the boxes
and the circles were occupied. The
standing room was. appropriated with-,
out delay.- On the street in front of the
Loring the Riverside City band played
patriotic and popular music. The en
thusiasm deepened as the throng in
creased. The people came from Colton,
Redlands, Ontario, Perrls, San Jacinto,
Elsinore, Corona and the country pre
cincts immediately surrounding River
side.
When Henry T. Gage;, accompanied
by General Barnes, J. C. Needham, I.
N. Blackstock, the nominee for Rail
way Commissioner, and Major Kyle
took their places on the stage the audi
ence gave three hearty cheers.
The meeting was called to . order by
C. F. Huse, chairman of the county
committee. The first feature of the ex
ercises was a song by the Republican
Silver-Tongued Quartet of colored
boys. The song, "Good Evening, Mr.
Gage. Arn't You Not Glad That You
A:e Living and Quite Well?" made a
decided hit and the singers â Fred
White, Will Blanton, Tom Wilson and
Peter Polkâ were recalled. They sang
"Maguire Is a Foolish Man," with a
refrain, "Send Those Angels Down."

In a speech, able and well timed,
Captain Daniels predicted Republican
triumph.
Hon. J. C. Needham was presented
to the audience as the first speaker of
the evening. The Congressional nomi
nee made a eood speech. Hia exorea
sions and his bearing won the favor of
his hearers.
When Mr. Gage, the standard-bear-r,
was presented the applause was mighty
and prolonged. He was introduced as
a man belonging to' the people.
Mr. Gage did not speak at great
length, as he was constrained by the
courtesies of the campaign to yt -Id
some of his time to the "Congressionui
nominee, who was advertised to- speak
here to-night. Many of the questions
elaborately discussed in the great San
Diego speech were dwelt upon to-night.
The single tax heresies advocated by
Maguire were review*** The people of
Riverside were thankd for the support
which their delegation gave to the
speaker in the nomin^ fi ng convention
at Sacramento.. Attention was Called
to Maguire's assault on the integrity
.and manhood of ' the Riverside dele
gates when he spoke of them as rail
road hirelings who were dominated at
Sacramento- by corruption. Said Mr.
Gage:
"1 would not assail the Democratic
convention 'which nominated Mr. Ma
guire. I say it is beneath the dignity
and .honor of any one seeking the high
office of Governor of this State to thus
brand his fellow-man."
The speech of Mr. Gage was more in
the nature of a frank and confidential
talk with his neighbors than a formal
address. He replied happily to the criti
cism concerning his clothes and his
habit of putting his hands into his own
pockets. He advised his critics to de
fer comment on his. clothing, until they
saw the suit he would wear at the in-
augural ball.
Maguire's war record was reviewed.
The records were quoted to show that
Maguire voted against the war revenue
measure and did not vote to allow the
gallant soldiers the right of suffrage in
the Held. Maguire's record on the rail
road settlement bill was presented to
the audience. They paid close atten
tion to the points brought out by Mr.
Gage. The statement of fact was sus
tained by the production of the Con
gressional Record. This expose of Ma
guire's position on the railroad settle
ment created a sensation here as it did
in San Diego, San Bernardino and
Santa Ana. Great applause folLowed
the exposure of Maguire's attempt to
blend the judgment of the people in
this matter. The attitude of Senator
Morgan and Senator White toward
what Maguire called an infamous bill
was cited.
In closing, Mr. Gage promised that if
elected Governor he would give the
people of California a clean, honest and
business-like administration. â  The si
lence of the audience as Mr. Gage made
this pledge was solemn and impressive.
When he concluded the sentence there
was a- burst of applause. The audience
was impressed by his candor and sin
cerity.
The Silver Tongued Quartet sang
another song, "Good-by, Maguire,
Good-by." General Barnes was pre
sented to the vast assemblage as Cali
fornia's br'Hiant orator. The general
got great rounds of applause as he
arose to speak.
In masterly and eloquent fashion the
brilliant orator reviewed the platforms
of the parties and paid his respects to
the fusion nominee for Governor. He
quoted Maguire's language exalting the
nihilists as gentlemen holding uni
versity degrees. Reference was made
to Maguire's constant harping on the
single tax wherever he discussed any
measure in Congress, if there was a
proposition to build a lighthouse, Ma
guire introduced the single tax. The
inference was drawn that the "Little
Giant" and his followers would dwell
constantly on single tax if fusion
should succeed In California.
"If Maguire should be elected- and
after his .election die, oh, heavens and
earth! Hutchinson Governor of this
great commonwealth â think of that as
a possible calamity:"
The roars of laughter responsive to
this sally indicated the opinio.n which
I Republicans of Riverside entertain in
regard to the fusion candidate for
Lieutenant Governor. â¢
The fusion of .political elements in
the cause of Magruireism was t pro
j nouniced "an unholy alliance of office
hunters." Silver Republicans were
implored to return to the party of
Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Harrison and
McKinley. The mention of McKinley's
name was always the signal for great
applause. Barnes was in a happy
mood throughout his eloquent ad
dress. He appreciated the refinement
and intelligence of the Riverside au
dience. He closed his masterly speech
with a tribute to the prosperity, pa
triotism and glory of California, a land
blessed with all the natural conditions
that contribute to the' happiness and
advancement of mankind.
Early to-morrow morning Mr. Gage
and General Barnes leave Riverside
for Los Angeles. The great meeting in
â¢ the chief city of Southern California
to-morrow night will attract thousands
of people from surrounding towns.

NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â "Kid" La
vigne, lightweight*. champion pugilist
of the world, came very near losing his
title to-night at the Greater New York
Athletic Club in a twenty-round bout
with Frank. Erne of Buffalo. Erne
proved a Tartar for the Saginaw boxer
who is not the Lavigne of three years
ago by any means.
Erne's wonderful improvement was a
surprise to the 7000 people who- wit
nessed the fight. He drew Lavigne to
him and sent back as good as he got
in many of the rounds, while in some
of them he outpointed the champion.
It was generally understood that a de
cision was to be given on points, and
the statement made at .the end of the
bout that both men had agreed to call
it a draw in the case that the men- were
good and strong at . the end of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PANA. 111., Sept. 28.â Striking union
coal miners and imported negroes en
gaged in a pitched battle in the main
street of this town to-night. Several
hundred shots were exchanged, no one
was wounded in the ranks of the union,
men. The negroes were driven from
the city to their stockades, carrying
with them, it is believed, a number of
wounded comrades. One of the negroes
is reported to have died soon after
reaching the stockades.
Desultory firing continues at mid*
night in the vicinity of the stockades.
The trouble was precipitated at 8:30
o'clock this evening. As usual, the
negroes from the stockades at the
Springside and Penwell mines were
making demonstrations on Second and.
Locust streets, the principal business
streets of the city, by parading heavily
armed. The union miners were in ses
sion at their hall, where a Chicago
labor leader was speaking.
One of the negroes appeared at the
foot of the miners' hall and engaged In
a quarrel with a union white miner.
Officer Samuel Smith immediately ar
rested the black man and was escortinsr
him to jail, when he was closed in on
by a posse of negroes, who, pointing
their revolvers at Smith, threatened to
kill him if he did not release his pris
oner. Smith continued on his way to
the jail with his prisoner. Union min
ers and others meanwhile went to
Smith's assistance and the negroes
Wf-n driven back. Smith took his
prisoner to Operator George V. Pen
well's residence, and upon Penwell's
standing fur the negro's fine he was
released.
Before Smith had released his pris
oner, however, the negro posse had
been reinforced and assumed a threat
ening attitude toward the white men.
David MeGavic, leader of the union
miners, clubbed one of the blacks on
| the head ' ith a revolver, it is said. For
: half a block MeGavic forced the ne
groes to retreat, and then a few shots
were fired. The negroes retreated
â double quick to their stockades, se
cured . rifles, returned to Locust street
and' challenged the miners to a fight.
The opposing forces lined up on the
street, the negroes with Winchesters
and the miners with shotguns, rifles
I and revolvers. Neighboring business
! houses were immediately closed, lights
extinguished and citizens generally
sought their homes. At the word of
command firing commenced. The first
j volley, it is said, came from the ne-
I groes. The union men responded wim
a volley, and the heavy firing continued
for five minutes. Much of the shooting
\ was wild and entirely harmless to the
j white men, who finally drove the
enemy in full retreat to the stockades.
A second encounter between whites
i and blacks occurred at the mines after
I the first battle near Penwell stockade,
! but the firing was scattered, and it is
not believed to have been a serious
engagement. The miners had full
charge of the business streets at mid
night. Desultory rifle reports could be
I heard from the Penwell and Springside
stockades, but no person would ven
ture into the streets near the mines,
and very few are loitering about the
business or residence sections.
The union miners say the battle to
night is only a foretaste of what may
be expected to follow.
Governor Tanner will be asked to
send the militia to protect property in
this city and remove the negroes.

GOVERNOR SHOT
BY AN INMATE
Attempt to Murder Colonel (3r>
drew J. Smith at Santa
MoQica.
Five Bullets fired Into His Body by a War
Veterao Who fancied t\e Had a
Grievance.
LOS ANGELES, Sept 2S.â Andrew J.
Smith, governor of the Pacific branch
of the National Home for disabled sol
diers, lies at his home at the point of
death with five bullets from the revol
ver of a would-be assassin in his body.
He may live, but three of the bullet
wounds are serious. He is of advanced
age, but he has a strong physique.
The assassin who attempted to take
the life of Governor Smith Is Albert G.
Bradley, a native of Vermont, aged 57.
He served during the "War of the Re
bellion In the Second Vermont Infan
try. He was admitted to the home
first in 1593; was discharged In 1596, and
readmitted in 1897. He has also twice
been an inmate of the State Home for
disabled veterans, located at Yount
ville. There is no question, at least
among those who know him best, aÂ»
to Bradley's sanity. He was a pecu
liarly moody person and had a very
vicious temper, of which he gave fre
quent exhibitions among his comrades.
At &:45 this morning Governor Smith
had just completed his daily Inspec
tion of the quarters and grounds of the
home. Alter he left the guardhouse
he started for the headquarters build
ing to sign some papers. Just as he
wus about to enter the buiidnig from
the rear, Bradley, â who evidently had
lying In ambush for him, passed
bmith ana stepped to one side. As he
did so he drew his revolver and opened
lire upon Governor Smith.
As rapidly as he could he emptied
the five chambers of a 38-caJiber re
volver into Governor Smith's body.
The first two shots were fired almost
together; then there was an interval 'ot
several seconds and the remaining
three shuts -.Â»Â»jre fired.
When the shots were fired the vic
tim was about thirty feet from the
steps of the headquarters building. He
did not fall, but walked on. Major
W. D. Graham and Orderly Pottle at
the Bound of the first shot ran to the
back porch. Graham carried Governor
Smith inside and Pottle secured the
murderer, who was taken to the guard
house.
The home surgeons made an exami
nation and found that one bullet had
passed through Smith's right arm be
tween the ahuuider and elbow; another
d through the right thigh and
came QUt at the groin; a. third entered
the back Just below the shoulder blade.
Two bullets have not been located.
Governor Smith suiTered much pain
during the .entire day and to-night his
]!:'â¢â  hangs in the balance.
As soon as the intelligence of Brad
ley'a awful deed became noised about
the home, the veterans manifested In
tense feeling. Bradley was not popu
lar with any of them. He was always
very bitter against those In authority
and had anarchistic views. After he
had been lodged in the guardhouse
threats of lynching were heard on all
sides. A Santa Monica officer was
called and Bradley was brought to the
County Jail in this city for safe keep-
Ing.
He was seen this evening by The
Call correspondent. He seemed, to re
alize fully the consequences of his act
and appeared to be somewhat repent
ant. All he would say was that he
must have been crazy when he fired
the shots and that he was sorry.
Just after he had unloaded his revol
ver into his victim he talked differently.
He said then that he was sorry he had
not killed him, for that was what he
intended to do.
Bradley's victim was a brigadier gen
eral of volunteers during the civil war.
"When Morgan's threatened raid fright
ened all Northern Ohio General Smith
and his New York brigade were sta
tioned at Johnsons Island, off the city
of Sandusky, to prevent possible release
of Confederate prisoners of war con
fined there. In 1867 he became connected
with National Soldiers' Homes, first
being stationed at the Maine Home. He
was transferred later to Leavenworth.
About two years ago he was placed in
charge here.
Governor Smith had trouble at
Leavonworth with a few inmates,
which was dignified by a Congressional
investigation owing to the bitter op
position and personal ill feeling of
Congressmen R. W. Blue and Case
Broderick of Kansas. He was exon
erated.
Last November The. Call correspond
ent devoted two days to an investiga
tion of the complaints made by some
twenty-five of the 2200 inmates of the
home at Santa Monica. About fifty
veterans were interviewed at random.
Only two had any complaints to make
and they were of the most trivial char
acter. Governor Smith was then seen
and he gave the correspondent carte
blanche to inspect or examine any de*
partment Of the home or ; to interview
any and all inmates if he desired. He
paid that he had issued orders against
pictures bÂ»ing put on the waLls of the
quarters as men sometimes placed vul
gar and obscene photographs and litho
graphs on the walls. He had also re
quir.-tj of the inmates that they at all
tinr-s keep their quarters clean and
neat.
Absolutely nothing could be found
upon which to base a reasonable charge
against Governor Smith. But a Los
Angeles paper opened up Its columns to'
the "kicking" inmates and printed.col
umns <>f matter written by the inmates
about Governor Smith's management,
claiming It wae tyrannical and that he
used autocratic powers. Thers was no
verification of these statements and al
most to a man the inmates exonerated
the governor. Yet the paper referred
to continued to print diatribes against
Smith, giving publicity in that line to
all tiiat was Bent in to it. Some few
veterans finally believed they did have
a grievance and were very bitter
toward Smith. The result was the at
tempted assassination to-day. Smith
did not know Bradtey and had never
reprimanded him. Bradley had never
been in the guardhouse.
Smith will not die to-night. His
greatest danger is from blood poison
ing.
GOVERNOR SMITH'S
PREVIOUS TROUBLES
" LEAVENWORTH, Kas., Sept. 28.â
Governor Smith was in charge of the
National Home at Leavenworth for
many years. Early on the morning of
June 11, 1897, his residence on tho
home groiinds at Leavenworth was
wrecked by dynamite. The Governor,
bis wlfo and daughter, were In the
house, but escaped with minor Injuries.
The crime was traced to a veteran, Jo
seph W. Oliver, a member of the home,
and he was convicted.
.Governor Smith's administration at
the Leavenworth hc-me was marked by
many troubles. Through the efforts of
Richard W. Blue, then a member of
Congress from Kansas, the management
of the home was investigated by
a committee from the House of Rep
resentatives. Many charges were pre
ferred, against Governor Smith, but the
investigation resulted in no more than
his transfer to the. governorship of the
Pacific branch, where he was wounded
to-day.
The charges acrainst Governor Smith
that led to the investigation were prin
cipally mistreatment of the old soldiers.
It was said that he confined riien in the
insane wards of the hospital without
previous, examination by the surgeon;
that he maintained a police system
cruel in the extreme, and that he forced
men to taite the gold treatment for
drunkenness against their will: Colonel
Sidney G. Cooke of Herrington, . Kas.,
the local manager, testified that he had
ordered Governor Smith to discharge
brutal police-officers and to cease the
system of forcing the soldiers to take
the cure for drunkenness. The order,
lw said, had been disobeyed. Later
Colonel Cooke stated that he had in
vestigated some complaints made by
pensioners that their pensions had been
withheld from them by order of the
Governor and against the law. He had
ordered this to cease and had been
obeyed. An investigation of this had
also been made by ex-Governor Glick,
Pension Commissioner. Governor Smith
had been let off with a reprimand. Fur
ther charges against the governing of
the Soldiers' Home were made that he
had abused and insulted officers und?r
him, had caused men carried on Gov
ernment dÂ«v rolls to do chores about,
his house and had turned Government
property aver to his. own private use.
Before becoming governor of the
Leavenworth Home. Smith was for
three years treasurer of the National
Soldiers' Home at To-gas, Me. Charges
preferred against him th*Â»re by the gov
ernor of that home led to his transfer
in ISSS to Leavenworth.

DIVERS FIND A CLEW
TO BROOKS' MURDERER
SAUSALITO, Sept. 28.â An important clew that may lead to the detection
of the man or men who murdered Captain J. Moss Brooks on the yacht
Chispa last Friday night came into the possession of the county author
ities to-day. It was a coat found by a diver at the bottom of the bay dl-
rectly under the yacht. In the pockets of this garment two letters were
discovered. That these missives are of the greatest importance and that
they have given the authorities a fair idea as to the identity of the assassin
appears certain. The letters were read by District Attorney Ivlartinelli and
Sheriff Harrison In private. After th- reading there was a long conference,
at which plans to be pursued in view of the discovery were formulated.
The officials carefully guarded their find and absolutely refused to give
the slightest information regarding its. bearing on the case. In fact so great
was their reticence that it gave the impression that they believe the mys
?--v of the murder Is effectually cleared and that through the medium of
the coat and the letters it contained the murderer of the old yachtsman
\ v- i 1 1 soon be brought to justice.
Last night the Board of Town Trustees held a special meeting and by
resolution called upon Sheriff. Harrison and District Attorney Martinelli to
employ a diver on behalf of the county and see if anything could be found
tending to prove the identity of the murderers. . Prior to this Vrustee- Sylva
had- a conference with the officials. The result was that the services of a
San Francisco diver named Roach were engaged and at 1 o'clock this after
noon he was on hand with a number of assistants to begin work.
The bottom of the bay for about fifty feet around the boat was thor
oughly explored. The bottom proved to.be fairly hard, with only a thin
deposit of mud. Nothing of importance besides the coat was found.
To-morrow the diver will continue his work, and the authorities are san
guine that further clews will be found.
The remains of Captain Brooks were interred i-n the Sausallto Cemtery
this afternoon. The funeral was held under the auspices of the Ancient
Order of Foresters and a large cortege proceeded to the place of interment.

of the traditions of Alaska. It is fabu
lously rich. Men have hunted in vain
for it for nearly twenty-eight years.
There is an old miner and frontier
practitioner here, Loc Mulcahy, who
now keeps a beer saloon with kegs ar
rayed around the end of the place like
the muzzles of the 12-inch guns off
Santiago de Cuba harbor, who has gone
broke three times in trying to find it.
Not an old miner in Alaska but has
heard about it. Many more would have
s' -rted out for it if they had known in
what direction to take or make a trail.
The story of the "Lost Rocker," re
duced to daily newsparer length, is as
follows: Not a mining State, Territory
Oi district is there that has not had its
"Lost Cabin," "Lost Mountain," "Lost
Trail," or lost something-else mine.
1..1s is Alaska's and It is peculiarly
Alaskan:
In the spring of 1874 two miners left
Sltka on a prospecting expedition. They
took a course to the southeast, intending
to look at some creeks on the islands
lying on their route before touching
the mainland. They prospected the
mouths of several creeks on Baranoff,
Chichagoff and Admiralty islands, three
of the largest islands in the Southeast
ern Alaska archipelago, and finding no
indications worthy of further explora
tion there pulled down Chatham Straits
and then across toward the mainland.
Tl.ere, being overtaken by a storm,
they were driven ashore in their small
boat at the mouth of a large creek.
After having made camp in a protected
nook . they looked about them. They
noticed that the bed of the creek was
strewn with quartz. Next morning they
set to work panning out the gravel of
the stream and were elated at finding
it would pay. But as the gold was very
fine they supposed that by following up
the stream they would find it in coarser
quantities. Caching all their supplies
except the small portion needed for a
short trip into the Interior they started
up the creek. Two days' travel over
bowlders and- through underbrush
brought them to the crest of a divide.
Below a short distance in a basin lay
a beautiful little lake. A small stream
was geen emptying into it from the
west- and another stream llowing out
of it to the north was its outlet. The
prospectors descended and camped that
night on the margin of the lake. Again
they found gold. " it was in the gravel
Of the feeder running in- from the west.
Here was their fortune.- As they pros
pected this stream they found that
every panful of gravel yielded half a
spoonful of coarse gold, and some nug
gets were found weighing as much. as
an ounce. The little stream was fed by
glaciers and snow banks above. No
time was lost in making a rocker arid
the two gold-hunters were soon rock
ing out a golden stream as grain flows
out of a hopper. . They worked indus
triously for two weeks and must have
had several hundred- thousand dollars'
worth of dust and nuggets. Occasional
trips were made to the cache at the
beach near the mouth of the creek for
supplies without a single thought of.
danger.
At noon one day, as' they were, leav
ing work to prepare dinner, they were
tired upon by Indians. These Indians
have- always been thought to be either
Sticks or Chilkats, the two fiercest
tribes in Southeastern Alaska. The
Sticks or' Thinklets inhabit the interior
from the Lake Teslin basin to the coast
range of mountains. Apparently the
Indians were after the provisions aiid
other supplies, and not the gold:
One of the miners was killed instant
ly. . The other, uninjured, sprang into
the woods and was out of sight before
a second volley could be fired. Cut
off from the camp by the lake, he made
haste ..to the canoe and remainder of
the cache near the beach. He hastily
re-embarked with a quantity of pro
visions, intending to go back to Sitka
and return to the diggings with a large
party. But he lost his bearings, as
the sky in Alaska Is often obscure by
fogs for days at a time. Instead of
pulling for Sitka he took a southerly
course toward Victoria. He was picked
up by a passing ship and finally land
ed at Port Townsend. He had about
$1500 in nuggets in his pockets.
The next spring he returned to Sitka
and made up a party to return with
him to the bonanza by the lake. -At
this point the story becomes slightly
confused, for it is known to be a fact
that a party did leave Victoria in the
spring of 1875, in search of a lost Alaska
mine. . When the party arrived at a
poiht below Taku Inlet, about where
the settlement of Shuck Is now located,
the miner pointed it out as the place
where he and his partner had landed
and cached their stuff a year before.
Finding no big pay on the first creek,
as the guide thought there was, the
party became enraged and threatened
to hang him to the main boom of the
ichooner, for quite an expedition had
been fitted out. It seems- that the
miner and guide had not yet mentioned
the bonanza by the lake for reasons of
his own. Not fearing the gibbet after
the threat he kept the secret to him
self, and the party sailed to Sitka
empty handed.
Scarcely a season has since come that
some prospector has not started out in
hopes of finding the "Lost Rocker"
mine. Rewards have been offered the
natives up and down the coast to re
veal the place, but probably through
fear of being implicated and punished
for the murder they profess to know
nothing'about it.
Jenka is said to have made a map of
his trail to the place, -so he may be cer
tain of finding his way back. He Is
the only man who has introduced a
cabin into the story. If he has found
the place he has doubtless staked all
the ground the law allows. He mys
teriously describes the location as be
tween Lake Teslin and Lake Atlln.
CORBETT DISABLED
IN A BRIEF CLASH
WITH "KID" McCOY
Exciting Argument in Which Fists
and Feet Play an Important
Part.
Ex-Champion Lands on the Younger Man's
Countenance and Receives a Kick in
Return.
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â Without the
customary formalities of padded gloves
and the roped arena, two distinguished
aspirants for the heavyweight cham
pionship met to-day in a preliminary
engagement. For one brief, thrilling
round, James J. Corbett and Charles
McCoy, better known as "Kid," de
lighted the bell boys and shocked the
clo-iks of the Gilsey House, and then
went their ways, breathing threaten
ings and slaughter. Championship
honors are still in abeyance.-
Corbett took breakfast in the cafe of
the Gilsey House with George F. Consi
dine, his manager. The meal. was fin
ished about a quarter after 8 o'clock
and the men strolled into the wide cor
ridors. Corbett stepped up to the. cigar
stand and lighted. a. cigar. As he turn
ed away, Considine noticed that his
face bore a smile of deep contempt.
Only one thing could call up that ex
pression â McCoy had just entered, the
hotel with W. B. Gray, a man named
Nugent and several other friends.
The bell boy with a pitcher stopped
in his mad career toward the elevator
.and trembled with joyful anticipation
uinil the ice rattled. McCoys forces
advanced in good order and deployed
around Corbett and Considine. The ci
gar man leaned over the counter and
patrons on plush seals forgot their pa
pers. The brows of the gentlemen pu
gilists were terrible to look upon.
There was- a conversation between
Corbett and Gray, who is interested in !
the Hawthorne Club, where- Corbett
and McCoy' are billed to tight on Octo
ber lv. .Corbett set forth with great
emphasis his views or" the sincerity,
finances and repute of the organization,
the same, as might be expected, being
a tender subject with Mr. Gray. The
conversation became an argument and
then a dispute.
"You dqn't want to fight McCoy,"
declared Gray, finally, and the young
man named permitted himself to sneer
effectually.
"You're a nice looking .monkey," said
Corbett, following the approved rules
of etiquette laid down for gentlemen
pugilists.
It may never be known whether the
"Kid" took offense at the -word "mon
key ' or me apparently ironical asser
tion that he was "nice 10-oking." ' But
his ' feelings were deeply hurt. He
lunged forward and smote the $4 derby
of Mr. Corbett so th.at it was jammed
down oh his forehead.
McCoy's arm was still' outstretched
when something hit him under' the
right eye. This was Corbett's fist. .;
"I'll tight him here or anywhere," said
Corbett, continuing the conversation.
The patrons and hotel attaches
crowded around him, begging him . to
spare the reputation of the house. Mr;
McCoy, however, was determined to
prove his gentility. He swung his foot
gracefully and with force and landed it
against Corbett's frame.
"I ain't no monkey!'" he shouted.
The peacemakers renewed their ef
forts and the crowd surged about the
lobby. . Henry Gilsey, owner of the
house, rushed up.
"Do you know what you men are' do
ing?" he. cried to Corbett. "You're wel
come here, but this row must stop."
".Out of consideration for you," said
Corhett, "I will .leave the hotel."
McCoy and his friends had disap
peared, by this time, and Corbett and
Considine went to' the latte'r's place,
leaving the witnesses of the encounter
to discuss it with varying emotions.
Corbett was in bed when I saw him
an hour later at Co-nsidine's. The doc
tor had bandaged a bruise which he
said was made by McCoy's kick. Ac
cording to'.Dr; Pettlngill, who attended
Corbett, it will be a day or two before
the injured pugilist will be able to
move about with comfort.
Corbett, when asked about the affair,
said:
"McCoy kicked me and the imprint
of his shoe appears on my body. It
was a cowardly act and shows that Mc-
Coy has no desire to meet me in the
ring with all things equal. McCoy
attacked me, and I, .wishing to act the
part of a gentleman, made no attempt
to defend myself until too late.
"The whole trouble started over my
discovery of the deception of McCoy,
Gray and the Buffalo Athletic Club
over McCoy's forfeit money of $2500.
When the articles of agreement be
tween McCoy and myself, were signed, I
posted "5-2500 forfeit money with Al
Smith and supposed that McCoy had
done likewise. When I asked Mr.
Smith if he would turn over to me Mc-
Coy's forfeit money in the event of the
'Kid' flunking out of the Buffalo match
he amazed me by saying he had no
money belonging to McCoy. Smith
said he, however, had a letter alleged
to have been written by the president
of the Hawthorne Athletic Club, in
which he stated that his organization
would be responsible for McCoy's for
feit. I referred the letter to Nugent,
manager of the Hawthorne, who was
present, and he said that the officials
of the club had never authorized the
issuance of the letter in question, and
that made me mad clean through, and
I gave Gray and McCoy my opinion of
men who would practice . such under
hand methods. Then Gray spoke up
and said:
" 'You are afraid to fight and are try
ing to crawl.'
"I replied that I would fight McCoy
in any part of the worldâ right there
if necessary.- Then out shot the Kid's
left hand leg, and here I am."
McCoy gave an entirely different ver
sion of the clash and the causes
thereof.
"Gorbett," said McCoy, "was looking
for trouble and I reckon that he got
more than he bargained for. He started
things moving for a fight by insulting
Gray and myself. He called me . a
monkey and said that I was afraid to
meet him in the ring. I told him that
in view of the fact that our match was
scheduled to take place in Buffalo on
October 15 his remarks were a trifle
premature, and I accused him of try
ing to break his match with me so that
he could arrange a contest with some
other pugilist less dangerous than my
self. He swore and cursed me roundly,
but. wishing to avoid a scene, I con
trolled myself until he said:
" *I will fight you right here If you
think I fear you.'
"Then he made a menacing move
with his left hand. Believing that my
welfare was in danger I promptly let
fly my left and smashed him good and
hard on the head and face.
"Then George Considine, Corbett's
manager, and several others grabbed
me," continued the "Kid," "and Cor
bett started for me. Being helpless I
crossed my arms over my face and
met- Corbett's rush with my knee.
Then it was all over. I was too quick
for Corbett with my left at the begin
ning and spoiled the fine grand-stand
play he had planned. He tried to in
timidate me by making wild cracks
and impugning my courage, but I guess
he knows by this time that I can take
care of myself in any kind of company.'
Corbett thought to scare Fitzslmmons
the same way In Green's Hotel in
Philadelphia when going to the match
in Carson City, but it didn't work and
it doesn't go with me. Corbett will tlnd
.out some day, if he hasn't done so al
ready, that there is only one place for
a pugilist to win battles and that is in
the prize ring."
â¢ â It is the general opinion in sporting
circles that the Buffalo Club will be
unable to pull the match ofT and that
Corbett and McCoy will not again get
as near to a fight as they did to-day
in the Gilsey House.
LITTLE ROMANCE
OF THE KLONDIKE
Return of a Miner With Gold Fol-
lowed by His Remarriage to
a Divorced Wife.
MACOX, Mo., Sept. 28.â A romance of
the .Klondike was revealed here to-day in
the office of the County Clerk. About a
year ago M. B. Ayers, a . prosperous
stock man, sold out his holding's here and
went to the gold fields,- despite the pro
tests of his wife.
Mrs. Ayers, who is young and good
looking, became convinced, that she would
never see her husband again and she at
once applied for a divorce. In March last
a decree was granted on her plea of aban
donment. .
When Mr. Avers returned from the gold
fields last week he brought $20,000 In gold
dust, his profits in a deal in a mining
claim near Dawson. But instead of find
ing a yearning wife awaiting him. he was
confronted by her decree of divorce. The
Klondiker would not be put off, however,
sought out his ex-wife, showed her the
color of his gold dust,, insisted that his
intentions had always been right, and as
an outcome a license was issued to-day
for the remarriage of the divorced couple.

RECONCENTRADOS
HAVE ALL GONE
God Only Knows Where,
Says Congosto.
UNFORTUNATES ARE DEAD
SMILING STATEMENT OF THE
SPANISH OFFICIAL.
The Colonial Secretary Reaches New
York anL Talks of the Condi
tion of Affair- in
Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call. '
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â Amongf thÂ«
passengers who arrived to-day on the
steamer City of Washington from Ha
vana were Dr. Jose Congosto, Colonial
Secretary of Cuba, and Captain Fred
Sharp, the latter of the Merritt &
Chapman Wrecking Company.
Dr. Congosto was asked as to the
condition of the reconcentrados.
"There are no reconcentrados now,"
he answered with a smile.
"What has become of them?" was
the next question.
"Tliey're gone."
"Where?"
"God knows," was the reply.
"Do you mean to say that they are
all dead?"
"That probably explains It better
than I can. It is a subject which I pre
fer not to disouss."
When asked as to the establishment
of anew navy for Spain, Dr. Congosto
said:
"Spain is still a great country and
she ought to have a great navyâ and
probably will have."
Regarding the fall of Santiago and
the surrender of General Toral, Dr.
Congosto said:
"There were brave soldiers at-Santi
ago, and if their leader lacked courage
he deserves to be punished. Santiago
should not have fallen as it did, and if
Toral had not entered into negotiations
with the enemy, it is likely that there
would have been a different story to
tell to-day.
"It is not true that the Spanish army
there lacked supplies and ammunition,
for they had plenty of both, which they
turned over to the Americans. If Toral
had pushed forward, instead of retreat
ing toward the city, he certainly would
have caused a repulse. These are things
which he will have to explain.
"The evacuation of Cuba by Spain is
a matter of time, but when I left Ha
vana everything was progressing well.
I do not care to enter into all the rea
sons for the delay, but one of the prin
cipal causes is the fact that we have
over 6000 sick, who must be taken care
of and cannot be left behind.
"The problem of the future of the
island is a difficult one. I have studied
it without prejudice,, and, as a result of
this study of years, I believe that it
is a social problem and not a political
one. Of course, politics will enter into
the solution, but the main question is,
how to bring the most prosperity and
the greatest hapi mess to the people of
Cuba. It is probable that there will be
a large emigration to the island, and
this emigration may assist in solving
the problem. Of course a difficulty will
be met in view of the dangers of fever
and the climate."
Captain Sharp was greatly pleased to
learn that the Spanish cruiser Maria
Teresa had been floated and taken to
Guantanamo. He thinks the collier
Merrimac, sunk in Santiago harbor, can
be saved.
Ventor yon Hollenstein, an American
citizen and a member of the German
Red Cross Society, who had been in
prison for several months in Havana,
charged with, complicity in the insur
rection of the Cubans, was also among
the passengers of the City of Washing
ton. He was released during the first
part of this month. He is crippled and
sick from the harsh treatment he re
ceived.

CHARLES L. PATTON FOR MfIYOR.
THAT in nominating Charles L. Patton for
Mayor the Republicans have done the wisest
thing possible there will be no question. That
Mr. Patton is the strongest man who could have
been named events have made clear. That he will be
the next Mayor of San Francisco the party has con
fidence.
The nominee of the Republicans is a man against
whom nothing can be said. He is a high type of the
young, vigorous, progressive American. Enjoying
an excellent practice at law, having standing in the
social and commercial world, he has never before
entered into politics beyond the exercise of his rights
as a private citizen. He only enters now at the
earnest solicitation of the party whose principles he
upholds, in whose policy he firmly believes.
His handling of his extensive business shows him
to have a fine executive mind. The multitude of his
friends demonstrates that he has the qualities of a
leader. Even his personal appearance is in his
favor. Physically much above the average, he has
an excellent presence, a dignified bearing. He im
presses on sight and improves on acquaintance. That
he has heretofore kept out of municipal affairs is a
distinct advantage to him. He is not entangled with
any faction, nor can he be accused of having a boss
or of being one. He is simply a citizen who has at
heart the welfare of the community where he has ac
quired substantial interests, who consents, at the soli
citation of those who, knowing him best, best know
his worth, to .stand publicly for that which he has
sustained in private. He is not ambitious. The
honor of nomination came unsought. At first he
shrank from the responsibility, but when convinced
that none other could so well perform the required
duty he laid aside his objections. The Republicans
recognized in him the man of the hour.
The campaign in which Patton is now a central
figure will be waged for victory. His success will
mean much for San Francisco. The city needs a
man, big and broad intellectually, unwarped by per
sonal ambitions, above intrigue, honest, honorable
and energetic. Charles L. Patton is such a man.
FRfIUD AT THE FERRY.
THERE is sometimes a decent pleasure in say
ing "I told you so." This can only be the case
when the allegation is a fact.
Months ago this paper became convinced that the
erection of the ferry building, from street level to
the top of the tower, was a process colored by fraud.
An investigation was made., carefully, laboriously and
without passion. It proved that the suspicion was
well grounded, that the officials who had been en
trusted with the important work had proved careless
or deliberately unfaithful, that they had betrayed the
taxpayers, and that they had connived with unscru
pulous contractors to skimp the work, ignore speci
fications and to pay for inferior material and work
manship more than should have been paid for first
class.
There is no need now to analyze the iniquity then
laid bare. The files of The Call set it forth in elab
orate detail. The report of the Grand Jury contains
it in a condensed form. The swindling began when
cheap stone was used at the price of a superior or
at least more expensive article. It continued in every
department. When pine was substituted for oak the
contractors were actually permitted to charge more
than they had agreed to accept for the oak, although
by the scheme they saved to themselves thousands of
dollars. When a floor costing thousands less than
the one the contractor had given bond to put in was
adopted by the Harbor Commissioners, not one cent
was raved to the State. Contractors got it all. If
they divided with their friends the matter is yet one
of suspicion merely. There was fraud in every de
partment above the foundation. Specifications were
ignored, and extra paid for changes on which the
State should have had a substantial rebate.
The collated facts were put into the hands of one
Grand Jury, but while it dallied with them it was
dismissed for an incompetency which had become
painfully evident. The present Grand Jury is dif
ferent. It realizes and frankly makes declaration that
the public has been robbed. No indictment has been
returned, this being explained by a lack of knowledge
on the part of the jury as to its rights. Neverthe
less the jobbers, whom The Call made uncomfort
able, -have again been held up to scorn. This is cer
tainly better than that they should have been passed

THE CfJNVASS IN THE SOUTH-
REPORTS from the southern part of the State,
where the candidates of both parties for the
governorship are making a personal canvass
from the stump, are highly encouraging to Repub
licans. The meetings of both are well attended, for
Maguire draws well as an orator, and people are
curious to hear the single-taxer; but there is at the
Republican meetings a spirit of earnestness and en
thusiasm which shows that the audiences have not
been moved to attend by curiosity merely. Th~ great
mass of voters in the assemblies that meet to listen to
Gage and to Barnes are there to greet the next Gov
ernor of California and to evince their approval and
give their support to the policies and principles of the
Republican party.
As the Republican candidate for Governor lives
in the south and is well known and highly esteemed
in that section of the State, his personal popularity
is unquestionably a potent factor in arousing the
earnestness and the enthusiasm of the Republicans
there. That factor, however, it s clear, is not the
only one, nor even t"he dominant one, in the canvass.
A multitude of evidences show that a Republican re-
I vival has taken place in the southern counties, and
that the falling off from the normal party strength in
the campaign of 1896 will be more than made up this
I year. The fallacies of the free silver agitation of two
j years ago have been exposed in the radiant light of
I the prosperity which has followed the election of Mc-
Kinley, and many who were deceived in the former
canvass have their eyes open now.
Nor is it only by the return to the Republican ranks
of the wayward free silver men who followed the
Bryanite movement that the canvass thus far has
shown an increasing Republican strength in the
southern counties. A considerable number of stal
wart Democrats and earnest Populists have been led
by the excellence of the Republican ticket and the
soundness of the party platform to bolt the fusion
ticket and confusion platforms. Many of these may
perhaps refrain from voting at all, but a considerable
number have announced a determination to vote with
the Republicans. Among these are men who have
â¢ had no little power in their former parties, and it is
certain their course will be followed by others among
whom they have influence and leadership.
The Call has published interviews with a number
of these earnest men, who refuse to sanction the bar
gain and sale, the swapping and swiping, of fusion
politics, and who have resolved to vote the Repub
lican ticket this fall. Their statements show the ex
tent to which the political consciences and common
sense of sincere men revolt against Maguireism and
the tactics by which the leaders of that movement
have obtained control of the machinery of both the
Democratic and the Populist parties. The sentiment
of all these men was well expressed by A. A. Dunn,
editor of the Escondido Times, who in a statement
to a Call correspondent said: "A game
is being played upon the Populist pa â /, and I do not
propose to have it played upon me. The best way
to secure the reforms we are seeking is to defeat Ma
guire and the fusion combination."
A canvass which has accomplished such good re
sults thus early in the campaign is certainly one of
encouragement to all loyal Republicans. The inde
pendent and the doubtful voters are being rapidly
convinced that the welfare of the State and the pro
motion of all needed political reforms can be best
provided by the election of the Republican ticket.
Much of this success has been due to the direct and
manly canvass of Mr. Gage, and justifies the predic
tion made by The Call that the results would prove
the Republican champion to be a better campaigner
than Maguire, as well as better fitted to be Governor.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
I IOF some time past it has been universally re
â  cognized that Theodore Roosevelt is the logical
*â  Republican candidate for Governor of New
York this year, and his nomination for the office will
be accepted as another proof that Republicans al
ways know the right thing to do at the right time
and how to select the right man to do it.
The conditions of politics in New York are such
that a renomination of Governor Black wou'd have
been a mistake. He has been an excellent chief
magistrate and his record is one for which the party
will not have to make either apologies or explana
tions during the campaign. It happened, however,
that, without fault on his part, dissensions arose
among the Republicans of the State, and for the pur
pose of allaying these it was necessary to choose a
new leader. In Roosevelt's personality all the at
tributes of an ideal leader for the occasion were
found, and to him the rank and file as well as the
leaders of the party turned with the spontaneity of
an instinctive recognition that the man and the op
portunity had met.
While the achievements of Roosevelt in raising
and commanding the famous regiment of Rough
Riders during the war added to his fame and in
creased his personal popularity, it is not to them he
owes this promotion to the leadership of his party
.in the Empire State and the nomination which is
virtually equivalent to election to the office of Gov
ernor. His military service, while brilliant, con
stitutes but an episode in his distinguished career.
In fact, he owed his opportunity in war to what he
had achieved in civil affairs. Had he not already
proven in public service his force of character and
shown an ability to perform difficult duties with an
easy mastery, he would never have obtained a chance
to demonstrate at the head of his Rough Riders his
valor as a soldier and his skill as a commander of
irregular troops.
Fifteen years of public service has revealed to the
people of New York the eminent fitness of Roose
velt for the office to which he has been nominated.
He has been tried in many ways and has been al
ways found worthy of promotion to higher duties.
No man in politics has ever been more independent,
and yet he has never been a mugwump. His par
tisanship has been as stalwart as his statesmanship,
and neither has ever been subservient to a boss, a
clique or to any consideration other than that of the
public good. He now takes the first step in a career
of the highest political activity. He will never here
after be called upon to serve as Police Commissioner
or Assistant Secretary in any department of the Gov
ernment. From this time forth he ranks among the
statesmen of the country to whom the people look
for successors to the Presidency.
Professor Crookes of the British Museum, when he
declares that the world's supply of food is in danger of
giving out, is simply making a bid to be placed on ex
hibition as one of the freaks of the institution to which
he now lends the illumination of his intelligence.
Germany seems to have offered to help Aguinaldo,
and if Dewey had only kept out of the way and
American troops had refrained from landing, might
have done so.

THE SA!N FSANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1898.
IT will be difficult for Mayor Phelan's admirers to
much longer deny that he is fast becoming a po
litical boss of the most offensive description. If
he keep on in the course he is now pursuing it can
not be very long before it will only be necessary for
him to open a saloon to organize a gang of rock
rollers in order to attain to the position occupied in
the politics of this city for so many years by Chris
Buckley. Up to. date his methods have been less
studied and the results he has produced less popular
than any ever adopted or produced by the late
master of the local Democracy.
Probably the Mayor is not entirely responsible for
the existence of the Committee of One Hundred, but
notwithstanding the inflexible character of that body
he has managed to get out of it about all it has had
to give. The nominees for Assessor, Sheriff, Count/
Clerk, Auditor and Public Administrator are known
to be his personal friends. If elected they will give
him the bulk of their patronage. This is all Buckley
would have asked of them, and they could have ac
cepted nominations from him for the same offices
without any greater loss of self-respect.
Moreover, by a nominating trick the Mayor has
captured the Board of Election Commissioners, and
at the coming election he will not only control the
ballot-boxes, but also the canvass. He is himself an
Electipn Commissioner, and through the Gallagher-
Maguire influence he will dictate the course of City
and County Attorney Gallagher! He has renomi
nated Tax Collector Block, and in this way has se
cured the favor of a man who can give him control
of the commission. This is not exactly clever; any
political boss might have seen and utilized the same
point. But it shows that Phelan is a boss and that
he is struggling to secure what is necessary for the
success of every political boss, namely, control jof the
machinery of elections and the patronage of the
offices.
It is said that the Mayor named the Board of
Supervisors nominated by the Committee of One
Hundred last evening. If this be true he will, should
his Supervisors be elected, become master of the
city government. Through the patronage offices he
will manipulate the Democratic machine, and through
the Supervisors he will control the tax levy, fix water
rates, let gas contracts and handle the legislation of
the municipality. In other words, he will hold ex
actly the same position in politics held by Boss
Buckley in that individual's halcyon days/except that
he will be a part of the machine himself.
Perhaps Mayor Phelan can bring the campaign he
is planning to a successful issue, but if he can the
people of San Francisco will no longer be entitled to
the designation of boss-haters. The Democratic
ticket nominated by the Committee of One Hundred
is not even the creation of a popular primary. On
the contrary, it is the creation of a small ring of
office-brokers, who have selected the Mayor as their
boss, and who, with the aid oj Deacon Fitch's Non-
Partisans, hope to secure control of the government
of the city. If such a conspiracy against popular
government can succeed on the lines th~.se men have
chosen, we shall, indeed, have discovered another
wonder of the world.
THE State Highway Commissioners are reported
to have drafted a bill which they think will find
favor with the coming Legislature and result in
establishing a comprehensive and satisfactory system
of highway improvement and maintenance through
out the State.
According: to the reports the plan provides that
one-half of all moneys collected in the counties for
road improvements be placed in a separate fund, to
be expended on roads indicated as State highways,
the contracts for the work to be let by the Super
visors on plans and specifications to be approved by
the Commissioners. The Legislature will also be
urged to pass a bill to the effect that when any county
completes five miles of road in accordance with the
proposed amendment the same shall on petition to the
Highway Commission and with the approval of the
Governor be accepted by the State as a State high
way and maintained as such.
Whether the plan as outlined will be acceptable
to the Legislature is questionable, for there is cer
tain to be a strong opposition to it. It is to be hÂ»ped,
however, that, should it be rejected, some means will
be devised by which the work of roadway improve
ment in the State can be undertaken systematically
and carried on continuously until our highways are
equal to the needs of the traffic that passes over them.
At the present time, in the greater part of the State,
the highways are far below the general level of our
civilization. In the cultivation of the soil, in the
schools, churches, houses and mode of living, the
residents of the rural districts of California are
abreast of those of the foremost nations of the world,
but in the matter of roads most of our country dis
tricts are hardly better off than backwoods settle
ments.
If we had only a backwoods civilization to maintain
we could get along with bad roads. Our energy in
all forms of industrial life, however, compels an in
cessant use of roadways, and as a consequence the
lack of well graded, well ballasted and carefully
maintained highways entails a heavy cost upon the
community. No good road is ever so costly as a
bad road in a district where there is much traffic
going on. It is that fact which renders highway im
provement an imperative necessity of the situation.
As some of our counties, such as Santa Clara, have
most excellent highways of their own, built up and
maintained under local supervision, they are averse
to State action in the matter, partly because they
fear they might be compelled to contribute something
in the way of revenues to the improvement of roads
elsewhere. This and other forms of local self-interest
have prevented the progress that might otherwise
have been made by this time in the accomplishment
of road improvement. The present law, moreover,
hi", been found defective in some important respects.
The proposed bill now under consideration by the
Highway Commission, it is to be hoped, will prove
satisfactory in every way. The urgency of road work
is not to be disputed, and we cannot too early adopt
a comprehensive system for. carrying it on.
The arrest of a Santa Maria attorney on the charge
of subornation of perjury is a serious and peculiar
matter. He is accused of having hired a character
less woman to swear away the character of a man
against whom action for divorce had been instituted.
There can never be palliation for perjury, and in a
divorce suit there is seldom any excuse for it. To
get the matrimonial bond severed one party or the
other has usually only to express the conviction that
the bonds have become irksome.
When Dr. de Freye died abroad leaving no visible
heirs to a considerable fortune, a fear arose that none
would appear. The fear is groundless. There will be
heirs to burn, and most of them will probably deserve
the process.
Affairs have progressed far enough to show that
Dreyfus may receive justice if France can't prevent it.
PMELAN &S c BOSS.
HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT.
NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MAGUIRE.
How and Whu He Turned His Back on the Democ
racy in 1887,
In 1887 Judge Maguire formally and forever withdrew from the Demo
cratic party, State and national. His reasons were given in the following
letter:
[From the San Francisco Bulletin, Friday, January 28, 1887.]
JUDGE MAGUIRE ABANDONS THE DEMOCRACY.
Boodle and Bossism Too Much for Himâ Socialism of a Certain Sort More
Suitable to His Fancy, Etc.
The following letter from Judge Maguire to the California State Demo
k .-atic Club may create something: of a political breeze:
SAN FRANCISCO, January 27, 1887.
To the Officers and Members of the California State Democratic Club-
Gentlemen: I hereby tender my resignation as a member of your club.
In withdrawing permit me to return thanks to the officers, past and
present, for many courtesies which they have extended during our long and
pleasant association.
Let me also assure the members, with whom my relations have always
been most cordial, that my withdrawal is not prompted by any personal con
siderations, but that it is to me a painful act of duty to political principles
and convictions with which the present policy of the Democratic party is
not in accord.
As this resignation is the final act which severs my connection with the
Democratic party, State and national, it is but just to you, and to all others
who have stood shoulder to sho.-.lder with me in the political battles of the
past, that I should fully and frankly state the reasons which have moved
me to tuis serious step.
Early in life I learned to reverence the name Democracy, as represent
ing all that is sublime in the political history of past ages and as connecting
the best of political principles.
The party bearing this sacred name being out of pcwer at the time I
reached my majority I naturally entered its ranks, hoping and expecting
that It would ever be the aggressive and intelligent champion of liberty,
equality and justice, wherever and whenever these vital priaciples of social
happiness might be either neglected or assailed.
Finally our party triumphed, but alas! It has brought no relief to our
suffering people. The benefit of that triumph has amounted to no more
than the distribution of a few official prizes to the friends arid relatives of
wealthy aristocrats and to the henchmen of political bosses. There are, of
course, exceptions, but this has been the rule.
Wealth is still the standard of respectability, just as it was under Re
publican administrations, and the rights and wishes of the great Demo
cratic masses of the country are just as completely ignored.
Rival bidders for the affection of monopolists, the great national parties
have become like two peas, both in actions and principles.
The great intellectual statesmen, the men of principle and courage, once
the glory of our country, have been retired from our Federal Senate, and the
people have practically ceased to be represented there. The chamber
which once held that highest body of earthly legislators is now a sort of
national stock exchange, wherein seats are sold to monopolists and to
wealthy seekers after social standing. In the matter of sanctioning this
iniquity honors seem to be easy between the parties.
The entire solid area of our great country, including the natural oppor
tunities of all our people, the natural resources without which none of our
people can live, has been made the exclusive private property of a few
thousand alien and domestic landlords, who, by virtue of the absolute con
trol which they do thus, as owners, exercise over the only means of living of
our landless millions, are robbing the latter continually of from one-half to
four-fifths of the fruits of their labor, and are daily driving them to lower
and lower depths of slavery and helpless misery.
This is a system of human servitude just as complete as chattel slavery,
and in many respects more atrocious; yet the so-called "Democratic party,"
while claiming to be the friend of the laborer, expressly defends this system
and bids for the support of those who profit by it. But these are not the
only matters in which the party has been recreant. In the late Democratic
State convention ah emissary of certain railroad corporations, who acted as
a carrier of messages between his masters and the committee on platform,
caused that committee to eliminate a resolution condemning the election of
the president of the Central Pacific Railroad Company to the United States
Senate, and also caused the committee to eliminate Senator Reddy's resolu
tion upon the Chinese question, which, prior to his appearance, had been
adopted. The railroad emissary received as his reward for this successful
service a Democratic nomination for Congress. It is but just, in defense of
the people, that I should add he was not elected.
I will not recount the painful history nor dwell upon the deplorable con
dition of our local Democracy. It is difficult to speak of this branch of the
party in the language of polite correspondence. Let it here suffice to say
that our local Democracy is under the acknowledged dominion of a man
who has been publicly charged with having openly and notoriously pur
chased votes on last election day. This charge has been strongly sup
ported by the sworn and recorded testimony of several citizens; yet, al
though this crime against the elective franchise is a blow at the very heart
of our liberty, a crime more dreadful in its consequences than murder or
open treason, no citizen has -yet manifested sufficient confidence in the
Democratic officers who are charged with conducting public prosecutions
to even file a complaint against the alleged offender.
In face of this public charge and of other equally outrageous doings,
as jf to wantonly humiliate the State Democracy and commit it to the rati
fication of such iniquities, the chairman and other members of the State
Central Committee publicly serenaded this man. and the -chairman thanked
him' and eulogized him for his statesmanlike services to the party during
the campaigns. And so I might go on, ad libitum, usque ad nauseam^ but
it is unnecessary.
As a self-respecting man I would feel justified and bound in honor to
withdraw from a party which has fallen to such levels; but there is an
other and potent reason for my immediate withdrawal, which is, that a
new national party is being formed for the purpose of restoring the natural
rights of the great landless Democracy of America.
It is founded upon the idea that all men have an equal right to live,
and, as a necessary consequence, that all men have at all times an equal
and inalienable right to the use of the natural elements which God made
and gave freely for the subsistence of human life; that to secure these
rights governments are Instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed; that all American citizens are entitled
to equal opportunities with respect to to the great natural resources of our
common country; that no speculator in the natural rights of his fellow r men
should be permitted to prevent American citizens from making homes upon
land which he does not want to use; that no landlord â alien or citizen â
should be permitted to collect toll from American citizens. for allowing them
the privilege of using the natural and indestructible powers of our soil;
that the rental value of land, which results In all cases entirely from the
presence, enterprise, virtue and industry of the whole people, belongs to the
whole people, and should, as a matter of common justice, be taken for pub
lic use; and that no tax or burden of any kind should be imposed upon
commerce, agriculture, manufactures or other industries or upon any prod
utcs.of human labor as long as this rental value of landâ which is the
margin of production â shall be sufficient for public purposes.
Tp the new party, founded upon these principles, which I conceive to be
the very soul and essence of true Democracy, all of the time which I can
henceforth give to the political servioe of my country will be devoted. 1
shall therefore in the next political campaign do all in my power to secure
the election of Henry George or some ofher land reformer to the Presidency
of the United States, unless the Democratic party shall in the meantime be
come democratic by adopting the principles which we have espoused.
Having deliberately resolved to pursue this course, I desire that my po
sition may be fully and exactly understood, bo that my actions and re
lations with respect to political matters shall be neither inconsistent nor
ambiguous.
Sincerely trusting that our social relations may be as pleasant in the
future as they have in the past, I remain, very truly and respectfully
yours, â¢ â  JAMES G. MAGUIRE.

And the maid was as blue as a maid

For her waist was loud, though the style

Yet it swore at the sea. at the sky and

"Oh! what was that sound?" asked the
man in awe â
And the maid knew then that her shirt
waist swore â
" 'Twas only the waves," she said, with
a laugh.

grew red,

night.
And she likewise sworeâ though It
wasn't right.
But as soon as the night had covered the
She staked that waist in a bucket of
lye;

And lost themselves in the soaking wet.
And she said as she saw those colors run:

very early days to a point of land which
projected into the bay and on a part of
which stands the old Marine Hospital of
the Unitod States and now used as the
Sailors' Home. Rincon is Spanish, and
means "inside corner," and the whole
name "punta del Rincon" is "the point of

TATTOO MARKSâ Subscriber, Monte
rey, Cal. Inquiry Is frequently made for
methods for the successful removal of
tattoo marks in the skin. While these
are generally asserted to be indelible If
produced by the insertion of some car

that the marks will disappear by being
first well rubbed with a salve of pure
acetic acid and lard and then with a so
lution of potash, and finally with hydro
chloric acid. To one not acquainted
with the forces of these articles named
the advice is given that a physician
should first be consulted.
POROUS GLASSâ S. A. N.. City. This
correspondent asks: "Is It true that if a.
sealed bottle Is forced down into the sea
a certain distance it will be found to con
tain water if taken up after a certain
time?" Ordinary glass is declared to be Im
permeable to air and water, even under
any kind of pressure. Boatmen on the
Lake of Como are in the habit of per
forming an experiment for the amuse
ment of visitors. An empty bottle well
corked and sealed- is tet down into- the
water to a depth of fifty yards, and on
being hauled tip a short time after it is
found to contain a glassful of water. By
this one is led to suppose that glass must
be porous. But such is not the case. Un
der the pressure of four atmospheres the
sealing wax and cork become impregnat
ed, and the water filters through the bot
tle. This has been proved. The neck of
a bottle has been closed by melting it by
means of a blow pipe and the bottle Im
mersed at similar and greater depth than
in the lake named, and when taken up
there was no water in the bottle.

winning by a couple of lengths In I:2Sâ a
remarkably good run. when the slow con
dition of the track is considered. From
a time standpoint it ranks as the best
performance of the meeting. The book
makers held Marplot at 7 to 10, while
plenty of 5 to 2 was obtainable
about the winner. William OB was a
starter, but the pace was altogether too
worm for him. Little Devin, who rode
Moringa, is a smart bit of a jockey, and
with more experience will win laurels in
the saddle.
The balance of the races were common
place, failing to arouse much enthusiasm
among spectators. The two-year-old
Naplan. with Thorpe up, was the one
lonely favorite to earn a set of brackets.
Darechota. Octuruck and Homestake all
won cleverly, carrying more or less sup
port, the latter being a 20 to 1 shot.
Farrar & Tuberville's filly Saucy Eyes
â was backed down from S to 5 to even
money for the first event, a six furlong
sprint, but after showing speed to the
stretch died away. Darechota, played by
the smart ones in the over-night betting
at 6 and 8 to 1. won handily by a necK
from Eroica. Show honors fell to Ten

pounds the best, coming from the far rear.
In the two-year-old scramble at five
furlongs the 1 to 2 favorite, Napian. was
given quite an argument to the paddock
by Ojai. but there the latter showed his
usual tendency to stop. The first choice
eventually won, with something to spare,
from Gilt Etfge, third choice. Miss ReÂ«l
showed speed and should do better later
on.
The coin was strung good and thick on

HISTORIC JAIL
FOR SPANIARDS
Prisoners Confined in a
Ruined Convent.
MANY SUFFER FROM FEVER
BOILED BICE THE CHIEF FOOD
SUPPLIED.
Corporal Stock of the Volunteer Sig
nal Corps Writes of Life at the
Headquarters of the Phil
ippine Insurgents.
Corporal William J. Stock of the Vol
unteer Signal Corps, writing to his pa
rents in this city from Bacoor, midway
between Cavite and Manila, under date
of August 8, gives information outside
of that found in the letters of corre
spondents to the newspapers. He
writes:
I am writing this in the old F-anish
"Tribunal Municipal del Pueblo de Ba
coor," where we established a telegraph
office on the line between Cavite and tne
front, but owing to the lines oeing ex
tended this is no longer the terminal. The
main body of the corps has been ordered
to the front. Within a stone's throw oi!
the queer old building in which 1 am is
the convent of Bacaor, a large church and
buildings of the familiar rea-tiled Mission
style, it is now no longer used as a
church, for in 1S1Â»6 it was captured by me
insurgents, who made a stronghold of IX,.
It was then bombarded by the Spanish
fleet and is now in about the same con
dition -that it was after the bombardment.
The walls and the roof are shattered uy
Spanish projectiles and one cannot gaze
upon the interior without a feeling of sad
ness. The vaulted ceiling is completely
wrecked, the altars are partly demolish
ed, the tombs of the padres torn up and
their bones scattered about, a frightful
monument of the devastation of shot and
.shell.
The adjoining house is used as a prison,
and the sight of the poor Spanish prison
ers, pale by reason of confinement, nearly
all afflicted with fever, nearly all bare
footed, looking thin and despondent, is
enough to bring tears to fhe eyes of ar
most any one. Their only food is a little
boiled rice and a small piece ot meat to
each man, and which they themselves
must cook on hot coals, for they have no
cooking utensils.
This is the headquarters of the insur
gents, and they are an interesting lot.
Some wear captured Spanish uniforms
and others wear only dull brown, brilliant
red or blue trousers, a thin, gauze-like
shirt and a big straw hat. They are all
barefooted. Each carries a machete and
either a Remington or Mauser rifle slung
over the shoulder. The life ambition of
each seems to be to own a revolver, and
they frequently pay as high as forty and
fifty Mexican dollars for one. They pro
fess great friendship for the Americans,
and when any move along the streets j
they are hailed with cries of "Viva los i
Americanos," and the litile children take
up the cry. These little Filipinos are a
precocious lot, nearly all read and write
and speak Spanish. I have seen boys ,
from 10 to 12 years of age in the ranks
alongside of gray-haired men, the young- ,
sters carrying small rilles.
The nights here are beautiful, fireflies |
flit about in all directions and they are so j
bright that they can be seen at a distance
of a blcck. Bats, crickets, lizards and
.frogs are numerous. Violent thunder
storms, accompanied with much rain, are
of frequent occurrence, both day and
night. Our drinking water is the rain
caught in ollas from roofs. The ordinary
cistern and river water is unfit for use,
though the natives use the former.
Camp Dewey is a queer looking camp.'
It is as large as was Camp Merritt, or
larger. The men are living in shelter
tents erected on bamboo platforms about
two feet from the ground. It looks like
one of those Chinese fishermen's villages
I saw at Monterey. When it rains at the
camp, it does rain and in a very short
time there is three inches of water on the
ground.- therefore the reason for elevated
platforms.
On my way from Camp Dewey to Ba
coor I rode one of those miserable little
beasts that here are by courtesy called
horses. They are not more than four
feet high and weigh about three hundred
pounds, but they are remarkably strong
and useful in drawing the two-wheeled,
two-seated; almost springless carts of the
country', called "carramettas." I wish
you could have seen me astride of one of
those animals coming from camp with
i*ll my equipments; rubber poncho, haver
sack, canteen, carbine, cartridge belt full
of cartridges, and a large wood ax. My
feet were within ten inches of the ground
and I am sure by appearance must have
been as impressive as was that of Sancho
Ennza when out with Don Quixote.
My observation teaches me that the talk
about this climate being unhealthy is all
bosh. The air is warm, but we experi
enced air so much warmer on the ocean
trip that this is cool by comparison.
There is no suspicion of the damp, hot
house-like atmosphere I expected to meet:
on the contrary, it is mIM and balmy. The
native banana which has a name that
sounds like "sarragin" is delicious. They
cost "un centavo." a piece which is one
eightieth part of a Mexican dollar, and a
Mexican dollar here is worth about forty
five cents of our money. The oranges are
thick-skinned, full of seeds and the skin
is a bright green when the fruit is ripe,
but- they do not compare with the navel
oranges of California. The native fruits
nre somewhat queer and I do not care
to have any of them. From all I have
seen, and from what I can learn, if an
individual will take reasonably good care
of himself, he need have no fear in regard
to becoming ill.
Under date of the 27th Corporal Stock
writes of the attack on Manila, and
regrets that acting under orders he
was placed on top of the old church at
Bacoor to receive signals, and could
only see the smoke of battle, while
others of the corps were at the front.
BREAK IN THE YOBA
POWER COMPANY DITCH
Marysville in Total Darkness at
Night Because of the
Disaster.
MARYSVILL.E, Sept. 2?.â The ditch
that provides the motor power for the
Tuba Power Company's electric plant
broke to-day, and in consequence Marys
ville is in total darkness to-night, the
city's lighting contract being with this
company. It is feared that there will be
numerous recurrences of these condi
tions during the approaching winter, as
the ditch crosses a mountainous region
â where landslides are frequent in rough
weather.

day and charged in Justice Gardner's
court with disturbing the pep.ee.
The Growth of Socialism.
It Is argued by deep thinkers that the growth
of socialism is due to the large standing armies
of the world, in which men are often made to
enlist against their will, and thus become dis
contented with existing conditions. The growth
of a stronger race of people Is due to the large
sale of Hostetter^s Stomach Bitters, which Is
tha best medicine for costlveness, dyspepsia,
fever, ague and all nervous troubles. Try on*
bottle.

Having occasion, 'one^day, 'to^dictategto a stenographer in the business ofSc*
of one of the treat Philadelphia newspapers,' I remarked that his duties ' must bo
tiresome and diÂ»3cult from being obliged to write down notes of what so many differ-
eat persons said and, therefore, compelled to accustom himself to all sorts of articula-
tion. "Yes." was his reply, very' few people realize the exacting labor such a
position entails. A clear head is absolutely, necessary and the least illness of tea
, seriously affects Â» the correct performance of my work. â¢ For instance,' I at one timÂ«
suffered from a stomach trouble brought on,' I suppose, by eating cold lunches hastily,
as is necessary with me, and * I finally felt that the trouble would break me up. You
know a disordered stomach is: invariably the foot of any head trouble and of all
things a stenographer's head must be clear. I finally found an effective remedy in
RIPANS TABULES -which I saw advertised in our paper. They are magical in their
effects, and, by the way, did you ever see anything of the sort put up in such superb
shape ? I have found that they seem to rectify nearly every ill, for several of my friends
have taken my prescription of a Tabule now and then with results for which they hayÂ«
heartily thanked me. The dull; heavy headaches I sometimes " had are all gone now.
If : I take dictation from a man who annoys me and makes me nervous I always take â¢
Tabule at the time, and if his breath is not sweet I give one to him." â¢

Three First-Class Battleships, Four

Many Torpedo Boats and
Destroyers.
Bpcctal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27. â The
United States revolutionized naval con
struction and methoO in 1861, and it
has been revolutionizing them ever
since. It la true, other nations have
been progressing more rapidly numeri
cally, but scientifically in hulls, ma
chinery and armaments the United
States naval constructors have again
set the pace for the world. The expe
riences of the war with Spain have sug
gested new departures. The ships of
the future additions to the American
navy will bo a marked advance on
former designs.
The naval programme for 1898-99, un
der the act of May 4, 1890, provides for
three flrst-class battleships, four coast
defense monitors, twelve torpedo boats
and sixteen torpedo destroyers.
Bids for the four harbor defense mon
itors will be opened at the Navy De
partment on Monday next. These
vessels will present some of the
most radical advances in the mod
ern fighting machinery. The monitor
principle has always been distinctively
Amoriran. There are many who re
gard them as the best all-round war
ship yet designed.
The act of Congress, appropriating
for the naval service for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1599, under "increase of i
the navy," referring to the four harbor i
defense vessels of the monitor type, j
limits the cost of these vesels to $1,500,- i

A PROGRAMME
Remarkable Convention
of Democrats.
DICK CROKER DULY SALUTED
RALLY OF NEW YOHK BOURBONS
AT SYRACUSE.
An Attempt to Ingraft a Plank in
the Platform Reaffirming the
Free Silver Doctrine
Fails.
Special DlÃpatch to The Call.
SYRACUSE, N. V., Sept. 28.â The
Democratic State convention met here
at noon to-day absolutely without a
slate or programme other than the tem
porary organization agreed upon in the
State Committee last night. It is in
many respects the most remarkable po
litical convention ever held.
When Mr. Croker entered the con
vention hall his appearance caused a
tremendous demonstration. Mayor Mc-
Guire of Syracuse was greeted with
cheers, especially from the galleries.
Senator Murphy also was liberally ap
plauded.
Chairman Elliott Danforth announced
that the State Committee had directed
him to present as the temporary offi
cers of the convention the Hon. George
M. Palmer of Schoharle as chairman,
and as assistant secretaries Calvin
Huson, Thomas E. Benedict, Frank P.
Hulett and C%trk Day.
Chairman Palmer charged that
the .Republicans had squandered and
wasted the people's money; that the
laws enacted by them had favored the
classes as against the masses; that
many new and neudlees offices had been
created to reward political servants,
and that laws had been passed under
the Republican party lash having for
their sole object the protection and fos
tering of monopolies and trusts.
Palmer attacked the record of the Re
publicans on the State canal expendi
tures, charging corrupt methods in the
use of money, and said no- attempt had
been made to correct any of these
abuses.
The- roll was called and at its comple
tion Delegate J. C. Pierce of Rochester
sent to the platform a resolution which
he asked to have read.
Chairman Palmer announced that the
resolution would be referred to the
committee on resolutions when ap
poLnted. Pierce walked down the cen
ter aisle, loudly demanding that the
resolution be read. "That is a resolu
tion to Instruct the committee on reso
lutions," he said, "and now Is the
proper time for it to be read."
Palmer announced that his decision
was that the resolution should be re
ferred to the committee on resolutions,
and directed the clerk to proceed with
the reading of resolutions for the ap
pointment of committees. The resolu
tion which Mr. Pierce desired read was
as follows:
"I move that when the committee on
resolutions is appointed that they are
Instructed to ingraft in their resolu
tions a plank reaffirming the Chicago
platform of 1896."
Pierce is one of the contesting dele
grates from Monroe County and it is
improbable that he will be given an
other opportunity to present this mo
tion-
When the delegraticmg from each Sen
atorial district had been advised to
send to the secretary the name of their
representative on each of the commit
tees on credentials, resolutions and
permanent organization a recess was
taken until 11 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing.

Refuse to Come Out for Free Silver

TRENTON, N. J., Sept. 28.â The Demo

(From drawings made by the Bureau of Construction and Repair, Navy Department.)
000 each. The limit of time for comple
tion is twenty-one months, w.ith penal
ties from $300 to $600 a day for failure.
The Navy Department, in the con
struction of this class of vessel, eecur
ing the greatest results at the ltast ex
penditure of money, has in view n t
only the securing of the mainland har
bors of the United States, but also of
its island possessions in the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans.
The design for the monitors, which
have been named Arkansas, Connecti
cut, Florida and Wyoming, was. pre
pared by Chief Constructor Hichborn.
It was decided that the best all round
arrangement that could be built with
the available appropriation was the ar
rangement with single-balanced turret
on the center line forward, containing
two high-powered 12-inch breech-load
ing rifles, a gun that has just been de
signed to be used with smokeless pow
der; four 4-inch rapid-fire breech-load
ing rifles, also to be used with smoke
less powder, complete the. main bat
tery. The secondary battery will con
sist of three six-pounder rapid-fire and
four 1-pounder automatic rifles.
The general characteristics of these
vessels, as shown in the elements of de
sign, will be: Length on load water
line. 225 feet; breadth (extreme) at
water line. 50 feet; mean draft at nor
mal displacement, 12 feet 6 Inches; nor
mal displacement, about 2700 tons;
cratic State Convention nominated for
Governor Elvin W. Crane, the prosfcu
tor of Essex County, and adopted a plat
form which in a measure supports the
Democratic national platform. The con
vention, however, without debate de
feated a proposition to sprciticully indorse
the platform adopted by the Chicago con
vention of 1896. This for a few moments
caused considerable turmoil, but tho band
struck up .l lively tune, and Anally the
silver men accepted the situation grace
fully. Later, when Mr. Crane bad b< en
nominnttd. senator Daly and Clarence
Atkinson, both of whom were special fa
vorites of the silver men and were can
didates for the nomination, mounted the
platform and promised to do all they
could to Insure Mr. Crane's election. A
feature of the convention was the pres
ence of a delegation of colored men, who
had called to pledge support to the con
vention's nominee.
The war plank of the platform is as
follows:
We declare that the thanks of the people
of the State arnl nation ar>- due to the Boldlera
and sailors of the army and navy of the United
States who have imperiled their lives in deft naâ¬
of their country and in vindication of the honor
of ltÂ« flag In the recent Spanish war; that the
nation owes them permanent recognition of
their i.atrlotinni nr.ii their valor and ample
and permanent provision for those of their sur
vivors who have received disabling and honor
able wuunds in the service of the country, and
that the memory of thuse who have fallen in
Its defense shall be held In grateful and ever
lasting remembrance; that the. State should
make suitable provision for additional pay to
our New Jersey volunteers. While we rejoice
and fpel thankful to them for their great vic
tories on land and sea, we denounce the gross,
open, criminal lncompetency of those planed in
and defiantly kept In charge of the affairs of
the War Department of the present adminis
tration of the Government of the United States,
resulting in the neodlfss loss of life and the
infliction of horrible punVrinpr and torture upon
thousands of the brave defenders of the coun
try's honor, and we charge the present admin
istration with being solely responsible for the
horrible results of this Incompetenny of Gov
ernment officials, continued even after the ap
palling results wore repeatedly brought to the
attention of the President of the United States
and his official advisers, and we call the atten
tion of the people of the Ptat" to the fact that
up to this time not a single example has been
made of a Government official responsible for
these monstrous wrongs. We deplore the spec
tacle of an ex-Governor of this State, now a
member of that Cabinet, appearing at a public
convention of his party as the apologist and
defender of Algorism and its results.
OREGON READY FOR
HER LONG VOYAGE
NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â The United
States battleship Oregon went down from
the Brooklyn Navy Yard and anchored
off Tompkinsville, preparatory to her
start on her long voyage to the Pacific.
The Oregon draws more than two feet
over her normal draft, 28 feet, bo that
she is over 30 feet in the water. Besides
an enormous consignment of stores and
provisions, she carries 14C0 tons of coal
and more than 500 tons of ammunition.
In order to carry this amount oi powder
and shells a number of temporary maga
zines were constructed In her hold.
As the ship moved out of the navy yard
her band began to play "Homeward
Bound." Her crew was drawn up on the
port bow, with tne marine guard abaft
the bow. The dock was crowded with
marines and sailors and a crowd of spec
tators. Cheers were exchanged. The
Oregon was cheered by the crews of the
Texas, lowa. Massachusetts and Rain
bow, which she passed on her way nut.
She responded by the blowing of her big
steam siren.
The Oregon will remain at Tompkins
ville until to-morrow, when she i.Â« to be
Joined by the lowa. The two will then
begin their cruise to the Philippines. It
was said at the navy yard that the rea
son the lowa was unable to start to-day
was that she was waiting for an addi
tional consignment of ammunition which
is expected to arrive to-day.
MOUNTAIN COPPER
COMPANY'S PROJECTS
REDDING, Sept. 28.â An Important en
largement of the scope of operations of
the Mountain Copper Company at Kes
wiek and Iron Mountain is now under
way. An order has been placed with the
Terry Lumber Company for 1.500,000 feet of
lumber. The bunk and boardinf house
capacity of the company is being en
larged so as to accommodate from 200 to
300 more men, which will bring the list
of employes up to 2000 men.
The company's railroad will be extended
seven miles, so as to take in sonic rich
copper deposits lately discovereu on the
corporation's patented land. Ground is
being cleared for the construction of sev
eral additional smelters, made necessary
by an increased ore output.
The company's refinery is located in New
Jersey, and as the refined product is mar
keted almost wholly in the Eastern Static
there is no probability of a removal of
the plant to Keswick, at least in me near
future. When the markets of the Orient
6hall take the copper products of Shasta
County the Mountain Copper Company
announces it will erect :ear Redding the
largest copper refinery in the world. Six
ty-six thousand pounds sterling were dis
tributed in dividends to American and
English stockholders of the Mountain
Copper Company for the first year of its
operation. x

bottom and close watertight subdivi
sions.
There will be one military mast, fitted
with lighting and searchlight tops.
Seven boats are to be stowed clear
of the blast of the guns, two being the
lifeboats, which are to be carried at
davits so as to be quickly lowered.
The protection of the hull against in
jury to the water line region is to be
afforded by means of a side armor belt,
the maximum thickness being 11 inches,
tapering to 5 inches at the armor shelf,
the depth being 5 feet. The maximum
thickness is abreast the engine and
boiler spaces; thence forward and
aft it is reduced by steps to a mini
mum thickness of 5 Inches at the bow
and stern. The barbettes for the 12
inch guns will have armor about 10
inches thick.
The turret is of the Hichborn bal
anced type, with front plate inclined
forty-two degrees from the vertical.
The side plates of the turret armor are
to be 9 inches thick.
The main or protected deck is to ex
tend throughout the length of the ves
sel, to be worked flat. The total thick
ness will be one and one^half inches.
BOMBSHELL IN
THE REA CAMP
New Move Made in the
Slander Suit.
THE COMPLAINT AMENDED
ACTION MAY REOPEN THE EN
TIRE CASE.
Plans of the Defense Upset by a
Decision of the Court
in Favor of the
Plaintiff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 28.â A new phase
appeared in the Jarman-Rea slander
suit to-day and one liable to result in
a reopening of the plaintiff's case. This
was the decision by Judge Kittredge to
allow Attorney Delmas to amend the
complaint. The presentation of "an
amended complaint yesterday was a
move not expected by Rea's counsel
and completely upset the plans of the
defense. They had stated all along that
the complaint contained no grounds for
action and expected a nonsuit.
Now that Jarman has been allowed
to amend his complaint this is changed.
New evidence will be introduced and
complainant can go over the whole case
again. This also strengthens their case
and will cause the defense to offer an
abundance of testimony. The entire
afternoon was occupied in arguing the
demurrer to the amended complaint.
Attorney Delmas occupied but a short
time this morning in arguing for the
privilege of amending the complaint.
In his argument he said that there was
not a person in the world, whose in
telligence was above that of a dog,
who would not understand Rea's slan
derous remarks to mean that he
charged Jarman with being corrupt
and with having accepted a bribe. He
characterized the boss' acts as an at
tempt "to stab the reputation of Jar
man to the heart." According to Rea
ethics, said the speaker, since money
was lying around loose Jarman was a
fool if he did not take some and if he
did he was a knave.
Judge Kittredge held that plaintiff
had a right to amend his complaint at
this time. The court said that when the
demurrer was presented without argu
ment he had overruled it. In that he
had erred. Had he sustained the de
murrer when presented the plaintiff
would certainly have been allowed to
amend his complaint. After having his
right cast out without an opportunity to
argue it and the court had practically
sustained the demurrer In after decis
ions therefore he held the plaintiff
could exercise that right at this time.
This caused consternation among
Rea's attorneys, and when they recov
ered from their surprise they said they
would demur on these grounds: That
the words uttered by Rea were not ac
tionable and slanderous per se and that
the complaint does not set forth any
specific damage resulting therefrom.
This afternoon a demurrer along
these lines was presented. It also
prayed that judgment, with costs, be
given for defendant. Attorney More
house opened argument for defense.
He was followed by Delmas for plaintiff
and the latter in turn by Burchard for
defendant.
ON THEIR WAY TO THE
PARIS CONFERENCE
Major General Merritt, Major Stroth
er and Captain Howell Pass
Port Said.
PORT SAID, Egypt, Sept. 28.â Major
General Merritt, United States army,
Major Strother, aid de camp, and Cap
tain Mott Howell, the general'B secre
tary, passed through here to-day on
board the steamer Arcadia, on their
way to Paris.
A conning tower of 7^6 Inches in
thickness, having an armored com
munication tube 3 inches in thickness,
will be carried In a suitable command-
Ing position forward, the tu^e extend
ing to the armor deck and affording
protection to the voice tubes, bell
wires, etc.
The vessel will be driven by twin
screws. The engines (two in number)
are to be of the vertical, trlple-expan-
slon type, in one water-tight compart
ment. The high-pressure cylinder 17
inches in diameter, the intermediate
26>4 inches, and the low-pressure 40
inches; the stroke of the engine is to
be 34 inches. The boilers (four in num
ber) are to be of the water tube type,
constructed for a working pressure of
250 pounds, and are to be placed in
one water-tight compartment. Then
will be the usual auxiliary machinery
and workshop tools.
The total coal Winker capacity wfll
allow at least 200 tons with loose stow
age, without trimming.
These vessels will have staterooms
in addition to one for the captain for
six officers, require a complement of
crew of 125, for whom ample berthing
I space has been provided. Store rooms
are provided for one month's supply of
clothing, contingent and small stores.
The estimated speed of the vessel Is
to be 12 knots, amply sufficient for a
harbor-defe.nse vessel.
These harbor-defense monitors, which
will have all the latest improvements
known to naval science, will be im
portant additions to the navy, and be
ing small, with large crew accommoda
tions for vessels of their size, they will
be valuable for the use and instruction
of the naval militia, that important or
ganization which has so ably served
the Government In the late war with
Spain.
WARNING OF THE
COMING STRUGGLE
Sarrien's Letter to the
French Magistrates.
ZURLINDEN AS A DICTATOR
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS HE
MAY BECOME A BOULANGER,
Bigors of Dreyf us' Imprisonment to
Be Modified Pending the Result
of the Application for a
New Trial.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â A dispatch to
the World from Paris says: The letter
of the Minister of Justice to the Magis
trates throughout France about at
tacks on the army is said to be a warn
ing of the coming struggle between the
Jesuits, who are stated to rule the
army, and the ultramontanes and
radicals, who wish to reap political
power.
General Zurlinden left the Cabinet
because he represented the Jesuits,
and especially the Alsatian party. In
deed, it is noticeable how many names
in the Dreyfus case are Alsatians and
almost German.
If the Jesuits win the day and Drey
fus is not released, it is quite on the
cards that General Zurlinden will turn
out another Boulanger, and that
France will have a military dictator
ship.
It is expected that the Minister of
Justice, M. Sarrien, if he has not al
ready done so, will issue directions that
the rigors of the imprisonment of Drey
fus be modified according to custom,
pending a final decision in his case,
which is now before the Court of Cas
sation.
CLASS CONFIRMED BY
ARCHBISHOP RIORDAN
One Hundred and Eighty Young Peo
ple Taken Into the Catholic
Church.
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 28.â This was a red
letter day for the boys at St. Vincent's
Orphan Asylum, situated in the line 1 of
the broad gauge railway, four miles north
of this city. The rites of confirmation
in the Catholic church was administered
to 180 of them by Archbishop Riordan.
About 160 were inmates of the institution
and twenty came from San Rafael and
Novata parishes.
Archbishop Riordan , came from San
Francisco last evening: as the guest of
Rev. Father Hugh Lagan, the pastor of
St. Raphael's. This morning the two
were joined at the asylum by Rev. Joseph
Phelan of the Church of the Holy
Rosary, situated on the asylum grounds
Rev. Joseph Byrne., of the Church of Our
Lady of Loretto, at Novata, Rev. P. Filey
of St. Joseph's Church, Alameda, and*
Rev. Father Crowley, superintendent of
the Youths' , Directory. .
The Archbishop was assisted in the rites
of confirmation by all the visiting priests
as well as by Fathers Lagan and Phelan.
The music for the : ceremony was fur
nished by an orchestra of twenty-three
pieces. A striking feature was the song
by a Jesuit choir of seventy voices all
being members ; of the institution. A
large number of visitors, friends and rela
tives of the youths ; confirmed were pres
ent. They were taken In charge by Broth
er Superior Michael and hospitably en
tertained prior to and' after the cere
mony.

PAVILION HOSPITAL
ON ANGEL ISLAND.
General Merriam Given Authority by Tel
egrapb to Have It Con
structed,
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.â Major General Merriam, commanding
the Department of the Pacific, to-night was given authority by tele
graph to erect a pavilion hospital of 400 .beds on Angel Island, near
San Francisco. The definite location and plans of the hospital are to
be approved by Lieutenant Colonel Mlddleton, chief surgeon of the
Department of the Pacific.
Several days ago Lieutenant Colonel Middleton recommended to
Surgeon General Sternberg that, In view of the occupation of Manila
by 20 000 troops and of Honolulu by 4000 troops, a pavilion hospital
be erected at some convenient point near San Francisco for the ac
commodation of patients that might be sent back to this country.
The post hospital at the Presidio at San Francisco has accommoda
tions for only forty patients, and Its beds are required for garrison
patients. The division hospital, located in two af the barrack build
ings, has at present 325 patients. The room it now occupies will be
needed shortly by the troops as barracks.
Lieutenant Colonel Middleton regards Angel Island as the most
desirable location in the vicinity of San Francisco for a hospital. The
climate is salubrious, It is free from wind and fog, and Is isolated
from the city, being reached only by boat.
Secretary Alger approved the recommendation of Lieutenant
Colonel Middleton, and General Merriam was directed to have the chief
quartermaster erect the building at once, expediting its construc
tion as much as possible.

offering them the hospitalities of the
salon de conference, the French Gov

said the United States appreciated the
good offices of France, and after M.

action of France, the interview ended
ana the Americans retired.

CLEARS A MYSTERY
OF SHASTA COUNTY
Skeleton of Missing Henry Dolman
Found in the Woods Near
Lakeview.
REDDING, Sept. 2S.â The mystery sur
rounding the disappearance of Henry Dol
man was cleared ar few days ago by the
discovery of his bleaching skeleton eigh
teen miles northeast of Lakeview.
Shortly after the Fourth of July Dol
man suddenly disappeared from his ac
customed haunts, leaving no trace by
which his whereabouts could be ascer
tained. The country lor miles around was
thoroughly searched, but the mystery of
his disappearance could not be lifted.
On the 22d inst. a young man named
Vierling, a sheepherder in the employ of
W. K. Barry, stumbled on the remains of
a man near the Drake camp. The skele
ton was lying near a log, a rusted Win
chester rifle on the ground beside it. The
arms were extended and the face lay
downward.
Coroner Harris went to the scene of the
grewsoirie find, held an inquest and
brought the remains to Lakeview for
burial. The Coroner's jury brought
In a verdict to the effect that the
skeleton was that of Walter Dolman, a
native of Norway. -28 years old and un
married. Death was attributed to the ac
cidental discharge of a Winchester rifle
in his own hands. Tt was evident that
after the unfortunate man received the
fatal wound he had walked' about, button
ing his coat tightly about him to stop the
flow of blood. He was a resident of Cali
fornia. The whereabouts of his relatives,
if he had any in America, could not be
ascertained. The remains were interred
in the potter's field.
GERMAN 3APTISTS CONFER.
Members of the United States and
Canada Work in Harmony.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 28.â The triennial con
ference of the German Baptists of the
United States and Canada has been con
cluded after a session extending over a
week. It has been decided to meet in 1901
at Berlin, Ontario, Canada. The much
debated question of the German Baptist
Orphanage in Louisville, which has been
practically owned by one individual, was
settled. The association gave up the in
stitution to individual control and ap
pointed a new orphanage ' committee of
one from each or the seven conferences.
This committee will see that German
Baptist orphans are taken care of In pri
vate families.
Reports were heard from the homes for
old people at Chicago and Philadelphia,
and this philanthropy was discussed.

CASHED BOGTJS CHECHS.
Swindler Forges the Mountain Cop
per Company's Name.
REDDING, Sept. 28.â An individual
having-, the appearance of a worklnj*nian
succeeded in victimizing seven Redding
and two Keswick business firms with
forged Mountain Copper Company
checks. The checks, which had undoubt
edly been printed under the direction of
the man who passed them, called for the
sum of ?16 60 each. Close comparison Is
necessary to detect the true from the
counterfeit. Mountain Copper Company
checks to the amount of several hun
dred dollns are cashed weekly in this
city, and it was an easy matter to vic
timize the merchants.

"POSH" TO DOWN
THE GALLAGHERS
To Knife the Phelan
Nominees.
"JACK" BONNET IS EXCEPTED
THE BOYS WILL GIVE HIM
HEARTY SUPPORT.
The Century Gang Propose to Gobble
the Patronage, and Therefore
the Democratic Tax-Eat
ers Will Bolt.
The latest story in Democratic political
circles 1s that all the candidates of the
Fay-Phelan committee of one hundred,
with the exception of one, are to be
knifed at the polls by the City Hall
"push." The lone candidate who has
escaped the wrath of the practical poli
ih-lans Is Theodore F. Bonnet, the nomi
nee for Sheriff. His personal popularity
and the opposition from certain quarters
to his name going before the committee i
have endeared him to the "gang."
The young men in the hall openly de
clare that it is a case of war to the
knife, and say they will spare neither j
pains, time nor expense to bring Mr. Phe
lan and his troop of marionettes to a
proper sense of their actual non-import
ance. And there 1b little chance of the
young men who live off the taxpayers
being whipped into line. The general row
has been taken up by each and every one
of them as a personal matter, and there
1b no end or limit to the vengeance they
are calling down on the Mayor and his
committee.
The feeling of resentment against the
Fhelan slate by the employes of the City
Hall ia practically unanimous. There is
but one office that will even make a bluit
at supporting the ticket. That is tho tax j
office. The renomination of Block, as the i
result of a promise wrung from Pholao
when Block sided with his charter light
in the Election Commisssion, has to a
certain extent appeased his deputies. Bat
It Is a Question if the men in the tax of
fice will go out of their way to help the
ticket other than the immediate fight of
their own candidate.
It is generally understood that the dis
tribution of patronage in case of success
will go to the personal friendu and rela- :
tives of the century committee and the I
advisers of the Mayor. No one for a mo- j
ment suspects that actual service In be
half of the party will meet with anything
other than scorn of Mr. Fay and h'.-s
henchmen, who are now in full control cf ;
the works. And not wishing to be rtgura- i
lively spat upon the young men who toil |
for the people's money have Joined hands <
wth a determination to knife tiie ticket !
on November 8 without quarter.
By defeating the selections of the I
Phelan-Fay family gathering that has j
been held under the name of the commit- j
tee of 100, the push believe that the Mayor j
and his exclusive circle of ultra-reformers
will be forced to go out of business, at j
least for the time being. The defeat of j
the ticket named by the committee of 100, j
the old liners believe, would gain them at I
. least a voice in the general management j
of affairs In ISOO.
Many of the practical politicians have
announced their determination to pass up
the reformers and mix up in Republican
fights. They say it is useless to become
Identified with any one on the Phelan
ticket because the entire distribution of
the patronage in the event of success is
to rest with the half-dozen men- who are
engineering the committee of one hun
dred.
No man was nominated by this, self
styled Democratic party until he forfeit
ed all claims to the patronage of his of
fice in case of election.
Evtn the head deputyships are to be at
the disposal of Phelan, "Whispering"
Gavid, Braunhart and the Fay family.
Actual work In the interest of the party i
will receive no recognition whatever. The j
Jobs are to be distributed as the result of !
personal friendships, the place of birth in I
Scotland or for reasons more substantial
" than these.
Then, again, the City Hall boys figure
that the committee of one hundred has |
named a losing ticket with the exception I
of one or two candidates. Many of the '
nominees are practically unknown. That i
Is said to be a mark In their favor. Tho
more they become known the 'leas their
chances of election.
A truly tragic phase of the row that is
now under way among the Democratic
party and the committee of one hundred
Is the passing of the Clan Gallagher as a
potent power in local politics. Up to a
week ago the Gallaghers were regarded as
Invincible. Numerically they are without
a peer in this or any other country. Their
capabilities as voters are said to be sim
ply astounding. The Gallagher vote is al
most large enough to elect a candidate
with the world leagued against him.
It is now whispered among the deceml
nators of the low down that the Clan
Galjagher is about to amalgamate with or
annex the legion of dissatisfied "pollies"
beyond hope or question, and turn the
tables on the committee of one hundred
forever and a day. Or, to express it
more poetically in accordance with the
ideas of Mr. Mealy Davis:
"Phelan has trampled on the worm that
will turn and sting him."
Probably the most unsatisfactory nom
ination so far as the push is concerned
is John A. Brown, who has been placed
before the people as an aspirant for the
County Clerkship. In the vicinity of
Sixth and Minna streets, Mr. Brown la
known as "Growler" Brown, owing 1 to
his proclivity for rushing the "duck"
"rolling the rock" or "taking Willie for
a walk." The same being familiar terms
applied to the act of procuring the festive
.steam beer in a can or Jug at neighbor
ing saloons.
Mr. Brown was discovered by D. J.
Tomalty of the committee of one hun
dred. Mr. Tomalty conducts a steam
beer emporium in the vicinity of Brown's
residence. For a number of years Brown
has been the star performer in and about
Tomalty's place. With the aid of To
malty's whiskers he was brushed into
the- good graces of "Whispering" Gavin
who fathered his nomination for Count*
Clem.
The turning down of Ambrose, who
eought renomination as Superintendent of
the Streets, was also a sad blow to the
small army of young men who have been
drawing large salaries from the Street
I'â¢I 'â¢ jjurtment for the last two years. In
the Recorder's office everybody has a
knife out for the proteges of the com
mittee of one hundred. Fitzgerald, the
lahor Commissioner who has been named
for Public Administrator, is notoriously
known as the most cordially hated man
among the laboring classes. The substi
tution of Barclay Henley, the grand old
hf,r of Innumerable defeats, for J. J.
Barrett, for District Attorney, Is looked
upon as an absolute indication of defeat.
The downfall of the Gallaghers was
hinted at when the City and County At
torney, James Gullager, failed to secure
the nomination of his chief clerk, Stoney,
to succeed him. The nomination of Lane
for the office of city and County Attor
ney was an absolute affront to the entire
clan.

INDEPENDENTS ARE
OUT FOR A CONFLICT
THE CONVENTION WILL BE EN
TIRELY UNPLEDGED.
A Full County Ticket to Be Nomi
nated â Oaklanders Who Will
Probably Be Selected as
Candidates.
OAKLAND, Sept. 28.â A very important
caucus of the Independent party was held
to-night, and details were arranged for
the convention on Friday night. There
was a desire expressed to have the con
vention behind closed doors in the man
ner of the Municipal League four years
ago, but finally this was voted down, and
It was decided to have everything open
and above board. Not one of the 800 dele
gates whom it is said will be in attend
ance will be pledged.
It has been decided that the scope of
the Independents shall be limited to the
county offices, and that on no account
shall the legislative ticket be touched. It
Is probable that the Republican nominees
for the Legislature will be formally In
dorsed.
There are several candidates for each
office, but a careful review of the situa
tion points to the following as being the
most probable to receive nominations:
For Auditoi^-D. C. Hlnsdale, for several
years deputy City Assessor.
For Sheriffâ Louis Schaffer, ex-Chief of
Police.
For Assessorâ Ex-Mayor John L. Davle.
For Treasurerâ Ex-Supervisor D. C.
Brown.
For Coronerâ James L. Taylor.
For Recorderâ A. K. Grim.
For County Clerkâ T. C. Stoddard.
For City Justiceâ A. W. Bishop.
It Is not known what candidates will ac
cept nominations, as the managers de
clare that everything done will be as far
removed from a slate as possible. Unless
all signs fail there will certainly be a
lively time on Friday night; for this even
ing some of the friends of Mr. Dalton,
the Republican nominee for Assessor,
were openly declaring that they had al
ready captured more than half of the
delegates to the so-called Independent
convention.

INDEPENDENTS
CAUSING GREAT
UNEASINESS
May Nominate Next
Friday Night.
DAVIE IS BEING BOOMEP
MAY BE CHOSEN TO RUN FOR
ASSESSOR.
The Republicans Finally Arrange for
the Candidates to Make a
Campaign in the
County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9uS Broadway, Sept. 28.
The workers on the Independent ticket
, are prosecuting their plans very secretly;
in fact, so secretly that no one not on
the inside has been able to learn definite
ly who is the head, body or tail of the i
movement. There is, however, a great
deal of whispering going on, and all man
ner of mysterious caucuses are being
hold, which keep the politicians guessing.
I The Independent convention Is pro-
I grammed lor Friday night at Germania
| Hall, and if the plans carry three hun
i dred delegates will be present, although it
! is not known by what authority they are
being called together.
Some of the candidates regularly nomi
nated expect to win by margins so close
i that anything like an organized opposi- |
1 tion may change the tide. The Independ- j
j ent movement, therefore, is of special in
terest to them, and as it is well-known
that there are ho*ts of dissatisfied voters
|in all the parties, it is not improbable
i that the new movement may cut quite a j
figure ultimately, although at present it
is in a very incipient stage.
If the Independent convention material
j lze, it will indorse the candidacies of sev
j eral Independent office-seekers, and will
] probably nominate John L. Davie for
Assessor. Davie has been going quietly
I about his business since he retired trom
I the Mayoralty two years ago, and is now
being brought out. Davie occupies a pecu
liar position in Alameda politics. Four
years ago J. W. Nelson was nominated
iby the Municipal Leagueâ Republicans,
j Democrats and Prohibitionistsâ for Mayor.
! John L. Davie was nominated by the
I Populists and was laughed at when he
i mentioned his candidacy seriously. When
the votes were counted Davie was a long
I way ahead of his competitors.
I At the present time Henry Dalton, the
j Republican nominee for Assessor, has been
| Indorsed by that section of the Demo
1 crats, Popuf^ts and Free Silver people j
which believe in fusion, and again John I
L. Davie is being trotted out to try to
lead the dissatisfied element to victory.
I They realize that it is almost a hope- i
, less task, but are willing, apparently, to
I take chances upon winning.
County Clerk Jordan is now seeking ad
vice as to the legality of placing the so-
I called fusion ticket on the ballot. He is â 
\ experiencing the same difficulty as was i
; encountered by Secretary of State Brown, ;
I and even the decision of the Supreme <
Court in the Populist case will not aid
! him in regard to the Silver Republican ;
' end of the tangle.

DR. SUSSDORFF DEFENDS
HIS MANAGEMENT
REPLIES TO ATTACKS MADE
UPON HIM.
A Letter From Drs. Williamson and
Dodge Expressing Confidence
in Him.
Dr. G. E. Sussdorff.superlntendent of
the City and County Hospital, has been
smarting under the attack made upon
him and his management of the institu
tion recently. A day or two after the ar
ticle appeared he received a letter signed
jointly by Dr. Williamson, chairman* of
the Board of Health hospital committee,
and Dr. Dodge, chairman of the Hospital
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
to the following effect:
Observing in the press of a recent date that
your management of the hospital has been se
verely criticised and reflections made as to
yi. ur honesty and integrity, we desire to state
that you have the full confidence of the under
signed, and n - e trust that your efforts in be
half of the hospital will be marked by the
same energy and success in the future as in
the past.
In speaking of the matter last night Dr.
Sussdorff said:
"1 took charge of tho institution last
November at the request of my friend, the
late Dr. Morse. I made up my mind to
establish a reputation for myself, and I
have striven day and night to that end.
It Is hard work to watch personally every
detail in a large institution like this, but
I have done so, and the result is seen
in the letter I voluntarily received from
Dr. Williamson and Dr. Dodge, who are
the best competent to judge me and my
work.
"There are certain rules and regulations
governing the Institution, and I deter
mined on accepting the position, to see
that they were enforced. There must be
discipline here as anywhere else, and
when any one is guilty of a dereliction of
duty I send for him or her and courteous
ly but firmly explain that it must not
occur again.
"Soon after taking office I suspended
some internes for good reasons, and they
vowed to get even with me by forcing
me out of the institution. I have no doubt
the attack upon me has been instigated
by some interne with that object in view.
Internes are here by privilege, and while
here they must conform to the rules.
"To say that I am escorted to my apart
ments from the dining-room, evidently
insinuating that I am always drunk, )s
false, and I defy any one in the institu
tion to swear that I was ever seen under
the influence of liquor. Ido not exact
homage from every employe, but I do not
want to forget that I am a gentleman
and if I show them what good breeding
demands they should not object.
"How absurd it Is for any one to say
that I could apply the hospital funds
for luxuries for myself and family when
everything is got by requisition. The ac
counts are sent to the Board of Super
visors and are paid by the City Treas
urer. Ido not handle one dollar of the
appropriation.
"When I came here this was the mean
est place in the world In many ways. I
told Drs. Williamson and Dodge that cer
tain things must be done, and they agreed
with me. Now there is a difference.
Take the operating room as an example.
The operators now wear white linen coats
and aprons and there Is now proper heat
and light.
.J,' Ju .* 1 ,let, let , me Bay that * am running
this institution for hospital purposes and
nothing else. I want to make a reputa
tion for myself, as I said before, and I
don t want to be unjustly and malicious
ly attacked."

LITTLE CHANCE
OF REMAINING
IN SERVICE
Seventh Will Hardly
Go to Manila.
MAY APPLY FOR DISCHARGE
THIS MTTST BE MADE BY THE
FIRST OF THE MONTH.
Thus the War Department Will
Know the True Wishes of the
Members of the
Regiment.
There is little or no prospect of the
Seventh California Regiment going to
Manila. Despite the fact that orders were
-received here on Tuesday placing the
regiment upon the list of those to go to
the Philippines with General Miller, offi
cers who are In a position to know de
clare that the War Department has sim
ply taken this way of ascertaining the
true wishes of the enlisted men of the
regiment. The order stated that any sol
dier who did not wish to go and who
could show good reason for being mus
tered out, upon making formal applica
tion would be given his discharge, j-his
phase of the order was simply a tip to
General Merriam to find out the true sit
uation In the regiment.
Yesterday the order of the department
commander was read to the men of the
Seventh. It stated that orders had been
received for the regiment to go to Man
ila, but that those who desired it could
secure their discharge by making appli
cation for it through the proper military
channels by the Ist of October; that is,
the applications will have to be In the
hands of the department commander by
that time. General Merriam's object in
this order is to ascertain beyond any
doubt just what the men of the regiment
desire. When he has this before him
the general will make his recommenda
tions accordingly to the War Depart
ment, and there is no doubt that his
suggestions will be followed. If General
Merriam finds that the majority of the
regiment want to be mustered out he will
recommend that it be done, and the War
Department will comply with his recom
mendation.
Yesterday when the order was read to
the men of the Seventh they immediately
began the work of polling the companies,
and this revealed the fact that over 80 per
cent of the men want to go home. The
men were busy writing out their appli
cations for discharge and filine: them
with their first sergeants. Next tney
have to be approved by the company com
manders, and then they go to Colonel
Berry, and from him to the department
commander. It can be safely stated that
80 per cent of the men desire to get out
of service, but when the applications are
all in it will be found that even a greater
percentage of the men want to be mus
tered out. This will be all !: â¢<â¦ General
Merriam wants to lay before the AVar
Department, and there is no doubt as to
what he will recommend. One prominent
officer at the Presidio said yesterday:
"From what I know of General Merriam
I am perfectly certain that when he is
aware that the majority of the men of the
Seventh want to leave the service he will
recommend that the regiment be muster
ed out and there Is no doubt that it will
be."
Captain Pratt said yesterday that he
had received no orders to stop mustering
out the regiment, although the order re
ceived on Tuesday is paramount to one.
However, he will continue his work just
as though nothing had happened. Colo
nel Berry stated that the order for the
regiment to go to Manila had come as a
surprise to him, and he declared that
neither he nor his officers had been work
ing to deceive the men or to keep the reg
iment in the service. Everything in the
regiment is quiet and the men are sim
ply waiting until the first of the month,
when General Merriam will take action,
and they are certain that their wishes
will be rgarded and that Captain Pratt
had received no orders to cease his work
of getting the regiment ready to be mus
tered out, and it Is an almost foregone
conclusion that the War Department will
act in accordance with the wishes of the
majority of the men of the regiment,
which means that it will be mustered out
of the service of the United States.
NOTED MUSICAL ARTIST.
Rafael Meany, the Guatemalan Pian-
ist, Delights a Circle of Critics.
Rafael Meany, late director of the Con
servatory of Music at Guatemala, gave an
exhibition of his talents before a select
assemblage In the rooms of Colonel Ko
walsky at the Baldwin Hotel last night.
It was Professor Meany's first bow to
San Francisco critics, and he made a de
cidedly favorable impression. He Is
gifted with a rare touch and his rendi
tion of familiar opera airs and Inter
pretation of selected classics at once pro
claimed him as a master of the piano.
His excellent performance and thorough
realization of the theory of his art elicited
frequent applause from the little circle
of critics. Professor Meany intends
making this city his home and will no
doubt delight the ears of many music
lovers during the coming season.

NEW YORK MONEY MARKET.
r NO FEARS ENTERTAINED AS TO ANY
MARKED STRINGENCY.
The circular of Henry Clews, under date
of New York, September 24. says: The
past week has been marked by continued j
dullness and some irregularity in prices^ 'Bear'
operators have availed themselves of the fact
that, though the money market Is in a sub
stantially sound position, yet thÂ» further de
cline of $3,000,000 in surplus reserve shown In
the last bank statement evidenced that the
turn toward ease had not yet arrived; and j
this Inference has been confirmed by an ad- |
vance in the rate of interest on call loans. This ;
encouraged attack upon certain industrials, j
with some effect; but, upon the more stable ;
*ecuritlea. prices have been on the whole fairly j
maintained, and the week closes with a more !
hopeful feeling. , ,
â¢The money market has reached a point at
which a turn toward ease can be a. matter or j
a few more days. Each day of the week the
Bub-Treasury has been a large debtor at the ;
'clearing-house, and the amount of money sent ;
to the Interior has been quite nominal. Ihe :
rreat factor portending ease, however, has been
the activity of the gold movement from Europe.
Up to the close, of yesterday the foreign en
gagements for the shipment of gold tc- New
York aggregated close upon $14,000,000. By the
end of nexet week the whole of that sum will
have found its way into the city banks; and the ;
large supply of export bills coming forward |
Indicates further large importations of metal. ;
' London feels the loss of specie rather acutely,
Â»nd there are reports that the Bank of Eng
land, in addition to Thursdays advances In the
Tata of Interest to I per cent, may resort to bor
' rowing gold on consols: but the drain is not |
likely to be checked much until the imports of
gold here have depressed the local rate of in
terest below that of London, when relief may
come from New York bu>in sterling bills for
transient investment. The source of relief to |
London is not likely .to be forthcoming, how
ever until a considerable further amount of
rold has been sent hither and the rate for
money further enhanced in London. In any
â¢vent the wheels are already set in motion of i
a. movement which will end In an easy money
market here I that may reasonably be expected
to continue for many months to come, Should \
any unforeseen contingencies prevent this re- :
sult, it is well known that the Secretary of the :
Treasury stands ready to anticipate his Interest !
payments by disbursing the January. Interest
on the old 4 per cent loan amounting to $5,566,
468. The November payments are also likely to- â 
be anticipated If there is any need. â  Interest ;
then becomes due on $162,315,400 in new 4 per i
cent bonds, on $100,000,000 -of the 5 per cents of |
1654 and upon the whole of the new 3 per cent '
loan of $200,000,000. These various Interest pay- j
ments will call for $4,373,154. These facts make â 
assurance of further ease doubly sure.
"In the mercantile market there is a steady
healthy movement, but none of .the boom that
BomÂ« have expected as a result of the close of
the war. Nor is this surprising, for as the
war produced virtually no Interruption of bus- |
mess, Its end could not be expected to bring \
any boom all at once."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.â Influences affecting . .
, Individual properties furnished the motive* for ,
[to-day 1 Irregular price movement. The bears,
.flushed with their recent successes, attempted
to make It interesting for their opponents at
the outset and effected a break In Tobacco and
Sugar. The latter went down on the announce- ',
- ment of a reduction in grades of the product, j
but heavy supporting orders, turned the mar- I
ket. Subsequently fluctuations were very er- ;
ratic,' In sympathy with the changes elsewhere, j
â  .but the stock rebounded strongly and ended at j
the top. The futile efforts of thÂ« shorts to in- I
flict damage upon the railway list caused the |
â¢traders to range on the long Bide for a turn '.
and bullish sentiment became more marked.
Absorption of the standard dividend stocks has
been in progress lately by interests capable of !
holding them until the' general situation be- I
comes clearer and outside conference regarding ]
â¢the tendency of the money market was. restored, j
Consequently the apparent diminution in the '
floating supply of stock caused a momentary â¢
scramble and values seemed to favor a belief i
that the bears were playing possum, and the
market reached a higher level in order to make '.
â¢the losses more acute. â  Dullness followed the '
â¢ rise and little of Interest developd until aj '
late session, when Tobacco, was savagely at- j
tacked and extensive short lines were put out '
; elsewhere. Tobacco, â¢ which reached a level
fractionally above last night's, slumped several
points to 127% and the market for Rubber and j
aome other stocks was cut away.
â¢ The demoralization in Tobacco forced holders |
to sacrifice their '-*crests elsewhere ,: In order !
to meet the urgent â  demands by commission !
houses for additional- â¢ margins. Reports re
garding the nature of the forthcoming Bur- 'â¢
lington statement added to the break, and large I
: blocks were let go; with resultant severe loss.
The success of the bear party In causing the
general demoralization in Sugar and Tobacco :
caused considerable â  nervousness and uncer
tainty among security holders. The steadiness !
â of the money market during the flurry and the
report that the Government would disburse on I
October- 10 " anticipated â  November ' interest
.amounting to $4,150,000 on. the 3's, 4's and 6.'s j
failed to check the selling movement.
: Final dealings were very feverish, but last
prices ruled about the lowest of the declines, :
exceeding a point, mainly in the. railroads.
Speculation In the railway mortgages was ',
â attended with Increased animation and lower i
''â¢prices. Atchlren adjustments were thrown on
the market in- large volume and closed with a \
net loss of 1% per cent Total sales. $2,800,000! !

: CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 28.â Wheat opened at %Â®%o
â  decline from yesterday's closing price. In
fluenced to some extent by the unfavorable
â  weather, liberal Northwest movement and the
.fact that cables did not show as much strength
i as expected In view of the sharp rally here late
' .yesterday.' It soon developed, however, that
September was in good request and a very
moderate supply, selling up l%c to 70c. The
; advance affected ' the rest of the list, which
; sold up In sympathy. Cash- values In the
i Northwest ruled firm, and this was also a
1 factor. Yesterday's coast business was im-
m ense; 1,240)000 bushels, and exports also made
, a good showing, aggregating 917,000 bushels.
New York- wired that the United Kingdom and
I Continent were buyers to-day and that accept-
I ances were again .fairly - liberal. Foreigners
were 'also credited with purchases In this mar-
I ket. Primary receipts were 324,000 bushels
smaller than a year ago, notwithstanding
1 liberal arrivals in the Northwest. The bearish
i showing of the Liverpool closing cables created
1 a change in sentiment and prices here receded,
although Paris closed s@lo centimes higher.
' September In New York turned weak late in
: the -day, selling off l%e. Duluth also ruled
. easier, declining nearly 10. Local longs liqui
; dated and final quotations here were around the
: bottom prices. December closed at yesterday's
â  figures. ' '
Corn lost all the Improvement of yesterday
i and %o besides. It was chiefly affected by the
| course of the Wheat market.
; Oats were traded in moderately and the mar
ket showed .strength, early prices advancing %
, <& l ,ic over yesterday's close. Weakness de
; veloped later, â¢ however, and prices closed with
j a loss of %@%c on the day.
. Provisions bad against them very heavy re
\ ceipts of hogs, and that, . together with the yel
! low fever reports and 1 shilling decline In the
: price of bacon at Liverpool, caused a heavy
market. Pork declined 12%0, lard 7%c â¢ and
â¢ rib's sc.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Sept. 28.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter says: So far as local trading
Is concerned, the market shows no change
worthy of mention. The money market is fa
vorable and prices for wool are well main
tained. We do not hear of any striking con
cessions. There seems to be nothing for any
one to do except wait for developments.
In the matter of exporting wool our dealers
feel that there Is possibly room for considerable
activity. The wools that are .being exported
are, of course, wools in bond on which the
duty has not been paid. These are mostly di
rect Importations from Australia, although
they Include some wools bought at the London
sales months ago. The sales of the week In
Boston amount to 1,042.000 pounds domestic and
573,000 pounds foreign, against a total of 13,
012.000 for the corresponding week lost year
Sales since January 1, 1898. amount to 85,379 010
pounds, against 304,950,100 pounds last year at
this time.

Judge Wood Decides
Hunter's Suit.
HIS DEPOSIT FORFEITED
STBEET BAILWAY EMPLOYES TO
TEST A CASE,
Oakland Transit Company Gets Judg-
ment in the Suit Over the De
posit to Provide Against
Negligence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 28.
The suit of Robert H. Hunter against
the Central-avenuo Railroad Company
and Oakland Transit Company, a case In
â which motormen and conductors on both
sides of the bay have shown much inter
est, has just been decided by Justice of
the Peace Fred V. Wood in favor of de
fendants.
The case was of particular moment to
street railway employes from the fact
that the point at issue involved the right
of the corporation to hold a deposit
made by the employe as part payment of
damages to a passenger, which the com
pany had to pay.
Hunter was a motorman on the Twelfth
street line, and on November 12, ISJM, de-
I" .-ited with the defendants $25 to secure
them against loss or damage through hia
negligence or carelessness.
On the night of June S last the cars of
defendants collided at the curve at East
Twelfth street and Eighth avenue. A pas
s-. nper on tfae car in charge of Motorman
Hunt and Conductor S. B. Conger sus
tained injuries, for which defendants
â <ver& compelled to pay $150.
The collision was considered a direct j
result of the violation of a rule issued by
- ilroad companies, which requires all ,
cars in rounding the curves to be flagged, j
â¢rnian Hunter claimed the conduc
ild him to go ahead, but this was
ii. n|ed by. Conger. The company there
upon charged the $150 damages to the two
employes. Conger paid $75. -ut Hunter
â  i and was discharged. His $25 de
â  as withheld from him by the com
pany U a forfeiture in part payment of
ire of the damages, the defendants
ri ,ying for the balance upon a surety
company. Hunter then sued for the re"
covery of his $25 deposit.
Judge Wood baped his decision upon the
facts that plaintiff had been guilty of j
negligence in violating the rule requiring ;
<;:rs to do flagged at curves and that the i
?:.") depoÃit waa made purposely to secure
the employers against damage by such !
i â¢ â¢- r l)uenee.
Hunter has given notice to appeal from
Wood's decision, and will make it
a test case.
GEORGE HUNT HAS
BECOME RAVING MAD
ATTEMPTED TO KILL HIS BEST
FBIENDS.

George C. Hunt hiK> become a raving
maniac threatening to kill his best friends,
and needing the constant services of
keepers. This afternoon he was examined
at his house by Drs. Tisdale and Akerly,
as it wa.s impossible to take him to the
Kccieiving Ho-Â»itaJ.
The unfortunate man has boon rapidly
growing worst- since he first gave evidence
of insanity four days ago. and It is now
necessary to keep him In a itraitjacket
to prevent him doing violence to himself
or nls relatives. Although his mania is
greatly developed, the doctors do not be
lieve it is incurable. Hunt unhinged his
mind by making a hysterical campaign
f' r 'Sheriff. He told the examining physi
cians that he was going to be Sheriff
thf-n Qavernor. then President. He de
clared that the Pope had a grudge against
him and was seeking to harm him and
gave every evidence of acute lunacy. He
also lias a homicidal mania and frequently
threatens to kill. He was sent to Agnew's
Asylum this evening.

BOYS, THOU SHALT NOT SMOKE.
Four Small Boys Violate the Oakland Ordi
nance and See the Prison
Walls.
OAKLAND, Sfpt. 28.â "Thnu shnlt not smoke cigarettes," saith the
Oakland decalogue, "or thou wilt suffer the tortures of the flro and smoke
of a subterranean Arizona. ""
The new ordinance which prohibits cigarette smoking by the Infantile
will now be tested for the first time. Tills morning brave Officer Seanlon
captured a desperate band of truants and cigarette smokers on the corner
of Seventh Ftr< >-t near Washington. Seanlon spotted them from afar. The
wind was blowing from the north and coming his way. It was redolent
with the tweet aroma of the cigarette, and the hero with his brass buttons
kruw that thfrr- was something in the air. He glanced fiirtiv y around
and with telescopic vision discovered the quartet on the corner. Three of
the bold, l>ful young men sacrificed their cigarettes and bolted, but the
fourth, who was making a smokestack of himself, just smoked and
smoked. He was captured by fleet-footed Seanlon, as were the others.
At the Central station the quartet of truants gave their names. They
are William Flynn, Harold McCarthy. John Kehoe and Harry Huddy, all
of San Francisco. Truancy was the charge brought against all', but Hud
dy was the boy who stood upon the corner smoking his cigarette when all
the rest had fled. He will be held to answer to the double charge of tru
ancy and cigarette Bmoking. The quartet will be held until called for by
their patents; no storage rates charged.

PREACHERS WAGE WAR OF WORDS.
Before His Methodist Brethren Rev. R. J. Briggs
Seeks Defense Through Recrimination,
Rev. C. L. Lair, Who Was Charpi Will Mal-Ataistratioii.
THE Forty-eighth anunual conference of the Methodist Episcopal
Church South was opened yesterday morning at Asbury Church, Fif
i teenth and Clay streets/Oakland; and if it may be judged from de.vel-
X opmenta that transpired even before organization had been effected
this particular conference will have special prominence in the history of,
the church.
It .is to be a fight to. purge alleged uncleanlineÃS from the ranks of
the ordained and to rid the lay brethren of a leadership said to be more
than adverse to their souls' betterment.
From the opening moment it became apparent that to the trial of
Rev. R. J. Briggs, D. D., upon charges of Immorality all else will be sec
ondary, and It was further evident that the accusers of Dr. Briggs would be
fought with their own weapons. The first of these to flash through the
ministerial atmosphere was a counter-charge preferred against Dr. Briggs'
first accusor. Rev. Dr. C. R. Lamar. The allegations, though kept a close
secret of the trial committee are known to be of almost as much im
port as those against Dr. Briggs, but with charges of mal-administratlon
added.
The conference was opened by Bishop E. R. Hendrieks, who for the
first time addressed in convention the ministers of his diocese. His talk
was short and led directly up to the business of the day.
Holdover reports were read and the work of forming the many neces
sary committees was hri?un. The names of M. Gruell, L. J. Harges and A.
L. Hunaker were referred to the committee to be retired from active
work. The following superanuates were reported as having died since the
last conference: D. M. Rice, B. C. Howard, B. F. Burris and Q. W. New
ton.
The following were admitted to the conference by transfer:
J. J. Kenny. James Il^xley, Claude Davenport, J. R. fcawyer, Steven E. Wilson â¢
and I. F. Betts. i
The following wenÂ» received on trial in a traveling connection, to be orflalned '
ministers after probation: T. Q. Patterson, Todd Clark, L.. Russell, E. J. Patre and :
J. B. Needham. :

erts and I. T. Bell, whose terms have expired, were succeeded by P. T. Kamaley
and J. S. Ryd*n.
When reports were mentioned Chairman. Hendrieks immediately de
manded the report of the committee that lias conducted the preliminary ex
amination into the charges against Dr. Briggs. In reply G. R. Lamar said
that the committee, of which he was chairman, had found the charges so
well based that they could only recommend that a jury be drawn and the
trial at once begun.
At this Rev. C. R. Carpenter, church counsel for Dr. Briggs, quickly
took the floor and, with no kindness in his eye for his client's accuser, de
manded that a jury be Impaneled at once. He announced that Dr.
Briggs, though not present, was ready and waiting for his vindication. '
Then, came the sensation of. the day in the shape of serious counter
charges against Dr. Lamar. To those of the conference Dr. Cooper's an
nouncement that his charges were fully as severe as those preferred
against his client was as unexpected as would have been a decision of the
investigating committee to drop for good and all the Brings matter. .â¢
Dr. Carpenter started to read his charges but was quickly stopped by
Bishop Ilendricks, who declared him out of order because of having failed
to announce his Intention to the man he accused.
"I announce it to him now, then," shouted Dr. Carpenter and pre
pared to read on, but during the turmoil that ensued Bishop Hendricks
quietly took charge of the doctor's papers and the incident ended.
The trial committee was then told off and at 4 o'clock they went into
secret session to give their first consideration to the case against Dr
Briggs. . :â¢'-"
The committee is composed as follows:
George Hall, Christopher C. Black, J. F". Roberts, C. O. Steele "W A

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 28.
After a few weeks of gentlemanly for
bearance toward each other the Board of
Works had Its periodical quarrel this
morning-. It was all over a trifle â a mere
$80 job â but It served to show that the
feeling which has existed for nearly two
years is as bitter as ever.
. There are two little sheds on the j city
wharf, and it is the duty of the Board of
Works to have them painted. The Coun
cil appropriated $90 for the job, and this
morning a resolution was passed award
ing the contract to J. W. Montgomery.
City Attorney Dow submitted a proposi
tion from a man named Chapman, but as
it contained no figures Secretary Thomas
was not intending to read it. Dow caved
for it and it was read, but as It specified
no price the Mayor and the City Engineer
voted against It.
' Mayor Thomas then called for F. M.
Farwell's bid, which was for $90, and sur
prised Mr. Dow by voting with Mr. Clem
ent to beat it.
Montgomery appeared in person and of
fered to do the work for $80. Dow claimed
that the offer was not a Old, but the
Mayor said It was all right. â¢..
"I do not approve Â©f this," said Mr.
Dow. "One bidder goes out and brings a
man- here to say what he will do the
work for, and there is a disposition to
give it to him. This matter ought to go
over till we can get lower offers."
"I am ready to vote for this man Mont
gomery," said the Mayor. "My. man Far
well won't do the work for that figure." .
Then Mr. Dow, was ruffled.
"Some others, perhaps, will do it for
less," said he. "This is a matter that
you and Clement want to gobble as you
gobble up everything you get your hands
on."
The* Mayor laughed and walked indig
nantly out of the room.
"I am not gobbling up anything that I
know of," said Clement.
"You try to gobble every small thing
that comes up," retorted Dow.
His Honor then returned.
â  "I am not out for the small stuff like
come of you," said Dow. ?,â¢ 'â :>â 
"Then what on earth are you kicking
about?" asked Clement. ' "I am not out
for any kind of stuff, small' or other
wise.'* '

IN AID OF ST. PATRICK'S CHURCH
How Time Flew Among the Booths and the Crowds.
HOW much am I offered for Col
onel Andrews? Come, girls, he's
all gold and a yard wide â I mean
he's all wool and 18 caratsâ oh,
you know what I mean, girls; he's
all right. Isn't somebody going to
give me a bid? No? Well, colonel,
step down. I guess you are In the
discard."
It was down in the large hall in
the basement of St. Patrick's
Church on Mission street. Governor
Budd had informally inaugurated the
St. Patrick's parish fair in the pres
ence of a crowd that, big as the hall
was, was like sardines in a box; it
would have been an utter impossibility
for another soul to gain entrance.
The Governor, aeompanied by Ad
jutant General Barrett and Colonels
Andrews, Young, Peck and Plppy of
his staff, arrived just at 8 o'clock,
their entrance into the hall being
marked by a merry chime of the
church bells. The party wan es
corted to the stage by P. Devany,
chairman of the committee of ar
t rangements, W. A. Breslln and P. J.
Tomilty.
At the conclusion of a happy ad
dress, which was frequently inter
rupted by applause and laughter, the
Governor picked up a bunch of beau
BUNTING IS
PRONOUNCED
A GREAT GAME
Every Player Should
Now Practice It.
THE BALTIMORE'S EXPERTS
THEY WIN MANY GAMES BY ITS
USE.
A Player Who Is Not Capable of
Bunting a Ball Should
Retire From the
Game.
By Joe Corbett.
Bunting the ball is an art yet to be ac
complished by the players of the Recrea
tion Park League.
This conclusion I have reached after
carefully watching those men who have
been ambitious enough to attempt it; and
these, by the way, have been very few.
Thrre is no prettier game, no more
scientific Kame, than that of bunting. It
Is a part of our great national game, ac
quired only after unremitting practice,
and then it is a useless game if the man
employing it be not a hrst-class batter
in every conceivable sense.
Keeler of the Baltlmores, who led the
National League batters last season, and
Burkett of the Clevelands. who led this
same organization the two years preced
ing, are masters of the "bunting game."
Thin qualification and their ability to hit
the ball enables them to stand foremost
among the great batsmen of the major
league.
It will be r< adily seen then that, to be
â what Is termed a great batter, bunting is
most necessary. There are in the major
league excellent batters like Lajoie and
Delahanty of the "Phillle.s," who, I dare
Bay, could not bunt a ball properly once
in twenty attempts, but these men are
exceptions, and if â¢ they couÂ»d master
bunting I have no doubt but what their
averages would increase greatly.
The ldenl batter, however, is the one
that can hit a ball just as well as bunt it.
Players In the Recreation Park League
do not realize the importance of bunting,
and therefore seldom practice It, and in
to doing commit quite a serious mistake.
T&ka Keeler for instance. He steps to
tiful red roses and essayed the role
of auctioneer on behalf of the worthy
cause. Colonel Andrews opened the
bidding with an offer of $10 and was
quickly raised to $15. The gallant
colonel was game, however, and
finally obtained the coveted nosegay
for Â£iO. When he stepped forward to
receive his purchase Governor Budd
formally presented Colonel Andrews
to the throng, and while he was bow-
Ing his acknowledgments the Gover
nor attempted to auction him off, but
with indifferent success.
Later on Colonel Andrews mounted
the block and sold his bunch of roses
for $v, netting a total of $35 for them.
Of course, the fair was a financial
and artistic success. That was as
sured before ever the doors were
opened. Perhaps the crowd was a lit
tle too dense for the pretty girls to
get around comfortably, but they
managed to dispose of a vast num
ber of tickets, and when the fair doses
three weeks from now. Governor Budd
Is going to find himself the winner
of a beautiful yellow satin sofa pil
low, tastefully embroidered, on which
are pome pink trees, a green sky and
a flock of blue lambs gamboling over
the old rose grass. It's a beauty,
and when the Governor gets that
gouty foot of his comfortably settled
oh it political cares will be forgotten
and a blessing will go up for thi girls
who sold it to him.
It happened this way: After the
speechmaking and . the auctioneering
the bat, and the opposing infield, know-
Ing him to be a hunter and batter, are in
a quandary as to what he will do. The
first ball pitched he will try to bunt and
fail. The Infield draws closer to him, es
pecially the third baseman, who must
come in very close, as Keeler moves fast
toward first base, and every fraction of a
second counts. Now that he has the in
field playing him for a bunt, his chances
for a hit are better. He may swing at
the next ball and miss it. This change of
tactics is surprising to the infield, and
they naturally conjecture as to what he
will do next.
Now that he has them guessing he does
whatever he deems expedient. Snould the
third baseman be still playing close, he
will hit the ball hard in that direction.
There is no time for this man to consider
how ho will play that ball. He simply
grabs, and nine times out of ten the ball
will hit him on the shins or chest, and
either bound out of reach or go by him
entirely, and in either case Keeler is
credited with a hit by reason of the rule
that "the ball was too hard to handle."
There is, therefore, a great advantage
in being able to b-unt, and hit with equal
precision, and no batter should ever con
sider himself half perfect until he is able
tc bunt.
Again bunting is most necessary whero
a team is playing the sacrilice game. Not
many days past I saw a batter at Recrea
tion Park, during a game, try his utmost
to advance runners from first and second
to the next cushions. He made an in
glorious failure, after two attempts, and
â¢then hit the ball out. It went in tho
air and was captured. The next man up
singled and one run crossed the plate.
Now, if the first individual had been aJWe
to bunt and advance those runners, two
runs would have crossed the plate on that
hit. Fortunately his inability did not
prove dangerous, as the score was wry
one-sided, yet time and again a situation
will present itself in a game \Viere the
only play is to bunt, and if a player is
lacking In this qualification a game might
easily be thrown away.
This same bunting game has other ad
vantages of equal importance. Some
pitchers cannot field a bunted ball, and
Rusie, the great star of the National
League, is of this class.
He was well nigh invincible aga-i.oc the
Baltimore team until one day McGraw
bunted his mighty shoots and beat the
ball to first with ease. It was noticed by
the manner Rusie handled the bunt that
he did not like it, and from then on fhe
Baltimore team won their games from
him principally by bunting, and every
man in this team Is taught to bunt, the
pitcher included. I could not do much in
this regard, but I could bunt well enough
to advance runners when necessary, and
very little more is expected of a pitcher,
whereas every other player in the Balti
more team must know how to bunt and
bunt well. This they accomplished by
practicing every day for an hour, and
numerous are the games they have won
through its application.
Batters should, therefore, endeavor to
perfect themselves in this art. There are
many pitchers and third-base men who
are too nervous to field a bunt success
fully. Then, again, pitchers, as a general
rule, do not like their shoots to be bunt
ed. It Jceeps them on the move, and they
are veTy often at a loss as to the proper
ball to pitch.
My advice to players wishing to be
come ideal batsmen Is to continually
practice bunting. It takes plenty of time
to perfect one's self in tho art, yet wnen
accomplished a big batting percentage is
positively assured. I must also insist that
every player should be able to bunt well

were over, the guests of the evening
started to make a tour of the booths.
The girls eyed his Excellency with
ndmiratlon almost amounting to ven
eration. Finally one of them, with a
full n-allzatinn of what she was there
for, braced up and asked him to buy
a ticket for a sofa pillow. He bought
five .and the girl rushed off to toll her
Bister of her success. The sister tried
her hand and the Governor was soon
the possessor of five more tickets.
Then girl No. 1 got her chum to
"work him, and after, she had re
turned with a new four-bit piece the
original sharper took another try. She
was as successful as before, and so
those three took turns in selling Budd
tickets in bunches of five, and never
let up until he had every ticket issued
for that article in his pocket.
The band of the League of the Cross
Cadets was in attendance and enliv
ened the evening with patriotic and
popular selections. Registrar Blggy
was there running a wheel of fortune,
and there were others.
Eighteen gorgeously decorated
booths are arranged around the walls,
having for sale everything from, a
toothpick to a trolley car. Besides,
there is a refreshment stand, shoot
ing gallery and the animatoscope,
showing many moving pictures of the
war and other scenes.
If last night's receipts may be taken
as a criterion, the three weeks of the
fair will net ample money to meet the
needs of the parish.
enough to sacrifice. In fact, a player who
cannot sacrifice should retire from the
game, as he is in the way of those play
ers who can, and it looks bad to see a
man walk to the plate and fall to ad
vance runners, because he never tried to
learn bunting.
PRAISE FOR GOLDEN GATE PARK
Grand Jury Commends the Park Commis
sioners and Makes Recommendations.
That the local Grand Jury is appreciative of the constant Improve
ments being wrought In the people's play grounds by the present Board
of Park Commissioners is apparent by the lengthy and laudatory commun
ication addressed to the board yesterday. The document commends the;
work of the board and its servants, and recommends a numb'T of im
provements, which, if carried out, will add further charm to the beautiful
pleasure spot.
At the outset the Grand Jury expresses a hope that its recommenda
tions will be adopted so that when that body makes its final report It can
reiterate the encomiums that are heard on all sides of the conscientious
care and interest the Commissioners hn.ve taken in the park, which, is
now equal to the best in the cities on the Atlantic seaboard.
The Grand Jury recommends that the mounted police remain in force, as
a credit to the park; that the foot police be furnished with bicycles and
do all patrol duty on the wheel so that more ground can be covered, insur
ing the safety of ladies and timid cyclists against reckless riders.
Attention is called to the large number of wheelmen that visit the park
dally, and of the urgent necessity of keeping the bicycle path in good re
pair. The board Is asked to preserve such path free from small stones,
rolled with cement dust and watered in order that it may be made as
perfect a road as asphaltum.
The latter recommendation will probably meet tho approbation of the
Park Commissioners, as the authors of the communication concluslvely
show that there are 000 bicycle taxpayers to every one team driver, and
that, collectively, over 23,000 wheelmen visit Golden Gate Park.
It is also suggested that at the present bicycle rest the Commission
ers erect a substantial two-story rustic cottage, not unlike the boathouse,
of at least 100 feet frontage, by thirty-five feet in depth, with a broad ver
anda nearly level to the ground in front. One portion of the interior to
be devoted to the convenience of ladles. Independent of the gentlemen's
quarters, with a lady attendant in charge. The sale of refreshments of a
light kind would derive sufficient revenue to easily support this much de
sired and necessary convenience.
As the sick and convalescent visit the park to partake of its balmy
atmosphere, and must sit down by the roadway to rest, it is recommended
that at least 1000 benches similar to those donated to the park by the Mid
winter Fair should be ordered at once and placed throughout the grounds.
It was also recommended that a system of electric alarms be estab
lished along the main drive so that, when necessary, an ambulance can bo
called for or the officers on duty notified of an approaching runaway. In
concluding its interesting communication the Grand Jury makes the follow
ing statement:
'This Grand Jury, as a whole, have seriously opposed the acquirement
of more land for park purposes, excepting it be east of Van Ness avenue,
or, in other words, in the crowded districts. We now have more park
space than the cities of 2,000,000 inhabitants and over, and the climate of
this peninsula has enough wind-swept lands at all times to insure breah
ing space for all the souls born in a thousand years. Care and devotion
to the high cultivation, which is now being done to make these once sand
dunes smile with evergreen foliage and rare plants will fully occupy the
McLaren parent and progeny a number of decades to come."
The document is signed by Chairman A. J. Rich, C. W. Tabor and Rob
ert Coulter and approved by M. H. Hecht.
LEES TURNS
COUNSEL FOR
THE DEFENSE
Would Help Widber in
His Legal Fight.
A CHANGE OF ATTITUDE
FIGHT NOW ON REGARDING THE
CONFESSION.
â¢
The Chief Says That When It Was
Made the Defaulter Was In
toxicated and Generally
Non Compos.
Isaiah L?es. Chief of Police, jurist and
attorney at law, has appointed himself
counsel for the defense In the Wldber
caae. When "Widber was arrested Isaiah
was among those determined that Justice
should be meted out to the defaulter.
He even went so iar as to see that the
names of those who arrested the ex-
Treasurer should never appear of record
and he assumed the responsibility of ar
resting officer. Then when Widber made
his confession of guilt Lees held It up to
the world as an example of his prowess
in opening the lips of criminals. Now he
is endeavoring to establish the conten
tion that Widber was drunk, out of his
head, under the Influence of an opiate and
generally non compos when he acknowl
edged the theft of $100,000, or so, and. in
consequence, his confession is a worthless
document in the haodo of the prosecu-
tlon.
Tuesday afternoon the prosecution en
deavored to get the confession of the de
faulter before the Jury, but. a storm of
objections from the defense met the effort.
It was claimed that the confession was
obtained by inducements offered the pris
oner, and the defense, when the case
opened yesterday, endeavored to estab
lish this allegation.
Judge Troutt was the first witness
called. Judge Troutt was present with
Mayor Phelan when Widber made his
confession In the oilice of Lees. The wit
ness denied that any threats had been
made or inducements held out to the pris
oner to induce him to make a confession.
Jerome Deasy, superintendent of the dia
mond mine, in which "Widber was inter
ested, was the next witness. He stated
that in answer to a telephone message re
ceived from the Treasurer's office on April
IS he came to the city. He found Widber
lying on his lounge in his private office
in a maudlin condition. Widber stated
that he was short $f>ooo by the substitu
tion of gold for silver in one of the sacks
in the vault. Deasy advised him to make
the shortage good and the defaulter stat
ed that as he was responsible he would
follow the advice.
Next came the Caief of all the police.
He stated that when Widber was before
him and made the confession he showed
the effects of liquor and looked like a man
who had Just come out of a long de
bauch. Widber seemed to be dazed, de
pressed and otherwise unstrung. D. C.
Murphy, who took shorthand notes in the
Chief's office of Widoer's admission, stat
ed that the prisoner seemed wen led and
anxious. Detective Tody, and In fact all
witnesses connected In any way with the
office of the Chiei of Police, were of tho
opinion that the contention of the Chief
that Widber was not mentally responsi
ble for anything he said was correct. This
distracted the prosecution, but it bright
ened up after Auditor Broderlck, the last
witness, had left the stand.
Tho Auditor testified that Widber look
ed dazed, jaded and tired out. He stated
in answer to many questions that he
would rather not answer them, which
showed that he was mentally capable of
caring for himself.
The witness was th^n asked by the
court: "Was any threat or Inducement
offered the prisoner to make the confes
sion?" Attorney Pelxotto objected to the
question, but the court promptly over
ruled it, and witness answered that none
had been. Attorney Pelxotto then wanted
to argue the matter, but the court refused
to listen to argument, stating that his
mind regarding the. admisslhlllty of the
confession was made up, but he allowed
the defense to cite authorities In substan
tiation of its holding. that the confession
cannot be legally admitted.
Friday, when the case goes on again,
the defense will endeavor to establish that
Widber was suffering from the after-ef
fects of an opiate when he made, the con
fession, but the prosecution, after the
statements of the court, is confident that
the confession will bo admitted and Wid
ber's guilt established by his own admis
sion. / â

The story of the detectives and Hun
faker is as follows: Carrie Walton, the
in thi he , cas e. married Frank Taylor
In this city in the month of August, 1592.
nVw 1 " . now a ba rkeeper in Vallejo, and
will be introduced to prove the case of
the contestants. In June of this rear
her deposition was taken and she con
cealed the fact of this marriage to Tav
lor. A^ hen she discovered that the attor
neys of the opposition knew of her union
with Taylor she then had recourse to a
story about seeing an article in the pa
pers which reported a wreck of a bark
entine on which her husband had sailed
According to her story all the crew w;is
reported lost. Her testimony in the dep
osition shows that she could not recollect
the name of the vessel, the captain or
any of the crew. She also stated that
after she read of the loss of the ship on
which her husband had sailed to his
death she made inquiries of the Lynde-
Hough Company of this city and was in
formed there that the news was true.
Lawrence Noonan, the president of the
Lynde - Hough Company, admits that
Carrie had called at his office, but he
says that she was informed that her hus
band had sailed on the barkentine J. H. I
Falkenberg, and that she left a letter to '
be delivered to him upon his return. A
month after this she married one Swee- ;
ney In Los Angeles. This was in May,
1897. In December of the same year Car- i
rie Walton married McDermott. Prevl- .
ous to her marriage with Taylor she was
united in the sacred bonds or matrimony
with Frank Walton, who was her first
venture.
The attorneys have no trace of Swee
ney, but they claim to have found Tay
lor, and on this they will build their case
to wrest the $10,000 from the much
spoused lady which McDermott has left
her.

The usual serenity that surrounds the
proceedings in Judge Low's court was
suddenly disturbed yesterday morning
when it was ascertained that the com

Smith, with four others, met Chew Sing,
Â» Chinese fruit peddler, on Twentieth' an 1

r.nd unceremoniously stood him up ami
relieved him of $13. The assault was wit
nessed by Rev. Mr. Kilgrew from his win
dow at 3416 Twentieth street, and he gave
the alarm. The sudden interruption
frightened the highwaymen and attracted
the attention of the police, and they ar
rested Ed and James Terry, Louis Cuneo
and another young man named Carr. In
the meantime Charles Smith made his
escape by jumping fences and secreting
himself in the railroad sheds until he
boarded an outgoing freight train and
lade his way to Castroville, where he re
ied until last week. Then he returned

LOVER TO THE
FROZEN NORTH
Mad Infatuation of a Married
Woman for a Kotzebue
Gold Hunter.
Mrs. Hermann Stowed Herself Away on the
Northern Light and Is Now a Cook
for Her Sweetheart.
The bark Northern Light got hack froro
Kctzi.-bue Bound yesterday. Sne is thj
first cf Lho fleet to return that left hero
for the gold fields on the Kubucl: River
five months ago. and tho people who
came bnck on her bring all kinds of
news. There are tales of disaster ond
tragedy, of Masted hopes and good for
tune; a love story with a problematical
ending, ana many sudden deaths. Of iho
1500 people who rushed to Kotzebue in
search of a fortune twenty-nine are sa'.d
to have lost their lives in the treacher
ous waters of the Kubuck River. Strange
to tay, not one of the men who came
down on the Northern Light can tell
the names of those who perished. All
they can tell is that a launch was sunk
in such and such a place; a landslide
covered a boat at another point on the
river, while yet another launch struck
a snag and went down with all hands.
Thoso who came back on the Northern
Light were: A. O. Liudsey, C. E. Gor
don. G. W. Pickett, J. G. Williams,
Charles Gleaves, C. T. Le Mare, Dr. E.
A. Robinson, H. Mather, \V. Scott, J.
Blumer, J. P. Larkin, T. Johnston, C. A.
Haehl, C. E. Watson, W. L. Rockwell,
A. L. Vincent, E. S. Guiterrez, L. E.
Easton, W. W. Gurgles, Captain W. F.
Johnston of the schooner Louisa D, L.
W. Johnston and Walter Johnston. Of
these L>r. Robinson and T. Johnston went
up on The Northern Light. They did not
like the prospects and returned. The
other passengers (148 all told) decided to
remain and try their luck. Mate Tilton
of the Northern Light asserts that not
more than seventy-rive gold hunters out
of the 15U0 who went up will return with
the fleet. Color was struck in a num
j ber of places, but nothing great. While
I tho Haynes party from Los Angeles were
; awaiting the arrival of their provisions
they bored down into the soil, and at the
lirst attempt brought up a nugget.
However, the love story comes first.
Charles W. Baumann was formerly a
member of the Pacific Coast Co-operative
Cigar Manufacturing Company. Whfle
living at the New Washington "Hotel he
formed the acquaintance of a Mrs. Her
mann, a handsome young married woman.
She iel! madly In love with "Charley,"
and finally made his life miserable with
her attentions. In order to escape her he
sold out his interest in the cigar fac
tory and quietly took passage on the bark
Alaska for Kotzebue. Everything was
kept very quiet, and Charley got away
without Mrs. Hermann knowing any
thing about it.
A few days after the Alaska had sailei
Mrs. Hermann discovered the flight of
her lover. She went to Captain White
side of the Northern Light and with
tears in her eyes told of her husband
having deserted her and their little child
in order to reach the new El Dorado.
She told of the sale of his business and
flight on the Alaska, and begged for a
passage to Kotzebue. Captain White
side made some inquiries on the outside
and refused the lovesick lady a passage.
Ho was not to get rid of her so easily,
however.
Three days after the Northern Light
got to sea it was reported to the captain
that the vessel was leaking. The pumps
were sounded, and Capain Whlteside
found the bark was making water fast.
The story of the three auger holes in the
bow of the ship and their location by
Mate Tilton has already been told exclu
sively in The Call, but his other find has
not yet been made public.
Stowed away in a snug little nest among
the cargo was Mrs. Hermann. She was
well supplied with food and water but
nearly dead from seasickness and her
cramped position. She told Captain
Whiteside when brought on deck that she
would kill herself if she was not taken
along. Once when Baumann tried to dis
card her she nearly killed him. so she
said, and twice she attempted suicide be
cause he would not love her with all his
heart and soul. Life held no pleasure for
her apart from Charley, so whether he

THE OFFICER TELLS OF HIS EX
PERIENCE AT SANTIAGO.
Impressions of a California Soldier
' Narrated to the Ladies of the
Forum Club.
The Forum Club gave another charm
ing reception and entertainment yester
day in Sherman & clay Hall on Sutter
street, Mrs. F. L. Whitney presiding.
Mrs. J. P. Young received the members
and guests as they arrived. After the
regular business of the organization was
transacted Sidney Drew, the actor, read
an interesting paper upon his experience
at a benefit in a small theater in the West
End of London. He also recited a couple
of short poems, which were well appre
ciated. A cornet solo by Louis Harrison
received much applause. An interesting
address was given by Samuel Shortridge
on "The Late War With Spain,"in which
he advocated the holding of the Philip
pine Islands. Just before refreshments
were announced Lieutenant L. M. Welch
formerly of the Twenty-fourth United
States Infantry but now of the Twen
tieth, told of his experience before Santi
ago, Cuba.
Lieutenant Welch is the son of the well
known Dr. Welch of this city. The youne
man is a graduate of West Point, and at
the breaking out of the war he was with
his regiment at Fort Worth. Utah In
his address tho young soldier made no at
tempt at oratory, but told In an unaffect
ed manner of what he had seen and
heard His style of narration quickly
found favor with his audience. At times
the humorous side of army scenes was
presented in a way that shows that a sol
dier can appreciate fun as well as light
ing. His address took the form of a run
ning narrative of what happened from
the time his regiment broke camp to the
time that he was laid low on the battle
field of Santiago with that dread disease
yellow fever, which made his return to
civilization necessary. Of the movements
of the army, the quickness and dispatch
in doing things the lieutenant spoke in
the highest praise.
The reception of the soldiers at Tampa
Florida, ho Raid was nothing like that
given to those who came to San Fran
cisco. Here they were well cared for by
the citizens, but there they were regarded
as a legitimate prey. Prices were doubled
for all articles of trade, and it was not
long before shop-keepers who had pre
viously been barely making a living were
rolling in money and overbearing in man
ner.
For the Cubans proper Lieutenant
Welch has but little respect. They seem
to have but two ambitionsâ to steal and
eat, and to avoid work as though it was
another form of 'yellow jack."
In contrast to his opinion of the na
tives of Cuba the young officer has thr
highest respect for the army mule, which
is a hero, carrying ammunition and food
into the very heart of the fighting, liv
ing on what he could get, and never com
plaining. The conduct of the Spanish
sharpshooters j n disregarding all rules of
civilized warfare In shooting wounded
soldiers and Red Cross nurses was de
nounced by the American. It was a mat
ter of the deepest regret of Lieutenant
Welch that he should haveÂ»been attacked
liked ft or not Captain Whiteside had to
ta^e her along.
Now, the Alaska, although she left
before the Northern Light, had to step
at St. Lawrence Island -to build a river
boat. So the Northern Light was the
first to reach Kotzebue Sound. When
Charley stepped ashore, therefore, at the
new El Dorado, Mrs. Hermann was there
to greet him. Absence must have made
the heart grow fonder, for when the
Northern Light left the Sound twenty
eight days ago Mrs. Hermann had been
installed as cook of Charley's camp, and
â ;ill went merry as a marriage bell."
Mrs. Hermann's husband and child are
still in San Francisco.
Mate Tilton of the Northern Light is
the man who performed the marvelous
feat of walking across Alaska in the dead
of winter with news from the imprisoned
whalers at Point Barrow. In talking
about the Kotzeuue Sound rush he said:
"Nearly all the people who went up
there will remain all winter. About
seventy-five men have got cold feet and
will come back wth taÂ»es of hard luck,
but I believe that many of those who
have remained behind will strike it rich.
The Haynes and Lane parties were satis
fied with the prospects. John Tallant of
the Tallant Banking Company and a
party of six went up the Buckland River
and I think will do well. Mr. Tallant was
in good health.
"A boat from the bark Mermaid, con
taining six men, capsized, and the men
were lost. -. search party was sent out,
but all that they recovered was the boat
and some of the men's clothing. Two
men from the steamer Grace Dollar were
making their way up the Kubuck River
in a boat when a landslide came down
anu covered the small craft. One oÂ£ the
men escaped by jumping overboard, but
the other was buried. One launch was
run ashore and wrecked, another sank,
and her boilers were pulled out in trying
to raise her. Three or four were swamped
owir.g to overloading, and !n every in
stance the loss of the boat was attended
with the loss of life. Captain Weeks got
tlrrd of tne Mermaid venture and is com
ing down on the Jane A. Falkenberg, and
Captain Johnson of the Louisa D also
'reneged' on the game and came back
"The Jane A. Falkenberg, Catherine Sud
den, Mermaid, Alaska and Louisa D were
all at Kotzebue when .we left, but were
gt-tting ready for a start. Captain Cogan
was to go whaling in tho Alaska and will
not get home until November. The Mer
maid was to go to St. Michael and the
other vessels are coming to Pan Fran

Peter Laflin, purser of the Northern
Light, was left behind at Kotzebue
bound. He went aphore to attend to some
private business, and a fair wind spring
ing up in the meantime the captain nut
to sea without him. Whiteside says that
under the same circumstance he would
not have waited for his mother. Latlln
will probably come, down on the Catherine
BUaden.
The passonegers. who came down on the
Northern Light say that there is no gold
in the Kotzebue Sound country Every
body, according to their statements "is

on the beach up there than they are in

in their determination to press an inves
tigation by the number of communica
tions which they have received from par
ties in and out of the State,. The follow
ing Is a letter from Boston, and is a fair
representative of all the communications
received:
BOSTON. Mars., Sept. 16, 1898
To the State Board of Railroad Commission
ers of California: Inclosed clipping taken this
morning from a Boston paper. When a com
pany with a surplus nearly as large as their
capital, making big money every year, paying
fat dividends and adding to their surplus every
year also, employ the.r porters at \\Z to $25 per
month with the understanding, tacit IT not im
plied, that the public must tip them or not be
served, I think It Is time to coll a holt
Am glad you have taken this matter up, and
trust you will press it to a successful termina
tion. I wish every State in the Union would
follow suit.
I am not a socialist or anarchist, only a na
tive Bostonian, but I am weary of being among
those who are imposed upon by corporations
Yours very respectfully. D. W. KIMBALL,,

WHISKY AND
FORGETFULNESS
Mrs. Margaret Shields Makes a Bungling At
tempt at Suicideâ Saved by Mrs. Botkin.
Thinks That Beacon Alone Should
t HALF of ten cents' worth of
l\ whisky" was the only com-
J~\ fort, the sole consolation, Mrs.
â *â  â¢*â¢ Margaret Shields, the bungling
Incendiary, longed for yester
day. Her head ached, her body was
worn and tired and she suffered all
the pangs and physical tortures
that alcohol alone could assuage. A
small tumbler of- the coveted spirits
swallowed straight, surely and
steadily, with every evidence of
gratification, and the nerve-racked
woman lay back on her narrow
white cot to woo the sleep that had
persistently held aloof for nearly
ninety hours.
At 4 yesterday morning ;he fire
queen made a clumsy attempt tv
reach the shores of the "undiscov
ered country" by means of a hand
towel, which she had fastened firm
ly round her neck. The heavy
breathing of the would-be suicide
woke her cellmate. Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin, and she. with the matron,
Mrs. Casey, went to the sufferer's
assistance. Mrs. Shields was quickly
restored to this sphere of woe and
suffering and transferred to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where she rested
all day yesterday.
There is nothing attractive nor
prepossessing about the woman who
calmly admits that she committed
arson "to get moneyâ the insurance
of course." The seriousness of the
charge against her, the awful crin.e
of which she is accused, leave her
cold, hard and indifferent as to the
grave punishment that raav ensue.
She appears to be thoroughly ir
responsible. Beacom lit the match
and, according to his accomplice,
Beacom is the guilty one. the man
to whom the rigid penalties for
arson are to be meted out.
In discussing her terrible crime,
Mrs bhields makes no attempt at
concealment. The facts, as she re
calls them, do not. impress her with
the full measure of their hideous
ness. "Beacom made a botch of it,"
she says and therein to the pris
oner lies the only crime.
She has no tears, no bewailings no
vain regrets. The thought of the
suffering of her children brings the
hard lines round her large coarse
mouth and her gray eyes snap de
fiance, as she mumblingly reiter
ates; I don't care about my chil
dren. They're old enough; let them
look out for themselves; they say
they will never see me again. May
be they are right. I don't care!"
It required no persuasion, no dip
lomatically administered coaxing to
induce Mrs. Shields to give her
crime in detail for publication
From Sunday night until Tuesday
evening, when she voluntarily sur
rendered herself, the woman wan
dered about the streets, and the
constant strain left her mind fagged
out. though her strong body was
comparatively fresh and rested It
was with difficulty that she kept her
attention to the point of her story
and the details of her offense were
Interpolated with groans of anguish
as she complainde about the terri
ble pain in her head.
'7, di^? ft t0 Set the insurance mon
ey, Mrs. Shields said. "Henry
Beacom and I had been talking it
over for more than seven months.
I he house was Insured for $2100, and
Beacom was to receive $100 and all
the furniture if he made a good job
of It. If not, he was only to get
the furniture. Bcacom was build
ing a house and he wanted my man
tel and folding doors very much for
his place; so he carried them away
"Two weeks before the fire wo
took Beacom's wife into our confi
dence. First she objected, but grad
ually we won her around, and on
Saturday night when we carried
out the furniture she lent us her
assistance. My. how we worked in
all that rain. Beacom gave us one
dollar, and we went and bought
some whisky to keep up our cour
age. Beacom took an ax and a
hammer to break off the mantel
shelf, and his wife handed him the
tools while I held the light. Lillie
Mullins knew all about the fire, but
she would not help us. She cried
and begged us not to do it.
THE CHINESE SLAVES.
Twenty-Three Remanded for the
Present to the Custody of
the Missions.
Of the twenty-six Chinese slaves ar
rested by Federal officers in the raid last
Tuesday three were released yesterday on
the presentation of the registration cer
tificates by their putative husbands. The
remaining twenty-three were taken before
United States District Judge de Haven
and identified. The Judge ordered that
pending their examination they should be
confined in the Presbyterian Chinese Mis
sion Home on Sacramento street and ihe
Methodist Mission Home on Washington
street.
The women were taken from the court
room to two express wagons in waiting
before the Sansome-street entrance to the
Appraiser's building, and Into these they
were loaded.
One of the women is a slave dealer and
will be prosecuted for that offense.
Mrs. Fennell's Suit Filed.

Suffer.
"Beacom got the cans of coal oil,
opened them up with an ax and put
the match to it. I never set them
off; so you see he is the puilty one.
We put the cans on the side of the
house because I did not wish to
harm the neighbors. There is no
body hurt, so I don't see where is
all the harm.
"I needed the insurance money to
make up for my losses at the race
track. I got to going on 'ladies'
free day,' lost money and went
again to try and get it back."
Mrs. Shields told her story with
many interruptions, in which she
piteously begged for "a half of 10
cents' worth of whisky" to put her
to sleep. "If I had the whisky I
know I could go to sleep," she
said. "The trouble with me is that
I am crazy, but I am not so crazy
that I don't know it."
Of her attempted suicide Mrs.
Shields declares that she remem
bers nothing-. "When I left my
home on Sunday night," .she ex
plained, "I went hunting for the
bay to drown myself. Finally I met
Mrs. McLnuerhlln" and asked -her
where the bay was, and she brought
me here to the prison."
On the promise of a potion of
whisky Mrs. Shields sat up in bed,
turned her â  face to the light and
let the artist make a sketch of her.
"All the ladies on the hill," she
said, "have had their pictures in
the paper." .
The coveted whisky was brought.
Mrs. Shields took it, sighed a deep,
contented sigh and tears gathered
in her stupid eyesâ the only tears
that moistened them during the
entire interview; tears of content
ment for the pleasure the whisky
afforded her.
Without the knowledge or consent
of Fire Marshal Towe Mrs. Shields
was taken before the Insanity Com
missioners yesterday morning for
examination. Dr. Wadsworth.ques
tioned the woman at some -.* length
and announced that 'â  he could not
discover any evidence of insanity,
although she was undoubtedly labor-
Ing under mental excitement and
exhaustion.
â  At this point Judge Hebbard asked
If the woman was charged with any
offense, and on being told that there
was a charge of arson pending
against her ordered further proceed
ings stopped. -
"This is a matter for the trial
Judge and a jury to pass upon," he
said. "The woman is charged with
a felony and must ; stand trial. - It
is for a jury to decide whether she is
a responsible person."
That ended the - examination, and
Mrs. Shields was taken back to the
hospital.' r,:
Henry Beacons, the alleged accom
plice of Mrs. Shields in setting fire
to the Virginia-avenue house was
taken before Police ; Judge Mogan
' yesterday for preliminary examina
tion. Mrs. Shields was not in court
but Attorney Meredith, the law
partner of Judge Evans, Mrs.
Shields' attorney, asked for a con
tinuance for a week owing to the
absence ; from the city of Judge
Evans. "It was only fair that the
woman s interests . should be â¢< pron
erly. looked after during the examin
ation, ' he said "and for that reason
he asked for the continuance. Judge
Mogan granted the request and set
the hearing for a week from Friday
