TEXAS FEVER PREVAILS
ON SOLANO RANGES
Vigorous Efforts Being Made by the
Stockmen to Stamp Out
the Disease.
SUISUN Sert. 25.â Stock owners In
Solano County are confronted by a
serious situation in the shape of Texas
fever among cattle in certain sections.
Numerous deaths have been reported,
and those Interested in the cattle busi
ness have come to the conclusion that
vigorous efforts must be made to stamp
out the disease. To this end a meeting
was held to-day and was attended by
prominent stockmen. Definite action
was postponed until next Saturday,
when every part of the county will be
represented.
It is thought the disease was brought
by the importation of cattle from
Southern California counties. It is com
municated by means of a tick which
- gets on the animal from the ground
and is the common carrier of the mi
crobe that bears the disease. The
Board of Supervisors has appropriated
money for c health officer, and owners
of cattle ha\ r e been notified to bury the
carcasses of dead animals. Every effort
will he made to prevent further spread
of the disease.

only Government timber but that on the
States domain is threatened with com
plete destruction unless some efforts are
made to (heck tin- spread of the flames.
He estimates the damages already
caused to he at least a quarter of a mil

j * "The attacks of the San Fran- *

1 * course, annoying, as any black- *

These are the exact words uttered by
James G. Maguire, fusion candidate for
Governor, in an interview with The
Call correspondent to-night. Continu
ing Mr. Magulre said:
"I have no objection to fair and hon
orable j criticism, however earnest or
emphatic it may be, but I despise false
hood in politics, such as De Young
makes use of, as well as in the other
relations of life. Take for instance the
Chronicle of Wednesday last. De Young
makes bold to accuse me of falsehood
when I state that I did not support the
Non-Partisan local ticket in San Fran
cisco in 1888. It quotes in support of
Its calumny, an extract from the Ex
aminer of October 28, 1888, purporting
to be a synopsis of a speech delivered
by me on a certain evening In favor of
the Non-Partisan ticket. The fact is,
I did not make the speech in question,
did not support the Non-Partisan
ticket and was not present at the meet
ing referred to.
'"The speech De Young writes of was,
according to my recollection, delivered
by A. B. Maguire, and was incorrectly
reported in the Examiner as having
been made by me. My recollection is
the name of the speaker was correctly
given in The Call and Chronicle, but
De Young, for reasons best known to
himself, and apparent to many, has
chosen not to depend on his own col
umns from which to obtain truth or
f : cts.
"In 1888 I stumped the State for the
Democratic ticket and I did not oppose
the Democratic local ticket In San
Francisco."
Judge Maguire and his party. Includ
ing H. P. Andrews, nominee for Attor
ney-General, and Edward L. Hutchin
son, nominee for Lieutenant Governor,
arrived to-night from San Bernardino.
To-morrow the Judge will make three
speeches, one at Pomona one at On
tario and one at Los Angeles. In speak
ing of the progress of his campaign,
Judge Maguire said:
"Thus far I have delivered twelve
speeches and in the a<"<rregate address
ed directly 30,000 people. I have been
with my tour. I have found
the union forces well organized and
much enthusiasm has been manifested.
The audiences have been large and at
tentive. I have reason to believe my
o-^oonent will not obtain a majority of
the votes south of Tehachapi Moun
tains.
"Of the rest of the State, except th*
coast counties south of San Francisco,
through which I have passed, I do not
care to speak at present, because my
information is derived at long range.
"In my opinion the decreased regis
tration in San Francisco is attributable
to causes equally affecting all parties,
with proportionate equality to their
voting strength. I do not look upon it
as peculiarly injurious to our side. No,
the only counties that I have heard
from where the single tax question is
doing any injury are Marin and Mendo
cino. Here some of the farmers and
dairymen, ho would be beneficially
affected by the single tax, look upon
my election as insuring its adoption. I
find that the people in the counties
through which I have passed are will
ing to rely for the present upon the
constitutional provisions which must
be amended before the single tax can
be adopted. In the counties I have
passed through thus far I do not think
the single tax will have any effect on
the result."
Judge Maguire is standing the ardu
ous labors of the campaign well, from a
physical standpoint. He is in excellent
health and his voice is not impaired as
yet by hoarseness.

American Commissioners Will Sug

Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Sept. 25.â 1n all probabil
ity the distribution of the first lot of
relief supplies sent by the American
Government to Cuba since the war be
gan will take place at Matanzas to
morrow afternoon. The Evacuation
Commission has cabled to Washington
asking that orders be sent to the Comal
at Key West to start at once for Ma
tanzas, and immediately to begin land
ing her cargo of a million dollars'
worth of rations as soon as she arrives.
This Is the result of the Spanish reply
to the Comal communication received
last night. The reply conceded practi
cally all the Americans asked, although
still combating the American conten
tion that the protocol made the Evacu
ation Commission the paramount pow
er in the island and superior to all ex
isting forms of Spanish government.
The essential request being granted the
detail that the Comal disembark at Ha
vana was waived, especially as it was
felt that Matanzas was an excellent
center for the relief of distress
The reply grants the free landing and
distribution of the Comal's cargo under
the supervision of American officers,
aided by a committee of Spanish ap
pointment, or Red Cross agents. This
will probably be followed by a sugges
tion from the American Commission to
the workers of the Red Cross in the
United States that they promptly begin
the shipment of supplies at their dis
posal.
The reply of the Spanish Commission
to the second American demand In re
gard to the evacuation of Cuba will
probably be delivered to-morrow. It is
generally believed it offers a compro
mise on the date proposed. It fixes an
earlier day for beginning the evacua
tion than named in the first Spanish
reply, but is still considerably later
than that demanded by the Americans.
A member of the Spanish Commission
told me to-day that he had no doubt
that a date can be found acceptable
to both nations. The members of the
American Commission, my informant
said, will not Insist so strenuously on
immediate evacuation if the Spanish
answer seems indicative of a desire to
make all possible speed.

Bpectal Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 25. â The
German bark Olga arrived at the Dela
ware breakwater to-night for orders
from Samarang, Java, laden with
sugar. She brought to a close a voyage
of strange fatalities, having only a few
of the original officers on board, Cap
tain Dreyar, her commander, and five
others having died of that dread dis
ease, scurvy, which so often breaks out
on board vessels from the far East.
The <^lpa sailed from Sourabaya on
April I. When about two months out
from port the disease first made its ap
pearance, # and one by one the men were
taken ill, until the ship's company was
reduced to four men able to be about.
Captain Dreyer was among the first to
be stricken. He lasted cmly a few days,
suffering great agony. Then the mate
took charge, and he, too, was stricken
down, leaving in charge of the vessel
men who had little knowledge of navi
gation.
When St. Michaels was reached a
new captain was taken aboard and the
fateful voyage was continued. The
Olga is now waiting orders and will
probably come to this port to discharge
her cargo.

SEATTLE, Sept. 25.â A VanedUver
(B. C.) special says Brindley Mills and
P. G. Grant, two members of a Mon
treal Klondike syndicate, arrived here
to-day after having spent four months
in trying to get through to the gold
country over the Ashcroft trail.
At Qucsnelle they met Sir Arthur
Curtis, an English baronet, and his
party, and also ran across them at Mud
River, where Sir Arthur mysteriously
disappeared and was never seen by a
white man again. Mr. Mills said they
Joined in the search with Indians for
the body, and they are confident that
the Indians not only knew all about the
nobleman's death, but knew also where
the. body might be found. They want
$1000 reward for bringing it out of the
woods.
The unfortunate nobleman, Mills be
lieves, met with foul play.
Mills and his party were lost for four
days without food 100 miles from Tele
graph Creek. On one occasion they
took the advice of a treacherous In
dian guide and went fifty miles oftt of
their way. They describe their ex
periences as terrible. They declare em
phaticall'- that the route is a fraud and
that hundreds of poor fellows are ac
tually in danger of starvation on ii
now. They are stalled fifty and 100
miles apart without provisions and
without hope.
Mills and Grant started out with fifty
eight horses and lost thirty on the road.
Their outfits also were lost, and when
they reached Telegraph Creek they
were broken in health and without
money.
WAR CERTAIN UNLESS
M'KINLEY INTERCEDES
Grave Trouble Between Costa Rica
and Nicaragua Over a Narrow
Strip of Land.
NEW YORK, Sept. 25.â A St. Louis spe
cial to the Herald says: John de Bar
ruel, a resident of Costa Rica, was in
this city to-day en route to the East. He
left Port Limon two wekes ago, and Is
therefore thoroughly conversant with the
affairs of that country and the Costa
Rica-Nicaragua situation.
"Unless President McKlnley interferes
there will be war between the two coun
tries in December," he said to me. "The
controversy arises over a strip of land
extending from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific Ocean, immediately south of the
proposed canal. President Zelaya of
Nicaragua claims that the canal is en
tirely within the boundaries of his coun
try and the Costa Ricans claim the canal
Is on the boundary line.
"The Costa Rican Congress has granted
President Iglesia permission to visit Presi
dent McKinley for the purpose of asking
him to adjust the difficulty, and I be
lieve he sailed for New York last Fri
day, or at least he was supposed to sail
on that date.
"The question is one that has aroused
bitter feeling between the two countries,
but both are willing for the United
States to act as arbitrator and end the
controversy without recourse to arms,
but there will certainly be war between
the two countries unless Mr. McKlnley
intercedes."

HOTEL DEL CORONADO, Sept. 25.â
With a view to ascertaining public sen
timent with reference to the assault
i - 'n against Messrs. Osborne and Par
ker of the Republican executive com
mittee by the Los Angeles Times, and
the attempt to coerce Mr. Gage into
soliciting their retirement and its ef
fects politically on Mr. Gage's pros
pects, correspondents of The Call have
sounded public sentiment in Southern
California. Beyond any doubt the feel-
Ing is one of utter indignation at the
course pursued by the Times. Opinion
is so nearly unanimous as to make one
almost believe that it is the result of
deliberation.
Brigadier General Otis owes his mili
tary advancement, says everybody, to
the personal friendship of President
McKinley, which withstood every spe
cies of assault, personal and political,
adverse to Otis. Indeed, the President
himself avowed that he made the ap
pointment wholly upon personal
groundsâ that is, he had been a com
rade of General Otis in the Civil War,
and entertained a high personal regard
for him, which it was absolutely impos
sible to shake. The natural conclusion
is that Otis, following the example of
President McKinley, would have ig
nored personal considerations, would
have laid aside his personal enmities,
in a campaign whose success or failure
would necessarily have the , ffect to in
dorse or condemn the administration
of President McKinley. Most men
would have recognized such a condition
and conducted themselves accordingly.
On the contrary, the organ of Otis,
while hypocritically avowing confi
dence in Mr. Gage, and a sincere desire
to contribute all its influence to his suc
cess, is really doing its best to sow
seeds of dissension in the party and
contribute to its defeat.
But the effort is so utterly in vain.
No one believes that the second-hand
malevolence of General Otis, filtered
through l'..e Times in his absence, will
lose Mr. Gage a solitary vote which he
would otherwise have secured.
The quiet manliness of the Republican
candidate for Governor, and his ad-
herence to the appointments of the ex
ecutive committee, made with the q(d
vice and consent of the State Cent/ral
Committee, gain universal commenda
tion. Indeed, it is generally considered
that had Mr. Gage yielded to the tru
culent demands of Mr. Mosher, Gen
eral Otis' vice-regent, and demanded
the resignation of Messrs. Osborne and
Parker, it would have coat him many a
vote, or it would have absolutely dem
onstrated that he w. s a man who could
be intimidated by thr>- and scared
by menaces. His reputation has al
ways been that of a man of great inde
pendence of character, and who could
not be handled or molded by any con
sideration other than that which rec
titude of principle inspired.
In the course of this unhappy busi
ness he has fully justified the estimate
his friends have made of him. The
attack of the Times will prove a boom
erang that will return to wound the
hand that hurled it.
Not a few Republicans of influence
and capital in Los Angeles declare that
when this election is over, one of the
results will be the creation of a syn
dicate whose objects will be to estab
lish a Republican paper in Los Angeles
that will represent political principles,
and not private and personal enmities
indulged in with utter recklessness as
to what their effect may be upon a
campaign as essential to President
McKinlev ai.d his administration as to
the Republican party in California.
GAGE TO SPEAK AT
SAN DIEGO TO-NIGHT
HOTEL, DEL CORONADO, Sept.
25.â The San Diego meeting to-morrow
night promises to be one of the great
est political demonstrations ever wit
nessed in Southern California. Henry
T. Gage, the Republican nominee for
Governor, accompanied by General
Barnes, cane here to-day in order to
get a good rest to meet the demands
made upon his time and strength for
to-morrow. At the plaza open-air
meeting to-morrow night he will
speak at much greater length than
usual and enter fully into the discus
sion of subjects which have been
lightly touched hitherto. A reception
at the Horton House to-morrow after
noon will enable him to meet many
friends and acquaintances of San
Diego and the surrounding country.
Special trains will bring to San Diego
large numbers of people from towns in
this region. It is contrary to the prin
ciples of Mr. Gage to do politics on
Sunday, so he came to-day unan
nounced and sought the solace of
Coronado Beach.
General Barnes is in fine form and
will no doubt make a speech in San
Diego that will equal his splendid ad
dresses at Ventura and San Ber
nardino. The Republicans here are
alive to the importance of the cam
paign and have made elaborate prep
arations for the meeting to-morrow
night. U. S. Grant has been selected to
preside.
PBICE FIVE CENTS.
FEATURES OF
THE CONCLAVE
OF -TEMPLARS
Novel Souvenirs for
Sir Knights.
DISTINCTIVE OF PITTSBURG
ELECTRICAL DISPLAY WELL BE
MARVELOUS.
Elaborate Hotel and Sleeping-Car
Arrangements â Programme
for the Parade, Ball
and Banquet. "Ip-
PITTSBURG, Sept. 25.â There will *c
many unique features distinctive of
Pittsburg at the triennial conclave of
Knights Templar in this city, October
10 to 14. Tancred Commandery will
present to every visiting knight a large
earthenware loving cup for use at ban
quets, etc. In addition to being useful
the cups will make pretty ornaments.
On the inside of each will be burned tho
history of the loving cup, which is not
generally known. Thousands of the
cups have been made.
Anothet, distinctive product of Pitts
burg is the stogie. Orders have been
given for the manufacture of half a
million stogies, and they will be put up
in fancy-covered bunches of four. The
packages will be left at the various
commandery headquarters for distribu
tion, and no matter where the sir
knights may go in Pittsburg they will
find stogies to burn. Tin-plate manu
facturers are also working on large
Knights Templar badges of tin plate,
which will be distributed as souvenirs.
AHeghany Commandery No. 36 has
arranged to spend $1000 per day in dis
pensing samples of Pittsburg hospi
tality. Ascalon Commandery No. 59
has rented Elks Hall for the week and
will keep open house there. On the
stage in the hall a continuous musical
and vaudeville entertainment will be
given day and night the entire week of
the conclave. Many high-class attrac
tions have been engaged for this
unique theater.
As Pittsburg is the home of elec
tricity, the electrical exhibition, it is
claimed, will be the greatest ever seen
in the world. Prominent electricians
from all parts of the country are in
Pittsburg now working out designs and
trying to secure enough dynamos to
generate the fluid. Every public and
private lighting plant has been called
on for power and every old dynamo in
the vicinity has been overhauled and
made ready for use. The orders for
electrical power have so greatly ex- â¢
ceeded the possible supply that many
business firms, social organizations,
etc., have been forced to drop out or
cut their plans.
The greatest electrical exhibition
will be made in Fifth avenue. On this
main thoroughfare the Masonic Tem
ple stands. In the niches along the top
of the building will be placed the
figures of four knights in armor and
on horseback. They will be eight feet
high. By an arrangement of lights in
side the fiery cross on the breastplates
they will be plainly visible at night,
and light will stream through the
visors. By an alternating system of
using the lights, the chargers on which
the knights will be mounted will be
given the appearance of moving, their
riders saluting, etc. On the sills of the
third-story windows will be enormous
American eagles worked in gold, with
outstretched wings. Clutched in the
talons will be festoons of Old Glory.
The front of the building proper will
be a combination of relief work,
worked in gold and draped with elec
trical effects. The exterior decorative
piece will cover the entire front of the
temple, standing out far enough to
admit of a hidden arrangement of 800
electric lights behind. The general ef
fect will be in gold, while the temple
and national colors will be introduced.
The Fifth-avenue front of one office
building will be covered with 10,000 red.
white and blue lamps in the shape of
an American flag. The alternating: sys
tem of lighting will be used and this
will give the flag a waving appearance.
It will be the largest American flag ever
made. One prominent electric company
is laying a special cable from its works
to its city office building and will have
a display of 15,000 tc 20.000 lights.
While the hotel accommodations have
not all been taken the railroad com
panies have arranged to sidetrack over
200 sleeping and private cars which will
be used as living quarters by visiting
knights. There will be no crowdiner of
special trains between rows of freight
cars on sidings. Instead the sleepers
are to be parked in admirable order
where they will be easily acoesible at
all hours of the day and night. The
Pennsylvania Railroad will park the
specials in the Grant street. Try street
and Water street yards, and the Bal
timore and Ohio and Pittsburg and
Western Railroad will use the
Burlington and Ohio yards along the
river fronts. Substantial board walks
will be constructed, where there are no
platforms, leading from the trains to
the nearest thoroughfare. The walks
will be well lighted and over the cars
will be Illuminated . igns. Officers will
be employed day and night to keep
away all persons who have no business
near the trains. Special systems of
sewerage and sanitary arrangements
will be laid.
The railroads expect to handle over
500,000 people on the day of the parade.
This will be on Tuesday, and on all the
lines freight shipments will cease at
midnight Monday. In order to facili
tate the handling 1 of passengers no
freight trains will be run on tha* day
within a radius of 100 miles of Pitts
burg.
General J. P. S. Gobin. the grand
marshal of the parade, promises he will
have fifty generals of the recent war
on his staff in the "parade. General

other bomb giving the direct command
for a particular division to move. There2
will be 1.0 long waits, as Is generally
the case with big parades.
The parade will move over a route
only four miles long. This is just half
the length of the route in Boston three
years ago. From Ohio street, Alle
gheny, is will move via Fifth and
Forbes avenues, Pittsburg, where Pres
ident McKinley, Vice-President Hobart
and other prominent dignataries will
review it. From Schenley Park the

floor, but the committee decided that
only members could be admitted there.
A committee of inspection will be on
duty at the door to see that every ar
rival is properly attired. If his regalia
is lacking in the smallest particular
he will be barred out. No regimental
inspection could be more severe. Non
members will be allowed In the gal
leries and boxes as spectators.
California Sir Knights will come to
the conclave in a special train from San
Francisco. The headquarters- of Cali

Enemy and Rival.
CHANG YEN HOON ON TRIAL
CHARGED WITH HARBORING A
CONSPIRATOR.
Stripped of Yellow Jacket and Pea
cock Feather â War to the
Knife Between Jttanchus
and Chinese.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept 26.â The Times Pek
ing dispatch says: Chans: Yen Hoon,
the Cantonese enemy and rival of Li
Hung Chang, who is charged with har
boring Kang Yu Wei, has been arrest
ed. He is now under trial by the Board
of Punishment. He will be stripped of
all his offices and his removal gives in
creased power to Li Hung Chang. The
officials generally welcome the Em
press' return to power, but the people
are indifferent. Kang Yu Wei is charg
ed with conspiring against the Empress
Dowager and has been declared an out
law, and his arrest has been ordered.
The Times Shanghai correspondent
says: On the arrival of Kang Yu Wei
at Wu Sung he was placed for safety
on board the steamer Ballarat, whicn
sails for Hongkong to-morrow. In the
couree of an interview he informed me
that he left Peking on Tuesday in com
pliance with a secret message warn
ing him of his danger, from those inter
ested in the. country's welfare. He fur
ther stated that recent events were en
tirely due to the action of the Manchu
party, headed by the Dowager Em
press and Viceroy Yung Lv and in
cluding all the high Manchu officials.
The latter were dispeased by the Em
peror's leaning toward the reform
party and decided to restore the re
gency of the Dowager. The Dowager
Empress' party is bound by an under
standing with the Russians whereby
the latter, in consideration of the sup
port of the Russian interests, under
take to preserve Manchuria as the teat
of the dynasty and to maintain Manchu
rule in China.
In pursuance of this compact the
gradual substitution of the Manchus in
all high offices and military commands
began last year under the direction of
the Dowager, thus creating friction
with the Emperor, whose dethrone
ment was finally completed. The
movement is entirely Manchu as
opposed to Chinese. The in
fluence of Li Hung Chang is now
subordinate to that of Yung Lv and is
likely to decrease. The Emperor's
health is excellent and his capacity
for work and eagerness for progress are
remarkable. His Majesty is convinced,
however, that it will be impossible to
overcome the opposition without the
assistance of England, which he en
deavored to obtain for his recent pro
gressive measures.
Kang Yu Wei urges that England
now has an opportunity to intervene
and restore the Emperor to the throne,
by doing which, he asserts, she will
earn the gratitude of the Chinese peo
ple. He also observes that unless pro
tection is afforded to the victim of the
coup d'etat it will be impossible for
any native official to Bupport British
interests.
A special from Shanghai says that
Kang Yu Wei's brother has been ar
rested in Peking and condemned to
death. The dispatch also says that Sir
William McDonald, the British Minis
ter, gave instructions that Kang Yu
Wei should be protected from assault.
The British Consulate has his baggage
and documents referring to state
secrets.
It Is reported that Russia has of
fered the services of 10,000 troops to
the Dowager to keep order.

CAMP MEADD, MIDDLETOWN,
Pa., Sept. 25.â Majcrr Joseph K. Weaker
of Norristown was relieved to-day as
surgeon in chief of the Second Division
hospital and assigned as acting surgeon
of the division. This change was made
necessary by the resignation of Major
Devine, who returns to Boston to re
sume his private practice.
Major Charles C. Wiley of Plttsburg
will have charge of the hospital until
the general court-martial disposes of
the case oi Major Charles R. Parke of
Scranton. Parke expects to be ac
quitted and returned to his former
position at the hospital.
Private George Morgan, First Mary
land, died last night at the Red Cross
hospital of typhoid fever. Corporal
August F. Ross, Company H, Second
Regiment Engineer Corps, also suc
cumbed to typhoid fever.
To prevent the spread of typhoid
fever In camp the Twenty-third New
York Regiment, which is afflicted with
the disease, will be isolated from Camp j
Black. Chief Surgeon Girard says the i
fever had its incipiency in the New
York camp and the sick will be sent
to Philadelphia hospitals.
The Red Cross Society will send a
hospital train to camp from Phila
delphia to-morrow to take 100 patients.
They will be carried to the Woman's
Homeopathic and Woman's Hospital.
The Reading hospital will send a train
also for fifty patients.
Religious services were held to-day in
many of the regiments and there was
a large attendance. Colonel W. J. Glenn
of the Fourteenth Pennslyvania has j
been appointed acting commander of i
the Second Brigade, First Division, in !
the absence of General Oates, who has â 
gone to Alabama on private business.
Major General Graham issued an
order to-day consolidating the Fif
teenth Pennslyvania and Ninth Ohio j
Battalions, in command of Colonel i
Krelps. The new organization will
take the place of the First Delaware j
in the First Brigade of the First Divi
sion and will probably be ordered to
Cuba for garrison duty. The battalion
Is made up entirely of cclored troops in j
command of Major Young, a graduate !
of West Point.
Eight companies of the First Dela
ware have received orders to move to
morrow on the grounds vacated by the '
Twelfth Pennslyvania, and as soon as j
their muster-out rolls have been pre- j
pared they will be forwarded to their
home station for a thirty days" fur- I
lough, at the expiration of which they
will be retired from the service.
Oil stoves have been placed in both
division hospitals and the flies between
the tents removed to protect the pa
tients and nurses from the weather.
The nights in camp are very cool and
many of the officers are using oil
stoves to keep warm.
General Graham expects to begin
practice marches soon by regiments.
They will march to rendezvous within
a radius of ten miles of camp and will
take with them baggage and water
wagons and ambulances for the sick.
The health of the corps, with the ex
ception of the New York regiments, is
excellent, and unless there is a change
the troops will stay here until cold
weather. The prospects are that the
First Division will be the first ordered
south to prepare for duty in the West
Indies and the Philippines.
CRIMINAL NEGLECT
AT VOLUNTEER CAMP
Archdeacon Bradley Speaks of the
Inhuman Treatment of
Sick Soldiers.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 25.â Rev. Cyrua
L. Bradley, archdeacon of the Protestant
Episcopal diocese of Eastern Pennsyl
vania and chaplain of the First Regi
ment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, in a ser
mon to-night severely criticized the man
agement of the volunteer camps which
came under his supervision at Chicka
mauga, where his regiment was stationed
for a long time. He said the medical,
commissary, quartermaster and ordnance
departments were all to blame, and con
tinued thus:
I personally saw men left in the hospital
In camps for thlrtv-six hours without any
medical attendance whatever. I saw men In
those hospitals suffering from fever, with the
rain beating down upon them. I paw men
committed to the care of unskilled attendants
when it was absolutely impossible for them to
receive anything like the attention they de
served. I saw men suffering from fever, ly
ing with their mouths open and their mouths
filled with files.
In conclusion the archdeacon said:
I won't say more. There is much moro that
might be told If it were proper for me to tell
it but perhaps this will suffice. I had not in
tended to touch upon this phase of our ex
perience at all, but when I think that these
things have taken place in this, the richest,
greatest and presumably the most advanced
nation on the face of the earth, I cannot hold
my peace.

MANILA, Sept. 25.â The Filipino
Congress is engaged in the considera
tion of the question of raising funds to
defray expenses of the maintenance of
j the army pending a decision by the
I Paris conference. Hitherto the army
j of the Filipinos has been cheifly sup
ported by public subscription, but now
the native government contemplates
the imposition of various taxes. The
inhabitants of the northern provinces,
however especially of Pampang and
Ilocious flatly refuse to pay land or poll
taxes because It was the popular im
pression that the revolutionists would
abolif-h taxation entirely.
The natives of Pampang and Pangas
inan the richest two agricultural prov-
I inces of the island, and those of Iloci
| ous and Zembales, who are the stur
| diest mountaineers, distrust the Togal
los, and insist upon the establishment
of an American protectorate.
Yesterday the assembly debated the
I question of a land ta - A majority of
1 the members was opposed to the main
! tenance of a burden unequally distrib
j uted and unduly favoring the Togallos,
and demanded that a statement of ex
penditures be submitted before the
matter was decided. The statement
was not forthcoming, and the question
was shelved.
Aguinaldo realizes the difficulty of
reconciling the conflicting interests, but
hopes that the nations will allow the
I Filipinos a fair chance to show that
j they are capable of self-government.
Aguinaldo desires the Associted Press
to .inform the world that there Is con
clusive evidence that many Spaniards
and priests are intriguing with a fac
tion of the natives to foment disturb
ances so that Americans will believe
the whole population to be irreconcil
able. He asserts that the intriguers
have money and provide uniforms to
persons who impersonate rebel officers
and enter the towns, and he accuse*
Eugene Blanco of being the chief paid
agent of these intriguers.
In the course of an interview Agui
naldo said that the Filipino fleet com
prised eight steamers, which were
engaged in convoying troops for a
grand campaign against the Spanish
garrisons in the southern islands.
These vessels are practically un
armed.
The Spanish gunboat El Cano, he
says, recently entered Masbate and
caught and sunk the Filipino troopship
Burisan which was lying at anchor
there.
. He admitted the recent purchase of the
steamer Abbey, formerly the Pasig, but
denied that she had landed rifles and
ammunition at Batangas; but he ad
mitted that she carried two Maxims
and a shipload of stores.
The United States stean.cr Hugh Mc-
Culloch captured the Abbey sixty
miles south of Manila. It is believed
that the Abbey has landed 7000 rifles.
OREGON PREPARED TO
SAIL FOR HONOLULU
Will Leave This "Week â Other Ves
sels of the Squadron May In
clude the Vulcan.
NEW YORK, Sept. 25.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Instructions
given, by the Navy Department to Cap
tain A. S. Barker, commanding the bat
tleship Oregon and senior officer of the
squadron which is under orders to pro
ce.ed to Manila, require him to sail dur
ing the present week for Honolulu.
Reports received at the department yes
terday announced that the Oregon is
ready for the voyage and will be in condi
tion to sail to-morrow. The supply ship
Celtic, the distilling ship Iris and four
colliers which will accompany the battle
ships will be ready during the next few
days. The department is considering the
advisability of attaching the engineering
and repair ship Vulcan, which did such
magnificent work in Cuban waters, to
the squadron. Rear Admiral Dewey is in
need of such a ship, and it may be de
cided to send her along with Captain Bar
ker's command. The Vulcan received or
ders yesterday to come north at once.
She will undergo such repairs as may be
necessary, take on board supplies and
will be ready for the voyage, it is stated,
by the latter part of the week. With the
Vulcan at Manila it will be unnecessary
to send ships to Hongkong for repairs.
Besides the authorities expect the Pacific
to be a theater of operations for Borne
time to come; hence the decision to place
the squadron in the Bast in the highest
possible state of effectiveness and to sup
ply it with all necessary equipment. The
squadron on its way aÂ»ound to Honolulu
will make stops at but three pointsâ
Bahia, Sandy Point and the Galapagos
Islands.

LOOKS DARK FOR
THE DECKHAND
Unraveling the Yacht
Chispa Mystery.
EVIDENCE AGAINST NELSON
HIS STORY OF THE BROOKS MUR
DER DISCREDITED.
Witnesses Declare That the Shots
Aboard the Craft Were Heard
Before He Plunged Into
the Bay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL Sept. 25.â The meshes
of circumstantial evidence tending to
the belief that Captain J. Morse
Brooks was murdered on the yacht
Chispa at Sausalito by Peter Nelson,
the deckhand, are tightening about
that young m n In a manner that Is
evidently causing him considerable
mental discomfort.
An important discovery was made to
day by Sheriff Harrison. As a result
that official is now thoroughly con
vinced that "Pete" is guilty of the as
sassination.
"I have little doubt that we have the
right man," said the Sheriff to-day.
"A morning paper asserts that G. Mil
ler, who was formerly employed as
deckhand on the Chispa and had a bit
ter quarrel with Captain Brooks In
August last, is now under suspicion.
This is hardl" true. We merely wish
to learn where Miller and a former em
ploye were at the time the deed was
committed. Nelson is the man that
committed the crime, in my opinion,
and I think time will prove the cor
rectness of my theory."
As was stated in to-day's Call, there
are several things leading the authori
ties to this belief. The latest link to
the chain of evidence is furnished by
William Harrison, the poolroom broker.
In his published statements the im
prisoned deckhand declared that the
bow of the Chispa pointed south, and
that when he left the boat and jumped
into the water he headed for the shore,
the leap being made on the starboard
or shore side. Next, he asserted that
the, shots were fired directly at him as
he was swimming away from the
yacht.
Harrison was standing on shore near
the water's edge at this time. To The
Call correspondent and to Sheriff Har
rison he said to-day that each of the
three shots was fired toward the stern
of the boat, at right angles to the
course in the water taken by Nelson.
Moreover, Harrison is sure that the
bullets went in a horizontal direction,
or nearly so, as was shown by the
flashes, and not in a downward direc
tion as if the object shot at were near
the yacht.
One of the strongest points made is
a statement by Harrison that the
splash made by Nelson's body striking
the water did not occur until after all
three shots were fired, showin 7 that he
could not hay been shot at while
swimming. If Nelson flred the shots
himself he would necessarily have had
to do so before jumping from the boat.
No charge has yet been preferred
against the prisoner, and none will be
until the conclusion of the Coroner's in
quest to-morrow.
Coroner Eden scouts the idea that a
man could hay grown cold in the time
that elapsed between the firing of the
shots, or c en for ten minutes prior
thereto, and the time when Cramer,
Harrison and Johnson boarded the
yacht.
The evidence given by William Har
rison to-day, the fact that Captain
Brooks was cold when discovered dead,
the peculiar wound and the manner in
which Nelson received it, his declara
tion to Commodore Gutte that he would
know the tall man among a thou
sand" when he got only a fleeting
glimpse in a poor light, and his hesi
tating demeanor when this fact was
brought to his attention, are considered
damaging evidence by the authorities.
Constable Cramer still believes Nelson
Innocent, but admits that it looks bad
for him.
The inquest will be held to-morrow
at 9 a. m. Sheriff Harrison was in
formed to-day that Miller had sur
rendered himself to Detective Egan
and in compan" with Constable Gan
non went to San Francisco to see him
They are expected to return to-morrow
morning.
George Miller, the sailor whose name
was mentioned in connection with the
murder of Captain Brooks of the yacht
Chlspa, visited police headquarters yes
terday and asked if he was wanted. Sheriff
Harrison of Marin County was at once
sent for, arriving here a short time after
ward. After hearing Miller's statement
he allowed him to go, after thoroughly
satisfying himself of his innocence Mil
ler was employed on the yacht about a
month ago, but after working five days
he quit, being unable to get along with
Brooks. He says the latter was ugly
and mean, and was continually under the
influence of liquor. He never heard that
he had any valuables on the yacht.
GENERAL FITZHUGH LEE
GOING TO WASHINGTON
Taken to Mean That the Movement

About to Begin.
NEW YORK, Sept. 25.â The Jackson
ville. Fla., correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs Secretary Alger announced to
day that General Lee would be granted
leave for a time and would go to Wash
ington to recuperate. 4 Thls is taken to
mean that the movement of troops to
Cuba Is not far in the future and that Gen
eral Lee has been ordereu to Washing
ton to confer with the President and War
Department about the movement of
troops to Havana. This is especially
probable "when considered in the Tight of

War Investigators.
URGES A THOROUGH INQUIRY
EVIL-DOERS MUST NOT EVADE
PUNISHMENT.
President Refers to the Sensational
Charges of the Press, and Says
the Country Must Learn
the Truth.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25.â The com
mission appointed by President Mc-
Kinley to investigate the administra
tion of the War Department in rela
tion to its conduct of the Hlspano-
American War will begin its labors
formally to-morrow. The commission
effected an organization yesterday by
the election of General Greenville M.
Dodge as president, Richard Weight
man secretary and Major Stephen C.
Mills of the regular army recorder.
The president is understood to be
thoroughly pleased with the personnel
of the commission. It was his effort
to secure as n.embers of the commmis
sion men of the highest character and
standing, in whose opinions and judg
ment the country would have all con
fidence. He desired, also, to have
represented on the board all phases of
public and political feeling, every sec
tion of the country and all classes of
business, professional, commercial and
military. The men whom he has ap
pointed are possessed of wide and
varied experience, many of them hav
ing served with distinguished honor
to themselves either in the Union or
Confederate army.
The President feels assured that the
verdict of the commission, whatever
that may be, in the inquiry it is about
to conduct, will be accepted and ap
proved by all right-minded and right
thinkinr- American citizens. That it is
the President's desire that the inquiry
should be ripid and searching was in
dicated by his statement to the com
mission when it assembled at the
White House for a conference with
him yesterday. No limit is placed by
the President upon such investigation.
It is to include every department of the
army, and the President assures the
commission in advance the^t he will af
ford it every facility in his power foi
the prosecution of the most searching
inquiry into every part of the admin
istration of war.
In addressing the commission the
President said among other things:
Gentlemen: Before suggesting the mat
ters which shall come before you for in
vestigation I desire to express my appre
ciation, to each of you for your willing
ness to accept the patriotic service to
which you have been invited. You are
to perform one of the highest public du
ties that can fall to a citizen, and your
unselfishness in undertaking }t makes me
profoundly grateful.
There has been in many quarters severe
criticism of the conduct of the war with
Spain. Charges of criminal neglect of the
soldiers in camp and field and hospital
and in transports have been so persistent
that, whether true or false, they have
made a deep impression upon the coun
try- It is my earnest desire that you
shall thoroughly investigate these
charges and make the fullest exposition
of the administration of the War Depart
ment in all of its branches, with the view
to establishing the truth or falsity of
these accusations. I put upon you no
limit to the scope of your investigations
of all departments connected with the
army. I Invite the closest scrutiny and
examination and shall afford every facil
ity for the most searching inquiry. The
records of the War Department and the
assistance of United States officers shall
be subject to your call.
I cannot impress upon you too strongly
my wish that your Investigation shall be
so thorough and complete that your re
port When made will fix the responsibility
for any failure or fault by reason of neg
lect, incompetency or maladministration
upon officers and bureaus responsible
thereforâ if it be found that the evils
complained of have existed.
The people of the country are entitled
to know whether or not the citizens who
so promptly responded to the call of duty
have been nM*lected or misused or mal
treated by the Government to which they
so willingly gave their services. If there
have been wrongs committed, the wrong
doers must not escape conviction and
punishment.

NEW YORK, Sept. 25.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Colonel John
Hay, it is expected, will arrive in this
city on Thursday, when he will receive
his commission as Secretary of State
from the hand of President McKinley.
In anticipation of his arrival, many of
the diplomats who have been away on

Embassador, will be here to-morrow, and
Sir Julian Pauncefote Is expected to be
back this week. Other diplomats are ar
| riving.
When Colonel Hay takes the oath of
office he will at once notify the members
of the diplomatic corps of his arrival and
the assumption of his new duties, and will
invite them to call at the State Depart
ment a few days thereafter for the pur
pose of meeting him. When these for
malities are completed, Colonel Hay will
commence the direction of his depart
ment
One of the first matters which will have
to be disposed of will be the selection of
his assistant, and it is expected the Pres
ident will also consult him regan^ng the
appointment of an Embassador to the
Court of St. James.
I was told positively to-day that the
President had not yet selected an assis
tant secretary, believing that Colonel
Hay would have a voice as to the person
to be named.
The President has not offered the Brit
ish post to any one since tendering it to
Senator Hoar and Secretary Long, and
who will be selected cannot be definitely
stated; and in fact I was told that the
President himself did not know.
So far as diplomatic questions are con
cerned, for some reasonor other, there
is a feeling in administration circles that
the claims against Turkey are to be
pressed. As a matter of fact the ques
tion is to be left to discusion between the
President and Colonel Hay when the lat
ter reaches Washington. It is presumed
that the matter will be kept in the chan
nels of diplomacy, and for the present
at least the President would be averse
to the employment of the navy in asking
a demonstration having as its object thÂ«
collection of the claim.

Greatly Pleased With Its
Condition.
PRAISE FOR GENERAL LEE
GOOD HEALTH OF THE MEN DUE
TO HIS ORDERS.
Secretary of Wax Says History Will
Pass Upon the Merits or De
merits of His Admin
istration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JACKSONVILLE, . Fla., Sept. 25.-
Secretary Alger and party, consisting
of General Sternberg, surgeon general;
General Ludington, quartermaster gen
eral, and others, spent the day in Jack
sonville visiting the camp of the Sev
enth Army Corps. The distinguished
party was met at the station by Gen
eral Lee and a company of citizens.
General Alger proceeded at once to the
camp of the First Division and during
the day inspected the three division
hospitals, going through every ward.
He shook hands and spoke encourag
ingly to the sick men. In one case,
where a discharge was asked for by a
sick man, his name was taken, and the
Secretary said that it would be attend
ed to.
The regiments of the three divisions
were reviewed, that of the Third Divis
ion after dark, with the light of the
moon hid behind a hazy sky. At the
conclusion of his labors Secretary Alger
said in response to a question:
"I am highly delighted with all I
have seen and an! very agreeably sur
prised at the conditions that I find ex
isting in Camp Cuba Libre."
As Jacksonville is considered to have
the best and healthiest camp in the
country his statement means much.
A luncheon was tendered to the Sec
retary and party at noon, and in re
sponse to a toast, drunk standing, he
said:
I have visited Jacksonville once or
twice before but never with the same In
terest as to-day. I have listened with
pleasure, but with no surprise to the reso
lutions that have been presented as to
how the citizens have got along with
General Lee. Any one can get along with
him that will let him have his own way.
I have known him pretty well and you
have been right in letting him run things
here. I am glad that the soldiers have
been orderly and, of course, that has
been due to General Lee. The health of
this camp has been better than that of
any other in the country. Twenty-flve
per cent of that has been due to the city
of Jacksonville and seventy-five per cent
has been due to General Lee, for, of
course, th c subordinate officers do not
count. (Applause and loud laughter.)
Sickness is largely the fault of com
manders â division, regimental and com
pany commanders.
General Lee is not looking very well
and I have granted him a special leave
of absence.
The organization and equipment of an
army of 250,000 men carrying on a war
In two continents in the space of three
months has been a tremendous under
taking. The Secretary of War has been
Ã¼bly a*alsteed in this undertaking by the
surgeon general and the quartermaster's
department. They have Been criticised, '
but not to the extent the Secretary of
War has been, yet I know the work they
have accomplished has been little short
of miraculous. When this war began the
clothing that the men have worn was on
the backs of animals. There was no am
munition, no transportation; there was
nothing beyond the War Department but
a great, rich nation, burning with patriot
ism. Almost in a night an army was
organized and equipped that paralyzed
the nation wijh which we had to deal,
and has awakened the admiration of the
world. 1 have no apoligy to make for
what has been done. 1 am willing to let
the record of the campaign stand and
speak for itself.
United States Senator Morgan said to
me before he left for the Hawaiian Isl
ai "Tlie world has never seen nor will it
see again the mobilization of such an
army and the accomplishing with it of
what has been done with this one in such
a short period."
It matters not what may become of me.
I may be buried in oblivion or in the
grave but the unbiased historian will
give the world the imaprtial record of
what has been accomplished, and the rec
ord will stand forever as a monument to
the greatness of this nation and o<. its
boundless resources. We are a great na
tion We don't have to uepend on any
other nation on earth, and our resources
are such that we can be Independent of
all We should have a standing army
large enough for our needs. We should
have a great navy that we may take our
place among the leading nations of the
world.
When this war began I issued an order
that the North and South should be brig
aded together. They have been united
and it is proved that the sectional lines
of the North and the South no longer ex
ist; and I thank God that I have lived to
see the day when we have a united coun
try. I thank you, General Lee. for the
welcome and the hospitality of to-day,
and I hope for the continued nrosperity
of this city and this nation. ( Great and
continued applause.)
Surgeon General Sternberg, in an in
terview, said that he did not think that
he should be herd responsible for the
mistakes of all the officers under him,
and yet he had been criticized for all
that had happened. He said that every
requisition that had came to his office
for supplies had been promptly filled,
and that he knew of but one item that
had been cut out of a requisition, and
that was for chewing gum. His depart
ment had been ready to meet every de
mand, and if the supplies wanted had
not been asked for it was not his fault.
Regarding female nurses, he said that
his position had been misunderstoood.
He had been in favor of them from the
start and did not know it would be pos
sible to get along without them.
As to the hospital here, he was highly
pleased, and found the sick being well
cared for. In contrast to other camps,
the purity of the water supply was un
questionable. He had made inquiries
at random and had not heard a single
complaint during the entire day.

READY TI MEET
THE WAR ISSUE"
Record of the Republi
cans Very Clear.
SO SAYS MR. OVERSTREET
TBUTHS POINTED OUT BY THE
COMMITTEE'S SECRETARY.
Only Thing Left Undone Was Due to
Democratic and Populist
* Opposition in Con
gress.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK Sept. 25.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
managers of the Republican Congres
sional campaign say they are ready to
meet the Democrats on the war issue.
"If we are to have the blame for any
mistakes that have been made or for
individual incompetency," said Mr.
Overstreet, the secretary of the Repub
lican committee, "then we must be
given the credit for the way in which
the President, as commander-in-chief
of the army and navy, brought the war
to a speedy and satisfactory termina
tion. We must be given credit for the
action of the Republican majority in
Congress, in spite of Democratic oppo
sition, in making all the necessary ap
propriations, providing for the neces
sary supplies and doing everything that
it was possible to do to insure the suc
cess of the war, leaving only one thing
undone which we were prevented from
doing by the Democratic and Populist
opposition in the closing hours of the
sessionâ providing for the inspection
and investigation of camps so as to dis
cover and remedy the very defects
which are now being charged to us.
"In the organization of an army of
more than 200.000 men some mistakes
were inevitable, and it was to be ex
pected that some men would prove to
be incapable or even dishonest. It is
surprising, when the magnitude of the
work is considered, that there is so
little to criticise."

NEW WHATCOM, Sept. 25.â The party

the young St. Louis artist who was lost

ROBBERY ON
DALTON TRAIL
A Klondiker Slain by
Highwaymen.
FOUND WITH THROAT CUT
TWO OTHERS DESPOILED OP
THEIR GOLD.
Gang of Cutthroats Lying in Wait
for Men Returning From the
Yukon With Sacks of
Dust.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNE A. Alaska. Sept. 21, via steam
ship City of Topeka to Victoria, Sept.
25.â The worst crime against returning
gold-laden Klondikers. next to that
which caused the taking off of the late
"Soapy" Smith at Skaguay, was com
mitted a few days ago on the Dalton
trail. It resulted in the loss of blood
and treasure. Evidently highwaymen
are beginning attacks on successful
gold-seekers, and judging from the
way this murder was committed they
are old hands at the business. One man
was found with his throat cut and rob
bed, and two others lost all their gold â
in all about $8600. The news reached
here a. short time before the Rosalie
sailed.
( >n August 31 four menâ A. H. Fraser
and E. L. Tollner of Seattle, and B. L.
Blum and Samue! Barrett of Omaha â
left Fort Selkirk, coming out over the
Dalton trail. They had two pack
horses. On the evening of September
15, when approaching Pleasant Camp,
near the last police post on the trail,
and about sixty miles from Raines
Mission, on Lynn Canal, two of the
men were stopped by highwaymen.
The party had gone separately. Blum
and Barrett, it is supposed, are behind
and are expected out in a few days.
No suspicion is attached to them.
Fraser and Tollner were the two ahead
and had one of the pack horses. It was
between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening.
Rain was pouring down and it was
quite dusk.
Suddenly in front of them two men
with handkerchief masks over their
faces and revolvers in their hands
arose in the trail not ten feet ahead
and commanded a halt. The Klon
dikers were told to give up their treas
ure. The gold was in the pack on the
horse. There was no help for it, and
Tollner handed over $1800, the result of
two years' work in the Yukon, and
Fraser parted with about $2800, taken
out this summer from a Klondike creek.
The robbers backed off into the under
brush and disappeared.
The next morning, about four miles
further down the trail, they came jpon
the body of Ike Martin, a former part
ner of Jack Daiton, lying in the road j
with his throat cut. About $4000, which
h>' uas known Co h.iv^ had. Is missing. |
He lived near the trail at the Dalton j
post This deed may have been com- j
mitted by Indians.
The police are hunting the robbers
and murderers, and by this time may
be upon their trail. There is consider
able excitement among the Chilkat In
dians, as they fear they may be blamed.
Fraser and Tollner did not have a
cent left, but the little steamer Pilgrim
brought them to this city without
charge.
CUT IN THE PRICE
Oh DAWSON WHISKY
JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 21 (by
steamship City of Topeka to Victoria,
Sept. 25). â The unexpected has hap
pened in Dawson â the delightfully un
expected. The price of whisky has I
dropped to 25 cents a drink, and there
was a yell of approval which went
down the river no far as to cause the
four-bit drinkers at Forty Mile, Circle,
Rampart City :ir.d Mar.ook to groan ;
with envy. This out is said to have
been made first by Healy of the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company, and he Avas soon followed
by all the others. This shows that ;
there is plenty of liquor in Dawson. It '
is now the same price there as In
Southeastern Alaska.
One story is that "Swiftwatcr Bill"
first made thÂ« j cut. "Bill" is now quite I
generally referred to as "Slackwater
Willie," for he is not financially aa
speedy as he used to be. He is a. part
ner in a large gambling hall and sa- j
loon called the Monte Carlo. Though j
Mr. Gates has not now as much money |
as formerly, he is far from bei lg
"broke." The saloon business is quiet,
but "Bill" has a small interest in two
or three claims.
"Jack" Smith, "Bill's" partner, is
here this week. lie says that Gates'
claims are among the finest in the dig- |
pings, but that it "doesn't make any j
difference whether they are good or
bad; Will will blow in his money and
never have anything anyway."
"Bill's" chief ambition is still to
pose before "ladles" and "gents" on the !
f'loktail route as a man of money and i
one able to spend it. "Money Is noth
ing to '1.111/ " says Smith.
Provisions enough for about three
y^ars are stacked up around Dawson,
and though prices may not fall, they
are not apt to increase much during
the winter. Fine table d'hote dinners

Poisoning â Incidents of the
Crime and Arrest.
FORTH WORTH. Tex.. Sept. 25.â A sen
sational murder trial is in progerss at

OUR PEACE COMMISSION
VIEWS LONDON SIGHTS
Hotel Proprietor Hoists Both Ameri
can and Spanish Flags in Its
Honor.
LONDON. Sept. 25.â The American
Peace Commissioners devoted the day to
sight-seeing with the energy and enthu
siasm of few tourists. Most of the ladies
and several of the gentlemen O f the party
attended religious service in Westminster
Abbey and St. Paul's. Several indulged in
steamboat excursions on the Thames or
drove to many places of historic Interest.
The Hotel Cec. was filled with Ameri
cans all day, many calling on the Com
missioners or attaches, while others
grouped about the lobbies discuss
ing the commission and its work,
gave the golden English hostelry the air
of entertaining an American political con
vention. Much amusement was caused by
the action of i..c hotel proprietor, who
intending to nay a graceful compliment to
his guest, raised the American and Span
ish flags side by side. The combination
excited curious comments among the
passers-by.

SAN FRANCISCO GIRL BECOMES
MRS. VAN ALSTINE.
Honeymoon Trip to New York.
Mysterious Disappearance of
the Young Wife and $38,
000 in Certificates.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 25.â There has
been much mystery during the last few
days over the visits of several of Cap
tain McClusky's ablest detectives to
an East Side private hospital and to
the Hoffman House, and it became
known to-day that they were in vain
quest for a young bride of three
months, a San Francisco woman, who
disappeared last Wednesday after a
brief stay at the hospital.
Charles Van Alstine, a typical Klon
dike miner, and a successful one, reg
istered with his bride at the Hoffman
House on Wednesday as coming from
Bootin, In the Klondike District. Van
Alstine. after a vain search of three
days for hi 3 wife, assisted by the en
tire detective bureau, left the Hoffman
House on Saturday morning for the
West to continue the search for his
strangely missing wife.
It was learned only to-day that Mrs.
Van Alstine had taken with her $38,100,
part of the proceeds of the sale of one
of the valuable claims in the Klondike
which was owned by her husband and
four other Klondike miners.
While cruising down the Yukon River
Van Alstine met and was smitten with
the charms of a young woman who
was also a passenger. She told him
that she had lived in San Francisco,
but had gone to the Klondike on a
prospecting expedition and intended to
sell some real estate In San Francisco
and then return to the Klondike. It
did not take much persuasion on the
part of Van Alstine to induce the young
woman to change her mind, and a par
son being â¢. inveniently at hand on the
steamer, the knot which made the
couple man and wife was quickly tied
and they began life's journey together.
Mrs. Van Alstine, upon reaching San
Francisco, quickly disposed of her
property, while her husband exchanged
his nuggets for drafts on New York
banks, and a train was taken for the
East, where it was decided that the
money should be invested, a good time
enjoyed, and then Mr. and Mrs. Van
Alstine would return to the Klondike,
where he still holds valuable posses
sions which require his attention.
Last Monday, at Mrs. Van Alstine's
request, she was taken to a private
hospital, olaiminsr to be suffering from
nervous prostration. The following day
she disappeared, and search for her has
been unavailing.
Van Alstine told the detectives that
he had exchanged the drafts which he
had obtained in San Francisco on loral
banks into certificates of deposit â
seven for $5000 each, one for $1000 and
one for $500 â and had made them pay
able to his wife. He said that for safe
keeping he gave them to her to carry, and
that she always carried them in a little
satchel which she took with her when
she went to the hospital. He admitted
to the detectives that he knew very lit
tle about his wife, having made her ac
quaintance on a Yukon River steam
boat, but said that he was sure she had
met with foul play in some way by
persons who knew of her possession of
money.
The detectives are at a loss to solve
the mystery, and while they have
buoyed Van Alstine up with false hopes
they have found absolutely nothing
upon which to fasten a clew of any
sort. From the time the woman walked
out of the hospital she has been as com
pletely swallowed up as though she had
never existed.
Experimenting in Weeds.
BERKELEY. Sept. 25.â The agricultural
department of the University of Califor
nia is conducting a series of novel experi
ments upon the foothills behind the col
lege campus. The members of the rie
p.irtment are preparing to issue, before
very long, an extensive treatise upon
weeds. In order to explain the subject
thoroughly to farmers in this State. They
are taking advantage of this year's
drought to test the relative depth to
which weeds will grow in arid and moist
soils. Last Thursday the men who are
carrying on the work found a common
weed which had sent its root down to the
astonishing denth of nine feet below the
surface of the soil. This specimen, to
gether with many others, will be photo
graphed and issued as an illustration
when the department publishes its bul
letin.

CAMP DEWEY, Vif.i the American
i-âny of Occupation before Manila.
August 10â One of those sad tragedies
which it seems we human freight can
not prevent occurred in camp to-night,
throwing a whole regiment into
mourning. Private Edward A. O'Neill
of Company H, First California Volun
teers, was shot and -dantly killed by
Private John Lunsford of the same
company. The bullet passed through
Ocelli's left arm, entering the left
breast, piercing the heart and going
clear through the body, coming out on
the right side.
The shooting was the result of one of
those accidents always the more deeply
regretted because it seems to the
friends of the man shot that the merest
trifle of care would have prevented a
fatal result.
It seems that O'Neill and Lunsford
for several days past have had a
friendly rivalry as to which was the
quicker man in going through the
manual of arms. They were at their
favorite pastime just before drill to
night, Private James Dodini giving
them the calls, and O'Neill had proved
himself the quicker of the two.
"Let me try the firing drill," Luns
ford said. "I can beat you at that."
"Very well," O'Neill agreed, and Do
dini gave the words:
"Present arms! Ready! Load! Aim!
Fire!"
A shot rang out, a bullet whistled
through the camp, and O Teill, a gap
ing hole in the left breast, fell dead,
and Lunsford fell beside his victim in a
dead faint. He had been too eager. He
had suffered for a moment from men-
tal aberration. One of his comrades had
even seen him drop the shell into his
gun, and had sprung forward, too late
to save O'Neill.
Lunsford had been too quick alto
gether for his future peace of mind.
I saw him immediately after the
body of his victim had been carried
away, in Captain Warren's tent. He
did not then know O'Neill was dead.
When Colonel Smith informed him of
the fact, he broke down, weeping like
a child.
"My God!" he cried. "My God! I
did not know what I was do-ing; I was
excited. I had been drinking." This,
by the way, was said in attempted ex
planation, and is not true. It has been
proved that Lunsford had not taken a
drink all day.
"I knew the gun was loaded. It
seemed to get away from me. I do not
know how I did It."
Later he made a somewhat more co
herent statement, but after all the man
could not tell why he had put the shell
in his gun. The men had always been
friends, and were, in fact, all but
chums. O'Neill was one of the most
popular boys in the regiment, one of the
coolest heads, and Lunsford Is well
liked. It seems to have been a trick
of unkind fate.
Of course Lunsford will be taken into
custody and held pending an investiga
tion, althcmgh I do not well see how
anything can be done to him. He is
almost insane, as it is, from vain re
morse.

IIKADQX'ARTKRS SECOND REGIMENT.
OREGON U. S. V.. MANILA. P. 1.. August
IS, 189 S.
Proprietor of The San Francisco Callâ Sir: I
have the honor to express my deep gratitude
for the valuable service rendered by a launch,
under ynur contract, while in th* bay of Man
ila during the final capture of that city August
13. Being on board the Kwong Hoi with the
tntops that were to occupy the city under the
direction of General Merritt. and having only
one rowbop.t on board the shir, and being
stranded owing to low water within 200 feet of
a suitable landing place, we were entirely at the
mercy of these conditions when your launch
under the control of Mr. Haeringer came along
side within hailing distance and he promptly
responded and took me nshore, and by so do
ing placed me in a position whereby I could
press into service some castros and launches.
which enabled me to Ret my command ashore
without J lay. your launch co-op =ratlnjf in every
detail in nsrisiinr; in the landing of the troors.
I make this acknowledgment to you as an
appreciation on my part and on the part of the
Government in rendering valuable assistance
at this time. I have the honor to remain, sir,
yours respectfully, O. SUMMERS.

OUR GROWING FINANCIAL POWER.
DURING the past year frequent mention has
been made of the rapidly growing importance
of the United States as a money power, instead
of a purely producing power, as it has been for several
generations. The transition was sharp, and took place
before even the best posted financiers of the country
defimtely knew what was going on. It suddenly
appeared one day that we were loaning large sums in
gold coin to German banks, and since then our posi
tion as a creditor instead of a debtor nation is begin
ning to be acknowledged everywhere. The latest tes
timony to this effect appears in the weekly review of
R. G. Dun & Co., which says:
"Europe will have to consider possible American
needs for money much more anxiously in the future.
Doubtless there has been for many years a feeling that
the new continent could not be put off with promises.
But the control of this country over money markets
in the Old World is coming to be that of a master.
Our banks lend over there heavily when it is the most
convenient market for them, but they draw on Europe
whenever they want money, and no longer have occa
sion to limit their drafts."
So it appears that our money as well as our navy is
asserting itself abroad. The conquest, though peace
ful, is not less effective and permanent. If we continue
this financial advance, who knows that we will not
soon be in a position to dictate to other nations
whether they shall go to war or not? The hypothesis
is not nearly as far-fetched as it might seem at a
hasty glance. A little further progression on our
present lines is quite likely to place us where, by giv
ing or withdrawing our support from expectant bel
ligerents, we may frequently impel or prevent hos
tilities, as we choose. *If we become the greatest
producers of both food and money in the world we
thereby exercise a predominating influence on both
the stomach and the pocket of the world, and, a?
these are the principal organs of the body politic, the
power that controls them controls the body politic.
In other words, we shall rule the world.
This financial condition was the leading feature of
trade last week. The current of gold began to set so
strongly toward the United States that the Bank of
England was forced to advance its rate of discount
from 2ji per cent to 3 per cent to check it. But no
earthly power can check the law of supply and de
mand, an ] if we feed Europe it has got to pay us for
it, and in one form or another the gold will flow in
just the same. It is doing so now.
The center of commercial activity continues in the
West and Northwest, where the rush of business is
remarkable. Indeed, we are told that the East finds
it hard to realize how very active the West is, though
the East itself is enjoying a satisfactory trade. The
iron and steel trade leads all others in point of pros
perity, as there is a steel famine in Germany, and
Great Britain is in our market for 10,000 tons of
plates. The domestic orders are simply immense, and
the works are crowded for months ahead. The other
staples are unsettled. Wool and cotton continue dull,
but wheat is again rising on account of better foreign
buying, induced chiefly by poorer crop prospects in
Russia. This quickened demand has largely increased
the exports of wheat and flour froni Atlantic ports
during the past week, and the wheat trade is now in
better shape than for some time back. The bank
clearings of the country continue rather unfavorable,
showing a decrease of 3.2 per cent last week from the
corresponding week last year. On the other hand, the
failures were only 182, against 237 for the same week
in 1897.
this coast conditions show a pronounced im
provement for the week. Primarily, there was the ad
vance in wheat, which carried with it better prices for
most of the minor cereals. An advance in hay con
tinued the improvement along the same lines. The
dried fruit trade, which had been dull for some time
exhibited signs of doing better, as the Eastern de
mand slowly improved, giving increased tone to
prices, which were already good. The demand for
canned fruit, too, continued brisk at firm quotations.
A diminished yield of grapes stimulated the inquiry
for this important staple, and the week closed on a
rising market. Hops were also strong, owing to a re
ported shortage of 50.000 bales in the world's product
:his year. Government orders for provisions kept this
market from stagnation. In fact, while there was no
particular activity in any branch of local trade, the
conditions certainly showed visible improvement.'
If the husband of Mrs. Esqueda can be found it is
to be hoped that he will decline to be arrested, and
during the ensuing argument get a few ounces of fatal
lead in his system. Even if the fellow is not a mur
fierer, many a better man has had to go to the
gallows.
Germany's ruler seems to think he can bring the
Philippines within his jurisdiction, but there is no in
dication that he has yet secured the consent of one
Dewey, a diplomatist with an inclination toward
scrapping.
There is a growing belief that Governor Budd
shaved because Phelan insists upon wearing whiskers.
THE SfTTURDfIY-EVENING SPEECHES.
SATURDAY evening was in this city something
of a field night for both Republicans and Dem
ocrats. The Republicans were addressed by
one of the most eminent citizens of the State, Morris
M. Estee, and the Democrats by J. Hamilton Lewis,
one of the most conspicuous of the new leaders the
new departure of Democracy has brought to the front.
The arguments of each side being thus presented
by men who are thoroughly representative of the poli
tics and the parties they support, the readers of The
Call had on Sunday an opportunity of studying both
sides of the campaign. It was an interesting study,
and one which should have engaged the attention of
every voter whose mind is not yet made up on the
issues before the people.
Mr. Estee made his points clearly. The national
issues of the canvass are: The maintenance of sound
money, an early reform of the currency, the con
tinuance of the protective tariff, and the upholding of
the administration, which has so well served the na
tion both in peace and in war. The local issues are
the preservation of the welfare of the State by the
election of safe, conservative men to office, and the
defeat of candidates who represent only the discon
tents of the unthrifty, or the vagaries of radicals who
regard land-owning as a wrong and desire to virtually
confiscate land by imposing upon the owner the
whole burden of taxation for all purposes.
Mr. Lewis gave much of his speech to an attempt
to prove to the Democrats before him that Maguire
has not been neglectful of his duties as a Congress
man, and attacked the war revenue bill at some
length, but made as his main argument the extraor
dinary assertion that the Republican administration
has not kept its pledges made in 1806.
It is unfortunate for Mr. Lewis and for the fused
factions he has come here to help that this charge of
his was made on the same day that Estee spoke, and
that the two speeches were published together next
day. To the question of the Democratic orator ad
dressed to Republican leaders: "Can any one of them
point to a single issue or promise of the last cam
paign that has been carried out?" Mr. Estee's elab
orate review of the benefits accruing to the country
from the Republican protective tariff, and the virtual
settlement of the money question, affords a complete
answer.
The campaign is young as yet. and it is not known
what resources may be at the disposal of the Maguire
managers: but if they have any orators capable of
giving dignity and earnestness to the canvass for their
single tax champion it is time to bring them to the
front. The gentleman imported from Washington is
eloquent indeed, but has as many vagaries as Maguire
himself and will never win a conservative or indepen
dent voter to the side of the factions for which he
does his talking.
UPS AND DOWNS OF LI hjUNG CHANG.
DOUBTLESS it was with a prophetic foresight
of the political adventures of Li Hung Chang
that the old-time poet wrote the rattling
chorus, "When he was up, he was up; and when he
was down, he was down; and when he was just half
way, he was neither up nor down."
For the last ten years the old man has been on the
most uncertain teeter-board of fortune that was ever
ridden by a statesman; his yellow jacket and his
peacock-feather have been alternately donned and
doffed with the rapidity of a lightning change artist,
and he must have long since come to the conclusion
that life is a game in which it is impossible for even
the most skillful player to stack the cards.
The most singular feature of this career of vicis
situdes is that it has been lived out in China. For
ages the Flowery Kingdom was the land where all
things were stagnant and where changes came only
with the processes of nature â where men grew old in
the station in which they were born, and were safe
from everything except death and taxes. All the old
time conservatism, however, seems now to have
passed away. A new order of politics prevails. The
Chinese administration is more variable than that of
France. In no other capital of late years have states
men experienced such quick turns of popular or im
perial favor as in Peking.
That China is undergoing the throes of a far
reaching revolution affecting her social structure and
industrial organism even more than her government
all the world knows. The extent and degree of the
fluctuations caused by these new forces are revealed
by the effect they have upon the heads of the state.
As Li Hung Chang goes up or down, so does the tidal
wave of a new movement in the empire ebb or flow.
It is an indisputable evidence of his consummate un
derstanding of Chinese nature and his cool-headed
mastery of court intrigues that he has managed to
escape shipwreck in the stormy waters over which he
has to make his way.
It is one of the curious paradoxes of history that at
this closing epoch of their old-time stagnation the
Chinese, who of all races have the highest veneration
for ancestry, have at the head of their government
a Dowager Empress who was once a slave girl, and
a Prime Minister who was once a poor fisherman.
These two old people, whose lives are more remark
able in their swift changes from poverty to affluence
and power than any known to the United States,
where the Presidency is open to the aspirations of
every boy, are to-day directing the conservative, su
perstitious, stagnant Chinese in the paths of change
that will lead no man knows whither.
Great as is the just fame of Chang, the Dowager
Empress seems to have a more virile brain and a
greater force of will even than him. Her career, how
ever, has not so largely attracted the attention of the
world. Chang is the Foreign Minister, and it is upon
Chang the eyes of the nations are fixed. To-day his
teeter-board is bearing him once more up. and curious
diplomatists are watching to see whether he will not
start downward to-morrow.
THE WASHINGTON PRESS.
ONE of the best â if not the very best â special
editions ever devoted by a newspaper to the
sole purpose of making known the industrial
and social conditions and resources of a single town
ship in California, has just been issued by the Wash
ington Press of Irvington, Alameda County. Many a
more pretentious journal aiming at an exploitation of
a great county or of a wide section of the State, has
produced an edition by no means comparable to this.
The showing made for the township attests that its
industries, its buildings and its energies are worthy
of the special edition devoted to it. It is one of those
fruitful regions adorned with schools, churches and
homes amid orchards and vineyards, which the peo
ple of California are fond of regarding as typical of
the whole commonwealth. The edition is worthy of
a wide cirudation, and the residents of the township
should see that it is given.
While T. Carl Spelling and James Barry are call
ing each other names, Julius Kahn is understood to
be industriously sawing wood.
Arrests for cruelty to animals seem to be more
common than trials and penalties for the same of
fense.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, 3IONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1898.
THE EXCLUSION OF ANARCHISTS.
OWING to the activity of the European police in
enforcing the laws against anarchists since the
assassination of the Empress of Austria, the
danger of a large influx of that class of criminals to
the United States has become imminent. This is
fully recognized in the Eastern cities, where incoming
anarchists would be most likely to assemble, and a
strong agitation is now going on to arouse the immi
gration inspectors to a greater vigilance than ever in
excluding them.
That a sufficient cause exists for the agitation is be
yond dispute. The time has gone by when any man
of fair intelligence and right sympathies could believe
that anarchy has its origin in despotism; that it aims
only at the destruction of tyranny, and that on ar
riving in this country the dangerous madman of
Europe would be transformed into a good, peaceable
and industrious citizen. We have had one disastrous
experience with the class in Chicago, and have come
near having others in New York. We have learned
the lessons taught by these experiences, and the de
mand for a thorough exclusion of anarchists is a proof
that we know how to profit by them.
The anarchists aim at the destruction of existing
society, and strive to attain that end by the assassina
tion of any one who stands as a representative of law
or of property. Their blows fall with an equal hate
upon the Czar of Russia, the police of our cities, or,
as in the case of the Empress of Austria, upon a
woman entitled to respect for her years and her sor
rows as well as for her high station.
That a few demagogues in this country such as
Altgeld of Illinois and James G. Maguire sympathize
with the spirit of anarchy and do not hesitate to ex
tenuate its offenses, renders the coming of anarchists
to our shores even more dangerous than it would
otherwise be. Maguire as a member of Congress has
insisted upon the right of anarchists to enter the
United States, and Altgeld as Governor of Illinois
pardoned those who in that State had been sent to
prison for life for complicity in the murder of the
Chicago policemen at the Haymarket riots.
These deeds show the extent to which that class of
demagogues are willing to encourage the spirit of
anarchy among the lawless criminals of Europe who
may seek admission to the United States. It is there
fore evident that the danger of anarchy is of almost as
much concern to us as to the people of the most
despotic nations in the Old World, and the best way
to guard against the menace of the assassins is to ex
clude them from this country altogether.
ELIMINATE THE KENVILLES.
POLICEMEN need to be brave and strong.
They do not need to be brutal. Unless they
have the sense and decency to make proper use
of the authority conferred upon them they constitute
to the community as serious a menace as the evil
doers whom it is supposed to be their province to
hold in check. Give a bully a pistol, a club and an
exaggerated notion of his rights, and you have a bully
of the worst type.
Policeman Kenville is believed to have broken the
skull of a little boy, a lad too small to have wrought
him physical harm. The statement is made that the
patrolman threw a club and struck the child, who had
had the misfortune to annoy him. He pleads not
guilty, and denies the commission of the act. We are
willing to hold the verdict in abeyance until he shall
have been heard. If he can overturn the evidence of
reputable witneÂ«ses, which now seems conclusive, all
the better for him. If he cannot, the sooner he shall
be expelled from the force, together with all of his
kind, the better for the department.
There are occasions when violence on the part of
a policeman is justifiable, and, exercised properly, will
receive general indorsement. He is armed for emer
gencies. He must run the chance of coming in con
tact with desperate characters, and it is his business
to subdue them. In this manner he protects the pub
lic, and if he crack the crown of a dangerous hood
lum or a professional criminal, the circumstance will
rather weigh in his favor. But no boy of ten years,
even though disporting himself noisily, earns the dis
comfort of a fractured pate. No policeman can ad
vance a shadow of justification for throwing his club
into a crowd of youngsters, knowing, as he must, if
not a fool, that a fatal impact may result. And if he
is a fool there are other callings in which he would
constitute less of peril.
THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR.
px RESIDENT McKINLEY is reported to have
L_>/ informed the committee appointed to investi
gate the conduct of the war that while their at
tention should be particularly directed toward the
service of the departments of the surgeon general,
quartermaster general and commissary general, he de
sired that our entire military organization should be
made the subject of investigation and full reports sub
mitted upon any deficiencies noted.
In order that the commission may be able to prose
cute its work with success, the President promised
every assistance in obtaining evidence. He is quoted
as having said: "If the commission should have
difficulty in securing the attendance of witnesses or in
obtaining access to papers thought to be essential to
the prosecution of its labors, I hope the matter will be
brought to my attention, when I will do all in my
power to overcome the difficulty. I want the com
mission to have a clear field, and I will do all that is
possible for me to do to see that it has."
The country will note with satisfaction that the in
quiry is to be made on this comprehensive plan, and
in the most thorough manner. An investigation of
such scope is sure to yield good results. It is al
ways of advantage to go over any important work
and take note of points where it could have been done
better. Only by making such inquiries and by profit
ing by the lesson they reveal do nations improve in
the art of war.
That there is much for us to learn in the work of
handling armies is beyond dispute, and the President
has acted wisely in authorizing the committee to make
its field of inquiry as wide as is necessary to determine
every shortcoming in our military system.
Now an instance of the sending of poisoned candy
through the mails is reported from Texas. It was the
common stick candy, which can be bought at any
cross road store, and the necessity for sending such
stuff through the mails is so far from obvious that
the recipient ought to think twice before eating it.
He should concentrate his reflections on the problem,
"Is life worth living?" If he concludes it is not, let
him tackle the sweets.
One of the policemen accused of cowardice at the
murder of Lieutenant Burke explains that he did not
know how to shoot, having fired a pistol but three
times in his life. What business has such a greenhorn
to carry a pistol? â¢
Pando is incorrectly reported as having made a
fool of himself in New York. All he did was to keep
right on being the same old fool.
Augusti announces that he has saved his honor.
Evidently in the hurry of his flight he did not have
time to grab anything valuable.
THEY HAD NO VOICE NOR VOTE.
The writer of the following letter is
only one of hundreds of Democrats whose
sentiments regarding the Committee of
One Hundred and its sponsors are similar
to those expressed here:
Editor Call: I am one of a very large num
ber of old-line Democrats who have bolted the
party for the present, at least, and am now
enjoying the veritable Kilkenny fight being
waged among the Gallaghers and Magulres and
# v ?. and Hame s's and all the other Celts
or high and low degree. The present dis
graceful proceedings being enacted by the
place-hunting vultures seeking places on the
municipal Democratic ticket causes honest
Democrats to bow their heads In shame, and
they are showing their indignant disapproval
Â°i At c nigh-handed outrage of the Committee
of One Hundred by openly avowing that in
this campaign they will bolt the party and
teach the leaders and promoters of the
Committee of One Hundred a lesson that will
last them for the next four years.
The rank and file of the Democratic party of
theis city, the men who do the shouting, the
cheering and furnish the funds for carrying
on the campaign, thereby bolstering up the
weak-kneed and faltering ones, and keeping
the party organization intact, were horrified
and astonished when it was given out that a
mere handful of political picaroons had in
duced the Democratic State Central Committee
to ignore the time-honored custom of holding
primary elections to select delegates to the
State convention, and Instead to nlace the se
lection of such delegates in the hands of the
Committee of One Hundred, who were them
selves selected by Gavin McNab. Mayor Phelan,
ex-Chairman of the Democratic State Central
Committee Alford, Governor Budd and a few
other politicians of smaller bore. These men
did not realize that they were fooling with a
boomerang. But they are now feeling its ef
fect.
This Is the reason I have left the party. If
I can have no voice in the selection of the
men sent to the State convention, then let the
party get along without me at the general
election. If the party can get along without
me. most assuredly I can get along without the
partyâ a party that I have labored with for
MAGUIRE AND THE SINGLE TAX
Editor Call: I was present at Metropolitan Hall and heard Maguire de
liver his opening speech of the campaign. He announced himself as a
firm believer in the single tax, and explained how it will bring the millen
nium. He criticizes the Republican platform for saying that the single tax
doctrine tends to socialism and anarchy, and then spoke as follows. I
quote his exact language:
"It is not a proposition to confiscate land. The confiscation of land
"would pi^t an end to the single tax."
Mr. Maguire has the gift of his race in invective. He says that the writer
of the plank in the Republican platform, over which he has had so much
worry, is an ignoramus, and the newspaper which quotes his speeches is a
dozen kinds of a liar.
Now the Republican press, in its treatment of the combination candi
date for Governor, has been more than liberal. He loudly calls for the
record, and with your permission I will give him a small part of It. He
admits that he is an apostle of single tax, but denies that it means the
establishment of communism in the holding and occupation of land.
On the 10th of March last Mr. Maguire made a speech in Congress, a
copy of which he kindly sent me and which I now have before me. It Is
a document of sixteen pages and is all devoted to the advocacy of single
tax. On page 4he says:
"Equity, therefore, does not permit property In land; for If one portion
"of the earth's surface may fully become the possession of an individual
"and may be held by him, for his sole use and benefit, as a thing to which
"he has an exclusive right, then all other portions of the earth's surface
"may so be held, and our planet may thus lapse altogether Into private
"hands."
On page she says: "Whether it may be altogether expedient to ad
"mit claims of a certain standing is not the point. "We have nothing to
"do with considerations of conventional privilege or legislative convenience,
"We have simply to inquire what is the verdict given by pure equity In
"this matter. And this verdict enjoins a protest against every existing
"pretension to the Individual possesion of the soil; and dictates the asser
tion that the right of mankind to the earth at large, is still valid, all deeda,
"customs and laws notwithstanding. Not only have present land tenures
"an indefensible origin, but it is impossible to discover any mode by which
"land can become private property."
He then proceeds to elaborate this point by Illustration, and on page 6
he states his case as follows:
"The world is God's bequest to mankind. All men are Joint heirs to it.
"You are among the number, and because you have taken up residence
"upon a certain part of it, subdued, cultivated and beautified that part, im
"proved as you say, you are not, therefore, warranted in appropriating it
"as private property. At least, If you do so, you may at any moment be
"Justly expelled by the lawful owner, society."
These infamous sentiments are not original with Mr. Maguire. He
states on page 4 of his speech that they are quoted from Herbert Spencer,
and he calls them an "unanswerable argument" in support of the single
tax and adopts them as his own.
He denounces the Republicans in his choice language for saying that the
single tax doctrine is confiscation of land. Hear him on page 14 of his
speech in Congress, which I have quoted. He proposes to give every
landless tramp a farmâ a very commendable idea; but it is not a donation of
the public domain. I quote his words:
"How can this be done, since we have sold the land? Why, we sold
"it subject to the unlimited right of taxation, reserved by the State and
"Federal Government. Exercise that reserved right of taxation by concen
trating all taxes upon land values, and the only incentive that men now
"have to own land will be instantly taken away."
If this is not socialism and communism I do not know the meaning of
the terms. It panders to the spirit of anarchy and encourages the law
less elements who war against civilization.
Now, Mr. Maguire, calling names is not argument. If you have any
explanation to make, you now have the floor. A. P. VAN DUZER.
PASSING OF THE MONOPOLY.
Editor San Francisco Call: We feel like congratulating you that the
Bakersfield and Los Angeles Railway is about to be built. The Call
never stated a fact so potent in its effects upon the welfare of this State
as its statement this day that the connecting link in a competing through
railroad line was an assured fact. The writer will not allude to the inter
ests which so closely surround The Call and the construction of this import
ant railroad link. Without this link California remains in slavery to the
greed of the Southern Pacific Company.
Sixty dollars per ton for malleable iron castings which have been nick
eled over by a battery is the enormous charge this company is now collect
ing from the manufacturers of this coast on goods on which the charge waa
$15 per ton for the last several years; $30 per ton for the commonest iron
goods. How can any community prosper in a manufacturing way with its
raw product thus taxed? Should manufacturing not be nourished and pro
tected to some degree? Then look at the many articles manufactured in
the East brought in here at one-half the above rates, goods which take up
much space and are more valuable. Should these traffic highwaymen not be
compelled to respect the people's needs in their efforts to establish facto
ries here? If we have no proper timber nor malleable iron works, who fur
nish iron castings, etc., to go Into our work, should these commodities not
be brought in cheaper than the made-up finished goods? No one class of
business men can prosper under the Southern Pacific freight schedule but
those who buy and sell. The manufacturer is ignored in hie struggles to
develop and establish his business. The rates into California are not based
on equity, ad valorem or common sense. Should this supreme power be
put into the hands of a few men to raise or lower rates at their own voli
tion; breaking down established business, upsetting all legitimate business
calculations, business that was based upon established rates? Is there
much difference between their "hold up" of the people of this State and the
"hold up" of the train robber? Freedom is what California needs from
this regime; and as I gaze at night upon that modern architectural tem
ple, The Call's home, with its electrified dome piercing the clouds, it strikes
me that it is "writing on the wall" that a new power and influence Is at
hand, and that this railroad monopoly in this State will be broken up.

"municipal nominating convention," then tne
Salt River boat may as well be built now as
in November, for it will be manned with Demo
cratic candidates and with the Populist nomi
nee for Governor, Mr. Maguire, for captain.
Now the Committee of One Hundred should
heed the timely warning of the Governor, for
he is a prophet of no mean order and can
peer further Into the future than Professor Ro
maine.
But It really makes one laugh to see our
prophetic Governor holding up the warning
finger at this late day. In my opinion, and it
is shared by many other Democrats, it is no
worse for the Committee of One Hundred to
resolve itself Into a municipal nominating con
vention than it was for the same committee
to select delegates to the State convention,
thereby disfranchising the rank and file of the
Democratic party of this city, a fact the Gov
ernor will realize when the Senatorial seat
that is to be made vacant by the expiration of
the term of Senator White, and for which Mr.
Budd has been hankering and planning after
for the pa6t two years Is gone from his gaze
forever.
But the war is on and Mayor Phelan and
Governor Budd are "forninst" one anothÂ«r,
and we bolting Democrats are looking placidly
on, caring but little which one wins.
It is gratifying to know, howeve- that three
months more will see the close of Jim Budd a
political career. Tet as a Democrat who work
ed late and early to elect Mr. Hudd to the high
position he now holds, I feel a keen regret
that with his outgoing he is pulling down thÂ»
Democratic pillars and leaving the party that
has honored him so often and so long nothing
but a pile of ruins. IVANHOE.

A Vicker's armor plate, 8.8 inches thick,
was recently tried at Shoeburyness. Three
Holtzer armor piercing projectiles, weigh
ing 380 pounds, were fired from a 9.2 inch
gun at velocities ranging from 1870 to 1900
feet per second, but all the shells broke
up and there were no cracks in the plate.
The British cruiser Terrible's sea trial
of 60 hours, terminating September 1, was
very successful. The ship was down to
a mean draught of 28 feet 5% Inches, and
the engines, with 233 pounds of steam and
98 revolutions, developed a mean of
515-horse power, giving a speed during the
first thirty hours of 20.1 knots against
wind and sea, and 20.5 knots during the
second half of the trial with wind and
sea favoring.
The Mermaid, a torpedo-boat destroyer
built by Hawthorn & Leslie at Newcaatle
on-Tyne, from designs by the firm, had
her initial trial at sea September 1. The
boat is 300 tons, 210 feet in length, 21 feet
beam and 12 feet 6 inches in depth. She
has four water-tube Thornycraft boilers
and the engines are to develop 6000-horse
power. With 390 revolutions the highest
speed was nearly 30% knots and the aveov
age of all the runs was 80 knots, whiÂ«Ji
is the contracted speed.
English papers comment on the Rut
elan shipbuilding orders In Franc* as
prompted by a sentiment of friendship
with no elements of business considera
tions, as the ships could be built for less
money and in less time In Great Britain.
The sum to be paid for the vessels order
ed at La Seyne will foot up to $10,200,000
for the battleship, armored cruiser and
the three torpedo-boat destroyers. The
Marine Engineer estimates that there Is
a clear profit of $1,600,000 to the builders
In this order and regrets that the orders
were not placed in England.
During the past two years there have
been several serious cases of seamen
striking, or attempting to assault, their
superior officers. In 1887, with 51,353 blue
Jackets and marines, there were 45 cases
of that kind and in 1897, with a total of
82,241, the number of offenses of this de
scription had increased to 97. Under the
heading of "Violence to Superiors and
Insubordination," there were 30 In 1887
and 57 in 1897; under "Disobedience of
Orders," the comparison stood 10 and 18,
and for desertion there were 20 In 1887
and 56 In 1897. Including all offenses
there were 151 court-martial cases in 1887
and 278 In 1897, but it will be observed that
serious offenses are on the increase in
the British navy.
Germany is coming to the front as a
builder of ships for foreign navies. Since
1895 forty-six vessels have been com
pleted or begun at the three yards at
Elbing, Stettin and T el. The list in
cludes: Three torpedo gunboats for Bra
zil; Z cruisers, 5 torpedo-boat destroyers
and 6 torpedo boats for China; Austria
has had 1 torpedo-boat destroyer and 1
torpedo boat, and Norway 1 of the first
named class and 8 torpedo boats, and
Sweden and Turkey each one of the latter.
Italy has ordered 4 torpedo-boat destroy
ers; Japan, 1 torpedo-boat destroyer, 8
torpedo boats and 1 armored cruiser and
the latest Russian order is for 3 cruisers
and 4 torpedo-boat destroyers. The value
of these forty-six vessels is placed at $24,
000,000, Tfhich means an approximate clear
profit of SE.OOO 000 to the firms of the three
yards referred to and employment to
thousands of skilled and unskilled work-

South 42aCELEBRATED
THE FEIST OF
ATONEMENT
Worshipers Fill the
Synagogues.
A GREAT JEWISH FESTIVAL
YOM KIPPUR WILL BE FAITH
FULLY OBSEEVED.
A Special Musical Service Rendered
Under Direction of Cantor
Stark at the Temple
Emanu-El.
The Jewish festival of the atonement
was celebrated yesterday with all the
pom* 1 and circumstance with which the
people of that faith observe the holiday.
There was feasting throughout the city,
Jewish hospitality being extended be
yond all ordinary limitation as a part of
the day's proper observance. The re
ligious services commenced with the cele
bration of the Kol Nidre in all the syna
gogues and temples.
The vast auditorium of Temple Emanu-
El was taxed to Its utmost capacity, as
were the other places of worship. The
eloquent rabbi, Jacob Voorsanger, con
ducted the services being assisted by
Cantor Stark. The receptacles for the
sacred scrolls, the pulpit and the reader's
desk were all draped in white silk and
trimmed with silver ornaments. These
reflected the lights from the organ loft.
The musical programme proved a fit
ting background for the words of cheer
and goodwill that fell from the lips of the
learned rabbi. The musical programme
was under the direction of Cantor Stark.
The music, arranged for the festival
centuries ago, was supplemented by mod
ern numbers in keeping with the formers
solemnity. Chief among- these wa.< a
hymn. "Day of God." by Cantor Stark.
This waÃ for soprano solo, with organ
accompaniment, supplemented by flute,
violin, 'cello and harp. Among the solo
ists were: Miss Daisy Cohn, Mrs. H.
Kelly. M. Borrows and S. H. Henley.
The theme of Rabbi Voorsanger's ad
dress was the Day of Atonement. He
told of the many sins for which atone
ment was to be made; the endeavor to be
at peace with one's self, holding that the
greatest endeavor should be that of se
curing self-pardon of sins; the sins of the
household to be atoned for and the na
tional sins in which all have a share. He
held that the main object of the day was
to find courage to acknowledge one's sins
and to think them over. He said the
Day of Atonement is not the asking- of
pardon for sins against God.
The services at the Taylor-street Syna
gogue were conducted by Rabbi Nieto.
Kol Nidre was played by the orchestra
and sung by the cantor as a solo and
then with choir. Rabbi Nieto's sermon
was on "The Trend of the Age." He
took for his text a quotation from
the Talmud, Rosh Hoshannah 1:16:2,
"There are four ways in which a man
may destroy the results of evilâ by char
ity, prayer, change of name and change
of conduct." He paid In part: "A cele
brated writer of this century in his pref
ace to his best-known work, deplores,
that necessity compels him to descant
upon life in the fifth century. He pro
nounces its perusal evil for the young,
and a source of shame and confusion to
the old. Then lawlessness passed for or
der and absolute abandonment stood for
moral conduct. Murder was a sportive
pastime, and pillage and rapine the gen
eral amusement of the people.
"If to-day we are able to understand
the infamy and to appreciate its deter
rent influence upon the moral progress of
the race, is it not a proof that we have
enlarged and developed? Nay that we
are further on the road toward the re
alization of the world's ideal? Regard the
events of the hour. Study the manner of
our prosecution of war, our humane
trt-atment of a fallen foe, our endeavors
to rebuild what we have been compelled
to tear down. All this is indicative of
the birth of a new and more tolerant
spirtâ the proofs of broadening out into
that new Jerusalem which shall include
the whole world and dedicate the earth
as God's holy temple.
"What we need to-day is encourage
mentâencouragement to sustain us and
refresh our flagging spirits as we scale
the heights toward God. 'Teach us
rather,' men say, "how much of good we
may do and direct our thoughts to the
contemplation of goodness, than forever
guiding our minds to brew sin and pain.'
"Time was when a man finding a field
unproductive would experiment upon it
by rule of thumb, and being unsuccessful
would leave it with a curse upon it and
any who might in future attempt to till
It. To-day we analyze the soil and dis
cover the cause of its barrenness, apply
remedies that turn the desert into a gar
den of roses. Time was when a bad laoy
or a bad man was chastised and ill
treated, and if obdurate was cursed and
ostracised. To-day we are endeavoring
through a more precise study of man
and his nature to Introduce into his train-
Ing and education elements that endow
him with intelligence and impart to him
power by which he may restrain those
tendencies which are detrimental to his
success in life."
The feast of Yom Kippur will be cele
brated in - all the synagogues to-day.
Services will commence at 10 o'clock and
continue until 6.

FRAWLEY (WANTS TROUBLES
Edward M. Bell, the Popular Leading Man, Has
Been Retired From the Famous Organization.
rp HE misfortunes of the Frawley company, In so far as its member-
I ship is concerned, still pursue it. First Cora Tinnie was retired.
1 Then a combination of peculiar circumstances led to the injury and
permanent withdrawal of Madeline Bouton, the leading lady, who has
been for several weeks an in
mate of a private hospital.
Next Miss Winter, the pretty
little Ingenue, failed to appear
in the casts and now Edward
M. JJell, the handsome and
popular leading manâ favorite
of the ladies and admired by
the men â has been dismissed.
The many friends of Mr.
Bell In this city and the East
will learn with sincere regret
that his enforced retirement
was due to his inability to
master his appetite for liquor.
Possessed of marked histrionic
ability, education and a fine
stage presence, he grave promise
of a bright future, but the
drink habit brought about
his downfall. He reformed
and when he came here with
the Frawley company it was
supposed that his troubles of
that nature were over.
Several weeks ago he under
took to drink moderately, but
could not control himself and
the result was that Man
ager Gottlob concluded to dis
pense with his services.
At this point a strange thing
occurred. The members of the
company individually urged the
manager to withhold such ac
tion, and Madeline Bouton,
from her sick bed, sent in a similar request. Mr. Gotlobb acquiesced.
The end of the story comes from Los Angeles.
"When Mr. Bell asked me to give him another trial," said Manager
Gotlobb yesterday. " his plea was first, that he would never touch another
drop of liquor, and that as the part he was studying in 'An Enemy to
the King.' would be the event of his career, to be retired at that
time would work his ruin. I was anxious to do everything I could for
Bell, as he is a royal good fellow, but I find that my confidence in him
was misplacedâ that his appetite was stronger than his resolution.
"In Los Angeles on the opening night of 'An Enemy to the King.' he
went on the stage under the influence of liquor, and when it came to
the duel scene with John T. Burke, Mr. Bell was in such an excited con
dition that it was feared Burke might be seriously injured in some of
the onslaughts.
"Mr. Frawley had to take the part on the following night without
previous preparation and will play it at the Baldwin next week. We all
have the utmost sympathy for Mr. Bell, and earnestly hope this deplor
able experience will be the means of causing him to forever abandon the
course that has led to his undoing."

Mrs. Virginia Shields, Who Is the
Owner of the House Burned,
May Be Arrested on
Suspicion.
Upon evidence found Inside her burning
dwelling Mrs. Shields of 201 Virginia ave
nue may be arrested upon a charge of
arson.
Late last night the two-story frame
dwelling in which she has been living
was discovered to be on fire on the inside
and an alarm was quickly turned in.
The fire was an unilsually fierce one and,
only after $500 worth of damage had been
done was it extinguished.
Upon entering the building the firemen
were startled at discovering the walls,
carpets and bed clothing of one of the
bedrooms saturated with coal oil, while
in an adjoining room they found a can
of the same inflammable fluid with a fuse
attached and ready for firing.
Inquiries were immediately made for
Mrs. Shields, and from the neighbors it
was learned that she had announced her
intention to leave for an outing in the
country.
The police say she will be placed under
arrest upon a charge of arson as soon as
she can be located.
THE NEWSPAPER A
FACTOR IN MORALS
REV. DR. LOCKE DENOUNCES
YELLOW JOURNALS.
No Agency Which Can Accomplish
More for Good Government Than
a Fearless and Honest
Editor.
Rev. C. E. Locke began his second year
as pastor of Central Methodist Church
on Mission street, near Sixth, yesterday.
His sermon at the evening service was
on "The Daily Newspaper as a Factor In
Morals." Dr. Locke, In his remarks,
said:
"Great events, like great men, very
often appear in groups. About three cen
turies ago there were several important
occurrences which took place almost sim
ultaneously â the discovery of America,
the emancipation of tne Holy Bible by
Luther, the fall of Constantinople and
invention of printing. Although the dis
covery of movable types by Lawrence
Coster was purely an accident, it was by
no means accidental that the art of print
ing was introduced into the ages at tho
time of the renaissance, for printing In
a large sense is the preserver and con
servator of all other forces which are
making for true progress.
"The evolution of the modern newspa
per is a fascinating study. Little did our
forefathers dream of what would be the
future power and influence of the news
paper. To-day there are 2200 daily and
16,000 weekly papers published in the
United States in twenty-four different
languages.
"It would take a vast volume to record
the great work accomplished by the
newspapers of this country and to re
count the courage and achievements of
their great editors. Many of these men
have been epoch-makers. The name of
Horace Greeley must be mentioned first
as the peerless journalist and statesman.
Also we would not forget George Jones,
who, as editor of the New York Tribune,
could not be bribed with five millions of
dollars to withhold from publication cer
tain damaging information against the
Tweed ring. James Gordon Bennett made
the New York Herald a great newspaper;
It was he who sent Henry M. Stanley in
successful search for David Livingstone.
Charles A. Dana, George W. Childs and
Murat Halstead composed a triumvirate
of princely editors. Whitelaw Reid, re
cently appointed to the Peace Commis
sion is the well known editor of the New
York Tribune. All of these men and many
otherÂ« have been builders of this repub
lic. They made the editorial page an ox
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY,
traordinary factor in public affairs. It
has been recently intimated that the edi
torial page is going out of fashion; but
this can never be so long as great and no
ble and statesmanlike men occupy the
editorial chairs. Without a man of intel
lect and conscience and conviction as edi
tor a newspaper deteriorates into a mis
erable accumulation of disgusting sensa
tionalism.
"That the daily paper In many Instances
has been prostituted and debased must
be humiliatingly confessed. Such papers
are published for revenue only. Nearly
every city is cursed with "slum joumaf
ism"; papers which like vampires deal in
the putrid details of salacious scandals
and manufacture stories filthy with all
kinds of abominations. Such papers are
an unmitigated evil and ought to be sup
pressed by law. The so-called "yellow
Journal" has vitiated the public taste and
has become a dangerous menace to the
public weal.
"In every city in this nation to-day
there are remarkable opportunities for
the daily paper to ally itself with much
needed reforms. Nor is there any agency
which can accomplish more for good
morals and good government than an out
spoken and courageous daily paper. The
dally press can make public opinion by
exposing the evil-doer and boldly defend
ing the right. It is rare to find "a leading
dally in any city which dares attack the
monstrous evils which to-day threaten
our homes, our schools, our churches, and
which menace the very future of our dear
republic.
"The time is not far distant when great
dailies will be sustained in every city
which will become the avowed exponents
and representatives of the law-abiding
and Christian portion of the community
Such a paper soon gathers to itself the
support of a vast number of moral and
religious people, who strenuously object
to having the reliable news of the day
served to them in columns which are foul
with nauseating scandal and police court
details.
"The stirring need of this very day is
a mighty army of good men in politics
and in public affairs. So long as the no
blest citizenship refuses to be identified
with the affairs of government, lust so
long will our cities be controlled by cor
rupt boodlers and avaricious and con
niving political tricksters. When the
reins of civil government are held by men
of honesty and integrity and statesman
ship, then more of our daily papers will
be emboldened to defend the right and
severely denounce every evil which to
day threatens our land."

GRAND JURYMEN
WEARY OF DELAY.
They Request the Supervisors to Take the Building of
the Hall of Justioe Out of the Contractors'
Hands.
After waiting many weary months the Grand Jury has taken some
action, and the monument to a contractor's lassitude at the corner of
Washington and Kearny streets may in time, develop into what it
was originally intended to beâ the Municipal Hall of Justice.
The following communication from Foreman M. H. Techt to Mayor
Phelan and the Board of Supervisors is intended to stir the latter
into action and take the work out of the hands of Bateman Bros., a
move that would have been of immense benefit to the city had it been
made two years ago.
September 24, 1898.
To the Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor, and the Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco.
Gentlemen: The Grand Jury of the City and County of San Francisco,
by a unanimous vote, instructed us foreman to call your attention to the
fact that the last extension given tne contractors of tae Hall of Justice will
expire on the Ist day of October next, and inasmuch as the building is not
finished, nor nearly so, respectfully ask that you grant no further exten
sion, but enforce section 17 under the contract, reading as follows:
"If at any time during the currency of the contract the contractor
should not be making proper and reasonable progress with the work, or
should be unnecessarily delaying 1 the same, either by suspending the work,
by neglecting to provide sufficient and suitable materials or by not em
ploying a sufficient number of qualified workmen on the same so as to
insure the completion of the contract within the stipulated time; and on
demand of the architects shall fail to provide sufficient suitable materials
or to employ a sufficient number of efficient workmen as required by hlm|
or shomd in any way neglect to proceed diligently with the work, the ar
chitect shall be at liberty, after giving the contractor three days 1 notice in
writing of his intention* so to do, to provide such material and to employ
such workmen as he may consider necessary to proceed with the work,
and the cost of the same shall be charged to the contractor and the
amount deducted from any installment or balance due or becoming due
to him on account of the contract."
The Grand Jury regret that they cannot find a way to enforce more
drastic measures against such outrages upon the citizens of this city.
Respectfully, M. H. HECHT,
Foreman of- the Grand Jury of the City and Couuty of San Francisco.

WILL APPEAL TO THE CHIEF
"LONG SHOT" RATTIGAN AT

He Vigorously Defends the Course
of "Cold Feet" Wittmanâ More
Drums and Fifes Are
Purchased.
"Cold Feet" "Wittman has levied an
other assessment on his unfortunate sub
ordinates. This time they are compelled
to give up 25 cents each, the total amount
to be used in purchasing instruments for
the now famous fife and drum corps.
Not satisfied with taxing the men for
swords for himself and sergeants and in
cidentally to provide him with a pair of
foot-warmers, the Central station cap
tain has the audacity to ask his men to
again loosen their purse strings and finan
cially assist in providing the fife and
drum corps with the necessary musical
instruments.
"When the officers of the Southern sta
tion learned of the arbitrary assessment
levied by Wittman they consulted Captain
Splllane and asked permission to contri
bute sufficient money to buy drums for
two of their fellow members who were
forced to join the drum corps of "Frosty
George."
Captain Spillane offered no objection,
and in a short time they had raised
enough money to purchase the drums.
The instruments are far superior to the
ones used by the Central station crowd,
and, strange to say, did not cost as
much.
"Say, youse fellers think that yer got
me friend George agin the ropes, but yer
not on ter the game. See?" enthusiastic
ally remarked "Long Shot" Rattigan to a
crowd of policemen who were considering
the advisability of appearing before the
Police Commissioners and appealing to
them to prevent Wittman from further
depleting their finances.
"He's dead next and don't yer make any
mistake. Youse guys is always lucking
about what yer have to give up. Look at
me and Murphy. Last week we had to
give up enough stuff to start a sausage
factory. We didn't kick. Not on yer life.
We're dead game sports and know a good
thing when we see it, and that's no jolly,
either. Mose â I mean me old pard Gunst j
â has come back ter civilization and yer I
can bet yer pile that he will come out on !
top. I know Lees is agin htm, but that
cuts no figure. Him and George have nad
a talk already, and as they understand
each other, there's liable to be a warm
time when the Commissioners meet agin.
Mose won't be downed, and as me friend
George is a stayer from the old school yer
can play them for long sjiots, for tney
are sure winners. Say, I didn't mean to
say that. I don't like that expression
'long shot' as It hurts me feelings. I've
been well raised, and me mudder would
have a fit if she heard one of youse mugs
call me Long Shot.
"On the square. I feel like I had been
in the battle of Manila and got struck by
a Spanish shell. I must be off, as me and
George have a date to shoot the Chutes
to-night.
"S'long. If Mose shows up tell him
I'm still with him and ready to take off
me coat in case he gets the worst of it
from me former friend, tne Chief."
AN APPEAL FOB UNITY.
The Republican Anti-Civil Service
League Issues an Address to
Voters of the State.
The Republican Anti-Civil Service
League of California has Issued an ad
dress to voters, which says in part:
We feel that the threatened defection of the
thousands of Republicans who harbor a bitter
antipathy toward the so-called civil-service
dogma cannot but result in harm to the sue-
cessful accomplishment of the obJectÃ for
which the league is organized, to-wlt, the ob
literation oi the system from our form of gov
ernment through the instrumentality of con
stant and incessant agitation within the ranks
of Repuollcanlsm. Think of the results that
will accrue If we follow out consistently this
line of procedure. Ponder over the futility of
desertion from the ranks of a party that has
made this nation the greatest in which Repub
lican Institutions exist under the sunâ a party
to whose upbuilding and perpetuation Lincoln,
Grant, Blalne and the other brilliant minds in
the galaxy of Republican leaders gave their
magnificent mentality and prodigious energy.
It is true that President McKlnley is admit
tedly an advocate of the civil service dogma,
and stands committed to the insidious policy,
but this more properly is due to the fact that
in the platform of th*> Republican party was
covertly inserted a declaration in favor of the
policy. The President, to be consistent, of
course, is obliged to stand by this declaration,
and only by consistent and constant work on
the part of Republicans generaliy can an anti
civil service platform be adopted In 1900. This
movement has taken root In many States of
the American Union, and In the "Keystone"
and "Buckeye" States aggressive action has
been taken and the administration has not
been able to stem the tide. California is com
ing to the fore under the leadership of the
league, and there Is every reason to expect
that a solid Republican delegation to the next
national convention, opposed to civil sen-Ice,
will be selected. We hope Republicans will
see the necessity of earnest co-operation and
the burial of all animosities this year. That
SEPTEMBER 2*6, 1898.
they should stand shoulder to shoulder as onÂ©
man seems to admit of no doubt. Another
United States Senator who shall be a Republi
can Is one of the salient necessities of Califor
nia and a Republican Legislature Is of course
required to provide one. Every care should,
therefore, be exercised by the members of the
league In their respective districts, to the end
that the Republican candidates succeed at the
polls.
In a word support .the entire Republican
State ticket and help to strengthen the efforts
of the league thereby.
THE PARK WAS DESERTED.
The park, and, in fact, all the pleasure
grounds, where inadequate shelter is af
forded, had no attraction for the public
yesterday. The intermittent showers
from morning until night served the pur
pose of a steady downpourâ it kept lovers
of the open air in doors. At the baths
out by the ocean and the Chutes the
usual crowds congregated. There was
fun to be had at both places and it was
not overlooked. The fifty-yard dash in
the swimming contests at the baths was
won by C. Simpson; B. Hay, second. J.
Raymous won the under-water swimming
contest; A. J. Baker, second. R. B. Cor
nell won the obstacle race, with A. J.
Baker, second. In the 100-yard dash A.
Hay crossed the line ahead; G. Barnfleld,
second. A. J. Baker took first prize in the
spring-board diving contest; F. Raymous,
second. The Green brothers, Fred and
Dan. carried off the prizes in the high
diving contest. New attractions are of
fered next week and big crowds are ex
pected.
The Higher Criticism.
E. A. Woods, D.D., pastor of the First
Baptist Church, took for the topic of his
Sunday evening sermon the question,
"What Is the Higher Criticism?" and
discoursed interestingly upon that theme
in its highest meaning.
"Higher criticism," said Mr. Woods, "is
investigation into the authorship, mean
ing an.d origin of the books of the Bible
and the credibility of the history that
they contain. Higher criticism, how
ever, becomes destructive criticism if it
be not properly used, though the higher
does not tend to destroy one whit the
authority or inspiration of the old Testa
ment. The old Testament as we have it
was used and quoted from by our divins
Lord, and he indorsed it without reserve.
Why then may we not read it and use it
critically without fear that its beauty and
meaning may be lost to us."
Dewey Club Meeting.
An enthusiastic open-air meeting of the
Twenty-ninth District Dewey Club was
held yesterday at 2 o'clock. The
meeting was opened by P. B. Gallagher,
president. Among the speakers were J.
J. Cronan, Colonel M. H. Morgan, M. J.
Joice, M. H. Choice, John Conolly and
others. A committee on consolidation of
the various Dewey clubs of the city, com
posed of Messrs. Cronan, Gallagher and
Morgan, was appointed, to report at a
meeting to be held during the coming
week. John Conolly was appointed on
the committee on finance. The next
meeting of the club will be held in Odd
Fellows' Hall at a date to be decided
upon.
Norddeutscher Picnic.
The annual picnic and moonlight out
ing of the Norddeutscher Verein was held
yesterday at Shell Mounu Park. Despite
the indication thai, rain might fall at any
moment the attendance was lairly large
and everyone had a good time. On ac
count of the dampness most of the crowd
assembled in the big pavilion, where danc
ing was the order. As the dancing hall
is inclosed and warm the pleasure seekers
stayed until a late hour. Among the other
features was bowling for cash prizes and
a raffle for useful and ornamental arti
cles.
Saehr Wants to Be Recorder.
Harry Baehr, the well known insurance
man desires his friends and the general
public to understand" that he is a candi
date for the nomination for Recorder on
the Republican ticket. Futhermore, that
he has been "engaged in the fight for
many weeks." This announcement is due
to the fact that he aspired to be Auditor.
One for the Gaxnossi Kids.
The Gamossl Kids defeated the St.
Nicholas Giants by a score of 16 to 5 at
Sixteenth and Folsom streets grounds
yesterday afternoon. The feature of the
game was the clever battery work of
Eber and Fraser for the Kids.

FINISHING OF
MARKET STREET
IS DEMANDED
Citizens Want Bitu-j
men to Valencia.
ALSO TO GOLDEN GATE PARK 1
i
SUPERVISOR LACKMANN TALKS
FOR PROPERTY-OWNERS.
He Declares That There Is Money-
Wasted That Would Eas-
Ji ily Pay the
Â» Cost.
The announcement made by Street
Superintendent Ambrose, in an interview
In The Call yesterday, that he should ad
vise the Supervisors to suspend bitumin
ous paving operations on Market street
beyond Sixth because of a scarcity of
funds was the occasion of much surprise
on the pan of citizens generally and
caused considerable adrverse comment.
The majority of taxpayers have all along
favored the repaying of Market street
with bitumen throughout Hts entire length
and have preferred to give this Improve
ment precedence over others as one of
the most needed at the present time. The
. supposition has been general that, with
the street appropriation as largo as last
year, there would be sufficient money to
finish Market street out to Valencia and
perhaps to bituminize the connecting side
Btreets, so as to form a continuous
Bmooth pavement out to Golden Gate
Park. The fact that the Superintendent
of Streets takes an entirely different
view of the matter has, therefore, been
received frith many expressions of as
tonishment.
Supervisor Lackmann, when he heard
of the position of Superintendent Am
brose In the matter, was not slow to ex
pros? an opinion of his own. "I don't
understand." said he. "why Market street
cannot be payed with bitumen out as far
as Valencia. There ought to be enough
m mey In the street fund not only to do
the work but to carry out other pro
jected Improvements. In my opinion
Democratic- mismanagement in the Hoard
of Supervisors has had much to do with
the heavy expenditures and small bene
ficial results. With proper handling of
the public money ana reasonable econ
omy, with the lopping off of useless
salaries ami an epoch of Republican re
trenchment, there is no reason why the
Street Department, as well as all other
(i.p;.rtments of the city government,
shouid not be able to accomplish twice
as great results and still keep the taxes
down to a proper figure. Only a few days
ago I was talking with a prominent drug
gist on Market street, and he expressed
his belief that property-owners and ten
ants -ill along the thoroughfare were
anxious not only to have the repaying
with bitumen carried out as far as Va
lencia street, but that they wanted to
have bitumen laid on those connecting
streets which form a continuous line of
travel out to Golden Gate Park. This
druggist said he had talked with many
others In business along Market street
and every' one was of the same mind.
They all wanted the bitumen out to the
park for business reasons. "Make a fine
drive, a smooth, noiseless thoroughfare,
â from the foot of Market street out to the
park.' said he, "and it will tend to de
velop business by centralizing travel
along Market street and the connecting
streets. 1, for one, stand ready and will
ing to subscribe money out of my own
pocket if necessary in order to get the
Lltumen out to Valencia street and also
to the park. Others are willing. It Is
merely a good mercantile proposition.
Trade and traffic will follow those streets
which are bituminized. The residents of
San Francisco are tired of driving over
rough, cobblestone pavements or even
walking along them and being annoyod
by the din so that it is almost impossible
to talk and be heard.'
"That man's ideas are the ideas of
nearly all of our citizens," continued Mr.
Lnokmann, "and while ' I do not know
that any private subscription tf) continue
bitumen paving work will be started, it
is quite certain that there is a strong
feeling In favor of taking up more cob
bles and putting bitumen in place there
of. In fact, 1 am informed that a sub
scription for bituminizing Market street
wns seriously considered lust before the
Supervisors ordered the work com
menced.
"My position in the Board of Supervi
sor.- will l;e emphatically In favor of fln
lshlnÃ Market street with raiumen at
least as far as Valencia street. Then 1
shall advocate the bituminizing of side
streets."
A number of San Francisco people who
have recently been in the Kast and have
observe.) the .superior character of the
asphalt pavements laid in Chicago, St.
Louis. Cincinnati nnu other cities, are
asking why asphalt is not given a fair
trial In this city. It Is a California prod
uct and is taken to Eastern cities at great
expense in order to mrnish paving mate
rial of the best clr.ss. The asphalt la
harder than bitumen and will stand heav
ier trafllc without noticeable wear. In
the city of Cincinnati, for instance, as
phalt lias been down on Race street for
over ten years and has been subjected to
the heaviest traffic. The surface Is as
good as new. It does not soften v in
warm weather.
A well known city contractor, in speak
ing of the failure to try asphalt In San
Francisco, said yesterday: "The reason
is not far to seek. Never since, the South
ern Pacific gained co trol in local affairs
has there been any chance to bring aÂ»
phnlt Into use. The management of the
road i? against it. Bitumen comes In its
crude shape to the city and the road gets
a big proiit from hauling the stuff. As
phnli. on the other hand,' Is not nearly so
profitable, inasmuch as only one-sixtfi as
much In bulk has to be hauled. As you
know, asphn.lt when prepared for laving
on streets Is a composite material con
taining only one-sixth of real asphalt a
largo part of the residue being sand. Of
course the railroad company cannot make
anything out of the sand nroposltlon aa
sand is too plentiful In this Immediate
vicin'tv and It doe* not see the wisdom
of hnii'lrp one-sixth as much asphalt as
it new hauls of bitumen.
"It has long been an open secret nmonjr
the initiated thn.t there Is a little com
mission of 25 cent? on each ton of bitu
men nnld by somebody to certain city
offlcln'F. who are consequently interested
in lirirrrine all the material -osalble to
this cltv. T'nriprstand. I do not object to
the bitumen itself as n navlne material
but It does sr^-m too bad that there should
be n rake-nff for eertnin Supervisors
growing out of Its use."
SINGLE TAX AND TRAMPS.
Rev. Mr. Dugan Lays Them Both on
the Griddle. '
Rev. W. E. T>iiean. in a sermon
preached last night at the Stewart Me
morial Second fnltod Presbyterian
Church on Guerrero and Twenty-third
st roots, tonchrd upon "political bosses"
IHs text was taken from Matt, xvll'l4
In part ho Paid:
"As Poter. being on the Mount of Trans
figuration. cam* 1 down to the multitudes
so the political host-os, pretending to come
from the Mount of Transfiguration in
political things, arc bringing us schemes
and theories as to how we sh'.uld vote
In order to drive the evil from our lives
but do you all understand what flip
"single-tax" means? It means a revolu
tion of our social and financial systems 1
It means a different foundation for our
Government. But whether Hiich a change
would be for better or worse I want you
afc intelligent voters, to post yourselves
by reading pood authorities for and
against the single-tax system.
"A subject that should bo taken up by
our political parties is the subject of
tramps, this groat horde in our land who
scorn to think that respectable people
were created for their special benefit.
These are the social nuisance in the world
to-dayâ more threatening than the liquor
traffic. P.egginp has become a paying pro
fession with them because of peoples'
generosity. I want a political platform
which proposes to gather these men up
and make them do public service on our
streets and in our parks."
CURTIS' BOGS
CARRY OFF
THE HONORS
Run One, Two, Three
at Union Park.
SARAH A SMART YOUNGSTER
CREATES A GOOD IMPRESSION
ON HER FIRST CHASE.
A Number of Long Courses, With
Heavy Betting, Enliven the
Leashmen's Sport â Big Day
at Ingleside.
The greyhounds from the kennel of
Curtis & Son carried everything before
them in the open stake at Union Coursing
Park yesterday. Rosette, Cavalier and
McKlnley. all representing the leashman
from Santa Clara, worked thetr winning
way into the fifth round of the stake.
Rosette met Van Cloie and sent her to the
kennel, thus leaving only the thre* dogs
representing Curtis In for the stake. The
final was not run, first, second and third
money being taken by Curtis.
The short -enders were successful in the
flrst three courses of the day, Llghtfoot
putting out Sweet Lips with odas of 5 to
, 1 against him; Black Patti doing the
same with Magnet, and Jersey l,uy de
feating Rusty Gold, the odds beinÂ«r 10 to 1
against. After that the favorites asserted
: themselves, the only short-enders to win
being Laurelwood and Van Cloie.
The sapling stake developed a new won
der in R. K. de B. Lopez's Sara. She is
only nine months old, and has all the
marks of a stake winner. In the third
round of the sta-ke she met Marjoria.
i They had a long, gruelling course, which
1 Sara ultimate! v won. but which spoiled
i any chances she may have had for the
stake. She lowered her colors to T. H.
.Rosseter's Rollicking Airs in the final.
I Coursing men predict that she will be
! heard from again.
â¢ As the programme was shontened
; through the final of the open stake being
i omitted, an eight-dog consolation was ar
ranged. . Rosebud and Lord Scattercash
] were the first brace sent to the slips, the
' latter winning after an exceptionally long
course. The final was between Jersey Lily
| and Trinket. The course proved a heavy
betting affair, Trinket â  being Installed j.
â¢ slight favorite. The hare favored the
Lily, and she won, much to the Joy of the
! short-enders.
It was announced that J. H. Rosseter's
i For Freedom and Curtis & Son's Rosette
\ would meet in a special match, two out
of three courses, next Sunday. The de

PATRIA AGAIN IN FORM.
She Captures the Champion Stake at
the Ingleside Coursing Park.
A grand day's coursing was afforded
yesterday at the Ingleside Coursing
Park. The rain of the night before put the
ground in ideal condition for the hounds
to show their speed.
The Champion stake was won by the
well-known bitch Patria, who has just
rounded Into form and she made a fine
showing. The runner-up was that good
bitch Soubrette, the property of D.
Shannon. She was in fine fettle and
showed the careful training of Trainer
Lynch. She atood a good chance to win
the stake, but in running a bye with
Royal Buck, previous to the finals, she
had a severe gruelling and her owner de
cided to withdraw her aE she was in no
condition to run. The stake accordingly
went to Patria. who earned all Â»he won.
The betting public played every course
in a lively manner, but the short.enders
were the forturtates. taking home all the
money. In one instance five short-end
ers won in rapid succession. False Flat
terer was out of condition yesterday and
was retired in the second ties by Patria
by a score of 12 to 1. Mlra Monte, run
ning under the Bame owners name, was
also defeated handily by Soubrette,
showing that It takes careful training
as well as blood to win. Sharkey was
the idol of the short-enders and made a
number of grandstand runs, but eventu
ally met his defeat as far down as tha
fifth ties. Golden Russet and Mountain
Beauty were both withdrawn early in
the day, owing to the long courses that
they had run. The latter dog ran a
course lasting over thrje and a half min
utes, defeating Royal Priae by a score of
29 to 19.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26. 1898.
GOSSIP OF
THE SPEEDY
GALLOPERS
The Meetings at Los
Angeles.
NO DEARTH OF GOOD RIDERS
RILEY GRANNAN REPORTED
BROKE AND IN DEBT.
California Horses Finish One, Two,
Three at Gravesend â Retire
ment of if. L. Frank of
Butte.
The scene will shift from Sacramento to
: Los Angeles next week, and' the meetings
' In the Angel City will last for about three
! and a half, weeks, the : first ten days of
I racing being under the auspices of tne
j Los Angeles Fair Association, the last
two weeks under that of the California
j Jockey C!ul>.
Saturday, October 29, the racing will be
gin at the Oakland track, and an effort
: will be made to race a month there and a
'â  month at Ingleside., the clubs alternating
!In this manner until the racing season
; ends on the lat of May. The Indications
! are that the coming meetings will be fully
; as good from a racing standpoint as those
I that preceded them, If, indeed, they are
; not better, for. Pat Dunne. Kugene l^eigh
\ and several more prominent owners of
' gallopers that were not present last wln
i ler-huve expressed their determination to
: come out and tempt the Goddess of For
] tune to cast a BUnny smile upon them.
As to the riding talent, we shall greatly
, miss Tod Sloan, Willie Martin and "'Long
Shot" Conley, but >1. Turner, the brothers
KeitT. Sims and Doggett are likely to
make the trip to the Golden State, and
several good pilots are almost sure to be
developed. J. McDonald and Spencer,
born In this State, have turned out won
derfully wellâ in fact are regarded as
: stars of the saddleâ n.nd with Clawson,
: Piggott. Thorpe, "Skeets" Martin, Hen
nessy and others mentioned there will oe
no dearth of pigskin talent.-
There were seven books on the first day
of the Sacramento meeting, now in pro
gress, ami this represents most of the
i California bookmakers now In the State.
; ith George Rose, represented by two
! books in the big ring, Barney Schreiber
1 with two, Eek^rt & O'Neil, William jack
! man Joe Rose, William Fitch, EliePer
| les, Hugh Jones, John Coleman, Jim Da
j vis and perhaps George Walbaum, Leo
I Mayer and Joe Ullman, there will be funy
; twenty books in operation when the lirst
bell rings.
As â¢to the horses that wfll be here to
compete for the stakes and purses, one
can only speuk in a general way. U&St
yÂ»ar th,ere were close to 1100 in training at
the two tracks, and there is no reason to
suppose we will see a smaller number this
season.
California-bred horses ran one, two,
three in a mile and a half hurdle race at
Grave send track September 17. They were
Tantris (by Imp. Sir Modred-Sister "to Jim
Douglas*. Manchester (by imp. Sir Mod
red-Parthenla), and Governor Budd (Dy
Fresno-Rosa B). All were bred at Rancho
del Paso, too. There were nine in the
race, but these were the only Califor
nians.
Among the horses owned by R. F.
Meyers, ruled off at Chicago recently tor
fraud In the Tusculum case, was Dayton
Star, a three-year-old, sister to iiunis &
Waterhouse's grand horse Mt. Mc-
Gregor 11.
Sugar Foot, raced In California in
Barney Schrelber's colors, won recently
over the Fort Erie track.
It is stated on the very best of au
thority that "Plunger" Riley Grannan is
not only "broke," but in debt to the ex
tent of thousands of dollars. "Pltts
burg Phil" is' the only plunger that the
bookmakers haven't been able to sepa
rate from his coin in a tussle lasting a
good many years. Hundreds have gone
up like a sky rocket (in a financial sense)
and come down like a hundred pounds of
putty, but the ex-typo of the Plttsburg
Dispatch doesn't seem to "go broke
worth a cent. Those in a position to
know declare that "Phil" is worth a good
half million of I'ncle Sam's shining silver
dollars If he's worth a copper cent. It is
doubtful if he ever will operate in Cali
fornia again, for he "swore off" on the
Golden State's racing game the last time
he was out hereâ "out and Injured," to
make it stronger. He wrestled with the
California grizzly three or four times and
each time bruin had the best of the ar-
gument.
Johnny Campbell, who trained H. L.
Frank's horses here la6t winter, has
reached Hawthorne with a string of
twelve gallopers, which he leased of Mr.
Frank. Speaking of 11. L. Frank, he Is
perhaps the heaviest loser in the racing
game In the country, and it was rather
expected he would retire from the turf
when the end of the Anaconda meeting
came. And he would have been a winner
if he had confined himself to betting on
his own gallopers, which had considerable
class. But if most any owner of a "dog"
thought he "had a chance" he would go
at once on a hunt for Mr. Frank, who
would bet anywhere from $250 to $2000
and "split it in two" if the flyer hap
pened to win. which it seldom did. Tne
result was therefore to be expected. The
wealthy Butte man* got tired and dis
gusted with "the game" and doubtless
curses the day he became a lover of thÂ»
sport of kings. While it will probably
never be known Just how much Mr.
Frank i 8 behind over his turf specula
tions. It is hinted that JIfiO.OOO is not far
from the markâ this in a little over a
short year's time, too.
Among the most successful players in
the country this season Is Harry Kail
man of this city. He is over $20,000 to the
good since the meetings ended here last
May and is now the owner of eight gal
lopers, among the number Miss Tenny,
a frequent winner. He is also the pos
sessor of a brother of Zampost and a
brother to Perhaps.
Socialist Meeting.
A. IT. Sanborn of this city spoke on
"Reform and Reformers" before the So
cialist Labor party gathered together at
Washington Hall last night for discussion
and lectures. Mr. Sanborn, after a short
historical Rvnopsls of the reform move
ment in politics and sociology, treated of
the big social reformers, comparing their
methods and successes.

A SCANDAL
CAUSED THE
HUMILIATION
Alameda's Fusion Isof
a New Brand.
WORDS THAT NOW BURN
COMPLAINT OF WASHINGTON
NOT WITHOUT REASON.
Non-Partisans May Try to Work
Out the Plans of Certain In
terests Opposed .to
Pardee.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 25.
With all her experience of politics and
the ways and wiles of politicians, Oak
land has never been treated to such an
opera bouffe performance as that placed
en the boards yesterday by the combined
political marionettes, who, after ten
hours of quarreling, finally nominated a
county ticket.
The delegates must have returned to
their homes last night wondering why on
earth they had br-n called together. Dur
ing the past week a few dissatisfied Re
publicans, some Populists and Cleveland
Democrats have been talking about an
imaginary thing, yclept a "slate " that
appeared at the Republican convention
last Monday. Blind, deaf and Incapable
of exercising any one of his senses must
be he who failed to see the iron-bound
elate that was presented to the assembled
delegations yesterday. The slate was fu
sion on certain lines and for nine hours
the factions quarreled and publicly and
privately denounced each other in their
vain efforts to knock a hole in that slate.
Thanks to the "iron rule" of rion. M. P.
Tarpey, who knew what was wanted, and
also how to obtain it, the programme
â went through without a hitch. That It
was nauseating, objectionable, repugnant
und unpopular was proved by the speech
es of Robert M. Fitzgerald, Warren B.
English, Attorney T. F. Garrity and Alex
Kosborough, who represent nearly all the
elements in Alameda Democracy.
But there was no option. Fusion had
been promised Maguire and fusion had to
go through, and it did.
"This is a Democratic convention,"
shouted Mr. Garrlty, '"and we were called
here not to take the part of puppets at
Borne variety show, out to eloct a Dem
ocratic ticket, and I move that we pro
ceed." (Howls.)
"Gentlemen," said ? Mr. Fitzgerald, ',
chairman *of the â¢ fusion committee, ,"I
have run around after those Populists, â 
trying to arrive at some sensible proposi- >
tion with regard to iusion. I am con
vinced no reasonable basis can be at- !
tamed, and I for one do not propose to be
bothered with them any longer." (Wild
howls.)
"Mr. Chairman," shouted Alex Rosbor
ough, "this is a howling farce. Why'
should we bend the knee to a lot of Pop
ulists or â¢ Silver . Republicans â whatever
they-araâ dissatisfied- Kt>pubjica-rvÂ» or â
metalilsts. We are etltifying and hu
miliating ourselVes by continuing this de
pradlng show. For uod's sake let us be
Democrats and acknowledge that there
are at least enoueh good men 1:. the party
in Aiameda County to name a ticket. ;
(Wilder howls.) ..r â 
"Mr. Chairman, I move that we pro
ceed to carry out the provisions of the ,
call by virtue of which we are i here," '
shouted Warren B. English. "Let us put
up a Democratic ticket from top to bot
tom and proceed at once." (The conven- ,
tion went crazy.)
Tho above quotations and the results '
were a few that were uttered at yester
day's convention while the "great and !
honored" party of Jefferson In Aiameda |
County waited upon tho result of its :
squabble between Sheriff White and his j
friends and J. W. Dutton and his friends." j
Sheriff White was a candidate to succeed j
himself, but could not be nominated by j
the -Democrats, consequently the Popu- j
lists wanted that office conceded to them.
About a year ago Mr. Dutton,' who is a
widower, fell In love with a young lady
against her mother's wishes, and aa the
aged lover refused to desist the - Sheriff
discharged Mr. Dutton, wfi. was one of '
his deputies. On this little scandal hung
the fate of fusion, and it was solely re
sponsible for all the Indignities which
each of the parties heaped upon the other
during' the "ht hours of waiting and
quarreling in committee rooms yesterday j
afternoon.
Mr. Dutton took an oath that White
should not be nominated. The Populist
delegates determined that he should. Mr.
Dutton did all in his power to prevent the
Democrats from conceding the office of
Sheriff to the Populists, and hÂ» succeed
ed. Mr. Dutton won out. Mr. White did
not get his nomination. The old man's
revenge for . his wrecked romance was
attained, and Aiameda County is now :
enjoying the Joke gratis. A ticket which ;
depended upon such an Impolitic adjust
ment can hardly appeal to the intelligence
and sober thoughts of an intelligent
county.
Perhaps the best thing done by the ,
Joint conventions was that which fell to
the part of the Silver Republicans, and
although It was probably gratifying to j
them to have an office conceded them It. ;
Is not easy to understand just what they !
gained. They, nominated . the j Republican j
nominee for Assessor. Henry P. Dalton, !
whoso election was already assured by Â»
the fact of his former nomination. An
other peculiar feature of the action of |
the Silver Republicans is that their lead- j
ers are generally Bupposed.to be not un- i
friendly to the railroad company, and '
yet they indorsed the most pronounced \
anti-railroad man Aiameda County has !
brought forward with -the exception of
John L. Davle or George C. Pardee.
The conventions sat too long. . They for
got the business which had called them
together. In fact, Mr. English, once of j
Congress, may be fairly said to have been |
trapped. When Chairman Fitzgerald re- j
ported, ihat tho office of Assessor - had
been conceded to the Silver Republicans, j
It did not seem to dawn upon the old
time Democrats that their convention
would, by approving such a report take ;
the office of Assessor entirely out their i
hands. So the report was adopted. After- i
ward it dawned on Warren English that I
something was wrong when the nomina
tion for Assessor was reached and Chair
man Tarpey calmly announced that the
office having been left to the Silver Re
publicans they had nominated Henry P.
Dalton. Mr. English undoubtedly found ,
some" satisfaction in the little fiery speech -
he delivered, but in criminal parlance,
"the jig was up." It. was of course no
surprise to hear Mr. English denouncing
something, or somebody, because the
whole day had been given up to denuncia
tions, but it was a very bitter pill for
"the- great and honored party of Jeffer
son" i to- swallow a Republican nominee
for an exalted office. In this respect the
combined - conventions - played Into ' the
hands of the Republicans, making the so
called fusion more confused than ever.
It would have been better had the Re
publican County Convention placed the
nomination for County Superintendent of
Schools in Washington Township. Not a
. word can be breathed against Mr. Water-
J^ man of Berkeley who received the nomi
nation, and the policy of putting the
i omlnation in the township is one purely
of K^ography and not of personality. In
framing a ticket the whole county needs
to be welded together as much as is pos
sible, in the present instance, It would
have been not only possible but politic to
nominate Mr. Lynch of Washington for
Superintendent of Schools. "Washington
Township is the only section of the
county that has not representation. There
is over a s=cnre of county offices, but there
are only seven wards and six townships,
and it is not unreasonable that each divi
sion should have one candidate. "Wash
ington's delegation went home dissatis
fied, and their local Republican paper at
once expressed ItÃ discontent. They asked,
and not without reason, why they went
to a county convention with a delegation
solid for their favorite and came back
with nothing. The office of County Super
intendent of Schools is an office that
should be filled by a man from the In
terior of the county as logically as a
Supervisor should be elected from his
proper district. The Superintendent has
no jurisdiction whatever over the schools
of the cities and yet a city man Is always
nominated for the office. Mr. Lynch is a
county school principal, and although
their disappointment is bitter it is to be
hoped that Washington Township will be
at least recognized after the election, when
several good ajid lucrative deputyships
will have to be filled.
It is hard to divine the exact purpose
for which the so-called non-partisan
movement is springing up at this time.
Four years ago a certain dissatisfied ele
ment put up a ticket under the Non-
Partisan heading, but elected nobody, al
though they made the election of several
Populists possible. These Non-Partisans
claim to be Republicans, and many of
them have taken a leading part In Re
publican demonstrations. XI this particu
lar time policy would seem to dictate that
they use their efforts to cement the party
rather than gratify personality and self
ishness by attempting to break it up. If
their purpose be to take up several so
called independent candidates and amal
gamate them into a county ticket on the
ground of "purity and reform" It would
be well for them to Inquire deeply Into
the records of some of those whom they
would assist and compare them with
those of men already nominated.
An analysis of the situation suggests
that the movement is being brought
about by Interests antagonistic to Dr.
Pardee. At the close of the Sacramento
convention. Colonel McLaughlin stated
that Dr. Pardee was the logical successor
to the Republican nominee for Governor.
Since the opening of the county cam
paign. Dr. Pardee has personally done
much to help the Republican cause, and
has pledged his support to every man on
the ticket from Governor to Constable.
It would, therefore, seem to be but rea
sonable to expect every Republican
worthy of the name to keep in line this
year more than ever, but although the
danger Is small, there yet appears to be
a disposition on the part or a few to
obtain notoriety by risking a party repu
tation which they have done little to
upbuild or maintain.
One of the most absurd statements i
made by the conglomerate parties is that j
relating to Supervisor Talcott. For four '
years Mr. Talcott has faithfully repre- i
sented his district, and every cyclist, j
teamster and dairyman ie now a unit j
in bearing testimony to the splendid con
dition of the roads in his large territory, i
Four years ago when he was elected Mr. j
Talcott faced a difficult tusk. His dis- :
trict had run down and there was much |
dissatisfaction. In fact, a strong effort i
was made to elect a Democrat to the of- ,
nee. During his term old John Talcott i
has been aa faithful a servant as Ala- '
meda County ever had, while he has not !
done cheap politics or played to the gal- ;
lery every time the occasion arose. Cer- 'â 
tain interests are anxious to secure con- !
trol of the Board of Supervisors, and al- !
ready they are assailing 'Honest John j
Talcott." I have seen Mr. Talcott vote
hundreds of times in the Board of Super
visers, and I do not believe any one ever
voted more conscientiously. Talcott Is â 
not a politician, but a business man of
honor and integrity, and this opinion is
that expressed by his district and not by !
a little coterie always anxious to plaster '
its friends with pruise.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1893.
ST, PATRICK'S
WILL GIVE A
GRAND BAZAR
A Large Church Fair
for the Old Parish.
THE FIRST IN ITS HISTORY
AID NEVER BEFORE SOLICITED
FROM THE OUTSIDE.
The Festivities Will Be Opened
by Governor Budd on
Next Wednesday
Evening.
The grand bazar to be held by St.
Patrick's Church will be opened at the
hall, 744 Mission street, promptly at 8
o'clock next "Wednesday evening, and
from the extensive preparations already
made It promises to be one of the most
successful parish fairs ever held in the
city.
Governor Budd has kindly consented to
open the bazar. The chief executive of
the State and his staff will be In the
hall at exactly 8 o'clock. Special music
has been prepared for the occasion and
it needs no prophet to predict that the
event will be one to be long and pleas
antly remembered.
During the more than forty-seven years
of the existence of the parish it has never
yet had a fair or bazar, nor has it ever
received money from any source other J
than from the ordinary- revenues. In |
years gone by when very many wealthy j
Catholics lived In the pariah, the money j
received from the ordinary revenues was
sufficient for all necessary purposes. But
of late years many of the wealthiest :
residents moved away from the district, |
bo that the parish is now composed for j
the most part of the working clauses.
But upon the working classes the port
few years have been exceptionally severe,
and hence, although the parishioners at
present are liberal according to their â 
means, yet when any work beyond the â 
ordinary has to be done, as the repair- ,
ing of the church and the building of a
parochial residence, which are necessary'
at present, an appeal for outside help,
un appeal particularly to their friends i
and former fellow-parishoners, becomes
an absolute necessity.
During the bazar an entertainment
will be given each evening by the dif
ferent booths in turn, and each day
while the bazar lasts lunch will be
served from 11 to 2.
Following are the names of those who
will be in charge of the booths:
i Children of Mary boothâ President. Mrs. T. !

SCHUETZEN'S
MARKSMEN
ON A HOLIDAY
Old-Timers All at the
Targets.
EGGING LEADS FOR KING
GOOD SCOIIES MADE DESPITE
DARK WEATHER.
The Shooting Is Up to the Old
Standards, and There Is No
Abatement in In
terest.
The regular autumn shoot of the Cali
fornia Schuetsen Club opened yesterday
morning at Schuetzen Park range, and
from ever}' standpoint the first day of the
meet was a big success.
Despite a somewhat dark day the scores
marie were up to the standard set at past
festivals, and there was no falling off in
the attendance.
For the old-timers at the butts the day
was practically a reunion. D. W. Mc-
Laughlin, king during the past year;
Adolph Strecker, John I'tsehig, Captain
Kuhis and Philo Jaooby. with a host of
others, were on hand and kept the range
6moking from 9 in the morning until dark
nesa shut out the targets.
The point targets were given most at
tention at the first day's shoot, few en
tered in the honorary list and only two in
the king shootâ Chris Egging and Adolph
Strecker. Of these Egging led at the end
of the day, with 71 to Streeker's 70. To
day will decide who is to wear the crown
and diamond medal of the king. These
attributes to Schuetzen royalty have
adorned Dave McLaughlin during the
past year, but the two big scores of yes
terday put Egging and Strecker in the list
of favorites, and one or the other is
looked to for big shooting to-day.
The banging of ritlos and the rattling of
bullets against the backs was by no
moans Incessant. At noon every one gave
his weapon time to cool while a tasteful
banquet was indulged in. Vice-Presi
dent Kahwyler as toastmaster addressed
the jolly crowd and extended "goot heil"
to the visiting' marksmen, Jacob Myer,
president of Helvetia Club of Sacramento;
C. Berge and Jacob Gruhler of the same
town and J. G. McMillan of the San Jose
Riflemen. After the visitors had duly
responded a cablegram from Sergeant
Albert Ehrenpfori, who, with twenty
others of the club numbers, is with the
First California at Manila, was read, and
the greeting it carried brought every
marksiuan at table -to his feet with a
cheer lor the absent ones.
The message was as follows: "I am
sorry that I cannot be with you to-day,
but I am with you in spirit."
Among those who responded to a call
for toasts were Jacob Myer, Judge Bahrs
and J. D. McMillan, who all spoke under
the proviso that politics be eschewed.
Thf shooting of the second and final day
will begin at 9 o'clock this morning and
will continue until half-past 4. The
prize list and scores as they stood at the
end of yesterday's work are as follows:

BIFLE AT SHELL MOUND.
A Fair Attendance and a Number of
Good Scores Were Made.
Everything considered, there was a fair
attendance of riflemen at the- Shell Mound
rille range yesterday. Many went ti.ere
early in the morning and left on the noon
trains (or the big shoot in Marin County

While tlic-r.? was no wind to speak of, the
light was about as bad as could be ex
perienced, ('hanging every few minutes
and throwing tin* sights out of kilter. A.

Very Tame and Unsatic
factory.
The two days' match, begun September
18, between teams representing the cities
of Alameda and San Francisco, were con
tinued yesterday on the Alameda ground.
On tho first day of the play San 1-ran
cisco, with a score of 132 runs against
Alamcda's 74, had secured a lead of 58
runs.
The heavy rain of Saturday night had
rendered the ground most unfavorable to
high scoring and none of the San Francis
co team made any serious stand against
the bowling of Peel and Croll. Out of
fourteen completed overs Peel bowled six
maidens and took 4 wickets for 15 runs.
<_ mil took 2 wickets for 23 runs. J. Meyers
waa run out, while J. McLean, H. H.
Copkson and F. C. Drfffielfl were absent.
fhe only batsman who secured double fig
ur. s was J. J. Moriarity. who made 20.
The eeven wickets were all down for 39
runs and the innings closed. The San
Francisco men having made 132 runs in
their first innings their total score for
1.., i1l innings amounted to 171 runs.
The Alameda men then went to the bat,
two men short, J. H. Saunders and I. H.
Spiro being the absentees. Though they
made a somewhat. larger score than the
San Franciscos, they were disposed of by
fewer balls, Sewell bowling" only 8 overs
and Hogue 7 overs and 2 balls. The only
SACRED HEART CHURCH SOLEMNLY DEDICATED.
Impressive Ceremony Conducted by Archbishop Riordan â Man's
Duty to Himself and God Outlined-Charity Begins
at One's Own House of Worship.
t^WJ ITH solemn, formal and im
2o \/\/ presslve â¢ ceremony the new
SS II Church of the Sacred Heart
gg was dedicated yesterday morning by
c- Archbishop Riordan. As the little
procession of priests, acolytes, with
2S the Archbishop forming the central
25 figure, passed through and around the
oÂ» building, the structure in all Its parts
rl became a sanctified and consecrated
*Â° place of divine worship.
SS The ceremony of dedication imme
83 diately preceded the celebration of
solemn high mass and was both Im
pressive and inspiring. The exterior
was first blessed, the Archbishop be
ginning at the main entrance and
passing around the entire edifice
chanting the words which made and
converted the artistic pile of brick and
stone a place of worship and a house
of God. The dedication of the interior
immediately followed that of the ex
terior of the building. Every new
sacred article used in the celebration
of mass or erected for various pur
poses in the church proper was
blessed and consecrated before the
commencement of mass at 11 o'clock.
In the work of dedication the Arch
bishop was assisted by Rev. Father
Mulligan of St. Marys Cathedral and
Father Bvrne of the Sncred Heart
Parish. l)uring the progress of mass
these priests also assisted, each oc
cupying a scat of honor on either side
of the improvised throne erected for
the occasion in the sanctuary imme
diately to the left of the high altar.
The mass was solemn, high in form
and was celebrated by the Rev.
Father McSweoney of Oakland, who
was assisted by Father Powers of
Livermore as deacon and the Rev.
Father Brady as sub-deacon.
The dedicatory address was delivered
by the Rev. Father McNally of Oak
land, who eloquently outlined the pur
pose of the new church and the ne
cessity of a place of devotion where
the s6ul can seek a closer communion
with its God and become better quali
fied to combat sin and resist the
many snares which are woven for the
batsmen to obtain double figures were J j

Next month the visiting team from the
Placer County Citrus Colony will play two
matches In San Francisco, one against the
Alameda club and the other against the
Pacific eleven. It is not likely that the
"alphabetical" cricket game suggested by
Cecil Gardner will be playert, as it is con
sidered impracticable to get players from
Lakeport or Los Angeles to visit this city
to play only one match. One married
versus single match yet remains unplayed
and that might be pulled off next Sunday.
For the succeeding Sundays preceding the
visit of the Placer County team a two
days' match might be played between the
city players selected on an alphabetical
basisâ A to L versus Mto Z.
THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1898,
corruption of the soul through the
agency of the body. The entire dis
course was drawn from the text, "To
Seek the Kingdom of God Is the Nat
ural as Well as the Supernatural Ob
ject of the Soul." In the expansion of
this thought he said:
"Through religion the soul is .di
rected to a higher life. tYom it ema
nates purity and the highest state of
happiness possible here below. Hap
piness is a beautiful word. It is the
goal of our labors and our constant
toils. There is no happiness outside
of God. The word in its truest sense
means to live with God, and if we hope
for this result we have to abide by his
teaching and keep in constant commu
nion with him. To 'o this is the high
est life of the human soul.
"Where shall we go to exercise the
soul in the discipline of this life?
"We must strive for that beautiful
place of reward midway between the
earth and the upper regions of space.
To do this rightly we must come to
this beautiful church which is dedl-
cated to-day by his Grace the Arch
bishop for the preservation of the hu
man soul, and the glory of God.
"Aided by the kind people of this
parish we give to man and consecrate
to God a beautiful church of lasting
structure and magnificent design. We
found a temple to-day for me en
lightenment of the intellect, and we
give to those who are willing to pass
through its portals a place whore nicy
can learn by prayer and devotion that
command over passion that roraiÂ«
seldom, if ever, from a place outside
the sanctuary of God.
"The priest of this parish to whom
we owe the gratitude for the erection
of this imposing editiee is a man to be
respected and a pastor to be loved. He
does good, and by that good makes
his people happy, me Rood pastor of
this church has been and is employed
In a menial position. From door to
door, house to house, he has gone to
ask and almost bes for donations for
the erection of a building to the name
and glory of God."
At this Juncture in the panegyric on
the works of the pastor Father Mc-
Nally discontinued abruptly for the
reason, as he said, that the subject of
it was beckoning from the rear of the
church for him to desist.
Upon the conclusion of the digres
sion the original thought of the ad
dress was continued. Many beautiful
thoughts of the soul's communion
with God were eloquently expressed
and defined, and man's paramount
duty to himself and God thoroughly
outlined.
In conclusion he said that man

Santa Cruz Loses to Stockton in a
Whirlwind Game â Athletics Re

test With Watsonville.
By Joe Corbett.
Before an unusually large and enthusi
astic audience the famous. Gilt Edges,
with the generous assistance of the smil
ing fates, yesterday defeated the Oak
lands, by the uneven score of 7 to 2.
It took them the entire nine innings to
do it. but when finished there was doubt.
The Oaklands held the lead from the
fourth inning to the eighth. Moskiman,
who was doing the pitching, was almost
invincible, and had the heavy sluggers
from Sacramento at his mercy in all but
a second of one inning.
In the third inning with two men out,
Schmeermade an error which let In a run,
and with the game all but won the entire
team went to pieces in the ninth, and be
fore time was accorded them to recover,
six runs were recorded and a victory
thrown to the wind.
Never did a team make a show of itself
as did the Oaklands in that final inning,
or rather did Mr. Sullivan, for he alone
was responsible.
The contest was beautiful all through,
should lift up his heart to God and i
strive for the promised happiness in ,
the world to come. '
"Man," he continued, "should call .
aloud: 'Jesus, Jesue, my God, my all! ;
All I have is mv heartâ take it! \ou ,
gave me yours; take mine.' "
At the conclusion of the mass the ;
Archbishop addressed the congrega- ,
tlon briefly. He complimented them
on the sueeesful outcome of their ef- ,
forts and thanked them in the name ,
of the pastor for their generous sup
port and the enthusiasm with which .
they greeted the dedication of their .
new church. He expressed the hope
that the next improvement that would .
be made in the parish would be the j
remodeling of the old church to serve
the purpose of a school, an advan- I
tage i. .at is urgently needed. j
"It depends on the congregation, ,
he said, "for the fulfillment of this â¢
work. Another work which will have J
to be considered first, however, is the ,
completion of this church. It would â¢
be too bad to begin an enterprise and {
leave It incomplete. I am sure that
you will accomplish the work of erect
ing the new addition to the church
and accomplish complete adornment
and equipment of the interior of the
edifice proper. The present church is
large enough for the congregation.
R .â¢member that when you contem
plate assisting other churches out
sida your parish that charity well
ordained begins at home.
"In conclusion I would request that
you bear in mind that your first duty
as a Catholic is here. Love your
church, frequent it often. It will be
the means of a great consolence and
satisfaction to you, and I hope it will
be the means of your salvation."
The mass was chanted by a special
ly augmented choir under the able
direction of Miss Marie Short, the
organist-accompanist. In addition to
the organ there was a specially select
ed orchestra under the immediate
direction of Curt C. Davis.

SAN JOSE, Sept. 25.â The game of ball
this afternoon between San Jose and San
Francisco was a matter of scrambling in
the mud, with San Jose very much to the
bad at the close. In fact, it could not have
been any worse for the team, for they did
not got a run, while the visitors piled up
six points.
The base running was necessarily the
slowest ever seen on the grounds, for a
runner had to carry with him almost his
own weight In mud. The men jolted
around over the bases like Ice wagons and
the wonder is that any runs were made at
all. The ball also would almost always
stop dead In the mud whenever it Mt
the ground, and this, added to the uncer
tainty of the game and interfered with
the calculation of the players. In the
midst of it all San Jose got the mud
fever, and their batting arms were para
lyzed so that all hope of a run to save
the ignominy of a shut out was lost.
There was a fair attendance. The score:

THE ORPHANS'
FRIEND WOULD
FAIN RESIGN
Thinks a Younger Man
Is Better Adapted.
PROUD RECORD OF S. W. LEVY
TOILED FOR THE FATHERLESS
MANY YEARS.
Praiseworthy Work of the Hebrew
Orphan Asylum Since It
Came Into Existence
in 1871.
In his report to the officers and mem
bers of the Pacific Hebrew Orphan
Asylum and Home Society, S. W. Levy
a6ks the nominating committee, who are
to select candidates for the officers of
that organization for the ensuing year, to
release him from the duties performed
by him for nearly thirty years in the
capacity of president. The clause which
refers to the above reads as follows:
"Ladies and Gentlemen: I want to say
that \his society was Btarted In the fall
of 1871 and that I was elected its vice
president in the fall of 1872 and Its presi
dent in 1873. Having served In the latter
capacity ever sinee â a period of a quar
ter of a century â and not being any more
. a young man. I think it would be but
Just to myself and at the same time bene
ficial to the society, that you select as
your president at your next election a
younger man and one who could give his
active attention to the requirements of
the office. By doing so you will add
greater success and prosperity to our
noble society, which Is the desired goal of
our ambitions."
Mr. Levy, in addition to his connection
with the Hebrew Asylum, holds the sec
retaryship of the Associated Charities in
this city. He has made a life-time study
of the necessities and care of little
fatherless and motherless waifs. From
the institution which he now desires to in
trust to other hands he has provided for
over five hundred children, most of whom
have proved to be useful members to so
ciety, many of them having famllilies now
residing in this city. He adopted a cus
tom and strictly enforced it by which
no two wards of the institution are
dressed alike. This last rule relieves
many little hearts of humiliation which
arises from the knowledge that a tell-tale
garb designates them to all eyes as par
ticular objects of charity.
The income for the purpose of main
taining the society during the year
amounts to $25,6y0 85. This does not in
clude bequests and donations to the ex
tent of $14,614 10. The expenses for the
year have been $42,539 26, of which $30,
626 <>1 was expended for the asylum and
$11,912 3. r > for tho home.
The annual reports of the officers shows
rapid progress on the part of the wards
and an increase in the number of inmates
at the Old People's Home. It also shows
n decrr-ase in attendance at the orphan
age and of membership of the society.
Among those present at the meeting
was A. Anspacher, the philanthropist.
Several years ago Mr. Anspacher. fearing
that the income of the instiuitlon would
not support a band, donated $10,000 for the
purpose of musical instruction.
THE FIRST RAIN IN CAMP.
It Will Hurry Up the Requisitions
for the Necessary Tentage.
The first actual discomfort to the sol
diers at the Presidio was brought to the
troops on Saturday i.ight by tne heavy
downfall of rain. Many of the tents are
old and not waterproof, so that the men
had a rather disagreeable night of it.
Orders have been issued to each regi
mental commander that he see that the
proper requisitions for the necessary
tontage be at once Bent Into the brigade
quartermaster. This order was issued
week before last, and the rain will have
the effect of hurrying in the requisitions
to the quartf'rni^.T;iPr.

FORTUNE WITH NO CLAIMANT
Dr. de Freue Leaves Thousands of Dollars,
but No Heir Can Be Found.
There are several thousand dollars In Wells-Fargo and the German Sav
ings banks deposited to the credit of Dr. G. B. C. de Freye, who died in Vienna
on the 4th of last July, and all efforts to find an heir or claimant for the
fortune have been unavailing. As far as is known the doctor had no relatives,
and unless a lawful heir can be found the money, which must be turned into
the United States Treasury, will probably remain in possession of the Government.
Dr. de Freye was a pioneer physician of San Francsico. He came here
in 1867 and had quite an extensive practice from which he amassed a modest
fortune. At one time ho was a member of the State Board of Medical Ex
aminers and was prominent in his profession. An extensive tour of Europe,
lasting for years, caused the doctor to be almost forgotten until about six months
ago, when he returned and began to practice his profession in a small way at the
corner of Kearny and Washington streets. He was ill and crippled from an
accident in a gymnasulm in the East and told his banker that he did not need
to practice, but did it merely to occupy his mind. Last May he tried to buy
out a drug store at the corner of Montgomery and Filbert streets, but the pro
prietor did not wish to give up his business. Dr. de Freye seemed greatly dis
appointed and soon after left the city.
About the latter part of June the doctor registered at a hotel in Vienna and
here he remained until his death. He had intended to leave for a health re
eort on July 5. The evening before he went to his room and asked for a
pitcher of hot water. When the maid opened the door she found him lying
on the floor dead.
The United States Consul at Vienna has cabled to the banks here to find
If possible any relatives of the doctor. Careful inquiries have been made but no
claimants to the fortune can be found.

Bistant adjutant general. Captain Put

hopeless to ever try and imagine that re
spectable citizens can be made of the'na

the citizens of Hawaii are bad enough,
but when It comes to those of the Philip

Colonel Smith of the Tennessee Regi
ment has Informed General Miller that
his regiment will nay the damages as

the property of Zero Thomas by the men
of the regiment. Thomas has had his
property repaired and the money will be
paid this week.
All that now delays the departure of
the troops is the non-arrival of the trans
ports. The first of the returning vessels
should arrive here this week, and it will
take at least a week for them to recoal
and load supplies, so that they could not
hope to get away under ten days after
they make this port. The soldiers are
anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
ships.
A PICKPOCKET CAUGHT.
Arrested While at Work in a
Crowd at the Ferry Depot.
A young man giving the name of "Wil
liam Hansen and claiming to be a waiter
was arrested at the ferry depot yesterday
by Policemen Shaw and Ellis and charged
with grand larceny. The officers are de
tailed at the denot to watch for pickpock
ets, and during a rush of travel soon after
noon they noticed Hansen acting in a sus
picious manner. He was watched for
some time and was finally caught hurry
ing out of a crowd gathered about the
ticket window. He. was placed under ar- i
rest, and while being taken to the Har
bor station he attempted to throw away
a purse. In the purse were several vis
iting cards of Mrs. E. S. Howard and a
few dollars In silver.
The arresting officers had hardly flnihed
searching their prisoner when Dr. E. S.
Howard entered the station and reported
PRESIDENT S. W. LEVY, WHO WOULD RESIGN.
that his wife had lost her purse while in
a crowd at the ferry depot.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1898.
KENVILLE
RELEASED
BY A TRICK
Efforts to Save the
Assailant.
NO CHARGE AGAINST HIM
UNSAVORY METHODS OF THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT.
The Injured Lad Regains Conscious
ness and Strong Hopes Are En
tertained of His Ulti
mate Recovery.
"Don't go away. Mamma; my head
hurts bo, mamma, can't you make It
stop?"
Little Willie Lynch opened his eyes out
at the Receiving Hospital yesterday
morntngr. and for the first time since he
was stricken down by Policeman Frank
Kenvllle, thirty-six hours before, the light
of consciousness shone in his face. For
a time he seemed quite rational, then he
lapsed Into a state of semi-consciousness
in which he lay the greater part of the
day, arousing himself at times to satisfy
himself that his mother was by his side,
and to have his parched lips moistened,
for he is too weak to retain even a swal
low of water in his stomach.
Heavy-hearted "and heavy-eyed, for she
has scarcely slept since her boy was
brought to death's door, Mrs. Lynch can
hardly be persuaded to absent herself
from the little sufferer an Instant. There
are no tears in her eyes; sorrow has been
so frequent a visitor to her of late that
it seems as if the fountain of grief must
have run dry, and she can tind little
solace in the kindly assurance of big
hearted Police Surgeon Hartley, who is
almost as constant a watcher as the
mother, that there is a marked improve
ment in the boy's condition and a reason
able prospect of his ultimate recovery.
Willie may be restored to physical
healthâ the next twenty-four hours will
decide thatâ but if he should be, the dis
consolate woman is haunted by the fear
that his reason may be shattered and he
may be left entirely, dependent upon her
already overburdened hands. .
For the little fellow has, for months,
been the mainstay of the family.
Saturday night no profits from the sale
of newspapers were brought in by Willie,
and the two brothers and sisters left
alone in the three tiny, scant furnished
rooms at 166 Clara street, the family call
home, found at supper time a cupboard
almost as barren as the rooms them
selves. There is one boy two years older
than Willie, who also sells papers, but he
lacks the younger lad's keen business
ability, and without his brother to urge
him on to renewed efforts, customers are
apt to be forgotten and his papers remain
unsold. It was Willie who assumed re
sponsibility for the disposal of both
stocks, and it was he who saw that the
nickels went to the Clara-street home in
stead of being squandered in "crusoe"
and other juvenile games.
Around the corner of Market and Powell
streets Willie Lynch became known as
the "Cashier," and when his sister took
him his frugal supper each night and
waited while he ate it she was entrusted
with the day's receipts, except what was
needed for change, to deliver to the
mother. During the war excitement Wil
lie often turned in $1 25 to $1 50 a day,
but those days are post, and of late his
earnings have been considerably less, but
they represented approximately the total
Income of the family. Since the Injury to
the boy's father, several months ago, he
has been unable to earn anything, and
spends much of his time with friends in
the country. Learning of the misfortune
that had befallen the boy, however, he
hurried to the city, and yesterday he
haunted the Receiving Hospital, inquiring
of each one who emerged from the ward
as to his son's condition, but restraining
his great longing to go In and see him,
fearing that the excitement would over
come the patient.
Besides his mother and the matron,
Willie has a trained nurse to attend him
the latter provided by the Police Depart
ment as part atonement for Kenville's
brutality.
Kenvllle. while nis victim is still hover
ing between life and death, is again at
liberty, ostensbly released on $5000 bonds
with Garrat McEnerney and Thomas E
Flynn as sureties.
It would perhaps have been better for
Kenville had he remained in custody
certainly it would have been far more to
the credit of the Police Department, for
Kenville's release has thrown new light
on the methods of Chief Lees. Kenville's
bondâ lf such bond is really In existenceâ
secures his release on a cnarge of assault
to murder. As a matter of fact. Kenvllle
is not and never has een charged with
assault to murder or any other offense
The prison register does not bear Ken
ville's name; only the infamous "small
book" that is illegally kept at the City
Prison, wherein is entered the names of
persons the police wish to detain pending
an investigation, contains any reference
to the affair, and that book is not an of
ficial record. The police have no right
whatever to hold anybody without for
mally chandng him with an offense, and
nobody whose name is entered on the
"small book" is so charged. Kenvllle has
not been charged with any crime, and the
short time he was held illegally and could
have secured his release at any time by.
legal process without the necessity of
giving a bond. Nobody around the City
Hall has seen this alleged bond, and
there are few who believe any bond was
given.
The whole affair looks like a gigantic
"bluff" on the part of the senile old
Chief. Kenville is allowed his freedom
through a trick that to the uninitiated
appears to be entirely legal, while the po
lice are "Investigating" the case. Their
Investigation so far seems to have been
directed toward securing evidence for the
defense, to the exclusion of all effort on
behalf of the prosecution.
Of course Kenville must be acquitted
at all hazards, for has not Police Commis
sioner Gunst just returned? Gunst has
small love for Lees, and with his health
fully restored he may be counted on to
renew hostilities on the doting Chief.
Consequently it would never do to have
one of Lees' subordinates convicted of so
heinous an offense as the murder of a 10
year-old boy just at this time.
Meanwhile the cupboard at 166 Clara
street is being dusted of its last crumbs,
three little mouths twitch nervously with
hunger, while out in the Receiving Hospi
tal a grief-racked mother sits beside a
cot gently stroking the tiny hand of her
best loved. __^__^______

Arthur Archibald, a hackman, who has

shaving himself In his room, 126 Turk

the razor across his throat. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Weil stitched and dressed the wound,
which is not serious. Archibald, when
asked why he cut his throat, said that
(or some time men had been trying to
steal his rig and it had so discouraged
him that he was tired of life.
As it was evident that his mind was un
balanced he was removed to a room in the

Oakland Office 3an Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 25.
The excitement of politics has unbal
anced the mind of George C. Hunt, inde
pendent candidate for the office of Sheriff
of Alameda County. He is now at his
home apparently a physical and mental
wreck. Every effort was made by his
friends to keep the matter secret, but
this proved futile and It is now generally
known In political circles.
Mr. Hunt was an indefatigable worker
and at the same time of a very nervous
temperament. He was up early and late
in the interest of his candidacy for some
time past, and his friends now fear that
the great strain of the past few weeks
has worked havoc with his nervous sys
tem.
It is stated that he recently fell heir to
a snug little fortune of something like
$18,000; that he invested this in some min
ing enterprise that did not turn out a
financial success; and that he probably
also brooded over his losses in this dlrec-
The first intimation of Mr. Hunt's mind
being affected came yesterday morning.
He acted very queerly and gave out
strange orders to his personal friend,
a Mr. Patton. He next approached
Joseph Kelley, Republican nominee for
the Assembly from the Forty-eighth Dis
trict, whom he had never before met, and
began hurling invectives upon prominent
people locally, who are really his friends,
and finally to emphasize his remarks he
brought his right hand down upon Mr.
Kelley's shoulder so forcibly that the
nominee was thrown off his feet in front
of Fred Campbell's cigar store.
Subsequently he repeated the ordeal
upon Frank Leavitt, Republican nominee
from the Twenty-sixth Senatorial Dis
trict, whom he met at the Union National
Bank, corner of Ninth and Broadway.
The manner in which he attacked Leavitt
aroused suspicion that his mind was giv
ing way. Hunt subsequently went to
his home at Fourteenth and Market
streets and there his condition was soon
realized by his wife, who managed to
appease him temporarily, while she sum
moned the family physician. Dr. Susan
Fenton, who is now treating him in the
hope that he might after a season of rest
be righted mentally.
The unfortunate man is laboring under
the hallucination that he is running for
Governor of this State and that his elec
tion is a foregone conclusion.
It was stated that he had, upon his ar
rival home, started in to smash all fur
niture within his reach, but this is de
nied by the wife and the attending physi
cian.
Mr. Hunt's friends were under the im-
Sression at first that he was affected by
rink, but he is not a drinking man. He
is middle-aged and has two sons and a
daughter. He was a deputy under Col
onel Robert McKillican's administration
of the Sheriff's office, and is generally
quite popular.
"Mr. Hunt is suffering from a complete
nervous prostration," said Dr. Fenton
to-night, "and while his condition seemed
one of critical danger for a while, I al
most feel confident that he will come
through it all right and we hope not to
necessitate his removal to any institution.
"His is clearly a case of the giving
way of an overtaxed brain. Mr. Hunt
has for a long time been an early riser
and has not retired until 12 midnight
and sometimes 2 a. m. I suppose the
excitement of politics is partly respon
sible. While there is no doubt about
his being unbalanaced mentally at pres
ent, I think he will come out all right."
