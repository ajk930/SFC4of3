THE PRESIDENT
ISSUES A CALL
FOR VOLUNTEERS
One Hundred and Twenty-Five
Thousand Men Wanted to Up
hold Old Glory.
WASHINGTON, April 23.â The President to-day issued the following
proclamation calling for 125,000 troops to serve for two years:
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESâ A PROCLAMATION.
WHEREAS, By an Act of Congress entitled "An act to provide for the
increasing of the military establishment of the United States in time of war,
and for other purposes," approved April 22, 1898, the President was author
ized in order to raise a volunteer army to issue his proclamation calling for
volunteers to serve in the army of the United States.
How, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States, by
virtue of power vested in me by the Constitution and by-laws, and deem
ing sufficient occasion to exist, have thought fit to call for, and hereby do
call for, volunteers to the aggregate number of 125,000 in order to carry
into effect the purpose of the said resolution, the same to be apportioned as
far as practicable among the several States and Territories and the District
of Columbia according to population, and to serve for two years unless
sooner discharged. The details for this object will bo immediately commu
nicated to the proper authorities through the War Department.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the
seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at Washington, this twenty-third day of April, 1898, and of the in
dependence of the United States the ons hundred and twenty-second.
WILLIAM McKINLEY.
By the President: JOHN SHERMAN, Secretary of State.
according to the census of 1890. The
largest iillotment will be to New
York State, which will be required to
furnish 11,000 men. The Governors
are given power to designate the
regiments of the present National
Guards to be called out and the loca
tion in which other organizations are
to be recruited. Each Governor will
also have entire charge of enlisting
and recruiting his quota.
As soon as recruits are mustered
into the national service they will be
sent to a rendezvous which has been
selected in each State and will be or
ganized and their company and regi
mental officers appointed by the Gov
ernor, and will then be turned over
to the Secretary of War. He will, un
der the supervision of the President,
combine them into brigades and di
visions and select their general and
staff officers. In many States volun
teer troops will be at their rendez
vous and ready to be assigned to
their ultimate destination within a
week from fie time they are called
i out. In other States, where dis
tances are greater and methods of
traveling slower, it may be a month
before the Governors report their al-
J lotments ready for the front.
The volunteer and regular troops
will be assembled together in the
South when the regular army shall
have been recruited up to its full
lawful strength and the militia shall
have been completely organized and
equipped. Four army corps will then
be formed, and these corps will be
divided into divisions and brigades
formed of regular and volunteer regi
ments.
It is understood that there will be
one regular and two volunteer regi
ments to a brigade. The maximum

ON THE FLAGSHIP NEW YORK, OEF HAVANA, April
23, 2 p. m. â The castle guns opened on the fighting squadron at 1 1
o'clock last night. About ten shots were fired in the direction of the
ships. None took effect, and none were returned.
This is the first act of war on the part of Spain.
LONDON, April 23.â 1t is reported here on reliable authority that a
; portion of the Spanish fleet which has been anchored at St. Vincent,
Cape Verde Islands, has sailed. Us destination is not known. It is re
garded as possible that it may have started to intercept the battleship
Oregon and the gunboat Marietta, which are now on their way to Key
West from the Pacific Ocean.
Some persons at Cape Vincent believe that an attack on American
seaports is contemplated.
NEW YORK, April 23.â The Herald's Washington correspondent tel
egraphs: No confirmation, can be obtained in Washington of the report
that the Spanish ships have left St. Vincent. That it is true is consid
ered highly probable, in view of the fact that official information which
has reached the authorities during the last few days is to the effect that
the fires in the furnaces of the ships have been banked and that they have
been ready to proceed to sea the moment orders were received from
Madrid.
In the absence of official information the authorities will not say
what action they will take, but it was suggested that the departure of
the cruisers Minneapolis and Columbia from Hampton Roads might be
for the purpose of obtaining accurate information concerning the where
abouts of the Spanish vessels. As to why these two cruisers were
sent to sea to-night, or as to their destination, the officials will say
nothing.

REVENUE CUTTER
CHASING A SPANISH

NEW YORK, April 23.â A Washington dispatch to the
Herald says: Administration officials are hopeful to-night
that another prize has been taken by the naval forces
of the United S;ates.
Secretary Gage received to-night a telegram from
the Collector of Customs in Mobile, Ala., stating that
the revenue cutter Winona was, at the time the dis
patch was sent, in charge of the Spanish steamer
Sacumina.
The Sacumina entered Mobile this afternoon, but
learning of the condition of affairs between the United
States and Spain suddenly put to sea, with the Winona
steaming after her. The Winona is not a very fast
vessel, and while authorities have not, up to a late
hour to-night, learned that she has succeeded in captur
ing the Spanish steamer, they believe she will finally
bring her to.

MADRID, April 23.â Last week some very sharp and quick work
was done between the Spanish foreign officers and* the American
Minister. The American ultimatum, sent to General Woodford as an
open telegram and not in cipher, reached Madrid on Wednesday night
at 11 o'clock. It was held at the foreign office until nearly 3 o'clock
Thursday morning. In the meantime the Spanish Government pre
pared the note breaking off diplomatic relations and refusing to re
ceive further communications from the American Government. This
Spanish note was handed to General Woodford on Thursday morning
at 7 o'clock. He spent most of the preceding night at the British
Embassy, arranging for the transfer of American interests. As soon
as he received the Spanish note he observed that Spain had made
the serious mistake of a declaration that war, evident or open, al
ready existed between the two nations because of the passage of the
Joint resolution of Congress and its approval by the President. Spain
had thus declared hostilities. General . Woodford promptly accepted
the Spanish decision. He did not present the ultimatum, but instead
addressed to the Spanish Government a note accepting the situation
and rinsed his legation and turned its care over to the British Em
bassy. He immediately telegraphed his Government at Washington
that war existed by declaration of Spain, and thus the American
squadron was enabled to sail from Key West Friday to blockade
Havana many hours before it could have been effected had Spain re
ceived the ultimatum, and secured the delay fixed in its time limit.
Then the New York let go a
shot across the bo.v of the fleeing
merchantman, which came to a
standstill. The chase coverec
ten miles.
A prize crew of twelve mer
from the New York, officered by
Lieutenant E. E. Capehart, En
sign Brumby and Engineer Wal
ter Ball, was put aboard the
captured Pedro and she then came
to Key West under her owr
steam and without escort. The
quarantine flag is now flying frorr
both the Pedro and the Span is t;
steamer Buena Ventura, which
was brought in yesterday by
the gunboat Nashville. The
Buena Ventura this morning is
badly listed. Three Governmeni
tugs are working to pull her intc
deep water. United States ma
rines are now pacing the decks
of both captured steamers, but
the Spanish flag still floats from
the jackstaff of the Pedro. She
came in at half-past 6 o'clock
this morning, and was watched
by large crowds from Key West
docks as she went to her anchor
age.
Captain Bonet is in no mood tc
talk to-day. Her seems to take
matters philosophically. "These
Yankees are getting rather hot it
seems to me," was his caustic
comment as he leaned over the
rail and spoke to the Herald-Call
man who ran alongside in a steamer.
The third prize belongs to the
Ericsson. It was captured at
dawn to-day close to the harbor.
It was a small fishing schooner.
Lieutenant Usher, in command of
the Ericsson, caught sight of the
little vessel trying, to beat out of
the harbor to the open sea. The
Ericsson soon headed her off, and
not being provided with any spare
men to act as a prize crew Lieuten
ant Usher simply ordered the
schooner to run on ahead of him.
In this way he chased her along
until he could turn her over to the
tender mercies of the cruiser Cin
cinnati. The Ericsson's officers
then resumed their duties without
waiting to learn what disposition
was made of their prize.
A prize crew had just been put
aboard the Pedro from the flagship
when the torpedo-boat Foote which
was scoutin-g ran up and reported
that a large steamship had been
sighted seven miles away, appar
ently bound out of Havana, and
showing no colors. The New York
soon overhauled the stranger and
boarded her. She was found to be
the German steamship Amrum
bound from Havana. Her papers
were all right and she was per
mitted to go after being informed
that Havana was under blockade.
The German is a ship of 500
tons, Captain Schmrull. She had
been in Havana harbor with cattle
from Tampico. Hearing of the ar
rival of the United States fleet off
Havana, Captain Schmrull, nor anx
ious to be bottled up in the harbor,
ran out and was overhauled by our
fleet. The Amrum put into Key
West early this morning and is now
waiting orders by cable.
The Pedro is owned by the Nav
igation Company of Bilbao, is of
1628 tons net register, is about
330 feet long, has over 38 feet
beam and draws 28 feet of water.
She was built at Newcastle in
18S3 an< 3 has on board a crew of
thirty-six men.
Speaking of the two prizes now
lying at this port, Lieutenant Com
mander Lyon of the Dolphin, who
is now the senior officer here, ex
plained why the Spanish flag still
flies from the Pedro while the Buena
Ventura shows no colors. The
captain of the Pedro flew his col
ors during the entire time of the
pursuit by the New York and re
fused to haul them down.
Technically these prizes do not
become the property of our Gov
ernment until a prize commission
has passed upon the captures and
adjudicated the claim. In the
meantime it is customary to permit
the flag of .the country from which
the capture is made to fly as usual.
The officers and crew are at liberty
to leave the Spanish ships and
come ashore provided they are not
stopped by quarantine regulations.
They have already expressed a
preference, however, to remain
aboard their captured vessels.
Captain Bonet and his men of tne
Pedro evidently think the Cubans
of Key West are a very blood
thirsty lot of patriots and do not
care to trust themselves to their
tender mercies ashore.
Lieutenant Commander Lyon
is in consultation with the United
States District Attorney relative
to the appointment of a prize
commission.

not have an opportunity to see it until
it is presented to the full committee

are inclined to think that they have
been most unfairly treated. As it is
distinctly a war measure, in which they
are expected to acquiesce without op
position, they believe they should have
been consulted in its preparation. The
Democrats have already decided to of
fer an income tax amendment.

measure, as framed, will raise between

CHICAGO, April 23.â Father Maurice J. Dorney, pastor of St. Gab

from the United States Government as chaplain, and will leave Mon
day to join the fighting men with Captain Robley D. Evans on the
battleship 10-.va in front of Havana. Father Dorney is widely known
throughout this country and Ireland. He is a particular friend of
Michael Davitt, the well-known Irish member of Parliament. Father
â  Dorney was the temporary chairman of the Philadelphia convention at
â  which the Irish National League of America was organized, and it was
' he who carried over to London and delivered to Mr. Labouchere and
Sir Charles Russell, now Lord Chief Justice of England, the original
letters written by Piggott. who proved the latter to have forged the
letters which he introduced in testimony at the Parnell trial. The let
ters carried by Father Dorney completely overthrew the London Times'
case against Parnell, and the day after their introduction Piggott ran
away to Spain, where a day or two later he committed suicide. The
letter thus delivered so timely had been for years in the possession of
Hon. Patrick Egan, who was the treasurer of the Land League in
Ireland, and who subsequently became a citizen TTf the United States
and served as our Minister to Chile under the administration of Presi- â 
dent Harrison. Mr. Egan discovered that the letters which he had â 
would completely overthrow the London Times' case and vindicate â 
Parnell. He hurried to Chicago and requested Alexander Sullivan, â 
formerly president of the Irish National League, to select some one â 
to bear the precious document in safety to London. Mr. Sullivan's â 
selection was Father Dorney. The result sh6\ved how well he esti- â 
mated the fidelity of the loyal priest who is now about to enter his -
country's service. Captain Evans was in command at Valparaiso dur- -
ing the exciting times when Minister Egan showed his mettle, and it â 
â  is thought one of the results of the friendship then formed is Father â 
Dorney's assignment at this time to Captain Evans* battleship, the -

FRENCHMEN
ON THE WAR
Statesmen and "Warriors
Think Hostilities Will
Be Prolonged.
Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gordon Eennett.
PARIS, April 23.â 0n the eve of hos
tilities between Spain and the United
! States I thought it desirable to obtain
! of persons especially qualified to speak
i opinions on certain probabilities likely
I to arise in naval warfare about to be
| gin or the part therein likely to be
â  taken by neutral powers and the con
; sequences Immediately arising as to
â  commercial relations between the Unit-
I ed States and certain great European
| ports. I have seen M. Lock'roy, for
| merly French Minister of Marine. He
! says: "The conflict is calculated to
! cause us all much consideration and
j even anxiety, I don't agree with those
j "who believe or affect to believe and who
I state in the newspapers that the game
j may be played out in a few weeks when
j once hostilities have begun.
"The United States has many eie
i ments of success, but one must not lose
i sight of the defensive resources of
; Spain, of her few vulnerable points, of
her legendary tenacity, her better or
i ganized, better equipped and bett-er
| trained army and navy; also her spe
| cial qualifications for guerrilla warfare,
j in which she has always been success
ful on land and which she will naturai
ly try to carry on at sea, and which
may be indefinitely prolonged."
"Do you then consider that privateer
ing can be carried on without interven
tion of neutral powers, or that they
would submit to the inconveniences in
volved in the right of search?"
"I believe that the auestion is ex
tremely complicated, and I consider
that some understanding should be
come to, but I don't see how Spain can
be prevented from using her best, If
not only means of defense without act
ing toward her with partiality equiva
lent almost to forcible intervention, and
to her detriment."
After seeing M. Lockroy, I consulted
several high officials In the French
navy. The prevailing opinion is that
American ships are better armed and
faster than Spanish ships, and in a
stand-up fight should have the' better
I of it, but they appear to hold a high
I opinion of the bravery and qualifica
tions of some of the Spanish sailors.
One admiral, a member of the high
council of the Marine Francaise, told
me that he witnessed the trials of the
Cristobal Colon at Genoa, and, like all
other officers present, was struck by
the combined skill and boldness with
which the Spanish captain sent to take
the vessel from Italy handled her.
"We saw him," he said, "enter the
harbor at a speed of eighteen knots,
and bring her to anchor without the
slightest hesitation and without a mis
take. There's a man who will be heard
of hereafter."
The captain In question is now the
rear-admiral. The crucial point, ac
cording to French sailors, is that of
the coal supply and munitions, and un
less Spain has taken such precautions
that loss by blockade of one or more
of her transports would have no ef
fect, the struggle may shortly become
hopeless and also a great distance from
the base of operations.
As to the political consequences of
war, I consulted an eminent foreign
diplomat, who said: "I consider that
the campaign which the United States
have just entered on is a particularly
serious event in their history. They risk
the loss of part of the advantage de
rived during half a century from the
curse of the military systems which
devour old Europe. They propound to
the old continent problems which jus
tify the remark attributed to the Ger
man Emperor: 'After the yellow
specter are we about to be confronted
by the Yankee specter?'
"In any case, this campaign, with the
facts and negotiations that preceded
it, furnish indications of a state of
feeling and tendencies calculated to
cause uneasiness on this Bide of the
ocean."

Almost Certain to Be Of-

State.
Special Dispatch to The Ca'.l.
NEW YORK, April 23.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: When
President McKinley left the White
House this afternoon to take a drive
with Vice President Hobart he showed
no traces of the mental ordea! through
which he is passing. His complexion
was clear, his eye fresh and bright, and
he greeted with a complacent smile
those who stood near the entrance and
saluted with uncovered head. His
step is firm, his voice strong and steady
and he says he is enjoying perfect
health. The physical pressure upon
him has been ...tense recently, but his
regular habits and his quiet repose
when he retires for the night account
for his excellent condition.
There has been much speculation of
an unofficial nature in and about the
White House, departments, hotels and
capitol relative to Cabinet changes.
Who Secretary Sherman's successor
will be is a matter of considerable spec
ulation, but Assistant Secretary Day, I
am positively assured, will be offered
the important office, although it is not
definitely settled that he will accept .t.
There is talk of transferring Charles
Emory Smith from the Postoffice De
partment to the Department of State.
It is also suggested that Attorney-Gen
eral Griggs should be given a state
portfolio. The names of Senator Da
vis of Minneapolis, former Senator
George F. Edmunds of Vermont, and
John W. Foster of Ohio are also men
tioned in connection with the place.
Those close to the President posi
tively decline to discuss the subject, as
they have no desire to wound the feel
ings of Secretary Sherman or antici
pate such action as may be necessary
in the near future. Mr. Sherman's
friends assert that the Secretary has
for some time seriously considered the
matter of retiring from active public
life, but, like many other men who
have figured long and successfully on
the national stage, he cannot make up
his mind when to say farewell to the
scenes of his brightest efforts.
TO BRIGADES
OF TROOPERS
Organization of Regiments
at Chickamauga Is
Completed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., April 23.â
The organization into brigades of all
the cavalry regiments of the United
States army centered at Chickamauga
Park is now complete. The following
general order was issued to-day by
Major General Brooke:
Camp George H. Thomas,
Chiokamaugra Park, Ga., April 23, 1898.
General field orders No. 4.
The cavalry of this command is org.ir
ized as follows:
Cavalry divisionâ Colonel A. K. Arnold,
First Cavalry, commanding.
First lirigadeâ First Cavalry, Second
Cavalry. Tenth Cavalry.
Second Brigadeâ Third Cavalry, Sixth
Cavalry. Ninth Cavalry.
The light artillery and infantry will be
brigaded in a later order. By com
mand of GENERAL. BROOKE.
Three thousand regular troops are
now encamped at Chickamauga, the
number to-day having been almost
doubled. The soldiers arrived so fast
that it was difficult to handle them
promptly, hardly an hour of the day
passing without two or more long train
loads coming in. The work of unload
ing the trains at the park was rendered
doubly difficult by rain, which fell at
intervals all day. On this account all
drills were suspended until Monday.
After that time, however, army life
will begin in earnest. It is expected
that by that time nearly all the regu
lar troops to be located at Chicka
mauga will have arrived. The Seventh
Infantry from Fort Logan, Colo., which
was reported as having arrived, will
not be in until to-morrow morning.
Miners Have Perished.
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., April 23.â A
fire at 11:30 o'clock to-night burned the
shafthouse of the Londonderry mine on
Ironclad Hill. J. "W. Foster, W. H. Pine
and a man named Jones are in the shaft
and are supposed to have perished.

to Their Stations.

Copyright, 1898, by Georgo Grantham Bain.
HAVANA, April 23.â Three cannon
shots re-echoed through the city at
6:30 last evening. It was the alarm
signal previously agreed upon to notify
people of the approach of the Ameri
can squadron. Red flags were hoisted
at Morro Castle and at the fortress of
Cabana. Trumpets were heard sum
moning the troops. Volunteers, ma
rines and regulars seized their arms
and hastened to occupy their respective
stations.
Instead of showing signs of alarm,
the people seemed wild with enthusi
asm. Civilians who had not been called
on to join the defending forces armed
themselves and hastened to join the
troops. Shopkeepers spontaneously
closed their doors, while their clerks
and waiters from the cafes ran to help
defend the city and the honor of the
nation.
The American squadron was dis
cerned almost within range of the har
bor batteries. Seven ships of war were
all that could be seen from shore. Or
ders were given to extinguish the lights
of Morro Castle. Captain-General
Blanco inspected the batteries and is
sued instructions for the night, and
then returned to the palace to dine.
His dinner was interrupted by calls
from generals of the army, leaders in
the colonial cabinet, irrespective of
party, and others of the leading citi
zens of Havana.
Throughout the city order generally
prevailed. A new battalion of volun
teers was quickly formed, being made
up entirely of natives of Barcelona.
Patriotic demonstrations of various
kinds were seen on all sides. A throng
of men, women and children, number
ing perhaps 80,000 assembled on the
wharves, shouting defiance to the Am
ericans.
"Their cannon may shoot," was the
cry, "but here Spaniards stand an im
passable wall."
Marquis Arguelles called, at the Pal
ace to-day and offered $2,000,000 to the
Captain General to use as he saw fit.
Many society women called at the Pal
ace and tendered their services to nurse
the sick and wounded. All of them
wore on their arms badges of national
colors. General Blanco, who was filled
with emotion at their patriotic offers,
thanked them, and said he was dis
posed to accept their services. An or
der has been issued forbidding the
sailing of vessels along the coast and
to neighboring islands.

SAN RAFAEL, April 23.â San Rafael
was thrown into excitement to-night
by a multitude of lights flashing along
the streets and the shrill whoops and
yells, of a large crowd of boys. The
youngsters carried an imitation of a
battleship, draped in the Spanish col
ors. This was hooted and yelled at
until the Spanish navy was burned in
effigy on Fourth and B streets.

I Am Sound
As a dollar, but only a little while ago
I was an intense sufferer. After ty-
phoid I had an abscess on my side,
which did not break for six months,
and then it became a running sore
so that it caused me intense suffering
all the time. I was told I could only
be cured by an operation, as four
pieces of bone had come from the
sore. - Before submitting to the sur-

NUMBER OF
REGULARS
Passage by the House of
the Bill to Reorganize
the Army.
Maximum Strength of the Four
Arms to Be 61,010, and Extra
Officers to Be Retired
After the War.
Call Office. Rlggs House,
"Washington, April 23.
The House to-day passed the army
reorganization bll lat the urgent request
of the President and Secretary of War,
but the Senate did not remain In session
as was expected, and the bill will not
go to the President until next week.
Some fear was expressed on the Demo
cratic side that the bill might Increase
the regular army In time of peace, but
an amendment prepared by Bailey
which removed all doubt on this score
â was accepted by Hull, and the bill
passed by a unanimous vote.
The bill reorganizes the army Into the
three hattalion formation, and author
izes the twenty-live regiments of the
infantry arm of the service to be re
cruited up to a total of 31,800 enlisted
ir.<-n. It authorizes the recruitment of
the ten regiments of the cavalry arm
of the service to a total of 12.000enllsted
men, the sf-ven regiments of the artil
lery arm of the service to 16,457 men.
and the engineer hattalion of five com
panies up to 752 enlisted men, includ
ing two ii'.n-coinmissioned officers,
h makes a total for these four
arm* of the service, when at maximum
'â '10.
Th <>f officers provided for
in the bill :>:: >: First, twenty-five ma
jors, as provided in the first section of
:. These majors are to be a per
manent addition to the command offi-
Ci-rs of the regular army.
Second, 150 commissioned officers to
:e f.,r the two infantry com
panies in the third battalion for each
of the twenty-five regiments of in
fantry.
Third, eighty-four second lieutenants, j
being one for each of the eighty-four j
batteries of artillery when recruited to '
a war strength. The second lieutenants ;
are only to be added in the discretion !
of the President, but assuming that the ;
extra lieutenant is necessary and will â 
â mmissloned for each battery of j
artillery, it is a t<ual of commissioned
â  the present number j
authorized by law of 269. Of this num
ber, as abi ted, twenty-five are I
majors for the permanent second bat
talion, and the other 236 officers, it is
provided in the last section of the bill, :
shall, on ill' conclusion of hostilities,!
â  her absorbed by filling any vacan
existing in the other companies of j
the service op by an honorable dis- j
qjiarge, which may be deemed neces- j
sary to reduce the commissioned offi
cers of the army to the number now
provided for by the first section of this
act.
The House met at in o'clock, and Hull
immediately called up the army bill. The
bill has been materially modified since it I
recommitted by thi* House a fort- j
night ago. The following important pro
viso was offered by the committee as an
amendment: "Provided, that in the
event of a call by the President for either
volunteers or the militia of the country
the President Is authorized to accept the
of the troops or the various
and Territories, including the
District of Columbia, as organized under
the laws of the States and Territories,
including the District of Columbia."
It was decided to limit the general de
bate to half an hour. Hull briefly ex
; i some of the features of the bill,
lie said the infantry force of the army
us at present organized was not efficient
In time of war with only fifty privates. ,
It placed but twenty-five men to each
ny In the fighting line and made i
army, which cost on a peace i
footing J23.000.U00 per annum, merely or-;
namental. The number of privates In I
each company had been placed in the bill j
Ehty-four to conform -with the or
ganization of the National Guard in the!
rity of the States.
Hull said that it was the rurpose of the j
general army to effect a landing in Cuba'
nt the earliest possible moment. It would |
take six weeks or two months to erjuip
the volunteer army. The United States 1
was doing what no other country on !
earth would dare doâ lt was going into j
war without provision for a land force,
ress made no provision for war until
war was at hand. The volunteer army
would be organized whtK- war existed.
Our experts on coast defenses said It
would be absolutely impossible to place
volunteer forces upon the coast defenses
within three months, owing to the com*
plicated character of the new machinery
on the sl( ge guns. This made the in
crease in the regular army artillery
force Imperative.
Hull was besieged by questions as to
the manner In which the reduction of the
army would take plrv-e when hostilities
:. and he explained that the officers

of the skeleton regiments would bÂ« ab
sorbed by promotion.
Underwood (D.) of Alabama vigorously
opposed the measure, which, he declared,
could not possibly pass save under the
stress of war pressure.
Hay (D.) <>f Virginia, who warmly ad
vocated the bill, denied that the purpose
oi the bill was to give West Point offi
cers commands which they would other
wise not obtain.
Cox (LÂ».t of Tennessee, a member of the
committee, supported the bill, which he
said would make the army efficient in
time of war.
Marshall (Ft.) of Illinois, also a member
of the committee, said that In justice to
the War Department and to the regular
army, he would state that the former bill.
which provided for Infantry companies
of 260 men. met the approval of neither.
The bill did not provide vie mode and
method of mustering out the supernu
merary officers when hostilities ceased.
Additional legislation would be required
to accomplish this or possibly the bill
could be construed as conferring this au
thority on the President.
Hull Bald there could be no doubt about
the construction of the law. The super
numeraries would be mustered out when
the war ceased.
Bailey suiu he thought it was not a
very high compliment to the army to be
told that the inefficiency of the army on
the eve of war was admitted. After thirty
years of peace it seemed to him that the
plans of the army to meet an emergency
should have been perfected. It was
strange that an obsolete formation should
have been retained all these years. What
he v.-;is particularly insistent about was
that the supernumerary ofiicers and men
should be mustered out when the war
closed.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri pressed the
same point. Hull finaly agreed to offer
an amendment which would make the
language acceptable to Bailey.
Lacey (R.) of lowa offered an amend
ment providing that "during time of ac
tual war promotions for gallantry In the
field may be made for any vacancies in
any grade in the army without examina
tion and without regard to seniority."
Lacey made a speech in support of his
amendment, which aroused enthusiastic
applause. The provision of the bill, he
said, would make promotions depend
upon seniority and technical skill. Such
officers as Ouster and Sheridan, if the
war should develop such, would be handi
capped. Fighting ability should be re
warded, not ability to pass examinations
Lacey's statement that General Forrest
one of the most clashing Confederate of
ficers, could hardly read and write
brought a storm of protests from the
Confederate veterans.
Handy (D.) of Delaware supported the
amendment. Handy offered an amend
ment to the amendment, providing that
the President should be authorized to pro
mote enlisted men to the rank of second
lieutenants for gallantry in action
Savers (D.) of Texas vigorously op
posed both amendments. He declared
that, if adopted, they would open the
way for favoritism and the exercise of
political influence.
Both amendments were voted down
without division. Then, at 11:55 a m
without completing the consideration of
the bill, the House took a recess to attend
the funeral of Senator Walthall.
The House reconvened after Senator
Ualthalls funeral at 12:50 p. m., and re
sumed the consideration of the army re
organization bill.
Settle (I).) of Kentucky offered an
amendment, providing that the provision
authorizing the President to accept quotas
of troops of the States as organized by
the laws of such States shall not "take
away from the Governors of the respect
ive States their rights to determine how
the quota of the States may be furnished
whether from the organized militia or vol

The amendment was defeated An
amendment offered by Bailey was adopt

REPORTED CAPTURE OF THE
AMERICAN LINER CITY OF
PARIS BY SPANIARDS
Sensational Story of the Seizure Cannot Be Con=
firmed===The Minneapolis and Columbus Are
Sent to Convoy the Steamship.
LONDON, April 23.â The afternoon papers In this city have received dispatches from Belfast saying that trust
worthy news has been received there to the effect that the American liner Paris has been captured off the Irish
coast by a Spanish cruiser. It Is believed, however, that the reports of the capture of the Paris are simply repe
titions of yesterday evening's reports, which have since been found to be untrue.
FALMOUTH, Eng., April 23.â The American line steamer Paris, chartered by the United States Government,
which the Spaniards are trying to capture, passed the Lizard yesterday evening, and should now be well on her
way west.
NEW YORK, April 23.â When asked about the possibility of the capture of the American liner Paris, which
has just sailed for New York, Clement A. Griscomb Jr., manager of the office of the American line, laughed at the
idea. "There is not a vessel in the Spanish navy which can steam within two knots of the Paris' speed," he said.
"If the day is clear a vessel can be sighted twenty miles away. If there is any doubt of the vessel's nationality
it is hardly likely that the Paris will try to make it out. Of course a careful lookout will be kept for Spanish vessels,
but we do not expect any will be sighted which will give her any trouble." The American line steamer Paris has
not returned to Southampton. The only information obtainable is that she passed the Lizard yesterday evening.
OLD POINT COMFORT, Va., April 23.â The Columbia and Minneapolis have put to sea. It was at first sup
posed they were to convey to Key West the Panther, which arrived this evening with 800 marines from the New-
York navy-yard. The Panther, however, did not leave with the big cruisers, which sailed at 11 o'clock, and it is
now believed they have gone to convey the Paris to New York. Commodore Schley received a cipher dispatch to
night, and immediately sent orders to the cruisers Minneapolis and Columbia.

San Francisco on January 5 for Liverpool. She is a four-masted vessel
of 3256 tons register and owned by Arthur Sewall & Co. of Bath, Me.
BATH, Me., April 23.â The members of the firm of Arthur Sewall

Spanish on a voyage from San Francisco to Liverpool, refuse to credit
the story that she has been taken, and expect soon to receive news of
her safe arrival at Liverpool, where she is now due. The Shenandoah
is loaded with wheat and a general cargo.
NEW YORK, April 23.â G. V. Dearborn, agent for the American
ship Shenandoah, said that he had heard from trustworthy sources
that it was not his ship, but the British ship Shenandoah from Newport
News, April 13, for Liverpool, that had been boarded and examined by
the Spaniards. The American ship, he said, should be due in Liver

MONTEREY, April 23.â T0-day for
the first time since California became
a State the stars and stripes floated
over old Fort Halleck, and the flag was
saluted by a cannon that is a relic of
the Mexican War. The ceremony of
flag raising was under the auspices of
the Monterey Naval Reserve and was
attended by circumstances wholly un

handsome national colors. Stopping in
front of The Call headquarters, three
times three cheers were given for Old
Glory. Thirteen sticks of dynamite
were touched off as a salute. Business

but an inkling- of its intent may be
gathered from the effect. Colonel Su

progress of the work. On Monday morn

BUENOS AYRES, April 23.â
The Spanish torpedo-boat Teme
rario started for Montevideo at
10 o'clock this morning. Three
thousand Spaniards witnessed
the start and cheered the vessel
and her crew.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 23.
A startling explanation was offered
to-day by a naval officer of what may
be the "Spanish surprise" as to where
the first naval battle will take place.
"All guesses appear to have been over
looked," said he, "except the most like
ly one, and one, too, that any seafaring
man will readily recognize as most
probable.
"By looking at the map you will see
that the northeast extremity of South
America is the nearest point to the
Cape Verde Islands; in fact, only five
days' sailing distance therefrom. Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil, is nearly the same
distance from this extreme point as
is the Cape Verde Islands.
"The battleship Oregon, the gunboat
Marietta, the Brazilian cruiser Nicthe
roy, lately purchased by the United
States, will have to round this extreme
point of the South American continent
en route to join the Key West squadron.
"There is no doubt that the prom
ised surprise is this: The Spanish fleet
will arrive in the path of the Oregon
and her sister ships about the time the
latter are due off the point of land
named, destroy them, and then sail
northward to attack Sampson's fleet.
"The business of that Spanish tor
pedo boat at Montevideo is not to at-
tack the Oregon, but to keep posted as
to the time the Oregon passes north
ward, and in turn Inform thÂ«
Spanish at Cape Verde, so that they
can time their departure. The Oregon
will probably not stop until she reachea
Rio de Janeiro, where she will coal, and
from there, with the Marietta and Nic
theroy, proceed northward.
"As the whole Spanish fleet will un
doubtedly come to American waters.
they are evidently planning to effect
this coup en route, and as the Oregon
would be no match for the fleet, Amer
ica would lose the first naval engage
ment."
CUTTER PERRY
A PATRIOT SHIP
Will Be Fitted Out With
Six-Pound Guns and
Armor.
Designed for Service in Pro
tecting Shipping on This
Coast.
Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 23.â The United
States revenue cutter Perry, which is
now at anchor in Seattle Harbor, will
be immediately fitted out as a war ves
sel. She will be supplied with six 6
pounders and two additional 1-pound
ers. It will also be necessary to pro-
tect her boilers and machinery with as
heavy armor as she can carry. The
changes on the cutter will likely be
made at San Francisco.
The Perry has been transferred by
the Treasury Department to the Navy
Department. To-day Captain W. C.
Kilgore arrived here from Washington
to assume command of the Perry. As
soon as the work can be done the cut
ter will be put into shape to drive out
Spanish buccaneers who may visit the
Sound, and to do efficient service in
protecting American coast shipping
from any attacks by the Spanish.
Captain Phillips, who has been in
command of the Perry for some time,
has been ordered east to Savannah, Ga.
There he will take command of the
United States ship Boutwell, to per
form patrol duty along the Atlantic
coast. The Boutwell is an armored
fighting ship, and the service in which
Captain Phillips will be engaged is
similar to that in which Captain Kil
gore has embarked.
Captain Kilgore's coming was some
what unexpected by Captain Phillips,
and the latter was in ignorance of the
fact that the cutter had been trans
ferred to the Navy Department ten days
ago. Captain Kilgore has not yet re
ceived his orders from the Secretary
of the Navy, but it is known that the
Perry is to be assigned to duty on
Puget Sound and the northwest coast.

DUBLIN, April 9.â Parliament hav
ing ris'-n for the Easter recess and po!i- j
ticians being weary the business of so
cial life predominates here as elsewhere
this week. Moreover, we are to witness
in Dublin to-night a social event very,
rare Indei d .11 these days in the Irish
capital, ihe first production, namely, of
a new play by a well-known author and
a rising composer. Dublin, in the days \
of its prim< â that is, when it was the '
Feat of an Irish Parliament â was a fa- j
vorlte home for all votaries of tho !
Stage. Some of the most famous actors
and actresses of the so-called British j
flrst made their reputations here; j
Handel lived and worked here for some
years and up to a short time ago the
organ which he used was still in the
in Secies street which he inhabi
and it may bo added that a dra- j
matic or musical reputation made in
Dublin then was a passport to immedi
uccess in England. But since ISOO
ull the wealth and fashion of the coun- j
try have steadily gone in the wake of |
the Parliament to London, and the |
drain has proved fatal to intellectual
as well as material progress in Dublin
and in Ireland. Up to about twenty
five years ago indeed the old Theater
Royalâ a fine, spacious building con
structed for better times â used to at
tract in the season some first-rate ar- |
lists in opera, in the regular drama and j
in comedy, and the Gaiety Theater, the
Theater Royal having been burned
down, has since then discharged the
same function, while the Queen's Thea
terâa house of rather modest propor
haa catered more especially to
the liking for melodrama. But we have
no longer a native school of dramatic!
or operatic artists; those who come to
us May with us usually only for a week j
or two; and scarcely any one thinks of j
bringing out here a new work.
Things, however, appear to be now I
looking up. Last December the caw
Theater Royal opened its doors to the '
pub le, and It Is one of the finest houses
of its kind in the three kingdoms. It
Btands vn the very site of the old one
and was. until ii was recently trans- :
formed, known as the Leinster Hail,
which was itself built some fifteen
years ago and was the scene of many
a famous meeting, including the meet-
Ing at which so many leading politi-
Iged themselves in November, :
to stand by the leadership of Par-
Dell. The persons to whose enterprise
this new theater owes its existence are
not Irish. Mr. Manlllot is of French
extraction and Mr. Morell is an Eng
lishman, but they could not have set
about the work they have undertaken
more enthusiastically if they were Dub- ,
lin men born.
They have absolutely lavished money i
on the d< 1 oration of the place, and they
have now had tho courage to invite the 1
authors of a new pi^ â <>, who would nat- j
urally make trial first of a place like !
London, to bring It out in th.eir thea- j
ter and thus obtain for it an Irish bap
tism. The event has attracted a good
deal of interest, of course, in Dublin.,
where all the preparations for it have
taken place, including not merely the 1
: trsals, but the painting of the;
Bcenery and the making of the dresses!
and costumes. Apropos of the re- ;

NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERY.
A Positive Cure lor Dyspepsia.
This may read as though we were
putting it a little strong because it is
generally thought by the majority of
people that Dyspepsia in its chronic
form is Incurable, or practically so.
But we have long since shown that
Dyspepsia is curable, nor is it such a
difficult matter as it lirst appears.
The trouble with Dyspeptics is that
they are continually dieting, starving
themselves, or going to opposite ex-
tremes or else deluging the already
ovei burdened stomach with "bitters,"
"after dinner pills," etc.. which invaria-
bly increase the difficulty even if in
â ome cases they do give a slight tem-
porary relief. Such treatment of the
Btomach simply makes matters worse.
What the stomach wants is a rest.
Now how can the stomach become
rested, recuperated and at the same
time the body nourished and sustained?
This is the great secret and this is
also the Becret of the uniform success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. This
1b a comparatively new remedy, but its
success and popularity leave no doubt
as to its merits.
The tablets will digest the food any-
way, regardless of condition of stom-
ach.
The sufferer from dyspepsia, accord-
Ing to directions, is to eat an abund-
ance of good, wholesome food and use
the tablets before and after each meal
and the result will be that the food
will be digested no matter how bad
your dyspepsia may be, because as be-
fore stated, the tablets will digest the
food even If the stomach is wholly
inactive. To illustrate our meaning
plainly, if you take 1800 grains of meat,
eggs or ordinary food and place it in a
temperature of 9S degrees, and put with
it nne of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
it will digest the meat or eggs almost
ns perfectly as if the meat was en-
closed within the stomach.
The stomach may be ever so weak
yet these tablets will perform the work
of digestion and the body and brain
will be properly nourished and at the
same time a radical, lasting cure of
dyspepsia will be made, because the
much abused stomach will be given, to
Borne extent, a much needed rest. Your
druggist will tell you that of the many
remedies adverted to cure dyspepsia
none of them has given so complete
n:,>l general satisfaction as Stuart'a
Dyspepsia Tablets and not least in im-
portance in these hard times is the fact
that they are also the cheapest and
give the most good for the least
money.

PORTLAND, Or., April 23.â The passengers on the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation flier, just as it was approaching Ontario, Or., yester
day, were excited by the actions of an Arkansas family, the members
of which the unusual train life had evidently driven mad. The family
consisted of a mother and ftve children, and all seemed to share in a
sort of nervous terror, moar.ind and crying and sobbing on one an
other's shoulders.
When within twenty miles of Ontario, and -while the train was
moving at express speed, the 20-year-old son raised a window and
leaped headforemost to the ground. Luckily the momentum of the
train caused him to turn a complete somersault and he fell on his feet.
The instant he alighted he raced off like a wild man and disappeared

Before she could be restrained the 12-year-o-ld sister of the youth
rushed to the rear platform and jumped from the train.
The train was stopped and a vaquero mounted on a speedy horse
overtook and lassoed the boy, who was then handcuffed. 'When the
boy and his sister, who was also unhurt, were taken to the train, the
whole family raised such a terrible commotion that the passengers all
left the car, leaving the unfortunates to be guarded by the train men.
It was learned afterward that the name of the family was Janney.

successful burlesques and comedies
seen on the English stage for some
time, "The Circus Girl," for instance,
"The Ballet Girl," "In Town," and
other pieces, all of which were pro
duced first in London, and the first of
which has now been running in Lon
don for more than a year. The scene
is laid in the Austrian Tyrol, and the
time is the present day. Of course,
the choice of the Austrian Tyrol gives
an opportunity for making the cos
tumes at once picturesque and true to
the reality, and this opportunity has
not been neglected. The play, as it is
the fashion now, consists of two acts,
but the second act is divided into two
scenes, and the whole is said to go well.
It is fully expected that a big success
will be achieved, and if it were for
nothing else than to reward the enter
prise of the owners of the new theater,
it is to be hoped that that expectation
will be fully realized.
I understand that the holidays are
bringing an unusually large number of
visitors to Ireland for Easter. Even
many fashionable folk are this year
coming to Ireland from England in
stead of gcring to the Continent. This,
no doubt, is the result of the efforts
made in the course of the last couple
of years to popularize Ireland as a
tourist resort. Truth to tell, though
the natural attractions of se% - eral parts
fif the country are almost -if not quite
unsurpassed in Europe, there used not
to be much inducement offered to the
tourist in the shape of comfortable
means of travel and good hotel accom
modation.
But this can be said no longer with
truth. Some of the most picturesque
parts of the western highlands, which
were inaccessible except to hardy and
enthusiastic lovers of natural beauty,
are now traversed by railways by
means of which it is possible to reach
one's destination in almost aay direc
tion from Dublin in the course of a sin
gle day or in even less time. The
Shannon is now navigated by commo
dious steamers throughout the greater
part of its majestic course. First-class
modern hotels, supplied with all the
newest conveniences of civilization,
have sprung up in all directions, par
ticularly in the region of the Kerry
Lakes, and wherever those luxurious
halting places do not adjoin a railway
station car and coach services of an
efficient kind afford an easy means of
communication with the outer world.
Under these circumstances it is na
turally hoped that, whon the facts are
made known in America and England,
Ireland will at last begin to share in
the Pactolus stream of tourist traffic
which has hitherto set almost entirely
in the direction of France, Italy and
Switzerland; and certainly it will not
be amiss If it should so happen.
Apropos of touring in Ireland, it may
be interesting to mention that the
Giant's Causewayâ a spot which must
be known to most students of geog
raphy, whether they arc Irish or not â
is now railed off from the general puu
lic and that admission to it can be ob
tained only by the payment of an on
trance fee of sixpence a head â reduood
on Sundays to half that amount. T'lifi
is a new departure brought about by
the action of a syndicate which som*
time ago purchased the Causeway and
thereupon determined to close it to the
cublic except on the terms of an ad
mission fee being paid by every visitor.
In my last letter I think I said a good
deal about the late Sir John Arnott of
Cork. The latest news about him is
that he died even a more wealthy man
than was generally supposed. He left
behind him at least a million pounds
sterling In personalty, in addition to
real property of considerable amount.
His will shows that he entertained to
the end a genuine sympathy with those
who assisted him to realize this fine
fortune. One of his principal sources
of income was his newspaper, the Irish
Times. To the manager of that pa
per he left a very considerable legacy,
and he has done a similar good turn
by the chief men in the management
of his other business concerns. On the
whole, he "cut up well," as the some
what brutal phrase goes, and it is only
a pity that he did not live longer to
enjoy the fruits of his active and be
nevolent life.

HANNA ACCUSED
BY DEMOCRATS
Conflicting Reports of the
Bribery Investigating
Committee.
Hearsay Testimony Said to Have Been
Admitted by His Political
FO8!.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 23.â A ma
jority of the Senate committee to-day
reported that evidence showed a con
spiracy to elect M. A. Hanna United
States Senator by bribery, and that the
attempt by General Boyce to bribe
Representative Otis was known to
Rathbone, Dick, Hanna and other
workers in M. A. Hanna's interest at
Columbus.
Senator Garfield's minority report
says Otis and his attorney, T. C. Camp
bell, testify that Boyce disclaimed to
them connection with Hanna's Colum
bus workers, but that he (Boyce) was
sent, out by Nevr York parties, whose
identity he refused to disclose. Tne
testimony of Otis and Campbell, Mr.
Garfield says. Is all that was given in
accordance with the rules of evidence
in the courts of Ohio, which the com
mittee agreed to follow, but later the
majority of the committee admitted
hearsay testimony with a view of con
necting Mr. Hanna with the alleged
crime if possible.
Both the majority and minority re
ports review the testimony at great
length. The two reports were quickly
disposed of by the Senate. By a strict
party vote the minority report wafl re
jected and the majority report adopted.

THE EUROPEAN
PRESS ANGRY
Berlin Newspapers Now
Say Very Harsh Things
About America.
"Insolence" of Uncle Sam Will
Not Prevent Germans
Being Neutral.
Some of the London Journals Begin
to Grow Surly and Snarl at
This Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BEJtLIN, April 23.â With singular
unanimity the German press of every
class is condemning the United States
for the course taken toward Spain. All
the German papers impute to the
United States selfish and base motives
and praise the attitude of Spain, in con
trast with "the undignified course
which the United States is pursuing."
The most rabid of all the German pa
pers in this regard Is the Tageblatt,
which usually has been friendly to
ward American aspirations. The deep
interest taken by the German public
in the matter Is shown by the fact
that practically the entire space of the
newspapers is given up to news rela
tive to the Hispano-American struggle.
Everything emanating from Washing
ton is discussed in hostile temper or
sarcastically commented upon, while
pro-Spanish statements are indorsed
and applauded.
The semi-official newspapers, if not
favorable to the United States, are at
least more cautious. They steadily
point out why Germany (.ught to and
will maintain the strictest neutrality,
laying stress, among the reasons they
advance for such a position, upon the
fact that trillions of Germans, born in
the United States, heartiiy side with
their adopted country in the present
quarrel with Spain.
The organ of Prince Bismarck, the
Hamburger Nachrichten insists that
Germany must follow the policy which
will be the most useful to her own in
terests. "I* is wholly indifferent
to Germans," says the newspaper,
"whether Cuba remains a Spanish col
ony or becomes, an American independ
ent republic. But German-American in
terests must be watched and attention
must be paid to the feelings of Ger
man'- In the United States.
The Nachrichten, however, charac
terizes the action of the United States
as "an insolent piece of presumption
against the rest of the world, an un
justifiable outrage, quite analogous to
the interference by Greece in Crete."
Concluding, the Nachrichten says:
"But German theoretic opposition to
Monroeism can only be practically en
forced when German Interests are di
rectly concerned, which is not now the
case. Therefore the Nachrichten
counsels the strictest neutrality. say-
Ing: "It must be left to Spain indi
vidually to resent American insolence."
Other semi-official German newspa
pers, looking to the future Insist upon
the Importance of Germany's doing
nothing to incur the lasting enemlty
of either of the opponents.
The Schlesische Zeitung emphasizes
this opinion in saying: "There are mil
lions of Germans in the United States
who love their old home, but feel in
this matter the same as the other citi
zens of the United States."
The Vorwaerts concludes a long ar
ticle upon the war betwen Spain and
the United States by saying: "The ene
mies are too unequal to admit of any
supposition but that the war will end
in the utter exhaustion of Spain. To
Spain's loss, however, there will be no
corresponding gain to the United
States. Thus the war, no matter how
it ends, means a great disaster, and
even the dollar-crazy Americans will
hardly be able to call it 'good busi
ness.' "
Commercial men, particularly ship
pers and exporters, regard the war as
favorable to German interests. The
Russian Ambassador at Berlin, Count
yon Soten-Saoken, in an interview
with a correspondent, which presum
ably voiced the of his Govern
ment, said: "It must be recognized
that tbp Madrid Cabinet throughout
has maintained a perfectly correct,
peaceable and dignified attitude, while
the Government of the United States
has been behaving in a manner which
cannot be approved of by believers in
either justice or peace. This is the
common impression in Russia, even in
official circles. After the recent be
havior of the United States, the con
clusion is inevitable that might is go
ing before right in the Cuban ques
tion. So far as I know, Russia, like
Germany, will preserve a strict neu
trality."
GREAT INTEREST TAKEN
BY THE ENGLISH.
But the Press of London Is Begin-
ning to Follow the L ad of
German Cousins.
LONDON, April 23.â The Interest
taken by the public at large in the war
between the United States and Spain
could hardly be exceeded if Great Brit
ain herself were engaged in it. No
other topic is discussed, though hourly
editions of the newspapers are eagerly
bought, and the wildest stories are rife.
On the delivery carts 01 some of the
newspapers are displayed the Stars and
Stripes and the Union Jack, side by
side.
The St. James Gazette, continuing In
the same anti-American strain as for
several days past, says: "The blockade
will clearly not be effective. It is of
the kind which the United States prom
ised it would not endeavor to enforce,
and which no one Is bound to respect."
The paper foresees general interna
tional trouble on the subject and urges
the British Government to send Vice-
Admiral Sir John Fisher, commanding
the "West Indian and North Atlantic
squadron, on a tour of Inspection of the
Cuban coast, to report to Avhat degree
he finds the blockade in existence.
Both the St. James Gazette and Daily
News continue to print letters, the
general tendency of which is to show
that the British public does not sym
pathize with the United States.
The Daily News prints a letter say
ing that that paper, as well as the
Times, the Spectator and other papers
of the same standing, are out of touch
with the real public sentiment, "in re
gard to the present high-handed pro
ceedings of the Americans."
The Saturday Review is teeming with
insults to the United States, which, it
says, is "socially sordid to the last
degree, its courts and civil institutions
are corrupt and it has shown the world
the depth of public depravity into
which civilization is capable of de
scending." As to the reason why the
English ruling classes really "sympa
thize with Spain," the Saturday Review
says: "It is a question of manners.
We are all disgusted with those raw,
blatant Americans, who scour Europe
in search of their self-respect and can
not conduct a mere legal cause with
decency." ,

If that is true to which class do you belong ? What is your state to-day ? Are you full of big
confidence in your own powers ? Or are you afraid that you are weaker than even you fear you are ?
Jjst think the matter over. Why is it that you do not sleep at night ? Why do you awake unre-
freshed? Why do you tremble? To all these questions there is but one answer. It is because you
are at best only a half man. There is no single one of nature's functions that you can perform satis-
factorily. You cannot even walk without fear. Day by day you get weaker, because your system is
being depleted. And you have got to stop that unless you wish to become thoroughly exhausted. You
must make up to nature in some way for the manner in which you have abused her gifts. Luckily for
you that is possible. Thousands of men suffer as you do through follies. And many thousands have
been cured of the ills that come from excesses. One thing there is in the world, and one thing only,
that permanently rejuvenates men. That is "Hudyan," the great remedio-treatment of the Hudsoniari
doctors. It has cured 20,000- people. It will cure you. Write and ask about it and you will at once get
free circulars and testimonials showing you what it has done and can do, and at the same time ask for
free medical advice, no matter what ails you. It is the best in the world.

Out of fourteen events Stanford won

the hurdles, in which Morgan showed

covered the distance in 26 2-5 seconds,

that he was not pushed to win.

Morgan of Stanford and Hoffman of
California cleared the stick in the high

mile run. won by Smith of Stanford in
4 minutes 38 2-5 seconds, is a new college '
record, and as Mr. Smith was Ignored by
his fellow students as a possible winner
the surprise was doubly satisfactory to
the cardinal contingent. Smith, in a 1a 1

Matchless Bargains for April's
Last Week,
Every price quoted on this page is a record-breaker. We
are not addicted to extravagant statements in our advertisements.
What is promised is given, so that when we say V Matchless
Bargains" we mean offerings that cannot be matched. We mean
that equally as low prices on equally as good merchandise have never
been quoted in San Francisco. The quantities of each line are large,
but as fast as one article is sold out it will be replaced by others
fully as good.

AS TO INDECENT JOURNALISM.
THE Examiner lias long been indecent. Only of
late has it become so proud of its infamy as to
call attention to it by rocket and bomb. Only
since the war with Spain has it employed a band to
play its Rogue's March to the nickel of the incredu
lous.
It is with no feeling of envy The Call declares the
Examiner a disgrace to the profession of journalism.
No such feeling would be possible, for this paper has
every facility for receiving and presenting news from
the front. But The Call takes pride in printing the
truth, and when it prints rumors will label them as
such and let them go for what they may be worth. It
is not always possible at this distance from the scene
of conflict to weigh each word. It is possible to dis
tinguish between the palpable fake and the actual
news.
The Examiner yesterday published a series of
things it was pleased to term "extras." Aside from
the information contained in regular editions of all
morning papers, these "extras" declared that the
lowa had been fired on from Morro Castle. The in
formation was false, and the Examiner was aware of
the fact. It said in large type that the Paris had been
taken.' It said this knowing it to be a lie. It de
clared the American flag to be riving over Hawaii.
This was a fiction, based on nothing. It set forth the
capture of the "Bilbao," meaning the Pedro, the cir
cumstance having already been detailed. It an
nounced the taking of the Shenandoah â a mere ru
mor which had been made again and again, and each
time denied. And these were the pretexts on which
it assumed to issue an "extra." 1
There is such a thing as enterprise; there is such
a thipg as theft. In its anxiety to achieve enterprise
the Examiner has drifted naturally into theft. It has
even imported from New York a man trained under
Hearst to bilk the public. The importation has his
confidence game in full and noisy blast, but suckers
are few. Soapy Smith worked the town while on his
way to the Klondike. The Hearstlings, scattering
their bogus "extras" about, will deceive nobody
but their employer. They will swear the "extras"
Into their circulation .and he will believe them, being
what is known as a "'good thing." But as to fooling
the people, they have reached the limit. Yesterday
the Examiner announced that if during the day there
had been an important naval engagement rockets
would be fired from its building. There was no im
portant naval engagement, but the rockets were fired.
Cannot the police, headed by that valiant foe of
crime. Captain Lees, reach these bunko men?
There is nothing particular to fear from the pres
ence of Spanish spies in the South. If they can send
to Spain any news not first gathered and published
by the yellow correspondents they will be obliged to
be up early in the morning. Indeed the correspond
ents arc bound to scoop them, for the news they send
is frequently derived from a wealth ot imagination
such as a practical spy would wholly lack.
Announcement that Sherman intends to leave the
Cabinet is made again. If correct, it may be said that
his intentions, as a gentleman's should be. are hon
orable. With all regard for the distinguished ser
vices of Sherman, there can be no reasonable doubt
that the conditions of the present require a younger
man at the post of active diplomacy.
There was once a habit of designating a specimen
of decay as "rotten as a dead fish." Times have
changed. It will be necessary to substitute the Board
of School Directors for the fish, or the statement will
lack of desired emphasis.
An evening paper goes so far as to threaten to
drive the Spanish out of Spain. This may be taken
as an intimation that it intends to send a consignment
of its justly celebrated "extras" abroad.
When the Spanish bombard San Francisco it is
hoped they will bear in mind that several Cogswell
fountains are still permitted to stand. If they will
knock these out much could be forgiven.
It is said that the mission of the Spaniards who
went to talk armistice to the Cubans was a complete
failure. However, it must be regarded as fairly suc
cessful. The Spaniards were not shot.
Any Indian who outbreaks just now should be shot
on the spot, with particular reference to the spot
being a vital one.
Blanco is said to have donned his full uniform. It
is too bad Sampson's squadron cannot be warned
and turn back before too late.
THE POWER OF A SILENT PEOPLE.
A/I EN old enough to remember our Civil War
/ \ recall the grim silence that fell upon the
North when serious work came in sight.
True, there were tears without sobs, silent salutes
and a feeling that could not find expression in noise,
but must be uttered in action. When Americans are
profoundly impressed the grizzled souls of the
Roundheads thump in their ribs and they waste no
breath in shouting. When the troops left this city
the school children, to whom it was a spectacle, made
noisy demonstration, but their elders, with thoughtful
faces, gave the approval of Anglo-Saxon silence, and
in set faces and hands clinched let the onlooker read
the rising of a determination to lift the burden of re
sponsibility and carry it to the end.
In great contrast is the noisy roar of Spain. From
Madrid to the provinces heads are hot and throats
hoarse with shouting. The mob attacks effigies and
emblems with a venomous vigor that might better be
reserved for the contacts of war.
The Spanish Minister took his passports, retired
from Washington and crossed the frontier with none
other than the polite attention which traveling gen
tlemen in this country get f.om other traveling gen
tlemen, and in the quiet enjoyment of the luxury and
pleasure which American railways furnish their
patrons. The American Minister left Madrid and
proceeded to the frontier through a shower of stones
and was compelled to leave his berth to defend from
capture his secretary, who was about to be arrested
because nis name was Moreno. Nothing can be more
childish than all this sound and fury. As Spain
stands to-day, judged by her conduct, Don Quixote
should be at the head of her armies, with a wash
basin on his head for the helmet of Mambrino and
his lance in tilt at a row of windmills, while his faith
ful squire, Sancho Panza, chews garlic by his side
and carries love-letters to the Lady del Toboso.
Spain lives and shouts in the past, tries to fatten
her lean ribs on glories that have faded. America
lives in the future and keeps step in the long march
toward it, breaks silence only with the word of com
mand, the roar of guns and the shriek of flying shells.
It is not an agreeable task to discharge the duty
we have assumed. It is no less than the destruction
of a power that has outlived its defensive energies and
retains only the spirit of misgovernment and the
power of bad example. Spain is like a man who has
failed in all legitimate lines and, refusing to accept
fate with philosophy, become predatory, violent and
lawless. The law has to put its hand upon him and
subject him to those restraints which are required by
the good order of the community. This task has fal
len to us, and we enter upon it in the spirit which be
comes a people commissioned to "end the pretensions
of a decayed personality among the nations.
As we read the signs now set in the American hori
zon our people feel their strength, know their duty
and will hasten its performance, and then the plow
will turn the furrow again, men will go back to mill
and shop, and Europe will have the way pointed out
to her to shut her eyes to the balance of power and
to consider only the balance of justice in dealing with
Turkey, that problem which protects wickedness,
promotes slatighter, disfigures frontiers and practices
murder.
THE TREASURY AND THE CHARTER.
THE efforts of a morning contemporary to make
it appear that Treasurer Widber would not now
be a defaulter if the new charter were in force
is in strict accordance with the campaign of obfusca
tion which is accompanying the advocacy of that
measure. Nothing can be more absurd than the
claim that the system of accounts proposed by the
new charter will prevent defalcations in the Treasury.
No system can guard against negligence. If an eye
is not kept upon the Treasurer under the new charter,
as the most casual reader of the instrument may as
certain, he can embezzle the money of the taxpayers
with as much impunity as Widber has embezzled it
under the consolidation act.
As a matter of fact, however, the Treasury espion
age now provided by law is superior to that found in
the proposed charter. The monthly count of money
by the Mayor, Auditor and Superior Judge is abol
ished by the new instrument, and in its stead the
charter makers have substituted a system of state
ments. The Treasurer is required to make a monthly
statement of cash in his hands, and all officials who
deal with him are required to do likewise. If these
do not balance the Auditor is directed to prick up his
ears.
The "joint custody safe," it is true, brings the
Auditor into more intimate relations with the Trea
surer, but all this practically amounts to is to compel
the Auditor to open and close the Treasurer's safe
every day. The new charter, in fact, says in terms
that the Auditor "shall have no control over them
(the funds) except to open and close the safe in con
junction with the Treasurer, when requested to do
so in his official capacity, and shall not be held re
sponsible on his official bond for any shortage which
may occur in the Treasury." This is weaker than the
present law. Both the Mayor and Auditor are now
responsible for overlooking deficits in the Treasury.
The consolidation act provides that once a month
the Mayor, Auditor and Superior Judge shall "see"
and count the money in the Treasury. Had this been
done in the case of Widber that individual would not
row be in jail. No system of checks or accounts
can be substituted for ocular evidence in supervising
the Treasurer's books. If the new charter had been
in force Widber's defalcation would not have been
discovered so long as a sufficient amount of coin re
mained in the vault to pay current expenses. Surely
the Auditor would never discover a deficit by merely
opening and closing the "joint custody safe." The
fact, therefore, that the proposed charter abolishes
the monthly count of the Mayor, Auditor and Su
perior Judge is a good reason for opposing it, even if
special provision were not made by section 3 of chap
ter 3 of article IV for keeping money in bags with
tags upon them. Under Treasurer Widber's system
this would facilitate embezzlement. Lead pipe and
wagon washers under the new charter would do un
limited duty in these bags for coin.
THE VOLUNTEER ARMY.
BY its terms the volunteer army act is designed to
be not an emergency measure merely, but a
part of the permanent legislation of the coun
try. Its object is to provide not only for this, but
for any future contingency in which the United States
Government will have need of a larger and stronger
military force than that of the regular army. As such
it is a new step in the evolution of the nation, and in
its consequences may prove to be one of the most
important that has been taken in recent years.
By the new law the National Government will deal
directly with the people in raising any army it de
sires, and will not have to act through the medium
of the States, as in former years. In bygone wars the
need of same such power was strongly felt. In 1812
THE SAJN iffIAyCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APEIL 24, 1898.
the conduct of the campaign for the defense of the
northern frontier was seriously handicapped by the
refusal of the Governors of several of the New Eng
land States to send any troops outside their borders.
This so far weakened our strength that we were not
only unable to successfully invade Canada, but ac
tually suffered the capture of Detroit.
The evil of the situation was recognized at that
time, but the State sovereignty spirit was too strong
in all parts of the Union to permit of a remedy. Even
as late as 1861 the call for volunteers had to be made
through the State Governors, and, as is well known,
the Governors of several of the States refused to re
spond, just as had been done fifty years before. The
Civil War. however, settled the issue of State sov
ereignty, both as a legal principle and as a popular
sentiment. There would be no failure on the part of
any Governor to furnish volunteers for the present
war, but none the less Congress does not wait upon
them to do so. The volunteer armies of the present
and the future will be provided for by Congress and
called for by the President. They will be armies of
the nation, and not a combination of State troops
acting together.
It is to be noted, however, that the new law does
not wholly eliminate the States and their governments
from consideration. It provides that when a volun
teer army is called for the men received into the
service shall be taken as far as practicable from the
several States and Territories in proportion to their
population- It is further provided that all company
and regimental officers shall be appointed by the Gov
ernors of the States in which such organizations are
raised. These provisions are survivals of the old
Federal spirit and will help to make the new law ac
ceptable to the people, if any help should be needed.
It remains to be seen by actual test of war how the
divided authority in the appointment of officers will
work. If any friction should result it is easy to fore
see that an amendment would soon be made taking
away the appointing power from the Governors and
placing the whole volunteer force, like the regular
army, under the exclusive control of the national
authorities. Nor would there be any widespread op
position among the people. We have made a nation
in fact, and the laws will sooner or later have to fit
the fact.
HARBOR COMMISSIONERS REBUKED.
THE full decision of Judge Belcher in the case of
Samuel C. Irving vs. the Harbor Commission
ers is published in another column. Every word
of it is worth reading. By it the commission is re
buked in terms most scathing. Yet there is in the re
buke no sign of aught but the product of a judicial
mind, devoid of prejudice and stating the simple
facts.
It is seldom that the mere rendering of a decision
involves the excoriation of any party to an action.
It is possible that both parties may have been in
spired by the belief that the contention set up would
be sustained by the law. If the Harbor Commissioners
entertained any such idea it has been rudely dispelled.
If President Colnon had a thought that he was re
garded as an angel of light a great flood of intelli
gence has been poured in upon him.
So complete is the statement from the bench, such
an absolute overthrow of the contentions set up by
the Harbor Commissioners, that an extended epitome
of it would be useless when the article appears in its
entirety. In brief, it is shown that the Commission
ers rejected bids for the simple purpose of giving
their pets a chance, and the court does not mince the
truthâ on the contrary, setting it forth in plain terms.
It is shown that the advice of Special Counsel Strat
ton was not only wrong, but that the special counsel
had in law no warrant for his existence. It is shown
that the Commissioners rejected bids as "too high,"
and having eliminated the bidders objectionable to
themselves, accepted bids as high as the original.
Judge Belcher declares that the grossest favoritism
is apparent. The rejection of the bids, among which
was that of the plaintiff, is described as being en
tirely without warrant in law, as being arbitrary,
capricious and in bad faith. These conclusions do
not surprise. Yet it is gratifying to have them set
forth with such clarity, and from a source which can
not be accused of bias.
The character of the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners begins to be plainer. The Call, in its capacity
of a public journal, has endeavored to make it clear.
Doubtless the Belcher decision will be of material
assistance to the Grand Jury. One who is faithless
in little things will be equally faithless in great things.
A body capable of cheating the State in the paraffin
ing of a lot of piles would not hesitate to cheat it in
the construction of a depot worth many thousands.
REPUBLICAN LEAGUE CONVENTION.
BY authority of the National Republican League
convention of 1897, and under the direction of
the California State League, a convention of
delegates from all Republican clubs in California has
been called to meet in this city for the purpose of dis
cussing plans and making preparations for the work
of the coming campaign. The work to be performed
is an important one, and Republican organizations
throughout the State should make preparations to
take part in it.
The terms of the call open a way for representation
for all genuine Republican club organizations of the
State. It provides that each Republican club in Cali
fornia, including those of the American Republican
College League, shall be entitled to one delegate at
large and one delegate additional for every twenty
five members upon its rolls. Organizations of Re
publican Veterans are especially invited to participate.
No club shall be entitled to representation in the
State League convention unless it has been organ
ized and in existence at least ten days prior to the
date of the convention. No person shall be counted
for representation in more than one club.
Under these terms the convention will be large
enough to be thoroughly representative of the Re
publicanism of the State, and the work accomplished
by it will be felt in the campaign which is rapidly ap
proaching. Every young and active Republican
should associate himself with some club and help to
increase the representation which his section of the
party will have at the convention.
The campaign this year is to be one of critical im
portance. There are to be elected a Governor, mem
bers of Congress and members of the Legislature,
who in turn will elect a United States Senator. It
is not going to be an easy victory for Republican
ism, for the Democrats have now the governorship,
and with their Populist allies have four out of the
seven members of Congress. To win a sweeping vic
tory there will be needed hard work and prompt
work. The clubs have done and are doing great
things in the way of perfecting the organization
needed to accomplish success on election day, and all
Republicans should cordially co-operate with them
in the effort to make the coming convention one of
the most inspiring and effective political gatherings
in the history of the commonwealth.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
A friend suggests that I try to engi
neer this modest department for one
week without abusing anybody. I fear
from this that he has a misconception
of the motives which underlie the be
nign criticism he terms "abuse." I do
not write harshly from any love of say
ing aught in malice or to wound. But
there is not always necessity for ex
tolling virtue, it is known to be good,
whereas it is a plain duty to expose
the ill which assumes the garb of vir
tue and parades annoylngly.
The poetry received this week will
never reach the public if I can help it.
I say this out of regard for the pub
lic, which Is having trouble enough.
There could not well have been a
thing more shameless than the New
York Journal's offer to a minister to
write up the "Tenderloin," save the
preacher's acceptance. A minister who
would leave his regular calling to wan
der among scenes of debauchery al
ready known to exist, repeatedly ex
ploited, and revelations concerning
which could serve no purpose of de
cency, stamps himself by that act as
grossly perverted, vile of instinct and
fitted to be a denizen of the haunts
of sin instead of a paid spectator. Ac
cording to contemporaries of the Jour
nal the minister who thus thrust him
self into temptation found there con
genial company at his natural level.
He did not work a reformation, but he
is now a subject for reform. Hearst
is probably proud of this feat. He
can delegate somebody to write up the
minister, and thus his continual per
formance show proceed without inter
ruption. But Ido not think the fall
of this minister a notable episode. It
was not attended by an impressive
plunk. He had such a short distance
to fall.
â¢ * â¢
Not having any knowledge of naval
affairs I can discuss them with the
same freedom now being employed by
a lot of correspondents who are in the
same fix. The difference is that they
do not seem to have grasped the truth
patent enough to everybody else. They
cherish a delusion that their informa
tion is complete, their conclusions flaw
less. I concede that my information
may be all wrong, and my conclusions
knocked into a cocked hat at the first
engagement. It does not seem to me
that the fear of torpedo-boats sinking
our battle-ships rests on any basis of
fact or reason. It is true that these
little boats under certain conditions
can do serious damage, but conditions
in a sudden fight are not made to order.
Provided the water be calm, the battle
ship's searchlamp thoughtfully extin
guished to save the wear on the elec
tric wire, the crew asleep, the lookout
below playing craps, the torpedo-boat
will be a formidable enemy. But until
the torpedo-boat shall acquire the
knack of keeping afloat when there is a
breeze, and can get itself enveloped in
invisible paint, its principal part in the
tragedies of war will be in taking a
short course to the bottom of the deep
blue sea. This belief is far from offi
cial, and it is subject to amendment. I
can amend it when necessary. This for
the benefit of friends who might try
to do it for me.
Of course every composing-room is
governed by a certain set of rules, but
when in time of war I write "God of
battles" there is going to be a capital
G or trouble.
It is a strange circumstance that the
arrest of Treasurer Widber should be
the occasion of expressions of sym
pathy for him. There never before
came under my observation a case of
larceny so mean and low. Widber had
been chosen to a position of trust, at
tached to which there is an income suf
ficient to permit a life of reasonable
luxury, an income several times
greater than most men ever hope to
attain. Yet he turned thief because
the instinct was in him. He betrayed
the public and his friends because to
do so was more natural than for him to
be honest. The affair is worse than
merely criminal. It is disgusting and
repellant. There is an instinctive re
spect for the courage of the bandit, but
disregard for the sneak thief is com
plete. Widber did not have even the
intelligence to so use his booty as to
make it yield a scant return in pleas
ures of themselves decent. He sought
companionship from wnich a scalawag
with some vague shadow of remaining
self-respect would have shrunk as de
basing and distasteful. He bet on the
races without having the thrill of see
ing the horses run. Now he complains
that friends have deserted him. It is
to be fervently hoped that Widber'a
punishment shall be speedy and ade
quate. He deserves a life sentence for
the crime itself, and forty years extra
for having the nerve to reproach those
to whom he proved traitor.
California would feel a thrill of pride
to see Governor Budd go to the front.
If with his fire helmet, a hand grenade,
a speaking trumpet and an ax the ex
ecutive did not succeed in cooling thÂ«
seething .blood of Spain, then, indeed,
would the world know the affair to
be serious. Standing on the Florida
coast with the trumpet alone, he would
be able to give the troops at Havana
an impression of impending calamity
and failing to take to the woods, their
fates would be on their own heads.
He would cross over and brandishing
his ax herd them into Morro Castls,
where he would lay the law down to
them. The only disadvantage under
these circumstances would arise from
the fact that the speaking trumpet has
been but indifferently trained in Span
ish, though when it spouts English
walls totter and strong men turn pale.
But were the Dons discreet enough to
fly to the hills they would be tolera*

The love of country is as instinctive
as the love of home. Probably those
of us whose minds do not go back
clearly to a time when peace had van
ished, and the land was riven with
strife, have not realized until now how
much of this feeling is in each indi
vidual, how we revere the flag, how
affection would go out to the soldiers
marching away to defend it. It had
not been my privilege to witness the
departure of the artillery, but I looked
upon the infantry filing by toward war.

voices broke in tears. They sought to
speak a final message to him, and could
only press a flower into his hand. They
wished him godspeed and could not say
it. And yet they had been strangers,
moving in different walks of life. At
last they stood on a common plan.?.
The shadow of the stars and stripes
was over all; in every mind, one
thought. There could not have been a
sight more beautiful than the scene on
Van Ness avenue as the First filed by.
Children were there, thousands of
them. They did not laugh as children
are wont, but seemed to realize the
solemnity of the event. It was not
music and brightness wholly. There
was an undertone of sorrow, and the
little ones, not able to understand, yet
took their tone from it. Along the
avenue was a double line of color. Ban
ners were waving in countless hands,
ribbons decorated the old and young,
while flowers were in such profusion
that the air was perfume. The infantry
approached with steady tramp, tramp,
tramp, there was the sound of drums,
and over the dual lines of color rolled
a wave of life and motion as across a
field a mimic billow is driven by the
breeze. Even the babes stood on tip
toe and trebled their enthusiasm, greet
ing the sc-ldiers with smiles, gazing at
them, almost wondering and looking
after them as long as the troop, like
one great living thing, could be seen
undulating down the thoroughfare.
There was then a mist before more
than the eyes of the children. What
ever the future may bring to these sol
diers, the memory of their last hours
in this city by the western sea must be
with them to take from hardship and
even from death a measure of bitter
ness. From an alien shore it must be

have the boys in blue been treated in
every place. If some poet inspired by
the spirit of patriotism which possesses
this great land were to give form to
the sentiments causing the present
pulsebeats of emotion he would sing a
sweeter and mightier song of war than
has ever thrilled the human heart.
It is not a pleasing task to call at
tention to a brutal and untimely dis
play made recently by the Examiner.
One night during the week the build
ing in which that sheet is fabricated
was wreathed in red fire, bombs ex
ploded from the roof and rockets
whizzed into the sky, while a barfd
played lively airs. There was every
sign of jubilation. The pretext was
that war had become certain. The real
reason was that the scarlet woman of
journalism had once more bedecked
herself with gauds and obtruded upon
decency. As the painted creature of
the street thrusts herself into notice, so
does her journalistic prototype, each
unabashed in the presence of rebuke.
The certainty of war is nothing over
which to rejoice. War is at best a
dread calamity. It means, that men
will take up arms and bear them to
death. It means suffering, mutilation,
broken hearts, sorrows that never heal.
It means that homes will be given over
to desolation, that poverty will come
into the house of plenty. War may
be necessary to uphold the national
honor, but whatever its cause, and
whatever its outcome, the better na
ture shrinks from it, and pity gives
way to tears. Only a heartless and
sordid concern, dead to the impulse
now stirring the minds of the -people,
would take advantage of the oppor
tunity to paint its character red
against the black shadow of an ap
proaching tragedy, and with sounding
bombs attract notice to its own degra
dation.
The hope that the war with Spain
will be an "incident" culminating in
complete surrender of the Dons does
not seem to have a foundation so far
as lay observers have been able to dis
cover. There is no doubt the Spanish
are convinced that the only purpose of
this country in interfering with Cuba
is to take the island and keep it. It
is natural for them to think it. They
are not subject to the same emotions
as may arouse a civilized people. Their
own career has been one of bloody
conquest and bloody efforts to retain
that which violence had won. They
have never acted on a humane im
pulse, never having experienced one.
But they will fight as long as they
have aught to fight with or for. The
Latin temperament does not readily
submit. It is the temperament which
impels the dying soldier to bite at the
heel of the triumphant enemy who
steps across him. There seems noth-
ing unreasonable in supposing the
Spanish shrewd enough to keep out of
the way as long as possible, and while
American ships guard Cuban waters

He has been guilty of stealing a shirt

One of the extraordinary features of
the present war prospect has been tha
remarkable flow of gold to this country.
Since the blowing up of the Maine in
Havana harbor on February 15, when war
became really imminent, the gold imports
have reached the enormous sum of $61,

THE order calling the National
Guard of California into active ser
vice was not signed by the Gov
ernor yesterday. The plans have
been somewhat modified since
last Thursday evening, and the
guard as .1 divisional organiza
tion may not be put in the field.
Governor Budd and General Merriam,
U. S. A., commanding the Department
of California, exchanged views Friday
night. The concentration of troops at
Chattanooga, which leaves a slender
garrison at the Presidio, was noted.
General Merriam regards the force of
regulars now 011 duty at the Presidio as
ample for the present.
Governor Budd estimated yesterday
that it would cost the State $300,000 to
maintain the National Guard in active
service for thirty days, and he does not
feel justified in authorizing this expense
in view of the uncertainty regarding the
number of troops that may be called for
from California under the proclamation
of the President.

The exchange was a place where enlist

â¢without the trouble of leaving the res

Colonel M. P. Miller, headquarters,

The three batteries of the Third Artil
lery now on duty at the Presidio are
engaged at the guns of the Fort Point
fortifications. The works are manned
day and night and a constant outlook
Is maintained.
Colonel Morris, the post commander,
recognizes that it is the unexpected
that happens and so vigilance Is main
tained to prevent surprise. It is not
known that there is a Spanish cruiser
or privateer within 1000 miles of this
harbor, yet the possibility of a bold
cruiser making a dash in this direction
ounted.
past thirty days the for

of rapid-fire guns to bear on any dar

inside. The Call knows where
these rapid-fire guns are stationed, but
governed by the v ish<-s of the military
authorities does not <i'-signate the loca

the Presidio that there is a naval pa
trol outside, but the range of the pa

that the Monterey, commanded by
Lieutenant Commander James W. Car

Office Hoursâ 9 a. m. to 10 p. m.; Sundays 0 to 2 p. m.
were carefully studied at headquarters
yesterday. The announcement by wire
that the President would call for 125,000
men gave the military authorities an op
portunity to approximate the number
to be furnished by California. It is ex
pected that the State's quota will be
2300.
The statement coming from Major-
General Miles, U. S. A., that volunteers
will go into camp in their own States for
thirty days before leaving for the Gulf
coast, engaged the earnest attention of
Governor Budd. After reading this
telegram the Governor remarked: "This
plan for holding troops in their respec
tive States for thirty days will give me
time to make a careful selection of
officers."
When asked what point or points he
would designate for the State troops
to go into camp the Governor replied:
"I think San Francisco will be the point
designated. The troops may go into
camp at the Presidio."
The Governor is still of the mind that

THE GUARD READY.
Activity at Headquarters, i
Troops Awaiting Orders
for Active Service.
To all intents and purposes the Na
tional Guard of the State of California
is resting upon its arms. Governor Budd,
as commander-in-chief, is ready at a
moment's notice to send the necessary
orders flashing over the wires that will
call the Guard into active service. From
the Governor to the lowest private every
i man is ready and anxious to answer the
call to support and uphold the honor of
â¢â Old Glory." The expectation that orders
might be received at any hour from
Washington, D. G., calling upon the Gov
! ernor to furnish his pro rata of iroops
from the National Guard, as provided
for under the army volunteer bill, drew
to the adjutant general's headquarters at
an early hour many of the officers of the
Governor's staff and the National Guard.
Captain Carrlnpton, V. S. A., Colonel
' Burgin, Captain William Elliot of San
Rafael, General Warfield and Major Mc-
Carthy were among the first officers to
arrive at headquarters.
The Governor arrived shortly before
noon and was immediately closeted with
Adjutant General Barrett, Captain Car
rington and others of the officers pres
ent. Among those who hold conferences
with the Governor was the newly ap
pointed Treasurer, W. S. Green.
The Governor, upon his arrival, stated
that ho had issued no orders, but was
Bimply awaiting for instructions from the
War JDepartment at Washington before
â  doing so. His entire time yesterday was
i-.insumed in the consideration of mili
i tary matters demanding his attention.
There was some doubt expressed yester
day as to whether California could fur
i nish her auota of men provided for in
the army volunteer bill. Regarding this
Adjutant General Barrett said: "The
Slate can easily furnish from the Na
tional Guard any and all demands that
will be made upon it."
A report was circulated yesterday
morning that the National Guard had
been ordered out, but such was not the
case. The regiments of the National
tJuard sire always practically upon wait
ing orders. Acting under orders from
Governor Budd, Adjutant-General Bar-,
rett ordered a telephone to be placed in
his private office for the use of the Gov
ernor. This was done for a purpose. The
Chief Executive deems it advisable to
keep all orders that he may transmit over
the telephone strictly private. Formerly
he has been forced to transmit all mes
sages over the telephone in his ante
chamber where his officers are assembled.
Governor Budd very wisely determined to
keep all military business entirely private
until he shall see fit to give it out.
Captain Carrington, U. S. A., has been
besieged by callers and received many
applications from persons desiring to en
list. He says that he has no authority in
the matter. The Government will recog
nize the National Guard aft an organiza
tion, and all volunteers desiring to see
service will have to enlist with the va
rious sub-organizations composing the
National Guard.
<"aptain c'arrington was one of the busi
est officers at headquarters yesterday.
He was frequently called into conferences
by the Governor.
The Governor was absent from head
quarters for some time in the evening,
bring in attendance at the Zeta Psi ban
quet given at the California. Many of
, the officers left temporarily for much
noedfd rest. The adjutant-general,
however, true to his military training of
the "sixties." remained on duty. Colonel
Philip 1.. Bush of the Governor's staff
was with the adjutant general during the
1 evening. The latter officer gave out to
, the press the statement that no orders
had been promulgated during the day by
the Governor or himself. It is probable,
! however, that some minor instructions
may have been issued, but nothing of
any importance was done by the execu
tive. Yesterday was a day of eager and
anxious waiting. The adjutant general
does not anticipate that orders will be
received from the War Department be
fore to-morrow, but of course this is not
certain, and to-day will entail upon the
, officers further hours of watching and
waiting for the momentarily expected
word of command.
In event of the cavalry being ordered
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 24, 1898.
Fresno, Stockton and other large cities
of California where National Guard or
ganizations are maintained, should have
equal opportunity with San Francisco
and Oakland for representation in the
first two regiments of volunteers to be
mustered into the United States service
from California. On this point the Gov
ernor said: "I shall make an effort to
give representation .to all parts of the
State. â Since it appears now that the
troops will remain in camp here for
thirty days before going to the front,
I will probably have time to consider
this subject in all its bearings. If troops
were expected to move immediately I
might adopt the plan of sending two
regiments as now organized and offi
cered."
The act of Congress authorizing the
President to call volunteers into the
service of the United States gives the
Governor the right to appoint and com
mission all officers below the rank of
brigadier general. The colonels, lieu
tenant colonels, majors, captains and
lieutenants commissioned by Governor
from the Presidio it seems to be the pre
vailing impression among the officers
that the First Infantry of this city will
be detailed to fill thoir place. It was ex
pected during the earlier part of the day
that the Governor would go to Sacramen
to in the afternoon, but his excellency,
appreciating the serious nature of the
present situation, and knowing that it is
best for him to be here in person when
orders come, did not go, and he will
probably remain here until definite news
has been received from the War Depart
ment.
THE SAFETY OF
THE GRAIN FLEET
Some Apprehension as to
What Course Spain
Will Pursue.
With the reported seizure of thÂ« Shen
andoah comes the fear of the grain men
that the wheat-laden vessels bound from
this port to England may fare badly at
the hands of Spain; but the fact that of
the whole fleet the Shenandoah is the only
American vessel has allayed the excite
ment to some extent
The Shenandoah was the first of the
grain fleet to leave this year. She sailed
January 5, under Captain Murphy, with
a cargo of 103,717 centals of wheat and
1725 centals of barley, shipped by Balfour,
Guthrie & Co. She headed a list of forty
vessels, all carrying Californian wheat
and all bound for England. But in the
other thirty-nine there is not another
American bottom. They are mostly Brit
ish, with a few French and one Italian.
It is the policy of the United States
that goods belonging to the enemy, not
contraband and under a neutral flag, shall
be exempt from seizure on the seas. This
would include just such shipments as are
being made in the other ships of the
fleet; but it remains to be seen whether
or not Spain will take the same view. She
may assert the right to capture all
American goods under any circum
stances, no matter under what flag they
are being carried, although, of course,
she could not touch the ship unless it were
under the American flag. That is priva
teering, and so long as the goods shipped
are not sold by their American owner to
the foreign consignee they may bo con
sidered a fair prize, but all the merchants
have to do will be to sell before ship
ment, and then the seizure of such a
cargo by Spain will cause all kinds of
trouble. So far, Spain has not announced
what she will seize and what she will let
alone, but she cannot prey upon any but
what Is strictly American, or she will
have more than the United States to
fight. Europe cannot afford to allow
Spain to destroy the trade she enjoys
with this country.
SONG OF THE MAINE.
Little Emma Baettge Tells
in Rhymeo? the Havana
Tragedy,
The tales of war have seized upon the
soul of little Emma Baettge, the 13
year-old daughter of one of the men of
the Monterey, and she has poured out
her childish patriotism In two
dozen lines of poetry, of which trr men
of the monitor are as proud as If it had
helped them to capture a ship. Each
man has a copy, and every one Is able
to repeat the stanzas from memory,
and the proud father keeps the original
for exhibition on state occasions only.
The tragic end of the Maine is the
theme of the song of. the youthful
poetess, and the fires of enthusiasm
glow from every word and phrase. The
verses are as follows:
THE BATTLE-SHIP MAINE.
Into tha harbor of Havana
One winter's day there came
One of Uncle Sam's white squadron.
The battle-Fhip Maine.
And as she dropped her anchor
In that quiet little bay.
She came with the Intention
Of a very peaceful stay.
But one night as she lay peacefully
Underneath the southern moon,
A torpedo came and sent the ship
And sailors to their doom,
little did they think that night
When the bugle sounded taps
And they took down their hammock*,
That that would be the last.
This cruel wrong must be avenged,
V.ell fight with heart and fame
To make those cruel Spaniards pay
For the lives on the battle-ship Maine.
Now all of you who have left a heart
To give to war and whirl,
Go fight, and you will have tha prayer*
Of a little American girl.
TORPEDOES
FOR SAN DIEGO
San Diego harbor Is to bewell protected.
Yesterday the lighthouse tender Madrono
came over from Goat Island and went
alongside the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's steamer Bonita, and the work
of transferring twenty-five torpedoes and
all the necessary anchors and electrical
appliances was soon completed. The
Bonita then proceeded to sea. She will
discharge her dangerous cargo at Ballast
Point, and in twenty-four hours from that
time the torpedoes will be in position and
ren/iy to welcome any Spanish cruiser
that may seek to enter San Diego harbor.
DARE TO THE FRONT.
Son of the United States
Appraiser Joins the
First Infantry.
Starr Dare, son of John T. Dare, the
I'nited States Appraiser, is one of the
young Americans who has shown his
true colors when he thought the country
needed soldiers. On last Tuesday he went
to the Presidio, and without saying a
word to his parents presented himself to
the recruiting officer, and inside of three
hours he passed all the necessary exam
inations and took tne oath to support Old
Glory through all trials and tribulations.
When he returned home and informed
his mother of what he had done she, as
a matter of course, burst out crying, but
it was only for a brief spell. Her patri
otic blood got the better of her motherly
feeling, she fondly kissed her boy and
gave him her blessing.
On the return of Mr. Dara to his homo
Budd will hold their commissioned rank
in the United States volunteer service..
It is well settled that officers for ac
tive service in the field will be selected
with regard to their fitness to command,
but it does not follow that the wishes
of the men to be commanued will have
no weight in the selection.
Early Monday morning the Governor
will doubtless receive from Washington
the official call for volunteers. Imme
diately upon its receipt steps will be
taken to place two regiments of infantry
in the field.
Last evening Governor Budd received
a message by wire from the Mayor of
Santa Barbara. The Governor is asked
to procure immediately for the defense
of Santa Barbara two ten-inch breech
loading rifled guns, and also obtain dis
appearing carriages on which to mount
the guns. The application received im
mediate consideration. As it will re
quire at least three months' time to pre
pare emplacements and put in position
guns o f this pattern, the Governor may
mi tiie meantime send to Santa Barbara
a section of field artillery to repel the
Spanish invader.
in the evening he was apprised of the
act of his son. He simply said "Good,"
and added: "When I joined the army
during the late rebellion I joined a State
regiment, and merely did police duty
whore there was no powder burned or
honors earned. If a man wants to be a
soldier let him go at it in earnest; no half
way measures."
With these encouraging words from his
father, and with his mother's blessing,
young Dare marched out of San Fran
cisco inside of twenty-four hours after
he enlisted with his regiment, bound for
Cuba or any other place on earth where
I'ncle Sam may need his services. This
is grit of the right sort in one of San
Francisco's native sons; but blood will
tell every time.
MUST DO OUR DUTY.
Should Shoulder a Mus
ket or Care for the
Wounded.
Now that the war has materialized
into a serious and terrible reality, it
behooves every American to do for his
country all that lies in his or her pow
er, not only in shouldering a musket
and marching bravely to the front, but
also in giving consideration for the
care of the sick and wounded of our
army.
I therefore consider the immediate
formation of the sanitary commission
and a Red Cross Society an imperative
necessity, and I will do my utmost to
further the noble work inaugurated by
The Call. It is a movement in which
all humanity is seriously interested.
The work of the sanitary commission
and Red Cross Society will do much to
relieve the horrors of the war by min
istering to the wounded on the field
and caring for the sick in the tempo
rary military hospitals.
As the seat of operation of our land
forces will necessarily be in a country
known to breed dreadful fevers, it is
reasonable to expect that many of our
army will be infected, and for these we
must provide ample supplies and
means for their care. This nan best be
done thn.mgh the medium uÂ£ the sani
tary commission, while the members of
the Red Cross Society will nurse the
men back to health again.
The members of the Red Cross So
ciety are honored and respected by
friend and foe alike in all parts of the
civilized world, and the noble work
done by them in the past is paged in
history.
I say again the immediate formation
of the sanitary commission and a Red
Cross Society is an imperative neces
sity. DR. T. A. ROTTANZI.

stated the object of the society to be to
aid in every way in the equipment of the
Irish volunteers and to organize a corps
of Irish women to go to the front 3R

The Epworth League can be relied
upon to do its full share of relief work
as well as to furnis"h its quota of men
for the field. We believe right and
freedom should prevail, and that under
Christian enlightenment and courage
it must do so. Good citizenship is one
of the league's tenets, and we are

Significant Inquiry of Collector
Jackson by Secretary
Gage.
None of That Brand of Vessels Have
Been Seen Here for Many
Years.
The United States Government does not
propose to let any Spanish vessels slip
in or out of the harbor of San Francisco
without being captured, and yester
day took the precautionary measures
toward that end by telegraphing the fol
lowing to Collector of the Port Jackson:
Collector of Customs. San Francisco, Cal.:
The President has proclaimed blockade of ports
on north coast of Cuba, from Cardenas to
Bahia Honda, also of Clenfuegos on south

L. J. GAGE. Secretary of the Treasury.
The "instructions of 20th instant" have
not yet been received, they being prob
ably on the way by mail.
There is no Spanish vessel in port at
the present time, and there has not been
one for years. Four or five years ago a
Spanish ship came in here for a car&Â°
of wheat. Prior to that time the Mar
ciuts de Campos' line of steamers was
running between this port and Panama
and way stations on the Mexican and
Central American coasts. The line did
not pay and was discontinued about
eight or ten years ago. The steamer
Bristol well-known at this port, was one
of the De Campos line, and was named
the Costa Rica.
There are no Spanish ships on the way
here so far as can be learned, and none
are expected, except probably a cruiser
or two to gather a crop of blue eggs at
the Farallon Islands.
HENRY M. HERVEY DEAD.
Was One of the First Santa Clara
Valley Orchardists.
SAN JOSE, April 23.â Henry M. Hervey,
a pioneer of this valley, died at his home
in the Willows yesterday afternoon. He
was a native of New York and eighty
three years of age.
The deceased crossed the plain p- by ox
team in 1849, and in 1852 settled near this
city He purchased land in the illows
and was one of the first to plant an or
chard in that district. His wife died two
years ago, shortly after the fifty-eighth
anniversay of their marriage. Four chil
dren survive himâ Mrs. Lena White Mrs.
Rose Stratton, Professor W. R. Hervey
and Dr. C. H. Hervey. The funeral will
be held to-morrow.
Death of a Gonzales Native.
SALINAS, April 23.â Nicholas Alviso.
one of the oldest native sons of Monterey
County, died near Gonzales yesterday
evening. He was born at Nativldad, near
Salinas, S6 years ago, and went to Gon
zales in the seventies. He spent most of
his life on the back of an old horse, when
not asleep, rarely ever being seen on
foot, but the infirmities of age laid hands
on him. and he turned the old charger
loose. The animal died two weeks ago,
aged 29 years. Alviso was in moderate
circumstances.
Epidemic of Election Contests.
SALINAS, April 23.â Following the foot

F. H. Lang, defeated lor Councilman in
the First Ward by J. A. G. Adcock by a
majority of 22 votes, brings suit to have
Adcock ousted, alleging that the election
was null and void because the polls closed
at 5 o'clock instead of at sundown. The
trial has been set for May 4.
Will Not Flood Union Island.
STOCKTON, April 23.â The project of
flooding Union Island on account of the
drouth has been abandoned. The main
obstacle was the excessive amount of
damages claimed by those who have
grain patches. Besides, it was feared
that there would not be enough water
to cover the entire island, as the river is
likely to fall at any time. Miller & Lux
are moving much stock to the island on
barges.
SAN RAFAEL TO HAVE
NO ROSE FESTIVAL
The Projected Carnival Deemed Un

Engaged in War.
SAN RAFAEL, April 23.â A1l over town
the gaunt skeletons of what were intend
ed for triumphal arches rear their mel
ancholy height toward the heavens, grim
monuments to failure on the very eve of
success. For Providence, aided and abet
ted by the Ladies' Auxiliary- League, has
decided that in these tempestuous times
of war a rose festival would be an anom
aly. The festival is postponed until the
spring of ISO 9. or until such time as the
citizens of San Rafael may determine.
Yesterday the ladies met and the fol
lowing resolution, offered by Mrs. A. W.
Foster, was adopted unanimously:
"Whereas, As our country is at war it
would be unbecoming to go on with a
carnival of flowers or any other kind of
rejoicing; therefore be it
"Resolved, xhat we suggest the post
ponement of the festival indefinitely."
There were objections on the part of
some citizens, but in the end the ladies
carried the day.

DR. PIERCES MEDICINES.
BY FORCE OF ARMS!
POOR UNHAPPY CUBA
When a man with a deadly weapon
in his grasp says "Halt!" it means
something. When a mighty nation
equipped with all the munitions and
armaments of war says "Halt!" it
means more; but it means most of all
when all-powerful and benignant Na-
ture raises her invincible forces to
phield and protect the sick and suffer-
ing.
Poor, wretched, unhappy Cuba is not
m f^-J'jA
Wore to be pitied nor in greater need
of help than the ten thousand ailing,
miserable, discouraged Americans to
whom these words are addressed. But
there is a mighty power of nature con-
cealed yet ever active and forceful in
that wonderful "Golden Medical Dis-
covery." which has saved a hundred
thousand Americans from a worse
death than shooting or starvation; a
death by slow, lingering, wearing, wast-
ing, inexorable disease.
"How has this been done?" Was it
a miracle? Was it an accident, that
men who seemed to be slowly yet sure-
ly dying of wasting lung affections, j
and women with broken-down nervous ;
systems and wrecked and shattered i
frames, apparently beyond the reach of j
help, were restored to activity and
strength?"
No, it was not a miracle except as
nature herself is miraculous when her
forces are guided and brought to bear
by one who has studied them through
a long life-time of experience, and
learned to interpret hermarvelousman-
lfestations and adapt them to human
reeds. Dr. Pierce, the discoverer of
this unparalleled medicine, has been for
thirty years a graduate physician and
educated specialist in diseases of the
nutritive system. It was the result of
careful, patient, scientific research, and
no haphazard finding, that this extra-
ordinary "Discovery" was brought to
light, f"r the benefit and rescue of
mankind.
What does it do? How does it do
It? Let the first question be answered
by the facts. Let those speak who
ki.ow.
Think of a man, father of a family,
with work to do in this world; full of
hone and courage and ambition, sud-
denly discovering that the health on
which he had depended as the basis of
all his hopes : id achievements in life,
Is beginning to desert him and leave
him a weakened, powerless, inefficient
creature, Incapable of going forth like
a man to his daily toil, bound down
and faster.' d as it were by chains of
disease that cannot be shaken off.
This man is an actual character. Let
him tell hi own story:
Mr. John Brooks of Boylston, "Wor-
cester County, Mass. (Sawyer's Mills),
writes: "I feel it my duty now to write
to you to tell you of the great benefit I
have received. About a year ago I was
taken with a bad cc-ld which settled on
my lungs. The doctors said I was in
consumption and could not get well. I
took Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil and it
did me no good. After taking it four
months I heard of your 'Golden Med-
ical Discovery' and wrote to you for ad-
vlcf* I have taken your medicine and
Very seldom have better hares been
seen running for life and liberty in the
lead of fast hounds, and a feature of
the day was the pleasure stamped on the
faces of the ladies when a same little
representative of the great sand dunes
of Fresno baffled its pursuers by making
the escape at the far end of the beauti
ful coursing field.
In the course between Pretender and
Premier the last named dog sold at 1 to 6,
but succeeded in making a no course.
Pretender got the run up and turn, then
Premier got in for a turn and a kill. In
the run-off Pretender won a fairly easy
victory.
In the third course the talent met with
Its first upset. Lissak, a 1 to 2 shot, de
feated Eclipse rather havidily. True, t.e
hare favored Lissak after â¢â '* first turn,
but the old dog ran very strong and won
a clean course. "
Favorites won coin for those who
played long odds until the fourteenth
course, when The Turk, a short-ender.
disposed of the fast Eclipse in a sharp
and hotly contested course. s
Grazer, who was well played on the
short end, lowered the colors of Sports
man in a race that was won by a very
small margin. , , . i .
Some wild bets were made during the
day. Flying Buck was played with a high
hand by some of his admirers, wno
stacked up twenty b;g dollars to win a
lone hog.
Terrona. one of the prospective win
ners of the stake, was backed very
strongly. Some of those "he can't loose
gamblers put up $25 to win $1. but they
were right, nevertheless, in their calcula-

it saved my life. 1 felt so sick when I
wrote to you that I thought I would not
live the winter through. In the morn-
Ing I raised an awful lot and would spit
all the time and had pains in my chest.
My bowels would not move more than
once or twice a week; my strength was
nearly gone; I could not do a whole
day's work. Now, my bowels are regu-
lar every day and I feel no more pain in
my chest. Feel a great deal stronger.
I am working hard every day, driving a
team in the woods, and I owe my t". anks
to Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discov-
ery. I know it saved my life. I cannot
praise it enoueh. I am proud to tell
my friends what cured me."

is ripe for almost any disease that hap-
' pens along. His entire constitution is

S spring medicines.
"It affords me pleasure to testify to
the remarkable curative power of Dr.
Pierced Golden Medical Discovery,"
writes Mr. Frank A. Startz of Fayette-
ville, Fayette County, Texas. "I was
severely afflicted with trouble in my
lungs, spitting up blood, and was so
weak I was unable to continue my
work. I tried several remedies which
gave me no relief, and I had com-
menced to think there was no hope for
me. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis-
covery was recommended to me, so I
tried it and began to improve at once,
and was soon able to resume work. I
consider it a wonderful medicine. You
are at liberty to use my name if you
desire."
Think of a woman who longs to be a
source of help and encouragement to
her husband and children; who feels
that her usefulness in life, her power
for good, her attractiveness, in fact,
her very womanliness itself depends
upon a cheerful, capable, healthful con-
st itu;.- n. finding all these things grad-
ually "bbing away; and she a nervous,
frotful. worn-out, despairing wreck of
what should be a happy woman.
This picture is indeed a true portrait;
bphold it painted in the colors of actual
life by the woman herself, who suf-
fered:
"1 write to let you know the great j
benefit I have received from your mcdi- i
i cine and the self-treatment at home j
which you advised for my case," writes !
; Mrs. W. M. Satterly, of Richford, Tioga i
Co., N. V., (P. O. Box 40). "When I
first wrote to you I was completely dis-
couraged. Was in pain all the time. i
i could not lie in bed on account of se- !

the fact that Flying Buck and Mercy
May are both the property of E. V. Sul
livan, and will be consequently guarded.
Although Lissak is chosen to defeat Syl
via, the race should be very close, but
Lissak's performance on yesterday was
truly good. Another close race should
result when Van Needa and Firm Friend
meet in the slips, but with a good hare
the last named dog should win.
Possibly the hottest race of the day will
be witnessed when Sweet Lips and Moun
tain Beauty meet. If a good slip is made
it will be either dog's race until game
is killed.
On form, one of the three named dogs
should win the stake, viz: Firm Friend,
Flying Buck or Mountain Beauty.

what I have suffered in silence no liv-
ing person would believe me, for it
seems no woman could stand such mis-
ery and still bear children. Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription is a boon to wo-
man."
These are but few out of many
thousands. And now, how is it that
after countless other remedies and doc-
tors beyond naming for number, have
unitedly failed, this unexampled "Dis-
covery" reaches and masters such ap-
parently hopeless diseases?
Because it goes, straight as an ar-
row, to its mark, directly to those
points In the nutritive system where
life itself begins. Because it has the
peculiar property of giving digestive
power to the stomach, purifying ca-
pacity to the liver, blood-making force
to the assimilative glands, flesh-mak-
ing, tissue-building, muscle-hardening,
strength to every organ In the entire
physical economy.
It is the natural, reasonable obvi-
ous result of Nature herself working
along her own chosen channels, yet
guided by trained, scientific intelli-
gence. Doctor Pierce has a born faith
in Nature which few physicians have.
His education, his life-long experience
and profound study have taught him
what few physicians ever learn, that
Nature herself stands ready with the
remedy for every ill, and the man who
intelligently combines these forces will
accomplish what can never be achieved
by man alone.
It was this faith, this Intelligence,
this combination of Nature with sci-
ence; of therapeutics with brains â that
resulted in the most remarkable "Med-
ical Discovery" which ever blessed
mankind.
This same elemental genius, rising
superior to mere stereotyped profes-
sionalism, has guided its possessor to
discover and achieve in the field of
medicine more, it is safe to say, than
any other one physician of modern
times. "That man is one of the best
men In the world," President Garfleld
once said, speaking of Dr. Pierce, with
whose great work the President was
acquainted. "And he is at the head of
one of the best medical institutions in
the world," added the President.
Hardly any one at all conversant
with medical affairs needs to be told
that the Invalids' Hotel .and Surgical
Institute, of Buffalo, N. V.. is the
grandest model sanitarium of this
country. Dr. Pierce has been its chief
consulting physician for over thirty
years. He is surrounded by a staff of
nineteen eminent specialists, each fore-
most in his particular field of practice,
and comes into consultation daily over
the most obstinate chronic cases of
every description, either of patients
staying at the Institute or under treat-
ment by mail.
Any sick or invalid person in any
part of the United States may obtain
advice by mail absolutely free ofcharge
by simply writing to Dr. R. V. Pierce,
Buffalo, N. V., a plain statement of the
case. All letters are preserved in the
most inviolable confidence and never
published, except by the writer's spe-
cial wish and permission. Careful pro-
fessional advice will be sent without
charge, and suggestions for sensible
self-treatment will be given in any case
where that is practicable.
"I wish to express my sincere thanks
to you and your co-workers," writes
Mr. A. D. Weller of Pensacola, Escam-
bia Co., Fla., Box 544. "I have, since
receiving your dicgnosis of my case, as
stomach trouble and liver complaint,
taken eight bottles of the 'Golien Medi-
cal Discovery,' and must say that I am
transformed from a walking shadow
(as my friends called me) to perfect
health. I value your remedies very
highly and take pleasure in recom-
mending them to any and all who suf-
fer as I did. Four monl s ago I did
not think to be in shape to assist our
'Uncle Samuel,' in case of hostilities,
but thanks to you, I am ready for the
'Dagos.' "
The great illustrated medical library,
in one-thousand page volume, entitled
"The People's Common Sense Medical
Adviser." compiled and edited by Dr.
Pierce in the course of his professional
experience, will be sent free in paper
covers, for 21 one-cent stamps, to pay
the cost of mailing only. Or in heavier,
handsomer cloth binding for 31 stamps.
It is the most complete, sensible and
practical medical work for popular
reading ever published, and has had a
greater sale than any medical work in
any language. Over 730,000 copies
were sold at $1 50 each. The profit on
this sale was sufficient to make Dr.
Pierce feel warranted in issuing a free
edition. Only one copy will be sent to
one family, and every family in this
country ought to have it in their
library."
yesterday. The splendid weather of the
past few days was probably an important
factor in the case, but the card which had
been drawn for the run-down was made
up of some of the best dog flesh on this or
any other coast.
The long odds book is a hard game, as
many winners of yesterday's courses
look to have more than even chances for
the money when the final is declared to
day. Patria seems to rule favorite in the
book, 2Va being offered to win, with no
place money. But there are others in the
race who may fool the wise ones. Mialmo
is stiil on deck in splendid form, and the
races heretofore run by the fleet one may
account for a point or two in the finals
to-day. Connemara is also looking well,
as is Gladiator.
Some new arrangements for slipping
hares have been made and now it is nec
essary that they and the hounds pass
the grand stand when starting. The hares
are placed at a disadvantage, as they
ali start for the old escapes, out as they
have been changed to the tar end of the
field and to the left of the former place
very few escaped, but it is thought they
will find the place of refuge atter they
have been turned out a day or two for ex
ercise.
Jimmy Anthony's Statesman ran a
clever course in the sapling stake, but
went down to Hether Dell. The form
players had everything their own way, as
but two or three short-enders took the
money. T. J. Cronln's Trinket was the
"fooler" of the day, and for a time sold
on the short end, but a rumor soon spread
that the hound, although from the coun
try, was a world beater, and in conse
quence the money went that way. The
ties to-day will without doubt prove a
surprise to some, and it is believed a
short-ender will win the money for the
final.

SOUGHT FRIENDS
AND FOUND DEATH
Helen Stack's Body Discovered
Floating in the Bay Near
Belvedere.
She Hired a Boat to Row From
Tiburon and Was Never Again
Seen Alive.
When the 1:10 boat from San Francisco
arrived at the Tiburon slip yesterday aft
ernoon it carried among its passengers
a young, happy girl, who, full of pleas
urable anticipations, had gone over to
make one of a jolly party of picnickers.
Ere the boat started on its return to the
city this same happy girl had become a
bit of derelict humanity drifting hither
and thither on the waters of the bay, an
Inanimate plaything for the sport of each
eddy, that, circling around it with a rip
ple uf cruel laughter, went whirling on its
way.
As Pamby de Salle, the owner of the !
San Kranscisco boat house at Tiburon, I
was sitting on his float yesterday he was
approached by a young lady whom he
recognized as Helen Stack, the 20-year-old
daughter of J. T. Stack, formerly mana
ger of the G. W. Clark Paper Company.
Miss Stack informed De Salle that she
wished to hire a boat with accommoda
tions for four people, as sne was going
over to Belvedere to meet some friends
with whom she intended to picnic. De
Salle furnished the boat, and after watch
ing Miss Stack depart returned to his
work, paying no more attention to the
boat or its occupant, as he knew Miss
Stack and was aware that she could not
only manage a pair of oars like an ex
pert but was an accomplished swimmer
as well.
About three-quarters of an hour after
ward chancing to look over toward Bel
vedere Point, De Salle saw the boat float
ing around witnout any person in it, and
thinking that it had been moored on the
Belvedere shore and had broken loose he
called William Fishbone, a neighboring
boatman, and the two started over to
gether to get it.
Upon arriving alongside the boat they
found It empty and with one oar missing.
Looking around to see If they could ciiri
cover the oar they saw the body of Miss
Stack floating lace downward on the
water about a hundred yards from the
boat and about fin-- yards from the miss
ing oar, which was between the body and
the boat.
They at once took the body out of the
water, and hastening to the shore t.ied
by every known means to resuscitate it.
but it was no useâ life had been too long
extinct.
Coroner Eden of San Rafael was tele
phoned to, and coming down on the next
train he notiiled the girl's parents, who
live at the corner of Durant and Bowdltch
avenues In Berkeley, and took the body
to San Rafael to await their arrival.
\\ hen picked up the boat and body
were both about 300 yards off Belvedere
Point. A curious circumstance was that
though Miss Stack was very well known
in Belvedere and Tiburon, her family
having once resided at the former place,
no one could be found with whom she
had engaged to go rowing or picnicking,
nor could- any one be found who even
expected to receive a call from her. Even
her family did not know she was on the
Maun County shore until notified of her
death, as when she left home they sup
posed she was merely bent on a shopping
tour in the city.
When the boat was found It was In
perfect order, right side up, and there
was not a drop of water in its bottom.
SAN RAFAEL. April 23.â J. T. Stack,
father of Miss Helena Stack, who was
drowned this afternoon in the bay near
Tiburon, came up from that point on
the late train this evening. He was ac
companied by Joseph O'Connor, principal
of the Horace Mann Grammar School,
and Mr. McGovern. The whole party at
once went to the Morgue, where tne re
mains of the dead girl lay. The ap
pearance of the distracted father was
touching in the extreme. His hands
trembled, his face was blanched and pale
and his lips quivered, and as he stood by
the bier the tears poured from his eyes
while he uttered broken expressions of
endearment.
Speaking for the grief-striken father.
Principal O'Connor inquired when the
remains could be taken away, and was
informed that this could probably be
done to-morrow morning as soon as a
jury could be impaneled and an inquest
held. The party then returned to the
broad-gauge depot, but learning that the
last train had departed they decided to
remain here for the inquest
Sermon by Father Wyman.

PATRIOTISM AT
RECREATION PARK
Stirring Musio and Flag Rais
ing Creates Much
Enthusiam.
Oaklands and Stocktons Play
Snappy Game In a Worthy
Causa.
The spark of enthusiasm that smolders
in the breast of the American was fanned
Into a flame of patriotic enthusiasm when
the stirring strains of the Third United
States Artillery band were carried by the
gentle breeze over the Recreation
grounds, at Eighth and Harrison streets,
yesterday.
Seated In the grand stand was a fair
gathering of men, women and children,
and as the tuneful marcnes were being
played their cheeks became suffused with
a warm flush of patriotic ardor. The
conclusion of each piece brought forth
a burst of enthusiasm which lasted many
minutes. The raising of the flag in cen
ter field was a fitting climax to the oc
casion.
It was a matter of regret that there
were so many counter attractions yes
terday, as it affected the attendance at
tie park. In view of the worthy object
that was to be attained, a larger gatner
l ing was looked for. At any rate, a neat
sum will be forthcoming to the families
or the brave boys of the First Regiment,
who have gone to the front in their coun
try s defense.
The spectators were treated to an ex
cellent exhitiitiun of the national game,
fatockton and Oakland were the contend
ing teams, and tor an hour and thirty
live minutes played the snappiest kind
of ball.
Oakland took the lead In run getting
and continued piling up runs to tne end
of the contest, while the Stockton team,
try as it would, could not land a tally
until the sixth inning. In their last time
at bat, they managed to break the spell
that hung over them throughout the
game X and five runs were adaed, saving
them from a bad defeat.
The Athenians had an easy time In
landing on Feige's curves, and it was only I
the good work of Rice In center field that j
saved him. The latter went after every- |
thing that came into his territory, and
that of the outfielders, and by fast run
ning managed to retire many safe hits.
Billings and White were afflicted with
a very bad case of fumbles, which cost
the Stocktons dear. Selna proved himself
a tower of strength to his team, both
at bat and In the Held.
That "Infant Prodigy," Lou Hardy,
seems to become younger at each suc
ceeding game. The way he went after
an impossible fly and gathered it in would
have astounded any of his old-time
friends, who think Lou Is getting old. At
the bat he Is a gem. Out of three times
up, he landed on the sphere for a double
and two long singles at times when they
were most needed. When Peters had
hurt his already sore finger, Lou took his
place behind the bat, and reminded old
timers of the days when he caught for
the Haverlys.
Lange, another old-timer, covered him
self with glory by accepting six difficult
chances without an error. One of his
plays, a Jerry Denny pick-up, earned
him a great ovation. Moskiman pitched
a fine game up to the time Peters was
hurt. He seemed to mi^s him, and be- !
came nervous, and the Stocktons landed
on him for keeps. For eight innings but
three hits were gotten off his delivery,
and only two men were given their base
on balls.

CENTRAL PARK.
Santa Cruz had a veritable tapioca yes
terday with the lately strengthened V?an
Francisco aggregation. For nine innings
the "Beachcombers" toyed with Manner
Coffroth's "colts," rolling up in that time
eighteen tallies. Had not "Southpaw"
Daubenbis' sight failed him at the begin
ning of the game, it would have oeen
barely possible for the losing team to
make a showing. Five men were handed
free passages to first, and the same num
ber, assisted by a lone hit and a rotund
error, marched across the plate, with
thoughts of easy victory. They were
doomed to disappointment, however, for
Daubenbis oiled his "southpaw," cleared
the "cobwebs" from his eyes and pitched
in splendid form.
Little Charley Drews, the clever back
stop for San Francisco, was compelled to
quit early In the game. While trying to
put "auburn-haired" "Bill" Devereux out
at the plate both players collided, and
Drews had his shoulder badly wrenched
as for Devereux he was unhurt.
Charley Sweeney of old-time fame held
down the initial bag for San Francisco in
clever style and made jome timely hit*.
Kelly at third won the hearts of the
spectators by running from his position
to the players' bench and nailing a dim
cult foul fly. It Is needless to say that
he got an ovation. Stulz also distin
guished himself by making some one
handed pickups and retiring the runner.
Santa Cruz played its usual good Hold
ing game. Besides being strong batters
the team shows itself to advantage on
the bases.

The Red Cross Society Seeks to Do Away With All
the Barbarities of War.
Miss Clara Barton, the Organizer and Director ot the League.
WASHINGTON, April 23.â Miss Clara Barton, president of the Red Cross Society, arrived from New-
York this morning, and to The Call correspondent expressed hearty gratification and approval of the
purpose of the people of San Francisco to organize a sar.itary commission for relief work on the field. Miss
Barton said there was ample reason and opportunity for relief work in Cuba now, and In the near
future especially would this be the case upon the occupation of Cuba by United States troops. When
asked if her consent was necessary to organize a sanitary commission for this purpose Miss Barton re
plied:
"The Red Cross Society has no monopoly of charity. The organizing: of such a commission and the
relief work It would accomplish would be gladly welcomed and appreciated by the Red Cross Society and
by the lovers of humanity everywhere. The work of the proposed organization would In no way conflict
with the operations of our society. On the contrary, at the scene of our common efforts there would be
the most cordial co-operation. Let me suggest to the San Francisco people through The Call (as a friend
ly precaution) that their commission be organized under the name of the Red Cross Society. Possible legal
complications will thus be avoided, in view of the legal recognition of the Red Cross Society in the coun
tries of the world.
"Present my greetings to The Call and the patriotic and humane poople of San Francisco and assure
them of my best wishes for the success of the work they shall undertake." f
Mips Barton expressed her belief that notwithstanding the report that Secretary Alger and the sur
geon-general had decided not to employ women in the field or hospital service in Cuba they would sooner or
later yield to a popular demand that they be admitted to work in a sphere of usefulness for which they are
so peculiarly fitted.
TO-MORROW at 9:30 o'clock the '
committee that has been called
by Governor Budd will meet at
the California Hotel and perfect
organization of the Sanitary Com
mission and the Red Cross League of
California. Major-General Barrett Is

on the organizing committee to as-

mittee were:

FOOD COFFEE.
MAY TOUCH YOU.
A Way to Drink in the Divine Sen-
sation.
When you read this article think
about yourself and not some one else. !
The journal 'Life and Health" says, ,
"Among the more common evil eli'ects
â¢which result from the use of tea or
coffee are dyspepsia, nervousness, Sn-
Bomnia, hea'uhe (especially sick
headache), bil iousness, palpitation of
the heart, abnormal action of the liver
aril constipation." Does n common
sense appeal to you to leave off the
drugs (tea and coffee) and again drink
In the Divine sensation of perfect,
bounding health?
Hard to quit?
Have Postum Food Coffee served in
place of the regular and in 10 days
you will find coming back the old feel-
Ing of strength and phvs.cal peace
that makes life worth the living.
This liquid food is made of selected
parts of the cereals that go directly to
rebuild the broken down nerve centers
In brain and all through the human
body, making a strong heart and
Btomach, steady nerves and t'^ar com-
plexion.
Packages at grocers 15 & 25 centa.
William Alvord, Bank of California
R. J. Tobin, Hibernia Bank.
There Is work already cut out for the
organization. The volunteers that will
be called out from California will re
quire much In the way of medical
equipment. Ambulances for use on the
field will be wanted at once. There will
also be needed many cases of surgical
instruments for use In the field, and
others for the equipment of the hospi
tals that will have to be established
when the soldiers get to the front.
There will be a thousand and one other
things that will be required for th â¢
care and comfort of the sick and
wounded, and no one but those for
whom the brave boys went to the front
to fight can supply them. The medical
department of the army supplies and
supplies liberally the actual necessaries
of the hospitals, but it does not give
the many delicacies and strength giv
ing foods that only those who have
been ill know how to appreciate. Then
as the war goes on and the sick and
wounded increase more nurses will be
required, and they will have to be fur
nished and supported. Organization
cannot be made too quickly, and when
it is done let the whole State stand
ready to do its share and more of the
humanitarian work. That can only be
done by an organization so complete
that it can respond for all that is called
for at a moment's notice.
The managers of the Orpheum have
been the first to help the proposed or
ganization in a practical way. A mati
nee performance will be given at the
order of the Red Cross League of Cali
fornia, and any one who knows the
Orpheum knows what that means.
INDORSE THE CAUSE.
The Epworth League Will
Hoist the Red Cross
Flag.
The members of the Epworth League,
both local and visiting, are patriotic
as well as zealous in the cause of
Christ. They have taken great inter
est in The Call's movement regarding
the Red Cross Society and to a man
are willing to indorse any movement
which will benefit the organization and
are even willing to send men to the
front if the necessity presents itself.
To-night at the grand rally or mass
meeting in the Metropolitan Temple,
when the closing exercises of the con
ference will be held, the matter of the
Ked Cross League will be taken up and
In all probability a committee formed
to carry on the work of strengthening
the relief organization.
Rev. Dr. W. \V. Case, presiding elder
of the San Francisco district, stated
last evening that the work under way
was a splendid undertaking and a thor
ough organization should at once be
completed. "It has always been suc
cessful," he said, "and there is no rea
'. hy all should not lend their aid to
the good work."
Charles H. Jacob, chairman of the
Reception Committee, gives his hearty
approval to the work and is of the opin
ion Â£hat over one-half of the members
present in the city would be willing to
join hands with those who have taken
up the work.

PRIDE OF THE AMERICAN NAVY.
The battleship "Oregon" is one of the best fighters in the American navy. She is manned
by a crew which is capable of doing credit to the ship, and when the conflict is at its height the
gallant lads on the "Oregon" can be depended upon to fight. There is not a man among them who
will weaken in the heat of battle, for they are men prepared to wage war with anything human.
During the recent visit of the ship to this port the strong appearance of the men was remarked by
thousands. They are men of nerve, full of the strength and vigor of manhood.
On board the "Oregon" there are over fifty men who have in their possession Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt, the grand nerve-builder. Here is a recent letter from one of them: "San Francisco,
March 2, 1898. Dr. Sandenâ Dear Sir: I received your Belt the first part of last month, with
Electric Suspensory. I have worn it as directed and am pleased to say that its effect is grand. I
now have all my natural strength. Yours truly, Will H. Goddard, U. S. S. 'Oregon.'
Over 10,000 men have been restored to manhood by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt. It fills
the body with life and vim. It restores all the healthy vigor of youth, removing the effects of
exposure, excesses, etc. If you need it send for Dr. Sanden's book, "Three Classes of Men,"
with full information about it, free.

who have banded together In behalf of
religious teachings are of the opinion
that when the matter is laid before
them this evening at the grand closing
exercises, enthusiasm will be broueht
to such a pitch that many will at once
start to aid the work and carry on a
humanitarian movement which will
tend to alleviate those who may be
w<^- " " while fighting for the coun
try and her honor. At any rate they
state that the flag should be upheld
and those who defend her should re
ceive the attention of men and women
alike.
Hopeful Sign of the Time.
The growth of humanitarian senti
ment in the world Is a hopeful sign
of the time. Nothing but words of the
highest praise can be given. AH the
civilized world unites In commending
the Red Cross League. The Christian
church, particularly, will give it warm
est support. If war must come, let
us alleviate its horrors as much as pos
sible. The Epworth League wishes
Red Cross work God speed and will
render heartiest co-operation, and have,
no doubt, many workers at the front.
E. P. DENNETT,
President Conference Epworth League.
Hope the Work Will Go On.
Rev. C. E. Locke, D.D., said: "I be
lieve in the mercy side of conflict and
heartily indorse any movement to carry
on the work. I would be glad to assist
in any definite organization and hope
the good work will go on which may al
leviate the sufferings of those who may
fall at the country's call."
A RED CROSS SOCIETY.
BERKELEY, April 23.â At the resi
dence of Colonel Greenleaf on Bancroft
way a Red Cross Society was formed.
Mrs. Colonel Greenleaf was elected
president and Mrs. George B. Hatch
secretary. The society was organized
for the purpose of sending nurses to
the front and preparing bandages for
the wounded soldiers. They will meet
again to-morrow and complete ar
rangements for their work.

"When the transcript of thÂ« testimony |

OAKLAND, April 23.â For the past three
days Joseph Hoffman, a widower, living
alone at 956 Campbell street, has been
missing. When last seen he was in a sa
loon, but made no complaint of fetsrtng
poorly. This morning a neighbor. Con
Sheehan, decided to investigate and forced
an entrance to the house. On entering
the bedroom Hoffman was found in his
bed dead. From all appearances Hoffman
must have dted the nicht he was last
seen. It is believed that death resulted
from heart trouble. The deceased was a
native of Germany, fifty-five years of age.
Mr. Foot? Improving.
OAKLAND, April 23.â Attorney W. W.
Footo, who has been seriously 111, was
sufficiently recovered this afternoon to
leave his home and take a short outing.
His complete recovery is now regarded as
certain.
School Summer Vacation.
OAKLAND, April 23.â The public schools
close June 3 for seven weeks. The High
School fund is sufficient to pay the nec
essary expenses till then, while the
Grammar School fund will have a good
sized balance.
"HOW WILL I
EVER FOLLOW"
The Motto Which Is Being
Carried Out by the
Epworth League.
Second Day's Session Proves
as Successful as the
Opening.
It Is Proposed to Hold Another
Annual Convention and Crowds
Are Expected.
The second day's session of the Epworth
League in the Howard-street Church was
a repetition, so far as success is con
cerned, of the opening day. From early
morn until late at night the prettily deco
rated place of worship was crowded to
the doors and patriotic speeches, which
were interminKled with relicious bless
ings, were again heard.
It is hard for an outsider to determine
who receives the most attenion from the
audience, as each speaker is greeted with
a round of applause. The morning ser
vice opened with song, led by O. E. Holte.
followed by expression of thanks to the
Almighty by many present for religious
blessings. Robert Husband, musical di
rector, presided at the organ and many
hymns were sung under his direction.
The first paper of the morning was read
by Mrs. Inez Randolph on "Our Interme
diates." The subject was also discussed
by members of the convention. President
Dennett was of the opinion that the great
trouble often experienced with young peo
ple was the fact that an attempt was
often made to stuff an adult's religion
down a youngster's throat.
Mrs. Etta B. Lloyd spoke on "The Ju
niors and the Church," and was followed
by Rev. E. L. Thompson, who gs>.ve his
views regarding "Some Difficulties and
Some Dangers of Our League." This sub
ject was also discussed by many of the
members of the society, who were fol
lowed by Miss Frances Healy on the sub
ject, "Mercy and Help." Professor Hunt
spoke strongly against indiscriminate
charity, and Dr. Bartley thought the or
phan asylums needed considerable atten
tion.
1 "The Social Department" was deftly
handled by Miss Kate Ames prior to a
meeting of the various districts to elect
oflicers for the coming year. A commit
tee was appointed to endeavor to have
the next meeting of the board of control
held in this city. Then the election of of
licers was held. In the San Francisco
district C. B. Perkins was elected pres
ident; Miss Libby Gumming, first vice
president; George Erhart, second vice
president; Miss Fanny Johnson, third
vice-president; E. C. Hurlburt, corrs
sponding secretary; R. J. Coyne, treas
urer; Mrs. Nellie Hanson, superintendent
of junior work; Miss E. J. Dorrin, super
intendent of intermediate work.
In the Napa district B. Hutchinson was
elected president; Harriet Mcc, secretary;
Mary L. Dickson, first vice-president;
Miss Carrie Williams, second vice-presi
dent; Miss Alice M. Humphreys, third
vice-president; Miss Laura Bell, fourth
vice-president. In the Oakland district
W. H. Young was elected president; L.
L. Dennett, first vice-president; W. C.
Mayne, secretary and treasurer.
The treasurer's report of the league
was received and ordered inscribed in the
permanent records. The continuance of
the statistics system was recommended to
the district cabinet. Professor Hunt, Dr.
Beard and Rev. Mr. Cole were appointed
to form a directory of statistics. A sec
ond annual conference will be held next
year, and an invitation has been received
from Santa Cruz for the district conven
tion of 1599, which has been accepted.
The deficits in the fund for the past two
years have been made up and the organ
ization is now on a good financial basis.
The second conference on junior work
was held by Mrs. Buck, and in the after
noon the members visited Golden Gate
Park and other places of amusement.
In the evening interesting addresses
were delivered by President E. McCllsh on
"The Intellectual Life of Leaguers" and
by Rev. C. E. Locke, D.D., on "The Spir
itual Life of Leaguers."
Sunrise prayer meetings will be held
this mornip and in the evening the con
vention will be closed with a mass meet
ing at the Metropolitan Temple.
The Week's Amusements.
OAKLAND, April 23.â Oakland Park,
formerly Blairs Park, will be formally
opened on Sunday with a gTand concert
and exhibition of trained animals. It is
now under the management of fho Oak
land Transit Company.
"A Stranger in New York!" one of
Hoyt's latest comedies, will be the at
traction at tho Mncdonough Theater on

doubtedly have a crowded house "Wednes
day evening at the Maodonough Theater.
It Is a prime favorite with lovers of good
music

give an entertainment and dance on
Tuesday evening in Lorin Hall.

a survivor of -the battle of Shiloh, will

torium of the Y. M. C. A. building on
Thursday and Friday evenings apd Satur
day afternoon, assisted by Jean de Chau
venet, a violinist.
Stone Was Released.
OAKLAND, April 23.-The charge
against A. L. Stone, for failure to keep
Broadway In repair at the erosslne of
Thirteenth street, was dismissed by
Judge Allen this morning, as the place
had been fixed. Tn rendering his derision
Judge Alien snid the railway officials
should not have been brought into court.
He believed that the other two compa
nies usinE the street should have been
made equal defendants.
Seconds the Commission.
BERKELEY, April 23.-Rev. D. J
Pierce pastor of the Baptist Church,
heartily agrees with Rev. Dr. Coyle that
it Is the duty of ministers not to foment
strife, but to pour oil on the troubled
waters. Since all cannot fight, it is the
duty of those who do not. to engage in
works of peace and mercy. This can
be accomplished by nursing the sick and
wounded, regardless of race. To effect
this more thoroughly a sanitary commis
sion should be formed, and In conjunc
tion with the Red Cross great good could
be accomplished. This should be the true
Christian spirit and should be mani
fested by all followers of Christ.

Ex-Treasurer Widber robbed the city
of $117,083 79, barring a few cents or
dollars, more or less, for errors and
omissions. The commission, including
Mayor Phelan, Auditor Broderick and
Judge Troutt, together with Chief
Lees, Chief Deputy de la Montanya
and a representative of the Surety
Company that is on Widber's bond,
concluded the work of counting the
money in the Treasurer's vaults at 5
o'clock last evening, with the result
given above.
While the police pension fund suffers
to the extent of nearly $1200, the school
teachers' annuity and retirement fund
remains intact. This is a special fund
raised by deducting a certain amount
from the salaries of the teachers each
month, and is in the custody of a spe
cial commission, consisting of the
Mayor, Treasurer and Superintendent
of Schools, the Treasurer being cus
todian of the funds, keeping them in
his own name. Friday night, after the
investigators had failed to find but
$6295 credited to this fund, Mayor Phe
lan visited Widber in the County Jail
and ascertained that the money was
intact, $4000 being deposited in the
Hlbernia Bank and $618 in the German
Bank. Widber gave Phelan an order
for these two deposits, and yesterday
morning the Mayor recovered the
money.
Secretary Godchaux of the Board of
Health is not so fortunate. He had
$1137 belonging to the Board of Health
deposited in the Treasurer's vault un
der his own name, and Widber has
made away with all of it. The ex-
Treasurer, however, says he considers
it a debt of honor and will make it good
to Godchaux.
The Board of Supervisors met again
yesterday morning and elected Chris
tian Reis Treasurer. Mayor Phelan
presided, and Supervisors Devany,
Haskins, Sheehan, Dodge, Lackmann,
Morton, Britt, Smith and Rivers were
in attendance. The Mayor ordered a
ballot on Reis and Martin, the two
candidates, and it resulted, as on the
preceding evening, six for Reis and
three for Martin, Lackmann, Morton
and Smith, the three Republican mem
bers, voting for Martin.
Sheehan moved that a recess of fif
teen minutes be taken, but the Mayor
suggested that another ballot be taken
before recess.
Before the vote Supervisor Lackmann
made the following statement:
"I find the members of the board are
unwilling to admit the force of my ar
gument that a Republican should be
elected to succeed a Republican. The
result being then a foregone conclusion
I do not feel that I ought to stand in
the way of an election, and therefore
having done my duty as a Republican,
I will change my vote in favor of Mr.
Reis."
The roll was then called and Lack
mann voted with the six Democrats,
giving Reis the seven votes necessary
to elect. Morton moved to make Reis'
election unanimous, which was done.
Later in the day the new Treasurer
took the oath of office and then watch
ed the count of the money in the vault.
An agent of the same surety company
that is on Wldber's bond asked Mr.
Reis to appoint his company as his
bondsman. Mr. Reis promptly re
plied:
"I will <3o so with great pleasure if
Mr. Widber's bond is made good
promptly." Reis will not file his bond
until Monday.

I havp a friend, in fact he is my brother-in-law, who is the outside
man for a New York crockery warehouse, a sort of salesman, purchas-
ing agent, collector and what not. He used to suffer from a catarrh
of the stomach. When he woke in the morning there would be a
gripping, a contraction, a tightness of the stomach, whic<h, he said,
seemed to be clogged with a slimy, phlegm-like substance. Carlsbad
salts always did him some good, but now he uses a Ripans Ta-bule. He
only takes one when occasion requires, just one now and then. When
this man, his name is Scalding, was asked to describe the effect of the
Tabule on him, he Mid : " Why, it brightens me up. It has an effect

Ed Corrigan Lost Hurly Burly Out of
â¢ Selling RÂ»5e â Five Favor
ites First.
The special attraction offered race
goers to Ingleside track yesterday was
the California steeplechase worth $700
to the winning horse, over the full
course. It was not a very exhilarat
ing affair, for Reno, ridden by f^or.^e
Cophran, took the head at the start, j
and fencing like a deer, never gave his !
backers fear fur discomfiture, winning 'â 
cleverly at the end from Governor
Budd, and reducing the record for the !
distance fifteen seconds. There werÂ«i
but three other starters â Silverado, Es- j
perance and Our Climate â and they
were a ragged assortment. The latter
took the obstacles in clumsy fashion,
finally coming to grief at the final
jump. The winner was backed from !
2 to 1 to even money.
The layers of prices hit up agnin^t
the sharpest crowd of visitors that
have assembled at the track in a cou
ple of moons. Five of six favorites
led their fields out, and the majority
rowd had their checks strung
that way. Lena, the one outsider to i
win, with post odds of 15 to 1 chalked
about her, was not overlooked either.
Cromwell, the place horse in the same
v> as also heavily backed all three
at long odds.
The last race of the day was the
"class" number of the card, Briar i
t, May \V, Rubicon and Morinel ,
ting in a seven-furlong jaunt. Briar
with Clawson in the saddle, i
: a 1 to - favorite, receded to 6 |
to 5, " i en the bipr coin forced her odds |
Ito 5. She led from the start, j
and ri'i i-'n out at the end, downed the
weakly ridden May W, a scant length
in l:26Vi, equaling the track record.
Rubicon was third, but a neck away.
In the opening four-furlong dash for ]
two-year-olds, the Ingleside record for
th> distance was reduced from :49 to
4y4 y: * by Toluca, the S to 5 favorite, rid
y Piggott. The filly did not
win. though, without an argument, for
I'anac", a daughter of Imp. Creighton.
had Piggott hard at work through the
stretch, and was only beaten out half
a length. Sweet Cakes was third.
Another event for two-years followed
over Jour and a half furlongs. The
Burns & Waterhouse pair. Obsidian
and Polka, ruled favorites in the bet
ting at 7 to 5, with Ach and Santello
the next most fancied. Obsidian, with
Johnny Woods up, made the running
and at the wire downed Ach three
lengths in :85%. Master Lee, asoto 1
sh"!. took show honors in a drive.
Hurly Burly, with but ninety-seven
pounds in th<- saddle, looked the best of
the eight starters In the six-furlong sell- ;

With a trifle better piece of luck at the
outset Cromwell would undoubtedly have
come very close to winning:. He was
sandwiched between two of the other en
tries until afte.r the first turn was
rounded.
The way Reno shouldered his 154 pounds
was a revelation. In the past the geld- j

up. though.
Now that Obsidian has scored, the I
Stromboli youngster may run up to his j
work. In the past he has been a noto
rious "morning glory."
Garnet Ferguson undoubtedly has a
money-getter in Master I,ee, a full brother

DON'T WANT THE ZOO.
Lick-Wilmerding Improvement Club
Prefers Better Streets and School
Accommdations.
At a meeting of the Lick-Wilmerding
Improvement Club Friday a resolution
was Introduced by George W. Center. In
which it was set forth that the members
of the club, as also all taxpayers opposed
to the appropriation of the public funds
for the purpose of buying a tract of land
for a zoo at this time should be present
at the Supervisors' chambers next Mon
day to protest against the purchase of the
contemplated site.
The resolution was unanimously
adopted.
Official information from the Board of
Health was read, in which it was an
nounced that the swamps lying between
Channel, Kansas, Utah and Sixteenth
streets had been condemned and must be
Oiled in, in order to make tho locality
sanitary.
The Utah street grade was once more
discussed, and a committee, consisting of
J. M. Torren, J. E. Kip, F. W. Hillens, M.
Stewart, Q. Quast, W. W. Renall and G.
F. Lyons, was appointed to represent its
condition to the Supervisors.
MASKED MEN AT WORK.
Rob and Beat Japanese Nurserymen
in a Lonely Place Near Ingle-
side Coursing Park.
Last Thursday evening two masked
men with pistols in their hands entered
a Japanese nursery owned by I. Kayo and
P. Torri, at 146 Herald avenue, near the
Ingleside Coursing Park, and robbed them
of $18 and a nickel watch. The men were
ordered to throw up their hands, but Y.
Vta, who was In the building, did not
understand English, and in consequence
failed to obey the command. He was
severely beaten for his ignorance.
The three Japanese wt-re walked Into
a rear room, and while the taller of tho
two robbers kept them covered the other
went through them. After they left they
locked the door from the outside. The
police were given a good description of
the two guilty parties and hope to have
them In custody soon.
Precita Valley Club.
The bad sanitary condition of Precita
Valley, owing to the defects of its sewer
age was the theme of discussion at the
club meeting Frday night.
President Stephen A. Byrne of the Im
orovement club is lying ill with tynhoid
malaria superinduced by the miasmatic
Influence of the Potrero-avonue sewer,
which empties into the siviirap between

A GODSEND TO HUMANITY,
Ohioan Invents a Device That Is a Sure Cure for All Nervous Diseases, Rheumatism, Weakness
and All Forms of Constitutional Sickness. Those Who Have Used It Declare
It to Be the Most Remarkable Invigorant Ever Produced for
Man, Woman or Child,
A quick-witted individual from Toledo,
Ohio, has patented and placed on the mar-
ket a bath cabinet that will be of great
Interest to the sick and debilitated. It is
a sealed compartment in which one com-
fortably rests on a chair and, with only the
head outside, may have all the invigorat-
ing, cleansing and purifying effects of the
most luxurious Turkish bath, with none
of its dangers. inconveniences or enervat-
ing influences.

SHOWING CABINET IN USE.
A well-known physician in Hudson,
Mich., C. H. Colbath, M. D.. gave up his
practice to sell these bath cabinets, feel-
ing that they were to a very large extent
all that his patients need have to get well.
Another physician of Ligonier, Ind., Dr.
F. W. Black, has followed Dr. Colbath's
example, and he, too, devotes all his time
to-selling the bath cabinets.- Many re-
markable letters have been written to the
inventors from, those who have used the
cabinet, one of which, referring to
INFLAMMATORY RHEUMATISM
will be interesting to those "who suffer
with this dreaded â â¢ malady.
. Miss Nellie B. Hewitt, Caneadea, Alle-
gany County, N. V., writes: . "My mother

BALTIMORE, April 23.â Nichols and
McJames had a pitchers" battle to-day,
and the 3555 spectators were treated to
one of the fastest games seen here for a
long time. The fielding behind both
twirlers was for the most part of the
hair-raising order. Stohl, Long and Lowe
for the visitors, and Jennings, McGraw
and Demontreyvllle for the Orioles, par
ticularly distinguished themselves in the
field. Quinn was sent to the bat for
McJames in the ninth. Nichols Intention
ally gave him his base, and the troubles
of the latter began. A single and a hit
batsman tilled the corners, and Nichols
was clearly rattled. Kelly landed on a
straight and sent the two winning runs
home amid the greatest enthusiasm.

Again Heavily Fined.
W. A. Shepard, the employment agent,
appeared for sentence yesterday morning
before Judge Campbell on the charge of
ago. To-day she is around the house, the
swellings in her hand and arm gone, and
is getting perfectly well. Our doctor was
very much astonished, and says he will
recommend the cabinet." Quite a number
of others write in a similar strain, and
there seems to be no doubt but what the
long-sought-for means of curing rheuma-
tism, Bright's disease and all urinary af-
fections has been found. Others write of
various benefits, one of the principal ones
referring to the bath cabinet as
A FLESH REDUCER.
It Is Important to note that the Inven-
tors of the cabinet guarantee that flesh
will be reduced at the rate of five pounds
per week if the baths are taken regularly.
That is, of course, a good scientific reason
why the cabinet accomplishes the fact of
reducing flesh, and those points are well
brought out in a very instructive little
book Issued by the inventors. As a means
to
CURE SKIN DISEASES
the cabinet Is unquestionably the finest
thing in the world. People who have been
testing patent medicines, spring tonics
and blood purifiers should got into a va-
por bath cabinet, and it won't be long be-
fore they have a .skin as smooth, clear
and glossy as the most fastidious could
desire. The great feature of this bath
cabinet is the fact that it opens the sev-
eral million pores all over the body, stim-
ulates the sweat glands and thus all the
impure salts, acids and moisture in the
system are liberated in a natural manner
instead of overworking the lungs, kidneys,
bladder and the liver. Attached to the
bath, If desired, is a
COMPLEXION STEAMER
In which the face may be given the same
vapor treatment as the body. This pro-
duces the most wonderfully brilliant re-
sults and will undoubtedly be popular
with the ladies. Whatever will hasten
perspiration, everyone knows will prove a
benefit. Turkish baths, massage, hot
drinks, stimulants and hot foot baths,
with quinine doses internally, are all
known to the majority of people as bene-
ficial, but the best of these methods be-
comes crude and insignificant when com-
pared with the convenient and marvelous-
ly curative power of the cabinet bath as
referred to above. The cabinet is known
as the
NEW IMPROVED THERMAL
VAPOR
Bath Cabinet and was patented in Octo-
ber, 1896, by Mollenkopp & McCreary, To-
ledo, 0., who are Its sole manufacturers.
A pleasant feature of the cabinet is that
it is so constructed that it may be folded
procuring $3 from Ben Welnzopflen by
trick, fraud and device. The Judge sen
tenced him to pay a fine of $250, with the
alternative of six months in the County
Jail. Shepard's attorney gave notice of
appeal. In a previous case he was fined
a similar amount, and the case is now on
appeal. There is another case pending
against him before Judge Low.
Civil Service Examination.
The United Civil Service Commissioners
have issued their instructions for exam
ination in the Mint Department. The fol
lowing local board has been appointed to
conduct the examination in this city:
Colonel H. P. Bush, chairman: Henry
Mahler, secretary, and C. H. Sherman.
The examination for adjusters for the
United States Mint will be held on Satur
day. May 7. at 9 o'clock a. m. Applica
tions must be filed with the secretary at
the United States Mint not later than Fri
day, April 20. after which time none will
be received. Blank applications can be ob
tained from the secretary of the board at
the Mint.
Special attention is called to the fact
that the applications should not be for
warded to Washington.

flat in small space and put behind a door
out of the way. People building houses
may thus dispense with the costly bath
room, as the bath cabinet can be used in
any room in the house. For the sick room
its advantages are at once apparent. The
cabinet Is air-tight and water-proof, so
that the vapor cannot posibly escape into
the room. The cabinet is amply large
enough to comfortably hold an adult.
There have been so-called bath cabinets
on the market for years, and have sold
not on their merits, but because there was
an urgent demand for such a bath. The
New Improved Cabinet, made by the To-
ledo firm, is the only practical article of
the kind, is strongly and handsomely
made, and its manufacturers
GUARANTEE RESULTS.
They assert, positively, and their state-
ments are backed up by an array of testi-
mony from persons of. influence in their
respective towns, that their cabinet will
cure nervous debility, clear the skin, pu-
rify the blood, cure rheumatism (they of-
fer $50 reward for a case that can not be
relieved), cure women's troubles, night
Bweats, insomnia, and all diseases of the
nerves and blood. It
WILL CURE A HARD COLD
with one bath, and for such a purpose it
Is really a house.hold necessity. It is, of
course, 'the finest and most luxurioua and
beneficial bath imaginable, but its real
value lies In its marvelous power to draw
out of the system the impurities that
cause disease and for this reason is really
a godsend to humanity.
HOW TO GET ONE.
Readers who are sick or suffering from
any of the diseases referred to above
s'tould have one of the remarkable cabi-
nets. The price is wonderfully low. Space
will not permit of a detailed description of
the cabinet, but it will bear out the most
exacting demand for practicability and
curative properties. Write to Mollenkopp
& McCreary, 384, 356 and 3SB Summit street,
Toledo, Ohio, and ask them to send you
their pamphlets and circulars describing
thdr Improved Thermal Vapor Bath Cab-
inet. The regular price of the cabinet is
$5, and it would be difficult indeed to im-
agine where one could invest that amount
of money in anything else that can prom-
ise so much real genuine health, vigor and
robust strength. Write to-day for full in-
formation, or, better still, order a cabinet.
You won't be disappointed, as the makers
guarantee everything they ship. Their
references are the Toledo Savings Bank &
Trust Co., any express company, Mercan-
tile Agencies or any business firm in To-
ledo. Do not fall to send for booklet, as it
will prove very interesting reading.

THOSE TWO NEW HOUSES
WE .SPOKE OF LAST
WEEK ARE SOLD.
Two very sensible families, seeing the
the chance they had been waiting for, and
waking up to the folly of Increasing the
landlord's pocket-bookâ paying rent year
in and year out and getting nothing in
returnâ are the satislled possessors of
these two comfortable little homes In the
Heyman Tract. 'We are building four
more cottages â to date and convenient
in every way â that can be had from $1250
to $2500 each on the terms of your usual
rent money. This way you get a home

HARD LUCK OF
A THIRD MITE
Brought News From the
Shipwrecked Whalers
in the Arctic.
Had to Endure Hardships and
Surmount Many Dan
gers to Do So.
And Now the Owners of His Vessel
Refuse to Pay Back th^ Moneys
Ho Expended.
Mate George F. Tilton, who traveled
nearly 4000 miles through ice and snow,
braving all the dangers of an arctic
winter In order to bring news from the
whalers imprisoned off Point Barrow,
has been refused assistance by the
owners of his vessel.
When the brave whaleman left Point
Barrow he carried the following letter
with him:
POINT BARROW, October 12, 1897.
To Whom it May Concern: The bearer,
George F. Tilton, is on his way to Sltka to get
relief for the shipwrecked crews of the whale
ships at Point Barrow. Will you all kindly
help him along on his way?
W. P. S. PORTER,
Master Steam Whaler Jessie H. Freeman.
A. C. SHERMAN.
Master Steam Whaler Orca.
M. V. B. MILLARD,
Master Steam Whaler Belvedere.
In order to get here Tilton spent
nearly $500 of his own money and now
he is compelled to borrow from his
friends in order to pay his board bills.
Tickey and Kunana, the two Indians
who accompanied the daring imvigator
from Point Hope, have been cared for
by Llebes & Co., from whose station
they were taken, and they will be sent
home on the schooner Bonanza. The
firm will take the chances about get
ting paid for its trouble by the Gov
ernment.
Tilton was third mate of the steam
whaler Belvedere, and when he arrived
here he went to her owners, Lewis, An
derson & Co., for money. They re
fused point blank to give him a cent
and referred him to the Government
authorities. The Collector of the Port
and others to whom he applied told
him to pet his money from his owners
and then for Lewis, Anderson & Co. to
put in a claim against the Government.
In this way the matter was tied up all
around. Finally the firm advanced Til
ton $50 on his I. O. U., but since that
their purse strings have been pulled
fast although the unfortunate whale
man is still on the Belvedere's crew list
as third mate and the fact that he was
sent out on the perilous trip by his cap
tain is not denied.
Fifth Mate Charles Walker of the
Orca was sent out in precisely the
same manner as Tilton, and the man
ner in which he was treated by the
Steam Whaling Company speaks for
itself. As soon as the company heard
that he had reached a railroad station
Edwin L. Griffith, manager of the con
cern, arranged with the Canadian Pa
cific Railroad Company to provide him
with transportation and $100 cash for
incidental expenses. The two Indians
who came with Tilton have also been
well supplied with clothing and pres
ents to take home with them, but by
Mr. Griffith, not Lewis, Anderson &
Co.
Tilton Is determined to get back at
least the money he has expended,' but,
as the matter now stands, after risk
ing his life again and again and eroing
through perils and surmounting dan- ;
gers that would have killed a less reso
lute man in order to bring- out news
from the frozen whalers, it looks as
though he would have to go into court
to gret it.
Louis Abrahams, one of the best
known clothiers on the water front, â 
died at the Lane Hospital last Friday. '
The deceased had been In poor health
for over a year, and about six months l
ago he went under an operation. It was
only partially successful, and a few j
weeks ago he had to submit to another
one. He never rallied from the effects ;
of the shock to his system. Louis
Abrahams came to California In the
fifties, and about 1860 opened a tailor- j
shop on East street. In 1863 he moved I
to Clay street, near East, and his store i
Is still there. He was 64 years of age,
a native of Poland, and leaves ten chll- j
dren, all grown up.
The American ship Reaper arrived
from Philadelphia yesterday In the
smart time of 132 days. The barkentlne
City of Papeete took thirty-nine days
to come from Tahiti and the s hooner
Robert Searles twenty-four days to j
come from Honolulu. All three vessels
had uneventful voyages.

OCEAN RACE
him, as the Ancient Mariner Club as
sc-mbled yesterday at their old place.
"Well, they may fit out and be d to
thrm. The first thing that will happen
will be one of their vessels, half man-o'
war and half merchantman, will run up
ngainst some old hooker filled with old
shell backs from Maine or Massachusetts,
and it's a toss whether the privateer gets
the hooker or the hooker gets the priva
teer.
"You remember old Captain SamuelÃ of
the Dreadnought? Well, it's an old yarn,
of course, but's a good one of how he met
or rather didn't meet the Alabama. The
Dreadnought was ploughing along one
fine morning, not thinking of anything in
particular, when away down on the hori
zon comes the smoke of a steamer. Sam
uels saw It, but paid no particular atten
tion to it until one of his officers sug
gested that it might be a Confederate pri-
vateer and the whole ship's company
would be captured. 'It may be a priva
teer, as you say,' answered Samuels, 'but
before she captures this ship's company
she will have to capture the port to which
we are bound, for the old Dreadnought is
going to get there first!"
"Sure enough, the vessel proved to be
the Alabama, and as soon as she got
within signaling; distance she ordered
Samuels to heave to. Just about that time
a rattling breeze sprang up, and the an
swer she received was conveyed by every
stitch of canvas on the Dreadnought
which was spread at once, while old Sam
uels, taking the wheel himself, put his
vessel full and by and let her go for all
she was worth. The chase that ensued
was a dandy. It was steam and sail
against an old-time Yankee clipper, com
manded by an okl-tlme sail-carrying Yan
kee captain and manned by an old-time
crew. Every stitch that the sticks could
stand was stretched to the breeze, and
there it was left until it blew out of the
bolt ropes, when the watch would spring
aloft and bend another sail. The Ala
bama kept firing at intervals, but the sea
whs so rough that all the shots went
wild, only one or two of the closest pass
ing through the Dreadnought's upper
sails. It was a fair race with no favor,
and it was kept up all day. When the
evening closed in the Alabama was hull
down, and when the morning sun arose
and shone on the stars and stripes it was
the only flag that cou)<i be seen in the
whole expanse of ocean."
HIGH JINKS FOR NATIVES.
Delegates to the Grand Parlor Enter
tained by Stanford No. 76.
The ante-Grand Parlor high jinks, given
last night by Stanford Parlor No. 76.
Native Sons of the Golden West, who are
on their way to Nevada City, where the
grand body will meet next Monday, and
to members of local parlors, was the
most successful of these functions that
Stanford gives yearly.
The banquet hall where the Jinks was
held was decorated with a profusion of
American flags, and here and there was
observed a Bear flag. The audience,
numbering nearly 800, was patriotic in
the extreme, as was evinced when, in
response to the invitation of Henry S.
Martin, the chairman of the evening,
}r,s} l 2 open lne J' nks all should sing
Ihe Star Spangled Banner."
Lnder the direction of the following
named committee of arangements, H. S.
Martin, J. J. McCarthy, E. L. Head. Ed
J. Casey, W. A. Deane and G. D. Phillips
there was rendered a choice programme
of music, song and story, rendered by J.
Cathcart, W. Nielson, W. J. O'Brien, W.
AY. Finney, Messrs. Queen and Patton,
Richard I. Whalen. the Golden Gate
Quartet, Messrs. Williams and Walker.
Charles Bates. Rhys Thomas. J. J. Raf
faol, Bob Mitchell, "Julius Kahn and Wil
liam Holdridge.
Julius Kahn spoke of Abraham Lincoln
and aroused the audience to a high pitch
of patriotic enthusiasm. During the even
ing, between numbers, the audience sang
a number of soul-stirring patriotic songs.
The parlor furnished pipes and tobacco
and refreshments.
The delegates from Santa Lucia Parlor
at Salinas will make an effort to secure
the next Grand Parlor session for that
city, and to that end have had printed
for distribution to the delegates a hand
some souvenir descriptive of Salinas and
vicinity, illustrated with ha!f-tone pic
tures, including a view of what the peo
ple of that city nre justly proud of. the
greatest beot sugar factory in the world
now being built by Claus Spreckels.
NO CONSOLIDATION.
California League Magnates Reject
the Proposition of the Pacific
States People.
ThÂ« board of directors of the California
League held a meeting last night to con
sider a proposition from the Pacific States
League directors looking to the consolida
tion of the two leagues. Briefly, the plan
suggested includfd the closing of Recre
ation Park and playing all local games at
Central Park. President Bert and his
associates were willing to concede to the
California people the control of the play
ers, and make-ap of the teams. In other
words, all the teams of the California
League, except Sacramento, would remain
intact.
After listening to the plan the Califor
nia magnates unanimously refused to
enter into negotiations. They held that
whilp with two leagues neither would
mako much money, they were entirely
satisfied with their patronage so far. As
for playing at Central Park, the propo
sition would not be listened to a minute,
for at Recreation Park there is ample
room for the fielders, while the other
grounds are much too small to admit of
anything like clean playing. After some
talk It was decided that the California
League will continue Its Independent
course.
SHARKEY HAS RECOVERED.
The Strain Is Not as Serious as Was
First Thought.
The accident which befell Tom Sharkey
on Saturday, April 18, seems not to be of
such a serious nature as was at first
imagined. Sharkey in lifting a bale of
hay broke a small blood vessel. Soon
after the accident he began work, which
aggravated the lesion and forced the
strong man to lay off.
For the last two days Sharkey has gone
through with his regular training in sys
tematic manner. Yesterday he ran eight
miles, worked with the bap and went at
his sparring partners in old fashion. On
Monday the aspiring pugilist whose new
mark is Jeffries will leave \ allejo for
this city. He will go at once upon his
arrival here to the Seal Rocks Kouso.
where he will be installed until he meets
the Los Angeles hercules In the ring on
May C.
Dr. Turner has examined Sharkey and
he pronounces him sound from toe to
crown.

MELBA'S LUCIA.
The largest crowd In the history of the
California Theater crushed and* stilled to
hear Melba last night. The opera was
Donizetti's lugubrious "urn-pa" master
piece, "Lucia"; but that did not matter.
As at the two previous performances, the
attraction was Melba and only Melba,
The short Melba season will not be
memorable for the operas it has given
us. "The Barber" and "Traviata" are
familiar enough, but the Intimacy of
"Lucia" long since has been voted posi
tively indecent. To be wholly interest
ing now "Lucia" would have to be given
by nothing short of an all-star cast. We
all know that in the Melba cast Melba is
the only star, and that when Donizetti
wrote this once-upon-a-time wonder he
had in mind a tenor as well as a soprano.
You cannot ignore the tenor in "Lucia."
Last night the voice and gestures of
M. Salignac were loosened upon the
larded opportunities of Edpardo, and the
result was neither sweet sound nor felic
itous pictures. Salignao sang in a misfit
bunch of keys and acted unlike any
creature of God with which I am ac
quainted. He was a roaring, ripping
failure by all the canons of acting and
blunderbusses of song; and it was in
spite of Salignac and through the valiant
work of Melba. Camponari and Carbone
that even the famous old sextetâ which
sings itself, so to sayâ was not complete
ly spoiled.
It is only the sextet and the "mad
scene" that keep "Lucia" alive, and al
though the earlier scenes brought forth
the usual Melba applause it was her sing
ing of the mad song that alone was bril
liantly memorable In the performance.
In ray opinion this was the most perfect
exhibition of vocal art that she has yet
given us.
On the instant It became a tradition, a
great artistic fact that will be treasured
for life by those who heard it. In limpid
purity of tone, in crystal articulation, in
delicate temperamental poise, In flowing
gradations of color, In fragility, compact
ness, brilliancy, spontaneity and truthâ
In all the qualities that go to make up a
perfect rendition of this remarkable ex
hibition piece, it found the superlative of
Melba. ASriTON STEVENS.
INTERCOLLEGIATE TENNIS.
The Annual Championship Matches
Won by California.
In three straight matches California
won the annual tennis championship from
Stanford yesterday morning at the Cali
fornia Tennis Club. Stanford was repre
sented by Picher and Schneider in singles
and doubles, California by Sumner Hardy
and Stone in singles and Hardy and Selby
in doubles.
The first match was between Sumner
Hardy and Picher, both champions of
their respective colleges. Hardy started
out as if he were going to devour his op
ponent, but soon became careless. Picher
won the first game, but Hardy took the
second. Game by game they alternated
until it was five all. Then Hardy. un
willing to allow the set to draw out to an
interminable length, ended it by win
ning the next two games.
The second set was won in much the
same fashion. Hardy played easy ball
until Picher had won five games, making
it a deuce set. Then the former cham
pion of the coast took a full breath of air
and the work began. The two necessary
sets were .soon won and with them the
match. Score 6â4,6 â 4, 7â5.7 â 5.
Stone, called all sorts of hard names by
the band of Stanford students present,
won his first set from Schneider, 6âl. The
second set, with four games to his favor
to his opponent's one, looked just as easy
for him. but Schneider, whose brow ran
far back to the cerebellum, was a sur
prise, and the second set went to the man
from Palo Alto. The third set was a long
one, which Stone finally won, 7â5.7 â 5. Score
6âl, 6âB, 7-5.
The doubles between Hardy and Selby
and Picher and Schneider was an easy
victory for the California men. Two
straight sets tell the tale, 7â5, 6 â t
FOB, PURE FOOD.
Conference Between the Board of
Health and Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association.
A conferenc* was held yesterday between
members of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association and the Board of
Health to discuss proposed amendments
to the pure food law. Assistant District
Attorney Dunne said that as the law
stood now convictions were almost im
gossible. Professor Rising, chemist of the
_tate University, announced that during
his visit to the East and Europe, on
which he starts to-day, he will thorough
ly investigate the manufacture of gas and
the true reason for the expulsion of
American fruits from foreign countries.
Chief Food Inspector Dockery. Mi.
Kerr and others discussed the legislation
necessary to ston the manufacture and
exportation of bogus brandy. DockÂ«ry
presented a plan by which a standard of
purity could be established for different
kinds of condensed milk and cream now
being manufactured in this city. The
meeting adjourned without any' definite
action being taken.

ANOTHER TALE
Answers the Complaint
of His "Wife for a
Divorce.
A. Railroad Ride That Will
Figure in the Trial of
the Case.
The Parties Were Once Separated
but Remarried and Again
Disagree.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
808 Broadway, April 23.
J. F. Cameron, who has been sued by
his wife for divorce, filed a cross-com
plaint to-day which shows that their
various marital experiences have not been
without alleged faults on both skies. Mrs.
Cameron charged her husband with
cruelty, drunkenness and other incidental
shortcomings.
In his cross complaint Mr. Cameron
tells a lurid story. He alleges that he is
one of the kindest and tenderest of hus
bands and parents and that while not a
total abstainer he is a very temperate
and on the whole a sober man. lie posi
tively denies all the Impeachments of his
wife and having disposed of all her
charges he proceeds to tell of his own
grievances.
The most sensational chapter in Mr.
Cameron's tale relates to a railroad trip
across the continent, which he says was
taken by his wife at the beginning of the
year. He tells of various incidents that
occurred on the trip' and how on one
occasion it became necessary for the at
tendants of the sleeper to order Mrs.
'Cameron to be more decorous. On this
journey Mrs. Cameron did not come
alone, and her husband alleges that a cer
tain gentleman of her acquaintance was
partly responsible for the necessity of in
terference by the car attendants.
The troubles of the Camerons extend
over many years. They were married and
divorced and married again. In the in
terval, however, Mrs. Cameron legally
became Mrs. Foster for a brief period.
While enjoying this name Mr. Cameron,
who had not seen his divorced wife for
years, came from Canada and asrain made
her acquaintance. At his suggestion, it is
said, Foster was got out of the way by
another divorce, and the remarriage to
Cameron took place.
It Is this second marriage of the parties
which Mrs. Cameron is anxious to rifct
. and which her husband is appar
ently just as anxious to sever, though
h<-- prefers the decree in his favor
to letting his wife have it. He also makes
the allegation that Mrs. Cameron is not
bo well fitted to look after the interests of
a 1 ii 111â¢1 11â¢1 1 â¢ girl B y< ars of age as is her father.
COMPLICATED CONTRACT.
Entangled Property of the Late Mar-
tin Foye in -Court.
OAKLAND, April 23.â Katherina Diehl I
has Bled an answer in the suit of the j
Home Security and .. Loan. Association |
of - Alameda County against the Union !
National Bank et al. to foreclose on a
mortgage. It shows the most tangled ar
rangement of agreements, mortgages and i
counter-mortgages ever heard in this
county. It is all over a house and lot on
the corner of Ninth avenue and East
Tenth street, which was the property of
Martin Foye.
In 1593 Dr. and tors. J. A. Saunders
bought the house and lot. on which Foye
owed $500, and reed to pay $1000 for an
entrance fee to St. Joseph's Hospital in
San ran cisco for Foye and give him $10
Tier month during his, life. Saundera
mortgaged it for $1800, paid the J6OO due ,
and thf $1000 for Foye's admittance to the
hospital, and paid some other bills for 1
Foye. On March 23, 1893, Saunders in
dorsed Foye's note for $oÂ»j. On June 23
the bank notified Saunders that it must be -
paid. He paid the amount, but asked the
bank to keep me note and try to col-:
lc-ct it.
On N 25, 1595, the agreement be-:
re and Foye was caaceled ;
and tent made. The property

A HINT TO THE CHOIR.
Members Who Are Late Will Not Be
Protected.
OAKLAND, April 23. â Rev. Marshall
Law has issued a notice to his choir that
he intends should be read between as
veil as on the lines. The rector Is anxious
that he choir shall be on time, and the
following carefully worded notice has
been issued:
The rector suggests busmen promptitude In
the ginning of all our church services, com
mencing this Sunday, therefore every service
â will begin sharply at the appointed hoar The
morning service will open at 11 o'clock, not
five or t<Ti minutes afterward. Th- evening
service at 7:30, not five or ten minutes, or more,
later. A little laxity In the matter of prompt
beginnings due to a volunteer choir, has grown
Into an unpleasant delay which la not satis
factory to anybody. We will, therefore, begin
the service with such members of the choir as
may lie ready, and those who come later can
Vest and come into the choir chancel at th<Â»
rlose of musical numbers or during natural
breaks In the service. If the congregation no
tices some coming In after jhe service has be
j^in It is not to be assumed that they are In
tentionally late, for a number of the choir are
quite at the mercy of an erratic Sunday street
rar service, and they cannot always count upon
being In time even though they leave their
homes in ample time. But those present will
begin.

ALAMEDA, April 23.â The proppect that
the State Militia will sooYi be called on
for active service has filled the members
of Company G of the Fifth Regiment,
which is made up of Alameda boys, with
enthusiasm. Yesterday a call was issued
for enough volunteers to fill the company
to its full complement, and before the
armory closed in the evening twenty-nine
men had put their names on the muster
roll. To-day others have followed, and it
is expected that by to-night the full num
ber will have been obtained. One young
man (William Renfro) came on hia wheel
from Palo Alto to put his name on Com

member. He gave up a trip to Alaska
for the purpose of going to war with his
old comrades. Many of those now joining
are men who have served one enlistment
and are ready to take another. Whenever
Governor Budd gives the word Company
G will be ready to march.

all day without molestation, but toward
evening an excited man saw it and, think
ing it was the Spanish banner, lie started
to make a fuss about it. He wanted the
flag to come down at once, and it took
Mr. Taylor some time to convince him of
the real character of the emblem, in or
der to prevent further trouble. Mr. Taylor
has hung the flag in ths window of' his
office at the City Hail, with an American
banner by its side.

THE SAIS T FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 24, 1898.
KNIGHTS PARADE
ON THE AVENUE
An Imposing Spectacle
Presented by Califor
nia Templars.
Golden Gate Commandery's
Drill Corps Makes a Good
Showing.
Entertainment of the Grand Body
at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
There was a magnificent example of
trained marching and maneuvering by
the Grand Commandery of California,
Knights Templar, on Van Ness avenue
yesterday afternoon.
The scene was an inspiring example
of drill and fraternal ties, the plumed
knights and their black steeds present
ing a picture long to be remembered.
All along the line of march Van Ness
avenue was crowded with eager spec
tators, women and children predomi
nating everywhere.
Available view points were occupied
long before the knights assembled,
though they were at their places
promptly at 2:30, as advertised. As
the afternoon ripened the great throng
of spectators had reached its climax,
and just before the shadows began to
grow perceptibly on the hilltops the
drilled i..en in beautiful uniforms were
executing the movements that showed
them to be in thorough training.
The several commanderies formed on
the east side of Van Ness avenue in
the following order, the right resting on
McAllister street and extending on the I
avenue southward. California Com- j
mandery No. 1, to the number of eighty- I
one, mounted on black horses, except
ing Sir J. P. Fraser, the eminent com
mander, who was mounted on a white j
charger. The knights were attired in ;
full regalia of black and silver with
chapeau and flowing white plumes; a
company of the Grand Commandery,
with the American flag and the beau
seant, the battle flag of the Templars.
This was under command of Eminent
Sir F. W. Miller, grand captain-gene
ral; then the Oakland Commandery,
under command of Sir W. Frank
Pierce: also members of other com
| manderies, which did not turn out as
distinct bodies. There were several
: commanderies that had been assigned
! positions in the second battalion which
! did not take part in the parade. After
1 that was the third battalion, made up
; wholly of Gulden Gate Commandery,
'â  ninety-three rank and file, in four com
panies, under command of Eminent Sir
Jonathan M. Peel, and then were four
carriages containing aged and past
i grand officers. All of the Knights, cx
i cept those of California Commandery,
were afoot and wore black suits and
i chapeau with white plumes, but did
not wear mantles.
At half-past 2 o'clock the comman
deries fell into line and moved north
ward on the order to move being given
i by the signal officers, who gracefully
! waved their flags, each officer respond
i ing after the first signal was given. The
I commander and staff took up a posi

gathering. The occasion convening the

tice drill given by the young ladies of
the drill corps, who are to give an en
tertainment at Mechanics' Pavilion
during the progress of the festival in
aid of the Masonic Widows' and Or
phans' Home.
The young ladies showed great pro
ficiency in their drill and will un
doubtedly delight the vast throngs
which will gather in the Pavilion as
they have been trained and thoroughly
drilled by an expert in the person of
Past Commander Reuben P. Hurlbut
of California Commandery, under
whose tuition and command California
Commandery Drill Corps achieved dis
tinction by invariably carrying off the
honors when competing with other
Templar drills of the State. After the
evening's drill refreshments provided by
the young ladies were served, during
which brief addresses were delivered
by several eloquent knights. Before
the delights of the evening were over
Commandant Hurlbut became the re
cipient of a token of appreciation from
the young ladies of the corps whom he
had brought to a wonderful degree of
proficiency in the tactics.
The presentation was a perfect sur
prise to the commandant, who could
hardly find words to express his thanks.
Sir John Tonningsen ably assisted the
ladies by officiating as master of cere
monies. The uniform of the Ladies'
Drill Corps is an artistic creation, and
will charm all who may be favored by
seeing the coming drill at the Pavilion.
Instead of miniature rifles, bejeweled
swords or polished foils, the young
ladies drill with American flags, pre
sented by J. M. Litchfield, which
they handle with consummate ability.
These young ladies are pronounced

WATER-FRONT
PIRACY GETS
HARD BLOWS
Judge Belcher Excoriates the Har=
bor Commissioners in the
Irving Case.
The Plaintiff Wins, While the Defendants
Are Directly Charged With Favorit
ism and Gross Disregard
of Law.
The Harbor Commissioners have received their first official
blow. The decision of Judge Belcher rendered yesterday declares
that they have conducted their department without regard to law;
that they have rejected bids for no other reason than to give con
tracts to their pets; that they had no right to employ the "special
counsel,'' under whose advice they claimed to be acting, and that the
advice they received was not sound. It accuses them directly of bad
faith and gross favoritism. In the action brought by Samuel C. Irv
ing against the Harbor Commissioners the latter are kno:ked out at
every point, there never having been a more complete victory than
that achieved by Irving. The attention of the Grand Jury will
doubtless be drawn anew to the fact that it has been weighing the
deeds and character of the commission.
Judge E. A. Belcher of the Superior
bench has rendered a decision in the
case of Samuel C. Irving against the
Harbor Commissioners. The decision
is bo complete a triumph for Irving and
for the public, that it is ; rinted in
full. It includes, as merely incidental,
a scathing arraignment of the Com
missioners, particularly of the presi
dent, Mr. Colnon. The methods by
which the Commissioners have sought
by a total disregard of law to favor
their pets ie detailed with no mincing
of words. So lucid and logical is the
entire decision that It will be of inter
est to every citizen. The decision fol
lows:

OPINION.
The first of the actions above entitled
is brought by the plaintiff as a citizen i
and taxpayer to restrain the defendant
from opening bids under the third set of
specifications, so called, and from award- ;
ing any contract thereon; and from
awarding any contract for treating piles j
for the repair of Green street wharf to

Paint Company, the lowest bidder under I
all of the methods Bet forth in the second
Hi-i of specifications; and to restrain the
defendant for one year from giving the i
work of treating piles on the water from
to any save the Paraftlne Paint Company,
the lowest bidder for that work. The
second of. the actions is mandamus to !
compel the defendant to award the con
tract for treating the piles to be used in I
the repairs of Green street wharf, and as
well the contract for treating all piles
that may be ordered by the defend- ;
ant for use on the water front
of San Francisco for one year .to
the Parafline Paint Company, the lowest,
bidder under all methods named in the
specifications.
Full Consideration Given.
Nearly two months were consumed in
the trial. The cases were tried together;
that is to say, It was stipulated that the 'â 
evidence in the one should apply in the
other so far as applicable, and they were I
presented by counsel in the most careful
and conscientious mannerâ the argument
alone consuming nearly six days. I re
gret that the time at my disposal from
other pressing duties renders it impossi
ble for me to present and elaborate my
views in extenso, as I could wish, and as
the questions Involved and the fine and
painstaking efforts of counsel deserve.
However, as the Hoard of State Harbor
Commissioners is a public body, and as
all of the moneys expended by It are pub
lic moneys, and as the public have an in
terest and a right to be interested in all
that the board does. I have thought it my
*uty, even though briefly, to express my
â¢pinion in writing.

CURED BY
About eight years ago I got sore hands. It
commenced with a burning sensation on my
fingers. When I rubbed them you could nee
little white pimples on the skin, and I felt
like twisting my lingers out of their sockets.
I had high fever and cold chills, and nights
I had to walk the floor until I fell asleep. I
got tho Ccticura Resolvent and Cctioura.

and I don't believe there is one of the first
nails loft on my hands which are now cured.

llfges, easements nnd appurtenances con
nected therewith, commonly known and
designated as tho "water front." The
Income of the board is wholly derivable
from the water front, to-wlt, from dock
age, wharfage, tolls, rents and cranage,
and not from general tuxes. Such in
come amounts to the sum of $50,000 or
$60.00(1 each month, that is to say, the
income of the board is between $600,000
and $700,000 per annum. This vast sum
Is wholly expended in each year.
What Might Be.
Properly husbanded It probably is ade
quate to bring about a result suggested
by counsel in argument, that is to say,
to provide "for the construction of all
water front improvements in permanent
form, etc., so that the Legislature, within
a comparatively short term of years,
might declare San Francisco a "free
port" like Liverpool, No d.,ubt that is
legislative intendment, though somewhat
dimly expressed. The language (Sec. 2524,
Political Code), gives the Mayor of San
] rancisco and the commissioners power
to modify rates of dockage and wharf
age until such and such a revenue shall \
be produced, and then provides that
"when Buch modification has been made,
me collection of tolls must be abolished
and the toll collectors discharged." No
great powers of prophesy are required to
forecast the effect of such a declaration
upon the industries of California and tho
commerce of San Francisco.
On the 16th of November, ISP7, the San
Francisco Board of State Harbor Com
missioners determined that it was neces
sary to have M 7 piles treated for repairs
of Green-street wharf; and further deter
mined that it was necessary to have a
sup] ly of piles treated for use on the
water front in other work during the
then ensuing year, and specifications were
prepared accordingly and published in
viting competitive bidding, all as required
by law. Several bids came In, pursuant
to the notice, and on the 24th of the same
month the board met to consider them,
but having been restrained by an order
of court from opening the bids, the board,
by mesne recesses, continued the matter
until the 14th day of December, when the
injunction was removed and the bids
opened.
The Lowest Bid.
The bids were in form and were ac
companied by certified checks, as re
quired by law. The bid of the Parafflne
I'aint Company was the lowest bid upon
all of the methods named, and it was
not alone that, but it was the lowest price
for which the work could be done. As
to that there was no conflict in the evi
dence. The board discussed the bids
without acting upon them, and took a I
recess in the matter until the day follow- 1
ing. Upon the day following the board j
further discussed the bids without acting
upon them, and took another recess in
the matter until the following dayâ the
16th. On that day Mr. Stratton, the spe
cial counsel, who had been requested to
advise the board with respect to the
bids, sent in a written opinion wherein
he advised the. board that it had lost
jurisdiction by not opening the bids on
the day named in the advertised notice.
He further advised that the specifications
be changed. Afterward, on the same day,
the board rejected all of the bids. With
respect to that action the Commission
ers testified that the bids were rejected
because of the advice of the special coun
selâthe action of the board practically
being that of two of the Commissioners,
the third, whose term was about to ex
pire and who was in the political minor
ity, concurring as a matter of form in
the action of his associates.
As to Special Counsel.
The action of the board in employing
special counsel and In rejecting the bids,
and the action of the special counsel were
both dwelt upon at length in evidence and
in argument. First, it was said by coun
sel for plaintiff that the board had no ]
authority to employ special counsel at j
the public expense. With respect to that
matter section 2521 of the Political Code
provides that the board shall appoint an
attorney who shall hold his office for the
term or four years, and section 2052 pro
vides that he shall receive from the State
a salary of J2OO per month ($2400 per an
num). Section 2053 further provides that
"the Attorney General of the State must
frive such lega. advice and render such
egal services as may from time to time
be required of him by the Commissioners
In connection with their duties without
further compensation." These provisions
of the general law indicate a clear legis
lative intention to give the Commission
ers a capable attorney of their own
choice at an adequate salary (it being re
membered that the service is not exclu
sive), and to further give them the bene
fit of the Attorney General's advice when
required. I think the maxim, expressio
unlus est excluslo alterlus, is a^ilicable.
The provisions that the board shall have
its own attorney (and at all of the times I
mentioned the board has had a very ca- i
pable attorneyâ Mr. Tirey L. Ford), and j
the requirement that the Attorney Gen
eral shall give advice when required,
which it is provided shall be "without ]
further compensation." satisfactorily in- I
dicate a legislative intention to limit the
public expenditure for legal services in
that behalf to the sum of $2400 per an
num. It follows that the Commissioners i
have no right to employ special counsel.
Mr. Stratton's Affiliations.
Concerning Mr. Stratton's connection
with the board and certain parties who
were dealing with the board. I feel bound >
to say that I cannot follow the plaintiff's
counsel. If Mr. Stratton made a mistake
touching the disposition of his legal serv
ices to the board and certain other par
ties I think the mistake was an honest
mistake. As to the advice given by him
to the board on the day the bids were re
jected, while I do not" agree that it was
sound. I entertain no doubt that it was
sincerely given. I do not think it neces
sary to say anything further upon the
subject.
The good faith of the members of the j
board In rejecting the bids is Quite a
different matter.
In referring to the members of the
board, I feel that in justice to all it
should be said that both evidence and
argument was aimed particularly at the
president, or as he was sometimes called,
the executive member of the board.. At
â¢t"> Him tha tcts comdalned of were

committed, the term of one of the mem
tert? of the board was . about to empire
and he was in the political minority as
i well, and for both reasons he contented
himself with concurring In the action of
the others. The third member took his
seat in 1897, after the course of dealing
criticized in these cases was Instituted,
and while he has devoted. much time and
attention to the business of the board he
seems to have deferred In the matters
under, consideration to the maturer ex
perience of the executive member and to
what he supposed were established meth
ods.
The Commissioners' Favorites
The Commissioners had been advised
by their special counsel not to open the
bide at all, but to return them unopened,
as In counsel's opinion they had no au
thority to open them.- They disregarded
the advice and opened the bids. The
Commissioners had three favorites in par
ticular, and the evidence makes it fairly
inferable that they were of opinion that
no one would be able to underbid one
of these favorites In the matter of treat
â¢ â¢ __â¢ _^_^____^ I
Ing piles by the creosote method. At the
opening of the bids it was disclosed that
the favorite was not the lowest bidder.
That fact furnished a reason for the re
jection of all the bids. The Commission
ers had rejected bids before.
In the Healey case they rejected the
bids upon the ground that they were
"too high" and advertised again, and
having thus got rid of "objectionable bid
ders," to adopt the phrase of counsel,
awarded the contract to ..rby Laydon,
one of the pets of the board at the same
sum he had offered in the bids previously
rejected because "too high." At the pre
vlous bidding Darby Laydon was not
the lowest bidder. One explanation of the
Darby Laydon award was that If the
second bids had been rejected the Com
missioners would have been obliged to gc
into the open market and purchase at a
price not less than 10 per cent below the
lowest bid. But the statute will not bear
any such interpretation, and the Commis
sinners had never been advised that li
would. . If. the board found that bids were
JUDGE EDWARD A. BELCHER.
"too high" It was their duty to reject
them and readvertlse as many times as |
they should determine that the bids were !
"too high"â the design of the law being ;
to secure to the public the advantage of j
free and open competition, and thus pro
cure the public work to be done at a fair
price. The Intention was to make it im
possible for bidders to combine to keep
prices up, and to inhibit favoritism on
the part of the Commissioners.
The Law Violated.
That the excellent purpose of the law
has been disregarded or frustrated the
record in these cases leaves no room for
doubt. It is unfortunate and regrettable
in the extreme that any criticism of the
Harbor Commissioners should be neces
sary, but it Is my duty to declare that
the facts and circumstances in evidence
show the grossest favoritism upon their
part â a plain and evident intention to
give the entire business of the water
front to three favorites, viz.. Darby
Laydon & Co., the Slade Lumber Com
pany and the San Francisco Timber Pre
serving Company.
Practically the entire business of the
San Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany for the last year and a half has
been with the Harbor Commission.
For the Commissioners It was urged
that they had a right to act arbitrarily
and capriciously if they chose to do so,
and Anderson vs. Public Schools, 122 Mo.
; 67 was cited as authority; but I cannot
accept the authority as In point. The
Commissioners are public officers. They
are paid by the public large salaries for
the performance of purely public duties â
salaries sufficient to enable them to give
their exclusive attention to the public
business. It is the duty of every public
i officer to discharge his trust with unvary-
I ing, straightforward conscientiousness,
1 and in so doing there is no room for fa
voritism or arbitrary or capricious action.
Opening of the Bids.
The Commissioners were advised by
their special counsel that they had lost
jurisdiction by not opening the bids upon
the day named in the notice. I am unable
to join in that conclusion. The Commis
sioners could not open the bids on that
day because the court had enjoined the
very act: but they retained their juris
diction of the matter by taking specific
public recesses from day to day until they'
could open the bids. The intention of the
statute in providing for the opening of the
bids on the day named in the notice is
to give the bidders an opportunity to be
present. That purpose is fulfilled if upon
that day the matter 1b continued to , an
other day certain.
If this were not 80, and the statute
were to be construed as mandatory, and
the board held to be without jurisdiction
after the day named In the notice, then
the State would indeed become a prey
to the pirates of the water front; for
nothing- would be easier than for some
one in the conspiracy to enjoin the board
at any time and thus oust it of jurisdic
tion, and so on ad infmltum till honest
biduers were driven off and the con
spiracy consummated. To so construe
the statute would be to rob it of its
force. There is no more reason for hold
ing that the board had lost jurisdiction
in this case, the matter having been
specifically continued to another day
certain, than there would be for holding
that a court in which an insolvency pro
ceeding is pending would lose jurisdic
tion by continuing a meeting of creditors
to another day certain.
An Omission in Bad Faith.
It was sa.d as another reason for re
jecting the bids that the specifications
were to be changed, but the changes ad
vised by the special counsel did not af
fect the previous set of specifications (the
set which had just been opened) in any
substantial or material manner or par
ticular; and the changes made by the
Commissioners (the third set of specifi
cations) did not affect the previous set of
specifications in any material or substan
tial manner, save to omit the treatment
of the year's supply of pilesâ an omission
which I have no hesitation in declaring
to have been in bad faith and made In the
interest of one of the favorites. I enter
tain no doubt tnat the rejection of the
lids was entirely without warrant In law,
and that the action of the Commissioners
is indefensible upon any ground.
The repairs of Green street wharf
found to be necessary remained to be
made, and the year's supnly of piles re
mained to bo treated, and the findiner in
respect to both matters still stands, and
ob a matter of fact the work must be
done. The measures referred to are pro
tective measures, and it is the duty of the
board to protect the State's property. To
talk about discretion to proceed with the
work or not in such a case is Idle. The
Commissioners would find themselves In
a grave Bituation if they were to refuse
to perform their clear duty. The law re
quires that the board shall advertise for
bids upon any work that exceeds $3000.
The piles to be used in the Green street
wharf are confessedly in excess of the
limitation; and the treatment of the
year's supply of piles is In excess also. In
emergency matters, within certain limi
tations, the board need not advertise, but
the board has no right to consider the
treatment of the year's supply of piles as
an emergency matter.. The public are en
titled to the benefit of the competition
procured by the invitation to all bidders
presented through a public advertisement.
Capacity of the Plaintiff.
It was said that the injunction could
not stand, anyhow, because the plaintiff
had no capacity, merely as a citizen, to
pros. cute the action; but in Santa Rosa ,
Lighting Company vs. Woodward, 50 Pac.
Rep., 1031, the court says: "It is not es
sential in an application in a proper case
designed to compel compliance with stat
ute law that the plaintiff must show ac
tual pecuniary interest."
Under the mandamus proceedings the
relator seeks to require the board to
award to it the contracts under the sec
ond set of specifications (the set opened
by the board) as being 'lie lowest bidder
thereunder and entitloti to the award.
The statute provides that the award shall
be to the "lowest bidder" and not the
"lowest .responsible bidder," as provided
in some of the States.
The responsibility, however, of the plaln
tiff in this case is beyond cavil. The
phrase "lowest bidder" seems to have
been designedly employed, because after
ward in the same section, in providing for
the leasing of premises on the water front
for the purpose of marine railways and
drydocks, the phrase "highest responsible
bidder" is employed, thus demonstrating,
in my estimation, that the omission of the
word "responsible" after the word "low
est" and before the word "bidder" was in
tentional.
Yet the Bids Were Rejected.
In this case the board had determined
that certain work wns necessary to be
done. Afterward, and pursuant to that
determination, specifications were pre
pared and published, and In due season
bids accompanied by certified checks came
In, all as required by law. Subsequently
the bids were opened and the plaintiff
was found to be the lowest bidderâ more
than that, the plaintiff's hid was the low
est sum for which the work could be done.
The bi<]Â« were all rejected.
All authorities agree that the discretion
of a public officer, in a proper case, can
not be controlled: but where one has been
denied a right which it was the plain
legal duty of the officer to grant and
which he had no proper discretion to re
fuse, mandamus is the remedy. In thi3
State it is provided (Sec. 10S6, C. C. P.)
that "the writ of mandate must be issued
in all cases where there is not a plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordi
nary course of law. It must be issued
upon affidavit on the application of the
party beneficially interested." The ques
tion, then, is whether the board had a
discretion to reject the bids, and, second,
i whether the plaintiff under the statute
I can be said to be beneficially interested.
Touching the rejection of the bids, there
is no doubt whatever that if there had
! been a fair exercise of discretion, as that
: the order had been rescinded and a re
] determination reached not to do tbe work
at all, or if it had been determined to
change the plans in material respects,
the board would have possessed plenary
power; but this was not such a case.
Arbitrary and Capricious.
The rejection of the bids was arbitrary
and capricious and in bad faithâ was a
mere subterfuge to favor another. In
Santa Rosa Lighting Company vs. Wood
ward, 50 Pac. Rep., 1025, the plaintiff al
ready had a contract for lighting tha
streets of the city up to the Lrst day of
August, 1594. On July 3, 1894, th.c City
Council resolved to enter into a contract
for thite years from August 1, 1894, with
another to light the streets.
The formal written contract not having
been signed the Council on July 31 made
a temporary arrangement for such lights
as might be renuired. On November 17.
1 (; 94. the Council rescinded its action of
July. On May 14, 1595. a motion to shut
off the street lights was defeated. Since
July 31 ism, the Council had been audit
ing bills under the temporary arrange
mentâthe effect being that the Council
had been making day to day contracts to
light the streets. Held that the proceed
ings showed that the Council had de
termined to light the streets, and in re
fusing to advertise for bids and in making
day to day contracts under the "tempo
rary arrangement" they were evading the
law, and mandamus was the proper rem
edy.
With respect to the plaintiff's beneficial
interest it was argued on the one side
that the lowest bidder merely has no
beneficial interest within the meaning of
the statute and i? not entitled to the writ;
on the other, that where the lowest bid
der has done all that is required of him to
be done, has lodged a certified check sub
ject to forfeiture and exposed his busi
ness to the public by the opening of the
bids in open board, he may L>e said to
have earned the contract.
In Keller vs. Hewitt ClO9 Cal., 146) the
relator had applied to the Boar# of Edu
cation for a teacher's certificate, and had
been examined and found entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding that finding, however,
the board arbitrarily refused to issue the
certificate. Held that the relator was
entitled to a writ of mandate to com
pel the board to perform its duty.
The Board Evading the Law.
Both of those cases are on all fours
with the case at bar. In the one it had
been determined that something should be
done, it was necessary that it should be
done, and it remained undone and the de
fendant was evading the law; in the other
the relator had done all that was required
of him to he done and was entitled to the
thing he demanded. The same conditions
obtain here: the board have determined
that certain work is necessary to be done,
and, in fact, it is necessary to be done,
and it remains undone and the board are
evading the law; and the relator has done
all that Is required at his hands, and his
bid Is the lowest bid and the lowest price
for which the work can be done, and he
is entitled to the contract.
These conclusions are decisive of both
cases. It Is therefore ordered in the one
case that the temporary restraining order
be made perpetual, and in the other that a
writ of mandate issue as prayed for.

The plans for the proposed hanging

Widows' and Orphans' Home are now
complete, and the designer vowed yes
terday that his idea was not only a feasi
ble one but was certain to prove an ex
tremely attractive feature of the fair. It
is proposed to serve light refreshments
in a bower composed entirely of flowers,
palms and ferns. There will be no risk
whatever, and the idea of viewing the
merry scene below amid such charming
surroundings is certainly a pleasing one.
Healdsburg sent yesterday nearly half
a carload of mountain lilies, a large num
ber of which were disposed of early yes
terday at the floral depot, 16 Post street.
Mrs. W. Frank Pierce, who has general
supervision of the ladies who are work
ing in the interests of the festival, said
yesterday that they were meeting \ith
great success in their endeavor to induce
the merchants of the city, restaurateurs
and others to take flowers regularly from
the depot. The Baldwin Hotel, the Cafe
Zlnkand, Mas.key' 6, Goldstein & Conn,
Waller Bros, and many others are al
ready daily patrons 01 the floral depot.
Berkeley has undertaken to send all the
flowers the committee can possibly dis
pose of on Tuesdays and Fridays, and on
Wednesdays and Thursdays San Rafael
will see to It that there is aii ample sup
ply. All the money spent at 16 Post street
goes directly to the festival fund, for the
flowers are all donateu and there is no
charge for arrangement or delivery.
The latest addition to the booths pro
posed is one where the creations of the
leading milliners of the city and coast !
wIU be on exhibition. It is promised that i
there will ue a voting contest in connec
tion with this booth, which will enable
the visitors at the Pavilion to determine
which is the most artistic confection.
The idea has been taken hold of enthusi
astically in the city and this will doubt
less be one of the most interesting of the
thirty or forty interesting booths.
On the opening night there will be a
chorus of a thousand children's voices,
the glees being Callfornian and national,
and later during- the festival there will be
a children's kazoo band. A chorus of 100
male voices is also promised, which will
be heard on three or four different occa
sions.

Edward Cordes, a butcher living on
Twenty-fourth street, was arrested yes
terday afternoon on a charge of battery.
He was released on bail.
The complaining witness Is Fred G.
Lindsey, a druggist In the store of Dr.
Hughes on Twenty-fourth street. He
states that people usi:;g the telephone in
the store had been putting plugs in the
receiver instead of nickels, and Dr.
Hughes Instructed him to personally see
that nickels were always put in. Yester
day morning Cordes called at the store
to use the telephone, and Lindsey asked
him for his nickel. Cordes refused to
produce it and struck Lindsey, knocking
him down. Lindsey jumped to his feet
and Cordes again struck him. Lindsey s
mother, who happened to be in the store
at the time, interfered to protect her son,
and Cordes also struck her.
Lindsey, as soon us he fot rid or the
infuriated butcher, went to Judge Joa

President TV. H. Jacques of the Hol

the new semi-submerged torpedo-boat
as follows:
"We all know how difficult it Is to

:â¢â â¢: â¢â â¢ automobile torpedo, one of suf
; size to carry a crew and yet
possessing not only similar automatic
i for controlling the position, but
ng them supplemented by direct
hanical ones under the direct con
j trol of the brain of man.
"Such a boat will be practically ir
resistible and invulnerable; will even
resist the attack of heavy ordnance,
and is a type that it will be impossible
: tÂ«i avoid."
Inventor Holland proposes to build
of these all-around fighting sub
marine machines as follows: A vessel
220 feet long, 24 feet wide and draw*
U feet of water. Its displace
ment will be 1000 tons; the engines
will have 10.000 or 12,000 horsepower
and develop a speed of twenty-five
knots. The armored superstructure to
t the smokestacks and oompan
onway is to be between 30 and 40 feet
long and 10 feet wide in the middle, the
being made half round The arm-
Ist of four large rapid
fire guns of 10 or 12 pound caliber in
revolving turrets. The armor will be
â¢â¢is heavy as the vessd can carry, but
not less than 12 inches. When light
the superstructure will be only 15
inches above water in the middle; in
action it will be covered by 4 feet of
water, and the guns will be but 5 feet
abeve the water line.
Such a boat as this combines all the
qualities of a torpedo-boat and a tor
pedo-boat destroyer, and can also be
as .i d( stroyer of torpedo-boal de
stroyers. Not only this, but it can
move fi ::.-'. Bsly right up within
torpedo range of â â  line of batt le-shipj,
which can only train their rapid-fire
guns upon the Little craft, and the pro
jectiles from such guns will strikeharm
lessly upon the heavily armored super
structure, if they could hit so small
a target as the vessel exposes when in
action.
THE news which come? from New
York of the successful trials
made by the Holland submarine
boat has set men considering
Beriously the possibility of u;-inp
this terrible weapon of offense in the
war which now seems inevitable.
. Naval experts of course are divided
on the question, they always are when
ever any new instrument of destruc
tion is introduced. The more conserva
tive shake their heads gravely and
dwell on. the many limitations which
natural law imposes on submarine nav
igation; the younger and more enthu- I
siastic members of the profession make !
light of these difficulties and claim that
we have here a weapon which, in dead
ly effect, will outrival even the torpedo.
And we know from sad experience what
terrible destruction can be wrought by
even one torpedo or submarine mine.
As a matter of fact, we are all in the
dark as yet as to what may or may not
be accomplished by a submarine tor
pedo boat. We know little enough about
the behavior in real warfare of vessels
which maneuver on the surface, and it I
remains to be seen what those moving I
in the depths will achieve. All we know,
so far, is that the Holland boat has
proved herseif able to travel for several |

miles under the water, to riso and sink
at the will of her operators, and to dis
charge a torpedo at a target. She pre
sents no target at which an eÂ»emys
quick-firing puns can aim: sho is prac
tically Invulnerable, and naval science
has not yet devised a means of defense
against her attacks. So that if any
Spanish vessels come within her range
She may, under favorable circum
stances, revenge the loss of the Maine.
The Holland boat was tried at Perth
Amboy, N. J., last month, and sub
jected to four severe tests. While run
ning full speed she was submerged by
simply filling her tanks, reappearing
' gradually after traveling some distance
under water. In addition to her capa
city for submarine work, the Holland
can make a good tight on the surfajc .
! She can lire an aerial torpedo contain
ing 100 pounds of guivotton for a dis
tance of a mile. Also she is supplied
with three 18-inch Whitehead torpe
does, fired from a tube under water.
Further, there is a submarine gun at
the stern, designed to fire a projectile
five hundred yards through the water.
When on the surface she is propelled
by gasoline engines, when below elec
tric storage batteries do the work. Hor
izontal rudders regulate the depth to
which the boat is sunk, but to be kept
under water she must be constantly
moving. The boat is 55 feet long by 11
feet in diameter, and it is claimed that
she can run for fifty miles without
coming to the surface for breath.
So far, the Holland boat promises
well; but the main question is. Will the
conditions favorable for the use of a
submarine vessel ever occur in real
action?
That is the whole point. The world,
or at least that portion of it which is
looking anxiously forward to the
I Amerieo-Spanish conflict as^a means of
solving many unsolved problems in
naval construction, watches with in
terest for the first real trial of the boat.
A trial under merely peace conditions
does not count. The enemy must be at
anchor and at not too great a distance

THE present century ha 3 been the
most disastrous in Spanish history,

Jewels in her crown, her territorial

Alfonso XIII, who, however, is but 12
years old, and whose mother, Maria
Christina, is the regent of the country.
The present constitution of Spain was

importance floated her flag. For cen
tu>ies f.hf drained these couimi'js of
every bit of revenue, just as of late
years she has drained Cuba. In the
days of her might and glory she ruled
over some of the widest and richest
possessions in history. Then gradually
these possessions began to full away
from her, just as Cuba and the Phil
ippine Islands are breakup away to
day. Mostly these possessions were
lost by successful revolutions.
The present nineteenth century has
been the most disastrous in Spain's
eventful career, and in all the long
Btriiig of one hundred unlucky years
each of which could be relied upon for
support In time of war. Any Spaniard
above the age of 19 is liable to be
called upon to serve in the permanent
army for three years. From this part
of the army the soldier passes to the
actiw reserve lor three years' service,
and from thence to the sedentary re
serve for six years' service. By paying
1500 pesetas any one may escape serv
ice.
The colonial army requires every
able-bodied subject to serve eight years
in the various reserves. Thus most of
the King's subjec â are militiamen, and
it is estimated that in time or need
Spain could easily mobilize an efficient
army of 1.083,595 men. The standing
arnv numbers about 70,000 men, al
though recent levies make thi . num
ber nearer 100,000. Spain's navy is like
wise capable.
Most of these â  essels have a normal
speed of 20 knots and several, notably
the Viscaya and the Maria Teresa, ex
the decade between 1820 and 1830 was
the most unlucky to her. The year 1800
dawned for her with the loss of prac
tically the whole of the Mississippi val
ley. This great slice in North America
cut from the crown was followed by
the loss of smaller- strips of territory
in South America. Between IS2J and
W^f^ o *^ Ws%&s \1
ceed this rato. Spain also has a num
erous tleet of torpedo-boats and tor
pedo-boa, destroyers. Her fighting
navy is manned by 1002 officers, 9000
marines and 14.000 sailors, bes.-es about
1000 mechanicians of various kinds.
This is in fact the army, and this the
navy which will protect the beautiful
Spanish cities which have known less
change since the days of the Moors
than almost any other in Europe. Spain
is not after all, a modernized nation
in the sense that other nations are
modernized. Her people are governed
by the s- irit of Quixotism that caused
Isabella to pledge her jewels SO that
Columbus might start westward; that
caused Ferdinand and his consort to
move their throne chairs "r> to the very
walls of the Moorish strongholds that
the example might incite f.e chivalrous
bravery of their followers; that caused
the houses of Urna and De Leon to
pledge their estates that the Moors
mi^ht be driven >om the Alhambra.
1830 revolutions sputtered and exploded
all along the Pacific slope of the Andes
and with every explosion i T-tes like
Bolivia, Venezuela, Paraguay, Colom
bia, lUttKUay. Argentina, Chil*, Pe^u.
Guatemala and Mexico dropped off into
independent existence.
Some of them went by purchase, but
most of them by force of arms; In
either case Spain found herself too
weak to hold on.
The sixteenth century saw Spain the
richest, the most powerful and most
magnificent nation on the face of the
earth. The twentieth century is likely
to see her among the lowliest.

farms casually to visiting friends, as a

many of the residents have actually
never visited them.

tendance if three-eighths of the mem
bers show up for drill. Now there 19
seldom a man absent and it can safely
be depended upon that his absence is
caused by sickness. The applications
for membership are now so great tho
officers cannot keep track of them. But
the complement of the ship is full and
no others can ioin n<> matter how eager
or desirable they may be.
"We don't expect to be sent to the
front." said one of the youngest mem
bers last drill night, "but we are ready
and willing to go."' And the way thia
sturdy young fellow emphasized his
words left no doubt as to his earnest
ness.
"You see," he went on, as he polished
Individually, when quiet, they are not
in the least attractive, even when in
full plumage.
Some of the birds became so much
excited that they executed a most pe
culiar waltz movement, whirling around
and around as if crazed, as 1 suppose
they were, temporarily. The fence
around the large corrals is quite high
and substantial, although they say it
is entirely unnecessary, for it would
be impossible to drive them over a
barrier a foot high â they do not seem
to be able to estimate heights, and if
positively forced to cross a board a
few Inches high they will leap wildly
into the air as far as possible; they
are so heavy, even when young, that
they cannot rise from the ground very
far. and the matured birds weigh over
two hundred and fifty pounds and
stand about seven feet high.
Another of the large corrals had a
large number of the brown young birds,
from six months down. It is very
easy to tell iheir age, as they grow
one foot a month for the first six
months.
The small corrals have each a pair of
the fully grown birds, and in one of
them the hen was setting on the nest,
which is simply a hole dug in the
ground by the male. He also does the
larger part of the setting, being on the
nest from 5 in the afternoon until 9
the next morning, and giving her a rest
of an hour at noon also. It has so far
been impossible to find a successful in

greater percentage of eggs than an or

the broech of one of the old CO-pound
ers, "we are not real men-o'-warsmen
in the technical sense of the word, but
I tell you the boys on board this old
craft can give pointers to a good many
men who have been at sea for years.
They are all completely wrapped up in.
naval study and are all full-blooded
Americans. We love our country and
we love our ship, and there ain't a man
among us who is afraid to fight.
"Of course this recent trouble has
kind of roused us up, but we have al
ways felt just as we do now. America
is our native land and we are ready to
fight any other nation who dares af
front us. Why, I really believe that if
word came to us that an enemy, in the
shape of some big ironclad, was coming
toward the Golden QÂ»te and there was
no other defense but this old wooden
ship every man aboard would glad
ly jump to his place and sail out
to fight. And even if he knew the
chances of his coming back were rather
slim."'
To see just what interest those young
men take in their work at the present
time it is only necessary to be down on
the dock any morning just before the
hour for beginning drill. You can even
go half an hour before the appointed
time and find them all there. And what
a multitude of employments they are
have to set on them, many of the
eggs are broken by the weight of the
ostriches.
All of the males in the smaller cor
r;ils (which have and require stronger
fences) are very fierce and dangerous,
roaring out angrily at the least dis
turbance. Some of them have worn
the feather completely off their breasts
in dashing at the fences in anger at
the teasing of visitors, and one of them
a short time ago, being enraged at an
other male bird which he could not
reach on account of the alley running
between their corrals, turned and at-
tacked his mate and killed her.
There were some rather pretty "lit
tle chicks" of six weeks, about the size
of a turkey, that were running around
in an alfalfa patch and picking up their
living, but. of course, it is not practii -
able to furnish ranges for the larger
ones, and they are fed chopped alfalfa,
beets, corn, etc., with sufficient gravel
to enable them to grind up the food
properly.
The plucking, which takes place once
in nine months, is a most alarming Dro
cess for the birds, as they are driven
into a pen and blindfolded while the
larger feathers are rut off and the
smaller ones which are "ripe" are
pently pulled out, but it is not in the
least painful. In fact, it is to the in
terest of the owner not to injure the
feather sockets, for if that is done the
feathers will never grow i_. again.
The body feathers are shed naturally
once each year, and picked up about
the corrals, and only the large wing
and tail feathers are removed by hand.
The slvrt feathers of ili>' fully grown
male bird are black, and the wing and
tail feathers white, but the poor hen
has to be satisfied with a dismal gray
all her life, :tnd her feathers are of a
much poorer grade also. All of the
females' feathers, and a large portion
of the males', are dyed, for all of the
very long ones are white, and the de
mand for black feathers is greater than
for white.
All of the black ones are also dyed
black, which gives them a very fine
color, much deeper than either white
or gray can be made. Every feather,
when ready for use, really consists of
from three to five feathers, carefully
spliced together, and in the case of ex
treme length, such as Knights Temp
lars' plumes, even more are used.
engaged !n. Some are cleaning and pol
ishing guns, some are practicing the
manual of arms, while others are en
gaged in study. A few can nearly al

It is each one's plan to see hh f '\v quick
he can reach the main truck. And a
most exhilarating exercise this is.
Standing on the deck and drawing a
long breath the young seaman makes*
a run at the rigging and iumps about
five feet from the deck before he
touches it. Moving as rapidly and as
noiselessly as a monkey he seems to
slide up to the lower top. No "lub
ber's hole" for our naval reserve sailor.
He slides over the o-utside as easily as
if he were only a few feet from the '
deck. Standing on the top for a
brief instant he seizes the rigging and
commences to climb again. Up he goes,
passing one yard after another, until
he stands on the topgallant royal and
then commences to climb the mast. At
last he is on the main truck, where all
the world seems to swim beneath him.
But our seaman does not get dizzy.
He simply stays aloft as long as he
wishes and then begins the descent.
This takes less time than the ascent,
for he "slides" a goodly portion of the
way and the last stage of the journey
is made down one of the back stays.
It might seem as if such a bit of ex
NOBLE TITLES
IN LOWLY PLACES
GOING home one night very late,
or rather not very early, for it
was along in the "wee 'sma'
hours," I stopped into a cafe. The
man scrubbing out the place was
the only one about; even the barkeeper
was not in evidence. As he handed me
the bottle and glass he asked me:
"Will you take it neat?"
The "neat," the intonation and the
voice made me look again at the man.
He was tall and fair, but it must be
confessed, both ragged and unclean.
I am an Englishman myself, and
knew in an instant that that intonation
was liable to belong to but one class
o-n the other side, where either a man
is a "gentleman" or he is not. I drew
the man into conversation and asked
him however he came to be doing what
he was. Knowing me to be a country
man, he told me of himself.
It transpired that he was a Cam
bridge man, son of a man who had been
raised to the rank and title of baron
for his services to the Government.
"Yes, and I am the eldest son," he
said, "but I shall have drunk myself
out of the way I hope before my turn
comes to the name and the estate."
Over and again his father had paid
his debts and got him out of drunken
scrapes. Despite the entreaties of the
mother and sisters he was given his
passage money to America, with the
understanding that so long as he re
mained in America $50 a month would
be regularly paid to him, but if he re
mained in or retimed to England he
must shift for himself and by himself,
for his father would have nothing more
to do with him.
He came to San Francisco, changed
his name slightly, and once a month
for a few hours is a rich man. and pays
up the 50-cent and $1 loans which he is
so fortunate to secure during the other
twenty-nine days. For his bed and
food he scrub? out the second-class sa
loon where I found him.
His case is not the only one. Seldom
does it happen that the real "sprig"
divulges his identity; it is the "would
be" who boasts of his connections.
Pride of race and name is part of the
man, as much as eyes and ears, and
ercise would consume considerable
time, but such is not the case, for many
of the boys have been timed and it has
been ascertained that they have made
the trip in less than three minutes.
It is safe to say that few men in our
modern navy can duplicate the feat.
The naval reserve men are drilled in
every branch of work on shipboard.
They know how to splice rope in all of
the mysterious knots dear to the old
seaman's heart, and can handle sail to
perfection even in a gale.
In the ship drill each man is allowed
to do pretty much as he pleases, but in
the artillery and musket drill they are
handled in squads. The musket drill
is little different from that of the in
fantry of the regular army, but the
artillery is. of course, purely naval.
There are two kinds of artillery. The
big guns mounted on the ship and the
small rapid-fire guns that are used by
landing parties when taking a city.
In handling the big guns the Naval
Reserve boys are compelled to work
hard. The guns are heavy and so are
the ramrods and sponges as well as
the '"sham" loads of powder. This drill
never last long, but when it is over the
boys are pretty well warmed up.
The rapid-fire guns are, of course,
lighter to handle, but . the movement
must be quick, and as it is very in
tricate requires the closest attention.
In these drills the guns are sometimes
taken ashore and handled on the dock.
At such times the maneuvers make as
pretty a sight of the kind as it is pos
sible to imagine.
After all the drills for a certain day
are over the boys prepare to enjoy
themselves on shipboard. The cooks'
galley is opened and a big meal of sea
fare prepared. This is spread in the
cabin, where all are sure to partake
heartily. If the weather happens to
be the kind the boys want they lower
the ship's boat and go for a long sail.
But they never leave the ship as
long as there is any branch of the ser
vice they can practice on.
That's the reason they are ready and
willing to go to war.

Another man I knew, son of a Scotch
divine and a branch of one of the
proudest old families of Scotland, of
whom one of the peasants on the estate
said:
"The Queen did well to get her daugh

Highly educated, polished, handsome
In the way young Scotchmen often are,
tall, slender, with the "bonnie blue
een," he had been sent out for the good
of the family. There had been a scan
dal, a woman's name mixed up in it.
He had a wife and two children, and
just simply went abroad. He receives
a monthly allowance, but makes a good
deal by writing. His curse is drink.
One day in a store a lady dropped *Â«.
parcel in front of him. He was more
than half seas over, but a casual ob
server would not have noticed it. He,
however, knew that if he stooped he
would have difficulty in regaining the
vertical.

said, "but the doctor forbids my stoop

Poor woman; she looked at him so
sympathetically, and was about to tel!

ever, is made on another model. He

pened that in the town on the other
side where he found a temporary asy
lum before sailing there was a doctor
with a large family. One son was in
the army and must have his allowance,
but no "dots" were to be had for the
daughters, who were thoroughly educa
ted musicians. It was really a godsend
to one of the doctor's girls when the
young man with the title proposed to
marry her and forego the "dot," saying
they would seek their fortunes together
in the haven across the sea.
They did, and the gratitude the girl
still feels t<~> him for marrying her
without a "dot" I suppose helps to keep
her happy while she supports him by
giving music lessons.

CHARACTER TOLD IN THE SHAPE OF THE HAT THAT YOU WEAR
Here Are the Stones Told of a Number of Well-Known Men by the Little Machine That Reproduces the Shape of the Head Around the Equator of the Cranium.
ONLY four in every one hundred
heads of men prove to be well
balanced in form, and these four
are not perfectly balanced, but
lark symmetry in a slight decree,
bo that it is fair to state that ninety
nine heads out of every one hundred
are out of balance.
This means that Just thi proportion
of men have some eccentricities cor
respond in; c; to that portion of the brain
which is defective.
We are all endowed with two lobes
of brain, the right and left lobes, In
dicated by letters II and L in the il
lustrations. It is generally believed that
the lobes arc identical in size, surface,
curvatures nd indentures, but such is
not the case. Rarely do we find a
head that is balanced and where both
lobes are the same.
There is a machine invented for the
purpose i if reproducing the shape of the
head around the equator of the crani
um, as the dotted line shows in the first
illustration, an.l when *.hus applied the
results are astnnshing.
The straight dotted line through the
center of these charts made by the ma
chine is the line indicating the center
of the cranium, dividing the right and
left lobes, while the mark "X" shows
the forehead.
Crai.iologists claim that a man re
ceives the Ideas of others and impres
sions from the external world with the
left lobe of the brain, but originates
and forms ideas with the right.
Judging from th>- Buccess ;n life of
Mayor .T mes I>. Phelan, his head ought
to be perfectly alanced, but it is not so.
The left lobe "f his brain predominates,
consequently he learns quicker than he
can originate. His head is a lone; one,
show'.ig that h" makes calculations on
"futures" rath' r than the present.
One thing very marked in the forms
of heads is a certain mark or national
ity or race. Those of Irish extraction
invariably have square foreheads, in
dicating leadership. Mayor Phelan's
head shows this plainly.
Those of German extraction have a
larger posterior brain than forehead.
Showing that they enjoy pood food and
drink, and also a trait of generalship.
A Jewish head shows a large, round
ing forehead, well proportioned with
the bark of the head, straight on the
Bides, showing th"ir philosophical ten
dencies and their moral force.
Chris A. Buckley, J he Democratic
politician, has a head quite well bal
anced, ins large forehead shows his
mathematical methods of getting the
right man in the right place and gen
eralship in roundiiiL- up his forces.
Large development on the side of the
head Indicates tenacity with a love of
power and influence, leadership, with
ability to hold together the forces he
organizes. He is also 10-ig-headed and
builds bridges before he crosses
streams.
The head of Attorney W. W. Foote is
one of a different type, it Bhows Ger
man descent by th.- large posterior sur
face. The small forehead Indicates that
he wins by his tenacity and what is
more by his magnetic power which is
furnish-d by the large p..st,:i,, r brain.
This givs him a wonderful person
ality. The side of the head shows his
love for good viands and wine, and
should make him a -hall fellow well
met." He has a large brain surface
when considered as a whole, showing
him to be conscientious, with, a keen in
sight into hidden motives.
W. H. Alford of Visalia. the chair
man of the Democratic State Central
Committee, has a long head, and the
left lobe is the largest, indicating his
susceptibility to another's ideas while
the large bump directly back of the
left ear shows where his fighting qual
ities come in for their maintenance and
success.
Steve Sanguinetti's head shows at a
glance that, as a caterer, he has found
the vocation for which nature Inteqded
him. His well developed sides of the
head indicate his love of g 1 victuals
and wine and his desire that others
Should likewise enjoy the good things
of life.
Isador N. Choynski Is the father of
Choynski, of pugilistic fame, and also
an editor. His head is uncommonly
large and well balanced, showing by the
large forehead and straight sides the
philosophical tendencies of the Jewish
raoe and the force of moral convic
tions.
Rabbi M. 8. Levy's diagram is very
well proportioned. It shows a bump
on the right side, which indicates a
tenacity to the policy he once decides
upon and a continuity of purpose.
The head of Professor Bugene S. Bon
neli is of the long clasp, indicating sent
iment, taste and intellectual capacity
in keeping with the strains of har
mony which he is so capable of im
parting to vocal aspirants.
County Clerk C. F. Curry is also
â¢
troubled with a large left lobe of the
brain, indicating a greater receptivity
of thought.
In Judge Conlan's diagram the lobes
are almost evenly proportioned. The
square forehead marks his Irish de
scent.
His colleague, Police Judge James A.
Campbell, has a different class of head,
resembling that of a pear in form. The
sides of the back part of the head are
large, indicating athletic tendencies,
love of sport and "fair play" in an en
counter in the "manly art." It also
Indicates love of power and influence
and a desire to maintain the good opin
ion of his associates.
The head of \\\ s. HarnÂ»s, the Dis
trict Attorney, is likewise a large one,
fairly well proportioned, well balanced,
philosophical and equal to much men
tal labor.
The outlines of the head of W. H. T.
Durrant were made in 1895. His head
is of the long class, square forehead,
the left lobe is largest and the large
development above the left ear indi
cates wantonness ami destructiveness
Induced by exterior suggestion, not
from any premeditation on his part,
but capable of such when force of sud
den circumstance makes it imperative.
This is so indicated because the right
side of the head is nearly straight.

DEALS IN PEOPLE'S BRAINS.
Major Pond of lecture fame relates some of his most interesting experiences with famous people during
the past twenty years.
IT is sometimes better to make |
mnnoy with other people's brains ,
than with your own. At least this
is Major Pond's experience. During
tho past twenty years the gallant
entrepreneur has been a wholesale
dealer in other people's brains, and the
successes he has met with would make
even a returned Klondiker's mouth
water. The gifted author, the social
>r political celebrity, has a marketable
value as a lecturer nowadays, and it
is Major Pond's business, by means of 'â 
the elaborate organization he has at
his command, to find an outlet for that
commodity.
"I only travel with big people," said
Major Pond during his recent visit
here, "men such as Marion Crawford,
whom I am now running. The small
fry of lecturers, of whom we have hun
dreds on our list, are supplied from our
bureau at New York. Any country
town which wants to enjoy a lecture
can choose whom it will to entertain
them, and we will supply the article
at a given . price, varying, of course,
according to quality.
"Yes, I consider Marion Crawford to
be the biggest lecture success of the
year. You see, he is such a good
spanker, and so many people have read
his books. A man like that don't want
any advertising; people just flock to
hear him wherever he goes. Yet,
strangely enough, Crawford's first tour
in the States four years ago was not
a success. He did not lecture then as
he doe,s now, but read extracts from
his books. Crawford is not a good
reader, and the thing did not go."
"Then you find lectures are more
successful than reading*?"
"Not always; it all depends on the
pors'in. There was Charles Dickens,
the greatest reader we ever had on the
platform. Then Mark Twain and James
Whitcomb Riley have both made great
successes reading from their own
books. And last year I took lan Mac
laren, the famous Scotch writer, "ii an
eight weeks' tour through the States.
He reads extracts from his own Kail
yard stories In the most delightful
way; it would make you weep to hear
him. Of course the Rev. John Wat
son, as a Presbyterian minister, is a
trained speaker, and his Scotch accent
is very slight, not strong enough to be
disagreeable. Maclaren is great busi
ness; at every place we had to turn
crowds away."
The major's estimate of the worth of
the author is based on a simple rule â
on his or her drawing power as a lee-
turer. Yet he insists that, besides be
ing famous as a writer, the author
must be able to speak or read well.
"I have never known but one in
stance," he said, "of a literary celebrity
succeeding on the platform unless he
really could lecture. And that was
Matthew Arnold. No one could hear a
word he spoke, yet the halls were al
ways full. People just went for the
Bake of seeing the great man. And. on
the other hand, it is very difficult for a
celebrity to attract audiences unless he
has already achieved literary fame.
Take the case of Peary, for Instance.
He is a famous Arctic explorer, his
name h;;s resounded all over the coun
try. Also he is a charming speaker;
yet he did not draw well, just because
he has not published a book about his
adventures. Xansen, who is not near
ly so good a speaker as Peary, attract
ed big audiences; his reputation was
made by his books.
"No, the report that Nansen's tour
â was a failure was all wrong. His sea
son \>as cut short simply because of a
disagreement with his managers. If I
had been running him I would have
brought him to this coast.
"My first big success, " went on the
major, growing reminiscent, "was Ann
Eliza Young, the apostate wife of
iJrifiham Young. That was in 1*73. i
took her East to Washington, and her
lectures created such a furor that in
forty-eight hours the anti-polygamy
law was passed. But the king of all
lecturers was the temperance orator,
John E. Oough, whom T managed fT
ten years before his death. His energy
waa marvelous, and altogether he de
livered 9600 addresses to an aggregate
audience cf mne million people.
"The Rev. Henry "Ward Beecher was
the greatest success I have ever trav
eled with. For thirteen years I took
him around, and we coven <1 over 300,000
miles in our Journeyings. The aggre
gate sum taken at his lectures amount
ed to a quarter of a million dollars.
Why, in this city, in 1878, he cleared
$16,000 for four lectures."
Major Pond is very fond of talking
of Beeeher. a fact which Is hardly to |
be wondered at when it is remembered i
that he has traveled farther with him
than with any living man. One of his
stories about the preacher's caustic wit
is good enough to bear repetition. They
were traveling once in a railway car,
and by strange contrast Robert Inger
â oUi the famous atheist, happened to
be among the passengers.
Beecher wrote. two words on the edge
of a newspaper, and then gave the
major a sly nudge.
"I have written Ingersoll's epitaph,"
he whispered. "Here it is: 'Robert
Burns.' "_
Another one of Major Pond's anec
dotes relates to the celebrated actress
Charlotte Cushman, whom he met long
before the days of managerial success.
The major was. but a call boy in a Si.
Louis theater when Charlotte Cushman
was at the zenith of her brilliant career.
Part of his duty was to carry the ac
tress' jewels to and from, the hotel.
On the last day of the engagement, he
fell ill. when Charlotte Cushman, with
kind thoughtfulness, hunted him up
and gave him a $20 gold piece.
"It was the first $20 gold piece I over
earned," says the major. "Long after
ward I met Cushman in Boston, and
gave Her $1000 for one entertainment.
"When I paid her, I told her it was the
interest on that gold piece." *â 
â  Another of the major's favorite . lec
turers was Stanley,, whom he piloted
I during the season of 1890-91. "I gave
Stanley $110,000 for 110 lectures, and
made nearly as much money as he did.
So you can see what a great draw the
great African explorer was. Besides
which, he was a good speaker, his lec
1 tures averaged $2780 each. In this city
his first lecture brought in $3400, his
second $6200."
The- major has the monetary
value of every famous lecturer figured
out almost to a cent. He knows just
what it will pay him to give any one
for a tour. Beecher he paid $300 to
$1000 a lecture, dough from $250 to $500,
and "Wendell Phillips about th> same
price, Of later celebrities lan Mac
laren ranks 1 the highest. He received
a fixed sum of $500 a lecture, and Major
Pond would be Quite willing to renew
the contract on the same terms. An-
I thony Hope comes lower at $200 up
ward, and at one time Max O'Rell, the
French critic, commanded the same
; high terms.
â  Latterly there has been a slump
in Max O'Rell's value. "You see," ex
plained the major, "he has been lectur
. ing for three years now. and has passed
the zenith of his success. 1 would not
care to give more than from $100 to $200
for his lectures. In my opinion o â¢ of
the most successful of Am ri-an au
thors on the platform would be W. D.
Howells. The trouble is that Howells
cannot be induced to lecture; . be ob
jects to the traveling.
HAVANA'S
LAST CIGAR
A special correspondent of The
Call tells how Cuba's magnificent
cigar trade has been completely
ruined by the present war.
HAVANA, April 21, IS9B.â For
nearly two years Cuba has not
raised enough tobacco to sup
ply the island. Tobacco planta-
tions, like the sugar fields. Ue in
ruins. For want of tobacco the cigar
factories of Havana are nearly all idle.
Factories which formerly employed 500
men now employ only fifty. Where
200 Cuban girls used to make a living
at rolling cigars, only twenty are now
at work. The industry is at the point
of death.
Who is responsible? First, Weyler;
second, the Cubans. The captain-gen
eral said: "Thou shalt not make ci
gars." The insurgents replied: "Then
we will destroy the crops."
From the palace in 1896 came the
famous decree forbidding the exporta
tion of Havana leaf tobacco. In the
field followed the burning of the crops
and stored tobacco by the Cubans. A
petition has been recently sent to Cap
tain-General Blanco, asking him to re
voke the decree of his predecessor. His
answer was an emphatic "No."
What actuated Weyler to forbid the
exportation of Havana tobacco? First,
the captain-general, always ready to
adopt stringent measures, believed in
good faith that manufacturers and
dealers in the United States would buy
up all the tobacco in Cuba, and conse
quently oblige all the factories in Ha
vana to close. In this his belief proved
well founded. America.n tobacco deal
ers hastened to buy up all the tobacco
they could get before the decree took
effect. And, of course, all the factor
ies in Havana put up their shutters.
Second, Weyler knew that the Cuban
cigarmakers in Tampa and Key West
each gave $1 a week from their wages
for the cause of Cuba Libre. To pro
hibit the export of tobacco, therefore,
would throw these Tampa and Key
West cigarmakers out of employment
and deprive the insurgents of that im
portant source of revenue. Conse
quently, in the Florida cigar towns
there were soon hundreds of idle, half
starving Cubans.
Third, Weyler was a gold grabber. Ho
loved to make money. He made it.
He was a millionaire when he left
Cuba. lam told that this famous to
bacco decree netted him a fortune.
Many so-called American tobacco
firms exported BeveraJ thousand bales
of tohacco in spite of General Weyler's
prohibitive decree, under the pretense
that it was the outcome of diplomatic
transactions between Washington and
Madrid. lÂ»ut the real secret in the af
fair was that Weyler by charging com
mission on every bale exported gra
ciously gave permission for shipments
to be made. Thus Weyler made money
as he waged war.
The province or county of Vuelta
Abajo is, or rather was, Cuba's prin
cipal tobacco center. It might have
been called Cuba's Klondike. But to
day every tobacco plantation in Vuelta
Abajo is in ruins, abandoned. The di
rect cause of this wholesale destruction
was Weyler's tobacco decree. All the
farmers, farm hands, dealers and per
sons directly or indirectly engaged in
raising or dealing in tobacco had hith
erto been sacred to the insurgents; all
tobacco property was respected, in di
rect contrast to sugar plantations.
No sooner was Weyler's decree known
In Vuelta Abajo than the rebels
changed their tactics. The sacred plant
was attacked with fury. Over 400,000
bales of tobacco (approximating 40,000,-
000 pounds) were destroyed in 1896 and
1597 in Vuelta Abajo, and the war on
the weed continues to the present day.
In 1897 very little tobacco was gath
ered, representing not one-tenth of the
normal crop. Even this small percent
age was grown in the yards of houses
in well fortified villages; and in the
much-talked-abnut Zonas dt^ Cultiv..,
which were designed by General VWy
ler for the planting of vegetables for
the unfortunate reconcentradoa,
It will take at leant twenty years be
fore Vuelta Abajo can again be in as
flourishing condition as in January,
1896. Not even if the war should come
to an end could it regain its former
wealth in a shorter period. Whole vil
lages and towns have been destroyed,
and SO per cent of the population hag
perished. Even genuine autonomy
would not much benefit the tobacco
trade of Cuba, since Spain is under ?<>
many obligations to the Compania Gen
eral de Tabacos, a monopoly in that
country, from which the Government
derives an enormous revenue. Abso
lute independence alone can help mat
ters.
The condition of things in the cigar
factories of Havana could not be more
hopeless. Here is a statement made
by the head of the leading cigar fac
tory one year ago: "In the depart
ment devoted to the preparation of raw
tobacco we employ 500 men and 2"
men. Average daily production
pounds. In the cigar-making depart
ment we employ 200 men and 100 wo
men. Average daily output 1,000,000
cigars."
All the best Havana cigars are ex
ported. Havana itself must be con
tented with a second-rate smoke at a
first-rate price. Half the cigar stands,
formerly flourishing, are now boarded
up. Half of the cigar .stands still do
ing business are stocked, very meaerer
ly, with a genuine lot of poor cigars.
.Moreover, a leading New York cigar
manufacturer, now in Havana, tells me
that half the cigars sold here and in
the States as "clear Ilnvanas" are
made of Virginia tobacco. The raw ma
terial is sent direct from Virginia to
Porto Rico. At Porto Rico it is re
packed and shipped to Havana as na
tive Porto Rico tobacco. In Havana
native Porto Rico tobacco from Vir
ginia is made into cigars and sent back
to the States as "dear Havana*. '
The natives here are unanimous in
their opinion that the Cuban cigar in
dustry is doomed. Their opinion is
founded on the faots just given. It
looks entirely probable that in a few
months this city will have on exhibi
tion, draped in mourning, a curiosity
labeled "Havana's Last Cigrar."
GILSON WILLETS.GOING THE ROUNDS WITH THE CITY-MISSIONARY
THE city missionary and I alight
from the Ingleside car in the
dust of a genuine country road,
and make our way slowly
through turnstiles and along
footpaths to a broad and shaded ave
nue, which would !"â  beautiful were it
nol that one side >>f it is a. glacial
precipice of whitewashed wallâ a bar
rier built by Bociety I tween adjudged
offenders against its laws and those
who have been fortunate enough not
to offend or to have escaped convic
tion.
To meet us comes loping a tall young
fellow, with a figure of an athlete, and
a fresh, smiling, well-featured face.
"We were on the lookout for you,
sir," he says, raising his battered hat
as he reaches us, and instantly reliev
ing Mr. Tubbs smarting hands and
aching arms of their load. And then,
as he strides on before us, I notice,
with a queer little shock at my heart,
that one leg of his dusty overalls is
bright blue ar.d the other a yellow
brown.
I came out here to City Prison No.
2 for the express purpose of seeing a
portion of Ban Francisco's prisoners,
and I know, now that I have noticed
his garb, that he is one of them, but
that frank face and those honest eyes
seem strangely out of place in such a
livery.
Before we reach the office I discover
that it is only the outside working bees
in this hive that wear these diversi
.i. aims. The others, no matter
what fashion of garment covers the up
per portion of their bodiesâ and they
range from the unobtrusive and insuf
:: undervest to the nattiest of top
wear trousers of wide black and
irish gray stripes, which, running
â ndicularly, give , the impression
that a universal characteristic of these
sinners against society is the possea
i abnormally long and slender
legs and a general Brownie-like per
sonality.
I have not been a guest oi the place

that the unhandsome lower gar

from making mistakes embarrassing

in a prison garden, the sunshine that
brightens the room sifts in through i'.*.n

of a paucity of tips.
Lunch over we go out into the ro

the beginning of our conversa

University, what a noted French
writer said recently â that he re

h i that he could appreciate
the literature of those languages.
Dr. Patton said that the study of
Greek and Latin was not alone valua

noticeable that at the sound of the
missionary's deep bass voice singing
"Loving Kindness" a respectful silence
settles down upon all within hearing
and continues, with few and quickly
frowned Interruptions, until the in
formal "talk," which constitutes the
rest <>f the service, and contains much
friendly advice and warning, and is on
the whole helpful and hopeful, is over.
Then comes the distribution of the
papers, ajid I learn as we make the
rounds of the cells what, in the esti
mation of the inmates of City Prison
No. 2, are, outside of mental pabulum,
the two greatest needs of imprisoned
humanity. They are stamped envel
opes and spectacles. From nearly
every cell comes a plea for the first,
and dozens of men beg for those aids
to vision with which, in a cheap but
apparently highly satisfactory form, I
find that the experienced missionary's
pockets fairly bristle.
"I want to write to my mother" â

that is the cry all up and down the
lines. "She doesn't know that lam in
here and she'll worry about me."
One, of mere original turn of mind
than his companions in detention, de
clares that it is his grandmother
whom he desires to apprise of his
whereabouts, but not a prisoner states
that he wishes t<> communicate with
his father or any male relative, or
a wife. I notice, however, that while
printed matter is distributed with im
partial genen.-sity. stamps and specta
cles are bestowed with nice discrimina
tion.
"A stamp will buy a cigarette," ex
plains the missionary, "and spectacles
are sound currency also. I have t<> be
careful." But knowing his work and
his men, I d<>ubt if he leaves unsup

either.
The "hypo ward" is nearly full and
the row of wretched, tremulous, chalk- ;
faced creatures stretch out eager, in
sistent hands to us as we pass, and ad
dress us as "brother" and "sister" in i

that he has found his Latin and Greek
of less value that the modern lan
guages, I am sure if he were
ng the Romance languages â
French, Spanish and Italianâ he
would find his Latin of great bene
fit, because these languages are de
rived from the Latin directly. But any

up In a comparatively short time, and
with the expenditure of little effort, if
he chose.
"The question of substituting the
study of the modern for the dead lan
guages is Btill In controversy, but I be
lieve that the movement la losing in-
Ste id of gaining strength."
Speaking of the amount of matter
studied which the mind stored up, Dr.
patton said that man's mind was like
ly t < Â« retain what was interesting to it
of what it studied or read.
"In reading Tennyson," he said, "I
may put by in my memory the lines
that I think are worth remembering.
The others I am willing to forget as
soon as I have read them."
"Speaking of Tennyson," I said, "is
it not remarkable that this generation
has not one great poet?"
"It is a fact," said Dr. Patton. "We
are left to choose between Williara
Watson, who poetizes on poetry, and
Rudyard Kipling. Not that I would be
little Mr. Kipling, for I think that if
he ever becomes serious, he may still
do something worthy. In tact, he has
done something recently which seems
to bear the mark of inspiration. Hi*

the Queen's Jubilee. Thousands were
striving for something worthy of the
occasion, and Mr. Kipling seemed to do
without effort what all the others had

I am glad that Brother Tubb beckons
me to rejoin him at this moment. Some
way, in the subdued light that fill, rs
in through the barred windows the
man's fare looked to me like that of a
hunted, wounded, helpless, but still fe
rocious animal, and such an animal,
however much one may pity it, is
neither pleasing nor desirable company.

I traverse the dark central corridors
and behold on either hand the "peep
that we lack a great poet. This Is an
age of second-class men. When Bis
marck and Gladstone have pas^ I
away, what really great man will be
left? The periods of greatness in lit
erature or statesmanship are recurrent.
The Elizabethan ago was a marked pe
riod; the early Victorian era gave us
many men great in statecraft and lit
erature. We have fallen on a barren
time now. Augustine Birrell phrased
it very well when he said that the only
men who had anything to say were sci
entists, and they did not know how
to say it; and the only men who knew
how to say anything were the literary
men, and they had nothing to say."
I asked Dr. Patton if he believed
there was a decadence in literary taste
caused by the enormous output of
trashy, commonplace books.
"There is no doubt of it," he said,
"though the taste for more seric-us
reading lias been fostered in a great
many ways, notably through the uni
versity extension movement. That the
ratio of readers of good literature has
changed for the worse I am not pre
pared to admit Of course the char
acter of serious literature has changed.
We have a more instructive literature
covering the range of philosophy, of
political economy, of the sciences. The
serious literature of to-day is much
more serious than that of the last gen
eration."
"Is it possible to lay out a course of
reading for any class of men, or for
men in general?"
"No. Every man must choose his

is the outward expression of himself.

seen themselves, can at any time com
mand a full view of the interior of each
cell, and I am told that this despicable
arrangement is necessary to good pris
on discipline. Perhaps it is, I am only
an outsider and cannot be expected to
understand such matters, therefore I
do not argue the question; but I know
in my heart that it would not make me
better either in act or disposition to
look at or be looked at by my fellow
creatures in this way.
Later I see the prisoners form in line
and march down in Indian file to their
dinners and the sight reminds me of the
dreadful procession of Lourdes, only
these are all men or youths and their
deformities and diseases are of the
mind and not of the body. Each car
ries a tin cup and spoon, and finds
awaiting him on the desk-like tables
which make the long dining hall look
grotesquely like a school-room an ob
long tin pan of stew, three or four
potatoes as yet unjacketed and a small
loaf of bread.
"We can have more If we wish," I
am told confidently, and since this
seems to be considered a cause for con
gratulation I openly and decidedly ap
prove. : v^-f . â¢
Upstairs, as , we go out, ,we meet a
rather handsome young man with a
slight limp, who flushes at sight of me
and flushes more deeply still at the
missionary's rough but kindly meant
words. ' .
"All of the prisoners here,". he says,
sententiously, "are not criminals; some
of them are only fools. This is one of
the fools."
I make inquiries of the fool concern
ing the particular piece of folly which
made him an' unwilling boarder at the
city's expense, and shamed him with
the fashion of his lower garments, and
I learn that he is one of the "exam
ples" which gallant Judge Campbell
made for the benefit of men addicted
to the reprehensible practice of "sass
ing" feminine bicycle riders.
It is but a step across to the female
prison, and we find the femalesâ quite
undertaking to read as a duty the full !
list of 'the best 100 books' prepared by
any one."
Recently Chauncey M. Depew said in
an interview which I had with him |
that he believed the college-trained !
man had an advantage in business over !
the man who was self-educated. I
asked Dr. Patton what his personal
observation on this subject taught him.
"The self-educated business man who
has been successful, not alone as a !
money-maker, but as a leader of men," j
he said, "is a man gifted with an ab- l
normally large brain. It is not always |
the good fortune of the sons of rich !
men to inherit that advantage of their
fathersâ ln fact it is the exception. \
Therefore the ass .mption of some sue- !

premises. There is no doubt that col- '
lege training prepares a man for the i

all other things being equal. It gives
him a broader view and enables him to j
see the inter-relation of thingsâ to un- ,
derstand that nothing stands by itself.

fancy the university man may object
to doing the ordinary duties which be

'cocky' about beginning at the bottom

a number of them â expecting us sealed
on three or four benches, in one of the
large cell-bordered rooms, before a
stand and two chairs deferentially
awaiting our arrival. They are mostly
middle aged and old women who have
elected to praise God in our company
this afternoon, at least they look so,
though there be not a few who have
neither gray hair nor many wrinkles.
There is one small person in a red
wrapper, and a cream-complexioned
little body weighted down with an ag
gressive black eye in the greenery
yallery stage, who might pass for
young in other surroundings, but here
they look almost as old as sin itself,
poor things!
Queer, isn't it? but nearly every in
dividual one of these daughters of Eve,
secluded though they are from the
admiring gaze of man, are either in the
bud or the full" bloom of frizzes, and
one of them has her locks twisted in
that abomination of abominations, a
"tea-pot handle," on the very top of
her imprisoned but still haughty head. !
Indeed, "art for art's sake" flourishes
here, or is it only an outward and visi
ble sign of woman's inborn desire to
outshine her sisters, that makes them
worry their locks when they might be j
giving them the rejuvenating rest I
which our Judges have decreed they
shall themselves experience?
There are twenty-five out of the sixty '
inmates who have chosen the better j
part to-day, and they listen with real
interest to the Bible reading and the 'â¢
short discourse, and assist with more
or less tuneful voices in the singing of j
the hymns. Brother Tubb may talk,
perhaps, a little above their heads, but
it is plain that they like him heartily
and that his words and his manner give '
back to them a little of the self-respect, ;
the loss of which brought them here.
Just before the dose of the meeting
a woman brings in an enormous bou
quet and lays it with a courtesy on the
table before the missionary, and the en
tire congregation straightens up in its
seats as one woman and smilingly

more quickly than ho possibly could
while he remained under the restric

"Undoubtedly," he answered. "We
can observe that in the contrast be
tween the home students â those who
live in Princeton and come here to
school â and the boys who come a thou
sand miles to live here during the
term."
I asked Dr. Patton what degree of
liberty should be allowed to a student
at college.
"The investment of the student with
the franchise of his manhood is a slow
process," he said. "Here at Princeton
we stand toward the student in th 3 po
sition of the parents or guardians at
Least we feel that to be our duty.
Therefore we keep careful watch and
ward over the young men who come to
us., and if we find them becoming ad
dicted to any vice we at once notify
those who have sent them here. Wo
want to know where the student sp- nds
his time and how he spends it. And it
is "in the possession of this knowledge
that we find ourselves able to main
tain the morale of the college itself.
"In his home the boy is surrounded
by walls of paterna/iism. When he
reaches college he finds he is compar
atively independent. The freshman
finds in his new independence an op
portunity sometimes to take a big
loaf, and often he finds too late that
he has lost his year. Perhaps this
teaches him a lesson and in the end is
a benefit, but we constantly strive
.against this in the first year, because
that is in a measure the crucial period,
the one in which the undergraduate
gains unhampered his first lesson in
the life of the world.
"I think it is not the province of the
college to do aught which would not
stowal of the offering. I am as noth
ing in comparison with Brother Tubb.
and not the smallest blossom falls to
my share, but there is one tenderly
sympathetic heart beating behind the
regulation blue and white calico, and it
is owned by a pleasant-faced woman
whom I have observed, out of the cor
ner cf my eye, surreptitiously eating
peppermint lozenges behind her hymn
book at intervals during the service.
To me she comes as soon as she can
decorously leave her seat and presses
two of those aromatic confections into
my grateful hand.
"You are more than welcome." she
says, beamingly, as I strive to express
my thanks.
Soon Kate Gallagher â "Kate, the
Window Smasher," Kate, whom long
suffering policemen freely call "Kate
the Cursed" â separates herself from
the eager group who are besieging their
generous visitor for the much-desir. >1

who have gathered about my chair.

she disapproves. "I'd rather steal

Two minutes later she corners the

quisition for a dress waist, declaring
that because of certain acts of the ju

of two of these necessary adjuncts to

the ability to grasp the affairs of life
in a large way, to consider the world
on a basis of wide scope. I think the
modern tendency is in the direction of
promoting: all these things, and it
seems to me there is no agent so pow
erful in this regard as the training
which one receives in college. It is
folly to say that college life is not ben
eficial to any one. This must be borne
in mind: It is not so much what we
learn in college as the training of the
mind that is received, the ability to
concentrate thought that is imparted.
It seems to me that nothing is more
Impossible than that the mind of a man
who has picked up his knowledge in a

resourceful, as the mind of the man

"'This is the liberalism of student
life. In this way college equips a man
for whatever his life may be when he
goes into the world. Too many people
fail to distinguish between liberality
and uprightness and narrow-minded
ness. Broad-minded liberality is an
evidence of enlightened progress. "We
believe that in Princeton. We try to
impress II upon the minds of the un
dergraduates."
"Is the religious spirit among the
students strong?"
"Despite the assertions that are
some times made, my observation im
presses me with the fact that the un
dergraduate is no less religious than
he was. On the contrary lam inclined

"You're far too little," she says, suc
cinctly at length.
Kate has a tine figure of her own,
barring it is a trifle too generous about
the waist, and a dress must be planned
on large lines to <!â > ber justice, but
she wins a vague "I'll see what I can
do" from her captive, and then re
leases him to accompany me on my
tour of sight-seeing through the buDd
lng.
I see it all from the kitchen to the
"dark cells," which are not dark, in
which refractory prisoners occasion
ally spend a few meditative hours.
"There are no very hard cases here,"
says the matron, "just drunks and
small offenders, and they behave pretty
well generally, but they will quarrel
among themselves, and then we have
to separate them, of course, and punish
the one who is to blame."
Some way the place, with this excep
tion, looks very little like a prison.
Blue and white wrappers have a cozlly
domestic appearance, and are often
worn in the most respectable of fami
ly circles, therefore they have not the
same depressing effect on my spirits
as the striped trousers have, and, be
sides, women adapt themselves to cir
cumstances better than their brothers.
"Some of them come back over and
over," says the matron, a trifle wear
iedly. "They seem to look upon it as
a home rather than a place of punish
ment, and the regular hours, the plain
but sufficient food, and the enforced
abstinence from liquor of all kinds are
really beneficial. It seems more like
a sanitarium to them than a discipli
nary establishment."
And really, why, since modern
thought recognizes that drunkenness
and crime are diseases, should it not
be so?
It is dark in the Broadway Jail, even
though the hand of the house painter
has tinted the walls of tho courts of a
light and heavenly blue. The bars are
heavy, the cell doors are of solid black
iron and the faces which peer at us
through the small oblong holes therein
are nearly all of them shadowed by an
xiety or foreboding. This is a place of
uncertainty, for here persons accused
of the graver crimes await their trials,
or being adjudged guilty take their de
partures for the grimmer prisons,
â where sentences are measured by terms
of years or by life-times.
Here, as elsewhere, the missionary's
coming meets with a warm welcome,
but here the coveted gift, outside of
reading matter, is not. spectacles, but
candles. Most of these men are young
â God pity them! â and their eyes are
good, but it grows dark early in the
box-like cells. "And when one cannot

the prisoners' hands seem to bo pallid
here â waving about in those dark
apertures where hands and faces may
not, In the nature of things, appear at
the same time. When the hands are
withdrawn and the faces take their
place the effect is ptill more unearthly,
for the human face, the eyes and nos*
and mouth, entirely separate and dis
tinct from hair and ears and neck, pre
sents a rather ghastly picture against
a background of midnight blackness.

their confidants and friends!

SKETCHED PICTURES IN ONE MINUTE
LAST week a party of men left
the Orpheum annex, walked down
O'Farrell street, up Grant avenue
and through Chinatown. Many a
party had gone over the same
route, but this 'one was of particu
lar Interest and there was a good-sized
"jack-pot" at stake on the result of the
trip.
Every few blocks the party stopped,
and then all interest centered In the cen
tral figure, who with brush and artist's
j..;j;cr hurriedly began to sketch, while
his companions craned their necks to
watch the results of his work. The artist
in question was Rudinoff, whose work at
the OBphouni has delighted thousands
during the past three weeks. The queer
proceedings of the party came about in
this wis< .
During the afternoon Fred Fowler,
treasurer of the Orpheum Company, to
gether with a number of the Orpheum
artis's and a few outsiders, were seated
in the annex. Conversation drifted to
matters theatrical and during the dis
cussion Rudinofl and hi? act came under
criticism. Some on<Â» classed him as a
"foreign fakir," which remark Xir. Fow

explanatory tones. "When they were

Utter nonsense."
"How long did you study, Mme.
Melba?"
"1 studied under Marehesi just ten
months, and then appeared in Brussels
in 'Rigoletti. 1 That was ten years ago.
But while I have had in all only ten
months' instruction it has always been
constant study and personal applica

"The strain of my work makes it im

and see, am I not a nervous wreck?"
Assuredly not if one is to judge from
outward appearances. For Mme. Melba,
with the long folds of her dressing
gown adding to her height and show
ing the outline of her beautiful figure,
her head thrown back, looked any
thing but a wreck.
"Oh", but I am," she repeated.
"Will you tell me why, Mme. Melba,
when there are so many with beauti

for which they sigh?"
"Lack of brains." answered Mme.
Melba without a moment's hesitation.
"There are many with beautiful voices,
but few with beautiful voices and

'brains.'
"For those who have the voice and
the brains there is no obstacle that
cannot be surmounted. Those who, de

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 24, 1898.
OUT of the ORPHAN ASYLUM
and INTO the WORLD
Probl.-ms That the Children Who Are Raised in the nig Institutions
Uave to Contend With.
LAST week another little grlrl
found life"s path too rough and
tried to open the gate. out.
She had been brought up, or,
rather, had grown up, at an
orphan asylum. Did it prepare her
properly for the problem of life?
At the asylum are about 200 children,
boys and girls, from iy 2 to 14 years of
age. Governed by a board of managers
nominally, but really by a matron, it is
supported by the State, by the parents
of the children and by the institution.
The place is a little world by itself.
Even the language most of the little
ones use among themselves is so full
of localisms that a stranger might have
difficulty in grasping the child's idea.
For instance, "teany" means small;
"snordel" Is to cry"; "custard" is sick;
"nip" is to steal; "nitten" is to He, and
they require a word of their own;
"potty" is dirty, and so on through
scores of more words not down In the
dictionary.
A new family entered, four German
children from what must have been
a very happy home. The smallest, a
baby just beginning to walk, was under
the entrance age, but the circumstanoes
were too urgent for rules.
"Oh, what teany; I wish Bha has
spoos of her own. All the home's are
too ganty" â which construed, meant
that the baby was too email to wear
the institution clothing.
The four little strangers, of different
ages, were placed in the several de
partments, and began life over again,
each fur himself.
The children gathered around the
eldest boy and proceeded to get ac
quainted.
"Is your father dead?"
"No."
"Mine is. He was shot. Policeman
shot him* Mother dead?"
"Tes"â and the tears started in the
sensitive brown eyes.
"Say, what you doing- that for? It
don't do no good. How did she dip?
Sam's had fits and rolled on the floor
and lucked. Did yours do like that?"
"No; she just died, and said she
wished she could take the baby with
lier."
"Her that's here? L.ots better off.
No fun to be died. Father rich?"
"I don't know."
And so the young teasers continued
:ill the novelty wore off, and the little
"ellow submitted and cried his heart-
Uckness out till he really fell ill.
His younger brother, however, took
matters into his own hands and
thrashed a boy or two, and so became
a hero.
After a time th*>y nearly all become
contented and march in the long line
to chapel 'when the bell calls; they
kneel at another bell to say "Our Fa
ther," at another bell rise.
Sometimes it takes half a dozen at
tempts before the tall, stern woman
who presides is satisfied with the man
ner of kneeling and rising. Woe be to
the small boy ur girl whose heavy shoes
make noise enough to attract her sharp
car.
They form in line and march in and
out of the dining-room. So many
together makes silence the one thing
most carefully attended to. On Christ
mas and Thanksgiving they are al
lowed to talk during meals and they
are brilliant occasions in their way, but
children are not satisfied with love by
the wholesale. The dry cakes and
cheap toys brought on Friends' day
really mean something to them. There
is no other change In the weekly order
of fare and if you ask a little tot what
day of the week It is he will 6ay:
"We had puddin 1 ; it must be Wednes
day."
Friends' day is the greatest day in
the month fur the children. On that
occasion they wear their own clothes,
if they have any, instead of the uni
form, with clean fronts, and in the af
ternoon receive their friends. That
is, if they have any. Of many it is
only too true what the more fortunate
ones say:
"What's the use of putting a clean
apron on her? She has no friends."
Such a washing of faces and brush
ing and curling of hair, and every
available ribbon which can be bor
rowed or hired for some of "what my
friends bring me." And after all
the careful preparations, so many times
no one comes and then follows the lit
tle tragedy of waiting and watching
the others.
One charitable lady, who was Inter
ested in one of the little girls, sent her
word to bo ready and she would have
the child spend the holidays with her.
She sent 10 cents with directions for
the girl to have some powder and make
her teeth nice and clean. Little Mag
gie almost wore out her tooth brush,
went over all her little belongings over
and over and planned with the others
how she would not have to wear her
apron. Then she tried every ribbon
she could get on her short hair, promis
ing to write to all the girls. She is an
orphan and absolutely without a rela
tive in the world or a friend, except
this one lady.
School closed. Maggie could not
sleep that night with anticipation,
could not eat, and eat on the wood
window seat all day watching the gate.
The next day it began to occur to her
may be she would not go, and she put
away all her things and never spoke of
her disappointment, for she not only
was not sent for, but the charitable
lady had forgotten all about Maggie.
Many tableaux in real life form them
selves there.
Dr. John Nightingale Jr. is the regu
lar physician, so it goes without say
ing that the sanitary matters are the
best that can be made. The food is
usually good, notwithstanding the mo
notony, and the children are comforta
bly and exceedingly well clother and
housed. Those requiring special treat,
ment are taken to specialists and you
may have seen a long line of may be
twenty-five boys in brown uniform
going; to Dr. Montgomery. They are
the "soreheads." Ringworm is the
foundation of the trouble, which is not
dangerous to life, but is very contag
ious, and being^on the head is very.
very unpleasant. A very determined
effort was made to banish it. which, if
persevered in intelligently would have
been successful, but unfortunately the
vigilance ber-n relaxed.
On Sundays in fresh, neat uniforms
the older children march to the Church
of the Advent. The Rev. Mr. Emery
is much interested in them, seeing them
once a week at church, and they are
much interested in the services and
give the closest attention and the most
devout responses. Irreverence would
"LOOK UPON
THESE PICTURES"
THE portrait show at the Hopkins
Institute of Art is a success.
Ordinarily portraits are not very
attractive to a disinterested party,
and it always jars upon one's ar
tistic sensibilities to see them
hung in a drawing-room or even
In the living-room of a house where
they act with all the other pictures aa
a decorative motive.
It would seem that the portraits of a
household should belong exclusively to
the family, and not be open to the
scrutiny of all who are admitted. A
portrait is such a personal affair and
it satisfies in proportion as it repre
sents that particular phase of charac
ter by which the subject was known.
The thoughtless remarks of a casual
visitorâ who may have known the sit
ter under different conditions â may un
settle an appreciative judgment of a
canvas and disturb the prospects for
its future enjoyment.
But while a few portraits looking
down from a wall may not create much
interest, a collection of portraits in
which there are examples of many
known and some famous artists is quite
another matter. To be able to study
the products of local artists of different
periods of time, to note wherein our
present coterie have progressed be
yond the group who preceded them or
have not as yet attained to the excel
lencies of the famous, is a rare oppor
tunity of which all who have any in
terest in art should avail themselves.
There are artists and there are paint
ers. Sometimes a great artist may
not be clever as a painter and a very
clever painter may not be much of an
artist. It may be said of the Fritz
August Kaulbach. who is the author of
the beautiful portrait of Miss Neu
stadter, that ho is much more of a
painter than his celebrated uncle, Wil
helm Yon Kaulbach, but not so great
an artist.
In the Denner, loaned by Mrs. de
Young, we find an illustration of un
usual painting. This artist is noted
for his exceedingly patient, toilsome
and accurate finish. He copies nature
with such scrupulous fidelity that every
undulation, every tint and even the
slightest down of the skin will bear in
spection through a microscope. He
makes a hair seem round and gives
perspective of the slightest wrinkle.
While this kind of painting may not
be high art there is a spirit of conscien
tious effort apparent that might well be
emulated by some of the artists of this
generation, and while the excellence of
a portrait is not to be estimated by the
realistic painting of a satin gown, of
the illusion that reveals an arm, or of
the point lace collar, all of which so
frequently holds the public eye, still
the subordinate parts of a canvas
should receive some consideration.
There is a wide difference between a
clever suggestion and a careless, im
perfect representation.
There are entirely too many heads
and hands emerging from hollow coats,
and the imagination of the spectator
is too frequently calle 7 upon to sup
ply deficiencies in the different appoint
ments of the picture.
The Boldini portrait of Miss Ethel
Crocker is receiving much attention,
especially from professionals. Inch by
inch the canvas is being dissected and
the general verdict Is "clever, very
clever."
The Romney canvas, which is doubt
less a good example of this celebrated
painter's work, is well worth serious
study. This artist was the successful
rival in portraiture of Sir Joshua Rey
nolds.
Two heads by Benjamin West and a
portrait of himself by Greuze have at
tracted considerable attention, while a
very pleasing study of a young woman
by Henry Inman has been generally
admired.
Two examples of the Rubens school
commend themselves to the student on
not wait till the next world for pun
ishment and he who will not sing is
made to sing.
Going to church is the only regular
opportunity to see the outside world
except for a dozen or so of the older
ones, who- ere in public schools, and for
those under eight or ten particularly
years come and go, but the gate in the
gray wall never opens for them. Each
department has its own portion of play
ground, the big boys gardens and
bunks, but the gTeater portion of the
enclosure is given up to the beautifully
kept Harden which makes such an at
tractive entrance to the visitor.
One girl of 13 years entered the in
stitution almost a baby. She was good
with children and is now kept as the
kindergarten assistant. As she was not
a public school girl she was to have a
momentous treat. She was to be al
lowed by very special permission to ac
company one of the attendants to Oak
land. Her delight and anticipation
were unbounded. She counted the
hours and wished Saturday would ever
come. Her ignorance of ordinary things
in the big world would be something
astonishing to a traveler.
"How do you expect the ferry can
carry you and Miss Brown over at the
same time?" said one of the girls,
quizzically.
"Well, she will have to go over first
and wait on the other side for me, I
suppose we both at o^ne time would
sink the boat."
Another girl said to her:
"Elsie, you will have to fill your
pocket with stones to throw at the
Chinamen."
"But I might hurt them."
"Well, all the managers do that, so
you will have to."
Another urchin "who had had experi
ence suggested:
"When you see a policeman you al
ways have to 'duck out" or he'll know
the uniform and take you up and put
you in the patrol wagon and bring you
home."
She went at last and was much dis
appointed when she came home be
cause "It was just like going to church.
Nothing awfully exciting happened."
in a few months more Elsie, an or

world, will begin the struggle. To such
a child the problem, "When I get out of

things. Can you fancy her position?
account of their rich coloring, while not
far from them are two very funny
portraits of women, dated 1600, which
testify very forcibly to the lack of dress
reform in those days.
Besides these mentioned there are
canvases signed by Hogarth, Sully
Gerard, Gilbert Stuart. Â±Â»arbus, Leutze
and many others marked unknown, all
of which are well worth examining.
Portraits to the student are interest-
Ing from several points of view. Their
first mission is, of course, to truthfully
represent the sitter. . To get a like
ness as regards physical, appearance as
well as character is no easy matter.
Then painters are very apt to picture
their own characteristics in the can
vases, and logically so, for no one can
express more than he sees, and we are
told we generally see our own qualities
rellected in others. Some artists live
beautiful lives, have a state of being
that enables them to give a spiritual in
terpretation to everything they study.
On their canvases we find only the
higher attributes of human nature rep
resented; while others who do not live
on such a high plane of thought and
action generally portray only the phy
sical characteristics of their patrons.
The gu.'. between spiritual loveliness
and sensuous beauty is deep and wide,
and can only be bridged by that insight
which comes from high thinking and
right living.
The style of an artist is as individual
as his handwriting. Some painters are
versatile, but in all the varieties of
their work the intelligent eye detects
the same characteristis.
No one paints like Mr. Yates, ana
while there are such marked degrees of
merit in his different portraits, the rich
color, the vigorous handling indicate
the artist. While much of his work is
masterful, his portraits of Misses Sulli
van and Kittle are also beautiful.
And Mr. Vos' conception and treat
ment are entirely his own. His four
canvases, which have had a liberal
share of criticism, are, on account of
their picturescjue treatment and posi
tive color, very popular.
One can always recognize Mr.
Strong's conscientious and able work.
His seven canvases show not only some

SAM WALTER FOSSHOW TO SUCCEED
AS A DETECTIVE
"You Must Have Nat
ural Aptitude, Ple
nty of Brains and an
Almost Inexhausti
ble Fund of Perse
verance. '
By Ex-Chief Thomas Byrnes.
TO become a successful detective
a young man must have, first of
all, natural aptitude; then,
plenty of brains, and last, but far
from least, an almost inexhausti
ble fund of perseverance. With
out all of these qualifications he may
grow to be a satisfactory or even an
excellent policeman, but he can never
hope to be a successful detector of
crime.
If a man is cut out for detective
work the fact will manifest itself at an
early age. I don't mean that every
young fellow who soaks his mind in
so-railed "detective" literature is a pre
ordained detective. Quite the reverse.
Nothing is so harmful to a good ca
reer in my chosen profession as an ac
quaintance with trashy works of this
character.
I remember that, when I was a lad,
my mental tendencies ran toward in
vestigation. Although I didn't know
it at the time, that was a good sign
for my future success. For instance,
the eggs of a neighbor of ours were
found smashed and destroyed at irreg
ular but frequent intervals. The
people of the district were divided as
to whether spiteful acquaintances or
the hens themselves were in the habit
of doing the smashing.
Now. I knew very well that the own
ers of those eggs were simple, honest
folk, without any enemies; and I also
felt sure that, although one or even two
of the hens might be unnatural par
ents, the entire feathered population of
that henhouse would not be likely to
develop a mania for egg destruction.
The puzzle bothered me, and for two
nights I slept in the loft, overlooking
the henhouse, on the lookout for a so
lution. The solution came, too. Late
on the second night a red Irish setter
c.f our own Jumped in through the open
window and proceeded to amuse him-
Ff-lf by chasing the hens hither and
thither, at the same t'me crushing all
the new laid eggs which happened to
be beneath his paws. I collared the
culprit in short order, and ever after
ward the henhouse window was board
ed up. That was my first piece of de
tective work.
As to a practical way by which to
Btart upon a detective career I am
Bomewhat in doubt. Perhaps the real
truth is that there is no royal road.
I myself began as an ordinary police
patrolman on December 10, 1863, but
it is a moot question whether routine
patrol work has its advantages. In
one sense it is a detriment, in another
a benefit. The man In uniform has
little chance of getting to know crim
inalsa particularly useful possession
for the detective. His brass buttons are
a warning sign; and all the thieves,
bunko men and the like give him a
wide berth.
On the other hand the patrolman's
life gives a young man habits of disci
pline and obedience. Then, too, a
lucky chance may give a patrolman
the opportunity of showing certain
talents which will win him a place on
the regular detective force. During my
incumbency of the detective force
chiefshlp it was my habit to keep a
sharp lookout for promising young pa
trolmen. If I learned of any such I
sent for them and gave them a month's
trial. During the month they had the
power and the time to show the sort
of stuff they were made of. I believe the
same custom is In vogue in the police
bodies of all big American and Euro
pean cities.
But let me caution the intending
detective to keep away from all fiction
professing to describe the pursuit.
Even the better class of literature of
this kind is harmful, because it is un
true. Take Conan Doyle's "Sherlock
Holmes." To a practical detective it
is absurd from start to finish. The
young man who fancies he could make
himself a detective by diligent study of
works such as those of Doyle, Gabo
riau or Dv Boisgoby is grievously
mistaken. 'The proper study of man
kind is man." The proper studies of
the detective are criminals and crime.
Amateur "sleuthing" is somewhat
dangerous, but if the amateur be a
brainy and discreet youngster he may
pick up many points in this way, and
eventually work himself into a suc
cessful position. I would not advise a
beginning in the offices of minor pri
vate "detective agencies." Such
"agencies" are frequently of a most
shady character, and, before he knows
it. the young aspirant may find himself
classed by the police as the associate
of criminals, instead of being regarded
as a criminal catcher.
An instance of this has just occurred
to me. Not long ago there was an
"off-color" private detective agency
doing business in New York. A youth
from the country joined it, confident
that he was going to make his reputa
tion thereby. A few days afterward
he was sent out on a mission, which
was nothing less than a scheme of
blackmailing. He was not a stupid
youth, and he paused awhile.
That pause was his salvation. In
the meantime the chiefs of that pre
cious "private detective agency" were
serving fourteen-year sentences for
felony. The lucky young man from
the country blessed his stars and has
since joined the police force. His was
a narrow escape.
Do not understand me as condemn
ing the bona fide detective agencies.
Some of them are no doubt good
schools for young detectives; although
as a rule they prefer old and experi
enced men in their ranks.
Supposing the young man to have
gotten his first start, either in the po
lice or in a first-class private agency,
he must then make up his mind that
hard work and plenty of it lies before
him. That is where the requisite of pa
tience comes in. "It's dogged a;; does it"
with the detective. No matter how
bright the young man is, no matter
what sort of genius he ha I for picking
up clews and doing the fine work of the
profession, if his nature is one of those
easily daunted by temporary setbacks,
then he had better get out of detective
work at once. The "easy things" don't
countâ the jobs which any merely clev
er man may accomplish without ex
cessive labor. It is the hard case
which wins the lasting reward, and
shows the sterling quality of the young
detective.
You must excuse me bringing up my
own career, but you see. I know it best,
and can more readily select proofs and
evidences of what I am striving to tell
you from events in which I took per
sonal part. On dozens of different occa
sions when balked in a given direction,
I have forced myself to go back over
the ground again and yet again, until
finally after many such enueavors I
reached the goal I was in search of.
Professional criminals are resourceful
beings. They have to be. indeed; else
they could not thrive ever for a brief
space of time. Naturally they manage
to throw plenty of obstacles In the way
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 24, 1898.
of the pursuing detective. He must ex
pect these obstacles; and if he cannot
surmount them, he must find a means
of getting around them.
As an example, let me give you one
of the many embarrassing murder
cases which I have sucessfully coped
â with. On November 2 1885, Antonio
Soloa, a Chinaman, whose real name
was Ching Ong, was brutally murdered
and mutilated in his little restaurant
at the corner of Wooster and Spring
streets. New York. The murder had
been done with the restaurant keeper's
own knife; and the most protracted
search of the place revealed no clew as
to the murderer's identity.
Soloa, or Chine Ong. had lived many
years in Cuba, where he exchanged his
Chinese patronymic for a Spanish one,
and learned to speak not only Spanish,
but also a little French and Italian. In
New York he set up a tiny basement
restaurant, and throve in a modest
way. â¢
It was an exceptionally puzzling
case. At first I fancied that the push
cart peddler Daly, who first discovered
the dead body, might have been the
murderer. Hut one Coughlin, a resi
dent of Wooster street, had seen Daly
from the time he entered the street to
the time he ran wildly up the China
man's stairs with the news that An
tonio Soloa had been killed. Coughlin's
evidence cleared Dalj.
I was disappointed, but I started off
on a new tack. The mutilations which
had been inflicted upon the boxly were
suggestive of the barbarous East. At
once the idea occurred to me that the
ugly work had been done by highbind
ers. The peculiar quiet with which the
crime had been carried out also pointed
toward a concerted plot of the dead
man's treacherous fellow Mongols.
I went around among the different
Chinese haunts, and had all the trains
leaving town watched for suspicious
Chinamen. But try as I would I could
not fasten the guilt upon any of Soloa's
countrymen. Many uf them came to
his restaurant; but not a single China
man had been seen in the neighborhood
on the day of the killing.
Next I sought zealously among So
loa's Cuban customers, but here, for
a time at least, my efforts were equally
fruitless. I did not despair. Once more
I began at the beginning â made a thor
ough research of the little underground
restaurant and instituted minute in
quiries as to the identity of every per
son who had passed along Wooster
and Spring streets on the day of the
murder.
At last I made a discovery. Some
children playing at the next corner had
seen a boy pass by the restaurant door
at about the time, according to medical
evidence, of the killing. I went after
that boy with all my energies. All the
shops in (he neighborhood, all the fac
tories and most of the private houses
were inquired at, until, in the long run,
I located the much-desired lad. He
turned out to be a nervous, timorous
child, George Mainz by name, office
boy to William Schimper, a nickel
plater.
For some time neither Mr. Schimper
nor myself could get much out of
George. But finally he broke down and
confessed all he knew. Sure enough,
as he had passed the corner of Wooster
and Spring streets that day he had seen
a little man answering the description
of Soloa quarreling with a tall, strong
mulatto. The mulatto had a knife in
his hand, and George had seen him
stick the knife into the other's breast.
Then both disappeared down stairs, and
the boy, terribly frightened, ran away.
He did not tell his employer, because he
was afraid that the mulatto would pur
sue and kill him.
Asked If there was anything remark
able about the mulatto besides his
color, the office boy replied that he had
"a terrible scar on his left cheek."
With this information I once more
turned my attention to the Cuban pa
trons of Soloa. After weeks of seeking,
1 found out the identity of the man
With the scar. He was a Cuban negro
named Augusto Rebella, and a member
of the secret society known as the "Ni
azzas." A photograph of the "Niazzas"
had been taken, and of this I secured a
copy. George Mainz went over the
faces one by one, and at last discovered
and identified that of Rebella.
Rebella's comrades In the secret so
ciety did all they could to shield him;
but eventually the murder was brought
home to him. At Los Dos Amigos cigar
fastory, in Washington street, where
he worked. I found that on November
2 he had only made 100 cigars, whereas
his average daily output had always
been 200. Moreover, he was known as
a regular patron of Antonio Soloa;
and George Mainz identified him on the
stand as the man he had seen stabbing
the < 'hinaman.
A detective must not know fear. He
must be prepared to go Into any and
every "dive," no matter how unsavory,
at the call pf duty. That he risks his life
twenty times a day must cut little fig
ure with him. Let him remember that
he does so in the public service, and
that, unless he does so, he is no true
detective.
I knew of a little police officer in
Pittsburg, Perm. His name is John
McTlghe. Ho is of slender build, and
little more than 4 feet 11 in height.
But he has the daring of a wildcat.
Some years ago McTighe saw two aus
picious looking persons on Smithfleld
street in the iron city. He pursued
them unostentatiously throughout the
day. and at length saw them enter a
bank, present a check and emerge with
funds. McTighe watched them until
they entered a nearby saloon. Then
he went into a drug store across the
way, whence he could keep an eye on
the saloon door, and called up Roger
O'Mara, then chief of detectives in
Pittsburg. O'Mara sent to the bank,
and a closer investigation developed
the fact that the check presented by
the two men was a clever forgery. This
news was communicated to McTighe,
who at once crossed the street to ar
rest the criminals.
Pie met them comin out of the sa
loon. They were both big powerful
men, but M^ Tithe was undaunted.
Without a word he tripped up the fore
most fellow, so that he tumbled face
forward across the floor. Then he
leaped at the next man's throat and by
sheer force of surprise bore him over.
Meanwhile criminal No. 1 had drawn a
revolver. McTighe dexterously kicked
it out of his hand and planted a stun
ning uppercut at the base of his chin.
Criminal No. 2 wt- by this time on his
feet and he went for I.lcTip-he tooth and
nail. But the gallant little detective
held on to the fellow's collar, despite
the blows which were showered upon
him. while he nlanted himself firmly
astride of the prostrate member of the
partnership. He had no means of blow
ing his police whistle, but, fortunately
for him, the crowd which had collected
attracted a passing policeman, who has
tened to the spot.
At first the officer did not recognize
McTighe, so bruised and battered was
he, but a few words put him in pos
session of the facts, and he lent a hand
in arresting the criminals. McTighe
had to go to an hospital, but he had the
comfort of knowing that he had done
his duty like a little man. To the young
detective I would say, "Be ready to do
as McTighe did when called upon, and
don't wait until you have to be told
your course of action, either.'
The young detective, to be really
successful, must be an all-around man.
Specialists are useful, indeed; but once
a specialist always a specialist in the
detective business. It is the all-around
man that rises.
It is a sine qua non that the aspir
ant must have a retentive memory for
faces. As soon as possible he ought
to begin studying the criminals he
comes across and the portraits in the
rogues' gallery. By that means he will
soon be able to spot a suspicious char
acter on sight. When he sees such
a person he ought to keep an eye on
I don't mean by this that a genuine
ly reformed criminal should be dogged
wherever he goes; but simply that a
suspected person, acting suspiciously,
ought to h? watched. That "preven
tion is bettor than a cure" has ever
been a pet maxim of mine, and by fol
lowing doubtful characters, detectives
may prevent crime.
Strict attention to business, implicit
obedience and absolute temperanceâ
these, too, the young detective must
possess, if he would excel.
From what I have said and from the
requirements I have laid down as ne
cessary, you will see that not one young
man in 100 has reason to seriously con
sider entering the detective field. To
that one young man, however, I trust
that my words may be of use and in
terest.
HIS JOKE WAS
ON HARRIGAN
NED HARRIGAN t^lls a good
story which may or may not be
new to his present day friends.
Once upon a time a certain
butcher in Truckee started a va
riety show and Ned and Dick Durand
went up there to play for him. Through
no fault of theirs the show was a fail
ure and the butcher shut up shop, fig
uratively and literally, leaving his as
sistants without a dime in their pock
ets.
So it came about one snowy night
the two stood together on a street cor
ner and mutually recognized the fact
that they were very hungry, together
with the accompanying fact that they
had nothing to barter for a meal. Be
sides the clothes which they wore, not
a superabundant quantity by any means,
they had only a dilapidated banjo on
which no one would advance them any
thing whatever, but at last Harrigan,
who was the bolder of the two, went
into a saloon and stated the case and
was rewarded by the gift of a dollar
from a generous gambler.
Coming out he found that Durand
was no longer alone, but that a tall fel
low in a long overcoat, who had been
hovering near them, when they were
discussing ways and means, was stand
ing talking with him.
"I've got enough for chops and pota
toes," he declared, joyously, and led
the way into a cheap restaurant,
Durand and his companion followed
and the three ate a hearty supper, the
odd one getting away with rather more
than his share of the provisions, and
made an excuse to disappear just as
the meal was over.
"Who was your friend?" asked Har
rigan. and Durand looked at him in as
tonishment.
"He was no friend of mine," he an
swered, "but I thought he was one of
yours."
LOST HIS WIFE
on the
WEDDING TRIP
A NEWLY married couple left Sa
vannah, Georgia, on their wed
ding tour, going first to New Or
leans and then to New York by
way of Chicago. The latter city
neither of them had ever visited before.
Their hatel, the selection of which had
been a matter of some discussion, as
they wanted the comforts and conven
iences of a large house, with all the
privacy of a smaller one, they had
finally decided to leave somewhat to
chance, so upon leaving the train, they
took a carriage to a house â the name
of which neither had heard before
â it having been recommended by
a fellow traveler as quiet and
first-class. Arriving there they found
a crowd about the clerk's desk,
and, after some delay, the bell-boy by
mistake took their bags, etc., and tell
ing them to follow conducted them to
rooms.
After seeing his wife comfortable,
Mr. Brown concluded to take a little
walk "to stretch his legs" before dining.
On going out he found it snowing, and,
the "Li" being a novelty, he took n car,
intending to go only a few blocks. Be
coming interested, he proceeded far
ther than he intended, left the car and
took one returning, but where to return
to he did not know. The name of his
hotel had left him completely.
He called a policeman and shame
facedly to.d him his story- The officer
said, "That is all right. What is your
name? What hour did your train ar
rive? The hotel register will tell us
everything. 'Hugo Brown, Savannah,
Ga.' That's all right."
'Hold on," said Brown. "By some
devilish error of the clerk or bellboy or
in my hurry to get settled I did not
register before I went to my room, in
tending to do so after I had seen my
wife comfortable, who, by the way, is
almost ill, and by this time must be
worried to death. I have been out three
hours and I told her I would return in
twenty minutes."
The policeman secured a list of
hotels and Brown was sure it was the
Normandie. As soon as he stepped into
the hotel h- discovered he was wrong.
They then tried the Netherlands, and
so on, Brown grasping vaguely at the
name of his hostelry and cursing him
self roundly.
In the meantime Mrs. Brown had be
come nearly distracted. She sent for
the clerk and demanded her husband at
his hands. The clerk, who immediately
thought he saw something wrong in
the omission to register, went to his

superiors?. As Mrs. Brown seemed ill,
almost in hysterics, they called a phy
sician, who prescribed rest and a
trained nurse. When the next after
noon brought no news of her husband,
and nearly out of her mind, she, with
the help of some officious women of
the house, began to believe that her
husband had deserted her. She tele
graphed to her brother for funds and
to meet her in Chicago, paid her bills
and, with the trained nurse, started for
home.
In the meantime her husband had
traveled the city like a madman, and,
as they learned afterward, went up in
the elevator of the house she was just
leaving. Her brother, wild with anxi
ety, met her, and immediately asked for
Brown. Brown in the meantime had
in his despair telegraphed to his wife's
father asking: "Any news of Cora?
Wire Chicago." At the same time as
suring himself that she must have gone
home, as the only natural thing to do.
he started himself for Savannah.
In the meantime the brother had per
suaded Mrs. Brown to return to New
York, telling her that it was not possi
ble that her husband should have de
serted her. Filled with an anxiety he
carefully concealed from his sister, they
started for New York, as it was learned
afterward, leaving the station at the
same time Brown arrived. Reaching
New York they went immediately to
the Waldorf, where Simpson registered
himself and sister "in a big, round
hand."
He had no sooner gotten to his room
than the clerk appeared and ar.ked if
the Mrs. Brown registered this even
ing was the wife of the "lost Mr.
Brown," as they called him. Being told
that she was, the clerk said Mr. Brown
left for Savannah yesterday afternoon,
whereupon Mr. Simpson telegraphed
Brown at Savannah, "Cora with me;
return at once." He then told his sis
ter the state of affairs, and she insisted
upon starting that night, but being
very tired, and, as the time tables
could not be changed to suit her con
venience, she was obliged to wait until
the next day.
In the meantime a copy of the dis
patch, sent by Simpson, had been for
warded to Brown at Chicago, who, con
struing it to mean that he should re
turn to New York, immediately set out
upon his return. Arriving he was told
that Mr. Simpson and Mrs. Brown had
left for Savannah that morning. Then
he telegraphed to his father-in-law:
"Hold Cora till I come. Arrive Sat
urday evening train."
RAIDING SPANISH SLAVERS
ON THE AFRICAN COAST
Since the publication in The Call two
weeks ago of a story in reference to the
slave trade on the west coast of Africa
as carried on by the Spaniards, who
abused Old Glory in order to protect
themselves from English cruisers, nu
merous inquiries have been made as to
the part the United States took in the
affair. Did the United States Govern
ment make any attempt to assist the
British in putting down this nefarious
traffic?
"The United States rendered all the
assistance that could be expected of
her," Captain Jackson, the author of
the previous article, replied, when spo
ken to in reference to the matter. "But
the boys in blue were really more eager
to put down the traffic than the Gov
ernment officials. â¢
"But there was a time when an
American ship's crew really made one
of the blgg^-t captures that was made
while I was on duty on the west coast.
And I tell you we had to fight for it. I
say 'we' because it was a joint expedi
tion and I was one of the attacking
party in the small boat.
"The Marion had been cruising near
the mouth of the Congo and the ar*
rangement was that she was to leave
for a few days and then come back and
we would jointly undertake whatever
turned up in the meantime.
"During the Marion's absence we
cruised about the mouth of the river
and purposely allowed two ships flying
the American flag to go past us and
sail inland. We were almost positive
they were slavers, but managed to con
trol ourselves until the proper time.
"The fact that the Marion had sailed
away from the coast and that my ves
sel, the Antelope, had not molested
them, made the slavers bold and they
took little pains to conceal their iden
tity.
"When the Marion returned the two
slave ships had reached the height of
navigation on the Congo River and
were caught like rats in a trap. We had
received information that at least 2000
slaves were on hand ready to be loaded
on the two vessels and we wore all
sure of capturing big prize money. '
"Before making the attack on the
slavers the Marion and Antelope came
to anchor off Sharks Point just at the
entrance to the river, where the cap
tains of both vessels decided upon a
plan of operation.
"It was eventually agreed that the
Marion, being a sailing vessel, should
remain where she was and guard the
entrance to the river, while the Ante
lope, being a steamer of good speed,
should assume as much as possible the
appearance of an American vessel, pro
ceed up the river and capture the
slavers.
"When all was ready the stars and
stripes were hoisted over the Antelope
and Second Lieutenant Whiting of the
Marion was put in command. This
brave officer was the Rear-Admiral
Whiting who died a short time ago. A
fully equipped cutter and crew from
the Marion was detailed for service on
our vessel. Of course there was a good
deal of growling on the part of the
'boys' who had to remain behind. But
this was all made up later on.
"As we had been up the river many
times before our captain knew every
part of it. Consequently we made the
best part of the journey at night with
lights out, and fortunately had the
wind against us so the thumping of
our paddles did not aJarm the slavers.
When we reached a point where we
could see their lights we came to a
standstill and then sent lines ashore
and laid up for the night behind the
shelter of a point of land thickly cov
ered with palms and tropical vegeta
tion. This spot was known as Punta
de Lima.
"From where we were tied up we
could walk along the shore for a short
distance and get a plain view of the
slavers. Both were big three-masted
ships of at least 1000 tons each, which
in those days was a monster craft.
They made a beautiful picture as they
lay on the placid water in the silence
of the sultry tropic night. But when
we had listened a few moments we
found it was not all silence. The sound
of a guitar and dancing feet reached
our ears, mingled with ribald songs and
the clinking of glasses. Slavers always
had plenty of money and their side
boards were loaded down with the best
to be had. When all was looking well
with them wine flowed like water.
"Of course nothing could be done that
night, but what we had seen had satis
fled us that the slavers had not the
least idea of our presence.
"It was decided not to make the at
tack until we had seen something that
would be incriminati-g. We had not
long to wait. Before the sun was an
hour high next morning the slavers
had begun the work of loading.
"One part of the crew was sent
ashore to get the slaves out of the cor
rals, another took them out to the ships
in boats, and a third remained on board
to stow them away.
"From the first the air was filled with
the cries and lamentations of the poor
negroes. The slave drivers were not
affected, however, for they used the
whip on the slightest provocation, and
many a poor wretch was carried aboard
with his back dripping with blood. Here
he was thrust uown into the stifling
hold, and if he showed the slightest in#
subordinatian was put In chains.
"All this we could plainly see through
a glass from our sheltered position on
the opposite shore. Nothing more was
necessary. The attack would be madÂ«
at once.
"It so happened, however, that the
slaver's captain became suspicious of
something down our way. Possibly a
wreath of smoke attracted his atten
tion, or it may be that some one ashore
had seen us and carried the news to
him. At any rate the first thing we
knew a boat put out from one of the
ships and began pulling down to us.
"Lieutenant Whiting made up his
mind in an instant, and without wait
ing to launch the cutter, jumped into a
dingy, that was tied up near shore, and
called for volunteers. There was only
room for four, and I was one of them;
the other three were Americans.
"The wind was just right, and in less
than five minutes we had our sail up
and were skimming along to meet the
slavers. This sail kept the slavers from
seeing our uniforms, and they most
'ikely took us for a party of explorers
or detectives.
"When within hailing distance Lieu
tenant Whiting ordered the slavers to
lay to, but no attention was paid to
his command. He repeated it and was
answered by a pistol ball that fortu
nately flew wide of the mark.
" 'Fire,' he called to us, and the fight
commenced.
"There were ten Spaniards in th*Â»
other boat, and they were as hard look
ing a set of men as ever breathed. Mur
derer was written on every one of their
faces. But they couldn't shoot.
"Their first volley went by as harm
lessly as if it had never been fired at
all, while ours stretched two of their
men out in the bottom of the boat-
Two others were wounded.
"This scared the others and they
started to make an effort to escape.
But our sail was still full of wind and
we hove down on them until the two
boats bumped together.
"It was every man for himself now.
Pistols cracked every moment and the
air was full of bullets. But our op
ponents could shoot no better at closa
range than they could at long. Only
one of our men was hurt, but not
badly, while we rapidly thinned them
out. A young fellow in our boat shot
a villainous-looking fiend who was just
in the act of striking Lieutenant Whit
ing with a saber. His shot had the
effect of causing the man to fall over
board, where he struggled for a mo
ment and then sank from sight.
"I don't know how long the fight
lasted. It seemed like an hour, but
I guess it was not over live minutes.
I got a crack over the head with an
oar that nearly stunned me, but I soon
recovered and continued to shoot. The
air was full of powder smoke and our
boats were slippery with blood.
"One slaver, after being killed, fell
over into our boat and nearly capsized
it. We did not stop to throw him
overboard, but kept at the other fel
lows until six of them were, piled in a
heap in their boat.
"At this stage of the game the slaver
in charge threw up his hands and
begged for mercy. The other man who
was 'eft did the same.
"Just then I happened to look up thÂ«
river and was horrified to see three
big ships' boats loaded with men armed
to the teeth coming toward us. It
looked as if it was all up with us now.
" 'Tie those men,' cried Lieutenant
Whiting, quick as a wink, and in a
moment both of our prisoners were
where they could do no mischief.
" "Now fire,' ordered the lieutenant,
and wewerefighting again. Bullets flew
like hail, but most of them either went
by harmlessly or struck the boat, which
was soon full of holes and began to fill
with water. We dropped one or two of
the slavers, but they would soon have
got the best of us if it had not been
for the unexpected.
"Just as the slavers were within a
hundred yards of us consternation sud
denly seized them. They dropped their
pistols and sprang to their oars. They
had forgotten all about fighting and
turned all attention to escape.
"Looking down the river I saw the
Antelope coming toward us, with the
stars and stripes at her gaff.
"A moment later I saw a puff of
white smoke at her side, and instantly
one of the escaping slave boats rose
out of the water, broke in two and fell
with a splash. The men in the other
two boats dropped their oars and held
up their hands.
"Of course, that ended the fight.
Small boats came out from the Ante
lope and picked up the men who had
been knocked out of the boat that was
struck by the shot. The others were
taken prisoners, and were soon in Irons,
carefully locked 'tween decks.
"By this time we had reached the
two slave ships anchored in the river,
but had no trouble about boarding 1
them. They were deserted by all but
the slaves between decks. These were
liberated and the captured ships put in
charge of prize crews and sent to head
quarters, where they were broken up.
' Although there was the best of evi
dence of piracy against the slavers, it
was decided not to hold them. Accord
ingly they were liberated with about
ten days' grub and water, on a lonely
coast, to make their way back to civili
zation as best they could.
"The prize money for the two slavers
v ar- divided equally between crews of
the Antelope and the Marion. It was
a good day's work, and nobody had
reason to regret the fact that an Amer
ican officer had commanded an English
ebip."

ALASKA'S
HARVEST
OF GOLD
Icy Streams Beside Which
~~lt Will Be Gathered
During the Summer.
BY SAM WALL.
WITHOUT a map under one's
eye and a comprehensive
statement of the relation
ship to each other of the
ks in the Klondike and
Indian River mining divi
sions, one must have a very confused
notion of their location and relative
Importance, especially since the multi
plication of them and their names that
have followed the constant stampeding
and prospecting of this long winter.
In my published summary of the
probable output of the districts I did
not even refer to many creeks that are
now listed in Dawson as having big
dlities, and the claims upon
which are held at high figures. They
had no place in that story, because
they will not i'igure this year materially
in the output. However, in reviewing
the mining situation there, they should
not be overlooked. I shall here at
tempt t" give such a general view as
airy to the mind of the reader a
reasonably clear idea of the whole min
ing region and the development that
baa taken place during this season â
how it has grown under the influx of
"tei harcos."
At the close of the mining season of
last year â that is, after the wash up
ami at the time those men came "out"
Whose arrival in San rancisco, weight
ed down with gold, started that Klon
dike fever that has spread over the
:. the new goldfields meant Bo
nanza and El Dorado creeks â those
two. Now they mean almost every
tributary of the great Yukon River.
For fold has been found so often in
resj..nse to patient digging in so many
different places that expectation has
been raised with regard to all the vast
country, and dues not know where to
place the limit. This is true of the old
lamps as well as the new, on the
American as well as the British side
of the line. In reviewing the whole,
however, 1 shall speak of these dis
tricts separately and of that tirst
which holds tirst attention. The Klon- |
dike and Indian River divisions are '
practically one district, being only sep
1 by a low divide and having
Dawson for their source of supply.
Prospecting is now going on in the fol
lowing creeks in these districts, all of \
which are iisted in the mining ex
gt and brokers' offices, and claims
upon them are the subject of daily bar
ter, lluctuation in price, inquiry as to
the latest developments and general
ulatlon.
Bonanza and El Dorado are placed in
the list, of course, but they have gassed
out of the period of speculation. They !
are known from end to end to be rich, j
T< be sure, there are many claims on j
both that, for one reason or another, !
have not been worked. The one reason :
is that their owners were compelled to j
the country for lack of provisions, j
That reason will not exist next year,]
as every man going into the country ;
is now compelled to take provisions
with him, and, besides commercial
companies, new and old, are carrying
Quantities of provisions into the coun- |
try. both up and down the river. El
Dorado Creek will probably be worked
out next year. Bonanza Creek is good
for two or three years yet, as a steady
and tijg gold producer. The others will
only fairly enter the list of producers
next year. This is the list

There are besides these the follow

Ensley Creek, above Dawson.
Baker Creek, above Dawson.
Montana ('reek, above Dawson.
Bryant Creeik, above Dawson.
Dion Crook, above Dawson.
Rosebud Creek, above Dawson.
Deadwood Creek, below Dawson.
Moose Hide Creek, below Dawson.
These are named somewhat in their
geographical order.
Standing upon "the Dome," the high
est point in the region of this district,
one can look down the valleys of Bo
nanza, El Dorado, Humboldt, Domin
ion, Sulphur and Gold Bottom creeks,
the principal creeks of the two divi
sions and of which most of the other
creeks named are tributaries. They
all have their rise in the hills about
this Dome, which seems to stand like
the center of a star of which these
creeks kad away to the five points.
This fact creates the belief that the
treasure box from which these creeks
have drawn their great riches is, or
was, hidden in the Dome Itself. It is
hardly necessary to say that the Dome
lifted Into the wintry clouds as it is, is
staked.
The trail leading from Dominion
Creek into Bonanza runs over the very
apex of this Dome and for twelve miles
follows the crest of the mountains
Passing over it on the Ist of March
last I planted my tripod on the sum
mit and took a series of photographs
comprehending a panorama of the re
markable view to be had there of the
snow-white land below, the jagged
points of the Rocky Mountains mark-
Ing the line of the horizon upon one
side and the valley of the great Yukon
upon the other.
In this vast region, that there lay
under the eye, could be noted the in
dentations that marked the course of
many creeks and gulches that have not
even been explored, much less pros
pected â this to answer the question so
often asked, "Has not everything been
taken up?" Nothing could express a
more absolute lack c-f understanding of
the vastness of this region than that
question.
This Klondike River, with which
everybody is so familiar now, is in fact
itself an unknown Quantity only a lit
tle above Hunker Creek. A party of
prospectors took a year's provisions
and went up the river last fail and
have not since beÂ«?n heard from. They
will probably come down this summer,
whisper a few minutes to their friends,
caution them not to repeat what they
tell them and then another big stam
pede will take place. That is the way
most of the stampedes are started.
Somebody gets a tip, pledges eternal
secrecy, and in an hour the news has
spread over the entire camp. A stam
pede is as interesting to watch as is
;t volunteer fir*.? company getting Into
action. It generally takes place at
night that it may be the more thrilling
and picturesque. Every man engaged
in it is as mysterious as he may be
while laboring under great excitement.
He rushes into a restaurant, calls the
cook to une side and asks him to put
up a lunch for him "Quick:!" While
the lunch is being prepared he runs at
speed into the bunkh<>us.' n r cabin,
where his next friend may be asleep,
hauls him out of bed by the legs and
tells him that a stampede is o-n. and
unless he is willing to miss the chance
of his life to get up and come on. The
friend hurries into his clothes and joins
the scramble. Within a few minutes,
illy dressed and scantily provided
against the weather and against hun
ger, a hundred men will leave town all
at top Bpeed, going they scarcely know
where, following somebody, who may
lead them for days over mountains and
through Wildernesses that are hardly
marked by a trail. Once started they
go on regardless of the weather and
every other circumstance. These stam
pedes have brought prosperity to a
large hospital and have transferred to
many a doctor's name numbers of gold
claims.
One of the odd things that one en
counters in the big country is the state
of feeling existing between the old
timer and the "techarco" or new comer.
The old timer despises and sneers at i
the techarco and the techarco laughs !
or sneers at the old timer. Most of
the big claims are held by compara
tive new comers an* nearly all the
prospecting this winter has been done
by them. This, to be sure, may be ac- j
counted for by the fact that they great- ;
ly outnumber the old timers. Two
years ago the census of the two big !
commercial companies that supplied |
the inhabitants with food, and so had
the names on their books of almost
everybody from Fort Selkirk to St. j
Michael, placed the entire population i
of the Yukon Valley at 1500 people. In
those days outfits for that number
were brought in by the boats and the
company's agents apportioned out the [
supply. The whereabouts of every j
miner was known, and if he did not '
come in in the summer with the others j
his outfit was set apart for him until |
he did come. Old Jack McQuesten, for j
years agent for the A. C. Company at
Circle City and other camps along the
river, is almost revered by the old !
miners for the careful manner in which
he used to look after them. In those
days every man willing to work had
credit for a year's outfit and the money
in hand was not a condition at all. But
the rush of techarcos has changed the
old system and cash down and plenty
of it is now necessary in every trans
action. It is not such a great wonder
therefore that the old miner believes
himself to be very charitable in that
he tolerates the new comer at all, and
on the traU or in his own cabin extends
to him that hospitality that is a fixed
custom of the cheerless landâ just as
It is among the Indians.
But what amuses the new comer with
regard to the old timer is the persist
ent refusal of the latter to believe therÂ«
is anything in any of the creeks, the
names and location of which he has
known so long. He has in years past
pushed his solitary canoe against the
rapid current of this and that stream,
has had stirring adventures and per
haps almost lost his life here or there
and, having dug a little under the
moss, passed unfavorable judgment
and retired. Here comes some inex
perienced youth, fresh from the orangp
groves of California, who stays a little
longer, digs a little deeper and gets an
ounce to the pan. The old timer is
disgusted, tries to think it is some ac
cident, a mere chance pocket, and re
mains deaf and blind and stubborn just
as long as he can in face of the per
sistent facts.
But it is true that these newcomers
also get discouraged, some of them too
early. They put down a hole to bed
rock, perhaps two or three, and, finding
nothing, give up the search often, when
the next comer, still having faith, put
ting down still another hole, finds rich
pay. This experience is repeated over
and over in the history of even El
Dorado and Bonanza creeks. Ihe min
ing and the wash up may be said to be
done but slovenly and carelessly at its
best. Only the richest dirt is taken
out and dirt that a few years ago
would be rated as very rich is now
thrown aside. Especially is this true
where the mine Is worked on lays. The
average lay agreement runs out July 1,
and the laymen will not waste time on
any but the richest dirt. It is safe to
say that fortunes will be taken out of
the ground upon a second workingâaf
ter the claims on most of these creeks
have been given up as exhausted. In
deed, extensive plans are now being
formed by practical, scientific miners
for the working over on an extensive
scale of the ground in El Dorado and
Bonanza creeks.
Following is a brief sketch of the
creeks and mining divisions of the
Yukon. .
BONANZA CREEK is a tributary of
Klondike River. The Klondike River
1b a small stream, and not navigable
except for canoes but a little distance.
The pay streak is wide and deep in
Bonanza, but its direction changes, and
It has given some of the claim-holders
considerable trouble in finding it. When
located, however, the reward has al
ways been rich. The greatest develop
ment has been made within the limits
of 43 above and 65 below. The greater
wealth ha 6 been taken out above dis
covery- There are long intervals be
low between the working claims that
remain idle and a long stretch above
also, principally for the reason stated.
There are isolated claims being worked
on the creek below, as far down as 80,
all paying well. The mines are being

prospected or opened up also as high
as BO above. Claim-owners who had
been compelled to go down the river
for provisions were returning to +hese
claims and beginning again their in
terrupted work at the end of winter.
On Blarcb 2, the day that I came over
from Dominion and Bonanza creeks,
the owner of the claim at McCormacka
Fork had just arrived and was relight
ing the fires in his long-neglected shaft.
Th.- notion that the g<-ld in Bonanza
comes from El Dorado is clearly an er
ror, as is shown by the fact that Bo
nanza, above El Dorado, is richer than
below. El Dorado comes into Bonanza
at 6 abirve discovery, and it is nearly
four miles further up that they keep
a watchman on the dump to see that
thlevefl do not carry away the dirt at
night. Bonanza is thirty miles in length
and the average depth of the bedrock
twenty feet.
BoULDER CREEK Is the first trib
utary mot with in the ascent of the
creek. Good prospects have been
found there, pans having been washed
out as rich as $8 50, with pay dirt about
four feet deep. The creek comes into
Bonanza at 37 below. Claim No. 1, at
the mouth, is very rich.
ADAMS CREEK comes next. It is
four miles long and fully located. Two
or three claims near the mouth are re
ported to be turning out well. No. 1
will be worked this summer. This is
th<- creek which is said to have attract
ed the initial party of old miners from
El Dorado Creek. They had gone up
Bonanza and were undecided whether
to prospect here or in El Dorado. They
decided by the toss of a penny. The
fall of the coin turned them away from
El Dorado to this creek.
THE SKOOKUMSâ Big and Little
Skookum gulches are the wonder of
the camp. The rounded knoll or hill
]>. -tween these two gulches is covered
with bench claims. They are near dis
covery on Bonanza. They can be
worked during the summer, as they
are above the creek bottom. Some of
the lower claims have two pay streaks,
that of El Dorado as well as that of
Bonanza.
EL DORADO CREEKâ This creek
has proved the most uniformly rich
of any in the district, especially from
34 to the mouth. Benches (that is the
hillsides) on both sides of this creek
have been found to pay wherever pros
pected. It has more sloping banks
than Bonanza. Much of El Dorado
may be worked in the summer, the bed
rock not being at a great depth.
CHIEF GULCHâ Chief Gulch is
properly a continuation of El Dorado
Creek, hut the original locators fol
lowed the smaller branch. Prospectors
recently reported rich finds on this
gulch and a stampede followed which
resulted in its being staked well up into
the hills.
GAY GULCH comes into El Dorado
at No. 36. The claim at the mouth is
being worked and proves very rich.
FRENCH AND IRISH GULCHESâ
These are small' tributaries of El Do
dorado. They are being prospected at
the mouth, but had not shown any
thing more than good prospects as
yet.
BEAR CRP:EK empties into the
Klondike a few miles above Bonanza.
It is considered by the old miner to
be the "worst looking" creek that has
so far been prospected, but it produces
the finest quality of gold. It is all
coarse and it runs in value as high us
$20 to the pan. It is quite deep to bed
rock, in places forty-five feet, owing
to slides. Every claim prospected so
far has proven rich. It is only about
five miles long and has been fully
staked of course. The sides of the creek
are precipitous and there is therefore
little chance for the bench claimant.
The creek is not worked much above
discovery, which Is two miles from the
mouth.
QUIGLEY CREEKâ It Is a small
stream that has recently been located,
but so far remains unprospected. It
empties into the Klondike below Bear
Creek.
HUNKER CREEKâ This is a very
considerable stream and is the next in
importance in this year's schedule of
gold producers to Bonanza and El Do
rado. It has given considerable trou
ble In locating its pay streak also. It
is in an advanced stage of develop
ment and has proven very rich. It is
very wide at the mouth and five miles
of its length from its confluence with
the Klondike is staked by the pugilist,
Frank Slavin, and others for mining
by hydraulic process. Slavin is at
Ottawa â or came out to go thereâ for
the purpose of securing governmental
sanction to his scheme. Discovery is
thirteen miles from the mouth. De
velopment d%vlndles from discovery up
ward and extends downward with some
intervals of Interruption to 74. There
are some quite rich bench claims along
the creek. There are a number of
small streams emptying Into Hunker
Creek that have not been prospected
or located.
GOLD BOTTOM CREEK is the
main tributary of Hunker. It comes
in at No. 28, below discovery. Develop
ment work is backward. The creek is
very cfooked and no doubt many
claims will miss the pay streak. Some
claims near the mouth are very rich.
LAST CHANCE CREEKâ This is the
next tributary of importance to Hun
ker Creek. This is the first season it
has been worked. Several claims have
developed good prospects.
LEOTA CREEKâ This is a small
stream recently located from which
some good prospects have been report
ed, but probably cannot be demon
strated this year.
TOO MUCH GOLD CREEKâ This
empties into the Klondike above Hun
ker Creek. There has been little work
done, but the prospectors report uni
formly good returns. The original
name of the creek by whites was
Slate Creek, but Too Much Gold is said
Drawn by B. A. SEITZ â Dawson, N. W. T., 1898.
to be the English interpretation of the
Indian name. It is located from the
mouth to i>l at the forks ami to 15 on
the left and 8 on the right fork.
ALL GOLD CREEK flows into Flat
Creek or left branch of the Klondike.
Above the confluence with Lucky Creek
a soapstone bed rock is found which
seems to have failed to hold the gold
that is discovered here and there in
crevices.
LUCKY < 'KEEK is the principal trib
utary of All Gold, ami prospectors re
pori rich finds. The owner of No. 13
on this creek refused an offer of $16,000
a short time ago.
INDIAN CHEEK <>R INDIAN
RIVER MINING DIVISION â In
dian Creek or river Hows into
the Yukon from the same side
and same direction as does the
Klondike and its principal tribu
taries head up in the same hills as do
Bonanza, El Dorado and the other
creeKa named in the Klondike division.
The principal creeks are those:
DOMINION CREEKâ This is the
larger branch of Sulphur Creek and
should properly have been the parent
stream, but in making up the record it
was set down as flowing into Sulphur
Creek. It heads on the other side of
the divide opposite the source of Hun
ker Creek. The first work on Do
minion was done this year. There are
two locations of discovery, about four
and a half miles apart and between
th' se the greatest prospecting or de
velopment work has been done and rich
prospects discovered. There are forty
six claims recorded between the two
and for lack of Bpace they overlap and
confusion and contests have resulted.
The rights of the claimants will be de
termined upon the right or priority of
the discoverer. On claims that have
been prospected as much as two ounces
to the pan have been washed and the
creek is expected to divide honors with
Bonanza next year. The creek is lo
cated from 27 above upper discovery
to -TS below lower, which means
thirty-seven miles. From 20 above up
per discovery to 30 below the value of
claims ranges from $2000 to $50,000, the
higher priced being between the twrÂ»
discoveries.
CARIBOU CREEK is a tribu
tary of Dominion Creek, and takes
Its source on the Sulphur divide.
The eye prospector calls it "exception
ally tine-looking." It Is located from
its mouth to No. 41. The principal de
velopment work has been done on No.
21, where^lVi ounces were panned out
of three pans on February 22. Caribou
can be worked both summer and win
ter.
LYON CREEK is the left fork of
Caribou, and joins it at No. 16. There
have been twenty locations on it but
little development.
ARKANSAW CREEK joins Domin
ion at 14 below discovery t a-nd has only
recently boen located.
171 CREEKâ This is a long creek,
which gets its name, for lack of a bet
ter, from the fact that it comes into
Dominion at claim No. 171. Rich pros
pects were said to have been struck
there. There was a constant succes
sion of stampedes into Dominion Creek
on its tributaries in February and
March because of the rich returns re
ported from that creek.
SULPHUR CREEK is staked
and recorded from 80 above and
to its continence with Dominion,
about 170 below discovery. Pay dirt
has been located from 38 above to 60
below. Some claims are preparing for
summer ground sluicing. From 40 above
to 50 below values run from $6000 to
$20,000, and a few about discovery rise
above the higher figure.
GREEN GULCH and FRIDAY
GULCH are small tributaries of Sul
phur, located hut not developed.
QUARTZ CREEK is the next import
ant tributary of Indian going toward
the Yukon. It is a very crc-oked
stream. No big returns have been
made from it. The pay is discovered to
lie under the hill.
OPHIR CHEEK is the next tribu
tary of Indian. No definite returns.
DIXON CREEK, about five miles
above Dawson, has been staked its full
length, but little is known of it.
NINE-MILE CREEK is one of the
newly located that comes under the 100
foot law. Locations on the creeks that
were recorded before the passage of
the new mining regulations, or any of
the tributaries of the same, are still
allowed the 500 feet that there ob
tained. Newly recorded creeks only ad
mit of 100 feet. Nine-mile takes its
source just opposite El Dorado. Pay
has been located at claim No. 40 above
discovery. From $1 38 to $3 50 to the
pan has been found.
BRYANT CREEK flows Into the Yu
kon ten miles above Dawson. It is as
yet an unknown quantity. The claims
are 500 feet wide, having been recorded
before the 100-foot regulation went into
effect.
MONTANA CREEK has its source
about opposite the rise of BigSkookum,
and flows into the Yukon about fifteen
miles above Dawson. It was the first
of the small, independent streams
flowing into the Yukon east of Daw
son to be staked. Claims are 500 feet
wide. It is staked for twelve miles, its
entire length.
EUREKA CREEK comes in from op
posite Sulphur and Dominion creeks,
and between the two. A number of
men are working on both forks, and fa
vorable reports are heard. Claims are
valued at from $500 to $5000.
BAKER CREEK joins the Yukon
about twenty miles above Daw
son. It takes its source across the di
vide about opposite Dawson. There is
some work going on. and a rich strike
is reported at 102 above Discovery.
EUSTERY CREEK enters the Yu
kon about eight miles below Indian
River, and twenty-five miles above
Dawson. It is a small stream, was
stampeded early in the winter, but lit
tle work has been done.
REINDEER CREEK empties into
the Yukon about forty miles above
Dawson and ten above Indian River.
Gold was found there shortly after the
100-foot regulation went into effect.
Good prospects are reported and the
creek is fully staked.
SIXTY-MILE RIVER empties into
the Yukon about fifty miles above
Dawson. About thirty men have been
working there for some two years,
sending out each season for provisions.
Little is known as to what they are
finding, but there is considerable spec
ulation about it.
HENDERSON CREEK empties into
the Yukon from the north, about fifty
miles above Dawson. It has been lo
cated from the mouth to the left fork
i Moose Horn Creek), to 140, and up the
right fork to 70. The locating was
principally done by the men who were
frozen in by the closing of the river,
while they were on their way to Daw
son. A large colony was stopped on
the Stewart River. Little is known
about Henderson Creek, as it has not
been much prospected. Its principal
tributaries are Golden Gate Creek,
Sixty Creek and North Fork. The
best pay has been developed at the
mouth of Sixty Creek. Henderson is
seventy-five miles long.
ROSEBUD CREEK flows into the
Yukon about sixty miles above Daw
son. It has been staked for its entire
length, and excellent prospects have
been reported from it.
STEWART RIVERâ The Stewart
River country has been long spoken of
as rich in gold, but further than the
fact that the bars at its mouth have
yielded good wages to a few prospect
ors fur years, little is known of it to
this day. It empties into the Yukon
seventy-five miles above Dawson.
Much interest is felt in the results of
the prospecting now being done and
which will continue during this sum
mer. A townsite is located at the
mouth, and the Canadian Government
will establish a post there.
McQUESTEN CREEK enters the
Yukon from the same side about 100
miles above Dawson, anci has its rise
near the source of the Stewart. Plat
inum has been found in this river.
WHITE RIVERâ The White River
empties into the Yukon from the west,
eighty-five miles abuve Dawson. A
party of fourteen men, headed by
Latham, Pond and Fairbanks, of San
Francisco, have been prospecting there
and report that they are well satisfied
with tneir finds. A big stampede took
place into this region in March. The
White River is a large stream and can
be navigated by small steamers.
810 AND LITTLE SALMON AND
WALSH CREEKSâ Quite a colony of
people were frozen in at both the Big
and Little Salmon rivers, thirty-seven
miles apart and 300 miles above Daw
son and 290 from Dyea. Among them
were Major Walsh, Commissioner
(Governor) of the Northwest Territory,
and the newly appointed officials of !
the Territory. Some prospecting and
stampeding took place in the neigh
borhood by the colonists, and Walsh
('reek was named, staked and pros
pected somewhat. It was the one
creek talked about this side of Salmon
River. I was told that $2 10 had been
taken out of three pans in the gravel.
MOOSEHIDEâ Going down the Yu
kon from Dawson the first creek in' the
mining: lists is Moosehide. It is a small
stream, coming into the big river Just
below the town. It was fully staked
early in the winter, but no finds worth
talking about are reported.
DEADWOOD CREEK is a little fur
ther down, about four miles from the
town. Two or three of the most re
markable stampedes of the early and
late winter took pla.ce there, and the
creek is staked all the way up on both
branches. Some big prospects were re- i
ported from the creek bottom and
gravel in the fall. Prospecting was
being carried on during the winter, a
shaft being sunk on discovery claim
just below the forks.
FORTY-MILE RIVER is about fifty
miles below or west of Dawson. It is
one of the oldest stations on the river,
and has a number of tributaries that
were formerly considered rich diggings,
especially Miller Creek, at one time the
richest diggings in the country. It is '
largely deserted now, but attention is
being redirected to them as with other
diggings on the American side.
BOUNDARY CREEKâ A long stride
down stream is made from this point !
to Boundary Creek, at the line between :
British and American territory. Dls- ;
covery was recorded In February, and
a stampede followed that took up the ;
whole creek. The discoverers claim to
have found 3 to 9 cents on the rim rock
and IS cents to $1 30 in the gravel.
Prospectors declare this creek will
prove among the richest of the late
discoveries.
It is situated about eighty-five to
ninety miles below Dawson. The boun
dary line crosses the creek about a
quarter of a mile above its mouth, this
quarter-mile being in Canadian terri
tory. The balance of the creek is in
Alaska.
AMERICAN and MISSION CREEKS
â Mission Creek is twenty miles fur
ther down stream, and American Creek,
its largest tributary, has attracted one
of the greatest stampedes of the win
ter. A hundred men at least traveled
down there from Dawson to stake.
American Creek is not a new field.
Many claims were being worked at a
good profit, according to pre-Bonanza
estimates, but they were deserted when
the big finds were made on the Klon- '
dike. Some of these claims lapsed
through neglect, and it was to recover
them that the stampede was started
from Dawson. Others following took j
up the new ground until the whole
creek waa staked.
BOY PRODIGY
AS A
YOUNG MAN
Josef Hofmann Is
Still a Great Pian
ist but He Has
Other Ideas Now.
SHE task that conf -onts young
Jo3ef Hofmann, the pianist, is
by no means an easy one. Ten
years ago he was a musical
prodigy, the admiration and
envy of little girls in short pet
ticoats, and the darling of plump, good
natured mammas. Now he has no in
fantile glamour to wrap himself up in.
It is true that he is young still and very
small, but he wears long trousers and
speaks in a bass voice. He is a man,
and as a man he must stand or fall.
His late performance at the Metropoli
tan Opera House, New York, was pro
nounced a brilliant success and the
critics think that he will win all the
fame as a man that his infancy gave
such promise of.
As a lad he was the pet of the
women, but as a young man he has not
the personal attractions of Paderewski.
It is not that he is ill looking; quite the
contrary, but he is somewhat unstrik
ing; he has no glorious and wonderful
head of hair, no commanding figure,
not even that wild and fantastic man
ner that goes straight to the heart of
the young miss. Hofmann is short,
standing about 5 feet 4 inches and
weighing but 113 pounds. He has short

hair, an unassuming manner, and when
in repose a plain, almost dull face.
Hofmann, however, is not always sol
emn and silent. Far from it. He is a
bright and fluent talker in many lan
guages and on many topics, and as he
is always deeply interested in what he
is talking about, it follows that those
who know him are surprised to hear
people criticizing the dullness of his
face.
In telling about his education the
other day he talked freely and fluently
of his life and ideas; he discussed ath
letics and automobillsm; he advanced
some sound opinions on musical sub
jects and also incidentally criticized the
New York system of street transit. He
did not mention the weather or say
how glad he was to get back in Ameri
ca, which is creditable, as showing him
to be a man of some originality.
Josef Hofmann is now 22 years of age,
though he looks considerably less. He
was born in Cracow, In Poland, and it
was there he received his early musical
education. Among his teachers was
Moszkowskl, with whom he studied for
two years.
His first appearance in public was at
the age of 5% years, when he played
at Warsaw. His parents, however.
CHARLEY RIVER AND COAL
CREEK are a day's journey farther
! down the Yukon and several stam
pedes took place there during the lat
ter part of the winter from Circle City
and Dawson, and reports of rich finds
| were received. Coal Creek has reeent
â ly been stampeded. It is ninety miles
above Circle City. The original pros
' pectors claim to have found 15 cents to
, the pan in gravel three feet from the
surface. A townsite was staked on
: the Yukon at the mouth of the creek.
THE BIRCH CREEK DIGGINGS,
which made Circle City the metropo
lis of the Yukon previous to the birth
lof Dawson, are big producers. They
1 comprise Mastodon, Independence,
Mammoth, Eagle, Porcupine, Miller,
! Harrison, Crooked and other creeks.
1 The mines pay from $10 to $50 a day
per man. This whole region is a vast
; gold field. Many claims were deserted
a year ago in the excitement following
the discoveries in the Northwest Terri
j tory, but all the mines have been tully
1 worked the past winter and a large j
1 output may be expected.
MINOOK CREEKâ The 500 people
who wintered below Fort^ lu
kon concentrated at Rampart City, at
, the mouth of Mlnook Creek, and con
siderable prospecting was carried on.
Minook Creek is thirty miles long. It \
is not entirely new, but has been pros
pected for four years. The work of
this past winter, which will be shown
in the wash up, will demonstrate just
what there is at Minook. All kinds
â of big prospects are reported from
there.
THE TANANA RIVER is the dream
!of the prospector. It is a large stream
entering the Yukon from the south 400
| miles below Fort Yukon. It is navi
judged that this was rather an early
beginning, so after, a few concerts they
tnuk him out of the blaze of publicity,
and for two years he remained a pri
vate individual. At the age of 7 the
boy again appeared in the same city,
this time to the accompaniment of a
full orchestra. This second essay
proved him a wonder, and he was at
once called by the well-known in
sario Wolff to Berlin.
His performance at the German capi
tal attracted the notice of the whole
musical world, and the boy now re
ceived flattering offers from many
lands. For the next few years he trav
eled from country to country and city
to city, gathering big audiences wher
ever he went.
In London in particular his success
was conspicuous, though there were
many who prophesied that the boy
would go the way of all other prodigies
â to the grave, a madhouse or oblivion.
Those dismal prophecies, fortunately,
have been unfulfilled, and it only needs
a few moments' conversation with the
young man to convince one that the
prospect of their fulfillment is remote,
for Hofmann is as healthy and sane a
youth as ever was.
At the age of 11 Josef Hofmann made
his first voyage across the Atlantic. In
New York his success was immediate
and striking. He played eighteen times
in New York and twelve in Brooklyn,
and always to crowded and enthusias
tic houses. He also played in Boston
and Washington.
With his American tour. Hofmann's
career as an infant prodigy came to
an end. The first warning note was
sounded by the Gerry Society, who
declared that it was against the law
of the land for a boy of his age to
perform in public. The matter, how
ever, was squared up somehow, and he
continued to perform in spite of the
society's remonstrance.
However, it was not for long, for his
parents were here on time and heeded
the advice of doctors, who warned them
that if they continued to allow their
son to play in public he would never
be any use in after life. Hofmann then
was temporarily retired and so ended
the career of the infant prodigy.
It was seven years before Hofmann
again emerged from obscurity. In the
meantime he studied hard, not only
music, but physics, electricity and au
tomobilism. Automobolism, in particu
lar, is his hobby, and he is having con
structed for him in Berlin an automo
bile car, in which he intends to make
his journeys in the future.
gable for quite a distance and will be
invaded and explored by miners and
commercial men this summer.
THE KUYOTUK RIVER enters the
Yukon from the n^rth below Fort Yu
kon and is another field that is at
tracting iiiiiH-rs now that the many
small steamers coming into the big
river bring the prospect of provisions
that have heretofore been impossible
in these distant and inaccessible re
gions. Several parties are heading for
the Kuyotuk, and even beyond.
What does an exodus of 100.000 to the
Klondike mean to the business of the
country? I have figured it out on the
basis of cost and proportion as ascer
tained, and it is this: That each man of
them woqld average first and last an
expenditure of $600, making a grand to
tal of $60,000,000. The United States
railroads would get $5,000,000 of this;
Seattle merchants and hotel keepers,
for outfits and transient guests, $25,000,
000; the prospector's home town and
towns en route to Seattle and other Pa
cific Coast poihts, $5,000,000; ship com
panies, for transportation to Alaska,
$10,000,000, and for the transportation
of freight over passes and in Alaska,
$15,000,000.
This would represent only the actual
needs of the number of prospectors and
would cause a large increase In other
businesses directly connected with it.
It means that in 1898 $60,000,000 will be
spent in the starch for gold in the yel
low creeks, and in the same year not
more than one-fourth <>t' that amount
will be produced. But the output is
likely to come nearer the expenee as
each year goes by, and in a few years
to exceed it.â Review of Reviews.INDIAN SCHOOL AT CARSON, NEV.

The woman had hardly received the
last congratulatory remark of her lis
teners upon her good judgment in this
way disposing of her property, when
one of her neighbors who had just
driven in dumped at her feet a corn
sack, which emitted a jingling sound,
and said to her astonishment:
"I noticed that you uns had left a
right smart lot of silver in your store
house for Morgan's men to melt up, so
I brung it along."
It appeared that this man, not know
ing of her departure, had stopped to
offer neighborly assistance to the "war
widow" and her children in their flight;
finding them already gone, and think
ing that they might have in their haste
left many needful things which he
could convey to them in his rwmy
farm wagon, he began searching and
came across the sack which contained
the silver.
The owner's curiosity to know what
she had really buried was not grati
fied until, on her return home, she dug
up a mouldy sack in which was a mass
of sprouting corn, of a choice variety,
which had been kept in the storeroom
for seed, and which the frightened boy
had seized in place of the sack contain
ing the silver.
Parties were at once organized to re

of its citizens. Among this class was
an old German woman, whose business
talents and capabilities for holding her
own had long oeen a subject for local
remark.
This woman was the owner of a span
of fine gray horses which, with others,
were demanded for the use of the Gov
ernment Believing that her refusal to
deliver up the horses would be sufficient
to send from her door the officer who
made the demand, she informed him
that she could not sell or loan them
to "the Government or anybody else."
At this the order was given for the
horses to be led away, and she then
commanded her two sons to resist the
"robbers," which they attempted to do,
but were soon compelled to desist.

upon the door of the house at which
the young man was a guest, on which
was written a few words of advice re

certain date. It had the effect of caus
ing him to stay in seclusion the fol
lowing day and make for home under
cover Of the next night's darkness.
The card with the line upon it was
found by some children, and this, cou

the story that he had been seized while
In bed, and after severe castigation led
beyond the town limits and told never

ATE A MUD PIE
AND
NOW EATS CLAY
TEN years ago Irene Jones, at play
with other children In the
"branch" which ran by the door
of her cabin home in Southern
Arkansas, ate a mud pie. She is now
a confirmed clay-eater and is one of
Dr. Sutter's patients at the City Hos
pital.
She is 23 years old. She was 13 when
she first tasted clay. She has eaten it
regularly ever since.
In the South, among the colored peo
girls may become. Those red-brown fin
gers which have learned to write and to
sew so well are hopelessly incapable
when it comes to a question of running
a typewriter, even. For the boys, too,
<;is;iiiy lias ordained only subordinate
positions. With a few "exceptions, I
found a surprising lack of ambition
among them. They expect and are con
tent to become farm hands, laborers and
kitchen servants.
"It isn't worth while," declared a Car
sonite. "What's the use of spending all
that money on Indian girls and boys
who'd be happier and just as well off out
in the campoodies, where they all wind
up sooner or later? Tnere's many a
white orphan lacks the care. tho6e girls
and boys get over yonder. And I tell
you. nine out of ten of 'em anyway go
back to the old life as soon as they're
allowed to leave the school. What's the
use of teaching 'em to dress and act ana
talk like white folks when they take to
the blanket and the moccasin as soon aa
they get back to the wickiup?"
The school at Carson is too young yet
to answer this question. It hasn't yet
sent out a young generation to battle
against old habits and inherited tenden
cies toward savagery. It can point to
individual cases, instances of such excel
lence that one is tempted to idealize. But
enough time has not yet passed for the
gathering of statistics which will .show
what proportion of Indian boys and girls
"stay put."
Uncle Sam, however, intends that they
pie, clay-eaters are as common as
"dope" ciiin in St. Louis. Onve ac
quired the habit takes such a firm hold
on a person that it is next to impossi
ble to shake it off.
The strength of the habit does not
seem to depend so much on the effects
produced as upon the acidulous taste of
the lighter quality of clay found in the
South, which contains among other ele
ments silica and alum.
There is a belief that, as In the case
of Irene Jones, the habit originally had
its rise in the tasting by children of
make-believe pies made of the clay.
It is in this way at least that the
habit is acquired by white people in
the South. Of late years a great many
young ladies of good families have be
come slaves to the habit. The explana
tion given by them has always been
that while playing as children with col
ored girls of their own age, they were
induced to eat the mud pies and quickly
became addicted to the habit.
Irene Jones is suffering from inflam
matory rheumatism, and her condition,
is due, in large measure, it is) belleveu,
to her clay-eating propensities.
She came here a month ago from
Southern Arkansas and secured work
as a servant ; t 3923 Washington av
enue, i
The clay here Is not as good as the
Arkansas article, and she told the doc
tor she had not been eating It very reg
ularly.
The desire for clay does not come on
her at regular intervals.
"I eat it when I want it, and when I
don't want it I let it alone," she said.
WATER A CURE FOR INDIGESTION.
"We must give special attention to
the outside of the body as well as the
inside," writes Mrs. P. T. Rorer on
"What to Eat When You Harp Indiges
tion," in the March Ladies' Home Jour
nal. "The skin must be bathed every
morning with tepid water, followed by
a brisk rub. This is equally as important
as correct diet. A good rule is to use
water freely inside and out. At least
I two quarts of water daily should be
i taken: half a pint the first thing in the
! morning and the last thing at night, a
| cupful of warm water before each meal,
and the remaining quantity divided and
taken before meals."

GREAT DANGER ON
BIG WAR VESSELS
Accidents that have befallen war ships in times of peace when no one was
looking for any danger.
The capsizing of the Royal George is
probably the most disastrous accident
on record. It was the flagship of K^ar
Admiral Richard Kempenfeldt. The j
ship was anchored off Spithead at the
mouth of the Thames. A pipe below
the water line needed some repairs, and |
as It was so simple an affair the ship
was not docked. In order to get at the j
pipe the ship was "heeled," or listed to j
one side by running one broadside of j
guns from orie side over to the other, j
The Royal George was a line of battle- !
ship and the pride of the British navy \
and in full commission. All her offi- j
cers and men were on board, together |
with any number of their visiting
friends, to say nothing of a swarm of
trades people. Soon after she was |
"heeled" a stiff land breeze sprung up !
and the great ship capsized. Nearly
eight hundred people were drowned.
The battleship Eastern Monarch an- i
chored off Spithead on June 2, 1559. She j
had Just reached home port after a
voyage from India and had on board,
not only her own officers and crew, but
a great number of invalids from the
army and navy stationed in India. She I
had in all over 500 men and officers tm
board. Many had been absent from i
home for years. There was great re
joicing that night when the Eastern
Monarch anchored within sight of the
shores of old England. During the j
merriment a lamp was upset, and the j
ship burned to the water's edge, with
great loss of life.
A similar accident destroyed H. M. P.
Goliath on the night of December 22,
1575, just three days before Christmas.
She was a training ship, and had aboard
over 500 officers, men and boys, mostly j
boys. She had just returned from a ,
long cruise and lay in the Thames. The
bpys were anticipating the Christmas
festivities, and in their pranks upset a
try."
And it's treason to the spirit of Amer
ican institutions to believe that that time
will never come.

lamp in the oil room. The ship was a
total loss, but this time the loss of life
was comparatively small.
The boys on the sailing frigate Eury
diee -were not so fortunate. She was
homeward bound from the Bermudas.
About 300 officers, men and boys were
on board, and she came up along the
Isle of Wight with every sail drawing
and her ports open, off Yentnor, the
famous watering place on the Isle of
Wight, tliv boya manned the rigging
and cheered and cheered to those on
the beach. A squall struck the old
frigate, over she went and nearly ev
ery person on board was drowned right
before the eyes of hundreds of persona
within hailing distance on shore.
Tf>n years before Ericsson built the
monitor Captain Cowper Cowles of the
P.ritish navy invented what he called
a turret-ship. It was not until some
years later that the I^ord High Ad
miral accepted the captain's plans and
ci-d. red a turret ship built. H. M. S.
tin was launched in ISB9 and
ed to be a "hoodooed'" ship from
the start. She was a full rigged iron
ship, armored and with steam as
an auxiliary power. High bulwarks
were int< nded to be let down, uncover
ing the two turrets when the ship was
cleared for action.
<>n September 7. IS7O, she was sailing
in tho Hay of Biscay. A squall sprung
up and Btruck the tophe&vy ship full
abeam. She "heeled" over and never
righted- Of the i'M persons on board
1 hteen were saved. When the
court martial sat to try some one for
negligence in losing the ship the only
n they could try was James May,
a gunner. Every other officer was lost.
The Victoria, with 700 persona
aboard, capsized in the Thames on
May '24, 1881, and over 3<>u were
drowned. In the merchantman serv
ice hundreds of ships and thousands of
lives have been lost right in port, when
th<> ship is supposed above all other
times to be safe. It is only a few days
ago that considerable wreckage was
done right here in San Francisco har
bor.

SOCIETY
HE event of the past week was the J

end and on both sides of the room. After
an elaborate menu had been discussed,

Mrs. Sciplo Craig, lirst historian of the
chapter, gave a stirring address on "Our
Flag." Letters of greeting were received
from various sources. The greetings of
the California Society of the Sons of the
American Revolution were represented by
a magnificent palm, the emblem of vic
tory, beautifully decorated with silk flags,
resting in a handsome blue and white
jardiniere, the whole supported by a ma
hogany tabourette. This fraternal cour
: tesy on the part of the sons was received ;

of the late Judge Turrill. and grand

The wedding of Dr. William E. Gomm
Of Savannah, Ga., and Miss Adelaide
Theresa, eldest daughter of P. Cleary of j

Wednesday morning, April 20, in St.
Peter's Church, in the presence of a fash
ionable company, which thronged the
â acred edifice to the very doors.
Holders of the dainty cards which se- |
cured admission to the church began to
arrive a good half-hour before the ap
pointed time for thÂ« nuptials, and found
the church handsomely decorated with
\ plants and foliage, stately palms giving
a garden-like appearance to the sanctu- j
ary, and waving frouds of Woodwardla i
fern standing sentinel over the aisles.
With commendable promptness the
bride and her attendants reached the 'â 
church at 10:30 o'clock and proceeded to ,
the altar In the following order: The

â¢ on a tiny silver salver; two little flower
girls, the Misses Irma Fraacoeur and
Marie Payne; the maid of honor, Miss
Eva Cleary; and lastly the bride, leaning
on her father's arm.
The groom, attended by his best man,
Frank C. Clean', awaited his bride*
coming in the sanctuary, and on receiving
her from her father led her to the
priediou, where the happy couple and
their immediate attendant's knelt during
the solemn ceremony, in which they
, plighted their troths.
: Immediately the merry sounds of the
wedding march ceased, and then, as the j
â  sacred strains of a grand mass rever
' berated through the church, a procession '
of acolytes and clergy, richly vested, en
â¢ tered from the sacristy and began the
solemnization of the sacred office. The j
pastor. Rev. Father Casey, was cele
brant; Rev. Father .McDonald, deacon;
Rev. Father Lyon, sub-deacon; and. Rev. ',
Dr. Morrison master of ceremonies.
At the close of the nuptials the blessing
of the church was Imparted to the happy â¢

ENERGETIC WOMEN
IN NEW ENTERPRISES
ROOM IN A BERKELEY PHOTOGRAPH GALLERY STARTED BY TWO ENERGETIC YOUNG WOMEN.
SO much Js being said and written about woman's
work nowadays that the bright, energetic woman is
ever on the alert for a satisfactory enterprise by
which she can earn her living and at the same time
develop her talents as a business woman. All wo
men may not be preachers, physicians, teachers or lawyers,
nor is the kitchen the only alternative. Almost any intel
ligent woman can, by looking about her, find some em
ployment that is at once profitable and interesting.
One girl, while staying at her father's cottage at
the sea shore, suddenly found herself face to fare with the
problem of supporting herself. Educated without a defi
nite object in view, the outlookâ to her friendsâ seemed
discouraging to say the least. But being a girl to whom
the word failure was unknowi. and domestically inclined,
she set her brain to work and conceived the brilliant idea
of earning money by serving the neighboring cottagers and
hotel people with ice cream, tea, cake, etc., on the piazza
of her cottage, which she arranged comfortably and at
traptively for the purpose. Of course everybody came,
not only to enjoy what she had to serve, which was of the
best quality and served in the daintiest, most appetizing
way possible, but to encourage as well.
At the end of the season she returned to town with a
-snug sum of money in her purse, her head full of ideas
and a light heart, conscious of independence in the future.
She rented two rooms in the business portion of the city
one of which was furnished as a kitchen and the other, a
large, pleasant, sunny room, as a tea room. The wall
decorations, furniture and dishes were Japanese, and a
prettier, daintier tea room it would be difficult to imagine.
After engaging a trim, first-class waitress, she announced
to her friends and acquaintances that she was prepared to
serve shoppers with tea, coffee, chocolate, bouillon, salads,
sandwiches, cake, etc., at reasonable prices during the
hours of 12 and 4 in the afternoon.
Within one month of its opening this unique tea room
had acquired a splendid reputation and was the source of
a very comfortable income to its proprietress. The secret
of the success of this enterprising girl was due to her in
sight into human nature. She knew people invariably go
where they can get the best for the outlay.
The morning hours were devoted to the careful prepara
tion of the dishes to be served and keeping the place ex
quisitely clean. Why shouldn't she succeed? Of course it
is work, but work brings success. Any girl of average
strength and intelligence can do as well.
Places of this description are an absolute necessity In
the shopping districts of every large town or city. Many
women object to the noise and confusion of large restau
rants and would gladly patronize a nice quiet tea room.
Another brave girl who had been carefully educated and
trained for the social position she was accustomed to and
always expected to occupy found, when reverses came,
that she was utterly unfitted to battle with the world!
Like many another well-educated (?) woman she couldn't
do any one thing well enough to make her services valu
able to any one. But she didn't sit down and bemoan her
fate and like Micawber, wait for "something to turn up."
Not a bit of it. Since she couldn't alter them she made
the best of existing circumstances and looked about her to
see what she really could do.
She had always been invaluable to her married friends
in assisting them to entertain and in that way had ac
quired considerable experience and self-possession, for
which she was greatly admired. It occurred to her that
she might continue to be useful to her friends and at the
same time support herself. So she called on them and of
fered to take entire charge of dinners, receptions, teas, at
homes, etc., for the sum of $5 a function.
It proved a happy thought and was eagerly accepted.

DEL MONTE, April 23.-The disciples
of Izaak Walton are enjoying themselves
hugely here at present, and since the trout I
season opened fishing in the adjacent
brooks and rivers has been the all-ab
sorbing business for many. The Ameri
can girls are emulating their English and :
Scotch sisters, it seems, and several of
the young ladies down here can cast a
fly and play a trout with as great skill i
and patience as any of their masculine j
companions.
A Jolly party of New Yorkers that en- i
Joyed a day's fishing at Las Laurellas I
Rancho on the Upper Curmel River this j
week consisted of Mr. and Mrs. C. A
Thome, Dr. Chesebrough, Mrs. Isaac !
Martin, Miss Hay den, Mr. and Mr?. A.
A. Boyd and Miss Lansing. A dainty i
country' luncheon at the ranch house was ,
served for the anglers, and after a long i
day oi pleasure they returned to Del
erate income and social duties to discharge with but one
servant and that one often an inefficient maid, how very
difficult it is to appear at ease and what mental tortures
are endured when the success of an entertainment depends
on the management of a clumsy servant. It is quite im
possible to receive one's friends and at the same time direct
the servants. She agreed to help decorate the rooms and
tables, pour tea, at dinners superintend the serving of
courses in their proper order and when necessary help pre
pare desserts, dressings, etc.. thus relieving the hostess o*
all responsibility. She is kept busy most cf the time and
among her most intimate friends she isâ when It la possi
bleâoften a guest at the functions she so cleverly manages
Of course it is absolutely necessary to possess a
thorough knowledge of polite society, good taste and the
ability to arrange flowers prettily. And above all things
tact, tact, tact. Let the- girl who is doing this kind of
work never for a moment forget that during the hours
she is employed she is in business, not in society and in
sist on being treated in a purely business way by the
woman who is employing her, regardless of the footing
they meet on at other times.
Another notable business scheme undertaken by women
is the recent venture of two young ladies in Berkeley-
Miss Mary Bisbee and Miss Carrie Haskins.
They are photographers for business. They established
their studio in November last and went about it as if bread
and butter depended upon it, as indeed it really did
They had the advantage of each having been employed
in a first-class gallery, and luckily for them they had been
educated in different lines of photographic art. As their
plans of partnership began to hatch they bent their ener
gies to mastering every department.
From the first they, agreed that the gallery they were
to establish should be up to date and strictly first-class
That no gallery run by men should exceed theirs in reai
excellence. Then, they reasoned, a just share of patronage
might be depended upon. They had heard that many ladies
prefer women operators for themselves and also that
mothers believed them to be more skillful in catching the
pretty, natural poses of their children, as the little ones
feel more at ease in their presence.
The young ladies counted on all these things, but they
did not build on the patronage they were destined to re
ceive from the university student?.
There seem to be a large majority of these young menâ
to say nothing of young womenâ wtio prefer the work done
by Bisbee & Haskins to any other. Whether it is because
they think their skill exceptional 4 or whether they believe
in the "new woman" type is not clear, but it is certain
that they like the combination of the strictly business
women and the graceful, dainty girls whose womanly taste
displays itself not only in their attire and general appear
ance, but gleams out all over the house from every nook
and corner.
Prior to" their occupation last November they leased an
old but comfortable house adjacent to the principal busi
ness block. Of course it had to be remodeled to make a
good operating room on the top floor. Then it must be re
paired, refitted and furnished throughout.
When all this was done the expense was only fairly
begun, for they must have high-grade cameras and ap
paratus in order to run their "first-class gallery" uDon
which they had set their hearts.
One of the young ladies said: "When we came on
November 1 we had nothing belonging to our art but a
lead pencil and a paint brush. Since that time we have
paid all rent, refitting, remodeling and furnishing bills
paid for all apparatus and last month were pleased to find
six bits apiece for our personal income.
"As we are now square with the world we expect to not
only make a good living, but keep abreast of the times
with our art. We shall never ask or wish for patronage
on account of being ladies; we shall compete with men on
equal terms."
Monte over the celebrated I,iiiirHlaÂ«
grade.
Miss Whitney, daughter of ex-fleore
tary of , the Navy William C. Whitney,
and two other New York girls, the Mlhhcb
Kernochan, , made up another fishing
party to the Carmel and Hun JoÂ»Â« Creek
on Friday. All threo young ladiÂ«-H are
expert anglers, and a goodly number of
fine trout was the result of their day's
fun. ... i
Lady William Van Home, wife of Sir
William Van Home, president of the Ca
nadian Pacific Railroad, is here, with her
daughter, for an extended stay. Sir Wil
liam Van Home will Join them during

HOLLAND'S NEW
SEA FIGHTERS
Continued from Page Seventeen.
This is one of the moat difficult fac
tors in the problem. The men who go
down into the waters in these boats
must take their lives in their hands,
Once they are sealed under the hatches,
whether they accomplish their mission
of destruction or not, their chances of
return to God's sunlight are infinitely
small.
The advance of modern electrical sci
ence has rendered possible many things
which were impossible even a genera
tion ago, and therefore we may hope
for better results from the Holland
boat than from the famous Davids,
which the Confederates constructed,
and employed with such disastrous re- |
suits to themselves.
The firnt David, so named after its
inventor, was built at Charleston in
1863. The material used was boiler
plate, and the craft was propelled by
the power of eight men working a
crank. Three times was this unfortun
ate vessel tried, and every time she re
fused to rise to the surface after disap
pearing beneath the face of the waters.
All on board perished, yet men were
found ready to man her a fourth time,
when, marvelous to relate, her errand
jof death was successful. She made her
i way out of Charleston harbor, sought
I and found the ivorthern vessel Housa
i tonic, and blew her up with s. torpedo.
Unable to clear herself from the wreck
in time, she went down with her vic
tim, and this was the last of the Da
vid's career. Several other boats of the
same pattern were constructed by the
rebels, but they r.ever achieved any
thing of note.
Though this is perhaps the only re
corded instance where a submarine
boat has been successfully used in ac
tion, the idea, like most other ideas un
der the sun. is by no means new. It is
centuries old. As far back as the be
ginning of the seventeenth century a
Dutchman named Cornelius Drebel
constructed a submarine boat on the
Thames and induced King James I to
sanction its trial. Far in advance of
his times, he proposed to use artificial
air to sustain the lives of those on
board; but as history does not record
what became of this Dutchman and his
boat, we may presume that the enter
prise was a failure. The next inventor
in the field was a rash individual of the
name of Day, who in 1774 made a de
scent in Plymouth harbor in a vessel of
fifty tons which he had fitted out for
the purpose. He accomplished the de
scent right enoughâ most ships will
sink when the conditions are favora
bleâbut he failed to come to the sur
face again.
A year later the New Englanders,
ever of an inventive turn, took a hand
in the game. One Bushnell of Connec
ticut built a vessel to be propelled by
screws, very much like those now in
use. At the end of the century Ful
ton, the famous steamboat inventor,
developed the idea still further. He
used compressed air. and with its aid
was enabled to contrive a boat which
actually remained four hours beneath
the water, at a depth of twenty-five
feet. The boat could be propelled in
any direction, and during a series of
experiments in Brest Harbor he antici
pated modern warfare by attaching a
torpedo to the bottom of a vessel and
blowing he. up.
Still, the time was not ripe for thr use
of a torpedo. For more than half a
century the old wooden w^llls and
smooth-bore guns were to prevail. Now
and again during this long period some
rash inventor would make tentative ex
periments, but nothing came of it, un
til, as we have seen, the Confederates
produced their Davids. The attention
of the scientific world was aroused
Nofdonfelt was the first to produce
a really modern vessel of this charac
ter. In 1886 he built at Stockholm a
submarine boat which proved capable
of descending to a depth of thirty
feet, and steaming sixteen miles at a
speed of five knots. Next year he built
a still larger one at Southampton, cap
able of steaming fifteen knots an hour
and developing 1000 horsepower.
Though the experiments with these
boats gave apparently satisfactory re
sults, it was felt that they could hard
ly be depended upon for work in act
ual warfare. The chief defect lay in
the motive power, which was steam.
Thus, when the boat went below the
surface, all draught had to be shut off
and the engines driven by the supply
of heated steam which remained in the
boilers. Of course this became rapid
ly exhausted, and in order to get up
steam it was necessary for the boat to
come on top again. In action such a
defect as this might easily prove fa
tal, for the boat might be compelled
to show herself at a time when the
enemy's guns could bear upon her with
destructive effect.

T<HE BUSINESS WOJAJLN'S
WARDROBE
BLI'E serge has been so long a fa
vorite for street wear that it might
seem to be out of date, but It is to
be used finite as much this spring
and summer. Made in tight-fitting short
jacket, with plain gored skLrt, It is too
serviceable and useful to be discarded.
In the East pray will be worn very
much, but the yhops here have few at
tractive acceteories In gray. Blue whip
cord serge made in coat like the model,
trimmed in fancy braid in black or blue,
with the Bame trimming repeated on the
skirt is a pretty novelty and very effec-
tive.
The coat lined with blue-gray taffeta,
with a silk waist of the same material,
makes a must satisfactory dress.
( me style of waist is made effective by
small box plaits from shoulder to belt,
both !>ack and front. It is closed under
the front plait. The stock and collar are
made from two shades of grreen taffeta.
Cut the ends for the bow of the darker
shade and line with the light, using the
light shade for the center knot. Make the
belt the same, allowing the lining to just
show above and below. Make it long
enough to pass twice around the waist,
and tuck in the end, fastening it with a
fancy pin.
There is a very pretty new linen for
shirt waist. It is fine in quality and comes
in stripes and plain at 50 cents a yard.
Three and a half yards will be required.
The fullness of the new waist comes in
the shoulder rather than in the neckband,
as last year. The organdies make dainty
shirt waists, as does also white dotted
swiss, which wears better.
In San Francisco cloth waists made
?\iite like the cotton waists are more com
ortable than the ihinner ones. Cloth will
be worn quite as much as the silk, and
wears better in the office. Waists are so
easily made and so inexpensive there can
be no excuse for a woman who wears old
"best dress" waist in an office. No em
ployer likes to see an untidy woman in his
office. He may never betray the fact that
he notices such tilings, but he does just
the same, and appearances count with
him. too.
The English walking hat, with high bell
shaped crown, trimmed in long drooping
quills, will vie with the plain parlor hat,
and to some women is more becoming.
In gloves the newest ones come with
stitching the same shade as the glove.
Many women make it a practice to wear
always the same shade of glove. As one
â¢who dresses in dark colors adopts a black,
another a gray, another a tan. Either of
the latter will harmonize with any gown;
another favorite is very light or white.
These latter some consider more economi
cal, as they clean so readily. It can be
done at home by washing on the hand
with a good toilet soap and milk.
Be careful not to make the glove wet,
and rub it quite dry on the hand with a
soft towel.
Thin dresses can be so little worn here
they scarcely pay for themselves, how
ever pretty they may be, but the wash
skirts will be found very serviceable.
There is a new material, crispine, at f>o
cents a yard, which makes up very pret
tily, and without lining will laundry nice
ly." Made with a short jacket ending in a
belt, to be worn over a shirt waist, it will
be found comfortable and neat for the
warm dusty weather.
T.HE BACHELOR, GIRL
JLND .HER PJWJMJIS
THE girl bachelor is leaving the im
print of her strong personality on
every article of wearing apparel be
longing to her sex. She has revo
lutionized the fashion of neck dressing,
and though strenuous efforts have been
made by the manufacturers to introduce
pretty chiffon and tulle fancies for this
purpose, tiie mannish collar and cravat
were never so much to the fore aa they
are to-day.
Not content with remodeling the out
side costume of her sisters, her cousins
and her aunts, she now steps in and, in
the superior arrogance of her position of
independence of thought and action, she
Bays to them: "You must wear pajamas.
They are more comfortable, and to-day
we are all for comfort, and not for fur
belows."
The edict having gone forth, we find on
the counters and shelves of one of our
department stores a full and varied stock
of women's pajamas. They are slowly
but surely gaining headway, and the
woman whose heart yearns for the filmy
lace, embroidery and dainty boribboned
robes de nuit of the past, is ashamed to
follow this essentially feminine longing
and reluctantly turns to the pajama
counter.
The Bwellest night dress Is, as we nil j
know, an elaborate affair, full and long
and clinging about one in classic folds,
and oh! so essentially womanly and be- j
coming. It is dainty and attractive, but I
\vi>t'uiiy in the way of the girl bachelor,
who has to jump out of bed to close her ;
windows, climb on chairs and tables to
put out her lights, and the hundred and
one other things which a woman, wheth
er she bo a girl bachelor or a lovesick old
time maiden, always leaves until the last
moment before retiring.
Therefore she will have none of them,
and having hoard from her brother just j
how comfortable and not at all in the
way the pajamas are. she has decided to
adopt, and by dint of repeated requests
fur thorn in the stores she has succeeded
in bringing the dealer to a realization of
thfi necessity of keeping these articles in
stock. So now they can be had for the
asking.
The fashionable up-to-date pajamas are
not bad to look upon, and it is stated that
they are by no means unbecoming to the
fair wearers. They are made of wash
silks in dainty colors and also of thin
madras and cheviot. The waists of some
Oi them are finished with silk cord, while
others are fastened with ribbons and
have laeo trimmed collars.
Those who have worn them say they
are fur cooler in summer and warmer
in winter than any other style of Bleep*
Ing garment. By their advocates it is
predicted thnt they are here to stay;
their opponents prophesy that they will
be sYiort-lived irt their popularity. The
dealers do not look for an extended sale
and demand for them; they say that, like
the divided skirt, they will die a natural
death in a very short time, for there is
nothing dearer to the dainty woman's
heart than her becoming lace frilled night
gownâ nothing more becoming to a young
or old face than a pretty night dress.
Women, say what you may, strong
minded or old fashioned, are all vaiu.
and a fashion which promises to be un
becoming is doomed at its birth.
BRIGHT COLORS
FOR
"BEST DRESSED MEN"
BRIGHT colors and plenty of them,
unique and original combinations
of tints and designs, will char
acterize the gear of every well
dressed man this summer and spring.
It is to be a "gay clothes" year in a
remarkable degree. While the most of
the novelties are designed for the young
er men of swelldom and the gorgeous
raiment will be worn, in the main, by
them, there are yet temptations in the
way of garments and sundries put forth
for* the older citizen of the fashionable
sets that he will hardly be able to resist.
Thus every one of that portion of New
York's mankind that taUeS a pride in
keeping up with the fresh mandates of
tailors and haberdashers will begin to
display In a week or two some fantasies
of dress that will seem odd and novel.
Many of fashion's kinks this spring are
strange and radical.
You should wear a green flannel out
ing suit, for example, if you would keep
well up to the mode of the day as it
will be when the first hot weather comes,
a green flannel with' a tiny white stripe
in it, while the popular country' hat this
year is the dark green Prince of Wales
shooting hat, a soft felt that is left high
in the crown and is never creased, with
a feather, or. what Is still better form,
what is known as a "brush" stuck in his
band.
It is in Bhirts, hose, handkerchiefs and
neckgear, however, that fashion â and
the very beat fashion, mindâ is running
riot with itself. Pinks, blues, greens and
yellows, all of pale tints, abound, and
are the best of form. The color of the
year, though, is heliotrope, used in bars
and irregular checks for shirts, and to
mark the pattern on a ground of dead
black, in neckties and hose.
The "best-dressed men," as the phrase
goes, seem to increase in number in
New York each twelvemonth. This is the
opinion of experts. There Is now no
young man who could lay claim to the
"title of being the very best-dressed man.
Where there was one some years ago
there are now half a dozen who rank
equally in this regard. More careful
thought is being given to clothes on the
part of the average young men of the
day, it is said, and the average standard
is "much higher. Probably five of the
best dressed in New York to-day are J.
Lee Taller, l<reuerick Gebhard. K. i.
Wilson Jr., V. G. Hall and Eugene de
P Shirts this spring show , mc h startling
patterns and tints. That which fashion
has set its especial mark of approval on
is a pattern of thin bars or color, three
bands composed of live of these bars
running up and down and . al * bands
across. Thus a suirt front of this sort
shows eighteen email patches of check
where the live bars cross five other bars
at right angles to them. The bars are so
narrow that the checks are not large and
make possible goou-sized open spaces or
white linen. This is a very effective
shirt.-- neither exaggerated nor yet very
"quiet." It is to be worn with a white
collar, but with cuffs of its own. The
shops are making them in pinks helio
tropes and blues, though the heliotrope
is the shirt that seems to rule. The pink
I here is very nearly a red. and a green of
i a pale tone is also permissible.-
Two other varieties of shirts that are
! novel are those that have their stripes
- across, one with rows of ban4s. about
half an inch wide and an inch apart, the
] other with a cluster of three much nar
rower bands, then a space of white of a
! width of an inch, another cluster of
bands, the same separation, and so on
' down. These patterns are yet in the
same- colors as those mentioned above.
Yet another stylo indorsed ,by fashion
< has bosoms of combination- colorings in
very pale reds and yellows, a mild, faint,
unobtrusive plaid, much like gingham
patterns. Shirts of these types cost $4 50
apiece. . ,
It is not by any manner of means the
'â  fashion to match the colored shirt with
the necktie that is worn. The neckgear
in its general colors should simply be in
harmony with the shirt. The coming
necktie for afternoon is larger than ever
before, fully a third as large again. | It is
tied in much the same Ascot or puff
fashion, only an effort should be made to
li.fve it - appear rounder and puffier than
formerly.
Some men have devised a very clever
way of accomplishing this. "When they
have adjusted the loop, just before they
are ready to fold . c lonK ends ovÂ»:r and
put the pin into place, they slip a folded
sock into the loop, thus bulging that part
of the scarf out appreciably. When the
ends are folded over the sock cannot be
seen.
The favored scarf patterns will be a
figured heliotrope or purple stripe on a
black ground, a green stripe on a black
ground that is touched with a faint red,
a dark blue ground with a black stripe
in it, and the very new and curious
j viadier or vertical stripes of black on
I a blue ground. For men who want very
gorgeous colors there is a brilliant green
] silk patterned in a silver white, diamond,
; and a no less gay red with a yellow dia
i mond. For field wear the latest is an
â  Indian kerchief of red with curious white
j figures in it.
Scarfplns are athletic this spring. Tal
' lyho horns, French horns, polo crooks,
I golf sticks and racquets, all in miniature
i perfection and of sold, are the proper
i thing. For Sundays these are not cor
| rect. and the wise man wears a pearl or
a little golden baÂ»Â». The most fashionable
| of all, though, and that which will be the
most worn, is a blanket pin of gold, pre
cisely like that used in the stable, about
two inches long.
I Of a greater vogue than ever are stocks.
| The stock itself is invariably of white
duck. Nowadays it should not be
Starched stiffly. The newest has a piece
of celluloid that is slipped in on the in
j side to keep it stiff. The necktie or scarf
| appended to it is most usually of some
i pattern of red, for the stock's most fre
| quent use is on the golf field. There are
; many other varieties of stocks, however.
It is one of the newest fashions of the
i day for a girl to make her best young
; man stocks of her gingham gown pat
terns, that he may have neckwear corre
COLLEGE WOMEN`S
OPINION OF
COLLEGE MEN
I WAITED in the pleasant parlor of
the Girls' Fraternity for the presi
dent of the Associated Women Stu
dents to appear. A table with some
dainty tea things stood invitingly by,
delightfully suggestive â¢ of feminine
tuste the world over.
The president, Miss Marion Whipple
of Los Angeles, is a typical college wo
man, tall, self-possessed, with an intel
lectual face. She grasped my idea in
stantly and settled back luxuriously in
her chair, the better to discuss the col
lege-bred man.
"The college men of Berkeley seem
! rather young to me, as I compare them
with the Eastern college men I know.
I think it is because we are allowed
to enter with less required work to our
credit. As to their attractiveness?
Certainly the environments are the |
most favorable for proper development, !
the environments of college life, but
everything depends on the man. With
out the right material to act on, the j
environment can do nothing, of course.
"One always wonders why some men i
ever come to college. I think men '
who never go to college sometimes are
quite as attractive as the college-bred
men, but it means more when they
! are. They deserve more credit for
i what they have taken on of polish.
"How do I regard the Berkeley men \
from the social standpoint? They fall
into two classes â one class, the small
minority, who are discourteous and
rude, I will not discuss. Their faults
are due most likely to wrong home
training; but the other class, the cour
teous, helpful men, I will discuss. They
are thoughtful of little things, and de
lightful at parties. Of course there
are some who have been spoiled, but
one expects that. Then they are en
thusiastic over athletics and the true
college woman likes that â she is en
thusiastic herself."
"Are not Berkeley men of the opinion
that the really nice, high-bred sort of
girl doesn't take a college course?"
"Oh, no indeed! That iz a. tradition
that has been handed down, but it is
pretty well exploded now. They like
usâ that is, collectively. We are en
tirely welcome here."
"But is it not true that in extending
Invitations to hops they give the prefer
ence to the young society ladies of Oak
land and San Francisco?"
Miss Whipple laughed. "That is an-
other tradition. I have always thought
they invite the girls they know best.
The college etiquette is very rigid here
and acquaintances a not easily made.
When* the college boya get up a hop
they want the girls to come that they
know well, and those who have been
brought up in San Francisco and Oak
land naturally Invite young ladies from
those places â those at whose homes
they have been entertained most
likely.
"I think on the whole their standard
of womanhood is high. The sentimental,
foolish girl ia rot encouraged here. If
ever she comes here by mistake the
hard work or the lack of a.\ .reciation
on the part of the masculine side of the
university drives her away again. Col
lege engagements rarely occur â it is j
different from Stanford in that re
spect."
Very different from the quiet parlor
of the girls' fraternity h use was the
busy waiting-room at North Hall. Co
eds were everywhere and the air was
full of the hum o '. these literary bees. !
The two rather gloomy waiting-rooms â 
are the exclusi- c property of the uni- :
versity girls. Hr c they tell their se- ;
crets, prepare their lessons and eat |
their lunches.
Above the hum of voices floated the
| words: "He is the most out and out
i woman hater I ever saw. Of course
j you knov.' about â "
| My euide through this maddening
sponding to all her prettiest summer
dresses. Stocks of crcpnn- that is, tho
neckwear part of them of creponâ are
exceedingly popular as well, and much
in the mode.
Boots are little changed, the differences
being in still more rounded toes and bip
ger soles. Gayly plalded handkerchiefs
with no sign of white aro jihroad In the
land.
As regards hats, the top hat has very
little roll or shaping, the derby is much
flatter in the crown and very much
smaller. Small lightweight hats, even in
straws, are the order of the season. Knox
says that the green Princo of Wales will
be" the hat of the year for out of town,
though '.he demand for it has hardly set
in as yet.
The cloth in fashion is natural home
spun, rough hand-made homespun, the
top coat with a velvet collar and double
breasted lapel*. It is a single-breasted
coat, and has narrow turned up cuffs
bound with velvet. It is cut very full.
To be fully in the fashion you should
have a morning coat that is a long-walst
ed cutaway with a broad back and a very
full straight-cut front with flaps at the
Bide. The waist line is exceedingly low,
and will make this coat a marked one.
The pockets are cut below the waist
seam.
Waistcoats are more gorgeous than
ever, the patterns more pronounced. A
few Of these freaks of fashion it is well
to remember. A very favorite color will
be gray. A- popular frock co;u is very

gray color. Broken checks will be much

throng smiled intelligently at these
words. "They are discussing one of
the professors now. There are certain
characteristics by which each one is
known."
A young woman with soft brown
hair and brown eyes sat with me in a
corner. She is a graduate student and
very bright.
"Do college women prefer college
bred men?" she repeated. "Yes, on the
whole I think they do. The facts
stand something like this. The college
woman of to-day is not the be-specta
cled blue-stocking of a former genera
tion. Many years of widening opportu
nities have come to accustom her to her
privileges and to emancipate her from
the freakishness of which in her social
isolation she used to be guilty. Is
this the line of treatment you wish me
to follow?
"Well, then, it seems to me that in
tellectually she stands on common,
ground with man. She doesn't forget
as she used to that spiritually she
is different from man â that there is the
feminine and the masculine in human
nature â that neither is complete with
out the other, that both are needed for
truest development. Her demands are
high-moral purity, intellectual insight,
and the strength to do and dare. Men.
must have these qualities in order to
\tin her respect."
"Are not these basal qualities which
one mi?rht expect in all men?"
"Possibly. The college woman would
be narrow indeed in her culture if she
despised sterling worth in a man be
cause he had not had her own superior
advantages. But in general society,
how many that are not college-bred
have these qualities! Political jugglery,
the narrow horizon of the business
w<rrld, and a tendency to plod along in
ruts is the common order.
"But the college man? Well, he has
been in contact with great minds â he
has had access to all the wisdom of the
ages for a time at least â that is, if he
wished for success. And according to
evolution, he can never go back to just
where he was before; there has been
infused into his nature a spiritual es
sence.
" 'As to the comradeship of life?' The
college woman can afford to wait ami
judge. She knows that life will be aa
she makes it; but as Ella Wheeler Wil
cox says, she will make it according to
the kind of man whose love she ac
cepts. And I believe I am risrht in
thinking that she more often trusts the
man who has had the same training as
1 herself, and the same broad outlook;
upon life and Its possibilities."
A bell rang and the graduate girl hur
ried away to a class.
Said the senior girl in her turn:
"Other things being equal, yes, But
unfortunately strong meat is not meant
for babes. And many a youth goes to
college with a mental apparatus un
adapted to assimilate the virile food he
must t*".ke in there. Then he is spoiled
for practical purposes and all other
purposes, social included. Unfortu
nately, again, the world does not dis
criminate in this matter. And a man's
ability to turn a few glib compliments,
to dance a deux tomps gracefully and
to insinuate himself into the graces of
the chaperon, is considered all that is
essential to his social outfit; this, how
ever, is the proprlum of many callow
fledgings, outside of college circles.
"No, this is hardly Lhc type to at
tract the college-bred woman.
"On the other hand, if the college wo
man is herself c weakling mentally,
and sees with distorted vision nothing
but a desert of books over which she
must eagerly td that mirage on
the horizon, a career with a capital C,
she is apt to lose tight of the vital
things about her and become that crea
ture men most dread, the rampant
blue-stocking. Then it is scarcely a
question as to whether the college man
will attract this particular womanâ he
may, be he callow fledgling or notâ but
he will have none of her.

a financial success.
"The Public School Libraries of Califor
nia" was the subject of a most interesting
and instructive address read before the
Calaveras County Teachers' Institute by
James Keith, principal of the San An
dreas School. In it the author gives a
short history of our school libraries, de
scribing their advantages and also point
ut their defects, and the lines along
they. might be improved.
John Sw< it was the author of the provi
(n our school law by which 10 per
of the State school fund, since
changed to county fund, provided it did
sceed $50, was set aside for school
library purposes. Mr. Keith says with
truth: "No nobler thought ever emanated 1
from man's brain. You may preach ethics
till you die, but more children have been
taught to master themselves, more char
acter has been built into the pupil by this
<>ne provision of the school law than by
all the ethical lectures in Christendom. At
the present day there are nearly 800,000
volumes in the public schools of Califor
nia, over 9000 of. which are in Calaveras
County, and we have not near enough."
Teachers are warned apainst the misuse
of the library fund to purchase text books
for pupils. This should only be done in
tire e&se of children whose parents or
guardians are absolutely too poor to pur
chase the necessary books. Improvement
in our libraries may be outlined as fol
lows:
â¢'The supply .of working materialsâ by
working materials is meant those books
i : reference ami supplemental work which
are absolutely necessary for the teacher,
pupil and every-day work- of the school
room. These in order should be: Firstâ
A trood dictionary. Secondâ Such supple
:a.ry works as 'are. absolutely neces
tor the proper progress of the pupils.
â  Thirdâ A few works for teachers' use to
â  t and promote the work before the
pupils. Fourthâ An encyclopedia, not one
of the very expensive kind, but one that
is reliable and serviceable. FifthâAddi
tional supplemental work to keep^pace
with tin- progress "f the pupils. Sixthâ
A few standard v>"ks of literature, more
for the use of the teacher 'in connection
with pupils' work than for the direct use
the tatter. Avoid the purchase of
biographical dictionaries and geographi
. ttes until a circulating library is
ired. All required in that line will be
! in dictionary and encyclopedia. The
udicious use of the library will
maki Itself ff-lt on pupil and school.
Parrot answers to questions will cease.
Individuality will assert itself in each
pupil. A breadth of thought and
reasoning oftentimes surprising will
manifest- itself .in the oral and
written work of the. school. Children
have a much greater capacity for the
tract than we give them credit for.
Suit your language and teaching to their
conditions, and they will grasp the deep
thoughts of Shakespeare."
PLAYING FOR KEEPS.
Since Principal George Edgar of Niles
stirred up such a tempest in a teapot by
forbidding his boys playing marbles for
"keeps" the subject has been taken up
and discussed at length by the surround

THE WORKMEN.
The first anniversary ball given by Pros
perity Lodge in California Hall last
Tuesday evening was one of the rriost en
joyable affairs of the kind that has ever
been given by any lodge of the order.
ThereÂ° was a large attendance, of the
members of the lodge and of friends.
There were many handsome ladies and
gallant men who greatly enjoyed the ex
cellent programme of dances.
Next Thursday evening .Valley Lodge
ing community. BomÂ© of the outside
school authorities do not agree with Mr.
Edgar, but many others do, for to them
it Is not merely a question of playing
"keeps," but they believe that the more
serious aspect of fostering the spirit of
getting something for nothing should be
considered.
J. P. Garlick, County Superintendent of
Alameda County, In writing to Principal
Edgar, expresses his views on the subject
very forcibly: "Your views and mine on
the subject of playing marbles for 'keeps'
are in perfect accord. I never permitted
this game in any school I have ever
taught. I think you are perfectly right
to disapprove it, and it Is within your
authority to forbid it In your school."
Not less earnest a stand is taken by A.
H. Randall, principal of the San Jose
Normal School:
'â¢My opinion 13 that such practice
should not be permitted on the school
grounds. First, because the boy who
wins the marbles gets something for
which he renders no equivalent; second,
because it undoubtedly cultivates a desire
to indulge in games of chance for the
purpose of gain.
"This is a troublesome question, as it is
so common in California, and so many
persons who have not considered its ten
dency look upon it as being harmless.
Children should play such games for the
satisfaction that comes from the ac
quirement of skill and the pleasure of
winning without other stimulus."
The vice-principal of the same school,
R. S. Holway, writes: "Getting some
thing from another for nothing always
has a bad effect upon character. Playing
marbles for 'keeps' seems to me to be
morally equivalent to gambling in stocks
and buying lottery ticketsâ things that
are utterly condemned by all clear think
ers. I recognize of course that upright,
manly boys are frequently fond or play
ing marbles for 'keeps' simply because
they and the community in which they
live have not seen the problem clearly.'^
IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY.
Of all the many fine schools In Santa
Clara County the Lincoln is one of the
most progressive. Principal D. T. Bate
man, with his twelve earnest and ener
getic co-workers, look to it that no point
of Improvement in methods or teaching
or school discipline escapes their notice,
and the standard of the school attests
their careful management. This is the
first school in San Jose to introduce sew
ing, and at least a beginning in manual
training. So successful has the experi
ment proved that it is hoped in the
future that the Board of Education will
give these branches of necessary training
a definite place in the course of study
throughout all the schools.
It was during the present year that sew
ing was inaugurated in the fourth to the
ninth grades, each class being in charge
of the regular grade teacher. For the
boys' elementary carpenter work has been
provided, though this must at preseni
be carried on disadvantageusly in the
class room, the pupils bringing their own
tools. In time, no doubt, the large base
ment will be fitted up for this purpose.
Principal Bateman acts as instructor in
wood-working, and already the hoys
under his direction have made for them
selves rulers, tri and T-squares, brackets,
shelves, and done odd work about the
school.
The latest innovation in the Lincoln
School has been the formation among the
teachers of an Educational Club, which
was really an outgrowth of some psycho
logical investigations carried on by them.
The prineipai aim of tho now club is to
interest the children, who number 425. in
nature study. Gardening was the first
subject taken up, and already the large
grounds of the schools have been por
tioned off into various plats for all the

THE NATIVE SONS.
The entertainment that was recently
given in Stockton by Stockton Parlor was
a most enjoyable one. There was a fine
programme of song music, vocal and in
strumental, an address by Past President
W. B. Nutter of the parlor and stereoptl
con views by S. C. Partridge, with de
scriptive lecture by R. P. Doolan of Hes
perian Parlor of this city. The hall was
crowded to its very doors, and the affair
was one that will long be remembered
with pleasure by all who were present.
After the lecture Mr. Doolan was the
guest of honor at a banquet tendered him
at the Hotel Imperial, where Mr. Nutter
presided, and a splendid time was had
The floral decorations were golden pop
pies and buttercups, emblematic of the
Golden State, and the table lights were
shaded with orange.
Alcalde Parlor will give a social on the
evening of the 30th inst. in Native Sons-
Hall. The committee having charge of
the affair promises a fine evening's en
tertainment.
The Golden Gate Drill Corps of the
Golden Gate Parlor will give its annual
excursion to San Jose to-day, leaving at
9:15 from the depot, and ten minutes later
from the corner of Twenty-fifth and Va
lencia streets.
At the special session of California
Camp No. 4 of the Degree, of the Argo
nauts, held last Wednesday evening in
Native Sons' Hall, fifteen candidates were
initiated into the mysteries of this beau
tiful degree in the presence of a large
number of members of the camp.
Marshall Parlor was instituted in this
city last Friday night by Grand Presi
dent Clark, assisted by other grand offi
cers. The initiatory work was performed
by the officers of Pacific Parlor. The new
parlor has eighty-eight names on its
roll.
Charles F. Bryan has been elected a
delegate from Siskiyou Parlor to the
Grand Parlor. Thomas Monahan and
John S. Williams from San Jose Parlor
John Anderson from Arrowhead Parlor"
J. A. Van Harlinger and R. I. B. Bromley
from Tuolumne Parlor, J. S. Nallv from
Liberty Parlor and T. D. Edelman and E
H. Roth from Corona Parlor.
Dr. J. J. Phister of Solano Parlor has
been elected a delegate to the Grand Par
lÂ°r. vice F. W. Hutchinson, resigned, and
Charles Huffschmidt has been elected a
delegate from National Parlor, vice W S
Gratton, resigned.
R. D. Barton, the genial and well known
leader of the Sequoia band of Native
Sons, an energetic worker for the order
will be a candidate for the office of grand
inside sentinel at the session of the Grand
Parlor. If merit is recognized Barton will
surely be elected.
LA ESTRELLA'S MASQUERADE.
"The star shinea for all and it shines
brilliantly," was the remark of one of the
members of La Estrella Parlor Saturday
i night, April 16. when the parlor gave its
j private masquerade party. And it cer-
I tainly did shine, for it was one of the
i most pleasant functions that this parlor
has given. There was a large attendance,
and the onlookers from the gallery had
an opportunity of seeing a great many
costumes, as varied as there were wear

different classes and planted with lettuce,
radishes, peas and other vegetables. The
pupils take great interest and pride in
their gardens, and their daily observa
tions as to the growth of the products are
all carefully recorded.
Indoors each class rootn contains its
aquarium, in which may be seen toads'
and frogs' eggs, snails, slugs, sala
manders, minnows and polywogs in all
stages of development. Wheat and beans
and other growing plants are also care
fully studied close at hand.
The plan of study of these forms of
plant and animal life is practically the
same as those outlined in the book on
nature study by Dr. Jenkins of Stanford,
and In "Our Shy Neighbors." by Mrs. M.
A. B. Kelly, both being of great aid to the
teachers. After the latter give their talks
on the specimens studied, the children
are encouraged to tell what they know
about the subjects by actual observation
and experience, which they do by draw
ing, and both orally and by composition,
the latter proving line language work.
The club has so far been very success
ful and its work of great profit both to
ers. Some of the characters were orig
inal, others were rich and many were
unique. The affair was under the direc
tion of Mrs. E. AiEreltinger, Mrs. Gale,
Mrs. Carlie, Miss Reichmiller, Mrs. Cal
lett. Miss Minnie Klovershal. Miss Tillie
Rothman, Mrs. Granger and Mips Hanley.
The floor manager was Charles Hansen.
During the grand march the following
named acted as judges: Mrs. Minnie
Kalloch of Sans Souci Parlor, Miss Minnie
Van Btaden of Golden Gate Parlor. Miss
Burke of Las Lomas Parlor, Miss Hinck
of Oro Fino Parlor, Miss Maurey of
| Buena Vista. Parlor and Dr. Campbell of
I Fremont Parlor. Theso judges awarded
! the first, prize to Mrs. Sieward for the most
j beautiful costume, the second to Mrs.
. Julia Neubartn for the most original, ''the
; Klondike nugget," and the third, for the
best - sustained character, the "Organ

; gentlemen, the first prize, for handsomest
| costume, went to William Kells, who rep-
I resented the "Sultan.". The second was
for the most original. That wont to J. J.
! Sullivan, who represented the "Klondike

j presented by "An Admiror of the Native
I Daughters, particularly La Estrella Par
| lor," went to Mrs. Gale, who represented
j the "Black Patti," and to her escort. One
i of the attractive costumes was the "Bear
I Flag," represented by Mrs. Dr. Bolder
: man, and another was a cowboy in a
; genuine costume borrowed from a Texas
I cowboy, worn by R. D. Barton, but the
\ judges evidently did not catch sight of
j these, consequently no prizes.
BT'ENA VISTA'S PARTY.
The Farmers' dance given last Monday
nlpht in Native Sons' Hall by the mem
bers of Buena Vista Parlor was one of
the successes of this enterprising parlor
of the Native Daughters. There was a
good attendance, and the rule that none
should appear on the floor unless attired
in dresses made of wash goods, so far
as it applied to the ladies, was well car
ried out. The decoration were novel, be
i ing an artistic arrangement of vegetables
which at first had the appearance of flow
ers arranged in garlands, but a closer
Inspection disclosed what made up the
display. On the stage there was a fine
display of dead beets, not beats but beets,
and the ladies of the parlor took advant
age of the similarity of sound to play
a joke on the visitors. Miss Annie
Worth of the reception committee took
great delight in calling the attention of
I guests to what "the parlor does with dead
beets." Those who went toward the
stage were confronted with a placard
which read: "We place dead beets on
exhibition so that all may see them."
The grand march was led. not as is the
usual form by a lady and gentleman, but
by the floor director. Miss Rhea, Murray,
and Miss Emma Bening, her assistant,
who were followed in pairs by the floor
committee, consisting of Mrs. Ella Wehe,
Mis* Pauline Eberhardt. Mrs. Lucia Neu
! l.arth, MIBB Bertha Belau, Miss Mollie
Long and Miss Mamie. Wells. There was
an excellent programme of dances, and
there never was a merrier party in the
hall than there was on that Monday
night.
LITTLE TRYPHINA'S PARTY.
Last Thursday night there was a good
attendance at Shasta Hall in the Native
Sons' building on the occasion of the first
party given by Little Tryphina Pritchard,
San Francisco's phenomenal elocutionist.
This little one, who about a year ago
first made her appearance at fraternal
open meetings in fancy dances and recita
tions, attracted considerable attention and
it was not long before it became appar
ent that she was a natural elocutionist,
whose delivery is as perfect as that of
individuals who have devoted years to
the study of this branch, and her man
ners and gestures, as well as expression
of face, are aiways in perfect harmony
with the lines she speaks. She is yet too
young to fully appreciate her own worth,
but under the tutelage of Miss M- r>rev
fus, who has taken an unusual interest
in her, she is being perfected for the
stage. If she continues to advance as she
has in the past year, not many years will
pass before Tryphina Pritchard will ap
pear in the line of stars of the American
stage. "Bhe programme of the evening in
cluded a fancy dance and recitations by
Miss Pritchard, instrumental music by
Mr. and Mrs. Krone and Miss Phoebe Gib
son, accompanied by Miss Belle Shoul;
vocal selections by Mrs. E. Burns, Miss
M. Dreyfus and B. L. Tarbox; fancy
dances by Freda Rhen. Lillian Dolliver
and Little Gladys Weller and recitations
by Miss Dottle Baxter and Miss Katie
Krone. The party closed with a dance.
THE NATIONAL UNION.
Berkeley Council gave a ladles' night in
American Hall, Berkeley, last Monday
night, at which there was a very good
attendance. There was an address by
President B. W. Hayne of the council,
musical selection by the Berkeley High
School orchestra, recitation by Joseph
Semeria, vocal solos by Mrs. Dr. F. ,R.
Woolsey, Mr. Davis and F. R. Fowden,

teresting meeting last Tuesday night. j
Aftpr the routine business had been |
transacted and T. S. Malloy had been
elected a delegate to the cabinet, vice W.
R. Preishach, resigned, there were vocal
selections by the quartet, a very flue
tenor solo by J. St-meria, barytone solo

; H. A. Graves, and a spirited debate on
I war by C. J. King and J. Taylor ;
; Rogers on "Should the I'nited Slates En- j
In War With Spain?" The addresses
.irniip.-d a great deal of enthusiasm, and
the speeches were eloquent and patriotic
utterances.
Each council has received its allotted
number of tickets to the entertainment to
be eivon in Odd Fellows' Hall on the
evening of the 19th of May. in celebration
of the anniversary of the founding of the
order. A very fine programme has been
arranged for the occasion.
Notices have been sertt out to the ef
fect that there will be no beneficiary as
sessment for April. From indications it
looks as if there would not bo any call for
an assessment in the month of November.
It if believed that there will not be any
that month, unless some unlooked for j
cause should present itself.
COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST, F.
O. A.
Upon the visit to Chico, Butte County,
on the 13th inst., of Mrs. Emma Harring
ton, grand chief companion of the Com
panions of the Forest, F. O. A., she,
in company with Grand Secretary Miss
Bremer, instituted Pride of Butte Circle
No. 330. The grand officers were assisted
by fourteen members of Orange Blossom
Circle of Oroville, who performed the
work of institution and initiation in a
most satisfactory manner. The kindness
of these members was publicly acknowl
edged by the grand chief companion. The
new circle has selected first-class officers,
who will do much to make the organiza
tion a popular one. The institution was
followed by a banquet.
The folio-wing night the grand officers
visited Orange Blossom Circle and were
received in a manner that was most grat
i ifying. The officers were well up in the
work, as they demonstrated at the exem
plification in the hall, which had for the
occasion been turned into a fairy bower,
c.c chief decoration being orange blos
soms. During the evening Past Chief
Companion Miss Marks presented the
grand chief companion with a handsome
bunch of the north's most beautiful flow
ers.
On Friday an official visit was paid to
Yuba Circle in Marysville. and there the
reception was one of the most cordial
that the grand chief companion has re
ceived during her recent tour. The offi
cers were especially commended for the
perfect manner in which they exempli
fied the work.
Last Tuesday the grand chief compan
ion and other grand officers visited Pre
sidio Circle in this city, and the recep
tion they received was a flattering one.
There was an admirable exemplification
of the floor and memorized work, and this
was praised by the chief officer. Grand
Sub-Chief Coburn, Grand Trustee Mrs.
Jacobs and others. The grand officers
and other were treated to a collation.
Last Wednesday the circle *at Wood
land was officially visited.
THE CHOSEN FRIENDS.
The hall of Social Council was filled by
a large audience last Thursday night on
the occasion of the consolidation of the
membership of California Council with it.
Twenty-eight members of California
Council were added to Social Council, in
the presence of at least 100 members of
the order. The ceremony was performed
by Grand Recorder Wallis, assisted by
Deputy Gibson. This was witnessed by a
number of grand, officers, and at its close
those who remained were invited to the
banquet-hall, where they were made to
feel at home at the collation that had
been prepared for them. A. G. Baker, the
recording secretary of Social Council, was
the master of ceremonies.
Last Wednesday night ten councils of
the order were represented at the visit
of Progressive Council to Washington
Council. The grand officers were repre
sented by Grand Councilor Boehm, Grand
Recorder S. C. Wallis and Grand Prelate
Mrs. Sweeney. There was a good at
tendance of members, and after the busi
ness of the evening was over there was a
programme that included an address by
the grand councilor, one by the grand re
corder, recitations by Miss Irene Johnston,
Charles Stone, W. B. Dunlap and a short
talk by E. A. Street. At the conclusion
of this talk Mr. Street, on behalf of Con

READING OF TEACHERS.
There are none greater or more exten
sive readers than the people of the United
States. This is apparent from the vast
number of publishing houses, each of
which Issues thousands of volumes an
nually; from the hosts of magazines,
pamphlets and newspapers published In
ers of America, composed of youths be
tween the ages of 12 and 21, is one of
the oldest organizations of its kind in
the United States, and the fact that it
is qow in the twentieth year of its ex
istence is proof that there is an excep
tion to the saying that, "boys' organiza
tions cannot last more than a year." The
court charges 20 cents a month dues, and
furnishes doctor and medicine. The boys
transact all their own business, elect
their own officers and are close students
of parliamentary law and become versed I
in the art of addressing public meetings.
This court, which already has a good
membership, has reopened its charter arid
will keep it open until next July to give
all youths an opportunity to join, and for
that purpose the initiation fee has been
Axed at if) cents. Recording Secretary
L. Michaels will furnish application
blanks at the hall of the court in the
Alcazar building.
On the evening of the 10th of May the
court will give an invitation concert in
the Sherman-Clay Hall. Professor Mar
tinez and Professor Yon Ocr will con
tribute to the evening's entertainment.

every part of the Union and from the ;
immense quantity of foreign books im- \
ported. Yet, withal, Americans as a class i
have been accused of being very shallow
In real, actual knowledge and very super- j
! ficial and singularly inaccurate in matters
pertaining to science and literature. If
1 the European critic is to be believed, the
average American reads a little of every- ,
I thing and never much of any one thing.
Amusement, we are told, not mental
profit; reputation for possessing an ex- â 
tensive and general information rather
than being thorough and accurate in a j
! limited field of knowledge are the pre- j
| vailing motives for both reading and j
study on this side of the Atlantic. Now, ;
! while the writer is far from concurring in
these sweeping statements of our friends
over the sea, yet he is obliged to admit
that there is a substratum of truth In
their criticism. It is unfortunately true j
that millions have no higher or more j
I noble motive for reading than mere I
! amusement, mental intoxication or the
' whiling away of leisure hours.
The number of persons who have a sys
tem about their reading and stick to that |
! system with a dogged pertinacity which ;
I means success, and who, in pursuance of !
i their plans, set apart from the hours de
voted to the daily cares and duties of life i
: a time to be sacredly reserved for literary
i and scientific reading, is lamentably ;
small. Spasmodic work in any depart- ;
â  ment of labor, however energetic or ex- i
hausting its performance at the time,
i never has and never can accomplish
! much.
This is as true of reading as of any
other labor. The man, then, who would
make reading of the greatest profit to
himself must set apart a regular time for i
the pursuit; not allow other pursuits to
rob him of that time; must study to un
derstand the author's words and thence
his thoughts; must use all help that will
aid him to do this; and should read slow
ly, carefully and meditatively. He would
do well to write down remarks, criticisms,
thoughts on the author's views, and
should in every possible way become im
bued with the very spirit of the writer.
Will not the result obtained, in accuracy
of thought, in definiteness of view, in cer
tainty of knowledge, far more than com
pensate for all the tiro-e and troubi*-
which such a course or reading must
necessarily cost?
Now in no profession should more time
be devoted to careful and thorough read
ing than in that of teaching. To perform
with ordinary success and with ordinary
! satisfaction, the work of each day as it
j comes, requires much study and painstak
ing preparation, but any teacher who in
doing this confines himself to the text
books will soon find himself far behind
the demands of the age.
The true teacher will read the news
paper as he should, with scrupulous at
tention and care and for the purpose of
learning and remembering. A sad ten
dency to skim is often developed by the
i habit of reading a little here and there
through a half dozen or more newspapers
and magazines, a habit contracted on thf
score that the teacher has not time for J
more accurate work. Now this habit i
I often unfortunately sticks to one when
, called upon to give serious attention to
I reading of a more solid nature.
While the teacher ought to be thor- !
; oughly acquainted with all the vital is
sues of the day and should know what !
progress science, literature and art are !
| from time to time making, he cannot :
! afford to waste valuable hours in profit- I
I less reading, or to contract the pernicious ]
] habit of skimming. Let him therefore j
I choose the very best newspapers and I
: magazines and only read from these the
best articles, and let the reading of thppe
be careful and thorough; as it is not the
amount of food eaten that, nourishes the
; body and causes it to grow, but the
amount digested and assimilated, so it is
i certainly not the amount read but the
I amount understood, and then remem
bered, stored away in the recesses of the
! brain, to be called forth at a moment's
; warning when wanted, that will give us
: mental power. As food of poor quality
! or in Improper quantity will often check
{ or even prevent assimilation, so does in
CAN WOMEN PLAY WHIST?
j We received a communication a few weeks j
i ago asking us to express our opinion on this |
subject. If the question refers to the women |
of California I will say the question might as ;
well be asked, "Can men play whist?"
I can select twenty-five ladies from the Trist
Duplicate and San Francisco Whist Clubs of i
this city and play to a standstill the same ]
number of men, and select them from any
whist clubs in the city or State. In other !
words, they would win just as many matches j
from the men as the men could from the i
women.
The quality of whist that the ladies will
play will stand just as close criticism as the
play of the men. To answer our lady corres
pondent in a few words we will say: "Yes.
the women can play whist just as gr>o.l as the
menâ if not a little betterâ in San Francisco."
The reason is they are not ashamed to study.
WHAT MR. WORK THINKS OF THE
WOMEN IN THE GAME.
While Mr. Work was our guest a few weeks
ago we had several interviews with him on
subjects pertaining to whist. We were anxious
to know his opinion in regard to the whist play
of our San Francisco ladies and asked:
Q. Mr. Work, can women play whist?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. You have had a very wide experience in
whistâ will you in a very concise way give
me a little opinion of their ability as players
compared with men?
A. While I believe there is no question that
the best masculine exponents of the game in
the country have reached a slightly higher
grade of play aqÂ»d a somewhat better perfec
tion of team work than the very best women,
yet on the other hand I am satisfied that if it
were possible to take the average play of
women whisters of the country and the aver
age play of the men (of course in this I am
referring more particularly to the club players
of both sexes) the women would show a rather
higher grade than the men. I believe that
the reason for this state of affairs is that the
women, as a rule, have more time for prac
tice, and are more willing and anxious to
learn. They are almost without exception
ready to take lessons to study and improve
their game. On the other hand, a large per
centage of the men are firmly impressed with
the conviction that they know it all, and con
sequently fail to improve or keep up with
the march of whist progress. Wmle it is as I
above stated undoubtedly true that some few
men are better whist players than any women.
I believe that it is because they started the
game longer ago, and have had "more system
atic practice and more opportunities of meeting
strong adversaries. I can see no possible rea
son in the future If the women persevere with
whist along the proper lines, as they are doing
at present, and If they progress somewhat in
the matter of obtaining matches with strong
adversaries, that they should not rank equal
xvith the men in years to come.
Q. What do you think of the play of our
lady whisters compared with the ladles of the
East '!
A. I am satisfied that it ia not only very
much stronger than the Eastern average, but
I am inclined to believe that the ladies of San
Francisco can defeat those of any Eastern
city.
ORIGINAL LEAD FROM KING, QUEEN AND
TWO OR MORE SMALL.
During the few years of whist experience we
have had there Is no one lead that has eiven
so many causes for complaint as the original
opening of the king f.-om king, queen and two
small.
I don't suppose there is a whist authority in
existence in book form but what tells you to
lead the king. The purpose of this writing is
to call attention to those that follow our whist
articles and ask them to reverse the order.
When you feel obliged to open from this suit
lead the smallest and note the result.
About a year ago we gave in the columns of
The Call a very complete analysis of this play
from that great writer and master of the game,
General A. W. Drayson. Tho conclusion that
he arrived at was that the king lead from
thts holding was a nasty one. but it had a
very slight percentage in its favor.
In duplicate whist, which is not played in
England, where every deal is played to a fin
ish. I think in the long run it will be trick
winning to lead low. I am still further In
clined to think, with trump strength to back
the play, it would be better to open low origin
ally from king, queen and three small than to
start with the queen. It is more than an
even chance in both cases that your partner
can do one of two things, 1. c., to win the first
trick or force out the ace. The only object of
leading the king from four or queen frum five
Is to win the first round if possible, or force
out the ace. leaving you with the master card
We have reason to believe^ the reverse wW I do
it just as well. We would like to know what
experience others have had with these two
le A d ss S lon B aeo as 1892. In the columns of the
Chronicle, we advocated the W<l <>t the fourth
best from ace and four small in any plain
wilt At the time it was pooh-poohed, but
now it A !s % recognize,! conventional lead
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The only
object we have in suggesting these changes
Is because we believe them greater trick
winners, and the chance for sain la so mucb
greater than the chance for loss.
judicious or overmuch reading often
weaken the mind and retard its growth.
There is nothing worth doing that is
not worth doing well. When the teacher
reads let him read with his soul, while
he cultivates that habit of close and
thorough attention, of careful study and
of accurate thinking, which will serve to
transfer the great thoughts of great
authors from the written or printed page
to the living tablets of the mind.^^

HOW VOTES ARE LOST.
Many foolish and some amusing mis
takes in voting appear as soon as the
ballots are unfolded. In spite of the
repeated warning that any mark on
the ballot other than the cross in it 3
proper circle or square will invalidate
the ballot and cause the voter to lose
his vote, many such defective ballots
are found every year. It frequently
happens that a particular candidate' 3
name. appears in several different col
umns, due to a nomination or indorse
ment by various organizations. Some
voters, overanxious for their candi
date's success, think they must mark
a cross before his name wherever it ap
pears. Of course the ballot is rejected.
A ballot was recently found with the
following inscription plainly written
across the top: "I want to vote the en
tire Tammany ticket." It is unneces
sary to say that Tammany lost a vote.

INSTRUCTIONS TO WHIST UMPIRES
At the Buffalo meeting of the executive com

ally known as the midwinter meeting, a com
mittee was appointed to draft a set of in
structions to whist umpires.
We hoi>e that one clause will be that an
umpire or referee of a contest should never
take part in the play. We can speak from ex-
I nerienre when we write these lines. We be-
I lieve it to be the duty of the one in charge
of a match to preserve strict decorum, allow
ing no postmortemlng of deals immediately
after they are played (a table in a room ad-
Joining should he provided for that purpose).
I think the time is near at hand when we
should have a "time bell," the same as In
! chess, to limit certain players who always de-
I lay the game.
it la a general complaint at all congresses
' that many players have the very bad habit
1 of hesitating in playing their cards, and many
! times beyond the limit of endurance, when
1 there is no more neccessity for it than there
1 is in hesitating over an original lead. This
is a step in the right direction.

NATIVE OPERA HOUSES,
AND MELBA EAST AND WEST.
Well, we have had our little Melba
seasonâ or. rather, we will have had by
the time those lines are in type â paid
our little $7 without a murmur, packed
the house at every performance, ex
humed and refurnished the traditions
of our munificence, had a grand, gla<l
lime of it generally and made a royal
record for our artistic and pecuniary
appreciation, which sooner or later
will reach Xew York and give the !
poignant ha-ha to those metropolitan
managers who have indulged ribald
Jest at the expense of our cheapness.
In appreciation and In coin we have
done as well by Melba as could have
been done anywhere. On three per- ]
formances given in a theater that can- j
not comfortably entertain more than j
ISOO persons at a sitting we have ex- !
pended a sum close on to $25,000. And
never was bread cast upon the waters
to surer profit than when we rose to
the challenge of those $7 seats. San
Francisco should henceforth spell prod- i
igality instead of 10, 20 and 30 cents for
the manager who knows the economics
of his trade. One of the Melba man
agement said to me the other night,
"Why, this is not a touring station, it
la a metropolis! Put up your opera- j
house, some place that will hold the I
crowd, and we will come every year
with the operas, Wagiier, everything, |
and with all the singers of the world." ;
The same night, Thursday, I met three j
men in the California, a millionaire, a
broker and a manager, each of whom
told me that he was going to build an
opera-house in San Francisco before
another season had come around. If
I can believe them all â and I don't
mind telling you that one of the will-
Ing builders is Samuel Friedlander â it
Is only a matter of months before we
will not be able to walk a block on the
Rialto without bumping up against an
opera-house. From the conversations
that have taken place In the California
lobby this last week you would think
that opera-houses were an even more
Imperative necessity than battle-ships.
If in addition to the three that were
promised me a half-dozen or bo of those
song palaces which lately have been
architected and adjectived in the news

be known not as a city of boarding
houses, but of opera-houses. It seems
c that a halt should be cried before
everybody in the town takes to build
ing them. We don't want a system ol
private opera-houses scattered from
North Beach to the Potrero. Just one
big substantial edifice on the right side
of Market street would be pretty good

For ;i year and more several New
Y"rk newspapers, especially the New
York Musical Courier, have be>~>n mak
ing' a crusade against the salaries paid
t>> foreign singers. They have said that
the American singer stands no show
and that America should be for the
Americans. Hut the New York public,
pampered and petted and will-
Ing to pay for the best and most fam
ous that is to be had, has gone un
disturbed along the tenor of its pleas
ures. Presumably it concluded that
art knows no national bounds, and that
in the matter of opera artists there is
nothing quite so good as the best,
which, with only several rare excep
tions, is not American. And Melba,
the Reszke brothers, ralve, Eames and
other high salary gobblers have contin
ued to winter in New York, even while
dynasties tottered on the managerial
throne of the Metropolitan Opera-house.
America never has been able to offer
the foreign artist anything better than
money. This is a cold fact. The
American success of a musical artist
is not worth a rap In the capitals of
Europe. Is this unjust? Well, I
should say so. There is no city in the
world with an opera record of the last
few years that will not look pale and
puny beside New York's. The Czar,
the Emperor, the Queen, have had to
wait for their favorite singers until |

of paying for it.

Speaking of the growl in the New
York press, this is part of an editorial
in last week's issue of the Musical
Courier:
'. The Melba Opera Company, now giving
what are satirically termed operas in the
distant West, is a mere makeshift in
tended as a frame for the central picture,
which, of course, is Melba. This great
singer is out in the "wild and woolly" for
i the purpose of educating the ignorant
American in the operatic art. It is not
so much a question <>f money ;us of educa
tion. Sooner or later the Westerners be
yond the Mississippi were bound to learn
! what "Lucia," "Bohemian Girl," "Mar
; tha." "Rigoletto" and other Italian operas
: rrally meant even if travestied, as they
' must be, whpu given with small tempo
1 rary orchestras, sin;i.ll ill-balanced chorus
I and surroundings that give the perform
l ances the air of a shoddy variety show.
AXelba does not mind all the sacrifices In
volved in appearances having such un
comfortable environments. The artistic
j protest is subdued under the overwhelm
i Ing desire, prompted by foreign love of
! America, to educate the dear people who
never heard of the old operas,
As lons as we are satisfied with these
j constant foreign invasions there is no rea
! son why we should not p;iy f<>r them. In
â  the language of Vanderbllt, "Damn the
I American musician."
Now, to every newspaper man whose
; work has to da with music, the Courier
!is indispensable. It has its goods and
i bads. It has. like the dramatic week
! lies, its elaborate system of out-of-town
! correspondents, who, receiving no pay j
for what they write other than the I
: dead-head tickets furnished them by
managers, are loudly and persistently
faithful to the managers; and it has its
Raconteur Huneker, one of the best
of American critics and essayists in
musical and dramatic matters, and an
incomparable authority on the players
and the literature of the pianoforte;
its Vance Thompson, a marvelous
blend of Oscar Wilde and himself and
of godlike egotism; its Philip Hale of

cyclopedia and critic and a sometimes
fortunate jester; and it has Its enter
taining grudge against the foreign

Musical Courier is not only good read
ing for its immediate clientele, but a
considerable power all. over musical
America. It stands practically alone
in character, specialty and circulation,
and furnishes not merely news to many
of the musical editors of the land, but
ideas; more or less diluted, it has a
voice in nearly every newspaper in
America, It started this crusade
against the foreign singers (whether in
jest or earnest) ; it has kept it up week
in and week out; and now, hooting, it
follows the last great invader of the
season along the line of her triumphs
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Even
if you take the Musical Courier serious
ly on this proposition you still have to
laugh at it. In the present i
vocal fortunes of America there
is a trustful spirit of anarchy
in the Courier's endeavor to drive
out the foreigners. And the be
lated liur.st of Now York provincialism
in its ironicaj illusions to tho woolly
West la funnier still. We all know,
and kmw before she came, that Mel
li.' l present little company is not a
first-class opera organization; that the ;
operas an- stale, even to us, that Melba :
was the one powerful attraction. In
fact, if you were to put a first-class
opera and a first-class company in the j
California Theater there would be nc
room left for an audience. All thai
we were promised was Melba, and we
would rather have had her in concerts
than not at all. As it was the or
chestra and the leader were good, Cam
parari was good, the several othor
principals of the company did fairly;
and Melba, in operas that mi.s?ht hay?
bei n made only for the glorification of
her voice, was everything and all that
we expected her to be. In fact, we

The following tribute to Ibsen's art
and some of the best known characters
in his plays is an extract from a long
poem written by William Archer, the
London dramatic critic and translator
of many of Ibsen's pieces, In celebra
tion of the master's seventieth birth
day:

! Companion realms, do reverence to you;
As earn creation follows on the last

Its purple glamor over life's gray prose;
To swift clairvoyance it unseals our eyes,

play and a new theater. So long Iden
tified with the Tivol! and its particular
line of light opera and lighter extrava
ganza, Mr. Hartman's appearance
In farce, more or less legiti
mate, Is attended with excited flutter-
Ings by many persons who are enthusi
astic admirers of his, and with milder
Interest by persons who take account
of what goes on at the San Francisco
theaters, and Mr. Hartman may count
on many glad hands to welcome him
to-morrow night at the Baldwin. His
play is by an English author, John T.
Day, and new to the American stage,
having first been presented at the The
ater Royal. Portsmouth, England, in
July of last year. It went on afterward
at the Strand Theater, London, where
it is said to have achieved success. Mr.
Hartman has secured the American
rights to the play and believes he has
in It a valuable property.
The scene models, by W. T. Hemsley,
were shipped from London to San
Francisco and are said to have been
faithfully copied by Frederick Schafer
and John Ledwidge. The action takes
place on the promenade deck of an
Australian linor. The scene shows the
cabin, d-^'k houses, chart house,
bridges, lifeboats and all the parapher
nalia of an ocean steamer, and it is
claimed that the set is one of the most
realistic ever shown upon the stage.
The first act represents the steamer in
the morning off the coast of Portugal.
In the second act it is night and the
vessel is in the Mediterranean, having
just passed BrlndisL She is lllumi- ;
nated in honor of the captain's birth
day and tlie usual concert is taking
place. In the last act the steamer is j
off Port Said and the complications of
the plot arc Anally cleared up when :
the pilot comes over the side with the j
mail.
The story of the play is not an in- :
tricate one, but it is said to be Inter
esting and to furnish many humorous
i situations. The purser, the character ;
â¢ in which Mr. Hartman will appear, has
just returned to England from Austra
lia. Immediately upon his arrival he
ia married, but before he has an op
portunity to enjoy his honeymoon or- ;
ders come from the steamship company \
i to instantly Join another vessel which
; is about to return to the Antipodes. ;
The purser is broken-hearted, because
; one of the strictest rules of the com
\ pany is that none of its officers shall
carry his wife on a voyage. The young |
couple discuss the situation and decide ,
: that the wife shall travel incognito and
1 that they shall act as strangers on the i
vessel. The purser has had a previous I
love affair with a charmer in Sydney, j
with a brute of a husband, from whom j
she is seeking a divorce. When the ;
play opens the steamer i 3 outward {
I bound and it transpires that not only j
is the purser's wife on board, but also |
the lady from Australia. The latter ;
claims him and he, not daring to admit I

Golumbia.
Marie Jansf>n will commence her sec
ond and last week at the Columbia
Theater to-morrow night with "The
Nancy Hanks," a farce-comedy new to
San Francisco, which is said to have
met with success in the East. Other
things said of it are that it offers Miss
Jansen some opportunity for the dis
play of song and clothes, and that it
is of that order of entertainment which
requires no mental effort on the part
of the audience. The story Is all about
the troubles of a young French Mar
quis who conies to this country and
sinks his fortune in a salted gold
nine. He is befriended by a young ac
tor, who has fallen in love with a so
ciety belle, and at the time the play
opens is about to be turned out of a
boarding house for non-payment of
board. Pearl Dodo, a vaudeville ac
tress, comes to their rescue and loans
them her apartments while she is on
the road. Established in the tint the
actor starts out to look for pupils and
the Frenchman, masquerading in some
of the actress' clothes, is surprised by
a rich aunt of the actor, who takes him
for her nephew's wife. Thinking to
help his friend out of a distasteful
marriage, which the aunt has come to
arrange, the Frenchman encourages
her in her mistake and claims to be the
wife. From this moment the plot
thickens, until every member of the
cast is laboring under a mistaken idea.
The setting of all these people right
makes the story, and It is said to be an
amusing one.

After two weeks of successful busi

Browri" will be withdrawn with Sun
day evening's performance, to be fol
lowed by "The Gay Parisians," a pop
ular farce from the French, which has
been seen in San Francisco before and
which can count successes in London,
Paris and New York. The story is
the usual French farce inspiration of
married indiscretion. The little sup
per, the threatened detection and the
miraculous escape are more en
tertainingly told than usual. L. R.
Stockwell and Howard Scott have been
called to re-enforce the Alcazar cast for
"The Gay Parisians" production.
Tiv>oli.
The second edition of "Sinbad. the
Sailor," will be given at the Tivoli
Opera House next week, with Carrie
Roma, Edith Hall, Helen Merrill, Geor
gie Cooper, Edwin Stevens, Thomas C.
Leary, John J. Raffael, Branson, Rob
ert Mitchell and Fred Kavanagh in ne\Â»
specialties, and the ballet in new fig
ures and marches. The patriotic finale
to the second act, which was introduced
with success last week, and includes
the singing of "The Star Spangled Ban
ner" and the flight of the American
Eagle amidst the waving of American
flags, will be repeated at all of next
week's performances of the extrava
ganza. "Sinbad" will be followed by a
revival of "Wang," with new scenery,
costumes and accessories, to be fol
lowed, in turn, by the first presenta
tion on any stage of a new musical
comedy entitled, "The Poster; a Dream
of Art."
Morosco's.
To-morrow night at Morosco's "Tha
Wieklow Postman," an Irish comedy
drama, will receive its first production
at popular prices, and Fred J. Butler's
name is featured in big letters for the
leading role. Lettie Le Vyne, a well
known soubrette, is engaged as the
star attraction to play the part of
Nora Donlin, the Irish heroine. Miss
Le Vyne made her American debut in
this city ten years ago, since which
time she has played with various com
panies in the East, in Europe. India
and Africa, as well as in the Australian
colonies. The comedy element and in
cidents of the play admit of the intro
duction of specialties, and Miss Le
Vyne will render several numbers. Ju
lia Blanc, Maurice Stewart, Fred But
ler and the Acme Quartet will also in
troduce specialties. Lawrence Under
wood has been specially engaged to
play the part of Major Anderson, one
of the villains of the plot. W. L. Glea
son is in the cast for the Scotch dialect
character of James Saunders, and a
number of other new faces will appear.
The principal pcenic features are a view
of the Wieklow Mountains, Ireland, and
the prison scene, as well as a new in
terior scene. Altogether the bill for
the coming week is expected to be an
attractive one.
Orpheum.
The Orpheum presents an entirely
new bill this week. The programme In
cludes Marion Kerner's Tableaux Vi
vants, which are said to be produced at
an expense of over $10,000. The pic
tures are on the classic order and pre
sented by some improved method orig
inal with Mr. Kerner. Special scenery
and electrical effects have been pro
vided. The remainder of the bill will
include Lizzie B. Raymond, who was a
favorite here about two years ago;
Reno and Richards, comedy acrobats,
who are said to do some difficult and
daring feats in their line; Fish and
Quigg, in a comedy act; Tony Wilson
and Clown; Roberta and Doreto; Smith
O'Brien, the monologue artist; Marian
di Castello, soprano, and Montgomery
and Stone, black face comedians.

mount of rainfall or of melted snow In Inches
and hundredths during the . a3t twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. â  The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington ~oast. When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
nnd south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" Is inclosed with iso v ars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is 'm
probable. With n "high' 1 in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In "summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 23.â T0-day the stock I
market was "discounting peace," in the lan- I
guage of brokers. This was done by lifting ;
prices a notch higher. The advance hesitated
at the opening, owing to a reactionary ten- j
dency In the London market, following the re- i
ceipt of the report that the Paris had been â¢
captured by the Spanish and the cruller To- '
peka sunk in a collision. Wall street was in- |
credulous as to the capture of the Paris up to I
the closins of the exchange at noon, and
the truth of the foundering of the Topeka not
having been established, the market was re
lieved from that cause of depression. I On the
other hand, much was made of the capture of
another Spanish prize by the cruiser New
York. There was reported active demands lor
securities In London, but the buying here for
London account was not large, as prices here
ruled above the London parity. There were
periods of reaction, but the publication of the
bank statement caused renewed : buying and
lifted prices to the highest. They were shaded
off by renewed apprehension as to the safety of
the Paris, th* closing being easy, but net
Ins throughout the list reaching a point in
f pome cases. The volume of the dealing was not
large, the Industrial specialties being favorites
In the trading, especially Sugar and Tobacco.
The spirit* stocks were also quite prominent.
The general feeling In financial circles is that
the war Is not likely to be protracted and only
some unexpected accident or disaster could
affect the conviction that Spain must speedily
succumb to superior resources. A feature of
the day was the . hardening in exchange de
mand, sterling bills rising to J4 Si. This rate.
It Is expected, precludes further gold imports
under present conditions.
The stock market has felt the reflected effect
of the panic In Spanish 4s In European
Bourse*, and the resulting forced liquidation
of American securities, yet the week closes
with a greater part of the extreme losses re
covered, net declines not exceeding two points
In any of the prominent leading stock* It is
noteworthy also that the low prices of the week
were not as low except in a few cases as those
on March 25, which marked the lowest point
of the decline after the blowing up of the
Maine. The exceptions were International
stocks which were favorites with operators on
foreign Bourses. The grounds for the confi
dence and Improvement in the stock market
will be felt in money conditions. At New York
banks have replenished their reserves with im
ported ffo',ii to meet the drain from the inter
ior, and the cessation of the drain promises
easier money conditions.
Call loans on the Stock Exchange have, In
fact, fallen to 1% per cent during the week.
Financial institutions in the United States have
ceased to draw on their credits abroad because
.they Ceil amply secured against the money
'needs <>( the war.
They feel prepared to meet * demand for a
Government loan, which it Is seen would be
(speedily expended again. . .icy also feel pre
pared to meet the spring needs of money for
the business of the country, which are expected
to be earlier and more urgent than usual.
The prices of bonds during the week did not
move so widely as stocks, either in the early
downward movement or In the later recovery.
Transactions were small for the week. Net
declines in Government bonds for the week in
the bid price are 2Vi in the new 4s registered,
I*4 in the new 4s coupon, 1% for the old 4s,
Â»L.Â» L . for the os coupon and % for the 5s regis
tered.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 23.â The Evening Post's
I^ondon financial cablegram says: There was
a general recovery in the stock market here
to-day, led by Spanish 4s and Americans, on
further bear closing here and from New York.
The Paris Bourse was also much better, ex
cept in Brazils and Portuguese, which were
sold heavily. Brazil exchange Is h\. Ameri
cans closed under the highest on the reported
capture of the Paris, which Is not believed at
Lloyds. New York is said to have stopped
Inning gold for the moment, >mt it is not be
lleved that the American demand Is wholly
over yet.
Money Is plentiful here because brokers ab
stain from investing freely in bills. Discount
is steady, d^iilf" the easy tendency in money,
because, even ai*rt from politics, It Is felt
that an enormous payment -wf Japan on In
demnity due on May 8 may impoverish the
market.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, April 23 âThe Financier says:
According to the statement of the New York
clearing house banks, for the week ending
April 23, the Institutions hold a surplus reserve
of '.25, 100, which is larger than has been
reported since the fourth week of July, 1897.
This result has been brought about by the
conservative action of the banks in preparing
for the crisis which is now at hand. Their
cash holdings, depleted by demand from the
interior, have been replenished by imports of
gold and by the continued contraction of out
standing obligations. To-day they are in an
exceedingly strong position and are ready to
meet any demands which may be made upon
th.-m The statement in detail does not differ
from those of the last several weeks. The
decrease of $7,439,100 in loans represents the
turning of accumulated sterling into specie
accounts.
But little new business is being done as the
rates demanded preclude any borrowing other
than that which is absolutely necessary.
The increases In gold were larger than the
week's receipts from abroad and it is quite
likely that the heavy expansion reflects some
of the previous imports. Deposits fell off only
$3,012,100, which just about equals the legal
tender decrease and Is less than the known
loss to the interior. The statement, Judged by
usual calculations, does not balance, but the
changes are logical since the gold Imports and
their relations to accumulated sterling carried
as loans must be taken Into account. Sum
marized, the only conclusion Is that the
banks have perfected a difficult operation with
rare skill. They have retrenched where neces
sary, supplied their correspondents with funds
while strengthening their own holdings, they
have put their business in first-class condition,
and to-day when a call for funds by the Gov
ernment Is imminent they have more money
available for the purpose than at any time
during the last nine months.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 23.â Declines In wheat fu

SIR ROLLAN
AND THE
PRINCESS.
BY JULIET CHANDLER
IN the year 1399 lived King Armond i
and his Queen, Evelyne, their lit-
Q, Rolan. and their daughter,
Carleen, In a beautiful palace In a
deep forest. Rollan was 10 y.
"iÂ«l and Carleen was eight. The chil
dren wore never allowed to gi> outside
the palace gardens on account of. a
w Icked witch. â¢ -.-â â¢.
Her dwelling place could never be
found. In tjie mountains, not very far
away from the forest, lived an old giant
and hLs wife, who paid the old witch
a big sum of money for children, whom
they ate.
One day Rollan and Carleen were out
in â  the garden with their nurse, who
was very old. A butterfly, which was
really the witch in disguise, flew before
them.
The butterfly Just kept out of reach.
Princess ""arleen was very anxious to
capture it, and ran out of the sate be
fore Prime Rollan could stop her. He
ran out to bring her back; but Princess
Carleen ran away very fast and dis
appeared in the woods. At last Rollan
caught up with her. But what was the
sight that met his eyes. On the ground
lay his poor little sister, unconscious,
and tied hand and foot. Her mouth
was bound up in a handkerchief.
Standing over her was an old woman
with green eyes, which flashed like I
phosphorus. She had only two teeth,
which came away down on her chin.
Her nose was hooked like an eaj
Ivak. Her hands wore bony and looked.
like claws. She was dressed wholly in
When she saw Rollan she sprang at
him like a cat. Before he had time to
scream she had gagged him and
bound him hand and foot, and then she
drew from her pocket a little bottle
which sh<? put to Rollan's nose.
Rollan began to feel very drowsy and
could not hold his eyes open. The
next thing Carleen and Rollan knew
they were being dragged through the
wood. They felt very much bruised
and sore. The witch had each of them
by the arm. Her hands seemed to
burn like fire. They were so weak they
could not struggle. At last they came
in sight of an old shanty. On the
chimney sat a large .black cat with
eyes like those of the witch.
When the witch saw him she gave
a shriek of derision which was horrible
to hear. Then the cat gave one spring
and lit on her shoulder. "Oh, Tabby,"
she cried, "you shall have the good
meat I have promised you! Look
here!" Pulling the children to their
feet she showed them to the cat, who
struck at them and sc-atched them,
painfully. The old witch drew them
into the house.
In one corner of a room stood a large
cage in which she put them. Then she
stood by and taunted the 1. When it
grew dark she prepared her supper and
gave each of the children dry crust
and some water. Then she went to
bed. In the morning she came to them
and opened the door. All night long
the poor children had been crying and
Carleen was sobbing yet. The old witch
slapped the poor child so hard that she
made her scream with pain. This made
Rollan so angry that he forgot his fear
and said:
"Don't you slap my sister again."
"You little imp, how dare you speak
to me in that manner?" and she slapped
him also. Then she tied them hand
and foot again and dragged them to a
mountain, which was very steep. Here

she loosened the cords on their feet and
made them walk.
They saw a wonderful palace wrought
of diamonds shining in the distance.
The old witch kept chuckling to her
self and sayiiv over and ever: I'Money!
ah! Tabby ami I will live in luxury.
They are very fat. teo," and pinched
them as she said so.
At last they came to the palace. The
light that shone from the diamonds al
most blinded them. They heard an
awful roar from within, when the
witch knocked, that shook the ground.
Then there came the tramp of Some
one that Bounded like an army of sol
diers marching. Then the door was
opened and in the doorway stood a
giant l" feet tall and as fat as he could
be. His face was very red.
He h;id eyebrows that were so thick
that they almoÃi hid his eyes. When
he saw the children he in;i"le a grab
for them, but the old witch snatched
them away and laughed and said, "My
money Qiat."
Then he roared with anger. He called
his wife, who was as big as himself,
and so cruel looking that the Bight of
her seemed to freeze the blood in the
children's veins.
She brought the money and he gave
Jt to the witch. She gave him the
ihildren, who were almost dead with
Tright. The giant wanted to kill them
dt once and cat them for dinner, but
his wife said: "No, we will wait. In
two days it will be your birthday and
then we will have a grand feast."

dark cellar, where rats and lizards
dwelt.
Poor little Carleen was so frightened
that she almost fainted. But Rollan
put his arms axound her and tried to
comfort her. Then he laid his coat on
the damp ground and they lay down
and went to sleep. During the night
they were awakened by a terrible
rumbling and shaking. Then there was
a terrible noise and one side of the cel
lar fell in ruins. A stream of light
came in through the opening and as the
children looked they saw a beautiful
fairy descend from the sky.
She called them by name and told
them to come to her, for she was their
guardian angel. Then she took them in
her arms and ascended into the air. As
they arose the earth opened and the
castle, the giant and the witch were
swallowed up. The guardian angel
took the children home, and they lived
happily ever after.
A QUEER
VISITOR.
BY BERTHA GERTRUDE ALLEN
TULARE.
IT was very dim last night, and as I
hurried home from the factory the
street lamps seemed brighter than
usual. I said I hurried; yes, I al-
most ran. I saw nothing to
frighten me, vet my fear of the dark
ness was irresistible.
On turning down our dingy street I
paused a moment for breath. As I did
so I heard a whirring sound as of wind
rushing suddenly and swiftly around a
corner. Then I heard it again and
again. I looked about, but saw not the
cause of it. Surely it wasn't the wind,
for the trees were standing still â as
still as the stone statues across the
street. . Then again I heard the same
queer sounds.
In my amazement, I looked toward
the sky. Probably I thought that it
could solve the mystery. Instead of
seeing its usual blue color I saw it to be
of a purple hue. How. beautiful it did
look! So royal, so stately!
As I turned around I saw a white
object rising slowly above the tree
tops. There seemed to be something
black on it, but I could not tell what
it was. Then it sank from view again.
Instead of being frightened, I was en
tranced with the purple sky and funny
airship.
When I again looked toward the
place where I had last seen this queer
affair it was rising gradually in the
air. It drew nearer, giving me a fine
chance to see it. It was long, round
and hollow. I distinguished the black
figure to be a man, who sat in the cen
ter and guided it.
It circled above me, shot through the
air with lightning speed and then
again it would pause, as if to rest. I
j saw something else, too. It had the
! shape of a coil, with one end flattened
and hanging down. It looked as if it
were made of fire. Not onl" did it cir
cle in the air, but it followed the air
ship constantly.
Then, almost too quickly to be seen,
it swooped down upon this aerial con
veyance. That was the last I saw of
it; but it had done its work. Instantly
the airship began to fall, fall, till it
reached the earth. Not with a crash
and a bang did it touch, but as if It had
1 n a f.-ather.
I hurried to the spot, and what did
I see? I saw the man only. He was
dead. He was about three feet long
and was wrinkled and shriveled
The next thing I remember was that
I was lying on my own bed. This of
course, is not a true'story It is o'nlv

SYDNEY'S
NUGGET.
BY R. MAUD MALLORY.
REEDLEY, CAL.
IN the early days of California, be
fore it was discovered that the
golden poppy grew above the pre
cious metal, a party of emigrants
started from New England across
the plains to the great unknown
West. Paul Wilder, ever since
his boyhood had longed for a
free life in some unexplored country,
and as his young wife, Madaline, was
willing to accompany him they bade
farewell to friends and joined the
train.
After a perilous journey of six
months the company reached the land
of flowers. One September evening,
near sunset, the train halted for the
night on the brow of a mountain over
looking a beautiful valley. Nestling at
the foot of the mountain was a little
sheltered cove, and Paul and Madaline
were so struck by the beauty of this
spot that they resolved to stop here.
The following morning the remainder
of the party proceeded down the val
ley, selecting suitable homes, and leav
ing the happy young couple with their
hearts full of pleasant anticipations
to lay the foundation for their future
abode. Paul built a rude log house
near a sparkling mountain stream. The
first winter was full of hard work for
both, improving the little home which
had already grown dear to them. Ere
long their home was brightened by the
arrival of a dear little baby boy, and
their happiness seemed complete. Lit

grew older. Yellow curls hung over his
shoulders, and his large, dark eyes had

a dreamy expression. One day Paul
went hunting and did not return at
night. This being unusual the hours
seemed days to Madaline. Morning
came at last, hut brought no tidings
of the lost hunter.
At last she determined to find him.
Fearing the worst, she mounted a gen
tle horse, and, with Sydney, started out
to search. After traveling hours, and
calling loudly she heard a faint an
swer. Hastening in the direction
whence it came she suddenly halted on
the edge of a deep ravine; peering over
she saw Paul lying on the ground be
low. Filled with intense anxiety and
gloomy forebodings, Madeline proceed
ed by a circuitous route to the bottom
of the gulch, and learned that, while
returning from a fruitless hunt at night
Paul had fallen over the precipice. For
tunately his bruises were not as serious
as she had feared. He had sprained
his knee and could not walk, and had
it not been for Madaline's brave effort
to save him he might have perished of
hunger before being rescued.
Madaline bathed his limb in the
stream near by and gave him food
which sho had brought. And helping
him on the horse with little Sydney
they started home. it was late, at
night when the little company reached
the gate. Paul was made as comfort*
able as possible. Madaline was near
ly sick from her long walk. When Syd

A WILD RIDE
FOR
JOAN'S LIFE.
BY LUCY TILLOTSON
SANTA CRUZ.
JOAN BANKS lived at a small army
post on the Missouri River. It was
a lonely, deserted spot and the
nearest village was twenty miles
away.
A vast plain stretched out on all sides
of the post. On the other side of the
river were many unfriendly Indians.
The officers had used some land which
was theirs and they were ready for a
battle any time.
In the fort were only fifty or fifty
five soldiers, and a few officers. Cap
tain Banks, his housekeeper and his
13-yeaÂ»--Jld daughter, Joan, Lieutenant
Jordan and wife and Colonel Roberts.
On an August afternoon the officers
and their wives went out for a ride
on their ponies. Thirty of the soldiers
with Lieutenant Myers had gone to the
Indians' camp to try and make peace
with them about the land.
Joan was left with the housekeeper,
Mis. Cones, who had taken care of Joan
ever since her mother died, ten years
earlier. In the middle of the afternoon
it grew sultry and Joan decided to take
a ride outside of the fort, in spite of
commands.
So she set out. She was dressed in
a light sailor suit of navy blue, and a
jaunty wnlp-brim hat set upon a mass
of raven lucks.
After trotting up and down outside
the fort for about half an hour she
turned her horse toward the valley
where the Indians were encamped. As
the horse was wandering about at his
own free will among the low brush
Joan spied two or more horses' heads
above the ridge, not far from where
she was. In five minutes' time at least
sixty Indians appeared, each upon a
horse, all waving and pointing wildly.
For a moment Joan was dazed. Then
the whole situation flashed upon her
mind and she thought: "Dear me!
The redskins are coming to attack the
fcrt. Forty brave Indians and at least
twenty weaker ones against twenty
five soldiers! I see it now. While Lieu
tenant Myers was talking to them
these wise old redskins slipped off."
All of a sudden the Indians spied
Joa~>; they pointed at her and grunted,
then started on a swift -allop toward
her.
Joan immediately turned her pony
1 and started off on a breakneck speed
toward the fort.
The Indians set up a yell and tried to
catch up with her. Once Joan thought
surely she would be .taken; for her pony
slipped and she fell upon the hard
earth. She jumped into the saddle and
the swift little pony soon left the red
men's tired horses in the rear.
The twenty-five dozing soldiers were

awakened by the clattering of horses'
hunts. They sprang up in alarm and
ran to the barrack doors to see Joan,
hatless and breathless, and the pony
running at breakneck speed.
"Hun, quick! The Indians are com
ing. Get your guns; here they are!"
was Joan's cry, and then she fell out
of her saddle in a faint.
The soldiers met the Indians, and a
fierce light followed, during which
Lieutenant Myers returned and proved
a great help. Out of forty Indians, ten
were wounded and five killed. The In
dians left a sorry but victorious party,
and never again troubled them.
But where was Joan all this time?
She fainted, and was immediately put
to bed by Mrs. Cones.
Captain Banks praised Joan for her
bravery, and tol her she had saved the
fort. He never scolded her for disobey
ing him.
Jo&D became a great favorite among
the ladies. Six months later Captain
Banks retired and went to Brooklyn
to live with his brother, and Joau grew

THE BAD
POODLE.
BY NONIE E. HERBERT.
BLOOMFIELD, CAL.
MR. PETTIBONE walked briskly
down a quiet, shady street,
swinging his serviceable old
green umbrella in one hand and
"nrrying a shiny new carpet-bag
in the other.
Suddenly a sign suspended from the
porch of a neat house opposite caught
his eye and he perused it slowly:
ROOMS TO LET.
APPLY
WITHIN.
"Just the very place I want," said he
as, opening the gate, he walked to the
porch, where lay a curly little white
poodle, which, awakened by the noise
of Mr. Pettibone's entrance, jumped up
with a shrill "ki-yi-yi!"
Mr. Pettibone stepped back and dis
placed a large pot containing a choice
flower, which fell from the porch with a
crash and broke into a hundred pieces.
Mr. Pettibone's anger was thoroughly
aroused. He raised his umbrella in or
der to strike the dog and heedlessly
brought his weapon violently against
an ornamental bracket, which instantly
fell and broke.
Mrs. Jenkins, the landlady, hearing
all this clatter on the porch, of her do
main, hurried to the door and raised
up her hands in astonishment at the
spectacle.
Sitting in the middle of the floor,
amid a heap of ruins, sat the Hon. Mr.
Pettibone. His downfall was caused by
his clumsiness in evading the offensive
poodle, which now danced around him
in a state of wild rage. Mr. Pettibone's
carpet-bag was lying open on the porch
and a medley of hairbrushes, combs anÂ«l
sundry articles of dress lay scattered
near. His poor umbrella was broken,
his tall silk hat was under him.
Mr. Pettlbone's language was not
very choice as he extricated himself
from the ruins. But when he saw Mrs.
Jenkins his polite behavior returned
immediately. Mrs. Jenkins silenced tho
poodle and told Mr. Pettibone, who had
speedily picked up his belongings, to
follow her and she would try and suit
him as to a room. Mr. Pettibone be
stowed a rueful glance upon his ruined
hat and followed his fair conductress
into the house.
Mr. Pettibone, duly established as a
lodger and being pleased with every
thing, thought he would politely ten
der the widow his name and fortune
and aid through life. With that pur
pose in view he sauntered into the
widow's neat little parlor and, smiling
benignly on the flustrated dame, seated
himself in a comfortable chair.
The next minute he jumped up in the
air with a yell that would put to shame
a Sioux brave and bounded around the
room with Mrs. Jenkins' poodle in full
pursuit. Gaining the door he rushed
through and went out of the garden
like a flash.
He had, on coming into the parlor,
unwittingly sat down on the poodle,
which was taking a quiet siesta in the
chair, which brought the wrath of that
being down on him in full force.
Next day a porter came and gave
Mrs. Jenkins the money due her and
removed Mr. Levi Pettibone's belong
ings from the house. Needless to say
Mrs. Jenkins and the worthy poodle
saw him no more.
BILLY'S
FISHING.
BY MARION R. DEWEY.
SONOMA.
IT was a warm day in summer, just
the day to go fishing, Billy Barlow
thought. As Billy wasn't the boy
to linger about the house when
there was any prospect of weeding
the garden in view he sneaked
off and made the best of his
way to the river, with rod, line
and a can of fish worms as bait.
We find our young angler lying in the
shade on the bank, but making no pre
tense of fishing. He lay still awhile,
listening to the drowsy hum of the bees
as they flew from flower to flower and
to the clatter of the mowing machine
as it cut the grain in the field.
"Well, I'd better hurry up, I guess,"
said Billy, aloud, lazily sitting up.
At that moment a fish popped his
head out of the water
"Poma nn." it said.
-Marian Douglas
Billy stared. He had never heard a
fish speak before.
"Come on, I say!" repeated the fish,
severely. "Are you deaf?"
Billy found his tongue. "Where shall
I go?" he asked.
"Follow me, of course, you dunce!""
replied the fish.
Billy, without second thought, plunged
in. He sank down to the bottom with
out feeling any discomfort.
"Well, I don't see why folks want to
make such a fuss about being
drowned," said Billy to himself.
He looked around. It seemed as
though he stood on a hillside, although
he was at the bottom of the river.
BERNARD COMING FROM THE FOREST BRINGING A STRANGE CHILD
"Didn't I tell you to follow me?" said I
a voice beside him. "Stop staring i
around and come along."
Billy looked around and beheld the
fish lazily swimming around his head, j
He didn't exactly relish the idea of be- j
ing ordered around by a fish, but, to i
tell the truth, Billy was somewhat
afraid of it, and he thought it best to
submit.
The fish led the way, and Billy fol
lowed, picking his way cautiously be
tween great sharp stones which threat
ened to c\it his bare feet. His progress
was necessarily slow, and at last the
fish turned around.
"Why don't you hurry up?" he in
quired angrily.
"If I could swim, perhaps I could get
along faster," said Billy, respectfully.
"I forgot that," replied the fish
thoughtfully. "But here we are. We
have reached our destination."
Turning a bend of the river Billy al
most ran into a company of fish who
were lazily sporting about.
"Here, take care!" cried his conduc
tor. "Sit down and behave yourself."
Billy obeyed, but the next moment an
angry squeal made him aware of the
! fact that he had sat on a fish. He im
; mediately spraiig up, filled with dis
may.
"I wish," said the insulted fish, "that
you hadn't brought such an intractable
specimen."
"Well, he was the only one around,"
sulkily replied Billy's conductor, "and
I wasn't g"ing to look for another. I'm
â¢ tired of acting as a servant for you fel
j lows. If you don't like him, get an
i other, if you can find one!"
The other iish was about to make an
angry reply, when Billy interfered.
"I didn't mean any harm," he said,
"but this fellow here" â indicating his
quide â "treated me awfully."
"Well, well, to business," interposed
another, seeing that a general row was
imminent. "Wearemembers of a society
of fishes, whose purpose is to find out
more about that peculiar race of beings
called humans. After you answer all
our Questions you are to be confined
in a cave, as we wish to experiment
upon you."
Billy thought that the joke was going
too far. He sprang up and ran off,
screaming "Help! murder! police!" at
the top of his voice.
Than, an angry cry burst, from the
fishes, and Billy had a dim recollec
tion, afterward, of great, horrid mon
sters rising up around him, snapping
their jaws in a manner that made Billy
shiver with fright. Suddenly a par
ticularly larfee one opened his mouth to
swallow him and all seemed lost.'
"Why, Billy," exclaimed a familiar
voice, "lying here asleep! Get up, lazy
bones!"
Billy sat un. wondering. He was sit
ting on the bank, and before him was
standing his elder brother.
."Where's the fish and all those big
alligators?" asked Billy.
"Get out! You've been dreaming!"
said his broths-
Billy got up and walked slowly home.
"I'm glad it was a dream, anyhow,"
he said.
THE GIRL WHO FORGETS.
Once the Little Girl that cried
LooKmg through her tears espied
Lovely motes of colored light
In the fringes of her eye-
Just as when the weather clears
\jg And the clouds are put to flight
There's 3 rainbow in the sky.
And the Little Girl that cried. /
As she saw this lovely sight â <' <
This fine rainbow in her tears-
Would forget the reason why
She had thought it best to try.
THE
NEW
MASTER.
BY ANITA M. TOMASINI
SUISUN CITY
LEROY NUCOMB sat reading on
the shady porch of his cozy lit
tle home built half way up the
sides of the noble Sierras. Like
an eagle's eyrie it commanded
a fine view of the Sacramento
Valley, with its green orchards and
well-kept farms. Away in the distance
could be seen the bay, dotted with
ships. But on this particular day all
this grand scenery lay unnoticed be
fore Leroy's eyes. He was deep in
those dear old tales of the Arabian
Nights, when Bernard, his only play
mate and companion' came barking
playfully up to him.
"Well, old chap," said the boy, laying
aside his book for a moment to caress
his pet, "where have you been for the
past three days? I am afraid you have
found a new master somewhere, one
you like better than me. Haven't you?"
he asked playfully, patting the shaggy
head.
For the past five years Bernard had
been the faithful guardian of the
"Aerial Farm, "as it Was callad. Never
for one moment had he been known to
wander away. But for the past month
he had weekly made excursions to the
woods, sometimes being gone three
days at a time.
Leroy now romped with him and then
tired out returned to his book. Not so
with the dog. He wished to play at
hide-and-seek, and tried by licking his
master's face to make his wishes
known. But Leroy, like so many tired
boys, let his temper get tMe best of him,
and, giving the dog a sound cuff, said,
"Clear out and go to your other mas
ter."
The dog stood, for a moment with
drooping head, then trotted quickly
away.
Leroy read on till the pine trees' shade
made it too dark to see, and then throw*
ing his book upon the porch, he ran off
to seek Bernard, expecting to fin- 1 him
at the bnrn. His search was in vain.
The next day passed and the next, and
still no sign of Bernard. Every night
saw the repentant little master sob
himself to sleep.
The sixth day passed as slowly as all
days had passed since Bernard's disap-
I>i-:i ranee, and Leroy again sat upon the
little perch, this time studying the beau
tiful panorama below him.
What was that he heard? Was it a
child's cry? Again that pitiful cry, this
time followed by a joyful bark. He
knew the bark. The cry did not trou
ble him now. He bounded over the low
garden wall and through the thicket.
But what was this? Bernard, lean and
tired-looking, came slowly down the
wood path, and on his back, bound fast
with ropes, was a tiny flaxen-haired
girl. The frightened child was weeping
bitterly and struggled to free herself.
Mrs. Nucomb cut the cords that
bound her and washed and fed her. She
was too young to talk, but in the pocket
of her little apron they found a note.
It read:
To the owner of this dog: I tale the
liberty of sending this child to you, for,
from the appearances of this dog, you
are a kind-hearted person. I stole her
back East from her parents, but my
conscience has pricked me too severely
since I've seen how sweet a child she
is growing up. 'Twas a year ago I stole
her, because I was jealous of her fath
er, and now her mother is dead. Her
father shall not have her! I am going
to start for Australia to-day. Take
good care of Leona for her dear moth
er's sake, and oblige LONG JIM.
So this was Bernard's new master!
How he had ever met the child, where
she lived, who her parents were, who
was her kidnaper, were never found
out. She is now one of California's fair
est daughters, and her husband, Leroy
Nucomb. one of the most prominent of
her native sons.

HIGH SCHOOLS'
MORAL FORCES
Professor Brown on an
Important Pedagog
ical Problem.
Defines the Ideal General
Culture Course for Sec
ondary Schools.
Probability of a Scarcity of Teachers
Positions lor University
Graduates.
Professor Elmer E. Brown of the Uni
veraity of California concluded yester
day morning at Berkeley a series of lec
tures on "Secondary Education" by sum
marizing the probit-nis of secondary edu
cation in this State. He said:
Among the most Important problems is the
securing of more adequate support for high
schools. This, I think, can be done without
any amendment to our existing State constitu
tion. California will never 1" a leading State
in the matter of secondary education until it
reaches the stage reached by Massachusetts,
where the establishment of secondary schools
is not permissive but obligatory on communi
ties of adequate size.
The differentiation of secondary schools is
also an important problem and one that will
need jrreat attention before it can be satis
factorily realized. Of till greater Importance
is the problem of making the high school a
moral force in the community, The period of
the child's life during which his secondary
education Is going on is a time when the most
lasting mor&I impressions are formed. It is
the time when skepticism, religious, philo
sophical and scientific, becomes strongestâ
when the child cornea to doubt tilings that had
previously been considered settled. Principles
are apt to become lax unless the pupils have
strong, positive teachers to give them strong,
positive assistance. This is eminently the
period In which the children should be made to
realize that principle should govern their ac
tions and that dishonesty in every form should
be shunned.
Professor Brown summed up the re
sults of ihe Investigation Into the course
of study in secondary schools as follows:
Every adequate general culture course of
secondary prude is, ipso facto, an adequate
preparatory course for college.
Every school; from the primary school to the
colleK*-, should point to something higher.
Every schoul Should he Independent and at the
same time dependent. Each has its responsi
bilities, wl::<h cannot be : irked on to another
school. Every general culture course of study
should introduce the student to the four great
studies, tory, mathematics, literature and
science, in â pier to give him a chance to see
to what he is adapted.

Mr. I â  ncluded the work of tho
t â¢-! in with some brief remarks on science
and scientific Investigation. He said:
To the ordinary citizen or scholar science is
not practical. The passengers on a great At
lf.ntic liner henefit by the science embodied in
the construction of the ship, yet they know
nothing of the. science. That Is for the pilot
and the engineer to know. Hence, it is errone
ous to suppose, as many do, that the study of
chemistry in the schools is of more practical
value than the study of literature. This is
not true. The teaching of science in the
schools is valuable primarily as a means of
culture. Laboratory work should teach a pupil
to see accurately and draw conclusions. The
method and habit of investigation not the
actual knowledge acquired, is the valuable
thing to l>e gained from the study of science,
Laboratories should be used to help the student
to see a.n<i t.i understand nature.

CHURCH AND L.TERATURE
Rev. James McDonald Tells What the
Catholic Church Has Done.
A lecture on "Church and Literature"
was given by the Rev. James McDonald
under the auspices of Phi] Sheridan
Council X". 71. Y. M. 1., in Metropolitan
Temple Friday evening which parked the
building from the stage to the back row
of the gallery.
The speaker confined his remarks main
ly to the position which the Catholic
church has taken in the spread
of literature and deplored the
historical text-books used In the
public schools as being written alto
g>thÂ«'r by prejudiced people, unfaithful
and slanderous ;â > the Catholic church.
He then touched on the manner in which i
literature was preserved through the j
dark ages. "Admitting the fact," he ;
said, "thai the dark ages were all that j
historians claim them to have been, civ- :
Ilization lias much to thank the church
for, ;is it ;i;iil it alone preserved whatever
knowledge was extant at that time and
has handed it down to the present time.
tf we read a true and correct history we
will find that all the works of the' old
classical writers wore faithfully pre
i by the Catholic church, and this
gives the church a standing in lit
history." He then cited many In
â  - of valuable works of literature!
and history which owed their existence at
i time to the Catholic church
ai< ne.
At the close of the lecture the audience
arose as one and sang the old favorite,
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean" in a
most ardent and patriotic manner.
TAYLOR SAVED
FROM PRISON
An Unfortunate Young Man
Arrested on a Trumped
Up Charge.
Justice G. W. F. Cook Scores the
Head of a Collection
Company.
Justice of the Peace G. W. F. Cook on
Friday frustrated what appeared to him
to be little less than an attempt at ex
tortion, and saved Wallace S. Taylor
from being sent to prison for debt. From
the proceedings before the Justice ii ap
peared thai Taylor, who is the son of a
wealthy resident of Brooklyn, had become
Mcd to the proprietress of a lodging
â¢ at the corner of Stockton and Hush
Btn ets to the amount of $95. The hill was
given t<> the Interstate Collection and
Law Company, of which Albert Arm
strong is the head and front.
Armstrong prctesseo great sympathy tor
Taylor, and told him that if he would
give a note f, ir the amount it would be
satisfactory. Taylor gave the note, but
the landlady would not accept it unless
it was indorsed, ho Armstrong sent it to
Taylor's fatner in Brooklyn tor his in
dorsement. He wrote a letter to the elder
Taylor, Baying it was necessary in order
to save the young man from serious
trouble. The father replied that if it was
really necessary he would nnlor.se tue
note.
1 j">n rweipt of this answer Armstrong
filed an affidavit with Judge Conk, setting
forth that Taylor was about to depart
from the State with intent to defraud his
creditors, and asking that he be arrested. '
Judge <'<."k Issued tne order early Thurs
day morning, and Taylor was held in the
ly of the Sheriff until nearly 4
o'clock that afternoon, when the matter
came up for hearing before Judge Cook. 1
Just before the case was called William
Tomsky w;ts appointed to defend Taylor's
Interests, to the evident annoyance of
Armstrong.
Tayior admitted owing the bill, but
<l<-i!ic.l that he had any intention of leav
ing thÂ« State, or that he could do so
if he wished, as he was penniless. He
then told a story of misfortune that
gained him the sympathy of all who
heard it. Taylor said he had been in n
ceipt of a handsome salary, but had lost
his position and was entirely dependent
upon his father's bounty. His wife had '
separated from him, taking their two
children. When they separated Taylor
verbally agreed to make her a handsome
allowance, but it was soon after that he
bis position. Since then his father
has scut him small sums, sufficient to
keep him, but his wife has managed to
ascertain whenever a remittance has ar
rived and has invariably taken every
cent, leaving him absolutely nothing to
live on.
Notwithstanding this, she has begun
suit against him in Oakland to recover
$1800 Bhe alleges to be due her according
to bis promise to provide for her. In
this suit she has failed to account for any
of the money he has given her.
Upon Taylor's showing, Judge Cook
continued the case until yesterday, mean
while releasing him from the custody of
the Sheriff. When the case came up yes
terday Armstrong failed to appear to
prosecute, and Judge Cook quietly dis
missed the proceedings, sharply rebuking
the prosecution for its conduct.
Attorney Tomsky is highly indignant at
the treatment his client has received and
threatens to prosecute Armstrong' for
false imprisonment. He said yesterday
and Judge Cook undoubtedly took the
same view of the case, that Armstrong's
motive was to have Taylor imprisoned in
order to induce the cider Taylor to in
dorse the note; then after that had been
done, to mulct the old gentleman on the
wife's suit for $1800. Disbarment pro
ceedings against Armstrong are also
hinted at.
DEMAND FEES FROM SEAMAN.
The Defense Offer the Plea That the
Vessel Was Under a Foreign
Flag.
R. O. lenders and W. P. Hermann were
examined yesterday before X'nlted States
Court Commissioner Heacock on several
charges of demanding from sailors a
commission or fee for obtaining them
employment on the Argentine barkentine
Sharpshooter. The defendants set up the
plea that at tho time of the commission
of the alleged offense the barkentiiu- was
under the Argentine flag. The Govern
ment set up the contention that the bark
entine was owned at that time by an
American corporation and that the Fed
eral statutes were operative In her case.
Since the arrest of the defendants the
barkentine has been sold to another
American firm and has been placed under
the American flag and her name changed
to Ruth. Commissioner Heacock neld the
defendants to answer.
In the Divorce Courts.
I-iillle Cole commenced suit yesterday to
secure a divorce from Amos Cole on the
ground of cruelty.
Pietro Berella has been sued for divorce
by Letterina Berella on the ground of
cruelty.
Judge Belcher yesterday granted Ella
Peyser a divorce from Morris Peyser on
the ground of failure to provide; Mildred
A. Thomas from J. A. Thomas, failure to
provide.
Trouble Over Advertising Bights.
Len D. Owens and Thomas H. B. Var
ney, advertising agents, commenced in
junction proceedings yesterday to re
strain John Furness and William Bogen
from tearing down a temporary fence
around the St. Ann's building property
They claim that the defendants entered
into a contract with them, giving them
the advertising privileges on the fence
and that the defendants now threaten to
tear down 1 the fence.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The State's Big Mineral
Collection May Go to
Omaha.
Big Mining Company's Scheme
to Run Prospect Tunnels
Under a Town.
If California secures a creditable min
ing display at the Transmlssissippi Con
gress it will l>e through the sending there |
of a large portion of the collection in the j
State Mining .Bureau. This collection is !
being packed preparatory to being trans- j
ferred to the future quarters of the Mm- \
ing Bureau in the new ferry depot, and |
efforts are being made to have It sent to
Omaha. This is by far the best use that
can be made of it during the time in
volved, and moet enterprising mining
men interested in the future of the in
dustry in this State will hope that the
bulk of it will be forwarded and attract- j
Ively displayed; Other Western mining ;
States Will have superb displays and Cali- j
fornia needs the auvertising as much as I
any of them. Messrs. M. 11. de loung, j
'iney L. Ford and Charles G. Yale have !
been appointed commissioners to look
after tne matter of a mineral exhibit,
and they request contributions of ores,
minerals, etc., from all over the State.
One of the noticeable features of the
I Klondike rush at tins particular time is
I the rate-cutting from I'uget Sound to
Juneau, Dyea and Skaguay, which has al
ready made the trip a cheap one. The
result is that hundreds are going to those
places with but little more money than
enough to take them there, lured by the
hope and expectation that there will be
plenty of chances to make money some
now, whereas these places are overrun
with people looking for a chance to
"rustle," and hundreds are unable to get
! a day's work at low wages. The Alaska
1 Mining Record takes this view of it
"lt is difficult to estimate the harm
which would come to Alaska in the event
of a material cut in the passenger rates
between our ports and the cities of the
; coast. The immediate result would be
; the flocking hither of thousands who are '
: now kept away only by the fact that the
â  present fares, reasonable though they are
are still too high to permit their coming!
Ignorant of the true conditions obtaining
! here thousands entertain the belief that
! they have only to reac*i Alaska to find
j remunerative employment, and that In a
! short time a sufficient sum can be saved
j to enable them to outfit for the gold fields.
! A low passenger tariff would bring to
Alaska hundreds of deserving men, who
would find too late that this is no poor
man's country."

Absorbing as are the details of war, peace has its victories and commerce its joys.
Only a brief two weeks ago Easter was our topicâ Easter with its new creations in costumes
and millinery. Last Sunday we spoke of house-cleaning and the helps we had to the
housewife. To-day we look back over the period (nearly six years) that Hale's has been
known to the careful buyers of San Francisco and we note with pardonable pride how Hale's
original store has kept on "annexing"â kept on "making war" on high pricesâ kept on
buying and selling for spot cash, until to-day Hale's in San Francisco actually covers
twice the amount of floor space they did less than six years ago. The store which steadily
and persistently grows must have something more than the ordinary at its back. The store
which has made itself felt as "San Francisco's most progressive dry-goods house" has the
strongest possible asset in the CONFIDENCE of the PEOPLE. Next week is our anniversary
week, and therefore in looking over our new annexâ our increased stock and facilities
âseeing how in the vast increase of floor space we can handle our increasing trade, Hale's
feel that probably the most pleasing thought is that the people know where good goods
("Hales goods") are retailed for cash at the lowest possible profit. It is one of the strictest
rules of Hale's that all goods shall be truthfully advertised and sold only on their merits.
Following out this rule, these new goods will be put on sale Monday at 8 sharp, and will
remain on sale until sold out. We don't expect to duplicate these close prices this season.

A report is current in Placerville that
the Gold Note and Philadelphia mines of
the Brownsville district have been sold
by R. S. Haw. who has been in San Fran
cisco this week.
Then- is considerable copper in this
county at various points, which if devel
oped to some extent would induce the in
vestment of capital by money.cd men. as
copper is something that will pay hand
somely in mining. â Yreka Journal.
During the past week a pocket of up
ward of $2000 was taken out of the Big
Four mine on the Coe ranch, Kelsey
Township, and there is more in sight.â
Placerville Nugget.
According to the Maxysville Democrat, i
a new era has been entered upon in |
Browns Valley. The discovery made in
the mining camp one day last week
promises to infuse new life into that sec
tion, for experts say that the strike down
on the 800 level of the Pennsylvania mine
gives to many men assurance of severai |
years' employment and to the capitalists '
who furnished the money for the further
ance of the project a splendid guarantee
of rich returns on their investments. The
new vein is said to be eleven feet across
and that it will average $10 a ton.
The mill and hoisting works are being
put in shape for operations as rapidly as
possible at the Lightner mine, and it is
expected to have the mine in running pr
der before the summer opens.â Mountain
Echo.
Machinery for the development of the
Keystone mine, Calaveras County, has
been bought, and will soon be installed.
There Is promise that this mine will be
come one of great value.
A Placerville correspondent of the Min
ing and Scientific Press gives the follow
ing interesting items concerning more of
those long abanHoned mines that are now j
coming to the front with riches: "The
old Columbus mine has been unwatered
and the ledge has been found. Active \
work will continue on this property, I
which has never been worked to a depth j
of any consequence and has been aban
doned eighteen years. It is a matter of
record that from surface diggings, and to
the shallow depth of sixty feet, a few
Swiss-Italians took out enough money to
buy large holdings in Marin County,
where they live to-day in luxury and ease.
f am reliably informed that Hanley &
Poor, who are working the porphyry !
eeams near Kelsey, sold $2500 worth of ;
gold here last week. This porphyry for- ;
mation is a feature of that section on !
Rock Creek and the American River. The i
old Dalmatia mine was a sample of the j
rich products of that locality. This is
another property that was not worked
to any great depth."
The "Winnemucca Silver State says the
borax production of Humboldt and
Churchill counties this season Is expected !
to be larger than ever, owing to the V& |
cent tariff. It also states that the soda
product from the Inyo County deposits I
and from Nevada are expected to be |
large.
The outlook for water for mining and !
irrigating purposes in this section is not
as bright as it might be. It Is stated
by a man who recently arrived from the
mountains that the snow is not more
than two feet deep in Bear Valley, where
usually at this season of the year it is
from twelve to fourteen feet deep. The
Mr reservoir at Silver Valley is not more
than half full, which certainly betokens
a small supply of water next summer.â i
Mountain Echo.
The work of sinking the Cross Shaft in I
Angels Camp 500 feet deeper has been !
commenced. When this work is com- j
Dieted the shaft will be 1500 feet deep.
The Cross is one of the Utica group, and
is located on Circus Hill, immediately in
the center of the town.
The south shaft at the Gwin mine has j
been cleaned out to below the 1100-foot !
level, and although it has been closed for ',
the past twenty years it is in a very good j
condition. The pay chute in the old shaft j
on the 1400-foot level is over 1000 feet in
length.â Calaveras Chronicle.

A rich strike has been made on the j
desert in San Bernardino County by F.
J. l>.-lim of this city and A. H. Luscomb
of Bernardo. Mr. Dc-hin returned Friday
night from a six weeks' prospecting trip
at Twenty-nine Palms in San Bernardino
County and brought along samples of ore j
from oiu- of the mines located. The
samples yesterday assayed $1220 per ton. I
Mr. Luscomh Is working on a claim at
present, and Mr. Dehm will return in the
fall to assist in developing the property.â

A large ruhy was picked up on the des

This district is known as the Ruby dls- I

distance.â Riverside Enterprise.
Albert Smith arrived at Barstcw last

The assay office and sampling mill are !
now about completed. All the machinery j
for the mill is on the ground and the
building is almost completed, and stamps
will soon begin dropping.
It is reported that an exceptionally rich
Strike of copper has Just been made on
the property of the Inyo Mining Com
pany 144 miles north of Inyo. The strike
was made on the 700-foot level. Besides
in.- cupper, gold, silver and lead ores are
now in Ing taken from this property in
paying quantities. A smelter is now be
ing put in which will add materially to
the output, as heretofore all the ore was
shipped either to Denver or San Fran
cisco t6 be smelted. Owing to the recent
copper strike additional mechanism for
smelting that ore will be put in, and |
within three weeks the smelter will be
in operation.â Riverside Enterprise.
The annual report for the New Idria
Quicksilver Mining Company for the year
ending December, 1897, shows net pro
ceeds from sales, $125.1if7, increase in cash
supplies, $3730; total receipts. $128,928;
total expenses, $81,342; net earnings. $47,
586; dividends, $30,000; total surplus, $28,248.
There were produced during the year 15,
310 tons of ore and 3605 flasks. The new
reduction works at the mine in San Ben
ito County were in full operation only
seven months.
The old Redington quicksilver property '
will, it is said, resume work under a Lon- ;
don company, to be known as the Quick- !
silver Mines of California, Limited. It |
is said to have been purchased by G.
Darsie of Scotland and A. McMillan of
California. The capital is $750,000.
There are about ten men working at the
Mount Shasta quartz mine. Three shifts
were to have been put on Monday of this ;
week. The old shaft is being drained
and drifting is in progress to tap the j
bottom, that will probably be finished in
a few days. Good-paying ore is constant- j
ly being shipped to the Keswick smelters. I
Next year the owners contemplate plac
ing electric plants on the property and
ultimately sinking to at least 1000 feet
or more.â Redding Searchlight.
The following news notes concerning
the region about. Ballarat, Inyo County,
are condensed from the Los Angeles Min
ing Review:
"T. H. Pheby, the Panamint pioneer,
has, with his associates, paid $10,000 for
the Burro mine in Jail Canyon, three
miles from the Panamint road. He has
also purchased the Redlands Company's
mill and is moving it. â The South Park
mines, seven miles up Pleasant Canyon
from Ballarat, are working sixteen tons
of free-milling ore daily in a Bryan mill;
averages $25. In the same neighborhood,
the Radcliffe mine, with a five-foot vein
of $25 ore, is opened up with 400 feet of
tunnels and shafts, id has 800 tons of
ore on dump.â About $1000 has been taken
from the Cooper mine with a hand motor
âA fifty-stamp mill is being built at the
Anthony mine.â The Gem and McAllister
mines in Tuber Canyon show up well. â
The Buckeye Con. mines, three miles
south of Ballarat. have produced SSO free
irold per ton on trial testsâ Ballarat is
about sixty miles north of Johannesburg.
There are, all told, nearly 400 people in
the camp, out of whom not less than 100
are working for wages."

EXCITEMENT IN
THE WHEAT PIT
Sharp European Market Causes
a Material Advance in
Prices.
Outsiders Said to Hsve Profited a
the Expense of the
Talent.
The condition of the wheat mar
ket Is nervous and excited, wheat sell
ing at the highest price obtained in many
years, in fact yesterday's prices have not
been exceeded since the well-remembered
Dresbach deal. May wheat sold yester
day at $173; December, $169. Less than
forty days ago May wheat was selling
at $1 35 and December at $1 29.
There was a very large trade dur
ing the sessions of the Produce Exr
change, and a strong feeling existed on
the curb after the closing of the regular
sessions. Shippers have been heavy pur
chasers of spot wheat for several days
just past.
The cause of the advance comes from
a very sharp European market. Liver
pool futures advanced 2d to 3^d, and
cargoes were quoted one shilling higher,
while present cargoes are in many cases
bringing wild prices. The advance in 'he
local market was caused both by tne
strong European market and the con
tinued dry weather which has prevailed
in this State. Another reason given for
the increase In prices is the sharp bidding
by millers for milling wheat, as much as
$1 80 being paid for only fair milling.
The Port Costa mills are bringing
wheat from Oregon to meet their wants.
Both Oregon and Washington wheat is
at present in good demand for millers'
use.
As the dry weather In California has
practically destroyed the wheat and bar-
Fey crops, buyers are invading the terri
tory of the northern wheat-producing
districts. For barley, however, there are
many substitutes, such as corn, oats and
other coarse grains. Already thousands of
tons of corn are said to be in transit to
California from points east of the
Rockies, and local dealers say that there
is a possibility of the market being over
burdened with grains for the substitution
of barley, whereas wheat consumers must
await the harvest of "Washington and
Oregon.
The advance in the price of cereals has
been attended with but little excitement;
it however caused three brokers to go to
the wall, otherwise the trade has lived
through it without disaster. Probably
the biggest winner is Harry E. Wise, who
It is said is $100,000 ahead. Wolf Cerkel
is also reported to be considerably ahead
