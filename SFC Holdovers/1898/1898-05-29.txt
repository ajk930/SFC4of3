CERVERA'S FLEET HAS
EVERYBODY GUESSING
REAR-ADMIRAL WILLIAM T. SAMPSON, U. S. N., Commander of the North Atlantic Squadron,
on the Bridge of His Flagship.
IS CERVERA
RETURNING TO
CAPE VERDE?
KEY WEST, Fla., May 28. â An incoming cruiser brings official
information that the Spanish fleet is not at Santiago.. It is now be
lieved that the enemy is at Cienfuegos, with Schley not far away.
Another arrival, however, says that masthead observations at Cien
fuegos show that the Spaniards are not there either. Only gunboats,
according to this report, are in the harbor.
Positive information brought here to-day by a dispatch-boat from
Santiago de Cuba says there was no Spanish squadron in that harbor
on Thursday. Some of the shipsâ not attached to Schley's squadron,
as reported â which left here a week ago are blockading that port.
There is the best authority for saying that there is now no proba
bility of the Spaniards going to Santiago de Cuba, because when
there they would have no chance to communicate with Havana.
The insurgents hold all of the back country. The Spaniards
would, perhaps, if they could, go to Cienfuegos, because there they
would have direct communication with Havana. That they were not
there on Tuesday is absolutely certain, and they cannot get there
now without a fight.
It is thought that our scout boats might try Porto Rico ports soon
with success. The Spaniards must soon go to some port for coal.
Many naval officers think they are now returning to Cape Verde.
It i* not impossible that they were off the northern coast of Cuba on

last Wednesday, but this is not considered likely. It is now certain
that they are not in any of the southside ports of Cuba. This informa
tion comes direct to a cordespondent of The Call from high authority.
KINGSTON, May 28.â The United States auxiliary cruiser
Harvard arrived here this morning from Martinique for coal and dis
patches. While the American gunboat Eagle was at Port Antonio
yesterday three warships which may have been Spanish were sighted
in the offing from the bridge of the Biitish guardship Indefatigible in
that harbor.
BLOCKADE OF SANTIAGO.
Twelve American Warships StatioQed Off the
Entrance of the hjarbor.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 28.â The United States auxiliary
cruiser Harvard, formerly the American line steamer New York, ar
rived here this morning, having left the American fleet at noon yes
terday.
Twelve American warships are now outside Santiago de Cuba
harbor, and Admiral Cervera and the Spanish fleet are almost cer
tainly inside. But nothing certain is known as to the communication
which Commodore Schley has had with the shore, or as to the num
ber of Spanish fighting vessels bottled up in the harbor.
It is to be presumed that the Harvard has important dispatches for
the naval authorities at Washington.
KEY WEST, May 28. â Advices received here from Cienfuegos
state that Cervera is imprisoned at Santiago.

Continued on Second Page.
IT MAINTAINS
ITS PRESTIGE
AS A PHANTOM
Schley Did Not Arrive Off Santiago de Cuba Un
til Six Days After the Spanish
Ships.
WASHINGTON, May 28.â The Navy Department to-night gave out that it
had received information that the Spanish fleet was certainly in the harbor of San
tiago, but the cautious postscript was added that the news had reached the De
partment "through an unofficial source."
This is the situation in a nutshell. The Navy Department and the public
generally believe that Cervera and his ships have been bottled up by Commodore
Schley, but at a late hour to-night there is absolutely no official information on
which to base this belief.
The best argument thus far advanced in support of the theory that the
Spanish fleet is at Santiago is the fact that although more than sixty American war
vessels have been scouring the Caribbean Sea during the past week not the
slightest evidence has been secured that it is anywhere else.
One of the "wildest rumors of the war
was current this morning to the effect
that the signal officer engaged as cen
sor over a French cable from Mole St.
Nicholas to New York had notified the
War Department that a message
"from a reliable source" had gone over
the wire stating that twelve Spanish
war vessels, presumably Admiral Cer
vera's fleet, and several colliers, had
just steamed out of the "Windward Pas
sage 3rt -i northwesterly direction.
This startling statement might have
meant that Cervera had outwitted
Sampson and was on his way to at
tack the leading cities of the Atlantic
roast. The War Department promptly
denied the canard, which bore evidence
Of having been put on foot to test the
nervous inhabitants of thÂ« southern
coast cities.
There is no doubt the faith of the
administration, which up to Thursday
was strong that Cervera was at Santi
ago, has been shaken by the persistent
rumors of his escape before Schley
mounted guard before the narrow en
trance to the harbor. It is significant
that Postmaster General Smith's news
paper, the Philadelphia Press, which has
given evidence of receiving Cabinet in
formation on more than one occasion,
to-day gives up the Santiago theory,
saying:
'â¢ As Schley was at Cien
fuegos on Tuesday, accord
ing to a dispatch boat report,
and it was over 300 miles
from there to Santiago, it is
absolutely certain that he
did not reach the latter port
before late Wednesday, or six
days after the Spanish fleet
entered Santiago. It would
be a little remarkable if the
Spanish fleet should have re
mained all that time at San
tiago. But there was noth
ing whatever to prevent it
from going out of Santiago
until Schley's arrival."
There is an excellent prospect that a
war balloon will be used by Commo
dore Schley to investigate the harbor
of Santiago, if he is still in doubt as to
its contents by the time the device is
placed on board his flagship.
It is announced to-day that three
famous French aeronauts landed in
New York yesterday with a special ap
paratus used with great success by the
French Government, and that they left
for Key West under instructions from
the Signal Bureau of the War Depart
ment. Their enterprise is understood
to be purely personal and in no way
involves the absolute neutrality of
France.
Admiral Sampson has not reported to
the Navy Department to-day and his
exact whereabouts is unknown. His
movements are now almost independ
ent of the Strategy Board, a change of
policy insisted upon by the President,
who has been much impressed by the
work of self-reliant Admiral Dewey
since his great victory of May 1.
If Schley reports that Cervera has
escaped, Sampson will be instructed to
direct the commodore's movements as
his judgment may dictate.
The Strategy Board hereafter will do
little else than sift the wheat from the
chaff of rumors that reach the depart
ment, cutting out the most reliable re
ports and cabling them to the admiral
commanding for his information.
Admiral Dewey to-day reported to
the Navy Department under date of
Cavite, May 25, via Hongkong, May 27,
that the blockade of Manila was ef
fective and the people of that place are
unable to procure any provisions ex
cept rice. This news has caused the
War Department to redouble its ef-
forts to send re-enforcements to Dewey
at the earliest possible date, as the
President is very anxious that there
shall be an ample force of troops at
hand to command order in case the city
of Manila is surrendered. He is spe
cially solicitous that there shall be no
rioting by the insurgents.
In this connection General Schofleld
has made a suggestion concerning the
question of transports that may have a
wide reaching consequence. Enough
ships cannot be secured to take the en
tire 15,000 soldiers to Manila, and it Is
feared there will have to be a wait of
several weeks for the return of the
transports that take the first two expe
ditions to Manila.
General Schofield has suggested that
all the vessels of a class not fitted for
a voyage to the Philippines, but able
to make Honolulu, should be Impressed
and troops in addition to those sent di
rectly to Manila should be rushed over
to Hawaii. Then the returning trans
ports from the former place could coal
and pick up the waiting forces at Hon
olulu, thus saving three weeks on the
round trip.
But of course that cannot be done
unless tHe stars and stripes are hoisted
at Honolulu, for under no other cir-
cumstances can the islands be used as
a military base. The President is more
anxious to have the resolution of an
nexation pass the House .than the Sen
ate. But Speaker Reed does not agree
with the President in this matter, and
is determined not to permit the resolu
tion to come to a vote.
The adoption of General Schofleld's
plan, therefore, rests upon the ability
of the annexattonists to dispose of
Speaker Reed's opposition, a task that
is by no means a light one.
The President's plans of conquest
over Spanish territory vv?re amplified
by rumor to-day to include the seizure
of the Caroline Islands, which are said
to be suffering from Spanish misrule.
Careful inquiry fails to disclose any
basis for this report. The administra
tion has its hands full without under
taking another comprehensive c:
tion.
OFFICIALS RELIEVED
OF GREAT ANXIETY
Feel Satisfied That Cervera's Fleet
Is in the Harbor of
Santiago.
WASHINGTON, May 28.â The Navy
Department received information to
day which for the first time relieved the
officials of the anxiety and doubt that
they have felt for the last few days and
satisfied them on two vital points â first,
that the American fleet under Commo
dore Schley was outside Santiago har
bor, and, second, that Admiral Cer
vera's Spanish fleet is inside that har
bor.
This information came from a private
source which the naval officials regard
as thoroughly reliable. It was from the
same source that gave the Navy De
partment the first information almost a
week ago that the Spanish squadron
was inside of Santiago harbor.
This source of information has Droved
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
itself reliable thus far, and for that
reason the news received to-day was
accepted cis positive. It did not coma
from any naval or State Department
Officials. There is little doubt, how
ever, that it would b*. supplemented by
official advices from Admiral Schley, if,
indeed, such advices have not already
been received, though up to the ciose
of office hours the Navy Department
had not bulletined anything from
Schley. The officials were in a state of
expectancy, having learned from the
press dispatches from Kingston that
the scouting vessel Harvard was thera
with reports.
Relying on the advices received tha
naval officials feel that the entire mili
tary situation is simplified. With the
Spaniards inside and the Americana
outside of Santiago harbor it is said
that the power of mischief by the Span
ish fleet is at an end. One distin
guished officer remarked that as a re
sult of the information received he felt
ten years younger since yesterday. He
said Commodore Schley could now
spare several of the ships from his
squadron to permit them to join in of
fensive demonstrations elsewhere.
AH Schley needs, it is pointed out, is
a small force to watch the entrance of
Santiago harbor. Two battleships and
two cruisers would be ample for this
service as such a force would largely
overmatch the four armored cruisers in
the Spanish " squadron. In this way
Cervera's Meet can be kept pocketed
without keeping a large number of
American ships out of active service at
other needed points.
In calculating upon keeping the
Spaniards penned up in this fashion
the officials have taken into account the
possibility of the dispersion of the
American blockading fleet by one of
the tropical cyclones that are almost
due at this season. The American fleet
in such a case would be obliged to cut
and run for some neutral port or to
make its way by force Into one of the
Cuban ports for shelter. In either case,
there might be an opportunity for the
Spanish fleet to make its escape, pro
viding the commanding officers were
willing to take the desperate chances of
going out in weather heavy enough to
compel the big American Ironclads to
seek shelter, and we failed to block the
harbor by scuttling barges in the chan
nel.
On her way to this country the Vlz
caya passed through some very heavy
weather, almost approaching the cy
clonic, and proved that her class :i
able to withstand such storms with
perfect safety.
During the day the Navy Department
posted a bulletin giving reassuring ad
vices from Admiral Dewey. This was
the only specific bit of Information
given out during office hours. It was
a day replete with rumors, some of
them of a very sensational nature, but
the various reports of sanguinary bat
tles failed of verification.

AN ATTACK
ON CAVITE
THREATENED
But the Vigilance of Ad
miral Dewey Prevented
Any Hostilities.
Provisions Are Now Very Scarce
in Manila and Foreign Resi
dents Anxious to Leave.
By RICHARD L. STICKNEY.
MANILA, May 25, via Hongkong
May 28.â Rear Admiral Dewey's squad
ron continues to bloifkade Manila, Rear
Admiral Dewey received a message
last Friday evening from the insur
gents notifying him that the Spaniards
intended to attack Cavite at once. The
gunboat Petrel and the dispatch boat
Hugh McCullough were on the alert
all night, and the Callao, one of the
gunboats captured from Spain, moved
to an anchorage whence she could
sweep the narrow neck of land between
Cavite and the mainland with machine
guns. The enemy did nothing, how
ever.
Another alarm was caused last night
by hearing rapid musketry firing back
of Cavite. The McCulloch fired two
shots from her three-inch howitzer,
and the small-arm firing ceased. The
British gunboat Swift arrived here yes
terday from Hongkong, and another
British warship is coming up the bay
as I send this dispatch. The French
cruiser Bruit will soon leave for Lar
gon, her captain reporting that he can
not get provisions in Manila.
Spanish and native soldiers in Ma
nila were in a state bordering on mu
tiny, and the priests gave the Gover
nor $1,000,000. which was probably used
to. pay off the troops. It is reported
that native soldiers have agreed to go
over to the insurgents as soon as the
latter make an attack on the Spanish
position.
Provisions are very scarce in Manila.
Foreign residents of the city are anx
ious to get away, but they do not know
where to go. Insurgents have been un
able to do much yet, owing to a lack
of arms, but they expect a shipment
of rilles in a few days. When these ar
rive they promise to drive the Span
iards into the sea.
Our squadron keeps its health very
well, not much more than thirty men
being on the sick list. Captain Grid
ley goes home by to-day's steamer via
Hongkong, suffering from a rupture.
Commander Benjamin P. Lamberton
takes command of the Olympia. Lieu
tenant-Commander Frederick Singer
takes command of the captured trans
port Manila. The weather is very
hot.
The prize money, which will go to
the bluejackets of Rear-Admiral
Dewey's squadron, as a result of the
destruction of the Spanish fleet in the
bay of Manila, is estimated at $800 in
gold for each man. The Spanish third
class cruiser El Cano is supposed to
be at Ilioilo. American supplies are
anxiously awaited in the interior. Ma
nila is quiet. There is no truth in
the rumor that the Germans in Manila
intend to man Spanish guns when the
city is attacked.

tion of the country that an irresistible
sentiment for immediate action will

Speaker Reed still holds out in oppo
sition to the administration and the
great majority of his party in both
houses of Congress. He has not yet
given any assurance that he will allow
the annexation resolution to be con
sidered.
Advocates of the measure in the

that no change had occurred in the sit

In reply to his message it is under

CADIZ FLEET

Vessels.
DESTINATION IS UNKNOWN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, May 28.â 1t is officially an
nounced that the Spanish reserve
squadron, commanded by Admiral Ca
mara, has left Cadiz. Before going to
its destination the squadron will ma
neuver probably for several days in the
open sea, afterward immediately sail
ing for the Philippine Islands, Cuba or
the United States, as the Government
may judge most opportune. The squad
ron is understood to. be composed of ten
or twelve vessels. "
Senor Sagasta, the Premier, on leav
ing the chamber this afternoon, said
to a group of reporters that the Cadiz
squadron had put to sea to carry out
maneuvers, but would return to Ca
diz.
NKW YORK, May 2R.â A dispatch to
the World from London says: The chief
officer of a steamer just in from Cadiz
said last night:
"When we left Cadiz last Friday the
only Spanish warships there were the
battleship Pelayo, the cruiser Emperor
Carlos V, one torpedo boat and the con
verted cruisers Patriota and Rapido.
The cruisers were at the arsenal.
Everything bore the appearance of un
readiness. The Pelayo's boilers, recent
ly put in at Toulon, had just been con
demned by the superintending engineer
at Cadiz on the ground that they were
of insufficient strength. She was, how
ever, coaling. The Rapido and the Pa
triota had not been fitted with guns and
neither had a crew.
"There is no belief in the reports that
the fleet was going to Manila or any

says: A rumor from Cuban sources is in circulation here to the effect
that Schley has forced the Santiago channel and destroyed the Span

Three Spanish warships are reported off Port Antonio. The
American gunboat Eagle is at that port.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayti, May 28.â A rumor has reached here
of an important American success, but no confirmation of the report
can be obtained. Since the rumored arrival of the Spanish fleet at
Santiago de Cuba no news has reached here, though the cable be
tween this place and Santiago is not interrupted. The significance of
this mysterious silence is not known, but it excites great wonder. No
explanation is furnished beyond surmise based on various inferences.
The theory that the Spanish admiral allowed himself to be bottled
up in the bay of Santiago de Cuba is not entertained here. On the
contrary, the Haytien officials say it is far from likely that such a
thing has occurred. It is hoped that a message from Commodore
Schiey will soon be received at the Mole St. Nicholas or elsewhere.

PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, May 28.â Private advices from Cape
Haytien, which have been received here, state that a fleet of Spanish
war vessels was seen off Cape Francais, near Samana Bay. It is sup
posed the fleet was heading toward Porto Rico.
It is believed in Haytien circles here that the Spanish squadron
has left Santiago de Cuba in order to meet the Cadiz squadron.
According to a report which has reached this place a German
steamer witTi 50,000 sacks of rice on board has run the blockade and
entered the port of Havana.
Late advices received from Monte Cristo on the coast of San Do
mingo report a Spanish squadron has been sighted near there. It is
believed to be Admirai Cervera's fleet making its way to Porto Rico.
This dispatch, however, lacks confirmation.
GUNBOAT EAGLE IN DANGER.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 28. â A dispatch from Port Antonoi
says the lookout on H. M. S. Indefatigable, which is in that port, re

several miles off the coast, steaming in a westerly direction. This an
nouncement has caused Americans here to feel concerned for the safety
of the United States gunboat Eagle, now in port.

Gunboat Scorpion's Officers Confident T^at Cer

KEY WEST, Fla. , May 28. â Admiral Cervera is imprisoned at
Santiago de Cuba. Advices to this effect were brought here this aft
ernoon by an auxiliary gunboat which arrived from Cienfuegos, pre
sumably with dispatches for Washington.
Last Sunday the Scorpion left Cienfuegos and proceeded eastward
on scout duty, going as far as Santiago de Cuba. Five of the auxiliary
ships were lying off there apparently awaiting the arrival of the main
division of the squadron. After an uneventful trip the Scorpion re
turned to Cienfuegos, but found that Commodore Schley had gone,
leaving orders for her to return to Key West.
The officers of the gunboat, when questioned as to Admiral Cer
vera's whereabouts, expressed no doubt of his presence at Santiago de
Cuba. All was reported quiet along the south coast of Cuba up to the
time of her departure, and nothing was known of the Marblehead's re
ported attack on Cienfuegos' blockhouses.

PANAMA, May 28. â One of the passengers of the Italian steamer
Centro America, whom I have interviewed, tells me that shortly after
leaving Cartagena, United States of Colombia, for Colon on Wednes
day they met a Spanish warship convoying a steamer flying the Brit
ish flag. The British steamer seemed to be laden with coal. It is
supposed that both vessels put in at Cartagena.
The passenger with whom 1 talked, Angel Joly, told me he could
not make out what ship it was convoying the collier, but that he is
positive that she carried .a Spanish flag. A British steamer of the
Trince line was due at Colon yesterday with coal, but up to a late
hour last night she had not been sighted. It is thought probable that
the collier with the Spanish warship was this steamer, which may
have been captured.

of the committee on the table. It was

was decisive. The amendment was laid*

Upon the announcement of the vote
Gorman, under the arrangement that
a vote should be taken on his amend
ment, again off ered it, somewhat modified
as to the tax, applying it only to gross
receipts erf corporations in excess of
$250,000 a year.
Nelson (R.) of Minnesota offered an
amendment to the proposition of Gor
man, reducing the amount of the tax
levied from one-half to one-quarter of
1 per cent. '
The amendment was discussed in a
desultory way for an hour, Allen,
Lindsay, Platt of Connecticut and
White participating in the debate.
Pettigrew of South Dakota gave no
tive of amendments he proposed to of
fer to Gorman's proposition and was
proceeding to speak upon them.
Daniel (D.) of Virginia delivered an
extended speech, in which he took
strong issue with those who had con
tended that the tax on corporations
was unconstitutional.
Wolcott <R.) of Colorado followed in
a notable speech supporting the propo
sition of the Republican minority of the
Finance Committee.
An effort was made to secure a vote
on the Gorman amendment, but it was
unavailing.
Mason of Illinois moved that when
the Senate adjourned it be until Tues
day next.
Allison, in demanding the a^es Â«>"ri
noes, said it was highly important that
the pending bill be disposed of at the
earliest possible moment, as every
day's delay meant the loss of needed
revenue.
Mason's motion prevailed by the close
vote of 33 to 31.
The Senate then at 5 o'clock went
Into executive session, and twenty
minutes afterward adjourned until
Tuesday.

In conversation with some friends to

vana I learned that General Blanco ia
making desperate efforts to induce- the
Cuban army to co-operate with the
Spanish troops to fight the American
army of invasion. General Gomez and
the Cuban Government has refused
even to consider such a proposition.
'â¢Captain-General Blanco on May 4
sent Senor Eliso Giberga under a flag
of truce to General Gomez's camp with
this proposition: 'If the Cuban army
will co-operate with the Spanish army
in repelling the American invasion the
Spanish Government solemnly pledges
itself to recognize the independence of
the Cuban republic. If this proposi
tion is accepted all Cubans and their
arms will be admitted with the same
rank in the Spanish army, the junction
of both armies to be effected at Santa
Clara City.'
"General Gomez refused this propo
sition and warned Senor Giberga he
would receive no more messengers
from Blanco on such errands."
Major Lima got this information
from a brother of Senor Giberga who
sides with the Cubans.

Brilliant Military Pageant
Is Viewed at Camp
Alger.
Twelve Thousand of the Men Who
Will Uphold Our Honor Create
Great Enthusiasm.
Call Office, Rigffa House,
Washington, May 28.
One of the most brilliant military
pageants enacted since the mustering
out parade of the Federal troops, down
the streets of Washington, at the clos
ing of the Civil War, occurred at Camp
Alger this afternoon, when President
â McKinley reviewed the troops now
* iju.irtered there.
The demonstration attracted many
thousands from Washington and the
surrounding country to the camp
grounds near Falls Church. There
were 12,000 troops in line. President
McKinley and party went to the ramp
In a special train, leaving the city at
2:30 and returning shortly before 7
o'clock. Besides the President and Mrs.
McKinley, the reviewing iarty includ
ed Vice-President and Mrs. Hobart and
their so-n, Secretary of War and Mrs.
Alger, Secretary of the Navy and Mrs.
Long, Miss Long, General Miles and
itaff and Miss Wilson, daughter of the
Secretary of Agriculture. Among Gen
eral Miles' stafL were Captain Abelgar
of the Norwegian army, military' ob
lerver, aVid General Carlarsco and Col
onel Hernandez, of the Cuban army.
The reviewing stand surmounted a
aigh hill overlooking the parade ground
af the Sixth Illinois. The troops were
massed in front of the parade ground,
immediately on the arrival of the Presi-
Sential party the line, 12,000 strong, be
fan moving. Troops A and C, cavalry,
Lcted as a general escort and did not
participate in the review. The Ninth
Dhio, colored, detailed on advance
picket duty, and the First Rhode Is
.and, which had just arrived, did not
participate. The review lasted more
;han two hours. The men passed the
Presidential stand in company front
Kith arms port. The appearance of
>ach regiment was followed by vocifer
>us cheering. Once well past the Presi
iential party the men fell in fours and
executed a double-quick to quarters.
Throughout the review the President
lat on a platform in front of the stand
md beneath a canopy of American col
Â»rs with the stars and stripes fluttering
fust back of him. With a few excep
:ions the great army of volunteers
â¢ an imposing appearance and the
reviewing party were highly pleased
Rith the result. The Fourth Missouri
md the Sixth Pennsylvania to some
â¢xtent were unequipped. The Missou
â¢ians were without either guns
>r uniforms, a state of affairs which
irovoked great cheering as they march
Â»d past. After the men disbanded some
;housands of them formed a long lane
;hrough which the President and his
>arty drove.
President and Mrs. McKinley and
?\ee President and Mrs. Hobart took
t long drive about the camp, under the
tscort of <;eneral Graham, in command
tt the camp, and his staff. Then the
President, amid cheers, was driven
jack to the railroad station at Dunn
Loring, where he boarded the special
rain in waiting and was carried back
t) the White Hous->.
Two more regiments came to swell
he army of volunteers during the day.

Sis remains were shipped home after
I short military service on the grounds.
The liquor prohibition is being rigidly

KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 28.âCap
tain Walker of the Atlas line steamer
Adula, which arrived here to-day from
Oenfuegop, states that provisions in
that town are very scarce. The Gover
nor of Cier.iuegos has Issued a procla
mation that all ships laden with pro
visions which succeed in passing the
blockade can have their cargoes ad
mitted free, and that there will be no
port charges of any kind. The land
line between Havana and Cienfuegos
is working, and also the cable line to
Santiago. The American fleet only cut
one cable, and communication was not
interrupted.
The Adula brought away from Cien
fuegos eighty refugees, twenty of whom
were children, but only after she had
been detained for several days by ths
Spanish authorities. Why he was de
tained Captain Walker was not in
formed. The Adula on her arrival in
the harbor was boarded by an officer,
who told Captain Walker she would be
detained. A small gunboat, with a
gatling gun, was detailed to guard her,
but after three days the guard was re
moved.
PRESENTS A FLAG TO
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL
Patriotic Pacific Grove Woman Causes
Old Glory to Be Hoisted Over
Young America.
PACIFIC GROVE, May 2S.â Mrs. B.
L. Hollenbeck yesterday presented a
handsome flag to the Pacific Grove
public school, and amid the cheers and
applause of school children and their
parents and friends the stars and
stripes were unfurled for the first time
over the high school building. A pretty
ceremony was gone through, one strik
ing feature of which was the singing
of patriotic songs by the grammar
school pupils. Among the songs was
a clever parody on "Yankee Doodle,"
entitled "Yankee Dewey Dandy."
Mrs. Hollenbeck presented the flag
with a few graceful and patriotic re
marks, and G. D. Kierulff, sub-princi
pal of the high school, received it on
behalf of the school. The flag was then
fastened to the waiting halyards and
hoisted, while cheer after cheer was
sent up by the crowd.
CONCORD'S FAREWELL TO

CONCORD, May 28.â Our people
turned out en masse yesterday to bid
godspeed to seven brave boys who left
on the train for San Francisco to en
list. The school was dismissed an hour
before the usual time that the scholars
might be on hand to bid the boys good
by. A fife and drum carps was organ
ized to lead the boys to the depot. The
procession was under command of
Judge John J. Burke, a Union veteran,
while John W. Guy, a Confederate vet
eran, was the proud bearer of old glory.
A cavalcade of mounted youngsters
helped to swell the dimensions of the
procession. The parting at the depot
was effecting in the extreme, mothers,
fathers, sisters, brothers and sweet
hearts mingling their tears.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1898.
GREAT ARMY
TO BE LANDED
NEAR HAVANA
NEW YORK, May 28.â The Herald's Washington correspondent tel
egraphs: It is the intention, of President McKinley and the War De
partment that the invasion of Cuba shall be made with a decisive
rush. There will be no invasion, a p?rson high in administration cir
cles informs me, until there are 100,000 men thoroughly equipped and
encamped at Tampa.
My informant pointed out lhat General Blanco had an army of
perhaps 100,000 acclimated troops. In the opinion of the authorities it
would be foolish to send less than that number of United States sol
diers, particularly as many of them are raw recruits and not accli
mated.
When the blow is struck it must be decisive, and it will take place
almost immediately â¢ after troops have been landed. There will be no
bombardment of Havana until the American forces are on Cuban soil,
and then the army and navy will make a combined attack.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. May 28.â 1n the northern
transept of Westminster Abbey, where
England's greatest dead rest, the body
of the late William Ewart Gladstone
was entombed to-day with the cere
monies of the nation he had served and
of the church he had loved. His grave
is beside that of his life long adversary.
Benjamin Disraeli (Lord Beasonsfield),
whose marble effigy looks down upon it
decked with the regalia which Glad
stone had refused. The possible future
Kings of Great Britain walked beside
the great commoner, and the nobility
and learning of the state surrounded
the bier, though the wish of the de
ceased had been for simplicity.
Six tall candles burned beside the
bier, and on either side stood the sup
porters of the pall. The Prince of
Wales and the Duke of York were at
the head of the coffin, and ranging be
hind them were the Marquis of Salis
bury, Earl of Kimberly, A. J. Balfour,
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Lord
Rosebery and Mr. Gladstone's two old
time friends, Baron Rendel and George
Armistead.
Within the chancel stood the Dean of
Westminster, and behind him were
gathered the cathedral clergy, the
Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Bcarlet and white surpliced choir, filling
the chapel. The mourners who sat in
the stalls nearest to the bier were Mrs.
Gladstone, her sons Herbert and Ste
phen, and other members of the fam
ily, with little Dorothy Drew, Mr. Glad
stone's favorite grandchild. The Prin
cess of Wales and the Duchess of York
occupied the dean's pew, opposite.
In tiers of temporary seats in the
north and sc-uth transepts were assem
bled the members of tho two houses of
Parliament, the Mayors of the princi
pal cities;, delegates from Liberal or
ganizations, and representatives of
ether civic and political organiza
tions, while the long nave was
crowded with thousands of men and
women, among them being most of the
celebrities in all branches of English
life. Every gallery, balcony and niche
high up among the rafters held a clus
ter of deeply interested spectators. In
all, 2500 persons were assembled in the
Abbey, all clothed in the deepest black,
save a few officials, whose regalia
gleamed brilliantly from this somber
background. Thousands thronged the
square outside in order to witness the
passage of the funeral procession from
Westminster Hall. A double line of
500 policemen kept an open passage for
the funeral cortege.
The chief officials had assembled in
Westminster Hall at 10 o'clock this
morning. The Bishop of London, the
Right Reverend Mandel Creighton,
D.D., read a brief prayer there, and at
10:30 o'clock the procession was formed
and slowly passed through the great
crowd, a distance of 300 yards, to the
western entrance of the Abbey, be
tween two ranks of the Eton Volun
teers in their buffon uniforms.
The dean read the appointed sentence
committing the body to the earth and
the Archbishop of Canterbury pro
nounced the benediction. Mrs. Glad
stone stood bravely with great com
posure throughout the service. Her
lace was lifted upward and her lips
were moving as though repeating the
lines of the service. She also kept
standing during the only official fea
tures of the service, "The proclamation
by Garter of the style of the deceased,"
as the official programme hr 1 it. Gar
ter enumerated the various offices
which Mr. Gladstone had held in his
life from the beginning. The organ
then played "The Dead March in Raul."
Finally the Prince of Wales, the Duke
nf York and other pallbearers shook
hands with Mrs. Gladstone, the mourn
ers filed past the grave, taking a last
view of the coffin, and when they had
been escorted down the nave to the
entrance the people slowly departed.
Memorial services in honor of Mr.
Gladstone were held to-day all over
Great Britain.

ing stanchions and angle iron braces
for the decks, where the guns are to be
located, and also some large bolts for
the bits.
The equipment riggers are now la
boring on a "towing bridle" for the
Monterey. It was an original idea of
Foreman Edward Furlong, and will be
constructed of 4%-inch wire cable. It
will be 360 feet long and goes half way
around the ship, being made fast to the
forward and the amidship bitts. It has
a "pelican" hook at the bow, which
can be made to release the ship from
the towline in an instant, should heavy
weather or the presence of a hostile
ship necessitate it. The intention, ac
cording to the latest information, is to
have the Monterey go to Honolulu un
der her own steam and take a tow
from the Brutus the rest of the dis
tance It is said the idea of having
another tug accompany the monitor
and her consort has been abandoned.
The towing hawsers are three In
number, of 12-lnch Manila, and 370 feet
long. The tug Unadllla made a spe
cial trip for them to-day and brought
them to the navy yard to-night.
HOT ON THE TRAIL
OF SPANISH SPIES
NEW YORK, May 28.â A Key West
special to the Herald says: Rumors of
work being done by Spanish spies con
tinue to fill the air here, but up to to
night no arrests have been made. Cap
tain Merrill, in command of the bar
racks, has a large detail of men scour
ing, and he expects important captures
will be made soon.
It is reported that the men who are
believed to be the ones who shot Ser
geant Richards, at Mortar Battery, the
night before last, were seen again to
day in the neighborhood of the fort.
There is something mysteric-us about
the matter, and it is a subject of com
ment that no arrests have been made.
It is also alleged that there are many
spies here who are not of Spanish birth.
A few days ago a foreigner who was
not a Spaniard applied for work at
Venable's machine shops. He worked
there but two days, when he mysteri
ously disappeared, and it in generally
believed that he was an emissary of
Spain.

GERMANS
CONTINUE
ABUSIVE
With Few Exceptions the
Press Continues Say=
inÂ£ Mean Things.
But a Socialist Paper Shows
How the United States Has
Scared Europe.
BERLIN, May 28.â With few excep
tions the German press continues its
campaign of abuse on America, either
outspokenly or by inuendoes. The Con
servative, Centrist and National Lib
eral papers are especially virulent,
while the Liberal and Radical newspa
pers do not disguise their dislike for
the United States, and attribute base
and selfish motives for its action. Even
a leading German magazine, Deutsche
Rundschaull, in the June number, joins
in the general newspaper sentiment.
An article in this magazine written by
Herr yon Brandt, formerly German
Minister to China, on the subject of the
Hispano-American war winds up by
dubiously hoping that "at the close of
the war the United States will show
something which their political course
has often lacked, namely, respect for
the rights and dignity of others."
The Socialist press alone is friendly.
The Vorwaerts, in an editorial be
lieved to have been written by Herr
Liebknecht, the Socialist leader, and
which has since been strongly criticised
by other newspapers, says, after de
scribing the fears aroused in Europe
by the abandonment of its policy of
isolation by the United States:
"Their first move produces a revolu
tion in the markets of the world and
famine in decrepit Europe â spectre of
starvation. Their first blow was a
crushing naval defeat of an ancient
monarchy, which they forbade to con
tinue the work of wholesale murder.
One more defeat and that monarchy
falls, the dynasty is hunted out, and a
republic is established. What strength
and vigor are displayed! And there
with decrepit Europe has never thus
far reckoned. A new power is here."
The papers teem with sarcastic com
ments on the alleged inactivity of
America, attributed to a "lack of cour
age" or to "unreadiness of its forces,"
and especially to the "notorious condi
tions of insubordination of American
military"
The Mllitaire Wochen Zeitung, the
leading army organ, in an article writ
ten by an officer of the general staff,
says: "Any attempt of the United
States to effect the landing of large
bodies of troops in Cuba before the
raw and undisciplined hordes have at
least six months training will inev
itably result in disastrous and whole
sale slaughter. It is even very doubt
ful if these so-called soldiers will stand
their ground against the veterans of
Spain next fall. We only need recall
the first battle of Bull Run to become
aware of the absence of staying qual
ities of their militia, badly led and
worse drilled."
The Government press is strangely si
lent, with exception of occasionally de
nied accounts, which are construed as
being unfriendly to America, Nothing
has been done by the "inspired" news
papers to stem the general current of
sometimes veiled hostility permeating
the whole German press. They have not
even replied to the various articles of
the Bismarckian press this week in
which Europe is warned of the "coming
American seizing the markets," and a
demand is made for a combination to
"combat this invasion before it is too
late."
A Spanish story in regard to the
American warships using the Spanish
flag at Guantanamo, Cuba, in order to
effect a surprise, is generally disliked,
even the Cologne Volks-Zeltung, other
wise hostile, saying: "The news is in
credible. Such a piece of cunning cow
ardice the Americans could not be
guilty of."
Everywhere In Germany collections
are being made in aid of the Spanish
war fund. For a month past the Span
iards in this country and their sym
pathizers have contributed largely. The
total thus far contributed amounts to
23.000,000 marks, which sum was
shipped on Wednesday last from Ham
burg to Spain, by way of England.
The German Admiralty will shortly
dispatch the schoolships Moltke and
Vols to the West Indies for the protec
tion of German residents in Central
America.
Regarding the news that Spain has
agreed to cede the Philippine Islands to
France, it is said at the German For
eign Office that Germany has informa
tion that pour parleurs looking to this
end have been proceeding for some
time, mainly through Senor Leon y
Castille, the Spanish Embassador to
Paris, and that the negotiations have
already reached a rather definite shape.
On Wednesday last the Embassadors
of Germany, France and Russia held an
important meeting at the Foreign Office
in Madrid. When they were asked if
these powers are ready to assist in in
tervention in Spain's behalf, no defin
ite answer was made except by the
representative of Germany, Ccnint yon
Radowitz, who said, "At the present
juncture Germany has not joined in an
effort to attempt intervention."
Thereupon Duke Almodivar de Rio,
the new Spanish Minister for Foreign
Affairs, cautiously mentioned the nego
tiations with France above referred to.
Germany's answer to this is found in
a semi-official communication published
on Thursday last, setting forth that
Germany would most vigorously pro
test against the cession of the Philip
pine Islands to France or any other
single power, adding that a cession to
the combined powers of Europe would
be much more acceptable.
It is understood that this declaration
had an effect in Spain, and the whole
project has been dropped for at least
the present.
The German newspapers sharply
comment on the big orders given by the
United States for the building of war
ships. The Post of this city, the or
gan of Prince Yon Hohenlohe, the Im
perial Chancellor, commenting upon
the matter says: "These preparations
go far beyond present needs and were
intended to serve other and more im
portant ends."
The Spanish military agent. Senoi
Sandoval, is still here. It was he who
effected the recent purchase in behalf
of Spain of the North German steamer
Havel.
The Frankfort Zeitung says: "The
Spanish Minister at Copenhagen has In
duced the Government of Denmark to
Instruct the Danish officials In the An
tilles to afford Spain certain facilities
in regard to her fleet."
LANDED FOOD AND
ARMS FOR CUBANS
Cruiser Brooklyn Has a Hot Fight at
Cienfuegos and Kills Many
Spaniards.
NEW YORK, May 28.â A dispatch
from Key West says: It is reported
that Schley's flagship, the Brooklyn,
landed 60,000 rounds of ammunition, to
gether with rifles and food for the Cu
bans, after a hot fight at Cienfuegos on
Tuesday. The fort on the south side
of Cienfuegos was demolished by the
Marblehead, and the Spanish cavalry
was routed by the insurgents. Many
Spaniards were killed, but no Ameri
cans were injured and no Cuban losses
are reported.

MADERA'S
MYSTERY
UNSOLVED
Friends of Deputy Tax Col
lector Kjohn Believe
Him Innocent
Place Confideoce in hfis Story of
th)e Alleged Robbery of the
County's Vaults.
MADERA, May 2S.â This community
Is in a state of suppressed excitement
over the facts connected with the al
leged robbery of Deputy Tax â Collector
William Krohn, -which occurred about
11 o'clock last Tuesday night. The
presence of a San Francisco detective
on the scene and the systematic sift-
Ing by the county officials of all the
details of the case has had the effect
of engendering a bitter feeling in the
minds of a majority of the citizens,
who profess their willingness to stake
their lives on the honesty and integrity
of the young official against whom sus
picion has been directed.
The intensity of this feeling was
made manifest to-day at the meeting
of the Democratic county convention.
The friends of William Krohn, who is
Btill confined to his bed from the ef
fects of the beating administered by
â¢unknown men whom, he claims, as
saulted him and then looted the office
vault of more than $7000 in gold coin,
placed him in nomination for the of
fice of Tax Collector. A whirlwind of
cheers greeted the announcement of
Krohn's name and the nomination was
carried by acclamation.
The present Tax Collector is Lew
Krohn, though the business of the of
fice has been for three or four years
entirely under the charge of William
Krohn, his brother and official deputy.
Both brothers have a host of friends
In the county and for this reason it
may be seen that the whisper of sus
picion that has gone out concerning
the circumstances of the alleged rob
bery has not met a cordial reception.
The story of the alleged robbery as
told by Krohn, as well as the circum
stances immediately following it, may
be briefly retold in order to make clear
the facts upon which the county offi
cials have seen fit to base their act in
ordering a rigid examination into the
case, as well as the open assertion
made by Detective Curtin, who is di
recting the investigation at the in
stance of District Attorney Larew, tha
he believes no robbery was com
mitted, and that Krohn's wounds wer
either self-inflicted or were inflicted b
an accomplice for the preo, ncerted pur
nose of making it annear that the office
vault had been looted of money it did
not contain.
Krohn's story is that he went to his
office on Tuesday evening to work on
the delinquent tax roll. At about 10:30
o'clock two masked men entered the
office by the rear door and ordered
Krohn to throw up his hands. When
he had complied one of the men took
Krohn's keys, locked the front door and
then ordered him to open the vaul
Krohn protested that the time loc
was on the safe where the cash is kep
Inside the big vault. The men repliet
that they knew that the time lock di<
not begin to work until 11 o'clock an
threatend to kill him unless he open
ed the vault and the safe. He co-mplie
with the demand, and while one ma
Btood guard the other looted the vaul
of a bag containing $7500 in gold coin.
The robbers then tried to lock Kroh
In the vault, but a struggle ensued
during which the deputy threw an iro
bar at the robbers. The missile misse<
Its mark and smashed one of the glas
â¢windows of the counter railing. Th
robbers stabbed Krohn twice, slashe
him across the palm of the left hand
beat him over the head with what h
believes to have been a piece of lea(
pipe and left him unconscious on th
floor of the inner office.
It will be remarked that Krohn as
serts that he was attacked at about
10:30 o'clock. At 11:25 o'clock, flfty
flve minutes later, Night Watchman
Tooker heard the crash of breaking
glass and located the sound !n the Tax
Collector's office. He tried the door,
but found it locked.
The Interior was brightly lighted,
"but no one was visible in the office. As
no reply was made to his repeated
knockings Tooker concluded that it
â was a false alarm and went about his
business.
At midnight Tooker was accosted by
Mrs. Krohn, who told him that her
husband had net returned from his
office and that she was afraid some
thing had happened to him. They
went together to the office, but found
the lights were out, the electric cur
rent having been shut off at the power
house at midnight. They could hear
some one moaning inside and presently"
discerned Krohn crawling along the
floor toward the front door. He was
repeating somewhat incoherently:
4'Don't beat me any more. Don't kill
me. Take the money. Don't shut me
up in there."
The door was forced open. Krohn was
dragged outside. He was apparently
unconscious, but when some one said
that it would be best to take him back
Into the office he exclaimed.
"No, don't take me back in there."
Physicians were summoned and they
pronounced Krohn to be unconscious
from the effects of a concussion of the
brain. He remained in an apparently
unconscious condition until 8 o'clock the
following morning, when he regained
control of his faculties.
Dr. Hayden says all of Krohn's
wounds are superficial; that all could
have been self-inflicted; that he might
have feigned unconsciousness. He did
not consider the latter two surmises
were probable. Dr. Reed was of the
opinion that the patient's unconscious
ness was not feigned.
An investigation of the premises dis
closed the fact that the back door of
the office was open; that there were
bloody finger prints on the railing of
the back porch and also <>n the roof of
a low shed over which the robbers are
supposed to have escaped to a vacant
lot in the rear.
There was nothing in the inner office
to indicate that a struggle had taken
place there, except the broken glass of
the counter rail. There was no blood
In the inner office or the one adjoining
It. but neai the f ont door were bloody
hand prints on the marble flagging,
where Krohn had crawled to the door.
There was also the print of a bloody
hand on a paper coverpd package in the
i: terior of the vault. Forty or fifty dol
lars In silver coin was scattered over
thf floor of the vault.
There were several gold pieces lying
about. A bag containing about $200 In !
silver was on top of the safe and in the â 
open safe was a package containing
about $100 in currency. The robbers !
had not made a very clean sweep. On |
the desk where Krohn had been work
ing at his books was a small sheet of
paper containing the following letters i
and figures:
"Memo S 210 178.50. C 91.00. Small
5.45, Total 487.95. Bag 7500.00. Total i
7987.95."
The "S" stands for silver coin; the {
"C" for currency; the word "small" for
small coins and the word "bag" for
the bag containing gold taken by rob- j
bers. Krohn explains that this was a j
memorandum of the amount of money
contained in the safe. When search
was made silver, currency and small
coins were found, but the bag of gold ;
was missing. Though the robbers left j
behind them more than 5300 in cash
they carried with them the piece of
lead pipe they are supposed to have j
used as a weapon and the bunch of
keys. Neither has yet been found.
To-day the tax collector's books were
turned over to Expert M. D. Wood. His
investigation of the accounts has as
yet failed to produce from the books
any corrobdration of the figures con
tained on Krohn's memorandum of
Ccish on hand. It has been Krohn's
custom to make frequent cash deposits
with a local bark. The last deposit
made by him was on May 12, when he
received credit for 5230.
Those who claim to disbelieve the
story told by Krohn point to the fol
lowing 1 list of what are alleged to be
suspicious circumstances: That the
time-lock on the money safe should be
set so that It would not begin to work
until so late an hour as 11 o'clock at
night; that fifty-five minutes elapsed
from the time Krohn says he was at
tacked before the night watchman
heard the crash of breaking glass; that
Mrs. Krohn should become alarmed for
the safety of her husband at so early
anhouras 12o'clock; that the robbers left
behind them several hundred dollars
and carried away with them the lead
pipe and keys; that a memorandum of
cash should be left in a conspicuous
place on the desk, when the books fail
to show the amount of cash on hand;
that the back door of the office should
be open; that the bloody finger prints
outside the back door show that at
least one of the robbers was wounded,
when Krohn has no remembrance of
having inflicted a wound; that Krohn
was rendered unconscious by wounds
that are merely superficial; that
being unconscious, he should pro
test against a suggestion to carry him
back into the office; that the night
watchman was unable to see the rob
bers in the office after hearing the
breaking of glass; that there is no trail
of blood from bloody hand prints in
the vault to hand prints on the marble
flagging near the front door, where
Krohn was found; that the time was at
hand when Krohn would have to make
his final accounting for the collection
of taxes which became delinquent on
April 25; that so great an amount of
money had accumulated between May
12, the date of the last deposit, and
May 24, the date of the robbery; that
there were no evidences of a violent
struggle.
On the other hand, Krohn's friends
rightly assert that there are none of
the foregoing alleged suspicious cir-
I cumstances that are not possible of in-
I nocent interpretation when considered
\as possibilities or even probabilities.
i They point to the fact that Krohn has
! always been a young man of exem
! plary habits; that he has never been
known to make use of greater amounts
of money than would be Justified by his
circumstances in life.
Lew Krohn, the Tax Collector, has
I signified his intention to make good to
j the county the amount stolen, as, under
i the law, it should have been turned
j over to the rvv-nty Treasurer some
' time ago. He considers that this fact
renders him responsible for the loss,
even though the money were stolenâ a
| question of which he has no doubt.

ATTACKED THEIR LANDLORD
Lively Row in a Photograph Gallery
on Market Street.
There was a lively row at 731 Market
street last night, which for a time threat
ened to result in bloodshed.
Some time ago Frederick Haussler, a
photographer, sublet part of his gallery
to Herman Jans, J. C. Jones and Charles
Holsman, who advertised themselves aa
German specialists. According to Haus
ler's story he crew tired of the tenants
and ordered them to vacate. As they per
sistently refused he turned off the gas
supply in their apartments and put a lock
on the door. Last night he says he was
walking along the hallway with a hatchet
in his hand when one of the men struck
him in the face, knocking him down.
They then repeatedly kicked him, and,
when his wife interfered, she was also
brutally treated. The "German special
ists," "however, tell a different story.
They claim that Haussler attacked them
with a hatchet, ajid to protect themselves
they knocked him down. They deny
striking Mrs. Haussler, and claim that
only a few days ago their landlord walked
through their office with a rifle on his
shoulder and threatened death to any
body who attempted to stop him.
While the row was in progress several
police officers, who were attracted to the
house by the screams of Mrs. Haussler,
entered the place and arrested the com
batants. They were taken to the City
Prison and booked on charges of dis
turbing the peace.
ROBBED HIS BENEFACTOR.
Edward Stanley Arrested for Stealing
a Cornet.
Captain Charles Hogenson of the Vol
unteers of America last night caused the
arrest of Edward Stanley for petty lar
ceny. Hogenson claims that Stanley was
recently discharged from San Quentin,
and as he promised to lead a better life,
he allowed him to occupy a cot in the
barracks of the Volunteers. To repay his
kindness, Stanley visited the barracks
yesterday afternoon and stole a cornet
belonging to his benefactor. He was ac
companied by another man, for whom the
police are now looking.

WHEAT TO
REACH TWO
DOLLARS
Joseph Letter's Big Deal
Will Be Closed Next
Tuesday.
By Clever Manipulation the Young
Chicago Millionaire Has, Made
Big Money.
CHICAGO, May 28.â Joseph Leiter's,
the greatest May wheat deal on earth,
will end Tuesday. The shorts have but
one day's grace left. They must get in
before 1:15 o'clock Tuesday afternoon.
The tip is out that the price will be
marked up to $2. No one disputes Jos
eph Leiter's ability to put the price up
to $3 if he wants to, as he is a dictator
for the time being, and might, if he de
sired, bid it up to $5. Those very near
him say he will be satisfied with $2.
In the famous Hutchinson corner, in
September, 1888, it advanced 68 cents
on the last day of the month to $2, and
Leiter has a desire to see $2 wheat
again. It will be necessary to take but
very little, as there is very little wheat
held outside of his office.
The tailers who usually follow a deal
have generally been driven out. A
good many of them sold out yesterday j
at $1 70, when Jackson Brothers bought j
150,000 bushels for New York Bhort, j
which was said to be the largest out
standing individual line. The remain- j
ing interest is in small lots. The price ;
yesterday was held at $1 70 to $1 75,
and closed at the top figure. For three
consecutive days Leiter has bid the
price up to $1 75 at the close.
A week ago the short interest was
over 1,000,000 bushels. It is now less
than 400,000 bushels. In seven days
Leiter has had about 900,000 bushels
cash wheat delivered him on May con
tracts. He has also bought 500,000
bushels cash stuff, paying within 3
cents to 5 cents for May, to keep it out
of the hands of the elevator people and
the shorts.
His expenditures for cash wheat the
past three weeks have averaged $200,
000 a day, and he is loaded with more
high-priced wheat than at any time
during his fifteen months' bull cam
paign. It is expected there will be a
number of defaults on May contracts
for New Yorkers and foreigners. There
are only 1,500,000 bushels of contract
wheat in store here, all owned by Lei
ter. Tuesday 300,000 bushels will be re
ceived, as it is being rushed in from
the country in, time for the last day.
Trading has been carried on in May
wheat since last July, when it sold at
77 cents. That was the low point. It
did not get above $1 until February.
Since then it has ranged between $1
and $1 85.
There was a reaction two weeks ago
to $1 35, but for the past three days
prices have held around $1 75, or nearly
Jl above the low point. Letier's larg
est holdings were bought around 90
cents and many of them below that
figure. Within the past three weeks
he has been forced to raise his average
by buying large quantities in the vi
cinity of $1 50.
"When May is all cleaned up," said
Joseph Leiter the other day, "we will
have handled 40,000,000 bushels." This
wheat has been merchandized at a
profit, so far as they have gone. Sinre
September 1 there have been between
25.000,000 and 30,000,000 bushels cash
wheat merchandized, the greater part
of which was sold abroad, all of it at a
profit.
In one instance it paid over 5 cents a
bushel. How much he has left is known
to no one but Leiter. It is estimated
at from 5,000,000 to 15.000.000 bushels
Most of It is either afloat for Europe or
in store there, the stock here being
about 1.500,000 bushels. He has a little
in the Northwest and some at the sea
board, but the greater part of his hold
ings are in transit.
The wheat trade of the world has
never seen anything like the extended
operations of Joseph Leiter, and prob
ably never will again. They were made
possible only by the shortage in the for
eign wheat cron.
Leiter. with $30,000,000 at his com
mand, and without any speculative ex
perience, was able to cope with exist
ing conditions and to take full advan
tage where an older operator would
not have dared to. He operated on the
theory that the consumption would
overtake the supply and that higher
prices would surely result. There have
been times within the past two months
when the conditions didn't look any too
favorable, but as he controlled the
greater part of the cash wheat in all
leading markets and operated heavily
about, he was finally able to start
things his way.
The war coming on created a rush
for supplies among foreigners and add
ed over 75 cents a bushel to the price
of wheat. One feature of Letter's ope
rations was in his borrowing money.
There was never a time when he did
not have a sufficient supply, but he be
lieved that in arranging for it it was
good policy to get about double the
amount that he was likely to use. This
enabled him to enlarge his operations
and carry his point.

IVORY TURNED YELLOWâ J. F. S.,
City. Ivory that has turned yellow may
be -whitened by washing several times a
day with soap and exposing in the sun
to dry- A solution of sulphurous acid
will also restore the whiteness, but the
use of these on piano keys would be a
dangerous experiment by one not pro
ficient. If the keys of your piano have
become yellow with age, better send for a
person competent to restore the color
than attempt it yourself. It will be
cheaper in the end.

LADRONES-C. N., City. The La
drones, or Mariana Islands, are a group
of about twenty islands, the northernmost
of the Australasian group. They were
discovered by Magellan in 1521. who
named them Ladrones on account of the
thievish propensities of the natives. They
were afterward called the Lazarus Isl
ands, and then the Mariana Islands by
the missionaries who settled in 1667. The
largest of these islands, which are west
of the Philippines, is Guajan.
NATIONALITY OF SOLDIERSâ S. E.
G., City. There are no exact figures of
the nationality of the soldiers who en

of the adjutant-general of the United
States army asserted some time since
that no official compilation of nativity
had ever been made. That being the case
the exact figures cannot be given.
DIVORCE AND PROPERTYâ D. E. P.,
City. The law prohibiting the marriage !
of a divorcee in this State within a year â 
after the granting of the divorce was ap- j
proved February 25, 1897. If a person i
was divorced after that date and was
married within a month after that dl
vorce, the marriage is not only void, but
the divorcee is liable to prosecution. If
there is any community property at the j
time of the divorce that is settled by the
court before the decree is signed. After !
the divorce the former husband and wife
are in law, strangers to each other, and ,
neither has any rights in the property of
the other.
WHAT UNES OF (fa WHAT
ARE *v& ARE
ARE YOU ASHAMED OF THEM?
Nearly every man has "a skeleton in the closet." Have you one? The tell-tale signs are often
seen, but sometimes there is little to go by. Take the eases of those men who have to acknowledge to
themselves that they have lost most, if not all, of their vital force. Some look worn and tired; their
cheeks are drawn; they are depressed and full of gloomy thoughts; their knees shake and they have
spots continually before their eyes; they get giddy. All these are certain signs of weakness. But
there are men who look quite healthy and happy who are in reality weaklings and puny mortals.
They have their "skeleton" nevertheless. But both of these classes of half-men crave for full
strength and power. They long to be as perfect men as they once were. Many men ask, "What has
brought me to such a state that life is a burden instead of a pleasure?" There is the "skeleton."
You may have overworked; you may have been guilty of follies in youth; late hours and burning the
candle at both ends may be responsible. One thing is certain, and that is that in some way you have
abused some gift of nature. You were full of grand strength once, but you have wasted it in some way.
Knowing that the damage has been done, the only sensible thing to do now is to strive to repair
it at once. When properly treated nature will again reassert herself. Think of it for a moment.
You can become a great and a grand man again. Life will again be full of pleasure. The rich,
warm blood will go bounding and dancing through your system, as it did in the olden days.

ANOTHER CALL F^OR
VOLUNTEERS COMING.
XEW YORK. May 2S.â A Chicago special to the Herald says: An-,
other call for at least 100,000 troops is coming as soon as the .0,000
called for can be organized and equipped. Information to this effect,
apparently authentic, is coming to Chicago and other sources.
Before Governor Tanner left the city he told a friend that he was
almost ready to hold up his right hand and swear that this would be
the case.
"I am informed from Washington," he said, "so directly that It al
most comes from President McKinley himself, that the troops will be
called out until there are 500,000 ready for action. This will be done
to prevent any possible interference by European powers, and to make
the nation ready for even the i'nvaslon of Spain itself. The reason
why more are not called out at this time is that the contractors and
the Government are not in shape to equip them."

THE VICTORY
Irishmen Show Their
Love for America.
TRUE PATRIOTISM IS SHOWN
VERY FEW CATHOLICS IN SYM-
PATHY WITH SPAIN.
J. J. Clancy, M.P., The Call's Special
Correspondent in Ireland, Gives
a Review of Recent
Events There.
Special CorrÂ«apondÂ«no* of ThÂ« Call.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
LONDON, May U.â The detailed ac
counta of Admiral Dewey's great vlo
tory at Manila, which appeared in the
Irish papers early in the week, were, It
need hardly be Bald, read with the most
Intense eagerness and the greatest de
light In Dublin and throughout the rest
of Ireland. The Irish people had been
almost feverishly waiting for a con
firmation of the first telegraphic an-
nouncement of the victor}', the more so
as It seemed to be unaccountably de
layed, and when at last it came it was
a relief and a source of joy. The same
may be said of the great majority of
the Irishmen in London and England.
Another circumstance which has
caused much satisfaction among
Irish Catholics, who, of course, consti
tute the great majority of the popula
tion of Ireland, is the declaration of the
Catholic Bishops of America. The or
gan of the independent or Parnellite
party, the Irish Daily Independent, de
voted a day or two ago a si ar
ticle to the subject, and made most ef
fective use of the declaration against
that very small minority who, because
Spain is a Catholic country', sympa
thize with her on that account, for
getting that there are nearly as many
Catholics in America as in Spain and
more than twice as many Irish Catho
lics as there are In Ireland itself. Irish
men are now looking with the most in
tense anxiety to the battle which ap
pears to be impending in the Atlantic,
and the most fervent hopes are enter
tained that not only the American fleet
may triumph, but so decidedly that a
Epeedy end may be put to the war.
We have been all the week engaged
in the House of Commons in a debate
on the clauses of the local government
bill for Ireland, but the debate has, for
the greater part, been concerned so
much with details that American read
ers would scarcely be obliged to me for
dwelling on its various points in suc
cession. One subject, however, of gen
eral Interest came under discussionâ
that of the bribe held out to the Un
ionist or Tory majority in Ireland to
accept the measure and make the best
â¢if it. That bribe, as I have explained
before, is the payment out of the im
perial grant of Â£730,000 a year to Ire
iif the local rates, to which the
landlords are at present liable. This
payment was opposed by the English
Liberals and by one Irish member â Mr.
Michael Davttt. Both opposed it for the
same reason â namely, that the land
lords deserved and ought to get noth
ing. Mr. Davitt, of coarse, is perfectly
sincere. He is the son of an evicted
tenant; he knows what the unrestricted
power of landlordism accomplished in
the past, and he has vowed everlasting
vengeance against the whole class. It
may be doubted whether the same can
be said of the English Liberals. They,
In fact, are acting in this matter the
part of the dog in the manger. They
have not been able to do anything for
Ireland in the shape of reform them
selves, and they would, if possible, pre
vent their British rivals from doing
anything either. The answer to both
was at once given, and It was conclu
sive.
It was that the relief to the landlords
was an essential condition of the con
cession of local self-government, and
that, that being so, the condition must
be accepted. The truth is, that the
price paid for this boon and its certain
consequences Is a small one after all.
Those consequences are even more im
portant than the measure itself, for it
will certainly lead to home rule in the
larger sense. The mere introduction of
the bill has already alienated from the
present government almost every sup
porter of theirs In Ireland, and here in
the House of Commons I really believe
that the opinion entertained by Irish
Unionist members is that, after this
bill has passed into law, home rule can
hardly have any terrors for the Irish
minority.
Last night there was a debate in the
Commons on the subject of the distress
In the west of Ireland, and at one point
It appeared likely to lead to a "scene."
The Chief Secretary's unhappy "cham
pagne" speech was the cause. In a
former letter I explained all about that
somewhat callous deliverance, and told
how It had aroused feeling in Ireland.
The curio-us thing is that it seemed to
have aroused somewhat similar feel-
Ings in England among the political
supporters of Mr. Balfour, and yester
day one of them â Major Raseh, a high
anil dry Tory â openly assailed the
Chief Secretary. The latter was pale
with rage. He admitted, however, that
he had made a mistake. He defended
what he had said as strictly true and
as meaning nothing mere than that
there were some things which the Gov
ernment could not do for the distressed
people; but he added that he ought to
have known that the power and habit
of" misconstruction were great, and that
he ought, accordingly, to have avoided
the use of equivocal expressions. This,
no doubt, was a plausible excuse; but,
after .ill, the spirit which dictated such
a raying as that the Government could
hardly be expected to supply the peo
ple of the 'â¢â  â  â¢ â -â  â ; Of Ireland with cham
pagne can hardly be called sympa
thetic. Moreover, while he showed that
r the accounts of the distress in
particular cases were exaggerated, Mr.
Balfour admitted that the distress in
many parts of Western and Southern
Ireland was very acute. Indeed, he j
went further, for he admitted that !
there were many cases in which the ]
Government ought to and would have
given relief but that outside charity
had Intervened and saved him the ne
cessity. This was virtually a confes
sion of deliberate neglect of duty, for
it showed that, instead of doing his
duty, he waited until he had seen
whether others who were not respon
sible would do his business for him.
The worst of it from his point of view j
to that, according to his own further
admission, he would have had no diffi
culty in obtaining from the treasury
any money for the relief of distress for
which he had chosen to ask.
A very interesting reunion of Irish
men took place in London this week,
of which no account, by the way, has
appeared In the papers. I refer to a
dinner In the Grand Hotel of Trinity
College (Dublin) men In England. Mr.
Leeky, M. P. for the University of

sponded to the toast of "The Quests of
the Evening," and, without trenching
either on politics or religion, made
some significant allusions which evoked
a response, rather notable for such an
assembly. It being well known that he
was both a Catholic and a Nationalist,
he took occasion to say that Irish
Catholics could have no hostility to the
great Irish Protestant University, see
ing that it had opened its doors to
Catholics nearl- three-quarters of a
century before any English university
had taken that ::tep, and that it had
produced such Nationalists as Grattan,
Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone. It
might be thought that the mention of
such names would have looked a mani
festation of hostile feeling or at least
would have been received in chilling
silence by a gathering, most of whom
belonged to the Irish University; but
the fact is that it was met with a burst
of hearty cheering, which largely came
from the clerical element to which I
THE EMPORIUM. |
have referred. It would be easy, in
deed, to exaggerate the significance of
such an incident, but it is not going too
far to say that, like many other things,
it indicates the gradual birth of a new
state of things in Ireland. Classes and
parties are drawing together there
slowly but surely, which have long
been separated; and, in my opinion, it
is impossible to exaggerate the extent
to which that change may go within
the next few years or the consequences
by which it may be attended.
The career of Mr. Carson, to whom I
have just referred, is worth a word or
two. A few years ago he was but
what is called a rising Junior at the
Irish bar, and seemed likely to follow
the usual path trodden by the average
Irish barrister who is to any extent
successful. He was taken up by Mr.
Arthur Balfour when the latter became
Chief Secretary, and figured largely as
prosecutor for the Government in the
Coercion Courts. He became a Queen's

ThjE SfWOR OF TREASON.
YEARS ago the Examiner was thrown into the
street because of treasonable utterances. The
taint of the old malign spirit seems to linger
with it. still. It is a menace to peace and order.
Just at present that sheet, with the shameless per
fidy which marks its course habitually, is trying to stir
up revolt among the troops stationed at this point. It
says they are ill-fed and that they are on the verge
of mutiny. It says this in the hope of stirring up a
sensation, and caring nothing for truth or for the dig
nity of the army or the honor of the country. Its
statement is a slanderous lie, and every soldier resents
it as an insult.
The troops have been well cared for in the matter
of food. Soldiers do not expect to have the privilege
of training on pie, and yet considerable pie has been
added to their bill of fare here. Government rations
are not luxurious, and to some may not at first seem
palatable. In every company there are grumblers.
So has it ever been. The Examiner has chosen for
its own evil purposes to take the word of these
grumblers, to magnify their statements and spread
broadcast the report that the soldiers are ready to
de-sert the standard.
Perhaps there is no way in which the Examiner can
be suppressed, but for the protection of the army, for
the good of discipline and for the interests of decency
it should be barred from every camp and forbidden to
circulate where the shadow of the stars and stripes
falls upon valiant men and patriots. To all such men
it is an affront..
PROMOTION IN THE NAVY.
AMONG the features of the naval personnel bill
now before Congress which will most effect
ively tend to improve the service is the clause
providing for the establishment of a new grade of
commissioned officers, to be known as chief boat
swains, chief gunners, chief carpenters and chief sail
makers, to rank withâ but after â ensigns, and to
which warrant officers shall be eligible.
The object of the clause is to provide a way by
which enlisted men may attain commissions in the
navy. As at present constituted our naval service is
one of the most aristocratic and exclusive on the
globe. It might, in fact, be called unAmerican, so
thoroughly does it deprive the seaman of the Ameri
can right or privilege of rising from the humblest
to the highest rank of employment. In the British
navy, even in the old oligarch days when the Georges
ruled, there was an open way by which the poorest
cabin-boy could make his way to the rank of an ad
miral, and during the long wars of those times a con
siderable number of bold boys did make their way to
rank through this "hawse hole," as it is called. No
such advantage has been enjoyed by the American
sailor lad who entered the navy lacking the advantage
of an appointment to Annapolis, and it is to remedy
this defect that the new set of omce3 are devised.
The opening provided is by no means a wide one.
The bill expressly states that the new- commissioned
offices are to be open only to warrant officers, and
erfc-tiiey are not to be eligible until ten years after
the date of their warrants. It is not easy for a lands
man to understand why this long wait should be re
quired. It would be hard to deprive an Annapolis
cadet of the right of promotion until ten years after
the date of his graduation, nor would it be considered
fair to require him to remain an ensign ten years be
fore he could receive a higher rank. To outsiders it
will seem equally hard and unfair to deprive a war
rant officer of the right of promotion to .. commis
sioned rank until he has served ten years from the
date of his warrant.
It was a frequent saying of Napoleon ih.-t his mis
sion in the world had been to open a way for
talent and give the tools to those who could use them.
It is strange that the navy of the United States should
be one of the last in the world to accept the teaching
of that great apostle of democracy and war. The way
that is to be opened for the talent of enlisted men in
the navy should not be hedged in by ten years' re
strictions. When an enlisted man has shown his
ability to use the powers of commissioned rank he
should not be made to wait a fixed number of years
before the powers are given him.
Promotion should not only go to merit, buj it
should go as soon as the merit is known and the
need calls for the man. The new bill makes a de
sirable change and is to that extent acceptable, but
the change is far from being adequate to the require
ments of the service or the virtues and patriotism of
the American sailor boy.
Apparently ex-District Attorney Page does not
think three straight convictions enough to go to the
penitentiary on.
TME ELUSIVE METERS.
SOME time ago ex-Supervisor Burling, a gas
manufacturer of experience, explained that a
good way to make a gas meter register more
than it ought was to pump air into the pipes. Mr.
Burling did not charge anybody hereabouts with
doing this, but he declared that the process was
practicable and had been tried with success by un
scrupulous gas manufacturers in other portions of
the country. According to this, all a gas company
need do when shy of dividends is to rig an air pump
at the main factory. With that instrument it can in
crease its receipts ad libitum.
This cheerful information for gas consumers is
now supplemented with an equally enlivening point
for the patrons of the electric companies. At a meet
ing of the Finance Committee of the Supervisors on
Friday an electrician said that there were over a
dozen methods for making electric meters register
faster than they should. One of the cheapest and
easiest, he explained, was "to weaken the magnet of
the meter by supercharging the wire from the power
house with an extra voltage of electricity." Another
electrician gave the committee a practical test of
how a meter may be made to run fast by bringing
its mechanism within the influence of a powerful
electro-magnet. By this means he increased the
speed of the meter 21 per cent.
All this must carry joy to the souls of consumers of
gas and electricity in San Francisce. In one case air,
which is the cheapest thing on earth, may be utilized
to raise gas meters all over town, and in the other a
simple change in the speed of a dynamo at the power
house may produce a similar effect upon electric
meters. Of course nobody is charged with employing
these devices hereabouts â although if is a fact that
the discussion before the Finance Committee was
brought about by the discovery that the electric
meters at the City Hall are "fast" â but why should
consumers of gas and electricity in this town be. con
signed to the tender mercies of the corporations en
gaged in the manufacture of those commodities?
Perhaps the gas and electric manufacturers, like the
Roman Senators, are all honorable men, but the un
certainty which accompanies this assumption must be
a constant source of worry.
The Supervisors should employ somebody to look
after these elusive meters. The city now has a gas
inspector, but he is an ornament and of no use. Why
not set an electrician and gas expert upon the track
of the meters? If the people are paying for "extra
voltage" in electricity and wind in gas they certainly
should know it. They will not only be more com
fortable when the truth is imparted to them, but a
tremendous load may be lifted off the consciences of
the men who are running the various gas and electric
companies of this city.
THE COMPETING ROAD.
I~*HE celebration of the arrival of the Valley Road
at Bakersfield signalized the accomplishment of
an industrial victory for California of great
magnitude and far-reaching importance. It was an
event which justly engaged the attention of the whole
State. Among the speakers whose voices were elo
quent in its commemoration were orators not only
from San Francisco and the San Joaquin, but from
as far south as Los Angeles.
The circumstances under which the road was un
dertaken and the means by which the enterprise wa9
successfully launched and pushed to completion can
never be too often recalled. The subject contains a
lesson of supreme importance to the people of Califor-
nia, and the moral is full of encouragement to all who
seek the commercial and industrial advancement of
the State and the complete emancipation of its peo
ple from the excessive burdens of transportation mon
opolies.
When Mr. Claus Spreckels and his colleagues be
gan to give action and movement to the construction
of a competing road the whole United States was
suffering from the effects of a financial panic of ex
treme intensity. The normal energies and industrial
activities of the people were locked in the paralysis
of hard times. Few capitalists were willing to engage
in any form of business involving a large outlay of
money, and in the great financial centers of the nation
almost anything in the form of new railroad building
was regarded either as something not worth consider
ation or else as something which could be considered
only a gambling speculation or a wildcat scheme.
Such was the condition of the financial world at the
time that, although the promoters of the road were
men of the highest credit, they could obtain no money
from abroad. They knew at the outset that whatever
they did would have to be done with home capital.
This fact, it will be remembered, led Mr. Huntington,
a great negotiator of railroad loans, to scoff at the
enterprise and say of it, "It is a toy road; they are
raising money for it by popular subscription."
The openly expressed contempt of the great mag
nate of the Southern Pacific for the new enterprise
may have had its effect in New York and London,
but it had none in San Francisco. The money re
quired to begin the work of construction was ob
tained without difficulty as soon as the large subscrip
tion of Mr. Spreckels was made known. The enter
prise moved at once, and from that time has gone
steadily forward until now the whole reach of the val
ley from Stockton to Bakersfield has been relieved
from the domination of the Southern Pacific monop
oly and secured in the advantages of a competitive
transportation system.
It is safe to say Mr. Huntingtor no longer regards
the Valley Road as a toy, nor will he ever again
speak contemptuously of San Francisco financiering.
He has learned the lesson of what can be accom
plished in the way of great enterprises when led by
the right leaders and supported with the full force of
local energy and capital. The people also have learned
that lesson.
The Valley Road stands as an enduring witness to
the efficacy of self help. Moreover, it is a living wit
ness whose growth is not yet complete. The road
is even now moving westward to San Francisco, and
already the people of Los Angeles are making plans
to obtain its extension to that city. What has been
accomplished is but a part of what is to be accom
plished. Undertakings of this kind go further than
was at first intended, and it may yet be seen that what
was designed as a road down the San Joaquin may
prove to be a portion of a through route across the
continent.
A woman charged with vagrancy was dismissed be
cause she proved to the Judge that her son fought
with Dewey at Manila. Perhaps this was not strictly
in accord with law, but there will be no carping critic
to raise a row about it.
The burglars who visited the premises of Senator
Billy Mason have no respect for military dignity. Or
perhaps they did not realize that Mason was a war.
Once more comes the announcement that European
powers will not interfere. It is always sure of the
greeting given an old friend.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1898.
GIVE THE BOYS UNIFORMS.
THE fact remains that after all that has been said
there are soldiers in camp in this city not pro
vided with uniforms. Perhaps they can parade
without them, but in all probability they would feel
more like doing so if they had decent raiment. Cer
tainly a call to active duty would embarrass them.
I'atience has been exhausted in waiting for Uncle Sam
to act.
For the State of California to supply the needed
uniforms would be an excellent idea. In due time the
expenditure would be made good by the General
Government, and even if it should not the loss would
be a small one and easily to be borne. California
people are anxious to do all they can to add to the
comfort of the volunteers, and by no single act could
sthey do so much as by clothing the brave boys the
Governor of Kansas permitted to start out unpre
pared. There is naturally a lack of precedents cover
ing the matter. The suggestion that this action be
taken must be unaccompanied by any suggestion as to
the precise method, but there is an abiding faith that
if Governor Budd were to attempt to provide uniforms
for the regulars quartered in this State a way would be
opened, and in due time a way would appear by which
the money would be returned.
California feels an interest and takes a pride in the
soldiers who are here. There is general regret that
they have been neglected. Cannot this great State do
something for them?
THE SPANISH SILVERISTS.
IN the debate in the Cortes on Thursday the Mar
quis de Vilaverde announced that the "silverists"
in the chamber would oppose the impost on the
public debt, which we suppose to be a tax on the
national bonds. The Marquis further declared that
this opposition would go to the extent of obstruction
of the measures of war finance.
If the impost under discussion be a proposition to
tax the national bonds, from an American standpoint
it is unwise, and the silverists have the verities of
financial science on their side. But what are the sil
verists? Do they constitute the analogue of our free
silver party? It is hardly conceivable that they do
and at the same time have the sense to oppose a
proposition which would further cripple Spanish
credit by taxing its paper evidences.
It is a bit odd, though, that in the Cortes and our
Congress the silver party should appear as obstruct
ors of the war revenue measures of each nation.
Spain is sitting like a scared mouse and we roach
our back like a cat ready to spring upon the prey
while the Hispano- American silver party has it out in
a joint jawbone chorus.
The two Governments have already exchanged
prisoners. Why not exchange Stewart for Vilaverde?
We don't like Spain and wish to hurt her, while we
are too big to be hurt by the trade.
The incidents passing in the Cortes and in Con
gress set in motion an interesting train of reflections.
War is a purely scientific affair. Chemistry and math
ematics determine which side wins in modern war
fare. No nation that can help itself goes into war
now with muzzle loading flint locks and the old style
artillery. The strongest country could not win a
campaign now with the batteries and muskets that
Napoleon used. They would be no more effective
than the catapults of Caesar or the spears and short
swords with which Alexander carved and cut his way
from the Morea to the Ganges. It is passing strange
that while men recognize the necessity which com
pels a resort to science in the mechanics of war,
those are found who reject utterly all the conclusions
of science in the finances of war.
The fiatists in Congress tell the country straight
faced that it can fight with one hand and lift itself off
the ground by the seat of its financial trousers with
the other.
They insist that it is more economical to buy the
necessaries of war and pay armies and navies with a
promise to pay than with cash.
Science and experience teach the economy of
cash in hand. No rate of interest needed to secure it
can ever be as great as the discount on a promise to
pay that has no redemption in sight.
THE MANTLE OF CHARITY.
THERE is no hesitation in giving money to the
noble cause represented by the Red Cross. To
alleviate the inevitable suffering of the boys at
the front is a project appealing to everybody. But
there are others to whom charity will be glad to ex
tend a hand, and these are the women and children
j left without providers. It is true that the great bulk
of the volunteers are unmarried, but some of them
leave families. Many among them have mothers or
I aged fathers who in some measure depended upon
them. The wage of a soldier is nothing. The pittance
he receives will be of little avail in caring for any's
wants but his own imperative ones. He will at best
be thousands of miles away. Those who have leaned
upon him fcr- support will miss the sturdy arms.
There is a movement started for the aiding of these
dependents, and it will appeal to all with almost the
force that the needs of the volunteers themselves have
done. When the boys have all sailed away, accom
panied by stores of comforts, with nurses, medicines
and delicacies, with funds for the purchase of more
when need shall arise, there will be among us many
who will require help. It will freely be given.
Whether as a branch of Red Cross work or as an
independent scheme, the people will be ready to assist
all whose demand for aid is based on the fact that
their boys are absent to fight the battles of their
country, and perhaps never to return.
While the country is calling for soldiers it would be
a reflection upon the national patriotism if the second
call should in part have to be devoted to completing
the number asked by the first call. There are confi
dent estimates that the United States could put ten
millions of men in the field, and these estimates do not
go well with the cold fact that some of the States
have failed to fill the modest quota required of them.
The present fashion in telegrams requires an intro
duction explaining that the message is on "good au
thority" and a finale explaining that it "totally lacks
confirmation." To get an idea that he is learning all
about the war one must begin in the middle of the dis
patch and stop without having reached the end.
There is a tendency to discredit the report that
Schley sent a challenge into Santiago de Cuba to Cer
vera. The absence of Cervera from that point would
have made the act one of peculiar difficulty.
According to Rivera, Americans are deceived when
they think their flag is ever to fly over the Philippines.
Rivera has the usual Spanish prejudice against accept
ing the truth.
There seems to be no reason for placing any confi
dence in the insurgent leader Aguinaldo. He has
proved himself a purchasable" rascal, and is, in all
probability, still for sale.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
There seems to be no doubt that
General Merritt is to marry a Chicago
girl, and that she is in all respects a
charming person nobody has inclina
tion to deny. Announcement of the
coming event has been made in t-o
many papers that even the fact of its
publication in the Examiner cannot
cast over it that uncertainty which
naturally clusters about any statement
made there. The relation of the man
ifold attractions of the prospective
bride, however, leaves the reader in a
state of indecision. She is described
by the correspondent who projects ra
diance into the Examiner, thus: "Miss
Williams is a tall and pretty blonde."
But as the article proceeds confusion
arises. The writer in his enthusias
tic admiration for the lady finds < c
casion for describing her again, and
does it in the following terms: "Miss
Williams is a brunette, graceful and
petite, but of striking appearance, with
jet black hair and eyes." Happy old
warrior! For a Chicago girl to be a
blonde in one paragrnph and a bru
nette in the next would in itself stamp
her as possessing remarkable qualities,
but to be both tall and petite manes
her as a wonder.
While not of a suspicious nature, a
fear arises within me that the removal
of the soldiers from the Presidio to the
Bay District is the outward and visi
ble token of that reprehensible thing
known as a job. There are hundreds
of acres at the Presidio, and if they
are not available for camping purposes
their use is not clear. Rather than
be held for the ocean zephyrs to dis
port in they should be turned into a
pleasure ground or their verdant slopes
, dedicated to the sustenance of the
cow. But the Presidio is at one dis
advantage. It is reached by two car
lines, which have not made any ar
rangement for dividing nickels with the
Southern Pacific. These lines w-ere
garnering nickels fast. The fact was
enough to create pangs in the yellow
building from which the destiny of the
local nickel is ruled. Then the troops
were ordered to the Bay District, to
which access is had only by Southern
Pacific lines. Of course, this may re
a coincidence.

When Grant said, "Let us have
peace," he spoke words destined to be
immortal. Yet nobody thought the
sentiment based on a desire to have
peace at the cost of everything else
worth having. The sentiment of tbe
general found an echo in each Ameri
can heart. It did not imply that ne
wanted the national honor assailed,
while the nation calmly assented. ITe
did not mean that the stars and stripes
were to be trailed in the dust, anl no
sword drawn. He had no thought that
trruchery should be permitted to mur
der our seamen and no cannon thunder
rebuke. For Grant was a patriot srl
dier. I read with astonishment and
regret and even a shade of unfakh
that there is in this country an organ
ization which also says, ''Let us hava
ptace," but says it with craven lips,
and transcribes It with a traitors pen.
If the president of the Universal Peace
Union has, as reported, sent a mes
sage to the Queen Regent, expressing
on behalf of the body he represents
sympathy for the cause of Spain, Mid
deprecating the course of this country
in taking up arms, he deserves to he
hanged. If the organization hidors^s
such an act on his part it is mad? up
of fools and vicious poltroons, who, if
caiight in session, should be driven to
Jail at the point of the bayonet, and
exiled to the benign realm of Castile.
It nay have been observed that in
an Oakland church scandal the princi
pals are going about their pockets
bulging with pistols, and threatening
to blow through the opposition such
numerous bullet ho]f>s that the gospel
of peace may unobstructed percolate
and edify. The idea strikes me as an
excellent one. If half told about the
parties concerned is true they ought to
be shot for the good of the community.
Much trouble would be saved by an
adjustment of these unhappy differ
ences through judicious pressure of the
trigger. Such rows belong in the Po
lice Court, and the easiest way to get
them there would be by pulling weap
ons and doing less talking. So long as
the squabblers continue to gabble some
reporter is sure to overhear, and then
we all get a dose of it while looking
through the papers for legitimate
news. And in the absence of gore it is
not even interesting.
Some months ago the duty of coun
seling the R&v. Bovard to be less ob
noxious came my way and was cheer
fully accepted. I think my remarks on
that occasion did him good, but reform
was not complete. He has not yet
learned to deport himself as beseems
a minister and a gentleman. Lately
he was stirred to the depths of his soul,
a depth I fancy to be inconsiderable.
by a report that Mrs. McKinley had
attended a theatrical performance on
Sunday. The improbability of this, the
certainty that in any case it was none
of the Bovard business, do not appear
to have occurred to him. So he wrote
the lady and made direct inquiry. I
submit that the act was an imperti
nence. It has never come to my
knowledge that Bovard has been ap
pointed censor of Mrs. McKinley's con
duct. If so, he made the appointment
himself and it has never been ratified.
The President's wife, in her gracious
ness, instructed her secretary to reply.
The answer relieved the Bovard dis
tress. He was thoughtful enough to
announce that Mrs. McKinley had not
been to a Sunday s'iow, and thought
less enough to let the public know how
he had ascertained the fact. People
who have a real regard for the church
and respect for the worthy and con
scientious pastors who minister to it
protest against the Peeping Toms of
the pulpit. The Bovard field is widen
ing. Heretofore he had been content
to denounce some worthy women for
the sin of drunkenness, and to spy
through a clubroom, that he might
thunder against the wickedness there,
and paint the iniquity of not being a
Bovard. In my opinion if he succeed
in regulating the morals of the bay
cities he will be doing enough without
reaching his saving tentacles clear
across the country.
When a San Francisco man of wealth

widow is bogus, her tears artificial, and
she would run at sight of a policeman.
A recent instance seems to be of a dif
ferent variety. The extra widow is
genuine enough, but for forty-seven
years she has not seen the capitalist
of her choice. All this time he had
been living here and she had stayed at
her home in the old country, content to
receive a monthly remittance. Mean
while the capitalist had acquired a new
wife, and for decades ) ad seemed to be
a model husband to her. When he
was called to his last account her grief
was genuine and her expectation of in
heritance perfectly natural. Comes for
ward the first wife and opines in legal
phraseology of* great impressiveness
that the dough he left is for the mak
ing of her cakes. lam glad the ad
judication of questions of such deli
cacy does not rest with me. If it did
the old wife would not get enough to
make a riouthful of pastry. A woman
who, for nearly half a century, would
live apart from her husband does not
seem to me to be the true and loving
helpmeet for which he had contracted.
There ought to be a time limit to the
marriage relation when neither of the
parties to the contract lives up to the
terms of the agreement.
The war will lead naturally to the en
larging of the navy. Already it has
shown that in one type of boat the
navy is wholly lackirrg. It has no
transports. Our brave boys are out
somewhere on the Pacific and ..some of
them are packed in the City of Peking,
no more regard having been paid to
their comfort than the packer of sar
dines pays to the fish he jams into a
tin box. Of course the Government
had no reason to anticipate the neces
sity for transports, anfl is not to blame
for having been caught napping. Now
there are in the navy several converted
cruisers, and by having the process of
conversion carried a little further they
would make ideal transports. Here
after there will in all probability be
frequent occasion for taking troops to
sea, and it becomes this great nation
to provide that they go in style.
David Starr Jordan, president of
Stanford University, is a great man. I
never heard of his being approached
on any topic concerning which he did
not have information. It once befell
that I had to interview him as to sea
serpents, and fervid that what he did
not know of the subject was simply
not worth knowing. He is posted on
seals and political economy. He is the
world's great authority on fishes. When
a scientist reaches the stage at which
he is always mentioned by his full
name he is not to be disputed with im
punity. David Starr Jordan has
reached this stage. Fancy the temerity
of mentioning him and leaving out the
Starr or contracting it to an initial!
The thing's impossible. Therefore it
is with misgiving I undertake to op
pose recently expressed views of the
savant of Palo Alto. The president of
Stanford does not think this country
should keep the Philippines. I think
it should, and am sorry to think so, be
cause not to agr< with him is in itself
a presumption and a pain. There are
not many courses open. We must either
keep the islands, give them back to
Spain, make them independent or di
vide them among the powers of Eu
rope. To give them back to Spain
would be a crime so gross that the
mere question of policy is not to be
considered. That the people there are
capable of self-government is a pre
posterous notion, and not to be enter
tained. There is no reason for giving
the islands to the powers, for such a
disposition cf them would win the fa
vor of one power, possibly, but the dis
favor of all the rest. If a matter of
morality is involved, certainly it is no
worse to take by force and keep the
spoil than to scatter it to the equal loss
of the original owner. By keeping the
islands the United States could assure
to them a good government, a bless
ing they have never experienced. Aside
from the value of the Philippines as a
strategic possession, they would be of
utility as affording a field for the youth
of America. The English lad goes to
Asia or Africa. He finds a new outlet
for his vigor. The American lad stays
at home, cultivates the old farm, or
learns a trade at which he accom
plishes nothing beyond the grinding of
his own nose. I am in favor of en
larging his horizon. While it is true
that this country is far from developed,
it is also true that monopoly has such
a grasp upon its resources that a man
with no capital but his hands and his
ambition often finds nothing open to
him but a life of unrequited toil and an
ultimate grave. I believe in giving the
young man a chance. The savages of
the Philippines are worth no more con
sideration than the beasts of the jun
gle. The Spaniards there do not even
merit so much. The time has come for
this great people to reach beyond its
own bounds and accept that which fate
has thrust upon it. I hope to see the
United States with so many colonies
that the sun shall never set on its flag.
This condition would hurt none, and it
would benefit many. Among these col
onies the Philippines will be first and
Cuba will follow. The sooner these
facts shall be recognized the better, for
they are to be the inevitable develop
ments of the near future.
There is a general absence of ten
dency to criticise the President in the
present trying times. If he did find
some weak timber afloat on the politi
cal tide and gathered it in for the con
struction of a Cabinet, he did it before
the signs of war had grown alarming.
Personally I never had any confidence
in Alger, while Long seems to have
been designed by nature for the safe
conduct of a sewing circle. Yet it must
be admitted that Mr. McKinley knows
both of these gentlemen better than it
is the privilege of the country to know
them. I think it, however, no wrong
to fail to see merit in some of the re
cent Presidential appointments, always
bearing in mind that Mr. McKinley is
laboring under the strain of a vast re
sponsibility and that applications back
ed by strong influence are pouring
upon him. There does not seem to me
good reason why the sons of Blame,
Harrison, Hayes, Foraker and other
sprigs totally without military experi
ence or a record of personal worth,
should have been given places. In
deed, some of these young men have in
civil life stamped themselves as below
an average intelligence. And I think
that, so long as civilians were being
called to army duty, for McKinley to
have named Bryan for a position of
trust would have been a gracious
course. At leaust the Nebraskan would
have excited the enthusiastic confi
dence of the men whom he would have
led. But, according to report, no an
swer was made to Bryan's offer, and
his reward was to be called a dema
gogue by papers not accepting his
| financial views. By this the papers be
came the demagogues. Now Bryan has
enlisted as a private, and will for this
act be called more names. I have no
doubt that he will be a good Bojdier,
and fail to see wherein his silver
I scheme cuts any figure. I honor him
j for having enlisted, and hope that even
if he go as a private in the ranks ha
will come back with shoulder straps.

A Busy Day Among
Followers of Fife
and Drum. .
General M. P. Miller, Com
manding Harbor Defenses,
Ordered to Manila.
General Merritt rested a little
while yesterday, but the work of or
ganizing the second Manila expedi- I
tion did not pause. General E. S.
Otis kept straight ahead at the job
and at a late hour last night was
pondering over army returns at the
headquarters in the Phelan building.
W: is regarded now as settled that
General Merritt will take to Manila
on the next expedition the squadron
of the Fourth United States Cavalry
now at the Presidio and the Eigh
teenth and Twenty-third United
States Infantry regiments, due in
San Francisco to-day. The troopers
of the Fourth Cavalry will probably
leave their horses here and get
mounts at Manila. Assurance has
been given that the Seventn Califor
nia Volunteers will go with the next
expedition.
The work of getting the fleet in
shape to receive the troops gains
come impetus under General Merritt't;
direction. The steamship China is
hastily discharging cargo in order
to join the neet without delay. The
Zealandia will be the first ship ready,
as the work of preparation on that
vessel is w.ll advanced. The Colon
will not be far behind the Zealandia.
At lost accounts the Centennial and
Ohio were on the Sound.
Five trains of the Southern Pa
cific bringing 1210 men of the
Eighteenth and Twenty-third United
States Infantry regiments will arrive
to-day at noon. T.ie Southern Pacific
figures that the two battalions from
.North Dakota will arrive here to
morrow. The South Dakota regi
ment is booked to arrive- early in the
vreek, but no date is given.
Jolonel Marcus P. Miller. Third Unit
f I States Artillery, who was recently
raced in command of th ? defenses of
Ban Francisco harbor by order of Gen
eral Merriam, was da^ before yester
day appointed by the President briga
dier general of volunteers. Yesterday
General Miller received orders by wire
ip 'in the Secretary of War directing
him to report to Major General Merritt.
It is clear now that General Merritt is
point? to assign to duty with the second
Philippine' expedition as many regular
officers and so! li^rs as can be spared
from this country. General Miller is
if the ablest officers' in the United
States army. His record for bravery
and judgment on the field of battle is
unsurpassed, and this fact is well un
derstood by General Merritt, as the
two officers were near to each other in
the closing campaign of the Civil War.

Cnmp Richmond yesterday and made an
informal call upon Colonel Berry. The
general inspected the Seventh's camp and
visited the others. His visit had no sig

military matters were not discussed.

The colonels of the variqus commands
are highly indignant over the published

IHE HAWbEKb DEL.iVEI-.ED
The Great Ropes That Will
Tow the Monterey to Manila
Completed.
The twelve-inch Manila hawsers that
are to be used to tow the monitor Mon
terey to the Philippines were delivered to
the commandant of the navy-yard yester
day. The prompt delivery of the great
ropes to the Navy Department was some
what of a surprise to the officers of the
yard, as they were of the opinion that
there was no factory on the Pacific Coast
that was capable of turning out such
hawsers on such short notice. On Thurs
day forenoon the otllceis of the navy
yard, after it was determined to send the
Monterey to Manila, began to arrange for
the towing of the vessel part of the way
to tliÂ© port Dewey had succeeded in
clearing of Spaniards. Large and specially
made hawsers were required. By noon
of that day tiie Tubbs Cordage Company
was asked if such work could be done on
the coast and what time would be re
quired to fill the order. With the inquiry
was a special request to the effect that it
would be a great favor if the hawsers
could be completed by Monday night.
Half an hour later .111 answer was given
stating that the work could be done on
tiie coast and that the hawsers couid be
delivered by 4 o'clock on Saturday. At 2
o'clock on Thursday the order was given
fur the hawsers, and yesterday afternoon
they were delivered. The great ctane at
i.be navy-yaid 111 ted them trom the deck

( o'clock, and as they swung onto the dock
the sailors and marines of the few ves
sels at the yard cheered the manufactur
ers again and again for the prompt re
sponse, to Iho emergency order uuring
these war times.
'Jhe delivery of the hawsers was made
the occasion of an excursion by the em
p.'oyes of the Tubbs Cordage Company.
I'he factory was dosed for the day, and
three tuga were employed to take them
all to the navy-yard and cheer at the
lelivcry of the great ropes that grew out
â¢ t the work of their hands. Each of tiie
three great hawsers measured 1200 feet
11 length, and the weight of each of them
was 5200 pounds. All three of them were
loaded en tiie Reliance, and the Sea
jueen and Sea King carried most of the
employes of the factory. Most of the of

BIG BATCH OF GENERALS.
Deserving Men Who Will
Wear Flannel Abdominal
Bands.
One of the biggest batches of brigadier
generals ever created in one day was sent
to the Senate Friday by the President.
The list embraces many of the deserving,
some of the undeserving and a few of the
useless. It will be noted with special
gratification in the United States army
circles that Marcus P. Miller, colonel of
the Third Artillery- and the officer in
charge of the artillery defenses of San
Francisco harbor, is in the list. A more
deserving promotion could not have been
made. Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace F.
Randolph, Third Artillery, a gallant and
deserving officer of renown, Is also em
braced in the list.
Every new brigadier who Is destined for
service In the Philippine Islands will
doubtless wear the nannel cholera belt
around his ample abdomen. Word lias
b( en passed along the line that the belt
is a good thing for the tropics. Lieutenant
Strother of the regular infantry, who was
recently promoted to major and engineer
officer of volunteers, is said to be a con
vert to the flannel belt. It is suspected
that Major-General Merritt 's advice to
mothers and fathers of volunteers that
their sons in the service should obey
army commands afcd wear the flannel
cloth was given to the press by Lieu-
I Strother in the absence of any
definite military Intelligence. It is a very
clever tactician who can lure a newspaper
man in the quest of news into the accept
ance of a glowing description of a cholera
belt. A man with a genius for this kind
of business ought to be very acceptable
at tin- headquarters of the department of
the Pacific.
A retired colonel of the British army,
who served many years in India, has been
telling Major Edward Field, U. S. A_,
that no soidier should thlnlc of going to
Manila without a cholera belt. Kvery
day for weeks the colonel went to Major
Field's office in the Phelan building to
explain just how the belt should be
made and worn and where the material
could be procured in Calcutta. Of course
International law may construe flannel
for belting brigadiers as contraband of
war. and in that event the material could
not be obtained in a neutral port. Major
Field has all thia information In writing.
and would no doubt supply it on demand
to Major General Merrltt or Lieutenant
Strother. When Major Field was not
in his office the British colonel committed
the injunctions to writing, hence* the ma
jor is in possession of the original manu
script on this important subject.
With duo regard to the military wis
dom of Major General Merritt and the
aggregated military lore of all the newly
h;i tolled brigadiers It may be contended
that our troops for Manila catinot con
form to all the injunctions for the preser
vation of health in the tropical Orient.
The Tiritish colonel tells Major Field that
no soldier can stand exposure to the sun
Tf the Philippines without an umbrella.
He also declares that the ordinary Amer
[ca-n tent would ho useless at Manila, as
'ho sun's heat would instantly go through
It This being the case the men should be
provided with huts and umbrellas. More
iver, Major Field is informed that the
â ;o!dior must wear n long strip of thin
nusliii around the waist to prevent the
cartridge belt from chafiing the skin.
A little reflection must convince one
hat it is impossible to take along every
hing absolutely needed to promote rom
'ort In the tropics, hence there should be
m agreement to take only the absolutely
leceasary articles. The best authorities
iftroo that thf* cholera belt holds thehlgh
â¢st place In the emergency list. The Call's
nformation is that the British colonel
)lncos it first in his ideal requisition.
A cork helmet is another article that is
;a!<l to be requisite for field service in the
Philippines. Major Field was inform". l
hat the real thing In this line could be
>rocured in Calcutta, but this again
>rin:-s up the question of contraband
foof'-. Is a cork hat contraband of war?
Pliat is a question that General Merritt
nay have to refer to his Judge-Advocate,
t was Major Field's judgment that the
British colonel's cork helmet, constructed
md braced as the sample shown at the
building, was not to be compared
vith the light straw hat of American
nanufacturo.
There is a great deal of merit in the
iropositlon that troops should obey the In
unction of the Sanitary Corps and never
;o across the street witnout the flannel

The Work of Outfitting the Sec-

VjqoPotisly Pushed.
Major-General Wesley Merrltt spent the
i greater part of yesterday In consultation
with Brigadier-General Klwel] S. Otis,
I who is to command the second Manila ex
pedition. The plans of the expedition
were thoroughly discussed and the neces
i sary work was mapped out. There Is a
great deal to be done in the way of equip
ping the volunteers, who, above all
things, need a large quantity of proper
clothing, and many of them must be sup
; plied with arms. The worK of equipment
will In itself take considerable time, and
hence the date o. the palling of the trans
ports cannot as yet be definitely fixed.
It Is safe to say, however, that the ex

Captain C. L Hooper, Who Will Take Charge ol
Admiral Deweu's Dispatch Boat,
Captain C. 1,. Ilcoper of the revenue ciitter service and for the past two
years superintendent of construction and repair for the service at this port has
been detached from his present duty and ordered to proceed to Manila and as
sume command of Admiral Dcwey's dispatch-boat, tlie McCulloch.
Captain Hooper is one of the young officers of the service and stands near
the top of his grade. He was appointed an acting third lieutenant In the rev
enue cutter service in ISC4 from the Stale of California, and commissioned a
third lieutenant in ISi;g, promoted to second lieutenant 1868, and to the grade of
first lieutenant in IS7O. Ho was made a captain in IS7O, and has been on duty
continuously on the Pacific Coast for the past twenty-five years.
He has commanded all of the cuttws of the Pacific station, and at one time
spent seven years on the Corwin, which vessel he considers the ablest in the
fleet. For the past two years, in addition to other duties on shore, he has had
command of the entire Bering Sea fie&t. Upon the outbreak of the war with
Spain Captain Hooper was one of the first to apply for active duty afloat, choos
ing for his command the McCulloch. He will sail with the second expedition
for the Philippines, taking with him twenty extra men from the naval force here
for service. Captain Hodgson of the McCulloch, the present captain, having
exceeded the ace limit of command, will proceed to San Francisco upon the a^
rival of hU relief.
I than ten days. Meantime, the troops are
becoming accustomed to camp life and
military discipline, and are being thor
oughly drilled and otherwise put into good
condition for an active campaign in the
Philippines. Up to date there have been
| live troop transport steamers securedâ the
China, the Zealandia, the Colon, the Cen
tennial and the Ohio. The collier Peter
Jebsen (now called the Brutus) may be
able to carry about 300 troops. In addition

| In condition and loading them with sup
! plus will be pushed with the utmost
| vigor, the intention being to have them
: all ready for sailing by the time the vol
j unteers are completely outfitted. l*p to
i the present time the purchase and char
! tering of transports has been done by tha
', Navy Department, but It is intimated that
hereafter this business will be attended
| to by the War Department.
Brigadier Elwell Otis, owing to the rush
i of business Incident upon the arrival of
! Major-General Merritt. was unable to
move his headquarters from the Phelan
! building to Camp Richmond yesterday,
but expects to make the move not later
I than Monday. The quarters for himself
and staff at Camp Richmond are about
completed for their reception. The com
modious-tents are well equipped with fur
niture and conveniences, including tele
phone and telegraphic connections. It is
the desire of General Otis to be located
at the camp as soon as possible, so that
he can inaugurate a strict military disci
pline and have all the troops destined for
the Philippines thoroughly instructed in
their duties.
colonel j. B. Babcock, who arrived on
Friday evening from Florida, yesterday
entered upon the discharge of his duties
as adjutant general on General Merritt's
staff. He is well known in San Francisco,
having served for a long time as adjutant
on the staff of General Shafter, who had
command of the Department of Cali
fornia.
Major E. H. Crowder, who also came j
from the East, will be the judge advocate I
and Colonel Charles McClure will be the
chief paymaster of the expedition.
CALIFORNIA'S QUOTA.
A Ret'Ter Puzzling Telegram
Received by Governor Budd
From Secretary of War.
Governor luidd yesterday received a
dispatch from the Secretary of War stat
ing that it Is estimated that It will require
1076 men to bring the California organiza
tions already mustered in up to the maxi
mum strength, and asking If that num
ber of volunteers could be furnished.
Adjutant-General Barrett, to whom the
telegram was referred, replied in tne af
firmative, adding that many more could
be supplied and that they could be fully
equlpped nnd uniformed at once.
Under the second call for volunteers the
quota of California was figured out to be
1942 men. The call, therefore, for 1076 is
somewhat puzzling. Tt may mean that
the balance of the 1!>-S2 will be required,
after the 1076 have been disposod of In
bringing up the various companies from
84 to 103 men, although to do this it Is
fipured out thnt it will only take 808. Cap
tain Carrlngton, the mustering officer, haÂ«
sworn into the service j339 men up to the
present time.
Adjutant-Genera! Darrett In a later dis
patch to the Secretory of War assured
that official that California could at once
furnish seventeen roippatiles of infantry
and three troops of cavalry, and that ail
were anxious for active service.

Arms To-Morrow.
The Washington volunteers at the Fon

supply of clothing and equipage, and they
expect to be furnished to-morrow with
rifles and ordnance 6tores from Benicla

by the men to mean that they are to be

volunteers are very thankful.

has been appointed by General Merriam
to meet at the camp near Fort Wlnfleld

There will be a general court martial
at the Fontana Barracks, occupied by the
Washington volunteers, next Thursday
morning at 11 o'clock, for the trial of such
prisoner? as may' be brought before It.
The court will be conducted by Major J.
J. Weisenberg, with W. V. Rinehart as ;
iiirige advocate. No serious offenses are â 
"known to have been committed by any I
of the Washington volunteers, and In all
probability the few violators of the mili
tary laws will be let down easy with a
reprimand.
The Sixth California Volunteers, in
camp at the Presidio, have now been
fully supplied with blouses, shoes and
leggings, but as yet they have received,
no hate, and they are in immediate need
of trousers. However, they are being '
equipped as rapidly as circumstances will
permit. They are anxious to receive or- j
ders as to their destination and duties,
and while not expecting to go to the
Philippines on the second expedition, they
hope to be ordered there eventually. There
is some sickness in this command, the
most serious cruses being caused by -pneu
monia. Private Hoffman, of Company D.
who has been very ill with pneumonia, is
slowly recovering, but will be confined to
the hospital for several weeks. Private
Roberts, of Company G. is also a victim
01 this disease, and his oondition is con

NEEDS OF THE RED CROSS.
Donations of All Kinds Solicited 1
for the Boys.
The ladles of the Red Cross Society
are again In need of flannel for soldiers'
bandages, their supply having been ex
hausted by the number they have made
during the past week, yet many more are
They wish to suggest to those ladies
forming clubs for the purpose of making
them at their homes, that material can be
obtained from the woolen mills at whole
sale rates also that natural gray is the
most desirable color, and that instructions
or patterns can be had at the rooms of
the society, 16 Post street.
An article which might be contributed
by those who prefer to make a variety of
donations, is the invalid's slipper of eider
down flannel, several pairs of which have
been sent in by thoughtful ladles. The
manner of making these slippers is most
simple, and they add wonderfully to the
comfort of convalescents, while many
will doubtless find that they already have
the material for several pairs on hand.
A few other suggestions regarding the
articles sent for distribution, and which
add so much to a soldier's comfort, may
not be amiss. All the old magazines or
books consigned to upper closet shelves
will if sent to the rooms of this society,
be sorted, tied into neat and uniform par
cel" for transportation, and help to while
away many an otherwise lonesome hour
for our boys.
Everything In the way of hospital sup
plies are needed, and your family Physi
cian or drufiglst will give you a list of
what these should be.
In making the useful "housewife, so
many of which are required, it is well to
remember that, like its owner, it may
know long hard service, therefore, a
strong dark material Is preferable to the
flimsy, though pretty, lighter silk so many
are tempted to make use of. In furnishing
them with the many necessary articles
which even a man needs when away from
the willing fingers of mother or sister,
bear In mind that the thread should be
coarse linen is preferable, and have a
little roll of both black and white.
Let the needles you quilt into the leaves
of the "needle book" be coarse also; they
are for men's unskilled fingers, and a
darning nerdle and small, soft, ball of
dirning cotton could be added.
Have two sizes of the half dozen safety
pins and three sizes of horn buttons. A.
"row" or two of common pins, not too
small a tiny ball of twine, for a string
occasionally does not come amiss, and it
might l>Â« well if some one remembered
th;it perhajii n man. even, might use a
thimble in .-*ewiug on buttons or darning
his socks, as some will be sure to do. 11
there is a small pair of scissors you do
not need, or a pair you feel inclined to
buy, they will be a vast improvement over
sawing off linen thread with a knife. If
the thread is wound flatly on narrow
cards It will take less room and present a
neater appearance than in balls, whlcn

slit in one end of the card holds the
loose thread, and prevents Its wlnd.nsr

both black and flesh colored court plas
ter, a tube of vaseline, and a p;e c or
oil silk for sore throats. An Indelible pen
cil, or one of some sort, seems indispens
able to a well furnished Housewife, and
a tooth brush is a good addition. Some
of those sent in were even supplied with
chewing gum, doubtless a donation from
a young miss who wished to divide the
comforts of life with others.

been on detached duty with the Montana
National Guard, and is rated among the

service. Lieutenant Hanna, adjutant of
the First Battalion, is a nephew of United

comar.d that not less than three-quarters
of its members gave up positions paying
from $3 DO a day and upward to fight for

DEMAND THE SOLDIERS' NICKEL.
Troops Are Moved From the Presidio to Accommodate
the Southern Pacific Company.
General Merritt has shown his appreciation of the more than kindly
offer of the Presidio and Ferry Railway Company (Union street line) In
placing their cars at the disposal of the volunteers, and comments on the
magnanimous treatment of his troops afforded by the company In the fol
lowing letter:
PALACE HOTEL. SAN FRANCISCO, CAL,., May 27. 1898.
Denr Sir: I am directed by General Merritt to acknowledge the receipt of your
kind letter of this date, offering the free ÃBe of the Presidio and Ferries Railroad Com
pany's lir.Â» to all uniformed Volunteers during the present mobilization, and to say
that this information will be published to the troops.
The General appreciates very much the kindness which prompti this patriotic action
on the part of your company, and he directs me to thank the company through Its
president. Very respectfully,
T. BENTLET MOTT.
First Lieutenant, Seventh Artillery. Aid-de-Camp.
George A. Xewhall Esq., president of the Presidio and Ferries Railroad Company.
A hope was expressed that Mr. Vlnlng of the Southern Pacific Company
would take cognisance of the published offer of the Union street line and
for once in its history imitate an example that would have a tendency to
create a kindly feeling in the minds of the people of the city toward the cor
poration.
The hope, however, seems a forlorn one, as Mr. Huntington's agent not
only refuses the volunteers the free use of his cars the short time they will
remain here, but has succeeded In collecting all the troops, with the excep
tion of two regiments, out in the Richmond District, where the soldiers, in
order to get to and from camp, must of necessity pay their nickels into the
coffers of the Southern Pacific Company, as they alone control this entire
section of the city.
It is considered by the public rather significant that all the troops should
be moved to an out-of-the way place to suit the convenience of the monop
oly, leaving the Presidio, where they rightly belong, absolutely desolate.
The Government, it is claimed, is going to the expense of constructing
water mains in the streets adjoining the camp at Richmond in order to supply
the necessary water facilities, when half the expense would not be necessary
in supplying the Government reservation with the same Improvement.
boats yesterday. The third battalion was
delayed by a wreck near Truckee, and
did not reach here until 11 a. m.
The delay, however, gave the first com
ers ample* time to do full justice to the
hot breakfast provided by the Red Cross
Society, and none of the troops that have
arrived here relished it more, for the
Montana men traveled for three days on
short rations. When the last section
landed they, too, were taken in to break
fust by the ladies, and during the meal
the escort band and the regimental band
of twenty-four pieces alternated in an
impromptu concert for the edification of
the wearers of the crimson cross.
When the last straggler had filled up
on meat potatoes, coffee, bread and but
ter sandwiches, fruit and pastry until he
could hold no more, the entire regiment
assembled and gave three times three
cheers for their entertainers that threat
ened to shake the massive ferry depot
from its foundation.
Passengers to and from Alameda points
stopped to see the Montanans, until there
was almost as great a crowd Inside the
depot as there was on East street. The
men are such giants that few National
Guard uniforms could be used, conse
quently a majority were in citizens' dress
and not as military appearing as some of
the others, but those men can fight.
Preceded by the two bands the com
mand. In charge of Lieutenant-Colonel
Wallace, marched through the gate into
East street at 11:30 a. m. and a moment
later the big cannon in the tower of the
Claus Spreckels building boomed out the
announcement to the people that the
pride of another sister State was march
ing up Market street to join their com
rades in arms at Camp Richmond. Im
mense crowds thronged the streets and
wildly cheered the soldiers, their salvos
being emphasized at intervals of a few
seconds by the thunderous voice of Ihe
Call's artillery.
Up Market street to Golden Gate ave
nue, out that boulevard to Devisadero
street, to Geary and Point Lobos avenue
the regimeiu marched to its camping
ground opposite the main entrance to
Or>d Fellows' Cemetery, where it will be
chartered during its stay in this city.
With the exception of two squares re
served for the Eighteenth and Twenty
third regiments of regulars, near General
B. L. Otis' headquarters, the old Bay Dis
trict tract is now fully occupied, but a
large tract has been secured north of
Point Lobos avenue, two or three blocks
from the main camp, and there the Mon
tana regiment went into camp, and the
North Dakota troops that arrive to-day
will follow.
Although the regiment brought its bag
gage across the bay in the morning, it
was after 4 o'clock when it reached the |
camp, the men being compelled to lie
around in the sand for several hours be
fore they could pitch their tents. By
dark, however, all the tents were up and ;
strict military discipline established. Be- j
sides uniforms and arms, the regiment is
scantily provided with camp and kitchen
equipage, but Lieutenant Neall, IT. S. A.,
soon ascertained what was needed, and in
a few days at most will have the men
made comfortable.

unteers who are quartered at the Fon
tana barracks are putting- in their time
in daily drill and are becoming quite pro
ficient in the manual of arms and field
evolutions. They are very anxious to go
to the front, and expect to be sent with
the second expedition to Manila. Lieuten
ant Colonel Fife, who is in command of
the Washing-ton troops, says that the men
are overwhelmed with contributions of
edibles from the people of San Francisco,
and that the numerous delicacies, such as
cake, pies and so on, are not conducive to
the health of the soldiers, who indulge in
too many luncheons between meals.
Colonel Fife, while appreciating the gen
erosity and attention of San Franciscans
in this respect, does not hesitate to say
that there is "too much of a good thing."
Hereafter he proposes to have all food
contributions placed in the hands of the
commissary, who will see that they are
properly rationed off to each company and
served only at meal time. The only ex
ception will be when delicacies are re
quested to be presented to any particular
man. In that event the recipient will at
once be given the artii -les. with instruc
tions not to eat them except at meal
hours.
Fifty ladies visited the Washington
volunteers at the Fontana Barracks on
Thursday and entertained the soldiers
with songs and recitations.

A GENEROUS GIFT.
Tobacco Freely Distributed to
the Soldiers at Camp
Richmond.
Blnrkwell's Durham Tobacco Company
has won the gratitude of every soldier
and officer in Camp Richmond. Yesterday
the company, through its agent, Herman
Heyneman, distributed to every soldier in
camp a sack of smoking tobacco. This
large amount of tobacco was hauled to
the camp in an immense four-horse dray,
which was decorated with flags and bunt
ing. Mr. Heyneman visited all of the
headquarters, where he was gratefully
and cordially received, and turned over to
each regiment and battalion commander
the tobacco for distribution among the
men. Nearly 3000 pounds were given away
to the soldiers.

GOOD STORIES
BY
MAX MULLER
HERE are some of the recollec
tions of Professor Max Muller,
the greatest of modern philolo
gists, regarding some of the
celebrated people he has met:
One of his earliest invitations
i at Oxford was to meet Thackeray at
: dinner. The novelist was then writing
â  "Esmond." There were only four in
I the party. "We were all very much
| awed by Thackeray's presence, partic
j ularly I, no-t being able as yet to ex
j press myself freely in English. We sat
silent for some time, no one ventured
to make the first remark, the soup was
i over, and there was a fine John Dore
on the table waiting to be splayed. We
were hoping for some brilliant sally
I from Thackeray, but nothing came.
"At last Thackeray suddenly turned
his large spectacled eyes on me and
said: 'Are you go-ing to eat your own
ancestor?' I stared, everybody else
stared. At last we gave it up, and
Thackeray, looking very grave and
learned, said: 'Surely you are the son
of the Dorian Mullerâ the Muller who
wrote that awfully learned book on the
Dorians; and was not John Dore the
ancestor of all the Dorians?'
"There was a general 'Oh, oh!' but
the ice was broken, and no one after
this horrible pun was afraid of say
ing anything. All I could tell Thack
eray was that I was not the son of
Otfried Muller, who wrote on the Do
rians, but of Wilhelm Muller, the
poet, who wrote 'Die Homerische Vor

Colonel First Regiment California United States
Volunteers Infantry.
Forty recruits for the Fourth United
States Cavalry are expected at the Pre
sidio to-day from Chicago.
Assistant Surgeons Straub and Keefer
will arrive in San Francisco from Alaska
to-morrow and report to General Mer
riam, who will very likely assign them to
duty on the Manila expedition.
Sam J. Allen, an old veteran of the
navy is endeavoring to organize a force
of discharged men who are ineligible for
re-enlistment in active service for the de
fense of San Francisco, and calls upon
schule' and 'Die Schone Mullerin,' and
as to John Dore being our ancestor,
how could that be? The original John
Dore, so I have been told, was il Jani
tore, that is, St. Peter, and had no
wife, as some people will have it, or
at least never acknowledged her in
public, though he was kind to his
mother-in-law. All this did not prom
ise well, yet the rest of our little din
ner party was very successful; it be
came noisy and even brilliant.
"Thackeray, from his treasures of
wit and sarcasm, poured out anecdote
after anecdote; he used plenty of vine
gar and cayenne pepper, but there was
always a flavor of kindliness and good
nature even in his most cutting re
marks."
Another, though less frequent, visitor
to Oxford was Tennyson. "His first
visit to our house was rather alarm
ing. We lived in a small house in
High street, nearly opposite Magda
len College, and our establishment was
not calculated to receive sudden guests,
particularly a poet laureate. He stepped
in one day during a long vacation,
when Oxford was almost empty. Wish
ing to show the great man all civil
ity, we asked him to dinner that night
and breakfast the next morning. At
that time almost all the shops were
in the market, which closed at 1
o'clock. My wife, a young housekeeper,
did her best for our honored guest.
He was known to be a gourmand, and
at dinner he was evidently put out
when he found the sauce with the sal
mon was not the one he preferred.
He was pleased, however, with the
wing of a chicken, and said it was the
only advantage he got from being poet
laureate that he generally received the
liver wing of a chicken. The next
morning at breakfast we had rather
plumed ourselves on having been able
to get a dish of cutlets, and were not
a little surprised when our guest ar
rived to see him whip off the cover
of the hot dish, and to hear the ex
clamation: 'Mutton chops! the staple
of every bad inn in England.' How
ever, these were but minor matters,
though not without importance at the

vicinity who are desirous of serving to

time in the eyes of a young wife to
whom Tennyson had been like one of
the immortals. He was simply de
lightful, and full of inquiries about tho
East, more especially about Indian
poetry."
A later glimpse of Tennyson is af
forded at a lunch given by Dean Stan
ley in honor of the late Queen of Hol
land. She had asked that a number
of literary men be invitedâ Tennyson,
Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton),
Huxley and several more. "We were
waiting and waiting, but Tennyson did
not appear. Stanley suggested that
we should not wait any longer, but
the Queen refused to sit down before
the great poet's arrival.
At last it was suggested that Ten
nyson might be mooning about in the
Cloisters, and so he was. He was
caught and he was placed next to the
Queen. The Queen knew wonderfully
how to hide her crown and put every
body at their ease. She took the con
versation into her own hands, and kept
the ball rolling during the whole lunch
eon. But she got nothing out of Ten
nyson. He was evidently in low spirits,
and sitting next to him I could hear
how to every question the Queen ad
dressed to him he answered, 'Yes,
ma'am,' 'No, ma'am,' and at last, by a
great effort, "Ma'am, there is a good
deal to be said en both sides of the
question." He then turned to me and
said in a whisper, but a loud whisper,
'I wish they had put some of you talk
ing fellows next to Regina.' "
Dean Stanley himself, Professor Mul
ler records, not only had no love for
music but actually suffered from hear
ing it. Whenever he could he walked
out of the room where there was music.
He never disguised his weakness, he
never professed any love or admiration
for music, and yet Jenny Lind once told
Professor Muller that he paid her the
highest compliment she had ever re
ceived. Stanley was very fond of Jenny
Lind, but when she stayed at his fath
er's palace at Norwich he always left
the room when she sang.

Gathering and Games
of the Caledonians.
MOST ENJOYABLE OUTING
BHELL MOUND PARK FILLED
WITH A MERRY THRONG.
Â£Tlie Athletic Events Keenly Con
tested and the Dancing as
Usual a Feature of
the Day.
The skirl of the bagpipes in Shell Mound
Park yesterday made it known to all and
sundry that the annual gathering and
games of the Caledonian Club were in
progress. It was the thirty-second occa
sion of a similar kind, and although the
attendance was not so large as in pre
vious years, which was anticipated owing
to too apparent causes, those present
thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
The games started punctually at 9
o'clock in the morning, and were kept
up without intermission until about 6
o'clock in the evening. The competitors
In most of the events were not so numer
ous as in previous years, but what was
lacking in numbers was made up in
enthusiasm. Ex-Chief Angus McLeod, R.
8. Duncan, the efficient secretary of the
club, and Dan McDonald, took charge of
the games and did their work well. There
was no delay and no kicking on the part
of the competitors.
There was no lack of the usual hos
pitality of the club, and First Chieftain
W. Urquhart and William Mitchell, of
the reception committee, made the guests
feel that they had met with a real High
land welcome.
Nothing particularly startling occurred
In the athletic events. Policeman D. R.
Campbell v.-on five first prizes, which en
titles him to the Jacoby gold medal. The
veteran Tom Â»'arroll was suffering from
rheumatism in the knee, which handi
capped him, and Campbell was able to
forge ahead. The dancing by the boys
and girls in Highland costume was a
feature of the gathering, and the first
\\>re carried off by Maggie Bas-
Bett, a pretty young miss, who is not in
ferior in grace and poetry of motion to
I â  ssors, Elaine Telfor and Sybil
â¢ell.
ng the Visitors were Chief EL K.
McLennan of the Caledonian Club, Sac
ramento, and ex-Chiefs Reid and Morri
son, and several others, ex-Presidents Mc-
Nab and Nichols of St. Andrew's Society,
Supervisor Morton. Sergeant Bethel and
many others. Chief Reid of the club was
zealous in looking alter the welfare of
the guests.

SURPRISES
IN COURSING
Sports Lost on Many
Good Things.
HARES WERE FULL OF LIFE
MOVE ON, A 6 TO 1 SHOT, BEATEN
BY CHILI PEPPER.
Dogs That Won and Lost Credits
at the Ingleside and
Union Parks Yes
terday.
The patrons of coursing were well repre
sented yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
The day was all that any person could
desire for an outing, and the hares! Well,
I they did themselves credit. Excepting
! two courses every one :>f the forty-two
â¢ races was a grueler which taxed the Btay
; ing and game qualities of the contestants.
Surprises? Not since the inauguration
{ of the park have there been recorded so
| many upsets to the talent. Dogs that
' were looked upon as dead sure winners
i fell by the wayside, much to the chagrin
; and astonishment of the knowing ones,
who felt burning sensations in their in-
I side pockets.
Eleven strong favorites failed to raise
winning colors, and as a consequence the
hearts of the short end gamblers felt glad
beyond a doubt.
The judging was good with two excep
; tions, namely, the courses between White
Chief and Senorita and Move On and Chill
Pepper. It seemed as if White Chief was
entitled to a decision in the first course,
which was judged undecided, but in the
subsequent course the Chief was hand
somely defeated by his opponent. The
course which created considerable dis
cussion was the Chili Pepper-Move On
contest
The last named dog scored several
points to his credit before Chili got in and
took possession of her game, which she
held, so to speak, well in hand, working
the hare closely for quite a few points,
while Move On was running well up, but
on the outside and off his game. The black
dog finally took possession, and scored
three wrenches to his credit, Chill killing
as the hare turned from Move On to her
line. The judge evidently gave the course
to Chili because of the manner in which
she worked her game at close range, but
the bitch failed, nevertheless, to score
sufficient points to place her ahead of
the dog.
The surprises to the fraternity were in
the defeat of Mystery by Rapid. Terrona
by Fireball, Glen Chloe by Clifton Lass,
Border Valentine by Kill Boy, White
Chief by Senorita, Forget by At Last,
Arapahoe by Precita Girl, McKlnley by
Skyball, Lady Campbell by Myrtle, Move
On by Chili Pepper, Olga by Little Dottie.
The best judges are puzzled regarding
the programme for to-day. The dogs in
many courses are so closely matched that
speculators must use care, otherwise
some hot shortenders will bring about
surprises.
The sapling stake was the first on yes
â  terdays racing bill of fare, and it resulted
as follows:
First ran downâ Statesman beat Iron Duke;

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1898.
LOCAL MUSICIANS WILL
GIVE A GRAND CONCERT
IN AID OF THE RED CROSS
More Than One Thousand Volunteers From Montana
Breakfast at the Ferry and Then March to Camp
Amid Enthusiastic Cheers.
One of the coming events that the la
dies of the Red Cross Society are look
ing forward to with considerable antici
pation is the concert to be given at the
Baldwin Theater next Thursday after
noon under the auspices of the eminent
composer and musician, Fritz Scheel. Mr.
Scheel is doing - his best and exerting
every effort in arranging a superb sym
phony, and expects the public to do the
rest, as his efforts are wholly In the In
terests of humanity and should be re
warded by success. In conjunction with
the rendition of the concert, under his
magic baton, a pantomime sketch by
Mile. Bilar-Morin will given, the by
. FHlar-Morin will be given, the dia
logue of which is to be presented for the
first time upon any stage. The programme
for the concert will be rendered as fol
lows: Overture, Relnecke: prayer. Kuck
en; sea pictures, Tschaikowsky; "Suite
Copelia," Delibes. The rehearsals are be
ing held frequently, and It is now safe
to say that those who attend the con
cert next Thursday afternoon will hear
one of the greatest symphonies ever ar
ranged under the direction of the cele
brated musician. Mr. Scheel has made
requests for special compositions, which
he has decided will be appropriate to in
clude in the concert.
The society is still progressing rapidly,
and financial assistance is assuming great
er proportions as the public Interest is en
gendered daily by the noble sacrifice the
ladies in charge are making- for the boys
that we have sent, and those we antici
pate sending, to flaunt and maintain the
honor of the Stars and Stripes over the
people and the island which we have won
anu whom we intend to protect.
The undercurrent of enthusiasm and
patriotism among the members of the
League of the Cross has at last broken
its bounds. The boys, finding themselves
unable to fight side by side with their
brare comrades on the field of battle,
have concluded that since they can not
go to Manila they can at least remem-
Der those whom they love by aiding and
assisting them through the agency of the
Red Cross, which will be sent on its mis
sion of mercy to the battlefield and the
camp. Company G is. the first to take
up the noble work of assistance, and it
is needless to say their example will be
speedily followed by the other companies.
At Central Park to-morrow (Decoration
Day) they will take their initial step by
giving an exhibition in conjunction with
a well arranged vaudeville â  programme.
The officers in charge are the following:
Captain. E. J. Power; Company D â
Captain, I. D. Dwyer; hospital corps â
Major, J. G. Morrisey.
James Bothwell of Sheridan, Mont., one
of the soldiers from that State, gave to
the ferry Red Cross committee a beau
tiful gold mounted watch chain, made of
sorrel horsehair, for the president of the
city Red Cross, Mrs. Merrill, in thanks
for the favors extended to the Montana j
soldiers by our city. He also presented a I
ring to the president of the Sacrament
society for kindnesses to the Montana
boys.
A full regiment of 1025 men was served
with breakfast by the ferry Red Cross j
ladies yesterday morning. The men. tall,
strong looking, came over in four sec
tions of about 256 in each. The boys in
blue were served with breakfast, con
sisting of sandwiches, cheese, hard boiled
eggs, pork and beans, hot coffee and hot
stew, presented by the Oakland ladies.
Knowing the sanitary value of fresh on
ions, a tender green one was added to
each plate.
After the breakfast, the soldier boys
were presented with flowers from San
Francisco. Oakland, San Rafael and Sau
salito gardens; but unfortunately before
the men were all decorated the supply
ran short. In consequence, and to pre- I
vent a repetition of the shortage, the pub
lic is requested to keep the ferry Red
Cross committee supplied with flowers,
as flowers are the distinctive feature of
Cal fornia s hospitality, and are being es
pecially appreciated by the Eastern sol
oi erS! - fS* v b0 ys Ilke to decorate and
fuh tt$ elr belt v with roses and embel
tk! fl r srun barrels w 'th. calla lilies.
The flowers can be left in care of the
baegage master.
The superb flags of the Montana regi-
ThÂ£l fl' ere nÂ£Â° A decorate with flowers.
Their fine silk American flag was pre
sented to the regiment by the Helena
(Mont.) ladles. Their blue sllk State flag
with the State seal embroidered on it
was presented by the colonel to his regi
ment.
After the soldier boys have been re
freshed, cheers are given for Admirals
Dewey. Sampson, Schley, General Merritt
the colonel of the regiment and the ladles'
of the Red Cross Society. Then to the
sound of music the Doys marcnea out j
B. Stetson usually acts as toastmaster 'â 
at the ferry Red Cross rooms.
Donations of food for the incoming ;
troops were forwarded to the ladles of
the ferry Red Cross committee by the
following: M. "Warren of â¢ the Palace |
Hotel. Mrs. W. Parnell, Mrs. Thorn, the
San Rafael Red Cross Society, Sausalito '
Red Cross Society, Mrs. Manning, Mrs. <
Major Christen, Tlllmann & Bendel and i
a large supply from the Native Daughters

By some mistake the children of the
Humboldt School, who so generously and
patriotically contributed provisions to the
volunteers at the Richmond Camp, were
robbed of the honor. It was wholly
through their efforts that the donations
were received and delivered and the
credit and appreciation which the sol
diers gratefully extended for them is en
tirely due to them. _
The entertainment given by Mrs. Ber
theau at her residence on Vallejo street
yesterday afternoon was both an enjoy
able and financial success. By electrical
appliances a vivid picture showing 3000
soldiers (infantry. artillery, sanitary
corps etc.), was presented on a large
screen erected for the purpose in the
spacious parlors of the Vallejo-street
mansion. The entertainment will be con
tinued to-day between the hours of 1 and
5 o'clock in the afternoon.
Mrs. A. M. Bekeart of this city, who
has in her employ a number of dress
makers, read The Call's appeal on behalf
of the suffering boys from Kansas, and,
laying the matter before the ladies work-
Ing for her. she and they determined to
do what their limited means would allow.
As a result of this determination they
made up a contribution of twenty-four
roasts, an equal number of loaves of
home-made hrf-ad aDd as many pies and
cakes, and adding a box of oranges, sev
eral pounds of coffee and other small arti
cles, th^y went to the camp of the Kan
sas volunteers and delivered their contri
bution, which was accepted with profuse
thanks, and the ladies were given three
loud cheers.
' TABLEAUX AND MUSIC.
Society Crush at Mrs. Eleanor
Martin's Red Cross En
tertainment.
If success is the spur necessary for the
repetition of kindly deeds Mrs. E. Martin
is likely to again place her elegant home
at the disposal of the ladies of the Red
Cross, so magnificent a triumph was the
entertainment given yesterday at the
lady's home on Broadway.
The home, with its spacious rooms and
imposing hall, all conveniently opening
Into one vast apartment, is especially
adapted for large gatherings, and the
tasteful arrangement of the national col
ors added not a little to the brilliant en
semble.
Everybody who is anybody was there,
and, although the crowd was a large one,
the accommodations for all were ample.
In the corridor Caterer Wheeler, who
kindly donated the entire service, was sta
tioned with an efficient corps of watters.and.
cream, cake, lemonade, coffee and choco
late were passed around to all the guests.
The programme was one of unusual ex
cellence, and each and every number was
applauded to the echo.

receive their guests were:
Mrs. Admiral Miller, Mrs. Mayo NewhaJl,
Mrs. Austin Tubbs, Mrs. Schwerln. Mrs.

Liberal Donations.
The Custom-house department of Fede
ral employes is about to follow the noble
example set by the Postofflce letter-car
riers, and early this week will organize
a Red Cross Society. Surveyor Spear will
call a mass-meeting of all his employes
to-morrow evening, and It Is expected
that about $200 per month will be sub
scribed* to the Red Cross fund of Califor
nia, which evidently will be In advance of
most of her sister States in the good
Similar action will be taken in the de
partments under Collector of the Port
Jackson and Internal Revenue Collector
Lynch, both of which offices will be good
for about double the sum mentioned.
It Is understood that Collectors Lynch
and Jackson and their deputies, Jake Step
pacher and E. B. Jerome, will subscribe
a liberal monthly percentage of their sala
ries to the cause. The Appraisers' office
has also been heard from, and among all
the departments in the Federal building â¢
no doubt at least $1200 per month during
the progress of the war will be subscribed ,
and collected.

BUSY YOUNG LADIES.
They Will Look After the Needs
of the Families of the
Volunteers.
On Tuesday afternoon the young ladlee
of this city will meet and organize a so
ciety, whose duty It will be to look after
the families of the volunteers while the
soldiers are in the country's service. The
prime movers are Miss Grace Gorrill,
Miss Irene Baker and Miss Florence
Sharon. It was the intention to have or
ganized in connection with the San Fran
cisco Society doing the same work, but
last night In San Francisco the ladies de
clared that such work must of necessity
be purely local and consequently they de
clined to unite with any similar organiza
tion.
The new Boclety will in no way Inter
fere with the work of the Red Cross
League and will not attempt to minister
to the wants of the soldiers, but will sys
tematically find out what families are suf
fering because of the loyalty of some of
their members and seek to provide adequate
relief. Much enthusiasm is being shown
among the young ladies and there is no
doubt the organization will be perfected
on Monday and will take the first steps
to carry out Its object.
LITTLE ONES TO HELP.
Public School Children Are to

JAMES BURNS.
Ex-Collector of the Port of Kansas City.
Of the men who have occupied positions of public trust in Kansas City, either
by gift of the people or by appointment, none has a more enviable reputation for
ability, honesty and efficiency than James Burns. Collector of the Port of Kansas
City under Grover Cleveland. He lived to the letter the maxim, "A public office
is a public trust," and when he retired ha carried with him the respect of every
one in the communityâ Democrats and Republicans alike.
James Burns has used Stuart's Dyspepsia Tabiets, and he floes not nesltata
to say they have accomplished wonders.
"I suffered with dyspepsia for twenty years," safd Mr. Burns yesterday.
"Never knew what it was to enjoy lifeâ in fact living seemed a burden, as It
does to all who suffer severely with dyspepsia. A few months ago I began taking
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. From the fl-st I felt relief, and now. although I
am still taking them. I feel entirely cured. For the first time in twenty years I
can eat anything I want and suffer no Hi effects from it. \on cant imagine the
pleasure of this unless you have been a dyspepsia sufferer
"I never gave a testimonial for any medicine before, but I feel as if everybody
ought to know of this remedy, and while it is personally distasteful to me to
appear in print in this connection. I feel as if I had no right to shirk the Â°pportu-
nitv to perhaps help some other sufferers from dyspepsia. I have been recom-
mending the Tablets to an my friends. Only recently I took James HLilUs the
father of Father Lillis. down to get some, and I understand he aIBO is being won-
i derfully benefited. I can't recommend it too highly.

La Fevre Creek.
EXODUS TO THE DIGGINGS
PROSPECTORS RACING TO GET
THE BEST CLAIMS.
Large Body of Free Milling Ore Dis
covered by a Herder of Swine
on a Tributary of
Kings River.
Bpoclal Dispatch to The Call.
SELMA, May 28.â There is great ex
citement here in consequence of the
discovery of a gold-bearing quartz
ledge in the mountains northeast of
Selma- The find was made by J. M.
Lowe of Selma. who v.as herding hogs
In the vicinity. Lowe came to town
â¢with samples of free milling ore and
took Cashier Snodgrass of the Selma
Bank into his confidence. Snodgrass
accompanied Lowe to the mountains.
The prospect was so satisfactory that
Snodgrass made several locations on
the ledge and made arrangements for
prospecting on an extensive scale.
In the meantime the secret leaked out
and another expedition started for the
scene. There is now a contest on as to
priority of claim to some of the best
locations. Yesterday the craze reached
fever heat and to-da-' there has been a
continuous exodus In the direction of
La Fevre Creek, and there will be a
race for locations on the rid~<\ where
croppings are traceable for a long dis
tance.
La Fevre Creek is a tributary of
Kings River, and the discovery is on
an abrupt ridge rising from the creek.
It is about two miles south and two
miles east of Trimmer Springs, on
Kings River.
One of the locators took out sixty dol
lars in two days' prospecting. An offer
of $15,000 has been refused for one of
the claims.
OSCAR S. STKA'JSS TO
SUCCEED MINISTER ANGELL
Will Again Hepresent This Govern-
merit at the Court of Ab
dul Hamid.
NEW YORK, May 28.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: 1 have
It on excellent authority that James B.
Angeil, Minister to Turkey, has resigned
from hi 3 position. He will be succeeded
by Oscar S. Strauss of New York, former
Minister to Turkey.
Mr. AngelTs resignation will take effect
Borne time during the summer. Mr.
Strauss will not go abroad until his nomi
nation has been confirmed by the Senate.
This will be Strauss' second commission
to Turkey. President Cleveland sent him
to the Ottoman empire during his flrr-t
term. Strauss made such an excellent
record that President Harrison endeav
ored to keep him in office. Philanthropic
organizations' tried to induce Strauss to
remain, but he did not see tit to accede to
their appeals. The selection of Strauss by
President McKlnley for this important
post is another high compliment to
Strauss' valuable services in the past.
Strauss belongs to a distinguished fam
ily. His brother, Isarior Strauss, was
formerly a Representative* in Congress,
while another brother, Nathan Strauss,
has been a leading figure in me municipal
affairs of New York.
GRAND SThsID FALLS WITH
SCORES OF CHILDREN
Many Boys and Girls Injured in a
Disaster at Denver's City
Park.
DENVER, May 28. â A serious acci
dent occurred at 3 o'clock this after
noon at City Park, by which nearly
a hundred children, ranging in size
from mere babies to 12 or 14 years, were
more or less seriously injured. A tem
porary grand stand had been erected
for Memorial day exercises and on this
1200 children had been gathered for re
hearsal. Suddenly a large section of
the stand gave way, carrying its load
of terrified little ones to the ground, in
some instances a distance of thirty
feet.
Many were caught beneath the fall
ing timbers and about forty were se
verely hurt, while scores were painfully
bruised. Twenty of the most serious
ly injured were taken to St. Luke's
Hospital, while the others were con
veyed to their homes in all parts of the
city. It is not believed that any fa
talities will result from the accident.
REFUSED TO FIGHT.

ing a Ride on a Rail.
SAN RAFAEL, May 28.â Prominent
citizens of this town and many mem
bers of the San Rafael Athletic Club
assembled In the gymnasium of the
club rooms to-night in anticipation of
a rattling bout between Rudolph Groff
man, a local pugilist, and Joe Sullivan
of San Francisco. "When the latter ar
rived he refused to enter the ring in the
face of every fair inducement. So in
dignant were the disappointed followers
of the fistic cult that for a time Sulli
van was in danger of being ridden out
of town on a rail.

band.
Bpectal Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE, May 28.â P. W. Bar
tie, an old resident of this county, shot
and killed Frank Stalker at Bartle
Ranch at 6 o'clock this evening. The
tragedy was the outcome of a family
quarrel.
Stalker, who was the husband of an
: adopted daughter of Bartle, opposed the
â  recent marriage of Bartle to a young
woman and made threats against his
| life. Calling at Bartle Ranch, he as
! saulted the old man, threatening the
while to kill the entire family. See
ing that he was getting the worst of
the encounter, Bartle's wife brought
him a "Winchester rifle from the house.
With this the fatal shot was fired.
Bartle came to town and surrendered
to the Sheriff. He claims he acted in
self-defense, which his neighbors be
lieve is highly probable.

To-morrow members of Grand Army

gray dawn to-morrow little bands of men
wil! go quiotly from mound to mound and
Implant little flags at the graves of de
parted heroes.
As is customary a parade will be held

THE SAIN" FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1898.
JUST A CANTER
FOR ORNAMENT
Order's Son Wins the
Brooklyn.
PILOTED BY TOD SLOAN
LONG PRICE AGAINST THE
WESTERN CRACK.
Game Ben Holliday Staggers in Sec
ond,, a Head in Front of the
Light-Weighted Sly
Fox.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 28.â 1t was more
or less a typical Brooklyn handicap
day. Nature was all tears in the morn
ing and all smiles in the afternoon. The
track was heavy, but it was not a mud
horse that won, for Ornament, who was
fit to run for his life, cantered home a
winner amid the cheers of the crowd.
The crowd, numbering about 12,000,
waited patiently through the first three
races for the handicap, and as soon as
Kingston had won the Expectation
stakes, those who wanted to speculate
so-light the ring. The greatest plunge
was on Don de Oro, the sulker, while
the game little three-year-old Sly Fox
had so many followers that at the close
he was an almost equal favorite with
Don de Oro, and had pushed Ornament
out of the place as second choice. All
the others were nibbled at, but most of
the money was down on the two men
tioned.
At 4:05 o'clock the bugle called the
contestants to the post. After a cou
ple of false breaks, the red flag swished
through the air and the silken jackets
flashed into line. With Ornament a
length behind, they rounded a slight
turn and straightened out on the first
run past the grandstand. As they
neared the Judges' stand the first time
Sly Fox was in the lead by a length,
with Ogden next, two lengths in front
of Don de Oro, Tillo, Ornament, Ben
Holliday, On Deck and Semper Ego fol
lowing in the order named. There was
little change in the position of the
octet as they rounded the lower turn.
As the lot turned into the backstretch,
Ogden, two years ago the Futurity win
ner, had enough of it in the sticky go
ing and fell back into the rear ranks.
The jockeys began bunching a bit at
this point and sent their horses along
to test Sly Fox, for he seemed to be
going easily in front. Don de Oro was
in second place and Sim gave him a
shove to get him a little nearer Sly
Fox, and at the beginning of the up
per turn he was lapped on Sly Fox and
only a neck behind. Tillo also was
lapped on Don de Oro, while Ben Hol
liday was close up, with Ornament
lapped on him. The others were trail
ing and apparently all out.
They were now on the upper turn
and had but three furlongs to go. All
the boys were doing a little urging.
But what of Sloan on Ornament? Sud
denly he leaned far over on his horse's
neck, gave him a little prick with his
spurs and how he mowed the others
down, going like a whirlwind. It was
a streak of cerulean blue silk, a glean
ing chestnut colt, and the crowd
roared :
"Look at Sloan!" . â '
It was unnecessary for any call, for
everybody saw the great four-year-old
Tillo, Don de Oro and Sly Fox passed
like a flash, and in the time it takes
to tell it Ornament was in the lead.
Then the boys got to work in earnest,
but it was a "useless task, aa far as
the first place was concerned, for they
could not gain a foot on the flying Or
nament, who was doing easily in front.
All eyes were then on Sly Fox and Ben
Holliday as they thundered through the
stretch in the effort to secure second
money. - â â,.',-
A furlong from home Ben Holliday
got his nose up to Sly Fox's tail. A
sixteenth from home his nose was
about a foot behind that of Sly Fox,
and in the last few strides Ben Holli
day managed to stagger over the line
in second place by the shortest of
n Â°lfoan was the idol of the hour.
Sloan was the idol of the hour.
There came the proposition to put him
in the floral jockey's chair, which the
jockey on the winner has to undergo,
and to the surprise of everybody he
declined the honor.
Sloan also had the winning mounts

Wholesale House Razed and
Adjoining Buildings
Barely Saved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 28.â One of the
moat disastrous fires which has oc
curred in this city for several years
started this afternoon in the basement
of the wholesale merchandise store of
Crandall, Aylsworth & Haskell, 218 to
224 Los Angeles street, and before the
flames were subdued nearly $200,000
worth of property had gone up in
smoke.
The fire started in the excelsior bins
In the basement of the establishment,
and, owing to the inflammable charac
ter of the stock carried by the firm, the
entire building of three stories was
soon ablaze. A general alarm was
sounded, and after working for over
two hours to quench the flames the
fire department turned its attention to
the adjoining buildiners to prevent a
spread of the fire, which threatened to
consume the entire block. In this the
department was successful, the only
damage incurred other than that suf
fered by Crandall. Aylsworth & Has
kc.ll and E. Gorman, owner of the
building, being a partial loss sustained
bi- the Pacific Crockery and Tinware
Company from water.
The fire was probably caused by
spontaneous combustion, but its exact
origin is at present unknown.
The loss to Crandall. Aylsworth &
Haskell will amount to fully $130,000,
with $50,000 insurance. The building,
owned by E. Gorman, was constructed
at a cost of $50,000. The building was
a total loss and was insured for $20,000.
The loss of the Pacific Crockery and
Tinware Company will amount to
about $5000; insurance unknown.

ahead at the ninth mile, holding the lead
until after the sixteenth mile. During
this period Starbuck led from fifty yards
to one-third of a mile. After the six
teenth mile the chain on a wheel ridden
by one of Starbuck's pacers broke and

OUTCOME OF A DISPUTE.
Photographer Hausler Arrested for
an Assault With a Deadly-
Weapon.
F. O. Hansler was arrested yesterday
and charged with an assault with a
deadly weapon on a warrant sworn to by
Herman Janus. The former's wife was
also arrested on a charge of battery, and
both were released on bail. The cause
of their arr<-st was the outcome of a dis
pute which occurred in Hausler's photo
graphic gallery on Market street a few
nights ago over the right to occupy a re
ception-room. The prosecutor leased
apartments leading off the gallery from
Hausler with the understanding that he
could use the elevator and reception room.
The contract was carried out until a
misunderstanding arose and Hausler de
nied them the privilege. The latter placed
a lock on the elevator, and was proceed
ing to replace the lock that had been torn
off by Janus when he was attacked by
three men. -In protecting himself he cut
â wide swaths in the air with his hatchet,
and his wife aided him in a feminine way.
The participants raised such a disturb
ance that the police were compelled to re
sort to heroic measures to quiet them. All
hands with the exception of. the lady were
removed to the City Prison,, wherecharges.

IN BELLAMY'S MEMORY.
The Socialists Have Called a Mass-
Meeting to Honor the Great
Reformer.
Under the direction of Socialists, a
memorial meeting in honor of Edward
Bellamy will be held at the Turk-street
Temple on Friday evening. In order to
enable the public acquainted with, and
interested in Bellamy's work to come to
gether upon one common platform, irre
spective or religions, creeds and private
interests, to express their regard for the
dead social reformer, the socialists have
issued invitations to all the leading so
cieties of social reform in this city and
Oakland to participate and send repre
sentatives and speakers. Among them
are the following: The Ministerial Union
of San Francisco, the Theosophical Soci
ety, Young Men's Christian Association,
Young Men's Institute, Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union, San Francisco
Labor Council, the Building Trades Coun
cil, Cigarmakers' International Union,
Turn Verein, Vorwaerts. Oakland Section
of the Socialist Labor party, American
Branch, Socialist Labor party, the So
cial Democracy of San Fiancisco, and the
public in general.
Appropriate musir- and songs will be
rencfered by Mrs. Whitney, Miss Aspden
and the German socialist choir. Speeches
becoming to the occasion will be made
by the various representatives.
UNIFORMS FOUND
IN CHINATOWN
MESSRS. GREEN AND ROSEN
BERG INVESTIGATE.
As There Seems to Be No Prospect of
Settling the Difficulty Here, an
Appeal Was Sent to
Washington.
The Chinatown-made uniforms are still
I occupying the attention of the labor or
ganizations, and no labor or expense will
be spared to put a stop to the practice
iof * having the clothing: made there,
i if possible. 1 ' When the representatives of
! the labor organizations interviewed the
I local authorities Friday afternoon they
were informed that no more goods were
going to Chinatown. Repeated state-
I ments to the contrary, however, made
them suspicious, and yesterday afternoon
Deputy Labor Commissioner Green and j
Ed Rosenberg, secretary of the Labor
Council, started on a tour of investiga
tion. They first visited a shop kept by i
Fay Kee, at 1020 Stockton street, where j
there were ten Chinamen busy making
soldier pants. The room was full of
bundles of cut clothing with tags at
tached from the San Francisco quarter- (
master's department, U. S. A. Mr. Rosen- !
! burg borrowed one of the tags and holds I
it as a trophy. When the workmen were
questioned they said that the proprietor
was out and no one knew when he would !
jbe back. They denied that the clothing '
i was for the soldiers, and said that they :
were making the goods to sell. The in- j
! vestlgators, however, were satisfied that
the goods were being manufactured for j
i the volunteers, and immediately sent the
following telegrams:
SAN FRANCISCO, May EB, IS9R.

SCHOOL FUNDS SHOBT.
The Teachers to Have No Pay for the
Month of June.
Through the mismanagement of the
I School Board the teachers will have to go
j without their June salaries until such
I time as more money comes In from the
i taxpayers during the next fiscal year.
The report of the Finance Committee, of
] which Sam Waller is chairman, was pre
| sented to the board at a meeting on Fri
i day evening from which the following is
: a summary: Bills for supplies amounting
Ito $18,&51 40 were before the committee,
! and the bills for the month of May
and June, the last of the present fiscal
I year, are yet to come in. Teachers' May
| salaries amounted to $54,000 and of shop
; and office employes $1500, making the total
I for salaries $85.5'j0. Consequently, the de
! mands against the school fund were $104,
351 43, in addition to which must be count
ed the June salaries, $85,500, and supply
I bills, unestimated.
The Salaries Committee reported that
the returns from the State Controller
showed a surplus for the department of
$91,000. and this, with the $5i),000 stlU in
j the treasury, brought the available funds
up to $141,000 to meÂ«t demands of $IS9,-
Ssl 4.< and supply bills. The deficit, there
fore, would reach 550,000 by the end of the
! present fiscal year, without estimating
j bills not yet before the board.
It was decided to pay May salaries in
full, but to hold out all merchants' bills
j until after the fiscal year. June salary
\ demands will be held over until the bills
i are paid in July.
INTEKCLUB TENNIS.
Tournaments at the California Club
Yesterday Afternoon.
The second interclub tennis match of
the series was played yesterday afternoon
at the California Tennis Club of this city.
The match wa? between the first teams
of both clubs. Oakland was represented
by the crack double team, Sumner Hardy
and Sain Hardy. The colors of the Cali
fornia Club were upheld by Adams and
Weihe. Oakland proved too strong: a team
for the home players, who succumbed in
three straight sets.
The first set was won in very easy fash
ion by the Oaklanders. The score. 6âo,
is a complete talo in itself. In the sec
ond set Adams ami Weihe pleiced up con
siderably, and managed to get four rajpefl,
when their hopes were suddenly aaeb.eti
to the ground by. a burst of speed on the
part of the .Hardys, which won for them
thÂ£ second set of the match. The third
set was very much like the first, and
identical in score. The complete score
of the match was 6âo, 6â4.6 â 4. 6âo.
The junior ladies' tournament, which
was left unfinished, was completed yes
terday. Miss Eckart beat Miss Parker,
the runner-up, two out of three sets
Each contestant had a set apiece when
time was called for play. The score of
this match was 6â.?, 3â fi, fl â 4. Miss Eck
art is now the champion of the girls'
class.
The match between Joe Daily and
George Whitney and Robert N. Whitney
and George Bradshaw was postponed until
to-day. ,
A Notable Window.
For the past few years the show win
flows of "Raphaels," the clothiers, of
San Francisco, have been marvels of
originality and beauty, but probably
no effort of this house in the past has
quite equaled the unique and patriotic
design now exhibited as a memorial
to the unfortunate victims of the
Maine disaster.
Arrested on a Novel Charge.
Lewis Thors, a photographer, was ar
rested yesterday on a warrant sworn to
by Emma F. Mandon on a charge of re
fusing to exhibit books of a corporation.
He was released by Judge Joachimsen.
Thors claims his arrest was instigated by
a photographer named Williams, and
that the complaining witness is the lat
ter's tool.
Hurt in a Collision.
Jefferson Powers, a livery stable keep
er, living at 2125 Mission street, while out
driving yesterday, was thrown from his
vehicle by colliding with a heavy wagon,
and Buffered a scalp wound and an abra-
Blon of the arm. He was treated at th c
City and County Hospital, and was re
moved to his home.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1898.
WHO WILL BE
POLICE JUDGE?
Supervisors and Bosses
Lock Horns.
A DARK HORSE EXPECTED.
GAVIGAN, MOGAN, SPINETTI
Possibility That Walter Gallagher,
the Practitioner, May Be Ac
cepted by the Factions as
a Compromise.
Just now there is much speculation In
and about the new City Hall and at cer
tain political headquarters as to who will
be the police magistrate appointed by the
Board of Supervisors to succeed the late
Judge Campbell In Department L The
time is short now and next Tuesday will
ccc the wind-up.
A long and heated caucus was held on
Friday afternoon, at which no result was
had. Supervisors Clinton, Dodge and Rot
tanzi, the Democratic minority, of course
were absent. Rainey wanted Dr. Gavigan
to ornament the bench, but could only
muster four of his steady henchmen,
namely, Devany, Delany, Britt and Riv
ers. Lanigan, the thirteenth member of
the board, declared tor 12. P. Mogan, the
present prosecuting attorney of Judge
Conlan's court. He had two sturdy fol
lowersâHaskins and Sheehan.
This is only one-half of the votes of the
board and not enough to elect. Up to the
present time the two bosses have not
been able to agree upon any one candi
date who can go in with seven votes. It
is also certain that Rainey and Lanigan
will not agree upon ex-Superior Judge
Lawler, because he is not particularly to
the liking of the Chief of Police, who, it
is understood, would accept either Mogan
or Spinetti, who was prosecuting at
torney under Judge Campbell. The Chief
is now willing to accept Mogan in order
to reduce friction, and to that end Ser
geant Bethel and Detective Dillon and
others are apparently lending their aid.
In the midst of all this it is stated that
a dark horse in the person of the well
known practitioner, Walter Gallagher,
will come in as a compromise candidate.
As he is not a boss man there will be
gnashing of teeth if such a thing does
come to pass.

A GROOM'S SUICIDE.
Joseph Walton of Wales Ends His
Life by Swallowing Car
bolic Acid.
Joseph Walton, a groom, committed sui
cide yesterday afternoon by swallowing
carbolic acid.
The deceased, judging from a letter left
to a friend and now in possession of the
Coroner, was a man educated far above
his station in life and comes from a good
family in Wales. He was a native of that
country and 30 years old. He had been
in the service of George A. Pope, of 1516
Jackson street, for several months, and
his best friend, Alexander Dellow, did not
even suspect that the young man har
bored a thought of making away with
himself. Delluw went to Walton's room
at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon to carry
an order to him, and found him lying on
his bed dead. A bottle which had con
tained carbolic acid and a letter were ly
ing on the table. The following Is the let
ter:
Dear Alice: I am more than sorry to leave
you like this, but I can't help It. All my be
ionglnss I leave to you for your kindness to

Walter B. Cooke of the Argonaut, and
is a credit to his abilities as a writer.
Pickpockets Make a Haul.
The ever present pickpocket plied his
nefarious calling at the butchers' picnic,
despite the efforts of the police to pre

EPEAKING OF A HOMEâ
We will tell you of something- that will cost
you virtually nothing. This Is particularly
addressed to rent-payers and we ask you
If you aren't really doing a foolish thing
to be continually paying rent when that
same rent money will give you a well-built,
coiy ah! conveniently situated home? Stop
a moment and think how much better you
will fare in the end If you take the same
rent money you are now throwing away
and apply it to something- more substantial
than a bunch of rent receipts. At your
first leisure hour go out to the Heyman
tract and see the six new houses we've
Just built â three of which we have Just sold.
We'll show you the three others and con-
vince you of the advantages over the rent-
paying plan. To see property and cottages
take Mission-st. cars, transfer to Twenty-
?<=â â¢. ~>nd. to Hoffman aye. and ask for JAMES

you around. JACOB HEYMAN, 11 Mont-

BATTLE OF
THE GIANTS
Oakland and Fresno in a
Hot Game.
A FALLDOWN AND A RALLY
HOW EASY-GOING PROVED A
PITCHEB'S UNDOING.
BY JOE CORBETT.
After fourteen innings of unceasing
effort and patience, coupled with an
unfair umpire, the Oaklands toiled and
hustled In last Sunday's game with
Fresno only, as reports have it, to be
robbed of a game which they declare
would have been won by them had it
been allowed ' to continue. With the
thoughts of this defeat fresh in their
memory, they yesterday appeared on
the diamond at Recreation Park with
the gTim determination of wiping out
that unfortunate defeat and demon
strating in an unmistakable manner
that Fresno, while a good team, is far
from being "such a much."
. Mr. M. Pluvius Rainmaker, who on
Friday displayed perfect control over
Recreation Park, listened to the pray
ers of those Oaklanders, and in conse
quence a day perfect In every respect
for baseball was the result.
Mr. Russell, according to schedule,
occupied the pitcher's box. It was he
who kept those "raisin-eaters" on
"Queer street" for the fourteen innings
last Sunday, and it was he who was
seen at an early hour this morning
"rehearsing his speed," in anticipation
of the honor and glory that would rest
upon his broad and well-proportioned
shoulders should his curves prove an
enigma.
Umpire Sweeney, who was engaged
for this particular game, and who will
also from now on be on the regular
staff, ejaculated "Play ball" at exactly
3 o'clock.
Oakland took the field, and all hands
moved around in search of comfortable
spots, expecting, as was natural, that
the greatest game of the age was about
to begin. In a way they were not dis
appointed. Fresno, assisted by Mr.
Russell's wildness, coupled with large,
juicy errors by O'Neil and Schmeer, to
say nothing of the few hits that hap
pened along, scored six runs, and shat
tered the hopes of all present, who were
laboring under the sad delusion that
another fourteen inning game, full of
brilliant plays and good pitching, was
to be their lot. It was a cruel disap
pointment. For a few innings it looked
as though the game might possibly de
velop into a tie score, or have a heart
rending climax, as Fresno scored no
more until the fifth inning, and the
Oaklands kept plugging along making
a run now and then. Just to show
there was no hard feeling. But Pitcher
Thomas was keeping the hits well
scattered, and it really looked as j
though Oakland must submit to the i
inevitable. Pitchers, however, very
often grow careless, especially when
things appear easy, and Thomas is no
exception to the rule.
After pitching steady ball for half
the game the work appeared to become
monotonous, and before one could say
"Spaniard" three foreign ministers
were given their passports to first base
without any interference from the other
powers, and the battle off St. Thomas
proved to be anything but a rumor.
After filling the three corners, Russell,
the next man up, dropped one toward
first and beat it out, Held falling all
over himself, endeavoring to get there
before him and forgetting all about the
runners â¢ dashing for the plate. On
waking up he let the ball go over to
ward the grand stand and two runs
| were the result. But the fun did not
stop here. Donovan, the next man,
hit to Courtney. He went at the ball
as though his life depended on his get
ting it, and as is alway-s the case with
such playing, the ball was fumbled, an
other run scoring, Donovan reaching
first and immediately stealing second.
Then old reliable Tip O'Neil put one
into deep center, another runner cross
ing the plate. Levy followed, and not
to be outdone, hit one in the same
direction, another runner scoring, mak
ing it five all told.
From this inning on each team put
up a miserable article of ball. It ap
peared as though they were endeavor
ing to see which was really the worst
team of the two, and Fresno came out
with flying colors. In fact, they In
reality gave up the game after Oak
land made their rally in the fifth, and
gave the impression that they were not
stayers. Whether this be true or not,
the fact remains that they played like
a "bunch of Indians," Thomas par
ticularly pitching very poor ball, con
sidering the work he was doing in the
I early stages of the game. In the sev
enth Inning he was batted at will.
I Sykes started the fun with a two base
i.it, Sullivan took a base on balls, then
"Claudie" Schmeer, who was the hero
of the seventh inning, making three of
the vilest errors for such a good player
I as he undoubtedly is, redeemed him
self by putting a clean three base hit
into right center. Moskiman and Rus
sell followed' with hit.?, Donovan went
out on a fly' to Courtney, and O'Neil
hit safe, six runs crossing the plate, and
the game wns won beyond all doubt.
As to features, there were not any, and
the less said about some of , the plays
the better. The score Is as follows:

Red Cross Day at the Churches.
Services for Memorial Day.
Children to Bring Gifts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, i
908 Broadway, May 28.
This is to be soldiers' week in Oakland. |
Orders, it is said, have been issued from
headquarters, but have not yet been made
absolute, that on Thursday next the local
soldier boys g * Into camp preparatory to
joining the American forces in the Philip
pines.
For several we*ks Companies A and F
of the Fifth Infantry in this city and
Company G in Alameda have been pre
paring themselves for the call which will
Boon arrive. They are well equipped and
well drilled, and for the first time in their
history they are face to face with the
crucial test of loyalty. . . .
Many of them for years have been sol
diers on parade, and have officiated at
full-dress ceremonies. They have always
been classed as gallant and brave, but ,
OFFICERS OF THE OAKLAND LIGHT CAVALRY,
hitherto gallantry and bravery have
never been put to the test.
Oakland always has been gTcatly inter
ested In the doings of her two companies
of militia. In a social way, in addition
to their soldier duties,. the boys have been
popular, and have always been much in
evidence. Mo one doubts that they will
ail be just as willing to shoulder their
muskets and march and actual warfare
as. they have been in the past when on
escort duty or taking part in the grand
march at one of their military balls.
When the orders came a few weeks ago
for the guardsmen to enroll afresh as
volunteers, holding themselves in readl
ness to proceed to the? front at a few
hours' notice, over 90 per cent of the boys
at once signed the roll. The remainder
consisted of a few married men with
families, who are willing to go if neces
sary, and a few who are incapacitated
by sickness.
"The situation in Alameda is the same.
Company <: is now busy .filling up its !
ranks, which have been' depleted by thÂ«
leaving of many of the boys who have
gone to the front in other companies. A
recruiting station was opened to-day at
Haywards for the purpose of recruiting
sufficient men to make Company G's
muster roll complete.
There is little doubt that the majority
of the Oakland men will pass the medical
nation, for most of them have, al- j
ready -:"-ed themselves of their physi- \
cal ability to pass the army test. If any
should be thrown out on this account,
there is a very robust corps of emergency !
men, .< ho have already taken the , oath
and who stand ready to enter the vol
unteer company as soon as called on.
There Is a general desire to keep the
Oakland companies on this â¢ side of the
bay until they go on board the transport.
It has been proved during the past few
weeks that the climate of the Presidio
Is not as pleasant nor as healthful as |
that of this side of the bay. There are
over here large tracts quite as convenient
to the bay as the Presidio which could be
used for camp grounds, and would make
excellent places for drill. In addition to
these advantages, the Oakland Red Cross
Society and the many organized and un
official agencies which are working to
enhance the comforts of the soldiers
would have a special field in â which to
work and this would, no doubt, be very
acceptable to the Fifth Regiment.
There are now many. OaKland boys in
camp at the Presidio suffering for want of
necessaries, and this morning they sent
a letter to the Red Cross League stating
their needs and asking that the ladies
take steps to supply them The result of
their letter has been that the league has
decided to pay particular attention to the
needs of Oakland militiamen. If the Fifth
Infantry when ordered into camp were
etationed on this side there is no doubt
that when ordered to Manila they would be
the best-equipped regiment leaving these
slt was not known till the boys com
menced upon their camp life how greatly
In need of clothing and necessaries many
of them were. Little notes have been re
ceived from the Presidio to personal
friends In this city which have disclosed
a state of affairs of which few were
aware. The soldiers are not ordinarily
wealthy, and many of them have nothing
of" this world's goods, but It seems to be
realized now that each volunteer is per
forming- in a measure the duty of those
who stayed at home and that consequent
ly the soldiers' need is a debt that must
be liquidated, and not in any sense a
plaint for charity to be grudgingly satls-
There would be about SOO men of the
Fifth Regiment, and it would be the pride
of Oakland to have those men over here
and send them forth lacking for nothing,
as well as make the remaining weeks ;of
their stay comparatively happy.
ANXIOUS TO SERVE.
Prominent Young Men Expect
Their Services to Be
Accepted.
An order has been Issued by Captain
Lefllngwell of the Oakland Light Cavalry
for a meeting at headquarters next Mon
day night. The cavalry is fast getting
into shape for active service, and Con
gressman Hilborn and Senator Perkins
have been asked to use their influence in
having the brigade accepted.
There are nearly l'W members who have
taken the oath and who are drilling in
the headquarters in the Macdonough
building. Next Monday a communication
is expected from army headquarters that
may decide the fate of the brigade. The
members are among the best-known of
Oakland's young men. and nearly all of
them are now engaged in lucrative posi
tions. But they all declarr their willing
npps to take the field at a day's notice.
Captain Leffingwell is an old cavalry
iran and at present engaged in newspaper
work. First Lieutenant H. F. Pugh has
ha* 1 experience as a guardsmen, and
Is â¢ Jitor of the Tribune. First Lieutenant
A. A. Moore Jr. is a deputy District At
torney, ami Second Lieutenant Abe P.
Leach is an attorney. All are very popu
lar and have been prominent for some
years in local social circles.
PATRIOTISM AT CHURCH.
The Red Cross League Will Be
Greatly Helped by To
day's Collections.
ThÂ« MlniÃtoria! Union has sent out ln
vitations to the pastors of all churches
to hold Red Cross services to-morrow
morning. Many of the preachers have
promised to preach special sermons on
this great hum&nitariaji society. The con
tributions will be turned over to the local
society, and every one is requested to
bring special offerings to fhe league.
Lieutenant L. M. Cobbledick of the
National Guard, who was f<>r many years
an officer in the Boys' Brigade, is or
ganizing an independent company of in
fantry in East Oakland, which, when
properly. dr.i!Jed s will offer its services to
the Government.
In West Oakland an independent cav
alry corps is also being organized by F.
Luttrell, and already over sixty have en
listed.
The Catholic Knights of America have
passed a resolution agreeing to make
pond all delinquent dues and assessments
of members who go to the war. The An
clent Order of Hibernians some weeks
ago passed a similar resolution.
The services at the churches to-morrow
will be of a patriotic nature. In the
evening at the Church of the Advent
there will be special services, with elab
orate decorations of flags and flowers,
which is somewhat new in the Episcopal
church. At this service Mrs. Blake-Al
verson will sing "God Save Our Lnion.

FATHER COMES WEST
TO SEEK HIS SON
DECLARES CLARE DEPUE IS
KEPT IN HIDING.
Accuses His Wife of Not Wanting a
Union Between the Boy and
His Parent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 28.
ClarÂ© Depue. 13 years old, and residing
at the home of G. M. Blair, 676 Tenth
street, Oakland, has been missing since
January 31 last, when he called at Lafay
ette School, Oakland, to get his books,
though he would not give any reason for
leaving nor tell where he was going.
His father was in the East, and had
sent for him repeatedly, but his step
mother would not allow him to go. The
boy nas no friends outside of Oakland,
and had no means supplied him with
which to get away or support himself af
ter leaving, while he is too young and
inexperienced to earn a living.
Those who know the boy cannot credit
the story of his stepmother that he has
turned runaway, and justify the conclu
sion of his father that he has been spirit
ed away out of motives of maliciousness,
and through the collusion of her friends.
The last positive trace of the boy was
when he made an alleged call at a Mrs.
Sadie Blaney's at 1327 Oak street, San
Francisco, to whom â he is said to hayÂ«
confided the fact that he Intended to run
The boy is large of his age, with light
brown hair 'and gray eyes. Any informa
tion of his whereabouts or clue as to who
is harboring him, will be thankfully re
ceived by his father, J. E. Depue, who
has come to the coast especially to hunt
for his boy.

At a meeting of the Pastors' Union of

adopted:
The Pastors' I'nion of the city of
Oakland desires to express its
hearty approval of the recent utter
ances of its president, Hey. Dr. E.
R. Dille, respecting the demoraliz

received from benevolent
and other organizations and enter
prises. We are ever in deepest and
truest sympathy with our beloved
Fabiola Hospital, and with all legit
imate and proper efforts to add to
its resources for doing good, but
we deplore the recent use of the
racetrack, with all its baneful ac
cessories and activities, to add to
the financial strength of this cher
ished and worthy institution. Such
an act cannot but add to the harm
ful Influence of the racetrack, while
it will ti-nd to weaken any worthy
institution or movement which
adopts it. We beseech all friends
of t\k morals of aur city and vicin
ity to duly consider the Limitless
amount of evil constantly resulting
from the racetrack, and to refrain
from all advertisement of and al
liance with this harmful institu
tion.

OFFICER DOWNEY'S CONDUCT.
Has Been Suspended and Will Have
Charges Placed Against Him.
OAKLAND, May 28.â Police Officer
Frank J. Downey has been suspended by
Chief Fletcher, and the detective force
put to work to find the missing 1 man.
The last seen of him was on Wednesday,
when he boarded the 5 p. m. train for San
Francisco. Ho left without leaving any
word with his family, but told soma
friends that he was going to Stockton.
It was too late for the boat at that hour,
and it is believed that he was under th<s
influence of liquor and did not know what
he was doing.
The Chief has no information regarding
Downey being under the influence of
liquor while on duty, although complaints
were made that he was not conducting
himself as an officer should. Charges will
be preferred against him of absenting
himself from duty without permission.
He was formerly an electric railway em

THE CROWDED SCHOOLS.
Board of City Trustees Refuse an
Appropriation and Want a
Bond Election.
AT,AMEDA, May 2s.â At a special meet
ing of the Board of City Trustees last
evening permission was granted to the
Board of Education to pay $1400 for a
lot adjoining the Encinal School premises.
The matter of additional school facilities
â¢was then taken up. and the need for them
was shown. A motion was made that
$7000 be appropriated for the erection of
wings to the present sehoolhouses where
most needed. This motion was debated at
length, and was finally put to a vote and
lost. The sense of the board was that
a bond election should be held to raise
money enough to build a new structure.
The sentiment of a great many tax
payers, however, is against incurring any
further Indebtedness, and it is very doubt
ful if a bond proposition could be passed.

REDUCTIONS IN
SECOND-CLASS RATES
SOUTHERN PACIFIC WILL PUT
SOME IN ISxFECT JUNE 5.
Routings Will Be by Way of Mojave,
El Paso and New Orleans.
Rates via Ogden Not
Changed.
Announcement of reductions in second
class rates was made In the offices of the
Southern Pacific Company yesterday af
ternoon, and created quite a stir in rail
road circles, for it is sufficient evidence
that the big corporation has at last de
cided to enter the field against the Cana
dian Pacific Railroad, which has for some
months been getting the major part of the
business to Eastern points. The reduc
tions will not affect first-class rates, and
aro intended to apply only from here to
three definite Eastern points, and will be
in effect on Sunday, June 5. The rates as
announced are: To St. Louis, ?37; Chi
cago, $32 50; New York, $42 55. As at pres
ent the rates are respectively $47 50, %S1 50
and $ii 6 M, the reductions are material
ones.
These rates will not affect the Ogden
gateway, and the routeings will most
probably be by way of El Paso, via the
Texas and Pacific Railroad, to St. .Louis
via the St. Louis and San Francisco Rail
way, New Orleans and the Illinois Cen
tral, and by Mojave and the Santa Fe.
East of Chicago the traffic will be han
dled by the Nickel Plate line.
As the company must file a list of the
contemplated rates with th<; Interstate
Commissioners and other details must be
complied with, they will sell on and after
June 5 tickets at the present rates with
a rebate order on the terminal point, i* or
instance, to Chicago $52 50 "will be collected
here, and $20 will be returned to the pas
senger when he reaches his point of des
tination. Therefore, until further notice,
the rebate plan will be in operation.
Again, the rates are good only from Sac
ramento or San Francisco eastward, the
rebate being $12 less from Los Angeles
thaji from this city. From intermediate
points the rates will be somewhat higher.
From San Jose the rate will be *1 25
over San Francisco; Stockton and Marys
ville $1 70 and $1 60 respectively over Sac
ramento; Fresno $:'> 75, Ilanford $4 05, Tu
lare and Visalia *5 and Bakerslseid $ti 90
over San Francisco; Mojave $11 S5 over
San Francisco and $3 75 over Los Angeles.
WIDBER'S TECHNICALITIES.
They Are About Exhausted, and He
May Plead Next Saturday.
Augustus C. Widber, the defaulting
Treasurer, has about exhausted all legal
t'Thnallties at his command, and It Is
thought that he will plead to the indict
ment against him next Saturday. \Vi<l
b*r was before Judge Cook yesterday
morning, and on taking up the case of
embezzlement the court dismissed the ue
murrer Introduced by the defendai t lust
week alleging that he had not been served
with a copy of the testimony taken at the
Grand Jury investigation of his case.
Attorney I'lexotto then introduced othor
demurrers to the Indictment. He claimed
that it did not clearly describe Widber's
offense. Judge Cook was not prepared to
decide the points raised and in conse
quence the ease went over for a week.
Should the court decide against Widber at
that time it is thought that he will plead
to the indictment.
The case of Charles Grant, a boy burg-
Lir ivho entered and looted houses of the
fashionabLe district, was next taken up.
The prisoner asked to be sent to Whittier
Reform SchooL Hlfl Honor consented
and sentenced him to the southern insti
tution until he shall become of age. As
Grant is now 1G he will remain in custody
for five years.
Nicholas Tends, convicted of arson in
the second degree for having set fire to a
restaurant at 21 Fifth street, was seu-
Ked to serve ten years in San Quentin
on.

Betail Grocers Picnic.
Next Sunday will be the date of the
twenty-seventh anniversary picnic of the
retail grocers of this city, the old organi
zation "established in 1871, whose outings
have always been recognized by the
friends of the union and the general pub
lic as the real chance for a good time,
both for young and old. This year the
management of the picnic is under the
leadership of Vice-president Henry Hart
je, assisted by President J. T. Hurley,
Treasurer J. B. Mahoney, Secretary L. P.
Dolder, Messrs. George Heinemann, H.
Drewes, Henry Kohn, I* H. Kohn, D. \V .

other members, whose names appear on
the elaborately constructed souvenir pro

for the entertainment of the guests of
the Retail Grocers' Protective Lnion. The
wholesalers have liberally contributed
nrizes for the occasion. Among them the
firm of Tillmann & Bendel have donated
an elegant silver tea set, and another old
time friend of the union, Ciaus Spreckels.
has again been particularly liberal to the
committee. The tea set mentioned will
form the first gate prize, and will surely
prove a good drawing card for the grand
success of this year's picnic.

ACCUSED
OF BEING A
SPANISH SPY
J. D. Beserra Loses a
Wife and Is Se
verely Beaten.
HE THREATENED TO SHOOT
DISARMED BY HIS RIVAL AND
LOCKED UP IN PRISON.
While Seated in the Patrol Wagon
He Is Attacked by a Sailor,
Who Breaks His
Nose.
Beaten by his hated rivals severely
punched by a drunken sailor, and arrested
on a charge of exhibiting a deadly weap
on, were the misfortunes that befell J. D.
Beserra, a Spaniard, last night.
Several months ago Beserra left his wife
and two children and went to Los An
.geles. Learning that his wife had trans
ferred her affections to another man, he
determined to return to this city and
wreak vengeance on the usurper of his
domestic happiness. He arrived here last
evening, and buying a 32-caliber ! Colt's
revolver, he went to his wife's home at
657 Mission street, bent on killing his
hated rival. Meeting the latter in the
hallway he drew his revolver and at
tempted to shoot. His intended victim
seized him by the right arm, and after
a short struggle succeeded in disarming
him.
The screams of Beserra" s wife attract
ed the attention of Policeman T. C.
Murphy, who placed the bloodthirsty
Spaniard under arrest. While on the
way to the City Prison in the patrol
wagon a drunken sailor, who gave his
name as Eugene Fraser, was picked up
and seated alongside of Beserra. After
carefully scrutinizing the latter, the
sailor, after accusing him of being a
Spanish spy, struck him a blow in the
face, fracturing his nose and closing one
of his eyes.
The sailor started to follow up his ad
vantage when Officer Murphy seized him
and held him until the prison was reach
ed. While struggling with the sailor
Murphy's hand was severely injured, and
Fraser was booked for drunkenness and
battery, and Beserra for exhibiting a
deadly weapon.
Beserra was indignant over the treat
ment accorded him. He claimed that he
had always provided for his wife and
could not understand why she refused to
kir"pr live wi*h him.
"This man Rivero, whom I attempted
to shoot," he declared, "I thought was
my friend. I took him to my house when
he was penniless, and fed him. .When I
learned that he had won the affections of
my wife I swore to be avenged. Why this
drunken sailor should accuse me of being
â  â  spy .s<i-iii> scraiigf. i..> o a\ the it-asi.
When he struck me I was not prepared
for the assault,, hence his easy victory
over me. I have been in this country for
a number of years, and have taken little
interest in the present conflict between
Spain and the United States."

NEVILLS HINTS
AT FORGERY
DECLINES TO IDENTIFY LET-
TERS AS BEING HIS.
Admits That He Is Willing to Com
promise With the Women He
Is Prosecuting.
Quite a crowd gathered in Judge Joach
imsen's courtroom yesterday, in the hope
of listening to some spicy testimony or
the reading of some of the interesting cor
respondence that has been mentioned dur
ing the present hearing. Disappointment
was In store for them, as the testimony
offered was short and dry, and no let
ters were read.
Mrs. Warren Newcombe. who resides at
625 Powell street, was the first witness
called, and under the cross-examination
of Attorney Baker it was elicited that
she had gone to Fresno on the 24th of
February of this year at the suggestion
of Captain Nevills for the purpose of
seeing Mrs. Williams, with a view to
suppressing the scandal that was about
to be made public. She stated that she
met Mr. Azhderian on the train, and they
discussed things. Mr. Baker tried to make
her admit that she learned that Azh
derian was on the same mission, but the
witness said she was unaware of it.
Mrs. Newe-ombe said that Mrs. Williams
was going to bring, a suit against the
captain for betrayal, and she went there
for the purpose of suppressing it. "I
stayed at the Grand Central with Mrs.
Williams the night of my arrival, and
was present when Mr. Nevills signed the
chtck." She said that she remained a
half hour, but heard no conversation be
tween the captain and his accuser. "Mrs.
Williams left the room to cash the check,
and on her return I left. I know that
she stayed in the hotel two or three days
nursing the captain." On imparting the
above information the witness was ex
cused, and Captain Nevills, the relentless
prosecutor of the alleged conspirators,
was tailed. He entered the courtroom
with a heavy tread, glanced at the
woman who charges him with the crime,
and was given a sweet smile of com
passion in return.
On taking the stand. Attorney Baker
handed him three or four spicy letters,
evidently written by the witness, and
asked him to acknowledge their authen
ticity, and also the meaning of certain
paragraphs.
"What was the meaning of that, letter,
Mr. Baker asked, handing the witness a
billet defcx. "The meaning was that the
public knew that Elsie Williams was try
ing to extort money from .me," answered
Nevills.
"You stated you were willing to settle
with her, but you did not like to pay
lawyers." asked his questioner.
Captain Nevills tried to restrain his feel
ings, and said, "Read the letter."
Instead of complying with his request,
and much to the disappointment of those
in court, Mr. Baker handed it to the wit
ness.
He was asked whether he did not mean
by "that it was all out now" that the
matter had been found out by Mrs.
Nt'vills. "I did not mean my wife," an
swered the captain. "I meant that they
had told it to an attorney and sworn to
a complaint..
"You understood that she was going to
expose you to your wife?"
"Yes," said Nevills, "I supposed it wai
all out between us."
The last remark caused the persecuted
ladies to laugh outright, in which all
joined.
On objection by Mr. Dunne the court
ruled that the letters must be identified,
and Mr. Bakor obeyed. He handed the
witness a letter, and as the latter took
some time to examine the epistle, Mr.
Baker peevishly remarked: "Does it take
you as long as that to identify your hand
writing?"
The witness answered: "In this case,
where there has been so many charges
of forgery, it does. It looks like my writ
ing."
The witness was shown a number of
other letters, all of which he declined to
identify, saying that he was not sure it
was his handwriting.
An adjournment was taken until next
Friday at 2 o'clock, when the captain will

Committees Appointed and Prelim-
inaries Satisfactorily Arranged.
The State Convention of the Socialist
Labor party met in the Turk-street Tem
ple last evening for the arrangement of
preliminaries and the appointment of
committees. There was a good repre
sentation from all parts of the State and
a great deal of enthusiasm was mani
fested.
James Andrew of Berkeley was elected
chairman and Oliver Everett of San
Francisco secretary. The committeemen
elected were as follows: Credentials â
Hecht, King and Kingsley; order of busi
nessâHarriman and Wright; platform
and resolutionsâ Tug, Harriman, Franz,
Wilker.s and Wright; ways and means â
Grebs. Ogden, Harriman, Kingsley, Me-
Iver, Wright and Speed.
As the roll was called each delegate
gave a brief report of conditions and
progress in his part of the State, which
was very satisfactory. Each section of
the State has had substantial gains in
membership during the past year and the
propaganda committees have in all cases
done a great deal of work for the cause.
, The convention will reconvene at 10
o'clock this morning, when the actual
work of adopting a State platform, laying
out a plan of campaign and making nomi
nations will be taken up.

THE DEMOCRATS
ARE UNABLE
TO HARMONIZE
Major Hartley's Followers Will Not
Abide by the State Committee
Decision.
Governor Budd Publicly Announced That
lie Is Not a Candidate for Governor or
Senator.
The efforts of the Democratic State
Central Committee to restore harmony
In the camp of the local Democracy
have failed. A new county committee
was appointed by the State Committee
rday at the California Hotel on
recommendation of the "harmony"
committee, but the followers of Harney
and Rainey are still sulking in their
tents. After the State Committee
meeting adjourned yesterday afternoon,
several of the membirs of the old Harney
committee declared that they would vote
the Republican ticket at the next general
election rather than submit to the dicta
tion of the men selected to supplant the
old committees of the two warring fac
tions.
Governor Budd, who is a member of the
State Central Committee, attended the
meeting, and in the course of a speech
declared that he â was not a candidate for
United States Senator or for Governor.
That news was received with pleasure by
the friends of Congressman Maguire. who
feared that Governor Budd might go be
fore the next Democratic State convention
F.--oking a renomination for the office he
now holds. His public withdrawal from
the Senatorial fight also surprised many,
who thought that in the event of there
being a Democratic majority in the next
State Legislature, he might seek to suc
ceed Ser.at.ir White.
From th? standpoint of harmony the
meeting was anything but a success. The
two local factions are in worse position
now than they wen- before. The mem
bers of the ilarney wing believe that they
were unfairly treated, and they will not
submit to the decrees of the Stiite com-
The result will be a merry war
among the Democrats between now and
election
I he meeting was called to order short
fore nooa hour by Chairman Aiford,
innounced that the first business for
considaratioii was the report of the com
mittee of nine appointed to reorganize and
harmonize the local factions.
K. L. Fitzgerald of Alameda, chairman
of the committee, read a lengthy report,
unending that neither of the con.
ai factions be recognized and
that in the stead, of both, the following
committee of 100 be appointed to manage
the affairs of the local Democracy:

After the reading of the report of tho
committee Byron i tall of Yolo arose to
n q testion of privilege and asked by what
authority the State Central Committee
tuted Itself the guardian of the lo
cal ] "-inocracy ?
Chairman Alford replied that the sub
committee had been appointed at the re
quest of the contending local factions.
Ball thereupon said that the State Com
mittee was invading the rights of the
cities of the State. Tt was his opinion
that the State Committee had no right,
power or authority to interfere in local
factional lights.
W. Brobeck of San Francisco followed
In a brief but pointed speech. He said
that nevi r before in the history of the
party In the State had there been such
an attempt to usurp the rights of Dem
ocrats. He claimed that the committee
was not composed of men rjnversant
with the political feeling of the city Dem
ocrats, and that under the circumstances
they had no right to attempt to dictate
just what should be done.
(Jiivln Mc'.Nali replied in defense of the
committee's report and said that the

ADVERTISEMENTS.
AND
CURED OF
I take pleasure in letting you know how
much Cuticura Remedies have done for me,
ray father and two brothers. In tho fall of
'95,1 began to be afflicted with an itchingrash
under my chin. It kept spreading until it
was all over my body. I could not sleep but
was compelled to lie awake and scratch all
the time. My father and two brothers wero
afflicted with the same thing, at the same time.
We all suffered terribly fora year and a half,
trying in the meantime all tho remedies wo
could find, but received no benefit. I hap-
pened to see Coticcra Remedies advertised
and how they had cured others from itching
ekin diseases, and we thought we would try
them. I bought three cakes of Cuticura
Boap and three boxes of Cdticuka (ointment)
and they cured the fimr of us completely.
Any person doubting the truth of this state-
ment can write me. RICHARD ANDERSON,

had on morÂ« than one occasion been com
pelled to take a hand in settling local dif
ferences.
P. J. Harney, chairman of one of the
i factions, next claimed the floor.
! Chairman Alford said that Harney, who
â  only held a proxy, was not allowed, under
thÂ« committee rules, to speak.
"I move that Major Harney be per
! mitted to speak." said Governor Budd.
The motion, being put, was carried and
Harney entered into a lengthy discussion
concerning the rights of the two local
; factions. He claimed that the committee
of which he is chairman was the only
legal body, and that to not recognize it
â  meant disruption in the party. He dls- i
puted the right of the State Committee ;
: to interfere in local affairs, and in con- .
eluding said that the San Francisco Dem
ocr&ts were able to govern themselves.
"We know our rights." said he, "and I
I earnestly ask the committee to pause and i
: reflect before voting on the report of the >
harmony committee. I believe that if the
report is adopted as read it will only
serve to disintegrate the party in thii
! city."
Governor Budd followed Harney, and
said that he was untrammeled by
, any personal interests. "I am not a can-
I dldate for Governor, nor am I a. c&ndi
: date for Senator," said he, '"and I will
further add that I would not accept
either nomination if it were offered me." ,
He then said that it was a delicate matter
to decide just what should be done under
the circumstances. "Something must be
done," he concluded, "to restore harmony
In San Francisco. To jeopardize this city |
means defeat to the State ticket."
John W. Mitchell ol bos Angeles of- |
fered as a substitute a motion that each
member outside of San Francisco be al- j
1 lowed to name a member of the local
I county committee, making the committee
I consist of 129 instead of 10<> members.
Mitchell's motion was lost by a vote of
S4 noes and 23 ayes.
"I now move that the committee report
be adopted." said Mitchell.
"I object." exclaimed Ball of Yolo, "for
it is a most revolutionary measure. Its |
! adoption means disruption in the ranks j
' of the San Francisco Democracy."
Major Harney again claimed the floor.
"1 object to the committee report," he .
; exclaimed, "for it does not give a fair ;
representation. About thirty of the m^n i
named to serve on the new committee are I
from the Sullivan wing of the Democracy, â 
and I ask the sub-committee to show me â¢
a man from our side. Is that fair or
honest? In the interest of harmony I ask
! that the committee report be rejected and ;
i that this State committee call a primary
to be held within the next thirty days.
! Let us decide at the polls who is to serve
on the county committee. Give us a pri
raary and I promise you, gentlemen, that
the side I represent will abide by the re
sult."
To choke off debate the previous ques
tion was called for and carried by a vote
of '7 ayes to 42 noes.
The motion to adopt the committee re
i port naming the 100 members who are
! to serve on the new County Committee
! was then taken up, and a call of the roll
i demanded.
When the name of Governor Budd was
j called, some one voted aye.
The Governor wa.s leaving the meeting |
hall just at that moment, and Chairman !
Alford called out: "Did you vote aye, j
t Juv.-rnor?"
"I presume I did," replied the Governor j
sarcastically, "for McNab says so."
The roll call then proceeded and the
committee report was adopted by a vote
uf eighty ayes to twenty noes.
The report of the committee of five ap- â 
pointed to confer with the Populists and j
Silver Republicans relative to putting up j
a fusion ticket wns next read by J. W".
Mitchell, chairman of the committee. The j
report was to the effect that the joint
committee had been unable to do any
thing, as the Populist committee had been
instructed to vote to have the convention !
held at Sacramento on July 12. "While :
union and fusion is desired," said Mitch- i
ell, after reading the report, "we were j
unable to do anything, as the committee !
has not yet fixed on the time and place
for holding the next State convention."
Marion Brooks objected to any delay in 1
fixing the time and moved that the con- j
vention meet on August 25 in this city.
Chairman Alford ruled the motion out i
of order, as it was decided at the last
meeting of the State Central Committee \
that the matu-r of fixing the time and
place for holding the State convention be I
determined at a special mating.
Major Harney then Introduced a set of i
resolutions providing that the newly
named committee to manage tho local
Democracy be Instructed to call a prim
ary for the election of five members from j
each of the eighteen Assembly Districts j
to form a new county committee.
The resolutions were ruled out of or- '
der and the committee adjourned to the '
call of the chair.
The Harney committee will remain in I
existence, notwithstanding the appoint- I
ment of the new committee, as the mem- i
hers do not believe that they have been i
fairly treated. Inasmuch as 'about thirty
ol the Sullivan wing were put on the new
committee and they were entirely ignored
they do not think that they were justly :
treated by the State Committee. '"""*
CHARTER ELECTION EXPENSES.
The Commissioners Discuss Prepara
tions for the General
Election.
The Board of Election Commissioners
held a short session yesterday morning,
at which the. officers who served on the
charter election were allowed $10 each for
their services. The total amounts to
$3760.
An informal discussion was had regard-
Ing registration for the general election
next November.
Next Tuesday. June I. r^i strati on at
the central office in the City Hall will
commence; but it is thought that not
much interest will be paid to registration
before July.
Auditor Broderick. accepting the deci
sion of the people last Thursday- for a
reduction of salaries by adopting the
charter, moved that the clerks in the
Registrar's office bo paid $100 a month in
future instead of $12. r >, as has been the
custom heretofore. Mayor I'lielan and
Registrar Biggy did not favor the motion,
but, nevertheless, it was carried.
One of those little pleasantries that will
become more manliest by and by between
the Auditor and the Registrar cropped
out at the meeting when Biggy notified
the Commissioners that he wanted clerks
Broderick wished to know the number
but Biggy declined to say. adding that
he would only employ what were neces
sary. Broderick reminded him that the
Commissioners were responsible, and not
the Registrar, for tho management of the
office. Mayor Phelan seemed disposed to
yield to the Registrar's views, but the
Auditor stood firm. The matter may be
further discussed at the meeting on
Tuesday.
A Maine Picnic.
The State of Maine Association of Cali

The programme, under the direction of.
the president, W. G. Dinsmore, will be
of special interest, as i! will contain

A FEW FEET OF HIS HOME.
An Elderly Woman Also Believed of
Her Purse While Visiting
Sddiers at the Pre
sidio.
The police are looking: for two daring
thieves, who have been operating in the
Western Addition.
Several days ago they snatched a purse
from a woman, who was walking along
Van Ness avenue, and notwithstanding
that they were pursued by several citi
zens, who witnessed the act, they man
aged to escape.
Last Thursday night August Freyer, a
saloonkeeper, who lives on Devisadero
street, near Filbert, was on his way home,
when he was accosted by two roughly
clad men, who asked him the time. Freyer
took out his watch and as he opened it,
one of the nien grabbed the timepiece and
ran away, followed by the astonished
saloonkeeper.
After running a short distance Freyer,
realizing he could not overtake them,
gave up the chase. Last night he visited
police headquarters and reported the rob
bery. From his description of the thieves
the police are convinced that they are the
nun who snatched the purse from the
woman on Van Ness avenue.
Henry Heidron, who lives at 973 Harri
son street, mourns the loss of a purse
containing $171 and a gold ring, which
was stolen from him last Wednesday
while he was en route to the butchers'
picnic.
After reaching the Oakland mole Hei
dron, who was In the midst of the crowd,
was suddenly struck a blow in the side.
As he turned around to see who admin
istered the blow he felt a hand inserted
in his pocket. Before he could seize the
hand it was quickly drawn from his
pocket, together with Ills purse and its
valuable contents. Last night Heidron
reported the robbery to Captain Spillane.
lie is convinced that the thief struck him
in the side so as to divert his attention
while he abstracted his pocket-book.
An elderly woman named Mrs. Bur
roughs, who lives on Twentieth street,
was robbed of her purse containing $2 50
while visiting the Presidio yesterday. She
took a basketful of provisions to the sol
diers and was boarding a street car
when some thief deftly picked her pocket
of her purse.

At the close of the previous session,
when Mrs. Emma Harrington, the incum
bent, was elected grand chief companion,
the order was not in as flourishing a con
dition as It might have been. That of
ficial, during her term, has worked hard
to build it up again, and in the past year
through the enthusiasm she instilled In It
seven new circles were instituted. One was
deprived of its charter for failure to
maintain the laws. A portion of that cir
cle was reorganized under the name of
Phoenix. The losses which the order
sustained in previous years were recouped
and it Is now In better condition than It
has been for some time, prior to last
June.
During the session a number of meas
ures, having for their tendency . the ad
vancement of the order, will be consid
ered. Instead of eleven grand officers,
as In the past, under the amended laws
of the Supreme Circle, fourteen will be i
elected. The change abolishes the offices
of grand guard and grand sentry, sub

delegates. The hotels h;ive guaranteed
that the best in the city will be fur

that there will not be any raise In

not enjoy himself it will not be due to
any oversight on the part of those hav

authority of the National Republican
League Convention of 1597, and under
the direction of the California State
League. The convention will be com

A Mimic Battle To-Day.
Lrc of the most interesting as well as
unique entertainments ever given in this
city was held at the residence of Mrs.
Cesar Bertheau. 2112 Vallejo street,yester
day afternoon from 1 to 5 o'clock, the en
tire proceeds being devoted to the Red
Cross Society. The entertainment con
sisted of the representation in miniature
of a battle. No less than 3500 toy soldiers
one and a half inches in heignt comprised
the opposing forces, which were arranged
with exceeding care.
The battle-field was laid out on an im
mense table and was divided by a river.
Hills, valleys and plains were represent
<<l. over which cavalry and infantry
charged and artillery was brought into
action. Part of the attacking forces had
been thrown across the river and suc
ceeded in turning the left wing of the
enemy, which in turn had flanked the in
vadera on their left. Every detail was
faithfully carried out. and the scene
elicited the warmest praise. Over $100
was realized by the entertainment, which
will be repeated again this afternoon at
the same hours and for the same worthy
purpose. _

YSAYE AS AN
ACCOMPANIST.
COMPLIMENTS GEBARDY BY
APPEARING.
The Audience Listens With Delight
to the Rendition of Bach's
Aria by the Noted
Artists.
Ysaye, the renowned virtuoso who has
enraptured large audiences at the Bald
win during the past wefk by his masterly
bowing, created a furor at the popular
playhouse last evening by artistically ac
companying Gerardy on the piano in the
latter's rendering of Bach's aria.
It Is impossible to say who was the most
surprisedâ Gerardy or the musio-lovers
who sat before the footlights. The sud
denness of Ysaye's appearance on the
stage, following as he did Gerardy, who
had returned to respond to the enthusias
tic appreciation of his playing of one ol
Locatelli's beautiful sonatas, simply held
the audience spellbound.
Their eyes followed his dignified march
across the stage, and when he took his
seat at the piano they awaited develop
ments. It soon came. Gerardy's graceful
bow was drawn across the bridge of his
noble and soul-stirring violoncello, and the
strains of the beautiful composition tilled
the theater. Softly following could be
heard the warm tones of the piano, in
perfect harmony with the stringed in
strument, touched by a masterly hand
until the edifice was suffused with mel
ody. At the conclusion of the playing, the
ladies almost split their gloves, so earn
est was their applause while the men did
their share in showing appreciation for
the unlocked for treat.
Both musicians were repeatedly re
called, and Gerardy responded with an
other composition.
When Gerardy was released by the
kindly but selfish gathering he hurried to
Ysaye and poured i.orth nis thanks for
the compliment paid him. Ysaye's only
explanation for the act was that a whim
struck him and he followed its bent.
During the past few months Gerardy
has been wont to play the aria without
accompaniment, and when Ysaye unex
pectedly took his position at the piano it
disconcerted him for a moment, but ap
preciating the high honor being paid him,
he played as he never did before. All the
fire and magnetism that he possesses was
poured into the priceless instrument, and
when he had concluded a bright flush of
pleasure covered his countenance.
Lttcliaume, the clever young artist who ;
accompanies Ysaye and Gerardy in al! !
their selections, gazed In wonderment at j
the former and listened with enwrapped
interest to the violinist's interpretation of ;
the composition.
It is said that Ysaye's appearance at
the piano in public last evening was his
first and might have been his last but for j
the fact that admirers want to see him j
repeat it. To-night he will accompany
Gerardy again. Ysaye may have another
surprise in store for his listeners. Some
one whispered that he was imbued with
patriotic ardor, and he may indulge It in
patriotic selections as a fitting finale to a ,
successful engagement.

GOLD MINING IN SAN FRANCISCO
_ H cp P , Nr , VALLEY WATER MAIN THAT THE TWO SECRET MINERS DAMAGED WHILE BLASTING. THE DAMAGES WERE PLACED AT $8000. THEY PAID THIS fIND
CONTINUED THEIR MINING.
FOR over seventeen years a gold mine has been worked right in
the city of San Francisco. How much gold has been taken out
none but the two miners themselves can say; one of them is
supposed to be on his deathbed ?ni the other one disappeared on the
day that his partner had to be tak;n to the hospital, and the secret
their mine became generally known to the community.
Nelson Shoots, the discoverer of the lead, found the mine ovsr
seventeen years ago while trying to locate the fountain of the gold
dust found along the beach. He was a practical miner at the time
and well versed in all secrets of getting all the gold possible out of
refractory ores.
That he succeeded in doing this in his Ingieside mine there is no
question. For not only aid he make a good living during the seven
teen years, but he paid $8000 damages once for injuring the Spring
Valley water main while blasting; he and his partner lost larÂ°*e
sums of money at the racetracks and they were known as "spenders"
among the resorts in the western side of the city. All the while they
passed as hermits, with barely enough to live on. Some of the neigh
bors believe this was merely a blind to throw curious people off the
track of the mine.
FANCY any one working a gold
mine in San Francisco for over
fifteen years and no one but the
miners knowing anything about
It. Yet that is what has been
done by two men near Insleside.
The mine is on the Sutro property.
What success the miners had, how
much they made, nobody knows but
themselves and one of the men is sup
posed to be on his deathbed, and the
other has disappeared since his partner
fell ill and the fact of the mine became
generally known.
Mooneyville-by-the-Sea and half a
dozen other mining excitements anil
treasure-hunting booms have struck
the ocean beach slope of the city, but
through them all and unknown to all
their promoters these two experienced
miners have been delving sedulously
away on their secret mine. There Is
no question that they found gold,
a man does not stick to a task for over
seventeen years without something to
repay him. And these two miners
paid their living expenses all this while.
Once while blasting they injured a
Spring Valley water main and were as
sessed $8000 damages by the court,
which they promptly paid. Again, it is
well known among their intimate ac
quaintances that they made many big
losings at the race track, and they
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1898.
were known as "spenders" at several
of the resorts in that locality.
Yet all the while to nearby and In
quisitive neighbors these two miners
appeared to be simply hermits. They
assumed the garb of poverty, snarled
like wild beasts at any curious tres
passers and drove off interlopers with
clubs. They would not permit any
one to put a foot on the place under
any circumstances. In the near neigh
borhood they seemed to want the peo
ple to think that they were poor her
mits. When away from home they
seemed indifferent.
This strange life of the two hermit
miners in San Francisco was suddenly
and sharply changed several days ago.
Nelson H. Shoots, the elder man and
the original finder of the mine, was
taken seriously ill. His partner, James
Demott, tried in vain to patch up his
health with the scant medicine supply
in the cupboard. Shoots grew worse
and Demott was obliged to summon
outside assistance to save his sinking
partner, so he sent a message to the
City and County Hospital. Shoots was
taken there at once in the ambulance
and then it was discovered that he was
dangerously ill with heart trouble.
Immediately afterward his partner,
Demott, disappeared, whether tempor
arily or for good is not known at this
writing. With him is the mystery of
the mine that has been worked for over
Beventeen years in San Francisco, for
Shoots tells all sorts of stories about it.
Sometimes he says he worked there
the seventeen years for nothing; at
other times he declares there is plenty
of gold there, and laughs knowingly
and adds, "but you've got to know
whore to find it."
To add to the mystery It Is well
known that Nelson Shoots was a pio
neer miner of this State, and a man of
great experience in secret methods of
handling ores.
That mining operations were exten
sively carried on by Shoots and De
mott there can be no doubt. Their
work shows for itPflf. At least 300
feet of Bbafta have been sunk, one of
them being about 125 feet deep. The
tunnels and drifts will easily aggre
gate over 1400 feet. A good deal of the
work is timbered, but most of it is sim
ply the rock walls. The timber that
is in is battered and worn as if it had
done duty in one shaft and then been
taken out and made to do duty in an
other. No ore has been hauled from
the dumps for milling, at least there
is no sign of such traffic. In what
shape the gold was obtained only the
two miners know.
At the first glance at Shoots on his cot
In the hospital I thought the old man

of firmness than Intelligence. A rather
high forehead, a Roman nose, a droop
ing mouth with a thin gray mustache
partly concealing it, and a head of
white hair made up his physio-rnomy.
One hand lay on top of the cover,
partly closed, as if clutching at some
thing. The other was concealed be
neath the quilt. The face was weather
beaten and freckled, and the visible
hand was scratched and bruised.
"He's not asleep," said the nurse. "If
you want to speak to him go right
ahead."
Hearing these words old man Shoots
opened his eyes and looked about
blankly. Then he motioned for me to
come near.
"Have you anything good in your
pocket?" he almost gasped, as I bent
over him.
"What do you mean?" I asked.
"Oh, you know well enough," he
snapped, as he turned over on his pil
low and refused to further enlighten
me as to what he meant by something
"good." His action and temper were
much more vigorous than I had ex
pected after seeing his pallid face on
the pillow.
For a long while he remained stub
bornly silent.
"I am going out to the mine to see
your partner," I said, after a number
of efforts.
"Tell him I want to see him," said
Shoots instantly. "Tell him to come to
day." â¢
"You fellows have a pretty good
mine out there," I ventured.
"Yes," replied the old man. "She's
pretty good."
"You've taken lots of gold out of It,
I suppose."
"Yes, quite a lot. And there's lots
more there. But you have to know how
to find it," the old man replied.
By degrees at last I mana o ed to get
a continuous story out of him. But in
doing so he made several statements
that he afterward modified or denied.
On things pertaining to the mine he
made contradictory statements, appa
rently not willing to have the real facts
known. In the course of his story he
said that he had not made a cent out
of his mine; then he would say that
there was plenty of gold there. .He said
he just worked it so as to have some
thing to do end have a home of his
own.
"It's a nice place to live out there in
the grove, where you can hear the wind
singing through the trees," he said,
wearily, and he looked as if he wished
himself out there again.
Briefly, Shoots' story was to the ef
fect that he was born in Kentucky 71
yean ago. At one time in the course
of his narrative he thought he had
been born in England, but finally con
cluded that it was Kentucky.
At any rate, after having been mar
ried twice he came from his native
State to California during the gold ex
citement and made one or two fortunes,
which he lost.
One day about twenty years ago he
was out hunting along the Cliff House
beach, where he struck a patch of black
sand. He thought it looked as if it
might contain gold, and he had some of
It assayed. The returns showed that
he had stumbled on a pocket of the
precious metal. That solitary pocket
yielded him a fortune. He then began
prospecting along the ocean beach, but
with poor success.
It then struck him that the gold must
come from the hills beyond, and he be
gan prospecting back until he struck
his mine.
Then he built a house and made him
self a home, where he lived until the
other day, when his sickness compelled
his removal to the County Hop- ital.
"But I wish you'd go out and tell my
partner to come and see me. Tell him
to bring me something," the old man
called after.
Out in the vicinity of the mining
camp I found the neighbors greatly
divided in their o-pinion as to whether
any gold was ever taken out of the
mine on the hilltop.
"Yeu bet they made money," said
one. "Haven't I seen 'em spend it."
"They never made a bean," said an
other.
"They're a couple of beggars," said a
third, while a fourth wanted to organ
ize an expedition to go- and dig for
buried treasure, it being his opinion
that they had a "sack hidden some
where."
From all that could be learned it is
only about three years since it became
known that there was a mine on the
hilltop. It was thought that Shoots
and his partner were simply a couple
of cranks who chose that method of
living. And when it became known
that the men were working a gold mine
many of the neighbors thought It a
good Joke and were Inclined to do a lit
tle chaffing.
Of course those who held to the Idea
that both Shoots and his partner had
made money out of the mine by digging
gold and selling it had different opin
ions as to how the precious metal was
obtained. No one entertained for even
a moment the idea that the gold was
extracted by any of the well known
and tried processes. All were of the
opinion that it was a secret held by the
two men.
The belief entertained by most of
Shoots' old neighbors and friends was
that some sort of chemical process was
made use of. These held to the theory
that the two men, being old miners,
had discovered how to select small
pieces of rock that contained a high
percentage of gold. They then "work
ed" these by their secret method and
either extracted the gold entirely or
else reduced it to such small bulk that
it could be taken to a refinery without
attracting the attention that a wagon
load of ore would.
This is. not without the bounds of
possibility. In fact, it is highly proba
ble and fully in accord with the state
ment of old man Shoots: "There is
lots of gold there, but you have to
know how to find.it."
Did he know how to find it, and will
anybody else ever k^>w how to find it,
are questions the neighbors are eagerly
asking.
One of the oldest residents of the vi
cinity, who has known of Shoots ever
since he came to live out near Ingle
side, is fully convinced that the two
men took comfortable sums of gold out
of their mine. "But," said this man,
"they didn't get the gold in the usual
way. It's my opinion that they found
the gold in a certain kind of rock and
in small nuggets. In this way they
could take out quite good sized pilea
and nobody ever be the wiser.
"My reason for believing this," con
tinued the man after a pause, "is be
cause I have known of similar cases.
I used to mine n^yself, a good many
years ago. This was when I was dig
ging along the Sacramento. A young
fellow came into our camp and went to
work in an old shaft and tool: out con
siderable metal. Nobody could ever
tell how he did it. Dozens of us went
into his mine and looked around, and
even prospected there a little when he
was away, but couldn't find any gold.
Nobody ever could but him and he al
ways found plenty."
Shoots and his partner were not a
bit interested in the affairs ol the world.
They had a wholesome fear "that in
some way they would lose their mine,
and a few days aero this was taken ad
vantage of by a car conductor. Seeing
Demott in the re.-ad, he called to him
and said that the United States was at
war with Spain. Demott was horror
stricken and asked for particulars.
â¢â¢Why," said the conductor, "the
Spanish fleet is Just off the Farallonea
and is going to bombard this part of
the country. They will blow up your
mine sure."
Instantly Demott's face paled and he
ran off through the woods like a fright
ened deer to tell his partner. In con
nection with this it is interesting to
note that Shoots was taken to the
County Hospital a few days later. OnÂ©
of the first questions he asked after
being put In bed was whether the Uni
ted States was at war with Spain. He
said he had heard so, but could hardly
believe it.
After learning the exact location of
the mine I climbed the hill, expecting
to interview Demott. I found the cabin
where the men lived, a cozy enough
little place. It was deserted. A couple
of dogs, tied up, barked at me at first
and then whined piteously. Several
chickens came running from the trees
and a brood of young ones chirped
loudly, as if they were hungry.
I walked about in hopes of finding
Demott. I looked down the old mining
shafts and saw the tunnels disappear
ing in the darkness. I examined the
"ore" on the dump. But nowhere could
I find a trace of anybody having been
there for several days.
Going back to the cabin, I examined
the lock of the door and found a spider
had spun his web over it.
Near the Ingleside track I questioned
the neighbors as to when they had last
seen Demott. No one had seen him
since the day that Shoots was taken to
the County Hospital. He had come
back that evening, but had not been
seen since. Inquiry at two of his old
haunts brought no more information.
But the mine, with its machinery,
timbers, etc., is all there.
Can any one find gold there in good
paying quantities as Shoots has dona
for the past seventeen years? Shoots
says there la plenty there, but that
"you've got to know how to find it."18
PENSIONS IN THE PRESENT WAR
THE number of pensioners of the
wax of 1898 will probably be less
in proportion to the number en-
I in the conflict than the
pensioner* of the Civil War. My
opinion is based on a knowledge of the
precautions being taken by the sur
geon general of the army to provide
against fraud in pension claims.
The surgeon general of the army tells
me that not only are the recruits being
examined carefully before being ac
cepted for service but that they will be
examined with the same care before
they are mustered out. In this way the
War Department will make a record
of the condition of each man when his
service is over and will be able to spot
a fraudulent claim for disability.
This system has been used already
with great success in the .case of en
listed men in the regular army. Each
regiment has a surgeon and two as
sistants. Then there are trained hos
pital steward;'. There should be a very
perfect record of all the cases of men
who suffer from disease or wounds in
the army.
Our agent finds there are many
fraudulent cases of disability growing
out of the Civil Wkr. Then the sur
geon general of the army tells me that
they can cure any case of hernia, for
example, by a simple, operation But,
he says, a great many men refuse to
take the treatment because they would
rather draw a pension than be cured.
This refers to enlisted men wn i
now in the service who are pensioned
under the gen iral law.
A special law will not be needed to
pension the men who suffer from
wounds or In thÂ« present war;
The pension of an enlisted man in
jured in a fight with the Spaniards in
Cuba or Manila is from $6 to 5100 a
month for disability contracted in the
Bervice of hie â¢ â  untry.
AÂ«soldier wh mes back from Cuba
or* Manila with both hands shot off will
draw $100 a month.
A soldier who loses his eyesight en
tirely will be entitled to $100 a month-.
A soldi â¢!' who loses both legs will get
$72 a month.
If he loses one arm or one leg he will
get $2 I or $45, according to the
where his leg or arm was cut off.
The pensions of naval men are in
creased by the prize money obt :
during the war. That constitutes a
fund, the interest on which gives naval
men an addition to their pensions; but
this sum cannot exceed 50 per cent of
the pension allow cd.
In the case of the men who first lost
their livesâ the men on the Winslowâ
the Government will probably act as
follows:
The young ensign who died for his
WHAT THE AMERICAN CARTOONISTS THINK OF THE WAR
country was not married, I believe. If
he had a mother dependent on him her
pension would be $16 a month. If no
dependent mother, but a depeadent
father, he would get a pension of $16.
Following in their order, in default of a
father, the pension would go to a de
pendent brother or a dependent sister
or to orphan brothers or sisters not yet
16 years of age.
The pensions increase in amount with
the rank of the officer.
If the officer left a widow she would
be entitled to $16 a month, and if any
children they would get $2 a month un
til the youngest of them was 16. If the
widow should marry or die her pension
would go to the children until the
youngest was 16. This is the pension
rate for the family of a lieutenant.
The widow of an enlisted man would
draw $12 and her minor children $2
each
We have some curious claims coming
to us in connection with the law grant
ing pensions to minor children. I have
an illustration in my desk of the injus
tice which may be done the Govern
ment by a tc-o liberal construction of
the pension laws. Here is the record of
a claim made on behalf of the children
of a soldier of the Civil War. This man
was in the Missouri Home Guards. He
served two months. In the same year<
he died. Thirty years afterward his (
widow filed a claim for herself and
children. <
The youngest of those children was*
born before the war began and was<
therefore more than thirty years old<
when the claim was filed. That child
is nearly forty years old now. The'
mother died before her claim was ad-<
justed. The claims of the children for<
back pensions aggregate $4500. The law<
as it has been construed in some cases (
would give them that amount. But I'
don't believe that was the intent of<
the law. . <
Basing an estimate on the numberj
of pensioners made by the Civil War,,
how great an additional pension list 1
can we expect in the natural course of'
events from the war of IS9S? <
That question depends upon a goodj
many conditions, of course. In the last,
war there were 2,772,000 men enlisted,
according to the official reports. Col- 1
onel Ainsworth estimates that there 1
were 2.10'). 000 men actually in service, i
To-day there are 990,958 pensioners, of (
whom about 745,000 are veterans. There (
are. you see, more than a third of the
who took part in the Civil War 1
â  m the pension roll. i
If 250,000 troops take part in the ope- (
rations in Cuba and the Philippines, in (
the ordinary course, of events it is to be
expected that 85.000 will be on the pen- 1
sion roll thirty-five years hence. Buti
of < ourse the number of veterans of the.
Civil War now drawing pensions does
not measure the list. A great many
i veterans have died. (
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 29, 1898.
The average pension drawn by the
veterans of the Civil War is $133 a year.
The average pensioH under the general
i law which applies to soldiers of the war
of 1898 is $165 a year. If one-half of the
men who go into the army now are
eventuaHy put on the -pension list, put
ting the number at 250,000, th-e aggre
gate of pensions should not be more
than $20,625,000 at any time.
The pension list of the Civil War will
take $148,000,000 this year.
As I said, an estimate must be taken
.with many allowances, because so
much depjmds on conditions. If Con
gress should follow my recommenda
tion and limit the pensions to widows
to those who were the pensioners' wives
when the pensions were allowed, there
: would be a big saving. We pensioned
: five or six widows of the War of 1812
last year. At that rate we shall be
granting pensions to widows of the
war of 1897 in 1984.
This administration is not granting
fewer pensions than the last. In the
ten months just past we granted 45.000
new pensions. In the twelve months
ending June 30 last, which included
four months of my term, the number
granted was 40.000. But the number of
pensions should see U natural decrease
WAY THE VOLUNTEERS WILL BE EXAMINED
When Mustered In jand Mustered Out of the Army.
3 BY SURGEON-GENERAL STERNBERG, U. S. A. \
1 ~n "T O arrangements have been made
' \ I for the examination of the men
1 \| when they are mustered out, but
âº it is the intention that they shall
> be examined so there shall be no
>doubt about their physical condition
Hvhen they leave the army. At present
Â»we are fully occupied passing on the
ireeruits.
) There is no ground ior the complaint
kthat our examination has been too
kStricl and has shut out some good men.
kThere are plenty of good sound men in
.the country and there is no reason why
we should not have them. Here are the
conditions necessary in a recruit:
* A tolerably just proportion between
'the different parts of the trunk and
'members; a well-shaped head, thick
'hair, a countenance expressive of
>health, with a lively eye; skin not too
> white; lips red; teeth white and in good
voice Btrong; skin firm; ;
chest well formed; belly lank; limbs ]
'muscular; feet arched and of moderate i
>length; hand large. The gait should i
now and the amount appropriated for
pensions should be less and not greater,
as it will be this year.
I had an amusing experience with a
pension fraud not long ago. The son
in-law of a Pennsylvania Congressman
came to me to complain that his house
hold was being disorganized by the
visits of one of my special agents to his
colored cook. The agent was inquiring
into the case of Mary Butler.
Now his cook, he said, knew nothing
about Mary Butler, but my agent had
got her so worked up that she was not
fit for anything about the house. He
described the agent to me and I said
I knew the young man was all right
and suggested that he have his cook
tell all she knew about Mary Butler.
He went away insisting that she didn't
know anything.
' A few days later the woman con
â¢â  fessed. It was the case of a soldier
i who died nearly thirty years ago. He
had no wife but' an enterprising pen
; sion attorney fitted a widow to him and
she began to draw a pension. After a
time the woman died, but the agent
found another to take her place. Then
the second woman died and the ag-ent
found a third. The third woman was
imy friend's cook. It was not surpris
be sprightly and springy, speech
prompt and clear and manner cheerful.
All lank, slight, puny men, with con
tracted figures, whose development is,
nr- it were, arrested, should be set aside.
The reverse of the characteristics of a
good constitution will indicate infirm
health or a weakly habit of body;
loose flabby, white skin; long cylin
drical neck; long, flat feet; very fair
complexion; fine hair; wan, sallow
countenance, etc.
Before his examination the recruit
must be "washed with sc-ap and wat
er." He must be examined nude, and
the following points must be noted:
That he has the free use of his limbs;
that his chest is ample; that his hear
ing, vision and speech are perfect; that
he has no tumors or ulcerated or ex
tensively cicatrixed legs; no rupture or
chronic cutaneous affection; that he
has not received any contusion or
wound of the head that may impair his
faculties; that he is not a drunkard;
is not subject to convulsions, and has
no infectious or other disorder that may
unlit him for military service. Inquiry
is also made concerning the parentage
ing that the visits of the agent upset
her.
The pension laws are all right. It
is the construction of the pension
laws that has made so much trouble. I
believe that if the pension laws had
been construed correctly from the be
| ginning the Government would be pay-
I ing out about half the amount it mnv
I spends for pensions and the pensioners
would be better satisfied. The soldier
is never allowed to settle down to the
calm enjoyment of his pension.
No sooner does his case go through
the Pension Office than he gets a no
tice from an agent â mind, from an
agent at Washington, the capital of the
country â saying that the agent has ex
amined his case and believes that he is
entitled to more. The pensioner puts in
an application for an increase and
grows impatient because he does not
hear from it. In this way the pension
ers are kept in a continual state of un
rest.

There was no examination of the men
mustered out at the end of the CivilC
War. The result of this neglect wasg
that millions have been spent by the-
Government investigating the cases of* 1
men who have claimed that their deaf-C

disease was due to exposure while theyg
were in the servi.e. No doubt most "f
these claims were made in good faith,

THE SPANISH SOLDIER
AS A FIGHTER
By R. SCALLAN, Late Lieut. of Royal Artilery
THE Spanish soldier, as described
by those who have seen him in
his den, is a small, lissom, al- j
most puny being, and presents a
picture the reverse of inspiriting. \
As he slouches along on trie march, un- â 
kempt, unshorn and tatterdemalion, -the ,
sight of him in the ranks would break j
the heart of an English or German j
martinetâ than \vh9m there is no great
er stickler for form and appearance on j
the face of this earth, or at least the
writer has never seen a greater.
But to come back to our Spaniard
huge hempen sandals encase his often j
soekless feet, his trousers are frayed
and threadbare, his ill-fitting tunic
hangs limp and loose for want of but
tons here and there and his cap, if he
boasts one, is flung carelessly on the
back of his head. Huge woolen gloves
of a bright green hue, and sadly in need
if darning, endeavor to conceal the
scanty length of the tunic sleeves, but
two or three inches of a brown sinewy
arm insist on peeping forth at the least
exertion. His rifle is carried anyhow â
sometimes at the trail, sometimes at
the slope, and often slung behind his
back, but always in a different position
to that of his neighbor in the ranks.
The order is invariably a straggle and
the formation is more easily gxiessed at
than identified by one accustomed to
the sharp, quick movements and
straight serried ranks of more discip
lined troops. '.
Yet withal the Spanish soldier is a
good fighter when brought to bay, as
many a bloody field has attested. In
guerrilla warfare his fame is pre-emin
ent, and amidst the greatest privations,
he bears his hard lot cheerfully and
uncomplainingly. Notwithstanding his '
force to hold it out almost at arm's
length while he danced. The specta
cle tickled Bismarck immensely, and,
as the Frenchman came sailing majes
tically along, Bismarck . stepped for
ward and dropped a coin into the hat.
A duel was one of the next day's
events. Though it was with pistols,
Bismarck escaped unhurt, while his
adversary was wounded.
shuffling gait he seems never to tire or*
the march, and in brief is In many re
spects a worthy and dangerous foe.
On the field of Igualada, one of the
fiercest fights of the late Carlist war,
a loyal regiment that had no choice be
tween annihilation and surrender un
hesitatingly chose the former and al
lowed itself to be mercilessly butch
ered, though not without rendering a
good account of the enemy, whose vic
tory was purchased at an enormous
sacrifice.
In the matter of food the Peninsular
soldier is easily satisfied and no great
charge on the commissariat. Two
meals a day suffice him, and those are
scanty enough. In some "smart" corps
coffee and soup are allowed early in the
morning, but the average soldier feeds
only at 9 a. m. and again at 5 p. m.
One and a half pounds of bread, and
black at that, is the entire ration al
lowed per day by the Government. Any
additional luxuries (save the mark:)
must be purchased out of his own
pocket at the regimental canteen,
which is kept by a civilian, though the
prices are kept within reasonable
bounds by a regimental committee.
The private eats little or no meat, es
pecially when on active service, and to
this is" attributed the wonderful recu
perative power of Spanish soldiers,
their wounds healing extremely easily
and rapidly. On the march our Don is
satisfied with a chunk of dry black
bread, a little oil and a clove or two of
garlic, the whole washed down by a
modest allowance of water.
Truly a fighting ration that the
American soldier would find it hard to
stomach! No wonder the typical Span
lard is lean and evil smelling and un
wholesome lookine!
If two tuning forks of the samp pitch
are placed faring; each other the one

distinctly audible note.WITH THE ROUGH RIDERS IN CAMP AT TAMPA, FLORIDA

Bleepy little town, which for a cen

its staid inhabitants never dreamed
possible and has done more business in

in its history.
On all sides of it, and down the long
neck of sand which stretches to the
Gulf, and ends at Port Tampa, the
white tents of the cavalry, Infantry and
artillery dot the landscape, or glimmer
like clouds, amid the dark green fol

of this tented city is more than fifteen

EVER SAILED FROM THE UNITED STATES
TO A FOREIGN LAND.
It Came to California, Then Under Mexican Rule, Around Cape Horn in 1846. The Soldiers Were Six Months on Sailing Vessels,
and They Settled Here After the War
THE Stevenson regiment of vol
unteera that sailed from New
York in 1846, bound for Han
iTrancisco, was the first army
ever sent by the United States
to .subjugate and occupy a foreign ter
ritory, it had never occurred before
in the history of the world that a de
tafiiTiient/of soldiers had been sent so
far to reach th<- country of the enemy.
Then the American Government
reached westerly across the continent
to seize a. province that had been a
Spanish possession.
In 1898, fr.,m the same port that was
entered by the invading troops in 1846,
the second American army sails, as
the first did, to the wc-st to occupy re
mote territory. The span of the two
expeditions will reach half around the
globe in a direct line, but when dis
tance is considered there must be add
ed the circuitous route around Cape
Horn that was traversed by the army
of 1846â a trip of over 1T., 000 miles, oc
cupying six months by the sailing yes-
Bels that were employed as transports.
With fleet and comfortable steam
ships to traverse less tempestuous seas,

will strike him as unique and abso

festooned with Spanish moss, screened
from the sight of casual passersby, arc
a body of hardy, rough riders, all of
whom are American or European born,

When the war broke out between the
United States and Mexico, California
w;is an outlying province of the latter
country- Its resources were undevel
oped. The" little that was known of the
fertility of Its soil was within the
knowledge of the padres who con
ducted the missions. If they had
suspicion of its mineral wealth
the secret was carefully guard
ed. Its export commerce was
CoYiflned to hides and tallow that
collected at a frw seaport towns
and bartered to trading vessels owned
by merchants in Boston.
In the cvint of war there was an un
dprstandir.p between Mexico and Eng
land that the province would be seized
by the latter country, and a British
warship, under the command of Ad
miral Seymour, was stationed at Maz
atlan prepared to make the seizure at
the first intimation of hostilities.
But the 'iovernment at Washington
prepared for a checkmate, and the
capture of Monterey by Commodore
Sloat was the beginning of the end of
the American conquest of California.
The country was then held by our na

this force of men in order that he may
do a little Cuban campaigning and see
some excitement. His name is William
Ast<>r ( 'hanler.
Mr. Chanler's chief officer Is Grover
Flint, who. through an experience of
several years' campaigning in Cuba
with General Gomez, Is ably fitted to
direct such an expedition as Mr. Chan
!>r has organized.
I visited their camp a few days ago
with my camera and found the trip
well worth the trouble. The detach
ment of men under Mr. Chanler's com
mand are all of herculean build, and
every man is an athlete. Not only
that, but every one of them has seen
service in pome army or another, irÂ»
various parts of the world, and not ona
of them knows what physical fear
means. The Impedimenta is re
duced to a minimum and Is the exact
counterpart of that used by the Cu
bans on the island.
A hammock of strong canvas, slung
between two trees, forms the bed. Over
this, supported by a lariat, a yard
above the hammock, is spread a
"poncho" or storm blanket of stout
canvas, waterproofed. This forms their
only tent. The ponchos are a pro
tection against both rain and sun, and

It was early in the spring of 1840 that
President Polk directed the organiza
tion of a volunteer regiment in the
State of New York for duty in Cali
fornia â a body to be selected with
great cart* and with the design that
tin- volunteers should be discharged in
this country ut 'ie close of the war
and form the nucleus of its American
colonization.
The regulations provided that all re
cruits should be surgically examined,
and BO strict were the examining sur
geons that out of 800 men who were at
first presented 150 were rejected, but
within two days over 500 applications
were- made for the vacancies. When
completed very few members of the
regiment were over 21 years of age,
and no married men excepting those
whose wives accompanied the regiment
as laundresses were accepted. The au
thority to raise the regiment and its
command was given to Colonel Jona

Tin' transport fleet consisted of the
ships Thomas H. Perkins. Loo Choo,

cers and ali, P44 men. The fleet was

the hammocks, suspended above the
ground, keep them from malarial In
fluences of the wet soil. Another lariat
stretched between two trees near by
and about two feet from the ground
supports all the carbines and rifles of
the command. Another poncho, spread
very close to the ground and kept wei,
covers the cases of provisions and keeps
them fresh and sweet for an indefinite
time.
The same tree upon which the owner
fixes his belongings also serves as a
tether-pin for his horse, which, at
tached to the end of a long lariat,
browses off the leaves of the ground

prevails here.
Over at one corner of the grove, and
invariably on that side farthest from
the direction of the coast, is the camp
kitchen. Its smoke always blows away
from the campâ a .little trick the Cuban <
campaigners are*expert at perfecting â
and there, gathered about the fire, when
I visited 1 the camp, were half a dozen
bronzed, brawny men preparing food
for the evening meal.
Mr. Chanler and his officers were en
tertaining some ladies who had come
to see the camp, and for their delecta
tion and my own amusement agreed
to assemble his troop and show us
some rough riding. No- bugle Is used In
this command. A sharp command ut
tered in not much more than a natural
tone was instantly taJien up by a
trooper seated against a tree half a
dozen yards away. He passed It along,
and in less than a minute men had
sprung from hammocks, horses were
untied, saddles thrown on and cinched,
and the lithe, active men were mounted
nnd formed.
At the command of "Forward" the
horses leaped out at a gallop and fairly
charged to a point within half a score
of yards from Mr. : Chanler's position,
when the line halted a.s suddenly as if
it had encountered a stone wall. With
a grace that can come only from long
practice, the commander vaulted into
the saddle and with a quiet command,
which was instantly obeyed, the column
swung off at a gallop, forming twos as
they went.
Another command, and with a wheel
as sudden as it was unexpected, the.
line chai'ged fairly at the ladies, who
were seated among the trees at head
quarters. The broad, heavy blades of
the machetes flashed , from their
sheaths and circled the air with a thrill
ing swish that was really dramatic.
The ladies screamed, and were about
to take to flight when the plunging
steeds reined up with a jerk at their
very feet, the rough riders saluted with
their machetes, and gracefully bowing
turned like a flash and were off like the
wind. v?. ; ; '
Through the trees they went, forming
into two squadrons as they rode. One
bore off toward the south and the other
toward the north. They were too far
away to hear the command, but turned
suddenly and dashed at each other,
riding like centaurs. The machetes
leaped out as the lines closed in. and
when they came together there was a
clash of steel that was positively fierce.
It was real, too, for the men wore no
masks or other protection, and one of
them had the end of his nose split as
neatly as a surgeon could have done it.
The wounded member was plastered
up by skilled hands, and the incident
was dropped with Mr. Flint's remark:
â¢'He should have j remembered his I in
structions about guarding and he
wouldn't have been touched. He won't
be again."
Wheeling, circling, yelling and riding
with a positive' abandon that can be
seen nowhere else, the men showed
how practically impossible it would be
for a foot soldier to defend himself
from a machete charge. No one who
has never seen it can form any idea <'t
its impetuous . dash and irresistible i
fierceness.
The fatal machete blow is delivered
downward, at an angle of about 45 de
grees, and usually lands on the side
and back of the victim's neck. He may
be a superb fencer with rapier or saber,
but he knows no guard that will avail
against this blow.
"It is a remarkable fact," said Mr.
Flint, who has seen many a Spaniard
after the machete has done its work,
"that almost every one struck at all is
struck on } the side and back of the ,
neck. The blow almost severs the head
from the body." .' .
I had little regard for the machete
as a soldier's [ weapon until I saw | it
used by these \ men. Army officers who
have seen it have, to a considerable
number, armed, themselves: privately
with the murderous cornknife of the
Cubans. Strange t6 say, the machete
is not made in Cuba or Spain, but in
Hartford, â¢ Conn. Aside ; from these
weapons, this force is armed with-six
shooters and either 45 caliber carbines,
Winchester 1 30-40 1 rifles t or i the - Mauser
rifle. They are all crack shots and ex- : -]
Derts -with" the pistol. i
GETTING LICKED INTO SHAPE.
The Sixth United States Cavalry is
encamped in a pine woods about a mile
from Chanler's camp. This regiment
includes among its troopers those mar
velous Cossack riders who electrified
New York audiences some months ago
at Madison Square Garden at the mili
tary tournament. A Troop, in com
mand of Captain H. P. Kingsbury,
ably seconded by Lieutenant W. C.
Short, is famous throughout the army
for the daring of its riders. F Troop of
the Third Cavalry, encamped in an ad
joining grove. Captain G. A. Dodd, is
another equally noted troop of cossack
riders; so the rivalry between them is
marked to a degree.

several of his men' to show what could

mounting and dismounting at a charge.
vaulting entirely over a running horse,
or vaulting from the ground, alighting
on the horse's back and facing to the
rear, wheeling on fore feet.' wheeling on
hind feet, etc., were rapidly executed
by these men, and they appeared to eiw
joy it.
The drill, when completed by a troops
or, gives him entire and absolute com
mand of his mount. The horses are
trained to do everything and the entire
troop will move sidewise at a trot â an
almost improbable thing to imagine,
yet it is true. The entire troop will
charge over fences, ditches or hurdles,
with the men standing upriedH in the
saddles. Every horse will lie down in
stantly at word of command and thus
a force of cavalry in the woods can be
concealed until an enemy approaches
within a few yards.
One of the most difficult feats, one
well worth illustrating, was performed
by one of the men riding at a gallop
over very rough ground. He handled
two horses, both spirited steeds, and
rode bolt upright, standing fairly in
the saddles, one foot on each animal.
Another pretty effect, which shows
the perfect control of the riders over
their mounts, is shown in the picture
presenting the three stages of the horse
roiug down. The intelligent animals
will all go to their knees and remain
there, with the cavalrymen mounted,
until told to lie down.
Another pretty picture was afforded
by a trooper holding the head of his
pet, which reclined comfortably on the
ground while the photograph was
made. Some of the men in A Troop
will vault entirely over three horses
running abreast, from the ground.
Every man in the troop is an athlete,
and every one an expert with saber,
revolver and carbine. Captain Kings
bury certainly has a troop to be proud
of. W. J. ROUSE.

THE AMERICAN SAILOR AS & FIGHTER.
| S~\ APTAIN PHILO NORTON Mc
â¢ GIFFIN made a great name for
/ I himseif in the famous naval bat-
V_>/tle of the Yalu between the Chi
nese and Japanese. He fought on
the Chen Yuen, the flagship of the Chi
nese squadron, and his courage, re
source and steadfastness in that ter
rific conflict of ironclads are matters of
history.
The shock of the engagement com
pletely shattered his health, and he re
turned *n this country. For a time he
tried different physicians and hospi
tals, and at last completely worn out
and despondent, he shot himself with
a pistol in an Eastern hospital.
MiGiffin was about 34 years of age "i
the time of the battle of Yalu. He was
a graduate of Annapolis, but the bill of
1882 reducing the navy "squeezed" him
out. General Grant gave him a very
warm letter of recommendation to Vice
roy Li Hung Chang, and young Mc-
Giffin went to the Orient to seek his
fortune.
My Dear Stahle: I must apologize
for leaving your welcome letter so long
unanswered. I have been ten years
now without leave, save a few months
in Japan and a few weeks in America,
when I was in England to bring out
the cruiser Chen Yuen; so I was very
much run down. However, I could not
â well go, as I am director (superintend
ent a la C. R. P. Rodgers) of the new
naval college, and I did not wish to
leave until my first class was gradu
ated. That was in June, and I had six
months' leave on full pay given me,
â¢when up came this bad Jap biz. The
Viceroy didn't ask me to stop, but I
thought it mean to go in such a crisis,
co I volunteered to stay and leave the
college for the time to my senior in
structor and go afloat, which was glad-
Jy accepted.
The Chinese don't go in for doctors
much â more's the pity. Both in the
army and navy we need 'em badly -
only one â foreignâ to our fleet here of
fifteen and more big ships, besides the

TO McGlffin's bravery was due the
fact that the Chinese saved at
least one of their ironclads from
the terribly destructive fire of the
Japanese rapid-firing and heavy guns.
McGiffln, in command of the Chen
Yuen, was in the hr.-ttest part of the
contest. The ship was struck repeat
edly by shells. She caught fire no less
than eight times, but every time the
Europeans on board of her managed to
put the fire out.
Here is the way McGiffin tells of his
thrilling experiences:
In helping to put out one of these
fires I was wounded. The fire was for
ward of the forecastle, and there was
1 such a fierce fire sweeping the deck be
| tween it and the fore-barbette that the
officer whom I ordered to go and put
lit out declared that it was impossible
to get there alive, so I had to go my
; self.
I called for volunteers and got sev
eral splendid fellowsâ some of our best
! men, unhappily, for nearly all were
; killed, but we got the fire under.
The fire was on the port side, and as
'the starboard fore-barbette gun was
[firing across it I sent orders that it was
only to fire on the starboard side, but
as bad luck would have it the man
who received the orderâ the Number
One of the gunâ had his head shot off
just after I had gone forward and his
successor did not know of it.
As I stooped to pick up the hose a
shell, or a fragment, passed between
my wrists, grazing each. Shortly after
ward I heard a loud explosion, and saw
a brilliant, light behind me, and was
knocked down.
I lay unconscious for a while â how
long, I do not know. I believe it was
the flame from the gun which I had or
dered to- fire only on the starboard side,
but it may have been a shell exploding,
though if so I ought to have been
blown to pieces. Any how, I was pretty
badly burned.
When I came to, I sat up, leaning on
my elbow, and found myself looking
almost down the tube of the great gun.
pointing straight at me. I saw the end
move a little to one side, then to the
other, up a little, then down, and I
waited for yearsâ a fraction of a sec
ond, no doubtâ for the gun to fire, for I
knew that the gunner had taken aim.
Then it suddenly occurred to me to
make an effort. I rolled over on my
side and by great good fortune, down
a hatchway, some eight feet or so, on to
a heap of rubbish, which broke my
fall. As I fell I heard the roar of the
big gun. ___________^___
THE EXECUTIONER OF SPAIN.
Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton, in a re
cent sermon in All-Souls' Protestant
Episcopal Church, in New York, de
clared that this country has l.een ap
pointed the executioner of Spain. A
part of his sermon was as follows:
"Spain's Nemesis is overtaking her.
The long story of Spain's rapacity and
extortion, of her oppression and cruelty,
of her treachery and perfidy, is reach
ing its culmination. The cup of woe is
at last filled to overflowing, and is even
now being pressed to her lips. And the
hand which is ordained to hold that cup
to her lips is the hand of America.

THE NEW YORK, ADMIRAL SAMPSON'S FLAGSHIP, FIRING ITS FIRST GUN,
FROM A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN BY A KEY WEST PHOTOGRAPHER.
Exciting Life on the Flagship New York
in Cuban Waters.
WHILE it lasted, life on board
the ilagrship New York during
the blockade was full of the
most novel and picturesque
Incidents, and the change to
the heat and dust and inac
tion of this base of military operations
is painful in comparison. There is all
the difference between the deck of a
warship cleared for action and a hotel
piazza filled with ladies in summer
frocks and officers in straw hats, en
gaged in reading newspapers one day
old.
On the warship there were also all
the comforts of civilization, all the lux
uries of a yachting cruise, but there
was none of its ennui and boredom. For
if something was not happening, there
was always the expectation that it was
about to happen. Every column of
smoke on the horizon suggested a pos
sible Spanish gunboat, or certainly a
blockade runner, and many times each
day and night the bells in the engine
room would sound "full steam ahead"
and every glass on the ship would be
turned to the flying stranger. Some
times the .New York let her escape,
only to run into the jaws of the war
ship on the next station, but almost in
variably the flagship raced after her
throwing shells across her bows, until
she backed her engines and showed
her colors and a boarding officer went
over her Bide.
The discipline of the New York was
rigid, intelligent and unremitting, and
each of the five hundred men on this
floating monastery moved in his little
groove with the perfect mechanism of
one of the 8-inch guns. A modern war
ship is the perfection of organization.
It is the embodiment of the axiom that
"a stitch in time saves nine."
It is the eternal vigilance which ob
tains that keeps her what she is, the
hourly fight agaii.st rust and dust that
makes her always look as though she
had just been made complete that
morning. All the old homely sayings
seem to be the mottoes of her execu
tive. There is "a place for everything
and everything in its place," whether
it is a projectile weighing half a ton
or signal flag No. 22. or a roll of lint for
the surgeon, or the bluejacket in charge
of the searchlight.
A ship of war is like a moving vil
lage. It has to house and feed and give
employment to its inhabitants, and to
place them at certain points at a mo
ment's notice, to face unknown condi
tions and to face them coolly find in
telligently. You can imagine the con
fusion in a villaee of five hundred
people should they be dragged out of
bed at midnigrht by an alarm of fire.
But in the floating villaere <>f the war
ship New York discipline and training
have taught the inhabitants to move
to certain places and to perform cer
tain work when they get there within
the space of two minutes. It is so on
every other war ship in the navy of the
United States. And it does not consist
entirely in manning a gun and pulling
a lanyard. That is the showy work,
the work that tells in the dispatches,
and which U illustrated in the weekiy
papers.
We had several calls to "general
quarters" at night. They were prob
ably the most picturesque moments of
the ten days spent on the flagship. To
the landsman one bugle call was like
another; "general quarters" meant no
more to me than the fact that the mail
was going ashore in ten minutes; it
was three sleeping Japanese stewards
who told me we were going into action.
Whenever I woke to find them in the
wardroom I knew some one was going
to fire off a four-inch gun.
They opened a hatch just beyond my
berth and pulled on a creaking ammu
nition hoist. They did this drowsily
and stiffly, with the clutches of sleep
still on their limb.; and heavy on their
eyelids. Then officers would run hy
buttoning tuni~s over white and pink
pajamas, and buckling on swords and
field glasses. Even below decks you
could hear tl.e great rush of water at
the bows and the thumping of the en
gines, that told the ship was at racing
speed, and when you had stumbled on
deck the wind sweeping past awoke
you to the fact that in two minutes
five hundred men had fallen out of
hammocks and into cutlasses and re
volvers, and that the ship was tearing
through the dark water in pursuit of
a bunch ot ,ights.
And then, shining suddenly from the
flying bridge and rising and reaching
out across *he waves, would shoot the
finger of the searchlierht. It showed
the empty waters, and the tossing
white caps in a p.ith of light. "To the
left!" a voice would cr.ll from the
height of the - rward bridge, and, as
thoi h it were a p rt of the voice the
light shifter. "No, higher!" the voice
would call aerain. and the obedient light
would rise, turning the glare of day
upon a half-mile more of troubled
water and exposing on its horizon a
white, frightened steamer, scudding at
full speed for her life. Sometimes she
backed, sometimes she changed her
course, but the light never loosened its
clasp. It gripped her like a thief held
in the circle of a pol :man's lantern.
It was like a cat playing with a
mouse, or a hound holding a fox by its
scent. In the silence of the great war
ship, where the darkness was so great
that the men crowded shoulder to
shoulder could not see each other's
faces, the blockade runner, exposed and
pointed out, and held up to our deris
ion, seemed the only living thing on the
surface of the waters. She was as con
spicuous as a picture thrown by a
stereopticon on a screen.
And then one of the forward guns
AN insidious ally to Spain is the bar
nacle. The United States warships
now busy in Cuban waters, which
are particularly favorable to the
growth of shellfish, are sure to
have their bottoms fouled by rank sea
growth, and probably the first use to
which they â¢will put the fine drydock at
Havana will be to clean them .off.
The barnacle loves a ship's bottom. It
attaches itself by means of a peduncle
ending In the barnacle proper, which
consists of five shelly valves inside a
general protective shell. It makes no ef
fort to improve on its first selection of a
home, because immediately it has made
its selection and becomes firmly at
tached, nature robs it of its eyesight.
Swinging backward and forward it ab
sorbs its food caught in several tenta
cles looking like fine feathers protruding
from the head. It spends the days
pleasantly in foreign travel till the dry
dock is reached, when it is unceremo
niously scraped off and sent to the ma
nure heap.
A tramp freighter engaged m the
Southern trade had eleven tons of bar
nacles removed from her sides at one
time exclusive of grass and other
growths. She had been in the v:ater
about one year.
Grass will only grow on the sides of
the ship, not beneath. Shellfish grow
all over. The waters a ship is saijine in
would speak, flashing in the night like
a rocket and lighting up the line of the
deck and the faces of the men, and it
would speak again and again. And
the flying steamer, helpless in the long
reaching clutch of the searchlight, and
hearing the shells whistle across her
br.-ws, would give up the race and come
to a standstill, sullen and silent.
The quarter of an hour during which
the firing lasted at Matanzas was of
interest in giving some knowledge of
how a warship in action acts upon her
self. With land forces the effect of
their fire upon the enemy is the only
thought; on the sea, in one of these
new inventions of warfare, the effect
of the batteries on the ship herself is
an added consideration.
To the civilian the effect was not so
tremendous as he had expected. He
had been told to stick cotton in his
ears, to stand on his toes and kee"p his
mouth open, a somewhat difficult and
ridiculous attitude in which to meet
death. As it happened the call to quar
ters came so unexpectedly that there
was no time to find any cotton, and, as
it turned out, there was no necessity to
stand on one's toes.
I received a cablegram while I was
on the New York, asking me to relate
how her crew behaved in the action at
Matanzas. I did not answer it.Jpecause
I thought there were a few thmgs the
American people were willing to take
for granted, and because the bombard
ment at Matanzas was no test of the
crew's courage but of its marksman
ship. There is a story, however, that
illustrates the spirit of the men on the
New York, and which answers, I think,
any queries any one may make as to
how they might behave in action.
Taylor, a young gunner's mate, was
shot on April 26 by a revolver. It was
an accident, but it is possible he was
more seriously hurt than were any of
the six wounded men who went
through the seven hours' battle at
Manila, for the ball passed through
his arm and into his right side, and
came out nearly a foot away under his
left armpit. Assistant Surgeon Spear
said that if he had tr'ed t" dodÂ«"Â» the
vital parts in Taylor's body with a
surgical instrument he could not have
done it as skillfully as did the bullet,
which was neither aimed nor guided
by a human hand.
It was this junior surgeon Spear who
performed the operation, while the fleet
surgeon, Dr. Gravatt, watched him and
advised. It was a wonderful operation.
It lasted nearly two hours, and it left
the layman uncertain as to whether he
should admire the human body more
or the way a surgeon masters it. What
they did to Taylor I cannot tell in tech
nical language; but I know that they
cut him open and lifted out his stomach
and put it back again and sewed him
up twice. He could not get wholly un
der the influence of the ether, and he
makes a difference. In the Bermuda trade
ships quickly gather a great deal of
grass and other marine plants, four and
five inches long, causing loss of two to
three knots per hour.
The use of various anti-fouHng compo
sitions to avoid these growths has had
uncertain success. Coasters that have
occasion to enter fresh-water lakes or
rivers foul very slowly. The fresh water
seems to kill off the shellfish and marine
growths. In the absence of drydocks to
dock our ships In the $outh it might be
a good idea to send them for a day or
two into the mouth of a near-by river.
To call a man a barnacle on board
ship is anything but complimentary.
Away back in 1597 the barnacle was sup
posed to be the embryo of a bird, and
there is a bird, the barnacle or bernicle
goose. _______ _â â â .
STEVENSON'S
REGIMENT.
Continued from Page Nineteen.
On the 26th of September, 1846, a por
tion of the regiment sailed from New-
York in the ships Perkins, Drew and
Loo Choo, followed a few months later
by the balance in the Brutus, Isabella
and Sweden.
raved and muttered and struggled, so
that at times two men had to hold him
down. Just before the surgeon began,
to operate the boy gave the chaplain
his mother's address, and reached out
his hand and said, "So long, chaplain."
He was a typical New York boy. He
came from Brooklyn, but nevertheless
he looked and talked and thought aa
you would expect and hope that an ap
prentice from the St. Mary's training
ship would look and talk and think.
His skin was as tough as a shoe which
had remained lons in the salt water,
but it was beautifully white and spot
less, like a girl's, and the contrast it
made with the skin that the sun and
wind had tanned was as sharp as the
stripes on the flag.
When the second part of him was
sown up Taylor was carried to a cot
and lay there so still that I thought he
was dead. They had to inject strych
nine into his veins to keep his heart
beating. But a minute later he opened
his eyes and turned them to the operat
ing table, where, he rememberd in a
half-drunken way, they had placed him
two hours before. His eyes were dazed
with the ether, his lips were blue and
his face was a ghastly gray. He looked
up at the four figures leaning over
him. their bare arms covered with his
blood, and back at the operating table
that dripped with it. What had hap
pened, who had attacked him, and why,
he could not comprehend.
He did not know that parts of him
which had lain covered for many years
had been taken out and held up naked,
palpitating and bleeding to the ruth
less light of the sun, to the gaze of
curious messmates crowded at the end
of the sick bay, that these parts of him
self had been picked over and handled
as a man runs his fingers over the keys
of a piano, and had then been pushed
and wedged back into place and cover
ed over as one would sew a patch on an
old sail, to lie hidden again for many
years more, let us hope.
He only knew that some outrageous
thing had been done to him â that he
had been in a nightmare; in hellâ and
to Taylor, still drunk with ether, these
men whose wonderful surgery had
saved his life were only the bloody as
sassins who had attempted it and
failed.
He was pitiably weak from loss of
much blood, from the shock of the
heavy bullet that had dug its way
through his body, from the waves of
nausea that swept over him, but the
boy opened his eyes and regarded the
surgeons scornfully. Then he shook his
head from side to side on the pillow and
smiled up at them.
"Ah, you can't kill me," he whis
pered. "I'm a New Yorker.
That is the spirit of the men who
sunk the Spanish" fleet at Manila.
RICHARD HARDING DAVIS,
Correspondent London Times, on board
the Flagship New York.
The Loo Choo arrived at San Fran
cisco on March 26, 1847, six months to
a day from New York. The Perkins
completed her voyage on March 6 and
the Susan Drew sailed into San Fran
cisco Bay on the 19th. The following
month the Brutus put in an appear
ance, and in February, IS4B, the Isa
bella and Sweden arrived at Monterey.
The average voyage of these vessels
was 165 days, and with the exception
of the Brutus the ships touched at
South American ports, thereby reliev
ing the mono-tony of the long and tedi
ous voyage.
Colonel Stevenson, the commander of
the regiment, was born on the first day
of this century, and died at San Fran
cisco February 14, 1894. The lieuten
ant-colonel was Henry S. Burton, who
was afterward a major-general of vol
unteers in the Civil War. James A.
Hardie was the major. He served as
brigadier-general in the Union army
during the rebellion. Among the staff
officers were William G. Marcy, the son
of the Secretary of War, J. C. Boi.ny
castle, who became an officer in the
regular army, and Joseph L. Folsom,
who was a prominent business man
and Federal officer in San Francisco
until his death in 1855.
WINFIELD J. D^v-tslHERE IS THE FAMOUS "WAR BOARD" THAT PLANS THE OPERATIONS OF OUR NAVY
In tte present crisis this War Board or Strategy Board is often in session all night at its headquarters at the Capitol, Washington, D. C. The member sitting at the left of the picture is Captain Crowninshield; next to him stands Rear Admiral Sicardi &
on his right sits Captain Mahan; at the end of the table is Captain Barker, and Secretary Long sits in the foreground.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May
25.â While the President and
the great majority of the
people of this nation are fast
asleep the War Board is
often in seÂ«sion at the Navy Depart
ment, devising ways and means to ap
prehend the Spanish fleet and put an
end to the war with Spain. Theoret
ically, the War Board never closes Its
eyes. It is on duty twenty-four hours
In the day and seven days in the week.
A visit to the Navy Department at
midnight is not accomplished without
some difficulty, as the entrances are
barricaded and only those who are
armed with official passes from Chief
Engineer George W. Baird, superin
â¢it of the building, are allowed to
enter after nightfall.
The handsomely finished interior of
the Navy 1 h-partment looks weird and
uncanny at midnight. The rooms,
whi< h in daylight are occupied by well
dressed, intelligent and generally effi
cient employes, are dark and deserted
at midnight- only two electric bulbs
gleam through the darkness of the long
marble tiled corridor. The footfalls of
ti.-> watchmen as they make their fre
quent rounds of the building echo and
re-echo in the stillness of the night.
Away up on the fourth iloor in the
spacious room of the naval library sits
the Naval War Board. The board con

card, Captain Alfred T. Mahan, Captain
A. S. Barker and Captain A. S. Crown

velt was president of the War
Ji'iard, but since his retirement from
the naval service, to assist in the com
mand of his now famous regiment of
rough riders, Secretary Long frequently
ta with the board.
]'.y a strange coincidence three of the
members of the board are New Yorkers
by birth. Rear Admiral Sicard was
born in New York, and entered the
navy in 1851 as midshipman appointed
from that State. His, first conspicuous
E<-rvioe was rendered with a blockading
squadron in 1N64 and 1865, at the bom

capture of New Orleans. Rear Admiral
Si card is an expert in heavy ordnance,
and it was largely due to his efforts
and energy that the ordnance depot
was established at the Washington
Navy Yard. His last command was the
X' nh Atlantic Squadron, previous to
which he had had a long and varied
experience in all parts of the world.
Throughout the navies of the world
Admiral Sicard is recognized as one of
the ablest ordnance officers of the pres
ent generation.
Captain Mahan is also a New Yorker
by birth. He saw distinguished service
on the old frigate Congress in 1861. In
addition to cruising all over the world
he has rendered distinguished service
as president of the War College and the
Torpedo School. He is also an authority
on the subject of sea power and its in
lluence upon history. He has written
a book on the subject which has added
to his fame as an authority on naval
warfare.
Captain Crowninshield, the distin
guished chief of the Bureau of Naviga
tion, claims New York as his birthplace.
He also rendered gallant and meritori
ous service with the North Atlantic
blockading squadron at the battle of
New Orleans. He participated in the
attack on Fort Fisher. Since the war
of the rebellion he has cruised with the
East India squadron and the European
fleet, and is also an expert on ordnance.
He commanded the 1 Kearsarge and was
also the commanding officer of the ill
fated Maine until he was relieved a
short time ago by Captain Sigsbee.
Captain Barker, the fourth member
of the board, is, like Secretary Long, a
Massachusetts? man. He was a con
spicuous participant in the blockading,
bombardment ;ind capture of New Or
leans during the Civil War. He has al

sea soundings around the world while
in command of the Enterprise. The
casts were made at intervals of 100
miles. Captain Barker, whose last com
mand was the battle-ship Oregon, Is
soon to retire from the War Board to
take command of the Newark, which
is being fitted out at the Norfolk Navy
Yard.
It will be seen from this brief out
line o-f the official record of the officers
composing the War Board that they
are peculiarly fitted for the grave re
sponsibilities resting upon them. All
of them have seen service and obtained
knowledge which only experience can
give in the art of conducting a naval
war. Their participation In the block
ading and bombardment of New (>r
leans, 'way back in the sixties, is right
in line with the work they., have in
hand in blockading Havana, prepara
tory to bombardment. It is apparent
that these officers were not selected for
this important duty without due con
sideration of their naval skill and per
sonal experience in the line of duty.
One of the most exciting and inter
esting night sessions of the board pc
curred a few days ago, when news came
that the Cape Verde fleet, which had
mysteriously disappeared from Cape
Vincent, was at the French island of
Martinique. The War Board was un
conscious of the presence of the Span
ish squadron on this side of the Atlan
tic The board had adjourned for the
day, and the members were in their
respective homes, probably dreaming
of meeting and conquering the Spanish
squadron. The news of the arrival of
the Spanish fleet at Martinique was
first conveyed to the President by a
Herald-Call man. It took but a few
minutes to transmit the anxiously
looked for information to Secretary
Long, and no time was lost in assem
bling a midnight session of the War
Board.
There was plenty of life and activity
in the Navy Department that night,
and bright lights gleamed from the
windows of the Secretary's office and
the rooms occupied by the Bureau of
Navigation until the sun came up from
til-- east and flooded the corridors with
natural light.
The War Board has exclusive sources
of information. It is in possession of

all the Information that comes through
the Bureau of Navigation, the State
Department, the War Department and
the executive mansion â in fact, every
suggestion of information bearing di
rectly or Indirectly upon the pending
conflict is promptly placed at the dis
posal of the War Board for such action
as may be deemed advisable. The prin
cipal source of information, however.
Is the Bureau of Navigation, over
which Captain Crowninshield pre
sides.
The chief of the Bureau of Naviga
tion is practically the commanding offi
cer of the navy. He regulates the de
tails of officers and directs the move
ments of vessels; hence he is in a po
sition to knoAV the exact location of
every vessel, great and small, in the
United States navy. He is also Bup
posed to be familiar with the personnel
of all the ships, as all orders of details
are promulgated by him. It is the first
duty of the commander of every ship to
notify the chief of navigation T/t his ar
rival in port, at home or abroad.
In the Bureau of Navigation a record
of the arrival and departure of every
ship is kept and the changes in the
various squadrons are noted on boards
that hang on the wall and are desig
nated as "ship boards." These boards
are arranged according to squadrons,
and the name of each ship in the
squadron and its present location is
noted on little slips of cardboard, which
can be easily altered as the ships move
about from one station to another.
Just now the movements of the ships
of the American navy are not only be
ing watched by the officers of the Bu
reau of Navigation, but their maneu
vers are being observed by all the na
tions of the world. There is not the
same amount of freedom in announc
ing the movements of our ships in time
of war as there would be in time of
peace. Therefore, "an awful circle" has
been thrown around the Bureau of
Mavigation, and only a few trusted and
faithful officers of thr navy are per
mitted to enter within its sacred pre
cincts. It is there that the real news
of the present war is received and dis
seminated.
A great deal goes on in the Bureau of
Navigation of which the outside world
has no knowledge. A great deal of in

properly belong to them.
Day and night the force In the Bu
reau of Navigation is on duty. When
the deprtment closes for the day
and the clerks and employes in
the other divisions of the de
partment retire to their respective
homes, a detachment of the employes
in the Navigation Bureau remains on
duty. I visited the Navy Department a
few nights ago during the mid
watch in the Navigation Bureau. Lieu
tenant H. H. Whlttlesey, the officer on
detail in charge of the cipher code, was
at his post of duty, where he had been
all day.
Since the war commenced Lieutenant
Whittiesey and his staff of assistants
have remained in the department every
night to- receive such information as
might be sent from the warships,
wherever they might be. Cots are pro
vided for the watchers, and between
the intervals of receiving and sending

Lieutenant Whittlesey is master of
the naval cipher code. He has all the
combinations at his ccrnniand, and he
can express in a few apparently mean
ingless combinations of words a whole
volume of information concerning the
orders to commanding officers of the
warships. His assistants during the
mid-watch are Lieutenant G. W. Lo
gan, Lieutenant William B. Hf.-ggatt
and Ensign R. J. Hartung. These four
officers are entrusted with the myster
ies of the Tiaval code, and they alone
decipher all dispatches received or sent
by the direction of the Secretary and
the War Board. The clerical work at
night is done by E. W. Callahan, F. S.
Hinricks, P. J. Willett and S. C. Hud

Alongabout 1 or 2 o'clock in the morn

cipher room grow heavy. The lights
are lowered and the tired men fling
themselves down for a few moments of
needed repose. Suddenly the clicking of
the telegraphic instruments is heard in

HOW TO MAKE A FORTUNE
C. P.
HUNTINGTON
Says
Jump right In
and work..
THIS is too brand a subject to deal
â¢with hastily and in a few words*.
There is no general rule which
will fit all cases, for the question
of money-making all depends l
â¢upon the boy who Is trying to rrmke the
money. Th< re are so many different
characters and bo many different
grades of ability among our youth that
advice which would help one would be
a disadvantage to another.
To my mind a young man who had j
no money at all upon reaching his ma- j
jority would be really better off thtrr
one who had JSOO which he had not
earned himself.
But to the young man who had
the $500 I would say put it out at
interest somewhere and go to work.
Don't wait around for a '-good job,"
or one that is easy and ensures the
wearing of good clothes, but take the
first thing that comes to hand, and j
while you are working at that with
a will, keep watch for anything bet
ter that happens along.
A good boy, with honesty of purpose,
who does his best wherever he is, who
feels enough interest in whatever work
he is doing to do it as well as if he
were working 1 for himself and doesn't
feel it necessary to keep "one eye on the
clock all the time, will lind himself r:ip
idly advanced under a Just employer,
and will have no trouble about getting
along in the world.
One thing should be remembered,
however, and that is that the "sharp"
boys are not always the good boys, and
that the character of ..the man is what
Bhould give him his status in the
world and not his capacity for making
money.
The great trouble at the present
time is that there are not enough
boys vho are willing to do hard
â work. They all want easy, well
dressed situations, or if they do not
their mothers and fathers want such
situations for them.
Hard labor is looked upon as being j
almost, if not quite, disgraceful, and
clerkships in stores and offices', even on j
starvation wages. â¢â â  fly sought
for, while "rough" workâ anything
which hardens the hands or soils the
garments â is looked upon as In every â 
way low-ring and undesirable.
No, 1 do not believe In speculation.
In New York City, among those keen ;
speculators, only about three in every
hundred make great successes of their!
ventures, and the other ninety-seven \
are living lives of feverish uncertainty
all th" time.
When 1 was young I worked hard
and kept whatever money I made out ;
at interest, adding to it a little at a
time as i could, and 1 Boon found that
nothing makes money like money. ',
Now when young men come to me â as j
they do frequently â and a.~k my ad- i
vice as to how to shape their futures,
I tell them of. my youth, and give them
Just these three brief rules:
Firstâ Be honest. Give your employ
er honest service, and show honesty of
purpose in all your dealings.
Second â Be industrious and perse
vering, and permit yourself no idle mo
ments. You can study and read books
when you are not busy, and everything
which you can gain in this way will be
of service to you in your future.
Third â Be frugal. Make it a rule to
deny yourself useless luxuries of every
kind and save a little from your earn
ings â if only a dime â every day. These
rules strictly .followed will help any
boy to make a man of himself and to
make money likewise.

Per Cent of

MY advice to young- men who are
anxious to advance to the front
rank in the struggle in life is
that out of every five dollars
they earn they should save
and put out at interest one dollar of
it.
Money at interest is like a calf of
â which an honest old German once told
me. lie said that the purchase of that
calf was the best thin? he ever did,
for the calf grew just the same whether
her owner was asleep or awake, and
almost before he knew it she had grown
to be a full-sized cow, worth many
times what he had paid for her. Just
bo is it with money at interest.
If a young man just starting: In life

A YOUNG man just starting in life
must be careful, If he desires to

and in which he will be happiest.
A man seldom, if ever, puts forth his
best efforts in any vocation which is
not thoroughly congenial to him. Then,
having selected the right calling, he
must be particular to select the best
place in which to practice it. He should
be careful to keep himself in good
health, for without that no man can
win fortune, generally speaking.
Bum and tobacco he should entire

unless his brain is clear, and clear it
cannot be when clouded with the

Put what money you have and all you
j can save in the future at interest,

like money at interest. It never stops,

', just keeps on working away for Its

Never try to work at more than
one kind of business at a time.
Persevere in whatever you are en
gaged in until you have succeeded or
until you are satisfied that you never
ran succeed in that line. To make
money dishonestly is the hardest thing
in life. Therefore preserve your integ

Advises
Living Within
Your Income.
YiiT" ask me what I should advise
a young man with $500 to do in
order to make the most of it and
of himself.
In the first place, if the youth
to be advised is addicted to smok
ing, drinking and gambling, ad
vice of any kind is totally unnec
essary. Such a boy has, even in his
boyhood, settled the question of his
future for himself.
If a boy, however, has grown up
with prudent habits I should tell
him to, in the first place, make it an
invariable rule to bring his expenses
within his income at all times, no
matter how small that income may
be.
Then, whether his money is placed at
interest or used in some business en
terprise he will sooner or. later become
i rich man.
I should tell him also not to Invest
In land or city lots and wait for his
neighbor's enterprise to make it valu- j
able, but to watch carefully for some
business opening of a respectable char
acter, where his own efforts, aided by
his Invested capital, would help him
along toward financial success. Even
a. few hundred dollars put into a busi
ness for which one has a natural apti
tude and Into which one puts not only
his money but his own personal work,
may be the foundation of a well-earned
fortune.
I should likewise tell this young man
not to discard the advice of his father
and mother or of some experienced
friend, and to be always prudent and
honest since a good reputation will help
:>ne along in the world even if he have
no capital whatever and depends on the
tvork of his hands for his daily bread.

either through inheiitance or from per
sonal bad habits could not hope to suc
ceed, but temperate, sturdy, non-cigar
ette smoking boys can do well there,
as they can in all new settlements.
A young man with $500 would do far
better outside the city than he could
hope to do where there is such a con
stant crush far employment, and such
constant struggle for business suprem
acy, as there is in all thickly settled
communities.
Too many of our boys, both rich
and poor, are willing to stay around
home and let their parents support
them and look out for them as if they
were still children.
If they had the right feeling they
would strike out for themselves and
make up their minds not only to care
for themselves in manly fashion, but
to so order their lives as to be able to
care for father and mother In their
declining years.
As for opportunitiesâ there are plenty
right here in our own State if a young
man has the capacity to take advan
tage of them. This State has not been
half-worked, and there are fortunes
yet to be taken out of the ground here
by the men who will go at the task of
unearthing them in the right way.
My advice to any young fellow
who was uncertain what to do with
I himself and his small capital would
i be to spend no time looking about
I for investments and not to venture
1 a nickel in speculation, but to use as
much of it as is necessary to take

Urges
Young men
to go to
New Countries.
MY advice in this case would de
pend entirely upon the individ
ual young man.
To say what would be the
best thins fur all young men,
irrespective of natural inclina
tion, business ability and early train
ing, would be an impossibility, since
there is no one avenue of trade or spec
ulation which is .sure to lead straight
to success in money-making. Different
persons are fitted for different avoca
tions; one man will succeed in business
where another, his equal In everything
except special fitness for that certain
line of work, will make a complete fail
ure.
My general advice would be to
young men of grit and stamina to
do what I did when I was young â go
to a new country with their minds
made up to make the very best of
themselves and their opportunities.
In every new country there are
chances innumerable for those who
know enough to taxe advantage of
them.
There will be a wide field for busi
ness enterprise in the Philippines and
the West Indies;, aÂ« there is now In
the Klondike, but the man who goes
to either place must make up his mind
firmly to endure privations and hard
ships of all kinds, to be economical in
every way, and not to allow himself to
become discouraged even if he meet
with many disappointments and dis
couragements.
With a good constitution, good hab
its, perseverance and a brave heart,
there is no reason why our young men
of the present day should not make as
large fortunes under present conditions
as their elders have in the past. There
are as good openings in the Klondike
region now as there were in California
when I came out here in 1849. Five
hundred dollars will get a man there
comfortably, and, once there, it is his
own fault if he does not make money.
Not necessarily in gold digging, though
some will make fortunes at that, but
in some branch of trade or investment
which he will discover once he is
there and has the ability to see how
things are going. A young man going
up there and working for wages would
save up quite a sum very soon, and by
keeping his ears and eyes open and his
mouth shut would find some place
where it would become the nucleus of a
fortune. LOUIS SLOSS SR.

Putting Away
a
Sroall Nest Egg.
A BOY'S environment in youth us
ually decides the question of his
future for him, though some do
break away from all the tradi-
tions of their forefathers and
carve their lives out for themselves. A
young man will be able to make more
or less of $500 In exact proportion to his
own ability. If the conditions of his
boyish life have been such as to make
him able to understand his own possi
bilities and limitations and the possi
bilities and limitations of certain lines
of procedure in the business world, he
will be able to use his money with pru
dence and foresight and will make a
fortune where one of different educa
tion will make a failure.
My advice to the average young
man would be to put his nestegg
where it will draw steady interest, no
matter if small, and go to work for
the best wages he can get.
So small a sum would be of little use
invested legitimately, and dabbling in
stocks is too exciting for young men.
Above all things, I would warn him to
keep away from the races and every
form of gambling. Where one makes
money in such things, hundreds fire
ruined for life, both financially and
morally. With $500 drawing interest,
and a salary coming in monthly, a
young man may consider himself on the
high road to fortune â that is, if he
makes it a rule to add to his capital
at least a little at every payday. It is
surprising to see how money grows
when you plant it and take care not to
disturb it.
Perhaps there are not the extraordin
arily good chances to make money now
that there were thirty or more years
ago, but a young fellow with the right
kind of a disposition will find chances
anywhere and any time.
He must make the most of whatever
education he has been able to obtain,
abjure cigarettes and liquors, build up
a reputation which will be a recom
mendation to him anywhere, and he
will come to the top without fail.

Says
I Earn Your
Salary Many
Tirrjes Over.
I THINK a first-class savings bank
as secure a depository for money
as any place. There is not much
use accumulating money if you do
not get interest on it. In reply to
your request for general advice and di
rections to aid a young man just start
ing in life to become rich, I would say
that if such a young man is in the em
ploy of others it should be his aim to
earn his salary many times over, and
not to be contented to earn it but once
and merely give satisfaction to his em
ployers. He should strive to do more.
In my first year in, business, though
neither asked nor expected to do so, I
frequently worked all night.
A young man who thus devotes
himself heart and soul to his employ
er's interest will soon find that his
devotion is appreciated, for even if
his employer should fail to reward it
some one else will surely observe it,
and the way to promotion will soon
open before him.
There are vacant places in the higher
walks of every business and profession
for the young men who follow this
course.
Some men fail because they overrate
their own ability and underestimate
that of their competitors. Such a mis
take should be carefully avoided. Let
a man with ever so great natural abil
ity, but lacking a capacity for hard
wai*C' compete with a duller man. but
one who toils early and late, and the
latter will outrun him on the road to
success every time. Wed natural abil
ity to hard work and you have a com
bination that nothing can defeat.

Advises
Buying Good
City Real
Estate.
WERE I in your position I
would buy some real estate
in this city, New York. You
cannot duplicate real estate.
You can duplicate an-- other
! kind of security. As the country grows
j real estate will increase in value. All
j the improved real estate in New York.
j and in almost any other large city, as a
; rule, has paid its interest and taxes
! and quadrupled in value during the
j past fifty years, while during the same
j period 90 per cent of all the merchants
and traders have failed or gone out of
business, so that their stock has been
j wiped out.
In view of these facts I think it
may be unhesitatingly asserted that
there is no better way to become rich
on small savings that by using them
in the purchase of improved real es
tate.
Nothing is likely to grow in value
more rapidly. "With your $500 you had
better buy a piece of improved real es
tate, however small, that is paying suf
ficient rent to pay the taxes and the in
terest on whatever amount of money
you would have to borrow. Pay in cash
what little money you have and give
your note, secured by a mortgage on
the property, for the balance in small
sums, falling due at short intervals,
and then use all your extra income
from the rent of your property in pay
ing them off. You never incur any risk
in discounting your own notes, and
when your friends find that you are
placing your money where it is perfect
ly secure they will be glad to assist you
if those notes should come due a little
too rapidly. Thus in a short time and
all before you know it, you will have a
considerable and perfectly safe invest
ment.
If you had a rich father who would
furnish the cash to start you in busi
ness you would probably do better in
the long run if you invested it in the
way I have pointed out rather than to
risk it in trade, meanwhile earning
your living by working for a salary.
Fof a young man starting in life,
whose ambition is to become rich, I
would say:
never do a mean thing for money.
I know of no better way for a young
man just starting in life to become rich
than to be always sober, honest, indus
trious and economical; to be true to his
employers and himself: to save all he
can without being parsimonious, and to
invest his savings judiciously in the
way I have indicated.

Those who fallow that method al

In order to become rich the young

choose that occupation or vocation

When Remenyi Played
the Star Spangled Banner
THE tragic death of Edouard Remen- |
yi, which has just occurred in this
city, recalls a patriotic demonstra
tion, which took place up<sh the oc
casion of his playing in a concert in
Shanghai, China, eleven years ago,
when he was making a tour of the
Orient.
It rivaled in wildness of enthusiasm any
thing that had occurred here, even in these
troublous times; for, war or no war, it
is, i-'rhaps, only when one is separated
from one's native land by thousands of
miles of land and sea that he can realize
or appreciate the thrill, the wave of en
thusiasm that surges over one at the
sight of his i!ag, or the sound of a na
tional anthem.
The last number on the programme that
night was a medley of national aira. The
audience was composed of English,
French and a few Americans.
The "Marseillaise" came first. The
Frenchmen rose in a body, shouting and
waving their handkerchiefs, and many !
a hat was taken home that night, bruised
and battered, the result of having been
pitched high in the air.
"God Save the Queen" came next, when
as with tme accord rose up the English
portion of the audience, who screamed
and shouted until they were hoarse.
And then as the first majestic notes of .
"The Star Spangled Banner" struck the
air America was heard from. There

ing her own country. In her excitement,
she had leaned far over the edge of the
box and, there she remained, waving that
flag the tears streaming over her cheeks
until the last strain of the glorious o ( d
hymn had died away.
So great had been the uproar, that little
more than the llrst notes of each hymn
had been beard, but Remenyi stood there,

The utility of a collegiate education
for success in business is very often
debated.
As the college curriculum and

It is erroneously regarded by some
peoole as a kind of substitute for busi

young man's life. There can be no
greater mistake in the beginning of a
business career. It is in many in
stances not only a hindrance, but ab

G. W. McNEAR:
Do not Speculate.
IN THE first place a young man
should riot th.in;k of going into
business for himself while he is
still a very young man, unless he
has been brought up in the busi
ness in which he wishes to embark.
Where he has practically served an
apprenticeship and has learned the
real workings of a certain branch of
industry or trade he may hope to make
a success provided he is by nature
sharp and shrewd and able to see and
take advantage of every legitimate
opportunity that comes in his way for
the furtherance of his plans for
worldly prosperity.
If a young man has spent his youth
in gaining an education and has no
trade and no business experience he
should think matters over seriously
and try to discover what he is best fit
ted for. No. one can tell him that as
well as himself, but he must be per
fectly honest in his mental valuation
of his own capabilities. He must not
allow himself to be influenced in his
decision for his future by thoughts of
what he would like to do or be, instead
of determining to take up something
which he knows he is really best adapt-
Ed to.
He may be so constituted as to make
a far better mechanic than a trader.
He may have special qualifications for
a certain occupation which will make
him advance rapidly in that particular
field, while in another he will prove a
flat failure, no matter how hard and
conscientiously he may strive to make
his way along.
Once hav'-- settled the question of
his proper vocation the new beginner
should endeavor to get into an office or
a store or a shop or a factory where
by applying- himself steadily he can
learn the business which he intends to
enter thoroughly and practically.
Meanwhile he should take the advice of
some trustworthy and experienced per
son as to a safe investment for his $500
until such time as he is competent to
handle it for himself.
Above all things he should not at
tempt to speculate with. it. Specula
tion with small sums is almost al
ways disastrous to the speculator
financially and the , excitement and
uncertainty are disastrous to young
and inexperienced minds.
The races should be Strictly avoided,
for where one gains scores lose, and
the hope of making money in such
ways unfits youn" men for real work
in the business world.

I shall be desole."
Just then the butler appeared, carrying
the violin. "Oh, give it to me; I could not
live without my precious Princess," cried
Remenyi, as he hugged it closely to him.
After dinner he entertained the com
pany with many interesting and unique
experiences that he had had in riiany
lands. Many curios had he collected and
many presents received from roya! hands.
That which was delighting him at that

and I had for some hours been sitting
in the warm sunshine, smoking idly
and gazing out on the deep blue wat
ers. The whole crowd of eight of us
had almost fallen asleep under the se
ductive influence of the dreamy sky
and the soothing breeze from the
south that swept over the pine-clad
sandhills of Point Pinos.
Suddenly the lookout yelled: "There
she blows."
Of course the whale in question did
not "blow" at all, because It was not a
blowing kind, but different men took
up the cry, and soon it reached our
cars. And we well understood what
it meant.
The captain of the boat's crew
jumped to his feet and made a dash for
the boat, the silver dollars I had paid
for the privilege of going along merrily
jingling in his pocket. He called to
me to "jump." Of course I jumped,
scarcely realizing which end was up
in the excitement that took possession
of all hands.
Then there was a sudden clatter and
skurry oiy the beach. People seemed
to come up out of the ground and rush
for a point of vantage to see the chase.
While our boat was shoving off another
boat was doing the same and by the
time we were through the tiny line of
breakers the other boat was almost be

When we reached a position where
we could see the whale â about a mile
from shore â the two boats separated
and pulled in opposite directions, each
describing a half circle. By this man
ner we got the whale between us and
the shore.
At a signal from the captain in my
boat both crews began to pull together
again, and we had our whale where we
wanted him. He did not like our ap
pearance, evidently, for he retreated,
but in doing so only got nearer to
shore. This was just what the captain
wanted, and we kept on until he be
came frightened, and In shifting about
to make his escape he began to dive.
But he had unwittingly beei. going in
shore all the time. On the first dive he
bumped his nose and came to the sur
face more flustered than ever. He was
cleverly cornered, and I guess he
knew it.
Now was our chance and the gun in
the bow of the boat was made ready
for firing a bomb into him.

bomb, as the distance was not great.
The bomb is much like a small shell,
such as is used in the army, but loa/led
with fulminate of mercury i.istead of
powder, and having a long tube attach
ed to it.
When the captain was all ready to
fire he signaled to the rowers to cease
pulling. In an instant the boat lay
still and a hush seemed to fall over us.
Then came a report like a small can
non. Instantly the whale realized that
something was wrong. At first he
straightened out and then began to
lash the water into foam, showing
plainly that the shot had struck a vital
spot.
We pulled away from the scene, but
had hardly gone more than a hundred
foet before the time fuse on the bomb
reached the fulminate and there was
another explosion.
This fairly ripped the whale open and
filled the air with fragments of flesh
and reddened the water with blo<,-d. It
was not a pleasant sight and I felt a
sinking feeling come over me. But this
vanished a moment later when with a
shout both boats' crews pulled for our
victim, which by this time had turned
over on his back and lay quiet, with his
giant spatula of a tail falling limply
downward.
It is when this moment comes that
the whalers display the greatest ac
tivity. The great bulk or a carcass,
like a derelLt at pea. lies there floating,

The upward steps are rough-hewn and
hard to the feet. The siren's lay is as
sweet to-day as when wise Ulysses
stuffed the ears of his companions so
that her music would not draw them
to the Incision.
The fat is a foot thick, and as It is
peeled off it looks not unlike fractions
of the flesh of some giant cocoanut.
As the carcass is stripped the blubber
is floated ashore by men who drag it
with hooks on the ends of long poles.
On reaching shore it is quickly cut up
and thrown into a boiling kettle, where
it is reduced to oil. This is sent to San
Francisco to be refined.
This stripping usually requires a
whole day, after which, if the site of
the catch is far distant from the town,
the remains are drawn up on the beach,
where they are left to rot, in order that
the bone of the skeleton may be se
cured. This is a valuable product,
bringing several cents per pound and
weighing sometimes several tons.
But generally the tlesh of the Mon
terey whales is not thrown to the birds
in the literal sense-. Although the meat
is coarse in texture and not over deli
cate in flavor, yet it is meat for the
Chinese fishermen who form a colony
at Monterey. When the whale haul
has been made they anxiously watch
the operations of taking off the blubber,
and when these are completed and the
body abandoned by the Caucasians, the
Mongolians fall upon it and industri
ously ply their knives in cutting away
the flesh.
The. odor of whale steak ascends from
many a Celestial frying-pan while the
carcass Is still fresh. Particular parts,
such as the brains, sweetbreads and
even the kidneys, like those of the por
poise, are esteemed as delicacies, while
cutlets of the muscles are spread out
on racks to dry for some mysterious
purpose, not unconnected, perhaps,
with shipments to China. The Japan
ese fishermen also engage a share of
the whale refuse, but they use theirs
for bait for other fish. And, lastly, the
buzzards of the bay stand a cordon
over the ultimate offal.
Most of the whales that come into
Monterey Bay are of the variety called
sulphur bottoms, a name given them
because of the yellow color of their

into swine. Nature abhors and frowns
upon effort; she soothes the path of the

to glide with the easy current than to
bellies and of their habit of swimming
deep in the sea. These are as large as
any other of the genus, but they are
of the species that is without baleen,
or whale bone, and therefore are val
ued only for their blubber. Still, there
have been instances where the sperm
whale, with their mouths full of bone
slabs that aggregate a tcm each, have
got Into the shoal waters of the bay
and have been captured. Such a whale
is a mighty prize to the captors, for the
bone is by far the most valuable part of
the whale's anatomy, being worth, acÂ»
cording to quantity and state of mar
ket, sometimes as much as $7000.
The bowheads and right whales do
not venture o-ut of the Arctic seas, but
the humpback and the black fish whale,
the latter the smallest of the order,
both distinguish the bay by their visits.
These whales vary from ten to thirty
tons in weight, and are worth to th-ir
taker? from four hundred to eight hun
dred dollars each. Of their entire bod
ies about two-fifths are (blubber, and a
ton of blubber yields nearly two hun

thirty-five to forty cents per gallon.
Whales enter the bay at all seasons,
but are most plentiful In the winter
time. It has only been within the past
two years that the taking of whales
has been regularly prosecuted as an in

They were very plentiful there three
years ago, and in a desultory way they
were captured from ti.iie to time, the

of the whole fishing populace. L>ut un

Salome Jane`s Kiss
-1 KILLED THE MAN." SAID DART. "THINKING HE WAS HUNTING ME. fIND FORGETTING I ViflS DISGUISED. 11
(Bepun inst Sunday.)
PART 11.
NEVERTHELESS, that night, after h-er father had
gone to bed,; Salomy Jane sat by the open window
of the sitting-room in an apparent attitude of
languid contemplation, but alert and intent of
eye and ear. It was a fine moonlight night. Two
pines near the doorâ solitary pickets of the serried
ranks of distant forestâ cast long shadows like
paths to the cottage, and sighed their spiced breath in the
shadows. For there was no frivolity of vine or flower
round Salomy Jane's bower.
The clearing was too recent, the life too practical for
vanities like these. But the moon added a vague elusive
ness to everything, softened the rigid outlines of the
sheds, gave shadows to the lidless windows, and touched.
with merciful indirectness the hideous debris of refuse
gravel and the gaunt scars of burnt veg-etatlon before
the door. Even Salomy Jane was affected by it, and
exhaled something between a sigh and a yawn with the
breath of the pir.es. Then she suddenly sat upright.
Her quick ear had caught a faint "click, click" in the
direction of the wood; her quicker instinct and rustic
training enabled her to determine that it was the ring
of a horse's shoe on flinty ground; her knowledge of the
locality told her it came from the spot where the trail
passed over an outcrop of flint scarcely a quarter of a
mile from where she satâ and within the clearing. It was
no errant "stock," for the shoe was shod with iron; it
was a mounted trespasser by night, and boded no good
to a man like Clay.
She rose, threw her shawl over her head more for
disguise than shelter, and passed out of the door. A
sudden impulse made her seize her fathers shotgun from
the corner where it stoodâ not that she .feared any
danger to herself, but that it was an excuse. She made
directly for the wood, keeping in the shadow of the pines
as long as she could. At the fringe she halted; whoever
was there must pass her before reaching the house.
Then there seemed to be a suspense of all nature.
Everything was- deadly stillâ even the moonbeams ap
peared no longer tremulous; then there was a rustle as
of some, stealthy animal among the fernsâ and then a dis
mounted tnan stepped into the moonlight. It waa the
THE MAJOR`S CONVERSION
JI Decoration Day Story
MAJOR BEVERLY MORTIMER was a Tennessean
and proud of it. He took part In the battle of
Bull Run and was with Sherman -when he cap
tured Joe Johnston, and in all the intervening
years there was hardly a day In which there had
not occurred some stirring- incident which it was
â¢â  his delight .to recall and his pride to describe in
the later days of peace. After the war he returned to
Tennessee and resumed the practice of- the law in the
little town of Bradford. When that noble order, the
Grand Army of the Republic, was founded, he issued the
call for the first meeting of the old soldiers of the vicinity,
and upon the organization of General. Baker Post he was
chosen commander, a position he held for many years.
He prospered in. his profession,, but as time wore on
his heart appeared to become more and more adamantine
toward his late opponents and their survivors. He was an
eloquent and impassioned stump-speaker; and as he had
â waved the bloody flag- through many a harq-rought battle,
Bo now be energetically waved the "bloody shirt" through
many a valorous campaign. Tennessee being a border
State, there were many ex-Confederates in and about
Bradford, and Major Mortimer referred to tnem as "the
enemy" in the seventies and eighties just aa lie had in
the sixties, Time assuages many griefs and softens many
asperities, but time could do nothing with the major.
It was somewhere along in the latter seventies when
Colonel Horace ' Templeton located In Bradford. ." A
Southerner of the old school, the perfection of courtly
politeness, he made his way rapidly into tne good graces
of the communityâ that is to say, that portion of the
community whose domiciles lay outside the protecting
hedges and gates of the Mortimer homestead. In the
first place, he was a lawyer, and after he nad tried his
Initiatory case in Bradford it was felt, and indeed occa
sionally whispered, that the major had at last met his
legal match. But as if this were not enough to fill the
latter's cup of bitterness, it must needs. soon be noised
about that the colonel had served in the Confederate
army.- There was no open warfare between the two mili
tary gentlemen, for they never met except in the forensic
field, and the divinity which doth hedge a court as well
as a king served to keep them within' legal bounds, but
many were the" argumentative allusions on the part or
the major, on such occasions, to "traitors," "slave drivers '
and the "iniquitous doctrine of States' rights," whether
such remarks were relevant to theissue or not.
Th^n- came the organization of Stonewall Jackson
Camp of Confederate Veterans in Bradford, with- CoJonel
Templeton at the head of the association. The Bradford
Bugle of the following week contained a fiery article under
the caption "Treason Stalks in Our Midst." the author
ship -'of which, was generally ascribed to Major Mortimer,
but the colonel made no response beyond informing a knot
of friends one day that "the camp was organized for much
the same purpose as was General Baker I'ost. namely, to
do honor to the memory of its illustrious dead. The Con
federate veteran who . sleeps beneath th-o sod to-day is a
hero. As the world sees them> his conclusions, perhaps,
were wrong, but he gave his allâ his. life â in derense of
what ho thought was right.' More than this can no man
do to gain the approbation of his God and the respect of
his posterity." . , , ,
Months rolled into years, and at each recurring cycle
General Baker Post would strew flowers over its increas
ing graves, while Stonewall Jackson Camp would perform
a similar service of love for the Confederate dead. Else
where in the world the whirligig of time was Drlnging
nbout its changes. Henry W. Grady of Georgiaâ no, of
the United Statesâ had made his famous speech on the
â 'New South" to the business men of New York, and ac?
counts began, to appear in the papers here and there of
the joining of Union and Confederate soldiers on Memo
rial day to decorate the graves of heroes who had fallen
on both sides of-th.e fratricidal conflict.
It was at a meeting of Baker Post held to make ar
rangements for one of these annual ceremonies that a
bomb was thrown which for a time bade fair to destroy
the organization. Captain Bogard, one of the progressive
members of the post and a gallant soldier as well, intro
duced a resolution requesting Stonewall- Jacnson Camp to
loln with the post in observing the approaching holiday.
For a moment there was utter silence and all eyes turned
instinctively toward, Major Mortimer. That worthy was.
for an instant, dumb with astonishment, -then temporarily
resigning the chair, he stepped to the floor and for a
quarter of an hour such a stream of satire, sarcasm,
argument and Invective poured- from his lips as had never
been heard in Bradford before. Trembling with anger he
declared, that he was overcome y&th sorrow. at too. tbduf
horse-thiefâ the man she had kissed!
For a wild moment a strange fancy seized her usually
sane intellect and stirred her temperate blood. The news
they had told her was not trueâ he had been hanged, and
this was his ghost! He looked as white and apiritllke in
the moonlight, dressed in the same clothes, as when she
saw him last. He had evidently seen her approaching,
and moved quickly to meet her. But in his haste he
stumbled slightlyâ she reflected suddenly that ghosts did
not stumbleâ and a feeling of relief came over her. And
it was no assassin of her father that had been prowling
aroundâ only this unhappy fugitive. A momentary color
came into her cheek; her coolness and hardihood returned;
it was with a tinge of sauciness in her voice that she said:
"I reckoned you were a ghost."
"I must have been," he said, looking at her fixedly;
"but I reckon I'd have come back here all the same."
"It's a little riskier eomin' back alive." she said with
a levity that died on her lips, for a singular nervousness,
half fear and half expectation, was beginning to take
the place of her relief of a moment ago. "Then it was
you who was prowlin" round and makin' tracks in the far
pasture?"
"Yes; I came straight here when I got away."
She felt his eyes were burning her, but did not daro
to raise her own. "Why â " she beganâ hesitated, and
ended vaguely. "How did you get here?"
"You helped me."
"I?"
"Yes. That kiss you gave me put life Into meâ gave
me strength to get away. I swore to myself I'd come back
and thank youâ alive or dead."
Every word he said she could have anticipated, so
plain the situation seemed to her now. And every word
he said she knew was the truth. Yet her cool common
sense struggled against It.
"What's the use of your escaping. cT you're comln'
back here to be ketched again?" she said pertly.
He drew a little nearer to her. but seemed to her the
more awkward as she resumed her self-possession. His
voice, too, was broken as if by exhaustion as he said,
catching his breath at intervals:
"I'll tell you. You did more for me than you think.
You made another man o' me. I never had a man, woman
or child do to me what you did. I never had a friend
only a pal like Red Pete, who picked me up 'on the
shares.' I want to quit this yerâ what I'm doin . I want
to begin by doin' the square thing to you," he stopped,
breathed hard and then said brokenly: "My hoss is over
thar, staked out. I want to give him to you. Judge
Boompoin'ter will give you $1000 for him. 1 ain't lyin'â
that he had not been stricken down on the field of battle
by a rebel bullet, for in that event he would have been
spared the pain, nay the agony, in this latter day of
hearing a treasonable proposal to extend the hand of
fellowship to men who had endeavored to wreck the proud
ship of state. Captain Bogard bravely essayed to stem
the torrent of the major's eloquence, but such was the
prestige of the doughty commander of the post that the
resolution was voted down by a large majority and the
Union and Confederate veterans went their separate ways
as before.
Among the institutions which gave the little Tennessee
town a fancied feeling of security at home and more or
less renown abroad was the organization known as. the
Bradford Rifles. Duly armed, uniformed and mustered
Into the National Guard of the State, the militia com
pany's claims to social supremacy were only contested by
the Bradford Volunteer Fire Brigade. Every young man
in the town who was anybody belonged to one of both
of these organizations. The Rifles had their annual
parades, encampments and target practices, and it was
always thought that they would make their presence felt
should grim-vieaged war ever again rear his horrid front
as war is reputed to do. It was along about the year â
still, the year cuts no figure in the caseâ when the Rifles
began to arrange for their annual three days' encamp
ment. It was felt that the company must Co something
out of the ordinary this time, and it was agreed after
much debate to close the proceedings with a grand mimic
battle. Here was where Fairfax Templeton's genius came
into play.
Young Templeton resembled his father, tne colonel, in
that he was tall, military and black-eyed. The colonel's
mustache was white and bristly, while the younger man's
was black and glossy, but otherwise Fairfax was a chip
of the old block in personal appearance. He was not a
resident of Bradford. After his graduation from a semi
military college he had taken a course at Columbia I^aw
School and then settled down to practice in a Tennessee
county town not far from his father's chosen abode. He
was meeting with fair success, but his time was not so
thoroughly occupied but that he could occasionally devote
a few days to a filial visit to Bradford. Being of a genial
disposition and an approachable nature, he made warm
friends easily, and the Rifles soon learned that owing to
his education and a natural bent for military science,, he
know more about tactics and maneuvers than they could
perhaps ever hope to learn.
He had rendered them valuable assistance on moro
than one occasion, and as one of his periodical visits
was made during the time of preparation for the mimic
battle, he was naturally called upon to assist in the ar
rangements of the maneuvers.. He mapprd out the plans
of the engagement, throwing himself heart and soul into
the work, and was soon In charge of all the details. He
secured a number of recruits to swell the ranks for the
occasion, borrowed arms from a number of neighboring
towns and personally drilled each soldier in the work he
was expected to perform.
The preparations were kept as secret as possible, the
drilling was done in retired spots, and when the eventful
day came Bradford and the surrounding country was astir
with excitement. The battle was to bÂ« rought on the
common, a grassy tract of some four or five acres lying
on the edge of the town and sloping gently to a little
creek that skirted it on the south. Rough seats had been,
erected on the side nearest town, and here was g-athered
almost the entire population of Bradford, reinforced by
crowds from the country and neighboring villages. Even
the major was there, occupying a front seat, and by his
side sat a radiant bit of femininity who has not hitherto
been called to the attention of the reader simply because
the time for that pleasing task has only just arrived.
Suffice it to say that Dorothy Mortimer was about the
only being on the face of the earth to whom her father,
the major, bowed in obeisance. If she was the belle of
Bradford, it was because she worthily filled the position,
and that is saying enough.
Along the top of the little slope a line or low breast
works had been thrown up. and the major was just telling
Dorothy that the scene, although on a small scale, re
minded him of a battle field he had performed some ser
vice on during the memorable seven days in/the Wilder
ness, when a half-dozen blue-coats jumped from the
trenches and planted on the works a start bearing the
stars and stripes. At the same Instant a body of. soldiers
could be seen emerging from a little clump of trees near
the creek on the further side of the field. A chorus of
half-suppressed "Ahs" came from the lips of the spec
tators as it was discovered that the new-comers wore the
Confederate uniform. Fairfax- Templeton's dramatic
instinct had been allowed full play, and the battle was to
be a reminiscence of the mighty struggle In which had
been engaged many of the spectators on one side or the
other. Tiie gray-coats marched steadily up the slope until

Such were the ethics of this strange - locality that
neither the man who made the offer nor the girl to whom
it was made were struck by anything that seemed illog
ical or indelicate or at all inconsistent with justice or the
horse-thief's real conversion. Salomy Jane, nevertheless,
dissented, from another and weaker reason.
"I don't want your hoss-though I reckon dad might
âbut you're just starvin'. I'll get suthin'. She turned
toward the house. . , Â ' . - *,â_
"Say, you'll take the hoss first," he Bald, grasping her
hand. At the touch she felt herself coloring and strug
gled, expecting perhaps another kiss. But he dropped her
hand. , â¢'
She turned again with a saucy gesture, said: Hoi
on; I'll come right back," and slipped awayâthe mere
shadow of a coy and flying nymph in tne moonlightâ
until she reached the house. : â - â  ... . .
Here she not only procured food and â¢whisky, but
added, a long dust coat and hat of her father s tpvher
burden. They would serve as a disguise for him and hide
that . herolc\ figure, which she -thought everybody must
now know as she did. Then she rejoined him. breath
lessly. But he put the food and whisky aside.
"Listen," he said; "I've turned the hoss Into your
corral. You'll find him there in the morning and no one
will know but that he got lost and joined the other
hosses."
Then she burst out. "But youâyouâ will become
of you? You'll be catched!" , , . ,
"I'll manage to get away," he said in a low voice,
"efâefâ"
"Ef what?" she said tremblingly.
"Ef you'll put the heart in me againâ you did! he
gasped.
She tried to laughâ move away. She could do
neither. Suddenly he caught her in his arms and with a
long kiss, which she returned again and again.
Then they stood embraced as they had embraced two
days before, but no longer the same. For the cool, lazy
Salomy Jane had been transformed into another womanâ
a passionate, clinging savage. Perhaps something of her
father's blood had surged within her at that supreme
moment. The man stood erect and determined.
"Wot's your name?" she whispered quickly. It was a
woman's quickest way of defining her feelings.
"Dart." "->,::;. v
"Yer first name?"
"Let me go now, Jack. Lie low In the woods till to
morrow sun-up. I'll come agin."
He released her. Yet she lingered a moment. "Put
on those things," she said with a sudden happy flash of
eyes and teeth, "and lie close till I come." And then she
sped away.
But midway up the distance she felt ncr feet going
slower and something at her heartstrings seemed to be
pulling her back. She stopped, turned, and glanced to
where he had been standing. Had she seen him then,
she might have returned. But he had disappeared. She
gave her first sigh, and then ran quickly again. It must
be nearly 10 o'clock! It was not very long to morning!
She was within a few steps of her own door when the
sleeping woods and silent air appeared to suddenly awake
with a sharp "crack."
Sho stopped paralyzed. Another "crack!" followed
that echoed over to the far corral. She recalled herself
instantly and dashed off wildly to the woods again.
As she ran she thought of one thing only. He had
been "dogged" by one of his old pursuers and attacked.
But there were two shots and he was unarmed. Suddenly
she remembered that she had left her father's gun stand
ing against the tree where they were talking. Thank
God! she may a"g-aln have saved him. She ran to the
tree: the gun was gone. She ran thither and thither,
dreading at every step to fall upon his lifeless body. A
new thought struck her; she ran to the corral. The horse
was not there! He must have been able to regain it and
escapedâafter the shots had been fired. She drew a long
breath of relief, bui it was caught up in an apprehension
of alarm. Her father, awakened from his sleep by the
shots, was hurriedly approaching her.
"What's up now, Salomy Jane?" he demanded, ex
cited
"NYithln"." said the girl with an effort. "Nothin', at
least, that I can find." She was usually truthful because
fearless, and a lie stuck In her throatâbut she was no
longer fearless, thinking of him. "I wasn't abed, so I ran
within fifty yards of the trenches, when suddenly there
leaped from the works a murderous line of fire. When
the smoke had cleared away it was seen that many of the â¢
attacking party had fallen,butthe line had been re-formed
and was now charging on the enemy at a double-quick.
Once more the hidden guns belched forth their deadly
message. This time the execution was more dire, iand
the gray line wavered.-
Major Mortimer gave a mighty shout of joy, but it was
short-lived. The lirst attack was only a reint to draw the
Union forces from the trenches, for when the victorious
blue-coats were well down the slope the main body of
Confederates, Led by Fairfax Templeton Â»n person, sud
denly emerged from the willows that fringed the little
stream, and with, the famous "rebel yell" charged directly
up the hill. The carnage now was awful. Guns were pop
ping, men were falling and officers were excitedly shout
ing commands all over the field. The Union troops were
slowly being pressed back to the trenches, and it seemed
as if victory was about to crown the Confederate forces,
when a faint bugle call was heard, and away in the dis
tance could be seen blue-coated reinforcements coming on
the run. In the face of the impending danger the Con
federates faltered, then slowly withdrew to a safe dis
tance across the stream, and the reinforced but exhausted
Union forces again occupied the works and quiet, broken
only by the groans of the wounded, pervaded the scene.
Then came a dramatic exhibition of a cut of sentiment.
Fairfax Templeton hal fallen in the deadly charge and
lay well down the slope a short distance from the specta
tors, while near him lay a Union officer who was moan
ing in great pain. Soon there was heard Issuing from the
parched lips of the Northern soldier the feeble cry:
"Water, water." As his delirious fever increased his cries
became louder, and presently Templeton painfully raised
himself on his elbow and looked in the direction of the
pitiful sound. Then he slowly and laboriously half
crawled and half rolled down the little slope. A number of
shots were fired at him from the works, and once he
fell, but recovering himself he went bravely on until he
reached the creek, where he filled his oilskin cap with
water and turning, slowly crawled back up the hill to his
wounded enemy. After pouring a few drops of tne life
giving fluid down the Union captain's throat he bathed
his face, and then drawing a handkerchief from his pocket
bound up the wounded man's shoulder, falling back in a
dead faint just as his generous task was completed.
The women J among the spectators were In tears, and
even the sterner males felt lumps in their throats. After
a moment a gentle hand-clapping was heard, which soon
broke into thunders of uproarious applause, but loud as
was the tumult it was speedily silenced by the "rebel
yell" which was heard once more from beyond the creek.
The Confederates had rallied, re-formed their lines, and
discovering the loss of their commander were returning
for his body. They leaped the creek, burst tnrough the
bushes and in the face of a withering fire once more
charged up the slope. Beaching the spot where their
beloved captain lay, although their numbers were sadly
decimated, they tenderly gathered the limp form in their
arms and once more retreated across the water, the rear
guard covering the retreat and fighting every inch of the
way.
The battle was over, the soldiers came forth from the
trenches and bushes and fraternized on the common, the
band burst into a medley in which were mingled strains
from "Yankee Doodle" and "Dixie," and the people
cheered and cheered and cheered again. Only the major
was silent. From the first his eyes had been fixed on the
gallant form of Fairfax Templeton, but until now he had
not spoken". â  â¢
"Who ia the Confederate captain, Dorothy?" he now
; asked. â¢ '
"Fairfax Templeton, the colonel's son," she responded,
blushing a little as she spoke. "Wasn't he splendid?"
But the major appeared to be deep in thought, and for
a moment vouchsafed no reply.
"The maneuvers were very well conceived," finally
said the major.
"Yes, Fairfax, had full charge and arranged every
thing," responded the girl, as if that were sufficient rea
son for the excellence of the exhibition.
"Do you know him?" asked her father..
"Ye-es, I have met him," hesitatingly answered
Dorothy, and somehow she blushed again. It is. remark
able how girls can blush about nothing.
â  "I am going home now," said the major. "I wish you
would remain long enough to: ask him to call and see
me this evening."
If the skies had'fallen Dorothy would not have been
more surprised. Major Beverly Mortimer actually asking
a Templeton into his house.; But she was a dutiful
daughter, generally, and had no Intention of disobeying
her father, although a casual observer might have
thought there was a lack of alacrity in her present move

It is possible that there . was 5 method in her action, or
rather lack of it. however, for very soon Fairrax Temple
ton disengaged himself from a knot of admirers and came
directly to her. â¢ â 
; "Oh, Fairfax," "she cried, extending her pretty hand,
"you were perfectly grand."
"If I was." he tenderly responded, "I could hardly be
otherwise with the inspiration ofâsuch an audience."
"Well, never mind that now," said Dorothy. "I have
some wonderful news for you. Papa wants you to come
to see him to-night." '^

amazement. ThÂ£u iio mada aa apparently, irrelevant

the last five minutes." , T) .
She hadn't thought since of her father's enemy! it
might indeed have been he who had attacked Jack. But
she made a quick point of the suggestion.
"Run in, dad, run in and find the gunâ you ye got no
show out here without it." She seized him by tne
shoulders from behind, shielding him from the woods, ana
hurried him, half expostulating, half struggling, to tne
house
But there no gun was to be found. It was strangeâ it
must have been mislaid in some corner! Was he sure he
had not left it in the barn? But no matter now. The dan
ger was overâ the Larrabee trick had failedâ he must go
to bed now, and in the morning they would make a search
together.
At the same time she had Inwardly resolved to risa
before him and make another search of the wood, ana
perhapsâ fearful joy as she recalled her promise!â find
him alive and well awaiting her!
Salomy Jane slept little that night^-nor did her father.
But toward morning he fell into a tired man's slumber
until the sun was well up in the horizon. Far different
was it with his daughter; she lay with her face to the
window, her head half lifted to catch every soundâ from
the creaking of the sun-warped shingles above her head
to the far off moan of the rising wind in the pine trees.
Sometimes she fell into a breathless, half ecstatic trance
living over every moment of the stolen interviewâ feeling
the fugitive's arm still around her, his kisses on her lips,
hearing his whispered voice in her earsâ birth of her
new life! This was followed again by a period of agon
izing dreadâ that he might even then be lying, ebbing his
life away, in the woods with her name on his lips, and
she resting here inactiveâ until she half started from her
bed to go to his succor. And this went on until a pale,
opal glow came into the sky, followed by a still paler pink
on the summit of the white Sierras, when she arose and
hurriedly began to dre6s. Still so sanguine was her hope
of meeting him that she lingered yet a moment to select
the brown holland skirt and yellow sun-bonnet she had
worn when she first saw him. And she had only seen him
twice! Only twice! It would be. cruel, too cruelâ not to
see him again.
â  She crept softly down the stairs, listening to the long
drawn breathing of her father in his bedroom, and then,
by the light of a guttering candle, scrawled a note to him.
begging him not to trust himself out of the house until
she returned from her search, and. leaving the note open
on the table, swiftly ran out into the growing day.. â 
Three hours afterward Mr. Madison Clay awoke to the
sound of loud knocking. At first this forced itself upon
his consciousness as his daughter's regular morning sum
mons, and was responded to by a grunt of recognition
and a nestling closer in the blankets. Then he awoke with
a start and a muttered oath, remembering the events of
last night, and his intention to get up earlyâ and rolled
out of bed.
Becoming aware by this time that the knocking was at
the outer door, and hearing the shout of a familiar voice,
he hastily pulled on his boots, his jean trousers, and, fast
ening a single suspender, over his shoulder as he clattered
down stairs, stood in the lower room. The door was open,
and waiting upon the threshold was his kinsmanâ an old
ally in many a blood feudâ Breckenridge Clay!
"You are a cool one, Mad," said the latter in half ad
miring indignation. - ' â¢;
"What's up?" said the bewildered Madison.
"You ought to be, and scootin 1 out o' this," said Breck
enridge grimly. "It's all very well to 'know nothln'.' but
here's Phil Larrabee's friends hey just picked him up,
drilled through with slugs and deader nor a crow, and
now they're lettin' loose Larrabee's two half brothers on
you. And you must go like a d d fool and leave these
yer things behind you in the bresh," he went on queru
lously, lifting Madison Clay's dust coat, hat. and shotgun
from* his horse, which stood saddled at the door. "Luckily
I picked them up in the woods comin' here. Ye ain't got
more than time to get over the State line and among your
folks thar afore they'll be down on you. Hustle, oid man!
What are you gawkin' and starin' at?"
Madison Clay had stared amazed and bewilderedâhor
ror-stricken. The incidents of the past night for the first
time flashed upon him clearlyâ hopelessly! The shot, his
finding Salomy Jane alone in the woods, her confusion and
anxiety to rid herself of him, the disappearance of the
shotgun, and now this new discovery of the taking of his
hat and coat for a disguise! She had killed Paul Larra
bee in that disguise, after provoking his first harmless
shot! She, his own child. Salomy Jane, had disgraced
herself by a man's crimeâ had disgraced him by usurping
his right, and taking a mean advantage, by- deceit, of a
foe!
"Gimme that gun." he said hoarsely.
Breckenridge handed him the gun In wonder and
slowly gathering suspicion. Madison examined nipple and
muzzle; one barrel had been discharged; it was true. The
gun dropped from his hand.
"Look here, old man." said Breckenridge, with a dark
ening face, "there's bin no foul play here. Thar's bin no
hiring of men, no deputy to do this job. You did it fair
and â yourself."
"Yes. by God!" burst out Madison Clay in a hoarse
voice. "Who says I didn't?"
Reassured, yet believing that Madison Clay had nerved
himself for the act by an overdraft of whisky, which bad
remark. "Does he know?"
"Of course he doesn't know, you goose," responded
Dorothy. "If he did. I think he would be sorry you were
not actually killed in that horrid fight. But do not ask
any more questions, for I do not know any more about it
than you do. All I know is that you are to call at our
house this evening, and do not forget to come, for am
as anxious as you are to know what it is all about."
"As if I would forget." he began, but what he con
cluded with is really not pertinent to the case.
After he and the major wore introduced to each other
that evening by the fair Dorothy, the major did not lose
much time in opening the conversation.
"I have been told, Mr. Templeton," he said, '"that you
arranged the details of the mimic battle that we wit
nessed this afternoon."
"Well, yes sir." said Fairfax. "The boys rather in
sisted on my taking charge of the affair. I hope you were
pleased with our efforts."
"The ideas were well worked out and, I should say,
faithfully executed," said the major. "Allow me to con
gratulate you on the military knowledge and dramatic
talent which you undoubtedly possess. I presume you
read somewhere of the little incident which you deftly
wove into the close of the battle."
"Well, no," answered young Templeton. "It was the
representation of an incident which really nappened dur
ing one of the battles in the Wilderness. My father told
me of it."
"And your father â "
"Was the Confederate officer who succored the Union
soldier. He never took much credit to himself for the act,
but I remembered the story and thought the scene would
bear repetition."
The major was silent for a moment, then he excused
himself and left the room. The young rolks were still
unenlightened as to the cause of the invitation to call,
but they apparently had a great many things to say to
each other, for it was really quite late when Fairfax
departed.
The next afternoon the major walked into the music
room where Dorothy was caroling aa blithely as though
such a thing as war had never been heard of.
"Dorothy," he said, "order the carriage brought
around and get yourself ready to make a call with me."
"Where are we going?" she asked sweetly as she
arose from the piano.
"To Colonel Templeton's," he said, and walked out of
the room.
Would wonders never cease? First he had invited
Fairfax to the house, though for what reason she could
not imagine, and now he was actually going to beard the
colonel in his den. But there was no good in speculations
on the subject, and 6he was soon ready for the incom
prehensible visit.
A little later they were in the colonel's parlor, and
presently Colonel Templeton himself stood before them,
as tall and commanding as ever, but with a smile of.wel
come on his face. Fairfax had entered the room- with
him and quietly advanced to Dorothy's side, where he
stood a trifle closer to her than was really necessary.
"Colonel Templeton," said the major, "I have come
to restore to you a little article which I nave recently
learned is your personal property. You loaned it to me
over twenty-five years ago in the State of Virginia, and
during the whole quarter of a century I have never lost
the hope that some day I might be able to return ft to
the hand of the brave man who risked his life when he
bestowed it upon me."
With these words he held out his hand, and in the
outstretched palm lay a. linen handkerchief from which
time had not been able to efface a number of curious
pink stains. The colonel took a step forward and grasped
the major's hand with his own. the blood-stained hand
kerchief being crushed in the forgiving clasp.
"Furthermore." continued the major, "on behalf of
General Baker Post. Grand Army of the Republic I
cordially invite Stonewall Jackson Camp of Confederate
Veterans to participate with us on Memorial day in hon
oring the heroic dead who. however divided their lives,
are sleeping their last long sleep together."
A few weeks later Major Mortimer and Colonel Tem
pleton marched arm-in-arm at the head of a little pro
cession to the cemetery, and there under the weeping
willow and the sighing cypress reverently bared their
heads as the choir softly chanted:
; 'Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment day;
Love and tears for the Blue,
Tears and love for the Gray."

TWO CUBANS
IN A PARIS CLUB
IT WAS !n 1888 or 1889, while I was rejoicing in the
proud privileg-es of an "etudiant en philosophic"' at
the Sorbonne in Paris, that I, in common with many
of my fellow students, was a member of the "Cercle
de la belle lune." The club met in a brasserie in the
boulevard St. Michel, and as significantly Implied by
its name, held its meetings exclusively after nightfall.
It was aot a merely social club; its functions wero og

Madison Clay no longer hesitated. Salomy Jane might
return at any momentâ it would be part of her fooi wom
anishness"âand he was in.no mood to see her before a
third party. He laid the note on the table, pave a hurried
glance around the house, which he grimly believed he wan
leaving forever, and, striding to the door, leaped on the
stolen horse, and swept away with his kinsman.
But that note lay for a week undisturbed on the table,
ln full view of the open door. The house was invaded by
leaves pine cones, birds and squirrels during the hot.

bounds and spread over the woods. And one night a
stronger blast than usual swept through the hnuse, car
ried the note from the table to the floor, where, whirled
into a crack in the flooring, it slowly rotted.
But though the sting of her father's reproach was
spared her Salomy Jane had nn need of tne letter to
know what had happened. For. as she entered the woods
in the dim light of that morning, she saw the figure of
Dart gliding From the shadow of a pine toward her. The
unaffected cry of joy that rose from her lips died there
as she caught sight of his face in The open light. p

a more serious nature. It fulfilled the purposes of Instruc
tion and amusement simultaneously, and served to foster
all the arts.
Oratory, poetry, music and the drama were repre
sented in the club arid the votaries of each found a sym
pathetic, though critical, audience.
Musical talents received the warmest welcome of all,
and relying on this circumstance. Armand Vielieville, one
of our most popular members, presented himseir one night
in company with two of the blackest looking negroes it
has ever been my fortune to encounter. Armand Intro
duced them with much ceremony as Don Carlos and Don
Hernando Jimenez, pere et flls, two Cufcan gentlemen,
â whose friend he had the felicitous honor of being.
The first thing to impress itself on the mind of an
American, on first beholding these negroes, was the differ
ence in physiognomy between them and the types gen
erally seen in the Southern States. Intelligence fairly
gleamed in the eyes of the Cubans. Dressed in correct
evening attire, their deportment a very model of elegant
courtesy, they gained, rather than lost, in the contrast
with the noisy students by whom they were surrounded.
Brilliant conversationalists they both were, albeit the
elder Jimenez spoke French less fluently than hi 3 son,
who had received his education in New Orleans.
"When the fact was made known that they were pro
fessional violinists, they found it impossible to resist our
somewhat boisterous invitations to play, and instruments
were quickly provided.
That night will never fade from my memory. SineÂ©
then I have heard- the violin played by men of many
nations, by trained masters and by nature"s born geniuses,
but never as those Cuban refugees played It. The reper
toire on which they drew contained nothing but the melo
dies of their native isle, but with those they swayed us
as they would. We could hear cries of murdered men,
the shouts of the Spanish oppressor and the dying shrieks
of the Cuban slave. â¢
Throughout that evening we sat and listened en
tranced to the history of Cuba, told in music by masters.
And when we finally allowed our guests to rest from
their labor of love they complemented in burning prose
their passionate song of patriotism.
What a tale they told! There was no room for doubt
In our minds, for truth lay in every inflection of their
softly modulated voices. They spoke dispassionately,
almost coolly, as though they were speaking of things
that were, because they had to be.
The Jimenez themselves had been compelled to flee the
island. They had returned home from a ptrformance one
night, to find the wife and mother dead, tne two daugh
ters and sisters mutilated, one unconscious, the other
dying. The house had been plundered of all worth taking.
After procuring succor for the wounded and burial for
the dead father and son sought vengeance. With the
help of some desperate fellow sufferers they inflicted
severe losses on the .small detachments ana stragglers of
the Spanish military that infested the neighborhood. But
ultimately the attention of the Government was attracted
to the frequency and severity of these reprisals, and the
annihilation of an entire detachment of foragers was
â¢attended with fatal conseauences for most of the
avengers.
A large force was sent against the latter, and they
w>re lured into an ambush and surrounded. The rebels
made a desperate resistance, but were at last overpowered
by weight of numbers. Two only managed to cut their
way through, and owing to the fleetness of their horses
they made good' their escape. These two were the
Jimenez, father and son. For a week they were closely
pursued, but at last they reached the coast. Fortune
favored them here, for they found an American steamer
about to sail, and on her they were granted a safe asylum.
But exiles they would henceforth remain, if not until
Cuba was free, at least until another effort should ba
made to liberate the unhappy island from the Spanish
incubus.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
I read In a Havana dispatch the other day that Her-
Tiando Jimenez, well known as a -violinist, had been cap
tured in a skirmish by the Spanish cavalry and had been
shot as a rebel. I think it more than probable that hia
murdered family was well avenged before he yielded up
his life to the assassins of his nearest and dearest.
The dispatch announcing his execution mentioned that
as the bullets pierced him lie shouted "Viva Cuba Libre."

AN OFFICIAL STUDY OF DEATH
I HAVE been studying a book with a
dark blue cover fresh f- >m the
presses of her Majesty's printer, a
book that cdfctls with one of the
most fascinating of all subjectsâ
"Death." This book contains no mor
alizing and notheories.it does not teach
you how to die, nor advise you how to
live. It sticks closely to its business of
presenting facts, o-f showing you how
people have been dying in London and
England of recent years â to be more
precise, in the years of 1890, 1891 and
1892.
One of the first tables shows that
men who have some regular occupation
may face death more serenely than
those who have none. This is especi
ally true between the. ages of 20 and 35,
when the death rate for "unoccupied
males" is from three to six times
greater than for those with occupation,
six times greater at 20 and three times
greater at 35.
We next are shown the advantage of
living in agricultural districts away
from large cities. Comparing the death
rate of "occupied males" (whom we
shall consider exclusively from this
point on) we find, that the mortality
In London, taking the period in life
from 25 to 65, is 20 per cent above the
average, while in the agricultural dis
tricts it is 28 per cent below the aver
age. And still less favorable is the lot
of those who live in the industrial re
gions, the gTeat manufacturing centers
like Sheffield and Birmingham, since foi
them the death rate rises to 31 per cent
above the average.
Statistics are given of twenty-four
diseases or causes of death, and five
of these, viz: Phthisis, diseases of the
nervous system, diseases of the circu
latory system, bronchitis and pneumo
nia, cause more than half of the en
tire mortality. Cancer kills more than
Influenza, while suicide is directly re
sponsible for more deaths than alco
holism. : It is, however, expressly
pointed out that alcoholism contributes
to many deaths that are put down to
other causes. In certifying the cause
of death of inebriates it is the habit or
some medical men to state only the
pathological condition of the organ or
organs chiefly affected.
The experience of this office shows
that cirrhosis of the liver, for instance
(the liver is the organ which more than
any other is affected prejudicially by
intemperance), Is frequently returned
j The nearest towns to the locality re
ferred to are Cahto, Covelo, Fort Bragg
| and "Westport. They am scattered
[ around it at about even intervals. A
! journey of not more than twenty miles
brings you into this enchanted land,
and it is a trip well worth the time
even though you are not a sportsman.
Leaving any of the towns mentioned
the way for some distance will be over
fine roads, which will gradually merge
into the wildest kind of mountain
trails. This part of the journey is like
traveling through a fairy forest. For
a distance the trail climbs over rocks
and bowlders and then dives beneath a
redwood forest. Here the ground be
neath your feet is deeply covered with
the aromatic leaves that have fallen
from the trees above. Each footfall is
' as the sole cause of death in such cir
cumstances, the fact that abuse of al
cohol had induced the cirrhosis, or other
morbid condition, being omitted from
I the certificate. There is a special table
: given for alcoholism, showing compara
i tive mortality figures, and social phil
: osophers will shake their heads wisely
, when they see, at the very head of the
list, the keepers of inns and hotels,
their servants and the whole tribe of
brewers and distillers. Men of these
classes, that is, the dispensers of alco
hol, die of its effects from three to ten
times faster than the average of "oc
cupied males," three times faster for
the brewer, ten times faster for the
London hotel servant. On the other
hand the mortality from alcoholism
among agricultural laborers, railway
men, iron and tin and coal miners,
clergymen, fishermen and others is far
below the average, only one-third or
one-fourth of it, while in the case of
soap manufacturers, lead workers, cop
per miners and carpet manufacturers,
no deaths whatever are recorded from
alcoholism. It would be of interest to
know if there is some subtle relation
between soap making and total absti
nence.
At the lower end of the table of phthi
sis, the favorable end, are found clergy
men, who seem to get part of their re
ward for right living in the form of
fortified health. Not only in phthisis
but in pneumonia and other diseases of
the respiratory organs they enjoy a de
gree of immunity shared by no other
class. Next to clerymen in power of
resisting these diseases come farmers
and schoolmasters. Physicians are
better fortified than ordinary men
against diseases of the lungs, and in
this they resemble coal miners, railroad
men and hosiery manufacturers.
On the other hand, phthisis and pneu
monia work nearly twice their average
havoc among general laborers in the
industrial districts and among tin min
ers and copper miners, the susceptibil- i
ity of copper miners here being the j
more remarkable that they have the j
best place in several other lists, notably
those of influenza, diabetes, alcoholism
and diseases of the nervous system. To
be a <ropper miner, then, Is to have an i
excellent chance of long life, unless
something goes wrong with the lungs.
And perhaps this also may be fairly
deduced, that for one born with a ten
dency to lung trouble, the choice of oc- i
cupations should lie between preaching, j
tilling the soil, manufacturing hosiery j
and coal mining. 1

as noiseless as if it pressed a velvet
carpet. A profound silence reigns and
a green twilight fills the grove of giant
trees. Here and there a faint ray of
sunlight strikes the ground, but it has
so filtered through the mysterious
tangle of branches overhead that it
has lost all its force and looks like a
delicate vapor rising heavenward.
Suddenly, as the road emerges from
the forest and abruptly descends into a
canyon, the sound of running water
strikes your ear. At first it is only a
murmur, but soon it grows louder, until
it is almost a roar. Where does the
sound come from? â One moment it
seems straight ahead, and the next far
up in the mountain. Now you hear it
on the right and now on the left. Then
the leaves of the trees rustle in the
wind and the splashing sound seems to
Looking over other lists I find that
chimney sweeps have nearly four times
the tendency of ordinary men to con
tract cancer, that general laborers are
the most fortunate in escaping gout;
lead workers and file makers die
about three times oftener than the or
dinary citizen from Bright's disease,
which is almost never contracted by
tallow soap manufacturers (here we
have the mystery of soap making
again); that coal miners and lace mak
ers show only half the general liabil
ity to liver disease; that seven ordi
nary men die from accidents for every
schoolmaster who so dies; that paper
manufacturers are practically free
from rheumatic fever, although book
binders suffer from it cruelly; that coal
heavers, porters and metal workers sel
dom die from diabetes, although that
disease carries off three times as many
glass manufacturers and four times as
many lawyers as the average calls for.
These facts and hundreds like them
come forth serenely from the figures
and statistics, let who will account for
them.
Some conclusions drawn by the sta
tistician as to the diseases which
threaten most in this or that occupa
tion are worthy of attention. "The
clergy," he says, "experience more than
double the average mortality from dia
betes, and one and a half times thÂ»
average from rheumatic fever." It is
true, however, that "in no other occu
pation in the list is the mortality fig
ure of the whole body of men employed
so low as in that of clergymen." But
the gÂ» deners and farmers come clos*
after t..em.
Of the legal profession he says,
"Lawyers suffer exceptionally from in
fluenza, cancer, nervous diseases, dis
eases of the liver, Bright's disease and
diabetes; their mortality from the ma
lady last named being four times the
average." On the other hand, "lawyers
suffer less severely than do occupied
males in the aggregate from phthisis,
heart disease and lung diseases."
Of the medical profession he says
"The records of 1890-92 confirm those of
1873-82 as to the comparative immunity
enjoyed by medical men from phthisis
respiratory diseases and accident. Their
special liability Is to death by gout,
diabetes, urinary diseases and suicide.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The tendency to the commis
sion of suicide has notably increased
among medical men since the earlier
period." There surely is something for
the sociologist to ponder.
Next we find that the mortality figure
go dancing through the forest, like an
army of elves.
While you are looking about, vainly
trying to locate the sound, hearing it on
all sides at once, you will most likely
come right on top of the cause of it.
At your feet will be a dazzling water
fall. And there are dozens of them in

Of course, there is no telling what
kind of a trout this will be; there are
so many in these streams. It may be
of school teachers is one-third less than
the average for other occupations. "At
ages under 35 it is bolow even that of
clergymen, but at ages from 35 to 55
years school teachers die more rapidly
than do the clergy. In common with
other professional men schoolmasters
and teachers suffer much more severely
from diseases of the heart than they
do from diseases of the respiratory sys
tem; but, -whereas among the other pro
fessions it is heart disease which is nu
merically the most prevalent cause of
death, among school masters phthisis is
rather more fatal than heart disease."

he says: "The comparative mortality
figure in this group is considerably
lower than the average. From alco
holism the mortality figure of artists,
etc., is below the average, although
they suffer more severely than the
average from diseases of the liver.
They die more than twice as fast as
do occupied males (in the aggregate)
from diabetes, but more slowly from
phthisis and also more slowly from dis
eases of the circulatory and respiratory
systems."
Our friend, the statistician, has a poor
idea of musicians, whom he finds "sad
ly addicted to intemperance." They die
more than twice as rapidly as ordinary
men from alcoholism, nearly twice as
rapidly from phthisis, and very much
more rapidly from nervous diseases,
liver diseases and suicide.
Commercial travelers show a high
mortality, considering the large amount
of time they spend in the op-in alr.At
coholism ami liver disease are the chief
causes of this heightened death rate,
which increases as they pass middle
lite. "Commercial travelers die from
diabetes almost as fast again as the
average, and from cancer faster than
the average by 43 per cent; they also
suffer exceptionally from Bright's dis
ease. Their mortality from phthisis and
from diseases of the respiratory system
is, however, below the average."
So the record goes on over many
pages with considerations In detail) of
not less than 100 different occupations.
Of those engaged in agriculture, it may
be said that their death rate is far be
low the others. To all diseases, save
one â influenzaâ they show less liability
than ordinary men. And there is no
foundation in statistics for the theory
that there is an excess of suicide among
dwellers on farms.
Altogether this blue book, "presented
to both houses of Parliament by com
mand of her Majesty," presents many
curious and important facts which
might doubtless be made the text of
many sermons could one but grasp
their full significance. I am still think
ing of those fortunate soap manufac
turers, who escape so many things, and
of the poor chimney sweep, who seems
fated to die of cancer.

' the audacious rainbow trout, the strong
silversides, the mountain trout or the
king of them all, the salmon trout, that
frequently weighs as much as thirty
pounds. The cool waters of these Men
docino rivers develop to the utmost the
gamey qualities of the inhabitants of
their depths.
The trout streams in this portion of
the State show no signs of a falling off
of the finny tribe. In fact, in many of
the Eel River tributaries there are
more fish now than there ever were.
This whole section is teeming with
game. The copses are full of grouse
and mountain quail and valley quail.
In the forests can be found deer, hare
and gray squirrel. Birds of all kinds
are numerous.
A few years ago it was feared that
the deer in this section might be ex
terminated, but in spite of the great
slaughter of the animals their numbers
have increased.
ETIQUETTE OF THE U. S. NAVY
THE many little points of etiquette
observed on board an American
man-of-war are distinctly worth
public interest. From the mo-
ment an officer or man steps
aboard until after he has left he must
observe conventional ceremonials of
many kinds.
In the first place in going aboard or
leaving the ship the starboard gang
way is reserved for the use of the com
missioned officers and their visitors
All others must use the port gangway.
Upon stepping aboard the first thing
to be done is to "salute the deck," by
touching or lifting the hat or cap. This
is meant as a mark of respect to the
colors, and is acknowledged by the of
ficer of the deck. The quarter-deck is
sacred to the officers, and the side of it
occupied by the officer of the deck is
generally avoided even by them. No
enlisted men are permitted to go on the
quarter-deck except on duty.
One of the prettiest of naval cere
monies takes place when the colors are
hoisted at 8 a. m., and again when
they are lowered at sunset. These two
functions are accompanied by appro
priate military music, all hands, offi
cers as well as men, who happen to be
on deck at the time, standing up at
"attention," facing aft and uncovered,
until the colors reach the flagstaff
head or are lowered into the arms of
the quartermaster who receives them,
as the case may be.
It is customary for officers always to
salute the captain when passing him,
but not to salute each other on board
ship, when merely passing, except
when, on duty, an official communica
tion is to be made. The junior always
salutes first, the senior returning the
salute. The men always salute an of
ficer when addressing or being ad
dressed by him.
Officers below the grade of comman
der are always addressed as plain
"Mr.," with the exception that the sur
geons are called "doctor." In the fa
miliar unofficial intercourse the chief
engineer is addressed as "chief" and
the paymaster as "pay." Usually the
marine officer is jocularly spoken to as
"major" or "colonel."
Commanders and captains are al
ways called "captuin," and commodores
and admirals are addressed by their
In no part of California can such fine
deer shooting be obtained as here in
the heart of Mendocino County. Nearly
every year hunters come to the vicinity
of the deer cover and go into camp two
or three weeks before the season opens,
which is usually the first of July or
August, The reason for going into
camp so long before the beginning of
the season is to get hardened up so as :
to be in trim to enioy the sport. To
thoroughly enjoy deer shotting a man i
must be in such condition that he will
not get tired out after a few hours in
the hills. He must be able to ride all
day and then be almost as fresh as
when he started.
But what royal sport It is. You wake
up long before daylight, and after dis- l
posing of a hearty camp breakfast at j
once take to the trail on the road to the
deer cover. Horses and dogs seem to i
enter into the spirit of the chase and
the blood tingles with excitement!
titles. But the commanding officer of
a vessel, no matter what his rank, is
always addressed by those under him
as "captain." Many small vessels and
torpedo-boats are commanded by lieu
tenants and even by ensigns, yet they
are called "captain" as long as they re
tain command.
Unlike civil life, the navy regards it
as a compliment to drop the "Mr." in
personal conversation between officers.
The application of that little prefix im
plies wide disparity in rank, and a
junior thus feels flattered by the eleva
tion to equality made by a senior in
dropping it.
The most striking illustration of this
peculiarity is to be found at the Naval
Academy, where the Fourth Classmen,
or "plebs," are ostentatiously termed
"misters," and the "Mr." is always
used in addressing them. "When, at
the end of their plebedom. they enter
the third class, they gleefully welcome
the dropping of th-e prefix in conver
sation with the other upper classmen,
and the worst snub a rirst or second
classman can give to one of the third
class is to make use of the old "Mr."
again in speakinc to him.
There are certain interesting: formali
ties in entering:, leaving and sitting in
the ship's small boats. Entrance goes
according to rank, junior first, in con
formity -with the principle that the cap
tain is alvrays last to abandon his ship.
In sitting in the boat, the senior sits
farthest aft, the others ranging them
selves forward of him according to
gradation of rank. In leaving the boat
the senior goes first, which suggests
the rule that in an attack on shore, or
a boarding party, the senior leads thÂ«
way.
There are three principal ceremonies
attending the official arrival on board,
or the departure from a ship, of per
sons of rank. One is the "piping over
the side," consisting of the attendance
at the gangway of from two to eight
side boys, and the long, shrill piping
of the boatswain as the person honored
comes or goes over the side. For a
commanding officer, admiral or other
high functionary, the marine guard is
paraded on the quarter-deck. present-
Ing arms, with the field music giving
the appropriate number of "ruffles" as
the functionary passes along the deck
to or from the gangway. This is thÂ«
second honor. The third is the firing
of gun salutes, the number of guns de
pending upon the personal rank. The
President of the United States an<J
through your own veins.
If you know the country you will not
have long to wait for a shot here in the
wilds of Mendocino County. Possibly a
small herd will dash across your path,
and if you are lucky you may bring
down one. At any rate it is hardly pos
sible that the day will pass without
your getting at least two. Certainly it
will be your own poor ability as a shot
that is the cause, for the deer are there
if you only know how to kill them.
But it is on the wild slopes of Signal
Peak that the finest big game hunting
can be found. Here is sport worthy of
the nerve of any knight of the g-un.
Here cinnamon and black bear are
plentiful. Panther and lynx can also
be found, and the gray wolf at timea
makes his presence known.
In fact, in the wilds of Mendocino
County can be found sport for any nim
rod and pleasure for the nature lover.

members of royal families receive
twenty-qne guns, the national salute,
which is the highest number officially
recognized. Other officials receive
varying numbers below this, the fol
lowing being examples: Admiral, sev
enteen guns; vice-admiral, fifteen;
rear-admiral, thirteen; commodore*,
eleven. Governors of States, Cabinet
Ministers, diplomatic representatives,
generals of the army and consular of
ficers are all entitled to gun salutes.
The salute is not fired until the ob
ject of them is in his boat and pulla
ahead of the ship, when the first gun ia.
fired and his flag is unfurled from the
masthead, to be pulled down with the
last gun. While the salute is in prog
ress the visitor's boat stops, proceeding:
after the last gun.
It is a marked breach of courtesy to
fire either more or less guns than the
person saluted is entitled to, and when
such is done his representative prompt
ly calls upon the saluting ship for an.
explanation, and if this is not satisfac
tory serious offense is given.
There is ceremony even in marking
the passage of time onboard ship. There
is a clock near the captain's cabin,
which the captain's orderly watches,
and each half hour he goes on deck,
and saluting, reports to the officer of
the deck the number of bells, such aa
"one bell, sir." "three bells, sir," and so
on. The officer returns the orderly's
salute, says "Very good," and then di
rects the messenger boy to strike the
proper number of bells.
But at 8 a. m., noon and Rp. in. there
Is a marked difference. These hours
are reported to the officer of the deck,
not as "eight bells," but as "eig*ht
o'clock," or "twelve o'clock." The offi
cer then tells the orderly to report the
hour to the captain, and the eight bells
are not struck until the captain directs
it, through the mediums of the orderly,
the officer of the deck and the messen
ger. It is not 8 a. m., noon, nor 8 p. m.,
officially, until the captain orders
"Make It so." It not infrequently hap
pens that the captain plays Joshua and
postpones the hour, as he sees fit.
No one on board can see the captain
in his cabin without first sending in his
name by the latter's orderly. An offi
cer cannot see the captain on any offi
cial business, of hip own Initiative,
without stating it to and receiving per
mission from the executive officer. En
listed men must obtain the further per
mission of the officer of the deck beforÂ©
interviewing the executive officer.

LET US "REMEMBER THE MAINE"
SOME of the good people of Massachusetts have
thought best to petition Secretary of the Navy-
John D. Long:
As the ostensible and only Justifiable motive for
entering upon the war with Spain was the deliver
ance of a neighboring people and ourselves from
relations to them that had become intolerable, we
wish to express our abhorrence of the spirit of ven
geance manifested in such a war cry as â¢â Remember
the Maine," and beg you to refuse to purchase
goods of any kind carrying this motto, and in all
ways to discourage and discountenace the use or
this motto or any other calculated to foster the
spirit of savagery against which we are contending.
How our good people view such a movement can
be Judged by the following, selected at random from
hundreds of opinions:
John Harrison Macomber, Post Chaplain, TJ. S. A.
While I believe that the Spanish are responsible"
for the destruction of the Maine I still think that the
chief object of this war is to establish the principles
of humanity and Justice rather than to revenge our
selves for that most tragic breach of national faith.
Personally I cannot say that I approve of the use of
"Remember the Maine" as a war cry or a motto, since
It tends to make the present conflict seem revengeful
rather than purely patriotic.
E. W. Marston, Oakland.
If there is anything in the world that true Ameri
cans ought to remember and be continually reminded
of it is the tragedy of the Maine. We cannot say nor
hear too much about it either on the battlefields or
here at home. Let us hear those three words In war
cries and see them on badges and buttons until this
war ends in victory for the Stars and Stripes, which
we all love and honor.
Attorney Eugene F. Bert.
My idea is that it is the Maine incident which is
the prime cause of the intense war feeling which pre
vails throughout the United States; in the minds of
the great mass of the people the Cuban matter is quite
secondary. It is right and just that Cuba should be
freed from oppression and tyranny, but to the rank
and file of our brave soldiers and marines the thought
of their brothers murdered in cold blood in a pre
sumably friendly harbor means more than anything
else. "Remember the Maine" should be our war cry,
for with those words ringing in their ears our soldiers
will fight as men only fight for those near and dear
to them, and war means fighting, and the harder our
men fight the quicker the war will be over with honor
to our country. We owe it to ourselves and the men
of the Maine not only to remember but to avenge
them.

Honor.
In every war there has always been a battle cry,
and as this, for reasons the justice of which no one
can doubt, has become ours, we might as well keep it.
The men who are doing the fighting think it appro
priate and expressive and we for whom they are fight
ing ought not to try to interfere with them in this
regard. Perhaps it does sound a bit revengeful, but
we are only human, and our hearts have been mightily,

FOLLOWED HER HURBAND
TO EXILE AND DEATH
I DIE standing or I fall with honor."
It was no stern military man who
took those words for life-blazon. My
first recollections of the speaker
bring before me a picture which
Rubens would have loved to paint; a
queenly beauty in a rich, artistic
frame, a woman whose Juno-like throat
rose, white and seductive amid her dra
peries of yellow satin and black lace,
whose prematurely white hair was
worn as a crown of glory, and who
swept across her salon with welcoming
white hands and the air of the aid
French regime. For the moment I for
got the whispered tales of heroism I
had heard and only thought of my
hostess as one who would have graced
a throne. In after days, when our lives
were knit in one of the closest intima
cies that can befall two of the same
sex, I learned that beneath those grace
fully worn draperies beat not only the
heart of a tender woman but the heart
of a soldier.
Tears before-, when France was pass
ing through her great throes of an
guish, Juliette RastouPs beautiful face
had gladdened the terror-stricken, the
wounded and the dying. Through the
appalling days of the Invasion, the
siege of Paris and the Commune, she
was to be seen by the side of her hus
band, the eminent surgeon, wherever a
woman's deft touch, a woman's cheer
ing smile and a woman's keen sym
pathy could relieve suffering. A first
unionâ the union of a child-wife, or
dered from the convent to the altar
had taught her that wealth and luxury
do not necessarily bring heart's ease,
and now, hand in hand with a man she
adored, she labored in the oause of pa
triotism at a time when most women
seek seclusion and persona! comfort.
At length the crucial moment came
and the hour of mortal agony rang out
for Paris and for Juliette Rastoul; she
faced the perils of childbirth alone^
while the husband whom she had*
helped to save others was struggling
, V
(
stirred during this past quarter of a year, bo we are
excusable if .we show a little human feeling in this ,
matter. For my part I say keep the Maine's memory p

civilians forget it even if they would. -;i(

for his country amid the wails of the
dying Commune. To her this seemed
but a little sacrifice; France, at such a
time, was more important than the
wife and mother; but when, four days
later, news came of Dr. Rastoul's ar
rest the supremacy of the wife asserted
itself. Defying ordinary prudence, she
rose from her sickbed, wrapped her
babe to her bosom, bid her children by
the first marriage cling to her, and sal
lied forth, in the strength of her weak
ness and her love, to seek her husband
in the Jaws of death.
By what persuasive power, by what
pathetic courage she won her way past
all obstacles perhaps she alone could
have told. There is something in the
eight of a young mother pleading for
her babe's father which appeals to
ever}' mother's son, and beauty is a
precious gift when bestowed on a wise
woman. Before sunset Mme. Rastoul
found herself outside Paris gazing
wild-eyed at a sinister group â a victim
bound to a tree while soldiers stood,
ready to fire at the word of command.
Suddenly a passionate cry rang
through the air: "Stop! That man is
my husband, and you shall not kill
him."
The startled soldiers turned angTily
to confront a madonna group; a wo
man, pale from illness, glorified by love,
her nursling at her breast and two
scared children clinging to her skirts.
"Back," they protested, sulkily, "this
Is no place for you."
"My place is by his side; he has only
lived to save others, he shall be saved
in turn; take me to your captain!"
"Back woman!" And half a dozen
bayonets pressed on her soft bosom.
Her arms only tightened round the
babe.
"Kill me If you please; I am a French
woman; I die standing, not fleeing!
But while you leave life in me I protest
against that murder. Take me to your
captain."
After all she was a French woman,
with her love for sole offense. They
took her to the captain.
And Dr. RastouPs reprieve was won.
Then came week after week of weary
watching and wandering, of attending
trials, struggling with hopes and fears,
and following from afar the fortunes

of a beloved prisoner. At length the
doctor was lodged in the grim fortress
of the Isle de Re, amid the rough wat
ers of the Bay of Biscay. As a patriot.
his position was scarcely enviable, yet
he had that to cheer him which falls
to the lot of few prisonersâ the sup
porting consciousness of perpetual,
brooding love. For to that dreary isl
and Juliette Rastoul had followed him
with her babe and little daughter.
Lodged in a poor fisherman's hut, par
taking of the fisherman's meager fare,
her daily life was spent in tramping
aro-und the fort, in rain, wind or sun
shine, for the sake of catching an occa
sional glimpse of the beloved face, of
letting a father's eyes rest now and
again on his little one. The baby
eventually died of undue exposure, and
the mother never forgave herself; but
by her indefatigable love she had re
newed the life of a man who had lost
hope for his country and for himself.
At length the final fiat went forth.
Dr. Rastoul was exiled to New Cale
donia. From that moment his wife
had but one object in lifeâ to follow him
into exile. Possibly she may have
sometimes missed the wealth which in
early years she had valued so lightly,
for money would have smoothed many
difficulties. But her indomitable will
sufficed. Selling everything she poss
essed, she realized enough for her many
expenses, and stood one day with her
children in Havre harbor the only free
woman on board a ship of female con
victs, bound for New Caledonia. But
at the last moment an unlooked-for
Impediment arose. The relatives of
her first husband asserted legal guar
dianship of the children, as Portu
guese subjects, and refused to sanction
their removal from France.
Leave her children behind? Juliette
Rastoul would* not entertain the pro
posal fr.-r a second. Stay away from
her banished husband? The mere sug
gestion was monstrous! For three
days this extraordinary woman con
trived to delay a Government ship
while her lawyers wore out the tele
graph wires fighting for her right of
motherhood; and the female prisoners
prayed and wept in sympathy. "I
don't know what the secret of the
wonderful power was," said her son
once, referring to that vividly remem
bered time, "but I honestly believe
there wasn't a woman on board who
wouldn't have given her life for my
mother's happiness."
Love prevailed once more, and after
six months of lonely exile Dr. Rastoul
welcomed a comrade wife such as few
men can boast of and two children who
were dear to him as his own.
His political offenses had been very
trivial and he was allowed the inde
pendence of a medical man, practicing
his profession. Their modest little
house in Noumea became an active cen
ter of kindly benevolence and an ideal
life seemed dawning for the banished
pair. Do you know Noumea, with its
sensuous, tropical atmosphere, its low,
white-washed homes, set about with
aromatic blossoms, its picturesque na
tives, violet-blue lagoon and back
ground of many tinted hills? At a
first glance it seems the spot par ex
cellence for a lover's retreat. But, alas,
it has a background other than that
of the peaceful, purple-pink hills; its
calm life has a hideous undercurrent
made evident by processions of misera
ble men in clanking chain and fetter,
and happy thoughts are dashed by the
remembrance of scenes dally enacted
behind stone walls. Dr. Rastoul and
his wife were not people to enjoy life
recklessly while their countrymen lan
guished in captivity, and soon It be
came notorious that unwonted small
comforts were finding their way to
weary, half-starved prisoners; myster
ious pipes were smoked surreptitiously,
mysterious delicacies revived appetites
upon which a diet of rice palled; books
or papers suddenly cheered eyes whose
intellectual light seemed to have set.
Worst of all. letters that had not seen
prison supervision were said to have
reached their destination. Officials be
gan to say, hesitatingly, that they
must make a stand for authority; of
ficials' wives, not beautiful, themselves,
protested earnestly that a woman's
good looks were no evidence in her
favor. At length, one morning, the
storm broke and with much display of
uniform and flourish of revolver. Dr.
Rastoul wets arrested in his own house.
"What have I done?" he queried, In
astonishment.
"Well, ah hum, not exactly anything;
fact is, we're afraid of that wife of
yours; she's plotting some mischiefâ so
Just you march off."
"They think they will starve us, I
suppose," quoth Juliette Rastoul, con

NEW YORK, May 27.â The bicycle
girl of '9S will be a beauteous
creature. ' â¢.â¢:'*'
Last year she was new; the
year before she was newer; and
. the year before she was newest.
This year she is settled and she knows
how to dress herself.
Bicycle dresses were bizarre two years
ago and last season they were not much
better. But the bicycle styles this year
are all that can be desired. They are
really beautiful creations,, such as one
would not hesitate to wear anywhere.
In traveling: through New England last
fall I was surprised to notice how many
women wore bicycle dresses. On the
cars, on the boat and journeying by stage
and over land, the bicycle dress was the
rule and the long skirt the exception. It
was really refreshing to note how these
New England ladies stepped on and off
the railroad trains without getting entan
gled in a long skirt. It was delightful to
see how easily they handled their bag
gage without cumbersome folds to
bother them. After a little practice with
the . iort skirt one becomes really grace
ful, and it is safe to say that the long
traveling skirt has been banished from
New England forever.
Would that this might be the rule in
other parts .if the country. In August on
a Lining hot day what is more refresh
ing than the Bight of a young woman in
trim bicycle skirt with natty low shoes
and comfortable blouse waist? And what
is more enjoyable to the young woman
herself than such a. traveling garb?
I noticed last week on a train going to
Lenox, that fashionable Mecca for
wealthy New Yorkers, a young woman in
a traveling suit which caught my eye at
once. It was so "fit." The skirt was made
of a very light weight wool goods with a
fine dot .scattered over it and through it.'
The waist was of the same material with
straps and belt of thin white patent
Wther. The hat was a Tarn of leather
and cloth with plumes stuck in one side.
But the neatest thing was the adjust
ment of the skirt. This consisted of a row
of large smoked pearl buttons set at In
tervals of three inches â  around- the hips.
Connecting the buttons and the belt was
a little silver chain. This chain on being
pulled atone side would lift the skirt un
til it was of convenient bicycle length.
I saw another, later, which had links in-
Ftead of buttons, the silver chain running
through the links. This struck me as be
ing more reliable, as the chain could not
slip off the rings as easily as it could off
the buttons. \
The bloomer bicycle gir! is almost gone;
but not quite. You still see her. She
wears very large bloomers which are so
arranged that when she stands you would
scarcely notice that they were not skirts.
Indeed, you would hardly" notice that fact
even when she rides.' The bloomers are
each two yards around and are brought
up and hooked around the leg in Turkish
trous.;r fashion. They are gathered
around the belt with gcdet in the back so
t.iat really you would not be conscious of
the bloomer. The divided skirt and
bloomer tfifter from each other only in
tn , a .t T - L e b mer hooks around the knee
while the divided skirt falls open.
The suk shirt waist will be worn largely

ludicrous effect, similar to that of a bal

There is a very trim skirt for the cen

The newest things in bicycle suits are
the dresses fn which more attention is
tSa'-RTh? UninS than , t0 the dress?^
terial. liis is positively true of all the
imported suits, and all those that are
row attracting attention in Central Park.
These dresses are the very acme of style
and are so chic in effect that you could
not help (topping to admire them. Their
length i.s about to the calf of the log- and
their color is a dull shade of brown or
gray or blue. Nothing very brilliant Is
worn. But when it cornea to the lining
it is a BCerent mati â¢ â 
One of these dresses seen that sun-
Bhiny Sunday a week ago was of new'
leaf green goods, lined with violiene near
tilk. A .irt waist of violiene China siik
was worn, and over it set a little jacket
with a very short ripple around the waist
The ripple was lined with violiene taf
feta.
The hat was of green, with a scarlet
bird with purple tall-feathers. The gloves
were white.
This tume, while not at all startling
in effect, was very becoming, and was one
of the prettiest seen that Sunday in a
long array of fashionable riders.
Tt is quite the thing to have your stock
ings match your dress skirt. This, if the
match be good, is a very excellent idea,
fis it gives the appearance of leggings
without the cumbersomeness of the same.
With a steel gray skirt and steel gray
stockings the young woman can cycle in
black tics without attracting half the at
tention which she would if she wore black
chocs and stockings, as the contrast be
twern stockings and skirt is very great.
Taffeta linings in bicycle skirts are a
plague. They tear so soon and hang in
long fringes around the feet. And here a
COMPLEXIONS FOR
THE SUMMER GIRL
SUMMER is coming, girls, and with
it some fine, beautiful coats of tan
\\ and any number of freckles for
<2i == >7 the girl upon whom Old Sol casts
his loving beams at the seashore
I and in the mountains. And now is the
timeâ right nowâ for the summer girr to
lay in a supply of cold cream and harm
less lotiona, with which to down these
abominations, that cause so much un
happiness to the feminine heart.
\v<- all of us adore beauty, and seek as
siduously ways and means of acquiring
It. We always have and we always will.
We may to.s.s our heads in a superior,
toploftical sort of way and say that if we
had our choice we would rather have- in
tellect than beauty, but we don't mean it,
and, bless your heart! every one knows
we don't. Why, even Mme. de Stael com
plained that "the ancients evinced no
preference for women except for thoir
beauty," and confessed that she would
give half her knowledge for personal
charms; and Mohammed, that shrewd
observer of human nature, held out as a
chief inducement to the faithful that in
his paradise would be found only the most
perfect beauties. ,
And so, girls, it behooves you all to be
as beautiful as you may, and to be beau
tiful you must in the first place be
healthy The blood must be kept, in a
perfect condition of purity, which can be j
done by paying strict attention to the
diet, exercising as much as possible in
the open air and keeping the skin abso
lutely clean. But I could write a column
lion each one of these subjects.
" However, to return to the summer girl.
In the first place, let mo warn her against
all patent devices for- the improvement of
the skin or hair. Nearly all hair dy.es are
poisonous and dangerous, and most face
powders contain bismuth or lead. _ Every
fvoman should have upon her dressing ta
il* a. jax at KQpa^ Â£uxÂ« oelA cream* X Â«&qJ
word of caution must be spoken. Should
these silk iinirigs ever show a tendency
to catch in the pedals or in the wheels,
push hard and you will find the silk will
{rive, and so you can save yours- If a fall.
It is much better, however, to take the
ounce of prevention than, the pound of
cure, and before you start examine your
facings to be sure that they are firm.
It would be pleasant to say that the
sailor and the Alpine were as fashionable
as the Tarn, because the sailor is so natty
"and the Alpine is so comfortable; but,
when all is told, you must admit that the
Tarn is seen fully three times as much
as the others put together.
The secret of the Tarn's popularity can
be traced to its economy. Anybody with
a grain of ingenuity con make- a Tarn out
of a "wheel" of cloth and an old brim.
It requires no trimmiti- exc< !>t a nuill at
one side, which can be stuck smartly
forward. A dozen Tarns are not too many
to carry a girl through the bicycle season,
onf> to match every shirt waist. It is de
lightful that those hats can be so easily
and cheaply made, for a hat certainly
sets off a "face and figure better if it
harmonizes with the waist in some way.

(^ TAXDIXG all day on her feet
N where her work must be done Is
C^-J) one of the hardest tasks a working
woman encounters. Unless she is
dressed properly this position may cause
rioua trouble. Lame, acning ankles
and feet are oftener the fault of a tight
corset than of tight shoes. The corset
dislocates the organs in the pelvis, caus
ing them to press upon the great nerves
and blood vessels which go to the feet,
making them most painful.
There Is a shoe which can be bought
for $4. with very low heel and broad,
square toes, which is called the "nurse's
shoe" and is much worn by nurses in the
hospitals. It is not a "thing of beauty,"
but it is a "Joy forever" in its proper
place. The heels and soles of this shoe
are made to stand upon, and the body
Is balanced with this in view. When the
wearer cramps the. foot or raises the
heel till all the weight rests on the ball
of the foot, the entire body is out of
balance and must be kept upright by
using up the muscular and nervous force
intended to be usf-<l for such work, hence
the consequent fatigue.
The round-toed shoe has not come to
stay; the new shoes from the East grow
more pointed. There is a brown patent
leather shoe having brown cloth top,
which is rather expensive, but which has
good style.
If you cannot live without a corset, the
very short French ones are less harmful
and give a better figure than the long
ones.
There Is a girdle which worn with
shirt waist and skirt is quite as satis
factory. The waist ends in a stout band
with buttonholes for the tapes, which
button on to the girdle both back and
front. The skirt has corresponding
buttonholes. Euttoned neatly under a
belt there is no -danger of showing safety
pins and slipping skirt.
A lady recently from Japan brought
home some most delightful shirt waists
give you a recipe for one than which there
is none better. It was given me by a wo
man in whose family it has been used for
years. Here it is:
Pure white wax â¢....â  >& ounce
Spermaceti I*4 ounces
Oil of sweet almonds I*4 ounces
Rose water...: % ounce
Go to work, girls, and make it your
selves. It's a bit troublesome, but with
care there is no reason why it shouldn't
come out all right, and it's" lots of fun
fussing over these things.
Take what housekeepers call a farina
boilerâ that is, one kettle- within another.
Take the inside one out and into it break
the white wax and spermaceti. Add your
oil of almonds and set- the kettle back
inside the other, which should contain
boiling water. Don't let them get too
hot, and stir with a silver spoon ' until
the three ingredients are thoroughly . in
corporated.
Remove from the fire and add the rose
water drop by drop, while the mixture is
hot, as the rose water will not mix after
the oils begin to cool. Boat briskly un
til it fluffs up like tne white of an egg.
Then put it into small porcelain jars,
which nave been warmed, and put it away
to cool.
This is both a skin food and cleanser
and will keep it soft and smooth.
For sunburn there is nothing better
than sweet cream. Bathe the face with
it several times and the' redness will soon
die out and the soreness disappear.
Powder the face well with fine starch
or pure powder before going out. This
will prevent sunburn.
Be careful not to bathe the face In cold
water immediately upon coming in.
For the removal of tan- as good a meth
od as any other is to bathe the face in a
wash made of glycerine diluted with lem
on juice. Be careful while using to avoid
exposure to the sun, as the skin is made
more sensitive by its use.
Next week I will give you another recipe
for tan, also one for freckles.

of the Japanese silk. The* waists were
laundered and starched, cuffs, collar and
all, just the same as a cotton waist, but
they have a gloss and beauty no cotton
or linen will take. The silk can be
bought in Chinatown here for from 20
to 50 cents. It is 23 inches wide and in
almost any color, check or striped and
plain.
A blue one to be worn with a white
pique skirt had a box plait with two
inch ruffles down the front of the same
silk in white, with a stock and belt also
of the white. One yard of silk will make
the ruffles, stock and belt. The stock
should be made double and lined with
double-faced cotton flannel.
Pass it twice about the neck and tie in
a four-in-hand knot in front. The belt
is also double with the joining in the
middle of- the under side and not at the
edge. Make it long enough to go twice
about the waist and end in a large bow,
â which should be sewed to the end of the
belt.
Pin the free end of the belt under the
arm, covering the pins as you pans the
belt over the end. The bow may lie
pinned in the front, back, at the side or
brought up t<"> where the top of the first
dart would be.
When wearing a white pique skirt, and
they are quite as much in demand this
year as last, the waist should be rather
dark. The belt should be the same in
color as the tie and the band on the
sailor hat.
The organdies with white background
and large natural flower patterns can be
made into very pretty, inexpensive
bureau covers and sofa pillows. Cover
the top of the bureau with white felting
or cotton flannel. Let the organdie be the
exact size and finish all round with a
four-inch ruffle. Fancy stitch the hem of
the ruffle with heavy silk of the
principal brightest shade in the
flowers of the organdie. It must be care
fully washed by rubbing between the
hands, as the threads easily slip out of
place. Dip it In milk to stiffen and iron
wet on the wrong side on a well-padded
ironing board.

HOW that spring is fully upon us
and the lovers of outdoor sports
are beginning to realize that pro
crastination at this time of the
year is doubly the thief of time, cyclists
are securing their wheels from the dim
recesses of the garret or cellar and are
oiling and polishing them for immediate
use.
The mind of the bicyclienne is occupied
these days with the eternal conflict be
tween the short skirt and the long skirt
and she is trying hard to make up her
mind whether 'twere better to wear leg
gings or gaudy golf stockings.
In the East last season the leggings
and bicycle shoes were almost entirely
discarded. â  In place of these the golf
stocking and laced shoe was used. It is
claimed that the stocking does not wrin
kle over the dainty ankle of the rider as
do the leggings. Besides, they are very
much cooler and give a prettier shape to
the leg than the wrinkling legging gives.
Golf stockings conducing to a more grace
ful effect will, therefore, probably have
the call.
The popular materials for bicycle cos
tumes this season are Scotch tweeds,
tailor cloth Jn gray and black checks and
tan, navy blue. serge, and for use In the
heat of summer denims and other cotton
materials will be In favor. Skirts will
be worn shorter than last season. The
bloomer will not be worn thjÃ season.
The, koJckfirbQckqrfl will xepiftCKk It op, tiie
common sense ground that they are more
comrortable and cooler.
A becoming bicycle dress for a slender
woman is made of tan tailor cloth, the
divided skirt, short, circular and very
j full.
The jacket Is made With the blouse ef
fect in both back and front. A blue
shirtwaist and an ascot tie are worn with
this neat costume. A sailor hat with
several quills will "go" best with the cos
tume.
Golf stockings of tan and blue plaid
and tan lace shoes compose the footwear.
The reign of the Norfolk Jacket is not
yet over. It has been worn for several
years, but is still as popular as ever.
The skirt to be worn with the Norfolk
jacket is a short kilt.
This costume is most effective made of
gray tweed or gray and black tailor cloth.
The most fashionable material for both
men and women's bicycle costumes is
navy blue serge with a fine hair stripe of
white. This cloth is best for the cool
spring days. The full divided skirt is
made very short. The jacket is short,
with a tight-fitting back and a fly from.
A white shirtwaist is to be worn with a
white collar, and a tie of white silk com
pletes the natty costume.
For warm spring days and summer cos
tumes of denim and cotton goods will be
in great demand. A dainty way for
these to be made is shown in the pic
ture. . â 
The skirt Is wide and divided. The
jacket is made with a tight-ntting back
and a loose blouse front. It is trimmed
with several rows of white buttons. A
white linen collar is worn with this ana
a belt of white leather.
Oolf stockings of a shade to match the
dress should be worn, and shoes loose and
comfortable.
The hat is a white sailor with a band
of black velvet around the crown and &
large loop of velvet on the left side.
The style of the boulevards of Paris
may ba adopted at the fashionable sum
mer resorts this season, the knickerboc
ker to the knee and the leg bare from
the knee to the top of the dainty half
hose. It is not probable that the cyclist
in fashionable society in the Unitr-d
States will copy it away from the sea
ehore.
Sweaters are no longer worn by either
men or women. They are negligee ana
wretched form.
Male riders will this year be seen in
negligee ehirts with low turn-down col
lars and soft ties. They will wear tho
orthodox bicycle cap or the new style of
felt deerstalker. Otherwise their costume
will be unchanged.
WHEN a woman must spend six
days a week at work in the city,
it is a duty she owes to herself
to get out into the country on the
seventh.
It is a matter of small expense, and the
change of air and scene ; and thoughts
will give an added zest to the work a
day a week to make up for the cost. Be
sides it is better; to spend a little money
in recreation than to give It to a ; doctor
or spend it for tonics.

Important question If one would have any
real pleasure in a single day's outing-.
Whatever is best adapted for rough
wear is most appropriate, for though you
may look very nice indeed before you
Mart out you will not be properly dressed
for the jaunt unless you look quite as
well when you return home.
For general wear a suit consisting of
skirt, coat, skirt waist and sailor hat is
always presentable, and never more so
than for a one day trip. These dresses
need not be expensive.,, but must be well
made and neat and plain. For from $20
to $25 they can be bought ready made in
blue serge, which for wearing and com
fort have no equal and i.s becoming to
any woman from 15 to 50.
In such a dresa you can w;ilk in the
dust or fog or Bit on the ground and not
feel your trimness disappearing. Noth
ing can be more absurd than the costume
one so very often sees â a woman walking
along a dusty country road, and most
California country roads are dusty, wear
in? a "Sunday dress" shoes and hat,
which have cost her many an hour of
hard work and many a sacrifice of good
food to purchase. One such day's wear
will destroy most of the beauty of such
attire, make the wearer cross f and un
comfortable to her friends, and she must
spend all her time taking care of her
clothes, and have no thoughts for tue
beauties around her.
An almost indispensable article for one
who goes much to the country is a small
handbag. It will hold the lunch and book,
a comb and some hairpins and a small
mirror, and afterwards the flowers and
ferns to brighten the city room and keep
the remembrance of a happy day. Such
a handbag can be bought for from 50
cents to a dollar, and with care will last
a long time.
' For vacation wear a pretty change can
be had in the ginghams, which are with
in reach of very slender purses. If the
bodice is merely a skirt waist it will be
doubly useful, and can be worn much
oftener than \he skirt. A very -pretty
wash dress can made from the 15-cent
chambray, and ten yards will be all that
is required beyond a clever hand almost
any one can own one.
Make the skirt quite plain- with gored
front, and ' for a belt satin folded and
sewed in place to a firm lining. Make the
bodice a skirt waist with adjustable
cuffs. "When worn with the cotton skirt
a stock with a bow tied at the back of the
neck and cuffs with small bows at the top
made of : the same satin or ribbon as the
belt aro very pretty. A bow of the same
may be worn in the hair. ;

ming on plain cotton dressed and while
It requires more time and patience Is
much less expansive Rufnes can be used,
too, on cotton dresses.
A very pretty one has ten-Inch ruffles
from the belt to the hem. The founda
tion skirt must of course be made very
narrow.
NOW that the season for bicycle
riding is well under way a great
many people are reviving with
deep personal interest the old
question of the effect of wheeling upon,
the health.
Dr. John H. Girdner, who is one of the
best known medical authorities in Amer
ica on matters having 1 to do with the ther
apeutics of exercise, says on this subject:
"Bicycle riding is certainly not harmful
when indulged in to moderation. In every
case bicycle riding transforms the mus
cles of the body into kidneysâ that is to
say, it causes all of the muscles of the
body to perform exactly the same func
tions as the kidneys, namely, the work of
eliminating poisonous and other waste
material from the tissues of the body.
"None of the muscles of the legs are In
jured in any way by bicycle riding in i
moderation. All are strengthened to some ;
extent, but particularly. the muscles of the J
thigh, and it is the enlargement of these j
muscles on each thigh that gives that odd |
appearance of unusual fullness to the legs
of athletes just above the knees.
"The muscles of the lower part of the i
leg which are chiefly developed by pedal- ;
ing are those called the tibialis anticus, j
the externus longeus. If you will, look up ,
your school text book on anatomy and
turn to the- diagram showing the location
of the muscles s of the legs you will per
ceive just how the development of these
muscles gives that rounded appearance to
the fore part of the leg of the bicycle
rider to the side of the central bone.
"None of the muscles of the rear of the
thigh are particularly well developed by
bicycle riding, as none of these muscles
perform any other office than merely con- i
tracting and expanding with the move- â 
ment or the leg.
â  "In the hind part of the leg the muscle !
that receives the greatest development is \
the calf muscle. This muscle is developed j
more than any other in. the;legs, with the
exception of the'vastus internus and the j
rectus. The other leg muscle that devel- I
ops so much as to give a rounded appear- I
ance is the soleus, which Is responsible for
the bumpy part of tho leg about the ankle !
of a wheelman. . - "
"And while it is chiefly the muscles of i
the leg that are developed in so marked a j
mnTinp^ by. tlia ridioK cÂ£ a wiieoL jxavar- i
theless there is not a single muscle In the
whole body that it is not brought into
healthy action for some purpose by the
person who rides a wheel."
ALL SORTS OF HINTS.
Bites of insects, auch as fleas or mos
quitoes or bees, will be relieved by rub
bing with a menthol pencil.
Ten minutes' callsthenlc exercise, fol
lowed by a glass of hot (not boiled) milk,
to which has been added a teaspoon of
lime water, will relieve sleeplessness
caused by fatigue of worry. Both must
be taken directly before going to bed.
A liberal use of salt in the food will
destroy the odor of perspiration. In
Australia, where the "blackfellows" are
employed as house servants, they are
required to eat a certain amount of salt
in their food every day.
Before exposure to poison oak, or imme
diately after, poisoning may be avoided
by a hot bath in which has been dissolved
two tablets of bichloride of mercury.
Relief may be obtained after poisoninr
has occurred by washing tho infiamp?
part frequently with a strong solution of
green soap. After bathing â¢ dust with
formaline.
A cross baby Is cross for some good rea
son. Let it lie or play as many hours a
day as possible in the warm, dry sand
or on the earth. The effect will be im
mediate and better than medicine.
Indian babies wear few clothes, live on
the ground and never cry.
Long skirts collect disease germs along:
with the dust and expectorations of tLe
street.
During sleep the entire system is re
laxed and much more liable to receive
the germs of disease than during the
waking hours.
A. diet composed as nearly as possible
of strawberries, cherries or grapes is the
rage in Europe at present as a cure for
dyspepsia. The diet is effective for the
same reason as semi-starvation, usually
prescribed, namely, the noxious germs in
the bowels do not thrive on fruit juices.
A celebratedhjienlth expert, after many
expc-riments, advises the use of .blanched
almonds regularly for brain workers in
place of moat more than once a day.
He also says apples, when they can be
dig* sted by the eater, rest the brain.
Prunes and juicy fruits feed the nerves.
THE ORIGINAL
STAR
SPANGLED BANNER
PRESIDENT McKINLEY has ac
cepted an invitation to deliver
ah oration when the monument
erected to Francis Scott Key at
Frederick, Md., is unveiled.
Almost every one knows the words of
the "Star Spangled Banner," and many
are well acquainted with the history of
the author, but comparatively few
kno# anything concerning the where
abouts of this famous flag, which is
now owned by the grandson of Colonel
George Armistead, historically known
as the "Defender of Baltimore." He
was in command of Fort McHenry in
1814 and owned the star-spangled ban
ner that floated over it and the sight of
which inspired Key to write his im
mortal lines. During the bombardment
Key was a prisoner on one of the at
tacking British vessels.
The bombardment began on Tuesday,
September 12, ISI4, at 7 a. m. and lasted
twenty-five hours with but two brief
intermissions.
Colonel Armistead, although but 35
years of age, had so great an influence
over the men that they bore the attack
with great patience, but at length a
bombshell dismounted one of the twen
ty-four pounders in the southwest bas
tion. This killed Lieutenant Claggett
and several soldiers. The confusion
caused by the work of the bomb was
promptly noted Ly the commander of
the British fleet, who immediately or
dered three of his bomb vessels to
move nearer the fort.
Colonel Armistead was well pleased
at this move of the enemy as his guns
had thus far been useless owing to the
fact that they did not carry far enough.
He waited patiently for the vessels to
come within r. nee and then ordered a
general cannonade and bombardment
from every part of the fort.
So successful were his tactics that
all the ships were injured and the Ere
bus so severel â  t'..z~ it required quite
a fleet of small boats to tow her be
yond the reach o f Armisteads guns.
It was estimated that between 1500
and 1800 shells fell during the engage
ment around the fort, and yet. strange
to relate, but four men were killed and
the twenty-four who were wounded all
recovered. .
During the first part of the assault
a shell fell into the magazine but did
not explode. The fact that the maga
zine was not bomb-proof was known
only by Colonel Armistead. Had the
soldiers been aware of this they might
have refused to have remained in the
fort.
The citizens of Baltimore were enthu
siastic in expressing their admiration
and appreciation of the bravery of the
young colonel whom they styled "the
defender of Baltimore." They present
ed him with a great punch bowl, with
cups, ladle and salver, all of massive
silver. This gift is now owned by one
iof Colonel Armistead's grandchildren.
The bowl is as large as the largest ball
that fell inside the fort.
It was a glorious victory, but the
young hero paid for it with his life, for
; with numerous chance 3 against him he
faithfully sustained the siege and won a
I victory and a name. But the fearful
sense of responsibility during those
long hours left him with a fatal dis
! ease of the heart, from which he suf
| fered for three and a half years. He
was buried with all possible military
and civil honors, the procession that
followed him to the grave being the
largest ever seen in Baltimore, and all
mourned the "defender of Baltimore."
The people of Baltimore erected a
monument, on which is inscribed:
Coftmel George Armistead, in hon
or of whom this monument is erect
ed, was the gallant defender of
Fort McHenry during the bombard
ment of the British fleet, Septem
ber 13, 1811. He died universally
esteemed and regretted on April 25,
ISIS, aged 39 years.
So great was James Lick's admiration
for this hero that he erected to hia
memory a fine equestrian statue in Eu
! taw Square, Baltimore.
After his death Virginia presented to
; his son, Christopher Hughes Armistead,
â  a sword, on which was inscribed these
words: "The. State of Virginia to Col
onel George Armistead. Honor the
I brave. Presented to the son of Col
| onel George Armistead (late of the
i army of the U. S. A.), as an evidence
I of the high esteem and admiration en
tertained by his native State for the
courage and soldier-like conduct of
Colonel Armistead at Niagara, and In
| the gallant defense of Fort McHenry
I September 14. 1814."
The flag that floated over the fort
during the engagement and now so
famous as "the Star Spangled Ban
ner," was the private property of Col
onel Armistead, having been presented
to him by several ladies in Baltimore.
After his death it was given to his
daughter, Georgiana Armistead, who
was born in the fort. She married a
Dr. Appleton from Boston, Mass., and
five years ago the banner was placed
in a safe deposit vault in New York
City by her son, the present owner, Mr,
Ebenezer Appleton.

WHAT IS NEW
ON
THE BOOKSHELVES
THE Rise of the Empire," by Walter
Besant, is the first of a series of
small books to be devoted to the
glorification of Britain as a whole.
Parts to follow are "The Story of
India." that of Australasia, of
South Africa, and of Canada.
Modern history made palatable, and ad
ministered in small doses, this book of
Besant's Is. There are probably 35,000
words in it. It is told in an unpretentious
Btyle, does full justice to the greatness of
England, and though not anxious to see
fault? In the British system, does not hÂ§B-
Itate to point them out and mildly to con
demn them.
ant's pen picture of the average
Englishman is a very good one. "He is..
to begin with, more readily attracted by
things practical than by things theoreti
cal; he prefers a feat of arms to any in
tellectual achievement; he would rather
hear of things done than of things at
tempted; he worships success in every
thing, because success means battle and
victory; he is combative and aggressive;
he likes lighting as much as his ancestors.
â¢ â¢ â¢ He is subject to restlessness, he
cannot be always sitting still; he will
throw up his situation and â  go roaming
about the world; he likes trade, espe
cially trade across the seas, because it de
mands enterprise and courageâ it ia a
great mistake t<' suppose that the love of
trade denotes a mean and money grub
pirit. He is profoundly religious,
but he will not endure the-domlnation of
priests: he is tender and chivalrous to
ward women. He demands' freedom of
!., freedom of thought, freedom of
faith. He insists on self-government as
. he enters Into combina-
I md associations with readiness, and
Is what is meaat by give and
take. He is not the most courteous per
son in the civilised world; he is well satis
fied with himself; * * * he is a strong,
I In arty animal."
What this strong, big and healthy ani
mal has done In th-.^ world Besant dwells
Upon with pride. His picture of the early
inhabitant of Britain and the circum
stances that led to his becoming the
strong, big and healthy animal Englisn
authors delight in is a good piece of work.
I I admits that England's dealings
with Ireland have not been entirely satis
"Have we absorbed the Irish
race? <;>>. ask the millions of Irishmen in
America what sort of extension of empire
is that where, after 600 years, the p
are so anxious t<> shake off the English
yoke as they were at the outset. â¢ â¦ â¢
It is not my business to explain, or to de
fend, or to accuse in the matter of Ire
land. I would only remind you that, after
all these years, though the whole of the
empire, with all its countless offices, dis
tinctions, honors, chances of wealth, be

they know how to climb, and do

America never cease abusing us, conspir

It is not upon such .extensions as this
that England should pride herself.
The book is an excellent mental birds
eye view of the great English empire, and

eration of the English-speaking states.

ODD FELLOWSHIP.
A new Rebekah lodge was instituted at
Covena on the 20th inst. by Past Grand
President Miss Fannie Benjamin with ten
charter members. Thirty-two were ad
mitted by initiation. The instituting offl
cer was assisted in the work by members
of Heliotrope Rebekah Lodge of Po
mona.
A new subordinate lodge will be insti
tuted within the next two weeks at
Loreta.
A remarkable fact is that during the
past three months there have been but
very few suspensions in the order in this
jurisdiction. The various reports received
show that there is much activity in the
membership.

On the evening of the 21st inst. the mem

ing, to their friends, who responded In
large numbers to the invitations extend
ed, for all know that when they attend
these gatherings they are assured of a
pleasant evening's entertainment. There
was presented a short programme that
included "Remember the Maine," an
original song, to the air of "Then You 11
Remember Me," by Mrs. Lillian A. Car

walk by four members of the parlor, who
each concealed her identity behind a
black mask. So excellent was the action
of each that the judges divided the cake
among ther-. ahare and share alike. This
was followed by the serving of icecream
and cakes, and then a dance. Previous
to the "at home" the parlor was enter
tained with remarks by Mis? Kervan and

Those who are bound by the ordinary
laws of literary civilization; those who
avail themselves of poetic license (and
pay for it in a higher degree of capacity);

And he stands first in it, unapproachable,
peerless. You may search through all
the flood of books that pour In a deluge

will you meet expressions like these.

the evening of the Ist of June in Native
Sons 1 Hall in aid of the Red Cross fund
of the Native Daughters will be a very
patriotic one. There will be an address
by Mrs. Genevievf Baker, one of the most
eloquent and patriotic speakers in the or
der; a Hag drill by twenty ladies of the
parlor, patriotic songs, recitations and pa
triotic tableaux. As the entertainment is
in behalf of a cause that appeals to all
who are imbued with the spirit of patriot
ism and humanity, it will no doubt be well
patronized.
THE NATIONAL UNION.
Golden Gate Council at Its meeting last
Tuesday night received two applications.
There was read a circular from W. M.
Bayne, president of the senate, calling
particular attention to the fact that there
is nothing in the laws of the order, the
constitution or contracts of th* National
Union which might In any manner in
validate the beneficiary certificates of the
members who might die in the military
service of the United States. The council
will have several candidates to initiate
at its next meeting. After the routine
business there were short talks ami the
singing of patriotic songs by the member
ship.
FORESTERS OF* AMERICA.
Court Golden West was the first of the
local courts to give substantial aid to the
Red Cross Society. At its meeting last
week it donated to that organization the
sum of $10, and the hope was expressed
that each court would do at least as well
in aid of the good cause. At the same
meeting the court presented to Captain
Rethers of the corps of surgeons or the
First California Volunteers, who for some
time was the court's physician, a set of
engrossed resolutions in pamphlet form,
expressive of the court's high opinion of
him.
On Saturday, the 21st inst., Court Inter
Nos gave a social In the Social Hall of
the Alcazar, and there was present a
large number of the members of the
court, their friends and members of Inter
Nos Circle of the Companions of the For
est. There was a good programme of
dances and during the evening there was
introduced the midget reciter, Baby Lil
ian Doiliver, who, under the direction of
Miss M. F. Dreyfuss, her teacher, re
cited a selection in line style and then
danced a fancy dance. After that J. W.
Sparrow, past chief ranger, was pre
sented a certificate and beautiful em
blematic badge, and L. H. Wiggins, also
a past chief, was presented a certificate.
AH present were treated to a tine colla
tion in the banquet hall.
On the evening of th<? ]Oth inst. Court
Golden West gave a banquet to Jacob
Samuels, the grand chief ranger. There
were a number of the members present.
and during the evening the members of
the court presented their guest with a
beautiful set of diamond studs. Those
who responded to the toasts of the even
ing were the guest of honor, J. J. Cordy,
Hugo K. Asher, J. C. Heenan, F. Conk

COURT SUTRO HEIGHTS.
The entertainment that was given last
Thursday night in Odd Fellows' Hall by
Court 6utro Heights of the Foresters of
America, the third by this court, was one
of the most pleasing of the kind that has
been offered by any of the fraternal or
ganizations of this city. All of the talent
was of the best, and the several numbers
were presented in a manner that elicited
well-deserved applause. Under the direc
tion of Leo Cooper there was presented a
farce entitled "A Pair of Lunatics," the
parts being taken by Reginald Travera
and Miss Vorg-ie Goodsell. Miss Cordle
Wetjen entertained with whistling solos
In birdlike notes that were most artistic
performances; Thomas Hickey gave a
recitation; .J- EL bunpson as n swell col
ored dude gave coon songs; Miss Moille
Brown gave a monologue, "The Window
Curtain," an admirable piece of acting;
Miss E. Ruth Cohen sang ballads; Miss
Pearl Noble gave a cornet solo, and for
nn encore played the bugle palls ana the
"Star-spangled Banner." "Henrietta," a
short comedy, In which Miss Etta Butler
and Louis Butler took part, closed the
programme. Miss Butler's rendition of
the part proved that she is a natural
born actress, and the audience did not
fail to recognize her merit. A grand ball
followed, and the choice programme was
greatly enjoyed by all. The committee
that got up the fine entertainment was:
I. Gross, L. N. Boukofsky, E. S. Harding,
E. N. Boukofsky and George K. Small.
COMPANIONS OF THE F. OF A.
The entertainment or picnic social given
by the convention of 198, Companions of
the Forest of America, in Alcazar Social

spent an enjoyable evening. There were

till he can feel the utter exhaustion, the
horrible sense of exertion that pervades
this epic of effort. The book leaves you
with a sort of impressionist skelcn, drawn
with bold, quick strokes, of the peril of

of the end and agree that when the wind
brought the sound of the great sea s voice

EVERY story written about the Jews
is bound to remind one of Zang
will. According to the degree in
which this re-semblance is marked
may be measured the ability of the
author. Not that it is necessary
to imitate the artist whose strength lies
In his treatment of Jewish history and
fiction to attain success; but that the field
has been so covered by the author of
"Dreamers of the Ghetto" as to almost
preclude the possibility of finding new
material.
"Heir Ezofovltch" Is not a new story.-
It is merely another phase of the Mes
siah movement Zangwill has shown us in
so many phases. An earthly Messiah la
Meir Ezofovltch. who dreams of leading
his people only to earthly peace and happi
ness and freedom of thought and of ac
tion. It's an old story, but- every orig
inal mind has power to renew the world s
interest In the old. This Polish author,
whose book Is translated by Iza Â» 0U J?Â»?'
has written a very interesting story. Ihe
characters are well drawn, and some
of them glow with life. The Rabbi Todros
might pose for intolerance and bigotry
and asceticism and unselfishness personi
fied of siuh contradictory yet thoroughly
human materials is he made. The great
family of the Ezofovitches is a fine pic
ture of the patriarchal old Israelite sur
rounded by all his descendants. There s
a pathetically artistic touch in the old
grandmotherâ despite the species of mi
racle in the last speech of the centena
rian when she reveals the hid
ing place of the writings of
Meir's great ancestorâ in the beautiful
reverence paid to her and in her silence
broken only to murmur lovingly to her
favorite great-grandchild, the intellectual
heir of her husband and also of her ances
tor, the original great iconoclast. Excel
lent dramatic Incidents there are In this"
book, and capital situations, which would
fit it for the stage. The lovf story of Meir
and Golda Is a truly tragic idyl.
It depends upon how you read "Wa
lewska." If it is to be Judged a.-; grown
up literature, you're apt to smile at its
path. is and sigh at the funny picture Na
poleon presents as the villain still pursu
ing the Polish heroine. But if you know
that the author is a girl of eighteen
whose youthful chivalry has been stirred
by ths accounts of the beautiful Polish
woman whom Napoleon loved and who
desires to re-estublisn the fair fame of
the Countess YVaiewska. it may make you
look upon the book as the author herself
is likely to, in time to comeâ should she
develop the capacity she shows and over
come her delight In descriptions of per
sonal beauty, among other thingsâ as a
crude but not unpromising beginning.

Washington Bartlett who was once
Mayor of San Francisco. The book is
dedicated to Henry Clay Barnabee of the

There's something sane and simple and

short stories, of which the first and long

of the- evening. J. W. Sparrow. H. Rup
ple, George Morrison and Jacob Label,
who were the Judges, were so undecided
as to the performance of two of the lady
walkers that it was a lons time before
they could reach a conclusion, and when
It was reached it was that each should
have < ne-nalf of the cake, which was do

the convention. In one half there was
concealed a line Â«old ring, the gift or
Mrs. J. Wisbinan, and that was secured
by Miss Lulu Laederich, one of the win

A number of gate prizes were distributed
and the affair reflected credit on the

KNIGHTS AND LADIES OF HONOR.
Aurora Lodge will tender a reception
to the grand offioen) on the evening of the
6th of June, to which ail members of the
order will be welcome.
Golden Rule Lodge has arranged for a
complimentary social to be given on the
evening of the 9th of June.
Last Tuesday Empire Lodge consol
idated with Pacific Lodge, and in the fu
ture the two will be known by the name
of the latter. This was done in the. pres
ence of a number of nvmbors of the or
<l â  r and of the grand officers. Grand Pro
tector Mrs. i.. J. Wbeelock commended
the consolidation as a move in tne light
direction, and she said there was no
doubi in her mind that the increaseu
membership of the Faeiiic would instill
new life into the lodge and arouse the
members t<, reneweS activity. Grand Sec
ret;* ry H. VV. Quitzow followed in a very
interesting address and expressed the
opinion that the consolidation, which il
lustrated that in union there is strength,
would result in the upbuilding of tne
lodge-, which is part of, as ho said, "one
of the best Âi' all fraternal orders." Mrs.
Francis Clodi, the retiring protector of
Empire Lodge, was, by the grand pro

the close of the meeting all present were

GARFIELD RELIEF CORPS.
There was a large attendance last Tues

May J. Sowders president of the corjra,
Mrs. M. Van Horn. Mrs. Dora Wwklns,
Mrs. Caroline Dibloe, Mrs. Cathrine Gil
bert, Mrs. Blargaret Jones and Mrs. Eh'?.
The hall was tastefully decorated with p.i
trlOtic emblems, and the tire of patrio;.:.-m
that was kindled thirty-seven years ago
burned with us much brightness as it d.d
then. The programme included a vocal
solo by Miss Minnie Powell; recitation,
Mitton Long; mandolin selections. Miss
Minnie Hoffman; "The American Flag,"
recited by Miss Ada Gilbert; vocal solo,
Miss Addie Ehle; recitation. Dr. Craw
ford; Kong, Miss Hazel MacKenzie; piano

a number of the veterans of the Civil War
and also a number of the young volun
teers for the present war. The old gave
the young a hearty handshake and wished
them success in the defense of the flag
and the country's honor. After the pro
gramme there was a dance in the social
hall, and tae party, as it broke up, sang
a patriotic song.
GOLDEN GATE HIVE, L. O. T. M.
There was a large gathering of the

WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
At the meeting of Golden Camp No. 64
last Monday night twenty applications
were presented and referred to commit
attractive title, too. There's nothing ,
startling In the stories Tourgee has to i
tell, but they're wholesome and. though
not exciting, are interesting and well told.
"The Man Who Outlived Himself" is the
man who disappears from the world after
an unsuccessful business operation. His ,
own account of his awakening to his
identity years later in an insane asylum
and of the gradual growing back to men
tal health makes a good story
* * *
The peculiar thing about Laurence Hut
ton'e "Four Dogs" is that it's charming
to both the man who leads "a dog-less
lif." and to him whose days are over
flowingly dog-ful. Your anti-dog preju
dices melt awayâ at least for the time
while you listen to this easy, merry talk
about Whiskie. "w.io was so honest, so
ingenious and so square, who had the
sense of shame and the sense of honor,
and who came back from his encounter
with the cat "with a muttered curse" and
the sense of having made himself ridic
ulous. About Punch, whose love for the
world was so all embracing that "he was
as cordial to a bepgar as he would have
been to a King; and if thieves had come
to break through and steal. Punch, in his
unfailing hospitable amiability, would
have escorted them through the house
and shown them where the treasures
were kept." About Mop, who had the
same long, lithe body as his predecessor,
"the same, short legs (the forelegs shaped
like a capital S), th<> same short tail, the
sumo hair dragging the ground, the same
beautiful head, the same wistful, expres
sive eye, the same cool, insinuating nose"
and who soothed the feelings of the dog
bereft boy by "the longed-for touch of a
vanished "paw, the lick of a tongue that
was still/ And then about Roy. who
looks like Thomas Carlyle and "Profes
sor John Weir declares that his body is
all out of drawing."
There isn't a cleverer word picture, a
better acquaintance and a purer philoso
phy shown in the biographies of four of
the world's greatest men than In the story
of these dogs. Isn't it well that there
aren't old letters, old friends, and old
frumps, to rise up and contradict their
biographer?
Hutton's own childhood's biography of
a boy, who was "not a very good boy, or
a very bad boy, or a very bright boy. or
an unusual boy in any wayâ but just a
boy," is one of those boy stories like Tom
Sawyer and Sentimental Tommyâ bound
to be read and loved and cherished by
boys of all ages and both sexes.

A
HOW TO MAKE WHIST MORE POPULAR.
When a whist club or association of whist
clubs make up their minds to hold a whist
tournament or contest, the first thing that
should be done is to study how to make the
meeting the most enjoyable and satisfactory
to those who take part in the play. Try to
please find do justice to every one; how can
this best be done? It is very simple. First,
you should have a detailed plan of whist play
arranged from start to finish for each and j
every contest you intend to hold. To avoid j
an endless amount of trouble and delay, it is
necessary for the one in charge to have at his
finger ends or in his vest pocket what we
call elastic schedules for both pair and teams
of four play, to accommodate any number of
entries under all methods or systems of match
play that you have on your programme; then
state to the players how it is to be con
ductedâthe number of deals you intend to play,
and how It is to be finished, if on a different
plun from the beginning; also how the scoring
is to be done, and who is going to do It â how
the winners are to be decided, and carry out
your plans to the end, never changing them
unless you are obliged to, and then only with
the consent of tl>.^ players. Have everything
SO simple and plain that every one taking part
in the games will thoroughly understand it.
The- umpire selected to lake charge of a
match should never undertake to conduct one
on any new system that he Is not entirely fa
miliar with and of r.U things he should never
phiy in a contest that he is conducting, nor
should be allow post-morteming of deals after
they are played at one table, and have to b*
moved for play to another. Absolute silence
should be preserved during play. No com
parison of seres with players at another table
should be allowed under penalty of immediate
expulsion from the match. The score slips
should be taken up as the game progresses,
after each round, and tabulated. There is no
system or method Of play that we know of that
will not permit of this being done.
The result of each sitting, match or frac
tion of a match, should be announced as quick
ly as pof&lble. It only requires a few min
utes alter the contest is over-half an hour
is plenty of time for the largest kind of a
match. The score is not properly kept if tt
cannot be proven; like a trial balance, it must
come out right, and this proving the score.
should always be done before announcing the
result.
The tabulated scores, as well as the score
slips for each deal, are the property of the
players who take part in the contests, and
should be treated as such; they belong to no
one else, that is. they should newr be put out
of sight for a moment: they should be aÂ»
free to he examine any time after a match
by all the participants, as the deals Just played
are. A bulletin board should always bf
provided, and this board is the proper
place for the official scores to be post
ed, and when once posted there, the scores
should remain until thÂ» tournament ends, bar
ring the time that might be used in *a.klng a
copy. It is an excellent idea to take carbon
copies when tabulating.
Every lady <<r gentleman who enters a whist
contest should have his or her rights fully pro
tected by tlit umpire or person In charge. By
doing this, and there is no reason why it should
not be done in every Instance, many of the
whist contests that we have seen, to.ken part
in and heard of. would have b.e.i mv.l. more
popular, sort of family reunions. Instead of
scrapping matches.
A. W. L. SYSTEM OF WHIST PLAY.
The American Whist League at its next an
nual meeting will, no doubt, agitate the ques
tion of formulating a system of play to be
known as the standard game or the league sys
tem. While that groat exponent of the noble
game, Mr. Milton C. Work, was here a few
;igo, we asked him this question:
'â¢Do you think the American Whist League
should recommend a system uf play to guide Its
VhlSi chi!i!n u'."' . . â .'
Answerâ Most emphatically, yeÂ». I believe
that such action on the part of the league
would simplify matters to a very great extent.
For example, there are to-day a large number
of recognized system?, all of which have some
advantages and some disadvantages. When

about it. or ("mm Inadvertence, the fullest and
most satisfactory explanation may not be
given If the league recognized a system to be

teams met for each to explain to the other in
what respects, if any. the system that it fol
lowed differed from the standard adopted by the

A LAUGHABLE WHIST SITUATION.
One evening when Washington Irving. Kver
ett and Bancroft were chatting over dlplomatio
reminiscences. Everett told Mow he and ths
Neapolitan ambassador had been presented to
hfr Majesty Queen Victoria. Lord Melbourne
'intimated that they would be expected to Jr>lo
in a game of whist with the Duchess of Kent.
"I play but a very poor game myself," said
Melbourne; "in fact. I scarcely understand it."
"And I," said the Neapolitan to Everett, "am
a very bad player, and should I happen to ba
your partner, I invoke your forbearance In ad
vance," to which the American envoy replied
that he knew very little of the game himself.
"Here." said Everett, in relating it. "were
i three dignified persons, clad in gorgeous attire,
solemnly going to play a gam.^ they Imperfectly
! understood, and for which none of them cared
a straw." Upon reaching the duchess' apart
ments the ambassador* were formally pre
sented, and then at her Invitation sat down to
play. As soon as the cards were dealt a lady
in-waiting placed herself at the back of the
duchess and the latter said: "Tour excellencies
will excuse me If I rely on the advice of my
friend here, for I must confess that I am really
a very poor player." This was too much for
Everett's gravity, and it was only with tha
greatest effort â¢ that he could refrain from,
laughing aloud at the ludicrous formality of the
; situation. â Detroit Free Press.

Whafa.the matter with Sacramento'fHE POSTER ARTIST AND hj'S FOUR CREATIONS
IN the land of Ought-to-beâ which
is an altogether different place
from the realm of Might-have-been
âthe first night of a theatrical per
formance will take place after the
play itself has run for a couple of
â weeks or more.
If "The Poster" could be put on at
the Tivoli all fresh to the public, all fa
miliar to the performers, a week from
to-morrow night, with the experience
the company and the authors have now
of its few deficiencies and its many
good qualities, what an interesting first
night it would be. Unfortunately, two
weeks more of rehearsals could not do
what two weeks of public performances
would. But in this "The Poster" is
only in line with the disappointments
of the rest of the world, and is handi
capped just as we all are by the ab
surd provision which makes experi
ence, sound judgment and wisdom â ar
tistic and otherwise â come at the
wrong end of one's life.
In the land of Ought-to-be the mu
sic of "The Poster" would not have
had all the sparkle and go taken out
of it by having been sung in a key two
notes lower than it was written. In
that same delightful place the boast
you hear at the Tivoli that "The Pos
ter" is over nowadays by 11 o'clock
could have been made the nrst night;
instead we were all afflicted with a
shuddering consciousness that after 11
last Monday the curtain was just
coming down on that effective finale of
the second act. In that same Utopian
country the exuberance of the com
pany would have been chastened. Its
members would not have been so Tivoli,
60 to speak.
San Francisco has yet to chronicle
a failure at the Tivoli. The author and
the composer whose first effort is pro
duced at this house has the absolute
certainty of that first, best gift to tal
entâa good hearing. The Tivoli's rep
utation is such that no matter how
novel, no matter how untried an ex
ent it make In the way of enter
tainment, it may count upon the confi
dence and the dollars of the public. All
of this it deserves, for there isn't a
theater in town that has done more to
and to keep a reputation. But
If the new author is to be congratulat
ed in reaping the benefit of this well
established reputation, he is also to be
ded with. A good hearing his play
shall have, a good setting, too. It shall
be presented by a company that aver-
Idering the scale of prices at
this house â very well. But his music
fhall be sung, his words shall be spo
ken, his play shall be acted â not as he,
their creator, wills, but as they, the in
terpreters, decree. And the decree of
the Tivoli company, with very few ex
ceptions, is that "The Poster," or what
ever it may be so fortunate and so un
fortunate to be, shall be presented in
precisely the same way that any other
comic opera or operatic comedy or mv-
Fical burlesque that has the good luck
and the perverse fate to fall into their
musical clutches would be. There is
but one way, is their creed, and that
way is the Tivoli way.
ThfÂ» result of this comic opera pater
nalism is that of all beneficent despot
isms, political or artistic. It works
very well with the ordinary subject. It
Is fun for the average, but death to the
exception. Any production at the Tiv
oli will have the benefit of the Tivoli
company's good nature â not a small
thing this â and its good will. For the
Usual run of comic operas this is suf
ficient to insure the Tivoli's usual well
to-do success. But when it comes to
the odd member of the musical family,
when something that is not exactly a
farce nor an old fashioned tune-y opera
nor an Eastern success nor an oper
atic revival is given to them â they
rheerfully pretend it is ona or the other
t>r all of these things, and with sweet
complacency and unwearied good in
tention act and sing it exactly as its
maker would not have it sung and
Â».cted.
Of course, this very natural fault Is
not peculiar to the Tivoli, but is com
mon to the stock companies of all sorts.
'The Poster" is not a marvel of wit mÂ»r
i dream of melody, but merely a novel
satirical composition, far too good in
(hese days of dearth of originality to
oe allowed to pass unregretted into
the limbo of plays which have been
produced and are not failures. Be
sides, it holds some one's opportunity.
tts novelty, its unusualness, have sig
aiflcance for the talented actor who has
individuality and energy enough to see
Â»nd to take advantage of it. The suc
;fss of the "First Born" and of the
players who produced it at the Alcazar
jny'in the fact of its newness, of its be
ng utterly unlike anything else these
Lcton and actresses had seen or played.
They lacked models. There was noth
ng to copy from. And so these peo
jle. who had done no remarkable work
s<^fore this, fell back upon their own
Drains, upon their own imaginations.
Instead of wooing success in some one
Â»lse's old garments, instead of trying to
leceive fortune by assuming a copy of
tome one else's old methods, they
lound the tide of success swelling at
iheir feet. Simply because they h*id
vorked the mine that lay within them,
lot the abandoned old claim of some
predecessor. Of course, this refers
nerely to the success of the
Mayers themselves. "The Poster"
jannot be compared to the "First
Born," even as things utterly
lissimilar may be measured according
o rank in each class. But it gave the
Tivoli people the opportunityâ a rare
me â of original effort, unhampered by
irecedents. And the Tivoli people gay
>â¢ disregarded the chance, and, all un
tonscious of wasted opportunity, gave
ts the Tivoli version of "The Paster."
â¢Jot a bad version; good of its kind â
he Tivoli kind, which is quite one's
noney's worth, but which presents such
antalizing possibilities that one can't
telp wishing it were better.
The thing is that success in a stock
nmpany, so well established, so justly
ir.pular as is the Tivoli's, is so easy
hat original thinking becomes un
necessary, antiquated, unheard and un
thought of. Witness Raffael, the ex
treme type, whose words were quite
inaudible and who played the Impres
sionist as he'd play a bandit or a shep
herd or a pierrot or a Romeo â with no
pretense of interest In or assumption of
the qualities of the character whose
role he takes. Rut if Edith Hall, who
has ability; if Stevens, whose bearing
in unmusical, self-respecting comedy is
that of the disinherited knight look
ing longingly back upon his ancestral
hi?me, would think it worth while, they
might be valuable and needed recruits
to the stage. Surely. San Francisco's
small dramatic militia, just now, is on
the most beggarly peace footings.
The Baldwin.
Ysaye, Gerardy and Lachaume will
give a special request concert at the
Baldwin Theater this evening. It will
be the farewell of these three great
musicians, who have completely cap
tured local music lovers by their play
ing at the concerts during the past
week. The programme for to-night's
concert will contain a number of pop
ular features and among them will be
the most brilliant work from the rep
ertoires of both Ysaye and Gerardy.
The latter has come here most highly
recommended and to say that he has
more than fulfilled expectations would
not be an exaggeration.
Jhe Golumbla.
Clay Clement, who is brave enough
to play Matthias in "The Bells" after
Irving's presentation of it in this coun
try, opens at the Columbia to-morrow
night in "The New Dominion." His
role, the Baron Hohenstauffen, Is an
excellent one, and Mr. Clement has re
ceived many notices upon his rendition
of it. The comedy is wholesome and
bracing and its conception of manhood
and womanhood is the highest. Ger
trude O'Malley is Clement's leading
lady.
Jhe. California.
There will be a matinee performance
to-day and one to-morrow at the Cali
fornia, where the Hopkins Trans-
Oceanic Star Specialty Company I>e
gins another week.
The performance of Frank Gardner's
riding baboon shows a vast amount of
training on the part of Mr. Gardner
and in the drinking scene the animil
appears almost human. Juno Salmo,
the contortionist, is seen in an act that
has not been equaled in this city for
difficulty. This man twists himself
up Into a knot ar.d with equal ease and
grace unties himself. Little Lulu gives
a dashing and graceful trapeze act,
closing with a performance on the
swinging rope. The Sidmans win fa
vor in their comedy sketch, as do aleo
Morton Revelle. Morton is decidedly
clever and rattles off his ragtime songs
in a catching manner. The banjo
team, Polk and Kollins, has made one
of the hits of the performance.
Morosco's Qrand Opzra House.
There will be a holiday matinee at
Morosco's to-morrow afternoon, when
a new star, George P. Webster, will
open in the marine spectacular drama,
"Bottom of the Sea." This play had its
first production in the Grand Opera
House, and was again played there by
the Webster and Brady company in
1893. The play is strong in situations
and mechanical and scenic effects.
There are two especially notable
scenes: The one shows the deck of
the French steamer Invincible, with
the machinery at work in laying a
submarine cable. A great storm oc
curs, and the cable parts. The next
scene shows the depths of the ocean.
A diver is engaged at the bottom of
the sea in a terrific combat with a
devil fish. Divers at work splicing the
cable, as well as the denizens of the
mighty deep are also shown. In the
first act there is a wreck in mid-ocean
and other exciting episodes, tend to ex
cite interest in the production. Web
ster is a clever actor, well known in
this city, where he last appeared in the
original Trilby company at the Colum
bia Theater. Max yon Mitzel, a new
member of the stock, will be In the
cast. He comes from the Girard ..ve
nue Theater of Philadelphia.
Jhe TiVoli.
"The Poster" is on for another week
at the Tivoli. It is full of novelties,
of funny bill posters, of well-known
advertising pictures that come to life,
of furniture that becomes animate, of
gorgeous and weird costuming, of
clever hits of all kinds. The topical
scng, "It's All In the Point of View,"
the quintet at the end of the first act,
and the duet, "Cupid, Cupid, You're So
Stupid," are among the hits of the
play. The. scene bÂ«tween the artist
and his four creatior c 'n which some
of his minor efforts curaJ to lif", car

All the Tivoli's clever people are woll
placed and the performance through
out is a most enjoyable one. An Amer
ican nautical opera, entitled "An Amer
ican Hero," founded upon the adven
tures of Paul Jones, will follow.
The
Lewis Morrison will present a play
new to San Franciscans to-morrow,
"The Master of Ceremonies," which is
a dramatization of George Manviile
Fenn's novel. The play is supposed
to occur in the time of George 111, and
pictures the troubles of a proud
Englishman, harassed by poverty and
accused of a crime, of which he is In
nocent. There's a thrilling court scene,
two pretty love romances and a strong
climax. Mr. Morrison plays the role of
the accused father, and Miss Roberts
is Claire, the daughter.
To-morrow afternoon, Decoration
day, a special matinee will be given.

idas â with his troupe of ten cats and.
twenty (Jogs, -which is recognized every
where as the greatest act c>f its kind
ever seen at a vaudeville house. Other
new features are Musical Johnstons,
who excel as soloists and duetists on
the xylophone, and who obtain some
surprising results from this much-used
instrument. The La Mont family have
been brought â  direct from Europe by
the Walter Orpheum Company. They
are an acrobatic trio capable of per
forming f^ats that are new and original
even to the Orpheum stage. It would
seem as though the limit of possibil
ities had about been- exhausted in the
acrobatic line, but the La Mimts prom
ise something entirely now. The hold
overs include Ezra Kendall, the humor
ist, who will select entirely new sub
jects for his funny talks this week;
Carroll Johnson, blackface comedian;
Al Leech and the Three Rosebuds; Han.
ry McAllister, the impersonator and
mimic; Colby and Way, the ventrilo
quist and dancing doll, and the Man
hattan Comedy Four, in an entire
change of repertoire. Special matinee
will be given on Monday (Decoration
day), with the regular matinees on
Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.

The Chutes.
At the Chutes Free Theater a great
variety of entertainment will be pro
vided for the coming week. William
de Boe, the "upside down man," is a
unique trapeze performer. He does all
of his work while standing on his head.
The animatoscope shows a number of
stirring war scenes, notably the de
parture of the Peking with the boys in
blue manning the yardarms, and the
First Regiment marching down Mar

this afternoon, and there will be a
number of special features on Decora

OUR CANNED GOODS.
The demand for Calif^rnian fruits continues
very strong, says the London Grocers" Gazette,
and with supplies in first hands almost clear
ed, business is almost entirely confined to re
sales at firmer and advancing prices. Re
ports of the growinK fruit crops in California
continue to be bad, and although these re
ports are, to a certain extent, discounted be
cause of their repetition year by year, the fact
remains that packers refuse to contract at
anything like last season's prices. This mar
ket for salmon keeps steady, with a fairly
good demand. The consumptive demand is
reported to be very goiid for so early in the
â eason. and In many quarters it is believed
that the growing dearness of foodstuffs gener
ally will tend to stiffen up prices of salmon.
As' yet we do not hfar of any contracts hav
ing been made for the 1898 pack of either
Alaska or Fraser River salmon. Good flats
are getting into small compass and are want
ed, while 't-Ib flats are practically cleared.
EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
tires at station indicate minimum temperature
tor the days; those underru-ath it, if any. the
amount of rainfall or of melted Enow in Inches
and liundrtdth* during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or rolid lines, connect points of e^'.ial
air presfurt; isothermÃ, or dotted lines, equal
tempera. The word "high", means lii^h
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair WLCth^r; "low" refers to m*v pres
sure and is usually preceded and ftcoomrianied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coa^t. When
the pressure Is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and -the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, wanner weather may ho expected
Jn nimmer and i older weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce â¢an
opposite result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NE-W -YORK, May 2S.â The fact that to-day
was a holiday in London and that Monday
would be a holiday both in New York and
London had the effect of curtailing speculative
oprratirns < r . stocks. There were two conflict- '
Ing reports In circulation, both coming by dif
ferent routes from the same point in the West
Indies. One alleged that the United States
fleet had been .sunk and that Admiral Samp
eon had been killed, and another that Com
modore Schley had penetrated the harbor of I
Santiago and sunk the Spanish fleet. The mar
ket sold off or. the first and recovered on the
second, but the dealings weft small. Rock {
Island and People's Gas were pushed up again, j
after a preliminary reaction, apparently t.i
shake off some weak following. Their price
was sustained with some difficulty at the close '
and was manipulated by the evident purpose I
of making the last prices the best. The same j
thing was manifest in other stocks. Great ;
Northern continued Its upward course and j
added nearly :" points to its recent remarkable '
advance. Illinois Steel rose 4 points addi
tional, but rear-ted 2 points.' There was a re
action after thf recovery coincident with the
publication of the bank statement, which was
on its face favorable. The market tor stocks
closed near top prices under manipulation late
in the session an.] generally a fraction above
la6t night's closing price.
Prices of stocks show substantial gains over
those of a week ago, though In the latter part
of the week there was a falling off in activity
fend a somewhat settled tendency. The advance
early In the week was largely based on the
unfounded report that the Spanish fleet in
Went Indian waters had already been annihi
lated. The later resistance to decline has been |
fnoournglnjc to the bull' element and the be
lief Is general In Wall street that the power
*Â«<inÂ»MÂ»i of Cervera'n fleet to do mischief hoe
keen demonstrated and its ultimate defeat by
the United States forces Is confidently ex- ;
j pected. The money markeÂ£ may now fairly be :
j described as plethoric. Although the volume ,
i of bank clearings all over the country indi
cates a' larger use of money than even in 1592,
i funds continue to flow to New York from other
i domestic centers. The United States Treasury
continues to feed out money in the market.
I New York, banks gained over $3,000,000 from
that source ti'is week. '
The country? net gold imports for the fiscal
year will exceed $100,000,000, which has nevÂ»r , i
; Ix-en approached, except in 1881. when it was j
over f97.T00.000. There has ber-n at the same!
! t mÂ« a largely Increased output of gold by the j
I honie mines', liie product for the present year I
[being estimated at $60,000,000. The idea that
the Qovernmmi requirements for carrying on
| the war would! result in any stringency in
money rates has been entirely discarded by
â  financial authorities.

view of the holiday on- Monday, and the
nervous condition for trade seemed to be dis
posed to, even up. The demand from that in
terest was respotuHble for the early strength,
I but when buyers were satisfied and withdrew
trade became sluggish. Â£ The bear news multi
plying and. the .bull interest getting no support,
i tli.; celling rush became afttnvsiiive ana vig-
I orous and was rushed with' such energy' that
; everything was swept before it. Liquidation
! soon became as urgent as the .short selling
I the market - getting demoralized. ; The I impres
sion became general that Leiter had lost con
trol and was no longer, able to resist the nat
ural course of prices. There "was no Liver
pool cables, bat the crop news continued -to
gr.ow more bearish. St. Louis reported new
wheat already in that market. , There was con
siderable reaction during the last half hour *
as the shorts showed - a strong disposition to
even up. July closed ; 2%Â©3% c lower and Set>

ASSOCIATED BAJS'K STATEMENT.
NF.W YORK, May 23.â The Financier says:
The statement of the accumulation of the Asso
ciated Banks of N"w York for the week ending
May 2S, reflects a continued actton of Idle funds
at this center, although the expansion of 15,202,
4WI In the loan account is a certain Indication
that business Is Improving.
The banks gained $6,744,000 in ca*h which,
added to the loan Increase, accounted for the
unusually heavy growth of $15,018,600 In de
posits within the last seven' days.
The Interior banks are Increasing their bal
ances here, three millions of imported gold
came Into New York last week and the
disbursements, due to war expenses, show no
signs of diminution. Against this the only
losses have heen in the shape of remittances
to Southern banks, and these, are not nearly as
large as receipts. The movement from the in
terior Is only normal at this season. Perhaps
some of the loan expansion represents pur
< ha^e? of sterling exchange- not included In the
previous statement; but now that money rates
abroad have fallen. â¢ this form of Investment
will not be as conspicuous &s In the early part
of the j-ear. The month - ' May has been
marked by some noteworthy changes In the
bank totals. Loans have Increased over $19,
000,006; deposits. $?.7.000.nri0; cash, $18,557,000, and
surplus reserves, $9,200,000.

| COFFEEâ C. E. Hiokford's circular says:
The market is stagnant, and the business
; accomplished from first hands is hardly worth

ing, liberally sui .plied with all grades other
than 'inferior' to 'common.' Arrivals of these
have been unusually liÃht so far, and they are
â  In demand and scarce at r.wTr.

JOSEFA AND HER DOLLY.
JOSEFA JIMENEZ was fright years
old, when her father, a Cuban pat
riot, was taken away from his
humble home by Spanish BOldlers.
Three, four, fiv^ days passed and
h^ did not return. Little Josefa saw
the pitying eyes and noticed the soften
ed manners the neighbors, who at
â â¢ted her as their own.
"Wl :>a?" she asked one day
of Benorita Morali s.
"How should T know':" answered the
rlta, turning: her face away.
"I know." said the child after a pause,
"he is dead, and has to heaven.
He often told me that mamma was
there waiting for him."
-But you, Josefa?" asked the Senor
ita
"I will b- a good piii. and a brave girl,
and a Cuban patriot, 'and, by and by, I
will '- ' * them."
Benorita Morales did not contradict
t she weep. The dread
of a worse to-morrow always overshad
owed the sorrow of th<> day among the
Cubans. Fur it was known that General
. r was about to burn the homes of
Cubans, and to drive them, men,
>n and children, into the "reeon
c.^ntrado" camps, t.. die of starvation.
\ few days later the Spanish troopers
I rimy, with cruel swords,
cruel hearts, cruel spurs. The villagers
were speedily huddled torvther, and a
dreary march toward the reconcentrado
camp began. Their homes were burn
ed- their crops destroyed, even their
church.? v I by the torch. Be
fore them was only suffering; behind,
as they turned to look back, only ruin.
But their eyes rested lovingly upon the

\nd at the very head of the line of
captives walked little Josefa Jiminez.
Tn hr-r arms she carried a little doll,
which her mother had given her.
'when " ;is she naively said it. "T was
a little, girl, only six years old." It was
two years since her mother went to
heaven.
Josefa's head was bare. I'pon it was
a wealth of shining black curls, which
crept down and seemed to caress her
plump little olive checks. Around her
neck was her mother's gold chain, from
which hung the symbol of the cruci
fixion. Her little brown feet were bare,
but she trod the dusty and flinty road
without complaint; and her chief sor
row was over a sickly little girl who
walked beside her. and who was suf
fering from the heat of the burning
sun. When her '.ittle comrade in dis
tress faltered Josefa, to cheer her up,
let her carry her dolly, dressed in its
best white dress and having bright rib
bons of blue arounl its neck and
wrists.
When Josefa reached the reconcen
trado camp and viewed the starving
men and women and little children
there, and noticed the birds <>f prey
greedily hovering overhead, her heart
overflowed with pity; but when she

rectly toward the officer and told him
that he was a bad, wicked man.
Several women tried to stop her flow
of words, but she would not stop.
"You will never be haimy if you are
not good," she said. "My mamma told
me that; and she is an .angel now."
"Ah," said the cruel officer, brutally,
"I suppose that your mother was a
Cuban and a rebel: 1
"She was so good that she would
have prayed for even you; and so
will I."
The officer rode away and left her
kneeling on the ground. The sunlight
caused tears that sprung from her
eyes to glitter likÂ«Â» stars of the purest
radiance. She knelt until she had fin
ished her prayer that the "dear Lord
would make the cruel soldier good."
Then she arose and kissed the dolly,
which she held tightly in her arms.
"I hope, dolly dear," the sweet little
maiden said, "that he will be good, and
so be happy."
A Spanish colonel passed near and
saw little Josefa and heard her loving
words.
"Bring the child to my tent," he or
dered. Somewhere in far off Spain the
colonel had left a little daughter who

to your Chiquita,"
Yes, he even fancied that he smelled
the odors of the flowers that bloomed
in his garden in Spain where Chiquita
played hide and go seek with the but
terflies among the hollyhocks, and
where her beautiful young mother sang
gay songs or danced to the merry sound
of the guitar and the castinets.
"How old are you, little girl?"
The colonel's voice was gentle and
Josefa looked up timidly.
"I am eight years old last May," she
said.
"Where are your parents?"
Josefa told about her mamma and
then became a questioner.
"Have you seen my papa?"
"Who was he?"
"Rubio Jimenez."
"The Cuban rebel?"
"No, the Cuban patriot."
"He was â " The officer paused, for
something stuck in his throat. Before
his eyes came once more the vision of
his own little daughter, and he was
thankful that she was far over the sea.
"He was killed?" asked Josefa.
"Yes," answered the colonel; "exe
cuted."
"I am glad that you knew him, for

he was a good man, and I know that
you were kind to him. Here, take my
dolly. She is my best friend now. Take
her for being' good to my papa."
The colonel's eyes were fixed. He
saw before him a dusty plain and a
fortress, as he had seen them only a
few nays before. Then there had stood
upright, fearless and proud, a Cuban
whose features were like Josefa's.
"Cuba libre; Cuba libre forever," this
Cuban had said Just before, a cruel line
of fire leaped from the muzzles of guns.
This was Josefa's father, and he was
shot by the order of this colonel as s.
rebel.
"So," thought the colonel, "I have
made this little girl, so like my own
child, an orphan. Strange and hard
are the chances of war. But I will save
the child." He handed her dolly, which
she had placed in his hands, back to
her.
"What, not want my beautiful
dolly?" asked Josefa in astonishment.
"You would be lonely without her,
Josefa, and I cannot take her away."
Day after day the number of Cubans
in the reconcentrado camp Increased.
Day after day cruelties were enacted
that chilled and frightened little Josefa.
The colonel gave her food from his own
table, although he had none too much.
She freely divided with the <'Ã¼bans and
they looked upon her us an angel of
mercy. They colonel told her of Chi
quita and promised to take Josefa
home to Spain to play with her "when
the war is over."
Early one morning Josefa was
awakened by hearing rifle shots. That
was no new sound to her for she was
used to the noises of war. But now she
started up and ran from the colonel's
tent with her dolly in her arms. Some
blind fate led her directly to where
there stood a grim line of Spanish
soldiers. Before them, at a distance of
some yards, were Cuban young men,
two were lads, one an acquaintance of
Josefa. Forward darted the little girl,
understanding the meaning of the scene
at once.
"Einanuel, EuKÂ»irael!" she cried, "I
will save you."
But the sword of a Spanish officer
u-on horseback had fallen. At the sig
nal the rifles hart volleyed once more.
Prone u^on the ground was th form
of a little girl. Forgetting dignity, mil
itary rar.k, discipline, the officer was
beside the child in an instant.
â¢â¢Jurefa, Jos-- 'a," he said, brokenly.
"Dear friend," she said, "second dear
papa, I am glad you have come. Here
is my dolly. I shall not ..ant it a?y
more. Be good to it and gi eit to your
dear Ohiquita and toll her to keep it
always and always for me. Good-by.
Here is a kiss for Chiquita."
More than c- er the child looked like
his own Chiquita. The colonel took the
dolly vrp with a strange sensation.
There was a red streak upon the white
and blue of the dress. D. H. W.
THE YOUNG
STORY-TELLERS
f*^ HTLPREX In the San Bernardino
' public schools, so writes Mrs.
U Margaret M. Mogeau, superin
tendent for San Bernardino Coun
ty "to whom I have read the best
stories on the boys' page and the girls'
page, without telling whether they
were written by boys or girls, have
expressed a preference, in seven out of
ten schools, for the boys' stories. That
has been the voice of the majority.
Where honors were given to girls the
masculine element was not so much in
evidence. This experiment proves to
me that literary merit is often lost
sight of where the subject is a live
one, such as war, Indians, wrecked
trains, daring balloon ascensions, etc.
"The girls touch most tenderly a
sympathetic chord in the human heart
when they write about 'dear little
baby boys,' 'beautiful fairies,' 'the
aerial form,' love and marriage. In
choice of subject, logical treatment,
variety of phraseology, taste, style and
correctness as to technicalities, the
girls have, in my opinion, beaten their
brothers. Paradoxical as it may seem,
I think the boys' stories are more in
teresting, but a greater amount of abil
ity is shown on the girls' page.
Thomas J. Kirk, Superintendent for
Fresno County, writes: "I have read
the boys' and girls' pages carefully,
though somewhat hurriedly. The girls'
page seems to me better than the boys',
both in invention and in delicacy of ex
pression. I am reminded of Dr. Hol
land's statement, that "the false is
fairer than the true," and in these
Btories the rational idealism of the
girls surpasses the rough realism of
the boys.
"And yet I am skeptical and hesitate
to- draw a conclusion regarding the
literary superiority of either sex, even
on the assumption that conditions, en
vironment and heredity in these young
writers are the Bame or equivalent. It
is no easy matter to determine the rel
ative eminence as literators of Harriet
Beecher Stowe and her brother. Henry
Ward Beecher. Had the compositor
omitted the names and pied the stt.-ries
of the young authors, how many critics
of differentiation of style could distin
guish whether the writers were girls or
boys?
"Why not have a sort of masquerade
ball for the little novelists and let the
literati guess boy or guess girl?"
A visitor who was trotting 4-year-old
Freddie upon his knee remarked to the
little fellow's mother: "Do you know,
there is something: in this young man
I like?" "Say," exclaimed the preco
cious youngster, "who told you that I
swallowed a penny?"
A NIGHT WITH A GRIZZLY.
IT was a winter afternoon up in the
Sierras," paid Uncle Ben,"when I left
my log cabin in search of fresh meat.
I had been snowed in for a fortnight,
but the snow had melted enough for
me to open the door. With my gun in
my grasp, I felt ready for any sort
of game. Judge of my astonishment
when, not 100 yards from the door, I
saw a large grizzly bear sitting upon
his haunches.
"When I started I did not expect to
find a bear, and with my life seem
ingly at stake I realized that I never
before had felt what a poor shc-t I
might be. But, being in for it, I took
careful aim at Mr. Grizzly and pulled
the trigger. The gun did not go off.
Neither did the bear stir. He seemed
to be willing to give me another shot.
I threw open the lock of the gun.
There was no cartridge in the gun!
Here I was, face to face with a fierce
grizzly, and without any effective
weapon.
Mr. Bear now lost his patience; or
perhaps he smelled the food in my
cabin. At any rate, he started in my
direction, and a lively race for the
cabin door took place. We went
through the door neck and neck. I
threw myself upon the bed, under the
pillow of which were my cartridges.
Mr. Boar did not know what to make
of this, but as he growled every time
that I moved I had to give up reaching
for the cartridges? The bear was not
hungry. After he had watched me
curiously for awhile he lay down upon
a rug in front of the bed and went
to sleep.
"Then I once more thought to get
the cartridges, to take a shot at the
brute at short range. But he knew too
much for me. His eyes opened and he
growled whenever I moved. There was
nothing left for it but to remain quiet.
After a while darkness came and with
it a driving snowstorm. The door of
the cabin was open. The wind whirled
the snow in through the door. Mr.
Bear crawled cut of the wind, up in
one corner of the cabin, and possibly
went to sleep again. But I was afraid
to move, for the breathing of my un
welcome neighbor was light. He .was
not sleeping very soundly at the best.
"I have never passed through a night
like that. The chili of the air and the
nervous state I was in, owing to the
knowledge that, soc-ner or later, the
bear would eat me unless some one
should come to the rescue, made my
teeth chatter. The bear did not know
What to think of the noise. He walked
to the bed softly, but I could hear him
coming. His cold nose touched my
face, and then he licked my hands. I
PRUE AND THE WINTER BIRD.
BY EDITH LAWSON, SAN FRANCISCO.
Prue couldn't go out because it was
snowing. She sat in a rocking chair close
to the window, her nose pressing against
the window-pane.
But pretty soon she saw a pretty white
bird fly up to the window, and it said:
"Good "afternoon, Prue.".- Prue started up,
because she had never heard a bird talk
before. Then she said: "Good afternoon,
white bird. Are you not cold this snowy
afternoon?"
"Oh, no." said the bird. "This is the
happiest time in my life, for I am a win
ter bird."
"Is that so? But pray, where did you
come from?" said Prue.
"Fmrn my Majesty, the Fairy Queen,"
replied the bird.
"How very queer! But why did you
come?" â¢ ,
"I came, for the Queen is going to take
a trip to Summer Land, and told me to
come here into your People World to see
if any little girl would like to take her
place while she is away. And I thought
you might like to; would you?"
"Oh, yes." said Prue, "I would truly
very much."
"All right, then. Come along; Just take
a seat on my back."
"But am I not just a little too heavy?"
"Of course not," said the bird. "I am
twice as strong as you, although I am
small."
"How is that?" said Prue.
"Why, don't you see? Fairies and
fairy birds are always twice as strong as
people up here in People World."
"All right," said Prue, "I will if I can
get through this glass."
"That's easy enough," said the bird,
and he lifted his white wing, and the first
thing Prue knew the window had melted
away and she was sitting safely on the
bird's back.

and ' therefore played possum to the
best of my ability, and to my success
in that direction I probably owe my
life.
"The night was not so dark but that
I could see the open doorway. Once
Mr. .Bear's .huge bulk /as outlined
against that space and he cec.neO. to be
about to go out for fresh air. But the
wind blew in a perfect cloud of snow
and he turned back and crouched in a
dark corner and I could not see him.
All the time he could watch and un
doubtedly did watch me. Every hour
seemed an age long and I felt that day
would never come.
"It was nearing 3 o'clock when I
heard a noise outside of the cabin;
voices and the trampling of a horse.
Some foolish persons had lost their way
in the mountains and had kept in mo
tion during the night, fearing that if
they should lie down they would
freeze. Mr. Bear heard the noise and
went out. I jumped up and seized my
cartridge belt, and, with fingers
numbed and trembling with the cold,
loaded my gun and ran to the cabin
door.
"There sat the bear, near the door,
upon his hind legs, waiting for the
strangers to come up the grade.
" 'Stand back.' I shouted, as I took
aim. 'Stand back, strangers, for I am
about to shoot a bear.'
"The strangers, lost and half-frozen
as they were, laughed at this strange
remark coming out of the darkness,
and evidently wondered what it could
mean. But they heard the rifle go off,
and, as good luck would have it. the
bear was so badly hurt that his only
thought was to get away. He dragged
himself down the trail as the strangers
fame up, nearly crowding them over a
precipice and astonishing them greatly.
"The strangers were old acquain
tances, Tom Nelson of San Francisco
and Edward Martin of Santa Barbara.
I made the cabin comfortable for them
and we all slept until daylight, with a
securely barred door between us and
the bear. . We found Mr. Bear in an
ugly. mood and ready to show fight, and
it took four shots to finish him. By the
time we had him skinned and indoors
the heaviest snowstorm I have ever
seen, in the Sierras set in.
"We were close prisoners for a full
fortnight. During that period we did
very well finA were jolly, having
enough to eat smd drink, and the wood
pile in one corner of the cabin proved
to be sufficient to carry us through the
storm. My newly found friends had
passed through many adventures, of
which I must tell you later."
As they flew along Frue saw lovely
things. The bird said they were taking
the fairy snow path which led to the
Queen's palare. Indeed. Prue thought it
w;is. for flowers were all made of snow,
and houses, trees and grass the same.
Then she wanted to know where they
were going, and the bird said "To Snowy
Fairy Land."
"It must be very grand," said Prue. "Is
everything made of snow? Excuse me for
asking so many questions, but it is very
puzzling."
"I will excuse you," said the bird, "but
things are not puzzling when you get
used to them. I can't explain now,
though, for here we are."
Prue looked up and saw little ice houses
where fairies as small as your finger were
sitting down on very small chairs to their
tea. And in the middle of the tiny ice
houses was one larger than the rest,
which was the Fairy Queen's palace.
The bird, flew to the ground and told
Prue to walk into the palace.
But Prue said: "I am too large; I
can't get in."
The bird said, as he brought from under
his wing a small snow candy, "Eat this
and you will be small enough."
And sure enough after Prue had eaten
the candy she was as small as the bird
himself.
So the bird lea Prue into the castle,
where Prue saw a tiny ice throne glitter
ing with diamonds.
Then the little Queen said, "Oh, this is
a beautiful person. She shall be Queen
always."
Prue got very excited, butÂ»just then she
heard a well-known voice saying "Prue,
wake up and come to dinner."
She opened her eyes and ran down to
dinner. And so it was all a dream.

Two Bteamera intended for the Klondike
trade had their trial trips on the bay
yesterday. The Alaska Commercial Com
pany's new steamer St. Paul had her
engineer's trkU, while the AJaska- Yukon
Transportation Company's river steamer
James Eva went out on her official test.
The St. Paul was in command of Cap
tain George Harvey of the Ship Owners'
and Merchants' Towboat Company. He
is one of the most capable masters on the
bay, and took out the St. Paul by the
special invitation of the Commercial Com
pany. The machinery worked to perfec
tion, and when the vessel was going at
full speed she averaged fourteen knots
an hour. When everything is down to its
bearings it is expected that th-e new
steamer will do better even than on her
trial.
The James Eva took out a large party
on her trial trip. They were all friends
of the directors of the company, and had
a most enjoyable outing on the bay. The
Bteamer is intended for the Yukon River
trade, and will leave this week for St.
Michael in tow of the company's steamer
National City. The James Eva is lux
uriously fitted out and has all the accom
modations necessary for the comfort of
the passengers who wilLMravel by her.
The Harbor police hacr^o be called upon
yesterday to preserve order at the sailing
of the steamer Bertha. She was taking
away 163 waiters, cooks, stewards and
deckhands to man the Alaska Cummer
cial Company's new steamers at St. Ali
chael. Every one of this crowd was more
or less under the influence of liquor, and
as the hour of sailing approached there
were several tree tights. Sergeant Tom
Mahoney and a squad from the Harbor
police station went down to the wharf
and soon had the men under control. Had
they delayed putting in an appearance for
ten minutes longer there would have been
a small-sized riot in progress when they
reached Mission-street wharf.

temptuously, as she wiped her flashing
eyes. "I^et them wait; I'll have him
out of prison and earn my bread, too."
But for once she was balked. No
sooner had she spent her little all on
the necessary expenditure for a small
store than she received a free pass on
the next mail boat bound for Sydney,
with orders to quit New Caledonia on
pain of Imprisonment. Alone she would
undoubtedly have faced the horrors of
a New Caledonia prison, but her chil
dren were unprotected. With one
clinging to each hand she found her
self, on a drizzling morning, in the
streets of Sydney, a stranger, not
speaking a word of the language, and
with a few dollars in her pocket. Nay,
worse than a stranger, for she had an
evil reputation to live down; the Nou
mean government, ashamed to own
that it feared a woman, had sent word
that she was expelled from New Cale
donia on the score of immorality. Hap
pily there are lies that defeat their
purpose; people would have been ready
enough to regard Mme. Rastoul as a
dangerous political agitator; no honest
person, looking at her grand counte
nance, could believe in her Immoral
tendencies. The beginning was cruelly
hard; she and her children more than
once stared starvation in the face: but
little by little it became known that a
French teacher of exceptional ch-arm
and individuality had come to Sydney,
and before many years Mme. Rastoul
stood at the head of her chosen profes
sion; to be her favored pupil was to
claim ltnguiatla distinction. Her bare.
rooms were exchanged for a luxurious
home, society sought one who was so
obviously "to the manner born," and
society, not taken into her confidence,
marveled sometimes why the beautiful
eyes held dark shadows and the sweet
face seemed lined with care. â 
Her daughter could have told them.
The daughter who used to wake up
night after night and, seeing a white
robed figure pacing restlessly up and
down, cry Imploringly, "Mamma, mam
ma, are you never going to sleep?" A
few months after her arrival in Sydney
ilme. Rastoul heard that the doctor,
with eighteen others, had escaped from
Noumea in a small boat. For five year*
her wistful eyes watched, night and
day, for the arrival of that doomed
crew. Then one day she heard an au
thentic tale of shipwreck; her step lost
some of Its elasticity, her beautiful hair
silvered and her poor neighbors saw
more of her than ever.
For there was one side of Juliette
Rastoul's life which society took no
note of. In drawing-rooms she was
only known as a brilliant social orna
ment. But the woman in garret or cel
lar, whose pain of travail had come
upon her, the woman bending over her
sick child's couch, the woman stand
ing by her husband's corpse with no
burial fee in hand, these knew that
"madame's" bell might be rung at any
hour of the night and that she would
answer as a ministering angel.
At length, mysteriously, into ma
dame's sorrowing life stole the glow of
an Indian summer; genius knelt at her
feet, offering loving homage and the
tender heart was snared unawares. "I
thought all my heart was buried in the
sea," she would say, smiling wistfully.
"I never suspected there was any left
to give away, but there was, and he
took it."
For years she had no cause to regret;
she was the joy and pride of an ex
ceptionally artistic home, the center of
an intellectual Bohemian circle.
Then, suddenly, the evil days fell
upon her. I need not dwell on a tale
of treachery and hishonor now buried
in the grave. Enough that "Madame"
onoe more found herself oast upon the
world, bearing for the first time a be
smirched name, and obliged to battle
for herself and the young grandchild
she had adopted. This new experience
well-nigh killed her, nay there are some
who know full well that it proved her
deathblow, but she carried her mortal
wound bravely. "I die standing," she
paid once more, "and before I die dis
honor must be removed from that
name; my life must honor it."
She kept her word. First in the
pretty little town of Hobart, Tasmania,
then in her well loved Sydney, she built
up for herself a reputation that will
not soon be effaced. Opposition, ca
lumny, misrepresentation were active
ly at work; to her wounded spirit the
task was harder than of yore, yet she
gallantly fought on. Many a time her
courage well-nigh failed, but the daunt
less cry was always wrung from her:
"I will not give in. I die standing,
or I fall with honor."
She died standing. Last January
intellectual Sydney was startled by the
news that its brilliant lecturess and au
thority on French literature, the found
ress of its only French Cercle Litteraire
and School of Dramatic Elocution, had
died after a few days' illness. Flowers
were massed over her still form,
wealth and fashion flocked to the fu
neral, her country's official representa
tive stood at her grave, the newspapers
view with one another in laudatory arti
cles, and adoring pupils erected a mon
ument. Only the few guess that the
heart under that monument was long
since crushed and broken; that it was
not life's blood, but honor, that kept it
pulsating so long.

RECORDS THAT SHOW
Spain Is Used
TO "MANILA DEFEATS."
OF late Spanish statesmen, ad- j
mirals and generals have been
doing a great deal of boasting in
regard to the past glories won by |
their seamen. The impression i
gained from reading their state
ments is that Spain's career at sea has
been one grand series of successes. In- j
stead, the fact is, it has been one grand
series of disasters. And particularly i
so, when her fleets met the men-of-war
of the Anglo-Saxon.
In Spain's early history there is lit- j
tie of a maritime nature. Most of her ''
fighting was done on land and with
well equipped armies she won enough
money to enable her to employ the best
soldierly talent of the day. By a stroke J
of luck Spain found herself the ruling
power over vast areas of land and with
money enough on hand to employ men
to explore the furthest ends of the j
earth for her. At one time Spain was
really the first naval power.
But even when circumstances made
her the first of naval powers Spain was
never equal to the task she undertook,
says the London Speaker. A great j
Italian sailor secured for her the em- I
pire of the "West. The fighting prowess j
of two great military captains won for I
her Mexico and Peru. Her splendid I
armies conquered Portugal and brought \
her the widest colonial dominion of the
age. ;
But it was not by sea that Spain
won her supremacy, and not by naval
victories that she laid her grip on every
quarter of the globe. Even when her
power and wealth seemed irresistible,
when her military reputation was at its
height, wfien the world was strewn j
with her territories and the ocean laden |
with her argosies and fleets, her real
naval power was utterly incommensur
ate with the astonishing pretensions ]
which it made!
As soon as England and Holland laid !
a iinger on it, her maritime empire
crumbled into dust. The Armada only
revealed a fact which English sailors
had long suspected, and the conscious
ness of which explains Drake's sublime
contempt for the menaces of Spainâ |
the fact that, even at the zenith of their j
fame, the Spaniards had no mastery of j
the arts by which the sea is held.
Is there on record a battle which j
shows that Drake and Blake and Jervis
and Nelson were mistaken in their low
estimate of Spanish seamen? Can any
of us recall the name. of a Spanish ad- j
miral of genius, or of any great Span- i
ish naval victory since Lepanto, which
was won largely by Venetian crews?
If we look at the history of Spain
since the Armada, we find only a kuc- 'â 
cession of naval disasters, a succession
of triumphs for any state which has j
ventured to grapple with the Spaniards i
on the seas.
Take the history of the seventeenth
century and follow the career of the
Dutch admirals and of the greatest of !
Nelson's predecessors, P.lakf>. Take |
the eighteenth century and notice how !
even Alberoni and Patino failed, with
all their efforts, to resuscitate the fleets
of Spain.
Take the modern war in Chile, and '
mark how few antagonists Cochrane
could find there worthy of his steel.
Even in the days of her greatest power
at sea, Spain was notoriously deficient
in the capacity of her sailors, and since
those days she has steadily declined.
To-day Spanish gunners and Spanish j
engineers are confessedly among the
worst in Europe. It would be little
short of a miracle If it should turn out
that Spain, within the last two de
cades, bad bred, a race of seamen ca

A â word of â Come before the line is i
pickeQ over. . - '
pable of reversing: the unvarying mis
fortunes of the past.
For proof of the foregoing It Is only
necessary to turn back a few pages of
history to show just how incapable the
Spanish seamen are. Not only are
they weak in science and discipline, but
they have not shown the bravery of the
Anglo-Saxon sailors. A study of the
records of the British navy, of even re
cent years, will show that for bravery
and valor the Spaniards can give no
points to the Anglo-Saxon. Spain can
show not a single engagement in which
her men displayed the bravery the
English have on many occasions.
Every student of British history
knows of the defeat of the Spanish Ar
mada, But that is too long ago. To
come to a more recent date, 1770, is far
enough back to show what is intended.
At this time the Dons had built up
quite a formidable navy and became
very insolent again. Piracy was en
couraged to such an extent that Eng
land had to interfere to teach a les
son.
For a number of years there was con
tinual fighting and engagements were
very frequent. The most important of
these engagements are as follows:
March 17, 1794â The British brig Ze
bra, of sixteen guns, stormed and cap
tured Fort Royal, Martinique. This
was a hot fight of many hours and th^
Spanish numbered their adversaries al
most 4 to 1.
March It, 1796â British frigÃte Dia
mond and the Liberty, an eighteen-gwn
brig, destroyed the batteries of Port
Sporgui and nine warships. The Dia
mond was in command of Sir Sydney
Smith and the Liberty In command of
George McKinley, an ancestor of our
illustrious President. â¢
February 12, 1797â Admiral Sir John
Jervis in the old Victory, famed after
ward as Lord Nelson's flagship, had an
action with the Spanish fleet and de
stroyed nearly all of them and cap
tured four ships of the line.
May 5, 1798â Two brigs, the Badger of
10 guns and the Sandfly of 8 guns, had
an engagement with four Spanish frig
ates. It was a fierce battle, but one
that did not last long, owing to the ac
curacy of the British gunners. Three
of the Spanish vessels were sunk and
the fourth, the Santa Dorotea. was
captured, and afterward did good serv
ice fighting for England.
November 6, 1799â The Speedy, a
small brigantine carrying eight 4
poundors. engaged twelve Spanish gun
boats and successfully defended a con
voy of merchantmen at the same time.
May 6, 1801â Lord Cochrane, In the
Speedy, ranged up alongside of the
Spanish frigate Gamo, and after a hard
fight. In which the Gamo was nearly
wrecked, captured her. The crew of
the Gamo was 455 all told. The crew of
the little Speedy was but 38.
July 12, 1301 â The Cocar, an English
line-of-battle ship, and seven small
gunboats met a large French and Span
ish squadron in the f.traits of Gibraltar
and after a fierce fight destroyed all but
one frigate, the San Antonio, of 74 guns,
which was captured and put under the
British colors. The English loss was
trifling.
February 3, 1805 â The Arrow and the
Acheron, both 16-gun brigs, protected
a convoy of twenty-eight merchant
vessels against two powerful Spanish
frigates, and thrashed them off..
August 23, 1806â Captain C. Bris
bane, in the Arethusa, a small corvette,
captured the Spanish frigate Pomone.
January 1, 1807 â Captain Brisbane, in
the Arethusa, assisted by four other
vessels, captured the port of Curacoa.
November 24, 1807â Lieutenant Mc-
Kenzie. in a small cutter, captured ten
gunboats and a privateer. He de
stoyed them all.
April 24, 1808â Captain Searle, in a lit
tle gun brig, the Grasshopper, and a
cutter under command of Lieutenant
Baugh, engaged all the. Spanish gun

boats at Faro. The engagement was a
hot imp, but, as usual, the Anglo-Saxon
triumphed. Not a ship was left to fly
the Spanish flag. The English loss was
very small.
The list could be lengthened consid
erably, always with the same result.
Such victories as the Spaniards may
have gained over the English was al
ways done by vastly superior num
bers.
The same may be said of their "vic
tories" in the new world. It was always
a case of the rude implements of the
savage against the armor and guns of
Europe. When there has been any
thing like equality on both sides the
Spaniards have Invariably been de
feated. And so It must always be for
the reason that the Anglo-Saxons are
the most resourceful race that ever
lived.
CODES UP TO
MODERN TIMES
Changes of Twenty-Five
Years Are Inserted.
THE FULL REPORT WILL BE
IN FIVE VOLUMES.
Hon. Robert Nelson Bulla, of the Code
Commission, was in the city yesterday on
legal business. He has recently returned
from a session of the commission, which
has been very busy for some months get
ting the revision in shape. Speaking of
the progress made already, and of the
future work of the commission, he said:
"It is a vast undertaking that is under
way by the Commissioners, and we shall
not be able to have it completed until the
meeting of the Legislature. When you
take into consideration the fact that there
are thousands of sections to carefully re
vise, the extent of the work will at once
appear. Our work will appear in four
regular volumes, and another which will
be largely supplementary.
"There will he two regular reports, one
of which will be somewhat conservative
and of a churacter that all will almost
certainly agree with. There will he an
other report far more radical in its feat
ures, and this will recommend serious
changes, new bills and innovations. In
the main report we have omitted the sec
tions that have boon declared unconsti
tutional, but in every instance we have
made the proper annotations. We have
always made full notes on the changes,
referring to the decisions of the Supreme
Court modifying or otherwise affecting
the main points. Wherever the statutes
have made omissions that the Supreme
Court has. In a manner, supplied, we
have inserted them as sections of the
code. An instance In point is the case
of general elections, which have never
been defined In the codes. We found a
definition in the decisions of the Supreme
Court, and at once supplied It wfth due
credit.
"We have already completed our revi
sions of the civil code and will soon be
well along with our work on the political
code. It is all slow and tedious work.
Our plan is to assign a few hundred sec
tions to each member of the commission.
after which all of us have to read it by
sections and agree. The commission will
recommend a number of new bills, and
we hope many of them will pass. When
you take into consideration the fact that
the codes have not been revised for
twenty-five years, and that in that time
there have benn a great many changes In
the laws and affairs of the commonwealth
you will understand the extent of our
undertaking. "

NEWS OF THE MINES.
Year's Record Shows
Copper Booming To
ward Second Place.
Coal Will Have Its First Inning
This Yearâ The Doings
of Big Mines.
The figures giving the total mineral
record of the State for 1597 as compiled
by Statistician Charles G. Yale of the
Mining Bureau present but one marked
increase, and that is hi the production of
copper. In 1596 but 1,992,844 pounds, val
ued at $199,518, was credited to California's
copper mines. In 1897 the production rose
to 13,638,C2t> pounds, valued at $1,540,666.
This increase is wholly due to the great
and growing operations of tho Mountain
Copper Company in Shasta- County. There
is every prospect that the phenomenal
demand for copper and copper properties
will continue for some rears, and that it
will bring to this State as to other cop
per-producing regions as rapid and con
tinuous an increase as that- which lias
marked the past year. The old copper
mini's at Copperopolls are about to be
rehabilitated; in Shasta County are bodies
of copper ore as vast and valuable as that
being developed by tho Mountain Copper
Company; and these and other properties
elsewhere are now the subject of active
explottatlon/"%hich promises an early de
velopment. Copper has risen to third
place in the list of the State's mineral
products, and will likely In another year
outstep petroleum, which has recently
displacetl quicksilver as the product of
second importance.
The petroleum product increased in
value during the year from $1,180,793 to
$1,91H,269, and this is surely but a fraction
of the value which the annual product
will reach in the near future. Coal cut
small figure last year, but the recent
opening for operations on a large scale
of the Corral Hollow mines will in IS9B
place coal high in the list for the first,
time. The building of the new PostofÃce
will boom the product of building stone
this year and may result in the develop
ment of great marble quarries. The total
increase of $sr>iÂ»,ooo in the value of .the
State's mineral product In spite of the
dry year, which so greatly curtailed the
gold product, is evidence of the generally
healthy Condition of the mining industry,
which has in this State a future far
greater than its past.
The editor of the Georgetown Gazette
of Xl Dorado County preaches this edi
torial sermon after a visit to the boom
ing neighboring county of Tuolumne:
"During our few months' sojourn in
Tuolumno County last winter, one import
ant feature was observed, and we often
spoke about it, remarking what a con
trast there was between the mining spirit
of that and El Dorado County. That
cotinty ranks in population and wealth
a little under El Dorado. Two years- ago
her gold product was rated only a little
above that of El Dorado; now she ,runs
Nevada a close rub for the banner coun
ty, standing second. In Tuolumne we
found no business men talking about the
mines being played out and not being
worth taking hold of. On every hajid
people manifest the utmost confidence in
their mines. It is this spirit which is
bringing the famous old county to the
front. We need more of that spirit in
El Dorado. That is what encourages
miners and capital to come among us and
take hold. The success of our mining in
dustry is our only hope for prosperity.
Disrourage prospecting and mine devel
opment and the county goes backward.
We have a county certainly as rich in
gold aa any in the State, and what we

capitalists and men who come to look at
our mines and prospects."
The Amador Record says that the Cen
tral Eureka mine is looking finely. Splen
did ore has been encountered in the shaft
and it is how a foregone conclusion, that
this property is going to make one of the
great mines on the lode. The owners have
stood by the proposition faithfully and it '
has cost them a big sum of money to car
ry on the work, but they now have the ;
eatisfacton of knowing that success will I
crown their efforts. As matters now
stand it ought not to be many months be- i
fore a big mill will be pounding away and !
the Central Eureka counted among the j
steady bullion producers.
The Argonaut mine ,-i:d a dividend of I
10 cents per share for the month of April. â 
A syndicate of New Brunswick capital- i
ists is negotiating for the purchase of the j
Mountain mine, near Sierra City, Sierra I
County. The property is owned by Pat j
Keddy, Judge Garber and other San ;
Francisco parties. The mine is situated i
on the mountain side, 6000 feet above sea
level. The ore body is fifteen feet In ,
I width and carries low-grade free-gold ore, j
says the Redding Free Press. An aerial
tramway is used to carry the ore from i
the mine to the mill, which is situated on j
the river 4000 feet below the mine. The ;
mill has- forty stamps and is run by water
power. It is estimated that there are i
15,00 tons of ore in sight. If the ore will j
yield $4 per ton the company will purchase j
the property and put in sixty more i
stamps. The ore can be mined and milled !
for $2 ncr ton.
The National Mining Company of Rich
Gulch shipped by rail from this city on ;
Tuesday to the smelter at Vallejo June- j
tion a carload of sulphurets'. The ship- j
ment consisted of 265 sacks, of d. total i
weight of 25,000 pounds. The company has ,
the finest mill in this county. It is a late
improved ten-stamp battery mill with a â¢
full concentrator plant, and a canvas :
plant behind the concentrators to Rave
the sulphurets, which carry large j
values. â Redding Free Press.
A twenty-stamp mill is being erected by
Captain McMurtrie. A. Cornwall and
others at the Providence mine, on the
north fork of the Tuolumne River, about
fifteen miles from Sonora. Part of the j
machinery has been received, and the re- j
mainder will be delivered there this week, j
Large quantities of ore are being taken :
out of the mine at present.â Stockton In- j
dependent.
We w.ere on Wednesday shown some of !
the richest sulphurets we have ever seen. j
They were taken from, the Koltz mine at
Weal Point, at a depth of 650 feet. An j
assay of the sulphurets wont $SOO per ton.
The lead in the Keltz is about twenty j
inches wide and the rock assays $50 per
ton. The work of shipping the ore to ;
Selby's reduction works will be com
menced next week.â Calaveras Chronicle.
An immense gallows frame is being
erected over the shaft of the l.ightner
mine. We used to think that those of
tho Dtlca company were high, but this
one towers twenty-five feet above any
of them, it being 100 feet in height. The
Lightner mine joins the Utica on the
north. About its premises all is bustle
and activity, and that this property will
be a second Utica in the production of
the yellow metal there is no reason tor
question.â Calaveras Prospect.
A report reached San Andreas this week
to the effect that a rich strike had been
made at the old Thorn crevice at San
Antone Camp. The party who brought |
the news to town stated that the crevice
yields an average of $50 to the bucket,
which is, indeed, rich gravel. This crev- ,
ice was worked by Sheriff Thorn and a ;
partner in 1864-57. During the two sum
mers they extracted in the neighborhood j
of $27,000. James Lee", Frank Cuneo and
others are now working the claim.
Thomas Fullen of the old Demarest mine
was in San Andreas this week solicfting
subscribers to the capital stock of that j
young gold producer. It is intended to
incorporate the Demarest for $100,000.â
Calaveras Citizen.
The Nourso property has been bonded
for a good round sum. The formation is !
