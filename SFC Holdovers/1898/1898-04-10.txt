THE SPANISH ARMISTICE
IS A PLAY FOR DELAY
TO-DAY SPAIN
WILL DECLARE
AN ARMISTICE
The Mediation of Leo XIII, Backed
by the Powers, Has Had Its
Effect at Madrid.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett. I
MADRID, April 9. â Spain has ac
cepted the advice of His Holiness,
the Pope, and its Government has
granted the armistice which had been
suggested in the note of the United
States of March 29. What is more,
that armistice was g-iven by unani
mous consent of every member of the
Cabinet.
It has been an awful struggle.
Only yesterday evening all was lost.
General Woodford was, so to speak,
sitting upon his trunk, which was
packed. Mrs. Woodford and Miss
Eames, her niece, had left four days
ago and had crossed the frontier. So
had the naval attache. Lieutenant
Dyer, and the American residents
here were going out as fast as possi
ble. Nobody talked anything but
war. It was only very late last night
that messengers began to run about
in haste with letters that were mark
ed "Urgent." There was a mysterious
visitor at the house of Senor Moret.
Then letters were sent in urgent
haste to Senor Sagasta and to the
palace.
This morning broke upon a condi
tion of feverish excitement in the
public mind. "Nothing can avert
war, 1 ' said the proprietor of the most
serious paper here, as he came to ask
me for news, and he spoke like nine
ty-nine out of every hundred. There
was the deepest anxiety visible on
all faces, yet peace was in prospact
and they knew not of it. The morn-
Ing papers had given the public lit- i
tie hope. The Lioeral ominously
stated, in italics, that diplomacy had
ceased its functions. The Imparcial
announced among other pessimistic
news that Senor de Berna.be had his
orders to leave Washington and Gen
oral Woodford his to quit here. Ex
tensive space was given to the move- '
ments of ships for war purposes, and
the same about the movements of
troops.
The first note of peace was struck
at 11 o'clock, when representatives of
the great powers called at the house
of the Minister of State, Senor Gul
lon, and in the name of their respec
tive powers urged him to inform the
Government that the powers were
strongly of the opinion that for the
sake of peace and humanity the
Spanish Government should accept
the advice of the Pope. Opposition to
that advice was great. The majority
of the Cabinet were against it. Cab
inet councils were held one after the
other, but the Ministers could not
agree. The Papal Nuncio visited
hither and thither, but no result had
been arrived at. Spain's pride could
not see its way to accepting the pro
position desired by the people of the
United States.
That was the situation up to late
last night. Yet this morning and
even last night three persons at
least in Madrid considered that peace
was assured and what had seemed
impossible was about to be accom
plished. The visit of the Embassa
dors to Senor Gullon was one of the
outward signs of conditions which
would make an armistice possible.
The Embassadors left with the im
pression that what they recommend
ed would be accorded.
Later, at 1 o'clock, the Ministers
met. They were summoned to a coun
cil at the Foreign Office. The event
ful meeting lasted little more than
half an hour, for it was merely to
ratify the conclusion previously
known, to accept the only solution

CUBANS WILL
REJECT THE
PROPOSITION.
WASHINGTON. April 9.â Mr.
Quesada, the diplomatic repre
sentative of the Cuban insur
gents in this city, was Been this
afternoon with regard to the re
port from Madrid that the Queen
Regent might issue an armistice
proclamation. "It is useless for
us," said Mr. Quesada, "to re
iterate again for the thousandth
time that we will not accept an
armistice and give up the ad
vantages we naturally possess
in the rainy season. We under
stand perfectly that Spain seeks
only delay. We will have noth
ing but independence. As a mat
ter of fact, an armistice is a sus
pension of hostilities to be ar
ranged by the opposing gen
erals.
"General Blanco and General
Gomez would have to agree* to
an armistice. Does any one
think General Gomez would
agree to suspend hostilities just
as we are about to win the great
boon for which our people have
fought and struggled so long?
Besides, who is to take the prop
osition for an armistice to Gen
eral Gomez? The constitution of
the Cuban Republic and the civil
law forbid the general-in-chief,
under penalty of death, to enter
tain or receive any offer from the
Spanish lines unless it has for its
basis the absolute independence
of Cuba. Who is to carry the
offer? The fate of Ruiz is a
warning of the fate which would
await such an envoy."
for peace which had been mapped out
for Spain by American brains and
which was not so clearly seen here
at first, as it is recognized to be now,
as the only way out of the difficulty.
The good news was at once con
veyed to Senor de Bernabe at Wash
ington, so that he might tell Presi
dent McKinley of his triumph. At
the same time General Woodford, ;
who was aware of the favorable turn
j events had taken, was handed a
memorandum from the Spanish coun
cil, embodying the official account of !
: the acceptance of an armistice, with j
i a brief note of the hope that it might â 
'â  be conveyed to President McKinley
iat the earliest possible moment. I
was told that yesterday he had tele
graphed to Washington that he was
stopping here more out of form than |
for any hope he had of any good re
sults being forthcoming.
The following is a statement made
by one of the Ministers: "The proc
lamation has been telegraphed to
' Captain General Blanco and will be
issued by him to-morrow, Sunday, j
I The armistice is as to time unlimited,
| we fully hoping that peace may be
dovetailed into it.
"We specially wish the proclama
! tion of the armistice to come through j
i the hands of Captain General Blanco, j
I considering him the person most sat- |
isfactory to the United States, as the
j policy with which he has been asso- j
ciated has been one of humanity. It
|is for this reason the Government
i has placed it in his hands, hoping
that in so doing it is showing the
thoroughness of its intention."
The fact is also appreciated here

CONSUL-GENERAL LEE
SAILS OUT OF HAVANA
ON BOARD THE FERN
With Him Are the American Citizens Who
Remained in the Cuban Capital Up to
the Very Last Moment.
HAVANA, April 9.â The American dispatch-boat Fern, having on
board Consul-General Lee, Vice-Consul Springer and other employes of
the consulate and a number of American newspaper correspondents,
went to sea at 6 o'clock this evening, accompanied by the Bache and
the Evelyn, on which were a number of families, and the Olivette, with
147 passengers, among whom were Clara Barton, the family of Consul-
General Berndes, of Austria; George W. Childs, of the firm of Lawton
& Childs; Charles Todd, clerk of the firm of Zaldo & Co., and a number
of prominent families.
This city presents its habitual aspect of tranquillity in spite of the
announced departure of General Lee. The theaters are crowded and
the parks and principal streets are filled with people, who are cele
brating a religious festival, with admirable order being preserved.
In the interior towns the same tranquillity exists. Operations on
the stock exchange are paralyzed, but business continues to be done
in provisions, meats and other products coming from the United States.
friendly terms with General Lee, of '
whom he has always spoken well
when the American Consul was being
attacked in other quarters.
Senor Sagasta refuses entirely for :
the moment to make any statement
and the Ministers collectively con
sider the wiser policy of the moment
is discreet silence.
Few of the evening papers re
ceived the news of the armistice early
enough to make editorial comments.
The Epocha was one of the few ex
ceptions. It reflects what I told you,
that Spain has replied to the appeal
of all Europe, together with that of
the Chief of the Church.
The Correspondencia says: "It is
evident that tae pressure Of the pow
ers on the United States Government
will prove much more powerful in
favor of Spain after she has followed
their counsels."
The Corres, the Government organ,
says: "After this last step taken by
the powers it is impossible for this

than that taken."
One indication of the effect is the
enhancement of prices on the Bourse
from the moment the armistice was
announced.
SPAIN'S EMBASSADOR
IS VERY BOASTFUL
Says War Would Last for Years or
Forever, and Would Ruin Both
Spain and America.
LONDON, April 10.â Lloyd's weekly
newspaper this morning publishes
prominently an interview with Colonel
John Hay. the American Embassador,
which remarks are of the most discreet
character. The paper also publishes an
interview with Count Derascon, the
Spanish Embassador, who is reported
to have paid:
"The sponsibillty rests wit Presi
dent McKinley. If he makes war there
will be war which will last five or six
years, or forever, and will ruin both
Spain and the United States. We shall
fully avail ourselves of letters of mar
que. The Maine was lost through the
ignorance or carelessness of her officers
and crew."

NEW YORK. April 9.â The Her

graphs: Once more Spain is making a
desperate struggle to escape the inev
itable. Will she succeed? Official
Washington is anxiously waiting to
night the terms of the Queen's decree
proclaiming an armistice, which is to
be promulgated in Madrid to-morrow
before the rendering of the final ver
dict.
The exclusive announcement in the
Herald this morning that an armistice
was to be proclaimed by the Queen
was further confirmed by the re
ceipt of a cable from Minister
Woodford this afternoon and through
dispatches received by several of the
embassies in this city. But meager de
tails have yet come to light as to the
full scope of the Queen's last plea for
peace. Everything depends upon the
concession she has made.
Diplomacy may win after all, but
it must be stated that few public men
in Washington look for any proposi
tion which will meet the demands of
the United States to an extent that
will avert the carrying out of the
President's programme of forcible
intervention to put an end to Spanish
misrule in Cuba.
Since the receipt of Minister Wood
ford's cable this afternoon several
members of the Cabinet, who are fa
miliar with its contents, have told
me that it had not changed the Pres
ident's plan of sending his message
to Congress on Monday next. They
stated, however, that it would be safe
to wait for the full particulars of the

The New Charter.2
Spain's terms, is to co^er a period of
six months, during which the Cubans
will have an opportunity of deciding,
through the medium of the ballot-box,
the kind of government they want, and
that Spain will :ven go to the extent
of considering a proposition from them
for their complete independence on an
indemnity basis.
I am told from the same source that
negotiations are being conducted in
Washington with the representatives of
the Cuban republic with a view to pro
curing their consent to the proposed ar
mistice. It is also stated that the in
fluence of the Pope is being stronelv
exerted with the Cubans in the field.
but up to this time it has not developed
that any of the Cubans authorized to
speak have given their consent to the
proposed armistice.
The opinion that they may do so is
entertained only by the representatives
of the powers, which have prevailed on
Spain to grant the proposed armis
tice.
The prevailing opinion among
Washington officials is that the pro
posed decree is only a scheme for
further delay and in the nature of
a diplomatic trick to force the United
States into the position of making
an unjustifiable war.
The presence of Senator Eikins and
Colonel J. J. McCook at the White
House to-night is known to have some
connection with the proposed new ar
giistice. They are important factors in
the unofficial negotiatioi which are
going !>:i in the struggle to avert war
and to secure the independence of Cuba
through the medium ol an indemnity.
I am told that both of these gentlemen
are very optimistic in their views to
night. They consider that peace is now
practically assured.
War clouds still hover over the
White House, despite the efforts of
foreign and domestic peacemakers.
The course of the administration is
set in the direction of a policy which
every citizen can indorse and every
civilized nation of the world will
sanction when it is thoroughly un
derstood.
There was nothing very warlike to
the throngs of sightseers who clustered
about the executive mansion all day.
but upstairs in the President's library
all the horrors of war were discussed
and the responsibilities resting upon the
administration in the present crisis were
fully considered. Judge Day was called
to the White House early in the day.
He was the bearer of a cablegram from
Minister Woodford giving a brief out
line of the general situation in Madrid.
Minister Woodford made no allusion in
his first dispatch to the armistice, ex
cept to state the current gossip at the
Spanish capital o,n that subject. A cable
came from Minister Woodford later in
the day stating that an armistice would
be proclaimed to-morrow.
Judge Day also had a cablegram from
Consul-General Lee at Havana an
nouncing his readiness to depart from
Key West during the afternoon.
While Judge Day was engaged with
the President Senators Hanna, Elkins
and Aldrich called to particioat^ in the
long conference that took place in the
library. Rumors were immediately cir
culated that some definite information
bearing upon the armistice had arrived
and was being considered by the Presi
dent and his advisers. It is well known
that Senator Hanna still hopes for a
peaceful solution of the problem, and
that Senator Elkins has been the bearer
of numerous messages of a peaceful na
ture emanating from Rome. Senator
Aldrich was until a few days ago one of
the stanchest members of the peace
party, but is believed to be thoroughly
convinced now that war is inevitable
unless the Spanish flag is removed from
the island of Cuba.
While gossips were trying to fathom
the mysterious conference in the library

other official visitors were anxiously

AMERICANS IN
CUBA INSULTED
BY SPANIARDS
Dare Not F^eseQt Their Treatment
by the Dons Who Seen) to
Regard War as Existing.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, April 9.â 1 have important news as to what is going
on in Havana, My informant says: "The Spaniards are actively pre
paring for the United States, and seem to regard war with the United
States as already on. Americans in the interior are constantly in
sulted and dare not resent it.
"In Havana all possible obstacles are being- placed in the way of
refugees leaving. I would not be surprised if the last vessel load was
massacred. I noticed Spaniards were moving large quantities of dyna
mite out of the city and storing it in small towns in the interior. It
is feared that it will be exploded by American bombardment.
"Artillery that is being hurried out of Havana is understood to be
to prevent the landing of President McKinley's army of occupation.
The Spanish idea is that the American army will try to effect a landing
on the south coast.
"Spanish merchants, expecting a blockade, are making elaborate
arrangements with their English representatives in the Bahamas for
running the blockade. At one point only twenty-three miles of water
separates Cuba from English possessions. These arrangements are said
to be an elaborate scheme, which will not only cause Americans much
embarrassment in giving them a long coast line to patrol, but may
cause complications with England."
My informant further says the insurgents are more active than
ever. The French general in charge of the rebel forces in Havana
province has made great headway. He also believes Garcia and Gomez
are together,. Recently 1200 Spaniards went after thirty rebels not far
from Guyre, threw out a line, completely encircling them, and closed in.
The rebels cut their way through the Spanish line with machetes. They
did not fire a shot. They escaped and left twenty-six dead and wound
ed Spaniards behind them.
awaiting an audience with the President
in the anteroom. After more than an
hour of waiting these gentlemen re
ceived word that the President was very
busily engaged and would have to be
excused until a later hour.
In the meantime Postmaster-General
Gary arrived and was immediately in
vited to participate in the conference in
the library. The fact that Postmaster-
General Gary is a member of the Roman
Catholic church and the warm personal
friend of Cardinal Gibbons suggested
that he might also be the bearer of
some important information in connec
tion with the armistice. Comment was
made upon the fact that Postmaster-
General Gary and Judge Day were the
only representatives of the Cabinet nres
ent, and considerable significance was
attached to the fact that both Postmas
ter-General Gary and Judge Day were
prepared to join in any movement that
may result in a peaceful and honorable
adjustment of the present difficulty.
Representatives Boutelle, chairman of
the Committee on N .val Affairs, and
Cousins of lowa, one of the members of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who
favor immediate action for the free
dom of Cuba, suddenly appeared at the
White House and were at once ushered
into the conference room, and it was
announced that they were present by
special instructions.
This conference lasted several hours,
and when it concluded it was stated that
the subject under consideration had no
special bearing on the armistice, but that
the conference was held with the view to
harmonizing action in the Senate and
the House of Representatives after the
President's message is delivered to Con
gress. As is well known, there are sev
eral factions in the Republican party
in the House and in the Senate, and
certain gentlemen are disposed to ques
tion the wisdom of adopting a joint
resolution in favor of intervention
without recognizing the independence
of the Cuban republic.
It is understood this subject was
fully considered at the conference, and it
is believed that harmonious action will
be the result when the resolutions to
follow the message are presented for the
consideration of the House and Senate.

The Commodore Only Waits the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 9.â An Old Point
Comfort, Va., special to the Herald
says: Commoc" -re Schley notified the
Navy D. pa. ment this morning that he
is ready. He awaits now the word to
move, although it is known that the
order depends entirely on developments
in Washington which may be such as
to hold the flying squadron in Hampton
Roads until it can be joined by the
cruisers San Francisco and New Or
leans.
Nothing remains to be done in the
way of preparation en any of the ships.
The bunkers are crammed full of coal,
magazines are filled with ammunition
and store room? -vith provisions. One
of the final preparations among the of
ficers of the squadron be \ leaving
peaceful waters was observed this
afternoon upon the wharf and in the
express offices at the Fort Shore
clothes, cabin and wardroom bric-a
brac and personal belongings, including
everything not needed in action, had
been packed in trunks, chests and grip
sacks, which were taken ashore in the
ships' boats, and awaited the evening
boats and trains to be conveyed to
home addresses. The officers, like the
ships of the squadron, are now cleared
for action.
The Massachusetts. thoroughly
cleaned of the tenacious sea growth on
its bottom, gained in Southern waters,
came down from Newport News this
afternoon and cast anchor in close
proximity to the flagship Brooklyn and
cruiser Minneapolis. Like her com
rades of war she is in condition,
coal stored and ammunitioned, with
only her boats to be cast astern and
combination deck ladders thrown over
board, to begin active operations.
I made inquiries to-night regarding
the rumor that the slower-going battle
ship Massachusetts was to exchange
places with the speedy cruiser New
York, at present Captain Sampson's
flagship in the North Atlantic squad
ron, but so far as I was able to learn
there is no foundation for it. At least
it is a matter that the squadron officers
say they know nothing about and have
heard nothing.
GIVES A DIFFERENTIAL
TO COAST BUILDERS.
Important Stipulation in the Bill
Providing for Three Battle
ships and Four Monitors .
WASHINGTON, April 9.â The naval
bill as completed by the sub-commit
tee, of which Senator Perkins of Cali
fornia is a member, in providing for
three new battle-ships and four coast
defense vessels of the monitor type,
stipulates that in awarding these con
tracts Pacific Coast contractors shall
be allowed a differential of 4 per cent
on one of the battle-ships and on one
coast defense monitor. The bill pro
vides that no more than two vessels
shall be built in any one yard. The
monitors are similar to the Monterey,
and will cost one million and a quarter
each, exclusive of armor, and the total
cost of each when armored will be
about one million and a half.
The committee also increased the
number of torpedo-boat destroyers
from twelve to sixteen, and their ton
nage from 350 to 400 and the speed to
thirty knots.
Senator Perkins also secured an ap
propriation of $100,000 for necessary
wharves and buildings for the proposed
naval apprentice station on Goat
Island.
GLAD BELLIGERENCY
IS NOW RECOGNIZED
WASHINGTON, April 9.â Mr. Ques
ada, the representative of the Cuban
Junta in this city, said to-night: "The
Cubans are gird to see their belliger
ency at Kst recognized by the Spanish
Government. Cubans will not cease
fighting nor entertain any negotiations
which have not for their -sis the ab
solute independence of the island of
Cuba." :.. . . Â
CONDITIONS
CANNOT NOW BE
COMPLIED WITH
SpaiQ Must Settle for the MaiQe
flffair After the CubaQS Are
Dealt With Justly.
WASHINGTON, April 9.â After conferences at the White House to-night
men who are in the confidence of the President expressed the belief that the
granting of an armistice would not materially change the policy as al
ready matured. One of the men who had a long conference with the
President to-night, expressed the opinion that the proposed armistice
tended materially toward a peaceful solution of the Cuban question,
although he declined to venture even a suggestion as to how the propo
sition would be received by Congress.
"The Maine incident will still be left for solution," said he, "and
that is the question upon which Congress and the country are at the
present moment excitedly sensitive."
The exact terms of the armistice are felt to be the most essential
feature of Spain's concessions. At the outset, it was supposed to be
an unconditional grant of armistice. Later, however, the advices from
Madrid and London stated conditions of a very material character.
If these conditions prove to be accurate, they will doubtless compli
cate the situation here and leave the crisis quite as acute as it has
been at any time heretofore.
A Cabinet officer said recently that the administration had not
considered the proposition of withdrawing the American fleet from Key
West, and while this was some days ago, it is not believed now that
such a proposition would meet with any serious consideration. The fact
that Spain has granted this armistice as the result of influence ex
erted by the great powers of Europe and the Pope leads to much con
jecture as to how far the material influences of the powers will be
given in support of Spain, now that she has yielded to their earnest
solicitation. It has been understood thus far that the movement of
the powers was purely disinterested, but press dispatches from abroad
indicate that Spain's yielding to these Continental influences had es
tablished a closer bond than had hitherto existed.
GERMANY IS
YET NEUTRAL
Refuses Austria's Over
tures to Help Spain
Out at Present.
Emperor William Also Truly
Predicts Americans Would
Not Permit Mediation.
Naval Attaches Abroad Ordered to
Stop Buying Warships and
Get Ready to Return.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April 9.â A1l news of the
Hispano-American crisis is anxiously
watched in Germany, as the opening
of actual hostilities is expected, and
German interests, especially her com
mercial interests, are involved.
The newspapers, although still hoping
that peace will not be broken, are be
ginning to discuss the probable effect
of war upon trade. Public opinion is
much divided, many of the papers ex
pressing the opinion that the United
States ought to be satisfied with the
concessions that Spain is offering;
others declaring, however, that the
United States is right in declaring the
independence of Cuba as the only
means of preventing the recurrence of
the disturbance and quieting just in
dignation in America at Spanish mis
rule.
Hardly anybody in serious political
circles doubts that war is coming, the
points at issue being deemed irreconcil
able, although every paper does full
justice to President McKinley's mode
ration and evident desire for peace.
The national conservative newspapers
have taken the occasion to point out
that in the event of war Germany
ought to seize the opportunity to se
cure objects which her politicians have
been aiming at for years. The Deutsche
Zeitung, the leading organ of this party,
expresses the hope that the German
Foreign Office is arranging to "appro
priate Samoa, drive the Americans
from there and take possession of one
or more of the Antilles; if possible, the
Danish Islands, as Germany, after
Cuba has become American or inde
pendent, will require a coaling station
in these waters for her navy and mer
chant marine." â¢
It is learned at the Foreign Office
here that the Cannamaba incident has
been satisfactorily settled, Spain agree
ing to pay 450,000 pesetas damages for
the destruction of German property and
the lives taken by the insurgents on
that part of Cuba, In consequence of
this settlement the German warship
Geir has been ordered to Brazil instead
of going to Havana for the purpose
of collecting an indemnity and punish
ing the perpetrators of the outrage.
The newspapers, however, call on the
Government to send at least one war
ship to protect German interests in case
of hostilities, and it is understood the
navy department has instructed the
officials at Kiel to send a vessel across
the Atlantic.
In the event of an outbreak the offi
cial attitude of Germany will not be
changed. Under no circumstances will
she depart from the strictest neutral
ity. The Spanish Embassador here.
Senor Mendez de Vigo, made another
attempt during the past week to secure
Germany's intervention or mediation,
while Emperor Francis Joseph of Aus
tria renewed his personal and confiden
tial solicitations on the same subject
with Emperor William. Germany,
however, has taken up the position that
the question exclusively concerns the
United States and Spain, and that un
less both of these countries ask German
mediation or good offices, any steps in
thfÂ» matter would be useless.
It is said on unexceptional authority
that the Queen Regent was the initia
tor of the movement to enlist the Pope
in Spain's behalf, and that Emperor
Francis Joseph aided her, but Emperor
William warned them that the step was
likely to meet with the decided disap
proval of the majority of Americans.
A diplomat at the Spanish Embassy,
in an interview, said: "Spain is ready
for war if it comes. "While it fs true
that a large number of the Spanish
people are anxious for war, that Gov
ernment is trying to avoid it. Iw the
event of war the Spaniards can be de
pended upon to stand by the Queen
Regent and the young King in spite of
all democratic conspiring which is go
ing on. It would be cowardly for them
to act otherwise. The Yankee republic
will find the present generation of
Spaniards as chivalrous as their fore
fathers."
Lieutenant A. P. Niblack, the United
States naval attache here and at Rome,
is waiting orders to proceed to Italy
again.
Commander Willard Brownson, the
agent of the United States Navy De
partment in Europe, has been given
SPAIN LOSES
ONE ISLAND.
HONGKONG, April 9.âRebel
lion has broken out in Zebu, one
of the Philippine Islands and an
important business cer.'er of the
hemp and sugar trade. The ca
ble has been cut, news being sent
by foreigners through sailing
craft. Foreigners are safe. The
whole island has been taken by
the rebels, and the Governor and
other Spanish employes mur
dered or taken prisoners.
Three steamers have taken
troops to the scene of action. It
is expected that Iloilo and other
southern islands will follow. The
whole country is agitated.
The Spanish provincial Gover
nor at Tayabas has been severe
ly wounded. His adjutant has
been killed in Ilocas province,
and a priest and the captain of
the civil guard were mortally
wounded.
Riots in Pangasinan continue.
Precautions are taken in Manila,
but trouble is expected.
authority to issue instructions to all
the United States naval attaches in
Europe, accord*--- to the requirements
of the situation. In fact, there is even
a possibility that they may all be
called home. On strictly reliable au
thority it is learned that all the United
States naval attaches have been or- i
dered to end their negotiations for the
purchase of warships, munitions of I
war, etc. The reason for this is that
the time is regarded as too short to al
low for the transportation of the pur
chases to the United States before
war is declared. The same authority
says heavy demands have been made
for war material, tl.e nature of which
is kept a profound secret, but which in
the event of hostilities wili play a most
important role.
TWO SPANISH CRUISERS
DEPART FROM CADIZ.
Cape Verde Islands the Destination
of the Cristobal Colon and In
fanta Maria Teresa.
WASHINGTON, April 9.â Two of the
Spanish cruisers which have been with
the fleet at Cadiz have left that place
for the Cape Verde Islands, where the
rest of the torpedo fleets is rendezvous
ing. This information came to the
Navy Department to-day. These two
vessels are the Cristobal Colon and the
Infanta Maria Teresa, both armored
cruisers. The information in posses
sion of the Navy Department is that
only a portion of the original torpedo
fleet that left Spain and the Canary Is
lands, presumably for Porto Rico,
reached the Cape Verde Islands.

The Eminent Physician and Specialist Who Has Discovered
How To Tell If We Have Kidney,
Bladder or Uric Acid Trouble,
HOW TO FIND RELIEF AND CURE QUICKLY.
You May Have a Sample Bottle Sent Free by Mail.
There comes a time to both men and
women when and poor health
bring anxiety and trouble hard to bear;
disappointment seems to follow every
effort in our behalf; we get discouraged
and skeptical. In most cases serious
mistakes are made in our treatment,
and in not knowing what the disease is
or what makes us sick.
If a peculiar pain attacks you, try to
locate its origin and discover which or-
gan of the body is sick and in need of
attention.
If the kidneys are at faultâ and in
almost every case in the failing of our
health they are â look well to their res-
toration to health and strength.
They are the great filters of our body,
and consequently, the purity of the
blood is entirely dependent on their
cleansing powers.
If the kidneys are not in a perfectly
clean and healthy condition, the blood
becomes impregnated with impurities
and a decay of the kidneys soon takes
place. If your desire to relieve your-
self of -water increases, and you find it
necessary to arise many times during
sleeping hours, your kidneys are sick.
As they reach a more unhealthy stage,
a scalding and irritation takes place as
the water flows, and pain or dull ache
in the back makes you miserable. If
the water, when allowed to remain un-
disturbed for twenty-four hours, forms
a settling or sediment, you are in the
grasp of most serious kidney or blad-
der diso-ier.
If neglected now the disease advances
until the face looks pale or sall.iw.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 9.â Theoffl

gram v s sent by Count Muravieff, the
Rupsian Minister for Foreign Affairs,
on March 15, to M. Pavloff, the Russian
Charge d'Affaires at Peking:
"Hy imperial command you are
charged to convey the following greet
ing to the Emperor of China: 'It was
with pleasure that we learned of the
wise decision of your Majesty in order
ing the Tsung Li Yamen (Chinese
Foreign Off.cc) to sign the agreement
for the cession to Russia for her use of
Port Arthur and Talien Wan. and also
the railroad concession connecting Port
Arthur with the Siberian main line. To
this agreement we attach great his
torical siT.incanee, for it will doubtless
porve to strengthen still more the ties
of friendship which have ever existed
between our powerful neighboring em
pires and which so clearly correspond
in the interests of the states. With our
whole heart we greet your Majesty and
wish y"U a prosperous reign.' "
M. Pavlofl "n April 5 f=ent the fol
lowing dispatch to Count Muravleff:
"In solemn audience to-day I was
permitted, in distinction of all other
audiences, to ascend the steps of the
throne to hand your telegTam with my
own hand to the Kmperor. The Em
peror, in receiving: it, arose from the
throne, read its contents aloud and
made a speech, in which he said:
" 'We are .all extraordinarily erateful
for the friendly telegram of his Ma
jesty. The cordial friendship which
has existed for < r 200 years letween
our own states, and which was lately
once more affirmed by a treaty of al
liance, will now be still further
strengthened. The sincere friendship
and community of interests between
the two states will conduce to the
prosperity <>f these two nations. I re
quest you to communicate these words

SONORA. April 9.â Thomas W. "Wells,
nty Treasurer and manager of the
Bonora agency of the Bank of Commerce,
is short $19,000 in his accounts as treas
urer. He has secured the bank, turning
over all of his private property and se
curities. There was a run on the Bank
of Commerce this morning, but depositors
soon quieted down when it became known
there was plenty of money on hand to
cash every check presented. Many who
at the start clamored wildly for their
deposits this afternoon redeposited their
funds.
Many business men and local capital
ists came to the relief of the bank. Con
fidence is now ful!y restored.
Treasurer Wells has borne an enviable
reputation for honesty. He was temper
ate, and never gambled or dissipated in
any manner. It is confidently expected
the securities will cover the deficiency
when realized upon.
Henry F. Emrrir. who, until two months
acm, was president of the Bank of Com
mcrrp. said last night:
"This is a great surprise to me, for
none of Wells' friends here has received
any intim.-uinn that he was in trouble.
I cannot imagine how he could get away
with that amount of money, for he is a
man of exemplary habits and a shrewd
business man.
"He has property in Sonora and else
where that is worth I should say* $50,000
or $60,000, and I am sure he will make
good any shortage there may be.
"As for the bank, it will not be affect
ed in the least. W. C. Murdoch, the cash
ier, is now in Sonora and will protect its
interests. I have known Wells for a
long time and regarded him as one of the
most trustworthy men I know. We are
interested in the Bell mine in Tuolumne
County, but he has not sunk any money
in that."

FRANK BELEW TO
YIELD HIS LIFE
ON THE GALLOWS
Judge Buckles Finds Nothing to
Warrant Mercy in Dealing
With the Murderer.
SUISUN, April 9.â The taking of testimony in the case of Frank
Belew, the murderer of his brother and sister at Dixon, was resumed
this morning. The defense called T. L. Vinton, William McGregor, W.
Johnson and Andrew Rapp, residents of Cherokee, Butte County, all
of whom knew Belew when he was a young man, and testified that
they considered him insane at various times. Belew's att aeys adml -
ted that the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree, but
argued for life imprisonment, stating that the testimony they had In
troduced showed that Belew was a very weak-minded man and at
times had shown signs of insanity. District Attorney Devlin did not
argue the case.
In the afternoon the court gave its decision. The courtroom was
crowded. Judge Buckles addressed the defendant at length. He said
he had gone as carefully into the evidence as it was possible to do, and
both the question as to character and that of weakness of mind had
been duly considered. Referring to the evidence aa to Belew's in
sanity, Judge Buckles said that most people could look back into their
own history and possibly recount some Incident In their neighbors'
lives, some eccentric things: but they have grown to manhood with no
suspicion of insanity, and that led him to think that the suggestion of
an unsound mind came only e'ter such a heinous crime was commit
ted. In fact, any man who would commit such a crime might be said
to be unbalanced. There certainly was a distinction between men
who committed crimes and men who did not.
"It may be," said the court, "that there is a sort of passion that is
irresistible that leads them on to crime, but the law can take no cog
nizance of that unless there is an absolute reduction of the faculties of
the mind. It did not seem from the testimony that anything had been
shown indicating such an unbalancing of mind as would relieve the de
fendant."
Judge Buckles concluded as follows:
"Theie are no mitigating circumstances or anything In my Judg
ment that would warrant a jury in determining that Belew's punish
ment should be imprisonment for life. My decision, therefore, is that
in this case there are no mitigating circumstances or facts or any
thing whatever which can relieve the defendant from the extreme
penalty of the law for such cases. The defendant will appear in this
court on Tuesday, April 12, at 10 a. m., to receive his sentence and to
have the day fixed for carrying the sentence into execution."
Attorney Clark excepted to the decision on the ground that it was not
warranted in law by the facts and circumstances.
Belew presented a most dejected appearance, and when taken back
to his cell looked like a man who had lost all hope.

Court-Martial Will Begin
Fresh Proceedings
Against Zola.
French Army Officers Refuse to

and Friends.
The Government Will Not Allow a
Renewal 61 the Scandalous Scenes
of the First Trial.
Copyrighted. 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, April 9.â The court-martial |
which met in consequence of the judg
ment of the high court of appeal to
consider whether It would in its own
name Institute fresh proceedings
against M. Zola has decided in the af- !
firmative, and has also passed a reso- j
lution asking that an application be
made to the grand chancellor of the |
Legion of Honor to have the na- i of j
Zola struck off the list of officers in the i
Legion.
This decision was only taken after a j
long consultation with closed doors I
and after a warm debate. I under
stand from a reliable source that the
argument which prevailed among the
officers of the court-martial was the
maladroit and Impudent attitude of
Zola and his friends when the decision
of the court of appeals was made
known. They asserted that the court
did not dare to reopen a cause of so \
scandalous a nature to a fresh trial, j
wherein no one would be spared. The ;
court-martial would not appear to
shrink before such menaces or tr dis
avow even in appearance the action of â 
General Billot, Minister for War, who !
instituted the proceedings on his own !
initiative.
Zola's freinds and Zola himself, in an j
interview yesterday, expressed satis
faction at the prospect of a new trial, j
but I have good reason for believing ;
they are mistaken as to the prospect
of fresh scandals. The Government
has fully decided not to allow the scan- j
dalous scenes and disturbances that
accompanied the first trial to be re
newed. I give you the opinion of a |
member of the ixovernment who said j
to me: "The Zola trial is a chose
jugee. Remember, in France the same
things are not done twice."

REDDING, April 9.â The smelters of
the Mountain Copper Company at Kes

of the shutdown is a shortage in cal

at the roasting plants will be continued
as usual. In the meantime needed re

ment has taken action compelling the
company to put in condensers, and that
the shutdown is the result.
The closing of the smelters will have
no effect at Iron Mountain, for the
mine is behind in the ore supply, not
that ore is not there, but because the
mines cannot get out enough, nor the
company's railroad haul it. Over 600
tons of ore is the daily output of the
mine.
It Is said that during the shutdown
the company will make arrangements
for procuring a permanent summer
supply of water. The rainless winter
has left the creeks perfectly dry, when
in ordinary seasons a good head of
w r ater would be flowing until late in
summer.
MAHMOUD PASHA'S ARMY
IN DISORDERED FLIGHT.
Bodies of Two Thourand Dervishes
Counted on Friday's
Battlefield.
CAIRO, April 9.â The Anglo-Kgyptlan
force surrounded Atbara last evening
and the wounded were all placed In hos
pitals under the tents. All the troops
will return to their quarters in the night.
The forces of Mahmoud Pasha are com
pletely broken up I art of them are flee
ing toward Atbara and others in the di
rection of the Nile. The thickness of the
brush rendered pursuit of them by the
Egyptian cavalry uitfieult.
The bodies of 2000 Dervishes, including
those of twelve important Emirs, have
been counted. Notable among the num
ber of Emirs who were slain is Wad
Blsiara, formerly Emir of Dongola.
It is believed that 1000 other members of
Mahmoud's army are killed. Ten guns
and a quantity of rifles were captured.
u .ahmoud says his army consisted of 12 -
O.j infantry and 4000 cavalry.
CROP PROSPECTS IN
SANTA CLARA VALLEY.
Outlook Shown to Be Much Better
Than Was Anticipated Early
in the Season.
9AN JOSE, April n.â Reports made by
members at a meeting of the San Jose
Grange show that there will be a good
yield of fruit In Santa Clara County this
season. It was the consensus of opinion
that the outlook was uch better than
had been anticipated. There will be a full
crop of prunes, a light crop of peaches
a fair crop of cherries and in ..ie foothills
a good crop of apricots. If the second
blossoms now upon the apricot trees of
the valley set, as it Is expected they will
there will be a fair crop of that fruit in
the valley. Hay and grain are sadly in
need of rain, but should there be a good
downpour during the present monui these
crops will be very fair.
MOBBED BY
RITUALISTS
Thrilling Climax in the
Crusade of John
Kenzil.
Seizes a Crucifix in St. Cuth
bert's Church as a Protest
Against "Pcpery."
During the Most Painful Scene That
Followed the " Reformer" Was
Roughly Handled.
LONDON, April 9.â The anti-Ritual
ist crusade of John Keniil, the lay
man who on January 15, 1897, caused a
sensation by reading a protest against
the election of Dr. Mengel Creighton as
Bishop of London in succesion to the
Most Rev. Frederick Temple, now
Archbishop of Canterbury, on the
ground of Dr. Creighton's alleged de
sire to "undo the work of the Reforma
tion by introducing the trinkets of
Rome, etc.," has been especially vigor
ous during Holy Week, culminating in
extraordinary scenes in St. Cuthbert's
Church yesterday (Good Friday),
where, as customary during the past
years, the conduct of the service con
sisted in chanting St. John's story of
the Passion on the same lines as the
Oberammergau play, the officiating
clergy taking the roles of Christ, Pilate
and Caiaphas.
One of the principal features Is known
as the "Veneration of the Cross," and
the crucifix was being removed from
the altar to the steps when the clergy,
acolytes and congregation advance
in pairs, prostrate themselves and kiss
the figure of Christ."
At the tail of the procession was Mr.
Kenzil, surrounded by a body of
friends. They advanced to the altar
steps; but. Instead of kneeling, Ken
zil horrified the congregation by sud
denly seizing the crucifix, raising it
aloft and frantically rushing toward
the door, shouting: "In the name of
God I denounce this idolatry and
Popery in the Church of England. May
God help me."
A most painful scene ensued. A
crowd of people surrounded Mr. Ken
zil and struck him and whirled with
him. one man going so far as to thrust
a handkerchief into Mr. Kenzil'smouth
in order to gag him. Finally the con
gregation rescued the crucifix and the
police entered the church and arrested
Mr. Kenzil.

It creates appetite; builds up muscular

neuralgia. As it can be assimilated by the
weakest stomach, its nourishing properties
are far superior to nauseating cod liver oil

John J. Southeimer, one of the can
didates for the appointing: board, urged
upon his hearers the absolute necessity
of a change in the administration of
the affairs of the city government. He '
declared that if i.. the election of next
Monday the boss and all that he rep- ;
resented were not defeated, the people ;
would not again have a chance to free
the city from its bondage of corruption
and misrule for many years to come.
Judge J. R. Lewis followed. He
epoke in part as follows:
With the exception of the years 1592
and 1593 our city has been in the hands
of the most corrupt political gang that
was ever inflicted upon any city, for the
past ten years. Extravagance, fraud and
corruption have pervaded all the depart
ments of the city government. We have
had "boss rule" of the worst character.
Our taxes have been increased, an dthe
public funds squandered, mir city officers
have been made the subject of barter,
and even our magnificent common school
system has had to pay tribute to a non
resident political "boss," who for years
has fattened upon our city treasury, and
prostituted our city and its officers. No
official, however high, and no employe,
however humble, but has had to con
tribute to his greed and bow to his com
mands. Such a condition of affairs is a
disgrace to our city and an outrage upon
our taxpayers.
Our "boss" has levied tribute upon the
widow's mite, and the orphan's inherit
ance; upon the mechanic's home, and the
laborer's wages; upon the profit of the
merchant and manufacturer, and the
earnings of capital; upon the pews of our
churches, and the furniture of our pri
vate schools; and the grave question now
presented to our people is: Shall this
condition of affairs in our city be perpet
uated, or shall our people, by the election
of honest and competent me.n to fill our
city offices, have an economical and hon
est government, worthy of our city and
its citizens?
There are practically two tickets In the
field, one nominated by the New Charter
Club, composed of 500 of our best citizens,
and the other named by our political
"boss" and his pliant "cabinet" of three.
Never before in the history of San
Jose has so large a convention of citizens
assembled to nominate candidates as that
of the Charter Club, on the evening of
the nomination of its municipal ticket,
and never before was the action of any
convention so earnest, so deliberate and
so unanimous. Every candidate was
nominated by the unanimous vote of over
500 members of the convention.
The ticket is made up of men of the
highest character and unquestioned integ
rity; of men who have helped to build
up our city and its institutions, and mf-n
who believe that the prosperity of thÂ«
city depends upon the uprooting of this
corrupt political "boss" rule; of men
pledged to no "boss," no individual, no
scheme; men who are resolved to hayÂ«
once more in our fair city a respeetabla
and economical government of the peo
ple, and by and for the whole peopleâ a
government which will fairly put into ope
ration our new charter nnd carry out the
reforms therein provided.
While our leading city papers in thfc
interest of the perpetuation of corrupt
"boss" rule have from day to day made
general charges against the Charter
Club, for the manifest reason that thÂ»
election of Its ticket will prevent their
raids upon the city treasury, they have
in no instance made any charges against
the high standing and integrity of any
of our candidates, nor can they success
fully make such charges.
Our "boss" was not satlfied with our
ticket, and, being schooled by the rail
road men when on the State Railroad
Commission, he knew that if the New
Charter ticket was elected he would have
to "pack his grip" and leave, and he
went to work to concoct a scheme to de
feat our ticket and perpetuate his rule.
He appealed to the Republican party, the
"grand old party which he professes to
love," but it had had enough of him and
would not join his crusade. He appealed
then to the Democratic party, made noble
by its founders. Jefferson and Jackson,
but It would have none of him. He then
appealed to the joint action of both par
ties, but they would rwt aid him. He then
made an appeal to his "cabinet of old,"
men with whom he had worked for years,
to "Paul" and "Johnnie." They respond
ed and were equal to the occasion. He
then fixed up his slate and shrewdly called,
first upon our banks, wherein were some
of his friends, and first proceeded to fix
the appointing board. From one came its
president, from one its president, general
manager and a majority at its board of I
directors and from another its president '
and with this splendid financial backing j
and the support of his newspapers he
proceeded to make up his ticket.
I have no criticism to make upon the
men he has selected to follow him. They
have the right to do so, and many of
them are most excellent gentlemen but '
they are In the minority on his ticket and '
are in very bad company.
San Jose is a beautiful city, but it is
a most expensive luxury to live here un
der our "boss rule.
"But," says the "boss," "we must not
let the world know our condition- it will
damage us; It will give us a bad name
abroad.
In my experience In life I have learned
that It Is always best to let the truth be

known. It has been well said by a dis
tinguished poet that.
He is a freeman whom the truth makes free
Agd all are slaves, beside.
And the great Teacher said, "And ye
shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free."
It will not damage our city and her
people to know the truth, and 1 feel as
sured that when they do know the truth
they will rise up in all their manhood
and free themselves from the control of
the corrupt government of political "boss
ism." The truth will make them free.
J. P. Jarman, candidate for Council
man at large, said it was the purposs
of the New Charter Club and its candi
dates to break the shackles that bound
the city to the boss and his band of cor
ruptionists.
"Unless we take heroic measures on
next Monday," he said, "and com
pletely eradicate the cancer of corrup
tion that infects this city, it means
that we will continue to have empty
stores and houses, idle men, low wages,
low rents and high taxation."
He then related a number of his per
sonal experiences while a member of
the Council, in illustration of how Rea
and Mackenzie manipulated that body
against the public's interest. Council
man Nolting was shown to be particu
larly culpable.
J. O. Hayes, one of the most active
members of the Good Government
League of Santa Clara County, made
an effective talk, which was In part as
follows:
The issue in this campaign is not one be
tween individuals, as has been so often
said, but the lines are squarely drawn be
tween the "gang" and "bosses," and
those who are opposed to this method of
conducting political and public affairs.
I cannot believe that the spirit of lib
erty and independence that has always
stirred the American heart to patriotic
deeds is dead in the hearts of those who
are so blessed as to live in this most
favored spot on earth. Here God smiles
upon nature and it comes forth tv rich
fruition, and here the divine in man
should be quickest to respond when de
mand is made upon it. The citizens of
this fair cfty are now called upon to
show whether they are still men whose
hearts are fired by the spirit of the fatn
ers, or whether they are become degen
erate and unworthy sons of the noblest
ancestors that the world has ever be
held.
Are we men who resent the approach
of tyranny and oppression, or are we be
come slaves who hear the crack of the
oppressor's whip and feel its sting and
smart upon our backs, and quail before
him in abject fear and servility?
Where is the man so low "that he is
willing to do homage to the "boss" and
become his obedient subject? Our fathers
fought to free us from the oppression of
a King who claimed to rule by divine
right, and our brothers by adoption have
sought our shores because here the rule
of the individual has given place to the
sovereignty of the peop.o, and the prin
ciples of liberty, justice and right are
the supreme law. Are these days become
so degenerate that you will now give up
your manhood and rights into the hands
of a self-appointed gang of politicians
who claim no other right to govern you
than their own inordinate desire to con
trol your offices, your public treasury and
the education and direction of the lives
of your children? I cu,nw>z and do not
believe that you will.
Even those candidates for office who are
profiting by the support of the "gang"
have enough faith in your manhood to
make them not willing to admit their al
legiance to it, and they are full of protes
tations that they rlo not belong to the
"gang"' and are not controlled by the
"boss." But, my friends, be not deceived
by the protestations of those who would
sell their birthright of liberty and inde
pendence for the pottage of public posi
tion, but meet their assurance by the
statement that the hand may feel like
the hand of Esau, but the voice of the
protestation is the voice of Jacob.
Who called out the People's Municipal
ticket? The gang! What organivd force
is behind it and fighting its battles?
The bosses and the gang! Who are try
ing to terrorize and vilify those who are
opposing it? The bosses and the gang!
Who will claim the victory, if it should
win? The bosses and the gang! Who
will control the policy of your city gov
ernment if these candidates take office?
The bosses and the gang!
Would you turn your faces in the
direction of honest and economical gov
ernment? Would you redeem your
schools from the suspicion that is 'now
breathed against them? Would you pub
lish to the world your freedom and your
manhood? Would you return again to
the rule of the people, by the people and
for the people, and be free from the boss
and the rule of the gang and for the
gang? The opportunity is now given
you by electing the Charter Club ticket
from top to bottom.

TIME TO END
CORRUPT RULE
San Jose About to Enter
Upon an Era of
Prosperity.
Citizens Thoroughly Aroused
to the Necessity of Oust
ing Rea.
Municipal Garden Will on Monday-
Be Cleansed of Its Obnoxious
Weeds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 9.â ln a final, des
perate effort to injure the cause of
good government ag represented by the
New Charter Club ticket, the morning
organ of the "gang" has raised a howl
that the reputation of San Jose Is
being injured by the facts being made
public of the corruption and extrava
gance that exists in public offices. It
does not deny that such regrettable
conditions exist, nor does it attempt to
deny that they have been produced by
bossism and gang rule for which itself
and "Jim" flea and Johnnie Mackenzie
and others of that ilk are responsible.
Naturally the gangsters, their organ
and their master want all facts of this
kind suppressed.
But the intelligent and progressive
people of San Jose are not to be deceiv
ed at this stage of developments by any
false appeal to their loyally to and
pride in their beautiful city. They
know that the political conditions that
exist are artificial and unnatural; that
rank and poisonous weeds have been
allowed tp grow without restraint in the
garden ot municipal administration;
that good and economical government
has been blighted and progress and
prosperity have been checked by their
failure to prune and uproot where it
would do the most good.
The people of San Jose and every one
who has had the pleasure of viewing
this city and examining its advantages
and attractions know that the natural
conditions are such that San Jose, by
reason of them, is entitled to take a
foremost place among the cities of Cali
fornia. They have suffered in secret
from the corruption and extravagance
of the "gang" as long as they propose
to, and they have now determined to
begin the work of pruning and weeding,
and they are not ashamed to let the
world know -that they have awakened
from their indifference. The actual
conditions that have existed here for
years has been known more or less to
the world at large, despite the con
tinuous efforts of the "gang" to conceal
them, but the people have been diffi
dent in acknowledging them to them
selves. This they have now done, but
at the same time they have determined
to change them, and in the election
that is to be held on Monday they hope
to make a thorough clearing in their
political garden. They thoroughly un
derstand that if the Rea crop of politi
cal weeds is exterminated root and
branch a new growth will start that
will eventually place San Jose where
she rightfully belongs.
The people of San Jose fully realize
that when the cause of good govern
ment wins on next Monday by the elec
tion of the entire New Charter Club
ticket, that important fact will be her
alded throughout the land, even more
conspicuously than anything that has
been published heretofore in connection
with San Jose. They know that the
announcement of the defeat of Boss
Rea will convey to intending Investors
and home-seekers the information that
the reign of corruption and extrava
gance for San Jose Is over; that politi
cal blackmail and high taxation are
things of the past; that the terrors of
the "gang's" boycott will no longer re
strain free speech; that it will be pos
sible to engage in business in San Joee
without paying tribute or doing hom
age to the boss or any of his henchmen.

When there is any particularly mean
job or political chicanery to be done
the man selected by the boss to do it
is Johnnie Mackenzie. In the present
campaign he has made himself particu
larly obnoxious. In one instance at
least that has come to the knowledge
of The Call correspondent that his tor
tuous methods have alienated the votes
of at least a half dozen citizens and
caused these men to become earnest
and indefatigable workers in the cause
of the New Charter Club ticket.
"He told lies of me and mine," said
the gentleman principally concerned in
one of the outrages perpetrated by
Mackenzie, "and as a result my three
sons, two sons-in-law and myself, who
A WHOLE MAN
That is one of the tales that you often hear, but you - very seldom see in real life. A whole
man is one whose strength has not been depleted in any way. How many such men are there
in the whole circle of your acquaintances? You cannot truly say that you are a great, a strong
and a perfect specimen of manhood, now can you ? Those little specks that you see before
your eyes, that weak and "done-up" feeling that you have, that disinclination for work and
those clammy night-sweats that produce a gloomy feeling, all go to show that you are any-
thing but a man full of vim, fire and vigor. You know as well as you can be told what grand
manhood is. It brings that full and entire satisfaction that is joy in itself; it makes life a
pleasure ; it brings that sense of delight which all men have when they have the strength, the
vigor and the vitality of youth. Why is this feeling not yours? It is because you have trans-
gressed some natural law. You have put tasks on your brain that were too heavy for it ; or
perhaps you have tried to do the work of two men and failed. In any event you have abused
some one of the functions 'which were yours to use, not to abuse. You can repair the whole
of the injury you have done your system if you will try in earnest. There is one way in which
you can do this, and one alone. If you do try in a month you will*be a different creature.
Even your most intimate friends will scarcely know you. But you must make a small effort.
"Hudyan," the great specific of the Hudsonian Institute, is the one thing in the whole world that
will restore to you your lost power. It.is the one thing that will make a full-powered man of
you again. It will do it certainly and swiftly. Your system now is suffering from drains that
are wasting your vitality. "Hudyan" will stop all drains in a week.
â ..;. There are testimonials at the Institute from 20,000 men who have been cured. If you can call at the
Institute you will be shown what they have to say. If you cannot call, write, and free of all cost copies will at once be
. forwarded you. Circulars will be sent you, too, showing what "Hudyan" can really accomplish. The whole world
uses "Hudyan," and it has been a perfect godsend to hundreds of men who were worse than you are to-day.

LONDON, April 9.â lf anything was
â \ to confl â¢ the European belief
that tbe Cuban crisis had reached an
Impasse, from which there is no issue
but war, or the haulmg 1 down of the !
Spanish flaÂ£, ; has been found in
President McKinley's replr to the Em
bassadoriaJ note, presentee 1 , in Wash- '
Ington on Thursday last, so strikingly
reasserting the determination that
there is only one way to prevent the
United States intervening to end the
Intolerable situation. '- a matter of
fact ,10 confirmation was wanted, for
Europe's real hope of a peaceful solu
tion of the question was based upon the
belief that when they realized the fu
tility of the high-strung talk about
their honor the Spaniards would accept
the alternative or surrende â  The Em
bassadorial appeal at Washington was
regarded as an obvious formality. The â¢
British officials' v *w of th" matter is
that the occasion is or- of the sole ex
ercise of American discretion and that
the American attitude towart" Cuba is
the same as any other â¢ ivilized and
self-respecting government would have
under similar circumstances.
Practically the whole of this coun- -
try takes the same view of the case.
<lreat Britain has nothing to thank
Spain for. Whenever commercial ques
tions have been raised Great Britain
has found Spain obstructive, intractable
and arbitrary, as the United States
finds her to-aay, and the modicum of I
sympathy found in some quarters is j
simply a sort of sentimental pity at the
fact that Spain should be depri\ - ed of
her last great colony. One of the few
discordant not Â»s in the pean of sym- j
pathy with the aims of the United j
States comes from r. quarter it was
least exDeoted from. The Freeman's
Journal, the organ of the Irish Nation
attst leader, John Dillon, a paper
claiming to represent the Irish party, ,
after flat-footedly expressing the hope
that Spain will win in the expected
war, asks "Is there a nation In the
v.-.tM which could brook the Insults
leveled at the Spaniards In the Ameri- j
can press or which would not protest
against the stand-and-dellver policy
adopted?"
In conclusion, the Freeman's Journal
remarks: "In our opinion the United :
States would be better employed help- '
ing Spain to make autonomy a success
nither than in forcing a deplorable
war. The latest advices show the
Americans do not want to deliver Cuba
to the Cubans."
The Irish Independent League has
protested against this pro-Spanish
declaration, and has passed a resolu
tion of sympathy with the United
Btates, repudiating: with scorn and in
dignation the declaration of the Free
man's Journal.
The resolutions adopted by the New
,J""'"k Chamber of Commerce at its re
cent meeting are regarded as highly
Important factors of the situation, and
as giving the approval of business men
to the war policy.
During the course of a conversation, i
a hish official of the British Foreign
Office said: "The certain difficulties)
an.] possible dangers which the United !
Btates is inviting by its attitude, be
sides thÂ«> vast cost and the disquieting
uncertainties <>f war itself, all of which
could be avoided by a policy of indif
ference, shows the single-mindedness
of tho American aims, and constitute
an irresistible claim on the sympa
thies of other nations, for the assured '
losses are not counterbalanced by any i
prospect of gain. The President's pol- '
icy is Btatesmanlike and essentially
humane, and while we may view ap
prehenslvely the ultimat results to
America herself in the necessity for
introducing order in the government of
Cuba, the solution of the insufferable
scandal will n<>t be too dearly pur
chased at the cost of war. The malefi
cent rule of Spain in Cuba has got to
end now, for neither America nor any
one else will trust her promises, so
often broken, especially after the ten
tale correspondence which resulted in
thf recall of Senor Dupuy de Lome.
"Nevertheless," added the foreign
official, "America has taken up an un
enviable task. 2 fter driving out the
Spaniards, she will have to send troops
to crush the Cubans, -who are rebels at
heart, and who will not submit tamely
to any form of Government which will
deprive them of their occupation of
fighting."
There is much interest here in the
privateering aspect of the expected
hostilities, and the experts of the Ala
bamae on l><>th sides will be eagerly
followed. It is hoped that the adven
tur-s resulting will lead the United
States and Spain to sign the declara
tion of Paris. The general impression is
that the prospective combatants, while
issuing letters of marque, will request
neutral goods on their enemy's ships
and goods on board neutral ships.
There is considerable fear that Eu
rope^ supply of wheat and cotton will
be seriously affected In the case of hos
tilities, although it Is believed that un
less the attempted blockades of ports
are absolutely effective, the neutrals
v.-ill not respect them, and it is appre
hended that this aspect of the war will
lead to ticklish international questions
which may involve the combatants In
heated disputes with Europe.

SAN QUENTIN PRISON. April 9.â
The Board of State Prison Directors
met here to-day and with a full board
present accomplished considerable im
portant work. Chairman Robert Fitz
gerald called the meeting to order.
In discussion In regard to the pros
pects for a demand for sacks it was
shown that the demand this year had
been unusually light, only 359,000 sacks
having been ordered up to date, while
at this time a year ago orders for
3,418,000 sacks had been received. The
outlook for a heavy sale was doubtful,
as the crop reports were anything but
encouraging.

On the Ist day of April I counted the

the cash belonging to the prisoners, and
I found both amounts correct. I have
checked the quarterly report with the
cashbook, and I am pleased to report that
every dollar collected is properly account
ed for by vouchers on file and cash in the
vault. I have checked all entries from
cashbook and journal to the ledger,
checked out trial balances of the prison
books, also the prison ledgers, and find
everything correct.

Warden Hale reported that there
were on hand 6500 imperfect bags and
at least three and a half tons of waste.
He was authorized to sell the bags at
a price not less than 4V* cents each,
and the waste for what It would bring.
The Warden estimated that the latter
would bring .00V4 per pound.
The Warden reported three deaths of
convicts since the last meeting of the
board at San Quentln â two by con
sumption and one by hanging. The lat
ter was Benjamin L. Hill, who paid
the penalty for the murder of his wife.
Mary E. Martin, the notorious de
fendant in the case that excited wide
spread interest throughout the State
at the time of her trial r obtaining
money under false pretenses, is dying
in the women's -ward of the peniten
tiary from tumor of the stomach. For
months the woman has b ?n unable to
leave her bed. The Prison Directors
to-day recommended har pardon, to
take effect on the 20th o" the present
month.
Mrs. Martin made the acquaintance
of Miss Leonard of Oakland, who un
fortunately was not strong mentally,
but possessed property of the value of
?14,000. Mrs. Martin made a proposi
tion to Miss Leonard that if she would
transfer the property to her she would
agree to care for Miss Leonard for the
remainder of her life. Miss Leonard's
feelings were played upon and she
finally consented and a contract was
drawn up by Mrs. Martin to that ef
fect. After the property was trans
ferred Mrs. Martin went back on the
agreement, and Miss Leonard was
without means to provide for herself.
Mrs. Martin was found guilty of ob
taining money under false pretenses
and sentenced to ten j r ears' imprison
ment.
Walter R. Lambert, serving five

present conditions the water flows into
the Yolo basin when the river has reached
the nine-foot mark. Under the new
scheme, the water will reach the twenty
foot mark at the foot of X street. Sacra
mento, before the overflow at the weirs will
commence. The success of the venture is
clue to the interest taken by the Sacra
mento Chamber of Commerce, together
with the encouragement and financial aid
contributed by L.c fanners of Yolo who
own lands adjacent to the territory to be
benefited by the construction of weirs.
The plans provide for weirs 2000 feet
wide, 13 feet in width, and to cost be
tween $20,000 and $25.u00.

PASSING Of AN OPPORTUNITY.
THE nearer comes the opening day of the Trans-
Mississippi Exposition the more evident is the
bet that in not having provided for an exhibit
there California has made a mistake. Perhaps it is
even now not too late. Much could be done between
this time and the Ist of June, when the doors are to
open. The exposition at Omaha is to be more ex
tensive than there has been held in this country,
with the single exception of the Columbian affair.
The buildings now approaching completion are large
and artistic and arc to house products of science, art
and industry from all over the world. It is worth re
mark that the affair ;vas originated at a Trans-
Mississippi Congress at which a California^ pre
sided, and that there was present a strong and en
thusiastic California;-. delegation.
In the preliminary work the people of Omaha and
Nebraska have shown remarkable rest and gener
osity, and their spirit has infected all the States with
the exception of the one capable of making the finest
display of any. There are two things to be consid
ered. It is as necessary to have a domestic market as
a foreign one. and visitors from ever)- part of the
country ariS be at Omaha by the thousands during
the six months the exposition is to be under way.
Furthermore; California intends soon to have an ex
position on a magnificent scale. The merest recog
nition of the benefits of reciprocity ought to cause
liberal treatment of Nebraska. The money expended
and the good will shown would bring rich returns.
The managers desire that if nothing more ! -. done
Commissioners be appointed from this State and
private exhibits be forwarded It certainly se-nis
strange thct among the States invited o participate
CaUiomta should be the only one to refuse.
THE JURY-BOX SCANDAL.
jj â I ROM the present outlook it appears improb-
I able that we shan ever discover the parties who
were responsible for putting the three bogus
slips into the jury-box in Judge Hunt's court. The
expert who examined the penmanship of the slips and
compared it with that of the various deputies who
copy the names furnished by the Judges for jurymen
has satisfied himself that none of them wrote the
fraudulent slips. For the present, therefore, the in
vestigation is blocked, and perhaps nothing but a for
tunate accident hardly to be expected will ever af
ford evidence, as to the criminal.
In this situation Judge Hunt proposes a new sys
tem of making up the lists and the establishment of a
check against a repetition of the onense. The plan
is a simple one. As stated by him to a representa
tive of The Call, it consists in a rule requiring that all
names for jurymen be copied by not more than two
deputies, and that each slip shall be signed by the
deputy who copied it. In that way. as the Judge
says, it anything goes wrong it will be easy to trace
the cause of it. There will be a personal'responsi
bility on the part of the deputies signing the slips,
and such responsibility nearly always results in mak
ing careless people careful and scheming people
honest.
We directed attention a few days acre to a plan pro
posed by Mr. Shannahan for accomplishing the same
purpose as that aimed at by Jcdge Hur.t. Which of
the two remedies will Kr>t <nit the need of the occa
sion is for the Judges to decide. The pabiic will be
satisfied with anything which secures honesty in the
future, bat will continue to hope that the court, its
officials and the detective force of the city will not
forget the offense already committed, but keep a
watch for some disclosures that will lead to the ar
rest and conviction of the criminal who. without the
knowledge of the court, the clerk or any of the dep
uties, managed to get at the jury-box and stuff the
lists according to his fancy.

SPANISH RETROGRESSION.
HP" HE reported remarks of the Spanish War Mm-
I ister introduce an opera bouflfe feature as a pre
* lade to the tragedy that is to follow-. He fer
vently wished that Spain had not a warship afloat,'
for then none would have to strike her flag to the
United State?. However, as she has some ships, he
suggests that they be blown up by their crews.
This morbid expression is the outcome ef cen
turies of folly and bad government. Europe to-day is
not the EttrofM of Phillip 11. Kvery advance in edu
cation and every extension ot popular freedom and
human rights thai has taken place in the last three
centuries rotn.ius in some form the sting of Spain's
opposition. She has stood fast by the old order.
Glutted with the spoils of America, her people at
home neglected the preservation of her industries and
her commerce, until, when her American Pactolus
ran dry. they had largely lost the capacity to thrive
by the industrial arts. Her forests had been wasted,
her streams lost their waters, her soils failed in 'fer
tility, and her enterprising tons were driven into
strange countries to seek the larger opportunities of
life which had failed at home.
Centuries of war for revenge, for dynastic ambition,
for the purpose of feeding a foolish military pride,
have left their mark on the Mature and strength of
her people. Neglectful of reinstatement of home in
dustries, wasteful in her financial methods, unwise in
taxation and prodigal in expenditure, she has for
years come to depend on the revenues wrung from
Cuba and the Philippines. With characteristic im
providence she has returned bad govf rnment and op
pression in those islands for the millions they have
yielded to her. Compared with her nile in her colo-
nies, that of Turkey in Egypt was benevolent. Roman
politicians who secured a province might oppress its
people and overtax their substance, but the oppressed
had a hearing before the Senate. Rome produced a
Verres. but raised also a Cicero to pursue him. Spain
has put her colonies under tyrants who added their
own to the exactions of the home Government, but
she has never questioned nor impeached them. In
her colonial possessions her policy left to the people
only the recourse of assassination or revolution.
Timely concessions were refused. A degree of par
ticipation in their affairs that would have confirmed
the loyalty of her colonists was scouted. They must
put their necks under the heel of the Governor-
General she sent and see him absorb their substance.
until, gorged like a condor, he took flight to make
room for another hungry bird of prey.
It is no wonder that such a policy has isolated her
in Europe, where modern progress looks upon her
as an enemy, and has turned against her the hands
of her own sons. Unwise and wasteful in her day of
power and prosperity, when her splendors dazzled
the world, and unable to support adversity with
philosophy and patience, atrursst the bloody and bril
liant background of her high and mighty past is
cast the shadow of her pitiful decay. It is a far cry
from the Cid Campeador to a War Minister who
prefers to blow up her ships rather than face an
enemy and fight.
A MARKET-STREET SEWER.
,*""! N esteemed morning contemporary, which has
\ resisted all our efforts to convince it that it
* is not good business policy to repave Market
street prior to the construction of a main sewer, now
launches the argument that if a new pavement is laid
it will be worn out long beiore the authorities get
around to the adoption of a sewer system. This
may be questioned. But even if admitted it does not
alter the force of the reasons we have given for im
proving Market street according to accepted j
business methods. A bituminous pavement on that
thoroughfare, if laid in defiance of burrowing corpor
ations and sewer builders, will never have a chance
to wear out. It will be destroyed by them long be
fore its time,
â¢ We think in assigning ten years as the life of â¢
bituminous pavements on business streets our con
temporary rr.akes a careless estimate. The concrete
base practically never wears out. Golden Gate
avcr.r.e was paved in ISSS and has since been sub
jected to the heaviest of traffic. Yet with scarcely
any repairs at all most of the blocks are still in pretty
<:ood order. Xor was the bitumen on this avenue
laid on concrete. The street was paved with mac
adam under an art of the Legislature, and the
bitumen was spread upon the bed of broken rock
prepared for that material. Experts at the time
declared that this foundation would "crawl" and
prove a delusion. Stili after thirteen years of wear
and tear the street is in fairly good order.
The truth of the matter is. if Market street is prop
erly paved and given careful attention afterward the
bitumen ought not to wear out at aIL A proper sys
tem of repairs should keep it in order indefinitely.
Bet no system of repairs can protect a highway from
the digging of the water, gas, telephone and side
sewer vandals. Even if it were possible to build a
main sewer m Market street without tearing it vp â
which is a Chinese dream of most incoherent char
acter â there would be no saving the pavement from
these individuals.
If a sewer is ever built in Market street it ought to
be a ten or twelve foot affair, capabie of carrying off
all the water flowing from the hills on the north and
the fiats on the south. Such a drain should also pro
vide a conduit for pipes and wires and dispose for
ever of the burrowing corporations. Our contempor
ary may think that the construction of an intercept
ing sewer such as this is a holiday affair or that it
would but slightiy disturb the serenity of the bitum
inous pavement for which it is now sighing. Bat
that thought is another Mongolian vision. Nothing
would be left of the street after such a Â»ewer was
completed.
There is but one businesslike way for improving
Market street, ar.d that iÂ« to build a sewer first and
then put down a permanent paveftent and ukÂ« care
of it afterward.

uncomfortable qualm, and In the mind the rlsien ef
a dead form bearing the marks ef riolence. 5e ser
row may be put en the programme as a regular thing.
A murderer devoid ef it could hardly contribute to
the smoothness of a first-class execution. And then
not to feel ill will is the proper course. There really
does not appear any good reason why an assassin
should cherish a disregard for society he had out
raged and which is simply meting cut to him the
penalty he deliberately incurred.
These stereotyped accounts of hangings should be
revised. They go into unnecessary detail. Let the
public take for granted the whole scheme of sorrow,
resignation and forgiveness. The story gets as fam
iliar as that of the suicide who performs a "rash"
not "while laboring under a fit of despo.idency," in
variably using "a cheap pattern of bulldog pistol of
38 caliber."
THE ICE-BOUND WHALERS.
NEWS brought from the Arctic by Third Mate
Tilton of the whaling steamer Belvedere 6trik-
Ingb/ confirms the wisdom of the Government
in dispatching a relief expedition as soon as the peril
ous condition of the whaling fleet was made known.
Thanks' to the promptness with which the expedition
was started, there is reason for the hope that it will
reach the whalers in time to save them from the
destitution and starvation that threaten.
Mr. Tilton states that after the fleet had become ice
bound an inventory of the supplies of all the ships
was taken and it was found that by allowing two
scant meals a day to each man the provisions might
be made to last up to July i. Unless relief was ob
tained before that time the result would be another
of those tragedies of the Arctic in which brave men,
exhausted by lack of food and numbed by the fear
ful cold of the imprisoning ice and snow, lie down
amid the frozen wastes to sleep the sleep that knows
no waking.
So certain was the impending danger, so sure the
doom of the crews, that it was determined to risk one
life in the hazardous attempt to force a way across
the desolation of the north to seek relief. Mr. Til
ton volunteered to make the journey and succeeded
in performing the unprecedented feat of crossing
from Point Barrow to civilization in midwinter. He
arrived to find that his venture had been forestalled;
that American humanity had already dispatched re
lief for the fleet. Xone the less, however, does he
deserve praise for his achievement. He performed
a dangerous duty for his fellow-men courageously
and well, and the worth of the fea. is not diminished
by the fact that the relief he sought had been dis
patched long before he arrived to ask it
With the coming of this news The Call finds a new
gratification in the fact that it was the first to direct
attention to the peril of the whaling fleet, and was not
cr.'.y :r.strumental in inducing the Government to
send a relief expedition, but contributed liberally and
largely in the way of supplies to make it a success.
This is clearly a case where needed help was given in
time. Unless some obstacle insuperable by human
energy stops the relieving expedition, the ice-bound
sailors will be saved ere long from the danger that
threatens, and their scant allowance of two poor
meals a day will be changed to the aburdance of
nourishing food needed to support life and strength
in the ordeal of the Arctic winter.
OPEN PORTS IN CHINA.
|~) ALFOUR'S speech in the Comr-.ons on Tues-
Dday night was the funest and clearest utterance
that has yet been given by the British Ministry
on the situation in China and the attitude taken by
Great Britain toward the recent aggressions of Rus
sia. As was to have been expected, Balfour claims a
complete victory for British diplomacy, and after
making every allowance for the inevitable exaggera
tion of a party leader defending party achievements,
it appears he has good reasons for his claim.
According to BaJfour Great Britain has obtained
'from China four important concessions. The Chinese
Government agrees that the vast and populous re
gion of the Yang-tse-Kiar.g shall never be alienated
to a foreign power, that the director of the Chinese
imperial customs shall be an Englishman, that access
to the inland waters of China shall be free on equal
terms to the ships of all nations, and that three new
treat)- ports â Funing, Yochau and Chin Wang â shall
be open to commerce. These concessions, if main
tained with firmness, will constitute an effective bar
rier against excessive Russian domination in China,
and Mr. Balfour justly pronounced them "'a consider
able harvest for two months' negotiations."
AH of these concessions, with the exception of that
granting the control of imperial customs to an Eng
lishman, are of as much value to other nations as to
Great Britain herself. They are certainly of value to the
United States, and particularly so to the Pacific Coast.
They secure to us a freedom of trade with China and
give us a chance to expand our commerce there on
the same terms with other peoples, and how impor
tant that commerce may be is now rapidly becoming
understood throughout the country.
In view of the fact that these concessions have
been obtained avowedly as an offset to Russian move
ments and may be regarded with hostility by that
country, it is interesting to consider the prospects of
their maintenance. It is one thing to gain advan
tages by diplomacy, but quite a different one to up
hold them at the risk and peril of war. Accordingly
the question arises at once: Will Great Britain stand
firm if Russia should continue to advance under a
threat of war and should be joined in the threat by
Germany?
Balfocr did not directly answer that question, but
certain portions of his speech show what the answer
will when the time comes to make it. He stated
that* the Russian Government having refused to ah-"
â¢tain from taking Port Arthur, Great Britain has de
cided to take the port of Wei-Hai-Wei and fortify it
at I a means cf preventing the Gulf of Pechili from
falling . under the maritime control of "one power."
Here, then, iÂ» an advanced position taken at the otrt- ;
â¢et, and the significance of it cannot fail to bY under
stood, The British flag once hoUted on strong for
tifications at Wei'Hai-Wci will not ; be hauled down
without battle, )â â ...â .â  '_ ; , ': :: â :"â  v. 'â '['__ ;;;..-- V; -
It is to be noted, moreover, that Balfeur does not
expect Great Britain will have to fight alone the war
for free ports In China. He declared an earnest con
vietien that the great commercial showers will Join' la
an alliance to prevent China failing a prey to aaÂ£e*= ;j

WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
Probablr the editor of the Tracy
Weekly Press meant all right when he
made his tyjw to the public unil.r
something he was pleased to term a
"Valedictory." There is. however, a
difference between a valedictory and a
salutatory; According to my dim recol
lection of Latin, 'vale" means about
the same as farewell, and the connec
tion It sustains with valedictory Is not
difficult to detect.

It is painful to observe that two
women are quarreling over the body
of the late John S. Enos. It appears
that while animated by the spark c/f
life Enos had been married to onÂ« of
them and had loved the other, to the
scandal of the county of Sonoma,
where this sort of business is properly
frowned upon. The body haÂ« been
consigned to a tomb, but 1b liable to
being snatched out at any moment, an
unpleasant possibility from which
neither litigant can derive much Joy.
I would humbly BUgrgrest a compromise.
Let the coveted remains be cremated
in the presence of witnesses. Then,
with the assistance of a pair of scales,
the ashes may be equally drided.
Thereafter they may, duly urned, be
deck the whatnot in each of the be
reaved households, or, scattered at the
base of a rtoebush. prove efficacious in
enriching the soil or discouraging the

-I am forced to admit that while the
, HeaJdsburg lady who has written on
j the "Battle-ship Maine" is a patriot
: and fit to be the mother of patriots,
she is the author of the worst verse
, that has come to my notice. I would
; not, however, speak lightly of her ef
fort. The theme is one which touches
us all. It is given to few to write
poetry, and yet the impulse to say
; something has stirred the common
heart, and the inclination to say it in
rhyme simply indicates a desire to
say it in the most striking way. I even
refrain from quoting from the Healds
burg effort, and there is no method by
which I could better express esteem.
I would advise the lady not to try to
manufacture poetry. This is in all
kindness. In seeking revenge for the
wrecking of the Maine and the slaught
er of her men the usages of civilized
warfare do not permit the employment
of anything more deadly than cannon.
Once more a painful rumor reaches
me that two Hearstlings intend slap
ping me the first time the pair have
together the joy of opportunity. With
out any desire to evade hardship. I
would suggest that they change their
minds. I do not think either one of the
pair would make a good angel.

The merit of having descended from
somebody is doubtless great, but it
fails to impress me. The matter of pos
terity is really of more importance. No
. man can with justice be held respon
sible for his great-grandfather, and
there is no reason why he should
cherish a warm regard, or. indeed,
anything but the utmost indifference for
a gentleman, worthy enough erhaps
while living, but uninteresting when re
solved to a handful of dust. Of course
if the old gentleman accomplished
more than to- pave the way for having
a great-grandson, if he writ his name
large on the pages of history, if he
liberated a nation, formulated a benign
law. made a good book or invented a
way of utilizing steam, for the great
grandson to feel a pride, and to be
fired by an ambition to do a thing or
two himself, is natural. But in all
probability the great-grandfather was
an ordinary mortal, who plodded
through life in eager quest for money,
ar.d at last died with a keen sense of
disappointment at not having got more
of it. Whatever he did he never looked
forward to the glad time when a great
grandson of his would be prinking un
der the shadow of family tree, elate
at being alive, conscious that others of
the same name h&d been alive Lefore
him. I observe the formation of a
genealogical society here. To look back
over the path trodden by generations
which. have passed away is interesting.
It is a matter of history concerning the
individual, but I do not see what the
purpose of a society may be. If a man
has a family tree he can trace it out
himself. If he has none and wants one
he can buy it grafted to.fruitfulness by
stolen branches. If he happens to pos
sess one of which he is ashamed, or
concerning which he is doubtful,
he would object to having it peeped at
by the other members of the society.
Perhaps, however, by concerted Inves
tigation the research can- be extended
beyond the usual limit, and the student
of ancestry trace his line' to the monkey,
and even" learn whether that from
which he sprang was of the arÂ» ?al
variety, delighting to swing by pr hen-

PRINCETON, N. J.. Feb. 28. 1893.
To W, R. Hearst. New York Journal.
New York: I decline to allow my sorrow
for those who died on the Maine to be
perverted to an advertising srhtrac lor
the New York Journal.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
In these few words was Editor Hearst
Informed that the unspeakable effront
ery of making capital out of brave men
dead and eminent men living would be
denied the connivance of an ex-Presi
dent. I honor the citizen who sent the
reply. He might have passed unnoticed
the Insulting message which had asked
him to become party to a fraud, or to
have saved himself from the certainty
of future abuse, permitted the use of
his name on the "committee." But he
took the trouble to answer. The an
swer was deserved, complete, fitting; it
could not have been better. Hearst has
a scheme for erecting a monument to
his own glory. He desires that the
memory of the brand of patriotism he
keeps in stock be perpetuated in stone,
and that the public pay for the stone.
To excite a general interest he has an
nounced the prospective shaft as de
signed to be to the sailors of the Maine;
also that collectors of contributions are
entitled to a rake-off of 10 p*er ccn J To
this palpable pretense, either through
fear or thoughtlessness, some persons
of standing have loaned their names.
Mr. Cleveland had the wisdom to de
cline, being neither foolish nor afraid.
This trick of the Journal's is one of the
lowest it has undertaken in ail its
career of infamy. If that paper is to
it must be regarded
as a type of the greatest evil now
threatening this country- It is more
dangerous than war, more deadly
than pestilence. Before its be
smearing assault no reputation is
safe, Â«o privacy sacred, no canon in
violate. So open in its lies, so brazen
in its meddling, and the laudation of its
intrinsic foulness; so calm in its as
sumption that the people are unclean
creatures, delighting in the odor of the
sewer or capering joyously on the gar
bage heap, it has already created a
false and damaging impression. As a
matter of fact, the people despise it-
They do not believe a word it says.
They cannot think any cause it advo
cates has in it aught of g d. They
may in instances fear it as a person of
breeding would dread an encounter
with a fish wife. It has brought upon
journalism in general an unmerited
opprobrium. Disgus.ed with its flaunt
ing lies, its stupid fakes, its pretended
interviews, its counterfeit virtue, its
noisome yearning for notoriety, read
ers may sometimes mis* ke it for a
sample of the daily paper. It is a sam
ple of nothing but filth: its methods
vulgar, its ambitions vile. As justly
might the women of the land be judged
by the scarlet outcast unblushing un
der her badge of shame. There is no
hope for the Journal while Hearst lives
and his money lasts. He sinks deeper
into the mire to which instinct has led
him. and wherein it is his happiness to
wallow, spattering any who incau
tiously approach. He has no moral
sense to which appeal : ay be made,
and would spurn the hand extended to
lift him to a decent level. But I can
not believe the Journal ~? to be per
manent. For the nonce it attracts at
tention, but so does any other malign
freak exhibited by a showman com
petent as a "spieler." Mr. Cleveland
did well. He has secured a new hold
upon his friends by adding to the list
of his active enemies this r.-n Hearst,
whose presence in journalism is a re
proach to public sentiment and a dis
grace to others who, in following a
calling which has every right to be
honorable, must in some measure be
regarded as his associates.

A man named Groezinper has been
sitting on the bench of Police Judge
Campbell â while the latter jurist is

Campbell, lightly and Irreverently, that

this paper from the doorsteps of sub
scribers, their unholy act desecrating

Groezinger I would have called the act
stealing and the actor a thief. This
eminent authority, however, decides
that a newspaper on a subscriber's
doorstep Is not property. It has passed
from the possession of the publisher
and not into the possession of anybody
else. Therefore by the terms of the

I am accused of having replied in
258 words to an indictment or ten
words. It is added that the answer as
made up of epithets. There are several
points about this which are incorrect.
In the first place the ten words consti
tuted neither an indictment nor an In
formation. They simply afforded a text
for a dissertation upon a particular
style of ass to which the author of them
clearly belonged, and, far from being
abusive, the .; dissertation contained
nothing more violent than a delicate in
timation tending to gently and con
siderately place the author aforesaid in
his class. Yet I confess his return for
this courtesy gives me a new impres
sion of his intelligence. He can count
correctly the words in forty lines of
type V . â¢/;.â¢ ?
One who. from some feeling whicli
seems to him to modesty, hides be
hind a fictitious name, cannot reason
ably expect serious notice. Yet I will
do a specimen of this sort the honor
to call attention to an irritating weak
ness of his, manifest in a tendency to
correct the English of others and em
ploy bad English himself. He would
better, with a view of improving hi*
own style, read the -work of Emanuel-
Elzas appearing in this paper, than do
it with the idea that Mr. Elzas needs
to take lessons from him. In the pen
product of the anonymous person in
question there are grievous errors al
ways, so bald and distressing that a
child might perceive them. "I object,"
affirms this authority, "to the 1 word
'subjugate' in the sense of 'subordi
nate.' " Why? A gentleman of literary,
repute, by name Longfellow, onca
translated the "Inferno." and in doing
so made bold to employ the following
expression:
I understood that unto enco a torment
The carnal malefactors were condemned
â Who reason subjugate to appetite.
But it is to be charitably remembered
that Longfellow lacked the advantage
of basking in the peculiar mentality
which essays to shed light upon Elias
and the rest of us and fails through,
having no light to shed. In the same
scathing paragraph of the carper oc
curs the phrase: "It Is only when
such writers â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ misuses the
Queen's English." To fall into the ex
pressive methods of the unknown I
might add that such writers do not, as
a rule, misuses.

TO THE
PUBLIC!
I wish to call to your attention that j
I have the largest and most select ;
stock of woolens and Â» offer to make i
suits to order at 25 per cent less than
the price for which you could get the
same quality of goods elsewhere.
Every good, patriotic Califoroian should
patronize a firm that gets the work
made by white labor here in this city,
and that is what the firm of JOE
POHEIM does.
The firm employs all the way from
100 to 300 workmen steady at a fair, j
good salary. We are making suits to
order for $12, 515, $17 50 and $20. One-
third of this is paid out for labor done
here, and as that money is spent here
by our workmen, every customer de-
rives an indirect benefit from it; where-
as if you buy ready-made clothing you
are simply boycotting the workmen of
this State, as the ready-made clothing
is all made in the East or in Chinatown
and the money paid for labor is sent
East, instead of being spent here. We :
also make broadcloth, French pique,
beavers and the best English diagonals
to order for $25, $30, 535 and $40 to $50.
These are suits that would cost you at
a high-priced tailor at least from 25 to
40 per cent more. The question may be '
asked why this firm should sell so much
cheaper than other firms, "The reason
la very simple. First, we buy woolens ,
in large quantities at reduced prices; '
secondly, we must and do make quick
sales at a small profit. "While high-
priced tailors sell one suit we sell five, j
A professional man, a doctor, lawyer,
clergyman and a teacher can have a
dressy suit made to order of diagonal,
pique, beaver, broadcloth or doeskin
for $25 to $35, which will look and wear
as well as any suit from a high-priced
tailor for which you would have to pay
$60. We make a specialty of $25, $30
and $35 suits, and give you fine value
for the money. For a man who cannot
pay from $20 to $35 we can make an ex-
traordinarily good suit for $12, $15, |
$17 50, which beats any ready-made
suit. This suit will be cut in style, and
the money paid for the labor will be
spent here. So if we make you a fine
suit for $12 to $17 50 you can readily :
s?e that we will give you the best suit
in the country for $35.
We carry the finest goods, and you '
can have the privilege of picking out
your goods at the cloth-houses and we
will make your suit just as reasonable. \
Some say that the people in the East
are better dressed than the people in
California. Why? Because they get
their clothes made to order. If a work-
man in the East cannot pay $35 for a
suit he gets one made to order for $10
or $15, and it fits him, is cut in style
and gives the working people employ-
ment where the suit is made. They
don't import clothing from California
made by Chinese, if the Californians
would patronize home industry the
times would be better on this coast.
The firm of JOE POHEIM has always
made it a point to buy HERE all goods
that can be bought on as reasonable a
basis as in the East, so as to give the
preference to home industry. This firm
possesses the good will of the public
and has for the last twenty-three years
done the largest merchant tailoring
business on the Pacific Coast.
~ We always treat you well, give you
the most for your money and keep
your clothes in repair free of charge.

JAPANESE
COMPLAIN OF
MR. NORTH
Their Minister Makes
an Unfounded
Charge.
Alleges That His People
Are Discriminated
Against.
Commissioner Roberts of Phila
delphia Sent Hither to
Investigate.
â â >*
CONTRACT LABOR AGENTS, j
They Have Misrepresented Matters
and Commissioner North Makes
a Vigorous Denial.
The Japanese Minister at "Washington '
has made complaint to the Government ;
against Immigration Commissioner North, I
accusing him of demanding a higher â¢â 
standard of qualifications for Japanese
attempting to land in this country tnan
is prescribed for immigrants of other na
tionalities.
These representations were made to the
Minister by certain Japanese contract
labor agents in this city, one or two of
whom have been mixed up in disreputable
transactions connected with both suc
cessful and frustrated attempts to land
contract laborers in droves. They have
represented that white immigrants are al
lowed to land upon their bare statements,
while the Japanese are haled before the
special board of inquiry and put through
a stringent process of cross-examination,
being treated like persons suspected of
being criminals rather than industrious
and honest citizens of a friendly nation.
As a result of the complaint of the
Japanese Minister, the Secretary of the
I Treasury has dispatched to this city j
< United States Immigration Commissioner \
Roberts of Philadelphia, and has request- '
ed United States immigration Commits- ;
sioner Rice of Victoria, B. C, to co-op- j
, crate with Commissioners Roberts and
North in examining into and reporting
upon the procedure followed by tne lm- I
, migration Bureau in this city.
It will be remembered that a few weeks :
ago Comnyssioner North examined a
batch of Japanese laborers who had ar
rived by way of Victoria. They were
part of a gang of Japs to which Mr.
North had refused a landing, the evidence ;
being clear that they were contract la- :
borers. The Victoria people had been i
permitted to land by Mr. Rice.
This apparent laxity on the part of Mr.
Rice gave rise to murmuring among the
owners of transportation lines operated ;
between San Francisco and Japan. They
said that if the door was to be thrown
wide open at Victoria and double-locked
at San Francisco there could be but one
result, and that would be to turn the cur
rent of Japanese travel to Victoria and
to give San Francisco the go-by. Mr. ;
Rice was notified shortly afterward by i
' the Secretary of the Treasury and the
i Commissioner-General of Immigration
that he would afford pleasure to the ad
ministration and would put a stop to the
i complaints if he would study the plan i
I pursued by Mr. North and if he and Mr.
I North would mutually agree upon a uni
form course in such matters.
Commissioner North yesterday de
nounced as false the charge that he had
i applied one rule to Japanese and another â 
: rule to white immigrants. White immi- :
( grants came hither with their families j
and told straight stories as to their in- i
| tention of making the United States their '
home. There was no evidence whatever I
that they were coming as contract la
borers. On the other hand, Mr. North j
! had been obliged to refuse a landing to ]
j squads of Japanese, young men who ar
rived with $30 in their pockets and were I
dressed in the same lot of European I
clothing obtained from the same estab
i lishment in Yokohama, and some of them j
being found with contract labor certi- j
j ficates on their persons. They could not
I tell a straight story, but lied and con- |
I tradicted themselves at every turn. For
I those reasons they had been denied a !
landing, and white persons under the j
same circumstances and telling the same '
\ improbable yarns would have been cx
i eluded as well.

The other day an old fellow, charged
with grand larceny, was on trial in one
of our Superior

had become so full that they could not
bend over without spilling. In this con
dition they separated and the Briton went
to bed, where he slept off the effects of
his debauch, arising in the morning to
discover that he had a big head and $60
less than he counted upon. He at once
Jumped to the conclusion that his com.
panion of the evening before had "touch
ed" him, so, after hunting up a drug
store to get something for his nerves, he
hunted up a detective and had the fel
low arrested and employed special coun
sel. In the person of a little shyster, to
prosecute him.
As the evidence proceeded it proved
more and more that the poor old fellow
was as Innocent of any theft as a babe
and that the extent of his shortcoming
began and ended with a bottle. Finally
he r nself was placed on the stand and
the^prosecution realizing that, unless
something unexpected was developed,
they 'would lose their case, put him on
the rack and subjected him to a cross-
examination that was simply barbarous, j
He. however, managed to pass through ]
it all right and the little lawyer was
about to conclude when a happy thought j
seemed to strike him and he said, "Were j
you ever In prison before In your life?" I
"I was," replied the defendant. "Where, j
when and on what charge?" asked the I
lawyer, as a smile of triumph mantled his
features and h*> glanced toward the jury j
as much as to say, "Pay close attention;
the unexpected which I have been work- i
ing for is about to develop." And it did. j
With a sudden stiffening of his whole
frame and with a flash of fire from his :
old eyes he answered, in a voice that 'Â
fairly rang with martial feeling. "An- ;
dersonville.^in '63, for getting captured
on a battle-field after receiving four
wounds "n defense of the same flag that
floated over the Maine."
It took the jury just ten seconds to :
acquit him.

BALD-FACED
SATSUMA FIRST
Dr. Rowell's Chestnut
Horse Won the Rich
Burns Handicap.
The Winner Piloted in Masterly
Fashion by Jockey H.
Shields.
Buck Mbbslo W.s Unplaoed-Won't
Dtnca Ran a Great RaeÂ«, Fin
ishing Second.
Satsuma, the bald-faced son of Mac-
Duff, captured the richest prize of the
California turf at Oakland track yes
terday. Nearly 10,000 people frantically
cheered Dr. Rowell's great chestnut
horse as he led Won't Dance under the
wire.
The event was a handicap, and the
allotment of weights was the cause for
an onslaught of many naughty things
hurled at Handicapper Brooks. Not
withstanding all this, it was one of the
best contested races ever run in Cali
fornia, and Jockey Henry Shields and
Satsuma are heroes of the hour.
The big event of the day was fifth
on the card, and ten horses accepted
the issue. The Burns & Waterhouae
pair, Traverser and Candelarla, held
first place in the betting at odds of 5
to 2. Jim Murphy told all of his friends
to have a bet on Buck Massie. and
the hero of many an equine battle was
second choice in the belting. The Mon
tana people thought well of the chances
of Ostler Joe, and eagerly accepted the
8 to 1 offered about him. Ed Corrigan
went out of his way to say that Won't
Dance had an undeniable chance, and
when the daughter of Longfellow fin
ished second the books winced. Against
Satsuma, with Shields up, the ring laid
10 and 12 to 1.
It was after 4 o'clock when the horses
were summoned to the post, and fujl
twenty minutes had elapsed before
Starter Ferguson released the barrier
to a perfect start. As prophesied,
Traverser passed the stand first, fol
lowed by Buck Massie, Fonsovannah
and Ostler Joe. Soon it became appa
rent that Fonsovannah was sent out to
kill off Traverser, and three furlongs
from home the hopes of "Pa" Bradley
were blasted â Traverser was beaten.
The chestnut, however, led Fonsovan
nah into the stretch, with bald-faced
Satsuma at their heels. Henry Shields
on the latter rode the race of his life,
and gradually taking command the
long-Umbed rider piloted the outsider
past the winning post a head before
Won't Dance, the mile and a quarter
being negotiated in 2:07^. The latter
mare ran a wonderful race, for as the
stand was passed the first time she
was last of the bunch Thorpe brought
Candelaria up from the far rear, taking
third place.
Shields, the rider of Satsuma, re
ceived a great ovation on his return
to the stand, and richly he deserved it,
for never was a hurse better handled.
The winner was decorated with a
handsome floral horseshoe placed over
his neck by Thomas H. Williams Jr.,
president of the Jockey club, and Dr.

The First United States Infantry,
stationed at the Presidio, is ready for
the front. As announced exclusively
in yesterday's Call, orders were re
ceived Friday Instructing the com
manding officer, Colonel Evan Mi'es, to
have the companies of the regiment
hold themselves in readiness to leave
at a moment's notice. Instant prep
arations were made to execute the or
der. Shelter tejits were drawn and
other field camp equipage issued to the
soiaiers.
Yesterday morning the companies of
the regiment stationed at the Presidio
were inspected in heavy marching or
der. Every enlisted man was sup
plied with the lieid regulation allow
ance of clothing and one tin cup, knife,
fork and spoon, constituting the mess
furniture of a soldier in the field. Each
soldier in line had his overcoat neatly
wrapped in one-half of a shelter tent.
The inspection was thorough, indicat
ing the readiness of the command to
move without delay to the front.
The following dispatch shows that
orders similar to those issued at the
Presidio were given at Benicia Bar
racks:
BENICIA. April 9, 1898.
Orders have been received at the
Benicia Barracks instructing the
commanding officer. Colonel Smith,
to have the companies of the First
Infantry under his command to hold
themselves in readiness to leave at a '
moment's notice. Inspection is now
being held, and all that are not fit for
service -will be left out. The sold
iers express plenty of enthusiasm
over the order.
Many representatives of the gentler
sex, after reading The Call yesterday
paid a visit to their friends stationed
at the Presidio. The First Infantry has
been at this statin: for many years,
and the officers and enlisted men have
formed many lasting friendships in the
community. The departure of the reg
iment for the front will cause many
tender expressions of regret, but the
eoldiers stand ready to go where duty
demands.
Orders for the regiment to march
may come to-morrow or may be post
poned for days. At the post exchange
where the enlisted men assemble to
smoke and gossip wagers are laid that
the orders to leave will be given before
Monday midnight. At the Presidio
Club, where the officers of the garri
son loiter occasionally and talk over
the news, the opinion finds many sup
porters that the recent orders do not
si -nify immediate departure for the
front. Some of the officers believe yet
that war with Spain will be avoided,
by Spanish concession.
The order posted at headquarters
last Friday, which directs that officers
shall not leave the Presidio without
Bpecial permission from the command-
Ing officer, has not been revoked or
modified. This signifies that the order
to march is hourly expected.
General Bhafter, commanding the de
partment, will arrive in the city from
the south to-morrow morning. First
Lieutenant John D. Miley. Fifth Artil
lery, aid and engineer officer on the
general's staff, returned from San Di
tgo yesterday. The report of the com
manding officer's inspection of the San
Diego fortifications will be forwarded
at once to headquarters of the army in
Washington.
It is known that the defenseless con
3ltlon of severaJ of the cities of the Pa
cific coast has engaged the attention of
General Shafter. It is surmised that a
Spanish cruiser or privateer might

A POPULAR MISTAKE
Regarding Remedies for Dyspepsia and
Indigestion.
The national disease of Americans Is
Indigestion or in its chronic form, dy-
spepsia, and for the very reason that
It Is bo common many people neglect
taking proper treatment for what they
ronsider trifling stomach trouble, when,
as a matter of fact, indigestion lays
the foundation for many Incurable dis-
eases. No person with a vigorous,
healthy stomach will fall a victim to
consumption. Many kidney diseases
and heart troubles date their begin-
ning from poor digestion; thin, nerv-
ous people are really so because their
stomachs are out of gear; weary, lan-
gruid, faded out women owe their con-
dition to imperfect digestion.
When nearly every person you meet
Is alilicted with weak digestion it is not
surprising that nearly every secret pat-
ent medicine on the market claims to
be a cure for dyspepsia, as well as a
Bcore of other troubles, when, .in fact,
as Dr. Werthior says, there is but one
genuine dyspepsia cure which is per-
fectly safe and reliable, and moreover,
this remedy is not a patent medicine.
but it is a scientific combination of
pure pepsin (free from animal matter),
vegetable essences, fruit salts and bis-
muth. It Is sold by druggists under
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. Js'o
extravagant claims are made for them,
but for indigestion or any stomach
trouble. Stuart's Dyrpepsla Tablets are
far ahead of any remedy yet discov-
ered. They act on the food eaten, no
dieting is necessary, simply eat all the
â¢wholesome food you want and these
tablets will digest it, A cure results,
because all the stomach needs is a
rest, which Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
give by doing the work of digestion.
Druggists sell thr-se tablets at 50 cents
per package. Little book on slomach
diseases and testimonial* sent free by

make a demonstration against Santa
Barbara and even land a force of men
and demand tribute.
In view of the importance to the Gov
ernment of the powder plant at Santa
Cruz preparations are In progress to
erect defensive works at that point. It
transpires that the department com
mander considered this subject several
weeks ago and has since decided to
erect a battery and establish a garri
son at Santa Cruz. Whether the forti
fications will be garrisoned by troops
of the United States army or compa
nies of the National Guard of this
State has not yet been determined. As
measures of defense progress it be
comes obvious that there will be plenty
of work for the State troops. A regi
ment of the National Guard may at
any hour be ordered to duty at the Pre
sidio.
It also comes to light that the army
authorities have decided to materially
strengthen the defenses of San Diego.
The battery of ten-inch rifles now in
position may be exposed to an enfilad
ing fire from a Spanish cruiser. Ad
ditional earthworks on the flank to the
ocean may be necessary as a protec
tive measure. It Is understood that
other batteries will be erected to guard
the harbor against an enemy's ap
proach. A regiment of the National
Guard, or at least a battalion, may be
sent to San Diego.
The Santa Cruz position is specially
important because the Government has
ordered vast quantities of Santa Cruz
powder for shipment to the Atlantic
seaboard. The public will not be ad
vised when the shipments are made,
but the fact remains neverthe!ess that
the po-wder has been contracted for and
the transportation has been secured
by the quartermaster's department of
the army. The Works are not more
lhan'two miles from the ocean: hence
a privateer throwing shells in that lo
cality might explode the works.
Colonel Miles, commanding the post
at the Presidio, was at Fort Point yes
terday afternoon when the 12-inch
breech-loading ritie, which is to be
mounted on a disappearing cariage.was
landed from a barge near the fort. The
water was smooth, and the contractor
had no trouble in getting the great gun
from the barge safely on shore before
dark. The gun was moved above high
water line last night and will be hauled
up the hill and placed in position with
out unnecessary delay. This gun weighs
fifty-nine tons. The carriage on which
it is to rest weighs ISO tons.
Captain George E. Sage, U. S. A., re
ceived intelligence by wire yesterday
that he had been assigned to duty with
the Sixth Artillery, Colonel E. B. Wil
liston, Fort McHenry, Maryland. The
captain, who was recently pro-moted
from first lieutenant of the Fifth Ar
tillery, is a native of New York, and
was appointed a second lieutenant in
the Nineteenth Infantry from Illinois
September 30, IS6S. July 14, 1869, he was
assigned to the Fifth Artillery, and
February 21, 1881, was promoted first
lieutenant. Captain Sage served with
the Fifth at stations along the New
England coast from Fort Trumbull,
Conn., to Fort Sullivan. Me. In May,
IS7O, when the Fenians made their at
tempted invasion of Canada, Captain
Sage accompanied his battery to the
scene of disturbance in Northern New
York and Vermont. In the fall of 1873
his regiment was ordered south, and
in ISM it garrisoned the posts in New
York harbor. In IS9O the Fifth came
to the Pacific Coast and was stationed
at posts in San Francisco harbor and
Fort Canby, Wash., with headquarters
at the Presidio, at which post Captain
Sage was stationed till August 14, 1894,
when he was appointed military in
structor at Mount Tamalpais Military
Academy at San Rafael.
Of the $90,000 appropriated by Con
gress on estimates submitted by Gen
eral A. W. Greely. chief signal officer,
United States army, for cables to con
nect electrically the fortifications in
the harbors along the Atlantic and Pa
cific coasts with the main land, the de
partment of California has been al
lotted a sufficient sum to connect all
the islands in San Francisco harbnr
and fortifications at Lime Point, Fort
Baker and Fort Mason. The destruc
tion of the military cables between Al
catraz and Angel islands ,nd the main
land long since left the fortifications in
the harbor isolated and entirely un
connected electrically. Work is now
being rushed on this work by the sig
nal officer of the department. Lieuten
ant Frank Green, and when completed
the entire system of our harbor de

STRONG HARES AND FAST DOGS
INGLESIDE.
One of the best local cards ever drawn
was run down at Ingleside Coursing Park
yesterday, and the way the talent was
kept on the run was proof positive that
something will "be doing to-day." A
large Saturday crowd was on the ground,
but they found it almost Impossible to
guess the winners. A long string of top
notchers and many second-raters started,
but the way they had been drawn made
the sport of more than general Interest.

HALE & NORCROSS
DECISION IS IN
It Is No Nearer a Conclusion
Than It Was Many
Months Ago.
Supreme Court Rehashes a Former
Ruling and Sends the Caso
Back.
The long-expected decision in the case
of M. W. Fox against the Hale & Nor
cross Silver Mining Company was hand
ed down yesterday, and the findings of
the majority of the court leave the
matter in practically the same condition
that it was In after the previous de
cision by the same tribunal. The opinion
was written by Justice Temple and con
curred in by Chief Justice Beatty and
Justices Henshaw and Harri/on, Justices
Garoutte and Van Fleet dissenting. The
substance of the decision is summed up
in the following findings:
The judgment will therefore be as
upon the first appeal, that the judg
ment below is set aside and the Su
perior Court is directed to enter a
judgment as of the date of the first
judgment against Alvinza Hayward,
H. M. Levy and the estate of W. S.
Hobart, deceased, for the sum of
$210,197 50, with the interest from
that date upon the issue, for having
paid an excessive price for milling
the ore in the Mexican and Nevada
mills. As to the issue presented by
a claim for damages sustained for
reason of imperfect and fraudulent
milling, a new trial is awarded and
the court is directed to proceed and
try that issue and make findings in
accordance with the views hereinbe
fore expressed.
In order tbat the full meaning of this
dfdsion may be understood a brief his
tory of the" matter must be given. M.
W. Fox, on behalf of himself and other
stockholders of the corporation, began
an action against the company, and par
ticularly against Hayward, Hobart, H.
M. Levy, the president of the company,
and the Virginia and Mexican Mill, the
Nevada Milling and Mining Company and
several directors, wealthy citizens of the
Pacific Coast. The defendants were ac
cused of conspiracy and frauds of the
most gross nature, the principal charge
bring that Hayward and Hobart, owners
of the mills, made an arrangement with
the ethers so that ores taken from the
mine to their mills should be so treated
that a large part of the precious metals
should go into the slimes and tailings
and later be converted to the use of the
conspirators, who in turn would divide
with the suborned president. Levy, thus
defrauding the stockholders out of large
sums of money.
The case was first heard before Supe
rior Judge Ilebbard, who found that the
directors named in the complaint, to
gether with Hayward, Hobart and Levy,
were guilty of fraud. That the sum of
$210,000 be paid by the accused in lieu of
the fraudulent excess of milling charges
and the enormous sum of $1,025,000 Judg
ment for the amount embezzled. From
this an appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court, where the Justices, after
long deliberation, exonerated the incrim
inated directors of the charge of fraud.
They also reversed the Judgment relating
to the $1,025,000 embezzlement. The Judg
ment on the first amount named, $210,197,
was affirmed, the higher tribunal holding
that thiÃ was merely for an overcharge
for milling, but In the damages for fraud
in milling the Judgment and order were
reversed.
When the remitlttur went down the
Judge of the lower court entered Judg
ment for $210,197. and from this another
appeal was taken, the contention being
that the Judgment was segregated and
there could not be two Judgments in one

UNION PARK.
The big racing event at Oakland track
yesterday attracted quite a number of the
supporters of coursing from the Union
Park coursing grounds, yet, all things
considered, there was a comfortable at
tendance when the first course was called.
The betting was especially lively and sev
eral thousands of dollars changed hands.
The Call's tips, as usual, were heavily
played, and out of twenty-four courses
but four selections failed to cash.
The following 1b the result of the first
run down of the all-aged stake:
Sans Souci beat Alameda; Forget beat
Kilkenny Girl; Tessie Fair beat Van
Knapp; Tod Sloan beat Sharkey; Douglas
beat Black Pete; Green Valley Maid beat
Van Cloie; Van Needa beat Arapahoe;
Terrona beat Santa Alicia; Chit Chat beat
Carmen; Camilla beat Vida Shaw; Sweet
Lips beat Ben B; Chartist beat Harkaway
II; Theron beat Port Costa Lass; Magic
beat Lady Harkaway; Promise Me beat
Electric; The Turk beat Lady Grace;
Move On beat Gilt Edge; Moore's Pre
scription beat Lor- Byron; Herculese beat
Amorita; Wmte Chief beat Gannon
Pasha; Eclipse beat Commodore; Rusty
Gold beat Marcella; Mountain Beauty
beat Royal Buck; Flying Buck beat Rey
Alfonso.
In the first round of to-day, The Call
makes the following selections, which will
prove successful provided the hares run
up to their form of yesterday:
Forget to beat Sans Souci; Tessie Fair
to beat Tod Sloan; Green Valley Maid to
beat Douglas; Terrona to beat \an Nee
da; Chit Chat to beat Camilla; -Chartist
to beat Sweet Lips; Theron to beat Magic;
Promise Me to beat The Turk; Move On
to beat Moore's Prescription; Hercules
to beat White Chief: Rusty Gold to beat
Eclipse. Flying Buck and Mountain
Beauty should make a clinking course
with Buck to win by a small margin.
Doubtless the stake will be won by
either of the following dogs: Flying
Buck, Rusty Gold or Theron. Green Val
ley Maid will have a number of warm
admirers, as she is running fast and
strong.
In the puppy stakes Palmer Hill beat
War Cloud; Royal Oak beat Arrow; Pas
time beat Quiver; Star Pointer beat
Dempsey; Bonlta beat Sunbeam; Flying
Faster beat Gold Brick; Handy Andy
beat Obadiah; Minerva beat Liberty Bell.
As the young dogs are very uncertain
in their running, selections will not be
made. Flying Faster ran very well yes
terday, and may possibly land the stake.
case and that the court must wait for
that portion of the judgment that was set
back for further trial. The position of the
defendants was sustained by, the Supreme
Court, the judgment was reversed and
the case sent back to await the final ac
tion of the lower court in the ca.se in its
entirety.
That portion of the original judgment
which was remanded for a new trial (the
part relating to the damages sustained
by imperfect and fraudulent milling) was
attain tried before Judge Hebbard, who
found for the plaintiff fur $417,000. which,
with the $210,197, was entered against the
defendants, and this constituted the judg
ment from which this last appeal was
taken. As stated, the decision of yester
day places the case in exactly the same
position as when the tirst Supreme Court
decision was rendered.
The decision was not in the least a sur
prise to many. It is the custom that the
nature of a decision by this high tribunal
shall not be known until after it is hand
ed to the clerk of the court and filed. On
Friday the stock brokers, or some of
them, seemed to know all about what
ti.e verdict would be. and as a result over
0000 shares were unloaded on thp market,
the price tumbling from $1 30 to $1. Some
one in the inside must have given a tip
which was not slow to be taken. Im
mediately after rendering the decision the
court departed for Los Angeles.

"SINBAD" AT
THE TIVOLI
The Tivoll commenced Its silly season
lnst night with the new Easter piece,
â i. the Sailor." a typical Tivo'.i
burlesque, with everybody's music and
ly'a plot and no end of pictures,
dances, nonsense and noise. It Is the pol-
I the management to put on such
productions at regular Intervals and the
policy of its patrons to patronize them
handsomelyâ and as "Sinbad" is quite as
elabcrately and expensively gotten up as
nr.y of its predecessors, and the cast a
ne and a strong one, it is easy to
anucipate a popular run. Last night's
â  mance, In spite of the inevitable
jerks and drags of an opening*, was hi
rariously received by an audience that
led the doormat for space. After
once complimenting several of the scenic
sets, the costumes, the ballet and the ever
trusty chorus the applause all goes to the
Individual specialty work of the perf â¢rni
ers. wbo are the bulk of the entertain
ment. Turn follows turn with breathless
rapidity and in somewhat tactful va
riety. The spoken lines of the piece !
proper hardly ever are in evidence, which
Is doubly a good thine, since what little
there is of straight dialogue is even
worse than the usual Tivoli product.
UÂ£ the big casl Carrie Koma, Edwin
Elevens. Thomas Leary and "Bob' Mitch
o, enji yed particular prominence. Mr.
Leary, as Tmbad the Tailor, Insisted <>n
his by rather more noise than was vital;
Mr. Mitchell's was thrust upon him by
two-thirds of the audience, who. having
come in the capacity of personal friends
and admirers, were not to be dissuaded
merely because the management had
been so shortsighted as not to supply
"Bob" with a large, plump part.
Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Branson are cast
as a team of tax collectors and general
utility comedians, and they have small
chance of glory until in the hitter part
of the second act, when they stuff a cap
ital comic duet. When Mr. Mitchell's
opportunity finally did arrive he parted j
â with his nervousness and met it admira
bly, singing and dancing with the easy
humor and genial personality that have
long stood him in valuable stead. After
all then; is but little difference between
a good amateur and a good professional.
In responsibilities no greater than his in
"Sinbad" Mr. Mitchell does not need the
applause ot personal friendship to point
hia success.
Mr. Stevens is an Irish mariner this
time, and entirely unlike hims.-lf in any
other personation. In singing the "Bogie
Man" he misses that mystical i
which Norman used to give the song,
through hurrying it, and his "invisi
ble drill" scene is not worth the while;
) â¢ ! : these, and Castain Paul Jones
O'Scuttle is the best thing he has done
in many a day. Carrie Koma. an inval

C. P. HUNTINGTON SPEAKS.
Distinctly Denies the Story That He
Is Opposing the New Charter.
A story has been printed that C. P.
Huntington, president of the Southern
Pacific Company, is fighting the new
charter for San Francisco. The Call,
deeming it advisable to ascertain if the
story had any foundation in fact, sent
a reporter to interview the railroad
president on the topic.
It was some little time before Mr.
Huntington comprehended the meaning
of the Questions addressed to him. He
said that he did not know that a charter
was pending and certainly had no no
tion of opposing a measure before he
underFtood its provisions. He remarked:
"I have had no consultation with Mr.
Herrin or any cither officer of the com
pany on this subject. Any charter that
is agreeable to the voters of San Fran
cisco will suit the railroad company. If
property interests generally are pro
tected by the pending charter, I presume
railroad property will share In the gen
era: m<.asurÂ«? of protection. The people
of San Francisco evidently understand
the provisions of the proposed organic
act for the government of the city. I do
not understand that there is a proposi
tion pending to impair vested rights or
confiscate property. I apprehend that I
would be apprised of the fact If the
charter threatened to destroy property.
You can say distinctly that I have had
no conference with Mr. Herrin or any
one else connected with the company in
the matter of opposing or supporting the
proposed charter. The subject has not
been discussed or brought forward in
any form for consideration by the repre
sentatives of the Southern Pacific. We
can live under laws agreeable to other
property-owners."
Mr. Herrin of the law department of
the company was interviewed on the
same tonic. He denied without hesita
tion or qualification that he was oppos
ing the charter. He remarked: "1 have
had no conference on the subject of the
charter with C. P. Huntington. I have
not consulted with any of my associates
in the company on the subject. The
topic has not been discussed in my pres
ence and expression of my views as an
individual citizen has not been solicited."

Claims Against the Steamer Grady.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday rendered a decree awarding
$1046 44 to the Black Diamond Coal Mining
Company in payment of the company's
claim against the steamer H. C. Grady;
also $1450 to sailors and other claimants
â  r wages, supplies, etc.
I would not had cents, since that tlmo. I gave
it to him secretly for a while, then I told him
of It so now I don't mind letting my name he
published. I am going to recommend it far and
near, so with many thanks I close. Respect-
fully, AMANDA CARTER."
And such cures as these remain so perma-
nently, even the worst cases where the habit
seems to have blotted out the last remaining
spark of self-respect. There are thousands of
women who would make almost any sacrifice
to throttle the rum demon.
Tears and prayers are of no use. Pleading,
pledges, loss of social or business positions are
unavailing to stem the tide of absolute deprav-
ity. This famous remedy, Golden Specific, dis-
covered by Dr. Haines, has reunited thousands
of scattered families, it has saved thousands
of men to social and business prominence and
public respect; has guided many a young man
into the right road to fortune; has saved the
father, the brother, the son and in many cases
the wife and daughter, too. Such a Godsend
to the fireside should be known to everyone.
Dr. Haines is not a philanthropist In his own
estimation, and yet he is one of the greatest
benefactors to the family we know of. Upon
application to I>r. J. W. Haines, 218 Glenn
building, Cincinnati, 0.. he will mall a free
sample of the remedy to you. securely sealed
In a plain wrapper; also full directions how to
use it. books and testimonials and everything
needed to aid you In saving those near and
dear to you from a life of degradation and ul-
timate p"overty and disgrace.
Send for a trial to-day. It will brighten the
rest of your life.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APEIL 10, 1898.
BROUGHT BACK
FOR REPAIRS
The Steamer Corona Ar
rived Yesterday From
Pucjet Sound.
She Will Be Put on the Union
Iron Works Drydock.
at Once.
It Will Probably Take Two Months
to Get Her Reacty for Busi
ness Again.
The wrecked steamer Corona of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's line
arrived in port yesterday in tow of the i
Puget Sound tug Tyee. While on her
way from Seattle to Dyea and Skaguay
the Corona went on the rocks near Dixon j
Point Alaska. This was in January last I
and it took Captain C. Miner Goodall and ,
a party of divers and wreckers nearly I
two months to get her off the rocks, and
onto a sandy beach where temporary re
pairs could be made.
The work was much delayed, owing to ;
the fact that the wreck was in British
waters and only British tugs were al
lowed to render any assistance. While
the wreck was being towed to Victoria,
B. C, the British tug was cast off when
opposite Port Townsend and an Ameri
can tug immediately made fast and took
the Corona into Port Townsend. There
she was made ready for the voyage to
San Francisco, and five days ago the
start was made. It was a long, hard
pull, but the Tyee was equal to the emer
gency and brought the Corona In all
right. The work of repairing the ves
sel will be begun at once and Goodall,
Perkins & Co. expect to have her back
early next month on the northern route
i again.
The Tyee will not go back empty hand
ed. The tug Tiger wants a tow as far
as Cape Flattery and the Tyee will do
the work. The Tiger is to be used dur
ing the summer months as a tender be
tween St. Michael and the steamers run
ning up and down the Yukon. As she
has only a bay and river license she can
! not go to sea under her own steam, so
i she will be towed to the straits of Juan
I de Fuca and will then take the inland
1 passage to St. Michael. The Tiger has
I been dccked-in most securely and she
looks something like a whaleback as she
lies at Howard street wharf.
Eddie Hammond was arrested by Ser
! geant Mahoney of the Harbor police yes
| ttrday and charged with petty larceny.
1 Incidentally the lad's arrest is going to
get the officers of the Whitelaw AY reck
ing Company into trouble. Eddie stole
: a shackle wurth about $20 from the old
whaler Hunter, and taking it to \\ lute
'â  law's sold it for 3u cents. It was still on
i the scales when Sergeant Mahoney ar
i rived on the scene, but no record of the
i transaction could be found in the com
! pany's books. Consequently Sergeant
i Mahoney is going to teach somebody con
nected with the firm a lesson.
Purser Thomas Smith and Chief Officer
! James Ronnie 01 the steamer Alameda
' were treated to quite a surprise party
i yesterday. A delegation from the pas
sengers who came over on the steamer
i from Australia boarded the vessel and
presented Mr. Smith with a solid silver
inkstand and Mr. Rennie with a solid sil
', ver match box and a tobacco box. Each
; article bears a suitable inscription, and
: they were accompanied by a testimonial
thanking the two officers for their kind
! ness ana courtesy during the voyage.
The 10 a. m. ferry steamer from Tibu
ron brought over an ambulance in which
â  was John Donnelly, one of the oldest en-
I gineers in the employ of the San Fran
! Cisco and North Pacific Railway. Mr.
i Donnelly is thought to be suffering from
a fracture of the skull, and lie was at
once taken to St. Mary's Hospital from
the steamer.
The engine which Mr. Donnelly was
driving had been overhauled and a new
I shoe put on the brake. Wh^n the brake
1 was put on the shoe squeaked, and the
! engineer leaned out of the cab to see
i what was the trouble. The sunnosition
! is that he overbalanced himself and fell
| out of the fast moving engine, as when
I the fireman turned around to speak to
â  him he was gone. The train was at once
stopped and backed up until the unfortu
nate man was found near the track in an
unconscious condition. Engineer Don
1 nelly has been nearly twenty years in the
1 employ of the San Francisco and North
: Pacific Railway, and this is the first time
, that cither he or his engine has met with
; a mishap. .
The captain of the bark Edward May
! is having a great deal of trouble getting
! a crew. His vessel is going to VTadivo
i stok, and coasting sailors do not care to
take $20 a month when they can got more
running to the Sound. Captain Johnson
has secured one man out of seven, and
he has to employ a watchman to see that
the one does not run away. Monday the
! bark will be moved into the stream, and
then a vigorous effort will be made to get
tlif bark away.
The cigar-stand at 36 Market street and
L. Kaufman, who was in it at tho time,
1 had a narrow escape yesterday. The ad
joining lot is being excavated, and the
brick wall of the cigar-store was acci
! dentally undermined. Without a mo
ment's warning: it fell, and in Its fall
took nearly all the cigars with it. Kauf
man thought it was another earthquake
and made his escape iust in time. The
flooring began to follow the wall into the
excavation below, and he would have
gone with It had he not bef>n very quick
on his feet. All of yesterday afternoon
the cigarman did business in the fruit
stand next door, while a gang of men
were at work removing the wreck and
repairing the damages.
W. H. Hamilton, who until recently
was traveling freight agent for the Chi
cago and Northwestern Railway, was
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital
yesterday morning, partially asphyxi
ated. He was found in one of the com
pany's offices with the gas turned on.
Dr. Diggins worked over him at the hos
pital for an hour and finally saved his
life. Hamilton was later removed to his
home at 1269 Sacramento street, where
Dr. Diggins visited him during the after
noon, and now says he is out of danger.
Hamilton's friends scout the idea of sui
cide, and the patient himself says he
does not know how the gas came to be
turned on.
Injured by a Hack.
William Ambroffi was run over by ft
hack driven by Cerefino de Barberl at
Powell and Filbert streets last night. He
was picked up by Officer O'Connor and
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
where it was found that his jaw was
broken, his scalp badly laceratr-d and his
skull probably fractured. Ambroffi is a
laboring man residing at Vallejo and Du
pont streets, but for some time has been
out of employment. He is not expected
to recover. The hackdriver was arrested
and his name placed on the detinue book
at the Central Station pending an investi
gation.

McKINLEY ON
THE 'PHONE
The President's Voice to
Be Heard at the Ma
sonic Festival.
Charles L. Patton Discusses the
Probable Outcome of His
Efforts.
To Look After the Widows and Or
phans of the Members a Tenet
of the Order.
President McKinley has consented to
give three patriotic speeches at the
coming Masonic Festival through the
medium of the phonos raph.
The telegram which was sent to
Washington asking this favor of the
C v 'ef Executive of the nation was met
with approval by him, and Californians
who visit the fete in honor of the wid
ows' and orphans' fund will have the
pleasure of listening to that voice which
in a short time will retrieve the honor
of Americans and forever stamp out
the dastardly inhumanity which Is no.v
being perpetrated upon the Cubans.
CHARLES L. PATTON, a Vigorous Worker for the Masonic Festival.
Although McKlnley has consented to
talk to the citizens of California In this
novel way he will not, however, talk in
the phonograph for a few days, as his
whole thoughts are at present concen
trated on national affairs.
The phonograph has been loaned to
the Masons by the Pacific Telephone
Company and will be sent to "Washing
ton at the expense of the company.
Charles L. Patton, a leading member
of the Masonic order and a firm worker
for the success of the festival, In dis
cussing the authenticity of the answer
made by McKlnley, confirmed the re
port by producing the telegraphic reclv
which was written by McKinley and
sent across the continent.
Another feature of the festival will
be a speech on the disaster of the
Maine by Captain Sigsbee.
The preliminary work for the fete
which is to be held in this city next
month in aid of " - Masonic Widows'
and Orphans' Home, situated at De
coto, is about completed. The organi
zation, to all appearances, is complete,
and the work of preparation is pro
gressing in a steady and thoroughly
satisfactory way. The principal bur
den has naturally devolved on the
members of the executive committee
who, without exception, have responded
to the calls that have been made on
the time that should have been de
voted to other work. They are as a
rule occupied with business and pri
vate affairs, but, in order to insure the
success of the undertaking, they have
very generously allowed private inter
ests to become entirely secondary to
the affairs of the festival.

and leading spirit in the fete, will rest
much of the success of the undertak
ing, and, in a considerable part, the re
sponsibility. He, however, is enthusi
astic over the outlook and applauds the
work done in the past. To make .the
assurance of success doubly sure he has :
worked most indefatigably night and
day', and is still laboring to create an ;
enthusiasm in the public mind for the
noble purpose for which the coming fes
tival is being planned.
"It is pleasing," he said yesterday, in
dipcussing the probable outcome of his
efforts, "to see with what good will
our labor is being appreciated. Not
only is the entire Masonic fraternity
with us, but the entire city, and I may
say, the State is in harmony with our
project."
"It takes up a great deal of time," he
continued, "and there are thousands of
other things to attend to, still as long
as it is for so worthy a cause I feel
sure that no one grudges the services
they are giving. It is one of the tenets
of Masonry to look after and care for
the widows and the orphans; and it
seems to members generally that the
completion of the Decoto Home will
enable us to do our duty in a more sat
isfactory way than we can otherwise
accomplish it."
As chairman of the executive com
mittee Mr. Patton has directed the j
matter of placing before the lo^es in ;
the interior the pri iect in its various
aspects. One of the most pleasing fea
tures of festival week will be *he re
newing of acquaintanceships, and as it j
is certain that many visitors will come ;
to the city fro. a the interior towns dur- j
ing the fete, it has been Patton's aim
to assure the country members a thor
oughly hospitable reception and a week
of gayety in which there shall be no
disturbing incidents.
The responsibility for securing the
heaviest donations from the larger
class of merchants has also fallen
much under Mr. Patton's direct super
vision, and the great meed of success
which has been met with has been de-
scribed from day to day. There will be
no cessation of work, however, until
the doors of the Pavilion are opened on
what is described as the "most striking
charitable event that has been held in
the city for many years."
MARTIN BEAT TERRILL.
The Cycling Race Was Slow and De
void of Any Particular Interest.
The much-talked-of match race be
tween "Plugger Bill" Martin, the Aus
tralian racer, and Bob Terrill of the Bay
City Wheelmen of this city, took place
yesterday afternoon on the Elmhurst
track.
The race -was for five miles, the con
testants starting from opposite sides of
the track. . , .
Arthur M. Boyden was accepted by
both riders as referee. .
The lirst mile was ridden at a steady
pace. Terrill's time was 2:28, while Mar
tin covered the mile in 2:30.
On the lap which registered the finish
of two miles, Martin completely, over
hauled Terrill. the latter apparently
urging upon his opponent the task of
taking pace. This, of course. Martin re
fused to do. and the next mile was rid
den at a regular plugging pace.
The fourth mile developed into a veri
table loaf, both riders being extremely
wary however, Terrill looking for an op
portunity to jump out on a bank and
Martin closely following his every move-
The fourth mile was finished at this
same snail's pace, and only when the bell
sounded for the last lap did the riders
liven up a bit. Terrill sprinted, with
Martin close behind, but Martin's, lead
was too great and he crossed the tape
on his side of the track a winner in
ifi*n
Prior to the event of the day a two
mile handicap race was contested by the
following well-known professionals: Har
dy Downing, scratch; Bert Crafts, 20
yards, and J. T. Hayes, 200 yards. .
" The start of the race was delayed
somewhat to permit of the arrival of
Downing, who had missed the morning
train from San Jose.
Downing won the contest in 4:421-5.
Crafts was second.

A meeting of the campaign committee
of the Democratic party of San Fran

Baldwin Hotel iast evening. Major P. J.
Hafney presided and J. F. McGovern

meeting was to arrange for a meeting
of the general committee, which is to
be held at Pioneer Hall to-morrow even

mittee 460 members, representing the dif

Paving occasion, fone'day, 'to^dictategto a stenographer in the business office
of one of the treat Philadelphia newspapers, I remarked that his duties must bo
tiresome and diiacult from being obliged to write down notes of what so many differ-
ent persons said and, therefore, compelled to accustom himself to all sorts of articula-
tion. Yes," was his -reply, "very few people "realize the exacting labor such a
â  position entails. A clear head is absolutely . necessary and the least illness often
: seriously affects the correct performance of my work. - For instance, I at one time
suffered from a stomach trouble brought on. I suppose, by eating cold lunches hastily,
as is necessary with me, and I finally felt that the trouble would break me up. Yoa
know a disordered stomach is invariably the root of any head trouble and of all
things a stenographer's head must be clear. I finally found an , effective remedy in
RIPANS TABULES which I saw advertised in our paper. They are magical in their
effects, and, .by the way, did you ever see anything of the sort put up in such superb
shape ? I have found that they seem to rectify nearly every all, for several of my friends
have taken my prescription of a Tabule now and then with results for which they have
heartily thanked me. The dull, heavy headaches I sometimes had are all gone now.
If I take dictation from a man who annoys me and makes me nervous I always takÂ« a
Tabule at the time, and if his breath is not sweet I give one to him."

CALIFORNIA
TAKES THE
FIRST GAME
Stanford Played Well
but Dame Fortune
Smiled Not.
Young of Palo Alto Makes
a Remarkable Hit for
a Home Run.
Sensational Catch of Hoag and
Double Plays Were
Features.
ON OTHER DIAMONDS.
A Dull Gamo at Central Park In
Which There Were Many-
Errors.
It was a beauty In baseball parlance,
running- a white line through the center
of the plate, and Mr. Young of Stanford,
towering aloft in his red sweater, just
ate It outright. California had just scored
live runs, and the sweat of anger was
glistening on Young's head. He swung
around and made connections with the
ball on the right spots, both of the sphe
roid and the stick. The leathern sphere
went up and out. It did not stop on its
mad career until It had leapt over the
far fence-, running parallel with Eighth
street. Young's hit is now scored as the
longest aerial flight made on the Recrea
tion grounds, and Stanford is groaning
that bases were devoid of red shirts when
the phenomenal drive was registered.
The first game of the series of three was
attached by California. Seven men wear
ing blue and gold uniforms coursed the
bags to the home plate; three clangs of
the gong tallied as many runs for the
cardinal, and that is why joy reigned in
one camp last night and sorrow in th*
other. Stanford was unattended by the
fair goddess. Fortune, her usual escort
on the athletic field, and that is why she
lost. The men from Palo Alto found no
difficulty in deciphering Kaarsberg's
curves. Eleven base hits was their por
tion, but they came at the wrong time.
On the other hand California made the
most of every opportunity. Her fielding
was undoubtedly superior to that of her
opponent and the men played as If they
knew the game.
in the first inning California came to
the bat and went to the tield without
anything happening. Stanford began well,
sending Wight across the plate after two
men had retired. Then came California's
opportunity to return the compliment.
Bride, hit by the pitcher, opened the
game. By a sacrifice bunt of Hoag's he
made second, from which base he came
home on a hit by Kaarsberg to right.
The next two men were quickly retired.
This tied the score, which remained un
changed until the last of the third, when
Swindells won for the red first by a hit
of his own, and then aided by .Lougheed's
hit to right and a wild throw of Collins
from right field to Bride on first. Score,
Stanford 2, California 1.
Then came a deluge and an upheaval
at the same time, and both conspired to
topple over Stanford's athletic Idols and
then treat them to a blue and gold im
mersion. The inning began by Bride's
arm coming in the way of the ball. He
stole second and went to third on Hoag'a
hit to left field. Hoag took second on a
passed ball, and Kaarsberg ruffled the at
mosphere three times, but could not find
the ball. McLaren went to first on balls
With the bags full. Baer stepped to the
plate. A short, sharp hit to Harris, who
juggled it in his nervousness, sent Bride
and Hoag home and further dallying with
the ball allowed McLaren to reach third
and Baer second. McCabe hit to Swin
dells, who. after a hard run, failed to
assimilate the ball, and McLaren scored,
Baer taking third. A passed ball and
Baer scores, McOa.be going to third. Then
Mem followed with a hit to Lougheed,
who fumbled, and McCabe scored, making
the boards read ti â 2 In favor of Cali
fornia.
Stanford here started well when they
came to the bat, following this cornucopic
outpouring of runs. Young then made j
his beautiful long drive, but that was j
the last of Stanford's tallying and the j
rooters in Cardinal are now untrue to i
their colors if their feelings are anything â 
of an index.
In the last of the seventh with the
score 6 to 2 against them Stanford start
ed the ball rolling. A double play of
McLaren, to McCabe to Bride, retired two
men. Young got first on a hit followed
by Strohn with a two-bagger. Harris saw
an open space between second and Hoag
in center Held and tried to drop the ball
there, but Hoag running with might and
main found the ball not an inch above !
the ground. His impetus forced him
into a gymnastic and acrobatic perform- !
ance, but despite a catenation of somer- j
saults he clung to the ball. In the ninth I
inning California scored again, making
the boards read 7 to 3.

From the Olympicsâ Egan's
Long Home Run Hit.
Oakland defeated the Olympics at Cen
tral Park yesterday after two hours and
a half of listless playing, in which errors,
ragged fielding and base hits predomin
ated. Knell, in eight innings, was touched
up for seventeen hits, - while "Heney"
Krug managed to ' fan thirteen men out,

WORTHLESS BONDS.
Edwin Lewis, Capitalist, Again in
Prison for Perjury.
Edwin Lewis, capitalist, who was or
dered into custody Thursday by Judge
Troutt, as his bonds were not considered
sufficient, was arrested yesterday after
noon by Policeman Bunner and taken to
the City Prison. He was later removed
to the County Jail. â¢
Lewis was indicted by the Grand Jury
on March 3on a charge of perjury. He
was one of the sureties on a bond for the
release of Joseph Dougherty charged with
grand larceny and qualified on a block
in the Western Addition which Bond In
spector Newman found did not belong to
him. The other surety on the bond was
Phillip Reichert, one of th? professional
bondsmen on the bond of Attorney A. M.
Holliday, who has tied from the city.
After Lewis had been arrested on the
charge of perjury, Reichert and Thomas
King, another professional bondsman,
went on his bond, which Judge Troutt
declared worthless.
Wanted to Be Supervisor.
At the last election in Sacramento M.
"W. Smith and J. W. Thomas were rival
candidates for the office of Supervisor of
District No. 3. According to the returns
Thomas was elected by a small majority
of votes, but Smith made a contest. The
lower court found that 346 votes were
counted by the Board of Election for
Thomas and 342 votes for Smith, and
that the Board of Supervisors had can
vassed said votes and returns and de
clared the defendant elected, and issued
; to him a certificate of election. The result
i of the trial was. and the court found,
"That plaintiff and defendant each re
ceived, and were entitled to have counted ,
for them. 343 legal votes cast at said elec- I
tion," and as a conclusion of law "that j
plaintiff take nothing by this action." Af- j
ter reviewing the testimony taken in the ;
lower court, the Supreme Justices affirmed
its judgment and order.

Haynes Murder Case.
When the case of Theodore Park
Haynes, charged with the murder of Lieu
tenant Burke, was called in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday morning to go on
with the defense, it was by consent con
tinued until to-morrow morning. The de
fendant is anxious to testify, but his at
torneys are fighting against it, and do
not wish to put In any defense until the
case comes up for trial in the Superior
Court.

DUNN REPLIES
TO CHAPMAN
The Health Officer Says
He Acted in Good
Faith.
Will Not Stop Arresting Those
Who Pollute Temescal
Creek.
Thers Is a Chapter of Politics, How
over, Th;it Dr. Dunn Has Not '
Read.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 9.
Health Officer Dunn takes exception to
the remarks of ex-Mayor Chapman made
yesterday In Judge (lift's court, while
O. Coffin was on trial for alleged pollu
tion of Temescal Creek.
Mr. Chapman stated that the arrest of
Coffin was merely a little evidence of the
persecution of one of the water compa
nies who found a pliable Board of Health
ready to do Its bidding. Dr. Dunn says
that Mr. Chapman is in error, and he
produces in proof of his assertion a cii
â  ular of the Health Department issued
January 5; 1597, by the homeopathic Board
A Health which Mayor Thomas Quickly
l^ounced, supplying its place with allo
paths. The circular states that the
Board of Health instructed Its secretary
"to see that all parties residing or own-
property upon the watersheds of
I Chahot and Ttmescal were per
. ly served with a copy of the health
-â¢ ; <>rt, in which he recommend;-;
certain measures be carried out to
. the fouling and polluting of the
waters which supply the lakes."
The recommendations require all peo
ple living on the watersheds to observe
certain rules regarding drainage from
cowsheds and similar places and the dis
posal of dead animals.
"When we took office three months af
ter the issuance of this circular," said
Dr. Dunn, "we simply carried out the
recommendations of our predecessors,
and as Coltin defied our authority wÂ»
had him arrested. > It was done on our
part in good faith and the prosecution
of the case was taken out of our hands.
Mr. Chapman had no right to asperse
the motives of the health officer in this
case."
Dr. Dunn personally may not have
been taken into the political combina
tion which every intelligent Oaklar.aer
knows ba.s controlled the city govern
ment thnjuch the water companies'
;tK-TiTs since the last city Republican cob*.
â 'â â â  However, Ik- offers no excuse
the notorious fact that although Cof
:.n was arrested last September, the Dis
trict Attorney, who is supposed and who
is paid to prosecute, had the case con
â i from time to time for over seven
mont};.^. .t:.d it is not on record that dur
ing the whole of that time the Board of
b sent any protest to the District
Attorney's office to expedite the proso
ition.
Mr. Chapman is a politician for pleas
ure and an attorney by profession. \Vheri
ho allies these two industries he Is very
apt, being on the inside of politics, to hit
the nail on the head. Should the Board
of Health desire to see the proofs of his
. contention, Mr. Chapman will no doubt
l.niake 500.1 his promise. Dr. Dunn states
that the prosecution of the guilty parties
along remescal Creek will be carried on
and will not be permitted to drop, and
â¢"hnuld Mr. Chapman be again retained
the defense, the political sensations
tie promised will probably be brought to
light. â¢>

DAVIS SOUNDS THE ALARM.
A Clever Attempt to Take the Oakland
Water-Front Case Out of the Jurisdic
tion of the Supreme Court.
OAKLAND, April 9.â William R. Davis, one of the special attorneys in
the water front litigation, made the following statement to-day:
"The petition filed by the parties signing it was gotten up ana filed without
any conference with any one representing the city of Oakland. Neither the
Mayor, the City Council, the City Attorney nor the official counsel were
aware of the existence of such a petition until it had gone to Washington
and been referred by the Secretary of War to the corps of engineers of the
army at San Francisco.
"We are not acquainted with the petitioners and how many of them will
turn out to be residents of Oakland and interested in Oakland's welfare re
mains to be seen. The notices of the hearing are very brief, but the subject
matter involved is of the utmost importance to the city, and for that matter
to the State. The change of harbor lines asked, stripped of all engineering
and legal refinements, means this:
"Under the decision of tne Supreme Court of California, as it now stands,
the holding is that the Water-front Company may and does own, as its pri
vate property, the narrow strip or ribbon of the water front between ordi
nary daily high and low tide, beginning at about the foot of Oak street and
extending westerly along the southern frontage to Twenty-second street.
The United States pierhead line established by the Federal Government in
1593 lies waterward in the estuary In front of the ordinary low-tide line all
the way. That pierhead line means the line of frontage out to which the
Federal Government will allow piers or wharves, docks and slips to be con
structed, open underneath so as not to interfere with the flow of the tide,
but with suitable flooring, docks, sheds and superstructures ordinarily used
In commerce.
"As matters now stand the distance between the low-tide line, which is
the outermost line to which the water-front company's lands can go, and
this Government pierhead line of 1R93, is at all points from Oak down to
the point very considerable; in some places as much as about 300 feet and
throughout much of the frontage over 100 feet in width. That is to say the
public (the State) is now at liberty- to erect and maintain wharves, docks,
piers and the like on an irregular strip of the water front lying waterward
from ordinary low-tide line out to the governmentally established pierhead
all the way and anywhere from about the foot of Oak street down to the
point and also off the West Oakland shore, beginning at ordinary low-tide
line out to the pierhead line there, which is a very large, roomy place.
"Taking this strip of the actual navigable frontage as matters now
stand it would average about 150 feet in width from Oak street to the point
and lies wholly in front of anything awarded by the Su preme Court to the
"Water-front Company, thus enabling the public to have, use and control
along that entire frontage the ship landings from Oak street to the point,
precisely as the State is now using and controlling the ship landings and
water frontage In San Francisco. Those who have not heretofore under
stood the great importance and advantage in these facts arising from the
recent litigation and decision of the Supreme Court will now perhaps have
their eyes opened by the fact that the private claimants of the water front
consider the present situation of so great advantage to the public that it is
sought by an order of the War Department to render nugatory the decision
of our State courts, for that will be precisely the effect of changing the
pierhead lines as the petitioners ask to have it changed.
"A moment's attention to the point discloses that the change asked in effect
does away with the decision of our Supreme Court, It is asked to move
the pierhead line all along the southern frontage of the city back land
ward to a new line suggested by the petitioners, which is entirely within,
that is, landward, of ordinary low-tide line all the way from Oak street to
the point, which means to move the pierhead line from public waters under
public control, where it now is, back upon private property, which would
give the absolute dominion and control of all those wharves, docks, slips,
piers and superstructures into the control of the private corporation.
"The decision limits private ownership to low-tide line; the change peti
tioned for would limit navigation, landing wharves, docks, warehouses and
all the usual instrumentalities of commerce to private possession and con
trol. Of course Oakland, is profoundly concerned now and for all time to
come in the question.
"I have said the State is concerned also. That arises not only from all
the foregoing, but also from the further fact that this petition asks that
the pierhead line on the south side of the estuary be pushed back to a line
there on the Alameda side landward there from the ordinary low-tide line,
doing which confronts Alameda and its future commerce with the same
question with which Oakland is confronted. The Supreme Court's decision
being as it is, they holding that 'ship channel" means ordinary low-tide
line, the grant to the town of Oakland ended at the low-tide line on the
north side of the estuary. The Supreme Court so holds. From this holding
it follows that the bed and basin of the estuary and no much of the bed of
the bay as is involved were never granted to the town of Oakland under the
Supreme Court's holding and lias remained all this time and now remains
under the original direct jurisdiction and control of the State of California.
"The special attorneys for the city will draw the attention of the board
of engineers to the effect of the Supreme Court's decision and to the effect
of the proposed change. We of course have no authority to act profession
ally for the State of California. That rests with the Attorney-General. But
we are citizens of the State of California aa well as of the city of Oakland,
and as well as counsel for the city. The matter will not go by default, as
nothing has in this matter as yet. This change would virtually amount to
a substitution of a military board of the War Department for the Supreme
Court of this State, and indeed of the Supreme Court of the United States."

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 9.
The members of the Central Christian
Church are trying to understand by what
method. If any, Rev. Edwards Davis kept
his accounts and those of the church. An
effort Is being made to find out how the
church stands, and some very peculiar In
cidents have come to light. Everything
was left to Davis and his secretary, H. E.
McGill, and now the officials cannot under
stand how much they are worth or how
much they owe, or whether they are
worth anything or are heavily in debt.
The last supposition Beems to be the most
probable.
After the pastor's marriage, when he
left the. church, Jonn W. Metcalf. one of
the trustees, went through the books, but
being a professional musician and not pro-
fessing to know anything of bookkeeping
ivix. Metcalf made a report that was far
more favorable than the books show in
reality, although Mr. Mutcalfs report is
justified by the superficial appearance of
the accounts. From Mr. Metcalfs report
a call was extended to Rev. Dr. Sawyer
of Montana, offering him $100 a montii
and $100 for traveling expenses. Mr. Saw
yer accepted, and then began the task of
collecting tue money shown to be due
from the church members. Much of the
money is eald to nave been already paid
but until Mr. Davis explains his compli
cated system of financiering the church
believes that there is a deficit of $300, al
though it is possible there may be a bal
ance in the treasury. The trustees simply
cannot tell.
Mr. Davis frequently, when pressed by
his creditors, would give them an order
on Mr. McGill, his secretary, and in thiw
manner must of Mr. Davis' debts were
paid.
As a way out of the difficulty, it is pro
posed that the Central Church unite with
the First cnrlstian Church, and by only
having one pastor and one building to
maintain it is believed that finances will
be relieved and the joint organization be
kept free of debt. Treasurer McGill is in
possession of some notes aggregating $130
signed by Mr. Davis, and he has made
frequent efforts to collect. He does not i
feel any too kindly toward his late pastor,
and should an investigation be made a ,
surprise may be developed.

The remark attributed to Eslabe is: "Tfiey

FIGHTING THE
BIG MONOPOLY
Supervisors Consider the
Mutual Electric Light
Co. 'a Petition.
P. B. Cornwall Says He Only
Asks the Same Privilege
Granted Others.
ThÂ» Matter to BÂ« Taken Up in Com
mittee of the Whole Next
Tuesday Night.
Considerable hostility was shown to the
electric light company that Is trying to
break the monopoly now enjoyed by the
Son Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany at the joint meeting of the Streets
and Street Lights committees of the
Supervisors yesterday. Supervisor De
vany presided, and Smith, Brltt, Rivers,
Clinton and Morton were present.
A number of interested parties were
present. Including a large delegation
from the Merchants' Association and
Messrs. Cornwall and Summerhayes of
the Mutual Company.
The meeting was called to consider the
resolution Introduced by Dodge two
weeks ago, asking the Mutual Company
to state what was necessary in the way
of extending its service to enable It to
compete for the contract of lighting
public buildings and certain outside dis
tricts, and calling on the Gas Inspector
for a map showing the location of every
gas and electric lamp In the city. In
spector Taylor was present and stated
that he had no such map and could not
prepare it without going to considerable
expense.
P. B. Cornwall, in response to a re
quest from the members, said the first
resolution passed by the Supervisors
granting permission for the erection of
poles and wires was to the California
Electric Light Company in 1881. That
was followed by an ordinance giving the
Edison company the same right. Other
ordinances had pince been passed giving
telegraph, telephone and street railroad
companies the same privileges, to which
no exception was taken. The Mutual
Company had laid its wires underground
within the fire limits, and it now asked
to be granted permission to erect poles
outside the fire limits. It did not ask any
privilege that had not already been
granted to other corporations, or on so
large a scale as others had been favored.
Clinton asked what it cost the city for
electric lights at present, and it was
shown that the San Francisco Company Is
paid $120,000 a year.
Mr. Cornwall said his company guaran
teed to save the city at least $40,000 a year
on the present cost, and he would* put
up the best bond ever offered to the Su
pervisors for 1100,000 or any other amount,
to insure its fulfillment. He said his com
pany would also save private consumers
$60,000 a year on the present cost, making
a total saving of $100,000. There was no
way a competing company could enter the
field except by erecting poles in outside
districts, for it would be far too expen
sive to put wires underground in the resi
dence portion of town.
Devany and Britt, overlooking the pro
visions of the pending resolution which
called for the very information they de
manded, wanted to know how many poles
It would be necessary to erect, and if the
company was prepared to give the In
formation right there. Mr. Cornwall re
plied that he was not prepared to answer,
as the resolution had not yet been passed
railing for the Information, but If gfVen
until Tuesday he would give all the In
formation required.
Clinton moved that the resolution be
adopted, but there was no second to the
motion, and Mr. Cornwall said his com
pany only asked to be granted its con
stitutional privilege. In answer to Smith.
Britt and Devany, who insisted upon
Cornwall giving the information, though
they opposed the resolution calling for
it, that gentleman said he thought it
would not reuire more than 140 poles to
extend his service when necessary.
A petition from the Merchants' Asso
ciation was then read. It asked that gas
lamps be abolished and all the streets
lighted by electricity, reciting the efforts
of the association in that respect and the
good results accomplished. A. S. Bald
win spoke on behalf of the association
and submitted the maps Inspector Taylor
had not been able to prepare.
After Mr. Baldwin had concluded, Clin
ton moved that the whole matter be sub
mittf-d to the board Monday, and con
sidered in committee of the whole Tues
day night. The motion was carried.

drich, who as brakeman on the Berkeley
local trains for years past, has become
known to nearly every man, woman and
child of the university town, has received
word from Washington of his appoint
ment as Treasury Agent for Alaska, to
have charge of the salmon industry. The
appointment was made by President Me-
Kinley several days ago, and will doubt
less be ratified within the coming fort
night. Mr. Aldrich will probably start
for Juneau about May 15 or 20, where his
duties as Treasury Agent will keep him
busy during the fishing season from May
to September.
For eighteen years Mr. Aldrich has been
in the service of the Southern Pacific
Company, in the various capacities of
brakeman, station agent, conductor and
telegraph operator. For years he was
territorial freight agent of the Hunting
ton system in Mexico for the states of
Chihuahua, Durango, Coahiula and Zacat
eeas. For three years he held a lieuten
ant's commission in the Mexican gendar
meria, which honor he obtained through
the offices of his uncle, General Shafter
In his varied travels and experiences he
has become quite a linguist and speaks
fluently five different languages
Four years ago Aldrich was transferred
(at his own request) to the Berkeley local
line as brakeman. He began to study law
in his spare hours, and after three years
of study he was admitted to the bar in
August last. Berkeley commuters and
college students riding daily on lha trains
came to know the big and jovial brake
man, and the announcement of his ap
pointment to a Federal position of trust
has caused the greatest pleasure among
"Jim" Aldrich's host of friends.
THE HARBOURNE SHORTAGE.
Expert Davis Finds That It Is Con
siderably More Than Had at
First Been Stated.
ALAMEDA, April 9.â Expert Davis, who
has been engaged for some time In exam
ining the books of the public library for
the purpose of determining the amount of
ex-Librarian HarLourne's shortage, has
completed his task and made his report
last evening to the Board of Library Trus
tees. The full report has not been made
public, and a special meeting of the board
will be held on Tuesday evening next to
receive and discuss it. It is understood,
however, that the report will show a
totol shortage of about $2000. instead of
the $1000 or $1100 originally claimed. An
amazing feature of the affair is that
forced warrants are found for as small
suras as $1 50, $1 25 and $1.
ATHLETIC DISPUTE SETTLED.
BERKELEY, April 9. -The athletic dis
pute between California and Stanford
over the bicycle race was settled to-day
by an arbitration committee appointed to
adjust the difficulty. The race will take
place in San Jose on Wednesday, April 20.
Manager Melville Dozier of California
insisted on having the bicycle race on the
Wednesday before the Intercollegiate field
day. Manager T. T. C. Gregory of Stan
ford wanted the race on the same day a.s
the field day. The managers could not
agree, the faculty athletic committees
could not agree, so President Charles P.
Eells appointed a committee to arbitrate,
as provided in the recent arbitration
treaty between the two universities. Mr
Eells appointed Samuel Knight, Hall Mc-
Allister and A. J. Dibblee, and they de
cided In favor of California's contention.

THE GREATEST OF ALL TALISMANS.
A charm (also called a talisman .or amulet)
possesses the power to protect Its possessor
against any evil and promote his luck, happi-
ness* and' health. 1 This power it obtains from
its manufacturer, who from and through her
(supernatural power transmits the same to the
talisman.
A charm can be made ' for â  any purpose. It
may serve as. a protector on a journey or at
home, against accident or evil Influence, which
It destroys; it may- guide you â  safely through
any perilous enterprise,'- may help you to com-
plete your business transactions profitably. In-
suring -you against loss, and thus assist you to
acquire wealth.
It may be of a mesmeric â drawing
others' affections toward you and j thus secur-
ing for you friends among strangers, and even
converting enemies into friends . and bringing
esteem, love and friendship from all.
It may possess a healing power and cure
diseases by its simple application.
THE MAGIC BELT
Contains within Itself the virtues of several or
all other single charms â  combined, â  and Is the
most powerful talisman . that has â¢ ever been
made.

tion which you do not and cannot obtain until
you find your true vocation.: " . â¢
If you are contented with your present work
you have found your true vocation and success
will attend you; but If dissatisfied, and all Is
going against you. it -Is an evidence that you

course to pursue in life. . Her descriptions of
your friends and enemies are as real as though

FOB A NINE-HOUB DAY.
Printers Will Begin Their Aggres-
sive Work To-morrow.
To-morrow it is expected will be marked
by a crisis in the strike of the printers.
The men decided to wait a week before
making any aggressive moves, and the
majority of the employers were of the
opinion that at the end of that time the
men would willingly come back to the
jobs they left behind them. The first
distribution of strike funds will be made
to-morrow, and it is expected that this
will greatly encourage the men. Tho
union already has a good supply of money
and within another week funds from thÂ»
International will arrive. Assistance has
also been promised by every other union
in the city, but the officers of the union
do not think it will be necessary to call
for outside aid. It was reported yester
day that many of the employers had
made overtures to treat with the men as
Individuals, or as chapels, and the pro
prietors report that men have been mak
ing overtures to them. Both of these
statements are contradicted by the op
posite side, and while each claims ad
vantages, the situation appears practi
cally unchanged. A special meeting of
the union will be held this afternoon to
discuss the situation and decide upon the
amount of strike funds to be distrib
uted.
A meeting of the Brewery Workmen's
Union was held last night, and that body
tendered its heartiest sympathy and un
qualified support to the striklne orint
ers. The brewers are maKing prepara
tions for their annual picnic which will
e T n .? ld in Harbor View Park on the 17th.
John Monohan, a pressman in the em
ploy of Hicks-Judd, applied to the police
last evening for permission to carry a re
volver. He claimed that he needed pro
tection against injury at the hands of
striking printers and pressmen. The per
mit was granted.
PACIFIC MASTIFF CLUB.
It Rescinds the Resolution of Seces-
sion Passed Last Month.
The Pacific Mastiff Club held a meeting
last night, the consequences of which will
be fraught with importance to the Pa
cific kennel world. After a heated and at
times acrimonious discussion the follow
ing resolutions were passed rescinding
the action taken on March 10, at which
time the club seceded from the American
Kennel Club.
The club resolved to offer the medals
and trophies for competition at the San

Judge Cook decided yesterday that J.
B. Olsen, a stenographer. Indicted on a
charge of having sworn falsely to a de
mand on the city treasury for services
alleged to have been rendered In Police
Judge Low's court, must stand trial for
perjury. He overruled the demurrer to
the Indictment for perjury, but sustained
one Interposed to a second indictment

Cook held In the latter case that the de
mand having been indorsed In good faith
by Judge Low on Olsen's affidavit could
not be fictitious.
INSPECTION OF
HIGH SCHOOLS
Professor Brown Com
mends California's
System.
Is Efficient Although Nowhere
Recognized in the School
Law.
Declares, However, That the Plan
Is a Very Expensive
One.
Professor Elmer E. Brown, in a lecture
to a teachers' class at the State Univers
ity yesterday, gave an interesting expo
sition of the tendency on the part of
various States to establish a unified sys
tem of education. He said in part:
"The development of secondary educa
tion under the control of the State has
been attended with many difficulties. We
have seen, on tne other hand, running
through our educational history, a grow
ing demand for a complete ar.d unified
educational system. By this unification I
do not understand the subordinating of
the lower schools to the universities and
making them merely preparatory to the
universities. It is a unification which
aims at rendering complete every intrinsic
part of the system.
"We have seen that many high schools
have been established by municipalities
and by local districts. Though not pro
vided for by State laws, these schools
have been sustained by the courts. Yet
such schools, excellent though many of
them are, do not constitute a complete
State system of secondary education.
Such a system can only be attained by
statutory, provision for the establishment
of secondary schools, financial support
of thtm, determination of the course of
study, licensing and appointment of
teachers and the inspection of the schools,
all by the central authority.
"These conditions are as yet but par
tially realized. Our statutes have made
extensive provision for local control, but
they exhibit a strong tendency toward a
centralized State system. This growing
tendency is exhibited most strongly at
present in the Stales of Maine, Massa
chusetts, New York, Indiana, Minnesota,
North Dakota, California and Maryland.
"In Minnesota since the year ISBI therÂ»
has been a noticeable development toward
a centralized system. In that year the
Governor of the State, the Superintendent
of Public Instruction and the president of
the I'niversity of Minnesota were con
stituted a State High School Board. An
act of the State Legislature provided for
pecuniary aid to any preparatory school
offering free tuition to pupils of both
sexes from any part of the State. Two
conditions were imposed â that courses
should be given sufficient to prepare the
students for the University of Minnesota,
and that inspection of the schools by
State authorities should be permitted.
"One of the glories of our California
system is that provision is made for ex
pert supervision of the high schools. Ours
is, I believe, the most thorough system of
inspection to be found in any State, even
those that have the accrediting system.
"The system of visitation of high
schools by university professors is a very
expensive system, and, strange to say, it
is entirely unprovided for by law. The
arrangement is a purely voluntary one
between the university and the high
schools, and not a word can be found re
lating to it in the school law of California
from beginning to end.
"At present the various high schools of
this State are largely supported by local
funds. The State furnishes, approximate
ly, 45 per cent of the financial iud for sec
ondary schools, the rest being raised by
the locality. It is really surprising how
freely California communities have voted
to tax themselves to raise funds for high
schools."
TEACHEB ASPHYXIATED.
Miss Nolan of the Fairmount School
Dies From Gas Poisoning.
While preparing to curl her hair yester
day afternoon, Miss Celia Nolan was
asphyxiated by gas in her room at the
home of her sister, Mrs. Walter Tillman,
at 2939 Folsom street yesterday.
Mrs. Tillman left her sister playing the
piano early in the afternoon and went out
on business. She returned about 4 o'clock
and found the house full of gas, and on
investigating the cause discovered Miss
Nolan lying on the floor of her room, with
her curling-Longs by her side and one gas
jet open. Dr. Charles A. Clinton, who.se
wife was a sister of Miss Nolan, was
called, and arrived half an hour later, but
the young lady was dead.
Miss Nolan was a teacher in the Fair
mount School for a number of years, and
retained the position up to the time of her
death, but within the last year has not
been able to attend to her duties regularly
on account of ill-health. For the last few
months she had boen suffering from
nervous prostration, and had b^en grant
ed a vacation. Recently she had recov
ered to a certain extent, and told friends
that she intended to resume her work in
the school on Monday.
The young lady was subject to attacks
of syncope, and had often been found
lying on ....e floor in an unconscious condi
tion. It is supposed that in attempting to
light the gas in order to dress her hair
she fainted, and before sho could regain
consciousness the gas had accomplished
its work.
Miss Nolan was 27 years of age, and
besides her two sisters leaves an aged
father and mother, of whom the latter
will hardly survive the shock of her
daughter's death.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 9.â Operators In stocks
maintained a strictly waiting attitude to-day.
The extreme variation in prices reached a point
or over in a good many stocks and the market
took on some show of animation in the first
'' hour on the upward movement, but the purely
fictitious character of this advance was dem
onstrated by the relapse In the second hour.
The day's net changes are hardly perceptible
In many cases and show an indiscriminate
mixture of gains and losses. The market was
without any more significance than yesterday.
i The total sales of stocks were less than 100,000
j shares. The fact that, the London' exchange
j was closed left New York without the Initia
j tive from that quarter. London operators were
! apparently not eager to avail themselves of the
i opportunity of trading on' the New York ex
j change and orders by cable were of small
1 amount, though they were sufficient to aid the
i first hour's advance. The bank statement was
regarded as unfavorable, the movement of cur
rency to the interior having .apparently been
heavier than expected. It was expected that
I the Imports 01 gold would about offset the
i movement to the interior. Apparently some of
i the gold has -also been absorbed to meet- in
! directly the demand ot Interior banks; that is
j to lay it hits been deposited at the sub-treas
\ ury In exchange-tor currency transferred from
| Washington. : v
I Price* of securities are generally higher than
I they were a week ago. â¢ '1 he high prices of the
i week were made on Wednesday afternoon when
the announcement came that President Mc-
Kinley's message to Congress would be delayed
; until Monday. The first interpretation of this
action was that it boded further negotiations
i looking to a peaceful solution. Although the
i lurther negotiations have not developed a part
!of Wednesday's gains has been held. There
! has been much puzzled effort to account for the
j firmness of the market in face of the week's
i threatening developments and there has been
la disposition to ascribe some secret motive to
! the buying popularly supposed to be .on In
\ side Information from high financial sources in
;. Europe that Spain would be forced to recede
iat the eleventh hour. But it must' be said that
| the prevailing conviction in Wall street has
; become that war with Spain Is now inevitable
and still priws do-not go materially lower.'
Commission houses are authority for the state
ment that they have orders to buy on a de
scending scale. This condition stops the pro
fessional bears from operations on the short
side. On the other hand Wednesdays bulge
demonstrated that there is a supply of stocks
. ready to offer on any notable advance. The
market Is thus held in a sort of stable equi
librium by orders to buy below the present
level and orders to sell above it. Meantime the
amount of trading which Is invited is very
small.' The conviction Is unavoidable that prices
are near the level of the value for existing
conditions since' those who held stocks are not
anxious to sell and those who seek them are
not willing to offer more for them than pre
vailing prices. Prices Jell continuously -pre
vious to the Maine report in the effort to find
the true level and to discount that event and
its probable result. It is the invariable rule
that a prolonged price movement overshoots
the mark, resulting in reaction. There can
be no more convincing demonstration of a true
level of values than stagnation in the market.
There are varying opinions regarding the effect
of the actual presentation or the President's
message in Congress on Monday, both as to the
amount of liquidation which will be brought
out and the volume of short contracts which
will be covered. The prevailing belief is war
has been accurately reflected in the money
markets. The continued stiffness of time money
rates and the disinclination to make time loans
is called sentimental as there is no lack of
, money In supply, notwithstanding the large
demands of interior institutions for the purpose
of strengthening their reserves.
The bond market has been dull all week and
has moved in sympathy with stocks. United
States old 4s (regular) have advanced m, me
new 4s (regular) 1, the new 4n (coupon) % and
the old 4s (coupon) and the 5s ft per cent, and
the seconds have declined 1 per cent .in the
bid price. Â» - â¢ i .

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 9.~The Evening Post's
financial cablegram says: ' The money market
here was firm to-day. The discount rate has
rlsep to 2% on the German bank rate and
further cold sales. I learn, however, that
gold orders for New York were canceled to
day.
ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, April 9.â The Financier says:
The changes In the statement of the associated
banks of New York City for the week ending
April 9 were heavier than usual, but despite
the fact that the operations which brought
them about were of a nature to decrease the
oath in banks, the excess reserve at the end
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 10, 1898.
I of the week stood only J654.325 low^r than at
I the close of theÂ»previous week. -The largest de-
I crease was in the deposit item, which fell off
! 112.395i.900. The loss in deposits was due to the
j continued interior movement, and to liquida
tion in loons, although , the shrinkage of
$8,067,900 in this item was undoubtedly con-
I nected in part with sterling exchange trans
" actions by which the gold import movement
Is sustained. The higher rates for money have
I also operated to reduce the loan account, and
: every decrease counts since the banks are
doing very little business in -mercantile chan
i nels. The movement toward the interior as
i sumed heavy proportions through the sub
: treasury. The decrease of $3,789,300 In cash was
, even less than expected, but while the receipts
\ of gold for the current week were nearly $5,
! 000.000, the increase was but $1,320,800. The
bank which is the largest Importer of specie
I appears to have reduced its gold holdings over
I $4,000,000. and its deposits about $6,000,000, the
j latter being one-half the loss reported by the
sixty-five ciearing-n >uiÂ»e institutions. The
coming week will decide to a great extent the
future rates for money. Under present condi
tions the movement to the interior will con
tinue, and as the banks have been called upon
I for 10 per cent of the Union Pacific money now
] on deposit the Immediate outlook is for firmer
! money. On the other hand a pacific soluti m of
j the Cuban crisis means an abnormally cheap
j money market.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
' CHICAGO, April 9.â With the exception of a
little activity around the opening, trading In
Wheat was so dull as to be hardly worthy of
mention. There was a general Inclination
among traders to await Monday's developments
at Washington before committing themselves
very much, and this and the absence of any
Incentive in the way of. cable quotations con
fined trading almost altogether to a slow and
narrow scalping business. . The opening was
steady in July at 84%@S5c, compared with yes
terday's closing price of 84% c. There was evi
dently still some nervousness among shorts on
account of yesterday's heavy buying move
ment, but the demand from this 1 source soon
died away. Most of the speculators In the pit
were bearishly inclined on account of the
favorable crop reports from Ohio and Ken
tucky. As the Government crop renort on
Monday is expected to be favorable there was
I a little selling pressure put on the market for
a short time after the opening, resulting in a
decline to 84% c. This was removed and buy
ing stimulated. somewhat by New York advices
to the effect that foreigners were good buyers
there against liberal acceptances of yesterday's
offerings, and the Trice slowly recovered â to
'85c, the highest point of the day. After this
advance the market gradually sold off again
to S4ft@S4%c under realizing, and for the rest
of the session did not move Me either way.
September followed July closely In the matter
of fluctuations. There was a little revival of
interest in May, which has been practically at
a standstill all week, and a number of trades
were made in it at $1 06. a cent above yester
day's price. The option was': almost at a
standstill toward the close. July closed at
S4*siÂ§S4%c, a shade under yesterday's final
price. - v 'ft' ' "- . â -â¢â 
Corn was easier on a moderate amount of
trading. May closed He lower.
Oats were very dull and practically without
features of interest, May closed a shade low4r.
Provisions were steady within a narrow
range, the market ruling steady to the close.
May pork closed 5c higher,' May lard 2/2 c2 /2 c

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
the following coal deliveries have been made
here: Three from Washington, 4580 tons: three
from Australia, 7031 tons; one from British
Columbia, 4275 tons; one from Oregon, 4f>o tons;
total, 16.3;"6 tons. Light arrivals again this
week, still we have ample for" all immediate
requirements. Prices of fuel for family uses
have been let down somewhat; this is mainly
attributable to coal freight's weakening from
shipping points in Washington and British
Columbia, as they are now back to their nor
mal condition. They were advanced too rashly,
anticipating that fewer steamers would be re
tained in the coal trade; in this the owners of
sailers have been disappointed. In January,
when coal freights were marked up $1 to $1 25
per ton, colliery agents were forced to follow,
but the difference in their delivery prices here
to consumers left them no greater profit, as
the carrier received the entire difference.
Steam grades remain unchanged, as any at
tempt to mark these up would be checked by
offerings from Australia. Engagements from
Swansea are multiplying, thirteen charters

CHEMISTRY TO
FIND CRIME
Coroner Exhumes the
Body of Mrs. Vidal
Cervantes.
Analysis Will Tell Whether
She Was Murdered for
Money.
If She Was Poisoned tha Police
Will Â«t Onoo Makt
Arrest*.
The body of the unfortunate Vidal M.
Cervantes, a woman supposed to have
been murdered by slow poisoning during
the last days of March, was exhumed by
the Coroner yesterday morning at the re
quest of Chief Lees.
An autopsy was held at the Morgue.
The stomach, liver and other organs
wf-rt 1 removed and turned over to Chemist
Morgan for thorough analysis. He will
DOt No able to complete his Investigations
before Tuesday or Wednesday, us the
analytical process is slow.
News of tin- peculiar and suspicious
death of the woman was lirst published
In The Call last week. This caused a
great deal of excitement among the
friends of deceased as well as in the
ranks of her husband's friends. The
woman had been married but ten days
â when she died. Her husband and a
strange woman who lived In the house
with them were known to have adminis
tered the last medicines given. There was
undue haste about the funeral, for a
few hours after the woman's death her
new husband and the woman who lived at
the house were making arrangements for
thi Interment at Laurel Hill.
Mrs. Cervantes was Miss Vidal Mossa
until a few days before her marriage to
Cervantes. For a long time she had lived
With one Hans Neilson in Hinckley alley.
Keilsou soon discovered that bis mate
hud left him, also that she was drinking
heavily. When he investigated he also
learned thai some of her gold disappeared
u't'out the time .Â«he left him. He charged
that her clothing and jewelry were worn
by the strange woman at the house of her
husband, and this a few days after his
friend's iltath.
Without any loss of time Cervantes ap
plied for letti-rs of administration on the
estate. All these facts looked so sus
picious thai the police decided to leave no
Btone unt'irne.l in the search to ascertain
whether the Btomach and other organs
would show it poison had been adminis
ter, -il.
The polio? are keeping close watch of
the ease, and what they do will depend
; on the r. suits of the analysie now
being made by Chemist Morgan.
BOUGHT OUT THE FACTORY.
An Immense Purchase of Muslin
Undergarnu .s.
The New York buyer of The Empo
rium and Golden Rule Bazaar recently
bought the entire stock on hand of the
"William H. Burns Company, Worces
ter, Mass., the largest manufacturers
of muslin underwear in the United
States, at U5 per cent less tlmn factory
cost. The lot consists of 1400 dozen
garments, gowns, chemises, skirts,
(.â â¢â is.'t covers and drawers.
Mr. Burns in a recent letter to the
big Market street firm states that the
prices paid are simply ridiculous, and
that there are many rare and genuine
bargains in store for their lady cus
tomers. The goods are being marked
now, and will be on sale Monday, April
17th.
School Director Wallex's Case.
School 1 >irÂ«-ctor Waller was before
Judge Cook yesterday, expecting a deci
sion on the demurrer interposed by his
counsel to the indictment presented by
the Grand Jury, accusing him of having
solicited a bribe in his official position.
JudKv Cook said that he preferred to
have the law points involved passed on
when the three Judges of the depart
ments of the Superior Courts devoted to
the trial of criminal cases next sit in
bank. That course was satisfactory to
all the interested parties, and the case
accordingly went over until May 6.
A Meeting of Street Car Men.
A mooting of the representatives of the
different street railway companies took
place yesterday morning in the rooms of
the < 'hroniele building to question the con
stitutionality of the fender ordinances.

companies a number of attorneys were
it. The meeting, which was held

more than a general discussion of the
subject.

BERKELEY GIRLS BEAT SAGEBRUSH MAIDENS
14 TO 1.
BERKELEY has beautiful hair, which she wears In lon*, satiny braids
led with golden ribbon. Her blue sailor collar ends in a knot of gold,
iiere's a golden sash at her waist, golden strings lace her tennis shoeÃ,
.uiri there's a golden band Just bolow her left knee.
When Nevada came upon the field yesterday afternoon to be slaughtered,
she looked slight and youthful and childlike, but exceedingly graceful in her
loosely flowing bloomers and blouse of red, her dark stockings and low shoes, a
knot of gold at her belt and at her throat. She was greeted right royally by
Berkeley and the crowd of women that filled the Odd Fellows' Hall, and the
Nevada college yell went up from blue-and-gold beribboned. damsels with such
fervor that Nevada blushed and smiled with gratification.
Berkeley plays basket-ball with all her heartâ which is large. She leaps, she
files, she slides, she scrambles, and the ball is always hers. Her play is fast and
furious. There's an understanding between her captain and her menâ that is
to Bay, womenâ which makes the ball leap from one "blue" pair of hands to
another, as though it had been hypnotically wooed in the proper direction.
Berkeley has learned that there's a place for everything, and that the basket-ball
field is not the place for dignified demeanor. She's a child, an athlete, an en
thusiast here, and she's rightly a conqueror. Yesterday's game was splen
didly fought and fairly won. Every sM in the team had a share in the victory.
Nevada is a bit timid. In her innocence she fouls without intending it or
knowing her crime when it has been committed. She's slow when compared to
th^ .Â«wift alertness of Berkeley. She knows she is handicapped by the fact that
individually and as a team she's younger and less experienced than Berkeley.
She's had no coach. She's never played a game of basket-ball outside the com
forting precincts of the Reno University gymnasium. She's had no training,
and though she plays with all her might, her efforts don't score because of the
lack of co-operation. Captain Brownsill and her stanch lieutenant, Miss Robin
son, who threw nearly every goal Berkeley scored yesterday, are the Castor
and Pollux of basket-balldom. They are two souls with a single thought, and
that thought keeps thrusting the yellow ball forever up and against the coy
1 asket. Berkeley has a guard, Miss Haworth, every inch of whose seventy
inches is worth its weight in blue and gold. She towered over her little, fair
haired Nevada rival, and she watched over the enemy's side of the field so
well that it was a speedy and cleverly thrown ball that escaped her three-foot
jump.
Nevada was outclassed, outplayed, well beaten. But she is true to her repu
tation for sagebrush pluck in fighting desperately till the last, ignoring the
"Iâ2â3 â I--.,â oâ7â &â 9â loâ llâ l2â 13â 14" counted out with remorseless delibera
tion by triumphant Berkeley, and retaining her good-humor under circum
stances that might try veteran contestants.
More accomplished rooters than the Berkeley girls It is impossible to im
agine. They sang, they howled, they stamped. They distributed college yells
generously, impartially. Never a point escaped their vigilant eyes and mouths
It didn't matter whether it was a flying red dash or a whirling blue dot that
caught and threw the ball. Immediate fame, loud-voiced and reiterated, was
the lot of the victorious one. "Good girl, Nevada," was the serious commenda
tion that floated down in a well-trained chorus from the gallery. And when
Berkeley threw a goal you should have heard the "Ha. ha. ha! California.
U. C. Berkeley, Zip! Boom! Ah!"
The spectators were informed that Miss Rued was all right, and were ques
tioned as to what was the matter with various other misses, but when the
game grew warm and despite Nevada's good throwing the ball was kept and
held about Berkeley's goal, "Good girl, Bessie! Good girl. Sarah!" replaced the
more formal cry, winding up in a rapturous ode to California and Berkeley
that Nevada was tempted to join inâ had she been as well drilled as those who
sat open-mouthed, flapping their arms like wings beneath the blue-and-gold be
rlbboned baton of the pretty leader.
But the enthusiasm above was no greater than that on the field. When Ne
vada scored that solitary one the gallery was alive with the waving of handker
chiefs, the "Wall! Wah! Wah! Nevada!" of the sweet-voiced rooters the ex
cited, bent-down faces of the crowd. And below in a jiffy Nevada had broken
into red-bloomered couples waltzing rapturously in the few moments' interval
before the whistle sounded again. As for Berkeley, when Miss Robinson's fine
goal-throwing brought point after point to the California team, lithe Captain
Brownsill flew at her lieutenant and gave her a lightning hug before she flew
again after the ball.
The hall was prettily draped with red and gold on one Fide and blue and *old
on the other. The referee. Mrs. Magee. wore a red silk waist and a dark blue
skirt with a golden belt, that no one might question her disinterestedness And
for the same reason the umpire. Miss Merritt of Stanford, appeared in blue
bloomers and red sweater with a big "S" in the center
"I tell you. you Berkeley girls can play." panted a perspiring girl in red
when both teams trooped off to the dressing-rooms
thÂ«"viof O r teU yy Â° U> yOU ' V Â° madC US Play harder than w<? expected," responded

With wild whooping, blowing of horns,
shooting of blank cartridges, frantic
handshaking, carrying of heroes around
on broad shoulders, waving of parti-col
ored banners and other emblems, and a
surging and jostling that give the great
throng a kaleidoscopic appearance on ac
count of the gay colors in the drosses
of the female contingent, six records
were smashed into smithereens and ona
r-stablished at the eighth semi-annual
field day of the Academic Athletic League
at the Olympic Club grounds yesterday
afternoon. The brawn of the Oakland
High School carried her cerulean colors
to victory, with Berkeley a close second,
and Ukiah third. Henley of Ukiah estab
lished a new record in the running high
Jump, clearing the pole at 5 feet 9 inches
in an exhibition Jump after putting his
opponents out at 5 feet 7Vi Inches. Fred
Estes of the same institution defeated
the renowned Plaw of Booue's Univer
sity Academy, with a throw of 149 feet 1
inch, the latter making a top throw of
only 148 feet 2 inches, though last year
he established the record at l(it> feet 3
Inches. The first record broken was
that of Finne, V. H. S., 2:00 1-5, in the 880
yard run, by Harris, O. H. S., in 2:05 4-5;
the second, that of Cutler. L. H. S., S:O2Va.

race, by O. H. S., 3:24; that of Cooley, O.
H. S., 5 feet 9 inches, in the running high
jump, by Henley, U. H. S., 6 feet 9
Inches.
Protests on claims of fouling were made
by Elder in the mile walk and McLean
in the mile run. The ref< re*, William
H. Humphrey, A. A. U., saw fit to al
low neither protest, as it was clear that
the fouling was accidental and did not
interfere vith the nnai result. McLean
took the dc-cision with bad grace, and
afterward used insulting language toward
the referee.

official score, resulted as follows:

LOST IN THE
CHILCOOT PASS
Two Vietime of the Big
Avalanche Disaster
Well Known Here.
They Were Mrs. James Harri
son and Her Brother-in-
Law, C. P. Harrison.
Brother and Sister-in- Law of Po
lice Officer William Har
rison.
Among the many victims who per
ished while attempting to cross the
Chilcoot Pass, as told in yesterday's
Call, were C. P. Harrison, a brother of
Police Officer William Harrison, and
Mrs. James Harrison. The latter was
the wife of James Harrison, who ia
well known in this city and who is at
present in Dawson City.
Several months ago James Harrison
left this city for Alaska. He left his
wife here, promising to send for her as
soon as he reached Dawson City. Sev
eral weeks ago Mrs. Harrison received
a letter from her husband, in which he
stated that he had struck it rich and
asking her to join him at once. He
also wrote to his unfortunate brother,
describing the wonderful resources of
the frozen north and begging him to
accompany his wife in the hazardous
trip.
After thinking the matter over Harri
son consented to make the journey
with his sister-in-law. They left here
a short time ago and stopped over at
Seattle, intending to take the first boat
for Alaska.
Last night Police Officer Harrison
was officially notified of the tragic
death of his brother and sister-in-law.
On- being told of the sad occurrence
Captain Spillane at once granted him
a short leave of absence.
"This is sad news indeed, tearfully
remarked the brother of the deceased
man. "He confidently expected to ac
quire considerable wealth in the Alaska
gold fields, and I believe he would have
succeeded except for his tragic ending.
Jim left this city some time ago, in
tending to send for his wife as soon as
he had located a claim. The last letter
we received from him announced that
he had struck it rich and asking his
wife to join him. He expected that
Charley would accompany her, as it
was agreed that he shoul â '. do so. They
left this city several weeks ago thor
oughly satisfied that they would have
a hazardous trip, but earnestly hoping
to reach Dawson City.
"After reaching Seattle they wrote
me that they were ready to embark on
their perilous journey and promised to
let me know just as soon as they
reached Dawson.
"The sad occurrence will greatly af
fect by brother Jim, as he was very
much attached to his wife. I intend to
do all in my power to get possession of
the bodies, but from the present reports
it may be very doubtful. However. I
have already communicated with the
authorities of Alaska with a view of
securing the remains of my dead rela
tives."

Sub-Contractors Unable to Get What
Is Due Them on the New Mis
sion High School.
The contractors who have undertaken
the building of the new Mission High
School met with the Buildings and
Grounds Committee of the Board of Edu
cation yesterday to devise some plan
whereby the contractors can get the
money due them. The contract for the
building was awarded to the Ray Build-
Ing Company, which in turn sublet con*
tracts to various people. The Ray Com
pany has been paid about $RO,000," nearly
half the amount of the contract price,
but has failed to meet its obligations to
the subcontractors. There is ample
money on hand to complete the build
ing, and the committee is willing to pay
the subcontractors idrect to complete
their work, but" they are clamoring for
the money already due them from th*
Ray Company. The committee could
see no way to arbitrate between the con
tractors and the company, and it was
finally decided that the contractors should j
make another effort to get their money j
from the company and meet the com
mittee again next Tuesday.

JRev\ E. H. Yovmarv

Christ rose from the dead." But

what is known to the business
- world as sleeping partners. Si
lent partners are nut the kind the Lord is looking for.
They're the kind that will be looking for the back doors
of heaven. These want to go to heaven, but they
haven't courage to walk up the front way. We talk
these days <>f heroes.
The greatest of obstacles of God's work is cow
ardice. Men lack courage of conviction. God can't use
cowards. A Christian must be a hero, filled full of bat
tle. Of course the world will cry: "There goes a fa
natic."
People condemn excitement in religion. It is only
religious fervor. There is more excitement this day on
Wall street than in a church in twelve months. The
reconcentrados have more to do with war than you or I
â why should we not help them? If we can put ten
thousand bushels of corn in Cuba we will be doing well.
The least we can do is to pray.
We'd better send some money along with our pray
ers. Send it as a pledge of our faith in prayer. There
must be law. When law is established penalty Is sure
to follow. God never attempted to run the universe
without law. The penalty for breaking his law is
death. Jesus Christ went to the tomb to pay this very
penalty for us. God accepted this son as our ransom,
but if we continue to sin we pay a penalty.
I get drunkâ my leg is crushed. It must come off to
save my life. God forgave my drunkenness, but he
does not give me a new leg.
See how a man buys a piece of land. People settle
about it and he calls for a hundred times what he gave.
He boasts: "I did that; I made myself a millionaire."
There'll be no hundred per cent made on salvation.
It won't go up in price, but you've got to come down.
God knows every heart.
Be you a mother bowed with sorrow â be you the
patient wife, the troubled father, the sister, the brother
or the loving friend who sends the message to the great
white throne â God is never too busy to listen. Your
voice is never too weak for his ears. You arn't such a
sinner but God can save you. The impossible Is within
his power. Nothing Is too great or too small for his lov
ing hand. He reaches down to the lowest depths to
save the soul weary with sin's burden.
I like to pray with hard cases: with unbelievers and
scoffers. The victory is all the greater and proves the
greatness of my Master's love.

Of Âur dead? What is the destiny of our mortal bodies
and of our immortal spirits? These are questions which
press their way through Easter lilies and anthems and
ceremonial rejoicings.
When Christ lived and Paul preached the prevailing
belief was that the body would be raised from the dead.
Against this the pagnns railed. They denied the resur
rection of the body. This belief rested upon an old and
well-grounded tradition. It was not confined to the He

that the resurrection is to be spiritual, not physical,
and that out of the decayed organism is to issue a new

Death, to Paul, is evolution; the bursting of the bud
into the flower; a step upward and onward. It is de

evolution of a life. Longfellow voices it in the words:
"There is no death; what seems so is transition."

REV. W. A. GARDNER,
CHRISTIAN CHURCH.
The Bible sayÃ it is because of sin. .
The introduction of sin into the^vorld was Satan's
first victory. He was determined to mar the image of
God in man; to bring sorrow, woe and death to the hu
man race. Death was the devil's greatest helper and
man's greatest dread. Thrones, cities and mighty em
pires were destroyed through his agency. He snatched
the infant from the arms of loving parents and brought
anguish into every home. Just as man was ready to
live death dragged him down to the grave. In the dis
tress of its hopeless environment, humanity cried out,
"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?" In answer to the cry of
his dying children God sent his son to deliver them.
The devil called to his aid death and determined to de
stroy the Redeemer. He made several fruitless at
tempts, but at last on the cross he hears the dying
groans of his victim, and as the aun is darkened and
the earth riuakes all of his friends of hell shout "Vic
tory!" But the battle is not ended. Jesus had said,
"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it
up." On the morning of the third day after his death
a few timid, weeping women are whispering, "Will he
rise?" the wondering angels repeat the question,
"Will he rise?" and the scoffing devils in hell hiss,
"Will he rise?"
Suddenly the earth again quakes, not with sorrow
but with victory. The guards about the grave become
as dead men. The door of the sepulcher opens and the
triumphant king comes forth alive. "Hear, O ye na
tions'. Hear, O ye dead! He rose; he rose; he burst
the bars c-f death and triumphed o'er the grave."
"He is not here; for he is risen, as he said." â Matt.
xxviii:6. Angels announced the birth of our Lord; they
also announced that he .had
risen from the dead as he said
he would rise. There were many
the other Mary saw him alive. He appeared unto fe
ter; unto the two disciples on the way to Emfciaus;
unto ten of the disciples; unto the eleven, Thomas be
ing present; then unto five hundred at one time.
They did not expect his resurrection. The sight of
their eyes compelled belief. Seeing Jesus alive made
them joyful and strong. Convinced of his divinity they
lived and suffered and died In the faith.
Said that great teacher and student of history. Dr.
Arnold of Rugby: "I have been used for many years
to study the history of other times and to examine and
weigh the evidence* of those who have written about
them; and I know of no one fact in the history of man
kind which is proved by better and fuller evidence of
every sort than that Christ died and rose again from
the dead."

world, the grim tyrant was
conquered and conquered in his own stronghold â the
grave. Accustomed to his prey, he had spread his
dark wings over the tomb of Christ and claimed even
him. His boast, hoAvever, was brief, for within that
tomb there lay the body of one who had said by his
prophet, "O death, I Will be thy death," and by an
other prophet lie had represented himself as "Free
among the dead."
Hence at the dawning of the third day of which he
had so often spoken, with power divine he laid aside
the shroud and bands and arose glorious and im
mortal, his glorified body passing through the rock of
the burial cave as light permeates a clear crystal.
Down from heaven came an angel, who rolled back
the great stone from the mouth of the cs,ve and
Bhowed the world that the Savior's tomb was empty on

fair and noble should be smitten with death; that all
things beautiful should fade and die, is a mystery that
has wrung the heart of man with agony. But death is
to be destroyed, and, though it be the last enemy to be
conquered, its overthrow will be final and complete. It
will not be merely the slaying of an enemy, but the re
taking of lost possessions.
2. The resurrection is also the divine pledge to his
people that nothing shall be lost. The vino that in
Labrador grows only a few inches, when transplanted
to a summer clime shoots forth and bears fruit. The
present life, too meager for our hopes, too fleeting for
our plans, too brief for our ambitions, shall be com
pleted yonder.
3. The resurrection is a divine balm for the sorrow
ing heart. It tells us that death is but a sleep and the
grave only "a dark lattice letting in eternal day." It
tells the believer not to weep as those who have no
hope.

a miracle, we say, but the continuous existence of the
church of Christ based on that fact is a more wonder

The resurrection of Christ makes it certain that
there is no break in the continuity of our existence, in
passing from the earth life to the intermediate life. It

on the White House Lawn.
EASTER Monday In Washington
is an event in the lives of the
children which is ahead of any
other day in the year excepting
Christmas and Fourth of July.
Why? Because Easter Monday means
egg-rolling. For many years the little
ones of Washington have congregated
by hundreds of thousands to roll eggs
Easter Monday in the beautiful grounds
surrounding the home of the President
of the nation. There is no sign to keep
off the grass and there are no restric
tions. T%e children own the place. The
green grass of the White House lawns
Is covered with children, children in
numerable, rolling eggs on the grassy
slopes.
If the day is pleasant It is a sight to
be remembered. The children have been
looking forward to the festival for days
and weeks and gre~t has been their
anticipation. But genuine is the sorrow
and many the tears among the little
ones if Easter Sunday should be cold
and rainy with promise of a bad Mon
day. Yet no weather has ever been so
bad as to keep every one away from the
White House grounds on egg-rolling
day. There are many hardy little spirits
who will not be daunted by snow or
cold or rain when it comes to rolling
eggs.
But if the day is pleasant and the air
balmy and the turf warm and green,
what a time the children have. Such
games as they invent to be played with
their eggs â rames of infinite variation
and containing infinite amusement. The
grounds 100., more like a juvenile fair
than anything elseâ an egg fair and
the biddy hens around Washington
must needs have been very diligent for
many days before. If the day is fair,
too, the glorious Marine Band, the
finest band in the country, plays sweet
music and the children dance and gam
bol to its strains. Truly it is children's
day in Washington.
By 9 o'clock in the morning the
grounds are actually taken possession
of by the youngsters, little kids with
wicker baskets and vari-colored eggs,
wonderful eggs of green and blue and
red and purple and gold and then eggs
of lorely combination, and with beauti
ful figures, uch as would make a wise
hen cock her head on one side and
wonder greatly what had happened to
her plain white eggs.
All sorts and conditions of children
find their way to the President's
grounds to enjoy an Easter Monday.
Some of the children are beautifully
dressed in silks and laces and have
French nurses to watch o cr them and
carry their eggs for them, while other
little ones are dressed In very shabby
garments with elbows out and toes
peeping from their little shoes. They
perhaps have only three or four plainly
colored eggs boiled in a piece of purple

or red calico. Mo T^rench nurses accom
pany them, carrying eggs with gilt
pictures, but they can roll their eggs
and themselves on the green grass and
soil their frocks and trousers to their
hearts' content and they will enjoy the
holiday as much as their more for
tunate companions. Usually the moth
ers of these little men and women come
with them, tired-faced women, per
haps, looking as though it had been
many a long day since they had en
joyed such a time. Here and there are
little groups of mothers and older sis
ters, talking together pleasantly, but
keeping watchful eyes to see that the
little ones do not get lost in the crowd
or stray too far away.
It is a good-natured crowd. The big
policemen standing around possess no
terror for the little ones on egg-rolling
day. They know that all big policemen
are for on Easter is to keep big reople
from interfering with little ones who
are rolling eggs. And when the little
people get lost now and then the big
policemen are there to t.ke them In
charge and tell them not to cr - until
their mothers or sisters find them
again. And there are great rivalries
among the children. Some of them ara
regular little gamblers. One little fel
low gets hold of a very hard egg- and he
goes around pecking eggs with his ac
quaintances or acquaintances he finds
and wins their eggs from them until
finally he strikes some <->tv.f>r little fel
low who has a harder egg than his, and
then he loses a lot of eggs.
And some of the little rascals gamble
pn what is a sure thing, with a china
egg, sized and painted to resemble a
genuine egg. or with a hen's epg run
full of plaster of paris they will go
around, and. of course, win all the eegs
they contest for, until some sharp fel
low finds out the game they are play-
Ing. As the day advances and the chil
dren get hungry the peanut man and
the popcorn man and the candy man at
the gates do a thriving business, while
at noon many are the little groups un
der the trees, sittin- around on blan
kets and shawls and eating lunches, for
they are making a regular -icnic of it
and staying all day.
President Harrison's two gTandehil
dren witnessed, with great enjoyment,
the egg-rolling, from the porch of the
White House fncing toward the Wash
ington monAm^nt and looking past and
across the Potomac to Arlington, the
former home of General Lee, but where
now are spread the silent tents of a
vast host of the Unicn army who have
parsed across to the great beyond.
President Cleveland's two little girls,
Ruth and Esther, were real little dem
ocrats. They took their own eggs and
went out among the crowd of happy
children, and they roiled eggs with the
other children, as common clay as their
associates, not the children of the Pres
ident of the United States, but the chil
dren of an American citizen. Perhaps
a little extra watch was kept over
them, but they didn't know it and they
thought that Easter Monday was the
happiest day of their little lives.
There was a time, however, when the
children of Washi: ton did not roll
eggs in the President's grounds. Not
that they did not roll eggs, though, oh
no! They have always rolled eggs on
Easter Monday. But "they used to roll
them in the Capitol grounds, down the
steep terrace which was on the west
front of the Capitol. Then there came
a time when the Capitol grounds were
changed and a big flight of steia* were
built where the terrace used to be, and
somebody objected to the children
romping on the smooth grass of the big
sward and rolling their eggs.
General Hayes was President then,
and he heard of it, and how disappoint
ed the children were because they had
no place to roll their eegs that year,
and he said: "Why let them roll their
eggs on the White House grounds and
enjoy themselves." And thus it has
been ever since, from year to year.
Easter service in Washington calls'to
the minds of some of the oldest inhabi
tants, the Easter Sundays before the
war, when Sunday service was held in
the National Hall of Congress. ,
The Rev. W. 11. Milburn, the blind
chaplain of the United States Senate,
remembers the time well, for he has
himself preached in that hall on Easter
Sunday. Dr. Milburn's service in the
Government dates back, perhaps, far
ther than that of any man now occu
pying a public position. Before John
Sherman, now the venerable Secretary
of State, came to Congress: before old
Senator Morrill, once a leader in that
body, but now bent and feeble, and be
fore hosts of others who have grown
gray in the Government harness, en
tered upon their -first official duties,
Doctor Milburn opened the Senate
each morning with his prayer of thanks
to God and his plea for almierhty pro
tection and guidance in the conduct of
the affairs of the nation.
Fifty-two years ago it was when he
rric'ide his first prayer on such an occa
sion. That was when the Capitol build
ing presented a far different appear
ance from the Capitol of to-day. That
was before the massive wings of white
marble were added and when the Sen
ate met in the room now occupied by
the Supreme Court, and the House of
Representatives in the Statuary Hallâ
the old Hall of Representatives where
Easter service was celebrated.
There were two chaplains, just as
now, one for the Senate and one for the
House, but they exchanger] duties, so
that each body of Congress had, at dif
ferent times, the services of each chap
lain. Then, too. in those old clays the
curious custom prevailed of keeping the
Senate clock ten minutes ahoad of the
House clock, thereby enabling one
chaplain to open both houses of Con
gress, first officiating at the House and
then going to the Senate and making
its opening prayer. Thus ono chnplain
could take a long vacation, and return
ing. aJlow his colleague a like privilege.
"Yes, there have been great changes
in the nation,"' said Doctor Milburn,
shaking me by the hand and looking
directly at me with his sightless eye*
balls, "great changes since the time
when I first officiated as chaplain of
the Senate of the United States. in
those days, each Sunday in the Hall of
Representatives, one of the chaplains
held reeular Christian service and no
minister preached to more distinguished
congregations. Senators, members,
heads of departments and even Presi
dents w^re frequent or regular attend
ants. Many a noted public man was
found in his seat on Sunday morning as
promptly and regularly as during the
remaining six days of the week.
I well remember that John Quincy
Adams was always present. Great and
distinguished iand attentive w^re
the congregations. This custom,
however, of holding Sunday ser
vice in the Capitol was discon
tinued during the War of the Rebellion.
The new wings of the Capitol were
completed at this time and the Sen
ate and the House moved into their ele
gant and commodious quarters, and
with the move the custom of Sunday
service died.
"I well remember, too, my first Easter
service in the Capitol â over half a
century ago; and a half century such
as the world has never before seen; a
half century in which the nation has
made greater progress in many ways
than all the rest of her life. Let us
hope the most of it has been for the
good of the world and Christianity.
"You wish me to say something ;)hout
Easter. Well, there Is much we know
about it and much we do not. The
subject and the various customs con
nected with it are involved in so many
ancient traditions and legends that
much Easter lore approaches very near
to the domain of mythology and fairy
tales. There are several events which
are celebrated by the people of different
lands at about the same time, and ob
servances have become somewhat
mixed.
"Easter Sunday, commemorative of
the resurrection of Jesus from the
tomb,- is in many respects the most im
portant as it is the most beautiful Â«^f
the festivals of the Christian churcff.
You will see by a prayer-book that
Easter is always celebrated on the first
Sunday following the full moon which
happens next after March 21.
If the full moon occurs on Sunday.
Easter Is the following Sun lay.' The
manner of thus ~g the time for the
celebration was only settled after a
long controversy in the early centuries,
which caused great feeling.
"The celebrat. m of the feast of the
Passover and that of Easter have been
practically merged into one. It is only
a coincidence that the Jewish Passover
festival and the Christian Easter fall
on or about the same date. In the
French 'Paques,' the Italian 'Pasqua'
and the Spanish 'Pasena.' all meaning
'Easter, 1 we have an unbroken lineage
to the Hebrew 'Pesach.' or 'Passover.'
We have the historical fact that Christ
was crucified at the feast of the Pass
over. A. D. 32.
"Now came the first trouble in the
observance of anniversaries. The first
generation of Christians, having been
members of the Jewish church, nat
urally continued ,to observe the Jewish
festival, although it now contained a
new meaning- for them, and they made
it commemorate ,n actual event rather
than a shadow or promise. In this
somewhat changed and modified per
petuation of the Jewish Pesach, or
Passover, Easter was then called the
Paschal Feast. The death and resurrec
tion of Christ were, of course, settled
points, lut the date upon which the
event was to be observed was not flnal
ly fixed without a long and bitter
struggle. The Jewish Christians
thought that the observance of Easter
should be immediately following the
anniversary of the exact date of the
Passover, without regard to the date
of the week or month. The Gentiles,
however, knew that Christ had risen on
Sunday, and they held that, therefore,
Sunday should be celebrated as the
resurrection festival, without regard to
the date of the month. The church of
Rome, in 147 --\. D.. decided in favor of
holding the observance on Sunday.
"But there still remained the more
difficult question as to what particular
Sunday should be celebrated, and this
point was not settled for several hun
dred years. Easter Is not a fixed fes
tival like Christmas. Sometimes It
conies in April and sometimes in
March, depending on the date of the
full moon following the vernal equi
nox. It was necessary, in addition to
securing its general observance by all
churches, to have its time exactly ob
tainable, as upon its occurrence de
pends all the movable church feast
and fast days through the year. The
nine Sundays previous and the eight
Sundays following Easter are all de
pendent upon it.
"Like many other questions of creed
and religion which were finally fixed
and about which we do not now have
to bother, it was the cause of great
trouble and bitterness of feeling in the
early centuries. I may not perhaps
be very generally known that there
are millions of people in Eastern Eu
rrââ¢> nnd Asln nnd Africa who are de
vout â¢Christians â as devout, as any in
the world, but. -who do not agree with
the Roman and Protestant Christians
upon a point of creed which, though
a comparatively minor consideration,
separates them almost as widely as
are Christians from pagans.
"These people of whom I speak in
clude the followers of the Greek
Church, or the Eastern Church. In
the early centuries, when the center of
Christianity was first at Jerusalem,
and. after the destruction of that city,
at Alexandria, Egynt, there was but
one Christian church. Later, however,
a discussion arose as to the power of
the Pon of God. One faction contended
that the Son and Father had equal
power: the oTher that the Father was
all-powerful. Over these two conten
tions ultimately arose strifes and
struggles and fip^lh- -Â»at wars.

TRAINING HORSES TO FIGHT I N OUR CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY
WITH all this talk of war prep
arations It seems strange
that so little has been said
or written about that most
Important adjunct of our
military, the cavalry, j-. 1 should the
seat of war be Cuba the cavalry would
really play a very important part in
the fighting. Therefore it is Interesting
to know just how our gallant troopers
are getting themselves in readiness.
The horse is just as much a part of
the army as the man who rides and
guides him. And when he Joins the
army he has to be thoroughly recon
structed. We have heard a great deal
of late about making big guns and buy
ing warships and turning out projec
tiles and strengthening our fortifica
tions, but never a word about breaking
in horses for the cavalry. Go out to the
Presidio or any other Government post
if you want to see how superbly the
animals render themselves in practice
work.
The animals, you know, must be
thoroughly trained in war tactics. The
greatest patience is necessary in this
operation, and as each army post
breaks its own horses, one man con
nected with each post, who is specially
fitted for the work is assigned to that
duty. A man who is liable to lose his
temper could never train an army
horse in a thousand years. It requires
the greatest tact and perseverance.
Those of you who have seen a mod
ern cavalry drill must realize to a cer
tain extent the amount of patience re
quired in breaking in a horse for that
sort of work. The animal must not
only learn to stand steady under fire
and in the midst Â« f flashing sabers, but
he must know how to turn at just the
right moment when the bridle is hang
ing loose over his mane, how to lie
down and get up and a score of other
minor details which are combined in
his complete education.
And all of this must be drilled into
him slowly, patiently and by degrees.
For. according to an authority on the
! subject, a horse has really very little
natural Intelligence. The expression
"horse sense" consequently loses much
of Its significance.
A Presidio otlicer, In speaking of the
horse the other day, said: "A horse has
no sense. That is. very few of them
have. They are essentially creatures of
habit. Once you make them under
stand -what is expected of them, and
make them realize that they must do
ttiat thing, and they will never forget
it."
That is the whole secret of breaking
horses for the cavalry.
The horses are brought raw from the
West. Your cavalryman would rather
have an animal that has never felt the
weight of a saddle, for he claims the
raw material is better in the lonp run
for his purpose than the civilized pro
duct.
Upon bis arrival at the nrmy post the
new recruit is stabled with the other
horses. fl" is probably travel sick
from the effects of his long ride on the
oars. The first thing to do is to get
him in good physical shape and make
him feel at home amid his new sur
roundings. He is shy. and everything is
strange to him. lie is just like a new
boy at school.
After he has been thoroughly rested
he is taken out into the paddock some
morning and given his first lesson in
cavalry tactics. The initial instruction
is in kneeling and lying down. In or
der to make him understand what is
required of him a simple arrangement
of harness is used.
A surcingle is placed around his belly,
to which are attached two iron rings,
one underneath and one at the horse's
back. Straps containing rings are also
placed about each foreleg just above
the hoof, and another strap is placed
about the head just above the nose. The
officer in cljarge is supplied with two
long ropes, by moans of which the horse
is rendered quite at the mercy of his
instructor.
One rope is fastened to the ring on
the right leg, extends up through the
ring on the surcingle under the horse's
belly down to the ring on the left leg
and back again through the surcingle
ring. The other end of the rope is held
by the officer. The minute the horse
begins to show a fractious spirit a
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, STTKPAY, APRIL 10, 1898.
! strong pull on the rope brings him
down on his knees.
The other rope passes on the right
side of the horse from the ling just
above the nose to that in the surcingle
:at the horse's back. A pull on this
' brings the animal's head around close
I to the right shoulder, and he is power-
I less. A pull on both ropes at once
' will cause him to lose his equilibrium,
' and down he comes on his left side.
A few repetitions of this, admlnis
j tered in such a way as to demonstrate
| to the horse that he is entirely at the
i mercy of the trainer, and the first les
i son is over. The horse is taken back
â¢ to his stable, often without the stroke
of a whip. In some instances, how
! ever, it is found necessary to apply the
; lash with discretion.
The next step is to mount him. A
light snaffle bridle is adjusted, and
while the horse is on the ground the
officer hands the ropes holding the anl
mal in check to one of his men. Then
they are slackened, and as the horse
attempts to struggle to his feet the of
ficer leaps on his back.
With a snort of surprise the equine
recruit jumps and rears. Another pull
on the ropes and down he comes again
to the turf, the trainer leaping from
him as he falls. He lies there tremb
ling; a few softly spoken words, a gen
tle caress, and it is tried all over again.
Finally, the pupil, who has previously
learned to realize that he is powerless,
gets used to the weight on his back
and doesn't mind it.
The greatest shock to his nerves is
yet in store for his horseship. This is
in getting accustomed to firearms.
While the animal is down on the ground
i the officer takes a pistol and fires it
i close to his ear. Then in rapid order
! he fires the weapon over his back, un
der his neck, between his legs, any
where that an opening presents itself
during the horse's futile struggles. Not
until he sinks back exhausted, all
a-tremble and showing the whites of
{ his eyes does the pistol practice cease.
After two or three lessons of this
I kind it is considered safe to mount him
! with a bridfe furnished with a curb bit.
1 Up to this time the horse has never
felt a curb. The light snaffle is still
retained and the curb bridle is only
given a gentle pressure at firstâ Just
enough to let him know that it Is there.
Gradually the strength of the pull is
increased, and with this safeguard the
horse is taught to stand fire from ais
rider's pistol or carbine.
i In carbine practice the horse must be
thoroughly broken, as both hands are
required in using this weapon, whereas
with the pistol the rider may retain the
bridle with one hand.
Then comes saber practice, and that
is another trial tQ the horse. Again is
he thrown to the ground, and he prob
ably can't understand why he should
have to suffer this indignity all over
again, for he has learned that lesson
very well. But when the bright blade
of the saber, with quick thrusts flash
ing before his eyes and cutting the air
in close proximity to his ears, appears
to him, he is again terror stricken.
But the lesson he has learned from
the smell of gunpowder stands him in
good stead, and he soon gets over his
fear. And even with a man on his back
and another mounted on a seasoned
horse coming at him with saber raised
in the air or slashing left and right, he
knows that it is all a part of his educa
tion and something to be expected. So
he stands his ground or cavorts about
the other horse, while the two troopers
indulge in th^ir saber practice.
With his instructions in jumping, the
new recruit's education is nearly com
pleted. He is drilled in what is known
as large jumping, that is to say, he 19
placed in a shoot, with two high fences
converging toward a gate. He is still
kept in check by a long rope, held by a
man outside the fence.
Two other men run at his flanks with
whips, and in - Jer to escape the lash
he is bound to jump. If he does not go
over clear, the rails are tied up. and at
the next attempt he comes a cropper
on the tan bark, landing in a heap.
The next time, with the whips behind
and the fear of another fall before him,
he clears the bars like a bird.
After a little practice of this sort, the
horse knows just what he has got to do,
and then a man mo .ts him. With the
extra weight the jump is made lower,
and he eventually takes his final degree
as a full-fledged cavalry horse.
WAR SIGNS IN THE STARS.
Our Country's Horoscope Says There Will Be Peace.
THE oldest of sciences is prob
ably astrology. No other can
boast such an illustrious list of
names among its believers and
exponents. It was the favorite
study among the Egyptian
priests in the days of Pharaoh and
Rameses; we are told that Moses
taught and professed it, independently
of the gift of prophecy.
Solomon did not consider himself too
! wise to learn from the astrologers, and
1 David owed his escape from Saul, at
i the time when the latter was coming
i to besiege him in Keilal, to their ad
| vice. The Magi, or wise men, of the
! Persians were astrologers, and the re
. markable future which the science
; foretold for the youthful Mohammed
j (which was fully realized) made it a
I religious institution among the fol
l lowers of the prophet of Mecca,
So much for the past of astrology.
1 Most persons, no doubt, believe that it
!is to-day an obsolete science. Such is
| not the case. There are at present in
i New York City nearly a dozen as
j trologers, soothsayers, star readers or
j horoscope casters, as they variously
I elect to call themselves. There are
others scattered about in various parts
of the country, and altogehter the pro
fession seems to be in a flourishing
and prosperous condition.
It certainly is not without its devo
tees. The headquarters of the best
known New York astrologer is lo
cated in one of the Park row sky
scrapers. This seer occupies a suite
of offices equipped with desks, type
writers, telephone and all 'the para
phernalia of the modern business es
tablishment. A procession of clients
keeps this astrologer busy all day
long.
Astor, for this is the astrologer's
name, does not look like an exponent of
ancient occultism. He has a business
j like manner and might easily be mis
taken for a broker or a lawyer. There
is no suggestion of hidden mysteries
| about his workshop; ev.rything is
I plain, modern and commonplace.
The spectacle afforded by the seer
dictating the mystic lore of 5000 years
I ago to a modern graphophone may
seem a trifle incongruous, but it merely
goes to show that astroloe^, as prac
ticed at the present time, is strictly up
to date.
One of the business uses to which his
skill is put was shown by the recent
city election in Philadelphia. One of
the candidates for the City Council was
a Mr. Byram. On looking over the
firround. after hia nomination. Byram
made up his mind that the chances
were against his election. He decided
t<> work a new wrinkle. So he called
in the services of astrology, and during
the remainder of the campaign his ac
tions were under he constant direction
of the planets favorable o his cause.
Byram was elected. The politicians of
the Quaker city were willing to fight
.such ordinary evices as jobs, deals and
combinations, but when it came to
bucking against the stars in their
courses they gave up the battle.
With this imposing array of prece
dents, from Moses of Palestine to By
ram of Philadelphia, it is interesting to
know what answer astrology gives to
the absorbing question of the day: Will
there be war between Spain and the
United States? This problem was pre
sented for the consideration of Astor a
few days ago.
After carefully studying the existing
astrological situation the prophet con
structed the accompanying "war map "
which clearly proves to the initiated
that, while there is considerable vexa
ASTROLOGICAL WAR MAP OF THE UNITED STATE* '
tlous trouble in store for Ppain and the
United States, .hich may lead even to
a "clash of arms," there will be no war.
To those who are not familiar with
the symbols of astrology the diagram
may seem a trifle obscure, and a word
or two of explanation is necessary.
Briefly, the astrologer bases his" pre
dictions on the positions which the
different planets occupy at a given
time in the belt of the Zodiac. Each of
the planets indicates a certain tendency
which may be favorable or otherwise.
Likewise each of the twelve signs of
the Zodiac relates to certain subjects.
When the relations and influences of
the different members of the two
groups are known the prediction be
comes a comparatively simple mat
ter.
The reckoning is made from the sign
Aries, which stands, in the present In
stance, for the United States. Spain
is represented by Gemini, which, in
spite of some disturbance, is governed
by distinctly peaceful influences. This
indicates that Spain, however she may
bluster, is really anxious to preserve
peace, and will endeavor to do so. The
governing powers of the United States,
on the othsr hand, are symbolized by
Capricornus, which has at present a
decidedly bellicose attitude, with Mars
in the ascendant."THESE THREE WOMEN ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TYPES OF
LOVELY WOMANHOOD IN FRANCE. ENGLAND AND AMERICA".---Carolus Duran.
Carolus Duran, the Great French Painter, Who Has Just Come to This Country, Declares That the Typical Beauties of America, France and
England Are Miss Jennie Leiter of Chicago, Comptesse Pourtates and the Countess of Warwick.
CAROLUS DURAN, the great
French painter, who has come
over here to immortalize the
features of our American beau
tiea on canvas at from $3000 to
116,000 a canvas, has declare.: it the
throe typical beauties of Ami-r: â >, Eng
land and France are, respectively,
Miss Nannie Letter of Chicago, the
Countess of Warwick of England and
the Comt< urtalea of France.
He does not say that they are the
LUtiful women in the world,
but that they are the most beautiful
women he has painted. As he has for
nearly thirty years devoted his talent
to transferring to canvas the great
ladies of Europe and those fair Ameri
who have visited Paris and could
afford to pay his prices, his judgment
is not to be despised.
When the New York reporters who
Interviewed him secured this modern
Judgment of Paris from him he gave
also a long list of beautiful women
whom he has painted. Among them he
mentioned Mrs. Will Crocker, whose
full length portrait was accorded the
place of honor at the Loan Exhibition
of Portraits held at the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art two or three years ago.
Put she is not one of the three t >â  ; â  i â¢ lI
beauties whose portraits we here re
produce.
Miss Nannie Leiter, to whom the
great French painter has assigned the
honor of representing the land of lib
erty in this trio of national beauties, is
the second daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
L. Z. Leiter of Chicago. She has but
recently made her debut In Washing
ton, and though her beauty has
brought the young men of the national
capital sighing to her feet, she herself
is as yet one of the happy women who
have no history.
The Leiters, hi ..-ever, are sufficiently
remarkable to make up for -liss Nan
nie's present comparative insignifi
cance. The old gentleman mad" his
money in dry goods and in real estate
ppeculation In Chicago, and when his
eldest daughter was of an are to come
out his spouse assail ~d the citadels of
New York. P.u her millions could not
batter down the gates of i's exclusive
ness, so she hied herself and her daugh
ter to Washington and was soon in the
thick of I*.
Then her eldest daughters beauty,
for Miss Mary Leiter is one of the
handsomest women America has pro

THE DUEL IN THE AIR
A TALE OF ALASKA

DASHED TO THEIR DEATHS.
Frightful Fate of Two Packers Who Fought
a Duel on the Cliffs Above the Pass.
9KAGVAY. via Seattle. March 28, 1398.-The
lonp lino of packers parsing over the trial this
morning were appalled and horrified at one of the
most thrilling ami awful sights that have yet been
witnessed in this land of startling incidents and
For* one solW hour two men of powerful pjtar-
Blque fought a frightful battle on the brink of a
precipice two thousand feet above the seething
water* In the canyon below. On a narrow path
carved from the mountain side, scarcely wide
e-.iough for two to pass, the two men met and
fought tike fiends in plain view of the hundreds of
nun who lined the trail on both sides of the sum
mit as far an the eye could reach.
They clinched ami with arms of steel each hem
the other In death's grapple. In a frenzied struggle
they neared the outer edge of the trail and swayed
upon Its brink until strong, sturdy men along the
line grow sick at the sight and tumi-d their heads
away. "My God," cried one man way down tho
trail "why don't some one separate them?"
No one paid any attention to him; all eyes were
riveted on the two swaying figures, a gnm silhouette
against the Arctic sky. No one tried to reach tnem,
no one dared, no one could. Strong hearts stopped
beating, brave, fearless men shuddered, but the
light went on.
The suspense was awful. No hand moved, no
voire was raised, save now and then wfien a groan
went down the lino as the two men would balance
on the brink of the precipice, and then fall back
â gainst the Inner wall of the trail again.
Suddenly the form of one was lifted in the air
by his adversary. The latter, with a prim, exultant
smile, moved toward the edge, cautiously balancing
the the dangling form of his foe above his head.
Nearer and nearer he approached the brink of the
yawning chasm, and as if. to make one final effort
he leaned far back, and, as he did so, a clump of
earth broke away from the outer rim of the trail,
point' grnvel stones flew Into the air. an awful oath
broke the dead silence, and the two men fell head
long Into the abyss below.
A little way beyond their packs were fo.und. and
from all the evidences gathered It was established
beyond a doubt that the two men had deliberately
repaired to the fatal spot to fight their duel. The
cause of the Quarrel could not be ascertained.

PARJ I.
On a bright, crisp morning during the month of
October, IS6T. the folds of a Russian flag rose and fell
In the sky above Alaska. At the foot of the staff from
which this tlag was hung a Russian soldier stood on
guard. Just back of -where this soldier was stationed
tm the side of the hill which makes a gentle slope to
the pea, and at the foot of which the town of Sitka
lies, there stood In wonderment a little band of Alaska
Indians.
They were not of one breed, but a mingled lot of
many tribal fragments, as it were, of the once great
and powerful hyperborean group.
Their chief, Pon-a-wauk by name, was Indeed a
magnificent model of his once magnificent race. He
belonged to the tribe of the Koniagas. who formerly
occupied the extreme western territory of Alaska
bordering on Bering Sea. Their close proximity to the
shores Â«Â»f Siberia brought about the mingling of their
blood with that of the Russian inhabitants residing in
that portion of the Russian Empire. This In turn
brought about a speedy obliteration of the original
race, leaving only traces of them here and there. Don
a-wa.uk was a fair sample of that mixture, his mother
being a full-bloÂ«nied Koniaga, his father a Russian
trader, or promishlenik. belonging to that sturdy class
of navigators who were first to open up the fur trade
in Alaska. Don-a-wauk, as his speech will show, was
a "Mission Indian"; in other words, an educated In
dian, one who had not only mastered the English
language, but who hart studied and acquired the power
of graceful and vigorous speech. He was Instinct
ively an orator. His voice, manner, gesture, intona
tion and expression of face contributed to that strange
force which captivates and sinks every uttered word
into the heart.
Don-a-wauk's early environments had much to do
no doubt in bringing nut this latent passion for flowery
words, which came to him naturally from his Asiatic
ancestors.
Advancing from the group of Indians with a slow
and deliberate step, Don-a-wauk approached the
Russian guard and said: "Why are all these flags
floating? Why are these many soldiers here? Why
does the (Governor chief pack his belongings?"
The guard made no reply. "You will not speak?
You wi'l not answer my questions? Why? Why will
you not speak? My people would like to know. I,
their chief, would like to know what this all means?"
The unbending soldier still made no reply, so
Don-a-wauk returned to the Indians on the side of
the hill and from his manner ajid gesture It was plain
to be seen that he was very indignant at the treat
ment accord*nl him by the soldier.
As he was thus engaged In explaining the Incivil
ity of the Russian soldier to his group of Indians an
officer of the United States army appeared. It waa

surroundings, Lieutenant Coffin again saluted the

wauk approached him. and put the same questions to
him that he had asked the Russian. To this the lieu
tenant's reply in substance was that there was noth
ing of any consequence about to occur, and the officer
started to go.
Don-a-wauk intercepted him and* said: "But I
know there is something. Red Legglns came to the
mountains and told me. I left my berries and llsh
and game and traveled in my canoe all night. Rod

in our peaceful harbor. Many armed soldiers have

it all means? I, their chief, would like to know.'

J>ART 11.
Some time during the year IS6O Baron O ran off,
who was the Russian Governor of Alaska, journeyed
to St. Petersburg fur the purpose of laying before the
Czar the necessity of committing a larger number of
exiles and convicts to Alaska that they might be em
ployed in the construction of wharves, forts, other
improvements and fortifications of the Territory.
It was about this time that Iskander Hertzen, one
of the leading spirits of the society of anarchists
known as Decembrists, flourished and exercised
a great Influence among his followers. Among them
was Louise Solovleff, sister of Ivan Solovieff, who at
tempted the life of the Czar in 1879 by thrice firing
at him from behind the gates which led to the palace.
While there appeared no outward manifestations
of this society until 1566, when Tchernishevsky was
arrested and Hertzen fled to London, they were nev
ertheless subjected to the strictest surveillance, and
one evening in the month of October, 1860, their place
of meeting was raided by the officers of the Czar, and
among the persons taken wa.s Louise Solovieff.
The next day when Louise appeared before the
Commissioner of Police, Byon Oranoff was present.
She was young and beautiful then, so beautiful,
Indeed, that when she entered the room of the Com
missioner the baron looked upon her with eager and
covetous eyes.
The baron stood well at the court of Alexander
11, and when a few days afterward he suggested to
the Emperor that Louise Solovieff would be much
safer in Alaska than Siberia the Czar pretended to
see the force of the suggestion, and when the ship
that carried the baron back to his castle at Sitka left
the port of Odessa, on the third day of November,
1860, Louise Solovieff was among the list of exiles and
convicts transported. to Alaska.
For a time Louise resented the proffered and pro
fessed affection of the baron, but after a while shÂ»
softened toward him, became reconciled to her fate"
and, yielding to the force of an unalterable destiny'
she consented to the liaison.
A year went by, and she bore him a son, a bright
little fellow, just turning six at the commencement
of this narrative. She called him Ivan, after her
brother, and while the baron did not relish the Idea
of a son of his carrying the nan.. Â°' Â» ?â¢Â£Â«, "ââ Â£

It was during her absence on this occasion that
an event followed which forever destroyed tlie^ooir
woman's happiness. It came about as fo ,lloÂ«s. WÂ£en
Commodore Rogers, in 1854, divided his forces and
.carried on his explorations among the Aleutian Is
andÂ« the coast of Kamschatka and the Arctic
Scan north of the Bering Strait. Captain Prim , from
Portland. Maine, was assigned to the waters of the
far north. In the fall of that year, his ship was
wrecked, and but for a tribe of Indians along the
northern coast he and his crew would certainly have
Per d pon-a-tauk was the name of their chief and
he had a daughter, 11-la-hie by name. a most beau
tiful and charming creature. Captain Prim havng
shared with the chief his lodge until the following
spring grew very fond of 11-la-hie, and 11-la-hie grew
very fond of him. At his request, and by the consent
of the chief, she accompanied him to one of the mis
sions along the southern coast, where she attended
school. Later on she entered a convent in Canada,
and grew to be a most accomplished woman. Subse
quently she became the wife of Captain Prim, and
bore him a son. Their home foT a year past had been
at Sitka. The captain, who was now in the employ
of the Government of the United States, had gone on
an exploration of the interior of Alaska, and during
his absence his wife made the acquaintance of Baron
Oranoff. The result of that acquaintance can best be
told in the following continuation of this story.
As Don-a-wauk stood with his back to the side of
the hill and his face to the sea he did not notice
the approach of Louise. She called him twice, but he
did not answer. She then hurried past the Russian
guard, who had stood all of this time apparently ob
livious to the passing incidents around him, and gently
laid her hand upon Don-a-wauk's shoulder.
"Louise!" he exclaimed in astonishment.
"Yes," she replied, "I returned this morning ; tell
me, Don-a-wauk, what does this all mean?"
"Sold like dogs," answered he. â  "
"What do you mean?" â'
"Mean! We are Indians, dogs, convictsâ Â«
sold."
"By whom?"
"The Governor Chief."
"Tell me, Don-a-wauk, what do you mean? Tell
me all; I have been away. I have not seen my hus
band to talk with him since my return. He is engaged
in some strange enterprise. I know, but he will not
tell me. If Don-a-wauk knows. I believe he will."
This appeal loosened the tongue of Don-a-wauk,
and thus he spoke:
"Your husband has sold this country, and 11-la-nle
has sold her people.
"11-la-hie!" exclaimed Louise.
"Yes, she of the musk ox eye?, radiant and
beautiful. She has betrayed her race for the silk of
the worm and the jewels tHe Governor Chief has be
stowed upon her."
Louise knew that the Indian would tell his story
in his own way and In his own time, and while she
was consumed with anxiety and fear and impatient..,
she concealed her agitation and calmly told him to go
on.
"Last night," said he, "I came. Red Logins, swift
of feet, ran to the mountains and told me to come
quick. I came. Last night I watched the castle. I
saw the Governor Chief leave the castle and cross to
the house of 11-la-hie. She came out. They walked
to the long bridge" over Indian River, beyond the Mis
sion School. I follow. My ears not hear, but my eyes
see. The Governor Chief beg 11-la-hie to fly with him.
She refused. He ask again. A long time were they
there. Then like lovers they come back. I fear there
something wrong. I know now. Soldier captain just
tell me. Your husband has sold this country and Il
la-hie has sold her people. They will fly together.'
The truth sank deep into the heart of Louise.
"My God, Don-a-wauk!" she cried. "He will not
leave me and the child here alone?"
"He will throw you to one side like that," replied
the Indian, with an accompanying gesture.
At that moment there was a distant sound c?
marching feet, and looking up both Don-a-wauk and
Louise saw the approach of what appeared to be a
procession.
"Come quick," said Don-a-wauk. "You will soon
see that what I have told you is true."
They both retired up the hill where the little band
of Indians stood, and the procession entered.
. At the head came a guard of Russian man-of
warsmen; abreast of them a company of American
soldiers. Then followed Brigadier-General Lovell H.
Rousseau, the Commissioner appointed by Andrew
Johnson, President of the United States, to carry out
the terms of the treaty made March 29. 1567, through
which the Territory of, Alaska was ceded by Russia
to the United States for the sum of $7,200,000. By the
side of General Rousseau was Captain Pestchouroff.
the Commissioner of the Imperial Government of
Russia. Then came Major-General Halleek and Ba
ron Oranoff, the new and retiring Governors. Follow
ing them came several battalions of American and
Russian marines.
After the invocation Captain Pestchouroff, advan
cing a step, addressed General Rousseau as fallows:
'General Rosseau, by the authority, of the Imperial
Government and In behalf of his Majesty, the Em
peror of all the Russias, I hereby transfer to the
united States Government, through you, the duly
accredited and authorized Commissioner, all the ter
ritory which formed the Russian Colonies of the
Northwest of the American Continent."
_ General Rousseau, advancing, replied: "Captain
Pestchouroff, on behalf of the' President, sanctioned
by the people of the United States, I accept the trans
fer under and by the authority vested in me by the
Secretary of state."
As the Russian ; flag descended it became entan
gled in some way at the trestle-trees of the staff, and
so great was the consternation- and feeling of fore
boding evil from , the incident among the Russians
that many of them wept.
Captain Pestchouroff collected himself, however,
and. as the Russian flag finally descended, he said:
"General Rousseau, the Territory of Alaska is now
transferred to the â  Government of the United States.
All the . forts and military posts are now delivered.
Also, the public edifices, such as the Governor's
house, the buildings used for Government purposes,
dockyards, barracks, hospitals,- schools, public
grounds and all free lots! in Sitka. Kadiak and other
stations are hereby delivered : to your Government."
General Rosseau was about to reply, when there
was a commotion among the soldiers; some kind of a
struggle had occurred, and before any one could as
certain the cause Don-a-wauk had; pushed his way
through the crowd and now stood in the center of the
hollow-square. His eyes flashed, his lips" trembled
his hands shook, but for all this he was dignified and
deliberate, and controlled his emotion sufficients- to
thus address those around him: i" -

HOW TO SUCCEED
AS A MINISTER.
*i Believe a .Minister's Duties Divide
Themselves Under Two .Heads ; .His
Work, as a Preacher and as a
Pastor ."â By Dr. John 'flail.
Wi:AT 1i ministerial success?
Not the attraction of a
crowd, nor the awakening of
admiration for an "elegant
preacher,' a "brilliant speak
er," a "splendid ore-tor." What is a
minister? An embassador of Christ, be
seeching men to bo reconciled to God
through him. The success is to be
measured by the extent to which this
reconciliation is promoted.
Buppoee that tho Spanish Government
sent an embassador to Cuba to beseech
the rebels to be at peace with Spain,
ar.d the embasssdor was described as
"eloquent," "brilliant." "very interest-
Ing." in his address to the rebels, and
by them, yet they held on In their rebel
lionâ could he be described as success
ful?
This article, as I understand it. Is not
to deal with the choice of the ministry
as a profession. The young men to
whom it ia addressed are supposed to
have settled that momentous question
In the affirmative. They desire now
only the few suggestions that experi
ence ran give to inexperience as a,
guide in their life work.
A minister's duties divide themselves
under two headsâ his work as a preach
er and as a pastor. Neither one should
be emphasized to the neglect of the
other. Some men succeed in the for
mer field and fall in the latter, or vice
versa, but to make his efforts effective
for the promotion of God's truth the
minister should labor assiduously In
both.
As a preacher the minister Is called
upon to prepare and deliver sermons to
his congregation. In this the first thing
to determine Is his range of subjects.
On this point Christ has explicitly di
rected us, "Whatsoever I have com
manded you." To the appreciative stu
dent of the Bible this Is sufficiently
definite, and rules out many themes
that have found their way into the
Christian pulpit.
The central figure of all Bible teach
ing, the most effective that the preach
er cati present, the one he is especially
enjoined to herald is the Christ.
This should be his constant theme.
IK is to lift up Christ, to set forth his
saving work as finished on the cross,
and to show that while he is Prophet,
to bo our teacher, and King to rule
over us, it is by his atoning death that
we have lite through beiie*ing in him.
This is glorying in the cross.
This presentation of Christ implies
the setting forth of God's attributes as
holy, just, merciful and faithful, man's
sinful condition, and it Implies obliga
tion on men, when they believe in and
love the Savior, to keep his command
ments. And so true evangelical
hing is the divinely given means
for producing good ethical results â for
promoting morality.
This exhibition of Christ's saving
work is to be presented in reliance on
the Holy Spirit, not in one's genius,
persuasiveness or earnestness; and
then, when souls are saved and
brought to confess Christ, the glory is
given to him who opens the eyes,
creates anew in Christ, and Is, in the
!ife of a believer, the spiiit of holiness.
It may be objected that this preach
ing of Christ puts away variety from
the pulpit and produces a dull same
ness In the sermons. If hearers are
simply looking for entertainment, for
â 'sensational" talk of "the times," they
will sympathize with this criticism;
but if they attend church to worship
God, and be taught of Christ, they will
find variety in the teaching, for In the
history of the race from the opening
chapter of Genesis through the Mosaic
economy, the history of the Hebrews,
the works of the prophets and all the
New Testament, Christ, the Savior,
and the godliness that comes through
faith in him. are more or less clearly
set forth, and that in beautifully varied
aspects.
There are many useful points about
the preparation and presentation of
pulpit discourses, but most of these the
young man will hear fully discussed In
the course of his special preparation.
No scientific knowledge, no classic, no
learning, no human truth comes amiss
to the preacher, yet there have been
many men with '"little Latin and less
Greek" who have mightily influenced
the lives and aspirations of their fel
lows toward the kingdom of God.
The bent cardinal rule I can think of
is to know your Bible (the English
version) thoroughly. Know It so well
that you can draw readily on it for apt
quotation to enforce and emphasize
your points. "When it enmes to utter
ing a grand truth or voicing an eternal
warning, the language of the bouk is
more forcible, more convincing, sticks
more firmly in the mind of the hearer,
than any you can command.
The tone of the preacher In his pulpit,
In my opinion, should bo positive, not
argumentative. We are not philoso
phers finding out things; we are exposi
tors of a revelation that settles things.
When Jesus said, "I am the way, the
truth, the life; no man cometh to the
Father but by me," he spoke positive
truth, which it is our business to echo

during which time the Indian stood defiantly, as If
waiting for an answer, Baron Orano-ff stepped for
ward and said:
"This is no time or place for such harangues."
Don-a-wauk looked at him contemptuously and
replied: "What time or place could be better? You
have sold our country, Indians and all; you speak of
houses, buildings and forts, but not one word of the In
dian. You," he continued, pointing to the baron,
"came many years ago when we were strong, and you
promised the Indian much. When you came you said
you would build us sawmills, schoolhouses and
churches. You said you would teach us how to use
the soil for food as well as the sea. You taught my
people how to drink fire water, that is all. Indian
drink until his head is lost, and then he make bad

â  The baron grew angry at this, and, approaching
Don-a-wauk in a threatening manner, said:
"Don't you make such charges against me, you

Don-a-wauk looked down upon him. "You are a
very brave man to call Don-a-wauk dog, when Don

of them said a word. By the side of Louise stood her
boy. The awful suffering of the mother seemed to
influence the child, for he was weeping bitterly and
clinging to her hand. Louise had passed that stage

The only sound that broke it was the moaning of the

needs to be especially reminded of. It
is the side of his work that he is likely
to hoar and to think least of during
his period of preparation.
To fill the requirements of his place In
the congregation, the minister must
know his people. How is he to know
them? Obviously the best way to make
their acquaintance is to go to their
homes, to see the family where the
family lives, and converse with them
in the freedom of their own homes. He
may direct this part of his work as hia
special situation makes it seem best,
but he should go among his people as
much and as often as he can.
Any ordinary minister who Is to do
spiritual good to his people must love

whose hearts you have looked.
All this will make the pastor a better
preacher. A man tells you of his life,
his sorrows, perhaps his sins; his lip

of a minister's nature in you. you must
feel and speak to that man evermore

It may be added thnt the life of a
preacher is to be in harmony with the

his walk and conversation that the
message he carries is true to himself,

"Yours?"
"Yes; he would go with his father." cried Louise,
exultantly. With this she kneeled by the child, and
spoke in tender, reassuring terms. She told him he
was to go with the sailors to his father, and she would
follow. She dried the child's tears and kissed him
again and again. When the sailors reached the shore
and approached her, she told them that in anticipa
tion of their coming she had brought them the child
of 11-la-hie. The unsuspecting sailors took the boy
without further inquiry.
Louise and Don-a-wauk stood and watched. The

Louise saw the boy of 11-la-hie. "Where Is my

Louise looked down upon the poor deserted, moth

That night the storm came, and the wind blew.
Away up on the mountain side the dim rays of a can

"It was the last voyage of the old
bark Iris, a good ship in her daj . too.
But she was built way back in the
fifties in Maine, and. in the natural
course of events, she had grown tired
of sailing around the seas, and her
butts were apt to open now and again
at inconvenient times. We loaded up
our lumber at Portland and set sail for
Sydney, In Australia. But we^ne%er
got there, leastwise the bark didn t.
"We had only been out a couple of
days when we fetched right into a stiff
northerly blow, and the old bark kicked
up her heels tremendous. First we
tried running her under the lower
main topsail and the forestaysail. but
it wasn't any good. She had a heavy
deckload of timber and was very slug
gish, so that time and again sh^
pooped, the cabin was flooded, and the
wheel smashed into little bits. I don t
know where the man at the wheel
went, but we never saw him again.
"Then we got relieving tackles onto
the tiller, and hove her to with a tar
paulin in the mizzen shrouds. But it
wasn't much better so, the sea was
that heavy. Every plunge she made
seemed as if it would shake her rotten
old frame into little bits.
'â¢We pumped, it seemed to me, for
an eternity, but we couldn't make any
impression on the water in the hold.
It -ained on us all the time, for all the
seams were working loose by this time,
and if you looked over the rail between
the seas -< ou could see the oakum com
ing out. After a couple of days' hard
work, we found it was no use, and we
gave up pumping. Part of the deck
le- had already washed away, and the
rest we soon chucked overboard, so as
to lighten the ship a bit.
"The only good thing about a timber
laden craft is that she can't sink, ev
erything else is bad. Her cargo keeps
her afloat till she goes to pieces, and.
all we could do was to sit down and
wait until pome one cams along to takÂ«
us off. All our boats was long since
knocked to bits, but if they had been
there I don't know that we should
have cared much about taking to them
in such a sea. We were better off on
board the bark, bad as she was.
"The mizzen mast, being an old stick,
soon went by the board; our rudder
knocked into little pieces; we couldn't
steer or do anything, and we just hud
dled together on the poop. Luckily there
was a cask of water on deck which
hadn't been carried away, and being
tightly bunged the water was still
sweet. We made shift to get this up
on the poop, and we lived there for
about a week, drenched all the time
with salt water and eating nothing but
the cold stuff we could get from the
cabin lockers. The galley was long
since gutted, '.nd even if it had been
there, no cook living could have kept
a fire going. The main deck was
awash all the time, the bulwarks were
carried away pretty well fore and aft,
and it was as much as a man's life
was worth to try and get from the
poop to the forecastle.
"Wonder I lived through it, you say?
It was a wonder, but a man will do a
lot when struggling for :is life. But
that week's setting 1 there in wet
clothes give me chronic rheumatiz,
which nothing but a drop o' whisky
now and agin will keep under."
The old sailor touched his cap, as If
to emphasize the gentle hint, and in
the snug shelter of a neighboring sa
loon completed the tale of his rescue.
"The old hark was commencing to gr>
to pieces pretty fast, we could see. Bits
of her sheathing would come float
ing up alongside, and the hatches
burst up, so that the cargo was float
ing out from below. The sea was still
running heavy, and we knew that if
another blow came along it would fin
ish her and us. Then, one morning,
the skipper sings out: 'There's smoko
astern, boys.' Sure enough, we could
just make out a cloud behind us and
by and by it grew bigger, so that we
made sure it was a steamer coming
our way. There weren't any flags
left, so we tied a shirt to the stump
of the mizzenmast by way of a signal
of diAress. It didn't want any signal,
thaugh, to show the state we were in,
and as soon as the steamer sighted us
she altered her course a point or so aad
bore down.
"She was a welcome sight to us, as
she came sweeping along, her black
sides gleaming with the wet sea. and
her long line of brass-lined ports shin
ing with fresh polish. We could see
the passengers crowding to the side and
knew they were watching us through
their glasses. Then she stopped. Just
to windward of us, and we. saw the life- I
boat drop from her davits like a flash.
It was the prettiest sight I have ever
seen, I can assure you. Having the
wind and the sea with them, they were
alongside in no time, and I can tell you
we didn't mind jumping into the sea to
be rescued a bit. We were wet any
way as it was and the sea was too
heavy for the boat to lay alongside.
"They â¢ rolled us up in warm blan
kets and gave us hot grog, and I never
felt so comfortable in my life, for I
slept twenty-four hours straight off the
reel. As for the old bark, we left
her there, and I suppose she soon went
to pieces, for we never heard of her
again." J. F. ROSE-3OLEY.FIGHTING FOR ISLAM
ON THE AFGHAN BORDER

"VOien you're wounded and left on Afghanis
tan's plains.
And the women come out to cut up what re
niains.
Just roll to your rifle and blow out your
brnlns
An' so to your Gawd like a soldier."
THUS the omniscient Kipling In
his advice to a young British
soldier. It is not pleasant ad
vice, certainly, but those who
understand the manner in which
the wild hill tribes of Northern
India mutilate their dead enemies will
realize Ita soundness. It is a long es
taMished Mohammedan custom, al
ii part of thoir religion, to inflict
every possible Indignity on the body of
r. foe, and the women who perform this
hideous task would bp little likely to
hesitate because the soldier was still
living.
The English speaking world has re
cently been furnished with a vivid pic
ture of the difficulties attendant upon
a campaign in Afghanistan, where the
troops, in the face of a determined
enemy, have to make their way
through precipitous defiles and over
almost inaccessible crags. Lieutenant
"\V. L. Spencer Churchill, a scion of the
jrreat Marlborough family, has just
published a book which has taken Lion
don by storm. He details his experi
ence with the Malakand expeditionary
force, and the picture which he drews Is
by no means a reassuring one for the
British taxpayer, who will eventually
have to foot India's little bill for cam
paign warfare.
It is really a holy war, Islam against
the Cross, and ranged under their
sacred banner, th^ Afridis commit
deeds of fanatical heroism which excite
the admiration even of their enemies.
Churchill tells us how, in the midst of
a hot engagement, a Mollah or priest
â would suddenly appear on the pin
nacle of some beetling crag, his long
whit^ hair f.owing behind him, the holy
.rratped in his hand, encouraging
his fiillM\vers, both by gesture and
to renew their heroic efforts. The
appearance < f the Mollah always acted
like a talisman on the superstitious
Afridis, and he Be -mcd. indeed, to bear
a charmed life, for, though the bullets
whistled around him, he was never
t' ai.hed.
The impossibility of abandoning the
wounded makes fighting, for the Eng
lish troops, a very difficult matter. The
Afghans give no quarter; they have
their own code of honor, but it is not
the code of the civilized world. To the
ferocity of a Zulu they add the craft of
a Redskin and the markmanship of a
lioer. The world is presented with the
grim spectacle, "the strength of civil
ization without its mercy."
It seems strange to read of such bar
baric warfare in these advanced days,
but. as a matter of fact, the strife is al
ways going on. It is one of the legacies
of trouble which Great Britain's mag
nificent possessions in India have
brought her. Afghanistan itself, which
now forms the only boundary between
Russia in Asia and England in India,
is merely a collection of unruly hill
tribes, wild mountaineers whom no
government can tame. Even the Ameer
of Afghanistan has no power to keep
them in check, though his rule is ab
solutely despotic, and he enforces order
by the sword only. The country has
r been subdued by any monarch;
the hardy hill tribes who inhabit the
f;iPtnesFes of the Hindu Kush and the
Himalaya ranges will pay tribute to no
one, though they are always ready to
rob and murder whenever opportunity
occurs.
The very name of the State is of quite
modern origin, and is due to the Per
sians, who made a show of conquer
ing the land in 1735. The Persian rule,
however, did not last long, and the
country returned to its own unsettled
condition, nominally ruled by whoever
could seize the throne, might being al
ways right, and law and justice no
where.
This constant state of activity and
|T WAS LIKE CLIMBING A WALL, AND A HUNDRED TIMES AS DANGEROUS, TRYING TO REACH THE
/iFRIDIS' STRONGHOLD.
unrest has made the Afghans one of
the finest fighting races in the world,
as the British have time and again
found out to their cost. Despite the
large force which was sent against the
Afridis last autumn the tribes are still
unsubdued and the task will all have
to be done over again as soon as the
return of spring renders renewed fight
ing possible.
The mountainous nature of the coun
try gives its defenders every advantage.
It is but a succession of precipitous
ranges, each one forming an impregna
ble position which a few determined
men can hold against thousands. And
when, as at Darghai, one mountain is
captured, with great gallantry and loss
of life, the victors are only confronted
with another and equally strong posi
tion, which must likewise be stormed.
The difficulty of obtaining supplies and
kef-plpp- open the line of communication
renders the movement of any very large
force impossible, and the only way In
which victory can eventually be se
cured Is by hemming the tribes up on
sr.me mountain top and literally stirv
ing" them into submission.
This <tyle of border warfare Is no
new thing to the Guides and other regi
ments which constantly patrol il c
northwest frontier of India. The only
difference is that of size. The expedi
tion against the Afridis was under
taken on an extensive scale, therefore
it was called a war. The small expedi
tions which are constantly going on to
discipline some unruly tribe or other
are never officially recognized in this
light; the Government of India pru
dently says as little about them as pos
sible, and the British public never re
alizes that another successful little war
has been brought to a termination.
Sometimes, as at Chittral, the massa
cre of a British party throws a ghastly
light on the affair, and It becomes
I necessary to occupy the countiv in
â  force; at other times the troops, having
I Dhiwn up a few mud forts and de-
Btroyed a f-:w villages qui-jt-.v wilh
; draw and amicable relations with the
I tribe are resumed.
It costs the Indian Government a
' large amount of money to preserve even
: a semblance of peace on the border,
: for ever since the first disastrous Af
ghan campaign of 1839, it haa been
found cheaper to subsidize the tribes
than to fight them. If a headman will
govern his people in quiet, avoid raid
' ing, and keep the passes open, then he
will get an annual payment, if not, then
he will have to fight the British. Be
â  fore any hostile operations can be
! carried on in Afghanistan, the passes
must be secured. Especially the fam
ous Khyber Pass, through which the
river Kabul makes its escape from the
ranges of the Hindu Kush to the plains
nf the Pur.jaub. Every expedition of
I any size which has entered Afghanis
tan has gone through this pass, and it
was the neglect to secure it properly
which led to the terrible disaster of 1842,
; one of the most severe defeats which
i British arms have ever sustained.
It is always Russian intrigue which.
I commences the trouble in Afghanistan.
: The recent rising of the Afridis is more
than suspected to be due to a secret
agitation carried on by Russian agents,
though the Ameer has been careful to
deny any complicity in the actions ot
his unruly subjects. But in 1839 there
was no doubt about the matter. The
Ameer of the day, Dost Mohammed,
was openly dallying with Russia, and
i the British sent an expedition under
Sir John Keane, which dethroned him
and placed Shah Shuja on the throne.
Unfortunately Afghan treachery was
not so thurousrhly Understood then as
i it is now. and the force of 8000 men, left
.to support the new monarch on the
j throne, took no precautions to keep
i open its line of retreat to India. In
consequence the Afghans soon organ
. ized an insurrection against their new
; ruler and his friends, the English. The
I whole country rose, and after a num
j ber of nffu-prs, and even helpless wo
: men and children, had been treacher
i ously murdered, the British made a
treaty with the Afghans, agreeing to
withdraw from the country, on condi
tion of being supplied with provisions
and escorted in safety to the frontier.
Neither clause of this agreement was
kept. In the middle of winter, In tho

day they were attacked by large bodies
of the enemy, and within a week the
whole force, which numbered, includ
ing campfollowers, women and chil
dren, some 26,000, was destroyed.
The defeat, of course, was redressed
Kabul was retaken, but no subsequent
victories could restore the lost army
nor the Innocent women and children
who had fallen. And ever since then
India has been most careful to keep
control of the passes, hence the deter
mination with which she has gone to
work, at any cost, to subdue the Afridi
rising, for this tribe has been the guar
dian of the Khyber pass since 1880.
Lord Roberts, now a British peer, but
more familiarly known as "Bobs of
Kandahar," because of his famous
march from Kabul to Kandahar, is rec
ognized as one of the greatest living
authorities on the subject. In a re
markable speech which he made the
other day In the House of Lords he ad
vocated, as the easiest way out of the
difficulty, nothing less than the com
plete occupation of Afghanistan, and
the adoption of a scientific frontier cal
culated to block all Russian advances
toward India, Probably the enormous
cost of this scheme will prevent its
adoption, but It would have the ad
vantage of making the British frontier
conterminous with that of Russia, so
that the game of Intrigue hitherto so
successfully carried on in the buffer
state of Afghanistan would have to
cease. Also all the unruly tribes would
become British subjects and their paci
fication would be only a matter of time
and tactful treatment.
How little we really know of the In
terior of this part of Asia hap been
painfully illustrated by the awful late
of Walter Savage Landor, the well
known writer and explorer. Landor
was fired with ambition to visit the
sacred city of L'hassa, tho mysterious
home of the Lamas, in Thibet, one of
the few spots in the world which has
n^ver been explored by Europeans. He
started with a large expedition, but
most of his followers deserted him, and
the natives, discovering his identity,
made him a prisoner.
Apparently with the object of seeing
how much pain a white man could bear
without dying, they subjected him to
every variety of diabolical torture, and
Landor was only rescued at the last
moment by a British expedition which
heard of his predicament. And now,
with a courage which borders on rash
ness, a young American, Mr. W. Jame
son Reid, is about to attempt the same
feat. His plan is to get himself smug
gled into L'hassa in a basket of goods,
slung on a camel. Should he succeed
where Landor failed, it will be a re
mnrkable testimony to American enter
prise, but 'the odds are very much
against him. M. ROSE-SOLEY.
The Beautifying Bath.
It is not infrequently said that a
daily bath is weakening. This is such a
great mistake that it is difficult to un
derstand haw it is ever made. A daily
bath is just as necessary to bodily pur
ity as. daily prayers are to soul purity,
and it should be as conscientiously tak
en. In some place, and at some time
that cannot be recalled, this observa
tion has come to my notice, and its
truth made its Impression a lasting
one: "A lady bathes not to get clean,
but to stay clean."
It is true that remaining too long in
the bath may be weakening, but a
quick bath in either very warm or even
hot water, followed by a cold dash,
has only good effects.
A refreshing and practical bath is one
in moderately hot water with a little
sea salt in it â sea salt is practical and
chear> â pure white soap, a sponge and
a cheese cloth washrag. Cheese cloth
is both practical and cheap, and at the
same time sufficiently rough to remove
all dirt and not rough enough to
scratch. The sponge must serve as the
shower bath, and after the body is
thoroughly dry rubbing corn meal or
bran over it makes the skin soft and
velvety.
The use of a bag of bran instead of
a washrag is much favored by the
French women for the softening effect
it has upon the water and its tendency
to make the skin delicately white and
smooth. But no bath is perfect in its
results unless followed by a brisk and
vigorous friction of the hands or rub
bing with a coarse towel. â Katherine

conspicuously upon this day, and great
care and often skill is given to their

to friends, and among the children a

those of their friends in the hope oi

Friends greet each other with mu
tually expressed wishes for msfny hap
py returns of the day, and father, sons.
brothers and male friends emphasize
these wishes by kisses and embraces
bestowed upon one another as do the
gentler sex. Their Easter rejoicings
extend throughout the following Mon
day and Tuesday, and it is a time for
general good will, for the settling of
paÂ«t differences, and, like our Christ
mas, a time to remember the poor.
Easter Sunday in the Canton of
Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland, is given
over to amusements for children prln-
clpally.
It is not unusual for the snow to Ho
deeply in the gardens at Easter, but
the little baskets claimed by each child
of a family have been filled with
colored eggs and hidden among the
shrubs, and are perhaps covered un
der the snow still falling.
The gardens are all alive with little
bobbing heads as they hunt the bas
kets, representing nests, which the
hares of the forest are supposed to fill.
When the nests have been found and
the little numb hands warmed, they at
tend 9 o'clock service with their parents
and remain for Sunday-school, which
begins at 11 o'clock, for each one is
sure to receive a beautiful card picture
and an egg, nicely painted, from her
teacher.
After the church services the entire
family, dressed in the national costume

of their canton, meet their friends and
forming parties take the children pic
nicking, as they term it, though the
picnic is held at an inn instead of under
the trees as later in the season.
Everybody buys the enormous braid
ed Easter cakes, displayed in the bak
eries, and which are filled with almond
kernels and raisins, and the children
pass their day with eating cakes,
sweetmeats and in â  laying games, they
as well as the Greek children counting
that the best of all in which they try
to break the shells of their companions'
eggs with one they hope may be thicker,
for the boy or girl who wins the most
Easter eggs in this way is quite a lion
with the rest.
On returning home the children of
each family shell the eggs that remain,
and a huge dish of salad is made from
them, with a simple dressing and with
out greens, which they partake of for
supper. After this the father amuses
them as he himself was amused on
Easter evening when a boy, by hang
ing beyond easy reach a pole, from five
to six feet in length, wo-und with tis
sue paper in the national colors of
green, red and white, and upon which
he has strung 1 great delicious crullers
shaped like pretzels, and to secure them
the children must jump very high In
deed.
A former resident of this Swiss vil
lage remarked that the streets of
American towns upon the sth of July
presented the same untidy apppearance
as those of her childhood's home the
Monday following Easter, with the dif
ference that one was thickly strewn
with ragged, exploded firecrackers and
the other with shattered eggshells.
In Mexico the day which follows j
"Glorious Saturday" is not a day of
feasting, as Easter Sunday is ther^
considered the last day of Lent and
the people are still observing the fast.
The altars in the churches are, how
ever, relieved of the gloomy black dra
peries which covered them and decked
with flowers. The people also cast I
aside the mourning of Holy Thursday
and appear in their brightest attire, the |
dreary wooden grind of the matracns
give place to pealing bells. The tables !
filling the squares about the church j
doors, and upon which all kinds of i
tempting edibles, sweets, children's toys
and harmless drinks wore displayed for
sale during holy week are removed.
The young men and women, at other
times sternly restricted, who took ad- j
vantage of the throngs of worshipers
and the preoccupation of their elders
to exchange glances and form acquain
tances, now walk solemnly or demure
ly into the churches, their thoughts ap
parently occupied with nothing save
the services, beginning with high mass.
Amid the pealing of bells at the stroke
of 9, the hour at which Christ was
supposed to have arisen, the effigies of
Judas, which have been filled with ex
plosives, are touched off, and with the
deafening reports and vibrations Eas
ter services begin.
The Emerald 1 a is in no wise be
hind the rest pf Christendom in its.
celebration of Easter. It is hailed as
a day of joy and gladness by all good
Christians. The festivities as a matter
of course are enjoyed in proportion to
the means at hand, and, in the rural
districts, usually end with a little inno
cent merrymaking.
The day comes when nature is begin
ning to look beautiful. She is already
clothed in her garment of rich Irish
green, and the primrose â the first flower
of the spring â greets the eyo in all di
rections.

Along the shores of Lough Mask
and Lough Corrib, in the province of
Connaught, the villages at the time I
write of were very numerous and
thickly populated with a sturdy and
healthy looking peasantry. Their
habits were primitive and their mode of
living from necessity very simple. Tak
ing^lnto consideration the way they
were handicapped in the struggle for
existence, they were wonderfully light
hearted.
It might be some wayside shebeen or
more likely a widow who, to try to keep
the wolf â or the agent, which is about
the same â f'om the door, would try to
turn an honest penny by giving the
cake on "Alsther Sunday."
The music comes next In order and
the best piper available is engaged to
furnish It. Other minor preparations
are seen to and when the cake is
brought home little else remains to be
done.
Easter Sunday begins with a dance.
It may not be generally known, and the
information be rather startling, that
the sun dances in that country on Eas-
Imorn! Well, if the outside world
ds in ignorance of it that's no fault
le people who live by Lough Mask,
who are able are out of bed at
n to see that wonderful perform
>. Nor are they disappointed. He
jre to be at his brightest on that
icular morning, and he does dance
t gleefully for at least fifteen min
after rising, to the intense delight
is beholders, then dismissing them
appy mood to enjoy the Easter egg
t and prepare for the religious ob
ance of the day.
Early in the afternoon preparations
for the dance begin. It is to be held
out of doors; usually on the public
road, a -potato garden being of more
benefit to the Irish cottager than a
"lawn" and far more in keeping with
his humble abode. The road is broad
and in good repair and a convenient
spot, well freed from dust, answers the
purpose very well. Borrowed and im
provised seats are placed on both Bides,
the piper's chair in its proper place and
all's ready.
A long-handled churn dash is fas
tened securely on the garden wall. The
cake is brought out, covered with a
snow white cloth, placed on the dash
in full view, and there left to play its
part.
The piper has arrived and is "dis
coursing" a few plaintive and sweet
old melodics â some of which even a
Patti might delight inâ to the admira
tion of the nearest neighbors, who have
come to welcome him. He plays on the
instrument known as the union pipes,
the wind being supplied by bellows at
tached to the elbow. He is blindâ most
Irish pipers are. I knew of but one who
was not. Yet he finds his way along
highways and byways without trouble.
His services are paid for by the danc
ers, each of whom drops a coin on the
plate that is placed beside him. "Pay
ing the piper" is proverbial.
The young people may now be seen
coming from every direction. Their
make-up is not quite as romantic look
ing as that of the Swiss or French
peasant, but they more than equal it
by their fine, healthy appearance. Dan
! cinq has commenced, and all seem to
i be enjoying themselves. The dancap are
not of the hugging variety. They are
more of the "stand off" kind. Jigs and
I reels were good enough fr â¢ them, with
an occasional country dance, led by one
or two of the more accomplished.
The dances go merrily on until dusk.
Nearing that time the cake, which hith
| erto, beyond a passing glance, has been
j taken little notice of, is now becoming
of deep interest, particularly to the wo
men folks. "And I wonder who's goin'
to bring in the cake," is whispered from
one to another.
The last dance Is called, and it prom
ises to be a lively one. So it is. One
couple after another drop out, and with
a bow and curtsey to the musician
stand aside. It may be two or it may
be but one couple who now hold the
floor and dance with more than usual
snirit. If the former â which seldom
happens â one couple good naturedly
gives way. The other keep on dancing
and putting in their best stept, the
crowd cheering. After tiring themselves
out both walk in the direction of the
cake amid more cheering. The "boy"
climbs up, takes it off its perch and
puts it in the "Colleen's" apron, which
she holds in readiness to receive it. She
carries it in â weighty as it is â and is
followed by "both their houses," to do
hnnor to the occasion and the land
lady.
The cutting of the cake devolves on
the lady who Lrought it in. She first
cuts out a liberal center piece which
she hands to the landlady. Then glanc
ing around she measures the house
and cuts accordingly. The next day an
elderly lady may be heard to ask, "and
who brought in the cake last night?"
Then, on being informed, "Was it now?"
"Troth an' sorra purtier couple in the
parish; an' its a weddin' we'll ioon

T< ) be well bonneted on Easter
Sunday is an adjunct as essen
tial to religious harmony as It is
a desire distinctly feminine. For,
"This is the day, and this the happy
morn.
When her flower of a bonnet is Just In
bloom."
This is the season when her hat is
trimmed to order on the congregation
side. To be obliged to wear an old
or an unbecoming bonnet on this day
ys is a severe pe. ance. And these
thoughts are certainly disturbing to the
.1 attitude of prayer.
That these sentiments are not wholly
th>* ;-i.mopoly of youth, some of our
representative women have given tes
timony in their reminiscent Easter bon
net trials.
"I really never attached much impor
tance to Easter bonnets until this
year," said Mrs. Nellie Blessing Eyster.
"I can scarcely tell why I should do
S3 row; but I must admit that I took
. onsiderable pride in this pink and
1 rown creation. Just to get a friend's
opinion one day last week I pulled the
bandbox containing it from under the
bed and found the latest (litter) ary
event of my household. The crown of
my bonnet was filled to the brim with
a litter of Madame Tiger's kittens.
"This is the first Easter that
I have had to purchase two bonnets for
the one occasion, and perhaps it is the
most important one; but it is not my
earliest Easter bonnet trial. This oc
curred in Baltimore when I was a girl.
It was my first visit to a city and I
found it a place of wonders. It wa3
the day before Easter, and I was go
ing to see the Mermaid, the beautiful
lady with long golden hair and a fish's
tail.
"Po tedious is this day.
As in the night before some festival
To an Impatient child that hath newrobea
And may not wear them."
"I worried my governess until
Bhe granted me the indulgence of wear
ing my new bonnet to the Zoo. Such
crowds of people were there and so
many things to look at that I grew im
patient to s<-e this wonderful mermaid.
I saw it and the pet illusion of my
childhood was destroyed. It made me
iT"?? to see such an ugly thing, and as
I turned away I saw in the distance a
girl with a bonnet on just like mine
âbut my, what shocking behavior!
Even at this distance I could detect
her supercilious airs. While she dis
gusted, still she attracted me, and I
found myself advancing toward her and
I was surprised to see her walk to
ward me. She was my own reflection
in a mirror. I tried to sooth my wound
< 1 vanity by getting even with the
monkeys. I poked the little ones with
my parasol until my bonnet was
snatched from my head by a big mon
key, that, unperceived by me, had
crawled up the bars above me, and in
a twinkling he doused it into a pan of
water within the cage. In less than
a minute each monkey had some rem
nant of that bonnet. Lace, ribbon and
flowers were trailed through the ivist.
"My governess converted her veil
Into a head-dress for me to wear horn*,
and the next day I was punished by
having to wear my old bonnet to
church."
"Wi bannet off, quoth I, sweet lass,
I think ye seem to ken me."
"The memory of my first Easter bon
net trial dates back to my girlhood
days," said Mrs. J. H. Jewett. "At
this time I was attending a seminary
near Shelbyville. Ky., and with the
othr-r girls I rebelled at the then pre
vailing style of the slat pun-bonnet. To
hr- sure they were made of elegant ma

of silks, but what chafed us particu

"It was impossible to get even a
glance at our sweethearts without be
ing guilty of the rudeness of turning
squarely around. That to me, as to the
other girls, seemed the crudest of all
sacrifices to endure for the sake of the
then fashionable Easter bonnet."
Mrs. S. J. Murphy relates an Easter
bonnet experience that all early settlers
will appreciate.
"Shortly after our marriage." Mrs.
Murphy began, "my husband and I
went to our new home, a settlement
way down in Georgia. This home was
a log cabin built in the edge of the
woods and our neighborhood, though
somewhat scattered, turned out en
masse on Easter Sunday. Besides there
was a new attraction â they wished to
see the bride. Need I add that the
bride herself was anxious to look well?
My husband, too, took a great interest
in my appearance, and this he mani-

fested in the sudden interest he dis
played in the welfare of my Easter
bonnet. As I said before the house
was built of logs and in fair weather
sunlight streamed through the spaces
between the logs, while in stormy
weather â thereby hangs a tale.
"The day before Easter was heralded
by a storm. The roof leaked, the water
dashed in at the windows and streamed
in between the logs, and I spent the
entire day in hunting for a dry spot
for my Easter bonnet. No sooner
would I be assured that the box con
taining it was secure from the deluge
than I would be as speedily convinced
of its danger. Pans, boiler, pots and
the marvelous Parisian pompadours.
Feminine Paris looks as though it had
got out of bed and forgotten to
comb its hair. And in the light of
these facts the dear things met me at
the wharf with their hair parted and
coiled the same old way. 1 confess I
liked them all the better for it. There
is a similarity between that round, fiat
knot of hair and pins ''like mother used
to make." Every trace of "Hcimweb"
disappeared at the first climpse of
them.
But why this digression on hair when
hats are the subject of my discourse?
Because on the arrangement of the hair
depends the becomingness of the hat.
In Paris the milliners display strik
ingly new patterns for hats. Presto!
changes the style of dressing the hair
to suit the new headgear.
Milliners and hairdressers work hand
in hand. Every Parisienne, after a little
seance with her hairdresser, can wear
a "Shepherdess," the latest thing in the
way <>f hats and a creation that is a
direct evolution from the "Jane Had
ings" of last year and can be traced
still further back to the "Marie An
toinettes." Every Parisienne does pos
sess a "Shepherdess" and "entre nous"
it becomes a trifle monotonous. Here,
however, thf milliners import the latest
things, people try them on, find them
unbecoming and with that independ
ence that makes them so adorable they
Will have none of them. They do not
realize that it is not alone the con
tours of the face, but the arrangement
of the hair that makes a hat becoming
or otherwise.
Secretly I am delighted that San
Francisco hairdressers cannot live up
to San Francisco milliners. If they did
w/> might run riot in one direction in
stead of having such a charming va
riety of hats.
Daintiness is the chief characteristic
of the new importations. Feathers
have been entirely laid aside fr>~ the
nonce, and soft and airy aigrettes and
letted quills are occupyin their place.
Flowers are more beautiful than ever
before, and in exquisite coloring and
perfection of outline vie with nature's
own blossoms.
I have seen the "Shepherdess" dis
played in several of the shop windows
here. They are equally as fetching as
those dfsplayed in Paris, whence, no
doubt, they hail. Bent down to shade
the face, rolling high on the sides, and
drooping again in back, they are at
once picturesque and jaunty. It is
hard to say just wherein they differ
from the hats that Jane Hading made
bo popular in Paris last year. I think
the main difference lies in the fact that
they are smaller and the droop over

kettles literally covered the floor. Every
few minutes my husband would come
in from his work in the barn to inquire
if the bonnet were high and dry, for he
wished me to be 'in the fashion shin
ing,' and the storm showed no signs of
abating. I was well nigh worn out with
my labor that day, but at night I was
rewarded by a peep at the treasure
just before going to sleep. It smiled
back at me from its little dry home and
my heart was satisfied."
"When beauty's ensign yet was crim
son on her lips," Mrs. Huntington,
mother of H. E. Huntington, encoun
tered her first Easter bonnet trial.
"In those days," said Mrs. Hunting
ton, "the prevailing fashion was the
old aberdeeno. This was but a flimsy
affair, though exceedingly pretty, but
poorly adapted" to the whimsical East
ern summer climate. The frame was of
wire and the covering only paper.
"I was in New York State at this
time and foolishly dared to brave the
drive to Easter service without an um
brella. The early morning opened as
fair as a day in June, the day of all
days for wearing my aberdeeno hat.
But I had not reckoned on its close,
nor the deluge of rain that was to ut
terly ruin my hat.
"When I reached home I still wore
the wire frame upon my 1. :ud, but the
prettily fluted paper rim was lying
round my shoulders, a homeless mass."
"How well I remember my first Eas
ter bonnet with its torments," said
Nellie Holbrook Blinn. "My father was

town where the clergy had to take so

a certain chic about them that the

French walking hats droop over the

trimmed in drapes, steel ornaments
and quills.
The toques are made entirely of
flowers on a straw or wire foundation.
Charming effects are obtained in
those made of the soft crushed roses,

the yellows and burnt oranges are
holding high carnival here. Last year

much for a salary with a promise of
donations. At the donations number
less articles too funny to speak about
would be given, from barrels of Hour
down to lead pencils.
'â¢On this particular year, my sister
and myself were given bonnets with
the request that we should not wear
them until Easter. I should have been
glad never to have worn mine: but
whatever was given to us must be
worn with gratitude. My hair was
what was called in those days red. The
bonnet was red also. But the two reds
were of a different shade, and clashed
inharmoniously upon my oversensitive
nerves. How to avoid wearing that
bonnet at all was my study. I put it
away to try on alone after oiling my
hair to tone it down a shade or two.
But the unpleasant fact still remained
that it was the most unbecoming thing
that I was ever called upon to wear.
"Easter morning came all too soon
and the bonnet was adjusted with hu
miliation upon my red head. I shall
never -forget my suffering on that oc
casion. My little friends, seeing my
discomfiture, teased me by pulling my
strings and blowing the feathers until
my patience was exhausted.
"On my way home I had an alterca

street. I at once jumped on it and
left it there as a broken monument to

the soft full-blown variety and are ex

headgear, they can not fail to find
something that satisfies the!? cravings.
The shops are all well supplied and
have an endless variety. There is the
"Shepherdess" for the fin de sieele, the
rolled walking hat for the tailor-made
girl, the flower toques for the airy
fairy girly- girlies, flaring hats for "my
lady picturesque," hats for long faces,
short faces, thin faces, plump facesâ in
short, any kind of a face. And even

absolutely the mandates of H. R. H.

its turn, of hatching out sounds

that would be new, that would cause
the other candy men to open their eyes

this curiosity. At any rate, there it

Every boy who gets one â and as it is
somewhat expensive, few will be the
proud possessors of the wonder â will
straightway want to gobble it up, in
stead of getting its secret from it in
the form of a beautiful sound. That
is, it will be beautiful sound if the boy
is a musician â otherwise it will proba

"The greatest amount of discomfiture
I ever felt over an Easter bonnet," re
lated Mrs. Irving If. Scott, "was an ex
perience I had here in San Francisco.
I was going to Easter service and felt,
I suppose, the satisfaction and happi
ness that all women feel, until they
look over the congregation and see some
bonnet prettier than their own. My
hair was very abundant, and my bon
net very light. There was quite a
little breeze and my bonnet was lifted
from my head without my knowing it.
Presently I stumbled over what I
thought a little black dog; and as I
stepped aside, I reeoernized my bonnet
as it went hopping and bobbing along
the pavement in my advance. After
a little pursuit the truant was Rescued,
and I gained my pew in time to sur

nine pieasure to study the blooming
pews on Easter. And I soon selected
from this nodding mass a perfect love
of a bonnet â tne one above all ethers
that I should have liked for myself.
"Now the funniest part of my story is
that the next day one of the papers, in
giving a description of the Easter bon
nets, put the very bonnet that I so
much admired upon my own head."

was living at the memorable time near
Fort Wayne, Ind., and as I expected
to be married later in the summer and
come to California to reside, I con

"The only regrets I ever felt over an
Easter bonnet," declared Mrs. Colonel
Kinne, "carry me back to the time
when my little daughter was about 3
years of age. At this time I dressed the
quaint little thing up like an old lady,
and put on her head my new bonnet,
with its pink roses in front and its fall
of Chantilly lace behind, and allowed
her to go upstairs to call upon her
grandmother.

SHE MAKES A HANDSOME LIVING
Out of Egg-Farming.
TO COMBINE book publishing and
poultry keeping is an idea which
it takes an enterprising woman to
carry out.
This woman is Mrs. Sarah L.
Bliss, who is the publisher of the
Brooklyn Blue Book, and at her coun
try place, just outside the borough of
Brooklyn, and within the limits of
Greater New York, she has started a
chicken farm.
Commencing less than a year ago
with twenty-five chickens, she has now
over 1000 fowls, ducks and turkeys.
"Is there any money in keeping poul
try?" was the question tasked -" Mrs.
Bliss at her Brooklyn office.
"I will give xou some notes from my
expense book, was the reply, and then
you can judge for yourself. Of course,
the first year one cannot expect to reap
great profits."
"It costs a penny a week to feed a
hen. She will lay about 180 eggs per
year. For these an average price of
three cents each is given, four or five
cents in winter and three cents in sum
mer. If you care to put it down in dol
lars and cents you might average it In
this way:
1 hen; fooa for 1 year at lc a weelc I 62
ISO eggs per year at 3c each 5 40
Balance in the treasury at end of year,
per hen 4M
Balance in the treasury, per 000 hens.. 4S&O CO
Balance in the treasury, per 2uOO hens.. 97tK) UO
"I intend having at least 2000 fowls,
and then I may clear $6000; wages,
taxes, etc., will take a good $2000 or
$1500. At present I have only one man
to help me, and I pay him $32 a month,
or $384 per year; three men will require
in wages $1152.
"Ducks are more profitable invest
ments, for the reason that their food is
not so expensive. Where it costs a
penny a week to feed a hen, the bill of
fare for a duck may be of a variety and
quality to please the most fastidious
duckling and cost only one-half penny
per week."
In the expense account it will be
noticed that "broilers" are not men
tioned. They are a small gold mine in
themselves, and should pay the expense
of the chicken farm, leaving clear
profit for the eggs. Mrs. Bliss has
never found any difficulty in disposing
of her eggs, 600 every week going to one
hotel. She considers the cochins and
the wyandottes the most profitable
breeds, and she has some original
theories in regard to Henrietta's daily j

"My little girl had dressed the dog
up to see grandma, too, and the dog did
the rest."
"The Easter hat most vividly difficult
to obtain that now presents itself," said
Sadie L. Ballou, "was a war-time affair.
My husband, v.-ho was one of the first
volunteers, had been taken prisoner at
Huntsville, Ala,, which reduced the
small private's pa â  to not even a unit.
With three mouths to feed by such
means as I could command by my
needle, no surplus was left for Easter
hats. But wit and every woman's ne
cessity (the hat) triumphed.
"I lived on the four corners of a
farmers' village in Northern Wisconsin
and drew water and such other inex
pensive luxuries as the well and the
hand of the deacon's wife around the
corner might contribute to necessity.
"One day she resurrected from the
loft of a mercantile storage a relic of a
dead fashion, a coal scuttle bonnet,
sometimes called a sky-scraper, and
gave it to n.e.
"That brim of brims so sleekly good
Not flapped like dull Wesleyans down.
But looking (as all church hats should)
Devoutly upwardâ toward the crown."
"It did not take me long 1 to change
the shape. After ripping and splicing
the braids I Bewed and shaped it into
form, dyed it in logwood dye. stiffened
it with gumarabic, and finally pressed
it over a stone cream jar into the then
fashionable shape. Sumach berries fur
nished me with the dye for my old rib
bons, and I plumed the hat with a
couple of soft feathers from the tail of
a hawk that my brother had killed.
'"To prove that the hat was a success
I have only to add that I set myself up
with a millinery establishment by tak
ing all the sky-scrapers he deacon's
wife had and selling them after re
modeling into the like my own
for the munificent sum of 50 cents."
, Dr. 'Beecher, a cousii. of the late
Henry Ward Beecher, said: "My re
ligion is not dogmatic; therefore an
Easter hat to me is not a necessity.
For fifty-seven years I have worn the
same style hat and dress. In fact, I
am so unconventional in this regard
that I have justly earned the sobriquet,
The woman of one hat and one dress.'
"Why? Because, when my best dress
or hat gets a little bit shabby, I go to
my tailor and order another dress made
in the same fashion. It is just so with
my hat. All I have to say is, 'I should
like to have one just the same as that.'
I have been called masculine, and never
except once in seven years do my
friends cease nagging at me, seven
years being the period in which a fash
ion is said to repeat itself. Then I
console myself with the thought that I
have set the style for others to follow,
and this is tlie only time in which I am
free from the persecution of my friends
regarding my mode of dress."
"The greatest humilif <n that T havn
been called upon to endure," said Mrs.
Judge Cooper, "was all on aciouiiL Â«.i

JUDITH AS PAINTED
BY DIFFERENT ARTISTS
THAT Judith, the heroine of an

evident from the number of pictures of

EGGS in some form or other, I
whether alone or as an adjunct
to other viands, seem to be a
natural article of food for Easter
morning and to lend them an in
dividuality appropriate to the occasion
Borne sli-ht deviation from the ordinary
ways of serving them is desirable. The
idea suggested by the accompanying
sketch is simple and inexpensive and
can be prepared for the meal at odd
moments some days in advance.
The materials necessary are a sheet
of green tissue paper, and one each of
white, yellow, red, pink or any colors
desirable which are in accord with the
natural colors of the flower, a box of
water-color paints, some mucilage and
a piece of No. 1 green ribbon. Having
obtained these, cut from stiff paper pat
terns of the size and shapes indicated
in No. 1 and No. 2 of the illustration.
No. 1 is 1% inches wide by 6V4 long,
and represents the long, slender
leaves of the plant. These should be
cut from the green paper, allowing at 'â 
least three for each flower. No. 2
shows the petals of the blossom, is Z2
inches long by 4V4 deep, and each petal
measures 2*4 inches across its widest ;
part.
When these patterns are cut lay them
on the tissue paper, several folds thick,
in order to t -pedite cutting the design,
and whfn as many as are needed have j
b^en secured put loner, irregular dashes
of water color paint on the petals, red
on yellow, pink on white, etc., as indi
cated in No. 3. 1 his work can be done
very rapidly and more than pays for |
itself in the appearance of the flower '
when completed.
When these are dry curl the end of
each petal slightly by drawing It over
the dull edge of a pair of scissors or an
ivory paper cutter, and fold creases in
each, as also shown in No. 3. These
are now folded around an egg cup, a bit
of mucilage holding the petals together

and to the side of the cup, rendering the
decoration more secure.
Outside of the petals are placed the
leaves, which are then tied securely in
place by a small boy of narrow ribbon
of green, or in harmony with the flower
itself, having first been creased in the
fold shown In No. 1 and caught about
at the top of the fold with a tiny bit of i
mucilage.
Care must be taken not to cut the
petals apart, a mistake it is easy to I
make, and which wastes paper, time
and energy, as it is difficult to put them
in place singly on the egg cup, and
gain the correct effect shown in No. 4.

This is a very good example of Mr.

WHY THE EG WERE CHANGED
FROM GRAY TO BLUE.
IT was the season of Easter along the
Eastern Shore of Maryland, and that
favored land, though the war was on
between the States and the Blue and
the Gray were fiercely contending for
a principle which could be settled
only by bloodshed, bore every evi
dence of nature that It was In truth what
Its people called It, "God's country."
Lying low and level, fresh in the spring
i green of its fields and orchards, shining
'in the silver strands of its myriad
I streams, stretching back and away from
! the rippling waters of the Chesapeake un
! til its clumps of woods rested on the east
j crn horizon and lazily luxurious in its
i balmy climate, it was. as it still is, a land
j of peace and plenty, fit for the restful
, quiet of body, soul and mind. As one of
! its songsters quaintly sings:
"Hfre terrapin and canvasback
Are to the manner born;
And here the nectar of the gods
Is rye instead of corn."
With Easter had come rejoicing among
! the dusky denizens of kitchen and cabin
along the Eastern Shore, for Easter was
1 the darkies" festival^ in those days, and
at no place was tfiVre more joy than
among the blacks of Kirkham Manor, for
! Major Winter, the proprietor of the
manor, was a kindly master, who let the
' fetters rest lightly on his slaves, and he
had announced that each of his people,
; big and tittle, should have a ticket to the
I circus which was to show in town on the
I Monday after Easter. It was not always
that a circus was one of the Easter fes
tivities, for Easter sometimes came be
fore the circus bloomed, but in the year
of this chronicle Easter nad fallen after
j the middle of April and the circus people
! had hastened to be ready on the Monday
j after. True, it was not a circus of the
j old-time splendor, for the war had made
that impossible, but there was a big white
' tent and spotted horses and ladies in tln
i sel Bkirts as short as they were glittering,
and there were hundreds of other fairy
I delights that grow In simple minds from
j the pictures on circus bills.
But the circus was only part of the
richness of the time. All work was to
stop at noon on Saturday, there was to be
church and ribbons and the best bib and
tucker on Sunday and on Monday and
Tuesday following the white folk were
to take hold of the work about the house
and place and let all the darkies In the
county go to town to have their full of
festivity. Cake walks aud feasts and bar
becues and weddings and hoedowns and
frolics of all kinds were In order, winding
up late Tuesday night, when even If some

WHAT THOMAS JEFFERSON
SAID
ABOUT ANNEXING CUBA
Copy of the Famous Letter on the Important
Question That He Sent to James Mon
roe Seventy-Five Years Ago.
THOMAS JEFFERSON wrote to
President James Monroe from his
home at Monticello, under date
of October 24, 1823:
"I have ever looked upon Cuba
as the most interesting addition which
could ever be made to our system of
States/
Monroe had addresÃed a letter to Jef
ferson, dated October 17, 1823, in which
Monroe expressed his opinion that we
ought to meet the proposal of the Brit
ish Government, and to make it known
that we would view an interference on
the part of the European powers, and
especially an attack on the (Spanish)
colonies, as an attack on ourselves.
This expression preceded the famous
"Monroe doctrine" message by but
forty days. In that short period, how
ever, Monroe's impression had solidified
into the strong words of his message to
Congress, December 2, 1823. At the con
clusion of his letter Monroe asks Jef
ferson's opinion and requests that the
correspondence be forwarded to James
Madison.
In view of the talk of an alliance with
England, it will be interesting to give
enough of this correspondence to show
how Monroe. Jefferson. Madison and
John Quincy Adams looked upon a simi
lar proposal, made when the Cuban
question was uppermost seventy-nve
years ago.
In reply to Monroe's letter, Jefferson
writes that the question "is the most
momentous which has ever been offered
to my contemplation sinoe that of in
dependence that made us a nation. ' He
points out the advantages of "detach
ing Great Britain from the band of
despots," and bringing "her mighty
weight into the scale of free govern
ment." "With her on our side." writes
Jefferson, "we need not fear the whole
world." But in the next line he de
clares that he "would not purchase her
amity at the expense of taking part in
her wars."
Jefferson declared his position on the
"Cuban question" in anticipation of tnÂ»>
designs of Russia, Prussie and Austria,
"a lawless alliance," says Jefferson,
"calling itself holy." He believed we
should "oppose, with all our means, the
interposition of any other power, under
any form or pretext," in the affairs of
this hemisphere.
In the memoirs of John Quincy Adams
we find that he, also, was called into
consultation on this "momentous
question. Adams writes under date of
November 15, 1823. that President Mon
roe sent for him to come to the State
Department, where the liters of Jef
ferson and Madison were laid before
him. Adams says that Madison's opin
ion in favor of accepting England s pro
posal is "less decisively pronounced
(than that of Jefferson), and he (Madi
son) thinks as I do, that this movement
on the part of Great Britain is impelled
more by her interest than by a princi
ple of liberty." .
The full text of Jefferson's letter is
as follows".
MdNTICEL,Lf>. October 24. 1823.
Dear Sir: The question presented by
the inters you have sent me Is the most
momentous" which has ever been offered
to my contemplation since that of in
dependence made us a nation. This sets
our compass and points the course
which we are to steer through the
ocean of time opening on us; and never
could we embark on it under circum
stances more auspicious. Our first and
fundamental maxim should be never to
entangle ourselves in the broils of Eu
rope- our second should be never to suf
fer Europe to interfere with Cis-Atlan
tic affairs. America. North and South,
has a set of interests distinct from those
of Europe, and peculiarly her own.
While the last is seeking to become the
domicile of despotism, our endeavor
ehould be to surely make our hemis
phere that of freedom. One nation, most
of all could disturb ub in this pursuit.
She now offers to lead and accompany
us in it. By acceding to her proposition
we detach her from a band of despots,
bring her mighty weight into the scale
for free government, and emancipate a
continent at one stroke, which mipht
otherwise linger long in doubt and diffi
culty. . , .

o'clock, and no one was about except tne
major's only daughter. Kate, who nan
chosen to stay and color a bushel or two
of eggs for the children.
Kate Winter was the pride of the
naicr's heart, she was the mistress of
every man's heart if she chose to be.

she did. When the war had com?, her
conservative father had taken no decided
stand, but the high strung Kate was posi
tive she knew which side was right, and
at once announced herself. She was for
the South, and what an unmitigated little
rebel she was. The sight of a blue coat
made her eyes snap and a single strain
of "Yankee Doodle" put all of her nerves
on edge. Vet during the month of Janu
ary, last past, whicn she had spent in
the social whirl at Washington, the one
man who was most devoted to her was
Captain Leonard of the Federal army,
and. woman-like, the man she most
wished to be so was uaa same captain.
When she came home, the captain acted
as escort to her party as far a 6 Balti
more; a few weeks later he had come to
Kirkham Manor for two days; he had
come again late in March, and now he
was to spend Easter Sunday and Mon
day on his third visit. Just why she per
mitted these attentions, she could not
say. for the captain wore the hated blue,
and he was, in addition, a lumbering,
awkward, good-natured, simple, sincere
kind of overgrown boy that a woman
likes better than anybody in the world,
but doesn't think of loving as she might
love a husband. As for such a man.
himself, he rarely is conscious of his good
points, and failing in the tact to present
himself as he should, all the chances are
that married life with the woman he gets
will not be what he had a right to ex
pect it to be.
"He's a Yankee, Kate," her father
would say of the captain in a bantering
mood.
"He is a Leonard," she would retort.
"His ancestor was Jonathan Leonard,
brother-in-law of Lord Baltimore. Is
mine any better?" and Kate would smile,
because her father was a stickler for
family.
"All the more reason why he should not
wear the blue," argued the major, accom
panied by a strain from "Maryland, My
Maryland."
"Well, papa," with a toss of her head,
"what do I care? I am sure he Is noth
ing on earth to mo. I met him as I met
dosens of others, and If he wants to come
down here to see us," emphasising the
usâ "we can not very well shut our doors
against him. He Is a friend, or says he Is,
and I don't want any thins to be nearer,
do us the most harm of any one, or
all on earth; and, with her on our side,
we need not fear the whole world. With
her, then, we should most sedulously
cherish a cordial friendship; ajid noth
ing could more securely knit our af
fections than to be fighting side by side,
in the same cause. Not that I would
purchase even her amity at the price of
taking part in our wars. But the war
in which the present proposition might
engage us. should that be its conse
quence, is not her war, but ours. Its
object is to introduce and establish the
American system of keeping out of our
land all foreign powers; of never per
mitting those of Europe to intermeddle
with the affairs of our nations. It is
to maintain our own principle; not to
depart from it. And if, to facilitate this
we can effect a division in the body of
the European powers and draw over to
our side its most powerful member,
surely we should do it.
But I am clearly of Mr. Canning's
opinion that it will prevent. Instead of
provoking war with Great Britain.
Withdrawn from their scale and shifted
into that of our two continents, all Eu
rope combined could not undertake such
a war. For how would they propose to
get at either enemy without superior
Meets? Nor is the occasion to be slight
ed which this proposition offers to pro
test against the interference of any one
in the internal affairs of another, so
flagitiously begun by Bonaparte, and
now continued by the equally lawless
alliance calling itself "holy."
But we have first to ask ourselves a
question. Do we wish to acquire to our
own confederacy any one or more of the
Spanish provinces? I cordially confess
that I have ever looked upon Cuba as
the most interesting addition that could
ever be made to our system of States.
The control which, with Florida point,
this island would give us over the Gulf
of Mexico and the countries and the
isthmus bordering on it, &s well as
those whose waters would flow into it,
would fill up the measure of our po
litical well being. Yet, as I am sensible
that this can never be obtained, even

that I was a man so I could light Captain
Leonard."
Kate was fully in earnest, too. and her
father was careful not to banter too far,
seeing that he had done so once to his
great discomfort, for the pretty Kate was
not all angel.
In the midst of the egg coloring Aunt
Mary, the cook, came hurrying to the
house as fast as she could.
"Fo' de Lawd, Miss Kate." she puffed.
"I done seed de Cappen a-comin' an' I
knowed you wuzn't especkin' uv him fer
two hours yit, so I jis run up f'um de
awchid to tell you an' gib you a chance
to spruce up a little 'fo' he gits yer."
Hut it was too late, for even as Aunt
Mary was performing her errand of
mercy, the captain rode up to the house
and he saw Kate at the kitchen window
as he swung round the corner of the lawn.
As Aunt Mary had said, he was two
hours ahead of time and Kate almost lost
her temper at the promptness of the man.
for there was no one on the place to re
ceive and entertain him except herself
and there was no escape. He had stopped
beneath the shade of a large tree in the
yard and there Kate, like a true house
wife in her working attire, appeared be
fore him with a basket of eggs and color-
Ing paraphernalia in her hands, and the
captain thought he never saw her look
ing half so pretty. That he was in love

THOMAS JEFFERSON.
FAC-SIMILE OF PART OF THE LETTER THOMAS JEFFERSON SENT JAMES MONROE IN OCTOBER, 1823, TOUCHING TWt
ACQUISITION OF CUBA &f THE UNITED STATES.
with her own consent, but by war, and
its own independence, which is our sec
ond interest (and especially its inde
pendence of England), I have no hesita
tion in abandoning my first wish to fu
ture chances and accepting its independ
ence with peace, and the friendship of
England, rather than its association at
the expense of war and her enmity.
I could honestly, therefore, join in the
declaration proposed, that we aim not
at the acquisition of any of these pos
sessions; that we will not stand in the
way of any amicable arrangement be
tween them and the mother country,
but that we will oppose, with all our
means, the forcible interposition of any
other power, as auxiliary, stipendiary
or in any other form or pretext, and
most especially their transfer to any
power by conquest, cession or acquisi
tion in any other way.
I should think it therefore advisable
that the executive should encourage
the British Government to a continu
ance in the dispositions expressed in
these letters by an answer of his con
currence with them as far as his au
thority goes; and that, as it may lead
to war, the declaration of which re
quires an act of Congress, the case shall
be laid before them for consideration at
their first meeting and under the rea
sonable aspect in which it is seen by
himself.
I have been so long weaned from po
litical subjects and have so long ceased
to take any interest in them that I am
sensible that I am not qualified to offer
opinions on them worthy of any atten
tion; but the question now proposed in
volves consequences so lasting and ef
fects bo decisive of our future destinies
as to rekindle all the interest I have
hitherto felt on such occasions, and to
induce me to hazard opinions which
will prove only my wish to contribute
still my mite toward anything which
may be useful to our country, and pray
ing you to accept it only at what it is
worth. I add the observance of my con
stant and affectionate friendship and re
spect, THOMAS JEFFERSON.
I As she met him now, laughing, she told
him she was just about to color a dozen
Easter egg* for him to take back to
1 Washington, but he had come too soon,
: and they were not ready.
He might have turned her remark nicely
by saying something about the impossi
i bility of seeing her too soon, but the cap-
I tain was too awkward for that.
Instead he saJd, as he pointed to some
! colored cloth in her hand:
"What color will they be. Miss Kate?"
"Gray." she responded promptly and
much to his surprise at her interpreta
tion of his innocent question. "It is my
color, Captain Leonard, and to be knight
of this lady you must wear the color she
gives you. But why did you come so
early to stop me at my work?" she added,
still lightly enough. "Papa was expect
ing to return in time to meet you and do
the honors, but here you are and what is
ever to be done with you?"
She looked at him ruefully, and he
smiled, but there was a shadow In it.
"It was my only opportunity. Miss
Kate." he replied seriously. "I am
ordered away to leave Washington on
Monday and join my regiment before
Richmond at once. Men are needed there,
and I am only too glad to be able to do
what I can for my country-"
The lines in Kate's face grew hard at
his words, and she looked at him as if
she would speak as she had often spoken
before, but she restrained the first im
pulse and waited for him to go on.

more before I went away," he continued

LOSS OF LIFE
A MONG INFANTS
rT^HE Medical Record says: ThÂ« fact
T^ls well known to medical men
I that where infants are massed
I together in large numbers their
J- chances of living are immensely
diminished. Convincing proofs â  Â« .JWW
have recently been afforded in the case ot
foundling hospitals in Italy and Franc*.
There is no need, however, to go abroad
for confirmatory evidence.
At the Randall's Island Foundling Hos
pital, an institution supervised by the
New York Department of Charities, of 36Â»
infants under six months of age received
during 1896 and treated continuously only
12 remained alive April 15. 1897. The aver
age duration of life of the 354 who died
was between five and six weeks. The
death rate was 96.7 per cent, and only two
of the survivors were bottle-fed.
A few historical comments will empha
size the needs of foundlings. Up to within
three decades practically nothing was
done for them in any English-speaking
country. .In England under the poor law
of 1834 the young "were merely received
to die, and the few who struggled into
life were trained only in ignorance, idle
ness and vice." In Philadelphia, until
1885 all waifs were sent to the foundling
ward of the Philadelphia Almshouse,
where the death rate was practically 100
per cent.'
In New York, only a quarter of a cen
tury ago, the child who was not at once
destroyed by the despairing mother had
no alternative but a lingering death in the
almshouse under the care of aged pau
pers. Reports show that of the infants so
placed scarcely one ever survived. At the
present time, except In New York city,
Philadelphia and in Massachusetts condi
tions remain the same.
Michigan has its placing out system for
older children, and Minnesota and other
States are helped by well-organized chil
dren's aid societies. But except in Massa
chusetts very little effort has been ex
erted to change a system which at best
seems only a legalized form of infanticide.
We must, of course, except the purely lo
cal and unorganized individual kindness
which has always in some measure, but
very inadequately, coped with the need.
The New York Foundling Asylum on
Sixty-eighth street shows how needless
and how criminal is much of the mortal
ity among foundlings. Its origin is due
to Sister Irene, whose fame is national.
In 1569, with only $5 in her pocket, she
began the work by placing a little crib
outside the door of her small house on
East Twelfth street. That crib now
stands within the present magnificent
buildings of this charity, and on the af
ternoon of February 21 received its 30,0915t
temporary occupant.
The system as evolved by Sister Irene
and carefully continued by others since
her death consists in paying a foster
mother from among the respectable poor
to care for a foundling, as well as her
own babe. The care ceases at the end
of three years and children are then
returned to the asylum for kindergarten
work and schooling, until finally placed
in good families the country over In
a special interview with Sister Teresa
Vincent, the present superintendent, the
following noteworthy statistics were se
cured:
In 1892, of the 2591 children of various
ages cared for, 611 died, an average of
22.8 per cent: in 1893, of 2962 there died
596. an average of 20.1 per cent; in 1896, of
2300 there died 573, an average of 24.9 per
cent.
In relation to the most recent 369 deaths
it is interesting to note that 95 of those
who died were received under one year
of age, while 128 of the fatal cases were
received between one and two; showing"
that while under the Randall's Island
barrack system it is almost certain death
to a more infant to place it there â in the
Foundling Asylum its chances are better
than if kept for a while in neglect an<l
hunger and 111 treatment by Its mother.

Little, indeed, save sky and bay and
the warm Californi . sunshine, for these
are the only things that man cannot
harness to the van of progress.
The astonished gaze of the fathers
would rest with loving remembrance
upon an adobe roof here and there â un
less commerce had sent these, too, into
eclipse by hideous and desecrating
painted signsâ and then, turning to the
old Mission Dolores, I fancy tears of
gratitude might come that time had
not ruthlesssly swept from sight this
monument of their labor. Within its
quaint and consecrated structure their
troubled souls, disembodied or reincar

as of old.
To-day the voices of trained s^nd sal
aried singers will thrill the souls of
listeners with their melody or faJl upon
ears too dulled by indifference to heed
the spiritual significance of words and
music. Yesterday, as it were, since
time swings the cycles so swiftly â the
people sang for .he very love of the
Eastertide and its gentle lesson to man
kind; and with the notes of'Te Deum,"
"Laudamus" and "Gloria in Erccelsis"
â vvr-re mingled feelings of joy that they

of their white-walled predecessor.
A hundred years ago the site of this
commonwealth-to-be was a sandy ex

malva and wildflowers, grown with
scrub oak, manzanita, mesquite and
madrone to the water's edge. Yerba

ty-one years and was perfect in
its plcturesnueneps, its interior being

with tho facilities at hand. The huts
of the Indians had been replaced by
adobe dwellings with tiled roofs in

DIPLOMATIC LIFE
in
WASHINGTON,
IF the stress of social life in Wash
ington prove a trial to those forced
to take part in it, at least there can
be no complaint of monotony, for
when surfeited with the faultless,
impassive demeanor of one legation
the impulse and fire of the South can
be sought at another, or the subtlety
and smooth polish of still another coun
try may be studied at but a stone's
throw.
To drive, in a few moments, from
England to Guatemala, from Spain to
Germany and then to China, Japan,
Hawaii, or where you will, is a feat not
to be attained in any other city in the
world, and, as the showman says, "It
must be seen to be appreciated."
The Right Honorable Sir Julian
Pauncefote, G. C. 8., G. C. M. G., Em
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUXDAY, APRIL 10, 1898.
bassador and Envoy Plenipotentiary, is
the dean of the diplomatic corps. He
lives up to the wealth of initials suc
ceeding his name in dignity of manner
r.nfl mien, ;md is an able representative
of her Majesty. He is a large, stout,
florid man of ripe years and pleasant
manners, alive to the importance and
honor of his position and determined
that others shall realize, through him,
Englaud's pride and England's might.
So long has he been accustomed to take
the lead at dinners, receptions and all
official or private entertainments that it
is almost impossible fur him to brook
any rivalry of the position which he
claims both by right of seniority and
because, as Embassador, he represents
the person of his sovereign. But of
late he has been forced into a second
ary position on two occasions and
Washington declares that he is a sad
der and a wiser man. Still, it took tht*
State Department to place Sir Julian
Pauncefote and he did not tamely sur
render what he considered his rights.
When the wealthy Mrs. Leiter invited
Sir Julian and his wife to dinner, the
Embassador wrote and requested a list
of her guests. In her reply Mrs. Leiter
named Vice-President Hobart in the list.
Sir Julian then wrote to his would-be
hostess to ask where she proposed to
seat her Majesty's representative.
When her answer informed him that he
would follow the Vice-President he de
clined the invitation and the question
became a state matter. Thus Sir Jul
ian's position and the Leiter dinnerwere
the discussion of the hour until the
State Department finally delivered the
verdict, during the Grant monument
ceremonies in New York, that Sir Jul-
ian took precedence of all excepting the
President and Vice-President, the
Vice-President, heir-apparent to the
Presidency, being the second man in
the land and therefore ahead of the
Dean Embassador of the Diplomatic
Corps.
It was shortly after this notable de
cision that President Dole of Hawaii
became the guest of the nation. Psesi
deot McKinley bade the Diplomatic
Corps to a dinner in honor of his dis
tinguished visitor, and again Sir Julian
lost his bearings, for immediately suc
ceeding the President of Hawaii and
his wife were the Hawaiian Minister,
Mr. Hatch, and his wife. Sir Julian, it
is said, failed to appreciate the brilliant
bi/ard, with its splendor of rare orchid
bloom, failed to enjoy the gallant as
semblage, the fair, jeweled women, the
decorated foreign representatives, the
costly viands, the music, the conver
sation, and, in short, all that went to
make one of the most noteworthy din
ners ever seen at the White House.
But if Sir Julian has faults, he also
has virtues, and as a host he is un
paralleled for courtesy, hospitality and
gallantry. The Pauncefotes live in a
handsome mansion on Connecticut av
enue, where they entertain largely and
magnificently. Their famous bal poudre
was the event of this season in Wash
ington. The genial host we- ably as
sisted by his wife, whose manners are
cordial and sympathetic, and by his
daughters, Sibyl, Lilian, Audrey â can
not one imagine the daughters of the
Pauncefote house? Typical English
girls, with complexions and faultless,
high-bred manners.
No greater contrast to this English
household can be found than at the
German embassy. Herr yon Holleben,
the Embassador, is a jolly bachelor, for
whom all the girls are setting their
caps and for whom all the mammas
have an appreciative, welcoming smile.
He lives in a magnificent house, that
contains the handsomest private ball
room in Washington, of which he takes
full advantage. He is the host at many
an informal dance, more pretentious
"hop." or still modre formal cotillon.
Having no ladies in his household, he
generally asks a couple of young mar
ried women to receive with him (and at
his last ball he secured the aid of two
charming womenâ Mme. Patenotre, the
lovely wife of the former French Minis
ter, and Mme. Hengelmuller yon Hen
gervar of Austria-Hungary. These two
are alike in their undeniable popularity,
beauty, wealth and family, although of
marked and distinct individuality.
Madame Patenotre was a Miss Elver
son of Philadelphia. She was visiting
in Washington when she met Monsieur
Patenotre, who fell in love with her al
most at first sieht. They met at a large
reception. Monsieur Patenotre noticed
the tall, fair girl, whose air of style
and distinction added attraction to her
beauty. He approached nearer; near
enough to overhear the conversation
shy was holding with those around her.
To his surprise it was in French. His
interest in her was doubled; he noted
the purity of her accent and listened
delighted for a few moments to his
mother to-ngxie. Then he rushed off to
seek for an introduction to the lovely
French girl. When he learned that she
was an American he was astonished,
but no less interested, and from the mo
ment tfrey were introduced his atten
tions were marked and devoted. The
acquaintance begun that ni-rht culmi
nated sc-on after in a brilliant wedding.
Monsieur Patenotre was always some
thing of a lady killer, and is not a man
to forgive any slight from the fair sex.
He and Assistant Secretary of State
Rockhill have been throughout on un
friendly terms, the result of an old
trouble in China, where, one afternoon,
Monsieur Potenotre called cm Mrs.
Rockhill and was told that the lady
was engaged. Monsieur # Patenotre
never forgave this, and the rancor be
tween the Rockhills and the French
Minister has been undistnaised and
frank. When Secretary of State Olney
was absent from Washington, and in
tercourse between Mr. Rockhill and
Monsieur Patenotre was unavoidable,
the situation was awkward in the ex
treme.
Tb.e unfortunate Senor Dupuy de
Lome was popular, good looking and
attractive and he had many friends in
Washington to regret his short-sighted
mistake. Senor de Lome's wife did
everything to add to his popularity and
was, perhaps, more of a lobbyist than
any woman in the diplomatic circle. She
combined infinite tact with rare dis
crimination and she did much to sub
due the feeling against Spain.
A diplomatic reception was given at
the "White House this winter, during a
period when discussion on Cuba was
hot in the House and feeling ran high.
How she managed it no one knew. It
must have been the result of skillful
maneuvering â but for over an hour Ma
dame de Lome walked through the spa
cious rooms of the White House on the
arm of Secret-ry Sherman. She was
the observed of all observers and con-
ST. FRANCIS DE ASSISI (MISSION DOLORES) PREVIOUS TO ITS RESTORATION.
Sharing the fate of the other California missions, Mission Dolores gradually fell into partial decay, as portrayed
by the above sketch, drawn from a photograph taken in 1855. Restored laier it is to-day Is as excellent a Â»tatÂ«
oÂ£ preservation, aÂ§ any of. itsÂ» contemporaries, with, tae. posulblo exception of. the mission at SÂ«uuÂ» Barbara
jecture was rife as to the political sig
nificance attached to this promenade.
The De Lome family have many
friends to sympathize, if but few to
condone, for never was a woman more
fitted for political lif- or a man of
more gracious courtly manners. To
add to the sting, their two young sons
must ever be under the cloud of their
father's disgrace and can never aspire
to any position in the country to which
they have returned.
But at least Senor de Lome can re
tire with his grief and hte regrets. Senor
Lazo Arriaga 01 Guatemala, who has
lately lost his wife, cannot be alone
with his sorrow, for he is still repre
senting his country, and he must fill
his place in th_ Washington season.
Senor Lazo Arriaga and his wife were
quoted as an ideal couple, cited as the
love match of the diplomatic corps.
Mme. Lr.zo Arriaga was a Caetilian
beautyâ the type of exquisite, rare
woi-.ankind of which one reads. She
was the idol of her husband, and they
were a noble-looking pair. Mme. 7 zo
Arriag-a's death was particularly sad,
for she left nine children, the youngest
a baby of but a week or two.
Another house with an element of
tragedy hovering about it is that of
the Brazilian legation. Ser.or Men
donca is threatened with total blind
ness, and it is a {.athetic si~ht to see
his wife guiding his steps through the
gay and brilliant assemblages of a
Washington season. Senor Mendonca
has the finest collection of paintings in
Washington. He has the true artistic
temperament, and his pictures have al
ways been his delight. The affliction
that will take from him the sight of his
dearly loved tr sures is particularly
deplorable. Mme. Mendonca looks like
a Spanish woman, though she is an
American. She was born in Maine, but
went to Brazil when quite young.
There she became a governess to Senor
Mendonca's daughters, and while in
that position he fell in love with her.
Strangers always think her a Spaniard
from her appearance and an attractive
little accent.
The most popular receptions in
"Washington are those given by the
Mexican Minister and Mme. Romero.
It is h^rd to define just wherein lies
the secret of their success above oth
ers, but the palm is theirs. Mme. Ro
mero, like Mme. Pat notre, is also from
Philadelphia. She was a Miss Allen, an
heiress and a belle. The Romeros have
been longer in '.he diplomatic corps
thin any other foreign representatives.
Miss Murphy, a handsome San Fran
cisco girl, married a diplomat, Mr.
Vincent Dominguez, secretary of the
legation of the Argentine Republic.
Mme. Dominguez flashed like a meteor
upon the social season; her gowns, her
jewels and her rich beauty making her
a dazzling center for admiring gaze.
But a powerful rival to all these fair
women is the tiny-footed Mrs. Wu, the
'wife of Mr. Wu Ting- Yang, for when
ever she appears she is the center of
attraction. To no woman, no matter
how fond her liege lord, is accorded
such attentions as the Chinese Min
ister showers on his small-footed wife.
After they have made their bows to
host and hostess Mr. Wu invariably
lifts his wife in is arms and carries
her to a seat near by, while the big
footed women of other countries stand
around with the men, and no doubt
often sigh for the enforced repose of
Mrs. Wu.
The Chinese Minister is considered
one of the brightest and wittiest men
In Washington and he has the repu
tation of being able to tell a story that
would make Chauncey Depew look anx
iously to his laurels. At one of tho
famous Gridiron dinners â for which in
vitations are eagerly soug-ht and where
only the brightest and most popular
men obtain access â the best story told
after dinner was that related by Mr.
Wu Ting-Yang.
Mr. Kwai, the interpreter of the Chi
nese legation, is married to a pretty
blonde from Springfield, Massachusetts.
They have one baby, as have also the
Wus, and they all live together in the
Chinese legation.
When the ladies of the legations, the
Ministers and Embassadors, the Secre
tary of State â the only member of the
Cabinet invited to a diplomatic dinner
â and about fifteen distinguished priv
ate citizens assemble at the Whita
House, it is indeed a brilliant gather
ing. The guests, about sixty-three in
all, are presented in the east room to
President and Mrs. McKinley by Col
onel Bingham. First, the four Embas
sadors with Sir Julian Pauncefote at
the head, and then the Ministers in
the order of their arrival at the Cap
itol, the oldest resident coming first.
Mrs. McKinley sits at the right hand of
the President â instead of opposite him
as did Mrs. Cleveland â because she is
subject to fainting spells and her de
voted, lover-like husband wants her by
his side, where she is the recipient of
his watchful attentions. This manner of
placing husband and wife is remarked
upon by many, but, as Herr yon Hol
leben has remarked, it is all in the cus
tom of a country: to a German diplo
mat it is the most natural to see the
President and his wife seated thus, be
cause the Empress always sits at the
right of the Emperor, being considered
the first lady at all times.
Upon Lady Pauncefote devolves the
duty of signaling to the ladies to rise;
perhaps this motion is in many cases
not unwelcome, for in the placing of
sixty-three guests many a trying situ
ation must be involved. No doubt
sparking interchange of thought is la
bored with the Minister from Korea, no
less than when uncongeniality dampens
one's powers of repartee.

FAVORITE DISHES OF WELL KNOWN CHEFS
EGGS, eggs, eggs, eggs in every
way.
How many eggs o you think
are consumed In San Francisco
on Easter Sun<" iy? Just stop and
do a little lightning calculation of
your own before you read on. And
then find that, though you have placed
the figures pretty hieh, you have fallen
wide of the mark. For S-n Francisco
never does anything by halves, and
when it falls a-egg-eating it means
that the chickens have had to do their
level best to provide a supply of rgs
large enough to meet the demand.
Between the hours of sunrise and
Bunset on Easter Sunday 800.000 eggs
are consumed in the city of San Fran
cisco. Eight hundred thousand eggs
demolished In one day! And that Is a
conservative estimate arrived at by
studying facts and figures as found in
the books of produce houses that sup
ply the market with eggs.
Several of the commission merchant*
place the total number of eggs con
sumed at a higher figure. But averag
ing the figures offered by those who
have the necessary data to make a
computation, the result is the startling
fact that 800,000 .eggs are used on Eas
ter Sunday.
The average length of an ci" is 2%
inciies, therefore 800.000 eggs would, if
placed Bide by side, make a line a little
over twenty-eight miles â "â â¢. length. Or
in other words, San Francisco on Eas
ter Sunday consumes twenty-eight
miles of eggs.
According to the City Surveyor s fig
ures it is a little over seven miles from
the foot of Market street to the Cliff
House. If you started in at the foot of
Market street and strung 800,000 eggs,
one touching the other, from that point
to the Cliff House, you would have
enough eggs to place a double row on
each side of the street the entire dis
tance. Ami there would still be enough
left to make scrambled eggs for a hun
dred of the bigsrest egg-eaters that the
city could produce.
.fust to what use the 800.000 eggs or
twenty-eight miles of eggs are put it
is hard to say accurately. A large
jiumber of them are converted into bril
liant colored hard-boiled Easter eggs to
rielight the eyes of the children at the
expense of their stomachs if they at
tempt to eat ti>o many. Easter comes
but once a year and most children are
allowed to give their appetites full
pwing. The number of eggs that one
healthy child can consume is in direct
ratio as Incredibly large as the number
consumed by the entire population.
The hotels and restaurants use an un
usually large number of eggs on Easter.
Nearly everyone eats eggs for break
fast on that day even though they es
chew them or. all other days. Then
dishes are selected for the menus that
require a great many eggs. A great
many families make of the Easter
morning breakfas an egg-eating con
test.
The bakeries do their share to bring
the number up to 800,000. Not only is
the demand for pi s and cakes greater
on holidays, but in order to have their
confections especially good It is neces
sary to use a larger number of eggs
than are ordinarily put into them.
Since there are almost 300.000 people
In San Francisco the 800,000 eggs, if
TIIE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APEIL 10, 1898.
equally distributed, would give each In
dividual 2 2-3 eggs.
In one way or another San Francisco
consumes its twenty-eight miles of eggs
âsoft or hard, colored or natural,
boiled, fried, poached, baked, scrambled
or rolled into an omelette. Some like
them hot some like them cold, children
have even been kn^wn to eat them nine
days old.
Next day there Is generally a sudden
falling off In the egg sales. An anti
egg feeling, as it were, sets in. There
are those who even wait a year before
falling to again. But when Easter
comes round again they join the jubi
lant throng in trying to drive the egg
consumption of San Francisco over the
1,000,000 mark and join the joyous Eas
ter shout of eggs, eggs, eggs.
Of Ruskin Professor Muller says
that he was uncompromising and se
vere onl;' with his pen. "He was re
ally the most tolerant and agree
able man in society. He could dis
cover beauty where no one else could
see it, and make allowances where
others saw no excuse. I remember
him as diffident as a young girl, full
of questions, and grateful for any in
formation. Even on art topics I have
watched him listening almost defer
entially to others who laid down the
law in his presence. His voice was al
ways most winni.-g, and his language
simply perfect. He was one of the
few Englishmen I knew who, instead
of tumbling out their sentences like so
many portmanteaus, bags, rugs and
hat boxes from an open railway van,
seemed to take a real delight in build
ing up their sentences, even in famil
iar conversation, so as to make each
deliverance a work of art. Later in
life that even temperament may have
suffered much, and one saw that his
wounds had not quite healed."
If ever there was an active, power
ful brain, adds Muller, !t was Rus
kin's. He worked very hard, "but I
doubt whether hard work by itself can
ever upset a healthy brain. His was a
very sensitive nature, and an over
wrought sensitiveness is much more
likely to cause mischief than steady
intellectual effort.
"I remember taking Emerson to
lunch with him in his rooms in Corpus
Christi College. Emerson was an old
friend of his. and in many respects a
cognate soul. But some quite different
subject turned up, a heated discussion
ensued, and Ruskin was so upset that
he had to quit the room and leave us
alone. Emerson was most unhappy
and did all he could to make peace,
but he had to., leave without a recon
ciliation. , â ', â ,
"It is very difficult to make allow
ance for these gradual failures or
brain power." â
Matthew Arnold Professor Mulier
had known at Oxford as an under
graduate, and he watched and ad
mired him to the end of his life. He
was beautiful as a young man, strong
and manly, yet full of dreams and
schemes. His Olympian manners be
gan even at Oxford; there was no
harm in them, they were natural, not
put on. The very sound of his voice
was Jovelike."
He was a delightful man to argue
with, not that he could easily be con
vinced that he was wrong, but he
never lost his temper, and in the most
patronizing way he would generally
end by, "Yes, yes! my good fellow, you
are quite right, but, you see, my vieÂ«.
of the matter Is different, and I hare
little doubt it is the true one!"
Of living personages, and especially
of living royalties, Professor Muller
abstains from recording his recollec
tions, a wise abstention, yet one which
undoubtedly robs his readers of much,
interesting material. But here and
there a harmless anecdote finds its
way through his reticence.
Thus he resolutely closes his lips in
regard to the Prince of Wales' stay
at Oxford, save that he considers
himself entitled to produce one small
treasure from the many he has stored
in his memory. This is a sixpence
which he won from his royal highness
at whist.
"I have always been a very bad whist
player, but good luck would have it
that I won a sixpence at Frewen Hall,
the Prince's residence at Oxford. The
Prince maintained that I had calcu
lated my points wrongly, but not be
ing a courtier, I held my own, and
actually appealed to General Bruce
When he decided in my favor, the
Prince graciously handed me my six
pence, which I have kept ever since
among my treasures."THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 10, 1898,

At the meeting of the Daughters of
Montezuma Council in its wigwam last
Monday night two palefaces were adopt

and the passing of a social hour.

Ir\ Charity's Name.
The Board of Lady Managers of the
Eye and Ear Hospital, at 1107 Sutter
street, have undertaken to give a musl
cale and tea on the 16th of this month
at the residence of Mrs. Rebecca Jen
nings, which has been generously placed
at their disposal for the purpose. The
entertainment will be conducted in rather
a novel manner. It will not adhere to the
customary rigid programmes of such
affairs. Instead, it is intended to pre
sent specimens of the music of all na
tions, performed by appropriately cos
tumed performers, especial attention be
ing given to that of the Orient and its
peculiarly picturesque adornment. The
affair will borrow additional eclat fronÂ»
being held in a favorable social environ
ment and under the auspices of so many
prominent ladies who constitute the
patrons of the worthy charity.
The young ladies who belong to the
auxiliary of the Children's Hospital de
termined to give up a day of each week
during Lent to sewing; not toying with
the needle and thread, concocting useless
trifles, but real serious sewing. And so
yards and yards of bright tennis flannel
were bought, scissors snapped merrily
fingers unused to the needle became deft
with practice, and the result is a heaping
pile of dainty little sacques.
This morning every child in the hospital
will be given one of these sacques. There
are pale pinks, dainty, blues, brilliant
crimsons and every other conceivable
shade to delight the eyes of the children.
And they are so soft and comfortable
in addition to being pretty. The chil
dren ought to have them, but many of
them are without them. One day one of
the doctors casually remarked "that it
would be a very pleasant thing for the
sick children if someone could devote one
afternoon a week in reading and playing
with them. And so it was that several
young ladies determined that the best
way to observe Lent would be to supply
this deficiency.
The young ladies who have met every
week to sew on these sacaues are the
Misses Ella Morgan, Mollie Thomas,
Helen Thomas, Therese Morgan, Helen
Hopkins, Edna Hopkins, Caro Crockett,
Emily Carolan, Genevieve Carolan, Alice
Hagar, Bertha Smith, Minnie Houghton,
Mary Eyre, Laura Bates, Gertrude Bates,
Miriam Moore, Frances Moore, Julia Av
erill, Clara Smedberg and Edith McÃean.

. .. .. ;7.-;;.-.- - â ' â -; ->Church Windows.
FOR the combined purposes of ornamentation, practical use and the 11
lustration of religious thought, no portion of a sacred edifice Is more
rtant than its windows. In them the art of the day finds expres
through the grace of the designer and the skill of the painter; the
resa of the stained glass industry of the period is manifest, the
taptp? â  !' the people apparent and their faiths and dogmas set forth so dis
tinctly that the historian, by turning to them, can discern at a glance the
artisanship and spiritual condition of the era In which the windows were
placed. Indeed, as monuments of historical worth, church windows can
scarcely be surpassed In value. By their mute yet eloquent agency, the mile
stones of religious progress may be traced from the sixth century to the pres
ent day, for colored windows existed at Constantinople at that time and also
in St. Peter's at Rome, and historians agree that they were in use as early
a? the third century. In Alsace may bt? seen a window of the eleventh cen
tury, undoubtedly the oldest specimen of the stained glass art which has sur

sanctuary window in the cathedral at Sacramento and
the transept windows in St. Francis de Sales, Oakland.
Three fine memorial windows have been recently
placed in Trinity Episcopal Church by Walter E. Dean,
George Marye Jr. and George A. Pope. These represent
Munich in ecclesiastical art, the subjects being "Christ
og Little Children," "The Resurrection" and "Ser
mon on the Mount." A pretty window, though not large,
in Trinity is a X" >i n t â¢ '<l <me in the southeast transept, rep
resenting the baptism of Jesus Christ by St. John. A hand
some gift is the Calef window in the west wall.
A London window in Grace Church represents "Christ
ing Little Children." The same subject is carried
out with tenderness and skfil in the chapel of Maria Kip
â¢'â¢rphan.'tgf, the only stained glass window placed there,
and a beautiful piece of work.
St. Ignatius, one of the finest structures of its kind In
the United States and owning the largest and finest or
gan in the country, has only foreign windows in its mas
sive walls. St. B^rigid's is ornamented by a handsome
circular window some eight feet in diameter, exceedingly
rich in coloring, the center space presenting a life-like
portrait of the late Archbishop Alemany. Three win
dows in the Russian church are of local origin.
St. Mary's Church of the Paulist Fathers, for many
years a landmark on California street, has fourteen win
dows of especial interest. The two largest portray re
spectively "St. Paul Preaching at Athens," after Raphael's
Famous painting, and "The Conversion of St. Paul," after
Rubens. The Frank J. Sullivan memorial is a notice
ably fine window in St. Mary's.
St. Mary's Cathedral on Van Ness avenue, a splendid
plr-ro of architecture, has five local figure-windows of
much-admired workmanship, the majority of the others
being European. An Eastern memorial window of original
design is that In the Spanish Church on Broadway, lllus-

France and Germany claim
the distinction of discover
ing the art, but It is prob
ably in Italy that it was
conceived. During the thir
teenth century Italy gave
the works of many masters
to the world, but with the
passing of the centuries
her achievements have
ceased, and Germany now
leads in this, one of the
most noble of the arts.
The windows of the mod
ern house of worship are
the last subjects for con
sideration of the builders.
They do not, as a rule, ever
enter into the plans of the
contractor, but are the
gifts of wealthy members
of the congregation. The
erection of memorial and
decorative windows has
long been a custom both
appropriate and interest
ing, and fortunes innum
erable are yearly expend
ed in this way throughout
the world.
San Francisco, though so

The Frauen Verein some years ago gave a costly window to St. Paul's
Lutheran Church. Upon its left is Ste Paul with sword, to the right St. Pe
ter with keys; above, Bible, chalice and dove. The effect is striking, the
color scheme and execution most excellent.
"Christ Walking on the Water" is the theme of a very artistic piece of
work in St. Peter's on Alabama street. St. Francis is fortunate in its pos
session of "Our Lady of Lourdes" and "Sacred Heart." A window of note
in Westminster Presbyterian is the Greenwood memorial.
St. Dominic's has a beautiful window, delicate in coloring, yet charmingly
distinct, representing St. Raymon. The window attracts by reason of its ad
mirable detail, rather than its size.
Holman Hunt's celebrated picture, "Light of the World," is repeated with
fine effect in glass in St. John's Episcopal Church. The chancel windows here
are worthy of study. They are originals and represent the nativity, cruci
fixion and resurrection. Another notable window, a memorial, is the one ded
icated to St. John, in St. John's Presbyterian Church. The figure is finely
done and the coloring exceptionally pleasing.
St. Joseph's
has a sanctuary

Its blended and

Bubject. Here also the eye
rests with admiration upon
two memorial works of

ROUND
WINDOW,
ST. BRiGID'S
CHURCH.
The custom of giving win
dows to churches is charac
teristic of all countries.
Gifts of superb masterpieces
are a source of pride and
pleasure to the donor, and no
testimonial of regard for a
dear one passed away or of
interest in the perpetuation
of religious thought, could
be more satisfactory or en
during. A handsome church
window is literally a thing
of beauty and a joy forever,
for unless wantonly destroy
ed by an act of vandalism it
is capable of withstanding
the forces of nature for cen
turies untold. Throughout
the ages it may serve the
manifold purposes of protec
tion from the elements, of
demonstration that a re
markable branch of art may
outlive nations themselves,
and of providing an object
lesson of singular historic in
terest. Thus the giver of a
window knows that the deed
is not one to last but a day
or a lifetime, but for a pe
riod the length of which no
prophet may determine.
The chief peculiarity of
church windows Is the irreg
ular system of lines travers
ing their surface, sharply
visible within as black divid
ing marks, but noticeable
from without as merely a
metallic means of connect
ing the colored panels. Opin
ion varies as to the desira
bility of these in point of
beauty, and unsuccessful at
tempts have been made to do
away with them, but their
utility in fastening together
the many pieces of mosaic
and the strength thus given to the whole make them indispensable. Ribbons of lead,
soldered at every angle, furnish this required support. So much a component cart of
the art are these lines that to eliminate them would d t th ti h f t
him who has studied with feeling the subject of windows
as offerings at the shrine of religion. In no way do they
interfere with the pictured whole, if properly placed.
Artists who paint on glass are confronted with condi
tions entirely absent from those in which the painter of
canvases employs his skill. It will be readily understood
that the methods of painting upon opaque and transpar
ent surfaces are essentially different. Outlines must be
sufficiently sharp to be seen clearly at a distance, else
the effect will be either wholly or partially lost upon the
observer, when figures are reproduced. In short, it is a
department of the painter's art that is a law unto itself.
The high lights are the natural color of the glass, known
to the artistas "pure" or "local" color. To produce
shadows or accentuated colors the enamel is laid on with
corresponding thickness. The glass must previously be
burnt very carefully in order to fix the enamel thereon. Dur
ing the last century England produced a number of not
able glass painters who have left us some fine specimens
of their handiwork.
THE NATIVITY, ST. IGNATIUS CHURCH.
Inseparable from the thought of church worship is the
softened, prismatic light cast within by transparent pic
tures that are sermons in themselves. He who con
structs them leaves a niche for himself In history, but of
those who see his achievements comparatively few realize
or appreciate the Infinite pains he has taken to produce
such results, or the high order of talent and careful plan
ning necessary to accomplish them. The maker of win
dows must be in thorough accord with his work in order
to be successful. He must be a student, a mechanic and
an artist, his idea of the fitness of things unerring, his
judgment thoroughly reliable. The slightest incongruity
in the work is not only perceived by all who are capa
ble of criticizing Its quality, but it will remain a lasting
reproach to him. There is no more pitiless searcher for
defects than the daylight, which, penetrating a window,
reveals its Imperfections, or, finding none, brings forth
for admiration of the observer the wonders that the maker
has wrought.
"When barrel organs, once the usual accompaniment of
the magic lantern, came into use, a native of the prov
ince of Tende was one of the first who traveled about
Europe with this Instrument.
In his peregrinations he collected money enough to
enable him to purchase from the King of Sardinia the
title of count of the country where he was born â for
which, probably, in a time of war, he did not pay above
a thousand guineas.
With the remainder of his money he purchased an es
tate suitable to his rank, and settled himself peaceably
for the remainder of his days in his mansion.
In the entrance hall of his dwelling he hung up his
magic lantern and his organ facing the door, there to
be carefully preserved till they moldered to dust; and
he ordered by his will that any one of his descendants who
should cause them to be removed should forfeit his in
heritance, and his patrimony revert to the next heir, or,
in failure of a successor, to the hospital of Tende.
Only a few years ago the organ and lantern wert still
to be seen carefully preserved.

TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS.
The convention of the Southern Cali
fornia Teachers' Association, which was
held In Los Angeles during March 31 to
April 2, was largely attended by dele
gations of teachers from all the southern
counties.
One of the most Interesting talks of
the session was by Professor Starbuck of
Stanford, who took for his subject a
phase of child study which he called
ire Hewa First in the Rough." Pro
fessor Starbuck began by describing how
nature builds in minerals and in plants,
and then said that the teacher is learn
ing the secret that the same process of
development is followed in the human
being. If all this were thoroughly un-
Serstood, it would aid very materially in j
:he work of the school room.
Professor Starbuck emphasized the im
portance of kindergartens and manual
training in bringing all the activities of
\.he child into play. Touch, he asserted,
.s also fundamental, and at 12 years the
'.hinking machinery should be developed.
Esthetics and morals are tho funda
mentals of child nature. We must see
that these fundamentals are deeply in- |
grained in the child, and then nature will I
:ake tare of its own.
Professor J. IL Guinn made a strong
plea for systematic teaching of local his
tory as a "means of cultivating a love for
the subject and also as a preliminary j
step in the study of national and general
history.
"No State," said the speaker, "has a
more instructive, a more interesting or a i
more varied history than California, and
no State has had so many different forms

then the Pacific republic with the bear !

and lastly a sovereign State of the Union. !

and possibly the pupil's back to heal.
"In the forty years that Los Angeles
was under Spanish rulo there was but

The professor concluded his address
thus:

EDUCATION IN SANTA CRUZ.
Santa Cruz Ccinty has a school system
of which It Is justly proud, not only on
account of the. high standard that has
been attained, but because it dates as far
back as IM9â the year of gold. Few of
our California counties can make a like
boast.
The first school in Santa Cruz of which
there is any record was private, con
ducted by a Mrs. Case. One or two other
private schools were also opened a little
later, but a public school with an enroll
ment of twenty-five pupils was started In
1853 by Mr. Frick.
In 18C9 we find >0 pupils recorded.
Other school houses "were erected as the
need came, and In IST6 a high school was
established, which -was regarded with
great pride by the townspeople. Profes
sor \V. \V. Anderson was the first prin
cipal, and the school prospered under his
administration.
Mr. D. C. Clark was chosen principal
! in 18S4, and has ever since remained in
charge of the school. From the beginning
of his administration, and later as City
Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Clark has
! spared no time nor energy to advance tho
; cause of education in his chosen field. Ho
at once began to remodel the course of
study in the schools, and with the aid
of the county superintendent. J. W. Lin
i scott, and a corps of forty-four willing
| and efficient teachers, he placed the
| schools upon the firm basis they occupy
| to-day, and so spread the fame of them
' that "pupils from other counties flocked
in, until the old school houses were over
crowded. This necessitated the erection
of the new Lincoln School and the recon
struction of the Laurel and Branclforte
buildings.
In 18t>9 the University of California rec
ognized the excellence of the. preparatory
work accomplished In the high school,
and placed the school on Its accredited
' list. Miss Minnie Sullivan and Louis
Bernhelm were the first graduates to
enter the. State University.
Connected with the public schools of
Santa Cruz is a free kindergarten em
ploying two teachers. This is also under
the management of Mr. Clark.

FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY.
Last week, after one of the most suc
cessful meetings ever held there, the
San Bernardino County Teachers' Insti
tute adjourned to meet for the remain
ing three days with the Southern Cali
fornia Teachers' Association in Los An
i geles.
Tho sessions were held in the High
School building in San Bernardino, and
great interest and enthusiasm was mani
fested in the entire programme.
Interest was manifested in the speci
mens of drawing, penmanship, composi
tion and science work from the various
county schools which decorated the walls
and tables. One of the most artistic fea
tures of the display, classed as drawing,
was the modeling, paper cutting, fold
ing, designing, border making, etc., which
showed a commendable beginning In the
line of manual training. The Lugonia
and the Redlands schools exhibited cred
itable work In sewing and drafting on
paper.

THE SHAPING OF MODELS.
Once -in the presence of Disraeli an
over-confident youth ventured to ridicule
the proverb makers. "Any one," he said,
"could make proverbs in quantity." And
the statesman answered: "MaKe a few!"
It is needless to say thnt. had the young
man accepted the challenge, he would
have acquired a sudden and lasting re
spect for a genuine proverb.
Now a series of Sloyd models is a good
deal like a collection of proverbs. They
are plain, unpretentious affairs, but there
is a great deal in the reason of their be
ing. The original Sloyd school at Naas,
Sweden, has been in operation for twen
ty-five years, yet Dr. Saloman's teachers
aYe still altering the courses, each year
introducing new models and modifica
tions of old ones.
Recent years have seen numerous am
bitious attempts made, both In this coun
try and England, to originate systems of
manual training, but thus far there is
not a successful elementary manual
training course In operation in either
country that has not Naas to thank for
its foundation principles. These princi
ples are:
L Gradation of difficulty.
The exercises must proceed from
known to unknown, from simple to com
plex, from the easy to the difficult. In
this respect articles made of wood are
very misleading In appearance. But tho
basis of organization lies not In the mod
els themselves, but In' the tool exercises
which they embody. Here, then, Is a
question of tool-sequence:
Are Borne of the wood-working tools
easier of manipulation than others?
Of two or more exercises with the same
tool, may one be easier than another?
The answer in both cases is affirmative.
It Is a simple enough matter to roughly
cut a stick in two with a cross-cut saw,
but quite another to put a good bevel on
that same stick with a chisel.
The Naas people think the Sloyd knife
is the best adapted for the beginning, and
so the first two or three models of the
Naas series are small modeled articles re
quiring the use of the knife. In England
it does not seem to have occurred to them
that there is such a thing as tool se
quence, except among tho teachers, who
are following the Swedish system.

UNDER THE DUTCHMAN'S RULE
SHREWSBURYâ By Stanley J. Weyman.
New York: Longmans. Green & Co.
For sale by Doxey. Price $1 50.
Of the historical novelists of the modern
school there is probably no writer who
turns out his work in a more clear cut,
conscientious fashion than Mr. Weyman.
If he is less romantic than Anthony
Hope, if his heroes lack the blind dare
devil chivalry of Conan Doyle's, he Is at
any rate more graphic -and concise, his
Characters move naturally in their ap
pointed epoch, and nothing of local color
that careful study of the period can pro
vfde Is lacking.
It Is difficUit. however, in spite of the
admirable technique displayed, to follow
the developments of this novel with sus
tained interest. It is a complicated story
of court intrigues during that stormy
period of English political life which fol
lowed the downfall of the Stuarts and the
restoration of the Protestant succession.
William 111, promoted from the humble
position of stadtholder in Holland to
the dazzling position of King of England,
was but Insecurely seated on the throne.
Many of the nobles and a large propor
tion of the commonalty were opposed to
his rule, the air was full of intrigue, and |
plot after plot for his deposition and for '
the restoration of King James was form- j
future, physiological psychology wu
likely have a say. Ltanley Hall and oth
ers are showing that the musculr- or
ganization of a child does not develop
simultaneously throughout. Thus, a ciind
has learned to push his arms about and
run while It is still a difficult matter ior
him to pick up a pin.
J. Liberty Todd of Philadelphia has de
veloped a remarkable system of drawing
on this basis, Jus younger pupils stand
at the board, and with both hands tiraw
large free designs in place of the crariped
affairs usually found In drawing-books.
There is food for thought here for those
who are trying to drag woodwork down
into the primary grades, the proper place
for clay modeling an^ caruooard work.
We cannot develop the pupils' self-re
liance by doing nls work for him or caus
ing It to be done by machinery. So the
Sloyd idea requires that the exercises
shall be reasonably within the pupil's
ability of performance.
The suggested use of models is import
ant. A birdcage does not moke for tne
highest motive. A birdhouse does. In
general, all models making for destruc
tion and detention are to be quietly dis
placed for those which are constructive
a. id altruistic .n their suggestions.
In shaping model series, the American
tendency of late years gives preferment
to school apparatus over articles of home

I recently adopted resolutions favoring the
cd. only to end In exposure and the de
1 capitation of the chief movers on Tower
: Hiii.
It is mnrvelous how William manager!
to escape all these dangers, and to main
j tain his hold on the affections of the Eng-
I Ilsh people. Jt may be that he was only
' accepted as a pis aller. that the memory
of Stuart tyranny and misrule was too
recent in the minds of men to allow of
the revival of this dynasty. Or it may be.
if Mr. Weyman's picture of the King Is
correct, that the was much in the man
to command admiration and respect: that
he had the Inborn dignity of royalty and
a full share of that mysterious magnetic
power which compels allegiance.
We see William first just at the time of
the great assassination plot, when a
scheme to waylay and murder him while
out hunting came perilously near suc
cess. Our first glimpse of the monarch
is at Kensington Court, when the nar
rator of the story, a humble clerk, is
| brought unexpectedly Into the presence of
the King.
"We stood upon the threshold of a wide
and splendid gallery, set here and there
with huge china vases and hung with
pictures, which even then I discerned to
be of great beauty and afterwards learned
were of no less value. Letting my eyes
travel down this vista they paused na
turally on a spot under one of the win
i dows, where with his back to us and
ribbons In his hands a slight gentleman,
who stooped somewhat and was dressed
in black, ambled and paced In front of a
child of four or five years old. The wintry
sunlight which fell in cold bars -on the
floor proved his progress to be more
I showy than real; nevertheless the child
i shrieked in its joy, and dancing, jerked
! the ribbons and waved a tiny whip. In
i answer the gentleman, whose long curled
â¢ periwig bobbed oddly on his shouldersâ
j he had his back to usâ pranced more and
; more stoutly, though on legs a little thin
and bent."
Quite a pretty picture of royal relaxa
tion, illustrating the human side of kingly
i life. It is the more remarkable when con
! trusted with the following description of
I William's personal appearance: "He had
! a long sallow face, which seemed the sal
lower for the dark heavy wig that fell
I round it; a large hooked nose and full,
| peevish lips, with eyes both bright and
j morose. I am told that he seldom smiled
j and never laughed."
Later on in the volume the hero, an
Insignificant individual of the name of
Price, is again brought into personal con
! tact with his monarch and this lime we
j get an outline of the sterner side of Wil
i liam's character. The state council is in
| quiring into the abortive assassination
j plot and one of its prime instigators. Sir
' John Fenwick, is under examination. The
! King enters unannounced and very quiet
ly. "His entrance and words, abrupt, if
not awkward, lacked alike the grace which
all remembered in Charles and the gloomy
majesty which the second James had at
his command. And men felt the lack.
Yet as he took his stand, one hand lightly
resting on the back of the Lord Steward's
chair, the stooping, somber figure and
sallow, withered face staring out of its
great peruque had a dignity of their own.
For it could not be forgotten that he was
that which no Stuart King of England
had ever beenâ a soldier and commander
from boyhoodâ at home, in all the camps
of Flanders and the Rhine, familiar with
every peril of battle and breach; at his
ease anywhere, where other men
blanched and drew back."
These quotations illustrate Mr. Wey
man's facile gift of character delineation.
The Duke of Shrewsbury, Sir John Fen
wick and various other notables of the
time are pictured with equal strength.
But It is upon that mysterious personage
known as Ferguson the Kingmaker that
our author lavishes most of his talent.
This master of backstairs intrigue plays
a prominent part in the story, though it
is impossible within the limits of a brief
notice to unravel all the complications of
plot and counterplot which crowd the
pages of the book. Here is Ferguson as
he first appears to the narrator: "Such
A NOVEL SCHOOL BUILDING.
New York is to have what it is hoped will be a model school building,
which is to be erected on One Hundred and Fourth street, running through
to One Hundred and Fifth street, west of First avenue. It will be built in
the form of a letter H, thus making room for large open playgrounds on
either side. It will be five stories high and built with a steel skeleton.
The first story includes boys' and girls' play rooms, wainscoted with
glazed brick and floored with asphalt, and furnished with abundant facilities
for obtaining drinking water. In one of the wings two kindergarten rooms
have been Jaid out, with direct communication with the courtyard. The main
entrance has a tiled floor. Offices for the medical inspector and janitor ad
join the vestibule. These also have tiled floors and are furnished with all ne
cessary conveniences.
The second, third and fourth stories are divided into sixteen class rooms
each, a total of forty-eight. The wardrobes are outside the class rooms and
are so arranged as to be easily accessible. They are als<? thoroughly venti
late i and each has a coil of steam pipe to dry clothing when damp and to
maintain a circulation of air. The fifth story is designed to provide for man
ual and physical training and to supply room for a library and reading room.
This building will be heated by a system which provides for each child
thirty cubic feet of warm, fresh air per minute, and which also provides for
the removal of foul air. The furniture will be of the most mode .1, adjustable
type, while the sanitary appliances will also be of the most approved and
modern style.

Possibly the hero's weakness is purposely
exaggerated in order to accentuate the
strength of the other actors in the drama.

given us a very vivid presentation of
London life and character at the close of

OF THE MELODRAMA AND THE ACTING
AT MOROSCO'S.
The other night I crossed the equator
to Morosco's and saw every one of the
five acts and the scenes of "Hands<
Across the Sea." It is a representa
tive Adelphi melodrama by Pittit and
Sims, and the performance of it was a
very decent one. Morosco'a is a good
place to visitâ not too often, but just
and then of a dull night in a dull
week. There you find a performance
that is characteristic ncting that is
sometimes delightfully and memorably
â  :. ; sometimes amazingly good, al-
S!i;;ke?peareari in its resonance
and elaboration; and above all you
t'.iid atmosphere. MoroÃOo'a is the one
theater in San Francisco that *has an
atmosphere distinctly its own, as it is
ihe one theater that can boast an ab
solute clientele, a special following,
which is ever faithful and entirely its
ov. n. The Morosco audience shares im
portance with the Morosco play and
actor in making: the Morosco atmos
phere. Th-* audience may vary in size,
but night by night, week by week, it is
thÂ« ?nmf in appearance and in tempw,
always dependable, - nexactine and dr
termined to be entertained. Even the
oppopir.gr element, the infinitely smaller
crowd that goes to laugh and flatter its
cynicism in being unmoved by ready
made sentiment and sensation, is al
ways the same, and in its minority and
lneffectualness a very emphasis to the
characteristic atmosphere of the house.
The people who go seriously to Moros
co'? knuw what they want: their de
sires are modest and unchanging; they
pive the mnnn cement a. standing order
f. >r life, and the management has the
good sense to till it.
Think of it! They put on flfty-two
melodramas a year at Morosco's! And
all alike! Sometimes I wonder how it
is they can keep from petting some
thing different. Suppose a play should
.. some night ami brazenly refuse
to employ the dark Aside, the subtle
Soliloquy and the Marvelous Coinci
dence; and Biippose in addition to this
it should insolently scorn to portion off
the virtue, suffering, comicality and
crime in the sacred old wayâ then what
would happen, do you think? But of
course there Is no danger and no use
Thinking. Morosco never trifles with
the emotions of his audience. He pre
to surprise them and they pre
â¢ be surprised, but there to a nice
ling between them that is
Inviolable.
Everything at Morosco's is on the
largest possible scaleâ the play, the act-
Ing, the theater, all conspire to produce
:Tect of hugeness. Nothing Is done
simply that can as well be accomplish
. d with elaboration. Nothing, not even
the simplest fact, is left unexplained.
How tritely erroneous is the statement
that the deed, not the word, counts in
; . Irama! I would wager there is
â¢ leisurely conversation in the ay-
Adelphl piece than in the draw
ing-room polemics of Pinero. If there
place where action does not
ler than words, it is In mcl
â '. here every deed is forecast
ne speech and commemorated in
of the same. The villain would
rob, kill, ruinâ must you wait till his
dastard work is done before knowing
all about it? Never: His gnarled
"nance alone would tell the tale,
but that is not enough; in ominous
tones he plans it over to himself, or,
5, he may even tell his victim.
There is a sort of assistant villain in
"Hands Across the Sea," a French
count of mean morals, who breaks into
thÂ»? hero's house, intending no good to
the hero's wife, who is alone and un
protected. Already you have heard
him plan to get the hero away from
home at this hour, and you know his
evil purpose. So, once in the house
and face to face with the woman, docs
he behave as the mere count of smooth
c- very-day humanity would behave?
Not on your life. He tells her all about
it, too. He would tell her his whole
grimy past and future as well if the
hero did not return punctually several
hours earlier than he had been ex
pected, deliver a few verbal knock
outs and finally fit the action to the
words. There is nothing so prodigious
ly careful, confidential and explana
tory as melodrama.
Taken all round "Hands Across the
Sea" Is easily the best production I
have ever seen at Morosco's. The ex
terior scenes, especially the one of the
steamer's dfÂ»ck with the moving French
man-o'-war ok In the distance, are
fitted to the big stage with a fine sense
of space, and the acting is remarkably
forceful and even. A pood scene or two
is quite an e very-week occurrence at
Sforpsoo's, but ti.is time the acting
ptruck me aa a special effort. The cast

lightning change of bill from week to

"The Devil's Disciple" would refute

Is' for want of this process of elabora
tion that Shakespeare â unsurpassed as
poet, story-teller, character draughts
man, humorist and rhetoricianâ hae left
us no intellectually coherent drama,
and could not pursue a genuinely scien
tific method in his studies of character
and society."
In place of the familiar directions
and scenic specifications the "Plays.
Pleasant and Unpleasant" of Bernard
Shaw will be annotated with finished
descriptions, vivid character sketches,
psychologic notes and sallies of a
characteristic mordant type. The first
volume will consist of those plays
which the author is pleased to term
"unpleasant" â the unpleasantness ly
ing in the fact that they convict the
capitalist phase of modern social or
ganization, and are written from the
point of view of a socialist who regards
the basis of middle class society as
thoroughly rotten, economically and
morally. Under this heading come
"Widowers' Houses," "The Philan
derer" and "Mrs. Warren's Profes
sion." The root idea of the first
named is the rich suburban villa
standing on the rents of the foul rook
ery; of the second, a four-act topical
comedy, the fashionable cults of Ibsen
ism and "New Wornanism" on a basis
of clandestine sensualityâ the Inde
pendent Theater refused to produce it
on account of its "immorality:" while,
in the third, Mrs. Warren taxes society
with her occupation, which is that of a
procuress.
Volume llâ "Pleasant Plays"â will
comprise "Arms and the Man," the
sparkling comedy in three acts, of
youthful romance and disillusion,
' which was the despair of the critics on
â  its production in London and New
York; "The Man of Destiny," a one-act
I comedy, in which Sir Henry Irving had
! intended to appear as the youthful Xa
i poleon; "You Never Can Tell," a four
act modern comedy concerned with the
! adventures of a sparkling pair of twins,
! and "Candida," a frankly sentimental
j play, which Mr. Shaw hopes to find vn r
; derst.mded of women, if not of men.
For some reason or other his latest
and most successful piny, "The Devil's,
; Disciple," will not be among the plays
printed. The books will be published â¢
! nere by Stone & Co. of New York, and
| in London by Grant Richards.
Even the glorious Molba is not '
j above the tune of the twittering press j
! agent. This came neatly typewritten:
Long before Melba had any thought of
a public career the fame of her beautiful
voice had become known, and she was
' in frequent request to sing at charity
i concerts, in Mcl bourne, much to the dis
! pleasure of her parents, strict Scotch !
1 Presbyterians, who were greatly opposed
to her appearance in public. After
awhile it occurred to her that it would
be a good idea to give a concert on her
â¢wn account, at which she might expect
the patronage of those whom she had
Â«o frequently served. AceoruTsgly she
â¢â â¢ngaged a lia.ll, made ail her arrange
ments, and started out to sell the tick
ets. Her father, however, recognizing
with joy his opportunity to cure her of
'ier inclination to sing in public, set about
'o secure a disastrous result for the con
cert by previously calling on her friends
and pledging them, its a favor to him.
to decline to buy. The result was that
when the eventful evening came Melbu
found herself confronted by a select but
diminutive audience of two. Nothing
daunted, she gave the entire concert ac
conling to programme; and, later, when
bills for hall rent and advertising were
presented, suspecting the trick he had
nerved her, sent her creditors to her
father, who. by that time, convinced that
his brilliant scheme had failed of its
hoped-for result, and with a secret admi
ration of his daughter's plunk, paid them
willingly. It cannot be doubted that her
splendid career has long since removed
his early objection, which, had it been
successful, would have deprived the world
of song of its most shining light.
Baldwin.
The latest Hoyt farce, "A Stranger in
New York," is announced for produc
tion at the Baldwin to-morrow night.
The farce is given the credit of being
an unusually bright one, with action
swift and tireless, and not a moment
of weariness between the first and final
curtains.
The story is rather more complicated
than most of those in which Mr. Hoyt
has dealt, and tells of an old chap from
Chicago, with a letter of introduction
to a New York man about town. He
arrives in the metropolis with the ma-
tention of attending the French ball in
Madison-square Garden. He loses his
letter, which is picked up and de
livered by a stranger who has no desire
to deceive, but who is welcomed with
such cordiality as would have been
shown to the real person for
whom the communication was written,
that he has no chance to withdraw,
and finds himself all at once in the cen
ter of a brisk whirl of gayety.
The other, for whom the letter was
penned, discovers the error which has
been made and starts in brisk but
hopeless pursuit.
This portion of the action takes
place in one of the corridors of the
Hoffman House. The next chapter is
unfolded in a room in the tower of
Madison-square Garden, occupied as a
studio by one of New York's charac
ters. In the end the stranger finds an
opportunity to disclose his identity,
but he has come to be well regarded by
ll the other personages, and loses
nothing through the deception in which
he had unwittingly participated. The
locale of the piece gives opportunity
for handsome settings and the glitter
and glamour of the French ball Is re
produced. It is said, with striking ef
fect. The play is full of new music by
Richard Suihl ana A. B. Sloane.
At the head of the company cornea
Anna Boyd, of known quality, and Joe
Coyne, new to us, but with a reputa
tion in the East. Others in the cast
are: Charles Dungan, John Dudley,
W. H. Hatter, Harry Rodgers, Steve
Maley, Sam Marion. John Mitchell,
Willia Martin. Ed Worm, Willie Mar
tin, Thomas Quinn, Minnie McEvoy,
Minnie Bridges, Camille Cleveland, Liz
zie McCoy, Nellie McCoy and Amy
Muller.
The attraction to follow "A Stranger
in New York" at the Baldwin is "The
Purser." which Ferris Hartman will
bring out.
Ga!iforr\ia.
Edward Harrigan will present at the
California to-night "Old Lavender," the
most popular and surely the most
earnest of all his many plays. To the
older playgoers it will be interesting to
see how the play and player have worn,
and to the younger generation the per
formance should be uniquely entertain
ing. Mr. Harrigan is one of the pio
neer American dramatists, and in his
day enjoyed an almost unrivaled
vogue. The character of Old Lavender
is full of quiet pathos and observation,
and is remembered here as his master
piece, both in authorship and acting.
It is hardly to be expected that the
present company will come irp wUh our
recollections of the original one, but it
Is said that Mr. Harrigan has rebanded
his players with considerable tact and
preserved all the traditions of the parts.
Dave Braham will play Dick, the
Rat. the role made famous by the
late Tony Hart, and all the original
Braham songs will be sung.
Columbia.
Mr. Herne begins the second and last
1 week of "Shore Acres" at the Colum
j bia to-morrow evening. The houses
'â  have been uniformly large and the
' prospects for the closing performances
j are the brightest the play has yet en
' joyed in this city. Miss Marion Cul
i len, who has been playing Perley dur
: ing the past week, will exchange roles
I with Miss Julie A. Herne for the clos
; ing week. Miss Cullen is a protege of
i Denman Thompson and for two sea
j sons was a prominent feature in the
veteran actor's production. It is Mr.
Herne's intention to withdraw from
"Shore Acres" at the close of the pres
! ent season as he is anxious to stage
i his new work, "The Rev. Griffith Da-
I venport." This new play will be fol
lowed by "Silas Lapham," which "Wil
liam Dean Howells is having drama
tized for Mr. Herne. A second com
pany playing "Shure Acres" is headed
by Archie Boyd, and. although con
fined mostly to one-night stands, it is
meeting with financial prosperity in
the East and Middle West.
"Nancy Hanks," a comedy success of
the present season, is announced to fol
low "Shore Acres" at the Columbia
Theater on the 18th inst. At the head
of the presenting company will appear
Marie Jansen.
It is not a racing play as the title
may indicate; the "Nancy Hanks" re
ferred to is not a horse, but a gold
mine, or rather a mine that has been
"salted" by unscrupulous persons and
palmed off as a rich ore-producer upon
a speculative Frenchman, on whose
complicated adventures the plot hinges.
Alcazar.
"The Strange Adventures of Miss
Brown" will be the new bill at the Al
cazar, where at very popular prices it
should make a successful week, as it
has been played here but once before,
and that time with Eddie Foy in the
titulary part and at the Baldwin. For
those who may have forgotten this is
a sketch of the theme: A young Eng
lish officer weds a "ward in chancery"
and to rescue her from a private school
in which she is confined, disguises him
self as a young woman. In the school
he has no end of comic adventure.
There is a strong bit of subsidiary
character in a German music teacher
who is In love with the school girl.
Titfoli.
The Tivoli's new piece, "Slnbad the
Sailor," which was produced last night,
is reviewed in another part of thia
paper.
Morosco's.
The prologue of "Pavements of
Paris," which will be the next attrac
tion at Morosco's, opens with a scene
in the province of Lorraine, at the foot
of the Alps, during the period of the
Franco-Prussian war. The wife of Jean
Le Franc is the missing heiress to the
titles and estates of a noble family.
Their union has been blessed with a
daughter. Little Marie, about whosa
subsequent adventures much of the in
terest of the plot centers. The closing
scene of the prologue, in which occur
the murder of General Peronne, the
supposed death of Jean, and the abÂ«
duction of Marie occur, has been util
ized for the introduction of a histori
cal war tableau. It will show the op
posing armies confronting each other
upon fortified heights, during the heat
of the bloody battle of Forbach. An
other important new scene will be a re
production of a view of the city of
Paris by moonlight, fourteen years
later. The moonlight flooding the
stately buildings falls upon the placid
waters of the Seine. The famous Pont
Neuf, or New Bridge, spans the river.
The "Tomb of the Rabbits," a low Par
isian groggery. where the thieves and
gamins of Paris congregate for their
nightly revels, affords a meeting place
for the villain and his tool. Little
Mary, now grown to comely girlhood,
is a fugitive f-om the persecutions of
a procuress. Che crosses the bridge,
is seen by her enemies, pursued and
thrown into the river. Her father,
who has served through the war, and
returned to Paris to pursue the voca
tion of a hackman, hears her cries for
help. He is at the foot of the bridge,
filling his water bucket, and rushes to
the rescue, forming the final tableau
with Maria's dripping body in his arms.
Mr. Mainhall's part is that of the Vl
compte de Flashon. a chevalier d'indus
trie and all-around rogue, whose re
deeming traits and droll characteris
tics rob his unscrupulous actions of
much of their repulsiveness. La Petite
Lund has been cast for little Mary
and will introduce specialties, and the
rest of the company will be prominent-
I ly represented.
Orpheum.
An entire new bill is announced at
the Orpheum this wpek, when Hyde's
comedians take the boards in place of
the present string of talent. The Hyde
show opens with to-night's perform
ance. The Hyde combination is said
to be the strongest of all the road vau
deville shows, and several acts have
been specially engaged for the coast
tour. At the head of the list is Helena
Mora, the famous female barytone, who
will appear in descriptive songs and
ballads. She will introduce one written
specially for her, entitled "For Old
Glory," which will be produced with
scenic effects. Mclntyre and Heath,
the black face comedians, have an
amusing skit, entitled "Two Georgia
Minstrels," in which the experiences
and hardships of the stranded actor
are presented. An entirely different
line of black face work is that by Wil
liams and Walker, colored boys, who
will present the idiosyncrasies of the
flash coon and his sweetheart. Thia
team scored the phenomenal run of
thirty-two weeks at Koster & Bial's.
In their act they will introduce "Lord
Barnie," the famed black mascot of the
Chicago baseball game; they are as
sisted In the cake-walk by two creole
girls.
Charles R. Sweet, known as the piano
tramp, will appear in specialties, and
Thome and Carlton will present a skit
entitled "The Substitute Husband."
The great Lafayette, who has attained
fame as an imitator of John Philip
Sousa. will appear in a turn of fantas
tic mimicry. Among other features of
the bill is Ajax, known as the flexible
marble.
Ghutes.
The animals, their intrepid trainers,
Chlquita and several new people in the
free theater will make the Chutes an
attractive place this week.
Olvjmpia.
Mandola, the clever equilibrist, who
has been the especial hit at the Or
pheum this week, will be one of several
new turns at the Olympia.
JYlusic.
At Thursday's symphony concert in
the Tivoli Mr. Seheel's orchestra will
play Schubert's C major symphony,
the Parisian Bacchanale from "Tann
hauser" and a symphonic poem by Ur
ban, entitled "The Ratcatcher."
The first of a series of concerts to be
given here by the world famous Knei
sel quartet will take place at Sherman.

THE CAPTAIN'S ADVENTURE.
DID I ever have any -adventures
in China?" repeated the old sea
captain, stretching himself com
fortably in hi? chair. "Well, yes,
a few. I r-m.-mber a pretty tick
lish one which happ-ned in '64. when
I was down on the H<>ung-ho River at
Shanghai.
"You must know that in China the
small river craft corresponding to our
rowb>>ats are called sampans. These
boats are long, narrow affairs with just
room for a passenger undi'r the hood
at one end. while opposite sits the
Chin^sA sculler.
"Well, on the nieht of which I speak,
my ship, the Dolphin, was lying "ft.
Tung Ka'lon, which was the third or
French portion of thÂ»- river. I was
making ready for sea, but had been
kept very late in the custom-house that
night gntting my bill of lading. But
everything was ready aboard ship, for
she had been well provisioned and a
Chinese crew pngaged. All the officers
\v(-rÂ«", of course, Americans. I had no
passengers, but was carrying a cargo
of tea and silk to Fuchau.
"At about 11 p. m. I finished my busi
ness at the custom-house, and then
walked down the bund, or beach, to the
French concession. Here, as I had
discharged my own private boatman,
I looked about for any sampan near by
to carry me out to my ship. I en
paered one and set off.
"The night was pitchy dark with a
drizzling rain and the only light we
had was that furnished by a small lan
tern hanging up behind me in the hood
of the sampan. As we went up stream
I noticed that my boatman kept up a
guttural conversation with other pass
ing sampan men. but thought nothing
of it at the time.
THE BOYS NEXT SUNDAY,
Xext Sunday morning the page of selected stories written by the
boys of the coast, in competition with the girls, will be published. The
girk' page will appear one week later. Two days remain for mailing
stories intended lor the pages. No selection will be made, therefore, un
til after Tuesday next. During the past week the boys have done well,
and the competition will not be one-sided. The boys will be represented
by six 'â¢torics. which will be illustrated. More stories will be used if there
is sufficient space. The girls will have the same amount of space as the
boys. The judges have not all responded to the invitations sent out to
them, but acceptances are coming in. The full list will be published at
the proper time. At the time of this writing nine judges have signified
pleasure at being able to serve fhe boys and girls. There will be fifteen in
all, and every judge will be prominently connected with education on
the Pacific Coast. Thoy are all accustomed to reading the compositions
of boys and girls and to pas_ing upon their merits. They will represent
many communities and much education and good judgmen . The list of
judges will be satisfactory and so will the stories. Watch for the Boys'
Page next Sunday. Then see the Girls' Page the succeeding Sunday. The
two pages will exemplify the story-telling ability of our young people.

"The mate ordered John to tow me
back to my ship at once.
"< >n my arrival I ordered the cap
tured sampan to be hau!<-d aboard and
placed in full sight on top of the pilot
house. All the next day hundreds of
boatmen rowed past to view it, but
none came to claim it; and as there
was no mark upon it I had no means of
finding out to whom the boat belonged.
But early next morning, since I could
wait no longer, I set sail for Fuchau,
and took the sampan along, thinking I
would keep it for my own private use.
I also carried a special sampan man
with me.
"Now, as the river in this section
was so shallow. I had to stop at the
Pagoda anchorage, eighty miles below

could lay their hands, both natives and
foreigners.
"When I arrived at the Pagoda an

the new man up the river until I
reached Fuchau. On landing I told him
to wait there for me, but on my return
was not greatly surprised to find both
him and the sampan missing. I re
ported the case to the American Consul,
who sent out a Chinese detective. Two
hours later the detective returned and
reported that my man had gone across
the river to Fookein, which was full of
lawless boatmen, and. being a stranger,
they had killed him and cut off his head
and kept the sampan. So that was the
end of my adventure."
UNCLE BILLY AND
LITTLE SUNSHINE
BY MABEL E. THOMPSON.
Uncle Billy was an old man. He
lived in San Francisco. He was very
silent, and people called him cross; but
he had a soft spot in his heart. One
night, as he was walking home, think
ing: of his little granddaughter, Nellie,
who was dead, he saw a little girl
who was sobbi r.Er. "I want mamma;
bad man take Millie."
He soothed her and took her home
with him. The next day he told the
police about her. They tried to find her
parents, but oould not. U-ele Billy
loved Sunshine, as he called her, and
was glÂ£M to keep her. Years passed by,
and no one came to claim her.
A lady once heard her sing, and per
suaded Uncle Billy to give Sunny sing
ing iessons. Sunny had a gold locket
on her neck when Uncle Billy found
her, and he often showed it to her and
talked about it.
One day, when they were at the park
looking at the swans, Sunny said: "Un
cle Billy, I seem to remember a pretty
place with swans like this." Sunny
became a beautiful girl and a very
sweet singer. Every one loved her, for
she was always kind.
One Saturday Uncle Billy came home
â while Sunny was away and got every
thing ready for an early lunch, so they
could go to the park.
Just as he had finished there was a
rap at the door, and, opening it, he saw
a pretty lady and a gentleman.
As they came forward, the lady
asked: "Are you Uncle Billy, and have
you a little girl named Mildred?"
"I have," said Uncle Billy, "but what
do you know of her?"
"I will tell "you," said the gentleman.
"My name Is Perry and fifteen years
ago to-day we had a little girl born
whom we named Mildred. She grew
to be a pretty child. TVhen she was
about two years old I discharged a
man who was dishonest. He threat
ened to be revenged.
"One day, when Millie and her nurse
were out walking, the nurse stopped
to talk with some friends and Millie
wandered on. She was f-pt\ no more.
"Two weeks ago we received a let
ter from this man, saying that he was
Aery sick and wanted t'> see us. "We
went to him at once and he told us
that he stole Millie and took her to
San Francisco and saw you take her
home. He found out your name and
told us where to go.
"Now. Uncle T-silly, you see we are
her parents. Have you the locket that
was on her neck?"
"Yes." said Uncle Billy, "and I must
lose my Sunshine."
AN EASTER MORNING SONG.
Within a California bower
Of roÂ«*s stood a matron sweet.
Around her, in a fragrant shower.
Fell the rare rose leaves at her feet.
"Dear God," she said, 'â from out of the clear
Blue sky we ask Thy sign of love
This Easter day, thy children hear
The pinions of the Heavenly Dove
Which in far old Tudea descended
And Jesus in i.ie wave attended."'
Hark! Children's voices, faint and fine
Sang a glad Easter morn refrain.
'Dear Lord," they sang, *'the world is thine.
Earth praises thee with flowers and grain.
Far spread the landscape â hill and dale.
Mountains with orange groves beneath,
Whose blossoms sweetened every galeâ"
Earth's fairest, richest, bridal wreath!
"God," said the matron. "God above
In these sweet children pledges love."
"Oh, no," said Mrs. Perry. "We will
take you home with us."
Just then Millie came in. "Well,
Funny," said Uncle Billy, "this is your
birthday. These are your parents."
With a cry of joy Millie sprang to
them.
They took Millie and Uncle Billy
home with them to Chicago. Uncle
Billy loved Millie's little brother and
spent his time with him.
Millie was always called "Uncle
Billy's Sunshine." She now saw the
swan she so instinctively remembered
and was very happy with those she
loved.
THE SUN AND MOON.
BY JUDITH GUSLEAN.
The sun and the moon had a fight,
It was a comical sight.
The moon fought the best,
And the sun sank to rest
In the radiant west.
And it sulkily slept all the night.
BEANSTALK JACK'S VOYAGE.
JACK O1O 1 THE BEANSTALK sat
talking with his mother one even
ing by the fireside, when two queer
happenings made Jack open his
eyes wide. The harp that he stole
from the Giant began to talk: the hen
that lays eggs of solid gold began to
lay, and at such a rate that the floor
was soon covered with gold.
"Jack o' the Beanstalk," said the
harp, "do not sit here idly and selfishly.
There are those in trouble who need
your help. Having told you this, I will
ask you to pick up the golden eggs and
place them in a leather raddle-bag.
Rise before the sun to-morrow morning.
When you hear the first crowing in the
barnyard go out and mount a horse
which you will lind standing by the
door. Do not take the reins, but go
â where the horse wills, and be brave and
true. So will you do good."
"Do not go, Jack," said his mother.
"I am old, and need you at home."
"No, mother, do not stop me," said
Jack. "Good fortune has come to us
by daring. Let us not be selfish."
The next morni.g. early. Jack awoke,
kisseu' his mother good-by, took her
blessing and rode off upon the horse he
found in waiting. Once he turned in his
saddle to look back. His mother stood
by her cottage door, waving her hand
kerchief in fond adieu.
What a wonderful horse that was
that Jack had! Jack minded what the
harp had said, and never touched the
bridle once. He had no need to urge
his beast. He raced up hills and down
hills; swam broad and brawling riv.-rs
with ease, galloped through mountain
dt-files and over deserts, and never
tired. This went on for three days,
the horse never pausing, by day or by
Jack luckily had enough provisions
to last him. He was a perfect horse
man and could sleep in his saddle. He
was dozing when a strange noise
roused him. Looking ahead he saw
an ocean. Toward this the horse was
galloping. Before Jack had a chance
to think much the horse had galloped
boldly into the surf. A great billow,
topped with salt foam, took the horse
away from the shore, which soon be
came a dim, dark line far behind.
Bold as Jack was he was really
alarmed. Around him, on all sides,
were only huge, roaring waves the
spray from which kept him constantly
drenched. The wonderful horse found
no difficulty in swimming through and
over the highest waves. Often he raised

used to it that he slept in his saddle
as easily as when the horse had carried
him over solid land. And now Jack
BOW smoke <>n the horizon. A few hours
later he drew near enough to see that
th<* smoke came from a volcano, which,
like a wonderful torch, seemed to tower
up to the very sky with its flaming
On and on! And now the horse was
on a beach strewn with jagped stones,
and now he had floundered alon^ to a
place above the reach of the waves â
and there his wonderful strength left
him and he lay down and died. But
before his valiant life C parted or his
unconquerable will failed, he spoke
those words to Jack:
"This, dear Jack, is the dreadful home
of the brother of that Giant whom you
saw and, whose land you visited by
means of the wonderful beanstalk.
That Giant being dead, his brother has
brought to this island the farmer who
bought your mother's cow; and here,
also, his family are held as prisoners.
"The reason is that the Giant knew
that the beans which the farmer gave
you enabled you to reach him and to
take away his hen and his harp. This
he told his brother. The brother can
not be hurt by fire; nor by water. You
must find some way to reach the sum
mit of the volcano. I cannot tell you
how. When I am dead take off my
iron shoes. These are charms to help
you. They are filled with magic. They
alone enabled me to travel so far and
to swim so far."
The next instant the horse was dead
and Jack was alone. He took off the
horse's shoes and carefully saved every
nail. He dug a trench by the shore
and buried the horse and, on the board
placed the words, "A brave and faith.
ful friend." Then he pushed on until
he came near the .foot of the volcano.
That was a dangerous place; for the
red hot stones that were thrown from
the volcano rattled on the ground all
about him. He received many a wound,
but struggled onward and upward un
til he found some little shelter in a
grove of iron-wood trees. There, bleed-
Ing and bruised, he rested.
High above him the volcano roared
and the ground shook terribly under
his feet. From the earth came groan
ings and rumblings, as if the wrath of
the volcano would tear up the land and
throw it far out into the waves. Once,
looking upward, Jack fancied that he
saw the Giant gazing ferociously at
him. Jack was much puzzled. How
should he get up on the mountain and
what should he do there? For adown
its scarred sides flowed wide rivers of
red hot lava and the air was filled with
scorching and choking ashes.
Jack's lot seemed sad. He knew, af
ter thinking a little, that he would
never be able to climb to the top
of the volcano without help. Any mo
ment a river of molten lava might flow
toward the grove of iron-wood trees
and drive him from his present shelter.
He fondled the horseshoes taken from
his brave charger's feet. As he did
this a thrill passed through him. His
courage rose.
One of the horseshoes fell to the
ground. Instantly, by the magio with
in, it was turned into a shield of steel.
Seeing this. Jack placed the other shoes
upon the ground. Two of them were
changed into great wheels. One turned
into the body of a chariot. The wheels
and chariot body fastened themselves
THE BABY'S GOOD-NIGHT.
BY CHARLES A. KEELER.
Little eyes close in the dim evening- light;
Wave your hand, little maiden, good-night, good-night.
Wave your hand to the doggie â he's wagging his tail,
And wave to the muley cow down in the dale.
Hark! Hark! She is ringing good-night with her bell;
Now wave to the kitties a sweet farewell.
The birds in the branches above are asleep,
And see the stars shine through the night's distant deep.
Now, little one, wavte a good-night to the moon,
For the owl is singing his sad, sleepy tune.
together. But what was to draw this
chariot? Jack counted the horseshoe
nails out, one by one.
Some turned into double-edged
Bwords and lances and Jack saw that
the lances were to be used with the
shield and that the" swords were to be
fastened to his chariot wheels. Jack
perfected his chariot with these swords,
took up his shield of steel and tried
the points of the lances, which were
sharp as needles, and so strong that
they could not be bent.
So far Jack was satisfied with the
help given him by the magic of the
hm-seshoes, but still the question was
how to get to the top of the volcano,
which was raging more fiercely every
minute.
Suddenly Jack stamped one foot and
laughed outright. In one of his
pockets he had found one bean, just
such a one as the wonderful beanstalk
had sprouted from. He lost not a
second, but planted this bean, hoping
that it would bring him good luck. In
stantly it sprouted. In an hour the
vine was ten feet long, as large round
as Jack's thumb, and as strong as a
rope of steel. Without pause it began
to climb the mountain. Jack took the
hint: fastened the chariot to the vine;
buckled on his shield; took up the
strongest and sharpest lance; and
stepped into the chariot.
His hope was not disappointed. The
beanstalk climbed steadily and rapid
ly. AVonderful to say it did not turn
aside for the streams of lava, but leap
ed over them. Jack stood upright upon
Uie chariot, with eyes bravely turned
toward the mountain top. Passing
through volleys of red hot stones,
breathing the fumes of sulphur and
lava, scorched, bruised, bleeding and
half blinded, but never for one moment
thinking of turning back, up went Jack,
drawn by this wonderful beanstalk.
How was this?
The supposed farmer who first gave
Jack the magic beans was a magician,
although Jack had never guessed it.
This v ,s the country of which the
magic beanstalk as a native. When
Jack bcr.t over to pick up the horse
shoe nails, he, without knowing it,
picked up a magic bean. The beanstalk
w;is sure to grow toward the Giant.
So it happened, after his rough ride
up the steep luountain side, Jack found
himself, in his chariot, ju-. a the full
moon rose above the ocean, on a small
shelf around the volcano's blazing cra
ter. In the crater was this awful
Giant's home. There he h.-d his forge
and made strange shapes of iron â long
swords and spears with jagged edges;
horrible images of men and unknown
beasts, that came, fiery red, from his
worksho-- strange trumpets, through
which the Giant made the most dread
ful sounds; and braeen cymbals, the
noise of which, when they were clashed
together, was like thunder or the roar
and din of a great battle where many
cannons are fired.
Jack shuddered as he looked into the
seemingly bottomless crater and its un
dying fires. He had no time to spend
idly, >for the Giant saw him and, with
one bound, was out of the crater, blaz
ing: in his red-hot armor likeafiery star,
for, it will be recalled, neither fire nor
water could har. him. Upon his head
was a red-hot helmet In his hands
were huge rods of red-hot iron, from
which âks darted in streams as if
the rods were beaten by ham lers In a
smithy. His anger was terrible toÂ»
"\t last!" he screamed, in a -voice
that shook the f(UI \ d ' T "' a n, la mm t ake you
you 'n my power and I * H - mm * ke hp y _Â° r 1 }
help me toil in the volcano s Sen heart
forever and forever!" .
"Not so fast. Mr. Giant,' said Jack
"you have to catch a hare before you
can cook it!" _ Â . , f
"Villain, you escaped my brother, Dut
you shall not escape me!"
The Giant laid about him with the
iron rods as he strode rapidly toward
Jack. One blow would have crushed
Jack lifeless. The magic in the Dean
stalk had gone into the chariot arm
now Jack rode around and around tne
edge of the crater, the sharp swords on
the chariot wheels flashing blood red
in the glare of the volcano's light ana
threatening destruction to anything m
striking distance.
The Giant raced after him, but could
not quite catch Jack.
"Ho! Ho!" laughed Jack, "first catctt
your hare."
But Jack's laughter did not last long.
One nf the chariot wheels struck
against a bank of lava and Jack was
thrown out. Striding close behind, the
Giant had the brave boy in his grasp
in an Instant.
High the Giant held Jack above the
burning crater; loudly he shouted with
fierce glee.
"A warm bath you'll have to-night.
Jack! See how the volcano Is hungry
for you!"
But in his moment of seeming tri-
umph the magic chariot, making the
round of the crater's fiery run, hurried
with lightning-like speed toward the
Giant. He tried to escape, but could
not. He saw that he would soon ba
under the wheels and their cruel
swords unless he could beat the chariot.
Jack's weight was but as a feather to
him. But when he found that tha
chariot gained upon him the Giant
stood a moment, looking like an im
mense statue, and the glare of the vol
cano threw his shadow far over tha
ocean.
"Good-by, Jack," he Bhouted, and
then, with a cruel and mocking laugh,
threw Jack into the awful crater.
At that very instant the chariot
struck the monster, and the wheels cut
him into mincemeat with their two
edged swords.
Jack fell far into the crater. From
his saddle-bag dropped the golden egga
that he had brought from his home. A
fiery monster leaped from the flames
and seized the eggs.
"Gold! Gold!" he fairly shrieked
with glee. Seeing the gold, he forgot
to feed the volcano's fires, and the
Giant's magic having died with him. the
flames went out. Whatever the eggs
bounded against in their fall turned
into gold. So the fiery monster forgot
all about everything but gold and Jack.
The whole crater was solid gold now.
The monster reached out his hands and
caught Jack, so that the lad was not
hurt.
But the quick-witted boy took an egg
and handed it to the monster, who
taking it, immediately turned into a
statue of gold. Jack, now climbed up
the crater, making stepping places in
the gold with his knife. He reached
home after many days and found the
hen dead that lay the golden eggs; but
he did not mind that. He told his
mother of his adventure, and he is to
this day the King of the Island of the
Pure Gold Crater, and his mother is tha
Queen. D. H. W.

SENSIBLE FLOWERS.
BY VERA CHISHOLM.
In an open meadow
Down by the little lane,
Some flowers wish for sunshine.
Some flowers wish for rain.
"Ah." said a tall, fair lily,
"I'm dying now of thirst.
Oh, come to me, dear raindrop.
My heart will surely burst."
"I love to hear the raindrops,"
Said the red rose one day,
"But, oh, where is sweet summer!
She's gone so far away."
"Ha! ha!" laughed the blue violet,
"I am so very glad.
The gentle rain has come to mo,
Althouh it makes you sad!"
Then spoke the velvet pansy,
"The grass grows tall and green,
'Twill give us all some shelter
When winds are cold and keen."
They clapped their handsâ "You're right,
you're right !"'
They all cried out together;
"The winter gives us half our liteâ
The gentle rainy weather."CHARTER

CHAPTER 11.
Improvement of Streets.
SECTION 1. All streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts in the City and Coun
ty, now open or dedicated or which

to public use, thall be deemed and held
to be open public streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts, -for the purposes of
this Chapter; and tuo Supervisors are
hereby empowered to fix the width
and grade thereof, and to order to be
done therein and thereon any and all
street work and street improvement
under the proceedings hereinafter de
scribed.
Sec. 2. Application for the doing of
any such work or improvement must
in the first instance, except where
otherwise provided in this Article, be
made in writing to the Board of Pub
lic Works; and if the expense thereof
is to be assessed upon private property,
the Board shall investigate the same;
and if it determine that such improve
ment is expedient, it shall so report to
the Supervisors; and the Supervisors
shall not order any such improvement
until the same has been recommended
by said Board. When the construction
of any sewer or drain shall involve a
cost of more than five dollars per lineal
foot for any block, it shall not be au
thorized except by an on nance passed
by the affirmative vote of not less than
fourteen members of the Board of Su
pervisors. If an application is made
for any work or improvement of which
the expense is to be paid by the City
and County, and the Board of Public
Works shall not approv; of such appli
cation, it shall report to the Supervis
ors its reasons for such disapproval,
and the Supervisors may then, after
having obtained from the Board of
Public Works an estimate of the ex
pense of said work or improvement,
by ordinance passed by the affirmative
vote of not less than fourteen members
of the Board of Supervisors, order the
doing of said work, or the making of
said improvement.
The Board of Public Works may also,
except as herein prohibited, recommend
any improvement, the expense of which
is to be paid by the City and County,
though no application may have been
made therefor, and must make, with
said recommendation to the Supervis
ors, an estimate of the expense, and in
such case the Supervisors may order
the same done.
No street work or street improve
ments of any kind shall be ordered to
be done by the Supervisors unless a
written recommendation to do the
same has been made to them by the
Board of Public Works, and all sucfi
recommendations shall be made mat
ters of record in the office of said
Board.
When the Board shall recommend any
work to be done on a street intersec
tion or crossing, where the streets do
not intersect each other at right angles,
it shall in each such case determine
what lots in the blocks adjacent to such
intersection or cro: ;:ng will Le benefit
ed by said work, and shall cause a
map to be made on which shall be
delineated the lots sr> to fee benefited.
Such map shall be transmitted to the
Supervisors with said recommenda
tion.
Sec. 3. Before recommending to the
Supervisors the ordering of any work
or improvement, the expense of which,
or any part thereof, is to be assessed
upon private property, the Board of
Public Works shall pass a resolution of
its intention to recommend the same,
specifying the work to be recommend
ed, and shall fix a day when it shall
take final action upon said resolution.
Upon the passage thereof the Secre
tary of the Board shall forthwith, with
out any further authority, cause a copy
of said resolution to be posted conspic
uously for five days in the office of said
Secretary, and to be published for a
period of ten days (legal holidays ex
cepted) and cause a copy to be deposit
ed in the Post Office at the City and
County, with postage prepaid, address
ed to each person represented on the
Assessment Book of the City and
County for the next preceding fiscal
year as being owner of land liable to be
assessed for said improvement; but if
said lot stand on said book in the name
of unknown owners, such notice need
not be sent.
The Board shall also cause to be con
spicuously posted along the line of said
contemplated improvement, at points
not more than one hundred feet in dis
tance apart, notices, not less than
three in all, of the passage of said reso
lution. Each of said notices shall be
headed "Notice of Street Work" in let
ters of not less than two inches in
length, and shall in legible characters
state the fact of the passage of said
resolution, its date, and, briefly, the
work or improvement proposed, and re
fer to the resolution of intention for
further particulars.
Sec. 4. The owners of a majority of
the frontage of the proi rty fronting
on said proposed work or improvement,
and, in case of a district, hose owningmore than one-half of the superficial

objections to the same within ten days I
alter the expiration of the time of the j
publication of said resolution of inten
tion, which objections shall be delivered
to the Secretary of the Board of Public
Works, who shall endorse thereon the
date of its reception by him. Such ob
jections shall be a bar for six months
to any further proceedings in relation i
to the doing- of said work or making |
said improvement, unless the owners of
the one-half or more of the frontage or I
of the district, as aforesaid, shall j
meanwhile petition for the same to be |
lone, and the same shall, after the ex- !
piration of said six months, be contin- ]
ued under the resolution of intention
first passed if said Board shall deem
proper. If, however, the owners of at i
least two-thirds of the property front- j
ing on said proposed work or improve
ment, and, in the case of a district,
those owning at least two-thirds of the
superlicial area of the district, shall
make written objections to the
tame within said six months, no fur
:her proceedings shall be taken under
v .he aforesaid resolution of intention.
When the work or improvement pro
posed to be done is the construction of j
sewers, manholes, culverts or cess- |
pools, and the objections thereto are j
signed by the owners of a maiority of |
the frontage or of the district as afore
laid, the Board shall, at Its next meet
ing, fix a time for hearing said objec
tions, not less than one week there
after. The Secretary shall thereupon
aotlfy the persons making such objec
tions, by depositing a notice thereof in
the Post Office at the City and County,
postage prepaid, and addressed to each
objector or his agent when he appears
for such objector. At the time speci
â¢ led the Board shall hear the objections
urged, and pass upon the same, and its
decision shall be final and conclusive; |
and if said objections are overruled the |
proceedings shall be continued as
though no objections had been made.
At any time before the making of
the assessment as hereinafter provid
ed, all owners of lots of land liable to
issessment therein, who, after the first
publication of the aforesaid resolution
of intention, may feel aggrieved, or
who may have objections to any pro
reedings in relation to the performance
of the work described in said resolu
tion, may file with the Secretary a pe
tition of remonstrance, wherein they
shall state In what respect they feel
Aggrieved, or the proceedings to which
they object. Such petition or remon
strance shall be passed upon by the
Board, and its decision thereon shall
oe final and conclusive.
Sec. 5. When the contemplated work
jr improvement in the opinion of the
Board of Public Works is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the
expense of such work or improvement
be made chargeable upon a district,
md said Board shall in Its res
ilutlon of intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
md to be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to j
De benefited by said work or improve- !
ment may be made by any Interested j
party, in writing, within ten days a/- j
ter the expiration of the time of pub
lication of the resolution of intention.
The Secretary of the Board shall lay
said objections before it and the Board
shall, at its next meeting, fix a time j
for hearing said objections not less i
than one week thereafter. The Secre
tary shall thereupon notify the persons !
making such objections by depositing |
i notice thereof in the Post Office at the
?ity*and County, postage prepaid, ad- |
Sressed to each objector. At the time
ipeeined the Board shall hear the ob
jections urged and pass upon the same,
and if said objections are overruled, its
decision shall be final and conclusive
is to the extent and boundaries of the
listrict.
If the objections are sustained, the
Board shall proceed to set out another j
listrict to the extent and boundaries j
if which objections may be made and ,
i hearing had thereon as above pro- |
.â¢ided; and so on in like manner until j
a. district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob
jections shall be overruled by the Board
âits decision in that behalf to be final !
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro- |
ceedings shall continue the same as if j
no objections had been made. In its j
report to the Supervisors the Board j
shall accompany its report with a dia- i
gram on which shall be delineated each j
separate lot, piece or parcel of land, j
'.he area in square feet of each of such
lots, pjeces or parcels of land, and the
relative location of the same to thÂ« i
work or improvement proposed to be
done within the limits of the district.
Such diagram shall be certified to be
correct by the Secretary of the Board.

ment, verbal or written, with any per- |
son liable to be assessed for said work, |
or with any one on his behalf, to ac- j
cept a price from him less than the
price named in said contract, or to
make any rebate or deduction to him
from such price. Any such agreement
shall be deemed a fraud upon all per
sons liable to be assessed for such !
work other than the property owners !
who were parties to the agreement, and j

the work has been done, and showing
the relative location of each distinct
lot to the work done, numbered to cor
respond with the numbers in the as
sessment, and showing the number of
front feet assessed for said work. A
mistake in the name of the owner shall
not invalidate any assessment.
When the expense of such work falls
in part upon any person, company or
corporation having railroad tracks
upon the street where such work has
been done, said assessment shall in
clude an assessment against said per
son, company or corporation, for its
legal proportion of said expense, and
the same shall constitute a lien upon

ARTICLE XIL
I ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It Is hereby declared to be the pur
: pose and intention of the people of the
i City and County that its public utilities
'] shall be gradually acquired and ulti
i mately owned by the City and County.
I To this end it Is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
i the date upon which this Charter shall
! go into effect, and at least every two
! years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
I been fully attained, the Supervisors
; must procure through the City Engi-
n eer plans and estimates of the actual
i cost of the original construction and
! completion by the City and County of
i water works, gas works, electric light
I works, steam, water or electric power
' works, telephone lines, street railroads
' and such other public utilities as tha
Supervisors or the people by petition to
I the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
i cost of the construction and completion
I of water works by the City and County,
j the Supervisors must procure and place
! on file plans and estimates of the cost
|of obtaining from all of the several
; available sources a sufficient and per
1 manent supply of good, pure water for
i the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
lubllc utility, and requesting the
3oard to prepare for submission to the
lectors of the City and County, aa
ereinafter provided, a proposition for
ie acquisition of such utility, it shall
>c the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The ClerU
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast in favor of fcothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing' in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore- |
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its j
determination to acquire the same as
provided in section six of this Article
und from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same In the manner herein
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid

ting propositions to the electors for.
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exce,ed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether suc.h bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two- thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
In section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven. of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.

the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four

have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the Incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated coat of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City

DAINTY ACCESSORIES OF DRESS.
The various neck arrangements are i
made of chiffon, lace, Liberty silk, mull
and nÂ«ns of different meshes. Collar
ettes are made adjustable, c*nd convert
the evening open-neck bodice into a
high-necked waist for daylight wear.
Many of them extend far nut on the
shoulders, with a square effect across
the front and bark, the whole being :
f<\zod with several net or chiffon ruf
n>s made quite full. For shirt-waists,
the short how ij..,! under the chin is
made of plain or figured silks, and has
much the appearance ><f a short Wind
sor tie. Mull scarfs having a plaiting
of the same across the ends go around
the neck in stock fashion, and tie in
a huge, soft bow under the chin.
Veils make or mar a face, and must
be selected with a view to becoming
ness. The single-thread mesh is inva
riably bÂ«'cnminEr, besides being less try
ing to the eyes. If dots are too close
and large they will throw shadows on
the face, but if scattered widely, have
n becoming effect. The very latest
wrir.kle In veils is the Empire scarf.
It comes two and one-half yards long,
and is meant to be fastened about the
brim of the hat, crossed at the back j
and brought around and knitted on the ;
left shoulder. They are usually of dot
ted r.et in black, white or white with
black dots, and are edged top and bot
tom with very narrow black ribbon vel
vet. Across the ends of the scarf is a
plaiting or frilling of fine lace about
a finger wide.
