HIS MOTHER LIVES.
"Weighty Reasons Concerning Pos

Her Crown.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The Mall and
Express prints the following special
cable from London: Apparently well
founded reports of gTave importance
with regard to Queen Victoria have
reached me The death of the Queen
of Denmark following so closely on the
assassination of the Empress of Aus
tria had a very depressing effect upon
her Majesty. The fact that it was
thought necessary to take more rigor
ous precautions against possible an
archist plots, as cabled to you two
weeks ago, has also greatly distressed
her. The effect has been cumulative.
The result of all this, so my infor
mation Is, was that the Queen sent for
the Prince of Wales and again told him
of her desire to yield the throne to him.
She is said to have recounted all the
reasons which urged her to this step
with great force.
His Highness, however, was not con
vinced. In the first place, he assured
his mother that he took as much pride
In the great length of her reign as any
other of her subjects, and that all his
wishes were against ascending the
throne during his mother's lifetime.
Secondly, and what was of far ereater
Importance, he pointed out to the
Queen the serious state of affairs in
France and the possibilities that the
Fashoda incident might at any time
cause a break in that country's rela
tions with England.
For Great Britain to change rulers
now, especially when it is known the
Queen's intense desire for peace has
been one of the strongest factors in
avoiding hostilities on more than one
occflJ^an in rÂ»Â«ent v*"ars. might . bring
i/u-war with" France which would other
wise be avoided. Reluctantly the
Queen yielded for a time. She Is still
said to be seriously contemplating a re
newal of the argument.
Yesterday's and to-day's develop
ments in Paris, however, add such
strength to the Prince's position that
it is probable Queen Victoria will give
up her plan.

OH THE REPORT
OF MARCHAND
Great Britain, France
a^d Fashoda.
SITUATION VERY GRAVE
ENGLISHMEN WTLÂ±j NEVER
ABANDOxf THEIR CLAIMS,
On the Other Hand the Paris Press Is
Shouting for an Alliance
With the Abys
siniaiis.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by the Associated Press.
U >NDON, Oct. 15. â The week opened
with an ominous rattling of sabers over
Fashoda and ended with the rumblings
of a revolutionary volcano in Paris.
The situation arising out of the ques
tion between Great Britain and Fiance
as to the right of occupation of Fash
oda is extremely grave. Everything
hinges on the nature of the report of
Major Marvhand, the French com
mander at Fashoda, which is on its
way from Khartoum to Paris.
The evacuation of Fashoda by the
French must, however, take place if
war between Great Britain and France
'is i<j be averted, as the Marquis of
Salisbury has nailed his colors to the
mast and cannot recede from the posi
tion he has taken up, and in which he
received the unanimous support of the
country.
The Speaker, the organ of the Liberal
party, refers plainly this week tv vie
; impossibility of relinquishing the Brit
ish claims, and points out that if it
cornea to war it Will not be merely for
; Fashoda, but for the maintenance of
Great Britain's place in the world, plus
her undoubted rights. The Speaker
adds: "It" we abandoned our claims
! Englishmen would not only lose the re
j spect of others, but would lose their
< own self-respect, and English states
i manship would be dragged in the mire."
These emphatic declarations of the
English press and public men have al
ready had a certain influence across
the channel, and the inspired state
ments of the French press belittle the
â  importance of Fashoda and shift the
! ground to an undefined claim upon the
j province of Bahr-El-Ghazal and a port
i on the Nile.
The mouthpiece of the French For
eign Office is preparing France for the
abandonment of i.J?a"sliQdsr..ijy,rtS.oertins
that Major Marchand overshot his goal
and that instead of going to Fashoda
he ought to have stopped at the con*
fluence of the Bahr-El-Ghazal. Many
British publicists," however, scout 'the
idea that France will be permitted to
install herself on the Bahr-El-Ghazal,
which is described as the "paying reef"
of the Soudan. All the rest of the re
conquered territory, as far as Fashoda,
is comparatively valueless, being
mostly desert ground, which cannot be
made to pay for many years to come.
But the Bahr-El-Ghazal territory is
thickly populated and has magnificent
trade prospects. During the Governor
ship of the late General Gordon, Bahr-
El-Ghazal had Immense exports of
ivory, grain, beeswax, skins, etc., while
it contained whole forests of arrow
root. Besides the cotton grown there
surpasses the Egyptian product.
The Chauvinist Paris papers are de
nouncing Great Britain and doing their
utmost to excite French feeling in the
matter. Other French papers are
making bitter complaints against Rus
sia's Inactivity.
The Gaulois declares the time has ar
rived for Russia to repay ,the service
which France lent her in the Far East
by helping France against Great Brlt
i am, while the Patrie, after declaring
i they had been betrayed by the
! Brisson Cabinet, demands the cfespatch
! of an Embassador to King Menelik of
â¢ Abyssinia "for the purpose of seeking
an alliance with his 300,000 valiant,
faithful warriors, who will co-operate
with us in the event of hostilities at
Fashoda."
The moderate thinking section of the
French press in earnestly urging a
peaceful arrangement of the affair.
These papers candid^' aumit that
France is no match for Great Britain
in the event of war.
There has been a great deal of talk
about the possibility of war wiih
France and various preparations upon
the part of the British are reported to
have been made. For instance, It is
announced that a leading small arms
firm at Birmingham was asked this
I week whether it was prepared to turn
out a thousand magazine rifles weekly.
The significance of this will be appre
ciated when it is pointed out that the
British Government works alone are
capable of turning out four thousand
i magazine rifles weekly.
It is Rlso rumored that war insur
i ances have been affected at Lloyd's
, during the last few days, but they ap
; pear to have been more in the charac
ter of bets than trading.
Commenting en the Paris negotia
tions the Speaker says: "It is clear
there will be no abatement of the
American minimum demands. President
McKinley's speeches, indeed, indicate
that those demands are likely to be
come more rather than lesa extensive.
His reference to new responsibilities
and his deprecation of the charge of
militarism can only refer to the Philip
pine Islands, where alone responsibill
i tics of a new order await the American
i nation, and the President's speeches in
dicate the Intention of assuming them
: fully."
Andrew Carnegie has written a letter
to the Spectator protesting against its
statement that the late Thomas F.
Eayard had the honorable distinction,
"rare among American politicians," of
dying a poor man. Mr. Carnegie classes
this remark as bitterly unjust, and he
points out that Mr. Bayard was well
to-do when compared with the major
ity of the Presidents of the republic.
He adds: "The reason why the most
ambitious public men do not seek
wealth is that it Â»8 fatal before a nomi
nating convention. No candidate for
the Presidency would be thought of
who had a large income. There is no
record of honest poverty among the
prominent politicians of any country
I comparable with that of the great re-
I public." _______________

SPAIN MAKES
DESPERATE
STRUGGLES
Trying to Get Rid of
Cuban Debt.
ALSO WANTS PHILIPPINES
BUT UNCLE SAM WILL RETAIN
FRUITS OF VICTORY.
From Now On the American Commis
sion Will Prevent Haggling
and Be Most Per
emptory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Spain is making a desperate
struggle to retain the Philippines and
obtain the assumption of the Cuban
debt by the United States in exchange
for Cuba. While no advices have yet
been received from Chairman Day re
garding the work of the Peace Commis
sion at its sessions yesterday, it is the
understanding of the department offi
cials the subject of the disposition,
control and government of the Philip
pines was under consideration, but
from the fact that Mr. Day had not ad
vised the department of the work done
it is only too evident that no agree
ment was reached either with respect
to those islands or as to the independ
ence of Cuba and the cession of Porto
Rico and Guam to the United States.
There 1b reason to believe from now
on that the tone of the American com
mission will be more peremptory In
character, it being the intention of the
officials not to permit the Spanish
Commissioners to haggle and procras
tinate as they have been doing.
I was informed to-day by a high of
ficial of the administration that the
Spanish Commissioners are making
every effort to secure the assumption
of the Cuban debt by the American
Government in exchange for the island,
or its guarantee in some v.ay when the
Island is given its independence.
"The truth of the matter is," said an
official, "that Spam wants us to buy
Cuba. After conquering her she wants
the fruits of the victory. She will not
get them. The Cuban debt will not be
assumed by this Government in any
way, and Spain has been told so."
What is true of the Cuban debt is
also true of the Philippine debt. In
the first place, Spain objects to the
cession of any territory in the Philip
pines to the United States, and she be
lieves that under the terms of the pro
tocol this Government should withdraw
upon the signing of the treaty of peace.
Such a proposition has not been con
sidered for a moment by the American
representatives, who have submitted
their demand for the cession of the isl
and of Luzon to the United States.
HOW MADRID VIEWS
THE PROCEEDINGS
MADRID, Oct. IB.â The semi-official
Correspondencia attaches much impor
tance to yesterday's meeting of the
peace commissions. It says it believes
that besides discussing the Cuban debt
and the evacuation of Cuba, the Phil
ippine question was under discussion,
which this paper claims to regard as
incredible, as "all unprejudiced people
must think that, after the signature of
the protocol, the rights and sovereignty
of Spain would be unquestioned."
Continuing, the Correspondencia
says: "The Americans are uncompro
mising and disposed to only yield on
points of unimportant detail. They
are not disposed to agree to arbitra
tion, while Spain is willing to accept
Russia or Germany. The public is
anxious, but we cannot Immediately re
assure It, the telegraph not being, un
der the present circumstances, the best
means of information."

don Bennett.
MANILA, Oct. 15.â A1l things here
are waiting upon the result of the
Paris conference. Agruinaldo and his
advisers continue quietly at Malolos,
although there has been some idle talk
among the Filipino soldiers about the
purpose of the insurgent leaders to at
tack Americans. American officials
know perfectly well that the rebels are
no more desirous of committing an
overt act than Major General Otis is to
precipitate trouble. If a clash comes
before the Peace Commission concludes
its labors it will be due to an indiscre
tion of some native leader opposed to
Aguinaldo's faction and defiant of the
Malolos government.
Luzon is filled with factions, each lit
tle leader fancying himself a great gen
eral and each deeirouÃ of impressing
the people with hia prowess. This Is
the danger of the situation here. Sev
eral days ago Provost Marshal Hughes
appointed Domingo Pacheco, a Span
iard, as administrator of the rich estate
of the leper hospital, a public institu
tion with a self-sustaining endowment.
The next day placards in Tagallo were
posted, calling upon Filipinos to arrest
Pacheco, fatten him, and when he had
grown fat he should be skinned and his
flesh fed to dogs. Pacheco's offense
was collecting rents for the support of
lepers. His life is safe, but this inci
dent shows the disposition of some of
the native party.
Aguinaldo's people are not respon
sible for this, for he controls only a
small faction. The sickness among
the American troops continues, but the
percentage of deaths is decreasing.
Most strenuous efforts are being made
to Improve the sanitary condition of
the city. Smallpox is now entirely un
der control. There were no new cases
this week. All five men in the pest
house will probably recover.
The First California has established
special sick quarters at Ermlta. where
even those men slierhtly ailing are
taken for treatment. Neither the Cali
fornia troops nor the Astor Battery
have any men alarmingly ill in those
quarters or the division hospital, al
though both organizations have large
sick lists. Daniel Pryibil of the Astor
Battery died of dysentery Wednesday.
Most of the Americans have concluded
that they are booked for an indefinite
stay and are making themselves as
comfortable as conditions permit.
Many officers have their wives here
and more have been sent for. The
great need at the present time is more
women nurses for the boys in the hos
pital. Women can give the sympathy
that many a homesick lad needs to
enable him to regain his strength. The
complaint of the irregularity of mails
from home continues. Americans not
unreasonably hold the opinion that the
Government should get mails here
more frequently and at regular in
tervals.
MENELIK HAS SCME
TROUBLE AT HOME
Revolt of Ras Mangascia Said to
Have Been Engineered by
the British.
PARIS, Oct. 15.â Advices from Djlboutil
say it is Delieved that the revolt of Ras
Mangascia, the most important of the
Abyssinian chiefs, was engineered by the
British.
King Menelik is sending 40,000 troops
commanded by Ras Makonnen, to put
down the insurrection, and as Ras Man
gascia has only 10,000 troops at his com
mand it is expected that the revolt will
ba easily quelled, despite British support.

Executive Officers Perish at Their

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FALMOUTH, Oct. 15.â From the best
evidence obtainable at St. Keverine. it
appears that the Mohegan, which went
ashore near the Lizard last nisht. foun
dered five minutes after she struck the
rocks. She was going at full speed;
she struck twice, stopped and rapidly
settled into the water. As the captain
and the executive officers of the steam
er went down with her, it has been Im
possible thus far to ascertain how she
got out of her course, as the Falmouta
light and the cjast were visible.
Out of the 161 persons on board. 45
escaped.
Up to a late hour to-night thirty
bodies have been washed ashore at dif
ferent points. A southerly wind is
now blowing, and it is expected that
the bodies of many more victims will
be recovered before to-morrow. An
inquest will be held on Monday.
The survivors, without exception,
speak in the highest terms of the devo
tion, heroism and coolness displayed by
the officers and crew of the ill-fated
steamer, and declare that all were in
stantly at their posts when it was
known that she had struck.
The perilous position of the ship waa
noticed on shore and a warning rocket
was sent up, but it was too late then
to avoid the catastrophe, which oc
curred so suddenly that there was not
sufficient time to get all the life-saving
apparatus out of the ship.
The terror of the scene was indes
cribable â men jumped overboard in an
agony of despair and the women pas
sengers huddled together and refused to
leave the deck. The officers remained
on the bridge to the last and many in
stances of sacrifices are recorded.
Members of the crew are known to
have stood by and watched the boats
launched and put off when it was ap
parent that these were the only means
by which their own lives could be saved.
A lifeboat with a load of forty pas
sengers on its way to the shore passed
many who were battling for their lives
in the water whom it was impossible to
save.
The villagers, headed by the vicar
and coast guard, stood on the shore and
cheered the boat. When the llfetjoat
entered the little cove the fisher n en
waded into the sea to help drag the little
boat upon the beach and tenderly car
ried the exhausted survivors to their
homes, which had been already pre
pared for their reception, and the vicar
attended the injured.
The lifeboat was again launched and
put out for the wreck, on its outward
journey picking up three survivors.
The trip to the wreck was fruitless so
far as taking any one from the vessel
was concerned, but on its way back to
the shore sixteen other survivors were
taken from the water. This was just
before daybreak.
Among the incidents recited is the
escape of the Pembertons. Pemberton
jumped into a lifeboat, his wife threw
him their two children, then she leaped
into the boat herself and thus the whole
family was saved.
The bodies of six persons, four males
and two females, have been picked up
and landed here.
VILLAGERS CARE FO*
RESCUED AND THE DFAD
ST. KEVERINE, Oct. 15.â 1n the
lower end of the church here lie fifteen
bodies, among them those of four wo
men and one twelve-year-old girl. The
bodies are laid out reverently. The
faces of the victims present a sad
sight, showing how rudely the waves
and rocks played with their features.
The whole village and neighborhood
are alive with excitement, and knots of
men linger about, talking with the
rescued members of the crew.
It is exceedingly difficult to trace the
events of the disaster, but so far as can
be ascertained, it seems that the
weather was not thick, but that a
strong southeast wind was blowing and
there was a heavy ground swell on and
a strong current running. Dinner was
ready and Captain Griffiths was about
to proceed to the saloon when a sudden
crash made it apparent that the steam
er had gone ashore. The captain imme
diately went on deck, and the survivors
say they saw him on the bridge doing
all that lay in the power of a brave
man to lessen the disaster.
Authentic particulars of the event.,
occurring after the ship struck are not
yet obtainable. It seems, however, th-**"
one of the ship's boats, containing sev
eral women, got away safely, but was
capsized. A number of its occupants
were rescued by Mfeboats. Another
boat with sixteen hands was picked up
by a lifeboat and safely got ashore,
and two or three other persons man
aged to reach land.
The rescued persons are receiving the
greatest attention from the Inhabitants,
and the utmost kindness is being shown
to the female passengers.
PASSENGERS DINING
WHEN STEAMER STRUCK
FALMOUTH. Oct. 15.â One of the
passengers rescued by the Port Hou
stock lifeboat says that all the pas
sengers were dining when the catas
trophe occurred, although some of the
children and those who were sick were
In their bunks. Suddenly the Mohe
gan struck with a grating noise. At
first the engineers thought this wag
caused by coal falling down in the
bunkers, but a second shock followed
and the vessel began to settle.
A coast guardsman, who was on duty
at Coveract, says he noticed the Mohe
gan was pursuing a dangerous course.
William Moore, a seaman of the Mo2
hegan, belonging to London, was
among the men who succeeded in
reaching Port Houstock He said the
vessel struck forward on the star
board bow and sank head first, her
stern rising right up in the air. Moore
sprang overboard, and after swimming
for a .considerable time succeeded in
reaching an empty lifeboat belonging
to the steamer He got into the boat
and started to row for the shore. Some
time afterward he saw one of his ship
mates named Hilson on a raft. Hilson
was exhausted and Moore dragged him
into the lifeboat. Hilson's shoulder waa
5 injured. The sea was then run
ning heavily and the lifeboat was
ly full of water and. after scraping
on two or three rocks, she was smashed
to pieces. Moore and Hilson were
washed ashore.

GALLANT RESCUES
BY LIFE-SAVFRS
FALMOT'TfI, Oct. 15.â A dispatch
from St. Keverlne, a small town a little
to the eastward of the Manacles, said
eighteen bodies from the Mohegan have
been washed ashore there. They have
been deposited in the parish church.
A member of the Port Houstock life
boat crew, named James, gave a
graphic account of the wreck. He says
that as soon as the disaster was an- \
nounc-i-d his crt\v was summoned to the I
boat and proceeded to the Manacles.
They could see no lights, the night was
pitch dark, and no rocks were discern
ible, but they heard shouting and Dull- j
ed toward the spot from which the i
voices came. No steamer was visible, j
but the lifeboat came across an over- j
turned lifeboat to which four or five !
men were clinging.. They were taken on I
board the lifeboat. Later the crew j
heard shouting near the overturned
lifeboat, and with grapnells man
aged to right it. Inside the boat j
they found a â  oman and two or three j
men alive. The woman was so tightly
jammed in the wreckage that the life
boat men had to cut away the thwarts
of the small boat before they could ex- |
tricate her.
James said the lifeboat passed sev
eral bodies of men and women and
picked up a couple of men who were
11". it ing on wreckage.
The lifeboat then met a ship's boat
having on board twenty-two passen
gers and crew, all of whom would have
been speedily lost if not rescued at that
time, as the boat was water-logged and
ramdly drifting toward the rocks. The
occupants of this boat were taken into
the lifeboat. While the latter was
tig homeward she picked up Miss
of Baltimore.
"She la the pluckiest lady I ever saw
in my life," said James. "She snouted,
'Don't shove me an oar; give me a
rope.' The sea then swept her toward
us and we caught her hands and got
her safely on board in as good state as
could be expected. We then had forty
eight persons in the boat, including the
crew, and could hear shouting from the
steamer. We approached her and saw
Steward Gray clinging to the jigger
mast. We then saw that all four masts
were still standing and the survivors
â¢ clinging to them. We backed in
right over the wreck and succeeded in
rescuing the boatswain, cook and oth
ers. Xext we rescued an engineer who
whs 'li;igin,T to the steamer's funnel.
All this occupied several hours. We
th r -n made for the shore."
rther advices from St. Keverine
say the panic on the Mohegan was ter
and the cries of despair were
heard on shore.
One passenger cut away the falls of
a lifeboat with a razor and thus saved
Beveral lives.
Miss RondenuiÂ»h and her mother. Mrs.
Grandin, entered a ship's boat, which

J;? mined between this boat and a life
boat. One of the lifeboat's crew, at
great personal risk, jumped on board
the steamer's boat after the latter had
righted and pulled Mrs. Grandin from
her dangerous position. But she was
landed in a dying condition, and all
the efforts to revive her were use

later she anxloflfcly inquired for her
mother, whose body was identified by

feet was torn from the leg.
MOHEGAN TOTALLY
UNSAFE FOR SERVICE
LONDON, Oct. : .15. â ' Harrowing
scenes were witnessed to-day at the
London' office of the Atlantic Transport
Company, to which the wrecked
steamer Mohegan belonged. .A number
of women fainted there/when the ex
tent of the calamity became known,
and there was a constant ' ' stream of
telegraph boys running to and from
the office seeking for information or
taking- messages to anxious ' Inquirers.
The Mohegan, It is now - said, has
been an. ill-fated vessel from the start.
It is added that she was only bought
by the Transport Company \vhen their
own vessels had been delivered : to the
United States Government during the

ness line and only made one voyage
out and home. This, it is asserted, was
most unsatisfactory, and friends of the
crew say her engines were defective
and that her boilers leaked. She is fur
ther acknowledged to have arrived at
Xew York in such a condition that
she was sent home empty, and her re
turn voyage took several weeks, during
which she drifted a whole day and
night, owing to the trouble with her
engines.
For the past two weeks the steamer
has been in dock undergoing repairs,
but the managers say she was in per
fect condition when she left port on
this her first voyage under her new
name. It is asserted,, however, that in
a twenty-four hour trial last week
her performances were very unsatis

go on her on account of the previous
defect in her engines. It is surmised
here that the engines broke down and
that the vessel, In the rough sea and
heavy gale which prevailed, drifted on

ficer was Mr. Couch, her second officer

GEORGE MAULE'S
STORY OF THE WRECK
FALMOUTH, Oct. 15.â One of the
survivors, Mr. George Maule of Ne*v
York, was interviewed after he had suf
ficienty recovered to be able to tell the
story of the wreck. He said:
"I am a shipper of horses employed
by the American Transport Company.
We left London on Thursday and all
went well until 7 o'clock yesterday
evening, when most of the passengers
were at dinner. The steamer was go
ing at full speed, when suddenly we
heard a loud crash, which seemed to
denote that we had collided with some
other vessel. But when we rushed on
deck we found that the Mohegan was
on the rocks between the Manacles and
the Lowlands, in the vicinity of the
Lizard.
"Orders were given immediately to
lower the boats and the crew of the
steamer behaved like heroes. Her cap
tain stood on the bridge and the great
est order prevailed among the officers
and crew.
"The steamer, however, immediately
began to settle by the head. Two boats
were launched. The women were sent
away in the first boat. But whether
these reached land or not I do not
know.
"I managed to secure a life belt and
jumped overboard in company with the
chief officer of the Mohegan, Mr. Couch.
He made me take off my coat and shoes.
Soon after that we were parted from
each other. When I was leaving: the
vessel a little girl begged piteously that
I try to save her as she did not want to
die yet. I was powerless to help her.
"Evenually I caught hold of a plank
which was floating on the water and
1 clung to it for seven and a half hours.
At the expiration of that time I was
picked up by a tug. I could not have
lasted much longer.
"I cannot explain how the accident
occurred. The whole matter is not very
clear to me."
OFFICERS AND CREW
NUMBERED NINETY-SIX
LONDON, Oct. 15.â The pfflcers and
crew of the Mohegan numbered
ninety-six, and of these thirty-three
are known to have been saved.
The body of A. Baxter, one of the
passengers, has been recovered.
Among those who are still missing
are Mrs. S. C. Crane, believed to be the
wife of Stephen Crane, the novelist.
Miss Rondebush is the American oper
atic singer, professionally known as
Maud Rounds. She telegraphed to a
relative In London to-day saying:
"Shipwrecked. Mother dead."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. 10 (By steam
ship Farallon to Port Townsend, Oct.
16). â Every southbound boat is either
crowded or well filled with incoming
! Klondikers, and despite the rush back
to the States the steamboats have re
duced the fare to Puget Sound less
than one-half.
Among the latest arrivals is Alex
| ander McDonald, "King of the Klon
| dike." He is visiting old friends over
lat Douglas Island (Treadwell gold
; mines). McDonald arrived at Juneau
, about two years ago with only $3 50 in
| his pocket from Aspinwall, whore he
I had been a miner and mine owner
! about twelve years. He worked there
â  in silver mines and the depreciation in
\ the price of silver took away his for
tune. Then he decided to try mining
in Alaska. McDonald was so poor at
that time that he was compelled to
ask the consideration of Messrs. Olds
and Orton, proprietors of a hotel here,
and they being old miners readily
granted it. He went to work for wages
in the Treadwell mines. For several
months he had savnl considerable
money and left for the Yukon Valley.
That was the beginning of McDonald's
fortune. He got to the Klondike short
ly after the first locations were made.
At the time he was mining a claim
on Miller Creek, near Forty Mile. He
threw down his pick and left the cabin
on Miller Creek as it stood, though the
ground was paying wages. It was his
knowledge of mining and his confidence
in himself which brought his success
as a miner and as ..n operator on the
Klondike. He owns more claims than
any other man in Dawson, and only
one or two poor ones. There is quite
a difference between the Alexander Mc-
Donald who arrived at Juneau and
Treadwell two years ago and the Alex
ander McDonald who is now shaking
hands with old and less fortunate
friends, fnr to-day his fortune is esti
mated at 'close to |5,000,0U0, and ail in
gold, and In about the safest bank in
the worldâ the earth. He is modest
and unassuming, quiet and unobtru
sive. He still looks like ninety-nine
out of 100 prospectors. McDonald was
born in Antigonish County, Nova Sco
tia, in November, 1864. He is going to
London, England, with his confidential
man and partner in some .of the claims,
Ronald Morrison. The steamer from
Dawson could not get up the river
farther than Kink Rapids, and McDon.
aid and others had to pole up tne river
from that point to Lake Bennett in a
small boat. He expects to go East by
way of San Francisco.
Slush ice is creating trouble on the
Yukon and Lewis rivers. The small
steamers are now afraid to attempt the
trip, as they cannot tell what day they
may be frozen. The slush ice freezes
to the .sides of the hulk, making navi
gation very slow and laborious. This
ice accumulates to such an extent that
It must be broken away with picks and
axes. As many of these boats as can
will winter at Lake Bennett, in order
to take their choice of runs between
Dawson and the new diggings at Lake
Atlin, according as the crowd goes
next spring.
Bill Gates, otherwise "Swiftwater
Bill," is said to be on the river bound
There are reports of rich strikes
of gold on the Stewart and Pelly rivers,
but as yet they are unconfirmed here.
The situation with reference to claims
at the new Atlin Lake diggings is be
coming more complicated. A large
number of locations have been jumped
and the stakes removed or changed. It
seems that the renulrement of the Brit
ish Columbia law that two weeks' work
must be put in on each claim before the
closed season begun, .September 15, was
not complied with in very many in
stances. This left the way open for
others to jump the '-cations, do the
two weeks' work and place themselves
In a position to legally record them
when the season reopens June 1 next.
This complication will retard what lit
tle winter work may be possible to get
things in shape for spring sluicing.
There are uncorroborated reports of
new strikes. Nothing further has been
heard from the caravan of horses and
men which left Lake Teslin for Lake
I Atlin a few weeks ago. The recorder
says that the Atlin City townsite will
[ be a Government reservation, and that
town lots and municipal privileges for
public accommodation will be leased.

ing Mrs. Francois Plgon-Mrs. Magal
lan, nee Refffel of San Francisco, who
failed to secure a divorce here, sailed on

Francisco.
The steamer Pilgrim, bound from
I Skaguay to Juneau, went ashore in a
storm last Friday on the Heward City
reef, near where the Clara Nevada was
lost last winter, and is reported to be a
total loss. No lives were lost.
The Farallon carries south to-night
! about eighty Klondikers, who, notwith
standing the slush ice and th<; heavily
j falling snow, succeeded, after consider

a total Klondike value of ten million
dollars. Mr. McDonald has with him
certified checks for $150,000, and one
hundred ounces of gold dust, worth at
Dawson, at a valuation of $16 an ounce,
nearly $20,000. No finer specimens of
nuggets or purer fine gold ever came
out of the Klondike. Mr. McDonald
takes this weight of gold with him

FUNERAL OF QUEEN
LOUISE OF DENMARK
Imperial Mourners Follow the Coffin
to the Chapel of
Frederics: V.
COPENHAGEN, Oct. 15.â The funeral
services over the remains of Queen
Louise of Denmark took place at 2 o'clock
this afternoon in the cathedral of
Roskilde. The King of Denmark, the Czar
of Russia, the Princess of Wales and all
the imperial and royal mourners arrived
there by special train at 1:45 p. m. They

with a distinguished company.
The King of Denmark, who was greatly
affected, followed the ooffln. Then came
the King of Greece, the Crown Prince of
Denmark, King Oscar of Sweden and
Norway and others In full uniform. The
contrasting colors of the uniforms formed
a striking picture.
All took seats in the church, with the
ladies of the party. At the conclusion of
the services the coffin was borne with the
same ceremony to the Chapel of Frederick
V. where the final rites were performed.
The mourners then returned to Bernstorff
Castle.
ADDITIONAL ARRESTS

What the Bombs Contained That
Were Intended to Destroy
Emperor William.
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Oct. 15.âSev
eral additional arrests have been made
In connection with the plot against Em
peror William, who is now on his way to
the Holy Land to be present at the con
secration of the Church of the Savior at
Jerusalem.
The explosive in the bombs was fulmin
ate of mercury. Another box of bombs
was found upon a table in the residence
of the cafekeeper who was arrested
Thursday morning. With the box were
two bottles of wine and a quantity of
provisions, as though they had been pre
pared for a traveler. They were prob
ably intended to be taken by one of the
copsplrators taken into custody, who had
engaged a place as a waiter in a hotel at
Jerusalem, and had secured passage on
a Kheviedeh liner sailing for Jaffa to
day.
NOT ON THE BALLOT.
Chicago Platform Democracy Shut
Out Through a Notary's Mistake.
ALBANY, N. V., Oct. 15.â The State
ticket of the Chicago platform of the De
mocracy will not go on the official ballot.
The certificate placing this independent
ticket in the field was received by the
Secretary of State at 11 o'clock last night,
and in examining it he found the urst
jurat of the notary public on the Uloter
County petition defective, and notified the
committee The error was not corrected
before the time for tiling expired at mid
night, so the Secretary of 3tate has ruied
that the whole certificate is defective and
its nominees cannot go on the official
ballot.
Seals Were Plentiful .
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 15.â The Victoria
arrived to-day with 1768 sealskins. Cap
tain Haan says seals were plentiful, es
pecially northwest of the islands. Three
other schooners with catches aggregat
ing 2700 are reported. The catch will be
better for the number of boats engaged
than last year.
THE MAGIC NUMBER.
"I often hear of the magic number,"
said some onÂ°. "What number is it?"
"Why, nine, of course," replied some
one else. "There are nine muses, you
know, and you talk of a nine-days'
wonder. Then you bowl at nine-pins,
and a cat has nine lives."
"Nonsense," broke in another. "Seven
is the magic number. Seventh heaven,
don't you know, and all that. Seven
colors in the rainbow; seven days in
the week; seventh son of a seventh son
â great fellow; and â "
"Tush, tush," remarked a third.
"Fives the number you mean. A man
has five fingers on his hand and five
toes on his foot and he has five senses;
and â "
"Three is undoubtedly the magic
number," interrupted another, "because
people give three cheerÃ, and Jonah was
inside a whale three days and three
nights, and if at first you don't suc
ceed, try, try again â thret times, you
see."
This was received with some con
tempt by the company and a Boulf ul
youth gushed out:
"Two, oh, two is the magic number.
One's self and one other. The adored
one. Just us two."
A hard-featured individual, w r ho had
been listening to the conversation hith
erto unmoved, here remarked in a harsh
voice:
"The magic number is number one in
this world, and if you want to succeed
never forget it."
An interval of deep thought on the
part of all followed, after which they
went in silently to supper.â Brooklyn

POSTOFFTCE ODDITIES.
There is something very touching in
the confidence of the public in the
powers and sagacity of the Postofflce
Department. A correspondent once ad
dressed a letter thus:
"To the gentleman who looked at a
house near Cleobury Mortimer a little
time ago, Bilston. Staffordshire."
Within fmir days of the arrival -or the
communication the department succeeded
in nnding the gentleman, and duly deliv
ered the letter.
The department, however, had to con
feÃÃ itself beaten by the request of an
old lady of Greenock, who wrote out a
telesrram to her home to say that she
should not be home till morning,
ami asked that the latchkey should be
sent together with the electric message.
Another disappointed applicant whs a
young man who entered the Northampton
postofflce and asked at the counter for a
marriage license, stating that he wished
to get married without any one knowing
It. It was a long time before he could be
persuaded that the sale of marriage li
censes belonged to another department of
the administration, and that hte postofflce
was powerless to help him.â London Ex

VIRDEN, 111., Oct. 15.â The Coroner's
jury had two sessions to-day at the
stockade, where it examined several
witnesses. They were ex-guards who
are under nominal arrest by the militia,
and for whom a blanket warrant was
sworn out yesterday, charging them
with conspiracy to murder in connec
tion with Wednesday's fight. The tes
timony was practically the same as
given by their companions Friday.
The general idea conveyed was that
while the men were employed to defend
the property of the Chicago- Virden Coal
Company they not only did not fire any
shots themselves, but they had no time
to see whether any of their comrades
fired upon the mob. This applied to
the guards stationed inside the grounds.
The members of the train escort either
declined tv answer on that point or
that they did not remember.

from the Chicago-Virden Coal Company

fifty-seven negro miners here, the coal
company to pay the expense. The tele

kept in St. Louis until protection for
them at Virden could be had, and that
they would then be taken there and put

PARIS. Oct. 15.â The anti-revision
papers regard the reported discovery of
a military plot against the Government
as being pure invention. The Figaro
says it is informed that the French
generals agree in declaring that their
duty Is to show absolute obedience to
the Government.
The Gaulois classed the affair as a
"conspiracy without conspirators." But,
in spite of this, the papers which an
i nounced the conspiracy insist upon the
i exactness of their information.
The Petite Republique Francaise
j points out that there has been no offi

The Aurore asserts that the Govern
i ment received warning of the plot from
different sources and posseses import -

According to the Petit Bleu, the gen

I Prince Victor, however, obliged them to
I turn in another direction. The Govern

a number of reports in regard to the
plot, one of them calling attention to
the absence of a certain commander of
an army corps from his headquarters.

cept in the case of troops on duty at
the railroad depots. The detachment
on duty at the Town Hall, near the La
bor Exchange, which has hitherto been
composed of a company of infantry and
two troops of cavalry, has been en
tirely withdrawn. In addition the sol
| diers are no longer confined to barracks
and are promenading tht streets as
freely as usual. - â¦ *
Outside of Paris the same state of af
fairs prevails. The troops have been
withdrawn from the railroad station at
Rouen, where all fear of trouble has
vanished.HAS WELLMAN

EVELYN BALDWIN'S LETTER
TELLS OF FINDING DESERTED
CAMP IN FRANZ JOSEF LAND.
Considerable Confidence Felt in Stock
holm That the Daring Explorer
Safely Landed With His
Balloon.
Sr^c'.al Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â A Chicago
special to the Herald says: Swedish
Journals which have just arrived from
Stockholm claim to have positive in
formation that Walter Wellman, the
American explorer, has found traces of
Andree in Franz Josef Land.
They assert without qualification that
Captain Ernst Andree, brother of the
polar aeronaut, has a letter from Eve
lyn Baldwin, second in command of the
Wellman expedition. The letter is
dated at Cape Tegethoff, August 7. Mr.
Baldwin is made to say that the mem
bers of the expedition landing at this
point ran upon a deserted camp evi
dently occupied only recently by Eu
ropeans. There were fresh footprints
In the snow, but no message or letter
had been left among the remnants of
the camp.
The last known vessel to have
touched this point was one of an Aus
trian expedition of twenty-five years
ago.
"The traces we found," so the Swed
ish journals say Mr. Baldwin wrote,
"could have been only a few weeks old.
We could not remain, but moved the
stores left at Cape Flora for Andree to
Cape Tegethoff, in case Andree and his
companions returned to this camping
ground. Andree may have been miles
in the interior or other expeditions may
have passed close to each other. We
remained as long as we could and then
Btarted north, leaving a message."
The confidence of the Stockholm pa
pers In the message that the tracks
might have been those of Andree and
his men is helped out by the claims of
sh scientists that this is about
where Andree ought to have been at
that time. Baron Nordenskjold said re
garding it:
"The traces found by the Wellman
lition are undoubtedly from An
dree and his companions. If th" bal
loon has crossed the poie it has landed
either on the American or Asiatic con
tinent. As to the message not having
received direct from Andree or
from other sources, during our Veja
journey from the 2Sth of September,
1878, until July IS, 1879, when we re
maineJ in winter quarters, It was not
until September 17, 1579, that we could I
communicate with the outside world." |
THE YOUNG BRIDES PARTY.
There is a young married couple on
one of the handsomest avenues of the
city. Late last winter they decided to
pay of! some of their social obligations
by giving an evening party. On the
night fixed for the event the house was
illuminated from basement to attic. The
refreshments provided would fill a box
car, the caterer was on hand with his
staff of assistants, and an air of eager
expectancy pervaded the entire estab
lishment.
At 8:30 the husband frowned at his
watch and denounced all people who
thought it smart to be late at a party.
At nine the nervous young wife was at
the front gate, looking both ways, dry
ing her eyes on a flimsy bit of lace and
showing unmistakable symptoms cf
hy6teria.
At 9:30 she. with pale face, steely eyes
and hard voice, was telling her husband
what good society she had before she
married, and how glad all her friends
were to attend any entertainment that
she might give. He replied by saying
that she might possibly recall how he
was always in demand in the most ex
clusive set, which never seemed to
think her membership necessary to its
existence. She bit her lips that the
servants might not hear the things she
would say, and he chewed the ends of
his mustache in impotent wrath. Sud
denly the white heat of her wrath over
came her when he said he had won
dered why none of his oldest and best
chums had never mentioned the party,
but now he understood. She hissed an
avowal that fhe would go to her girl
hood home and never see him again,
turning and rushing to her room as she
Kpoke. A piercing shriek filled the house
and he hurried to her. There she sat
upon the floor, in all her finery, point
ing to a pile of envelopes in her new
writing desk.
They were the invitations that had
never been sent! â Detroit Free Press.

KOZLDWSKI'S MOST
UNIQUE LAWSUIT
Action of the Priest Now
in Court.
DAMAGED BY ANNOUNCEMENT
THE READING OF THE LETTER
OF EXCOMMUNICATION.
Why the Leader in an Independent
Parish Claims Damages From.
the Roman Catholic
Church.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 15.â The second step
in the prosecution of one of the most
unique suits ever brought in an Amer
ican court, the suit for $50,000 damages
against the officials of the Roman
Catholic church for publishing the ma
jor rite of excommunication against a
former priest of their faith, Father An
thony Kozlowski of the All Saints' In
dependent Polish Catholic Church, has
been taken in the Circuit Court in the
filing of the declaration co-ntaining the
itemized complaint of the independent
prelate.
The document sets up in its opening
lines that the plaintiff of his own voli
tion formally severed all connection with
the Roman Catholic church on May 7,
1897, at which time the independent
parish of aII Saints was organized.
The specific charge against the Arch
bishop and Cardinal Ledcchowskl, who
were made defendants in the action, is
that, knowing their power to influence
the people over whom they had ecclesi
astical Jurisdiction, with intent to in
jure the plaintiff, they caused a letter
to be read in all the pulpits of the dio
cese forbidding all true members of the
Roman Catholic church from associa
tion in the slightest degree with the
plaintiff under nain of being them
selves placed under the ban of the
church.
Father Kozlowski asserts that
through this letter, which was read as
directed on July 3, 1898, he has been put
to great inconvenience and has suffered
financial loss through the lessening of
his receipts in parish collections and
has been prevented from making ad
vantageous commercial transactions
through the distrust engendered by the
publication of the letter.
In addition to his financial losses the
litigant priest declares that he has sus
tained great injuries through the dam
age to his reputation through the ac
tion of the Cardinal and the Arch
bishop. _____
WITS WHO DINED WITH BOORS.
One of the most interesting houses in
London is said to be on the point of con
version and reconstruction. It is the house
in the middle of the west side of Leicester
sciuare where Sir Joshua Reynolds lived
from 1760 to the day of his death. It had
previously been occupied by Henry Mor
land, the father of the faaious George
Morland and was bought by Sir Joshua
for Â£16&(5. He spent another Â£1500 in ad
ditions and alterations, signalized hia
house-warming by a ball, and set up a
magnificent chariot, richly carved and
gilded, to suit his new grandeur.
In the dining-room Sir Joshua constant
ly entertained all the best-known men of
hie time including Dr. Johnson, Gold
smith Garrlck, Burke, Sterne, Hogarth,
VVilkes Allan Ramsay, and a score of
others "who formed the brilliant Literary
Club of which the great painter was the
founder There, doubtless. In the familiar
lines of' the author of the "Retaliation"
"When they talked of their Raphaels,
Correggios, and stuff, he shifted his trum
pet and only took snuff."
At these dinner parties, according to
Malone, though the wine and the dishes
were of the beat, there seemed to be a
tacit agreement that mind should predom
inate over body. The table, we are told,
though set only for aeven or eight, often
had to accommodate double that number,
there was usually a deficiency of knives,
forks and glasses, and the guests had to
bawl for more supplies, while the host
calmly left every one to shift for him
self, though he lost not a word, if he
could help it, of the conversation.âLon

Accusations.
SPEAKS OF A CONSPIRACY
BOGUS LOVE MESSAGE SENT
FROM SAN RAFAEL.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 15.â "1 say right
here â and I wish my statements clearly
understood â this man Garnett is the
Facsimile of the Drawing Sent by Edgar Malcolm Garnett to
Walter Hobart.
victim of a foul conspiracy to railroad
him Into an insane asylum in order that
Captain Callundan of Harry Morse's
Detective Agency may make a few dol
lars. He was decoyed to San Rafael In
order that he might be arrested. We
have perfect proof of this, and if pro
ceedings are not quashed I will spring
some of the most sensational disclos
ures that ever surprised the public.
Mark my word, as soon as a conference
Is held Garnett will be released."
These were the words of Attorney R.
Porter Ashe to-day shortly before the
examination of Edgar Malcolm Gar
nett was held on the charge of Insanity
because he had written a number of love
letters to several society ladies. The
conference was held, and to the great
surprise of the large number of attor
neys, physicians, witnesses and others
/present Ashe's prophecy proved liter
ally true. Garnett was released on his
own recognizance.
Early this morntn<* Attorney Ashe
came to San Rafael in company with
Louts A. Garnett, the father of the man
accused of insanity, and an elder broth
er. They went immediately to the office
of Attorney James W. Cochrane, who
was retained to take charge of Ho
bart's side of the case with Attorney E.
J. McCutcheon, and a secret conference
was held.
Later Attorneys McCutcheon and
Hall McAllister, who was expected to
give important evidence; Captain Cal
lundan and Detective Cleary made
their appearance.
At 3 o'clock a room adjoining the Su
perior Court room at the Courthouse
was crowded with a large number of
the curious in anticipation of spicy pro
ceedings, as it was rumored that Attor
ney Ashe meant to fight the_case. Dr.
W. J. Wickman and Dr. W. H. Jones
were present to make the medical ex
amination.
Garnett was brought in and took his
seat by Ashe, quietly awaiting develop
ments. His father and brother paced
nervously up and down the corridors
and held several quiet discussions with
their friends.
Shortly after Ashe's sensational
charges a conference was held between
McCutcheon, Ashe and the District At
torney. Ashe spoke excitedly and
threatened to "put the newspapers on"
to something. The District Attorney
advised against this but finally an
agreement was reached and word was
sent to Dr. Wickman.
The physician then arose and stated
that no charges would be preferred
against Garne-tt, and accordingly noth
ing was to b.; done. Everybody was
surprised and walked out, eagerly
questioning the reason of the sudden
change. Garnett was released on hiÃ
own recognizance and left for home
with his relatives.
The reason given to the public for the
dismissal of proceedings was that Gar
nett's father and brother had promised
to place him in a private asylum.
Ashe refused to state his proofs, but
said it could be demonstrated that
Morse's men tired of waiting for Gar
nett to come to San Rafael and tele
phoned to him that a lady wished
to ,3ee him while he was at the home
of Jerome A. Lincoln. It is known that
Detective Cleary has waited around the
broad gauge depot for Garnett for over
a week. He denies that Garnett was
lured to San Rafael.
The lett rs sent to the ladies by the
alleged insane; man could not be seen.
The picture he sent to Walter Hobart,
in which Hobart was represented as
cutting his head off with a broadax,
was cleverly executed, and shows Gar
'nett in the ant of lifting a glass of li
quor to his lips while the head is fall
ing.

BERLIN, Oct. 15. â Emperor Wil
liam's departure for the Orient haa
started a discussion as to the advisa
bility of the establishment of a re
gency.
The Freislnnige Zeitung says:
"Where the Emperor and King of Prus
sia leaves the country for any length
of time, as in the present instance, a
duly empowered person ought in the
meanwhile to seize the reins of govern
ment." It urges that the matter be
brought before the Reichstag.
A number of the leading Liberal pa
pers support the regency proposition,
while several of the Conservative pa
pers scout this view. The constitution
of the empire does not appear to pro
vide for a regency. The presidency of
the German Bund is vested in the
King of Prussia, but nothing is said to
legalize the transfer of this dignity to
a regent of Prussia. In the mean
while the Emperor's brother, Prince
Henry, of Prussia, who would natural
ly be regent, is absent in China. The
next Prince available would be Prince
Frederick Leopold, son of the late
Prince Charles of Prussia, eldest
brother of Emperor William I, the
grandfather of the present Emperor.
The whole matter of the Emperor's trip
to the Holy Land will be threshed out
early during the coming session of the
Reichstag.
In Government circles the opinion is
expressed that it is not fair to expect
the Emperor to bear the entire expense
of the journey. It is said that the j
cost of his Majesty's trip, exclusive of j
presents and liberal baksheesh, will ;
amount to at least 5,000,000 marks. The \
costly gifts to the Sultan of Turkey
and to his harem, etc., also figure up
from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 marks. There
fore, it is suggested, as the voyage is
expected to redound to Germany's
greater glory and advantage, that Par
liament ought to grant a credit to cover
the main expenses, more especially so
as otherwise the Emperor will have to
run into debt.
The Conservatives have answered the
Government's approaches favorably,
but the Centralists have replied with
a fiat negative. The party organ, the
Cologne Yolks Zeitung, which does not
relish the outspokenly Protestant char
acter of the expedition, says: "It
would be asking too much to expect all
Germans to put their hands In their
pockets in order to pay the home and
foreign pastors, Protestant Bishops and
the like, the coÃt of their junketing in
the Orient."
The Berlin Neuste Nuchrichten
says: "If anybody can be expected to
pay for the trip it would be the Prus
sian Diet."
It is now said that Emperor William
intends to become a neighbor of Queen
Victoria in the Highlands of Scotland.
He has been inquiring for a purchasa
ble sporting estate in Scotland, provid
ing salmon fishing and grouse and deer
shooting.
In an interview on the subject of
Herr Moribe Busch's book on Prince
Bismarck, Dr. Schwetninger, the phy
sician of the deceased statesman, said:
"I voice the feelings of the Bismarck
family when I say they are indignant
at Herr Busch's book. It is not only
full of glaring errors and misrepresent
ations but it does grave injury to the
memory of Herr Busch's benefactor.
Besides, Herr Busch violated his sworn
duty in the capacity of the pensioned
ex-state official not to reveal state se
crets and not to publish state docu
ments. Moreover, his description of the
Fume's private habits ie utterly im
aginative."
The recall of Baron yon Bulov, the
German Minister at the Vatican, is
still greatly exercising the German
press. An official of the Foreign Of
fice said: "A successor to Yon Hulow
will not be appointed until we have re
ceived satisfactory assurances regard
ing the Vatican's attitude toward our
right to protect our own subjects in the
Orient. In this case, however, there is not
the slightest chance of a renewal of the
rr-pture nor the least intention of inter
fering with the hierarchy or to disci
pline the various holy orders, nor is
there any animosity whatever on our
part toward the Holy See."
The inadequate meat supply of Ger
many, owing to the barriers erected
against foreign cattle, hogs and meat,
continues. From Australia solely
some 8000 head of cattle have been ad
mitted, and Russia supplied about 80,
000 pigs. The imports are quite insuf
ficient to cope with the requirements
which the home supply fails to meet.
Prices have risen steadily for months
past, and they are now 20 per cent
above those of 1897. The slaughtering
of horses for food has greatly increased,
especially in the large cities, and dog ;
flesh is openly advertised.
In the Chemnitz Neuste Nachrichten
"fat young dogs" forms a standing ad
vertisement.
The Prussian Minister of Interior has
forbidden the Berlin municipal author
ities to renew the iron fence around
the graves of the victims of the March
rising of 1848. on the ground that such
a renewal will "redound to the glorifi
cation of revolution."
A brewing company af Eisenach has
decided to buy the famous Luther
house there and convert it into a res
taurant. The Government office is be
ing urged to prevent one of Germany's
most historical landmarks from being
put to such a use.
Influenza has again broken out in
Berlin and many fashionable people
are prostrated.
The Government has now definitely
decided to appoint permanently a naval
attache at Washington, who will reach
his post in January.

GRASS VAL T **v. Oct. 15.â A murder
horrible in its details was committed
at Mrs. Mitchell's ranch at Randolph
Flat, three miles west of here, late this
afternoon. Mark Casey and Robert
Hooper, employed on the ranch, had
been on a spree for several days. To
day they quarreled, and, according to
Mrs. Mitchell, Casey applied an epi
thet to Hooper which angered him.
Hooper went into the house and got
a Winchester rifle. The two met sub
sequently in the yard and, according
to a witness, Casey threatened to brain
Hooper with an ax. Hooper opened
fire. The first bullet is believed to have
been fatal, yet Hooper shot away at
his victim a half dozen times after
ward. Casey's head was partially
blown off.
Hooper made his escape and has not
yet been found by the officers. Both
men had violent tempers.
THE FRENCHMEN OF ASIA.
Persians struck me often as much re
sembling 1 Frenchmen in their love of
compliments and courtly phrases, and
by their mannerisms of talk and gesticu
lation; and when they waxed eloquent
about their feats of war and their prow
ess in the chase they would put the im
mortal Tartarian himself to the blush.
I fancy that Persians would, however,
be considerably astonished were they to
hear their language as spoken in the
France of the Orient. French taught by
Austrians to Persians must necessarily
undergo remarkable changes as regards
accent, and I met few Persians out of
Teheran who had the slightest respect for
gender. "11" was the only personal pro
noun used, and as .hey seemed to im
agine all adjectives need only be used in
the masculine, it was often most confus
ing to follow a conversation. I have had
to listen to long family histories in which
wives, sisters, brothers and a variety of
other relation? were all mixed up indis
criminately, the effort to understand who
was who leaving my brain in a perfect
whirl.â An English Lady in Persia.

CITIZENS OF TWO COUNTIES
HEAR THE NEXT GOVERNOR
FAR ECLIPSED THE
MAGUIRE RALLY
Stockton's Welcome to
Mr. Gage.
PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE
MIGHTY CHEERS GREET HIS
APPEARANCE.
The Republican Leader and Others
Prominent in the Party Address
an Immense Political
Gathering.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Oct. 15.â San Joaquin
County pledged fealty to Henry T.
Gage to-day with evidences so unmis
takabie as to make glad the hearts of
the friends of good government. Never
in a Presidential election has there been
sin h a demonstration of popular feel
ing. The first ripples were observa
ble early this morning, when farmers
from all over the county began to drive
in with their families and make prep
orations to stay for* the big meeting
to-night. They were not old Repub
lican wheel horses alone; old-line Dem
ocrats were equally anxious to see,
hear and cheer the Republican stand
ard bearer. Many hours before Mr.
Gage's train was due. Gage buttons
and badges were everywhere to be
seen.
On the 12:10 train came Senator
George C. Perkins, always popular in
this county. He was met at the train
by a reception committee composed of
leading- Republicans and old-time per
sonal friends. He was escorted to the
Imperial Hotel, which speedily became
the Mecca for his party and personal
friends. Senator Perkins came down
from the mining region, having left
Valley Springs in the morning. He was
enthusiastic over the outlook for Gage.
'â¢I had about 22,000 majority," said
he. "I'D give Gage 25,000. Wherever
Mr. Maguire has been he has made
votes for the Republican ticket."
A large reception committee, headed
by Judges Smith and Swinnerton and
ex-Congressman Louttit, went up the
Oakdale line to meet the Gage party,
and when the train arrived here at o :'â '>')
o'clock with the distinguished pariy a
crowd which was full of enthusiasm
added noise to the bombs and music.
The appearance of Mr. Gage on the
platform was a signal for prolonged
cheering. After handshaking, he was
escorted to the Imperial, where he met
Senator Perkins and many citizens.
For an hour he was unable to get to
his rooms, as citizens thronged the ho
tel office and insisted on declaring their
allegiance and tendering respects to
the next Governor. It was very evi
dent that he was a plain manâ a demo
crat in the literal sense of the word.
He enjoyed a few hours' rest, but at
nightfall, to use the language of the
small boy, "the trouble began."
Bonfires, music and an anvil chorus
created in the business part of town a
Fourth of* July din and glamour. By
7:89 Main and the intersecting business I
streets were so crowded that Superin- i
tendent LefTler of the street car lines
had to order a suspension of traffic on
the Main-street line until after the pa
rade should have passed.
Mr. Gage and Senator Pergins, in
carriages, accompanied by Chairman
Harkness of the County Committee and
leading citizens, left the hotel shortly
before 8 and were accorded an escort
to the pavilion Which was a credit to I
the enterprise of the Republican man
agers. First came a platoon of police,
followed by the Sixth Regiment Mili
tary band; then horsemen to the num
ber of 100, many from the country dis
tricts. Next came the Gage and Neff
Club, 400 strong, earn member carry
ing an American flag.
Bursting; bombs and cheers from the
densely thronged street greeted the
first portion of the procession, but when
the carriage ntaining Mr. Gage came
Into Fight there was wild enthusiasm.
The affair no mnrf resembled the re
ceptlon accorded Judge Maguire last
Monday evening than day resembles
night.
At the agricultural pavilion where the
meeting was held tho speakers' stand
had been moved to the north wing in
order to increase the acoustic proper
ties* The pavilion was decorated in the
national colors and prats had ber-n ar
ranged In such a systematic order that
the f i : s t 700 people to arrive did not
have any difficulty in finding seats and
2000 more found linprovlsed stats or
stood far out on the outskirts of the
mighty throng.
The following well-known citizens, in
cluding several Democrats, took their
places on the stage as vice presidents
of the meeting: N. B. Sperry. H. B.
Bishop, G. Alegretti, Tj. Musto, H. M.
Fanning, Ben F. Rolerson E. K. Pile.

T. E. Wilkinson, C. M. Keniston, W.
B. Ambrose, G. W. Buchenau, Ed
Hart, S. H. Boardman, B. S. Meyers.
The appearance of Senator Perkins
and Mr. Gage on th.c platform was a
signal for the mighty audience to rise
and cheer repeatedly. Dr. Harkness,
chairman of the county committee, in
troduced Judge Ansel Smith, who in a
brief address cautioned the people that
there must be quiet in order that the
human voice might reach the assem
bled thousands.
The Glee Club gave a lively campaign
ditty and the chairman Introduced "The
Hon. Henry T. Gage, the next Gover
nor of California." _
Then bedlam eacapea and seemed to
have lodged in the assemblage. As Mr.
Gage stepped forward the people arose
en masse, cheered and cheered, took up
the echo and again sent it ud to the
rafters till the very shingles on the dry
structure must have tingled in the vi
bration. For nearly two minutes Mr.
Gage stood bowing his appreciation
and unable to proceed.
. Mr. Gage began his speech after the
most exuding day's work of the ardu
ous campaign, yet his powers of on
durance were equal to the emergency.
His voice, too, had the penetrating
power of reaching, the people^ who stood
in the pavilion at points far removed
from the stage. He spoke for one hour
and held the close attention of his au
dience throughout. Here as elsewhere
his sincerity and straightforwardness
gained him the respect of the audience.
He reviewed the record of Maguire on
the railroad settlement and convinced
his hearers that the "Little Giant" was
"shouting railroad" to divert public no
tice Horn the odious single tax. The
Congressional Record was produced to
sustain the statements regarding Ma
guire's attitude in Congress. Applause
long continued told how effectively the
case was presented to the people by
the publican standard bearer.
On the subject of single tax Mr. Gage
presented the points in a concise and
comprehensive manner. The application
of the scheme to the miner as well as
the farmer was explained.
In closing his address Mr. Gage, in
the frank and manly style which conj
mends him to the people everywhere,
spoke of what he should do or not do if
elected Governor. The pledge of a
clean, honest, economical, businesslike
administration elicited from the audi
ence approving cheers. His own atti
tude toward the Southern Pacific cor
poration was mentioned, and the fact
reiterated that he had never been em
ployed as counsel by the corporation,
although his services had been fre
quently solicited.
The Stockton Republican Glee Club
entertained the audience with a song.
The chairman then presented United
States Senator George C. Perkins. His
introduction called out another round
of applause. The Senator paid a com
pliment to the public spirit of the cit
izens of Stockton, and proceeded to a
consideration of national topics. He
observed that the people of California
had a right to expect him to render an
account of his stewardship, and he was
ready to respond. Reference was made
to the industrial depression throughout
the land nineteen months ago, when
the Democratic parly surrendered con
trol of administrative affairs. The
present prosperous condition of the
country and, the prospects for a large
measure of prosperity engaged his at
tention. He predicted that California
would participate in the blessings of
the new era, and mentioned that
Stockton would be one of the cities to
derive benefits, as the erection of a
vast sugar factory to handle the beet
products of the San Joaquin Valley
was in contemplation. He estimated
that California had sugar-producing
capacity great enough to produce $50,
000,000 worth of sugar annually.
The gradual development up to the
present product of 36,000 tons was
cited.
Some plain and striking facts bear
ing on the railroad settlement were
submitted to the intelligent judgment
of the audience. . How Maguire can
"square" himself : remains to be seen.
Senator Perkins said that the chairman
of the Democratic national committee,
the chairman of the Populist national
committee and the vice chairman of
the Silver committee, all members of
the United States Senate, together with
Senators White, Morgan, Murphy and
others, gave unreserved support to the
amendment which Maguire is now as
sailing. -^ V..
The Senator embellished his admir
able address with stories to the point,
and kept the audience in a happy frame
of mind. The great audience adjourned
with mighty cheers for Gage and Neff.
Republicans are confident that their
ticket will triumph in San Joaquin
County. The success of to-night's
demonstration gives them renewed
zeal.
Hon. E. F. Preston has finished his
speaking tour of the Ran Joaquin Val
ley. Immediately on the arrival of the
train from Oakdale this afternoon he
started for his home. Henry T. Gage
will get a few hours' rest before start
ing on his trip to Angels Camp, San
Andreas and Jackson.
The tour of the San Joaquin Valley.
which culminated in the enthusiastic
and immense outpouring to-night in
Stockton, was remarkable throughout.
Never, were ' greater audiences assem
bled in California to hear political
questions discussed, and never were
Republicans of sound judgment more
confident of overwhelming success than
they are to-night.
METCALPS MAJORITY

BUISUN, Oct. 15.â Tt is generally con
ceded that Victor H. Metcalf. the Repub
lican nominee for Congress in the Third
District, will roll up a larger majority

pf-ntiment favoring a nominee's election.
He lias not only made a favorable Impres
sion personally, but his able and thought
ful Bpeeches have inspired confidence that
in Metcalf the constituency will have a
representative at once conscientious and
mindful of Its varied interest, especially
in the matter of river Improvements.
Mr. Metcalf was given a rousing recep
tion in Rio Vista this evening. He was
followed in his address by Frank B. Kelly
of San Francisco, who jn his advocacy of
Gage"s candidacy elicited hearyt cheers.
J. H. Gardiner presided and campaign

MR. GAGE'S TOUR
OF STANISLAUS
Meetings at Modesto
and Oakdale.
OUTPOURING OF THE MASSES
HE 18 MET BY A PROCESSION
ON A COUNTRY ROAD.
Demonstrations That Throw Into the
Shade Those Made in Welcome
of the jueader of the Con
fusionists.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Oct. 15. -The tour to
day of Gage and Preston through Stan
islaus County was a series of remark
able popular uprisings unsurpassed in
the history of California political cam
paigns. Here In the San Joaquin Val
ley, on the banks of the Stanislaus and
Tuolumne, the ovation in honor of
Henry T. Gage, the Republican stan
dard-bearer, excel In many features the
rallies south of Tehachapi, which
struck dismay to the fusion leaders.
Gage and Preston arose In Merced at
dawn this morning and boarded the
early northbound train for Modesto, the
county seat of Stanislaus County. A
delegation from Modesto met the
speakers and welcomed them to Stanis
laus County.
As early as 9 o'clock in the morning
people began to wend their way to the
hall, where the speaking was to begin
at 10 o'clock. Promptly at the latter
hour Mr. Gage and Mr. Preston went
to the platform. Their appearance was
greeted with intense applause. The
spacious hall, capable of holding 1000
people, was densely packed at this early
hour. The meeting was called to or
der by T. E. Brice, who introduced as
chairman C. K. Tillson.
Tremendous applause followed the in
troduction. When it subsided Mr. Gage
thanked the people of Modesto for the
reception and spoke of the remarkable
demonstration at that hour of the day.
He did not accept the ovation as one
for himself, but remarked that the ar
dor of the people was due to their de
votion to the principles of the party of
which he was a humble representa
tive.
As the time was limited, Mr. Gage
made but a short address. He spoke
of the great enthusiasm for the Repub
lican ticket as exemplified in the meet
ings throughout the San Joaquin Val
ley, in the counties of Kern, Tulare,
Kings, Madcra, Fresno and Merced. He
predicted for the Republican cause the
greatest triumph ever achieved In Cal
ifornia.
Hon. E. F. Preston received an enthu
siastic greeting from the cheering mul
titude. He spoke with earnest force,
invoking the admiration of his listen
ers for the courage of his expressions.
There was no juggling with words in
Mr. Preston's address. He denounced
the calumny that the Valley road had
joined the monopoly as a campaign lie.
Judge Maguire's promise, made when
he withdrew from the Democratic
party, to devote his life to the service
of single tax was taken v . Maguire's
career as a salary-retting agitator was
reviewed. Maguire's advocacy of the
Infamous single tax doctrine while
drawing the salary of a Congressman
was characterized as shameful.
Before the remarkable early hour as
semblage adjourned a delegation con
sisting of R. K. Thomas. A. S. Emery,
G. W. Dunlap and George McCabe ar
rived from Oakdale to escort Gage and
Preston in carriages across the beauti
ful country to that thriving town fif
teen miles distant. After a hasty
luncheon the line of carriages for Oak
dale was formed. The distance was
covered in one hour and a half. Rapid
movements were necessary in order to
give the people of Oakdale a chance to
see their next Governor and afford him
time to catch the train from Oakdale
to Stockton.
The ringing cheers of Modesto Re
publicans had hardly subsided when
the saluting shouts of the Oakdale pop
ulace began. Two miles from Oakdale
Mr. Gage and his escorts were wel
comed by a vast procession of men,
women and children from the town. A
column of mounted men, marshaled by
W. H. Rea and A. E. H. Meyer, headed
the long procession of vehicles. The
caravan made a great cloud of duet,
but a breeze from the north blew the
dust aside and disclosed to view the
column a half mile in length. Again the
bands played and the anvils sent forth
a welcome as the man of the people and
the standard-bearer of the Republican
hosts entered the town of Oakdale.
Without delay the procession, which
was ably managed, moved to the pa
vilion. When Gaee and Preston arrived
more than 1000 people had assembled to
hear them speak. The celebrated Mo
desto Glee Club made the trip across
country and delighted the Oakdale
audience.
The meeting was called to order by
George McCabe. who presented R. K.
Thomas as chairman. The following
named vice presidents were announced:
A. S. Emery, R. Thompson, J. M. Owen,
John Connor, Oakdale; C. D. Swan,
Montpelier; J. W. Allard, I. H. Watson
and H. R. Schell, Knights Ferry; L.
L. Dennett and A. A. Wood, Modesto.
Henry T. Gage was introduced by
Mr. Thomas; as a man of the plain peo
ple who had gained his way in life by
struggles with toil and poverty. As
Mr. Gage stepped forward, the tumults
of applause made the pavilion tremble.
The speech of the standard bearer was
brief, following the line of comment at
the Modesto dfmonstration. Colonel
Preston's speech also was short and
incisive. He aroused the multitude to
a high degree of enthusiasm with his
forcible and clear-cut style of calling
things by their right names. He spoke I
with watch in hand, in order to note
the time and not miss the train for
Stockton.
Gage and Preston were followed to '
the depot by many people. As the '
train moved out the cheers for Gage
and Neff were mighty.
At Farmington, in San Joaquln Coun
ty, where the Stockton committee
boarded the train to meet Mr. Gage, a
large crowd was assembled at the sta
tion. In response to the cheers Mr.
Gage went to the platform and ac
knowledged the compliment.
Pn ended an eventful day for the
courageous and dauntless Republicans
of Stanislaus County.

ATTITUDE OF THE POPULISTS
STRAIGHT-OUTS FEAR TO SUP
PORT REPUBLICANS.
Want the Assurance That the Elec
tion of a Republican Legislature
Will Not Be a Victory for
De Young.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. X.â Edward M.
Piercy, c-ne of the most prominent mid
dle-of-the-road Populists of the State
and weli-knovvn capitalist of this city,
has just returned from an extended trip
through the central part of the State,
during which he made it a point to
question voters of his faith in regard to
how they stood on State and legislative
tickets. The counties of San Mateo,
Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Benito, San
.Luis Obispo, Kings, Solano, Sonoma,
San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Alameda
were visited and from live to eight days
spent In each. Piercy says the middle
of-the-roadsters are solidly arrayed
against M. H. de Young for United
States Senator. Since the ruling has
been made that they are not to have a
place on the State ticket they have been
gradually going over to the Republican
legislative ticket. In fact the straight
Populists are about two to one for the
Republican legislative ticket, but they
must have an assurance that De Young
stands no chance for United States
Senator before election day. If the Re
publican State Committee Will give
them such a pledge they will vote al
most solidly for the legislative tickets
in their various counties.
The middle-of-the-roadsters denounce
De Young as a xaiiroad man and point
out that his paper, the Chronicle, has
always been on the side of the Southern
Pacific and other corporations. The
"director general" Is denounced as to
tally unfit, mentally and morally, for
the high position and is classed as a
blackmailer.
Piercy says he heard General Barnes
frequently mentioned as a good man for
United States Senator. The farmers do
not bear the same 111 will toward Barnes
that they do toward De Young, and
would be willing to accept him foT ,
United States Senator.
Piercy was a delegate to the Omaha j
national convention of the Populist
party and has been a delegate to all j
California State conventions of the;
Populists.
E. A. Hayes, president of the Good
Government League, will next week be

CAN CARRY THE
SIXTH DISTRICT
Why Republicans Are
Sure of Victory.
Russell J. Waters Makes a Canvass
Which Shows That the State
Ticket Is Bound to Be
Successful.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 15.â Russell J.
Waters, Republican nominee for Con
gress, has now completed his first can
vass of every county of the Sixth Con
gressional District, which includes the
counties of Santa Cruz, Monterey* San
Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura
and Los Angeles. Mr. Waters, in con
versation with a Call representative,
said:
"Judging from what I have seen and
heard I would say that Henry Gage
and the Republican State ticket will
carry every county in the Sixth Con
gressional District, save that of San
Luis Obispo, which will probably go
for Maguire by a majority of not over
200.
"Everywhere I find that there is a
pronounced sentiment among old-line
Democrats against the fusion arrange
ment. These Democrats feel as though
they could not support the so-called
triple alliance this year because they
want the Democratic party back in its
original position of standing upon its
own foundation without being com
pelled to carry as a handicap the Popu
list and Silver Republican parties.
"They claim that if the Silver Repub
licans and Populists believe as TRe
Democrats do in point of principle the
thing for them to do is to come over
into that party. If they do not believe
in the principles of the Democratic
party, then why should they desire to
fuse with the party and take half the
offices? This is the argument used by
the old-time Democrats against fusion.
They figure that they can best put an
end to fusion in the future, once and
for all, by defeating the fusion ticket
this year.
"To illustrate the great change that
has taken place in the politics of the
upper counties of the Sixth Congres
sional District I have merely to cite
Cambria Precinct, in San Luis Obispo
County. This precinct casts 201 votes.
The Republican Club there has a mem
bership on its roll of 166 signatures, and
43 of these 166 voted the Populist ticket
two years ago.
"At the meeting held at Hueneme,
In Ventura County, three of the vice
presidents were old-line Democrats
who had left their party on account of
fusion.
"Then, again, I found quite a sprink
ling of middle-of-the-road Populists
who intend to support the Republican
ticket this year in order to defeat fur
ther fusion of their party with the
Democrats, which policy, if continued,
will result in the total extinction of
their organization as a separate
entity."
Will A. Harris has accompanied Mr.
Waters on his Congressional campaign
tour, and he states that Mr. Barlow,
the Populist nominee, is going to be
defeated by 3000 votes at a minimum.
In Mr. Harris' judgment the only one of
the six counties in the district Barlow
has any prospect of carrying is San
Luis Obispo County. This is Mr. Bar
low's home, and he has a prospect of
carrying it.

ed to the uid pavilion by the local Dem
ocratic clubs. He addressed an assem
blage of probably 2500 people, the haJl
being crowded. D. W. Carmichasl w.ia
I chosen chairman.
Maguire declared the present cam- i
! puig-n to be a gigantic battle between
! Jeffersonian principl and monopoly. â 
i For years, he said, the followers of Jef-
I ferson and Lincoln had stood on com- j
mon ground ar- 1 this ground "equal
riehts to all, specitl privileges to none." I
! Of late, Marcus A. Hanna had arisen, i
' and the motto which he and his kind :
followed was, "A government of mo- j
nupoly, by monopoly and for monop- j
oly." He said he believed that the per- ]
P'-ttiit-<- of free institutions depended
upon the triumph of Jeffersonian prin
i ciples. The battle was on between the
i followers of. Jefferson and Lincoln and
I the followers of Hanna.
Considerable time was given to a dis
cussion of the silver question, which
Maguire characterized as a living issue,
I despite the fact that Gage, in his Los
I Angeles speech, had declared it dead. ;
The question he said, was not only ;
! alive, but would continue to be Intense- j
ly so until it was finally settled and the
constitution obeyed. He predicted that
it would be a paramount issue in 1900, |
and that William J. Bryan would be the j
standard bearer of the national reform ]
forces.
The last half of his address was given
Up to a scathing criticism of what he
said was an attempt on the part of the
railroad to manage the campaign in its
own interests. He insinuated that the
nominees <m the Republican ticket had
been placed there by the Southern Pa
cific Company. In support of this he
referred to the fact that the San Fran
cisco Call, prior to the meeting of the
Republican State convention, published
in full the ticket which was subse
quently nominated. He denied a claim
which he said The Call had made that
this ticket had been gathered by re
porters who had interviewed delegates
to the convention, saying that any re
porter having the ability to have ac
complished such a feat was capable of
filling the chair of the managing editor.
As further proof of his allegations
that the Southern Pacific had named
the ticket Maguire referred to the state
ments made in the San Francisco Bul
letin and the Los Angeles Times and
publicly declared by Morris M. Estee.
MAGUIBE AT GAXT.
Speaks at Length on the Funding
Bill Question.
GALT, Oct. 15 â The largest daylight
political meeting ever held in Gait was
addressed this afternoon by Hon. James
G. Maguire. The hall in which the meet
ing was held was packed to overflowing
and many persons were compelled to
stand outside. Maguire in the course
of his speech took occasion to highly
praise the work done by Congressman
Minion de Vries, candidate for re
election in this district. In speaking of
his own candidacy Maguire said that
his opponent had referred to him as
continually clearing out his throat on
account of hoarseness. Maguire ac
knowledged that he was a little hoarse,
but said that he had become that way
through doing his own talking, whereas
his opponent was wearing out the
throats of Southern Pacific attorneys.
He dwelt at length on the war and safd
there had been a disgraceful condition
of affairs in the soldiers' camps. If the
Republican party wanted to take unto
itself ail the glory of the war it should
also be willinp to bear the odium of this
disgrace. He spoke at considerable
length of the funding^bill and the do
mestic regulation of railroad freights
and fares.
Outdoor Meeting at lonÂ©.
IONE, Oct. 15.â Hon. James G. Ma
guire addressed an outdoor meeting of
several hundred people at this place
to-day. The meeting began at 10
o'clock this morning and Maguire spoke
but a half hour owing to the fact that
he had to drive 25 miles to Gait, where
he held a meeting this afternoon. He
touched upon the different issues of the
campaign generally, his limited time
not being sufficient to enable him to
enter into an extensive discussion of
the questions. Mr. Maguire was fol
lowed by E. L. Hutchison, candidate
for Lieutenant Governor, who is ac
companying him upon his campaign
tour.
NEFF ADDRESSES SAN
RAFAEL REPUBLICANS
I Candidate for Lieutenant Governor
Welcomea by an Enthusiastic
Multitude.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 15.â The Repub
lican campaign in Marin County was
opened to-night by a large and enthusi
astic meeting at the opera-house, which
was addressed by Hon. Jacob Neff. can
didate for Lieutenant Governor, Judge
Van Duser and Hon. D. E. McKinlay.
The party drove over from San Quentin.
where it had been Warden Hale's guest
during the day, and was received by a
committee composed of ex-Mayor Mc-
Carthy, Judge Pricer, W. C. Brown. S. P.
Olmsted and Robert Furlong. Preceded
by the San Rafael band the party drove
up Fourth street, which was illuminated
by bonfires, to the opera-house. The
I route was lined by a multitude of peo
| pie who rent the air with applause.
Rockets, Roman candles and Greek fire
turned night into day.
Mr. Neff was introduced by Chairman
i McCarthy. His remarks were brief and
:to the point. He said the Republican
j convention at Sacramento was in no wise
I controlled by the SoutHern Pacific, and
i that this charge had grown threadbare.
The party stood for good, pure prin-
I ciples, and in the end would surely
I triumph." Above all, he deprecated the
I charge that the Republican party was
| trying to gain prestige by claiming all the
! honor of the war with Spain. As for per
sonal assaults, he never made them, and
would refuse to notice any aimed at him
self.
Judge Van Duser spoke at length on the
evils of Maffuireism. He said that if, aa
I claimed, Maguire was the only man who
I could make Huntlngton sue for mercy he
ought to try to go back to Congress in
stead of wasting time as a mere Gover
nor.
McKinlay reviewed campaign issues
; generally.
All three speakers were roundly ap
i plauded. and the meeting broke up with
I three thunderous cheers for the party, the
I ticket and the platform.

Rea Is Losing Ground in
Santa Clara.
HIS TICKET IN DISFAVOR
GOOD GOVEBNMENT LEAGUE'S
SPLENDID FIGHT.
Enthusiastic Meetings Held in the
Agricultural and Horticultural
Districts of the
County.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. OctTTiF.â The Republican
Good Government League is making a
winning fight against the county ticket
nominated by the Rea convention. The
county has already been pretty well
canvassed, and much substantial en
couragement received. In the agricul
tural and horticultural districts the
people are opposed to Rea's interfer
ence in county affairs, and they will
give the Good Government ticket a
good majority. At the same time the
league is making a hard fight for Gage
and the legislative ticket.
Wherever meetings have been held
there has been good attendance and
great enthusiasm. The people now
realize that boss rule Is the cause of
increased taxation. Newcomers in
search of homes are driven from Santa
Clara County because of the corruption
in county affairs and the unenviable
political reputation the county bears.
There was an unusually large meet
ing at Morgan Hill on Thursday night.
The hall was not large enough to ac-
I commodate the people. This is in the
First Supervisorial District, where
"Boss" Rea is making a fight to re-elect
his brother to the Board of Supervisors.
An equally enthusiastic meeting was
held at Moreland on Tuesday night.
| These meetings serve to show how the
Good Government people are being re
ceived throughout the county.
The campaign against the gangsters
in this city will be opened on Monday
night by a joint mass meeting at the
Auditorium under the auspices of me
Republican Good Government League
and the Democratic County Central
Committee. The meeting will be called
together by E. A. Hayes, president of
the Good Government League, and J.
H. Henry, chairman of the Democratic
County Central Committee, will pre
side as chairman. The meeting will be
an Interesting one and the shady side
of politics will be exposed. Judge J. R.
Lewis, Nicholas Bowden, J. H. Days
â  and J. H. Campbell will, the posters
state, "handle local politics without
gloves." A. H. Suzzalo is down for a
talk on the Bchool question.

fALAMEDA REPUBLICANS
GREET GENERAL BARNES
A Great Outpouring of Voters Bears
Evidence to the Popularity of
Republicanism.
The GLted and Eloquent Orator Points Out Some of the
Weak Spots in the Armor of the Unholy
Triple Alliance - A Grand
Parade.
OAKLAND, Oct. l. r >.â California can
trv.s; the Republicans of Alameda County.
The c animated the voters in
November of '96 is not one whit dimin
ished in volume or fervor and the State
:â  will not go south of Tehachapi
this year.
These facts were proved to-night when
inhleri in' the streets
and in the Exposition building to demon
strate their loyalty to their party and to
hear General Barnes.
Early in the evening that feeling of ex
pectancy was manifested which Is so
common In Oakland and everybody ex
pected something unusualâ nor were they
disappointed. When Alameda County Re
publicans undertake to do something,
they do it with "all their heart and soul
and' to-night was no exception. Oakland
Is a Republican cityâ the most ultra Re
. . tornla, and this even-
Ing it seemed to be more Republican than
It doos not requl:
ir red fireror cannon, or march
lumns of uniformed men, bearing
is< < lakland Republicans,
hese things help, and General
s spoke very truly when he said
le felt thoroughly at home In this
city, because everybody he met seemed to
be a Republican.
Considering that the election is yet a
month away the parade was really grand.
ll was led by the Union League Club Of
San Francisco. Grand Marshal Pringle
sat nobly on his caparisoned steed and
had not his aid. H. Pugh, acquired a thor
ough knowledge of horsemanship on the
plains of Montana, there would have been
trouble. Aid Pugh's horse had evidently
hp>n reared on a Populist ranch, for the
cheering of the league and the alliance
â wt-re more annoying than the red fire and
music.
The Republican Alliance of Oakland
made a splendid showing and its coloiÂ«ed
mascot was much In evidence as he
twirled the time honored globe around at
the head of the column. The globe still
contained the McKiniey and Hobart dec
orations that made it famous in "96, but
under it was th*Â» banner of Gage and
>>>ff. The drill corps of the Young Men's
Republican League turned out strong and
m;ide a noble showing for an Initial per
formance.
Oakland, however, did not stand alone,
for the town of Emeryville sent a big
contingent, fully armed with fish horns,
which are always welcome at election
times even in this quiet city. Alameda,
too. was well represented, and the lit
tle Republicans were very evident. They
have not a vote yet, but they carried
transparencies and banners, many of
them of improvised construction, but they
cut a 'figure in the parade, and their yell
ing alongside General Barnes' carriage
rewarded by Home generous hand
waving by the orator.
The warlike spirit Is not yet dead, in
epite of peace reports from Paris. A
large cannon on a heavy wagon boomed
forth fire and thunder as though re-echo-
Ing the noise that was "heard at Santiago
and Manila.
The procession marched through the
principal streets of the city, and as it
passed The Call office the darkness erf
nicht was dispelled for a fÂ»w minutes by
th^ flare of red fire and the myriads of
colored balls that shot into the air and
vanished like the arguments of Judge Ma
guire when subjected to reasoning.
The huge tabernacle was packed, and
with such an audience as Justified the ora
tor's remark that he liked to speak In
Oakland "because of tne character of its
audiences." Certainly it was an audience
of "character" that greeted tne orator.
Fully one-half were ladies, and a more at
crowd never gathered in Oak
blg building. At the front of the
nn was a large picture of President
McKlnlev and the eyes of the nation's
w;ir leader seemed to beam approval on
: udience. It was reserved for
mnered Populist to be the first
turb a political meeting in this cam-
While referring to some of Ma
guir.-V misrepresentations General Barnes

out. "And he was right."
c dead wrong," said the general
Instant! . and the interrupter was laughed
Into silence and humiliation.
The meeting was called to order by Hon.
Arthur Breed, chairman of the county
central committee. He introduced Hon.
W. R. Davis as the chairman of the even-
Ing.
"Two years ago," said Mr. Davis, "we
gathered in this building to celebrate the
election of the great William McKinley,
and I predict that about one month from
now we shall again be here to celebrate
tht; election of Henry T. Gage and the
rest of the State Republican ticket."
Amid great cheering General Barnes
was presented to the audience. He said
in part:
"Mr. Chairman, boys, ladies and gen
tleman: I always say and, of ocurse, al
ways feel, whm I come to Oakland that
I am coining home. I like its audiences
and I like its splendid Republican ma
jorities, because I love the Republican
party and Its traditions, and its galaxy
of great names that since '61 has been
the stars of guidance of this republic.
"My friend, Judge Magulreâ and I
speak of him in a friendly way. because
Individually I feel more friendly toward
him than he feels toward meâ says that
I am out in this campaign for the rail
road. He says I am a kind of human
locomotive on the railroad's tracks, and
move when the string is pulled." (From
one in the audience "That's right.")
"No, that's ilrad wrong. I am Judge
Maguire's nightmare. He does not talk
about Gape, but talks of me. He has
called me a kind of moboerat: that I in
cited mobs, and that he had been on
guard as a soldier when I so Incited the
mob. Mr. Magulre may have believed this
at the time. But I was the commander in
chief at the time when Maguire was on
suard, and if he went anywhere in those
days he went because I sent him.
"The Examiner says that a year ago 1
spoke well of him. I am glad I did, for at
that time he had not stated in Congress
that the European anarchists were true
specimens of American Democracy.
"I did not say, like the Examiner, that
the Democrats are nihilists because they
are weak enough to follow Populism. But
I have often wondered at the remarkable
absorption of the Democrats by the Pop
ulists, or vice versa. '
"I wonder how a good Populist feels
when he attends one of Maguire's meet
ings? For he said he approved the Popu
list platform and would devote himself to
the success of those principles. Yet he
has been on the stump a month, and up
to this hour not once alluded to a single
Populistic doctrine. He has talked noth
ing but railroad and monopoly, and the
people are as ignorant now as to what he
stands for as ever.
"The Populist has listened, but has
heard nothing yet as to the beauties of a
Government conducted on Populistic
principles. In this campaign the Repub
lican party stands where it has always
6toodâ upon the theory of protection to
American production and American la
bor. It stands upon the doctrine of gen
eral education and the uplifting of the
people, and first, last and all the time it
Will stand "for union."
Fusion and the bargain of the three
alleged parties the speaker branded as
being destructive to pure politics and
ruinous to- the spirit of the republic and
an outrage to public decency.
"If Henry T. Gage is elected Governor,"
said General Barnes, "we all know what
he stands for and what he will do. Every
day he is more and more admired for his
directness and simplicity of character and
clear-cut principles. He will make an
honest Governor for California."
The speaker reprimanded the Democ
racy for not standing by Grover Cleve
landâ"the only man." said he," who had
the courage, since the days of the war,
to lift the party out of the mire by op
posing the free and unlimited coinage of
silver. Therefore they don't like him."
The speaker drew a picture of the begin
ning and advancement of man and civil
ization from the monkey up to the perfect
man. who rules the lightning almost.
"But," said he, "the Democratic party
has changed all. It started with Jeffer
son, and, going back, ended with Ma
guire."
He reviewed the issues of the campaign,
pointing out the silence of the trl-party
on the question of the acquisition of new
territoryâ of Hawaii, the Philippines and
Porto Ricoâ and he urged one and all to
stand by and elect Victor Metcalf the next
Congressman from this district, because
of his intelligence on all questions where
in the best Interests of this State lie.
"We want the Philippines," continued
the speaker. "I am in favor of holding
themâ every inch of themâ from now un
til the crack of doom, because they will
be a base for new commercial relations
and interests. We hope before long to
eat oranges and bananas grown in the
Philippines by the- boys we sent there.
I know that nine-tenths of the people of
this State favor the acquisition of the
Philippines. They won't Philippinize us,
but we will Americanize them. That's
why I want you to elect Victor Metcalfâ
cl-^ar-eyed. Intelligent and a man who will
make his mark."
General Barnes predicted that Gage will
defeat Maguire by nearly 20.000 votes.
"Never since I have gone out In any cam
paign have 1 seen such enthusiastic meet
ings everywhere and such a return of
people who have come back to march un

The students of the two universities.
Stanford and California, are preparing
for a big mass-meeting at "Woodward's
Pavilion on the evening of October 29.
This is the first Republican mass-meeting
of the campaign under the auspices of
the college boys, and nothing will lie
spared to make it a gigantic success.
The speakers have not been selected as
yet, but they will be the best the uni
versities wn afford. It is expected also
that there will be some outside speakers,
and George A. Knight is named as one
of these.
Music will be furnished by a band of
forty pieces from Stanford, and the glee
clubs of both colleges will be present and
will render old-time college favoritr-s as
well as prize songs written especially for
the occasion. There are strong Republi
can clubs in both universities, and they
expect to turn out to a man.
A series of three mass-meetings will be
held this week, and Charles L. Patton
will speak at each of them. The first
will be held to-morrow night in Drew's
Hall, 121 New Montgomery street, and
Julius Kahn and D. A. McKinlay are
among the speakers. The second is un
der the auspices of the Julius Kahn Club,
and will be held in the Cyclery Hall at
Haight and Stanyan streets on Tuesday
evening. The last of the series will be
a general mass-meeting in Metropolitan
Temple on Wednesday night. At this
meeting D. A. McKinlay will discuss
protection and single tax.

W. C. BOWMAN
DISAPPOINTED
HIS FRIENDS
He Did Not Appear at
Metropolitan Hall.
TALKED TO THE POPULISTS
PHELAN, BARRY AND HINTON
DISCUSSED POLITICS.
Berated the Railroad for Two Hours
and Did Not Tire â Lean
Toward Single
Tax.
What was announced would be a rous
ing Democratic meeting in Metropolitan
Hall last evening turned out to be a dis
appointment to many. In the first place,
despite the two bonfires and a band, the
hall was not over two-thirds full, but
most of nil W. C. Bowman, an eloquent
speaker of Los Angeles, failed to appear,
as advertised, and the audience had to be
satisfied with a number of orators who
have frequently appeared in public here.
Mr. Bowman got ofi. the train down the
road somewhere to address a gathering
of Populists.
Ij. M. Mansler was Introduced as the
chairman of the evening by W. P. Law
ler. The chairman said that his audience
looked like an intelligent jury. He then
made a speech on special privileges and
rights. He was followed by John
H. Marble, a young man of considerable
literary ability who is one of the most
frequent speakers upon the rostrum of
the socialists of this city. He enlightened
the audience upon matters, of political
economy, and made a special plea for the
consideration of the candidacy of James
H Harry and a few others.
William M. Hinton. candidate for Rail
road Commissioner, asserted that in the
present campaign all of the monopolistic
forces are arrayed on one side against
the people on the other. That is, the
railroad against the Democratic party.
He devoted considerable time to telling
all about the present litigation in the
great grain rate cases pending in the
courts.
John P. Dunn, candidate for a position
on the State Board of Equalization, dis
cussed taxes. ;md presented a bewilder
ing lot or figures on this line of thought,
which appeared to be appreciated, if not
fully understood.
James H. Barry, candidate for Con
press, was introduced, and was received
with cheers. He said that he did not
think the chairman did a kind thing In
introducing him as an ex-convict. He
could not help it if he was sent to jail for
five days for telling the truth. For this
he was punished for a contempt that he
felt then and still feels. Barry unbur
dened his mind a little against courts
and Judges who feel that they are above
the people and yet are the known tools
of corrupt monopolists. He next drifted
to single tax, and said that he himself
is a single taxer, and he wishes, as the
Republican papers state, that this waa
the real Issue in the campaign. He made
a flowery speech in favor of single tax,
and added that neither this nor any other
tax is the n-al issue, but It is the rail
road question, and the Republicans are
trying to throw single tax dust Into the
eyes of th*> people po as to blind them
to the vital issue. Thr speaker then un
corked the vials of his wrath upon the
Southern Pacific, and told what he would
do with this tnstltuion if he goes to Con
gress and could have the power.
Referring to General W. H. L. Barnes'
spre.-h in whicu the latter accused Ma
guire of being an anarchist, Barry said
that Barnes looks like an attorney for a
big railroad; he talks like' one. he smells
like one, and by , he Is one.
Dropping Barnes, whom he abused
roundly, the speaker took up the subjects
of the Nicaragua canal and direct legis
lation. In conclusion, he said that the
candidacy of Joseph R. P. Kelly Is at the
instigation of the Southern Pacific to
split the Democratic vote and elect Julius
Kahn.
Mayor Phelan arrived late. He urged
his hearers to support both the city and
State Democratic tickets, for one is as
important as the other. The Southern
Pacific, he said, is reaching out to gather
in both, as the railroad has great int
in the city and State. Speaking of this
corporation. Mayor Phelan said that the
Southern Paclfir had been robbing the
people of the fenn Joaquin Valley for
years as proved by the fact that when
the Valley road was built through that
country the rates dropped 33 1-3 per cent.
Bevera] male quartets were the pleasing
features of the evening.
PHELAN AS A HEALER.
He Comes, a Messiah, to the Thirty-
First to Heal Democratic
Dissensions.
A crush of fully 100 voters partly crowd
ed Teutonia Hall last evening to sco
James D. Phelan in his great act of
"healing the dissensions in the Demo
cratic ranks of the Thirty-first District."
If applause be anything to judge from,
Mr. Phelan will go down in political his
tory as one of the most successful of
the many healers that his party has from
time to time given to the world.
The meeting was opened by Timothy
E. Tracey, in his capacity of chairman,
who struck the key note of the evening
by alluding to the dissensions that have
riven the party of the Thirty-first Dis
trict. He introduced as the first speaker
of the evening Franklin K. Lane, nominee
for City and County Attorney. Mr. Lane
accused the Republican nominees of pay
ing for their nominations on a graduated
scale, and held up the Democratic virtue
for shining comparison.
"But," said Mr. Lane, "the bosses who
got this money were not always Repub
licans; they learned their first lesson in
the Democratic party."
This ingenuous admission of Mr. Lane
rather paralyzed the sublime healer when
he arose with balm and things to apply
to that portion of Democracy's bleeding
anatomy that lies in the Thirty-first, but
he survived the shock and pointed out
to his hearers that in this election their
district was thrice honored in that the
two offices having the largest patronage
had been given to candidates from the
Thirty-first, and that the standard bearer
James Gee Maguire, had attained man
hood and got his first Job among the men
to whom he spoke.
Turning the tide of his eloquence from
general to personal propositions Mr. Phe
lan confessed a recognlzaole similarity to
a pair of lovers who never tired of talking
of themselves, and with becoming mod
esty pointed out how he had vetoed the
gas rates and the water rates and paved
the streets and saved the Market Street
Railway Company the trouble and ex
pense of tearing up its own tracks. And
incidentally and apparently from the
same personal motive Mr. Phelan took
occasion to roast the morning Republi
can papers for not conducting the Demo
cratic campaign. He bitterly arraigned
them for not publishing in full Maguire
platitudes and Democratic speeches, and
he served kindly warning to all sub
scribers that they were not getting what
they were paying for through this unkind
meagerness of Democratic space.
Another application of arnica to bruised
Democracy and Mr. Phelan gave way to
Richard Doolan, the Thirty-first District
nominee for Superintendent of Streets,
and the plum that Mayor Phelan earlier
in the evening held up to the view of his
audience as "one of the biggest patronage
offices on the ticket
Mr. Doolan was followed by Rhodes
Borden, candidate for Superior Judge, and
he by Washington Dodge, who was con
fident, and said so, that he had, in John
Sii^be, the easiest fight on the ticket.
T. F. Bonnet, candidate for Sheriff, fol
lowed the aspirant to an Assessor's hon
ors, and in a short, timely talk brought
the evening's meeting to an end and sent
what was left of the audience home, well
healed as per intention.

ROYAL WELCOME
TO McKINLEY
President's Entry Into
Illinois.
AN ADDRESS AT SPRINGFIELD
SOME SIGNIFICANT WORDS ON
BRAVERY OF NEGROES.
Cheering Multitudes Also Told of the
Glorious Achievements in Be
half of the Down
trodden.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 15.â The President of
the United States arrived in Chicago
over the Illinois Central to-nieht at 9: 20.
nnd will be the central figure in the
cit./'s peace jubilee next week.
Although much wearied by his long:
journey over the great West and his
arduous day at the Trans-Mississippi
Kxposition he said just before leaving:
tfce train:
"Throughout the journey I have been
deeply moved by '" patriotism of the
people and delighted with the evidences
of their prosperity."
After the city limits were reached,
crowds lined the enclosures beside the
tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad.
I eager to see the President's train sweeD
by. The enthusiasm was unbounded,
even when the President himself could
not be seen.
Mr. McKlnley left the train at Thirty
ninth street, going directly to the home
of Captain La Fayette McWilliams.
where Mrs. McKinley has been enter
tained since arriving from Canton.
The other members of the official party
were taken care oi at the leading hotels.
A welcoming committee of Chicago
citizens met the train at Kan
kakee. Among the members were
Postmaster Gordon, Mayor Harrison,
Dr. William H. Harper, president of the
University of Chicago; John Barton
Payne and Judge Peter S. Grosscup.
Enormous crowds listened to the
words of the President, both at Deca
tur and Springfield. The latter place,
the former residence of Abraham Lin
coln, furnished the largest assemblage
of the day. They listened solemnly and
with bared heads while President Mc
i Kinley uttered feeling words in eulogy
j of Lincoln.
The crowd at Springfield was the rec
i ord breaker of the day, and it is esti
! mated at 40,000. The Fifth Illinois In
j fantry, stationed at Springfield, was a
i pleasing feature here. In an address
the President said:
Fellow citizens: I am glad to meet the
1 people of the State of Illinois at their
j State capital. 1 am glad to bÂ« at the
; home of the martyrized President. His
| name is one of inspiration and a holy
I one to all lovers of liberty the world over.
IHe saved the Union. He liberated a
| race â which he said ought to be free be
i cause there might come a time when
; these black men could help keep the jewel
!of liberty in the family of nations. If
any vindication of that act or of that
j prophecy were needed, it was found when
| the brave black men ascended the hill
I of San Juan in Cuba and charged the
i enemy at El Caney. They vindioated their
i own title to liberty on that neld. and with
I our brave soldiers gave the priceless gift
of liberty to another suffering race. My
I fellow citizens, the name of Lincoln will
' live forever in immortal story. His fame,
his work, his life, is not only an in-
I splratlon to every American boy and
I girl, but to all mankind. And what an
i encouragement his life work has been to
! all his successors in the Presidential of
fice! If any one of them, at any time,
has felt that his burden was heavy, he
! had but to reflect upon the greater bur
; dens of Abraham Lincoln to make his
seem lighter. My fellow citizens, I con
gratulate you that your great State fur
i nished him to the country and to the
; world. You guard sacred his ashes here,
! but the whole country guard with you
I his sacred memory.
The business of the people is better
i than it has been for years, and the money
i of the country has suffered no dishonor,
i while the credit of the Government was
j never higher and the ncitional name was
j never dearer to the people than now and
never more respected throughout the
world. All thanks to our glorious army
and navy, thanks to the fleets of Dewey
and Sampson and the armies of Miles and
Shafter and of Merritt, we have won
glorious triumphs for humanity. We
went to war, not because we wanted to,
but because humanity demanded it. And,
having gone to war for humanity's sake,
we must accept no settlement that will
not take Into account the interest of hu
manity.
Now, my friends, what we want to doâ
(A voice in the crowd: "Elect you
again") â Great applause and cries of
"That's right")â What we want is to have
no dispute of differences among ourselves
to Interfere with our united judgment in
dealing with the foreign problems that
are before us. As we stand together In
war let us stand together until a settle
ment is made.
Particular significance attaches to the
remarks of the President about "black
men" in view of the miners' troubles
at Pana and Virden between the white
strikers and imported negroes, and the
connection with those on the part of
Governor Tanner, who was with the
President on the platform.
Between Springfield and Chicago
stops were made only at Mount Pu
laski, Clinton, Farmer City, Gibson
City, Gilman and Kankakee. At the
latter place the train was boarded by
the Chicago reception committee, head
ed by President Harper of the Univer
sity of Chicago.
SOME CUEIOTJS LEGACIES.
Here are some amusing particulars
of legacies with strange conditions at
tached. Early last year a peculiar pro
bate suit, Involving some $500,000, was
imminent, the disinherited relations
wishing to upset an old gentleman's
will because he had left the sum named
to found and endow a church on the
condition that every Sunday before the
service the whole of the Thirty-nine Ar
ticles were to be read by the clergy
man outside the church door.
A 6trange condition was attached to
the legacy the late Sir Edward Bates,
who died last year, left to his married
daughter. He stated that he had seen
his son-in-law's Scotch property, 'and
he considered it would be a gross in
jury to his daughter and her children,
considering "there are no neighbors
within miles, and there Is no medical
man within six or seven miles." So he
arranged that, if his daughter stayed
more than six months in any year,
"and those six months not in winter,"
at that spot, the income derived from
the legacy for the twelve succeeding
months should go to the residuary
legatee.
During this year a gentleman who
died at Mons left a legacy of $3000 to
five friends, the money to be spent on
dinners served in different restaurants,
and at each meal a certain dish to be
eaten and a certain wine, of which he
was very fond, to be drunk. Further
more, his memory was to be toasted
at dessert, the five companions were to
dine in black clothes and gloves and
enter the room preceded by a flag and
the music of an accordion.
A wealthy gentleman recently left
his son a large fortune on the condition
that he shall visit every country in the
world and write a book on what he
sees. This work is to be submitted to

THE PORTRAITURE RAGE.
The general craze among fashionable
people for having their portraits done in
I all manner of ways, says the London
i Mail, is giving a good deal of impetus
! to that branch of art and much empioy
] ment to women who have adopted the
profession either as pastel portrait tak
ers miniaturists or modelers in clay.
Miniatures on ivory and water and oil
i pictures are as much the rage as ever.
j When in addition to this it is remem-
I bered that people who can, afford it
] have developed a taste for having
: cameo likenesses cut and busts and bas-
I reliefs made in marble, it will be seen
that the age is not decadent in its ap
| preciation of all that is best In por
traiture.
Cameo photographs are a new fash
ion introduced from Paris, and one
which those unable to afford gems may
find equally pleasing, while not so ex
pensive. The photograph, taken, of
course, in black and white, is mounted
on a square block of wood, in which is
cut a depression to receive the portrait.
The effect of an intaglio is thus given,
while the lights and shades in the pho
tograph preserve the impression of a
cameo.
Several very wealthy American
women have had their portraits painted
on sets of plates, in which a different
costume is shown on each one. For in
stance, one set intended for luncheon
was of Sevres ware, on which the fair
owner is represented in evening, street,
reception and skating dress, and in a
summer gown and her bridal array.
The most extravagant of all these
fads is the stained-glass portrait. Such
a one was done for the Queen of Italy
some time ago, and it is reported, too,
that a wealthy young Duchess is sitting
I to an academician for a small medal
lion portrait of painted glass.
.â¢ â¦ â 
COLORING OF THE BUBBLE.
So far all artificial colors have been pro
duced from dye stuffs exclusively, most of
the latter having a pronounced color of
their own. The handsomest of all, how- i
ever are the spectral colors produced
through prisms and distinguished by
wonderful clearness and purity, which it
has never before been deemed possible to
accurately reproduce. To a certain de
gree the scientist Henry, in Paris, has
now succeeded in permanently fixing the
delicate colors resulting from the inter
ference of light waves.
The objects upon which the colors are
' fastened are thin sheets of water proof
paper, polished glass plates or thin
boards, which are placed in a dish and
covered with water. On the bottom of
the dish there are a number of very small
openings, governed by a stopcock, ena
bling the operator to let off the water
slowly and evenly. After the water has
settled in the dish a few drops are added
of a solution of asphalt, bitumen, or a
similar material, which is separated from
the water in an Insoluble shape by the
action of air and light.
When the essence has covered the sur
face of the water it forms a very thin
film and vibrations of the air produced J
by whistling across the surface of the
film are transferred upon the thin film,
bringing forth a series of color combina
tions, each of which corresponds to a
given sound. After a short time the me
dium wherein the bitumen has been dis
solved evaporates, and as the first small
wrinkles appear in the film the stopcock
is opened and the water is allowed to
flow off slowly. The film sinks evenly
upon the surface which is to be colored.
Finally the sheet of paper or glass is
dried, and the result is the appearance
of wondt-rfuHy beautiful iridescent color
ing on the surface.
Samples of moire paper treated in this
manner have recently been received in the
Arts and Trades Museum of Berlin and
attracted considerable attention. The new
invention of producing these colors with
out using dyestuffs has been patented in
many countries, and is now being em
ployed commercially in Paris, where pa
per to be used for fans and other fancy
work is being manufactured in large
quantities. The process, although exact
ing the most minute care, is inexpensive
and therefore very remunerative. â Phila
delphia Record.

DECREASED CONSUMPTION OF
LIQUOR.
One of the leading wholesale and retail
liquor dealers in this city, in a business
conversation, said: ."The liquor - drinking
habit is decreasing among our people.
Our sales of all kinds of liquors in l v .i 7
wore one-third less than they were five
years ago." The remark led to an inves
tigation, and the records of the Internal
Revenue Bureau confirmed the fact as
to the decrease in consumption of dis
tilled and malt liquors, and only a trifling
inc.rer.se in the domestic consumption of
wines. The decrease noted has been
gradual, about 8 per cent per year during
the past four years. Little wonder that
the whisky trust went to the wall finan
nanclally, or that so many distillers and
whisky- dealers have failed in the pa^t
five years. What the influences are which
have brought about this result cannot be
definitely stated, but it is claimed that
the bicycle has had much to do with it. â

THE RESISTLESS TOURIST.
f~~) UT a short time ago Omdurman was a strong
\\ hold of the wild Dervishes of the Soudan, be
*â  â * yond the pale of civilization and hardly known
to the polite world. Kitchener's victory made it
iamous a few weeks since, and now we learn it is
about to become a fashionable resort, a place where
weary Europeans will go in search of winter sunshine
and the joys of social life.
The Westminster Gazette in describing the de
gree of interest taken in the place by the blase
crowds of pleasure seekers in London, who, wearied
of all the old resorts, are now desirous of a new one,
says:
"Omdurman is not only to become the Soudanese
Birmingham, it is to be a fashionable resort as well.
An energetic society is already planning out a casino
for the banks of the Blue Nile, with a cricket and
football ground, and an aquarium for the crocodiles,
whiie the inevitable public-house will soon be up at
the street corners. To make the picture complete, the
Salvation Army has, it is said, decided to send out
a detachment to look after the morals of the freshly
civilized. There will, of course, be an organized po
lice force. Happy Soudanese!"
The proposed rush to the Soudan for a new
pleasure ground is nothing new under the sun. We
have had many illustrations in America of the use
fulness of tourist travel in building up out of the way
places. It was that class of people in the Northern
States who discovered and built up South Florida,
and to a large extent Southern California and many
parts of Colorado and Montana. They may yet prove
to be more potent than the gold-seekers themselves
in civilizing Alaska.
The modern tourist is, in fact, resistless. He is j
unwearying in his deÂ«ire for novelty. No amount of
travel fatigues him. He has money to burn. If
he were sure of a good hotel, a lawn tennis court and
a golf field at the end of his journey he would alter
nate willingly between the North Pole and Hades
from winter to ?ummer in search, of amusement. He'
is one of the adventurous pioneers of civilization in
our epoch, and the world of trade and industry can
well afford to wish this fleeting idler success in his
plan for making a winter garden and a place of
beauty out of the blood-stained desert around Om-*
durman.
TRAIN-ROBBING fJS fl DISEASE.
INHERE is an old familiar ring to the announce
ment that Jesse James has come under sus
picion of having robbed a train. Possibly this
will tend to elevate him in local esteem, for there are
reports that in various back counties of Missouri the
picture of the original Jesse hangs above the mantel,
and youth are trained to look upon it with awe, much
as the infantile American is wont to gaze at the por
trait of the father of his country.
However, train-robbing has its serious aspect, and
young Jesse may find a paucity of roses along his
pathway, whereupon it*will behoove hiim to make a
defense. Why can he not set f th, to the great edi
fication of a sympathetic jury, that train-robbing is
an inherited taste? Having established tliis, he could
not be held culpable. When a man commits murder
he has only to make clear that he received from his
ancestors some peculiar bent, and then everybody
says "Poor fellow, innocent as a lamb." Thereupon
justice gives him his clearance papers into the wide
world, the spectators drop appreciative tears, and the
next case is called.
It cannot be contended that train-robbing is a
laudable form of industry, but it certainly is as good
as murder, and Jesse is entitled to as much considera
tion as an assassin. Whatever the outcome, Missouri
will mourn. The idea that a Jesse James should have
been concerned in the holding up of a train, the epi
sode being devoid of dash or heroism or a big haul,
will tend to dim the halo above the pride of the State,
the boss highrailwayman of the whole lot.
Yesterday's execution at San Queniin was not a
pleasing spectacle. The fact should impress those
who are contemplating the commission of murder, as
well as the morbid who have a habit of yawping at
the foot of the scaffold on such somber occasions.
According to the classic Gallagher of the Board
of Education, the recent judicial decision against that
body in the Kilpatrick matter was the rottenest ever
rendered in a California court. We suspect Gal
lagher of bias.
Perhaps Policeman Kenville can demonstrate that
his club flew out of his pocket when he wasn't look
ing, and of its own volition struck a small boy.
Gomez needs to be impressed with the idea that
the cruel war ia over.
A
THE MAGUIRE OF RECORD.
JUDGE MAGUIRE has presented himself as
one who learned sympathy for the poor as a
toiler and mechanic himself. We have hereto
fore said that he quit work very young and went at
once to holding office and drawing a salary, and has
stuck to it since with a zeal and constancy that mark
him as the champion place-holder and pap-sucker
of California, not excepting John P. Dunn, who has
flitted from office to office, like a honey bee from
flower to flower.
Judge Maguire began at the age of 19 as clerk to
E. F. Preston (Republican), appointed as attorney
to collect delinquent street assessments. Maguire
held this office and drew down $75 a month until
January, 1876, when, having got another office as
member" of the Legislature, he went to Sacramento
and drew down a legislator's salary, mileage, etc., for
the months of January, February and March, 1876.
When he returned with his salary in his pocket he
stepped back into his old office of attorney's clerk,
John B. Weller having meantime succeeded Mr.
Preston in the collection of delinquent street assess
ments. In 1878 the office of Attorney was abolished
and Maguire began practicing at the law, with no
conspicuous success. In 1882 Buckley nominated and
elected him to the Superior bench, where he sat six
years, drawing a salary of $24,000, and most of the
time abusing the man who made him Judge and
bolting the party on whose ticket he was a candidate.
He left the party in 1887 and the bench in 1889, and
lived on his accumulated salaries until 1892, when he
came back to the party and was elected to Congress,
and has held office and drawn salary ever since.
No man has been more conspicuous for using a
party for selfish ends and treating it with disloyal
contempt than Maguire.
He has lived on office since he was 19 years old
and has never hesitated to bolt, desert and defeat the
party to which he owes his bread and the butter that
spreads it. No office-holder ever returned less ser
vice to the people for the salary they have paid him.
He has drawn his salary in gold and paid for it in
words, words, words. The following is a correct list
of his offices held and salaries drawn since he was 19
years old:
;Merk to Preston 1R72-76 % 3,600
".egislature, January, February and March,
1576 900
! Clerk to Wellar, April 1, 1876. to April 1. 1878... 1,800

Iggg 24,000
Congressman, March, 1893, to March, 1899 30,000
Mileage 16 - SGO
Total J76.860
Maguire is now 45 years old. His official salaries,
therefore, amount to exactly $1708 per year for every
year that he has lived.
We challenge the record for any other man in Cali
fornia who has been paid a salary equal to $1708 a
year, or $142 33 a month, or $4 75 a day, ever since
he was born. The account stands:
Maguire born 1553.
Maguire 45 years old in 1898.
Maguire's salary $76,860 00
Per year, 45 years 1,708 00
Per month, 540 months 142 33
Per day, 16,20) days 4 75
What service has he rendered for it? He has come
high, and what has he returned to the people for a
salary of $4 75 for every day since he was an infant
mewling and puking in his nurse's arms?
ASSESSOR SIEBE.
BY the fierceness of the attack made by the Ex
aminer upon Assessor Siebe, the public can
estimate the extent to which his honest admin
istration of the office has thwarted the schemes and
desires of the boodle organ. Since M,r. Huntington
cut the Hearstlings from the payroll of the Southern
Pacific they have been hungrier than ever to levy
tribute upon other corporations. As Assessor Mr.
Siebe has refused to aid them in exacting blackmail,
and they are therefore fighting him more viciously
than any other candidate for office of the Republican
ticket.
The Hearstlings concede that Mr. Siebe's admin
istration of the office of Assessor has won for him
throughout the community the honorable reputation
of being an official of distinguished honesty. The
word rankles in the minds of the Hearstlings, By
styling him "Honest John Siebe" they endeavor to
weary the people with the phrase, as of old some of
the baser sort of Athenians were weary of hearing
Aristides called the just. They would have Mr. Siebe
defeated for re-election simply because he is known
to be an official of unassailable integrity.
John D. Siebe has now administered the office of
Assessor for eight years. During the whole of that
time there has been in the office no scandal; not one
act of commission or omission has given rise to a
suspicion or even to a rumo^of wrongdoing. His
assessments have been made with business-like fair
ness, accuracy and efficiency. He has aimed to pro
portion the burdens of taxation imposed by law with
an impartial equity upon all classes of citizens. He
has neither exempted the rich from their share of
public burdens for the sake of courting their favor,
neither has he threatened to cinch them by unjust as
sessments for the purpose of compelling them to buy
justice by paying tribute either to himself or to dis
reputable newspapers.
The records of the Assessor's office during Mr.
Siebe's administration show that he has performed
faithfully the duties imposed upon him. He has not
made in any one year a radical or excessive increase
in the taxation of banks and corporations, but dur
ing the whole term of his administration there has
been a steady upward rise in the proportion of rev
enues raised from that class of property-owners.
Thus while the personal property assessment of 1800,
the year preceding Mr. Siebe's accession to office,
amounted to $66,082,372, and in the present year is
$68,695,110, showing an increase of but $2,612,738,
the increase in the assessments of banks and fran
chises of corporations having special privileges was
during the same period $11,365,085.
On that showing the people can understand the
animus of the attack of the Hearstlings. It is clear
the managers of the' Examiner feel something must
be done to make up for forfeited subsidy from the
Southern Pacific.
Spanish papers express surprise that the representa
tives of the United States are unwilling to leave the
decision of terms to arbitration. That might have
been done before the war. There is nothing left to
arbitrate.
While a railroad man was having his toes ampu
tated at the City Receiving Hospital he requested the
surgeon to "stop tickling his foot." Such a sense of
perception is worth cultivating.
It would perhaps not be a bad plan of the Non-
Partisans to drop the prefix. To a casual reader it
might be misleading.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1898.
THE DEAD NON-PfiRTISfINS.
AT a recent meeting of the so-called Non-
Partisan candidates it was decided to levy an
assessment of 10 per cent of the salaries in
prospect upon all who have received the stigma of a
nomination by the Democratic sideshow, except
School Directors, who were asked to contribute $20
each to the cause. This exception was due to the
fact that School Directors receive no compensation.
How they are going to get back their money in the
event of election is therefore problematical.
It is interesting to note that the nominees of Mr.
Phelan's sideshow have taken this action. It is in the
nature of a Non-Partisan revival. The party dis
appeared so completely after the adjournment of its
convention, and the disrepute which followed it into
retirement was so blinding and overwhelming, that
we were actually beginning to believe it had g"one
into permanent eclipse. But here it is again assess
ing candidates, concocting street banners, arranging
for a card distribution, and preparing to make*a wild
charge upon the offices.
However, activity upon the part of this Demo
cratic sideshow, we are convinced, is entirely super
fluous. Being a tail to Mayor Phelan's ticket, it is
not in a position to deceive anybody, and in the
iiatural order of things it cannot, while operating un
der its present domino, get more than a thousand
votes, if it does that many. It is a safe wager that
"Dave" Barry, chief of the first "Solid Nine" Board
of Supervisors, who is running for Supervisor in the
Sixth Ward on a petition nomination, will poll more
votes than Deacon Fitch's fraudulent band of- assist
ant job-chasers.
It is really too bad that this should be so. As a
moral reform party, as an influence for producing
good government, as an example in local politics and
a distributor of platform pledges, the Non-Partisan
party occupied an important position in the political
affairs of San Francisco. As a Democratic bunko
steering apparatus, however, pledged to get votes for
the candidates nominated by a wealthy and arrogant
boss, it is a distinct source of evil and corruption.
We, are, indeed, sorry that the Non-Partisans have
fallen so low. We do not object to their assessing
their candidates, but it is a pitiable spectacle to see
a once proud band of local patriots calling public at
tention to their hideous condition by making public
report of the fact.
In our judgment the Non-Partisans would do well
to revoke this assessment and disband. That course
would rescue their self-respect from the filthy pool
into which Phelan has plunged it, and at the same
time a substantial public duty would be discharged.
SENATE constitutional amendment No. 10,
which proposes to authorize the people of
counties in this State, through Boards of Free
holders, to frame charters for their own government,
should be carefully scanned by voters at the coming
election. The principle upon which the amendment
has been drawn is good enough. Beyond question
the power to legislate for counties should be taken
away from the Senate and Assembly. Those bodies
have abused their privileges heretofore and will prob
ably continue to do so in the future, yielding, as they
constantly do, to the demands of the politicians and
tax-eaters, whose interests are ordinarily inimical to
those of the people.
But the amendment gives the counties more home
rule than they can reasonably ask, and certainly more
than on principle they should possess. For instance,
it is proposed to confer upon the Board of Freehold
ers which may be chosen to frame county government
charters the right "to prescribe the manner and
method by which all elections by the people shall be
conducted, and may in addition determine the tests
and conditions upon which electors, political parties
and organizations may participate in any primary
election."
Since the amendment provides that the charters so
framed shall not be subject to general laws upon the
same subjects, the clause quoted would authorize the
County Boards of Freeholders, as to their counties,
to repeal the Australian ballot law or any general
primary act which might be passed by the Legisla
ture. We doubt whether the people of the State will
generally sanction any such grant of power as this.
So far as San Francisco is concerned, it has no in
terest in the amendment, and unless there is some
sort of an expression from the people of the interior
with respect to this feature of it probably they will
vote for its adoption. It is to the interest of the
counties, therefore, that they should inform us at
once of their desires in the premises.
Ballot laws and primary laws ought to be general.
It would be absurd to have fifty-seven different ballot
and primary systems in California, yet Senate amend
ment No. 10 throws the door open to such a condi
tion. If a particular Courthouse ring of a particular
county should desire to return to the straight ticket
system all it would need to do would be to capture
a County Board of Freeholders and get the matter
before the people. The latter might not be persuaded
to adopt the change, but amid a multiplicity of issues
there is always danger of losing sight of many im
portant ones, and the grant of power might lead in
many cases to turning back the hands of progress.
The Australian ballot system is now well rooted, and
it should be permitted to bear its full fruit. What
ever good there is in it can only be got out of it
by enforcing and developing the system which it has
established.
Home rule for the counties is an excellent thing,
but in our judgment the framers of Senate amend
ment No. 10 have given them too much of it. The
counties do not for their own good government re
quire authority to control the manner of voting
within their limits at general and primary elections.
Legislation on that subject may safely be left to the
State, which is required to pass general and uniform
laws. /

It is not clear to the lay and conse

how the Rev. John Hemphill can sup
port his contention that the Philippines

which happens to please, and ascribing
the undesirable phases of life to cir
cumstances beyond control. If, for in

been accredited by him? If divine de

An Italian has perfected a process of
marbleizing the dead ao that bodies
tenantless of soul may be preserved for
an indefinite period. They are said to
resemble carved images, and the
mourner is supposed to have the priv
ilege of gazing on them and thus keep
ing grief fresh and interesting. Possi
bly when the grief shall at last have
passed away the marbleized deceased
can be utilized as a Sutro Heights style
of ornamentation. Yet there Is diffi
culty in discerning the usefulness of
preserving the dead in the shape of
bogus statuary or anything else. The
mortal frame from which disease or in
jury has induced the spirit to vanish
is not left in a condition of attractive
ness. Some people even decline to look
upon their beloved dead, preferring to
remember them as they appeared when
blood was coursing in their veins and a
light shining from their eyes. When
a body has served its term as the abode
of a soul it should be permitted to re
turn to dust, and all processes em
ployed in its treatment ought to be in
the direction not of retarding but hast
ening the process. For my part I ap
prove of Poet Miller's funeral pyre, and
could name a number of persons whom
I could cheerfully observe contributing
their ashes to the winds which sweep
Miller's home. Science is wasting time
when it makes marble out of the hu

demarbleization of hearts which still

An interesting feature about the

the charge was made in the Examiner.
In support of its allegations the paper
printed July 17 Manila letters bearing

G. "W. Steevens, an English corre
spondent who was at the battle of Om
durman, told to the world the best war
story it has read :or many a day. The
slaughter of the Dervishes as related
by him becomes to the reader an actual
spectacle, full of life and death. One
seems to hear the roar of guns, the
clashing of steel, to see the clouds
hanging somber above the crimsoned
hills where natives fight to the last
gasp. The ferocious courage of the
fanatics is portrayed by Steevens as no
writer could have portrayed it without
the wine of war hot within him. Yet it
would be unfair to compare the work
of this correspondent with that of
American special commissioners in
Cuba during our recent scrimmage.
There were opportunities for good
work, mostly neglected it is true, but
there was no magnificent finale to be
described in sonorous phrase, each as
impressive as a battle hymn. Yet it
may justly be said this country has no
such war correspondent as Steevens, or
if it has, that he has been kept from
the scene. I cannot even make an ex
ception of Hearst, but may add that
England has no such correspondent as

Mr. Morton neglected to state that the
letter had appeared almost word for

for writing such stuff Brann has re
tired frqm the turf and reposes under

It may have been observed that after
the estate of the late Jacob Davis had
been settled according to the will of
the deceased and the decree of the
court, up bobs a set of heirs from the
South with a declaration of war and
hands extended for the swag. The mat
ter is none of my business, nor yours,
for which reason we naturally take an
interest in it. There is much injustice
done in the making of wills, perhaps,
but it is small compared with the injus
tice involved in the breaking of the
wills. When a man has secured a for
tune by industry or luck it has always
seemed to me there should rest with
him some right in disposing 1 of it. If a
man has wife and children he is re
sponsible for their welfare and In honor
bound to provide for them as best he
may. The wife probably assisted him
in acquiring wealth, and the children
appeared on the scene quite without
solicitation on their part. But what
ever is true as to the wife or direct de
scendants, I do not see why cousins,
aunts and remoter connection have any
claim. The Southern aspirants for the
Davis dollars are said to be children of
a brother. Davis was, I hope, in no
manner responsible for them. While
he lived to have supported them would
have been charity and made of them
paupers. Now that he is dead I can
not figure out how they sustain any
more Intimate relation to his fortune
than they did before.

has been promised "a stable govern
ment, and an early move in this direc
tion would be to take arms from the
Cubans and make them go to work.
They have been out of practice now for
a long time, but other people eat bread
that has been earned in the sweat of
the brow rather than that donated and
undeserved. The Cuban ought not to
be permitted to be an exception. There
is no evidence that he is any better
than the rest of the world.
The National Advertiser, noting the
methods of the New York Journal, and
citing a few of them, asks: "How can
a paper which resorts to such petty
swindling expect to be believed, even
If it tell the truth?" The answer has
not been given. Probably the Journal
has no expectation of being believed, at
least in testing the matter it has not
gone to the length of disguising its
fabrications.
â¢ * *
When a scoundrel invader
sphere of life known as "society" th- â 
is great ado, and properly, if he char
to be discovered. Sut there are c:
ures every day almost of villainy in
official life and nobody seems to care.
The difference between a swell func
tion and politics is considerable, and
yet society at large, not the little
clique which takes in washing for one
generation and uses a crest on its sta
tionery the next, but the whole people,
doing business, rearing families, spec
ulating, building churches, schools,
railroads and sewers, is much more vi
tally concerned about politics than pink
teas. Nevertheless, men known to be
corrupt are given office. Supervisors
steal the city blind. Boards of Educa
tion go into the industry of larceny,
millions of dollars are worse than wast
ed for street improvements which never
materialize, the Harbor Commissioners
permit the State to be robbed. Some
times the case Is so flagrant that ad
verse comments are heard, but they are
absolutely without effect. A Mayor se
lects the men who shall constitute the
various governing bodies in the de
partments; these prove to be deep-dyed
rascals as to an overwhelming major
ity, the honest among them being
smothered. Yet the Mayor coming for
ward for re-election "points with
pride" to his record! People have sim
ply become accustomed to being victim
ized. They accept as a duty of citizen
ship the experience of having unclean
political hands thrust into their pock
ets. Ido not understand why one
should cherish resentment toward a
burglar, why the highwayman sho ild
get twenty years, when an official who
is as dishonest as either and has great
er opportunity goes unmolested, but it
is even so. Please consider these re
marks as general. It would not be fair
to point out any single administration,
since about the same grade of rottenness
seems to permeate the lot. Surely the
time has come for a change. There
should be an effort^o create the im
pression that a political sandbagger is
as bad as any other, and that one who
attacks society as a whole should be
corrected and driven out, just as the
polished blackguard who invades the
home of wealth with Intent to despoil.
A St. Louis paper maintains a de
partment which is termed "Aunt
Mary's Advice." It is adorned with the
picture of Auntie, who resembles much
in facial charm the venerable Susan B.
Anthony. The resemblance does not
extend to the intellectuality, for Mary
seems to be several sorts of a gibbering
freak rolled in one. Young women ap
ply to her for advice as to love affairs.
They wish to understand the propriety
of permitting the bestowal of a chaste
kiss, the relative merit of the long and
short engagement, if they should accept
presents before having promised to
wed. In fact, there is no fool question
in the query box of the love-lorn which
is not dragged forth and fired at faith
ful old Mary. All of them are an
swered. There is never one worth an
swering. When a girl wants to know
if she can properly declare her affection
for a man, explaining that she has
reached the age of 16, and knows she
will never love another. Aunt Mary
tells her patiently that top declaration
ought to come from th< A, to wait
and not give up hope, i oUspect Aunt
Mary of not beiqg genuine. She prob
ably wears pantaloons, smokes a cob
pipe, take 3 a drink at the corner gro
cery, is known as Tom or Jim, and pos
sibly is a good fellow. She ought to be
ashamed of himself.
THE AMERICAN BOY.
I wonder if the boys and girls
Who lived in olden time
Were like the boys and girls we knoT
In our age and clime.
I wonder if the girls had dolls,
Or did the boys play ball,
Or did good little Samuel
Know how to play at all!
I love the sweet Babes in the Wood,
And, oh, how my heart grieves
To think they slept upon the groups*
With cover made of leaves!
I love the Princes in the Tower
In curls and ruffles line.
I hate their wicked uncle, too,
I'm glad he isn't mine!
I wonder if they laughed and talke*
Or were they always sad.
I'm sure I should be if I had
An uncle half so bad.
With my brave company of boys
I wouldn't take one hour
To capture him, and rescue botfc.
Those Princes in the Tower!
0 children of the olden time,
I read of you in books,
1 see your pictures on the walls.
And love your gentle looks.
Your sad eyes seems to follow ma
About where'er I play.
As if you longed to have the fun
We children have to-day!

tain did not find a deep entrance, his
labors demonstrating conclusively that
the bars across the river's mouth at no
place allowed the entrance of ocean ves
sels. The deepest water at any place was
eight feet. The captain found that dredg
ing was practicable in order to open an
entrance, but the cost would be consider
able.
The five exploring parties sent through

from an authentic source, however, that

FIRE IN A MATTRESS FACTORY
THE COMPANY HAD A LARGE
GOVERNMENT ORDER.
! Sparks From the Motor Cause the
Blazeâ Valencia and Senator
May Have to
Wait.
Sparks from the electric motor ignited
some silk iloss in the wool room of the
j Bernhard Mattress Company, at 044 Mis
: siun street, shortly before 5 o'clock yes
terday afternoon, causing; a nre which did
$10,000 damage to the concern. The blaze
wiil probably delay the departure of the
Government transports, as the linn had
a large contract to supply mattresses and
bedding for the vessels. It will be sev
eral days before the factory can be oper
ated, and the manufactured stock already
on hand was considerably damaged by
water and smoka
The fire started just about the tjme
when wurk was being shut down for the
day. Fort mail F. H. Rice of the wool
room, which is in the top story of the
building, told William Hall to shut off
the inuior, which he did. As the motor
slowed down a number of sparks were
emitted. The room was lilled with fly
| ing particles of silk iloss which was be
i ing "picked," and some of this flew into
i the motor and became ignited by the
sjurks. In a minute the entire room was
in a blaze. The excelsior and other in
ilammabic upholstering stock Quickly took
Tire anu burned like tinder. The em
ployes in the wool room made an at
â  to extinguish the flames, but find
ing their efforts unavailing sought safety
by retreat down the stairs, which for
tunately were on the opposite side of the
room trom where the lire started.
Joseph Ross, who was employed in the
storeroom, ran to the water tower house
and had an alarm turned in Irom box
No. 61. As soon as the department ar
rived at the burning building it was seen
that rapid work was required to keep
the flames under control, so skipping the
second alarm a third was turned in im
mediately. The water tower was slow in
getting to work, consuming nearly fifteen
minutes before it got a stream of water
on the building. After it began opera
tions, however, the fiames were soon ex-
tinguished.
The .Bernhard Company has been work
ing a force of 102 men night and day for
the past month In order to fill a number
of large orders, and has enough work on
hand to keep a full force at work for the
next three months. A $s",'>.'O Government
I contract for supplying the transports with
mattresses were one of the orders being
filled at the time of the fire. A large
number of mattresses had been com
pleted, and these were to have been taken
aboard the Valencia and Senator this
morning. They were stored on the first
floor of the building, and in spite of the
rubber blankets placed over them by the
men from the fire patrol it is feared they
have been damaged by water. Whether
enough undamaged ones can be found to
supply the two troopships, which were
to depart this week, is a Question, and ;
if there are enough the members of the
firm fear that the insurance companies j
will nut allow them to be removed until |
they can be examined and the salvage es- i
Llmau-d. This will take two or three
days, so it is probable that the trans
ports will be delayed for that length of
time.
Perhaps a week will be required to fit
up the factory in shape to begin work
on the fittings for the other troop ships
which are expected to leave soon after
the departure of the Senator and Valen
cia. The firm has been planning to move i
into a building directly across the street
for some time, and the fire will in all
probability hasten the move. An order )
from the Pacific Mail Company for the j
refitting of the China and City of Pana- !
ma was being filled by the Bernhard Com
pany, and the leather fittings have been
damaged more or less by water and
smoke.
The fire was confined to the top floor,
which was completely gutted. In the third
story was the upholstering shop, while |
the second floor was usr-d as a store room.
Captain Comstock of the fire patrol had
the stock well blanketed in a short time j
after the alarm was turned in, but the I
entire building was flooded with water
from the tower and a great deal of the
stock was damaged.
The loss is estimated by the owners to
be about $16,000, but Captain Comstock
thinks it will hardly reach $10,000. This
is entirely covered by insurance, the com
pany carrying policies for between $15,000
and $20,0)0. The damage to the building,
which is owned by Mrs. R. F. Deane of
Berkeley, will not exceed $500.
The motor which started the fire had
been considered a menace to the estab
lishment, and on advice from the fore
man preparations had been made to have
It boxed to-day. After the firemen had
left the building last evening employes
of the f-stablishment were paid their
week's wages and instructed to report
for work this morning.

HOW CAPTAIN CLARK
GAVE UP THE OREGON
Fireman Smiths Simple Recital of tfye Big Bat
tleship's Glory.
pRANK SMITH, a young fireman, who shipped on the United States
H battleship Oregon, has returned to this city, and is now at the State
J. of California Hotel, corner of Fourth and Howard streets.
He was with the big fighter on her memorable trip around the
Horn, and assisted in feeding her furnaces during the great naval battle
which resulted in the destruction of Admiral Cervera's fleet off Santiago
de Cuba.
Smith is a native of Kentucky, and is a fine physical specimen. His
time of enlistment having expired he will enjoy a vacation and then prob-
ably return to the service of Uncle
Sam with a somewhat better place.
"We did not fear the scrap we
were to have," he remarked, in
talking about his experience, "but
it was running her 14,000 miles when
we were short of firemen. At Callao
we had to work thirty-six hours on
a stretch in coaling ship. The
same thing happened at Sandy
Point in the Straits of Magellan.
"We did not know that the war
was on, of course, until we arrived
at Rio Janeiro. After that, you
bet, we kept a sharp lookout, but
it was, as Captain Clark said, we
didn't fear the whole Spanish navy.
"After coaling and cleaning up
at Key West, we got a full crew
and went with the New York to the
scene of action. When trouble be
gan that morning of the 3d of July
the Oregon, as was shown, was
ready for the fray. Being relieved
at times in the fireroom I had an
opportunity of witnessing a good
deal of the light.
"Captain Clark stood right out
on the forward thirteen-inch tur
ret and gave his orders. We fired
the first and last shot of that en-
gagement. The first was a six-inch shell. Then everything opened up,
and I tell you there was music in the air. The thermometer was 170 de
grees down below, the forced draught sizzing and the furnaces roaring
like hades.
"The propellers were making 12S revolutions a minute and that drove
the ship at the rate of seventeen knots an hour. We engaged every one
of the enemy's ships, one after another, .going by our own vessels almost
like a shot, and never stopping until the Cristobal Colon was landed.
The Oregon had a 'bone' in her mouth such as she never had before.
"We have not really received due credit. We were closer in on the
enemy than any other vessel of our fleet, and the reason we were not
hit as often as the Brooklyn was because they shot over us, and the out
lying ships got the shot at long range. The Brooklyn was three miles off
our port bow when we were closing in on the Maria Teresa and Colon. Be
fore this, however, the Vizcaya was giving us some zigzag work, but she
did not last long.
"The Spaniards fought furiously, but, as we all know now, they could
not shoot. A number of us went on boarft the Maria Teresa after she
was beached, and there I saw a terrible sight. Among other things, there
was a dead Spaniard wrapped in the flag of his native country. He had
been wounded unto death, and had crawled several feet afterward In or
der to die in this manner. Master-at-Arms Sherwood, observing it, re
marked: 'Well, if you are loyal as ali that I'll bury you in your flag."
and he threw him overboard."
Smith says that he had a regular Jaunting tour across the continent.
He and his companion, Thomas Smith, also an Oregon fireman, were al
lowed to stop over on their tickets wherever they pleased. At the Trans
mississippl Exposition at Omaha they wore smothered with attentions.
When the ladies became assured that they had passed through the big
battle in the Pacific Coast fighting machine they bestowed all kinds of
caresses and salutations upon them, and detained them as natural curi
osities for more than a week.
Smith faya it was embarrassing at first, but he soon got to liking it.
It was a sad scene, he declares, when Captain Clark took leave of his
ship and crew. All hands were called forward to bid him adieu, possibly
for the last time. The emotions of the gallant commander were really
distressing to officers and men. All he could say to them was: "God
bless the men of the Oregon." Then saluting he was escorted to a
launch amid the wildest cheering.
In the midst of the battle and the trying portion of the long trip the
captain gave orders to serve the firemen with Ice to the exclusion of his
own table, and he saw that the firemen only were served with gTog, be
cause, as he said, they needed extra stimulant.
Smith says the Oregon is "good enough for him."
[ troops designated to embark upon the
transport Senator will be expected to be
aboard that vessel by noon to-morrow.
General Miller stated that the troops
would leave their camp at the Presidio
as soon as it was convenient to-morrow
morning, probably about 10 o'clock. . It
Is expected that the Senator will sail to
morrow afternoon. Yesterday's fire may
modify all these orders.
The Valencia, which was to have sailed
with the Senator, will not be ready to re
ceive her troops until Tuesday, and in
consequence will not sail until the follow
ing day, but being a faster ship than the
Senator will overtake her. Unless or
dered to keep the Senator company, the
Valencia will reach Manila some time
ahead of her. The Valencia will probably
go to Angel Island if there Is- enough
water at the dock there to take aboard
the Second Battalion of the First Wash
ington troops, which has been designated
to go on her.
The Pennsylvania and Rio Janerio are
expected in to-day. The latter has 130
sick soldier aboard. Captain Thompson,
the assistant chief quartermaster of thÂ«
department, stated yesterday that he had
made all the necessary arrangements to
transport the sick from the Presidio dock
to the Division Hospital. This will be
a short move for them, and can be made
with more convenience than if the men
were landed at the down town dock. Two
sets of barracks have been made vacant
for the use of these sick soldiers.
No women nurses will be allowed to
accompany the troops to Manila. This
has been definitely decided upon by the
army authorities, who will see that their
will is enforced. The Secretary of War
alone will have the power in future to
grant an order which will permit any of
the gentler sex from accompanying
troops on transports. The rule thus made
does not effect nurses only, as the wives
of commanding officers, should they de
sire to accompany their husbands, must
do so on the regular passenger steamers,
unless they are favored by the Secretary
of War. Conduct which created much
gossip on the part of the nurses on the
Arizona is what has caused the order to
be made. The officials do not make this,
however, a particular ground for divorc
ing women from the hospital department,
but say that the service Is better without
The' War Department has notified Colo
nel Long, authorizing the expenditure of
such money as may be necessary to fix |
up the Tacoma for the purpose of making
another attempt to transport horses to
Manila. It Is understood that First Lieu
tenant John O'Shea. Fourth Cavalry,
whose troop is now at Manila, will be put
in charge of the Tacoma. The vessel and
all Government property aboard of her
has already been turned over to Lieuten
ant O'Shea.
Major Field, Second Artillery, who has
been weeding out the undesirable soldiers
of the Tennessee Regiment, has about
completed his work. The majority of
these men will be mustered out upon the
charge of physical disability. It Is esti
mated that the â  number of men thus
dropped will be slightly In excess of one
hundred. They constitute the disturbing
element which has so often brought the
regiment Into ill-respute. The War De
partment will be petitioned to allow the
regiment to recruit up to its maximum
strength.
Private C. B. Eshelmen, Company M.
First Washington Regiment, who was
tried by a general court martial upon the
charge of larceny, was acquitted and hna
been ordered released from confinement
and ordered to report to his company
commander for duty.

Division Hospital late on Friday night.
His remains have been sent to his home

HIS LIFE CRUSHED OUT.
Clarence Dunn, a Six- Year Old Boy,
Tails Off a Truck With Fatal
Results.
Clarence Dunn, a bright boy 6 years of
age, was a victim yesterday afternoon to
the habit of boys jumping on trucks
while being driven along the streets.
About 1 o'clock he and some other boys
jumped on the rear end of a truck that
was being driven across Fourth street
at Perry by Harry Smith, a teamster for
McNab & Smith. The boy fell off the
side of the truck and the hind wheel
passed over his head, crushing his skull
so that the brains oozed out. Smitn's at
tention waa called to the boy, and he
stopped his team and went back to where
the boy was lying. The sight sickened
him and he could do nothing.
A crowd soon gathered, and a man who
was passing in his buggy picked up the
boy and drove him in the direction of the
Receiving Hospital. The ambulance had
been summoned, and on its way met the
buggy, and the unconscious boy was
transferred to the ambulance.
At the Receiving Hospital Dr. Bunnell
found that the boy had sustained a com
pound comminuted fracture of the skull
and could not live many minutes. He

AID WOULD BE WELCOMED.
The Mother of Willie Lynch in Need
of Assistance â He Was the
Family's Breadwinner.
Mrs. Lynch, mother of little Willie
Lynch, the boy whose skull was fractured
by Policeman Kenville's club three weeks
ago, Is having a difficult time trying to
provide for her family of children and
take care of Willie at the same time.
The effects of the blow are such as to
change the child from a bright boy of
10 to one with the mentality of a baby
and with all the peevishness of an ailing
infant.
Willie and his elder brother were the
bread winners of the family, and since
Willie was injured the elder boy has also
taken ill, and the result is that the fam
ily is , *,n, n , straitene d circumstances.
There is little or nothing- in their home
at 166 Clara street, and were it not for
the kindness of a few who have interest
ed themselves in the family there would
be nothing to eat In the house. The aid
of charitably inclined people would not be
misplaced if it were bestowed upon the
suffering family. Mrs. Lynch thinks,
since the present condition was cau.sed
by a man in the employ of the city it
would not be amiss ("or the people' to
help her throuK" her trouble.

LEGAL FIGHT
OVER LIGHTING
PRIVILEGES
It Is Promised During
This Week.
COMPANIES LOCK HORNS
CITY CONTRACT FOR LIGHTING
TO BE CONTESTED.
Mutual Company Will Seek to En
join the Gas and Electric Com
pany From Collecting
City Bills.
There Is a hot legal flght In prospect
between the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company and its new rival, the
Mutual Electric Company. The latter
will try to prevent the payment to the
first named company of any money un
der the recently executed street lighting
contract, claiming that the same is
void by reason of frauds in the award.
In case the Supervisors next Monday
pass over the Mayor's veto a resolution
ordering the $24,000 September bills of
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany to be paid, the opposing company
will sue for an injunction in court to
restrain Auditor Broderlck from approv
ing the demand.
Such was the statement made to the
Auditor yesterday by W. K. Summer
| hayes, vice president and general man
ager of the Mutual Electric Light Com
pany. He called at the Auditor's office
in the afternoon and asked that the pay
ment of the 524,000 be held up, if ordered
by the Supervisors, until his company
could Institute the necessary legal pro
ceedings to have the contract declared
valueless. Mr. Summerhayes was In
formed that his request would be granted
for a period of ten days. In stating his
position in the matter the Auditor de
clared that he was not the proper per
son to say whether or not the $24,000
should eventually be paid, the law pro
viding that when a bill is allowed over the
Mayor's veto that fact constituted a le
gal warrant for the payment of the same.
Nevertheless, he was inclined to give the
Mutual Company a chance to prove its
case, if it could, but would grant no sus
pension of approval of the bills longer
than ten days, which would give ample
time for the tiling of an injunction suit
against him. Mr. Summerhayes assured
Mr. Broderiok that the company was in
earnest, stating that it proposed to do
everything in its power to have the new
lighting contract declared void and thus
secure another chance to enter the field
as a competitor. He declared that the
action of the Supervisors in preventing
the Mutual Company from erecting poles
for a competing gas and electric sys
tem transgressed the law by making
competitive bids impossible.
The programme, as outlined, is about
as follows: On next Monday the Super
visors will appropriate, over the Mayor's
veto, the $24,000 for the September gas
bills. The demand on the Treasurer will
then be sent to Auditor Broderick, who
will hold it up.
On Tuesday the injunction proceed
ings against the Auditor will be com
menced by the Mutual Company and then
the whole matter will be settled in court.
It will be recalled that Mayor Phelan,
in his second veto message, recently sent
to the Supervisors, claimed that the
lighting contract was not only illegal but
objectionable, inasmuch as it would make
the city pay $40,000 more for lighting than
If the competing company were Â©.warded
the contract, while the citizens would
suffer to the extent of an added $100,000
on private Illuminating bills. The Mayor
disputed Supervisor Rottanzi's right to
cast the deciding vote in overthrowing
his first veto when it was sent to the
board.
At the time when the veto was over
ruled there were flying charges in the air
that one Supervisor had received $20,000
for his vote, but no investigation of the
reports were instituted by the board. It
is quite possible that this phase of the
matter will receive an airing in the courts
during the hearing of the petition for an
injunction.
MUSTERING IN NEW
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN
REORGANIZATION OF CITIZEN
SOLDIERY COMMENCES.
Eighteen Companies in the Second
and Seven in the Third Brigade.
New Cavalry Troop.
The machinery for the reorganization
of the National Guard of the State of Cali
fornia has finally been set in motion, and
it Is probable that the first companies of
tho new organization will be mustered in
within the next two weeks. The first
step to that end was the issuance, some
clays since, of the following order from
division headquarters:
Brigadier General R. H. Warfleld command-
Ing the Second llrlgade, N. G. C, Is hereby
directed. In accordance with the decision of
the Board of Location and Organization, to
muster in In hie brigade not exceeding eigh
teen new companies In lieu of those which are
now In the volunteer service. Preference will
be Riven t<-> the localities from which these
cnmpanlrs hnve entered the service. Should
: ny locality from which a company has entered
the service neglect or not desire to form a new
company, applications from other places can
be consi.lerpil.
There 13 no doubt as to any men coming into
the guard through these new companies, who
have already served or are still In the service,
not having been discharged, that their time
will count Just as if there had never been any
volunteering and if. as the result of a {physi
cal examination, men have to be discharged
by reason of physical disability. It Is believed
that proper legislative action can be had at the
coming session of the Legislature to protect
them fully. By command of
MAJOR GENERAL. DICKINSON.
L. S. SCHMITT, Major and Aid.
Upon receipt of the above special order
Brigadier General Warfleld issued general
order No. 5. which reads:
In accordance with directions contained in
orders No. 27, current series. Division
Headquarters, the following detail Is hereby
made for the organization and mustering in of
not exceeding eighteen new companies In the
Second Brigade. N. G. C. In lieu of those com
panies now in the United States Volunteer ser
vice.
Major Charles Jansen. Inspector: Major H. A.

Junior Ev^nt for Two- Year-Olds Won

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 15.â The closing
day of the race meet attracted a crowd
of about 2500 people to Agricultural
Park. The harness events were dull
and listless affairs, and it remained for
the runners to create some show of real
enthusiasm. Of five favorites that car
ried the public's money Joe Wheeler,
the black pacer, was the only disap
pointment and this coin was saved by
the judges declaring all bets off. Head
water, La Goleta and Lady Ashley car
ried away the running purses.
Lady Margaret, a diminutive bit of
racing machinery possessed of the lat
eral gait, was a pronounced favorite
for the special pace and disposed of her
fit-Id in impressive fashion after a mis
hap to her harness had caused the little
miss to finish last in the third heat.

cult to find a rule to fit the occasion.

Won easily. Second and third driving. Winner, Crane
whelming victory in their game with the
Stanford freshmen to-day. The score was
IS to 0. There was a fair attendance ana
at no time did interest lag. .
The game was stubbornly contested or
both sides, yet the Jesuit was scarcely
ever in doubt from The time when Mc-
Quade went through center for the first
touchdown until Garnot v had placed the
ball safely behind the Stanford goal in
the second half, after having made a
6P Sa^a d Clar n a started off with a rush and
in less than five minutes a touchdown was
scored. They kept up their fast pace and
a few moments later Captain Coward by
a very clever fake pass, took the ball and
shot over the line for a second touchdown
Not content with this. Santa Clara plajed
desperately and when time was called for
the first half had the ball on Stanford
fl With rd a li "core of 12 to 0 facing them
Stanford started in the second half with
a determination which was indeed admir
able to witness. That the.ir efforts were
rewarded is easily seen by the fact that
their opponents scored only once in this
half, while Stanford came dangerously
near Santa Clara's goal several times.
Stanford was outplayed, but at no time
did her men grow careless.
The playing of Santa Clara was a big
improvement over the recent form shown
by that team, but for v individual work
Captain Coward easily carried off the
honors. The players and the positions of
the elevens were:
Santa Clara. Position. Stanford.

NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The National
League ball season closed to-day, and
Boston again won the pennant. The ma
jority of the team managers have noth
ing but tales of woe to tell. There are
three notable exceptionsâ Boston, Chicago
and Cincinnati. These are away ahead
financially, but the presidents refuse to
state the exact amount of their profits.
The rest of the clubs declare that the
war almost ruined them, and add that
they expect next season to be a good uiie
forthe national game.
One of the heaviest losers is New \nrk,
Neither President Freedman nor Treas
urer McCall will discuss the disastrous
showing made by the Giants, but a man
who is pretty close to both of them
stated that the losses will amount to not
less than $50,000. The attendance at the
Polo grounds was the smallest by far
ever known in New York, and the man
agement claims that the war had mm h
to do with it. while the local press insists
that the real cause ' vas the rowdyism
that was permitted.
Brooklyn had not such an expensive
team as Manhattan, but its losses are
almost as great. Visiting teams invaria
bly fared badly there.
BALTIMORE. Oct. 15.â Boston and Baltimore
â wound up the championship of ISSS to-day In a
slugging contest. The Champions should have
m-i but flVided poorly. Three Innings of the

TURFITES ASTOUNDED BY
SLOAN'S PERFORMANCES
LONDON, October 15.â Tod Sloan's per
formances at Newmarket have astounded
turfites and have created consternation
among the bookmakers. The Daily Tele
graph says:
"There never was such a rage for a
jockey's mounts. Sloan is the hero of the
day and is a positive attraction at every
meeting 1 he patronizes. Already special
wires announce when Sloan does not ride,
which, we do not suppose, was ever sup
plied to any other jockey under similar
circumstances. We shall soon hear of a
bookmakers' protective association for the
purpose of preventing speculators backing
Sloan's mounts."
Dr. Darwin Mcllwraith and Mrs. Mc-
Ilwraith, the Chicago bicyclists, who re
cently completed a tour of the world,
covering 30,000 miles, embarked for home
to-day on board the steamer Pennland,
after' an absence of three and a half
years. They are both in the best of
health and spirits, and are apparently
none- the worse for the hardships which
they endured. The hardships included
Dr. Mcllwraith's amputation of his wife's
toes, which were frostbitten while cross
ing Persia. It is said that the entire cost
of their trip was 130,000. and it is claimed
that they rode throughout on the ma
chines which they had when they left
Chicago, and finally, it is asserted, they
had only used three sets of tires.

ROWING CONTESTS
ON LAKE BOHEMIA
Openingof Guerneville's
Regatta.
FIVE EVENTS ON THE WATER
PIONEERS VICTORIOUS IN THE
BARGE RACE.
Ochs Finishes First in the Senior
Skiff and Keenan Wins the
Dash, for Shells From
Phelan.
Bpeciat Dispatch to The Call.
GUERNEVILLE, Oct. 15.â The first
regatta ever held here took place to
day on Lake Bohemia, about three
miles from Guerneville. The course is
formed by damming the water of the
river into a lake about one and a quar
ter miles long and wide enough to ad
mit three barges rowing abreast. The
lake has on each side high banks
sloping to the water's edge for a con
siderable distance. The bushes on the
bank have been cut down to make
room for a grandstand and open-air
restaurant and other resorts for the
oarsmen and spectators.
oarsmen and spectators.
The opening event of the senior skiff
race brought out three contestants.
Dr. C. C. Dennis of the South Ends.
C. Ochs of the Pioneers, and Frank
Wilson of the Ariels. G. Ochs won
easily by three lengths, Dr. C. P. Den
nis was second and F. Wilson third.
The second event was a shell race,
there being two contestants,. Thomas
Keenan of the Dolphins and George W.
Phelan of the Ariels. After a close
race, in which Phelan was somewhat
obstructed by a launch, Keenan won
by half a length.
The third was a four-oared barge
race between the crews of the Pio
neers, Ariels and South Ends. Only
two of the South Ends having arrived,
two Dolphin men took their places. The
four men had never sat in a boat to
gether and did not even row the same
kind of a stroke, so victory was in
possible, but they started off at a good
lead and kept it up for some distance.
The Ariels passed them, but were grad
ually overhauled by the Pioneers, who
beat the Ariels by three lengths and
the South Ends by a considerably
greater distance. The Ariels rowed a
plucky race, but were handicapped by
a leaky boat.
The Pioneer barge crew was as fol
lows: H. Wilder, bow; F. O'Neil, No. 2;
G. Lawson, No. 3; E. House, cockswain.
The Ariel's racing crew included: H.
Wilson, bow; F. Wilson, No. 2; J. Mc-
Kcnna, No. 3; J. Wilson, stroke; Roy
West, cockswain.
The South End's crew: E. Shortall,
bow; F. Schwarting, No. 2; Victor Cag
lieri of the Dolphins, No. 3; P. J. Fitz
patrick (South Ends), stroke; E. Parb
man (Dolphins), cockswain.
The fourth event, a canoe race be
tween Victor Caglieri of the Dolphins
and P. Ochs of the Pioneers, was won
by Victor. The two canoers then
amused the spectators by trying to get
into the kyacks from the water. Time
after time they climbed into the frail
craft and rolled over into the water,
much to the delight of the spectators.

NEWTON GIVES YALE
SOMETHING TO DO
NEWTON, Mass., Oct. 15.â 1n a short
but fierce game to-day Yale managed to
score once on Newton, principally
through an off-side play on the part of
Newton and one or two sharp rushes
by the Yale backs through Newton's
center. The visitors were utterly un
able to get within twenty-five yards of the
Newton goal line in the first half, while
the home team tore the Yale line apart
for frequent goals. After that Yale
braced up and the goal was never in dan
ger during the second half. Score â Yale
6, Newton 0.
ANNAPOLIS, Md.. Oct. 16.â While the

half. In the second half the same condi

STANFORD TRYING OUT
ATHLETIC MATERIAL
STANFORD, Oct. 15.â An impromptu
field day was held here this afternoon.
The track was slow and no official time
was kept. There seemed to be a lack of
new material; yet this early in the year
it is impossible to form a correct ; esti
mate of the '02 class.
Of the new men Prall, Chadbourne and
Jones showed up the best. Prall comes
from lowa with a very creditable record
in the short distances. Chadbourne hails
from Pasadena, and, while lacking ex
perience, gives promise of becoming a
fast man in the sprints. Jones is a San
Jose lad, and came in a close second in
a half-mlie walk, Lowsley beating him.
Stewart, who was on a track last year
for the first time and who developed
rapidly the latter part of the season, won
the 100-yard dash, and will no doubt
make fast time before the season is over.
Stewart won the quarter in apparently
fast time. Chadbourne came in a close
second. The broad jump was won by
Simms â twenty-one feet. Boyd won the
high jump. He showed good form, and
will be a valuable man in this event. In
the mile Captain Smith and Norris came
in on a dead heat in rather slow time.

HEARST DEPOSED

No Longer Controls the
Two Newspapers.
WANTS A SILVER ORGAN
INTERESTED IN A NEW ENTER
PRISE AT CHICAGO.
Altgeld and Others Associated With
the Man Who Made a Failure
at San Francisco and
New York.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, Oct. 15.- That this city
may have another great daily seems
now to be one of the probabilities. A
conference was held at ex-Governor's
Altgeld's office to-day, which was said
to have in view the establishment of a
free coinage silver newspaper in Chi
cago.
At the conference were "Coin" Har
vey, Mr. Altgeld, George Fred Williams
of Boston, Democratic candidate for
Governor of Massachusetts two years
ago, Willis J. Abbott and William R.
Hearst.
Mr. Hearst Is said to be no longer in
control of the New York Journal and
the San Francisco Examiner, the trus
tees of the Hearst estate having taken
them in charge, and he is reported to be
anxious to get control of a newspaper
in Chicago. Whether they will purchase
a plant or establish a new one was said
to be one of the objects of to-day's
conference.
Since the close of the Presidential
campaign Mr. Altgeld is reported to
have been desirous of having control of
a silver organ in Chicago. Two years
ago Mr. Hearst was asked to estabhsn
such a journal and make Mr. Altgeld
editor in chief. It is said negotiations
along this line were nearing conclusion
when Mr. Altgeld's health broke down
and he was compelled to give up h\s
ambition to direct the destiny of a sil
ver organ.
Since his restoration to health the
talk of a silver paper for Chicago has
been renewed, and Mr. Hearst and Mr.
Abbott have been in Chicago several
days looking over the ground.
Mr Williams is said to be interested
financially in the enterprise. Eastern
capital is to be interested by him. Mr.
Harvey will be closely connected with
the management of the organ. It 13
said he will represent Mr. Altgeld in
the active management of the paper,
as the Ac-Governor does not desire to
do more than outline its policy.
Mr. Abbott until a few weeks ago
was editor-in-chief of the New York
Journal. Before going to New York
he was the first managing editor of
the old Chicago Times, now merged in
the Times-Herald, then controlled by
the present Mayor Carter H. Harrison.
At one time he was editor of the Kan
sas City Times, and taken all together
has had a variety of newspaper ex
periences.
Mr. Hearst to-day would neither
affirm nor deny the statement that he
had been deposed from the control of
the newspaper properties with which
his name has hitherto been associated.ELOPEMENT OF

"Mr: Large and Barclay were going

In Louis Ezell's string are Kamsin,
Personne, Yorick, Octuruck, Reno, Don't
Tell, Leo Vertner and several other un
named ones.
J. A. Grey, the man who took Hermoso
and others to Chicago this summer, ar
rived in town a few days ago and reports
everything as thriving in racing circles
around the "Windy City." He says that
from the outlook when he left Chicago
quite a number of new owners will jour
ney to the Golden State this winter. Per
haps the most prominent of the owners
whose faces are strange to California are
Uuke & Wishard. This firm is well known
to turf followers as the men who raced
with such success in England. They took
Hamapo, Helen Nichols, Hugh Penny and
other celebrated American horses across
the water a couple of years ago, and,
though they did not create the anticipat
ed splurge, they managed to pay expenses
and dispose of their horses for good
prices to the Britishers. They will, in all
probability, ship a carload of their best
ones here this winter, among which num
ber are Hugh Penny, a winner on Eng
lish tracks; Mary Black, Doremus and
other crackerjacks. Mary Black is on.-
of the fastest sprinters racing In -the
Middle West, and is equally good In the
mud or on a dry track. Doremus is a
high-class selling-plater, and handles
weight well and runs all distances.
Johnnie Rein*, whom the Chicago news
papers have given the sobriquet of the
"Midget Jockey," will come out with
Duke & Wishard. According to reports
and newspaper criticisms this boy is one
of the greatest riders seen in many a
day. He Is scarcely 14 years old and rides
at less than sixty pounds. Many predict
th,at he is a second Sloan, but one thing: Is
sureâ he is the most popular jockey rid
ing in the Middle West.
Dr. Kyle, whose colors have never ap
peared on a California track, will prob
ably ship five or six to California this
winter.
Pat Dunne will ship a carload of new
ones here In a week or two. In his string
are the cracks Pink Coat, Dave Tenny
and others. The first named will be re
membered as the winner of the Ameri
can Derby at Washington Park this sum
mer, it being worth nearly $15,000. Dave
Tenny ran a mile and a quarter in 2:04 I ,i,
and will be a contender in some of the
largo stakes this winter.
About the same bookmakers that were
here last year will cut in this winter.
George Rose has the field book privilege
He also had the same privilege at the
Chicago tracks this summer, it is re
ported that Rose is quite a winner on the
season.
Sam Hildreth will probably have the
most formidable stable here this winter
for he is gathering together one of the
finest strings that ever left New York
He has been the most successful trainer
that has crossed the Rockies in many a
day, and his horses are winning races
with wonderful consistency on the Board
of- Control tracks.
Harry Kahlmann, well known to local
turfites as the one-legged plunger, has
had a very successful year in the East,
and has purchased eight horses, the most
prominent of which Is Miss Tenny, by
the renowned Swayback Tenny. Kahl
mann's colors will be seen for the first
time In California this winter.
CURIOSITIES OF THE CALENDAR
There are some curious facts that
have lately been noted about the cal*
endar. No century can begin on Wed
nesday, Friday or Sunday. The same
calendars can be used every twenty
years. October always begins on the
same day of the week as January;
April as July; March and November
begin on the same days. May, June
and August always begin on different
days from each other, and every month
in the year. The first and the last
days of the year are always the same.
These rules do not apply to leap year,
when comparison Is between days be
fore and after February 29. {

on a Sandbar.
CLOSE CALL FOR THE JEANIE
STEAMER SOUTH PORTLAND
RUNS INTO A WHARF.
A Leak on the American Bark Hollis
wood That Has Caused Trouble
and Loss for Over
Pive Years.
The Pacific Stpam "Whaling: Company's
tender Jeanle arrived in port yesterday
ifter a most eventful voyage. Since leav
ing here on July 1, 1897, she has been
caught in the ice and compelled to re
main all winter In the Arctic, while, after
escaping that danger, she was nearly
wrecked in McLeod's Bay, Alaska. The
crew, as a whole, are Jubilant. They
have frot over their hardships in the
frozen north and are now basking in the
expectation of payday. Every man aboard
has over fifteen months' salary coming to
him. and many a Jackie among them will
receive more money than he ever handled
at one time in his life. The least any one
of them will receive will be $500, po there
will be lively times on the front when that
vessel is paid off.
The Jeanie left here with supplies for
the whalers that were to winter off the
mouth of the Mackeryie River. She also
took up about sixty men, who were to
supply the places of the sailors coming
home. The supplies were delivered, the
men transferred, and the tender was on
her way back to San Francisco when she
was caught In the ice off Point Barrow.
Every effort was made to get out of the
pack, but It failed, and the Jpanie had
to remain In the Ice for nearly a year.
When the ico broke up she had a parrow
escape of being crushed to pieces, but
finally got clear and steamed away for
the canneries.
Captain Mason's report of her next
trouble Is as follows: "On September 22
at 5 p.-m. while going: into McLeod's Bay
(west Bide of Montague Island) the
steamer went ashore, fone got on a sand
bar and hung there. The tide was fall
ing and as it left the vessel she strained
badly. She hung In the centor, and, BO
far as I could Bee, all the scarps and
butts were started by the strain. The
engine and boner settled aft, the smoke
stack broke and the steamer was badly
hogged. We lay in that position for
twenty-four houis and then we got her
oft. On trying the pumps I found the
steamer was not making any mure water
than usual, so we took on board 16,000
cases of salmon for Ban Francisco.
"After getting off the Band bar and Into
a safe anchorage the Jeanlu rode out one
of the heaviest storms I have ever beer
in."
The Jeanie has gone to the Arctic Oil
Works to discharge, and will then go on
the drydock for an overhauling.
Captain Seeley of the steamer South
Portland is playing In hard luck. About
a week ago he was fined $200 for not an
swtrlng the signal of the revenue cutter
Rush, and now he has run his vessel into
the wharf at Tacoma. The vesse! left here
on the 10th inst., and only reached Ta
coma to-day. While docking she struck
the wharf with such force as to wreck
it. Her own partitions and bulkheads
were broken, and a plate on the star
board bow was so bent that it will have
to be replaced. It will cost $1000 to re
pair the wharf and $5000 to repair the
steamer. The South Portland came out
here from the Kaet to go into the Klon
dike trade, but when the bottom fell out
of the boom she was turned into a freight
boat, and has been carrying wheat from
Tacoma to San Francisco for a month
past.
The steamer Aztec arrived from the
Orient yesterday, after a long passage.
She was to have come here from Japan
direct, but on her arrival at Yokohama
there were 719 contract Japanese laborers
bound for the cane fields of Hawaii await
ing her. These she took aboard and
landed at Honolulu. The United States
cruiser Baltimore got Into Hongkong from
Manila as the Aztec was leaving. She
was to take the place of the Boston on the
drydock, the latter vessel being ready to
start for the Philippines.
Commodore Kautz is now in command
of the Pacific Coast station. Yesterday
Rear Admiral Miller's flap was hauled
down from the cruiser Philadelphia and
the commodore's run up. The customary
salutes were given during the ceremony.
The British ship Wayfarer, now laid
up at Sausalito, is a good example of the
fluctuations in the wheat market. When
she arrived here last May her owners re
fused a 35 shilling charter. Now they
cannot pet better than 25 shillings, and
the vessel will r<m;iin tied up at Sausa
lito until wheat takes another jump.
The American bark Holiiswood made a
long passage of eighty-one days from
Newcastle, N. B. W. Although an 1100-ton
i she only brought 1423 tons of coal
over in h^r hold. When loaded over the
twenty-foot mark she leaks at a great
rate and the pumps can barely keep her
clear She was built in 1593, and has car
ried that defect with her since she went
into commission. Bvery time she goes on
the drydook a search Is made for the
leak, but it cannot be found, and prob
ably never will be. During the run from
Australia the Holiiswood was in light and
baffling winds for eleven days, and for
nin.- more was in a dead calm.
Tl c Mail steamer Aztec brought from
Hongkong a very valuable cargo of silks
and teas and from Japan $250,000 in gold
and half a million In silver yen.

JUDGE KERRIGAN IS
WATCHED BY FRIENDS
WHEELMEN MAKE HIM A BEAU
TIFUL PRESENTATION.
A Diamond-Studded Watch Fob From
the Members of the Bay-
City Club.
Judge Frank H. Kerrigan was present
ed -with a beautiful souvenir by the mem
bers of the Bay City Wheelmen last even
ing, in recognition of his four years' faith
ful service to the club as president.
The token is a watch fob, studded with
diamonds, in the form of a Maltese Cross,
ihe emblem of the club. On the revers-3
side these words are inscribed:
"Presented to F. H. Kerrigan by the
members of the Bay City Wheelmen, Oc
tober la, 1&98."
Last night was an occasion of much
jollity at the clubhouse on Golden Gate
avenue near Polk street, and about luO
members and as many more of their
friends assembled to enjoy the first
â¢smoker" given by the new board of di
rectors.
Rumors had been rife for several days
past that preparations were being made
for a "hot time," and in this respect the
members were not disappointed, as tho
entertainment was above the average.
The amusement commenced early, Pres
ident Fahrbach presenting In turn tho fol
lowing well-known entertainers, who were
warmly received. Frank Thompson, Ben
Tarbox. Gus Creamer. Flelssner's orches
tra. Will Finnic, Jack Cathcart. Kelly and
Marlowe, Jack Cooney. "Bob" Mitchell,
Jack O'Brien and several others who
came late.
The presentation to Judge Kerrigan
came in the middle of the evening when
the festivities were at their height. Dan
O'Callaghan called the Judge to the front
on a slight pretext, and held him there.
while in a few well-chosen words he told
him and the assembled guests that the
club, deeply appreciating the Judge's
valuable services during the past four
years of his presidency, proffered him a
small token of the members' esteem and
good will.
Judge Kerrigan's surprise and feelings
may well be imagined and Jt took him
some moments to frame a reply, thank
ing the members for their thoughtfulness
and generosity.
The meeting broke up at a late hour
with cheers for Judge Kerrigan and his
candidacy for Justice of the Peace.

DOGS COURSE
THREE MILES
AFTER A HARE
Interesting Sport at
Union Park.
THE HOUNDS HAD TO QUIT
EMIN PASHA AND SIR JOHN
ABNOi PUMPED OUT. -
Victor King Gave Hadiwist a Close
Bun, but the Old Dog Fav
ored by che Hare
Won.
Sir John Amot and Emln Pasha will
feel for some time the effects of a course
they had yesterday at Union Park. The
hare, which was one of Merced's hound
killers, ran the dogs up and down the
field opposite the slipping ground until
Sir John reluctantly dropped his head and
leaned against the fence to support his
exhausted anatomy. His opponent Emm
Pasha continued after his game, passing
the grand stand in a lope. Emm's hand
ler followed, and not being sufficiently
epry of limb to overtake the dog, three
or four fresh hounds were cast off and
the game little hare was soon dispatched.
Emm scored several points before Sir
John got in, but the white dog rapidly
closed the gap and was having a good
lead in points at the time he was struck
with that tired feeling which frequently
occurs to dogs when they are "exercised"
on the plains of Merced.
The first course of the day was a com
plete surprise to the players of the' long
end. Quiver sold at $1 as against $8 on
Gilt Edge, but the last-named "flyer" quit
running after having scored the first turn
to a long lead up to game. Quiver, then
got in and held first place to the finish.
Hot Stuff defeated the favorite Montana
In a rather short course. One of the pret
tiest courses of the day was between
White Tip and Seldom. To a good hare
the dogs were carried the full length of
the field, White Tip winning with not
many points to spare. Lively betting re-
BUlted when Hadtwist and that grand
young dog, Victor King, were called to
the slips. Several dollars changed hands
at even money, but the old dog, favored by
the hare, proved too much for his young
opponent, although the King remained
right by his side up to the time the kill
was effected.
Ace of Clubs (late Blackstone) defeated
Vigilant, a prime favorite, and Crusader,
after a no course, won the flag of suc
cess from Minneapolis. Minneapolis was
a strong favorite at $6 to $1 and In the
final course she also was played well at
odds of $2*4 and $3 to $1, but she never
scored, as the hare was a poor performer,
and Crusader, who led to game, scored
the first turn and kill.
Ida beat Green Valley Maid, a $3 to $1
shot, and Bendigo, after a no course, eas
ily disposed of Winged Foot.
In the final course of the rundown Chile
Pepper, selling at $1 against So. scored a
no course with White Lily. In the runoff
the last named dog won in a very pretty
course, just as darkness was setting in.
The winners and losers are as follows:
Reserve stake, 64 entries, the rundown-
Quiver beat Gilt Edge; Benfialons beat White
Wedge; Santa Alicia beat Jeuet; Hot Stuff beat
Montana! Sky Queen beat Hercules: Jennie
Wilson beat Van dole; Lissak beat Martyr:

Promise; Sharkey beat Victor; Morning Glory
beat Tic-Tac; Bendijjo beat Winged Foot; Black
Patti beat Faultless Beauty; White Lily beat
Chile Pepper.
Curtis & Sons lost by dlÃtemper on
Friday their promising puppy, Lygla.
There, will be great speculation un the
winner Vjf to-day's champion stake. Rock
Island Boy, if In good form, should givo
False Flatterer a hard run. Mountain
Beauty will doubtless dispose of Wait a
Uttle. To a good hareâ but it must be a
food one â Firm Friend should take a flag
rum Theron, and Right Bower, if he Is
not euchred by too much elixir of life,
should dispose of Royal Prize.
MARY X DEFEATED CONLEY.
The Game Little Hound Was In Fast
Company at Ingleside Yesterday
at Good Long Odds.
The lovers of coursing were treated
to a great day's sport at Ingleside Park
yesterday. There were some sensational
and extended competitions, among them
being a course between Mary X and L.
S. Conley, which resulted in a victory for
the former b;. the good score of 33 to 15.
The dogs ran four minutes and twenty
five seconds, when both auit from ex
treme exhaustion. The game little hare,
though greatly distressed, ran to the es
cape and will no doubt give some other
ambitious hounds a run shortly.
Silkwood and Philippine also made
things interesting for over three minutes,
but Silkwood killed In front of the grand
stand and won by a score of 36 to 24.
Counterfeit and Van Kirk ran a gruelling

A MEAN TRICK.
Weldon bought fourteen little round
clay banks, with slots fairly yawning for
pennies. These he intended to distribute
among the members of hi? Sunday school
class, after giving a little heart-to-heart
talk on frugality. As a "nest egg" he de
termined to put five pennies in each bank.
T'nfortunately, "Weldon took the globes to
the office. Lacey, who has no practical
ideas about anything but jokes, saw him
putting pennies in the slots and found
out through the stenographer to what use
the little banks were to be put. When
Weldon had gone to lunch Lacey hunted
about the stockroom and found some iron
washers about the size of pennies. 'With
the assistance of the office boy he shook
the coppers out of the globes and Inserted
the worthless bits of metal. The follow
ing Sunday, after Weldon had delivered
his talk and the bank*, fourteen children
rushed home and shook the iron washers
out on fourteen parlor carpets. The wails
that arose were heartrending and twenty
eight fathers and mothers indignantly de
clared that Weldon was not fit to hold
the position of instructor in the Sunday
school. Everybody in the churchâ save
Weldon â was informed. The greetings of.
old-time friends grew distant and formal.
Finally the Sunday school class was tak
en away from Weldon and put in the
hands of a young lady, who started by
asking the 10-year-olds if they had read
"Quo Vadls," and the worst of it all is
that Weldon doesn't know what has
brought him to the ground, a crumbling
pillar of the church.â Chicago Record.

PARNELL MEN
TO CELEBRATE
Anniversary of the Lead
er's Death Observed.
FEATURES OF DEMONSTRATION
FIRST THERE WILL BE A BIG
PARADE IN DUBLIN.
Following Conies the Convention to
determine the Policy of the In

Party.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
DUBLIN, Oct. I.â For the last seven
years the chief political event of the
autumn in Ireland has been the celebra
tion of the Pnrnell anniversaryâ tnat is.
the anniversary of iht- death of the great
Irish loader, on the 6th of October. VSSi.
The celebration does nut take place on
the 6th of October, however, unless it be
a Sunday, for Sunday Is the only day of
the week in which people generally,
â¢whether in Dublin or in the provinces,
can attend it. But the 6th of October,
whether it fall on a Sunday or not, is
now known as Ivy day, from the fact
that the ivy leaf has been worn on that
day ever since 1891 by all Parnellites,
both in Dublin and the provinces. How
it is that the ivy has come to be particu
larly associated with Parneli 1 cannot
tell. Already there are different theories
on the subject current, although it is
only a few years since Ivy da\ was in
augurated. Bo difficult is it to come at
the truth of things which occur even
within one's own experience! On this oc
casion, as Ivy day will fall on Thursday,
the annual demonstration will take place
on the lmh, the nearest Sunday, and the
preparations for it are now in an ad
vanced stage. All the railways running
into Dublin have arranged 10 tarry pas
sengers for that daj at excursion fares.
The public local bodies In the various
towns have a^jret-d to send deputations,
and some of the larger municipalities
will, us usual, be represented by their
Mayors and municipal officers in their
rooes, as will also the Corporation of
Dublin, which has. moreover, authorized
the City 1- ire Brigade u> attend in state
in their full workiny uniforms with their
traps and engines. The trades vi the city
are also to participate in the procession,
in which places have been assigned to
them and to the provincial deputations
by ballot. The demonstrations which
have already taktii place this year m
honor of "The -Men oil '98" may to some
extent Interfere with the attendance oil
many from a distance who have always !
himerto taken part in vie Pnrnell anni
versary celebration, for It would i>e un- ,
reasonable to expect all such persons to
come up to Dublin from remote p
twice within a few months; but, ail the
same, the demonstration is certain to be
large and impressive.
Tne usual programme is to have a pro- I
cession through the principal streets of
Dublin to Glennevin Cemetery, where j
Parnell was buried, and then to disperse
for the day, the leading Parnellites re
assembling on the following day tv dis
cuss in convention the political situation |
and to determine the policy of the Inde- \
pendent Nationalist party tor the coming I
year. This year, ot course, the same
programme will be followed. The pro
cession will take place, as I have said,
on the 9th inst., and the convention will
be held the following day. At this gath
ering the principal subject will this time
be tne attitude to be taken up by Par
nellites in reference to the elections for
the new* councils established by the local
government act of the last session of
Parliament. "What will be determined on
I cannot, of course, say: but the probable
decision of the convention is clear enough.
The Independent Nationalist party, under
the leadership of John Redmond, M. P.,
has already made it ci>-ar that it does
not want the complete boycotting of the j
minority. It has always insisted on the
expediency of giving that minority a fair
representation on the new elective bodies.
It desires to see that minority fully, eyeD
fenerously, represented. But, as far as '
know, it means to use those new bodies i
as aids to the obtaining of home rule, and
for that purpose it is essential that they
should everywhere contain a majority of
Nationalists. It is one thing, and a right
thing, to accord the minority full repre
sentation; it is another and, while home
rule Is denied, it would be an unjustifiable
thing to give them the controlling power j
in places where they are not entitled to it |
by their numbers; and this, to put it brief
ly, will be, as I imagine, the declaration
of the Independent Nationalist Conven- I
tion. Another point that is likely to be
insisted upon is absolute freedom of elec
tion. The history of some past Parlia
mentary elections in recent years is the
foundation of this plank in the platform. ]
and those who remember the history of
those elections are the strongest in urg
ing thi6 particular demand. I may add
that the proceedings of the convention are
looked forward to with grÂ°at interest not
only by Parnellltes, but by anti-Parnell
ites, for every one recognizes now that,
although the Parnelllte members of Par
liament are but twelve out of eighty Na
tionalist members, they represent a far
larger proportion of people in Ireland than
that figure would imply.
I have just returned from a trip on
the new tourist route, commonly called
the Duke of Tork route, on the Shannon.
It was a most enjoyable excursion, and I
should most strongly advise any Ameri
can visitors who may come to Ireland
next summer not to miss it. The way to
proceed is this: Take a ticket from the
Broadstone station (Dublin) of the Mid
land line of railway to Athlone. That
particular Journey occupies, by a fast
train, only some two hours and three
quarters. If you arrive in the morning !
you can walk almost straight from the '
train into the steamer, which leaves Ath
lone at 10 a. m. for Killaloe. You
spend the next seven hours sind a half
on the river, at the end of which time
you can, if you are in a hurry, resume
your Journey by train for Limerick, ar
riving, via that city, in Dublin the fol
lowing morning- at 5 o'clock. Rut, in all
probability, most visitors will be in no
hurry to get away from places naturally
so picturesque, and, to Irishmen, so full
of historical associations. The journey
down the Shannon from Athlone to Killa
loe appears all too short. For the first
fifteen milns, indeed, the scenery is not
out of the common. The great river flows
through a rather flat country, dotted for
miles and miles on either side with the
whitewashed houses of the peasantry,
embowered amid clumps of trees; arid
but for the innumerable curves of the
stream and the excessively green mead
ows that skirt the water's edge for miles
on both sides, the landscape would be
comparatively uninteresting. But when
you reach Portumr.a and enter In Lough
Derg the sight is as beautiful of its
kind as anything in the world. This great
lake is twenty-five miles long and in some
parts twenty miles wide. Bordered on
each side with waving woods, amid which
here and there peer out stately resi
dences or ivy-grown towers and other
relics of the past; studded with islands
rich In foliage, ecclesiastical remains of
remote ages, and in religious and histori
cal memories which still stir the blood of
the people; now bright with sunshine and
anon darkened with the clouds which
never seem entirely absent from that
enchanted regionâ it is a spot in which
the visitor, whether given to angling
shooting or more sight-seeing, would like
to tarry the whole summer through
One circumstance in particular will
strike the tourist in whose thoughts poll
tics are uppermost. It is that on the
western shores of Lough Derg are sit
uated many of the most notable scenes of
the last great land agitation. At and In
the neighborhood of Portumna was enact
edâana, in fact, to some extent Is Btill
being enactedâ the great struggle between
the Marquis of Clanricarde and his ten
antry. Lower down is "Woodford, the
scene of a hotter fight of fhe same kind,
and Bodyke, in the County Clare, the
story of the evictions in which, a few
years back, read like that of a miniature
frontier war of modern times. At Port
umna is a remarkable sight, to explain
â which a few preliminary worda are neceu-.
sary. Up to the year 1872 the two great
"county families" of Galwayâ the Burke*,
represented by the MarquiÃ of c ' a , n "
ricarde, and the Frenches, represented by
the Earl of Clanartyâ divided between
them the Parliamentary representation oi
I the vast county of Galway, a share in
which they seemed to regard as an ap
panage of their titles and estates. In IS7Z
the Clanricarde-Clancarty candidate was
beaten at the polls, even though the iran
chise was still unrestricted and the sys
tem of voting by ballot was not yet tne
law. From that day forward, so grea.t
was the disenchantment of the Marquis
of Clanricarde. the relations between him
and the county became altogether
changed. He lined his tenants to the
shape of an Increase of rents for paving

successor, the P present Marquis whose
first act on his accession was to stop the

The new building had been all but ftn

Nor are things likely to change during the
lifetime of tiie present owner of the Clan

life of a solitary recluse in "the Albany,
In London, without ever a thought, appar
ently, of his magnificent seat on the banks
of Lough Derg. What will happen when
the next owner comes into possession it is
difficult to conjecture, for, after a contin

ing a portion of which time it played a
conspicuous part in Irish history, the
riamicarde family will die out, in the
male line at least, with the present Mar

FOOTBALL GAMES AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
The latest athletic news from Stanford
University appears in the following let
ter to The Call:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct 15.â Last
week's practice on the gTidiron has been far
from encouraÃing. The men have been coming
on the field late, making It impossible to have
anything but a short line up. The snap, too,
of past week- has bven lacking in the play of
the football squad. The men have been slow in
lining up and fumbling has been worse than
ever To remedy this condition of affairs a
football meeting was called Wednesday. Coach
and Captain Fisher addressed the meet
ing urging the men to get out on the Held
more promptly and to play with more life
Coach Cress told of the methods at iale and
other Eastern colleges and summed up his po
sition in saying: "Every one must do his part;
no one can shirk and expect to remain on the
field." Erb, '01, was appointed captain of the
second eleven. As far as possible the same line
up will be kept on the second team In hopes of
developing a stronger eleven for the Varsity
to go up against.
With some few notable exceptions, the men
who are doing the most conscientious work on
the field are the old Varsity players, who in
most rases have a clr.uh on their positions.
Murphy Is punting in excellent form. Parker.
at end, got himself Into condition early and
already has the endurance and speed so neces
sary for the wings If the work of the -whole
team Is not to be retarded. Captain FUher,
though having the responsibility of the team
on his shoulders, la playing an excellent game.
A number of last year's second team are do-
Ing good work this year and in many respects
are almost up to Varsity fnrm. Wilson, at
tackle Is fast and always brings down his
man ' Rusk, at the other tackle. Is strong in
the line and semes to be able to break through
any one put against him at will. His great fall
ing Is in not watching the kicks. Other men
whose work is particularly noticeable are Bun
nister and Hill at full and McFadden end.
Hunnister hammers the line effectively and
keeps his feet well. Hill Is also strong at
bucking.
Among the new men who came out last
week are Longheed, last year's baseball cap
tain, for quarter, anji Eaton, a big freshman,
who' will try for a place In the center.
Training rules have been signed by the foot
ball candidates, and are aÂ« follows:
(1) To abstain from the use of all tobacco
and alcoholic liquors.
(2) To retire regularly not later than
10:30 p. m.
(3) To refrain from eatlni? between meals.
(4) To obey implicitly the commands of the
coaoh and captain while on the field and re
spond to the call for practice promptly.
Arrangements are being made for a train-
Ing table, which will be started this week with
a few of the most promising candidates. New
men will be put on as soon as they prove that
they deserve it.
The "baby" eleven has not been doing much
thiÃ week, as a number of the strong fresh
mr-n have been laid off on account of Injuries.

THE SOLDIER DEAD

DEPARTED HEROES HONORED
FIRST CALIFORNIA MOURNS ITS
LOSS.
In the Historic Church of San Miguel
Regimental Chaplain McKinnon
Preaches a Touching
Sermon.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA. Sept. 6.â Solemn mass was
said in the Church of San Miguel, near
the palace of Malakanan, this rrfocning,
I for the repose of the souls of the mem
bers of the First California Regiment
who laid down their Lives for their
country in this far-off land. Father
Doherty, General Merritt's chaplain,
was the celebrant and a most touching
sermon was preached by Father Mc-
Kinnon, chaplain of the regiment. It
was a most impressive scene, the quaint
old interior reminiscent in all its parts
of the appeal of the Spanish mission
aries to the senses of the savages, the
earnest faces of the American boys in
their brown fatigue suits, the
I solemn chanting of the priest,
the strong, clear boys' alto of the na
tive lads of whom Father McKinnon
j has constituted his choir. It was a
scene that those who looked upon will
never forget, and there was consolation
in it for those who had felt the sorrow
which must come to the soldier who
sees his comrade stricken down in bat
tle at his side. Certainly, never regi
ment had a better chaplain than Rev.
Father McKinnon. Faithful to every
' spiritual trust, he has periled his life to
go to the front when the lives of his
boys were in peril. He has been the
stay of the strong and the material
staff of. the weak. He has prayed for
the dead, watched by the sick and con
soled the living. He is a man without
fear and without reproach. As his pray
ers have been freely given, so will the
weaker petitions of every man who has
felt his ministrations ascend to the
: throne of grace on his behalf. It is
testimony which, though "humble, will
be heard at the last day.
And while the Americans keep watch
beside their dead there is growing a
new danger those in authority feel most
keenly. Aguinaldo is not yet ready to
take the fortunes of war, although they
turn against him. He is strengthening
himself in the Interior wherever that is
possible, and he has men of his own
in quarters in the suburb of Malate.
It is true that some of his leaders are
not true to him. Your real Tagallo is
true to nobody. He is, in extreme cases,
not even true to himself. Pio Pilar, for
example, would like to set up an army
and a revolution of his own. So would
Pa Ah, the Chinese leader, out at Ma
lalon. The annexation party, too,
among the natives is growing in
strength each day. Nevertheless Aguin
aldo is by far the ablest man of the
lot, and it is Just possible will be able
to hold the diverse elements together
until he has made his case before the
Paris commission. He wants, or says
he wants, a Filipino republic with an
American protectorate. That is a dream
the variety of which can be realized
only by those who have seen and stud
ied the Tagallo.
The American system Is a good sys
tem, by your leave, for Americans. You
cannot graft new systems upon the old
Asiatic trunk. It is too old, and the
sap runs too much evil. The graft is
poisoned and the tree lives on to poison
with its rank growth all the generations
that may ever be born upon this rich
though fetid soil. All this we know
who have been here. There is not an
American in the whole army of occupa
tion who will not tell you, If this land
is to be regenerated, the regeneration
must come from the rivers of blood to
follow the extermination of every na
tive in the islands. It is hardâ but re
generation is hard. America is strong
for the task, but there must be no
shrinking in the performance nor from
the consequences.

had be^n looking forward to a general re

MUST BEAR UNION LABEL.
Contract Relating to City Printing Is
Held to Be Constitutional.
KANSAS CITY, Oct. 15.â Judge Scarritt
of the Circuit Court has held that the or
dinance passed by the City Council last
spring making it obligatory that all city
printing bear the label of the Typographi
cal Union is constitutionally correct and
will stand the test of the courts.
Under this ordinance the Board of Pub
lic Works let a contract for certain print

Typographical Union to use its label.
Lawton & Burnap were lower bidders
than the firm that obtained the contract,
and, backed by the Typothetae, they sued
the city for damages, claiming that the
ordinance was class legislation.
I>B. PIEBCE'S BEMEDIES
"WHAT MAKES MAMA SO
CROSS?"
A Child's Question An-
swered bv a Famous
Specialist.
The mother had one of her "nervous
spells" and the little boy had been
warned to be very quiet. The restless
little fellow moved on tiptoe about the
room trying to ai.iuse himself, but al-
most every move he made was followed
by the querulous cry of the mother,
"Willie, don't make so much noise." At
last in his over anxiety to be quiet, the
boy dropped a book on the floor, and his
mother's angry scream of protest drove
him to the shelter of his father's arms.
The father laid down his paper and
caressed the tearful boy who whispered
between his sobs "Pnpa, what makes
mamma so cross?" Papa made no an-
swer. He did not knqw how to answer.
He could only wonder that in a few

years the gay and sprightly girl he had
married had lust all her spirits, had
faded in face and fallen off in form,
and had developed an Impatience of
temper and an irritability of disposi-
tion which was generally ascribed to
'"nerves."
But there was something else that
papa did not know. He did not know that
every such nervous outbreak caused
his wife intense mental suffering be-
cause of her own weakness. He did
not know that even now behind closed
fingers that hid her face the mother
was weeping because of her own pas-
sionate impatience with the child she
loved.
"What makes mamma so cross?" It
is a pitiful question. In it the little
child puts his finger right on the most
salient feature in the failure of mar-
riage. It is not the case of one wo-
man, but the case of thousands. The
result is a home unattractive to the
husband, and the children's love for
the mother adulterated with fear. The
husband, tired of tears and scolding,
drifts to the village store or the city
club to spend his evenings. The poor
wife sits and looks up at the motto,
which she hung on the wall with a
wifely pride in her heart and a wo-
manly prayer on her lips â "God bless
our home." She feels that the home is
cursed instead of blessed.
Poor woman! She is not to blame
for her nervousness and her tears. It
is the natural and necessary result of
her condition. The finest musician in
the world could get nothing but dis-
cord out of a harp whose every string-
was strained to breakine. That's the
way it is with the woman. She is lit-
erally "all unstrung." Her nervous
system is shattered. All the harmony
of the sweet girl nature is turned to
discord. It is a condition peculiar to
her sex and common to wifehood. Per-
haps this condition began long ago in
girlhood with irregularity In one of the
important female functions followed
maybe with a disagreeable and de-
bilitating drain on the system. Per-
haps It is the Immediate consequence
of the great changes which take place
with marriage. Behind such a nerv-
ous condition will be found inflamma-
tion burning like a fire into the tender
tissues, ulceration eating like poison
into the organs of generation. There
will be Irregular periods, and the bear-
Ing down pains, associated with pro-
lapsus, a disagreeable, unnatural and
debilitating drain, sapping the life and
strength of the "'stem. Some or all
these are behind th.it nervous condition
so painful for the mother, so pitiful for
the family. We know that this Is so
because the treatment of thousands of
women slmilarlv afflicted has proven it
to be so. We know just as surely that
this condition Is curable, because In all
the thousands of cases treated only
two out of every hundred have failed
of complete and perfect ctire: and oven
these two have generally been benefited.
This is not a matter of mere statement.
It Is a matter of record and a matter
of evidence. A half a million of wo-
men could be put into the witness box
to testify that they have been cured of
irregularities, ulcerations. Inflamma-
tions and disagreeable drains on the
system by the use of Dr. Pierce's Fa-
vorite Prescription. The larger part
of this vast army of women are in evi-
dence over their own signatures report-
Ing their former sufferings and their
permanent cure by the "Favorite Pre-
scription." We can only offer here a
few such letters.

ber, IRR9, I gave birth to a baby and
the treatment I received at the hands
of the midwife left me with falling of
the uterus. I had no health to speak
of for three years. I had another baby
which was the third child. My health
began to fail and T had three miscar-
riages, so I found myself completely
worn out. T had so many pains and
aches my life was a burden to me and i
also to all thf> family, for I was nervous
and crosa, and could not sleep. Just
after my last miscarriage (in 1896) I
was taken with a severe pain in my left
side. Had four doctors come to see
me, but at last I found I was slowly
dying. The doctors said I had liver,
lung and uterine trouble. I was In
bed for months, and when I did get
up I was a sight to behold. I looked
like a corpse walking about. I com-
menced to take Dr. Pierce's CSolden
Medical Discovery. 'Favorite Prescrip-
tion' and 'Pellets,' and I was soon a
well woman. I have suffered all a wo-
man could suffer at my monthly â¢â¢ pe-
riod until since I began the use of Dr.
Pierce'a medicines, but now I can say
I have so pain. The dark circles
| DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES^^
around my eyes are going away and _ I
fgel better in every way. My cneens
are red and my face is white, but De-
fore it was as yellow as saffron.
"Your medicines have done W 9 nc v r
for me." writes Mrs. James W. BlacKer
of 629 Catherine street, Syracuse, >â¢ *â¢
"For years my health was very poor, i
had four miscarriaees, but since taK-
lng Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery and 'Favorite Prescription na\ e
much better health, and now I nave a
fine healthy baby." ,
Hundreds of grateful mothers write
to give thanks for relief from suffering
usually experienced in confinement.
Mrs. Carrie B. Donner of Dayton
Green County, Wis., is only one of
the many grateful mothers that tnus
testify to the efficacy of Dr. Fierce s
Favorite Prescription. She says: i
can highly recommend Dr. Fierce s
Golden Medical Discovery and also ms
'Favorite Prescription,' having taKen
the latter for nine months previous to
confinement. I suffered scarcely any
compared with what I had at otner
times." .
Many grateful letter? come from hus-
bands who are made glad by tlu- wife s
new health and happiness. "For five
years my wife was in an almost help-
less condition, suffering from female
weakness," writes J. S. Everitt, Esq.. of
Hagerman, Washington County, Fla.
"Last September I decided to have
her try Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescrip-
tion. She took several bottles of the
medicine and gave birth to a ten-
potind son on January 3f, 1898. She Is
now sound and well and doing her
housework."
"My wife was sick for over eight
years," writes Albert H. Fulte, Esq., of
Altamount, Grundy County, Tenn.
"She had uterine disease and was
treated by two physicians and got no
relief. At last I read in one of your
Memorandum Books which you sent me
about Dr. Pierce's medicines and we
decided to try his 'Favorite Prescrip-
tion.' I sent to the drug store and
got one bottle and the nrst dose gave
ease and sleep. She had not slent any
for three nights. Being sure that it
would cure her I sent for five more bot-
tles, and when she had taken the sixth
bottle she was sound and well. We
now have a fine boy at our house."
Inflammation is pronrniv allayed, ul-
c. -rations healed and the nerve centers
stronKth<-ned by Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription. It stops unnatural and
disagreeable drains on the system, reg-
ulates the periods, and, in fact, adjusts
the organs peculiarly feminine to har-
monious operations in ail their func-
tions. The real pleasure in life then
returns. The form rounds out, the eye
brightens, the dragging step of disease
gives place to the springing step <t
health. A smile, instead of a tear, goes
into every stitch going Into the tiny
garments being made ready for the
coming guestâ a guest who will receive
a glad welcome from a h-^art rich in
maternal love, and a body strong in
maternal power, to cherish and nourish
its Infant life.
All this transformation can be
wrought in ynur own house, if you are
a sufferer, without expensive consulta-
tions, without indelicate questioning or
disagreeable examinations and offen-
sive local treatments.
You can consult Dr. Pierce b~ letter
without cost. This Is one of the most
generous professional offers ever made.
The specialist as a rule multiplies his
fees for advice by the years of his ex-
perience. Dr. Pierce as chief consult-
ing physician to the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute of Buffalo, New
York, has given thirty years to the spe-
cial study of diseases of women. His
vast experience and succoss make him
as a sovereign among specialists. He
places all this at your service without
chnrge. You can write without fear
and without fee. Kvery letter is held
str'ctly private and strictly confiden-
tial. We want to impress up*on you
that this free consultation by letter
gives everything that it promises, and
is what It purports to be, the offer of
an honest medical opinion on. your case
and condition given bv a specialist on
woman's diseases, who has in thirty
years treated many thousands of wo-
men.
Designing men, through alluring and
cunningly worded advertisements, con-
stantly endeavor to work upon the feel-
ings of sick and ailing women by invit-
ing them "to write to a woman (!) and
secure a woman's sympathy." It is well
to remember that the best sympathy
Is to be had at home and not from
strangers, perhaps hundreds of miles
distant. The object of the sick is to get
well, and however precious sympathy
may be, it never yet cured a seriously
afflicted woman. While the sympathy
of your milliner or dressmaker might
be appreciated and be just as beneficial.
If not more so, than sympathy from a
stranger, yet it cannot effect your cure
if you are an ailing woman.
It is loudly proclaimed through the
press that "a woman can best under-
stand a woman's ailments," and on this
ground sick women are invited to
"write to a woman" and get the benefit
of a woman's advice. The sort of "un-
derstanding of her ailments" wanted by
a sick woman is a trained medical un-
derstanding. If a woman has this
trained medical knowledge she under-
stands woman's ailments not as a wo-
man, but as a physician. If she is not
a doctor she cannot understand the ail-
ments at all, and cannot treat them
successfully because she lacks the
necessary training.
As far as known there Is no regularly
qualified woman physician connected
with any proprietary medicine especial-
ly designed for women â no one, there-
fore, qualified by learninsr and experi-
ence, to advise, on questions of disease
and its cure.
It is certain that there Is no one, man
or woman, connected with any "put-
up" medicine for women excepting only
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, who.
like Dr. Pierce, is a regular graduated
and qualified physician, and who has,
DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
like him, devoted more than thirty years
to the special study and treatment of
diseases of women.
In the strictest sense "Favorite Pre-
scription" is a temperance medicine. It
contains no alcohol, whisky or other
; intoxicants, and is free from opium,
â  narcotics, syrup or sugar. Without any
of these it preserves its healing virtues
in any climate.
All dealers in medicine sell Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription. There
is no other medicine to compare with it
in its remarkable cures. Do not there-
fore accept any other medicine in its
place as "just as good." Nothing is
just as good for you which cannot show
i a "just as good" record of cures of
i female diseases. No other medicine can
! show such a record. No other medicine
! therefore can be as good.
The "wonder book" of family medi-
cine, is Dr. Pierce's Common Sense
Medical Adviser. It focuses on the
leading facts of physiology and hygiene
the concentrated light of ages of scien-
tific research. It deals with nature and
disease in the light of common sense.
In simple language it traces the story
of human life from its source. It
I speaks paternally to the young man
â  and young woman on those grave
â  questions that concern each sex. It
speaks with scientific authority to
those who contemplate marriage.
And with all this there are hints and
helps for all the accidents and contin-
gencies that can touch the health of
the family. This great book contains
100S pages, and is sent entirely free, on
receipt of stamps to defray expense of
mailing only. Send twenty-one one-
cent stamps for the paper covered edi-
tion, or thirty-one stamps for the edi-

EXPLAINS WHY HE DESERTED
THE WOMAN.
Chemist Morgan Finds Traces of
Morphine in the Stomach
of the Dead
Woman.
Alexander Donovan, the young man I
whose name was prominently mentioned \
in connection with the death of Mrs. R.
Harry in the house at S Anthony street,
surrendered himself to the police laJÂ»t
night and was locked up in the City
Prison, pending an investigation.
Donovan showed traces of having been |
or. a protracted debauch. As he walked
Into the Chief's office his step was un
steady and In a maudlin voice he an- |
ALEXANDER DONOVAN, Under Arrest on Suspicion
of Being Concerned in Mrs, Barru's Death,
nounced that he was the much-wanted
man. Being unable to get an intelligent
statement from him Captain Bohen or
dered Detectives Egan and Silvey to lock
him up until he became sober.
Donovan is about 23 years of age, but
looks much younger. He was dressed in
a dark suit of clothes and wore a black
sUk negligee shirt.
â >ral hours after he had been locked
up he recovered sufficiently to glv<- a
clear statement. According to his story
he met Mrs. Barry about three years ago
In the house of his uncle at Sacramento.
Hfc was pi. sent at hex marriage and es
corted the happy couple to the train. A
short time agu he claimed Mrs. Barry re
turned to Sacramento and Invited him to
accompany her to this city. She paid his
railroad fax' a* without money.
They rented the fiat at S Anthony .
Donovan occupying a cot in the k.
lay afternoon, according to what
an i-ays, Mrs. Barry gave him her
gold watch and toid him to pawn it as
she was in need of money. >1" pawned
the timepiece for $3 and returning- to the
house, gave the amount to Mrs. Barry.
She was then very ill. Donovan shortly
afterward left th>- bouse and did i.
turn until late at night. Hearing Mr?.
Harry groaning he cautioned her
fj'.:!et ami as the noise continued he
uo lined his clothes and left the flat.
Wlv n asked why he had deserted the
troman Donovan replied: "I was
and a? she continued groaning I
went out intending to get another room."
In one of the pockets of the prisoner
was found a cheap ring, which belonged
to the dead woman. In explanation of
how he came into possession of it Dono
van said that Mrs. Barry had given it
to him as well as the pin which he
pawned for $15.
He admitted to the detectives that he
had spent the amount he received on the
pin for drink.
Donovan emphatically denied that Mrs.
Barry was addicted to the use of opium.
He admitted, however, that she was a

A NICE LITTLE LESSON.
The Duko of Norfolk, it is stated, on
one occasion gave a postofflce young
woman a severe f rljsrht. She had got
into a habit of ruling the public with a
rod of iron, and flavoring her remarks
with a good deal of Impudence. The
Duke saw and heard much of this while
he was writing a telegram. When his
turn came the young woman took his
telegram, read Jt, and dashed it back
to him. "Put your name to it. What's
your name?"
"That will do," said the Duke, point
ing to his signature, "Norfolk."
"That's not the name of a man; that
is the name of a county," snapped the
clerk.
The Duke took the telegram and pro
ceeded to write another, which ran:
"Permanent Secretary, G. P. 0., Lon
don. Clerk at thia office exceedingly
insolent to the public; reprimand se
verely; dismiss on second complaint.â
The Postmaster General." As he hand
ed it in he observed: "This is official,
and will go free."
When the young woman read it she
nearly collapsed. Ay the Duke intended
only to give her a lesson, he consented,
after much entreaty and promise of
aim ndment, to destroy the telegram.â

JOHN T, SCOTT
IS HONORED BY
FELLOW WORKERS
Grand Banquet Given
in His Behalf.
MANY GIFTS TENDERED HIM
APPROACHING NTJPTIALS FIT
TINGLY REMEMBERED.
Congratulatory Speeches Delivered
by Irving M. Scott and
Others â Those Who
Attended.
John T. Scott, general superintendent
of the Union Iron Works, was tendered
a grand banquet last night at Delmon
ico's by the heads of departments of the
great ship bulliung plant. The affair was
an entire surprise id the guest of honor, ;
and was to commemorate his approach
ing nuptials. Seated aroCnd a horseshoe
t;ible laden with the good things of life
in liquid and solid form, and decorated
with beautiful cut flowers tastefully ar
ranged, els â  two fellow workers greet
ed him and wished him joy in the step lie
was about to take. Incidentally he was
presented with silverware and other gifts
from the men who hold him hi high es- I
teem.
The arrangements for the evening's fes
tivities .could not be surpassed, and the
following gentlemen, Daniel O'Netl, It.
Doyle, W. Telfer, John OIBSOn, T. P. Jar
vis and E. T. i>lorriÂ«, received praise for
their work. On Mr. Scott's entrance he
was ,-.:â¢â  ted with a round of hearty
cheering, and on taking his seat at the
side of Chairman James Dickie the invi
tation to fail to was given.
Between courses Fred Chapman, Charles |
Qrolefend and Robert Hernandez played I
selections on mandolin, guitar and banjo. i
Oscar Franks' splendid voice was also
heard in latest melodies, and W. J.
Drew's solo on the flute received de
served applause. Emlle Penez sang a
French song, which, although not under
stood by all. was greatly appreciated.
The first speaker to be introduced by
Chairman Dickie was Irving M. Scott,
who sat at his left. As Mr. Scott arose
he was heartily greeted, and in a con
versational tone delivered an interesting
talk. He dwelt at the outset on the ;
growth of the Union Iron Works, and ;
said It was partially due to the efforts j
of those seated around him. whom he
thought the best of men he had ever seen, \
a thought concurred in by Alec Donel- j
son, who sat close by.
"I have a personal interest in all of |
you," he continued, "and there's not one j
of you who can get along too we'! to
suit me." :
He paid a tribute to Daniel O'Neil, the j
oldest foreman in the establishment, and I
then went on to tell of the great stride j
the Union Iron Works has made since '61. I
Throughout bis talk on that subject he j
! aroused laughter and applause by witty
! allusions to early efforts as compared
I with later results, and then, in obedi
ence to the request of the chairman, he
spoke of his visit to Europe. For a half
hour he held bis listeners spellbound with
a description of his travels. He paid a.
high tribute to Russia as a nation and
dissolved the opinion many had enter
tained that it was a barbarous country,
' He also paid a high tribute to the hon- i
I ored guest and closed by wishing all
present the best of success in all their j
future undertakings. Further applause ]
greeted him. and after a short intermis- \
: sion Chairman Dickie arose and re
marked that he had given up public ;
. speaking many years ago, but this oc
casion demanded some words from him. i
His humorous and sly allusions to Mr.
i Scott's intended entrance into the matri-
I monial state aroused laughter, heartily
| Joined in by the latter.
He then, on behalf of the foremen of
i the Union Iron Works, presented Mr.
; Scott with a magnificent silver service of \
seven dozen pieces, containing knives,
forks and spoons.
Mr. Scott, on behalf of himself and I
betrothed, feelingly thanked his generous
friends for their gift.
George Dickie followed and gave Mr.
Scott some sage advice, and felicitated
him on his coming marriage. He iilso
told a few Instances in his experience that
aroused laughter and applause. He sang
a Scotch ditty that won him an ova- I
tion.
J. P. Baloun, one of the ten representa
tives of the draughting department pres
ent, then arose and in a neat speech pre
sented Mr. Scott with a solid silver vase
which was brought in by J. Donald.
Again did Mr. Scott thank his kind
friends and again he was applauded. Wil
liam White, on behalf of the clerical de
partment, which was well represented,
tendered Mr. Scott a handsome clock and
candelabra. After he had responded, Os
car Franks struck up something; about
John T. Scott beinp a jolly good fellow,
to which all in duty bound sang in uni
son. Cheers were given for Mr. Scott
and his intended, and then George Ratto,
head photographer of the works, took a
flashlight photograph of those present.

HORSE STEALING
LIGHTLY PUNISHED
A JUDGE VIEWS THE CRIME AS
PETTY LABCENY.
John Mara Esc.-pes a Long Term in
Jail After Being Found Guilty
of a Heinous Offense.
! There Is much comment at the City
Hall on the course taken by Judge
Joachimsen In the case of John Mara,
who was arrested last Monday by Offi
cers A. B. Riehl and James A. Belyea on
1 the charge of grand larceny. Mara was
: charged with having stolen two horses
within one week.
On the night of October 6 the lock was
broken on Henry Samuel's stable door,
1017 Valencia street, and his horse taken
from the place and sold to a man named
Patrick J. Heany. He in turn sold the ani
mal at a slaughterhouse In South San
Francisco for 13 SO. On the following Sun
day night a horse belonging to Prank
Hassel who resides at 1(510 Harrison .
street, Was stolen. The boy used the
horse for. the purpose of peddling, by
which ho managed to support himself, his
widowed mother and her live orphan
children. This horse was sold to the
same man for $1 50 and was also taken
to the slaughterhouse, where the Haasell
boy found it the next morning. On recog
nizing his property he informed the peo
ple at the boiling down establishment that
the animal was stolen from his stable on
the previous night. He asked them as a
favor not to kill the horse. He stated be
fore leaving the boneyard that he would
inform the police, which ne did, hurrying
back to the Seventeenth-street station aim I
informing Lieutenant Price, who detailed
Officers ttiebl and Belyea to investigate.
The oliicers went to the slaughterhouse
and found both horses had been killed.
On examining the hides the owners identi
tied their animals. It was here stated to
the oiheers that the horses had been pur
chased from Patrick J. Heany; who re
sides on Alabama street. inquiry at ,
Heany's elicited the information that
Mara had sold the horses to him. On ;
this Information Mara was arrested and |
two charges of grand larceny were lodged :
against mm. Un being confronted with
the- proofs he offered to plead guilty to I
petty larceny, but the police indignantly
declined to compound a felony in a cade j
that to them seemed so clear of not only
horse stealing, but burglary in breaking
into Samuel's stable.
With the foregoing facts In possession |
of the arresting orhcers Mara was per
mitted to plead guilty to petty larceny by
Judge Joachimson and the prosecuting
attorney in his court, notwithstanding the
protest of Officer Kiehl. * '-â 
The following is the report as made to
Captain Gillen by the arresting officers:
San Francisco, Oct. 14. IS9B.
James W. Glllen, captain of police-
Sir: The caEe of John Mara, who had
two charges of grand larceny against him
fur stealing horses, came up in Police
Court No. 3, this morning, the 14th inst.
The prosecuting attorney wanted me to
reduce the charge to petty larceny and I
refused to do it. Complaining witness
Fratik Hassell's testimony was taken
and Judg>; J<>;ichimson ordered me to get
two complaints for petty larceny. This 1
refused to do. and he said he would see
that I would do as he said. I atill refused
and he had the bailiff take the complaints
and reduce them to petty larceny. The
boys signed the complaints and the de
fendant pleaded guilty and the Judge
said he would give him six months on
each charge. Very respectfully,
A. B. RIEHL, Police Officer.
Countersigned: JAMES A. BELYEA,
Police Officer.
Judge Joachlmson sentenced Mara to
six months" imprisonment in the County
Jail on each charge. What annoys the
Police Department is that Mara is either
guilty of grand larceny in stealing the
horses, as there could be no possible
doubt of his guilt, considering the evi
dence against him, or he is guilty of no
offense under our law. It Is rumored that
tho case will brought to the attention of
the Grand Jury for investigation.
Five Years for Lambert.
R. R. Lambert, alias Brown, was sen
tenced by United States District Judge
Hawley yesterday to five years' imprison
ment in the penitentiary at San Quentln
and to pay a line of $500. He had been
caught with a set of counterfeiting molds
and with a large number of counterfeit
pieces of money.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Matilda yon Si-ckendorff has sued E. F.
yon ScckendorfC for a divorce, alleging
desertion as a cause of complaint. Suits
for divorce on the ground of failure to
provide have been filed by Alma Faure
against Edward Faure, Louisa Brown
against Joseph Brown and Augusta Joak-
Inson against Frank Joaklnson.
The guns of a first class battleship cost
about Â£ii 5,000.

MARCHING OF ENGLISH SOLDIERS.
(Reprinted from The London Sketch.;
General Sir Evelyn Wood says: "Re-
tarding the infantry marching, it was Uie
best seen during my command at Alder-
Bhot, or since I was first stationed there
twenty-eight years ago. Many officers
availed themselves of the tonic and re-
constituent properties of the well-knewn
Marlani W|ne, the most certain as well
as the most palatable method of induc-
ing resistance to fatigue."

BETTER LIVE IN ONE ROOM
OF YOUR OWN
Than in 5 rooms that belong: to some one j
else Better stillâ as over 100 families In the
Heyntan Tract have already doneâ let-us sell ;
you a homeâ not of 1 room, but of 40r6 or 6
rooms, hard finished, convenient and attrac- j
tive â that can be yours for the same monthly j
payments you are now paying over to your
landlord.
It's yours from the very moment you get
Into itâ yours to beautify, to make cozy and
to shelter you from the hard knocks of the
world.
Just think! For the very same money you
ray as rent you get a home! Certainly this
is worth looking into. The new Noe Valley
school house going up adjoins the Heyman
Tract, so there is every advantage of schools,
as there is of street car service. Take Mis-
sion-st. cars, transfer to Twenty-second st.

THE CALIFORNIA TITLE INSURANCE AND
TRUST COMPANY
Issues policies of insurance upon realty titles,
which guarantee purchasers and their helns
against lusi.es from defective searches.
The company has a paid-up capital of $250,000
and a reserve fund of 125,000, which amply
guarantees every policy.
The leading banks accept its policies and loan
money upon the property of which the title is
Insured without other search.
Having a complete abstract plan the com-
pany Is able to make and continue abstracts for
use of attorneys at shortest possible notice.
"The advantage of a policy when a man
wishes to convert his property into cash quickly
or to make loans upon it has be^n proven
again and again by experience. The man with
a guarantee title finds that he can borrow
money with as much ease as If he had stock*
and boi:ds."â Chicago Tribune.
"The guarantee of such companies protects ;
purchasers of property and mortgages against
risks which, though remote, always attend real
estate transactions. The most experienced i
lawyer may err, especially where the law is un-
determined and fraud la an element of danger." ]

BY CORPORAL FRED A. HEALY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Sept. 4.â 1 don't suppose I
the American boy ever lived who,
above and beyond everything else, has
not at one time or another had his
fancy captured and his ambition arous
od by tales of war and martial heroism.
1 don't suppose there ever existed in
America or any other country a man
or woman for whom the tale of a battle
did not hold a shuddering fascination.
I know, for my own part, nothing in
literature held for me ne-half the in- |
terest contained between the calfskin j
covers of a history, and often, when I
had finished readinr the account of j
some battle like Waterloo, Aysterlitz, j
Gettysburg or Shiloh, or had come to ,
the conclusion of a tale recounting the ;
downfall of a Metz or a Sedan, I would j
close the volume and let my imagina
tion try to picture for my entertain
ment an actual scene of battle, while I
would try to conceive what my own
sensations would be before going into
action and while under fire.
Since the commencement of our op
erations against Manila I, in company
with the rest of the regiment, have
been in two engagements, which,
though small, were exceedingly sharp,
have been shot at a score of times and
have taken part in a campaign which
has resulted in the capture of a forti
fied city containing over two hundred
thousand inhabitants, and defended,
before our own guns got in their deadly
work, by over fourteen thousand sol
diers, most of whom were veterans. I
have tried to analyze my own feelings,
which I find on inquiry were about the
same as the feelings of every other man
in the regiment, and if it will interest
you at all 1 will try. while giving you a
short account of the assault on Manila,
to tell in a crude way of the sensations
which are felt by a man in the ranks
when he is first under fire. First, I
would like to say that the greater part
of that which has been written about
battle, etc., is bo much bosh. 1 have
read many accounts purporting to give
a faithful account of a soldier's life,
both in the camp and on the field, and
unless the m<-n of thirty or forty years
ago were of a different ctay fr-rn the
men of to-day they are about aj mis
leading as a vivid and romantic imag
ination can make them.
A soldier"3 life in camp is one long,
monotonous routine of havl and dis
agreeable wcrk, rilled with sickness and
discomfort and clouded with a sordid
ness th ough which there seldom
breaks ever, the faintest slimmer of
anything glorious. As for the romance,
vvtll, that comes in when the veteran
te turns lump and lies to nis sweetheart
about the gieat things he lid at th-:
front. In camp everything Is as practi
cal as discipline and a mathematical
dlatril/unor of scanty rations can make
it. f;u-. II return to the fall of Manila
and the second regular engagement
participant iv by the Call2->ruia Volun
teers.
The assault took place on Saturday,
August 13. On the previous Thursday
we went out to take our twenty-four
hour turn in guarding the trenches.
Everything pointed toward a big fight
in the near future, and from the work
we were ordered to perform most of
the boys came to the conclusion that
the bombardment would open on the
following (Friday) morning. We passed
the whole night waiting amid the rain
in a state of sopping expectation for
the coming of the dawn. The dawn
came at last, but that was all that did
come, save a few scattering Spanish
bullets, and at the regular hour our
relief arrived and we, turning our backs
on the trenches, marched to camp and
rest.
On Friday afternoon orders for the
cooking of extra rations, distribution
of ammunition, etc., commenced to ar
rive, and finally, about sundown, the
news that we were to make the assault
on the morrow became a confirmed cer
tainty. I expected to witness a great
deal of enthusiasm, cheering and all
the Bort of thing one reads about and
is conjured up before one's mind by
poetry and song of "The Night Before
the Battle, Mother" variety. There
was nothing of the kind. A little
cheering did take place, but only a lit
tle. The boys received the news just
about as they would have received any
general order. First with a little buz
zing discussion in a general conclave
and then, breaking up into groups of
three or four, they walked to their tents
talking about the prospects of the scrap
and separating shortly to clean their
arms and get their accouterments in
proper condition. Their whole de
meanor was a businesslike one, and as
devoid of anything in the romantic line
as it could possibly be.
The morning came all too soon for a
fellow who wanted a good, long sleep,
and wanted it badly. Lsut quickly as
the dawn appeared the cooks were up
before it, and when we turned out at
reveille a steaming hot breakfast of
bacon and coffee awaited us. Men
fight best as they make love bent â on
a full stomach, and for once we got all
we wanted to cat. Dishes were has
tily washed, blanket bags and belts
strapped on and the boys, rifle in hand,
stood ready and expectant, awaiting
the order to fall in. But it did not
come. A burst of music issued from
the camp in our rear and soon the head
of a column emerged from the city of
tents and, with a band playing gayly
in its front, marched past us and dis
appeared in the woods toward the fir
ing line. We chperod these fellows to
the echo as they passed us ana the
boys, turning away, stood ready for
the long expected assembly to sound,
us we supposed that we would be the
next to go. But we were doomed to
disappointment. Body after body of
troops came out of the white ant hill
in our rear and were lost in the brush
In our front, and still we remained im
patiently idling about our company
street. Then one could perceive how
much In earnest the fellows were and
get some idea of the feverish turmoil
in the hot young blood running under
their bronzed skins. As each succes
sive troop filed past our company street
the men in its ranks would jeer at our
boys and tell them to be sure and keep
the camp kettles boiling, as they would
want a nice hot supper when they had
finished whipping the Spaniards.
The poor fellows from San Francisco
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1898.
at first attempted to answer, but, as it
became more and more apparent that
they were to be left behind, their laugh
ter dwindled down to sickly smiles
which, subsiding, gave way in turn 10
an expression of bitter humiliation and
keen disappointment. 'Hâ l," said one
fellow. "We have worked like slaves
and starved like castaways and now
they won't even give us a chance to get
a shot at" â
But he was mistaken. The First Cali
fornia was to receive plenty of shots
before nightfall.
Finally, about 9 o'clock, Brigadier
Anderson suddenly made his appear
ance, and the shrill, stirring notes of
tho assembly floated out on the air. I
have seen men fall in many times since
I joined the army, but I have never
witnessed anything like the prompti
tude with which that call was obeyed.
Men came out of their tents as though
propelled by a catapult, and a regu
lar race for the end of the street en
sued, the boys fairly falling over one
another in their eagerness to fall in,
while the whole field rang with their
wild cheering. We had waited long,
but when we once started no more
time was lost. We fell in, counted off
and then the whole regiment was
marched down in front of headquar
ters, where the flag joined us and where
our chaplain. Father McKinnon,
blessed us and gave us absolution. It
was a sight never to be forgotten. The
flag, its folds gracefully drooping about
its staff as though it rested in prepar
ation for the work it knew was to
come; the chaplain, standing between
It and the ranks he was addressing
and exhorting by everything they held
dear in this world or hoped for in the
world to come to act like men In the
work before them, and promising them
the forgiveness of their church If their
destiny Bhould be death, and lastly, the
long, brown ranks stretching from end
to end of the encampment, bare head
ed, reverent and resolute, longing for
the commencement of the action, not
withstanding the death and carnage
which must accompany it.
"Whr-n Father McKinnon had con
cluded we were marched in columns of
fours to the right of our camp, where
the column, turning to the left,
marched past the fringe of bamboo
lining the front of our encamp
ment, and took up our position as re
serve in the open fields in front. We
were lined up in battalion forma
tion, our left resting a short
distance from the beach and our
lines stretching across to the Calle
Real, or Royal Road, on our right.
Ahead of us we could see great masses
of troops drawn up in similar forma
tion resting on their arms and awaiting
the opening of the ball. I don't know
what weight the other troops carried
into battle with them, but I do know
our load of ammunition, rifle and ra
tions amounted to nearly sixty pounds,
altogether too heavy a load for troops
to go into action with. As soon as we
had reached our position we were halt
ed, arms were stacked and rubber
blankets thrown over them to protect
them from the light rain which was
falling, while the boys, unslinging their
blanket bags with the heavy loads of
ammunition and rations, proceeded to
make themselves comfortable while
waiting for the bombardment to begin.
I have often heard of the sensations
which animate a man under simiiar
conditions. I cannot speak for others,
but lack of sensation more than any
thing else would express what I did not
feel. The humid heat was something
terrible. My whole body was reeking
with perspiration, which was helped
along by my canteen, the stopper of
which had come out, and whk'h was
slowly emptying its contents of hot cof
fee down my legs. I was tired, wet, hot
and uncomfortable, and I did not par
ticularly care what happened so long
as something did occur which would
change my condition. My back was
aching from the load it was forced to
bear, and my shoulders where the
straps passed over were raw. The only
sensation I had was one of relief as I
sank down on the wet ground and
watched the native boys passing along
the lints with trays of bananas and
oranges, which they tried to sell to the
troops. The boys about me were smok
ing, laughing, joking and conversing
about the coming battle. Our officers
stood in little groups in our rear and
talked together. Colonel Smith and a
few other officers had disappeared from
sight in the fringe of trees that
stretched along the sandy beach and
hid the water from our sight. They
had gone down to the shore to witness
the opening of the bombardment. In a
word, the whole scene was just such a
one as one would see at a review in the
Presidio while the troops were resting
for a few moments.
We had rested for but only a few
moments when b-o-om â the sound of
a great gun burst through the fringe
of the trees and passed along our lines,
while in the same moment the wild
whirring and shrieking of an eight
inch shell was heard, as it were, hurtling
over our heads toward the Spanish in
trenchments. The effect of this first
shot was very curious to note. A pro
found silence fell upon the ranks, cig
arettes and cigars were dropped, and
the men's faces suddenly assumed a
different expression. They grew
strained and hard in an instant.
Wrinkles came into their brows, while
lines which I had never noticed before
stretched down past their nostrils and
along the edges of their upper lipa.
Their jaws set hard together, and one
could hear their respirations as they
sucked their breath in as though
straining it between their teeth. Out
of their eyes all good humor and
friendliness had vanished. They had
grown cold and hard, while in their
depths there glittered a strangle sort of
light. Yes, with that first shot a great
change had come, and it was not pleas
ant to see.
Following the initial shell came an
other, then another, and still others, in
rapid succession. The Utah batteries
in the trenches, which constituted our
firing line. Joined in, and the din be
came terrific. The noise of the shoot
ing, terrible as it was, was nothing
when compared to the horrible hum
ming and shrieking the shells made as
they flew past us from the moulhs of
their cannon on the ships, which were
stationed in the bay on our left and
slightly to our rear. The fringe of
trees, of which I have before spoken,
hid everything from our view. We
could only tell what was going on by
our ears, and when the sharp, quick
rapping of the rapid-fire guns on the
vessels commenced we knew that
things were beginning to get close and
warm in the Spanish trenches.
As soon as the bombardment had be
come general and the boys had grown
a little accustomed to the whizzing and
whirring of the great shells over their
heads they began to recover from
their awe and to show up in their nat
ural colors. Some continued to listen in
strained attitudes with tense nerves,
which would jump at each explosion;
some kept very quiet, as though think
ing deeply on what was in store for
them; a few attempted to Joke, but
their humor was not appreciated, and
their unechoed laughter seemed
strange and lacking the quality of
mirth. Men would reach for their
rifles and then withdraw their hand,
would suddenly get on their feet, look
around in an aimless manner, and
then as suddenly settle down in their
former positions. Small things, which
under ordinary circumstances would
attract no attention, suddenly became
matters of absorbing interest. I re
member I became more interested in
a small dog just behind me which was
diligently hunting for fleas than I have
been in anything for a long time, and
my anxiety as to the final outcome of
his explorations was hardly less than
his own. 1 also noticed that no one's
belt seemed to hang properly, nor did
any one's clothes set comfortably on
him. They both needed constant and
oft-repeated adjustment. Inane re
marks and queries were common and
excited no comment. Every man at the
time considered himself perfectly cool,
yet every action was eloquent of the
strain and excitement under which he
was laboring.
Suddenly the firing from the ships
ceased as abruptly as it commenced,
and we saw our colonel riding toward
our lines out of the fringe of trees along
the beach. With his horse prancing
under him, while he smiled and waved
his sword above his head, he made the
first and only martial picture, of the
kind one reads about, I have seen since
the beginning of the campaign. He
came straight toward us on the gallop,
but there was no need to tell us the
order he was about to give. It was
"forward." Every man could see that
written all over his features, and quick
ly as he came the boys were still
quicker and were on their feet, rifles
in hand, cheering wildly ere he had
reached the nearest files. The order
came. '"Battalion, forward!" com
manded Major Sine. "Company, for
ward!" re-echoed the captains and
lieutenants of the different companies
and the Second Battalion moved on
ward toward the tiring line, following
them, in regimental formation, the
First Battalion and being followed in
turn by the Third Battalion in its
proper place. Un we pressed, passing
the troops we had seen and envied ear
lier in the morning as they passed out
of the encampment before us. We now
took the lead of them. Coming to a
thick line of brush and trees the com
panies split up into squad formation
and pressing onward through the
brush, mud and water passed beyond
the support in the second line of
trenches, and kept on until they stood
in the first line of American trenches
facing the Spanish breastworks a half
mile away, on one portion of which the
American flag was now floating. Hut
the order was still "Forward," and the
Californians, marching by tht; left,
with the Second Battalion under com
mand of Major Sime in the lead,
started out over the trenches and along
the beach, marching in column of fours
toward the outskirts of Manila, while
Mauser bullets sang and whistled about
their ears and spat into the sands at
their feet. Un toward the Stars and
Stripes, waving over what had once
been Fort Malate, they went. A river
Hows into the bay a short distance in
front of the fort. Into this we plunged
up to our shoulders and waded across,
while the Spaniards away to our right
splattered the water into our faces with
their badly aimed bullets. Crouching
amid the ruins of Fort Malate we found
a body of regular troops sheltering
themselves and awaiting orders. We
lay down beside them for a few mo
ments to catch our breath, and here
occurred the second inspiring sight of
the day. One of the regimental bands,
the one belonging to the Mirmesotas
I think, though I am not sure, came
marching up to us, every man stand-
Ing erect and paying absolutely no heed
to the bullets which fairly rained about
them, while they played for dear life.
The tune was "Dixie." At the head,
straight as an ash and as unconcerned
as though on parade, marched their
drum major, showing them tho way.
How the boys cheered them. And they
deserved it, for their action was as gal
lant a one as has been performed dur
ing the whole campaign.
But Fort Malate was merely the edge
of the Spaniards' outermost works,
which had been reduced to a pile of
('rumbling ruins by the guns of the
fleet. Manila was our objective point,
and again came the command "For
ward." The regiment sprang to its feet.
The Second Battalion, with Company
L, Captain Eggert commanding, in the
lead, started onward and entered the
outskirts of the city with a rush. From
that moment until the fighting was all
over I saw no more of the rest of the
army. The Second Battalion followed
its gallant colonel and major wherever
they led, and their course, which was
ever forward, was so rapid that even
the scouts were passed and the balance
of the army and regiment was left far
in the rear.
Captain Eggert, Lieutenant Curzons
and Lieutenant Adler of L Company
exhibited the highest gallantry, and the
manner in which these gentlemen led
their men along the shot-plowed streets
right up to the very walls of old Ma
nila is still the talk of the city. Friend
and enemy alike join in praising them
and their little band of followers, while
Major Hugh Sime, who alone and far
ahead, led them all, is the hero of the
hour.
We entered the suburbs over walid
and fences and through gardens. We
fought our way up streets, through
houses and over barricades under a
continual rain of rifle fire. Not a man
in the entire company flinched for a.
minute. Not one weakened. You may
criticize the San Francisco youth as
you please. He has many faults, but
cowardice is not among them. He is
dead game.
Lieutenant Curzons had charge of the
firing line, and under his direction the
trcx ps sent volley after volley up the
street. That they were well aimed the
biK splashes of blood and occasional
bodies that were met as we advanced
convincingly assured us.
Even here I witnessed nothing of that
irlorious enthusiasm which I had ex
pected to see. Men lowered their heads
as though they were making their
piOf,i*â¬M through a heavy storm of wind
and rain, and advanced with a dogged
determination and a. coolness of de ;
meaner which was surprising. The
only evidence of the excitement wlii.'h
ainnated them came from the Hashing
of their eyes, which had lost that cold,
r/.ony glance produced by the first shot
from Ihe fleet, and now looked red and
wicked and as though they were suf
fused with blood.
A man becomes more or less me
chanical under such conditions. He
knows he has been ordered to go up
thÂ«.- street, and the idea that he must
get there possesses his mind to the ex
clusion of all else, and the only desire
he has is a wild, well-nigh uncon
trollable wish to kill some one or some
thing. He doesn't care much who or
what. 1 know at one time, while com
ing up the street, four or five of us
went into a large, rambling barracks
on one side of the roadj, and that we
met a polite native who, standing in a
doorway raised above tlie level of the
ground by three stone fteps, informed
us that the Spaniards Â»ad been there,
but had left a few moments before.
Then, crossing his armi over his chest,
he smiled and vowed eternal friendship
for America and all pertaining there
to. Now, I am as mild-mannered a youth
as ever knocked the head off a bottle,
and have never before felt any desire to
slay any one. Yet I strongly desired
to kill that native who stood there un
armed, smiling, bowing and protesting
his friendship. I had never seen him
before, nor do I ever expect to see him
again. I felt no hatred or enmity for
the man. Yet only the strong restraint
of discipline prevented me from send
ing a bullet crashing into his brain.
I spoke to two of my comrades after
the battle, and they told me they felt
exactly as I did. 'Tis a good idea to
keep out of the way when troops take
a city.
But to return to the assault. "We
continued ud the street, Company L
still far in the lead, advancing almost
at a double quick despite the bullets
which the Spaniards sent down upon
our front and in on each flank from
every cross street we passed in a vain
endeavor to check our progress.
Half way up the thoroughfare on
which we were advancing we came
upon a small body of insurgents, who
had appeared from God knows where,
and who had taken shelter in a church,
the bell of which they were wildly
ringing, while they spasmodically shot
their guns out of the doors and win
dows, pointing the muzzles carefully
into the air before pulling the triggers.
They greatly helped the confusion and
heightened the effect of the scene,
though I am afraid they did but little
execution. Some of our boys wanted to
fire upon them, but were restrained by
the officers.
When we had advanced a little far
ther we came across a peppery little
captain of regulars who had managed
to get a few of his own men up toward
the front. These he had pieced out
with the help of a few stragglers from
other regiments until the whole formed
a small body of twenty or so, who were
acting as scouts. As our boys came
up to this gentleman and his hetero
geneous command he turned to a fellow
by the name of Campbell, who was the
first man in the first squad, and or
dered him back. Campbell paid no at
tention, but continued to push ahead.
Then the rotund little, fire-eater drew a
pistol and threatened to kill the first
man who dared to advance ahead of
him. The boys merely laughed at him
and rushed past. He came along some
where or other in course of time.
Shortly after this the firing com
menced to slacken and soon died away
altogether. The streets became as si
lent as the halls of death and our foot
falls echoed from the empty houses on
either side with a strange uncanny
sound. This was the only time I saw
any signs of nervousness in the boys.
They continued to advance with the
same rapidity and spirit they had ex
hibited from the start. But one could
seee by the glances they sent down
each side street and by the readiness
in which they held themselves to meet
any emergency that they could not un
derstand the strange and sudden si
lence. They were used to being shot at,
but when they were let alone they be
gan to look for a trap.
Suddenly a shout came from the first
squad, and Ben Clancy, waving his gun
high in the air, started forward on the
run, crying out that he saw the walls
of the old city and that a white flag
was floating over them. This was
enough, and the entire company, offi
cers and men, started forward pell
mell, each man on the dead run, trying
to be the first up. It was true. Manila
had surrendered, and L. Company of the
Second Battalion, First California Vol
unteers, was the first and only body of
troops In at the death.
They were ahead of the army, ahead
of the scouts, ahead of the flag, ahead
of all save their own officers, the gallant
Major Sime. Captain Eggert and the
two lieutenants, Curzons and Adler,
who had led them well and bravely
from start to finish.
In about ten or fifteen minutes other
troops beg-an to arrive on the scene cf
the surrender until the entire Second
Battalion, together with a few others,
was lined up on the broad driveway
running between the "walls of the old
city and the houses of new Manila.
Spaniards still manned the walis. but
the gates were open and their higher
officers had come out and were mixing
with our officers, trying to make them
selves understood. Up one of the streets
to the right there came a large body
of Spanish soldiers who had sur
rendered and who had been outflanked
by the rapidity of our advance. They
were slowly and sullenly retreating into
the old city to lay down their armn.
Our position was between them and the
walls.
Suddenly from behind this body
of returning troops there broke out a
furious fire. The insurgents had come
up and started to massacre the enemy
they could not conquer. The Spaniards
on the walls started to reply. The
American troops got under cover wher
ever they could, each man loading his
piece and covering some Spanish officer,
prepared to sell his life as dearly as
possible. For a few minutes 4t looked
as though a general hand-to-hand flght
and massacre was to take place, the
end of which would come with the
wiping out of the entire Second Bat
talion and the sacking of the city by
the rest of our troops. Spanish and
American officers ran among their
troops, working hand in hand to pre
vent the threatened tragedy. Every
thing swayed in the balance when the
third incident of the day took place.
Private Carl Moltke, jumping to his
feet, waved a white handkerchief over
his head and called for the flag to ad
vance. It came, borne in by Flag Ser
geant Taylor of B Company, who, ac
companied by Major Sime, Moltke and
one or two others, advanced down
through the retreating Spaniards until
they came right up to the muzzles of
the blazing insurgent guns, when they
halted, and pointing to the Stars and
Stripes which floated over them, com
manded in the name of that banner,
which is as powerful in peace as it is
dreadful in war, that the slaughter
cease. And it did.
This concluded the day, and march
ing across the suspension bridge over
the Pasig River we stacked arms on
the stones of the famous Elcolta and,
unslingjng our blanket bags, sank
down on the pavement thoroughly ex
hausted to eat our lunch of cold bread
and meat. The boys had marched at
almost a double quick gait nearly five
miles, fighting, breaking in doors, scal
ing walls and breastworks and pack
ing nearly sixty pounds the entire dis
tance. Ttoere was not a fellow who
had fallen behind, though, when all
was over, several rolled over and
fainted with exhaustion. We were not
excited, so we thought. Yet our load,
which we had never noticed during the
battle, became as heavy as the Old Man
of the Sea as soon as all was over.
Scattered firing was kept up all day
and night, but it amounted to nothing.
Manila fell with the raising of the
white flag on its walls, and the war in
the Philippines was at an end.
In the evening we were marched
down to the former residence of the
Governor General, where we were bar
racked. As I stood on my post as sen
try at midnight I turned to my com
panion on watch and said: "Adding
ton. how do you feel, now that it is ell
over?" "I feel as^%hough I had been in
a trance," he answered. I felt that
I had been in a trance, also, a trance
which had encompassed more in the
brief limits of its duration than was
held in all the other years of my life.
Developing an Oil District.
SAN MIGUEL, Oct. 15.â Machinery for
the oil prospecting work in the new pe
troleum district near here has arrived, and
work will soon be commenced to deter
mine the nature and extent of the alleged
oil discoveries. County Surveyor Lou G.
Hare of Salinas is setting stakes to lower
the grades and straighten the county
road leading to that soctlon, and the road
will be improved to withstand the heavy
traffic that is expected to pass over it
within a short time. It is also reported
th.it the road will be surveyed through
and built to Coalingo in Fresno County.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. I.â Lots of
wild-eyed stories are begat in the new
diggings around Lake Atlin. Their
father's name is Boom and their
mother's Exaggeration. The latest is
that the mother lode has been struck
in there, radiant with gold. Another
story is that a creek has been found
beyond Surprise Lake, where the sur
face gravel runs from $1 75 to $5 to the
pan with the pay streak not yet lo
cated. Only the richest claims on El
Dorado and Bonanza are in it with this
kind of gravel, but it is a fact well
known to conservative miners who have
been on the ground and returned here
for the winter, and with whom I hava
had many conversations, that nothing
yet has been found at Atlin which com
pares with the best in the Klondike.
This, however, should not be taken as
a limit to the discoveries that may be
made. Nobody can yet write or speak
with accuracy on the possibilities in the
Atlin region. It is the rule in placer
camps that pay streaks are found
which are very rich in gold, and all the
signs so far indicate that Atlin will
I prove no exception to the rule. One
of the best-known placer miners in
Alaska sunk a hole to bedrock on his
claim. He said to another miner, "I
lam satisfied." I heard about this in
a round-abuut way. That expression
\ among miners means a good deal for
a prospect. In an interview 1 had pre-
I viously with this same man he did not
j express himself so confidently to me.
The area of what seems to be a gold
bearing country, prospected and unex
plored, from the best information I can
obtain at this time looks to be the equal
if not larger than the Klondike. Com
paratively few holes have been put
I down to bedrock, and for this reason it
is not yet known how valuable the
ground is on a vast majority of the lo
cations. That there is gold in the beds
of Pine and Spruce creeks and several
of the smaller creeks emptying into
Surprise Lake there is not the slightest
doubt, but the facts in regard to the
maximum value of most of the located
ground may not be known till next Au
gust, by which time considerable de
velopment work will have been done;
and by which time, also, many new lo
cations will have been staked. It is
Idle to overlook the fact that there will
be a rush to Atlin next spring from
Alaska towns, saying nothing of people
who may come from farther away.
A hungry stampede has already
started from Testtn City on Teslin Lake.
William Reisch, who has made nine
trips from Juneau to Teslin since last
spring over the Taku trail, left the
town at the head of that lake less than
two weeks ago. He says about six
hundred horses carrying men and non
descript outfits are on the trail between
Teslin and Atlin. and perhaps have
reached Atlin by this time in large part.
The men preferred taking chances in
reaching a camp where gold has been
found than remaining where practi
cally no gold has been discovered,
where food is scarcer than starvation
prices and where there is nothing to
look forward to under existing circum
stances. Their chances in reaching At
lin are hazardous, for many have
headed across the country depending on
their guns for food, instead of follow
ing the trail. More than 85 per cent
of this caravan started out with less
than enough grub for the trip, and less
than 5 per cent have a winter's outfit.
The situation of these men is very
serious. They are running away from
hunger probably to meet starvation
face to face on the way. "Winter with
blinding snowstorms and intense cold
has already come in the interior. The
tops of the coast range of mountains
are already hooded in white. The
critical condition of the men of Teslin
is the result of the attempt and failure
of trying to get in with their outfits
over the Btickeen trail from Wrangel.
Hundreds got through with light packs,
but most of their supplies are still at
Glenora or cached on the trail near
there. The Hudson Bay Company has
a store at Teslin City, and there are
two other stores there, but prices are
too high to be reached by the average
gold-seeker, who left home with little
money. Reisch says he saw a man
walking o round Teslin City recently
offering $500 which he held In his hand
for 500 pounds of grub, and didn't get
it. Horses are selling for $1 each at
Teslin. There is no feed for them.
The stampeders to AtHn paid that sum
for their horses, expecting to ride them
as far as the starved and weakened
beasts could go on what forage they
might find on the way under the snow.
and then when they could go no far
ther to eat them if they must. Whole
armies in the field have eaten horse
flesh and considerable of it is now
canned and sold under the name of
roast beef. Canned horse meat is sup
plied to the Pacific Coast by an abat
toir at Portland, but that is another
story. Before Teslin City is an island
and on each side of it mud flats. Two
large scows, built for carryalls to Daw
son, have not been able to pet over the
flats since the lake has fallen and are
still at Teslin. The water in Teslin
Lake recedes from eight to twelve feet
at the end of the summer when the
mountain snows cease to melt. The
steamboat built there sailed during
high water for Dawson, but has not
â¢;de a round trip.
!old was found beyond Teslin Lake
t Bummer, a considerable distance up
the country drained by the Nasutlin
and Big Salmon rivers. Both are larse
streams. Nasutlin empties into Teslin
Lake between fifty and sixty miles up
from Teslin City on the northeast side.
Sndreds of men stampeded for the
sutlin. but only nine succeeded in
ting eighty miles up the river find
over a porVage to Quiet Lake, near
which the discovery was made. These
nine men, of which Reisch is one, and a
California miner of Lns Angeles named
Funk another, formed a company, and
they wiH stay there this winter and ero
to bedrock. Quiet Lake is about forty
miles long. It is one of two lakes much
smaller than Teslin, of which t.he Bier
Salmon River is the nutlet, and they its
source. A Canadian surveying party
was at work In that country last sum
mer, and was met by many of the
stampeders from Teslin. Reisch has a
claim In the new diggings at Atlin. He
also staked one for Anthony Kennel of
Juneau. a Hungarian nob , le â¢ an v /h n h^i

gentleman the other day, as in an idle
and unguarded moment he was turn
ing a hose into the yawning jaws of a
pet bulldog which was trying to bite
the stream of water. Such is life in the
far North. .
The country up the Nasutlin Rijer,
around Quiet Lake and the headwaters
of the Big Salmon, it is said, was never
entered by white men before, and its
mineral possibilities are wholly un
known. Reisch says that the discovery
of g-old is on a small tributary that
comes into the Big Salmon River near
its head, and not far from the smaller
of the two lakes composing its neaa
waters. That gold was found so early,
though not easily, as the region was
reached with only the hardest kind or
physical effort and many discomforts,
is looked upon a favorable sign and as
promising still more for that unexplored
Interior. . ,
This morning the Alaska Commercial
Company's steamer Dora, Captain
Johensen, came in from Valdez, Copper
City, Cooks Inlet, Kadiak and other
ports to the westward, with about
eighty passengers. Among them is
Robert Michelson, who has been mining
in the Cooks Inlet country about eight
years. He and associates call them
selves the Polly Mining Company. This
company has one, if not the best, of the
very few good placer claims in the fcix
Mile District. They were embarrassed
by high watw all season, all mining
operations being retarded by the un
usual Hoods. On September 5 last tna
Polly Mining Company's dam was
swept away, and the working season
shortened about a month on that ac
count. Nevertheless, it is reported that
the seasons-- clean-up for this company
is close around $23,000. It will cost
over $2000 to renew the dam. Men in
the other company working in that sec
tion disagreed during the season. They
are from Fresno, Cal. A man named
Ducey went off to a claim by himself,
and he is said to have made nothing.
Thomas Williams and Thomas Atkin
son worked the original ground, and It
is understood will make a considerable
clean-up, though it is not known how
much. The Fresno people will not
come out, but will winter at Sunrise
City. No new discoveries are reported
in the Cooks Inlet country. Captain
Johensen says about 1000 men will win
ter at Valdez and in the Copper River
country. They have plenty of grunb
and will be housed in log cabins. Two
hundred more will leave for their
homes i the States. A number of pros
pectors on the Kyack River are ready
to come out for the winter. No reports
have yet been received from them as to
results of the season's work. On ac
count of the number of people who
want to go below the Dora will make
two more trips than usual this fall,
and may not arrive here on the last re
turn voyage until about the middle of
November. Altogether placer mining
to the westward this year has been far
from encouraging, but there is an im
mense country over in that section of
Alaska never prospected or explored,
but believed to be gold-bearing. The
"westward" is the part of Alaska prom
ising most in agriculture and coal. Sev
eral miners and tenderfeet on the Dora
will go to the new diggings at Lake
Atlin.
An effort Is being made In Jaaeau
to organize a company to string a tel
egraph line to Atlin City by way of the
Taku trail. The estimated cost is
$7000 and the distance is about 100
miles, half water.
Juneau Chamber of Commerce has
appointed F. S. Nowell a committee of
one to provide an Alaska mineral ex
hibit for the Paris Exposition.
Among the Californians from Cooka
Inlet and Copper River homeward
bound are: George Paden and W. J.
Wilson, Fresno; P. W. Lancaster, En
cinitas; William Shutt, M. L. Bennett

James Gallaudet, the "King of the
Dumps," was ready in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday morning to defend him
self against the charge of assault with a
deadly weapon brought against him by
J. P. Kramer, a watchman for the South
ern Pacific. The assault was alleged to
have been committed on September 24
owing to a dispute between Kramer ami
Gallaudet as to the ownership of a small
wharf at the foot of Kentucky street.
When the case was called Bailiff Far

able being that the deceased -while

HE PURLOINED "SHREWSBURY"
FROM COOPER'S STORE.
Arrested. He Claimed That He Was
Hard Up and Wanted Some
thing to Read op
Sunday.
Dr. J. C. Chester, an alleged physician,
who claims to be well connected in the
East, was arrested last evening between
8 and 9 o'clock for stealing a book from
Cooper's book and stationery store on
Market street.
A -well-dressed gentleman wearing a
silk hat and Prince Albert coat went into
the bookstore and began examining the
works on the shelves. Q. W. Hoadley,
a clerk in the store, was waiting on an
army officer at the time, but for some
reason was suspicious of the stranger and
kept an eye on him while talking to his
customer. He saw him take a volume
from the shelves which he recognized as
"Shrewsbury," by Stanley J. Weyman.
After turning over the pages of the book
for several minutes the doctor carelessly
put it under his coat. Another book
which he had in his possession when he
entered the store he placed under his
arm directly over the one he had pur
loined.
Hoadley observed the entire operation,
but, as he had had several similar ex
periences, wished the book thief to leave

tor started for the door, then turned back
and walked half-way toward the rear of
the store, carefully watching to see if
his movements were observed. Think
ing he had not been seen he sauntered
leisurely to the door, where he stood a
moment before starting up the street.
As soon as the doctor reached the side
walk Hoadley called Mr. Cooper's atten
tion to the man and went after him. He
brought the doctor back into the store,
and in the presence of the proprietor and
another witness pulled the bonk from un
der his coat.
Dr. Chester protested innocence, at
first claiming there had been some mis
tako, but when an officer was called ad
mitted that he had stolen the book, and
gave as his reason that he was hard up
and wanted something" to read on Sun
day When searched at the police sta
tion he had $7 on his person. While in
the bookstore he handed the sergeant
who had him under arrest a slip of paper,
on which ho had written the information
that he had at one time been connected
with the House of Correction.
A short time after the doctor's arrest
two men from the Lucas Detective
Agency Bite i the Cooper store and tried
to "square" the case, but, having been
troubled a great deal of late by people
with kleptomania. Mr. Cooper refused to
lot the doctor off without a prosecution.
The detectives say that Chester 1* well
connected In "Wisconsin, his parents and
relatives being prominent people. Mr.
Hoadley cays that the detective* at
tempted at first to try a bluff game, but
not succeeding in this tried to work Mr.
Cooper's sympathy.
It is said that the prisoner's true name
is J. c Joselyn.
THE HEAVIEST THING IN THE
WxjRLD.
The heaviest thing In the world is the
metal osmium, the bluish-white metal
with violet luster which Mr. Smlthson
Tenr : discovered ninety years ago in
the rescue from dissolved platinum ores.
This metal has a specific gravity of 22.477,
that of gold being 19.2Â©. lead 11.367, iron
7.79 ami lithium, the lightest, only 0.694.
The French chemist, Joly. determined
that osmium la likewise the most infus
ible of metals. It could never be made
to yield to the oxyhydrogen flame, which
makes platinum and iridtum run like
â¢water. But Joly ha,} been subjecting
osmium to the exclusively high tempera
ture of the electric arc, which MoisÃan
has of late employed successfully in the
manufacture of diamonds.
Under this fierce heat the rare metal
ruthenium, which used to be deemed all
but infusible, readily melts. But osmium
remains refractory, there being apparent
only the faintest traceÂ« of fusion. On
this account own Slim cannot be prepared
in sufficient quantity to raaka it very
useful in tire arts. Bat Its alloy with
ing Chinese surrounding him. He went
Into the back room to prepare his in
struments for relieving Jung of the ppi
soa, and while doing so he heard a scuffle
in the room where lay the dying China
man. Immediately after the scuffle a
Chinaman rushed into the back room
flourishing a bloody knife and informed
the doctor that Jung had grasped the
knife and attempted to disembowel him
self.
Dr. Herschiser rushed to the poisoned
man's side and found a cut across the
abdomen which was, however, not deep
enough to' have any serious effect. He
could not understand how a man so inert
as the poisoned Chinaman could use the
knife on himself or. indeed, how he could
have come Into possession of the open
clasp-knife. He treated the Chinaman
for opium poisoning, but the deadly ef
fect of the drug was to far advanced.
Henry Chung, a commercial traveler for
a San Francisco firm, testified that he
knew the deceased well and that he was
not given to the use of opium. He also
said that he once saw a knife in the
pocket of the dead man, but he did not see
him cut himself nor did he see any other
Chinaman cut him. He said that Jung
Jheung never had trouble with anybody,
but was a peaceable man.
Dr. Herschiser testified that Jung died
from the effects of swallowing burnt
opium, of which there was a large quan
tity in the stomach. There was no evi
dence to show whether J\mg took the
poison voluntarily or whether it was ad
ministered to him. and the jury returned
a verdict of suicide.

A TEST OF NERVE.
"VTar talk started the trouble, says the
Detroit FreÂ» Press. The big man had
been holding forth to the loungers
In the country store and the little man
had wormed his way into the conversa
tion much to the disgust of the big man,
who taunted the little man with not hav
ing the nerve of a woman. Tnis promptly
brought forth from the little man a chal
lenge for a test of nerve, which the big
man condescendingly accepted.
â¢'What I propose," said the big man,
taking charge of the affair, as big m<-n
are wont to do. especially when a liitie
man is concerned, "is this: Sam yere
has got a keg of powder, an' I propose
that we put a lighted candle to hit an'
set down by hit. an' the one who sets
the longest has got the most nerve."
A murmur of admiration went around
the loungers at this bold proposition, but
the little man stuck up his nose and said:
"Guess I have got the choosin' of this
yere nerve test."
"All right, sonny, go ahead," answered
the big man. with a wave of his hand and
a smile of pity.
The little man turned toward the win
dow and gazed absently out in the direc
tion of the big man's house, while the big
man waited with a grin on his face.
Finally the little man arose and said:
"I'm ready fer thet thar nerve test."
The crowd followed them out doors,
where the little man promptly made for
a mud puddle and waded through and In
slated that the big man snould follow his
example.
Then he made for the big man's home
and threw open the kitchen door, and
was about to enter, when the big man
said uneasily:
"See yere, the ole woman has jest
mopped out in thar."
"Where's yer nerve?" sneered the little
man.
ihis brought the big man In with hia
muddy boots, and as they stood on the
newly" cleaned floor the little man said:
"Yer wife has Jes' gone across to the
neighbor's, 'cause I seed her, an' we'll Jts'
stand yere an' wait till she comes back,
and see who's got the most nerve."
The big man only grasped at this bold
proposition.
"She's comtn' frum thar now, an
nounced the little man from his position
near the window.
The big man moved uneasily from one
foot to the other, while the crowd grinned
in at the door.
"She's crossin' the road, said the lit
tle man.
Beads of perspiration were standing on
th<- tig man's face, but the little man was
calmiy chewing a straw.
"She's comin' In at the gate, an
nounced the little man. "She'll be yere
in " But the little man was alone, the
big man having fled.
Ar.d all the little man said as he wiped
his feet on the grass was:
"I know'd all the time thet he didn t hey
no nerve."
"But. ace yere," put in one of the loung
ers. "I don't see nothin' of his ole
woman."
"She's takin 1 a lot of eggs ter the mar
ket," chuckled the little man. "I saw her
go before we klm over yere."

"THE POOR MAN'S WALDORF."
The public for some time has lost sight
of the hotel built in New York by D. O.

means, sometimes called "the poor man's
Waldorf," berause it furnishes rather
luxurious quarters for the small sum of
25 cents per day for each room. The
project was conceived as a sort of philan
thropic enterprise â ami it in really phil
anthropic to emancipate men of cleanly
instincts and little money from the nÂ«

Mills declared at the <.jtpÂ«-t that he be-
I the hotel <-"uld be made to pay

vestment in addition, and his provision
has been amply Justified. The building
cost a little more than $1,000,000. Almost
from the time of opening the U64 bed
rooms have been occupied nightly, and
very often hundreds have been 'turned
away. Only six of the ten stores on
the ground floor have been rented up to
the present time. The restaurant was a

CIRCUS TAKES THE TOWN.
A Most Glittering Pageant and Brilliant
* Show.
WALLACE'S big circus, with its
glitter, its acrobats, its won
ders, clowns, wild men and
iron skulled freak, is in town.
Yesterday afternoon a gorgeous pa
geant traveled the streets and herald
ed its arrival. In the evening the in
itial performance was given and en-
Joyed by a sea of people that crowded
the vast tent to its fullest capacity.
Clear as Alpine horns the brazen
throats of trumpet* gave the signal
for the start of the parade at 2 o'clock
in the afternoon. Heralds clad in
medieval armor advanced and cleared
the way, then followed the gorgeous
cages that held from freedom beasts
of the jungle. Majestic elephants
from Asia, camels in droves, two white
as the sacred beasts that carried to
gether on the trackless desert the men
* of God centuries ago. were there. Then a kaleidoscope of color made By
* prancing horses, dainty ponies and a host of clowns and, last, the calliope,
* singing its siren song. The parade was the delight of thousands, and in the
* evening thousands more enjoyed the mar*>ls of the circus.
* The feats of the performers surpass the usual run, and the mirth
making clowns are always in evidence. The Nelson family, as gymnasts,
are the ben that ever visited this coa-st. From the sponsor of the flock, a
man of Herculean proportions, down
to the tiniest tot, a lad of tender years,
all are artists. The management of
the show challenges the world to pro
duce their equal, and doubtless the
challenge will stand for years to come.
Many of the features are new and
splendidly carried out. Trained ani
mals are in abundance, from the giant
elephant down to plump pug doge.
The closing feature of the circus,
the races on the big hippodrome, is the
most exciting. The chariot race, car
ried down from ancient days, never
ceases to excite the admiration of the
multitudes. At the conclusion of the
circus performance a concert, contain
ing many pleasing features, was given,
and then the crowds bade farewell to
the beasts and freaks of the sideshow,
and the first night of the circus was
at an end.

Charges His Wife With Attempting

Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Oct. 15.
An answer and cross-complaint were
filed to-day by Henry A. Howard in the di
vorce suit commenced by his wife some
months ago. Just a year ago Miss Nina
B. Marshall of this city married Howard,
who is a wealthy mineowner, and a
month later they separated under most
sensational circumstances.
Mrs Howard declares that her husband
has frequently, tried to take her life, and
that while in an Oakland hotel he was
only deterred from shooting her by the
knowledge that somebody was looking at
him from a window across the street. In
her complaint she declared thatwhile they
were enjoying their honeymoon and were
on a river steamer going to Stockton, her
husband threatened to throw her over
board aa he had already realized that
their marriage was a mistake.
Mrs. Howard declares that her husband
is worth $30,000 and she asks for $TÂ»<"k) cor.n
Â«el fees and generous alimony. While in
this city the Howards lived at 574 Thir
teenth street and at this place also it la
alleged Howard tried to end his wife's
llfo.
In his answer Howard tells a story
latter had always prided himself on his
familiarity with snakes, but the sisht of
one at that hour of the morning caused
him to retreat in haste to the region of
the cells below. In the meantime the man
from Denver was told to lift his pet from
the top of the desk and carry him out of
sight as quickly as possible.
Mr. Rodey explained that the snake was
harmless, and, to prove his assertion, he
wrapped It around his neck and stretched
himself out on the top of a steam radi
ator. â Chicago Chronicle.

quite as tragic and no less romantic. He
recites that soon after their wedding day
he learned that his wife was an undi

have been injured he charges her in his
cross-complaint with bigamy. He alleges
that he has positive proof of this fact
and he states that just one month after
the marriage the woman quietly got out
of bed while her husband slept, and turn
ed on the gas with an evident intention of
asphyxiating him. To protect herself It
is said that Mrs. Howard slightly opened
a window and laid near it. When Howard
awoke he detected the gas, jumped o:it
of bed, threw open the window, turned off
the gas and demanded an explanation,
which he says his wife thus expressed:
"I wanted to kill myself."
Howard alleges that this experience was
repeated the next night, only on the sec
ond occasion his wife went to another
room. He then fled to his mines at An

he has not been free even there from his
wife's actions. Tie alleges that in connec

GENERAL KELLY TRIES
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
THE INDUSTRIAL LEADER TAKES
POISON.
Rescued by a Woman's Presence of
Mmd â No Cause Assigned for
the Rash Attempt.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 15.
T. C. Kelly, who was once known as
general of the Industrial Army, tried to
end his life at Elmhurst yesterday by
taking carbolic acid. He was prevented
by the presence of mind of Mrs. Shreve,
who was in the Kelly home at the time
he made the rash attempt.
When Mrs. Shreve saw what Kelly had
done she promptly sent for Dr. Lynch,
who found that the labor leader had done
nothing more serious than burn his lips
and mouth.
Kelly has not been heard of for twb
years/and he has been living quietly with
his family at Elmhurst. Some time ago
he made a statement to the effect that he
had found that the "Industrial Army"
method of producing reforms is not the
most practicable. Since the return of the
general from his celebrated march to
Washington that ended when he reached
th< Mississippi, Kelly has returned to his
trade as a printer, and has been steadily
employed, being a first-class workman.
No cause is known for his desire to die.

CHARTER AMENDMENT
FAILS TO CARRY
OUTVOTED AT THE POLLS BY
A BARE MAJORITY.
The Measure tÂ« Provide Berkeley
With a Police Court Defeated at
the Special Election.
BERKELEY, Oct. 15.â The special elec
tion held to-day for the purpose of vot
ing upon an amendment to the city char
ter, providing for the establishment of
a local police court, resulted An the de
feat of the measure by a majority of 33.
The election was called by the Board
of Trustees in pursuance of a recent de
cision of the Supreme Court declaring
the Judiciary of the university town to
have been illegally constituted. An
amendment to the freeholders' charter
was accordingly proposed which complied
with the terms of the law. This was
submitted to the residents of the city
to-day, with the result stated above. As
a consequence Berkeley must go on, as
it has for the last four months, without
any means whatever of enforcing its mu
nicipal ordinances or of having law and
order properly maintained.
The voting in the different wards was
as follows:
"Ward. Total. For. Against.
First 160 87 73
Second 127 88 29
Third (a) 122 43 79
Third (b) 104 67 37
Fourth 85 37 48
Fifth 91 62 39
Sixth 73 5 68
Seventh 79 13 64
m 444 m
The figures show that the greatest op
; position was in West Berkeley, where in
i one ward only five votes were cast in its
favor. East Berkeley and South Berkeley
also had a balance against the measure.
City Attorney Brewton A. Hayne, when
seen after the returns were in, said the
amendment was defeated because it pro
vided that the Police Judge should be ap
pointed by the Board of Trustees instead
of elected by the people. "It is unrea
sonable to suppose," he explained, "that
the residents of the city could deliberately
outvote a measure which seeks only to
secure law and order In the community.
It is quite evident that they objected to
the appointive system which this amend
ment embodies. Personally I favor the
appointive system, and I know that the
Board of Trustees, the Good Government
Club and the North Berkeley Improve
ment Club all used their influence In its
favor. I feel confident that if the meas
ure had been framed so as to call for the
election of the Police Judge by the peo
ple It would have carried with scarcely
pointed. The candidate must have suffi
ciently advanced in education to be able
to pass a careful examination in reading,
writing, orthography, arithmetic, gram
mar, geography and history of the United
Sttaes. A boy who has had a high-school
education ought to have no difficulty in
passing the prescribed examination.

But what is hindering the rapid

they tell me that as soon as some one shall take the Initiative they will
turn such funds over to the syndicate In accordance with the five-year
loan system that is proposed. Since The Call first began the support of
the ferry project some of the San Francisco papers, particularly the Chron
icle and the Bulletin, have trk-d to throw cold water on the scheme; but
such tactics have done no harm other than to themselves. The people
here need this ferry, and the roads we have needed for years, and I am

that the people are inclined to be incredu

public that long-desired relief.
"What is far more important is the fact
that they freely express their opinions
as to the advantages to be derived from

their judgment with their money.
The interviews that follow will show
how deeply they are interested, as against
that class of the community in Oakland

Terrible
Speedily Cured By

My baby was about onr week? old when he
began to suffer from that terrible disease,
Eczema. I tried every remedy I thought
would do him good. I even called in tha
doctor who told me it would wear away in
time, but I used his medicine to no account. I
did not know what to do with him. He cried
all the time and his face was equal to a raw
piece of meat, it was horrible, and looked as
if there was never any skin on it. I bad to
carry him around on a pillow. I was fairly
discouraged. I was then recommended to use
Cuticcba Remedies. The first time I used
them I could see the change. I used about
half a box of Cdticuha (ointment), and not
one half cake of Ccticuba Soap, and at the
end of one short week my baby teas entirely
cured. There has never been a trace of it

idiotic here as to be unable to see tho
vasi benefit to be derived from the ope
ration of such a line. Competition is
what we want. It will be the making of
the city, and 1 have decided to invest in
the ferry enterprise. But what is hin
dering the rapid promotion of this laud
able scheme is the fact that there is a
bad spirit under the surface here â onÂ©
that by all manner of innuendo seeks to
destroy confidence in the syndicate that
Is proposing to build this ferry line. If
these people of the deadly tongue could
be properly silenced it would be much
easier to get the business under way at
an early date. I consider Frank M.
Smith, the president of the syndicate, as
the most enterprising citizen of Oakland,
and as he has built up a splendid car sys
tem out of chaos I am confident he could
make a success of the ferry.
CRAIGIE SHARP, secretary Oakland
Board of Tradeâ l am heart and soul with
this enterprise. Its completion would
mean millions to the people on this side
of the bay. If the city of Oakland would
bond itself for one million dollars to make
this enterprise a success it would prove
its greatest step for advancement. The
point selected for the location of the
ferry is the logical center of distribution
for this shore. I have personally examined
all the syndicate's lands, and find them
first clans, and I devoted two days to the
investigation of their streetcar lines.
They are in excellent shape, and we are
receiving better service than ever before.
If the people can be made to realize what
this movement means to them they will
be glad to give it most hearty support. I
regret to say that there is a certain
money-loaning element here that is act
ively antagonizing the enterprise. How
ever, the proposition will be placed prop
erly before the leading men of enterprise
in Oakland at an early date. The ferry
ought to be built, and if it is not it will
be the fault of the people of this city,
for these men mean business, and only
ask for reasonable treatment from our
people.
M. J. KELLER-I am in thorough sym
pathy with the ferry project, and have
been advocating the establishment of such
an enterprise for many years. Emery
ville is the proper point to~ centralize tne
bay passenger traffic of a good portion of
Oakland and Berkeley. The lines of . the
Realty Company -would reach out like a
fan to gather in the travel, and with the
right management they would be able to
give comfortable and rapid transit. I
have such faith in the project that I am
willing to invest in it when the proper
time comes. If the syndicate can satisfy
the people as to their exact intentions.â
make their proposition pLain â they vnll
doubtless receive substantial encourage
ment. That section between Oakland and
Berkeley must be settled up sooner or
later, and the fact that the establishment
of a minor business center at Emeryville
might divert some business in that direc
tion should not be brought forward as a
reason for opposing the enterprise.
WILLIAM R. DAVISâ The proposition
of the Realty Syndicate to establish a
competitive ferry is a worthy one and I
sincerely hope it will succeed. Their se
lection "of Emeryville for their landing
place is judicious. Taking their system of
car lines I should say that their main line
leading down to the ferry, for illustration,
could be considered the handle of an im
mense fan and the branches running to
Berkeley, Piedmont, Oakland, East Oak
land and Alameda the branches thereof.
These branch lines would be feeders cov
ering an extensive territory, much of

JF. STOERâ Mr. Stoer is the â

which is now sparsely settled, but which
would eventually, by reason of the estab

populated. One of the principal argu
ments in favor of this proposed ferry is
the fact that the people in the northern
and western part of Oakland and those
of Berkeley and intermediate points have
to come to the southern end of this city
before they can actually start in the di
rection of San Francisco. In other words,
they have to traverse one side of
a long triangle before they make
any progress. With this new line they
could save this extra time and travel and
thereby enjoy much more satisfactory
service. There is a field here for such an
enterprise, but it needs to be placed be

other victory for California; a lecture
from Cochran; strange words from the
lips of Pete Smith, and a score of 16â0
That Is the story of the football game
yesterday between the Athletic club and
the College men. Cochran was dissatis
fied at the meagerness of the score; Smith
was disgruntled at the absence of any
score for the Olympics, and, therefore,
Cochran lectured and Smith said some
thing that is not heard in polite society.
The game was the best seen this year,
due to the manifested strength of the
Olympics. In the two previous games
they were notoriously weak, but In the
match yesterday there was some show
of playing. Hobbs, the big and fleshy,
played left guard. It was his introduction
to football this season, as he had not
'trained a day, and went on without a
minute's notice. His playing, considering
the disadvantages under which he labored,
was surprisingly tine. Unassisted, he
would go through the California line
again and again, his muscles sore from
their unaccustomed exertions and his
wind in the worst possible condition.
Sheeny also played well, as did Bandy and
Erskine. In fact, the entire Olympic line
was incomparably stronger than in the
two preceding games.
The playing of the University of Cali
fornia team was not as full of da-sh and
spirit as was anticipated. Perhaps It was
due to the unexpected front in their way
to touchdown or a feeling of security. In
dividually, some very creditable work was
done. Kaarsberg played good baJl, kick
ing for substantial distances and occa
sionally pirouetting in the air for a flying
gyratory leap. Craig, on the California
left end, shone with brilliance. His going
down the field on kicks and his tackling
were splendid exhibitions of football.
The game was more interesting to the
spectators on acount of the abundance of
kicking on both sides. California gained
an inestimable advantage over its adver
saries by the superiority of Kaarsberg's
punting Percy Morse failed to cover dis
tance in his kicking, but this was all he
failed in. With but a week's practice, he
played his usual spirited game, bucking
the' line or running the ends lor persisi-
know of no better -way than to gather
them in a meeting, after the election is
over, and give them a comprehensive ex
planation of the project.

DELIBERATELY STRANGLED HIMSELF.
The body of George H. Williams,
a laborer, was found at half-past 8
o'clock yesterday morning in a
vacant lot at the intersection of
Eighteenth and Folsom streets.
Williams had tied a handkerchief
around his neck and the other end
to a piece of rope. This he had
knotted around one of the posts
of a cubical hollow frame used
when raising' houses. The frame .
to which the rope was tied was
about four feet from the ground,
and Williams threw himself down
and deliberately strangled him

ent grains and never faltering a moment.
Wilson, the other Olympic half-back, con
ducted himself becomingly, and Code was
in every play. Altogether, the match was
on a higher plane than any other of the
season.
In a very few minutes after the kick off
the blue and gold scored the first touch
down. GreiHberg shook himself out of the
pack on the Olympic thirty-five-yard
line, after appropriating the ball on a
fumble and ran right on until he was
forced ln-touch about eight yards from
the goal line. An offside play on the part
of the clubmen gave the blue and gold
live yards and then Hall carried the pig
skin over. No goal was kicked. Score
6-0. and the Olympics sad.
There was little of excitement in what
remained of the first half except toward
the very close when the Olympics ruffled
their own fur a bit and said to themselves
that they would do things. From their
own thirty-yard line by a succession of
bucks, end runs and smashings through
the left side of Berkeley's line, Morse,
Erskino, Sheohy and Hobbs advanced the
ball about forty yards toward the Cali
fornia posts. Then an interchange, of
punts followed and the whistle called an
end to the play for that half.
In the second half the Olympics, forti
fied by resolution and much water, de
termined to win out. At this they failed,
however. A few tries through the line
after the kick off and the ball dropped
into Morse's hands on the center Ifne.
Interchanges of punts were then in order
and then the Olympics did just what they
should never have done and what they
had been doing all through the gameâ

TWO TRANSPORTS HOME.
Zealandia and Pennsylvania Arrive
FTom the Philippines.
The transport Zealandia, which was so
badly battered by a typhoon on the 4th
of last month, arrived in port last night
and anchored off Melggs wharf to await
the quarantine officer, whose arrival was
anxiously watched for by those on board,
who were eager to get ashore.
Captain Dowdell reports an uneventful
voyage of 17 days 14 hours from Nagasaki,
but the excitement before that port was
reached was great enough to satisfy him.
The vessel left Manila on August 24, and
eleven days afterward she was struck by
the typhoon. Boats, ventTTators, railings,
deckhouses and everything movable were
carried away. The anchors broke loose,
and all on board were pretty badly shak
en up. The only person severely injured,
according to Captain Dowdell, was the
quartermaster. T. Cheathem, whose arm
was broken; but several of the firemen
were slightly scalded by a bursting steam
pipe. The Zealandia put into Nagasaki,
where she was overhauled at the drydock.
Lieutenant Elliott of the Baltimore, who
is going home on a furlough, and seven
sick marines bound for the hospital at
Mare Island, were the only passengers on
the troopship. The Invalid bluejackets
are: F. \V. Humphreys B. G. Owens, B.
J. Sjoberg and F. C. Craig of the Mc-
Culloch, J. C. Warner of the Petrel, H.
Boothby of the Boston and E. Caldwell
of the Baltimore.
On board the vessel were the remains of
the late T. K. Freeman, who committed
suicide while the vessel lay in Nagasaki
harbor, Japan. Just before the war broke
out he enlisted at Mare Island, and was
assigned as chaplain of the Baltimore.
Soon after the memorable engagement of
Manila bay Freeman's health began to

The Steamer F. M. Smith Runs
Aground on Her Way to Alviso.
The Alviso and San Jose stern-wheel
steamer F. M. Smith stuck in the slough
again Friday morning, and all efforts to
pull her out yesterday were unavailing.
She is badly strained, and Captain Denny
fears that she is so badiy damaged that
she will not float.
The channel of the creek is very nar
row, and when making her way up tho
slough the vessel struck the right bank
bow on. The atern swung around and
lodged on the other bank. When the tide
went out the steamer sagged and was
badly strained. The tug Annie was sent
up Friday night to pull the Smith out,
but even at high water was unable to do
so The Annie returned last evening, and
the Liberty, a light-draft tug, was sent
up to see if the Smith could be rescued
from her sad plight.
Shipping men believe that as the ves
sel could not be floated off. at high tide
it is very doubtful if she can be saved.
Friends of Humanity.
The Society of Friends of Humanity
will hold an open meeting at their head

ALICE RIX writes of the local in HUMAN HIDE.
IT was. as everybody who was there
a very swell wedding.
But the bride looked best in her
travel
She is a tailor's dream, born to
tweeds and fine linen, and in all
little mannish matters of dress comes in
before the b< ason, so that you can take
its forecast from her shirting?, belts and
ties.
Her rough, red English serge was cut
â with a zouave, open over a linen shirt,
and this was trimly belted with a nar
row leather belt. The little traveling
purse dangling from it was made of the
game leather. So was the dress suit

The Maid of H<^nor poked me deli
cately as the bride came down the
Btairs.
"How do you like it?" she whispered
mysteriously.
"Very smart," I said, wondering what
the mystery was about.
â The belt, you know, and all that, I
mean."
â¢ < 'h, as leather belts go, very much.
Don't you?"
The Maid of Honor shuddered.
â¢That's the awful part of itâ itâ it'sso
lovely for belts."

"She showed it to you before it was
made up. didn't she?"
"No/ 1 said. "She didn't."

the Maid of Honor was giggling
rically and did not hear me. Sec

tasn't she any feeling about it?"
"Oh, you know her!" said the, Maid
nor, laughing. "She'd wear any
thing that's swell. And, of course, it
is the swellest thing. I'm dying to
have my piece made up, but"â She

â¢A whole back." Baid the Maid of

â¢was a woman's and I think it's even
smoother than"â She looked at the
bride's dress suit case critically. "Yes,
It's smoother and it's a better color, a
darker tan. Maybe," she added, laugh
ing out wildly, "maybe she was a bru
nette."
I controlled a desire to shut my own
eyes here and faint decently. I had to
pinch myself to avoid this casualty and
also to be sure that I was I, and also,
again, that I might hear anything m.>re
the Maid of Honor might say.
She was saying at the moment that
it was harder to get women's skins than

pkirts daintily. "Just as many women
die as men, don't they?"
"I don't know," I said, faintly.
"And it must be just as easy to skin
themâ ugh!" She buried her little nose
in her bridesmaid's roses and smiled up
over them. "It's a sort of shuddery
fad, isn't it? Oh, she's going!"
The bride war in her mother's arms.
Her mother kissed and cried over her

TRAFFIC IN HUMAN HIDE
BY MEDICAL STUDENTS.
Used on Belts and Purses by Fashionable
Women.
PERSONS in this city are trafficking in the skins of human beings.
This gruesome information first reached The Call in the form
of a rumor, and Mrs. Alice Rix was detailed to investigate the
revolting charges. She found them all too true. Several reputa
ble firms make no secret of the part they play in the matter.
They find no difficulty in disposing of all articles they make, the de
mand exceeding the supply.
The skins are procured from medical students, particularly those
in attendance at certain institutions in this city, and who, under
the law, ,have access to the County Hospital and Almshouse. They
go so far as to look among the living for suitable specimens. If
they find their skins adapted for the purpose of making purses,
belts and other articles they are selected and so marked that they
may be readily recognized after death. The skins are handed over
to tanners and thence to the artisans, who fashion them into various
articles to be worn by the society people of San Francisco.
featured well-mannered and of placid
cou/itenance, gathered to Kiss and wish
a girl bride on her wedding way. if some
one ehould shriek out suddenly, "Her
belt is made of a dead man's skin:"
And then I wondered if everybody was
crazy except i.-.yself. And then I re
membered that this is the first sign of
insanity and lest I should go mad on
the spot, I. too, kissed the brideâ but
with my hands behind meâ and got
away out Into the sunshiny streets in
the sweet Indian summer weather
to leave my horrors behind me.
But every other girl I met
wore a leather belt, and Provi
dence, who takes care of all
such little matters, alone knows how
many persons were skinned and tanned
to make them, /.nd the horrors slept
with me through the night, and the
next morning, as early as was civil, I
called on the Maid of Honor, whom I
do not know very well and who looked
politely BurpriÃed to see me almost be
fore breakfast.
"I want awfully to get one of those
belts." (And may heaven forgive me
that one!) "And so I cameâ"
"Why, of course," she said. "You'd
like to see the skin?"
"Ye-es."
"Of course you know you'll have to
have your belt nu.de. You can't buy It
anywhere. I believe they're not al
lowed to sell itâ"
"Who?"
"MY FRIEND THE MEDICAL STUDENT WAS BENDING OVER THE CADAVER OF A MAN."
"Oh, students, medical students and,
I don't know, doctors, I suppose. Do
you know anybody you could get a
piece of skin from?"
"Not Without their noticing it," I
said.
"Don't you know any medical stu
dents or young doctors?"
"Why, yes, rafts."
"There you are, then!" said the Maid
of Honor. "That's all you want. Tell
them to look out for a good piece for
you. There's lots of difference, but I
don't know much about it except that
backs are the biggest. Wait. Come up
to my room and I'll show you my
piece."
She went lightly up the stairs before
me â a dainty little Dresden Shep
herdess figure In her flowered silk
matinee and lacy little pettipokes â and
on the landing turned an innocent,
flower-like face over her shoulder, so
small, so fair, of such white and pink
purity. She did not look like a girl
who would want to carry a grip cov
ered with the skin from a dead
woman's back. But, ah! you never can
tell.
I followed her into a room which, like
herself, had certain delicate Dresden
china effects. She dropped on the floor
beside a chiffonniere and pulled out the
lower drawer of it and stopped and
shrugged her shoulders with a little
shiver.
"Ugh!" she said. "I haven't looked
at it for ever so long."
"Perhaps," I said quickly, "you'd
rather not this morning."
"Oh, yes," she said, cheerfully, com
ing out of her shiver, "I don't mind. It
isn't a bit awful. It's Just the idea of
it." She took a bundle â quite a large
stiff bundle â from the drawer and
handed it to me. It was wrapped in
pink tissue paper.
"Open it, " she said.
I unrolled it slowly. A broad piece
of firm, tan-colored leather rolled stiffly
on my lap. I did not touch it. I felt
none of the horror I had expected to
feel when I looked at it, none of the
fearsome disgust. Still. I did not touch
it at first. When I did I marveled at
its board-like stiffness, its thickness
and the unlikeness of it to anything
suggesting human skin. And yet it
was human skin. It had been cut away
from a human body â a woman's body,
like my own, like that of the little
flower faced girl on the floor
â who was going to have a belt
and a purse and a dress suit case
made out of it some day. It had
fulfilled its manifold duties of protec
tion, absorption, repulsion. It had cov
ered nerves, blood, muscle, all the mys
tery of physical life. It had known sen
sation, heat, cold, pleasure, pain. It
had been caressed or perhaps abused.
It had responded as the skin responds,
or shrunk as the skin shrinks and it
had come in death to the tanner's vat
to be cured and colored and to lie
across the knees of one living woman
while another planned how it should
be cut to serve her for a gawd.
"You see, it's a beautiful piece! So
smooth â and isn't it a fine color?"
She stretched out her hand for it and
I let it go. She fingered it almost ca
ressingly. She seemed to have forgot
ten anyway to shudder over it.
"There's enough," she said, "for a
small trunk. She must have been im
mense!"
"I thinK I must go," I said, rising
quickly.
She scrambled to her little feet. The
woman's skin fell to the floor. She
pushed it aside and stepped over it
lightly on her way to the door.
"Oh," I said, stopping at the head of
the stairs, "whom do you get to make
up these things?"
"Shreve." -
"Have you any belts of skin?" I asked
across the leather counter at Shreve's.
"Beg pardon?" said the clerk on the

"Skin."
"Pnakeskin, madam?"'
"No."
"Pigskin, madam?"
"No."
"Calf? or monkey? or elephant skin?
Monkey is about the newest."
"Is it the very newest?"
"I beg pardon?"
"Isn't there anything newer?"
"Not that I know of, madam."
"I understood," I said, desperately,
"that human skin was being worn this
season."
"Oh, yes," replied the clerk com
posedly. "We're making up some human
skin belts, but more purses and card
cases than belts."
"Doesn't it make â "
"Strong belts? Oh, yes, it's a very

more of a demand for purses. I dare

able, then?"
"I think so, yes."
"And the purses and card cases, have
they been for men or for women?"
"Oh. ladies, nearly always. You know
ladies like all such little oddities. We
use some silver or gold in the trim
ming or a special design. We made
up a purse for a young lady of the Red
Cross Society not very long ago, and
she wanted it fastened with the
regular Red Cross design. It looked
very neat."
"You could furnish the skin, I sup
pose?"
The clerk hesitated. "You'd better
get your own skin " he said. "We'll
have it tanned for you or tell you
where to take it to have it tanned."
"Here in the cvty?"
"Oh, yes. There's a man down here
on Market street. Wegener of the Vi
salla Stock Saddle Company, who
handles it, and then there's the Novelty
Leather Company over on Montgomery
avenueâ 2lÃ Montgomery avenue. I
think they may have something made
up to show you."
"Thank you. You don't think they
would mind?"
"Mind?"
"Admitting that they do the work?"
"Why, no," replied the clerk. ""Why
should they?"
Mr. Wegener of the Visalia Stock
Baddle Company had nothing made up
in human skin to show me. He said
he wished he had. He said he could
sell all the purses and card cases and
belts and satchels he could make. He
said he would like a few samples to put
in his window. The trouble was to get
the skin. He did not think it could be
bought. All he had handled had come
to him from Shreve & Co., or had been
brought in by young doctors
and medical students who wanted
a purse or a belt or something
made up to give away to their girl
friends. He said he could not tell off
hand just how many orders he had
filled in the last year, but it had been
a good many. Yes, it made very hand
some belts, he thought, "especially the
black skin."
"When it's tanned black?"
"No, when it's born black. Coons."

"Would you like It with the fur on?"
asked the manager of the Novelty
Leather Company.
"I â I hadn't thought," I replied,
feebly.
"We've got a sample here â let's have
that human skin sample out there! One
with the hair on! â There! That's a poor
piece of work. That's no tanning at
all. That's just been stretched out on
a board and oiled and dried, and it
made a poor Job. We made a card case
â a gent's card case â out of that, and it
was a miserable greasy-looking thing
when it was finished, although we took
a lot of pains with it. You can see for
yourself, there's no style to that."
There certainly was not. There was
only a hideous idea, a terrible, ghastly
association to mark It from the com
monest, coarsest hide that ever hair
grew on. And hair grew on thisâ alight,
strong, wiry hair of a peculiar bright

it bristled, stiffly curling, with fearful
likeness to life. I sickened as I looked.

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
AS VIEWED BY CHURCHMEN
Discussed fron) seven standpoints in the church body.
IS marriage a divine institution, or only a civil
contract of human origin? Does the marital re
lation end with death, or is the perfect consum
mation of marriage found only in celestial wed
lock? Is divorce an offense in the sight of God
and a curse to human society, or is it essential to the
harmonizing of social conditions?
These are questions that have never been answered
to the complete satisfaction of society in general.
The views of several of the various religious bodies*
are here given as an entertaining medley of opinion
upon the subject of marriage and divorce:

This concise and positive law, if adopted, will be
substituted for the law that now obtains and which
provides that the innocent party to a divorce for the
cause of infidelity may receive the rites of marriage.
The committee is composed of Bishops Doane of
Albajiy, Dudley of Kentucky, McLaren of Chicago,
Potter of New York, Parent of Maryland, Burgeas of
y and thirteen ministers and laymen. But the
committee is not unanimous in the demand for this
radical revision of the canon on divorce. Bishop Pot
upported by four other members of the com
mittee, proposes a moderate revision which permits
the marriage of the innocent party to a divorce on
ground of infidelity, but makes obligatory the fur
nishing of a certified copy of the record of the court
granting the divorce.

follow. God has said that but one thing will inter

in the resurrection "they neither marry nor are given

subject of divorce he said:
"The Bible, which is the only moral standard, gives
but one ground of divorce; all divorce laws that con
travene this law are iniquitous and demoralizing to
the individual and the community. The divorce laws
of this State are monstrous.

that marriages are contracted in heaven. The mean

experience gained while wedded to matter. Souls are
brought together, not by blind chance, but an intel

the marital relation.
Rev. Nam Art, Chinese pastor of the Presbyterian
Mission, said that during the twenty years he lived
in his native land he knew personally of only one
case of divorce. It is a social condition almost un
known there, though polygamy is common, particu
larly among the rich in the cities. The Chinese be
lieve that in the future life only the last surviving
husband or wife is entitled to the marital relation.
But Nam Art, since he has adopted the Christian
religion, has no future marital aspirations. Death,
he contends, ends the marriage state, and divorce is
a condition he does not tolerate.

Father John Brennan, assistant

said, the opinion of one priest is
standpoint:
"There is no doubt that there
is a celestial marriage, and if
properly and thoroughly under
stood it embodies a great truth â
"As we believe that harmoniouÃ
and happy marriage Is the expres
sion of nature's highest and di
vinest law and the highest means
of progress in development of the
vorce, renouncing the polygamous
marriage that obtains in China,
discountenancing divorce, and
adopting the Protestant and
Catholic belief that death ends
man, paying their fare just like any
common individual. But about six
months ago Claus Spreckels determined
that California should possess not
only the finest private ear in the State
but the finest in the United States,
which is practically saying . the whole
world. For in no other country has
the art of car-building, reached such a
pitch of development. European sov
ereigns travel in cars far less comfort
able, far less splendidly equipped, than
those owned by private American citi
zens.
So Claus Spreckels sought out Carl
ton C. Crane, the Pacific Coast agent
of the Wagner Palace Car Company,
and gave carte blanche for the finest
palace on wheels which art could de
sign or , skill construct. The Wagner
Company went to work and devo.ted all
its energies to the creation of a mas
terpiece. Though Wagner cars do not
run on the Calif ornian lines, every one
who has been East has noticed the
magnificently equipped- trains which
run over the Vanderbilt roads. The
Lake Shore Limited, which runs be
tween Chicago and New York, is said,
indeed,, to be the finest train in the
world. The Wagner works â¢at " East
Buffalo, New York, are equipped with
every appliance for turning out work
of the highest class. â 
Consequently Claus Spreckels' mag
nificent order had every chance of
proper execution. Indeed,. me presi
,dent of the Wagner Company, Dr. .W.
Seward Webb, gave his personal at
tention to the matter, determined that
the .Wagner- Company should, not â¢ be
.eclipsed by its rivals. The result is
to be seen to-day at the Oakland mole,
and hundreds of passengers to and
from the city pause daily in their rush
for the boat to gaze at this dream of
luxury. / The mere size of the car alone
attracts attention, for it is 65 feet long
and 9 feet S inches wide. It bears on
its side, in gilt letters, the name Sprec
kels, and the lahel-of the San Francisco

pany. .; : v;:^irh^
"That is just to give the car a local
habitation," said Mr. Crane, as he did
the honors of the palace, "for, of course,
it belongs to Mr. Bpreekels, and not to
the railway company."
Inside the arts of the upholsterer and
decorator, the cabinet maker and
French polisher have been carried to
their highest limits. To give a de
tailed description of the car would be
simply to set down a catalogue of beau
tiful and costly things. The whole of

How many millionaires are there in
the world?
A commonly accepted estimate place 3
the number of men in this country
owning 51,000,000 or more each at be
tween 4000 and 5000. In the world at
large there must be from fifteen to
twenty times as many, by no means
confined to the more civilized races.
JÂ»erhapÃ there are 100,000 in all, though
this may be doubtful.
For instance, India is full of native
millionaires. Not only the great num
ber of Indian Princes, with their fabu
lous hoards of state jewels, must be
reckoned in the list, but there are many
millionaire merchants in the cities. The
great Parsee houses of Bombay have
as good credit as any merchants in the
worid, and their heads ai-.- fubulously
wealthy, although, like all the "warm"
men of the East, they live very hum
bly.
For In one-half of this globe, it must
be remembered, the richer a man is the
more ragged his clothes, the more
.squalid his house. This device does not
save him from frequent robbery by his
rulers, or even in pome eases from mur
der. Turkish and Persian millionaires
are not good life insurance risks, yet the
Jews of Damascus and Teheran and the
'in-eks of Smyrna include many who
could measure wealth with the smaller
American nabobs.
In Egypt wealthy men are able to dis
play their riches freely. Alexandrine
Greeks and Cairene Copts and Jews are
often immensely wealthy. Even in Mo
rocco, Nahon the banker must be sev
eral times a millionaire under foreign
protection, and there are others in in
land towns whose wealth is great.
The great Chinese merchants have as
fine a commercial reputation as the
Parsees. Not alone in China, but In
Hongkong, the Straits Settlements and
even in Burraah they include in their
number many men of vast fortunes. In
Japan millionaires are yet compara
tively few, but are rapidly increasing in
number.
In bie 1 Russia millionaires are prob
ably fewer than in little Holland where
immense wealth is derived from the
colonial trade. France has shoals of
millionaires. Germany, once poor. Is
rapidly gaining immense wealth in
shipping, trade and manufacture, and
her rich men are already legion. Aus
tria and the Balkan states have many
great fortunes. Italy's old rural prop
rietors of proud family are mostly
"land poor," but her merchants, ship
pers and manufacturers are shrewd
and well provided with money. The
trade of the Mediterranean is largely in
Italian hands.
New millionaires swarm in South Af
rica and Australia, because of the void
discoveries and the diamond mines of
the Kimberley region. Mexico, the Cen
tral and South American states and
Canada have together perhaps two
thousand. Even bleak Newfoundland
has one, and he one of the most re
markable in the lot, the famous "Czar
Reid."
Finally It must not be forgotten that
Great Britain alone has many more
small millionairesâ men from $1,000,000
to $5,000,000, who live quietly and unos
tentatiouslyâthan the United States.
Such modest wealthy men are not few

GREAT QUESTIONS
GROWING OUT OF THE WAR
Discussed by Senator Allison of lowa and Senator Lodge of Massachusetts.
Special to The Sunday Call.
NO change in the war tax is likely to be made
at the coming session of Congress," said Sen
ator \V. l:. Aijison, in discussing the big ques
tions of the war. "We don't know how much
money the Government is going to need and
we shall not know before the session of Congress
ends. Besides I don't know anything from which
the tax ought to be taken. Certainly not from beer
or tobacco."
"How about the tax on checks and telegraph mes
sages and express packages?" I asked. "Those are
the features of the new law which cause inconveni
ence to the greatest number of people."
"And those are the taxes easiest to collect and
surest," said the Senator. "We shall not touch them."
"Not even at the extra session in the spring?"
'I think not. I don't believe there will be any
change in the tax law tor a year anyway."
"Do you think the war taxes will be made perma
nent?" Â, .
"It is likely that some features of the law will be
retained. Suppose we annex Cuba and Porto Rico
and the Philippines. That will admit free sugar and
a number of articles from which we now derive a
large revenue. We must make up the deficiency in
some way. The taxes levied in the war revenue bill
are now bringing in about half of the twenty-five to
twenty-eight millions a month which the treasury is
receiving."
1 called the Senator's attention to the attacks on
the war revenue law which Senator Jones, chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, is making.
"Jones says we are taxing the consumer," said Mr.
Allison. "The people to whom he is appealing are
nut the people who send many express packages or
telegrams or sign many checks. Yet these are the
three taxes which bear most on individuals. Of
course we expect the Democrats to criticize the law."
Senator Allison said he did not believe the army
scandal was going to have any weight in the coming
election. He said if mistakes had been made in the
army administration the people were not going to hold
the Republican party responsible for them.
"Out in my State, lowa," he said, "the Democratic
party is making Its fight along the old linesâ free sil
ver, free trade, anti-trust and so on."
"Then the silver issue is not dead?"
"Not at all. If the Democrats got into power they
would pass a free silver law. They are pledged to It,
That is still the issue. They have failed to get up a
party division on the subject of expansion and for
all that any one can tell now the issues of 1896 will
be the issues of the Presidential election or 1900."
I saw Senator Lodge at his beautiful home over
looking the sea at Nahant. Part of his property was
used for a time by the War Department as a coast
signal station because the Senator's grounds border
the cliff at the extreme end of the point of land on
which Nahant stands. The location is almost ideal
In its picturesqueness. The Senator's house stands
back a little way from the cliff on the highest point
of ground, commanding a view of the ocean on three
sides. When I called the Senator was in the act of
receiving a Spanish flag taken from one of the ships
destroyed at Santiago, which a grateful constituent
serving on the New York had brougnt to him from
Cuba. The presentation was brief and then the Sen
ator showed me Into his cozy little sun parlor on
the south side of his house and talked with me about
the new immigration problem that confronts us.
I asked Senator Lodge, if he believed any modifi
cation of the immigration laws was needed to cover
the new colonial conditions.
"The problem has not presented itself to me be
fore," he said, "but I should say that when we annex
Porto Rico to the United States a Porto Rlean be
comes a citizen of this country and can come and
go as he likes in any part of it."
"It is possible, then, for our employers, Jf they
chose to do so, to bring as much cheap contract labor
as they like from Porto Rico after it has passed
under the control of the United States?"
"I think we shall have very little to fear in*that
direction in Porto Rico," Baid the Senator, with a
laugh. "I see the price of hack hire there has gone
up from $1 an hour to $3 alread/. The Porto Ricans
in the first place are not likely to want to come to

The dining-room or parlor comes
next, quite a large apartment, occupy
ing the whole width of the car and ex-
ding for a length of fifteen feet. The
table, laid with silver and damask, "will
seat half a dozen people comfortably.
There is a miniature sideboard and
wine cooler. No requisite for delicate
dining has been forgotten. The ebony
cook, grinning with pride, exhibits his
ewnpact little kitchen at the other end
of the car. It is furnished with a most
ingenious range, pots and pans and
kettles without numberâ in short, a
complete batterie de cuisine.
"I can cook a full course dinner here
for at least twenty people," he ex
claims with professional enthusiasm as
he goes over th details.of his domain,
where everything is ready to hand,
stowed away Inn marvelously small
space In another compartment is a
this country in great numbers, and if they did they
would very quickly adjust themselves to our scale
of wages. Many of the foreigners who come to thi\
country are willing: to work for a few cents a day at
home, but they want full American wages when they
come here."
I quoted what ex-Minister Denby had said to me
recently, that if China became a competitor of the
United S.ates in manufactures Chinese skilled latmr
would rise to the earning level of ours.
"Not immediately," said the Senator, "but I have
no doubt it would in time. The Chinese contract
laborers of Hawaii, of course, will not be permitted
to enter this country as a result of annexation. That
labor was excluded under the treaty; no more Chinese
laborers can come to Hawaii and I have no doubv
the very able commission now investigating Hawaiian
government will provide for the continuance of thav
provision until at the expiration of the contracts the
Chinamen are returned to their native land."
"And how about the ten million people of the
Philippines, if we assume that those islands may be
come a part of the United States?"
"In that case," said Senator Lodge. "I have no
idea that any of the natives would want to come to
this country. And if they did I don't believe they
could stand the climate. However, I do' not care to
discuss the Philippines even on a supposition, because
I am a member of the Senate committee which will
have to consider the treaty now being negotiated in
Paris. The Philippine question is in the hands of the
Peace Commissioners and should be left there. I have
no idea what the instructions of the commissioners
were. In fact I don't believe any one in this country
except the President and his Cabinet knows. Public
sentiment on the subject? I don"t care to diacusa
even that. In fact I don't want to say anything
about the Philippines, one way or the other."
Senator Lodge said his bill for the amendment of
the immigration laws which was once vetoed by
President Cleveland would probably pass the House
at the coming session of Congress. It has already
passed the Senate. It applies the reading and writ
ing test to all immigrantsâ requires them to read an
extract from the constitution picked out at random.
"I never could see much in the objections of Mr.
Cleveland," said the Senator, "but one reason he gave
for vetoing the bill has been removed. That part of
the law relating to Canadian laborers has been elimi
nated. It never should have been in the bill. It
â was put there in the House at the request of Mr.
Corliss of Michigan. Coming at a trme when so many
Americans were going into the Klondike it would
have invited retaliation."
Senator Lodge said that there was a strong feel
ing in Massachusetts in favor of the bill and that it
â would undoubtedly be indorsed by the Republican
convention of the State.
I asked the Senator what he expected Congress to
accomplish at its next session.
"We shall pass the appropriation bills, and I sup
pose the bill for the government of Hawaii reported
by the commission now there and a Nicaragua canal
bill."
"The Nicaragua canal bill now pending or one that
will 'eliminate Warner Miller and his outfit,' as Sena
tor Teller suggests?"
The Senator smiled. "The trouble with that plan,"
he said, "is that the Warner Miller outfit owns all
the concessions down there. However, I don't know
in what form it will be, but that a Nicaragua canal
bill will pass at the coming session I feel reasonably
sure. Congress will appropriate liberally for the army
and navyâ of that there is no doubt."
"Do you expect an extra session of Congress, as
Senator Allison predicts?"
"Senator Allison is a very wise man. I hope, how
ever, that there will be no extra session."
"You don't expect the regular session to make pro

His early adventures with the Dervishes, his daring attempt to rescue "Chinese" Gordon penned up in Khartoum and why he issued his fan>ous order, "Kill all wounded Dervishes."
BY HERBERT V- G. AVORRELL, Who Served With r|in>
"When Major General Sir Herbert Kitchener, then a brevet-major,
made his first expedition up the Nile in 1884 to rescue General Gordon
at Khartoum, one of his staff interpreters was Herbert G. V. Morroll,
a brother-in-law of Sir Walter Mlevelle, lately retired chief of the
Health Department in Cairo and a Pasha. Mr. Morrell, who is on iii.*
way back to the Soudan, gives an interesting account of Kitchener
when he was a Junior offiesr and first displayed the qualities, destned to
make him an epochal character.
THE first time I saw Major Kitch
ener, said Mr. Morrell, was in
18S3, on the piazza of the Abdin
Palace at Cairo. There was a
great reception in progress.
Tewfik Pasha was then Viceroy.
As you know, Egypt being a potentate
of Turkey is permitted to be governed
by a Turkish Viceroy, who acts in all
ways as a sovereign and holds undis
turbed sway, providing he pays up the
yearly subsidy to the Sultan. Tewfik
â¢enjoyed the position immensely, was
an All around good fellow and fond of
the English.
On the day in question he had ar-
ranged to distribute medals in com
memoration of the last campaign un
der Sir General Graham, V. C, in
whose expedition I was. This cam
paign was considered a victorious one,
though the heat was so terrible that we
could" not pursue usman Digna to the
hills, and did not bring him to a last
stand.
. It was made up of Englishmen en
tirely, the two principal troops being
the Tenth Hussars and the Forty-sec
ond Highlanders, known as the "Black
Watch," a regiment which had cap
tured more standards than any other
In existence.
The medal was a bronze one, with the
legend Tel-el-Kheber engraved on it.
I had just received mine and was look
ing it over in the corner of the piazza,
whfjn some one said: "Young man,
that's a fine medal. You ought to be
proud of it. The Widow don't fdrget
the boys out here."
I turned and saw a very dapper look
ing officer 'a ho interested me considera
bly, because while all the others were
either crowding around where the cer
emonies were taking place, or else
engaged in light conversation with the
ladiesâ for all the best Bociety in Cairo
was there â this man was studying a
well-thumbed little Arabic volume
which contained selections from the
Koran.
At that time he had much the same
personal appaerance aa now. He was
about five feet ten inches in height,
well proportioned, lithe and of won
derful endurance. His heavy dark
mustache concealed a firm mouth and
juare chin and small piercing
biack eyes attracted one and made you
wish to know more of him.
I was but 17 years old then, but
Arabic well, and in a few mo-
Major Kitchener, who intro
duced himself to me, began to converse
In that language. It is most unusual
for an Englishman to speak this
tongue, for it is difficult and few can
themselves to it or have the per
sistence to pursue the study of It.
1 ha.l the advantage of living in
Mil,, pic for a number of yearÂ«,
whither I went with my father, a ma
jor in the Dragoon Guards, who became
a Khaiman Mackan Bey, or full colonel,
in Osman Pasha's army. He and I
landed at Alexandria at the same time
with Kitchener, who came from India
when hostilities broke out in Egypt in
1882. Kitchener was connected witi the
Intelligence Department and told me hi
our first conversation that he had been
(studying Arabic for a year. He could
then read and write it fluently. He
was very proficient in Hindostanee
also and soon picked up the Egyptian
dialects.
On several occasions when working
in the neighborhood of Gezhiren, where
the pyramids are situated, we met Ma
jor Kitchener either promenading up
and down in front of a pyramid with
his hands behind his back or sitting
down absorbed in a book. At othftr
times I saw him at the Boulac Museum
poring over old parchments and hand
ling the relics of Rameses 11, for whom
he entertained a high respect. From
this you may know that Kitchener is
a weil posted Egyptian scholar, for
what he learns he does not forget. It
was while talking in the museum to
some brother officers that an Arab run
ner came with the news that Hicks
Pasha and his command had been be
trayed by the guides and assassinated.
"Poor beggars," muttered Kitchener,
with an oath. "It was a death trap.
When will the English Government
learn that we are not fighting fanatics,
but men who have a species of thirst
for death. It will take an expedition
perfected in drill and with a tropical
commissariat to do any good with such
an enemy."
The next expedition was that of
General Baker. It was made up of local
troops most deficient in carriage and
arms. Most of the men had not fired
a shot in years. I remember the eve
befdre they started when General Baker
and some of his staff were sitting on
the veranda of Shepard's Hotel in Cairo
talking of the expedition. Major Kitch
ener was there also and while the oth
ers talked very sanguinely he main
tained absolute silence.
In the company was an English
Hebrew, Mr. Ornstein, held In high es
teem there and since knighted by the
Queen. "I will have to disagree with
you there, general." he said to Baker
after one of the latter's happy prophe
cies. "For all the good that your expe
dition of native troops will do, you
might as well remain sitting on this
veranda."
"I do not expect to see any of them
return alive," observed Kitchener in a
low tone to Mr. Ornstein. History tells
how Baker's command was all cut up
and the native troops became panic
stricken. General Baker, with his pri
vate secretary alone, escaped to the
Government boat at Suakim, the prin
cipal port in the Soudan littoral.
After this failure came the expedition
led by Sir Gerald Graham, in which Mr
Morrell took part as staff interpreter
It returned with its mission only half
accomplished, and all eyes were then
in the spring of 1884, turned toward
Khartoum, where that brave martyr
General Gordon, was besieged by the
Mahdi.
"Kitchener was a great admirer of
Gordon," Mr. Morrell continued, "and
could not conceal his anger at Glad
stone for his treatment of the hero,
which he characterized as "rude and
unkind."
He, Kitchener, was looked up to as
the most capable man to lead the expe
dition to rescue Gordon, though there
were many officers on the spot superior
in him in rank. No one general had
supreme command, because Wolseley,
Graham and the other well-known
leaders had cleared out, so the Intelli
gence Department had the organizing
of the affair.
Kitchener had by this time made him
self Invaluable to the department. He
was thoroughly acquainted with the
customs of the Arabs and had made
personal friends with many powerful
Sheiks.

TriE END OF MAHDISM : THE DEAD YAKUB AND HIS FOLLOWERS BESIDE THE
KHALIFA'S BLACK FLAG.
From a Sketch by a Correspondent of the Illustrated London News.
The Finest Heroic Display in the Dervish Ranks Was Made by the Khalifa's Brother, the Emir Yakub, Who With His
Followers Gathered in a Dense Mass Round Their Standard and Proudly Faced the Leaden Hail. As Yakub Expired, Several
of His Wounded Bodyguard Raised Themselves and Fired at Our Men. They Were Promptly Despatched. Slatin Pasha
Witnessed the Death of His Old Enemy and Captor, Yakub, Who Recognized Him.
"The local Governors were mostly
rich Turks," said Mr. Morrell. "They
were nominated from Constantinople
and their subjects were held in abso
lute servitude. Slavery flourished, too,
and knowing the English had forbidden
this, the Turks were loth to allow a
white man in their homes.
"With Kitchener it was different. He
was welcomed always with a broad
smile, and it is the same to-day. When
Kitchener enters an Arab tent he is
very careful to observe all the pro
prieties and speak the figurative flow
ing language peculiar to the Arabians.
"He first salams respectfully and then
says: 'Salam allakum' ('With you be
God.') The Sh*k answers with an in
clination of his head: "Allakum el
salam' ('God be with you.') What the
Arabs consider as a great Joke on
Kitchener, and a saying that always
calls for a laugh at the expense of the
g-eneral, is another of these amenities
â¢which, translated, means: 'May you be
the sire of many sons.' General Kitch
ener is unmarried and will probably
remain a bachelor all his life, so that
the Arabs consider it about the funniest
thing possible to greet Kitchener with
this legend.
"Kitchener then had charge prac
tically of the Gordon relief expedition,
and if he had had his own way Gordon
might have been saved. We reached
Khartoum just about seventy hours
after the massacre, and Kitchener was
so sorry and enraged over this that he
almost shed tears."
"We got away from Cairo in April,
1884. The other expeditions had made
their way through the Soudan, but
Kitchener planned to go up the Nile in
order to reach Khartoum more readily.
For this purpose we were provided
with canoes specially built in Canada
and paddled by Canadian frontiers
men. The canoes varied from twenty
feet to sixty feet in length and ha?
turned ux> ends after the style of the
Indian boatF. The largest ones were
twelve feet wide and they could accom
modate forty men beside the paddlers.
"Along the banks of the Nile followed
the commissariat, the heavy baggage
and the horses. The Tenth Hussars
and Egyptian cavalry Kitchener pick
ed out especially for the expedition and
camels he used to transport the com
missariat.
"It was in providing unusually good
rations for the men that Kitchener
made his first hit, and his determina
tion to have the men well fed in a hot
tropical climate is responsible in great
part for his wonderful success. He is
always as careful of his commissariat
as though the camels were carrying
precious stones.
"Every morning at 10 o'clock he is out
to see to the details of giving out the
stores, and any sergeant who makes a
complaint about food always receives a
hearing. Kitchener laid in a supply of
things which we had never been treat-
Ed to before. He got tinned beef made
in Chicago, cheese, condensed milk,
curry and rice, and all along the route
bought fresh vegetables. Every man
received one pound and a half of bread
and one pound of meat a day, coffee
for dinner and tea at night. If some
big chap swore he hadn't enough
Kitchener would give orders to 'feed
him more.'
"Kitchener was still a brevet major,
out the soldiers looked upon him as a
general, and he attracted more atten
tion than any other officer. It was my
duty to go ahead with the guides and
interview the Sheiks. The job was fu'l
of danger, and hardly a day passed
that Major Kitchener did not appear in
our company and ride alongd He had
two horses then, both full-blooded
Arabians. He called the smaller one
Said and a heavy roadster he named
Mohammed. He gave them these
names, as he frankly explained to us,
in order to make himself popular with
the Sheiks. His reputation soon spread
on account of this consideration which
he showed for the natives, and he was
the guest* of honor whenever we enter
ed a Sheik's tent. The seats in these
tents run around three sides. In the
center sits the Sheik and the one whom
he intends to honor is seated lust to
the right. It was an eye-opener to
most of the men to see Kitchener
squatted on the divan chatting in
Arabic.
"He is also popular with these chaps
because he is inordinately fond of
smoking lacome or the cigarette called
Turkish Delight. One hardly ever sees
Kitchener without a cigarette in his
mouth. He is also fond of smoking the
nargileh or Turkish pipe, and never re
fuses the proffered bowl. It is an old
proverb that when salt is eaten with an
Arab you are his friend for life, and
Kitchener never refused to make friends
in this way, although ordinarily he eats
but little. He says the less he eats the
better he works, and I certainly never
saw a soldier who could endure so
much. Rarely on an expedition does
he sleep more than five or six hours out
of twenty-four, and the rest of the time
he can be continually in the saddle
without showing fatigue."
One of the most strikingly interest
ing incidents of this march related by
the interpreter to illustrate Kitchener's
unusual characteristics was the follow
ing: When the expedition got as far
as Assouan a quarrel broke out among
the natives in the commissariat depart
ment. This was made up of two dis
tinct camel corps, one from Aden, con
sisting of Somalis, the fine breed of
Arabs who live in Aden; the other of
Egyptians from Cairo and Alexandria.
At the first encampment bad blood
broke out. The contention as to who
were the most proficient in camel driv
ing was heightened by the alleged pref
erence which was shown to the Aden
ites by the English. Finally the So
malis challenged the Egyptians to a
fair fight to see who were the most
valiant.
"The Egyptians refused the contest.
I was one of the interpreters who re
ported the matter to Captain Wilson, in
charge of the commissary. The next
morning Major Kitchener himself came
into the camp and ordered the Teme
dar (head groomsman) of the Adenites
and the Sheik of the Egyptians to pre
sent themselves. He heard the two
sides of the grievance, and then, turn
ing quickly, commanded the Sheik and
twenty of the foremost Egyptians to be
bastinadoed for cowardice. There was
the greatest excitement in camp, but
no one dared to revolt when those
piercing eyes followed up the order.
About twenty of those who refused to
fight were tied on boards and rattan
canes given to as many of the Aden
ities, and, to use the interpreter's exact
language, "They jolly well bastinadoed
the Egyptians' feet off." Some of them
were so belabored that they could not
walk for weeks, their feet being cut and
swollen, but it stamped out all coward
ice in the army."
Kitchener is a martinet in tHe ob
servance of rules and is severe in pun
ishing-. He comes down rather heavily
on drunkenness, and for this reason
has made himself to a certain extent
unpopular with some of his soldiers.
Rogers, his body servant, is a tee
totaler, which is an exceedingly rare
thing to find ii* the ranks of Tommy
Atkins. "Kitchener's cure for drunk
enness" is a by-word among his men.
Once taken it is never forgotten. The
culprit is togged out in full marching
equipment, which is a matter of sixty
pounds, and is then compelled to carry
in each hand a bag of shot weighing
fifty pounds. A sergeant and a guard
are put over the victim to see that ha
does not stop walking or drop the shot.
A man is sometimes kept at this "shot
drill" for six hours.
Another severity which called down
unpleasant comments on Kitchener was
his order "Kill the wounded Dervishes."
England heard of this with horror, but
the British soldiers were loud in their
praises. Kitchener had seen how these
Dervishes, after being wounded, would
lie quiet on the battlefield, concealing in
their clothes a pistol or scimitar-shaped
knife. When the ambulance corps'and
surgeons came out on the field to give
aid to the wounded enemy these fel
lows would wriggle out through the
heaps of slain and give a last thrust or
put a bullet in a nurse or doctor. At
other times they would hamstring a
horse, and in this way disabled nearly
the whole "Black "Watch." Kitchener's
order is carried out to this day. It was
the soldiers' only protection.
"There were 8000 men in that first ex
pedition." continued Mr. Morrell, "and
they moved along like clockwork. The
Canadians were expert at shooting the
rapids, and could have made splendid
time. But our orders from London
were to proceed at eight and ten miles
a day. Kitchener was for pushing for
ward in spite of orders. 'God,' he would
exclaim, 'poor Gordon will be murdered
just because of a lot of fogheads at
home.' Every day or two a runner
would reach camp after making hia
way through the Mahdi's army in dis
guise and tell us that Gordon's provis
ions were almost gone and that he
could hold out but a few days. Kitch
ener had figured out almost to the hour
when we would reach Khartoum at the
rate we were traveling, and decided
that we would get there too late. But
he was only a junior officer, and his
counsels to push forward did not pre
vail.
"The men were all with him, though
they could never quite understand him.
At one time he would tear along on hia
Said, cursing the slow motion of the
army, and at other times he would ride
along hardly paying any attention to
his horse, and intently reading the
Koran or some vol'ime of the ancient
Persian and Arabian poets. He knows
the Koran so well that he can quote it
to the Sheiks with more fluency than
the Arabs themselves.
"Finally we were getting: near Khar
toum and hopes of saving Gordon be
gan to rise. They were suddenly dashed
to earth, though, by the arrival of a
Greek named Lycurgus. who was car
ried into camp almost dead. He brought
a message from Gordon and Frank
Power, correspondent of the London
Times, to 'Come quick for God's sake.'
It was then too late, though, for the
Greek had just got clear of the Mahdi's
lines when the Dervishes broke into
Khartoum and began the massacre. "We
reached there two days later, only to
find the city deluged in blood. Had
Kitchener had his way we could have
saved Gordon."

"â¢â¢I have often thought," said Mrs.
Smith, v B*e dusted a comfortable
rocker, guiltless of dust, and drew it
forward for her caller, "that I could
fo-ever set at rest that old. old proverb.
â I* marriage a failure?' I would most
positively assert that it is not a failure.
I have had seven husbands and buried
five of them. One ran away with an
other woman; the other. Brother Smith,
will be home in a moment; he is out
attending to the cow now.
"Yes, my life has been a series of
strange Incidents. I have nad much

and gazing reflectively out over the

more determinedly. "I never give up.
I look the present squarely in the face
and trust to the Lord to make the fu

"Tell you something about my life?
Well, there is not much to tell, but I'll
try. lam a little confused about dates.
You see, I had so many husbands and
so many things happened that I can
hardly be very exact.
"1 have known Brother Smithâ you
see I call him brother from force of
habit â all my life. He was and is my
pastor. How long was he engaged to
me? Why, bless your soul, one day.
We knew each other all our lifeâ all
my lif^, I mean. He game over to see
me Sunday night and talked It up. We
were married on Tuesday.
'My seven husbands were all en
gaged but a short time, and I now
haveâ let me see, sixteen or eighteen
step-children. And they, all love me.
Whenever they are married I give them
a wedding dinner and set them up in
housekeeping. There are three sets of
them, too. They come to see me and
whenever my husbands die they always
offer me a home.
"I knew my first husband, Mr. Vice,

De Priest I knew eighteen months, but
we were engaged but three weeks. Mr.
Crozier I knew four years and was en

"Xeff I knew nine months, but' we

"Why, daughter," broke in her old
mother, who came in softly and be
came an interested listener, "you lived
with him six months, d^ar, I remember
quite well."
"I guess you're right, mother," re
plied the bride as she stopped to think.
Then suddenly:
"Yes, it was Fix months. You see,"
apologetically, "I have had so many
it's awful hard to keep things
straight. I was happy with every one,
too," she went on in a low tone, a
far-away look stealing over her ma

never had a cross word, or the slight
est quarrel with any of my husbands,
they all loved me. You see I was hard

"Yes. I've had a good many offers,

and when I make up my mind, I don't

It has always been said in the com

never been heard of. As the story
goes, Mrs. Smith preserves the nuptial
garments of her departed spouses, and
HERE IS A WOMAN WHO HAS BORNE
TWENTY-FOUR CHILDREN
AND SHE WISHES THERE WERE MORE.
MRS. SAMUEL P. SWART
WOOD of Mountain Top, near
Wilkesbarre, Pa., is the mother
of twenty-four children.
This statement may seem In
credible, but it has been fully verified
by many people who visited Mrs. Swart
wood's home.
Five of the children are dead. But
Mrs. Swartwood's dinner horn can still
summon to the table nineteen children,
her husband, two sons-iri-law, one
daughter-in-law and two grandchild
ren.
To be mother of twenty-four children
16 no small achievement, and Mrs.
Swartwood is proud of it. "My child
ren," she said, "are n^y greatest bless
ing."
Mrs. Swartwood is now forty years
old, pleasant-faced and genial, rotund
and jolly, with a great capacity for
laughter and a happy disposition, which
shows that frequent motherhood has
not damaged her temper.
"My children have all been good
children," she said, "and I have no
trouble with any of them; and though
I have always" â this with a modest
iittle laugh â "had a baby â and some
times two â to look after, they never
seemed to be the trouble and worry
that some babies are. My last little one
is sick now, but it is not a eerious sick
shows them to their successors. When
she entertained Neff in this way six
months after she became his wife, she
dusted the garments off and remarked
in a teasing way:
'Til be dusting yours off this way
some time."
To this proposition Xeff is reported
to have promptly and energetically
replied: I'll bo if you do," and
forthwith disappeared.
"Do I remember how my husbands
looked? Indeed I do. I have their pic
tures too.
'"When I married Mr. Dougherty he
had met my mother but once, and I
Introduced him to her as my husband.
She said she supposed it was all rierht.
and that she wasn't at all surprised."
According to the stories in town Mrs.
Smith had her fortune told by a wan
dering gypsy at Brighton, Mo., years
ago. Part of the revelation was that
she was to have seven husbands, that
the seventh wouid survive her, and that
two of the seven would break into the
penitentiary. When asked about this.
Mrs. Smith said:
"It's only partly true. I had my for
tune told, as they say, by cards, and
the gypsy said I'd have seven hus
bands, and that the seventh would
outlive me. I try to make them forget
it, but they won't. I don't want my
husbands to die. I nursed Crozier 16
months and Dougherty 15 months, but
they died anyhow. But here is mv
new husband now. I was just telling
the gentleman," she said, turning to
a tall, austere looking old man. who
entered, "that I don't like my husbands
to die."
The colonel looked thoughtful a mo
ment, and said:
"No, I don't think she does, but they
do it, anyhow. She marries real sud
ness, and she will be all right soon, I
hope."
Mrs. Swartwood was married when
she was fourteen years old and when
her husband was twenty, and two of
her daughters have followed her ex
ample in making an early marriage,
both being wedded when they were
nineteen. But while one has been mar
ried three years and the other two,
each has but one child.
Mr. Swartwood is forty-seven years
old and well preserved. He weighs
about 225 pounds while his wife weighs
150. He is an engineer on the Central
Railroad. He likes nothing better than
to chat about his numerous fahaily, and
is almost as proud of them as he is of
his wife. As for himself, he Is very
modest.
"She is the best little wife in the
world," he said. "I married her when
she was only fourteen, but we had
known each other since we were child
ren, and she was cfuite a big girl then.
We grow big up here on the top of the
mountain," he said, surveying his
ample girth.
Mrs. Swartwood's first child was born
fourteen months after her marriage,
and there have been but five years
since during which the household has
failed to be blessed with a babe. These
years were 1874, 1883, 1887, 1888 and 1896.
But two of them were in succession,
and In the succeeding year twins were
born. Of all the twenty-four children
there were but two sets 'of twins, and

den, too. We did, only a day. you
know, but I reckon she had an intima
tion of what was coming."
"Yes, Brother Smith," she replied,
"you was real nervous for a few days
and I kind of thought you was com
ing arqund. .
"Brofher Smith," she went on,
"would rather be addressed as a min
ister than as colonel. He has an army
record though. He'll tell you about it
while I get supper."
Mrs. Aliie Anne Bridges, the mother
of this remarkable woman, is 76 years
old, four years younger than her latest
son-in-law. She has had three daugh
ters and ten sons in law.
Mrs. Smith was born in Caldwell
County, November 12, 1843, and raised
in Harrison County. At the age of 15
years she married George H. Vice, De
cember 25, 1858. They lived together
five years, when he was killed while on
picket guard as the first sergeant of
M Troop, First Arkansas Cavalry.
They had one child, now Mrs. Sam
White, also living with her second hus
band, and who has several children â
two of them married.
In less than a year, on October 10,
these were born in 1889 and 1893. One of
each set of twins is dead.
When the mother was asked the
birthdays of her children she recited
them as one of them afterward recited
the lines he had spoken at school the
week before and with Just as much
fluency.
Mrs. Swartwood talked freely about
her married life. "I was married when
I was fourteen," she said. "Pretty
early? Yes, but I wanted to get mar
ried, and I loved Sajn. We have been
very happy, and I wouldn't change my
life for any rich lady's. Look at these
children! Ain't they riches enough and
every one living at home except the
two girls that got married?
"It's nice for father and me to have
them all here, but it crowds us up

THIS MAN
HAD FIFTY WIVES.
CHARLES WOODRUFF OF CHICAGO ASSERTS THAT MARRIAGE IS A TRADE.
CHARLES WOODRUFF of Chi
cago is a man who has made
marriage a trade. Within the
last thirteen years he has mar
ried fifty women, an average of
four a year. With every one he got
some money, and in thir is the secret of
his wholesale ventures in matrimony
Now Woodruff Is in prison at .Buffalo,
N. Y. He married once too often.
Brigham Youns?, the high priest of
Mormonism, with all his facilities for
plural marriage, had only twenty-six
wives* he was a tenderfoot in compari
son with Woodruff. There probably
was never a more successful winner
of women than this man; probably no
man who ever had a more ..delicate,
more subtle affection of manner. To
meet a woman and marry her in an
hour is. his record for facility; to woo
and marry half a hundred women is
his record of success.
When he was middle-aged and at
tractive, dressing as he did in the
height of fashion, it was his diversion
to captivate a woman, young or old, to
tell her that he loved her as he hart
never loved another, and to marry her
in a few hours, or perchance in a few
days, only to desert her.
Mr. Woodruff is a student and a
philosopher of love, and this is the
statement he makes of the secret
"Woman's weakness, not any accom
plishment or appearance of mine, is the
cause of my success in winning hearts.
Women are frail things at best.
"Take women when they get to be 40,
and almost anybody can win them.
They want to be won. Under 30 it is
harder to win them, but still it can be
done if a person is patient.
"Tell them they are good-looking, of
course; any schoolboy knows that is
the first rudiment of success with
women.
"There is another factor which I can
not describe. It might be called man's
ensemble. It is his make-up, his ap
pearance, his manner, his way of talk
in? his way of lookingâ a man's eyes,
you know, are what work havoc with
women if they are used right. You can
not acquire these personalities. They
are born in a man.
"Women differ some, too. For in
stance, a simpleness of manner might
impress one. while another might be
captivated by a mysterious, self-know
ing air. First, you want to study the
woman. I remember but one whom I
could not understand. I can usually
read them at a glance. This one of
whom I speak baffled me, though. No,
I didn't marry her.
"The man that married her wai up to
date. She wanted me to make a million
oathbound promises, and I wouldn't do
that for any one. I might make a few,
but not many. One has to make enough
when he's married. I have made a
ptudy of emotions in women and of
their tastes and likings, because I
found interest in the pilrsuit."
Woodruff pushed his numerous court
ships with vigorous alacrity. It selddm
took him over two days after he had
met a woman for the first time to close
up the marriage bargain and lead her
to the altar. It was in 1889 that Wood
ruff achieved his especial notoriety.
One day he was descending in the ele
vator of an office building on Main
street, Buffalo, when a woman, over
come by the movement of the car,
fainted and fell against him. This was
Mrs. S. A. Sample, a widow, with five
children. Woodruff was gay looking
and urbane in speech. He captivated
Mrs. Sample even while he held her on
the way down in the elevator. He went
out with her, won her completely, and
married her. The entire proceeding
had occupied Just an hour. He desert
ed her two days later. Mrs. Sample is
now living in Aver, Mass., under her
old name.
Mr. Woodruff married, so far as de
fectives have been able to learn, five
women in Buffalo. It is believed, how
ever, that he figured in at least a dozen
weddings there. His greatest -success
took place while he was stationed at
the United States Hotel advertising for
young women to go on the stage. In
answer to his advertisement a young
woman named Rowell called at his
rooms and was so pleased with him
that she took him to the home of her
aunt, Miss Schmintzins, and introduced
him to her. In two days Woodruff and
Miss Schmintzins were married.
After leaving Buffalo in 1890 or 1891
Woodruff traveled all over the coun
try, returning to Buffalo every few

months for a day's visit. He spent
much of his time in St. Louis, where,
the police say, he has more wives than
he has in Buffalo. He also has wives
in Chicago. Pittsburg, New York, Los
Angeles, City ot Mexico, Kansas City,
Boston and Philadelphia.
In each of these places, judging from
the* letters he has in his trunk, he won
numerous hearts and made some wives.
He posed as a professor of massage
treatment in New York, professor of
elocution in St. Louis, and as a mining
engineer in Mexico and California.
In IS'j6 Woodruff went to Buffalo,
stayed two weeks, and married a wo
man named Loretta Dart, of whom he
had never before heard. He and ahe
were married at Fort Erie. Woodruff
deserted her a few days after the cere
mony and the woman went to live with
her parents, who are wealthy farmers
near Hambu: h, N. Y. She lives
there now.
About three months ago Woodruff
went to Buffalo and put up at a Pearl
street boarding-house. One day he
met Rowina Scott on the street. Mrs.
Scott spoke to him, but Woodruff did
not answer. He evidently did not
know her as one of his wives. Mrs.
Scott met him a second time, and when
this time he did not deign to recognize
her she was Indignant. She went to
the police. Detectives were detailed
on the case and two days later they ar
rested Woodruff.
Among the other wives of Woodruff
are: Mabel Lane, a soubrette, married
in April 1886; Mrs. Branster, May, 1881".

Woodruff was trying to deny the
charges which have been made against
him one day last week, when the prison
guard announced that a lady wished to
see himâ a Tady from New York.
"I guess you may siiaÂ»' her up,"
said the prisoner. "I don't know any
body from New York."
A wiry woman of 40â she said after

"Now, Charley Woodruff," she said,
as she fixed her eyes on the man. "I
hope you can remember me long
enough to give me back my ring.
Placidly Woodruff gazed upon the in
dignant caller.
"My good woman," he said, sooth
ingly, "I don't know you. I can't re
member having met you before."
"I am the woman you married."
"A.re you sure about that?" queried
Woodruff, sweetly. "I never would

as an unconscious wit, and this anec

Tbe One That Recently Escaped from Its Towboats Came Near Wrecking Several Vessels, and Whe 0 It Began to Break Up farmers and fishermen Along the Coast fibandonad Their Callings to Gather in the flotsam of lumber and Log*
The forward End of the Log Raft Rose High in the Air and Threatened to Crush the
Tow-Boat prom Which It had Escaped.
LOG rafts are very good things,"
say the Italian fishermen.
"Log rafts are very bad things
and should not be permitted,"
say the captains of the passen
ger steamers.
The Italian fisherman knows that
they are quite likely to break up out
at sea, and he can pick up the floating
piles. The salvage on them will in
crease his income several dollars.
The captain of the passenger steamer
knows that the thought of one of them
gives him the nightmare. In the peace
ful summer sea the log raft that has
got away from its tow lies in wait for
hi? steamer. Hundreds of lives are en
dangered and a good ship placed in a
position of the gravest peril, when she
should be as safe as when anchored in
San Francisco Bay.
"The log rafts save us lots of money,"
pay the lumbermen, "and if the pas-
Eenger steamer captains attend to their
business they need not run into them.
TVe know that the towing of log rafts
is forbidden on all ocean waters con
trolled by England, because they think
ir dangerous, but that Js nothing to us.
We should be permitted to carry on our
business in the most economical man
ner we can."
And so it appears that there are
three sides to the log raft towing story.
The question as to -whether they should
be permitted or not is a grave one, call
ing for immediate action on the part of
our next Legislature.
It is about six years since the first
log raft was towed inside the Golden
Gate. At that time only the commer
oi;ti side of the business was looked at,
and the success of the venture was
loudly praised. Another raft was built
WHAT UNCLE SAM EATS AND DRINKS IN ONE YEAR.
IF the strength of a country be measured by the
abundance and nutritive value of Its food then
the United States stands easily at the head of
the dominant nations of the world. Not only
can the farms, the meadows and the orchards
supply the needs of our own citizens, but there is
left an immense surplus to be shipped to other
countries.
Take wheat, for example, one of the leading staples.
During the past ten years the nation's wheat crop has
averaged about 465,000,000 bushels, ranging from less
than 400,000,000 bushels in 1893 to over 600,000,000 two
years earlier. The average yearly exports of this
â wheat for the same decade were 140,000,000 bushels,
leaving 325,000,000 for home consumption. Excluding
the wheat used for seed and for purposes other than
human food, the present consumption is estimated to
be a little less than one barrel of rlour per capita, or
70,000,000 barrels for the nearly 75,000,000 population.
That means an annual consumption of 14,000.000,000
pounds of flourâ a bulk which, put into a single re
ceptacle, would require a barrel twice the height of
the Washington Monument and correspondingly big
of circumference. Were all this flour made into bread
It would yield 20,000,000,000 pound loaves. Reversing
the metaphor of the Sermon on the Mount and "giving
bread for a stone," these loaves would pave road
way thirty-six feet wide and extending around the
in the north and started down. It gÂ«>t
lost, but fortunately a heavy storm
came up and broke the raft all to pieces
and washed it ashore out of the path
of vessels.
"If we land one raft out of three we
can still make money." said the lum
bermen, heedless of the danger and the
inconvenience they mieht cause nav
igation, and they immediately went to
work on another log pile.
From that time to the present log
rafts have been towed to San Fran
cisco from the lumber regions of the
north with varied success. Some of the
rafts have come through so easily as to
cause no comment. But every few
months one of them has managed to
get loose from its tow and float around
for days, a menace to navigation.
It would seem, though, that the busi
ness is a profitable one, for log rafts
are still being built and towed with
more or less success.
There can be no doubt but that log
raft towing is a great deal cheaper than
shipping logs by lumber schooners,
either steam or sail. A good log raft
will contain as much lumber as could
be crowded into fifty of the ordinary
sailing schooners. The cost of towing
is nominal compared to the expenses
of a fleet of sailing vessels. It will be
thus seen that the profits from this
business are enormous, enough to make
the lumbermen forget the dangers to
the other travelers of the sea. A small
log raft is worth about $30,000. If it is
landed safely in San Francisco the
profits will be about $20,000. But larger
rafta than this have been sent down
successfully. The largest is said to
have netted the promoters of the
'scheme a profit of about $50,000.
Aside from the financial and humani
tarian aspects of the log raft business
there is another aspect. This is its
picturesqueness and danger of the men
engaged in it.
To safely tow a log raft from any of
world. If bakery wagons were loaded each with a
thousand of the loaves 20,000,000 would be needed to
move the bread. They would make a procession over
60,000 miles long or eighteen abreast from ocean to
ocean. Of course not all the flour is made into bread,
since millions of pies, cakes and other products of the
cook's art come from these 70,000,000 flour barrels.
Wheat, however, is far from being the only grain
used for food by the American people. The corn
crop is about four times as large as that of wheat,
and some seventeen hundred millions of bushels re
main for consumption in our own country. But only
a fraction of this reaches the stomach of man direct,
for the most part it is taken in the pork, beef, milk,
butter, eggs and other products of animals that fatten
on its substance. In recent years, apparently, the
direct use of corn for man's food is increasing with
the â¢'mixed" flour, the patent food preparations, the
brown bread, corn dodgers and like cookery. Whole
sections of the South use corn almost exclusively in
preference to wheat flour.
Then there Is the oat crop averaging 700,000,000
bushels, most of which remains in this country. Amer
icans are rapidly following the Scotch in the use of
oats as a table food, still only a small fraction of the
total crop is consumed in the home. The average
barley crop is 70,000,000 bushels, all but 5,000,000 bushels
of which remains within the country. The usual yield
of rye is 28,000,000 bushels, very little of which is ex
ported. But the barley and rye are largely reduced
to fluid form before the American consents to take

the northern lumber regions into San
Francisco requires the greatest ability
in the way of seamanship. The tow
boat captain must know his business
and keep a careful lookout on his
charge at all hours of the day and
night.
If the weather is fine and the current
light there will be little difficulty. The
task will be only a question of time.
The crew of the towboat will haveprac
tically nothing to do.
But if the current is high and the sea
choppy and with a long swell there is
another story to tell. Under these cir
cumstances the raft will dance around
in all sorts of directions. Owing to a
certain amount of flexibility the log
raft has a way of occasionally going
faster than Its tow. It seems to slide
down a series of waves and make a
dash for the towboat. If the man at
the wheel is not on the lookout the
small craft will be overwhelmed and
crushed to pieces and not a man left to
tell the tate.
Another'danger comes when the log
raft breaks the tow line and starts on
a voyage of her own. If this happens
in daylight the pile of logs can often
be caught and the voyage proceeded
with, but if it happens at night during
a storm the chances are that the raft
will drift about for days endangering
every vessel that passes up or down
the coa?t.
This is what happened to the last raft
that was sent down from the north. All
went well until San Francisco was al
most reached. Then the cables snapped
and the raft went adrift. For over a
week all efforts to find it proved un
availing. Several steamers narrowly
escaped running it down and reported
the location to the tugboats here. But
when the tugboats went out to hunt
for the raft they could find no trace of
the floating log pile.
Then it broke in two and the surface
of the ocean for miles was scattered

with logs. It was then that the Italian
fishermen realized the beauties and the
riches of log rafts. Each of the float
ing piles was worth about $5, ajid every
fisherman with a boat forgot all about
fish and began to scour the near-by
ocean for logs. Pile catching was the
principal industry along the water
front. Some of the large boats could
take two of the logs in tow and make
two trips a day. This meant $20. There
will be no more fishing as long as the
piles hold out. Send down more log
rafts and let them break up just out
side the Golden Gate and the Italian
fishermen will be happy.

them into his stomach. Some 15,000,000 bushels of
buckwheat enter each year into the composition of
our pancakes.
Another favorite food of the Americans is the po
tato. Its average crop in recent years has been about
225,000,000 bushels.
America's sweet tooth is said to be abnormally de
veloped. The consumption of sugar reaches the aston
ishing total of 5,500,000,000 pounds; but only one-eighth
of this is raised at home. Last year nearly a third
of the supply came from Germany, and 8 per cent
more from the rest of Europe. The West Indies sent
24 per cent and the East Indies 14 per cent.
The dairy produces another important part of the
food supply. With the butler, cheese, milk and like
products, the total value to the consumer is estimated
to be not less than $600,000,000 a year. To spread the
bread, make the pies and concoct other appetizing
dainties requires an annual supply of not less than
1,350,000,000 pounds of butter. Besides, we export about
25,000,000 pounds. Cheese is used to the extent of
230.000,000 pounds annually. Made into one gigantic
cheese it would measure 450 feet in diameter and half
as many feet in height.
Then there are the eggs, of which 850,000.000 dozens
are used during the year. Placed end to end they
would gird the world twelve times at the equator.
Yet this use is not excessive, since it allows less than
three eggs a week to each person.
Probably no people in the world eat as much meat
â¢â¢? the Americans. The Secretary of Agriculture places
Evidently the raft anchored itpelf on a
reef off Pigeon Point, where It remain
ed for several days, until finally loos
ened by dynamite. This raft is worth
$25,000. It also had about $6000 worth of
chain on it.
A short time ago a lumber raft broke
up outside and a section of It drifted
on to the beach at Santa Cruz. Lumber
rafts, however, are not so much to be
feared by seamen as log rafts. It is the
monster of heavy piles that keeps the
steamer captain awake at night.

Wtyepe .He Drew The Line.
Once there was a farmer from Swales
Hollow drove up to Gerber's undertak
the annual meat bill at not less than $900,000,000.
Figures can be only approximate, yet a fair estimate
would place the beef consumed at 5,000.000,000 pounds,
pork at 4,000,000,000, and mutton at 800,000,000 pounds.
With the poultry and game the total meat eaten an
nually cannot be less than 10,000,000,000 pounds, which
is nearly two pounds a day apiece for each family
of five persons.
To the meat supply must be added the products
of the rivers, lakes and oceans, aggregating probably
some 800,000,000 pounds of various kinds of fish. The
canned salmon alone is placed at 80,000,000 pounds.
Americans are drinkers as well as eaters. Last
year they used 725,000,000 pounds of coffee and 110,000,
000 pounds of tea. At the average strength the coffee
in the cups would measure 1,200,000,000 gallons and
the tea 1,100,000,000 gallons. To these must be added
beer, 1,200,000,000 gallons, wines 25,000,000, and distilled
spirits, such as whisky, brandy and rum, 90,000,000
gallons. This gives a total of over 3,600,000,000 gallons
or about forty-eight gallons for each man, woman and
child.
The statement in billions of pounds of the food
consumed by the nation is certainly impressive, but
far less so than if one could actually see these enor
mous quantities. As an aid in measuring one day's
food of the American people imagine that a giant
2000 feet tall were to land on this continent from a
distant planet. Larger by far than the famous giants

to call upon the nation to supply him with food. He
would need an amount equal to that consumed by the
entire 75,000,000 people. Set his daily supply before
him and see what it would be. â 
On a bread plate half as large as a city block would
rest a loaf of bread 300 feet long and half as tall.
Beside it would stand a pie large around as a gas

would sip his oatmeal with a spoon whose bowl could

area equal to ten city lots; a covered dish contains
three mammoth white -^tatoes and a sweet potato
each 100 feet long. His pat of butter would measure
a hundred feet in diameter. By his side is a glass of
milk as large as a water service tower, an egg 100
feet long, an apple of equal height and a 600-foot cube
of sugar making up most of the day's food.
But the giant does not forget to ask for drink.
Besides two or three glasses of water, each the height

more by his incongruity than otherwise. It is the
height of his ambition to dress like the white man and he
is proud, 'ndeed, if he may strut the street with a "derby"
hat on his head. Next to carrying a gun this is his great
est pleasure. Among the many wild tribes of the Philip
pines the Morro are the fiercest and through the kindness
drawn annually from Ban Francisco
Bay and its tributary bays and streams
Is unparalleled, though the full re
sources of the waters are by no means
developed or utilized to the practicable
extent. This enormous productiveness
is due largely to the uniform tempera
ture of the water of the bay and to
other circumstances which are very fa
vorable to aquatic life.
Many branches of the fishing indus
try on this coast possess a very pic
turesque interest, inasmuch as they are
practically unknown elsewhere. One Of
these is the squid fishery. Monterey
County alone furnishes 350,000 pounds
of dried squid per annum. They are
caught by the Chinese and cured for
export. No salt is used, the squid be
ing dried in the sun, packed in bundles
and covered with matting, each pack
age containing 135 pounds. In this
shape they are sent to San Francisco,
whence the bulk of them are forwarded
to the Hawaiian Islands and to China.
Most native Americans would have a
horror of such a diet, but the Chinese
regard squid as a great delicacy, and
so likewise do many foreigners. That
the Chinese consider the octopus, a
nearly related animal, excellent for eat
ing is sufficiently well known. The oc
topus fishery of California, conducted
likewise by the Chinese, is of no small
importance. The method of prepara
tion for export is similar to that adopt
ed in the case of the squid.
The shrimp fishery of California is
equally unique in its way, immense
quantities of these little and toothsome
crustaceans being obtained from San
Francisco Bay and adjacent waters.
The numbers of the animals taken may
be judged by the fact that more than
five million pounds of them are pre
pared for market in this State annuaJly.
The industry is in the hands of the Chi
nese. The bulk of them are dried and
shipped to China. They are taken
ashore as soon as caught, and are
boiled in big iron vats. ' After ten min
utes in boiling water they are taken
out and spread on the ground, where
they are permitted to dry in the sun
for five or six days. Some of the
"shrimp yards" used for this purpose
cover many acres. During the drying
process the shrimps are turned at in
tervals with queer looking brooms
shaped somewhat like hoes. When per
fectly dry they are crushed by being
trodden upon by Chinamen in wooden
shoes. This loosens the "meats" from
the shells, which are removed by shak
ing them in baskets or by passing the
shrimps through rude fanning mills.
Both meats and shells are packed in
packs for export to China, where the
meats are sold for food and the shells

The experts of the Government Fish
Commission reckon the product of the
California crab fishery at nearly 3,000,
000 pounds annually. The so-called
"blue" or "Chesapeake" crab, which is
the edible species par excellence along
the Atlantic seaboard, is unknown on
the Pacific Coast. Its place on these
shores is taken by a species not at all
nearly related, which is termed in scien
titic phraseology as the "Cancer magis
tir." This is the common crab of San
Francisco Bay and of the Pacific â the
largest of the edible species on this
coast, and the only one commonly eaten
in this city. It ranges all the way from
Sitka to Magdalena Bay in Lower Cali
fornia. San Francisco Bay fairly
swarms with these crabs. They are
caught with nets, baited with fish and
offal. Nothing is known about their
breeding habits, strange to say. and no
female bearing spawn has ever been
seen by a naturalist.
There is another species of crab,
very abundant in the bays of San
Francisco and Monterey, which would
be considered valuable for food if the
species just described should ever be
come scarce. It Is the so-called "red
ciub," and frequents the rocky shal
lows. The "yellow shore crab" and the
"purple Â«hore crab" are found in enor
mous numbers all along the California
coast, but are eaten only by the Chi
nese. Their bodies are nearly square,
and their claws large for the size of the

animal. Hundreds of them are some
times seen together under a single big
stone.
One of the most picturesque of Cali
fornia fisheries is that of the abalone.
These beautiful 'ingle-shelled mollusks
are found along rocky shores at low
tide, clinging to rocks above the water
line. Each shell is slightly lifted, so
that the fisherman is able to thrust a
stick under it and pry it off, but if the
animal is alarmed it shuts down its
valve upon a rock, to which it clings
with such tenacity by means of its
huge adductor muscle that it can only
be removed by breaking it in pieces.
The meats taken from the shells are
boiled on shore in sheet iron vats. Both
shells and meats are packed in sacks
an-l forwarded to San Francisco,
whence most of the meats are exported
to China. The shells are shipped to
France, being highly valued for their
exquisite mother-of-pearl. This fishery
yields about 400,000 pounds of meats
and shells per annum.
The spiny lobster of the Pacific is
rated by epicures as inferior to the true
lobster of the Atlantic Coast, its meat
being coarser and less tender. Never
theless the fishery for this animal in
California is of considerable import
ance, yielding more than 300,000 pounds
annually. The spiny lobster is the most
Important of the invertebrate products
of the San Diego County fisheries. It
is taken in pots and drop-nets, baited
with fish or meat. South of Santa Bar
bara County it is extremely abundant.
Several counties, with a view of pre
serving the species from extermination,
have already adopted ordinances de
claring that no spiny lobsters are to be
caught between May 15 and July 15,
and inflicting a penalty upon anybody
who takes or has in his possession at
any time a specimen less In weight than
one pound. By the former of these pro
visions protection is furnished during
the period when the eggs are being car
ried by the female and up to the date
when they reach maturity and are
hatched. The eggs are of a brilliant
brickdust red color, and are much
smaller than the eggs of the true lob
ster. Spiny lobsters are shipped to the
San Francisco market in sacks. This
interesting animal is more active and
seemingly more intelligent than the
true lobster. It moves through the
water with greater speed and quite
commonly it escapes from the lobster
pot after eating the bait.
The time may yet arrive when the
true lobster will be present in such
numbers on the California coast as to
make a profitable fishery. Unfortu
nately up to date no success whatever
has attended repeated efforts to intro
duce it on this side of the continent.
The first attempt in this direction was
made in June. 1873, when 162 lobsters
captured in Massachusetts waters were
fetched hither in a fruit car especially
fitted up for the purpose. The car had

This tribe is in marked contrast to the Tagallo in that
they have imitated the white man in nothing, not even in
the use of firearms, their weapons being the poisoned
spear or arrow. The poison is said to be similar in itÃ

and means of carrying an abundance
of salt water. Nevertheless only forty
of the animals were alive when the
train reached Omaha and shortly after
leaving that point the car and its con
tents were precipitated into the Elk
horn River by a smash-up.
The second trial was made in June.
1874, 150 lobsters, all adult fe
males bearing eggs, being shipped
from Boston. They were packed
with sponges, which were wetted
from time to time with salt water.
Only four of them reached here
alive, and they were put into the sea
at Oakland wharf, in San Francisco
Bay. The third attempt was made in
June, 1879. Twenty-two females carry
ing ep"-s nearly ready to hatch con
stituted the shipment. One died en
route; the rest were taken from ihe
Oakland wharf to the Bonito light
house, under the shadow of which they
were put into the sea, in a sheltered
bay. They brought with them over a
million eggs read to hatch. The fourth
attempt was made in June, 1888. By
this time the business was better un
derstood, and the lobsters, 610 in num
ber, were packed in trays with wet
rockweed. Also 196 loose egars were
brought along on cloth-bottomed trays.
Three-hundred and thirty-two of the
lobsters arrived in Â«*ood condition, with
75 per cent of the eggs. The bulk of the
consignment was planted in the vicin
ity of Monterey. The Albatross took
thirty of the lobsters aboard and plant
ed them near the -Trinidad lighthouse.
The loose eggs were put in hatching
boxes, and 140,000 baby lobsters ob
tained from them were planted in Mon
terey and San i.< rancisco bays. Of this
number, however, San Francisco only
got 2000.
The fifth and last trial wan made in
ISB9, when 710 lobsters were carried in
crates with rockweed to the coasts of
Oregon and Washington over the
Northern Pacific road. Out of the num
ber 233 survived, and these were plant
ed in five different localities. The to
tal number of Eastern lobsters planted
in Pacific waters was 590, of which 357
were put into the sea along the shores
of California. The number shipped
was 1658, and the number lost 1068. On
the return eastward from the fourth
trip the Fish Commission people took
300 of the "Cancer magister" crabs, fif
teen bushels of California clams and
several San Francisco terrapin, for the
purpose of seeing how they would get
along in Atlantic waters. Unluckily
the car was wrecked near Humboldt,
New, and the consignment was lost.
The diamond-backed terrapin, so be
loved by epicures, does not exist on the
Pacific Coast. The Fish Commission
experts say that conditions here are
most promising for its successful intro
duction, the extensive salt marshes
around San Francisco Bay and in other
places furnishing a most suitable habi
tat for the animal. It seems probable
that before long an effort will be made
to transplant this valuable turtle to
the Pacific side. The California terra
pin, known to science as "Chelopus
marmoratus," is the only California
turtle of commercial prominence. It is
by no means so toothsome as the dia
mond-back.
It inhabits rivers and fresh-water
ponds west of the Sierras, ranging from
Monterey to the Canadian border. In
California it is especially abundant,
and in this region it is taken with
baited fyke-nets. About San Francisco
Bay it is very numerous. In this city
1500 dozen are sold annually, at from
$3 to $5 per dozen. The Government
Fish Commission places California's
annual production of terrapin and frogs
at 46,000 pounds. The bullfrog- figures
more conspicuously in the markets of
San Francisco each year, commanding
from ?2 to $4 a dozen.
The fishery for fresh-water crawfish
is comparatively new, and as yet the
utilization of this animal is limited. It |
is found in large numbers in sloughs
or streams.
From the list of queer fisheries ought
not to be omitted the gathering of sea
ni.iss. which is collected by the Chinese
from rocks along the coast. It is dried,
packed in bales, and is exported to
China, where it is used for soups. The
Chinese consider the intestines of the
skate a great delicacy. Skates of one
species on this coast attain a remark
able size, specimens having been caught
six feet in length and weighing 150
pounds.
One product of the sturgeon is used
exclusively by the < 'hinese â namely,
the spinal marrow. In an average
size sturgeon the rpinal cord is four
or five feet long, consisting of long
white connecting links resembling sau
sages. These are cut open, and the Jel
ly-like substance contained within is I
scraped off and thrown away. What I
remains is known by the Chinese and
the trade under the name of "bone."
CELEBRITIES WHO TOOK TIPS.
Visitors at an English country house
are allowed to do whatever they like
during the forenoon. An eminent geol
ogist, who was entertained at one of
these houses, asked for coffee early one
morning and started out with a suit of
old clothes and a bag of tools to make
a special study of the rock ledges of
the estate.
During the forenoon one of the coun
try gentry came upon him by the road
side, and supposing him to be a work
man entered into conversation with
him. The geologist was seated on a
ledge of rock and was making vigor
ous use of mallet and chisel.
The stranger talked with him in a
patronizing way, and, while not receiv
ing an intelligible account of the work
on which he was engaged, was im
pressed with the supposed workman's
intelligence and good manners. In
deed, he fumbled in his pocket and
brought out a half crown, which he
tossed to the man with the mallet. The
geologist seemed surprised, but picked
it up and put it in his pocket after
thanking the gentleman.
There was a dinner party at the coun
try house in the evening and the same
gentleman was introduced to the emi
nent geologist, whe at once began to
laugh.
"I have the half crown," he said at
once, "and I shall not give it up. It is
the first tip I ever received, and I shall
show it to my friends as a trophy of
superior intelligence."

California's soft clam fishery is of
great importance, no less than 2,000,000
pounds of those mollusks being taken
annually. It is believed that they were
brought originally with oyster seed
from the Atlantic coast. Here they
have taken hold in a way which might
have been imitated to advantage by
the eastern oysters, and already they
have secured a wide distribution. In
deed, these waters evidently are par
ticularly well adapted to them, and
there is no lack of sand and mud for
their accomodation. They afford a
nutritious food, and it is to be expected
that the fishery for them will steadily
grow.
They can actually be cultivated to
great advantage, as has been proved
by trials on the shores of New England,
where a single acre of well tilled mud
bank Is worth $1000. Under conditions
of culture the clams attain a more uni
form size and bring a higher price in
the market. They grow so thick as
literally to stand shoulder to shoulder,
feeding themselves, requiring no fer
tilizer, and yielding an annual interest
as high and certain as any real estate.

RELIGION IS
AN EXACT SCIENCE
So Says Bpamaeljapin, tfoe Famous .Hindoo Student and
Teacher, .Now on a Visit to Tftis
City.
THE Brahmacharin Chatterji, after spending nearly
eighteen months in England and on the continent
prosecuting his work of elucidating and illustrating
such tenets of theosophy as seem mysterious to those less
advanced than himself, is once again making a brief visit
to San Francisco.
During the past week he has been the center of crowds
of eager seekers after knowledge and he has impressed by
hts personality even those whom he has not convinced by
his arguments. Though he modestly styles himself a
"Brahmacharin"â a studentâ his command of English, his
high education, wide range of reading and thorough ac
quaintance with his subject, combined with a natural gift
of unusual eloquence, make him well worthy the title of
teacher.
MY mission is not to proselytize
persons, but simply to give
them reasons and scientific
bases for the beliefs that they
already have, and to sho-w them
what about those beliefs is the
truth and what is but the corruption
gathered there in later ages. A Chris
tian who studies theosophy as it should
be studied becomes a far better and
more rational Christian than before,
because he no longer possesses simply
blind faith, but has co-gent reasons for
things which he formerly had to accept
on trust, or reject because he was ig
norant of their real meaning.
I try to show indisputably that reli
gion is a positive and exact science, and
that its truths are verifiable right here
on this earth. It is possible to know
with certainty and precision many
truths which people have in the past
taken on faith alo-ne, such as the per
sistence of the individual after death,
and the condition in which it persists,
and so on. Knowing these things my
self I wish others to know them, and
to that end I talk and travel.
I am often asked if theosophy is not
a form of eclecticism. Most assuredly
it is net. Theosophy enunciates a truth
first on Its own basis, then says: "This
truth is to be found in such and such
other religions." It has everything in
itself and recognizes all that is good
and true elsewhere. It agrees wiih
Buddhism, Parseeism, Mohammedan
ism, Christianity and all other religions
Just so for as they deal with the truth.
Theosophy is rich to overllo-wing, but
eclecticism, on the contrary, is a beg
gar, going about collecting from other
religions what it has not been able to
earn for itself.
One thing I notice particularly in this
country, and that is that so many seem
to think mere opinions are of so much
importance. "What do you think?" I
am asked, "What is your opinion con
cerning so and so?" Now my opinio-n,
or the opinion of any man, is of no
weight whatever, and such a query
should never be made. If you wish to
learn a certain thing go to one who
kno-ws the truth about it and. ask him
for that truth; then meditate upon
what you are told, try to think it out
for yourself and understand it, and thus
you will truly learn and be benefited.
The mere speculations of humanity
benefit no one.
I find many persons who express sur
prise that I believe in magic. Such
persons have nut yet mastered the
foundation truth that thoughts are
things. The mighty power of concen
trated thought is something understood ;
by few. It is possible to create living j
forms by this power; it is possible also :
to deal death to living creatures. There j
are persons who are advanced enough j
in knowledge to do these things. There j
are persons who are able to wield the
subtle powers of nature, which sur
round us on every side, as they will.
Such persons are magicians and their
power is magic. If exercised for the
good of the world it is white magic, if
for selfish ends it is black magic, but
magic it is in either case, and no one
who has studied the subject can hon
estly deny its existence. Hypnotism â
the dominating of one mind by another j
âis a form of black magic, for no one i
spiritually advanced would for a mo- i
ment even try to dominate another's j
will, and much of evil is done in this j
way. The responsibility for wrong acts
performed under the control of evil spir
its or the will of another is in propor

tion to the readiness with which one's
own will was given up.
The problem of death seems to be
especially interesting to those who talk
with me. In order to understand it,
we must first try to understand some
thing of the problem of life â that is,
learn of what man, as we know him,
consists. There are many parts to
every man. First the physical, which
i is divided into the gross and subtle, or
I etheric; next the astral, which is the
, sensational or emotional; then the
j mental, which is divided into the in
. tuitive and intellective; and finally the
: spiritual; all of these being apart
! the real self, which is the witness of ail
' the changes which take place in th--sÂ»j
i different parts of man.
Death is simply the pulling out of the
! etheric part from the gross, leaving
] ihe gross part subject to decomposi
i tion. After the separation, the etheric
i part, to those who can clearly Â»cc it,
! looks like the physical. It is what
people commonly call the "ghost" of
! the dead person. It ordinarily hovers
| over the dead person or the grave
| where he lies, and many persons who
I are not able to distinguish its individ-
I uality see it in the form of a bluish
j light, which disappears when decom-
I position is complete. The astral part
is left behind in what we call purga
; tory, where it gradually disintegrates,
' and the intellective mind goes to pjecea
!in the lower heaven. After this the
| man begins to get into a condition to
be born againâ reincarnated, as we say.
I The plane of this reincarnation de
| pends entirely upon himself.
Much has been excused among men
ion the score of heredity. We say. "He
! cannot help sinning, because his father
i or grandfather or some of his ancestors
I did so before him."
This is foolish. We are given our
I bodies in a measure by our ancestors;
! but had he who is to inhabit that body
been without sin in his past existence,
or had he even lived above the plane of
j that body's ancestors, he would have
'â  been permitted to come back to one
i free from disease, mental or physical.
: Heredity is no excuse, for we come
' back to this life to just the surroundins
| to which we are entitled.
It is possible for a person to grow so
wise that he can decide the question of
reincarnation for himself. If he wills
to come back, he may do so; and if he
prefers to remain outside this realm he
can. Such power, however, comes only
when the idea of separativeness is
wholly lost, when one no longer desires
anything for his personal self. Disem
bodied egos are all around us on the
astral plane. Were our eyes open we
could see them constantly; but, seen or
unseen, they are there.
In our reincarnations we have to
work out the penalties for our sins and
mistakes in other existences. We can
go forward or backward as we choose.
Karma and fatalism are two different
things. Nothing happens by chance,
and if we generate certain causes, un
less we can counteract them we must
suffer the results. Sometimes we can
bring to bear on our life lines certain
new laws and forces which will change
things for the better.
A man is entirely under fate only
when absolutely ignorant and devoid of
will power. Freedom is gained by wis
dom alone.

CAUSED THE INDIAN UPRISING.
Queer Customs They .Have in Tbei.p. "Ghost" Dances and
Preparing for tbp Warpath.
WHILE the immediate cause
of the revolt of the Chip
pewa Indians is an effort
to arrest some of the braves
for illicit traffic in whisky,
is a more serious trouble back of
The lands of the Chippewas are
vily timbered, and under the reser
:ion act the Indians have the right
â  sell this timber to white lumbermen,
ibject to the approval of the Indian
unmissioner and his agents. Most of
:he timber is sold on contract, the
ouyer paying in advance, as he cuts it,
a certain percentage of the purchase
price to the resident agent, to be held
in trust for the Indians. This course
is taken to secure honest dealing, and
to make sure that Uncle Sam's red
â wards receive their just dues. For
some years there has been dispute as
to whether what is known as "dead
and-down" timber comes within the
provisions of the act, and it was over
the disposal of this class of trees that
the trouble which led to the Chippewa
var really arose.
"Dead-and-down" timber is a trade
phrase covering logs or trees which are
left in the forests unclaimed. The
â woods of Minnesota are full of themâ
trees that have been felled by lightning
or fires, and in some instances by chop
pers and overlooked by the logging
gangs. A large percentage of this tim
ber is just as marketable as the stand
ing trees, and can be got out at far
less cost. Consequently there has been
strong rivalry for its possession. For
a time white men made raids and
helped themselves to the fallen logs,
ignoring the claims of the Indians to
ownership. In this they had the help
of the halfbreeds and squawmen who
hang about the reservations. It was a
profitable practice until partially put
a stop to by a ruling of the Indian
lissioner, who held that the "dead
and-down" timber was a part of the
Chippewas' assets, and could be dis
: of by them the same as standing
timber. This brought more money to
the red man's purse, but it cut off a
Bource of lucrative income from the
halfbreeda and the bad feeling between
the two classes was intensified. The
real Indian hates the halfbreed in this
case because he has reason to believe
the latter has been robbing him, while
the halfbreed is angry over the loss of
his chance to make some easy money.
Uncle Sam is a teetotaler on the
whisky question as far as his Indian
wards are concerned. He forbids, under
. - penalties, the gift or sale to
them of strong drink. Now the aver
age Indian, with one taste of fire water,
will barter all his possessions for more.
Furs, tepee, squaw, anything and
everything he will give for whisky
when once the alcohol is working in his
system. Recently whisky in consider
able quantities has made its appear
ance among the Indians on Bear Is
land. How it got there nobody seen:Â»
to know, but it is suspected that some
of the cunning halfbreeds could tell if
they wanted to. When an Indian gets
a few drinks he is ready for trouble,
and the whisky sent to Bear Island had
the customary results. Then an order
wfcnt out from the agency to arrest the
diunken Indians and those who were
g the stuff among them. If white
men had been sent to make the arrests
it is probable that they might have
been effected without serious clash;
but, unfortunately, it happened that the
officers selected were two halfbveeds
who are serving as Deputy United
Slates Marshals. These men, so the
Indians assert, were the chief offenders
in the "dead-and-down" timber dls*
pute, and, even after the commission
er V ruling, succeeded in getting a bnÂ»
share of the proceeds from the 3a'e rt
the trees. Their appearance at Bear
Island had an effect similar to that ol
cashing a lighted torch into a powder
magazine.
The Bear Island branch of the Chip
pewas, or Pillagers, as they are cal'ed,
are bad Indians. They live in the ways
of their savage ancestors; wear blank
ets instead of clothes, sleep in tepees,
and subsist by hunting, fishing and
trapping:. There are ten Indian reser

and Fond dv Lac. The Pillagers belong
to the Leech Lake reservation and have
great influence among the unruly
spirits at the other agencies, especially
those at White Earth, who come next
to the Bear Islanders in love of war
and hatred of the white man. All of
these Indians are of the Chippewa
tribe, a branch of the famous Algon
quin nation. For years they were lords
and masters in the timber regions of
the North, making relentless war on
the Sioux, Cheyennes and other red-
Ekins and driving them to the prairie.>
of the West. Much of this martial
ardor still remains with the Bear Is
land and White Earth Chippewas.
While other bands in Minnesota have
ac civilized and settled down as
tillers of the soil, wearing "store
.-," living in frame houses and
sending their children to school the
Pillagers and White Earth Indians
Bcorn such tangible evidences of ab
criginal decadence. To them the white
man is still a weak stripling, to be
Bwept away, just as their ancestors,
the mighty Algonquins, treated the plo
neers of old.
At the head of the Bear Islanders Is
Chief Bog-a-Meg-Eshig. corrupted into
"Bush Ear," a husky redskin about 40
years of age and chockful of real In
dian deviltry. Bear Island lies in
Leech Lake, about thirty miles north of
this town, and is difficult of access.
When the deputy marshals went there
with warrants for the arrest of Bush
Ear and nine of his followers, the chief
openly defied them. There was then
strong prospects of a row, but the dep
uty marshals wisely retreated, and in

me whites and their halfbreed al
lies wanted to take him away and shoot
him so they might rob the Bear Island
ers at their will, and the performance
was wound up with a war dance. When
an Indian once goes through the evo
lutions of the war dance he must fight,
and that's all there is to it. He may
know that he hasn't a ghost of a chance
to win, but he is going to fight even if
certain death or defeat stares him in
the face. It was so with Bush Ear and
his Pillagers. They had danced the war
dance, and in the excitement the whole
300 of them abandoned themselves to
this pledge.
Word came to the agency that the
Bear Islanders were arming and get
ting ready for a war, and were also
sending out runners to the other reser
vations to induce warriors to join their
ranks. It was at this juncture that
Marshal O'Connor decided that ener
getic steps to put down the revolt must
bÂ« taken. Last Thursday he got Deputy
Marshal Sheehan and a posse and
started for Bear Island under guard of
a detachment of twenty United States
soldiers commanded by Lieutenant
Humphrey. The party stopped at
Walker in order that the Indians might
be given another chance to come into
the agency and submit quietly to Fed
eral authority.
Colonel Tinker, inspector of Indian
agencies, was at Walker and relieved
Agent Sutherland of immediate charge
of the negotiations. Word was at once
sent out, calling the Indians of the
Leech Lake reservation to a council on
Monday noon. Only the agency and
Pine Point Indians attended, those of
Bear Island, Otter Tall Point and Cass
Lake remaining away, and sending an
answer of defiance. An adjournment
was taken until Tuesday, when word
was received from Bush Ear that he
would not surrender and that his peo
ple were determined to fight to the end.
"You may kill us all," he said, "but it
will be in battle." After this Inspector
Tinker and Marshal O'Connor went
alone to a point on the short of Leech
Lake near Bear Island, whore they had
a talk with the unruly Indians which
satisfied them that they could be sub
dued only by a shadow of overpowering
force. Bush Ear was present at the
conference and reiterated his Intention
to fight, declaring that he and his peo
ple might as well die in battle as to be
robbed continually, year after year, by
timber thieves. It was then that Tin
kf-r and O'Connor, after returning to
Walker, wired for more troops and
made the sortie in which, as told in the
telegraphic advices, six soldiers were
killed and eight wounded.
It may seem strange to the residents
of a great city like Chicago that they
should have a real Indian war right
under their very windows, but it is a
fact nevertheless, and while Uncle Sam
Is certain to Win in short order, his
troops will know they have been in a
fight. The Indian district of Minnesota
is only a few hundred miles from Chi
cago but it is a bad country for whito
men to operate in, and Just the kind of
place that timber Indians like the Chip
newas are at home in. If the war
should continue for a week it is proba
ble the White Earth, Otter Tail Point,
Cass Lake and Red Lake Indians would
loin with the hostiles, as they are all
discontented and ready to make trou
ble if there is any show of success. Be
tween them they could muster probably
1200 fighting men. The chances are,
nowevfr that one good fight will take
the conceit out of Bush Ear and his
men provided the troops are not de

The squaw winter is just passed in
Minnesota now and the Indian summer
is blazing in the crimson maples and
sighing in the golden cotton./oods as
their fluttering leaves drop into the
brown grass. All night long the young
warriors dance around their campfire,
swinging and tossing their weapons.
They have been enchanted by the medi
cine men and anointed. The Indian
fighters know that it means serious
work when the Indians dance their war
dance, for their dances are not "to the
lacivious pleasing of the lute," but are
old religious rites born in the Indian
with his bones and blood.
The oldest women of the village sit
and beat a monotonous sing-song on
the tom-toms â  nd chant a"n accompani
ment of "Ki-yi-yi-yi," which rises and
falls at regular intervals. The braves,
painted and nearly naked, dance and
they sing their sacretl war song. We
have seen how the "Star-Spangled
Banner" can inspire our troops as they
go into battle; to the Indian, all his
ancestors are calling him; he forgets
his civilization and is a free wild sav
age again as he sings the songs which
the Indians never forget. No one who
does not know the Indian knows how
he is moved by these songs, for he
knows he is an exile in his own land.
He remembers all his wrongs and
swears to be revenged.
With his knees bent and elbows
akimbo one brave begins the dance
and the others join in:
What is this I employ to enchant?
Serpents are my friends.
And in the pause which follows every
brave In the circle prays to his friend,
the serpent, to give his aid.
They call upon the owl, who can see
in the dark; upon the wolf, who never
sleeps; upon the flame, which sweeps
everything before it on the prairie.
The dance goes on and a brave is
filled with the inspiration of war and
then another and another and they
leave off their prayers for aid because
they believe the aid has oeen granted
and with the blood-curdling shouts
which old settlers in Minnesota remem
ber they dance in wider circles, stamp
ing out their campflre preparatory to
beginning the fight, and chant in their
own language:
I wish for the speed of a bird, to pounce
on the enemy.
I look to the morning star to guide my
steps,
I devote my body to battle;
I take courage from the flight of eagles.
I am willing to be numbered with the
slain,
For even then my name shall be repeated
with praise.

As a child I went to sleep at night
with the stories of my old Chippewa
Indian nurse. She was a full-blooded
squaw who had married a French Ca
nadian who came on snowshoes across
the country from Canada. He had be
come very rich selling the furs which
his relations with the Indians through
his wife made easy of access to him.
He had brought back later a white
woman who was his wife. The Indian
woman said little. It was the usual
story. She had no redress and knew it.
One day the white wife, with her lit
tle boy, was sitting in her carriage
waiting before a store on Third street.
An Indian woman she had never seen
before was sitting on the sidewalk dis
playing her stock of moccasins and
beaded pincushions and watchcases,
which she had made to sell.
The squaw on the sidewalk watched
the white woman in the carriage, and
when the man who had taken her order
went back into the store the squaw
threw herself upon the white woman,
and before she could be dragged away
had beaten her into insensibility. There
was no recourse to the courts for big
amy, so the Indian woman took her
revenge and all St. Paul smiled and
the Indian woman was never punished.
She was a faithful nurse, however,
and we children loved her well and
loved her stories, too. She told us the
story of Hiawatha, though she had
never read Longfellow, for Hiawatha
was of the tribe of Indians who are
fighting now.
Old Betz was another squaw known
to every old settler, and sitting before
the fire on long winter nights roasting
apples on a shovel at the open fire
while the snow was beating against
the windows, I have heard my father
tell why she is always welcome when
she comes to the back door and says
she has come to stay a few days.
It all happened during the Civil War,
when most of the men had already
joined Colonel George to make up the
Second Minnesota at Fort Snelling, so
that few but women and children were
left at home. It was the old story of
Indian agents, who kept the rations
sent out for the Indians by the Govern
ment and sold nine-tenths of it to the
traders, who bargained it back to the
Indians in exchange for the furs they
should have paid for in cash.
The Government promised when it
took away the Indians' hunting and
fishing grounds, to give them annual
supplies if the Indians would stay on
the reservations, but the Great Father,
as they called the President, broke
every promise, and at last the Indians
rebelled and began to burn the homes
of the settlers and kill them.
People came in from New Ulm and
from Mankato to St. Paul. They were
afraid of the Indians, and well they
might be. Outside of Shakopee, a lit
tle town between Mankato and St.
Paul, lived Mrs. Alice Wilson. Her
husband had gone to the war, and she
was left alone on her farm with five
children, the eldest 13 years of age. She
made butter and sold it in the city. One
night the cows, after they had been
milked, refused to leave the calves and
go into a separate shed, but ran about
lowing and trying to entice away the
calves.
"Let them stay together," Mrs. Wil
son said. No one said "Indians," but
every one of the children thought it.
They were alone and live miles from
the nearest neighbor. A great fire was
built and after supper the little ones
were not undressed and put to bed as
usual, but huddled at their mother's
feet on the skins before the fire as she
sat and rocked the youngest. One lit
tle head after another drooped and
when all the watchful little eyes were
closed Mrs. Wilson laid the baby down
with the others.
Then she looked at the hammer and
lock of her gun and cleaned it care
fully. Next she melted her spoons
and molded them into bullets, quickly
dropping them into a pan of snow.
Next she took up a loose board in the
floor and took out four powder horns
and strung them over her shoulder. It
was very late and she knew that with
the first dawn if the Indians were near
she would have to fight while they
danced around her burning outhouses.
She sat down before the fire again to
get a little sleep to keep her strength
up when she heard a tapping at the
closed shutters; there were no windows
in the log house.
She was afraid to open them, but
called, "Who is it?"
"Sh-sh â open him."
She knew it was a squaw, but fearing
she came with the braves Mrs. Wilson,
with her gun, opened the door and
looked out. No one was in sight and
when the light from her flre cast a re
flection on the darkness a figure crept
stealthily around the corner of the
house.
"Sh-sh. I Betzâ ole Betz."
And it was "Old Betz." She told
Mrs. Wilson that the Indians were mur
dering the settlers and burning the
houses, but that she would have time
to escape as they were coming from
the north and all in one band.
Bundling up the children wakened
from their sleep Old Betz carried one
on her back and Mrs. Wilson carried
the baby while the rest walked the five
miles to the next neighbors.
And so Old Betz went from one house
to another warning the settlers to fly
and telling them which way to go.
Old Betz died when I was a little girl,
but I remember her funeral well and
how the men and women she saved that
night when hundreds of settlers were
massacred vied with one another to
show their respect.
Then General Slbley, Colonel Sibley
then, raised an army of old men and
young boys and drove the Indians back
to their reservation and brought back
prisoners, and thirty-nine were hanged
at one time in Mankato.
Bishop Whipple was among the In
dians then and tried to reason with
them, but it was not easy for him to

THOUSANDS PERISHED
FOR THIS $4,000,000 DIAMOND.
Was a Famous Tribe "Talisman" in JJfriea Till It Fell Into
the .Hands of Oom Paul K,ruger. Wljo Gave It to the Pope.
Pope Leo XIII has in his collection of
gems a diamond valued at $4,000,000, given
to him by President Krueger of the South
African Republicâ Pxess dispatch from
Rome, Aug-ust 28.
THE history of the valuable stone
which now rests within the
sacred confines of the Vatican at
Rome is written in the blood of
thousands of human beines. It
is a record of tribal warfare, cruelty,
heroism and savage witchcraft unsur
passed in the annals of modern times.
Nations have gone to war for the pos
session of the stone, and entire tribes
have been annihilated while trying to
protect It. The history of the famous
Kohinoor is commonplace when com
pared with that of the unnamed dia
mond that Is the pride of the Pope's
collection.
Only one person In South Africa
! knows the story connected with the
! dlumond before It fell into the hands
i of "Oom Paul" Krueger, the grand old
I man of the Transvaal republic. Not
i even Krueger knows anything: of the
; antecedents of the gift he made to the
! head of the Catholic church. And still
more astonishing is the fact that not
more than two or three of Krueeer's
intimate friends knew until recently
that he had ever such a valuable stone
in his possession. What object Krue
ger had in giving the diamond to the
Pope, whose emissaries had always
j been treated with scant courtesy in the
i Boer country, is a matter of great his-
tory.
The one person who can give the his
tory of the Pope's diamond lived a year
ago at a place in the Orange Free
State named Driekonjes. It is fifteen
miles west of Kroonstad. a town on the
railway which connects the sold fields
of Johannesburg with Cape Town.
Driekopjes has but a few buildings, and
these are occupied by Boer farmers and
diamond diggers. It is in the midst of
a level plain whose sunbaked earth
yields great quantities of small dia
monds to those who have the patience
to dig for them. During nine months
of the year the plain is an unendinsr
stretch of brown, dead grass, over
which the heat of the sun and the dust
bearing wind storms are twin rulers.
When the rainy season comes the
plains' desolate appearance is changed
into that of a vast garden of velvety
green grass extending as far as the eye
can read.
It is in that out-of-the-way place that
James Mallon, Charles F. G. Bishop and
John Fitzgerald, diamond "dry dig
gers," graduated from the Klmberley
fields, have been trying for four years
to find the diamond-bearing vein that
would make millionaires of all of them.
The "spruits," or creeks, yield enough
small diamonds to keep the men going
while they prospect for the "big
packet" that they believe exists in the
neighborhood.
The writer met Mailon, Bishop and
Fitzgerald in Johannesburg nine months
ago, and was Invited by them to visit
1 their "diamond farm," as they call it.
"You have seen 'Oom Paul' and the
rest of our celebrities down here," they
said, "and if you come to crur farm we
will show you the most interesting nig
ger in South Africa."
His name, is Memela, and although
he has lived almost eighty years his
mind is as active as when he was a
Kehla, or head man. of a Zulu tribe,
exactly sixty years ago. The life in the
! open has preserved his vigor . and
| strength to a remarkable degree, and
| of all the negro employes on the farm
none is more agile than he in operating
the diamond-washing machine or the
sieves of the dry sorters.
Subsequent events have proved that
Meraela's story was not one of those
Zulu leerends that are so common in
South Africa. The announcement from
Rome has proved that Krueger had the
diamond at one time, even though he
made the evasive yet truthful reply
last November.
Memela was averse to talking in the
presence of strangers, but the gift of a
few coins and several packages of
cigarettes, of which he, like all Afri
cans, is very fond, caused him to be
come mare talkative.
"Nkosi" (master), he replied, "it is a
tale of many words." And indeed it
was a "tale of many words," for the old
man consumed eighteen hours in relat
ing it. Deprived of many of its minor
yet interesting details, and with the
addition of dates of which he was ig
norant, Memela's story is given as he
recited it.
In the opening years of this century
the King of the Zulu nation was Chaka.
Local history calls him the Napoleon of
South Africa. His subjects were as nu
merous as the palms in the coast land
which he occupied, and his well-trained
army of warriors was as invincible as
the waves of the ocean that washed the
shores of his country. Memela's father
was erne of Chaka's head men, and this
honorable office descended to the son
when the old man died.
About 1820 Chaka sent a large body
of hia warriors with peace offerings of
many cattle to Moshesh. the King of the
Basuto nation, which dwelt 300 miles to
the westward. The object of the expe
dition was to form a coalition between
the Basutos and the Zulus for the pur
pose of exterminating the Pondo tribe,
which in some way had aroused the en
mity of Chaka.
King Moshesh, being poor in cattle,
was unable to make reciprocal peace
offerings of that nature, but fulfilled
the obligation imposed by native cus
tom in a more striking way. He sent
to Chaka the greatest gift that one
King could make to anotherâ the royal
talisman. That talisman is the dia
mond referred to in the dispatch quoted
at the head of this article.
The return of this expedition forms
one of Memela's earliest recollections,
he having been about eight years old
at that time. The story of the acqui
sition of the diamond was told to him
by his father, who accompanied Din
gaan and was one of that leader's
council. . .
"When Dingaan returned to Dugaza,
Chaka's capital, near the Umyoti
River, the King became very angry be
cause of the failure of the expedition,
and the reported refusal of Moshesh to
send a peace offering of cattle.
After the fruitless expedition to Mo
shesh's country Chaka sent out his
hordes of warriors to conquer the land
to the west of Zululand. It is esti
mated that in his wars of extermination
he killed a million blacks and held the
power of life and death over tribes oc
cupying- 200.000 square miles of terri
tory. So absolute was Chaka's power,
and so desnotic and tyrannical was ha
in his dealinfs with his chieftains, that
they wearied of his rule nnd became
terrified by his bloodthirstiness.
Dingaan originated the plot for the
assassination of his brother, and re
ceived the assistance of all but one of
Chaka's ill-treated wives in carrying it
out successfully.
Dingaan was ignorant of the intrinsic
value of the talisman which he wore
suspended from his neck until 1830.
At the close of the year 1837 Piet
Reitief and a large party of Boers, with
thirty slaves, crossed the Draaksberg
into the territory of Dingaan, for the
purpose of establishing a colony. In
this party were Paul Krueger, then
about 12 years old, and his parents.
Reitief applied to Dingaan for a grant
of territory, which was promised on
condition that they should recover for
him some cattle stolen from the King:
by a neighboring tribe.
Then began the war between tha
whites and the blacks, which cost the
lives of more than 600 Boers, who had
flocked together from Cape Colony and
what is now the Orange Free State to
avenge the death of Reitief and his
comrades.
On December 16. 1838, Commandant
Pretorius, who afterward became first
President of the South African Repub
lic, with 460 mounted Boers, encoun
tered Dingaan's army of 12.000 strong on
the banks of the Umhlatoozi River, and
in a fierce encounter routed the Zulus,
who left 3000 dead on the field. Dingaan.
led his defeated army into the moun
tainous region of Zululand. where hi 3
power was further weakened by the de
sertion of his younger brother, T~m
panda, and 4000 of his best warriors.
Umpanda made peace with his former
enemies, the Boers, and, uniting hi 3
forces with those of Pretorius, signally
defeated Dingaan.
The Boer commandant declared Um
panda chief of the Zulus after extract-
Ing from him a fee of 36,000 oxen for the
assistance given him in deposing Din
gaan. Dingaan's assassination took
place before he could realize his ambi
tion of defeating his brother in battle.
The youngest of his sixteen wives be
came enraged when he showed a prefer
ence for an older wife, and thrust an
npsaerai through hi? hpart.
Memela, being the lawful successor to
the Kins, took the talisman from the
neck of the dead DingÃan and strr>fi?Vit
way set out to find Umpanda. hoping
that that chief would appoint him
headman of one of his tribes.
Distinctly remembering the efforts of
the two prospectors to obtain the talis
man when it was the. property of his
king, he had taken the precaution to
hide it under the skins that hunt?
around his hips, and consequently
feared no harm from the. Boers on its
account. The Boers provided all the
food that the starving Memela could
eat and then compelled him to assist in
driving the cattle.
Thereafter Memela, the former head
man of the mighty Zulu nation, was
the slave of the despised white men.
When the Boer trekkers finally reached
a fertile spot a short distance beyond
the mountains they determined to settle
there.
Thus they lived for several years un
til they felt strong and numerous
enough to establish a government. This
was done without .the knowledge of
Great Britain, which claimed sover
eignty over the land.
During that period Memela and
young Kruegi.r became very friendly
with one another, and the negro's
wound was thoroughly healed. He
begged for permission to return to his
people in Zululand, and when the re
quest was refused he deserted the cat
tle he was guarding against a nieht
attack and started without provisions
or water on the four hundred mile
journey to Zululand.
He was overtaken before he had gone
a half day's Journey and was subjected
to most inhuman punishment by the re
vengeful Boers. For days he was com
pelled to perform the work of an ox
in one of the transport wagons. The
yoke was placed around his neck, and
whenever the ox at his side drew hard
er on the yoke than Memela the driver
cut open the negro's bare back with the
lash of a long rawhide whip.
This torturous punishment was con
tinued for four days, until Memela
dropped to the ground from exhaustion.
To hasten the healing of the wounds
on the negro's back and on the shoul
ders where the yoke had worn into the
flesh the Boers applied large quantities
of salt, which increased the pain a
hundredfold. Being unable to move,
much less capable of walking. Memela
was bound by his wrists and ankles to
the axles of one of the wagons.
The party had by that time crossed
the Vaal River into the country ruled
over by Moselikatse, an old Zulu war
rior who was driven northward by the
bloodthirsty Chaka.
Young Krueger, more kind hearted
than the others, secretly volunteered to
assist Memela to escape. The two went
to the river, a half day's journey dis
tant, with the avowed intention of
shooting the bucks and deer that con
gregated at the licks.
When they reached the river the fu
ture President of the Boer republic
gave to the negro a large gun and all
the provisions that he carried, and bade
him follow the course of the stream
by night and hide in the caverns by
day in order that pursuing partien
might not recapture him. Memela's
Joy was unbounded, and to show his
gratitude to his savior he took from
his groin skins the diamond talisman,
and gave it to Krueger.
The two separated, Krueger to return
to his people and assist several years
afterward In driving Moselikatse out of
the country into Matabeleland, and
Memela to reach a point near the riv
er's course, where he found a small
tribe of peaceful natives, who wel
comed him in their kraal. There he has
since lived, and there less than a year
ago he showed the purple stripes of the
driver's lash, and the indelible scars on
his shoulders, ankles and wrists.
Forty years have passed since the
diamond left Memela's hands, but ha
has forgotten little that he knew con
cerning it. According to his descrip
tion of it, the stone was so large that
he could barely encircle it With his
thumbs and forefingers. It was whiter
than any of the small diamonds that
the three diggers had ever found on
the Driekopjes farm, and consequently
must have been of remarkable bril
liancy, as the Vaal River stones are of
the finest quality mined in South
Africa. It was an octahedron in shape
and had no apparent blemishes.
Memela has become familiar with
diamonds since he has worked for MaJ
lon, Bishop and Fitzgerald, and as he
had the famous talisman in his posses
sion for many years its distinguishing
characteristics naturally became indel
ibly Impressed upon his mind, so that
he is able to give a good description
of It.

appear to regard our friendship with

not know of the link that biiids us, of my
amiable connection via Jamaica with Mr.

About that past ho displays an anxious
modesty. "I do not know what I should
do if it became known," he says, and re
peats in:pr<:Hsi\Hiy. As a matter of fact
I doubt if he would do anything except
get very red about the ears.
The beginning oÂ» this story goes a long
â¢way back; indeed it is now nearly twenty

Mr. Ledbetter, so to speak, into my

In those days I was living in Jamaica

Braved Death BY SEA to Reach Alaska Gold.
ONE of the most thrilling of ex
periences in trying to reach
Alaska is related by Captain G.
A. Hatfield of the Alaska-Yukon
Transportation Company, who
was foolhardy enough to start on a
voyage to the Arctic regions in the
stern-wheeler, James fiva. He took
his wife witfc him, too, as well as
forty-five of a crew, intending to work
the boat on the Yukon River. And
nobody now regrets the rash enterprise
more than Captain Hatfield, for he lost
not only his steamer, but all his per
sonal effects, and narrowly escaped
with his life. Also the Alaska- Yukon
Transportation Company is bemoaning
the less of an entire season's trade
on the Yukon, the profits of which, un
der present boom conditions, would
have run into fabulous figures. For
though the company built three fine
steamers for the Yukon, not one of
them was able to reach the river in
time for the season's trade. Therefore
the shareholders in this enterprise ara
despondent, and their only hope is that
better weather and big profits will pull
them through next year. The W. J.
Scammell and the H. H. Barling, both
built for this company, repose safely at
their mooring in San Francisco Bay,
while the James Eva, Captain Hat
field's boat, is somewhere at the bot
tom of the Arctic Ocean.
"We sailed on the 11th of June last,"
said Captain Hatflold on his return to
San Francisco a few days ago. "The
stern- wheeler was towed by the Na
tional City, and for a time all went
â well with us. The boat proved remark
ably easy in a sea way, so much so
that we never had to fasten a table or
chair. W> had flowers in vases all
over the cabin were never dis
turbed during the voyage. The James
Eva was very strongly built for a ves
sel of her class, and if we had only had
reasonable weather we might have
reached St. Michael all right.
"We caught it, however, on the 23d
of June, when we were about 600 miles
south of Unalaska and 300 miles off the
Alaskan coast. Hitherto the boat had
both towed and steered well, but when
we went right into the heart of a real
Arctic storm things changed somewhat.
The gale broke upon uÂ» from the south,
veering to west, and creating a very
heavy cross sea. The poor stern
wheeler rode the waves as best she
could, but they were too much for her.

to stand by ready to render assistance
when needed, and I can tell you it waa
a good thing fbr us that she waa tSerfl.

of quests and spies and condottieri and
many a risky blade-drawing business.
And suddenly came a doubt, a strange
doubt, springing out of some chance
thought of tortures and destruct
ive "altogether of the position he
had assumed that evening. Was lie
âMr. Ledbetter â really, after all, so
brave as he assumed? The Talkative
man had spoken enviously of crime. "The
burglar," he said, "is the only true adven
turer left on earth. And Mr. Ledbetter
had echoed his envy. "They do have
a me fun out of life." Mr. Ledbetter had
said. And he had laughed wickedly. Now
in this franker Intimacy of self commun
ion he found himself instituting a com
parison between his own brand of courage
and that of the habitual criminal, li
med to meet these insidious questioning
with blank assertion. "1 could do all
that," said Mr. Ledbeuer. "1 long I" do
all that. Only I do not give way to my
â¢ riminal impulses. My moral courage re
strains mo." But he doubted, even while
he told himself these things.
Mr. Ledbetter passed a large villa
standing by itself. Conveniently situated
above a quite practicable balcony was a
window, gaping black, wide open. Ji
ured himself climbing up that balcony,
crouching, plunging, into that dark,
mysterious interior. "Bah! You would
not dare," said the spirit of doubt. "My
duty to my fellow-men forbids," said Mr.
Ledbetter'B self-respect.
It was nearly 11 and the little seaside
town was already very still. He turned
and came back slowly toward the villa of
the open window, lie stood for a time
outside the gate, a battlefield of motives.
"Let us put things to the test," said
Doubt. "For the satisfaction of these in
tolerable doubts, show that you dare go
into that house. Commit a burglary in
blank. That at any rate is n â â  crime."
Very softly he opened and shut the gate
and slipped into the shadow of the shrub
bery. "This is foolish," said Mr. Ledbet
ter's caution. "I expected {hat, 1 said
Doubt. His heart was beating fast, but
he was certainly not afraid.
The ascent of the balcony it -was evi

trellis thinly set with young, ambitious
climbing roses made the ascent ridicu
lously easy. For a while Mr. Ledbetter
was as still as the night, and then that
insidious whisky tipped the balance. He
dashed forward. He went up the trellis
with quick, convulsive movements,
swung his legs over the parapet of the
balcony and dropped panting in the shad
â¢ yen as he had designed. His mood
was exultation. He could have shouted
to find he was so little afraid.
A happy line that he had learned from

mind as he crouched th<Te, "I feel like a

pected â this adventurous exhilaration.
And now for the window to make the
burglary complete! Would he dare to do
that? Its position above the front door
denned it as a landing or passage. For a
time he listened under the ledge, then he
raised his eyes above the sill and peered
in. Beyond was a broad landing faintly
gleaming, a flimsy fabric of bead cur
tain, very black and sharp against a fur
ther window, a broad staircu.se plung
ing into a gulf of darkness below, and an
other ascending to the second floor. He
glanced behind him, but the stillness of

"At last the trusses went altogether,
and there being nothing to hold the

saw that it was time for us to go. There

and one by one we dropped into the sea
and were pulled into the rescuing craft.
You can imagine what a task it was
when it topk four hours to save our
crew. Even then we had to leave
everything behind and were landed at
St. Michael with only what we stood
in. One enormous wave after another
would come swooping down upon us
while we were disembarking, shaking
the stern wheeler from end to end and
opening her seams still wider, so that
we wondered whether she would last
long enough for us all to get safely
away. Somehow we managed it, but it
was a pretty close shave, and the only
accident occurred to the mate, who had
his leg broken."

the night was unbroken. "-Crime," he
whispered, "crime," and scrambled softly
and swiftly over the sill into the house.
His feet fell noiselessly on a mat of skin.
He was a burglar indeed!
He peered about him, and suddenly the
critical spirit arose again. Burglars did

they forced safes. Well, he was not
afraid. He could not force safes because
that would be a stupid want of consider

the roomsâ he would go upstairs. More

dosed doors, and all the House was still.

would happen if some sleeper woke sud
denly and emerged. The open door showed
a moonlit bedroom, the coverlet white

in three interminable minutes and took
a piece <<f soap for his plunderâ his tro

softly than he had ascended. It was as

Footsteps! On the gravel outside the
house, and then the noise of a latch-key,
the yawn and bang of a door, and the
spitting of a match In the hall below.
Mr. Ledbetter stood petrified by the sud
den discovery of the folly upon which he
had come. "How on earth am I to get
out of this?" said Mr. Ledbetter.
The hall grew bright with a candle
flame, some heavy object bumped against
the umbrella stand, and feet were ascend
ing the staircase. In a flash Mr. Ledbet
ter realized that his retreat was closed.
He stood for a moment, a pitiful figura
of penitent confusion. My goodness!
'What a fool I have been!' he whispered,
and then darted swiftly across the shad
owy landing into the empty bedroom from
which he had just come. He stood listen
ingâ quivering. The footsteps reached the
first floor landing.
Horrible thought! This was possibly the
>mer's room! Not a moment was to
bÂ»< lost! Mr. Ledhftter stooped beside the
bed and crawb d within its protection not
ten seconds too soon. He became mo
tionless on hands and knees. The ad
vancing candle light appeared through
the thinner stitch's of the fabric, the
shadows ran wildly about and became
rigid as the candle was put down.

comer blowing noisily, and seeming to

Ledbetter, judging by the feet, decided
to be a writing table. The unseen then

turning sat down upon the bed with start

"What a day!" he said; "good Lord!"
and blew again, and Mr. Ledbetter in
clined to believe that the person was mop
ping his face. After a time he removed
some upper garments â a coat and waist
coat, Mr. Ledbetter inferredâ and casting
them over the rail of the bod remained
breathing less noisily and, as it seemed,
cooling from a considerable temperature.
"There is not going to be any trouble
this winter," he said, "because the
military authorities at the station have
taken precautions against overcrowd
ing. No steamer was allowed to land
her passengers unless she could show
that their transit up the river was al
ready provided for. We had made
through contracts to Dawson with a
number of gold seekers, and wherever
we could we arranged for passage on
some of the other river lines. When
this proved impossible we had to send
the passengers back to San Francisco.
No, I do not think there will be a
scarcity of food. When I left St. Mich
ael, on September 11, a great many
boats were still coming down the river,
but the people were all leaving for the
south. The river trade would cease at
the end of last month, and about the
middle of this month all ocean traffic
will be suspended and St. Michael will

thirty thousand tons of provisions
stacked there, an abundant supply.

our two remaining stern wheelers to

HOW TO POSTPONE OLD AGE.
DR. W. KINNEAR claims that old
age can be postponed by avoid
ing food in which earthy salts
abound. He says in The Hu
manitarian (London):
"Anatomical experiment and investi
gation show that the chief character
istics -of old age are the deposits of
earthy matter of a gelatinouÃ, fibrl
nous character in the human system.
Carbonate and phosphate of lime, mixed
with other salts of a calcareous nature,
have been found to furnish the greater
part of these earthy deposits. As ob
servation shows, man begins in a gela
tinous condition; he ends in an oaseouo
or bony one â soft in infancy, hard in
old age. By gradual change in the long
space of years the osÃlflcetion comes
on; but, after middle life is passed, a
more marked development of the ossiflc
character takes place. Of course these
earth/ deposits, which affect all the
At intervals he muttered to himself, and
once he laughed softly. And -j.r. Ledbetter
muttered to himself, but he did not laugh.
"Of ail the foolish things!" said Mr. Led
better. "What on earth am I to do now?'
What he should do he fourjd it difficult
to imagine. To wait Until this person had
gone to bed, and then, when he teemed
to be sleeping, to creep to the door, unlock
It and bolt headlong for that balcony,
seemed the only possible thing to do.
Would it be possible to jump from the
balcony? The danger of it! When he
thought of the chances against him, Mr.
Ledbetter despaired. He was within an
ace of thrusting forth his head beside the
gentleman's It gs, coughing if necessary to
attract his attention, and then smiling,
apologizing and exn.alning his unfortu
nate intrusion by a few well-chosen sen
tences. But he found these sentences
hard to choose. "No doubt, sir, fny ap
pearance is peculiar," or "I trust, sir. you
will pardon my somewhat ambiguous ap
pearance from beneath you," was about
as much as he could get.
"The position I had assumed," said Mr.
Ledbetter, when he told me of these
things, "was in many respects an ill
advised one. A transverse bar beneath
the bed depressed my head unduly and
threw a disproportionate share of my
weight upon my hands. But I had to
stay there motionless nevertheless."
After an interminable time there be
gan a chinking sound. This deepened into
a rhythm, chink, chink, chink twenty-five
chinksâ a rap on the writing table and
a grunt from the owner of the stout legs.
It dawned upon Mr. Ledbetter that this
chinking was the chinking of gold. He
became incredulously curious as it went
on. His curiosity grew. Already if that
was the case this extraordinary man
must have counted some hundreds
of pounds. At last Mr. Ledbetter could
resist it no longer, and he began very
cautiously to fold his arms and lower
his head to the level of the floor in the
hope of peeping under the valance. He
moved his feet, and one made a slight
scraping on the floor. Suddenly the
chinking ceased. Mr. Ledbetter became
rigid. After a while the chinking waa
resumed. Then it ceased again, and
everything was stillâ except Mr. Led
better's heart. That organ seemed to him
to be beating like a drum.
The stillness continued. Mr. Ledbet
ter's head was now on the floor and he
could see the stout legs as far up as the
shins. They were quite still. The feet
were resting on the toes and drawn
hack, as it seemed, under the chair of
the owner. A wild hope came to Mr.
Ledbetter that the unknown was in a fit
or suddenly dead, with his head upon the
writing table.
The stillness continued. What had hap
pened? The desire to peep became irre
sistible. Very cautiously Mr. Ledbetter
shifted his hand forward, projected a pio
neer finger and began to lift tin- valance
immediately next his eye. Nothing broke
the stillness. He saw nbw the stranger's
knees, saw the back of the writing table,
and thenâ he wns staring at the barrel of
a heavy revolver pointed over the writing
table at his head.
â¦Come out of that, you scoundrel! said
the voice of the stout gentleman in a tone
of quiet concentration.
Mr. Ledbetter came right out, a little
reluctantly perhaps, but without any
hanky-panky, and at once, even as he was
told. , Â ,
"Kneel," aaid the stout gentleman, "and
hold up your hands."
Mr Ledbetter rose from all fours and
held up his bands. "Dressed like a par
son," said the stout gentleman. A little
ohap too! You scoundrel. What the
devil possessed you to come here to-.
nlght? Vl
He did not appear to require an answer,
but proceeded at once to several very ob
jectionable remarks upon Mr. Ledbetter's
personal appearance. He was not a very
big man, but he looked strong to Mr. Led
better; he was as stout as his legs had
promised.
"What the devil, I say, possessed you
to get under my bed?"
Mr. Ledbetter by an effort smiled a
wan propitiatory smile. He coughed. "I
can't quite understand," he said, ' â
"Why! What on earth?â
"It's" soap! Noâ you scoundrel. Don't

"It's aoap," said Mr. Ledbetter. "From

BANANA FLOUR.
ANEW fad has been attracting
much attention in England. It is
the exclusive use of banana flour
in place of all other cereals, as a
diet for reducing an over abundance of
flesh. It is also "sed in St. Giles Hos
pital by the patients suffering from
rheumatism.
Banana flour is made by pulverizing
the banana which has been subjected
to a drying process. It contains no
gluten and is an almost exclusive arti
cle of food in many of the islands
where the banana grows.
The natives who live on bananas are
invariably not corpulent. The grocers
in San Francisco are being besieged
by their customers for banana flour, as
there seems to be a multitude of people
who wish there were not quite so much
of them.
physical organs, naturally interfere
with their functions. Partial ossifica
tion of the heart produces the imper
fect circulation of the blood which af
fects the aged. When the arteries are
clogged with calcareous matter there
is interference with circulation, upon
which nutrition depends. Without nu
trition there is no repair of the body.
"None of these things interfere with
nutrition and circulation in earlier
years. The reparation of the physical
system, as every one ought to know,
depends on this fine balance. In fact
the whole change is merely a Blow,
steady accumulation of calcareous de
posits in the system. When these be
come excessive and resist expulsion
they cause the stiffness and dryness of
old age. Entire blockage of the func
tions of the body is then a men* matter
of time; the refuse matter deposited by
the blood in its constant passage
through the system "stops the delicate
and exaalsit* machinery which .wÂ« caii

"If I might explainâ"
"Don"t explain. It's sure to be a lie,
and there's no time for explanations.
What was I going to ask you? Ah! Have
you any mates?"
"In a few minutes, if you â "
"Have you any mates, damn you. If
you start any soapy palaver I'll shoot.
Have you any mates?"
"No," said Mr. Ledbetter.
"I suppose it's a lie," said the stout
man. "But you'll pay for it if it is. Why
the devil didn't you floor me when I came
upstairs? You won't get a chance to,
now, anyhow."
"I don't see how I could prove an alibi."
remarked Mr. Ledbetter, trying to show
by his conversation that he was an edu
cated man.
"That's all right," said the fat man.
"But what to do with you I don't ex
actly know."
"1 know my position is ambiguous."
"Lord," said the man. "Ambiguous!
And goes about with his own soap, and
wears a thundering great clerical collar!
You are a blooming burglar, you areâ
if ever there was one!"
'To be strictly accurate," said Mr. Lea
betterâand suddenly his glasses slipped
off and clattered against his vest buttons.
' The fat man changed countenance, a
flash of savage resolution crossed his
face, and something in the revolver
clicked. He put his other hand to the
weapon. And then he looked at Mr.
Ledbetter, and his eye went dowff to the
dropped pince-nez. .
"Full cock now anyhow, said the Tat
man after a pause, and his breath seemed
to catch. "But I'll tell you, you've never
been bo near death before. Lord! Im al
most glad. If it hadn't been that the re
volver wasn't cocked you d be lying
dead there now." _ .
Mr. Ledbetter said nothing, but he reit
that the room was swaying.
"A miss is us good as a mile. Its
lucky for both of us, wasn't it? Lord!
he blew noisily. ; â¢ r â 
"I can assure you, sir, said Mr. Led
better with an effort.
"There's only one thing to do. II : I
call in the police, I'm bust. A little

going to do first my man, is an examina
tion for concealed arms. And look here!
When I tell you to do a thing, don't start
off at a gabble; do it brisk."
And with many elaborate precautions
and always pointing the pistol at Mr.
Ledbetter's head, the stout man stood
him up and searched him for weapons.
"Why, you are a burglar!" he said.
"You're a perfect amateur. You haven't
even a pistol pocket in the back of your
breeches. No, you don't shut up now."
So soon as this issue was decided the
short man made Mr. Ledbetter take off
his coat and roll up his shirt sleeves, and
with the revolver at one ear, proceed with
the packing his appearance had inter
rupted. From the short man's point of

was by no means an inconsiderable

black bag and on the table. There were
also many little rolls of Â£5 bank notes.
Bach rouleau of Â£25 was wrapped by Mr.
Ledbetter in paper. Those rouleaux were
then put neatly in cigar boxes and dis

Gladstone bag and a hatbox. About Â£600

Dared Death BY LAND to Find Alaska Gold.
ONE of the most dangerous and
probably the most perilous jour
ney ever attempted in the midst
of winter through the wilder
ness of Northern Alaska was
made two years ago by Joe Carroll and
Dick Martin, two San Francisco sail
ors who shipped for a whaling cruise
in the Arctic Ocean. They have just
returned from their adventures.
Late in the preceding autumn the
vessel was caught in an ice pack near
the line between Alaska and the British
possessions and the crew went Into win
ter Quarters.
Carroll and Martin claim that the
ship's officers were excessively cruel to
the men forward and as the long winter
darkness enveloped the land of per
petual cold the forecastle became un
bearable.
The seamen began to discuss plans
for desertion. Many of them had left
port heavily in debt to the boarding
houses and they knew full well that on
return to port at the end of the three
years' voyage they would be penniless.
To attempt to leave the ship and travel
through a wilderness and across wastes
of snow for a distance of 500 miles to
the nearest settlement meant almost
life. This is death. It has been proved
by analysis that human blood contains
compounds of lime, magnesia and iron.
In the blood itself are thus contained
the earth salts. In early life they are
thrown off. Age has not the power to
do It.
"Hence, as blood la produced by as
similation of the food we eat, to thiÃ
food we must look for the earthy ac
cumulations which in time block up the
system and bring on old age. Almost
everything we eat contains more or less
of these elements for destroying life,
by means of calcareous salts deposited
by the all-nourishing blood. Careful
selection, however, can enable us to
avoid the worst of them.
"To sum up: Avoid all foods rich in
the earth soils, use much fruit, espe
cially Juicy, uncooked apples, and take
dally two or three tumblerfuls of dis
tilled water with about ten or fifteen
drops of diluted phosphoric acid in each
glassful. Thus will our days be pro
longed, old age declared and health In
sured.**
"Do you know," said Mr. Ledbetter,
trying to get a fresh opening, "it was
that very questionâ"
The stout man waved him into silence.
"You should do one or two things. Either
you should forge or you should embezzle.
"Listen! Midnight! Tenâ elevenâ twelve.
There is something very impressive to
me in that slow beating of the hours.
Timeâ space, what mysteries they are?
What mysteries? It is time for us to be
moving. Stand up." , _,
And then kindly but firmly he induced
Mr. Ledbetter to swing the dressing bag
over his back by a string across his
chest, to shoulder the trunk, and, over
ruling a gasping protest, tb take the

So encumbered Mr. Ledbetter struggled
perilously down stairs. The stout gen
tleman followed with an overcoat, the
hat box and the revolver, making de
rogatory remarks about Mr. Ledbetter s
strength and assisting him at the turn
ings of the stairs.
"The back door," he directed, and Mr.
Ledbetter staggered through a conserv
atory-, leaving a wake of smashed
flowerpots behind him. "Never mind

the stout man reassured him. He s
quite alone. There's not a gang m the
world would own him. They went out
into the darkness of the garden with the
trunk still bowing Mr. Ledbetter s
shoulders. The house was one of those
that have their gardens right up to the
cliff. At the cliff was a steep wooden
stairway descending to a bathing tent
dimly visible on the beach. Below was a
boat pulled up and a silent little man
with a black face stood beside it. "A few
moments' explanation." said Mr. Ledbet
ter; I can assure you â " Somebody kicked
him and he said no more.
They made him wade to the boat, car
rying' the trunk; they pulled him aboard
by the shoulders and hair; they called
him no better name than "scoundrel" and
"burglar" all that night. They hauled
him aboard a yacht manned by strange,
unsympathetic Orientals, and partly they
thrust him and partly he fell down a
gangway into a noisome dark place,
where he was to remain many days â how
many he does not know, because h^ lost
count imong other things when he was
seasick. They fed him on biscuits and in
comprehensible words; they gave him
water to drink mixed with unwished-for
rum. And there were cockroaches where
they put him, night and day, and in the
nighttime there were rats. The Orientals
emptied his pockets and took his watch;
but Mr. Bihgham being appealed to, took
that himself. And live or six times the
five Lascarsâ if they were Lascarsâ and

him aft to Bingham and his friend to
play cribbage and euchre and three

ies and boasting in an interesting man
ner.
So Mr. Ledbetter fared for many clays,
twenty, perhaps, and one evening he, to
gether with some tinned provisions, was
taken over the side and put ashore on
a rocky little island with a spring. Mr.
Bingham came in a boat with him, giv
ing him good advice all the way. and
waving his hist attempts at an explana

"I am really not a burglar," said Mr.
Ledbetter. "You never will be," said
Mr. Bingham. "You'll never make a bur

Early the following morning the es
cape was discovered and a posse of
well-armed officers hurried in pursuit.
The trail was easily followed through
the deep dry. snow and snugly en
sconced in a little nook beneath some
tall timber the little band of deserters
was surprised. They were huddled
around a blazing campflre, tired and
weary from the day's tramp, little
dreaming that danger was so near. The
terrors, they thought, lay in the dis
mal forest to the south.
Without warning came the command:
"Throw up your hands."
Every man knew that that meant im
prisonment.
Like a flash they started for their
guns, but a volley of bullets killed one
sailor and wounded two more.

And the falling night found Mr. Led
better, the Mr. Ledbetter who had com
plained that adventure was dead, sitting
beside his cans of food, his chin resting
upon his drawn-up knees, staring
through his glasses in dismal mildnesfl
over the shining, vacant sea. He was
picked up in the course of three days by
a negro fisherman and taken to St. Vin
cent's, and from St. Vincent's he got by
the expenditure of his last coins to
Kingston in Jamaica. And there he
might have foundered. He had not the
remotest idea what he ought to do. Ine
only <hing he seems to have done was to
visit all the ministers of religion he could
find in the place to borrow a passage
home. But he was much too dirty and in
coherent, and his story far too incredible,
for them. I met him quite by chance.
It was close upon sunset and I was walk
ing out after my siesta on the road to
Dunns battery, when I met him-I was
rather bored and with a whole evening
on my hands, luckily for him. He was
trudging dismally toward the town. HI9
woebegone face and the quasi clerical cut
of his dust-stained, filthy costume caught
my humor. Our eyes met. He hesitated.
"Sir " he said, with a catching of the
breath, "could you spare a few moments
for what I fear will seem an increuible
story?"
"Incredible!" I said.
"Quite," he answered eagerly. No one
â¢will believe it, alter it though I may. Yet
I can assure you, sirâ" .
He stopped hopelessly. The man s tone
tickled me. He seemed an odd character.
"I am," he said, "one of the most un
fortunate being alive."
"Among other things, you haven t
dined?" I said, struck with an idea.
"I have not," he said solemnly, lor
""You* may tell it jjktter after that." I
said, and without more ado led the way
to a low place I knew, where such a cos
tume a3 his was unlikely to give offense.
And thereâ with certain omissions which
he subsequently supplied, I got his story.
At first I was incredulous, but as the wire
warmed him. and the faint suggestion of
cringing his misfortunes had added to his
manner disappeared. I began to Â£eheye.
At last I was so far convinced of his sin
cerity that I got him a bed for the night,
and "next day verified the banker's refer
ence he gave me through my Jamaica

our subsequent proceedings.

forth. At the end he repeated his re

they escaped into the dismal forest.
They were free but were without weap

For two or three days they were
hunted like wild beasts and then the
officers abandoned the chase and re
turned to the ship. The two men teil

SIX VERY SINGULAR RAILWAYS OF THE WORLD.
ON'K of the most recently built of England's
railways may claim the proud position of be
ing th" most singular of all. This is the Brigh
ton and Rottingdean Electric Railway, opened
in 1596, and demolished by the great storm of
December 4 in the same year. Since then the havoc
wrought by winds and waves has been repaired and
traffic resumed.
The rails of this single-track railway are laid in
the sea, and the singular-looking structure pictured
In the group rises from the water on four steel
legs, which run on wheels on the rails. Propelled by
Ihe electric current, this car, which represents the
company's whole locomotive and rolling stock, pro
ceeds at a slow and stately glide on its four-mile
: ed to make a record and wire ready
â¢ for any emergency that might arise. It
may surprise a great many persona to
know that the auxiliary force of the
! secret service during the \v;ir was
smaller than the local staff of a large
metropolitan newspaper; but as the
â¢ men were irmraualiy Intelligent and re
liable it was possible to satisfactorily
; cover the country with a comparatively
, small number of operatives.
Each operative was provided with a
cipher code for telegraphic purposes,
and when his territory had been as

stant touch with Washington. In my
private office at headquarters I had a
j large map of the United States, mount
ed in a flat cabinet, and by means of
small numbered flags attached to steel
] pins was able to locate every man <m
, the force at a glance. Montreal, To
. ronto, New York, Philadelphia, Wash
ington, Newport News, Savannah, Jac
ksonville, Tampa, Key West, Mobile,
: New Orleans, Galveston, San Francisco
; and the army camps were the principal
i points of activity.
Tampa was a particularly lively dis
trict, for in addition to the Secret Ser
! vice men in the field there a branch of
I the Military Information Bureau, un
| der the jurisdiction of the War Depart
ment, was maintained, and during the
; latter part of the war was useful in
looking after thefts of army stores, de
serters and military offenders of all
i classes.
aslonally, when the pressure was
particularly heavy, it became necessary
to detail the regular members of the
division to run out certain lines of in
vestigation, their expenses at such
times being defrayed from the defense
! fund. Of the thousand or more "sus
j pects" something over 600 men and
women were at one time or another un
der close surveillance for varying
periods, among them professors, diplo
! mats, doctors, merchants, cigar-makers,
] mariners, electrical experts. Govern
ment employes of foreign birth and un
certain antecedents, capitalists, milli
ners, dressmakers, society women and
servants. Every man in the service
was required to make a detailed daily
report covering his operations, and
there were revealed a great many Inter
esting things that had nothing what
ever to do with the Spanish-American
war.
The early establishment of a "crank"

Ing without a letter or two from some
irresponsible visionary or out and out

A no less convenient than curious railway is the
electric one which establishes communication between
Lynton and Lynmouth on the coast of North Devon.
Those two tiny towns are situated, one on the sum
mit of a particularly tall cliff 700 feet high, and the
other on the beach below. The railway climbs up this
cliff almost perpendicularly.
Do you know which is the highest railway In
England? The Snowdon Mountain Railway occupies
that proud pre-eminence.
The first sod of thin singular line was cut In De

lunatic. There were stacks of anony
mous communications threatening
death and destruction to every one con
nected with the â¢"unholy" war, and
scores of suggestions from demented
persona who had â¢"inspired" plans for
the annihilation of all Spanish emis
saries. Then there was a class of
cranks with hallucinations that they
were being dogged by Spanish spies and
in danger of assassination, while others
had overheard plots to blow up the
President and public buildings.
Where such letters were signed and it
was possible to locate the writer the
matter was always investigated, but in
no instance was the author found to be
a responsible person. Not all the cranks
stopped at Writing to the department.
Many of them called at the office and
were led gently away, introduced to the
guards at the doors of the treasury
building and thereafter refused admit-
! tance. One enterprising woman suc
ceeded in getting in to see me, how
! ever, with a unique scheme to ascertain
i the identity of the leading Spanish
i agents in this country.
"This is my plan," she said enthusi
astically, after Introducing herself. "As
soon as you engage my services I shall
go to New York and look about among
the theaters until I find where the most
patriotic audiences gather. Then at one
of the evening performances, when they
are all cheering for the United States,
I shall stand up in my seat and cry,
'Spain forever! Hurrah for Alfonso!'
Of course I shall be arrested and the
matter will get into the papers and I
shall be visited by the friends of Spain,
who will be convinced that I am a
sympathizer. So, gradually, I shall be
able to worm my way into their con
fidence until I shall have gained all
their secrets. Now won't that be
lovely?"
The chances being that If she tried it
the audience might not leave enough of
her to sympathize with and as she
looked as if her children might need at-
tention, she was advised to go home.
She departed reluctantly, thoroughly
convinced that the Government was
making a fatal mistake in declining her
services.
When the "emergency men," as the
temporary employes of the division
were termed, were instructed in the use
of the cipher code they were told that
in communicating with headquarters
they should use, instead of my name,
"John Ehlen," which I had registered
with the telegraph companies. This was
simply a precautionary measure in
tended to protect the operatives by
eliminating the chance that some one
might discover the message was for the
secret service, identify the sender as
a member of the division and destroy
his usefulness in that particular local
ity, if nothing worse.
Out of this arrangement grew a curi
ous incident. In the latter part of May

spondent, stationed in Washington, sent
in his card, asking to see me on im
portant and confidential business.
When admitted he explained that a tel
egraph operator, whom he had known
for years in the West, and who had
been transferred to the capital, had in
tercepted a cipher message from Mon
treal the night before and believed it
was from the Spanish headquarters to
an agent here. We were particularly
interested in the Spanish messages at
that time, having possession of a cipher
that was being used in some of their
correspondence, and the newspaperman
knowing this had suggested to his
friend the operator that the suspected
commu.nication be submitted to our of
fice.
He had tried to translate it, but was
un;ible to succeed, and he wondered if
we would have better luck. The copy
of the mysterious message, which he
then produced and placed before me on
the desk, was addressed to my alias,
the original, from one of my men, beina
in a drawer at my side. Under the cir-
cumstances I felt moderately certain
that we could get at its meaning, but
without explaining to the correspondent
I told him that if we did succeed lit
deciphering it and the contents were of
such a character as to permit of their
publication he should have a "scoop"
on it. This satisfied him and he went
away.
A little later I called up the telegraph
company and asked that the operator
in question should beJsent to the office
for a moment. In a few minutes he was
ushered In â a young:, bright faced fel
low, with plenty of color in his cheeks
and an air of suppressed excitement. I
only guessed that he felt his discovery
had been of value to the Government,
and he was to be rewarded in some
way. In reply to my question he de
tailed how he had received the mes
sage and how when it occurred to him
that it might be from one Spanish
agent to another he had surreptitiously
obtained a copy of it. The fact that it
bore no local address had made It
doubly suspicious, as it indicated that
it was to be called for.
"Didn't it occur to you to see if the
person to whom it was addressed was
registered In the office with delivery
directions?"
"No, sir."
"Well, if you had consulted your
company's books you would have dis
covered that I am 'John Ehlen,' and
that this is a Government message."
The poor fellow's face was a study
when he realized that he had held out
an official telegram and had turned it
over to a newspaper man. He appre
ciated the gravity of the offense in
violating his oath as an operator, and
felt that his position was as good as
gone, under circumstances that would
make it impossible for him to obtain
employment with any company. He
said nothing, but his eyes filled with
tears.
"Have you a family?"
"No, sir, but I am supporting my old
father and mother."
"Your motive was the best in the
world," I said finally, "but your meth
ods are open to criticism. Now, noth
ing shall be said to the company about
this, but if in the future you catch any
mysterious messages, just bring thsm
straight to me without intrusting them
to pny outsider. If your newspaper
friend had succeeded in translating this
message it might have been awkward
one of an hour.

Apropos of ciphers, there were sev
eral employed by the Spanish. There
was a "figure" cipher, which we were
unable to translate, and there was an
other whose mystery we solved. This
was rather ingenious, and as simple as
it was e'ever. The day of the month on
which the communication was written
was the key. For instance, if the letter
was dated on the 6th, the sixth letter
of the alphabet, "f," was used in place
of "a " "g" instead of "b." and so on.

timate knowledge of the American navy
and referred to his own services on the
Brooklyn.
Carranza first satisfied himself that
the man knew what he was talking
about, and then arranged for him to
go to Washington, where he was to
secure certain Information and forward
It to Montreal, for which point the for
mer Minister was to leave that after
noon. Instructions were given in the
use of the code for telegraphing, and
there was much further talk in a tone
too low to be understood; but the
stranger was finally heard to say,
"Then I am to write to this address in
Montreal?"
Carranza assented and our agent, be
lieving the visit was at an end, opened
the door and stepped into the hall. He
had timed his movements well, for Car
ranza was just bidding his visitor fare
well. Together the secret service man
and the stranger walked through the
hall, the former asking a light for his
cigarette as they passed down the
stairway. At the door they separated.
The suspect was shadowed to an ob
scure hotel, where it was ascertained
that he had registered as "Alexander
Cree," and that he was to leave the city
that evening.
That afternoon the following tele
gram in cipher was delivered to me:
"Young Southerner, Alexander Cree
of Hillsboro, I think, leaves for Wash
ington to-night. My height and build,
dark, small mustache, black soft felt
hat, black sack coat, black sailor tie,
somewhat shabby, evidently served on
Brooklyn; has intimate knowledge of
naval matters. Just had long inter
view with naval attache. He is to write
to Montreal."
The next morning arrangements were
made to "cover" incoming trains in
Washington, and by aid of the descrip
tion our man was picked out of the
crowd at the Baltimore and Ohio depo
there Is one intermediate stationâ that of Lisselton.
The system on which this railway Is worked Is called
the Lartigue Single Rail Elevated Hallway, and was
the invention of a French engineer.
This single-rail line, It should be explained at once,
is not a single-track railway, but actually has only
one rail for trains to run on. This rail Is supported
on iron trestle work at a height of three feet three
Inches from the ground, and the locomotive and car
riages are actually balance on it.
There Is nothing In Europe to compare with thÂ©
extraordinary trestle bridges which carry American
railways over the deep gullies and precipitous creeks
found In many parts of the United States. They are
of rough timber construction, sometimes rising to a
height of 150 feet, and form a most complicated maze
of timbers.
with as much ease as if we had been
furnished his photograph. From the
moment of his arrival every movement
was watched. He was evidently fa
miliar with the city, for he asked no
questions in going about. One of his
trips included a call at the Navy De
partment, after which he returned to
his boarding-house, 916 E street, N. W..
where he remained for an hour or so,
going thence to the Postoffice, where he
mailed a letter. This was promptly
secured and taken to headquarters. It
bore the address "Frederick W. Dick
son Esq., 1248 Dorchester street, Mon
treal," and was as follows:
WASHINGTON, Saturday, May
7, IS9S.â A cipher message has been
sent off from the Navy Department
to San Francisco, directing the
cruiser Charleston to proceed to
Manila with 500 men and machinery
for repairs for Dewey. A long
cipher has been receivr-d from
Dewey at department at 3:30 p. m.
They are translating it now. Can
not "find it out yet. Have heard
important news respecting raovo
ments of colliers and cru.ser New
ark at Norfolk nuA-y yard, also
about the new Holland noat, as to
what they intend to do witn her,
and her destination. I shall go to
Norfolk soon to find important
news. My address will be Norfolk
House, Norfolk, Va., but shall not
go until Tuesday. Respectfully
yours, G. D., in haste.
This fully confirmed the suspicion
that he was a hired spy, and warranted
immediate action. As his offense was
a military one I laid the fact before the
Assistant Secretary of War and the
judge advocate general, with the result
that a military arrest was decided up
on. Captain Sage of the Eighth Artil
lery, with a corporal and one man, was
ordered to report to me at the Treasury
building, and" at 11 o'clock that night we
arrested the suspected man in his room.
We rather anticipated a lively time,
but much to my surprise he wilted
completely when I placed him under
arrest, and he was led away without
resistance. A search of the apartment
resulted in the seizure of partly fin
ished letters to the same address in
Montreal, and documents establishing
the identity of the prisoner as George
Downing, naturalized citizen and form
erly yeoman of the cruiser Brooklyn.
In one corner of a bureau drawer,
otherwise empty, I found a scrap of
letter paper, upon one side of which
the address in Dorchester street, and
on the other these words: "Slater's
Code. To send add 100; to receive sub
tract 100."
This was the key to the cipher he wag
to employ, the system being one in
which thousands of ordinary words ar
ranged alphabetically have fixed con
secutive numbers of five figures each.
In preparing a telegram under the
cipher indicated on the slip the desired,
word having been found in the list, one
hundred would have been added to ita
corresponding number, and the word
opposite the higher number thus ob
tained would have been used in the
cipher message. In translating the
cipher, after ascertaining the number
associated with the word on the mes
sage, the subtraction of a hundred
would disclose the figures opposite
which would be the real word desired.
. The evidence secured in Downing's
room, considered in connection with the
consultation with Carranza and the let
ter mailed to Montreal, would have
been sufficient to insure conviction, and
the prisoner evidently appreciated the
fact, for two days later he hanged him
self in his cell at the barracks. It may
be added that the Dorchester street
house had been rented furnished by a
Spanish agent the day before Senor
Polo left Toronto, but it was soon after
given up.

The /tfong Qirls
of Honolulu.
Admiral Dewey was greatly disap
pointed at the failure of the Monadnock
U? arrive before August 13. and it is said
that he demanded an explanation from
Whiting. The court which is making the
Inquiry convened on the Baltimore to
day and will be in session for several
days -The Monadnock did not arrive here
until' August 16. and the cause of her
tardiness was her long stay at Honolulu,
and the fact that the Hawaiian capital
is the home of Whiting's family has ex
cited considerable comment adverse to
him.
CAPTAIN â  WHITING has been a
prominent figure in the navy ever
since his marriage to Etta Afong,
one of the thirteen daughters of a
Hawaiian mother . and the wealthy
Chinese merchant Mr. Ah Fong, who
amassed a fortune in Honolulu and
then returned to China to enjoy his
money amid the scenes and associa
tions of his earlier youth. These asso
ciations, be it said, comprised a couple
of wives; but all his daughters were
in the isles of Hawaii.
One day, about five years ago, Cap
tain Whiting sailed into the pretty lit
tle harbor of Honolulu and met his
fate. Etta Afong was then a pink
cheeked, almond-eyed bud, and Cap
tain Whiting was a gray-haired, pomp
ous, worldly wise gentleman of years
and experience.
Several of the Afong girls had mar
ried and all were married well, but the
Afongs have always loved the officers
and their girlish hearts swelled with
pride when Etta married into the navy,
and a commodore at that. And the
world at large, and the navy in particu
lar, wondered what effect this match
would have on Captain Whiting's posi
tion and how much of a pull at Wash
ington would remain to him.
The Pensacola navy yard was Cap
tain Whiting's first shore duty. This
has never been considered a desirable
post. It is small, and the society is
limited. The color line is strongly
drawn, and Mrs. Whiting's brunette
charms of blended Hawaiian and Chi
nese tints were not admired in this
Southern post. Later the Whitings
went North, and were stationed near
Port Townsend. Here society was of
some range, and if there were any
lines drawn nobody ever suspected it.
The Hetheringtons, of a notoriety
that extended from China, north,
south, east and west as far 'as the
latitude and longitude would allow,
were established here, and besides
there was a lieutenant who was on the
verge of a court martial, and a pay
master who was being sued for a di
vorce by his wife on grounds not com
plimentary to the paymaster. A third i
naval light at this post had run off
with another man's wife, and the Whit
ings completed this circle that the pen
of a Bret Harte alone might convert
into virtues reminiscent of the char
acters in "The Luck of Roaring Camp."
Then Captain Whiting went to sea in
command of the Monadnock. and at
last he came to Honolulu on his way to
Manila. ..
The day after he arrived here the
officer on watch reported a boat along
â¢ls Willie on board?" called up two
or three girlish voices in chorus.
"Willie? Who's Willie?" questioned
the officer, as he gazed down at a boat
load of girls in spotless, snowy muslins
and gay ribbons. .
"Brother Willie," cried the girls.
As the officer looked puzzled and tried
to recall a William from wardroom,
steera.ee or in the sailor's quarters, the
â ^SSTTS know Willie-Willie
"Go downstairs and tell Captain
Whiting that there are some young la
dies here asking for him," said the of
ficer, turning to an orderly.
"Sir," said the orderly, with sepul
i chral solemnity, as he saluted the
dignified Captain Whiting, "Sir, there
are eleven girls outside asking for
â¢Willie' Whiting."
The Hawaiian Islands are now won-
I dering if Captain Whiting's sisters-in-
I law made Honolulu so attractive to
; him that he could not tear himself
away. However, It is generally be
lieved here that Captain Whiting will
clear himself and be able to explain
satisfactorily the cause of his pro
longed stay in Honolulu.
And still the Afongs flourish in the
land of their birth, and they marry off
as they grow up with a oneness or
purpose unknown to the new woman.

showing some hold handling and luminous
coloring. This picture will doubtless at
tract considerable attention from the ar
tists.

figure composition in "The Nativity," be
sides showing a number of lanscapes, and
Mrs. Bertha Stringer Lee shows three
good studies. Her "Porch of the Court
house in Monterey" is very effective.

one of her charactertlstic grape studies,

Robert T. McKee has an unusual artistio
quality.
Robert I. Aiken, the young sculptor, is
another talented student of the Scuool

"Yes, but it was intended for a lady,

The foul breath from the dissecting
room rushed out and gripped me by the
throat. Through the swinging door
came frightful glimpses of that to
which we all must come if spared by
fire and worm. I saw my friend, the
medical student, bending over the cad
aver of a man. He had a very small
scalpel in his hand and I watched him
slowly and laboriously removing with
it the skin that covered the right leg.
This right leg belonged to him. He
had bought it for ten dollarsâ the price
of an extremity. I bought it from him
for the same price. He very civilly
offered to give it to me, with the time
i it would take him to skin it, but as he
had already explained to me that after
skinning the leg would be practically
; useless to him for dissecting purposesâ
i because he was dissecting nerves an
inch at a timeâ l as civilly refused. My
story was no news to him.
"This isn't the first leg I've skinned
for the same purpose," he said. "Legs
make the best belts. You can take the
skin right around the waist, but then
you have to cut into one of the other
extremities, and that's more expense.
So we take the leg. See," he showed
me the stretch of skin about the thigh,
"that's big enough for- any girl's waist."
"Do you think any girl would wear
it?" I asked.
"Well plenty would and plenty do.
Smart girls, too. They stand in line
and beg for it."

WAITING FOR
THEIR PROPHET
The Druses, the most mysterious re
ligious sect in the world, are now ex
pecting the coming of the prophet they
worship, the Hakim.
The war between China and Japan
and the threatened dismemberment of
the vast empire of the Orient were
events long ago prophesied by the
Druse priests. The first prophecy has
been fulfilled, the second will be ere
long, and then El Hakim will return in
In the land of Bashan, Mount Leba
non, Northern Syria, and In -very prov
ince of China his followers are praying
and watching for him.
In the tenth century El Hakim suc
ceeded to the throne of Egypt. Then
he was a murderer, an assassin and a
despot. When he comes again he will
be hailed as a god. For nearly nine
hundred years his followers have had
their religious meetings every Thurs
day evening, and yet have preserved
such secrecy that the world knows
nothing of their belief. Fabulous sums
were offered in vain for one leaf of the
book of their faith, and vet not a Druse
could be found who would listen to the
Pr E?Â°Hakim, the self-appointed, had an
interesting career. He began his reign
by the assassination of his sister. One
of his pranks was to cause several hun
dred Egyptian women to enterapublc
bath and then order them walled in to
P T S faVorite pastime with him was to
have women sewed up in bags and
thrown into the Nile. Yet after his
death El Druzi, a man of ability,
espoused his cause and wrote the Druse
scriptures. He bequeathed his name -to
the followers of El Hakim.
But because he tried to exalt himself
he was compelled to flee from the wrath
of his converts. He hid in an oven,
where some women, coming to bake
bread and indignant at his apostasy,
roasted him alive.
The fanatical followers of the Egyp
tian king are brave and loyal. In the
still hours of the night they meet to
worship. When they go forth their lips
are sealed. All that is known of their
religion is that they believe El Hakim
was God incarnated; that he had ap
peared nine times before, under nine
different names; that his appearance in
Egypt was the last time he will come
to earth as a man.
The most devout Druses are now in
China. It is among them El Hakim
will make his triumphant appearance.Latest Swallow-Jail

pretty gowns more. To the bride her
self the wedding gown is of secondary
importance, but to her friends, par
ticularly her bridesmaids, the gowns for
the occasion are the cause of many
â o.ixlous hours.
Since wedding bells are scheduled to
peal merrily and often this winter,
there will be sufficient bridal finery to
meet the demands of beauty-loving
femininity.
The first wedding notes to ring out

were attired in very smart gowns, ;tnd
the bride and bridesmaids, whose gowns
I am going to describe, were as charm

To call a gown a "creation" Ims be
eume so hackneyed that it carries very
little weight. That is the only reason
that I do not use it, for certainly Miss

artistic, but refreshingly original. Of
all gowns that tax the modistes, in

ornamentation.
The skirt was of white satin, demi
train and bo cut that while there was
an inch of unnecessary fullness at
the top it was very wide at the bot
tom. A bowknot of the same exquisite
point applique that was used on the
bodice gracefully outlined the front
panel of the skirt. One end of the bow
knot was caught at the waist line and
the other end was artistically draped
across the bottom of the front breadth
and caught down the other side of the
panel, finally â¢ falling over the
demi-train.
The bowknot on the skirt harmonized
with the smaller one on the bodice and
was caught up with bunches of orange
blOÃSoma. The point applique used for
the bowknots was a family heirloom.
Next to the bride's dress in point of

Miss Mac Moody as maid of honor

The front was cut apron effect
and ornamented with a bowknot of
narrow white satin ribbon. The bodice
was cut decollete, with the yoke and
sleeves of the mousseline de soie very
fnely corded. The apron effect of the
skirt was carried out for the front of
the bodice and tiny ruffles of the mou
seline completed the effect.
The bridesmaids. Miss Bernice Drown,
Miss Eva Madden and Miss Bertha
Dolbeer, were gowned exactly alike and
looked very winsome and dainty. The
skirts were of green taffeta, cut very
close over the hips and entirely covered
with white pompadour mousseline. The
pompadour mousseline comes in pat
terns and has a deep border that gives
the effect of an over-flounce.
Tiny pink rosebuds were scattered
over this mousseline and the border
was of the same coloring. The green
taffeta underneath gave the skirt the
appearance of a sheath of green sup
porting- the flowerlike bodice. The bo
dice was also of green taffeta and the
white pompadour mousseline embroid
ered in pale pink buds was laid over
it in soft surplice folds. This surplice
like effect is going to entirely supplant
the blouse effects of lost winter.
While none of these gowns that I
have just described are unduly elabor
ate, they, nevertheless, require an art
fest's touch in the making, and the ma
terials, while they are soft, are never
theless very expensive.
Brides who must economize should
show a great deal of discretion in the
selection of the wedding gown. To be
married in the traveling gown may be
very sensible, but it does not appeal to
most women. But even if white is
worn, it can be inexpensive and can be
Judiciously planned for future use.
Satin is undoubtedly very pretty for
the foundation, but it is -always expen

chased for almost half the cost of satin.

A pretty wedding gown can be made
of the inexpensive silk crepes and by
using this material the necessity of a
silk foundation is done away with. A
white glace silk can be used and the
overdress of chiffon can be dispensed
with. The cost of the wedding gown is
thus greatly reduced.
A very pretty white glace silk gown
was worn at a recent wedding. The
skirt had a tlounce of chiffon and an
accordion {Heated chiffon sash edged
with narrow chiffon ruffles. The bodice
was of the silk laid in soft folds with a
yoke and sleeves of tucked chiffon.

LATEST
PARIS JACKETS.
Special to the Sunday Call.
PARIS. Oct. 6.â The cool October
breezes have brought in their wake
the new fall jackets. They In no
wise resemble the modes that have
prevailed during the summer, and still
less are they like those that were worn
last fall.
The very latest thing is the "swallow
tail coat." It is modeled closely after
the masculine "swallow-tall," and a jabot
of lace or mousseline de sole takes the
place of the stiff shirt front. The jack
et may be closed at the front, and it is
then trimmed with reveres orna
mented with braid to give the jacket a
dressy air.
Box coats, cut after the "swallow-tail."
are going to be rather popular, although
the close-fitting jactets look more trim.
The redlngotes are cut with straight
fronts, but tit close into the curves of the
figure at the back. The high Medicis col
lar is usually trimmed with a bias band
of stiched cloth. The Bleeves are close
fitting. The bottom of the coat is cut
in a rounding point. The smartest of the
redingotes envelop the entire figure,
showing but a glimpse of the front of the
gown underneath.
Army jackets are not as popular on
this side of the ocean as they are on
yours. Those that are worn here are not
strictly according to army rules and reg
ulations. They are cut long, and the
broad, heavily stitched belt is fastened
at the front with a huckle. The top of
the sleeves and the edges have the strap
finish.
Capes are worn within twelve Inches of
the bottom of the gown. They are
trimmed with from one to three frills of
the same material. Some of these gar
ments show another shorter cape of a
different material, but shaped like the
under cape. Golf and shawl capes are
etill worn, but the new patterns are very
much longer.
For capes designed to show the gown
there are dressy little collets of velvet
and mousseline de sole. They reach a
bit below the waist line and are fashioned
in a rounding point at the back. This
length garment 1b the only one that short
women should affect. The long redin
gotes or capes are designed only for tall
women. A petite woman in one of these

NEW IDEAS
IN DRESS.
C C FASHIONABLE WOMAN," In
Jl \\ the Englishwoman, writes:
Jl *\ "The latest idea is to button
your skirt down the back. How
does this appeal to you? It will certainly
have the advantage of obviating any pos
sibility of the open placket hole, which
too often reveals the inharmonious corset
and unattractive petticoat. As a matter
of fact. I have no right to find fault at
the moment with the petticoats and stays
of the Egiishwoman. We have undoubt
edly improved vastly in such matters, and
new it is quite a rare thing to meet the
gray coutille stays and white linen petti
coat trimmed with Swis.s embroidery and
the high white slip bodice with the crochet
edging, formerly the almost universal
wear of your countrywomen and mine. I
have had an excellent opportunity of ex
amining the underclothing of the natives
at Cromer while bathing, and I find that
for the most part it Is very satisfactory.
"But among one of the most satisfac
tory costumes on the beachâ and one I
have quite forgotten to chronicleâ was a
dark blue, alpaca worn with a dark blue
eurah shirt, checked with" lines of white
beading, completed with a blue and red
and green plaid tie, the small blue toque
turning up in front with a large bow of
shaded blue velvet shot with red shading
off to orange. I am told that orange is
much sought after in foreign circles and
that a very pretty model hat tones from
the brightest note of the scarlet geranium
to the tone of the yellow nasturtium. This
would really be very trying to any but
the supremest beauty, although the finish
ing touch of black quills might soften the
harsh effect to some extent.
"It apears that buttons are to be muh
patronized, and there are many fanciful
designs btlng prepared by the manufac
ers In different sorts of metal and enamel,
the most successful of these being repro
ductions from the old designs in a com
bination of oxidized silver and dia
monds."
ghort, close fitting Jackets, after the
Eton order, showing the longer waist
coat with or without a band, some cov
ered all over with woven braid, are ex
ceedingly well worn. Just now the fronts
are often chiffon, but as the season ad
vance* this will give place to thicker
fabrics and smart waistcoats. Soft china
crepe sashes of bright color will sur

and fall in two ends at the back, and in
tea and many evening dresses the stole
ends will continue to droop from the front
of the bodice at the shoulder to the hem,
and several new ideas are displaying
themselves under thiÃ head. China silk
and gauae ribbons have the patterns upon
them outlined in gems and sequins, and
so have the lace insertions used for the
same purpose. Occasionally these are
drawn Into the figure by the belt, but are
often allowed to fall free. Sometimes
jacket fronts have a slit at the waist,
some three inches from the center of the
front through which the soft sash or
stiff waist-belt passes, leaving the imme
diate front unconfined. Most of the new
sleeves overhang the hands. Some tea
gowns are cut low, with elbow sleeves
made of piece laceâ much newer than the
chiffon even for those which come to the
wriat â then a lace scarf is carelessly
thrown about the neck, with the endo
falling downward. Once more we are
to have over and under dresses, which
take the form of tunics and of redlngotes.
Occasionally the latter are all lace.

I CHANCED to ring a friend's door
bell one day last week, fully expect
ing, as I did so, to be told that she
was out enjoying the balmy air and
glorious sunshine. Instead, I found
that she was at home, and was
shown upstairs to her own particular
sanctum. Here I found her coiled up
on her sofa, her black hair tousled, un
mistakable traces of tears upon her
cheeks and with lips pouting: like those
of a spoiled child, a heap of disconsolate
femininity. Her shades were closely
drawn, although the bright, glad sun
shine tapped upon her window panes and
peeped through the crevices of the cur
tains as though pleading for admittance.
"Whatever is the matter?" I demand
ed, "and why are you not out enjoy
ing this God-given day, instead of mop
ing in the dismal shadows of this room,
looking as though the world, the flesh
and the devil had lost all attractions for
you?"
"There!" she said, pointing dramati
cally with one slim finger to a small
heap upon the floor. "There Is the rea
son!"
By this time my eyes had become ac
customed to the darkness of the room,
and I stepped over to the heap and lifted
it in my hands. It straightened out
into a very handsome modish princess
gown of the shade of blue that is to be
so fashionable a color the coming sea
"Well," I said, looking toward the dis
consolate out*, and turning the frock
around and around in my hand. 'I see
no fault to be found with the cut of
that." . .- ,
â¢'The cut, no," she cried, springing
from the sofa, pulling up the shades and
taking the thing from my hands, but
the color! Look! Did you ever se^ any
one look such a color as I do in it?"
And, truly, the effect was startling.
The blue of the gown against her sallow
complexion and black eyes, which is the
most frequent type of the black haired
woman, seemed to bring out the most
peculiar shades of green in her com
plexion, while her eyes appeared luster
less and her hair looked Mke something
more than a smndgo of charcoal.
"That," she said, "is the gown that has
just been sent me by my New York
dressmaker, and over which I have been
making myself ill. Do you wonder?"
"But, dear child," said I, "why. with
your coloring, did you ever select blue?'
"I didn't.' she pouted. "I told my
dressmaker to wnrt me the very latest
color, and there it is."
"Yes" I said, "and had your eyes been
blue instead of black, your skin clear
and pale, instead of sallow, this color
could not have been improved upon. Then
you could have worn blue particularly of
the sapphire shades and of the Chinese
colors, such as come in the Canton crepes.
"With that type dark red might also be
worn; very pale shell pink, blue, grays
and white, both cream and blue, white
and black, both solid and transparent.
"But for your eyea and skin you will
find that nothing will form a better set
ting than black, relieved with white or
a dark, warm gray, and occasionally a
dull red or flame color. With your eyes,
which are unusually fine, the gown that
I would suggest and in which you would
look like a photograph from the portrait
of some old master, would be of black
material, wlih some transparent white at
the throat to cast light upon the face.
Dull, gold ornaments, or none at allâ
never Jewels. They are too brilliant to
be becoming to your type."
"All very well." interrupted the Discon
solate One, "but that does not relieve ray
mind in the matter of this gown. What
am 1 to do with it?"
"Give it to your sister," I cried, in
pplrationally, "her figure is very like
yours, and with her golden. hair, hazel
eyes and luminous skin, nothing could be
better than this blue, or, in fact, almost
any shade of blue from the turquoise
blue, through thÂ»- pale peacock blues to
blue gray and gray blue. Heliotrope in
all shades she can wear to particular
advantage, also olive green, light and
dark, black, mauve pinks, amethyst, pale
amber and cream white, but let her touch
blue-white, orange-scarlet, tan color, blue
purple, lavender and fawns at her peril.

pale delicate cheek, and pale golden or
flaxen hair, has opportunity for some of
the cool, delicate, refreshing harmonies
of color that she of the warmer type may
not venture upon. She may wear jet
black or blue-black, pale green with white
or with gray, all cold blues from dark to
light, purplish white, violet-pink, laven
der and pale pink. In nothing, however,
will she look more charming than In
diaphanous materials such as muslin,
grenadine, gauze or cambric.
"The colors to be avoided by blondea of
this type are yellow, greens, reds, warm
violets, cream wHlte. ambers, olives,

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
MRS. L. G.â Use peroxide of hydrogen
upon the superfluous hairs on the arms.
Apply with a small soft sponge. Massage
the baggy chin and throat with a good,
pure, home-made skin food and give them
an occasional alum bath. _A small piece
of alum the size of a bean, dissolved in a
pint of cold water, being quite sufficient.
AN OAKLAND GIRLâ Try bathing the
pimples on the chin with listerne diluted
in three times as much boiled water. If
that is not efficacious touch them with
tincture of myrrh.
MRS. M.â Never, under any circum
stances, take obesity pills or other adver
tised flesh-reducing medicines that you
do not know anything about. Exercise,
indulged in with discrimination, is excel
lent. The reason for this is not the phy
sical exertion so much as being in the
open air. Fat is carbonaceous, and oxy
gen destroys carbon. By taking plenty of
oxygen into the lungs carbon is consumed.
On the other hand, when . exercise in
creases the appetite and causes longer
hours of sleeping, it will increase rather
than reduce flesh. A diet of exclusively
lean meat, baked Bread, tea, coffee and
only vegetables that are grown above the
ground, will not Increase the weight, but
after a month will diminish it. Do not
sleep more than six or eight hours, rise
early, take a tepid bath and a breakfast
of "hot coffee without cream, milk or
sugar, and toast without butter.
For luncheon, lean beef or mutton,
crackers or dry toast, with tea or Coffee.
For dinner about the same with the addi
tion of one vegetable grown above the
ground. Exercise moderately and swim
in cold water as frequently as possible,
as this uses the carbon both in exercise
and to keep up the temperature of the
body.
Weigh yourself before starting in with
this regimen, weigh yoursejf again at the
end of a month and let me know of how
much flesh you have lost. Mind, you are
to eat nothing between meals.
E. E. E.â To reduce the size of the hips
a general reduction of fat is necessary.
Avoid all sugary and starchy foods. Ban
ish untoasted bread, notatoes. buttermilk
and fats from the daily bill of fare. Then
each morning go through the exercise* of
standing straight and touching the flavor
with your hands without bending the
knees. Buy your corsets of some one who
understands her business, and let her fit
you to a corset that is suited to your fig
ure. She can advise you better on this
point than L
INFORMATIONâ I fear I cannot help
you much as far as the large knuckles are
concerned. To soften, whiten and
plumpen the hands melt equal parts of
cocoa butter, oil of sweet almonds and
refined white wax. Rub this well into the
.hands before retiring. Them is. I believe,
a patented contrivance, thimble shaped,
which is worn on the ends of the fingers
to give them the desired taper. I cannot
tell you where you will find them.
BERTHAâ The formula for hair tonlo
which I gave you is as follows: Two
drams tincture cantharides, six drams es
sence of rosemary, eleven ounces elder
flower water. You can get the face brush
from almost any of the druggists in the
city. I cannot give addresses in these
columns. If you do not happen to know
the address of one send me a stamped
addressed envelope and I will glad to
send you name and address of a shop
where I know they can be procured.
LILLIE B.â Go to a hair store and buy
a roll, or "rat." as some people call ttiem.
Fasten to the hair and comb your pomp
adour over it. That is the only thing I
know of that will cause the hair to stand
out and have the fluffy look it should
have. To reduce plumpness of the neck
massage with some good cold cream,
taking the flesh up between the fingers
THE NEWEST ENGLISH COAT.
A pretty blonde walked along Upper Broadway one afternoon last week
creating a decided sensation along the Rialto. Her milky fairness of skin,
the rose tint of her cheeks and the unsightly "bun" in which she had her
beautiful hair twtlted, proclaimed her one of the newest importations in Eng
lish Gayety Girls.
But the sensation she created was owing to a most peculiar garment which
she wore, a direct importation from London, and one of the weirdest and
most wonderful fashions that have come to New York from the English cap
itfll
it was a coat cut exactly like a man's reaching from the collar to the hem
of the skirt. The material looked like a transparent rubber or a mixture of
silk and rubber, and its color was a pinkish, yellowish white that looked as
though it might feel cold and clammy to the touch. There was a collar of
velvet matching the oddly tinted rubber, but of darker shade.
and rolling and pinching it. Of coursa
the pinching must be gentle. This will
dissolve the tissues. Then in order to
keep the flesh from becoming flabby
bathe the neck in water in which a small
piece of alum has been dissolved. A piece
the size of a bean to a pint of cold water
is quite sufficient.
BLONDEâ I think if you will apply the
following sedative lotion to your face be
fore exposure to the sun and wind it
will obviate the excessive tendency to
irritation of the skin: Distilled wttch
hazel. 3 ounces; prepared cucumber juice,
3 ounces; rosewater, 1% ounces; essence
white rose, Vft ounces; simple tincture of
benzoin, half an ounce. Rub this into
the skin with the finger tips and let the
cuticle absorb it. Then apply a pure
vegetable powder. To put on flesh, first
of all you must bid a fond farewell to
the habit of fussing and worrying. Get
lots of sleep, and if convenient take be
fore rising a cup of hot milk or of milk
and cocoa well sugared. Take tepid
baths and exercise moderately. Eat all
the starchy, fattening foods, such as
rice, butter, cereals, eggs, milk and game,
tapioca, sago, vermicelli or custard pud
ding, macaroni, cheese and salad served
with plenty of oil. but no vinegar; they
are all good. Avoid pickles and acids of
all kinds. A teaspoonful of olive oil taken
several times a day. and frequent rub
bings of the body with olive oil, will help
the good work along.
CORA V.â The orange flower skin food
should keep your face from becomin
ruugh. Perhaps the blood becomes over
heated at times and dries the skin. Here
is the formula for a most delightful
cream, which is particularly good for
sunburn and for refining and whitening
the skin of the hands: Spermacet,
1 ounce; white wax, 1 ounce: oil of
sweet almonds, 5 ounces; rosewater, 1 3-5
ounces; powdered borax, 20 grains; es
sence of clover, 5 drops. The above
quantities will fill an 8-ounce jar, which
will last you all winter. The brown spots
on your mother's face and arms are
probably liver spots, and nothing will
banish them until the disordered liver
which causes them is remedied.
AGNES B.â Do not try to reduce the
size of your bust unless you do so by a
general flesh-reducing diet. All sorts of
harm can come about by trying the reme
dies that are said to make the bust
smaller. For the flabbiness, use the alum
bath suggested to Mrs. L. G. You might
try lemon juice and borax â fifteen grains
to the ounceâ on* those brown spots on
your hands; but if, as I strongly suspect,
they are liver spots, nothing in the world
â will permanently do away with them until
their cause (a disordered liver) is reme
died.
DIMPLE CHEEKâ To improve the com
plexion, follow the general health rules
which I have so often laid down in these
columns, and which, if you are a constant
reader of my department, you must have
s.i v more than once. For the freckles,
use^lfteen grains of borax in one ounce
of lfTnon juice. For the projecting bones,
massage each night with lanollne, partly
melted, and eat plenty of fattening foods.
The effect which you desire under the
eyes is neither healthy looking nor pretty,
and I cannot suggest any means by which
it may be brought about. Touch the
pimples with listerine, diluted with three
times as much boiled water, or with tinc
ture of myrrh. With a stout face, I would
advise drawing the front hair back and
up in pompadour style, rather close at
the sides, the long tresses puffed and
piled up quite loftily on top of the head.
MRS HENRY L. G.â ln order to gain
the amount of flesh that you desire, fol
low the directions given in foregoing re
ply to Blonde. To enlarge the bust and
add plumpness to the neck, massage with
equal parts of cocoa butter, lanoline ,an<l
cocoanut oil melted together. Heat before
applying and massage the neck and bust
every night for fifteen minutes. Wear
loose clothing and discard all pads. A
very good lotion with which to whiten
the skin is made by pressing the juice out
of the green cucumber and heating it un
til a wnite scum rises to the top. Skim
this and then strain. Dilute it about one
third with rosewater and apply each
" ADELAIDEâ A good face powder is
made by sifting over and over again one
ounce of Lubin's rice powder with three
ounces of pure oxide of zinc and adding
three drops of oil of roses. Better let
your druggist mix this for you, as face
powders are very troublesome to make,
unless one has the proper appliances.

THE GREAT TOLSTOI JUBILEE.
Russia Celebr sting His Fiftieth Anniversary as a Writer.
IT will soon be a half century since
a young Russian artillery officer,
murh addicted to card playing, lost
money which he did
not have in hand. To put himself
in the way of paying this debt of honor
he carried to the editor of a periodical
published in Moscow a romance which
he had composed in the Caucasus dur
ing the leisure moments of the opera
tions against Terek. It was "The Cos
sacks." the masterpiece of poetry and
melancholic philosophy in which the
nature and the primitive spirits of the
Orient, disguised up to that time by
the imaginations of romantic writers,
were seen for the first time in their true
condition.
Happy mischance! The young artil
lerist would have been much aston
ished, without doubt, if he had then I
been told that Russia and all the civil-
Ixed world would one day celebrate this
anniversary. And would he not have
been still more astonished if they had
added that the author, repenting of his
literary successes, would regard these
enthusiastic homages with more than
indifference?
To be exact. Tolstoi had already pub
lished in a review under an anonymous
name the first chapters of his "Recol
lections of Infancy," and this is the
reason for celebrating at this time the
semi-centennial jubilee of his career as
a writer.
Born in I*2*. and now aged 70 years,
Leon Nikolaievitr-h, Count Tolstoi, has
lived in all the forms of life. He has
: - I to write, nor written to live.
As he looked attentively about him and
within himself the strong images he
paw through the spectacles were in
their natural form put on paper, not
as a physician would design an ana

tomical figure, not for the sake of de
signing but the better to study man
and his maladies. Every time Tolstoi
took up his pen it was to bring more
clearly to his own eye the burning
questions. Why was he not happy, why
others were not more happy and by
what means could they be made so?
When quite young Tolstoi went to the
wars in the Caucasus and in the Cri
mea. He brought back from it ''The
Cossacks" and those wonderful "Pic
tures of the Siege of Sebastopol." ver
bal descriptions as exact as the report
of a field officer. He began quite early
to examine his life by the light of his
own conscience, to study his invisible
self. From this first self-examination
emanated the pitiless treatise of auto
psycholoary, " Infancy, Childhood,
Youth."
Resigning his commission at an op
portune time the ex-officer went to take
his proper position in the elegant so
ciety of St. Petersburg. He saw the
court and the world. Traveling abroad
he passed through all the excitements
and dissipations of the life in which
the men of his rank expended the sur
plus energies of their Russian nature.
He went to the extreme in all forms of
excesses with all the frenzy that they
had in the country and in the time
when a privileged few possessed mil
lions of serfs, raced their horses to
death over the snow for the exhilnra
tion of the mad speed in going of a
night to hear bohemian stollers voice
their songs of passion, and later de
manded more violent excitement at the
card table, where they would stake for
tunes, finally seeking to drown insup
portable reason in the wine cup. "The

Reconcile these contradictions if you
can and you will have the secret of the
penius of Tolstoi. Critics are at their
wits' ends in handling the young Rus
sian who writes: "I can well compre
hend the most atrocious crimes, com
mitted without aim. without desire to
injure, as it were from curiosity, from
an unconscious necessity of doing some
thing." "There are moments when the
future presents itself to a man in col
ors so dark that the mind shuns from
contemplating it. when he suspends
entirely the t-xercise of his reason and
forces himself to be persuaded that he'
will have no future and that he has had
no past."
li.nween times Tolstoi acquired by
various readings in all languages an
encyclopedic store of knowledge. Hav
ing seen men of all conditions and read
their lives, he wrote "War and Peace."

epic, as you ch>-i>so to call it. it is the

has ever been presented to any of us;

THE NATIONAL UNION.

tendance, and a number of matters of
After this evocation of the past con- j
temporaneoiiÃ society was called to the
witness stand in its turn. 'Anna Kare
nina" brought it before the judge â an
apt expression, when one looks at Tol
stoi in the presence of the men whom
he questions. Of the two grand ro
mances which take in all the Russian
life the second contains fewer ideas and
deeds than the first; it probes deeper
the wounds of the heart; it descries
the troubles of passion and the philo
sophic problems of the Russian con
science during the turmoil of souls
which characterized the reign of Alex
ander 11. Commenced about 1865, the
publication of the work suffered long
delays. Tolstoi abandoned it and then
took it up again, and only finished some
last chapters in 1877.
It is then at the moment when the
success of "Anna Karenina" fixed defi
nitely the supremacy of the author in
his own country, on the eve of the day
when his influence and his lame were
beginning to spread to other lands, that
the capricious comet wheeled in the
heavens, plunged into the night and
lost itself in the nebulae. Loon Niko
laievitch bid an irrevocable adieu to his
art, upon which he heaped anathemas.

then he has taken up his pen only to
write against that art, against the
civilization of which it wits a part,
against love, Avar, science and the es
tablished church. Theolcrgical, national
istic treatises followed each other with
out delay. "My Confession," "My Re
ligion" and "Commentaries on the Gos
pel."
This fettered slave to thought, whose
chains he wished to throw off, strove
to reach out and understand his life in
order to simplify it. He turned labori
ously in a circle of complications, al
ways the same. He did not knew what
he wished, but he wished it ardently,
and above all. he wished nothing that
already existed. He frequently gave
illustrations of his doctrine with short
parables and moral tales for the bene
fit of the people. Art is a demon which
one does not easily exorcise. Some of
these tales are masterpieces of a new
kind, as "Master and Slave." "For Why
Do Men Live," or as that moving and
forbidding drama, "The Powers of
Darkness."
The instinctive method of the great
realist triumphs and subjugates us in
the discussion of his subject, whether
he unveils the misdeeds of love in the
"Kreutzer Sonata" or denounces the
charlatanism of art in his last enter
prise of demolition.
"What is art?" A method whose es
sence is to strip the real fact of the tra
ditional verbiage, under which it ap
peared to us, and to show it simple,
naked and living. This direct view
gives an incomparable force to the crit
ical premises of this demolifher. We
yield ourselves to the evidence and
agree with him as to the poor nothing
ness which one finds under appear
ances, but we recoil by instinct and a
horror of a void from his conclusions
which lead us to the absurd to the
naught.
The indifferent old man â if one In
deed can be so to universal admiration
â merits the homage which comes to
him now from so many hearts con
soled by the simple lessons of life in
his pen pictures, from so many souls
enlightened by the rays which he has
projected to the depths of our thoughts.
His influence remains, and doubtless
will remain a long time, the most potent
of all those which at this time are ex
ercised in the â¢'pintual world.

STRIKING PICTURES
AT THE FALL EXHIBITION
Notable Canvases That the Hopkins Art Institute Wall Shov *k.
HE fall exhibition of art at the
T Hopkins Institute is primarily one
of landscapes and portraiture. The
absence of figure compositions need
not necessarily imply that our
artists are not equal to such ad
vanced work, for our past exhibi
tions have shown us what may Be
done in this line, but as long as tne
purchasing public show a substantial ap
preciation for canvases that do not in
volve much labor and may be sold tor
a small consideration, artists will, and
Justifiably, supply this kind of work.
While the exhibition is not as large as
some others have been. In quality it Is
all to be desired, as it contains some very
excellent examples of many well-known
artists. In looking over the various can
vases and scanning the different subjects
represented, one Is forcibly impressed
with the thought that the troublesome
spirit of our late war times must have
left its imprint in artistic circles, for
there seems to be an unusual expression
of stormy ideas. Such titles to pictures
as "Before the Storm," "After the
Storm," "The Approaching Storm/
"Summer Showers," "April Showers,"
"A Passing Storm," greet the observer
from all parts of the exhibition.
The main hall of the institution is at
this time and will be for future occasions
reserved for the permanent exhibition,
while the new work is hung in the ad
joining south rooms and the conserva
tories. This is to be regretted, for, while
the light in the main hall is not the best
â  luring the day, in the evening it is very
good and pictures may be seen to better
advantage than elsewhere. The Hopkins
institute at best is -a very undesirable
place to show a painting, for the decora
tions are so aggressive that any canvas,
no matter what its excellence, must suf
lVr in such a setting, and the artists who
from year to year send their work to
these exhibitions are long suffering and
extremely patient. The board of directors
appreciate the condition of affairs and a
movement is on foot toward the construc
tion of a gallery in connection with the
Institute.
Two hundred and forty-three numbers,
of which seventy are in the permanent
collection, constitute the exhibition, and
among these are oils, water colors, pas
t<is. miniature paintings, pen and ink and
pencil ilrnwings ana four pieces of sculp
ture, besides which there is a collection
of twenty-five sketches contributed by
artists for membership dues, which will
be distributed by lot to members on the
last Thursday night of the exhibition.
Delsarte said "art is feeling passed
through thought and fixed in form." One
sometimes wonders what kind of fpeling
must have rasped some poor mortals to
give forth such expressions. Then Louis
F. Day says "the art is in the saying and
not in the thing said," and again one
sometimes feels "words, only words," but
there is another side to tnis. We have
our painters in prose and our painters in
poetry, and while some will give us the
former expression there are others whose
conceptions are tender and full of feeling.
There are pictures which, not being
narrative nor literary, are beautiful har
monies and melodies of line and color
that appeal so lovingly to those who see;
and where a beautiful poetical idea is
thus rendered we have a masterpiece.
Such a one is that of "The Camp by the
Crops." by Charles Rollc Peters. A well
knowr artis' to-day remarked tha' Mr.
Wallace of Stockton and J. J. Gosper of
Los Angeles, formerly Governor or Art
z.ma. In addition to the lecture, \vhi<h
wag an illustrated one on the lata war
with Spain, there were given dramatic
readings by Daniel E. Hanlon and vocal
selections by a quartet of male voices.

El Capitan Division No. 115 of the OrtÂ«r

the social hall of the Alcazar building
last Wednesday niÃht. There was a
large number present, and aft&r an ad
dress by W. V. Stafford, there was a
good programme of musical and literary
! numbers, at the close* of which thr- mem
bers and guests partook of a choice colla

THE AMERICAN GUILD.
San Francisco Chapter of the American
Guild at a meeting last Wednesday night
Peters is the most distinguished artist
that has been in our midst for many a
year, and it is evident to any observer
that this is the common feeling of artists
generally when studying this woncierrui
canvas. To most people who were inter
ested in our visiting soldiers it will recall
the camps when seen at night, the lighted
tents looking like great opals relieved
against the dark hills In the background,
all of which was especially beautiful on
a moonlight night.
To all of this the artist has added a
poetic suggestion by using that most in
teresting San Francisco landmark. Lone

templative mood over a campflre in the
foreground.
This picture is so characteristic of a
phase of life of the past year and so al
together charming as an art product, that
it seems as if it should belong to San
Franciscoâ and be the property of the
Art Association where it might be acces
sible to all art students.
Mr. Peters has four canvases, all of
which are excellent. His "Moonlight,"
No. 153, is such a tender little bit that it
stimulates a very strong desire for pos
session.
R. D. Yolland shows a number of very
able products, in which a marked indi
vidual style predominates. His work is
always conscientious and thoughtful. In
composition and drawing in landscape he
has few superiors. His "Sunrise and
Showers" is very happy.
William Keith delights his host of ad
mirers by his two very beautiful pictures,
"April Showers" and "California Oaks."
In both we find hi? usual charm of mys

entertainment was a pleasing one and all
participants were richly rewarded with
applause, the ladies with bouquets. After
the programme there was a dance until
midnight.
Inter Nos Circle celebrated its fifth an
niversary by a grand ball last Thursday
night in Union Square Hall. There was

in the prettily decorated hall the effect
was charming.

more growth in his work than Joseph

some excellent qualities.
H. J. Brewer disappoints his many ad

bluster and delielous conceits; but so
are plays of Shakespeare's which will
not run two weeks, say nothing of two
months. And the critics who wrote the

with Shakespeare, didn't know just

he makes no mention of its translation
it is safe for any one familiar with his
work to say that this portion of the no
tice was written some time ago, prob
ably weeks before the opening took
place.
Yet, as I have said before, Mansfield
has had months of glorious advertis
ing, and this may pull him through the
season. The newspapers are great ed
ucators: Persons who never heard of
"Troilus and Cressida" know all about
"Cyrano de Berperac," and will not rest
until they see him and his nose on the
stage. I hope that Mr. Mansfield's
production may live to see San Fran
cisco. We are fairly burning for some
thing special, difficult and exclusive.
And even should the Alcazar keep its
word and give us nasal specialties, that
need not damage the prospects of
Mansfield's season. However, I shall
not believe the Alcazar's "Cyrano" un
til I see it. They plotted Ibsen on
O'Farrell street last year, and the Ib
senites are still waiting for him.

whatever is good in the drama.
Of New York taste for light things at
the theater Mark Twain says in the Oc
tober Forum: "You are trying to make
yourself believe that life is a comedy,
that its sole business is fun, that there
is nothing serious in it. You are ignor
ing the skeleton in your closet. You are
neglecting a valuable side of your life;
presently It will be atrophied. You are
eating too much mental sugar; you will
bring on Bright's disease of the intel
lect;"
These are epigrams from Henry Arthur
Jones' play, "The Liars," which John
Drew is presenting in New i'ork:
The one cruel fact about heroes la. that
they are made of flesh and blood.
Marriages are made in heaven, and if
once we set to work to repair celestial
mistakes and indiscretions we shall have
our hands full.
A secret liaison means in the end every
inconvenience and disadvantage of mar
riage without any of its conveniences and
rdvantages. It means endless discomfort,
worry and alarm. It means constant
sneaking and subterfuges of the paltriest,
pettiest kind.
The only objection to telling fibs Is that
you get found out. Not if you arrange
things not perhaps exactly as they were,
but as they ought to have been. In that
way a lie becomes a sort of idealized and
essential truth.
Since his arrival in this country Hall
Came. the English novelist, who came to
s.;e the dramatic production of his '"The
Christian," has attracted no end of com
ment regarding- his eccentric appearance
on the streets and the odd wearing ap
paref that he displays. The latest story
going the rounds, that the Manxman re
sembles Christ in his appearance, has
prompted Leandf-r Richardson to observe:
"I don't know that Hall Came is respon
sible for the industrious circulation of the
report that he bears a close resemblance
to the Savior, but the idea must have
originated in some highly imaginative
mind, for it is utterly without foundation
in fact. In reality Mr. Came looks like a
singed Irish terrier. His yet-up is spec
tacular. There is no doubt that in the
field of fiction Mr. Came is among the
most powerful writers of the time, but
what he needs is a shave and a hair cut
and a rational suit of clothes."

UNHAPPY HOUSE OF HAPSBURG.
THE tragic death of the Empress
of Austria startled and horrified
the whole world, hut especially
those who, like that unfortunate
lady, were seeking health and
recreation in beautiful Switzer
land. The rumor which was spread
around the lake on September 10
seemed an impossible one, especially to
us who live in sight of the hotel at
Caux, where her Majesty was staying.
Few people who saw the svelte figure
and youthful face of the Empress only
a week ago on the shores of the Lake
of Geneva would have believed that she
was in her sixty-first year. The most
beautiful woman of her time, whose
wealth of golden hair and regular fea
tures were renowned and whose viva
cious and amiable expression and no
ble character told the story of the af
fection in which she was held by her
pe6ple.
The Empress was the second daugh
ter of Duke Maximilian Joseph of Ba-
varia, and was born In the romantic
castle of Possenhofen, on the lake of
Starnberp. Her mother, Ducness Lu
dovica Wilhelmina, was a sister of
Princess Sophia of Bavaria, who was
the mother of Emperor Francis Jo
seph.
A marriage was practically arranged
between Francis Joseph, who was then
only 23 years old, and the eldest daugh
ter of Duke Maximilian Joseph when
the young Prince was sent to the cas
tle of Possenhofen to make the ac
quaintance of his future bride. The
Prince dismissed his carriage and at
tendants on the borders of the forest,
Intending to finish his journey on foot.
After a short walk he found himself
on the shores of the lake of Starnberg
with the prospect of a long detour if
he could not find some one to carry
him across. Fortunately, he discov
ered a young girl in a boat near the
shore. He hailed her and she con
sented to take him across. He was
much struck by her extraordinary
beauty and, concealing his identity,
talked to her all the way over.
Great was his surprise when she was
presented to him that night as his Cou
sin Elizabeth. From that moment he
abandoned his suit with her elder sisÂ«
ter, who was greatly disappointed and
has never recovered from it. At a ball
given at Ischl the 16th of August, 1853,
the Emperor never left the side of the
Princess Elizabeth and at the end of
the evening he emphasized his atten
tions by presenting her with a superb
bouquet. Nevertheless the Princess
was greatly astonished when her hand
some cousin proposed the next day.
"It is Impossible," she exclaimed.
It took several days to convince her
that he was really in earnest and the
betrothal was not announced until
Aupust 24.
The first years of married life of the
Emperor and Empress were supremely
happy. Both young, handsome and at
the head of the greatest power of the
time, life seemed to hold everything
for them. Then commenced the series
of disasters which seem to have
reached- a culminating point in the
death of the Empress.
First came the death of their eldest
child while still in infancy.

Qod bliss the dear Krandmas of the

that "Bella Pateman was smart and

Then the Emperor's favorite brother.
Maximilian, with his beautiful wife,
left full of hope and confidence to
found a new empire in Mexico, but in
reality to lay down his brave young
life to appease- the wrath- of the Mexi
cans. Poor Carlotta still drags out her
existence in a madhouse.
Then followed the death of their sec
j ond cousin, mad King Ludwig of Ba
j varia, who drowned himself and the at
! tendant who tried to save him in tha
' Tegernsee. During all this Austria
I was experiencing great political trou
i bles, which ended in the fall of Aus
trian power on 'the field of Sadowa.
j The Empress has done more by !i r
; sympathy with Magyar iÂ«it-as to avoid
! open revolution and to attach the peo
ple of Hungary to the. dynasty than
all the schemes of statesman. The de
monstrations of affection for the impe
rial couple at the celebration of- their
silver wedding in 1879 will always be
remembered.
The Emperor said to Dr. yon Smolka
at the time of the Crown Prince's
death: "How much I owe to my wife
in these days of bitterness and what
a support she has proved to me I can
not describe." It was the terrible
death of her only son that told so
greatly on the health of the Empress
and obliged her to travel constantly in
search of the peace which she has only
just found. The mystery of Rudolph's
death has been discussed and explained
in many ways, but I think it la BOW
generally conceded that he and the poor
Baroness Marie Vecsera met their
death at the hands of her uncle. She
was engaged to be married to her un
cle and her family greatly approved of
the match. She, however, cared noth
ing for him and announced her inten
tion of aroing to Meyerling with the
Crown Prince. Her uncle told her it
she did so he would kill them both, and
as she persisted he carried out hist
threat. She was carried at midnight,
clad only in a wrapper, by her uncle
to the convent of the Nuns of St. Croix
at Heiligenkreuf, near Voslan and bu
rled. The only witness of the deed
was the coachman, who was induced
by large sums of money to leave the
country and who died within the year.
It was evidently thought safer to get
rid of him.
It seems strange that a cousin of Ru
dolph's widow, Prince Baldwin of Flan
ders, whose brother recently visited the
United States, should have been found
dead in as mysterious circumstances.
In this case the wild young Prince, who
was heir to the Belgian throne and ne
phew of the present King, was sup
; posed to have met his death at the
i hands of his uncle for not showing suf
i ficient respect for a lady the King ad
mired.
Among other things that have
grieved the Emperor and Empress was
the elopement of a cousin, a Princess
of Bavaria, with a young German of
ficer a few- years ago.
The court was plunged into mourn
ing for the sister of the Empress, tne
Duchesse d'Alencon, who was so terri
bly burned to death in the Charity L'.;t
zaar lire in Paris a little over a year
ago. And just recently great anxiety
has been felt at Vienna over the possi
ble fate of the Queen Regent of Spain,
who was an Austrian Archduchess, and
her little son.
Added to all these sorrows, the Em
peror has the grief of knowing that the
empire will probably fall at his death,
as he has no. worthy successor.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 15.â There was little
change In the character of the stock market
to-day, the erratic tendencies of the leading
Industrial specialties keeping the general list
generally unsettled. The opening decline was
general and was reflected from abroad. Both
tobacco and sugar went down at the opening,
but Sugar reached the point of resistance and
encountered large buying which put the bears
on mettle again. They covered quite freely,
and ran the price up to 112. Urgent demand
then stopped for the day, but the range was
held above last night's close. Tobacco dropped
oft* 3<4 points to 114%, and closed at about the
lowest. The continued disposition of Northern
Pacific to sag also checked any upward tend
ency and discouraged activity in the railroad
list. There was a conspicuous movement In
the late dealings in Louisville and Southern
preferred. Trade attributed this to the pros
pects of relief from the yellow fever by the
coming of cold weather, but in the case of
Southern railroads there were reports of an ap
proaching dividend declaration. The picking
up of high grade dividend stocks in small lota
was a continued healthful feature of the mar
ket. A feature of the dealings In the outside
market was the new Federal Steel Company,
the securities of which are to be listed on the
Stock Exchange Monday. The stock market en-
Joyed a brier upward reaction toward the mid
dle of the week owing to a recovery In the
group of stocks which has exercised an un
settling Influence â  for some time past; but
a ' ' recurrence of weakness in the
stocks has led to surmises whether their re
covery was not due simply to the closing of
a bear speculation, leaving them for the future
â without even the sustaining force of a large
outstanding short Interest. The advance in
the general list lias halted on account of thl3
doubt in si':' i of the many undercurrents of
strength which have manifested themselves.
There Is a general confidence In the strength of
the financial and .business uutiook so that when
Tobacco began to advance on the strength
of the announced acquisition of an opposi
tion plug tobacco plant and Sugar
gave evidence of resistance to the
long decline with the reported " advance in
price of low grade refined sugars and Northern
I a '.fie was heavily bought by the same brok
ers whose earlier selling waR said to represent
Inside conflicting Interests the small room
traders all turned from bears to bulls, and
large financial interests proceeded to bid up the
price of â¢ properties in which they were inter
ested right merrily. But Sugar, Northern Pa
cific and Tobacco all turned downward again
and brought to the surface only more the ele
ments of doubt and hesitation.
It is accepted as the natural order of things
In Wall street that there shall be a period of
dullness and reaction preceding a Congres
sional or Presidential election. There Is felt
to be room tor some uneasiness also over the
foreign political situation, the domestic un
rest in France, the Anglo-French situation,
the conflict of Interests which may be precipi
tated by the extraordinary events in China and
the money stringency In Berlin. . The latter
part of the week has seen a relapse Into dull
ness In the Stock Exchange and a renewal of
bear tactics which is always a feature of bull
markets. The â  events of the week in financial,
circles were the advance in Bank of England's
minimum rate of discount from 3 to 4 per cent,
the sharp rise In the private discount rate In
London in response to â  â â¢â¢- bank's borrowings
from the market and the rise in the rate of ex
change in London and Paris. The effect has
been while the demand and cable transfers on
London have hardened In New York those in
Paris and Berlin have fallen In spite of the
advance in discount rate of the Imperial Ger
man bank to 6 per cent Â«nd â ' Austrian bank
to 4H per cent on Monday. It Is clear enough
that the Bank of England la maneuvering to
divert the movement from the United States
for gold upon Paris and London. Meantime
money rates In New York are tending steadily
downward, so that money in cheaper here than
in any of the other great financial markets
except Paris. The credit balance which is be
ing accumulated Tn this â "-ntry's favor in
stead of being drawn upon is left at interest.
The week's increase of $10,023,300 In loans by
New York banks must be accounted for in largo
part by the investment movement in sterling
exchange. The September trade statement
shows a favorable trade balance of over $42.
000.000. for nine months past of $393,955,091, and
for twelve months past of $593,591,330.
The past week's demand for grain for ex
port, future engagements of vessel room and
offerings of future exchange against grain de
liveries, seem to fix the conviction that the
world will absorb our large surplus of wheat
at good prices and thus insure a further large
increase in the country's heavy trade balance.
The market for railroad bonds has been
rather dull, but there has been a good demand
I for high grade investment bonds. United
. States new fours advanced 3%: do coupon and
I the old fours coupon, %; the threes and fives,
I ft, while the old fours registered declined 1 %
in the bid price.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. Oct. 15.â Financier says:
Owing to the heavy increase of $6,337,400 in the i
business of New York clearing house banks for
the week ending October 15, reserve require
ments rose four millions and over. The gain
of $5,000,000 in cash, due to receipts of specie,
more than counterbalanced the extra require
ment on reserve account, so that in the face of I
an expansion of $10,023,300 in loans, the surplus- !
cash in bonks increased nearly $1,000,000. This, j
it is needless to say. is a very favorable show- I
ing. The changes, as usual, can be traced to
the operations of a few banks, one institution !
having made about half the new loans and '
gained accordingly In deposits. But aside from
this, there seems to have been a general de- |
mand for accommodation that has swelled the j
total of a large number of institutions. The j
banks report a firmer demand for money from -
the interior, and their shipments last week I
aggregated perhaps $2,000,000. On the other !
hand, the treasury disbursements and receipts j
from abroad resulted in a gain in cash about j
as reported In the statement. The Increase in !
loans as reported was much heavier than had j
been anticipated, and caused some surprise. It i
cannot be set down to transactions with the â 
treasury, as its bond transaction is about
closed. The general business conditions and
the speculative situation do not seem to war
rant the sudden activity in this particular, and
it is probable that the loans reflect an accumu
lation of foreign credits In the form of long ]
sterling bills,- rather than domestic transac
tions. The position of international exchanges,
owing to advancing rates abroad, and the
heavy demand for grain, will tend Inevitably to
the postponement of gold imports and their
conversion into sterling loans. This does not
mean that the balance owing to the United I
States abroad will be settled without gold Im- !
ports, but that the proOCM of borrowing by j
Europe will be repeated. The record of Sep
tember exports, which were exceeded only once I
for the same month in the history of the coun- !
try, and of imports, which continue to show a
diminution. Indicate a balance at the end of
the year over that of any known. What the j
balances of the last year meant is best read In i
the records of gold imports. There is nothing
to Indicate that the same process is not to be
repeated," but with about $90,000,000 of treasury 'â 
money In the banks It is difficult to say how |
soon the effect of IS9B. exports â  will thus be
shown. One thing is certain, there is nothing
in the situation to indicate an advance. in rates,
as the treasury policy tends to the opposite
result; . â¢ -
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet to-day with a great
improvement. Americans were â¢ exceptionally
dull on the New York lead, but the absence of
sales by that market caused a favorable dis- ,
position here.
There is much uncertainty as to whether New
York Is buying gold or not. Half the press, for
example, say this morning that New . York
bought yesterday's gold arrival from the Cape,
while the others say that- Berlin bought It.
From reliable quarters I learn that New York
is not buying for the moment; indeed, an In
formal report is - current that ' New York Is
lending money in the market. Spanish 4s and
Kaffirs were better on Paris improvement.

Though they continued to send reports or
large export engagements the news had much

advices to-day might be duplicated, One un
favorable feature of the market, and one which

i course of prices, was the weakening of the

1,682.000 bushels, against 1,203,000 a year ago.

The men flew about with astonishing
speed and, leing over their momentary
panic, they made every movement
count to ihe best advantage. I took

and midnight darkness fell at once.
From this cloud came the most awful
lightning and the most terrific peals of
thunder of which I have ever had any
knowledge.
"A bolt of lightning struck our main
topmast and ran along it down into the
hold. We were not left long to guess
what damage it had done. A puff of
smoke came trailing up from the hold
and we knew that our powder-laden
vessel was on fire. Wherever the fire
was it could be only a few seconds be

powder, which was in barrels.

lifeboat afloat in a jiffy and jumped in,
not waiting to get water or provisions.
Our only thought was to get as far
from the schooner as possible in the
shortest possible time. our oars
creaked with the weight we put on
them. I had the steering gear and was
free to look back. Ido not suppose
that any of you youngsters ever had a
chance to see a vessel blow up at sea.
I do not think that you are anxious to
have such an experience under similar
conditions.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1898.
BEN AND THE
BOX OF COLO
BY ALMA S. BEMENDERFER.
TREBORVILLE was built in a
gulch among the hills. To the
north loomed up the mountains,
which se -ned from their rugged
outlines to have been simply
tossed up, ledge upon ledge, and in the
general turmoil left unfinished. In one
of the cabins on the hillside lived Ben
Otis, who was noted for being one of
the laziest boys in town.
1 icing of an indulent, dreamy dispo
sition he often forgot the practical
meaning of life. Besides reading books
of a fanciful turn he was a firm be
liever in fortune tellers, signs and
kindred theories. Yet of one thing he
was firmly convinced; that he was des
tined to become rich and famous, but
not by attentiveness or hard work.
To this end he fell into a certain line
of reasoning and when a fortune tel
ler came to the camp Ben at once
visited her slyly. Although a believer
in the art he would not brave the ridi
cule of his friends.
Giving him a seat after studying his
hand some minutes she said:
"This is the hand of a person possess
ing remarkable traits of character and
of a liberty-loving nature. He has
never taken either time or o casion to
lay the foundation for a useful life,
but possesses the key to a vast treaa
ure box."
"Where is it?" asked Ben, excitedly.
"It is one of the treasure boxes made
by the giant who molded the moun
tains and he will unlock one of the
when found.
Ben was very much elated. To be so
gifted at once made him look with quiet
disdain on the toilers in the mines and
even men who had once excited envy
looked insignificant. After all what
was there in Treborville? A lot of
shacks, jumbled together in a gulch;
a couple of quartz mills, even the reser
voir in the distance looked small and
ludicrous.
Ben laughed. He would stay no
longer. No, he would go to the moun
tains and look for the treasure box.
Bidding his parents good-by, with a
light supply of food and a pick and
shovel he set out toward the moun
tains. Here, tramping through under
brush, scaling steep banks, standing at
grave risk upon narrow jets of rock
and crawling to th" very edge of preci
pices searching for the mystic box or
< xploring caves and working with pick
and shovel he met with alaj-ming ad
ventures, ofttimes nearly losing his
life.
At last, weary and disheartened, he
was about to give up. One night he
dreamed he was digging- on the moun
tain side. The giant suddenly ap
peared and askÂ£d him what he was
seari hing for.
"For one of the treasure boxes, but,
although I have braved a hundred
dangers, I have not found Jt."
"No wonder," replied the giant slow

DAVID H.
WALKER
ly, "for you have not the faintest idea
of its appearance, and so have many
times passed it over, although owning
the key to unlock it. Yet I respect
you for having begun the search.
Heretofore you have only dreamed.''
"Then there is hope for me? I may
find it? Will you show it?"
"No; that is impossible. But I can
help you by showing how others are
doing. They are working no harder
than you. but by rules."
By this time Ben was very much
interested. He wanted to learn at
once. The giant did not walk fast
enough. At last they came to a tun
nel, and going through it came to a
large cave. Here were many people.
LITTLE
MR
PLEASANTFACE
With a groan Ben noticed they were
all intently engaged in some work.
"This is the proper way to begin to
search â by a method. Select some
work; do the very best you can."
Uttering a cry of anger Ben fled
through the tunnel out of the moun
tain, hearing the friant in close pur
suit, anil was no sooner outside than
out bounded the "ii.nt. Ben was 1 will
ing to take desperate risks to get away,
and so he ran out to the edge of a gorge
and jumped. Then the giant called all
nature to witness and at once there
sounded a song of disapproval, and the
breeze swayed a tr â < so far forward
as to catch Ben in its branches.
"Nature is against you!" shouted tht?
giant, looking down.
Ben was so angry he shook his fipr
and said some pretty mean things. The
giant laughed and tho^tree swayed so
Ben came near falling off. At this ho
called for mercy.
"I'll do anything!" he screamed. "I'll
work."
Just then Ben awoke. He still lay
on the mountain. The sunlight glinted
through the trees. After such a night
of terror, believing in dreams, he re
turned to Treborville. His friends
were surprised at the change, tor Cram
an indolent, careless lad he has become?
one of the most industrious; and last
summer he found a deposit of gold in
a hole that has made him rich. The
hole was just the shape of a box and
so Ben still believes in dreamsâ but
works.

THE MISTER
LITTLE MISTER FUNNY BOY
concluded that he would move to
San * rancisco, especially as the
remainder of his family appeared
to be about to go. Everything
breakable, like pictures and looking
glasses, had been carefully placed at
the bottom of great wagons, and a cook
stove had been laid upon the doll car
riage of his big sister. So Little Mister
picked up everything that he could find
around the yard and filled an old valiÃe
with the odds and ends. Then he was
ready, and cried because the "choo
choo train" was not also ready to take
him away from his native heath.
No one could carry his valise except
one of his sisters, "for," he said, "I'se
drefful 'tickler 'bout it, mamma."
Several small boys snickered as they
saw what he had placed in his valise,
but no one disputed his right to be con
sidered a mover, on equal terms with
his "grown up folks." The valise
crossed to San Francisco exactly aa he
had packed it.
"Mustn't get overboard." said Little
Mister, as he looked over the aide of the
ferry boat. "No â o â o, for I might get
my feet wet, couldn't I, mamma?"
Just then the whistle on the boat was
blown, and it sounded to Little Mister
like a roaring lion, and he hid his face
In his mother's lap. The whistle roared
at Little Miater only once, and soon
one mischievous eye peeked out and
then another. Then a sweet little voice
said bravely: "Ise not afraid, am I,
mamma?"
Such wonderful cable and electric
cars at the foot of Market street.
"Z-iom, zoom, dat is what cars say,
isn't it, mamma?" he remarked. He
was safely in a car, but the vehicle
started rather, suddenly and Little Mis
ter fell. His conscience caused him to
remark that "I didn't mean to throw
the car over, did I. mamma?"
Among the satchels and bundles the
valise of Little Mister was lost to view.
Little Mister made search* but could
not find it. Two rosy lips were pouted.
Two brierht eyes took on a look of
mingled seriousness and fun. One little
voice said with much emphasis, "Ise
mad with you, isn't I, mamma?"
"00, 00, bigâ bigâ bigâ hills," said
Little Mister a few minutes later, as
the cable car in which he was riding
appeared to be trying to stand upon
end, and he was treated to a slide along
the smooth seat toward the rear door
and the conductor â the wonderful man
who had a bell to play with and who
was authorized to shout "all aboard,"
and who had on a coat that fairly
twinkled with shiny brass buttons, a
real hero to Little Mister, wr looked at
the bell ringing man with great satis
faction, and tried to get a smile from
that person.
Up hill and down hill. By and by
the conductor, who had b<">en calling out
the names of the streets with regular
ity as the car passed the crossings on
the way to the Western Addition, said
in a particularly stern voice, "HIDE!"
Where should Little Mister hide, he
not knowing that the conductor was
simply calling out the name of Hyde
street?
What was the matter with hiding
ostrich fashion, concealing only his
head in mamma's dress? Two little
feet kicked nervously, revealing the
consciousness of the owner of them
that perhaps the conductor might think
that he had not fully obeyed the com
mand to "hide." Two little hands, evi
dently acting upon the same prompt-
Ing, cuddled themselves snugly to
gether and were as still as little mice
asleep in the hay in a barn nest. One
Little Mister made his whole person as
small as ever he could and then lay
motionless until his wonderment got
the better of one little curly head. "I
did hide," finally said a small and sweet
voice, "but the man never said ready.
I won't play with him enny more, will
I, mamma?"
By and by the car stops, as all cars
must stop some time, and all persons,
great and small, having arrived at their
destination must stop; and here Little
Mister was once more placed in posses
sion of his valise and its assorted treas
ures from the forsaken home. Enter
now into his new residence The King,
High Caliph, Great Mogul, He-Who-
Must-Be-Obeyed â otherwise Little Mis
ter, ruler uncommon and indisputable.
In the middle of his new realm he Is
left standing alone.
There are other rooms for him to de
velop the treasures of his valise in, but
HOLD THE FLAG HORIZONTALLY AND SEE SEVEN HEROES.
none could have seemed quite so ap
propriate to him as the parlor. His
mamma and his other slaves of various
ages have gone away and he is free to
follow his own royal will to its sweet
conclusion. When his retinue return
the valise is open. Upon the "best car
pet" are mud pies, mud cakes and mud
balls in fragments. Some rest inno
cently on the pattern of the carpet.
Others, moistened up for the occasion,
are in sticky lumps everywhere.
"Nice, isn't it, mamma?" asked a lit
tle voice in all the innocence and loving
trust of childhood.
What must come next in such sto
ries? Little Mister, wearied by the la
bor and care of packing and moving
and unpacking of his treasures, like
many another who is a slave to own
ing things, finds that he is weary. Per
haps his sharp little eyes see that some
one does not think that he has im
proved the appearance of that house
hold fetish, the best carpet. At any
rate a little voice says as softly as any
cooing bird while little hands are held
up appealingly, "Wok me, mamma."
'Hush, my babe," sings a loving
voice to the crooning song that has
soothed so many generations of little
people on their way to Dreamland.
Closer and closer draw the eyelids to
gether and now the soft and regular
breathing tell that Little Mister has
begun to whisper to the fanciful little
people who, iike himself, now inhabit
slumberland, and what they learn from
him is that â "Ise moved."
What they say about this must please
Little Mister, for he smiles sweetly in
his sleep, his little pink hands held
closely together as If they were holding
tightly the treasures of his 'â¢v'lise."

Her father owns a fine orange
grove and lives in a nice house,
and Kittie has her pony and
pony cart, and with her little
brother Frankie she^ plays happily
every day. One day* she was in the
garden, when a Chinese woman came
along. The woman was crying and
Kittie, who is very kind hearted, asked
her why she cried.
"Little Ah Jim, my boy, has been
stolen by a bad Chinaman and they
will take him away to China and I will
not see him any more."
Kittie knew a Chinese gardener and
she told the woman to step into thej
garden. H;ir<ily had the woman en
tered when she threw a shawl over
Frankie's head and ran off with him.
She turned a corner, entered a carriage
that was waiting there and rode rapid
ly away before Kittie had recovered
her presence of mind. Everything had
taken place so suddenly that Kittie
hardly thought to scream until Frankie
was out of the garden. Then her cries
brought the gardener.
Kitties papa soon heard over the
telephone what had happened, and he
came home in haste, pale and excited.
His first move was to call for his saddle
horse; his next to unloose his blood
hound. Then he drove away with the
bloodhound following him.
Where the carriage had been lost to
Bight Kitties papa saw something on
the ground. It was a toy that Frankie
had been playing with and which the
Chinese woman had thrown from the
The hound saw the toy and
sniffled at It The next instant he
barked and ran down the street in the
direction of a county road.
Then and there was a hot chase. An
hour brought into sight the carriage
that had carried Frankie away. It
was drawn by two hnrpps, but they had
been overdriven and Frankie's father
caught up with them. The Chinese
woman had the carriage stopped and,
leaping out. ran away.
Frankie was in the carriage alone,
unharmed, but very much frightened.
The bloodhound caught the Chinese wo
man and held her until Frankk-'p father
came up. Phe said that she had been
ordered to steal the little boy by some
highbinders, who had threatened to kill
her if she refused to obey th^m. This
proved to be true. Th^ highbinders
wanted to make Frankie's papa pay
money to have his boy returned. But
they "failed. Hearing what had hap
pened they ran away and have never
been seen since.

MORE SMOOTH PAVEMENTS.
Merchants' Association Working for
More Improvements Downtown.
L. M. King, superintendent of the street
department of the Merchants' Associa
tion, who has just returned from the
Eoat, Is very mtioh gratified over the
progress made iff street improvement in
the downtown thoroughfares. All of this
work was started by the association's ef
forts before he left. The last block to fall
Into line is Sutter street, between Kearny
and Grant avenue, which is to be paved
with . bitumen. In the next block, be
tween Grant avenue and Stockton street,
half of the property owners have signified
their *vlllingness to stand the expense of
having the old round cobbles removed and
a basalt pavement put on a concrete foun
dation substituted. The grado forbids a
bitumen pavement, but the one proposed
will serve well. The surface will be al
most even, and the cracks between the
blocks being tilled with asphalt or tar will
make it a modern roadway, smooth and
clean.
The efforts of the association are being
directed toward Sixth street, the desire
being to have a bitumen pavement laid
from Market street to Folsom. This will
give a smooth roadway from well down
Market street to the Mission, via Sixth
street, for light wagons and bicycles. A
large number of the property owners
along Sixth street have already slened for
the improvement, and the belief Is that
by making this the smooth avenue be
tween downtown and the Mission It will
increase the importance of the retail busi
ness there. In the near future California
street, between Montgomery and Kearny,
will bo paved with wooden blocks, the
same as the street opposite the Phelan
building. The grade is too stt-ep for bit
umen, and the bankers In the block wish
to have a noiseless pavement. Prooably
the worst block In the city is the one
between Battery and Sansome streets, on
(Hay. It Is a mass of hummocks and
chu'ckholes. and the fruit and vegetables
that find their way Into the gutters make
the place malodorous as well as unsightly.
A bitumen pavement Is to be laid mere,
moat of the property owners having
signed and after the improvement Is made
the block will be washed every day or so.
Want a School Building.
A committee of ten residents of Sunny
side appeared before six members of the
Board of Education at the city building
yesterday and asked for the construction
of a $5000 school building in their district.
The Sunnyside people complained that the
present rented shack is an eyesore and is
unfit for the purposes of a school.
The committee was referred to Mayor
Phclan for advice. The Mayor stat3d that
it was possible that the Supervisors mipht
appropriate $5000 out of the m*w firemen's
fund, received from the foreign insurance
companies, or possibly there would be no
garbage contract, and then the Super
visors could give $5000 out of the money
Bet aside for the garbage. The Sunnyside
committee will present a petition to the
Supervisors on Monday.

WOULD ESTABLISH A
SCHOOL CF DAIRYING
VARIOUS SUBJECTS CONSIDERED
BY THE BUTTER-MAKERS
Refrigerating Machinery a Necessity
to the Success of the Creameries.
Old Ways Do Not Pay.
A number of very Interesting papers
were read yesterday at the second ses
sion of the fifth annual convention of
the California Dairy Association, meet
ing In the Chamber of Commerce rooms.
One by ueorge E. Peoples was on the
subject of "Refrigerating." He said that
refrigerating machines are absolutely
necessary in the creameries, especially
In the hot valleys of the State. The
necessity comes from the high standard
of gooirs that the people have come to de
mand. The machine process permits a
gradual cooling of the cream, which the
direct application of ice does not, and
the effect of the latter is a greater loss
of fat.
George W. Church of Sonoma discussed
the advantages of silage for milk pro
duction. "The Manufacture of Brick
Cheese" was the subject of a paper read
by Charles A. Fleweger. He told how
the article was made, and stated that It
would be profitable to the dairymen of
this State to make. He said that large
quantities are shipped into this State
from Oregon and tne East. J. P. Pear
son started a long discussion by his paper
on "Dairy Education and Dairy Schools."
He stated that in the East dairy educa
tion has been very profitable to the com
munities in which knowledge on these
lines Is Imparted.- In over thirty of tha
States experimental dairy schools have
been established In connection with the
universities. He hopes that the matter
will be brought to the attention of the
regents of the university, with a view of
having sucft an instituion established in
connection with the Berkeley college. He
suggested that the convention pass a res
olution calling upon the regents to con
sider the matter, and have such a
school established If possible.
Colonel E. A. Denlcke, one of the re
gents, said that the board of which he
Is a member is heartily in accord with
the dairy interests, and he believed that
If some of those interested In the State's
Improvement could be made to appreciate
the benefits of such an Institution the
means would be furnished for equipping
a dairy school.
JUDGES AT INGLESIDE.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club Has
Elected New Racing Officials.
At a special meeting of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club the directors made some very
important changes in the staff of racing
officials: Edward F. Smith of Sacramen
to and Harry Kuhl of Chicago have beÂ«n
appointed judges, and will occupy the
stand at Ingleside during the coming sea
son. Last season, in the absence of Cap
tain James H. Rees, Joseph A. Murphy,
who is the presiding judge of the Califor
nia Jockey Club, presided at Ingleside and
J. W. Wilson of Sacramento was assistant
Judge.
Edward F. Smith of Sacramento, who ia
the new presiding Judge, is well known
and very popular. He is the secretary of
the State Agricultural Society. Harry
Kuhl, the now assistant judge, has been
for two years past the official handicap
Â£er and clerk of the scales at Ingleside.
:oth are experienced racing men and un
der their watchful care the racing at
Ingleside during the coming season will
be conducted on strictly fair principles. I
Hosmer Has Returned.
Assistant District Attorney John A.
Hosmer, who a few days ago appeared be
fore the Supreme Court in Los Angreles
on behalf of Detective McVey of Dela
ware, who seeks to remove -Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin to the scene of the murder of
Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane for trial,
has returned to the city. Mr. Hosmer
contended that as the Governor had Is
sued the warrant for Mrs. Botkin's ex
tradition she was illegally held by Chief
Lees, and he asked that the Supreme
Court order her into the custody of De
tective McVey that he might remove her
to Delaware. The Supreme Court refused
to interfere, however, and Mr. Hosmer's
object was defeated.

INDIAN
OUTBREAK

answer the Indians when he knew so
well of their wrongs. As one old In
dian, I have forgotten his name, said
to him, "God Almighty made Indians,
but he did not make reservation In
dians."
The Government sends to the agency
agriculturists, who are supposed to
teach the Indians farming. These men
are mostly, however, chosen, so Bishop
Gilbert says, more for their knowledge
of po-litics than for their ability as farm
ers. They stay a few years on the
reservation and then go back to the
city, but not so poor as they came.
The Indian knows a thing or two-, and
when he sees the agents hired with his
own money, which he would just as
soon have the spending of himself, driv
ing about the farm it makes him very
angry. Civil service was expected to
make all this better, but the spoils at
an Indian agency is too choice a pick-
Ing to be thrown away lightly. When
the report gcres back to Washington
of the affairs at the White Earth res
ervation it is whispered that the In
dians will not bear all the blame of the
war.
HELEN GREY.
COSTS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS
TO M(qRRY '
AN INDIAN WOMAN NOW.
Special to the The Sunday Call.
WICHITA, Kans., Oct. 15.â 1t
costs 5600 now to buy a
marriage license in the
Chickasaw Nation, Indian
Territory. The Chickasaw
Council in session at Tishomingo, I. T.,
has just passes the bill raising the price
of license to whiU men who would wed
ChicKasaw women from $50 to $600.
The purpose of the bill is to prevent
indolent white men marrying into the
tribe or marrying these girls for money
alone.
The Chickasaw tribe of Indians is
comprised of about five thousand full
bloods and ten or twelve thousand half
and quarter-breeds.
Many white men have married into
the tribe within recent years and set
tled upon large tracts of land. Of the
nearly 250,000 acres of land in that na
tion over one-half of it Is owned and
settled upon by whites who have mar
ried Indian women.
Until very recently these "squaw
men" have also controlled the Council
and law-making bodies of the tribe. At
the last election the fullbloods were in
the majority and elected every member
of the Council. They at once decided to
pass a bill stopping so many white men
from marrying into the tribe and ac
cordingly passed the bill raising the
license fee.
The new 5600 fee only applies to Avhite
men or women who would marry a
Chickasaw Indian according to the laws
of that nation and become a citizen of
their nation with all the rights to land
and money,
A Chickasaw Indian if he had his al
lotment and per capita of the tribal
fund Is worth about 53000. It is still a
profitable business to marry an Indian
woman of that tribe, but it will not be
Indulged in so much hereafter because
of the Increase in the license fee.

"Wednesday John Reid, a member of the

carry from the Presidio to a Union-street
car. Jerry disappeared with the valise
and pawned it for $1.
He explained to the court that It was
all a mistake, and felt aggrieved that
such a charge would be brought against
him. The Judge questioned him. and he
admitted that he had been sent up be
fore. As it looked bad for him, he said
that if the Judge would let him off he
would vote for him. but it had no effect,
and he got three months, much to his dis
gust.
