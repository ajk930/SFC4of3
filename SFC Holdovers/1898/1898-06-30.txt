GENERAL. SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS, Juragua, June 28 (by
Call-Herald dispatch boat Mindora,
Port Antonio, Jamaica, June 29).â N0
general movement on Santiago need be
expected this week. It is possible Gen
eral Shafter will attack the beleaguered
city on Monday, but he will not do so
unless heavy artillery to insure the suc
cess of the movement has been placed
in position by that time.
This work of transporting field and
siege guns is going forward all the
time. New difficulties are encountered
every day, but General Shafter is de
termined all shall be made ready for
the attack at the earliest possible mo
ment.
General Shafter continues to give
much attention to thÂ« landing and for
warding of supplies as well as ammu
nition. Since the troops came ashore
the food problem has been a serious
one. It was made doubly so by the ar
rival of General Garcia's men. These
4000 Cubans, who had struggled for
weeks with almost no food at all, made
a noticeable impression on the food
supplies provided for the invading
army.
It was unnecessary for General Gar
cia to lay emphasis on the need of food
for his men. Their condition was such
aB to appeal at once to the American
commander. He gave orders to fur
nish an immediate supply of food to
the Cuban patriots. They were fam
ished and began eating well, but not
wisely. Many of the Cubans had been
without substantial food for so long
that they fairly gorged themselves un
til, as I mentioned in a previous dis
patch, matters began to look serious
for the American troops. They feared
they would not have enough food left
for their own sustenance after the Cu
bans had been fed.
Now comes the touching sequel to
the incident of the feeding of the Cu
bans. So desperate was their condition
that four of Garcia's men, including an
aid on General Castillo's staff, have
died from the effects of over-eating.
General Castillo's aid asked for food
and was given some siue-of-bacon
which he devoured raw, being too hun
gry to wait until the bacon could be
cooked. He was found dead the next
morning, sitting under a tree. Content
ment was written on his countenance
and the remai .s of his feast were
clasped tightly to his heart. Three

other Cubans after being supplied with
food by the steward of one of the
American transports gorged thamselves
and swam ashore. They died before
morning and their bodies were swollen
to enormous proportions.
General Shafter, aside from the ques
tion of supplies. Is much pleased with
the condition in which the invading
army finds itself to-night after six
days of work on land. Our troops at
one point are within three miles of
Santiago and another division of the
army Is close under Morro Castle. From
the camp it is Impossible to observe all
of General Linares' preparations for
defense, but the Americans express
little doubt that the Spaniards will
make a desperately bitter resistance.
Admiral Sampson's men, it is learned
here, succeeded to-day in raising the
Santiago cable. Before this dispatch
reaches you probably a cable station
will have been established at Agua
dores, only two miles tvoax Morro
Castle.
From a Cuban v-ho escaped through
the Spanish lines last night General
Shafter learns General Linares has
massed 12,000 troops in Santiago and
that he is determined to make desper
ate resistance. This Cuban confirmed
the reports that food was scarce in
Santiago and said the Spaniards were
eating horse flesh.
Another conference between General
Shafter and General Garcia will take
place to-day at Siboney, which now Is
the base of operations of Garcia's 4000
Cubans.

Spanish troops for the purpose of as

CAMARA IS
WAITING AT
PORT SAID
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by Jamea Gordon Bennett.
PORT SAID, June 29.â Admiral Camara has asked for coal
and awaits the reply of the authorities. He hopes to proceed on
Thursday. One man has been landed suffering from smallpox.
Admiral Camara has decided to leave the destroyers. The repairs
to the Audaz will consume ten days from to-day. It is practically
impossible to take the destroyers across the Indian Ocean, as the
southwest monsoons are very heavy between Aden and Colombo.
NEW YORK, June 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Embarrassed by lack of funds and in
need of coal. Admiral Camara's squad
ron still is lying at Port Said, unde
cided as to its future destination. Solely
governed as it is by the movements of
the Spanish fleet, the naval war board
has not definitely determined the date
when Commodore Watson's Eastern
squadron shall sail for Spain.
This is the situation to-night with re
spect to the offensive squadrons of
Spain and the United States. So many
contingencies grow out of the next
move by Spain that the authorities are
anxiously awaiting news of its making.
It is appreciated it must be made soon,
for Admiral Camara is paying berthing
and anchorage dues at Port Said for
the fifteen vessels under his command.
These will become due within ten days
from the date of his arrival, and they
have to be paid in money acceptable to
the canal commissioners.
I obtained to-day confirmation of thÂ«
estimate made by the Herald this
morning that before the arrival of
Camara's fleet the American represen
tative at Port Said purchased all the
coal available and will hold it at that
point for any American men-of-war
operating in the vicinity.
Camara, according to advices re
ceived at the State Department to-day,
is trying to arrange for coal, and
French merchants are understood to
have been approached with a view to
the dispatching of colliers to the Span
iards' rescue.
The authorities confidently believe
Camara will return to Spain, but they
do not expect he will leave his present
position for several days at least
Meanwhile the agents of this Gov
ernment are vigorously protesting
against his stay at Port Said on the
ground that it is in violation of the
provisions of the convention of 1888, de
creeing the neutrality of the canal and
its entrances.
The Eastern squadron now forming
for service against Spain will not start
for Spain until after Santiago has fall
en and until colliers which are now on
their way to Hampton Roads have re
ceived their batteries and have taken
on as much coal as they can carry.
WAR MINISTER WANTS
THE SQUADRON RECALLED
Senor Sagasta, However, Overrules
Him With Dynastic Con
siderations.
NEW TORK, June 29.â A World Ma
drid special says: The War Minister
and the military authorities again ad
vocate that the fleet be called back In
case America sends a squadron here,
but Sagasta has invoked international
and dynastic considerations to send it
on.
SENOR CORREA INDULGES
IN SLIGHT PREVARICATION
MADRID, June 29.â 1n an Interview
this afternoon Lieutenant Colonel Cor
rea, Minister of War, said the Govern
ment had no special news from Cuba,
but took a favorable view of the situa
tion. He asserted that Admiral Ca
mara's squadron had begun the pas
sage of the Suez Canal.
It is announced that the Vittoria,
the Numancla, the Alfonso XIII and
the Lepanto, all armored cruisers, are
ready to form the third squadron. The
armored cruiser Cardinal Cisneros and
the torpedo gunboat Dona Maria de
Molina, with several auxiliary cruisers
and torpedo-boats that are to be in
cluded, will be ready shortly.
THREE LINERS SENT
OUT FROM CADIZ
Special rable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
GIBRALTAR, June 29.â The trans-
Atlantic steamers Isla de Luzon and
Ignacicr Loyal have sailed from Cadiz
for an unknown destination. It is of
ficially suggested that they have gone
on an important mission to Porto Rico,
but it is more probable that they .are
humbugging off somewhere. The Gov
ernment must laugh in its sleeve at the
mysterious antics necessary to keep the
popular mind occupied. It is wonderful
how they succeed. At the street cor
ners and in the cafes amateur diplo
mats are teeming with grotesque theor
ies and plans as to where the ships
have gone or where they ought to go.
It is a clever scheme, but infinitely
amusing.
The ironclad Alfonso XIII has caused
many difficulties in the dock. An at
tempt is being made to remove her
mast and give her more stability for
the purpose of adding bulwarks fore
and aft, also two sponsoned barbettes.
When completed she will be no good,
and her repairs have almost amounted
to the price of a new vessel.
The Vittoria is practically completed.
She is armed with six 24-centlmeter
guns. Spaniards are mounting two
batteries on Chorruelos Hill, overlook
ing Algeciras, in case an invading 1
squadron attempts to seek shelter off
Gibraltar.
CAN TAKE
SANTIAGO
VERY SOON
But Shafter Is Lotb to
Lose Many of h|is
Men.
However, Prompt Action Must Be
Ta^en Before Linares Gets
Re-enforcements.
WASHINGTON, June 29.â General Shafter has re
ported to General Miles that he can take Santiago in forty
eight hours, but indicates that the undertaking might in
volve considerable loss. He is fully aware of the approach of
Spanish re-enforcements, and it is believed here that he in
tends to take the town immediately and that news of a battle
might be expected at any time.
WASHINGTON, June 29.â The opin
ion prevails here that within a day or
two at most General Shafter will have
begun his attack upon the city of San
tiago proper. The important event of
the day was the general's announce
ment that he could take the city in
forty-eight hours, but at considerable
loss. Taken In connection with the
announcement contained in another
dispatch that he is going to attack
without awaiting re-enforcements it
will be seen that the officials have
ground for their expectation that the
first general engagement of the war
will begin in a very short time.
Numerically +he opposing armies are
not very different, the estimate of the
Spanish force being placed at 14,000
men, thoroughly entrenched and behind
barbed wire fences and blockhouses, as
against about 18,000 men under Shaf
ter's command, aided by 4000 Cubans.
One of the gravest elements in the
problem, however, Is the Spanish war
ships, for unless Shatter is materially
assisted by Sampson, who might engage
the full attention of the Spanish ships,
their fire on the American advance
would be very hard to meet.
The military authorities here say that
General Linares has shown great mili
tary tact in slowly retiring during the
last few days, as he has gradually
drawn our troops from the protection
of the American ships and brought
them close to the fire of the Spanish
ships in Santiago harbor. For this

reason it was with relief that the an-
nouncement was received here that
Shafter had succeeded in landing all of
his artillery, including his siege train,
for unless Sampson can be relied upon
to force his way into the harbor and at
tack the Spanish ships the siege guns'
planted In heights commanding the bay
will be the main reliance of General
Shafter in offsetting the presence of
the Spanish ironclads.
Undoubtedly Shafter is animated to
attack as soon as possible by his
knowledge of the approach of the re
enforcements for Linares from Man
zanillo, for, with this additional force,
Shafter's position would be disagree
able, if not perilous, at least until he
had received re-enforcements. The War
Department received the first definite
news to-day as to the approach of
these Spanish re-enforcements. Thi3
was in an official dispatch, stating that
8000 men, with pack train and droves of
animals, were advancing from Man
zanillo and were fifty-four miles from
Santiago. It has been known through
reports from Lieutenant Joyce, made to
General Miles, that the Spaniards have
12,000 men at Manzanillo and 10,000 at
Holguin, and every precaution has been
taken to guard against their advance
from either quarter.
The official report to-day showed
that 8000 of those at Manzanillo had
covered half the distance to Santiago,
and it is the belief of military officials
here that General Pando is making
similar advance with his 10,000 men2

from Holguin. These advances, now
practically unopposed, are regarded as
one of the most serious phases of the
situation. There is the further element
of which the military authorities are
giving careful attention, that one man
intrenched behind earthworks or. in
rifle pits is worth three men in the
open. It is said that the battles of
('hanrellnrsville and Spottsylvania af
forded the most direct proof on this
point.
It was announced at the War De
partment that by their reports 3000 sol
diers should be leaving Tampa to-day
to Join Shafter. They will be three or
four days on the voyage, and it is prob
able that it is this force that General !
Shafter refers to as likely to arrive too I
late for his action.

Most important In connection with
the foregoing Associated Press dispatch
is the following special cable to The
Call, published In yesterday's issue of
this paper:
ARMY HEADQUARTERS,
JURAGUA, June 27, by Call-
Herald Dispatch Boat Golden
Rod to Kingston, Jamaica,
June 28.â Information has been
received here from Manzanlllo to
the effect that five battalions of
Spanish troops, which left that
city several . days ago to re
enforce General Linares, re
turned to Manzanillo two days
after their departure.
This is by far the most import
ant news received to-day. It Is
regarded as indicating the fail
ure of the Spanish attempt un
der command of General Pando
to rush 10,000 trained troops to
the defense of Santiago.
The Associated Press cable states, on
the authority of two Cuban officers,
that Pando left Manzanillo June 22.
The Information conveyed by The
Call's correspondent was apparently of
later date than that brought by the
Associated Press, and indicates that
Linares would receive no aid from
Pando.
PLANNING TO TAKE
GUANTANAMO TOWN
Commander McCaSla Desires to
Be Sure of Re-enforcements
Before Making the Move.
HEADQUARTERS OF AMERICAN MARINES, CAMP Mc-
CALLA, Guantanamo Bay, June 28, by The Call- Herald Dispatch-boat
Mindora to Port Antonio, Jamaica, June 29.â Commander McCalla, I
learned to-day, is considering a proposition to take the town of Guan
tanamo without waiting the arrival of troops, and to declare this port
open and invite the commercial world to resume business relations with
the place.
This dashing plan was suggested to Commander McCalla by an
officer of the American fleet now lying about Guantanamo Bay. Such
a stroke, this officer urged upon Commander McCalla, would have a
moral effect abroad that would be of tremendous advantage. He does
not stand alone in the view, and Commander McCalla is being strongly
urged to attempt a coup. Commander McCalla, my informant added,
hesitates to act upon the suggestion -for the reason that the occupation
of Guantanamo would greatly extcivl his lines. Pending develop
ments in the vicinity of Santiago the commander fears he might be as
suming too great a risk. This cour?e would result in a call for. more
troops as soon as carried outl and further assurances that an additional
force would be forthcoming are desired from Washington before the at
tempt is made. Commander McCalla probably will order an advance
upon Guantanamo just as soon as the situation at Santiago clears up.
Our forces about Guantanamo are eager to take the town and they
have had no excitement since the Spaniards ceased in their attacks
upon Camp McCalla. They ate emboldened by news the scouts brine
in from points about Guantanamo. This is to the effect that Guan
tanamo has been deprived of nearly all of her defenders by ueneral Li
nares, who several days aeo ordered the- bulk of the Spanish troops in
this vicinity to hasten to his aid in- Santiago.
SHARKEY WINS
IN ONE ROUND
Ruhlin an Easy Victim
for the Sailor.
FAST BUT BRIEF COMBAT
EIGHT SWING ON THE JAW
DOES THE THICK.
The Victor Praised for His Coolness
and the Absence of Foul
Tactics in Hifc
Fighting.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 29.â "Tom"
Sharkey, the "Pride of the Navy," as
Billy Jordan Is prone to introduce
Sharkey to California audiences, put
"Gus" Ruhlin, the Ohio Giant, out in
almost record time in the arena of the
Greater New York Athletic Club at
Coney Island to-night. Sharkey won
after two minutes and seventeen sec
onds of fighting in the first round, a
right hand swing on the jaw settling
Ruhlin's claims to the winner's share of
the purse and heavyweight champion
ship ambitions. It was a fast fight
and many hard blows were exchanged.
It was clear the battle would be a
short one. Ruhlin landed frequently
and with force, but only once did he
phease the sailor. Sharkey was remark
ably cool and self-possessed. He
fought steadily and with good judg
ment. His tactics were fair and created
a favorable imnression.
The blow which knocked Ruhlin out
was a terrific right hand punch on the
Jaw. Ruhlin staggered like a ship in
a heavy storm and then pitched for
ward, falling heavily on his face. He
tried to arise, but was unable to get on
his f^et, and was counted out. After
the battle Sharkey addressed the sports
thus:
"Gentlemen: I am now prepared to
make a match with Fitzsinimons, Cor
bett or McCoy for a purse and $10,000 a
side."
Sharkey received an ovation as he
left the ring. His victory over Ruhlin
reminded one of John L. Sullivan's
success when the famous Boston boy
met and easily defeated all comers.
Before the bout began to-night. An
nouncer John Dunn stated that Sharkey
wanted it understood that, notwith

doubtful distinction of being a foul
fighter, he never had lost a battle on a
foul and that he would show himself to
be a fair fighter in tha contest about to
begin.
Sharkey said he weighed 17" pounds.
Ruhlin' confessed to tipping the beam
at 190 pounds. Alexander Brown was
selected as referee. Ruhlin and Shar
key eyed each other across the ring
while the preliminaries to the contest
were being shaped. The conditions gov
erning the match called for twenty
five rounds. Sharkey had the call "in
the betting at odds of 10 to 7. . There
was quite an argument between
O'Rourke, representing Sharkey, and
Madden, representing Ruhlin, over cer
tain features of the rules. Sharkey
wanted it understood that hitting in
the breakaway was permisible, whii<^
Ruhlin wanted such a blow considered
foul. He wanted to break clean aft<>r
a clinch. They finally decided not to
hit in the breakaway.
The referee then called the men to
the center, the timers struck the bell
and the contest which meant so much
to the pugilistic future of both men
was on.
Ruhlin opened with a left swing on
the wind. Sharkey sent back a left
swing on the head. Ruhlin jabbed his
left on the wind and Sharkey swung a
left on the wind and jabbed his right
on Ruhlin's head. Ruhlin, after a
couple of clinches, jabbed his left on the
face and Sharkey swung right and left
on the head. Ruhlin jabbed his left on
the face twice and Sharkey swung right
and left to the head, which staegered
Ruhlin.
Then Sharkey, seeing his advantage,
quickly swung his right across flush
on Ruhlin's jaw. dropping the Ohio
giant to the floor, where Ruhlin lay
helpless while the referee counted ten
seconds and then declared Sharkey the
winner. Time of round, two minutes
and seventeen seconds.

IT CEASED
Friends of Annexation
Have Hopes.
NEW POINTS TO BE RAISED
PHASES THAT WILL PROVOKE
FURTHER DEBATE.
Number of Speeches Yet to Come, and
Ample Time for Their Delivery
Will Be Insisted
Upon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
/* Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 29.
There is much talk of an early ad
journment in both houses of Congress,
and some of the members have made
arrangements to leave Washington
upon the assumption that an adjourn
ment will be reached about July 9. A
sudden collapse of the opposition to the
annexation resolution in the Senate is
hoped for next week by friends of the
proposition, and they will use every ef
fort t.> force a conclusion of the dis
cussion.
There has been nothing in the pro
ceedings this week, however, to indi
cate any substantial foundation for this
belief. On the contrary it was declared
to-day by members of the opposition
that they are as determined as ever to
prevent votes, if they can, and that in
any event the debate will proceed un
interruptedly for two and possibly
three weeks, and perhaps longer.
There are to be discussed some phases
of the annexation question that have
not yst been touched upon, ana which
it is believed will have the effect of
provoking additional debate upon both
sides of the chamber. One of these is
of a character of the interests which
are alleged to have been behind the
original annexation movement. One or
two of the Democratic Senators have
made a study of these interests and will
endeavor, it is said, to point out to the
country the selfish motives that have
actuated some of the annexationists.
There are a number of speeches yet to
come and anti-annexationists declare
they will insist upon ample time for
their delivery.
When the joint resolution for annexa
tion was taken up in the Senate to-day
Caffery was recognized to continue his
speech in opposition to the resolution.
He said, in reply to an inquiry by
Teller, that the method by which Texas
had been acquired was contrary to the
constitution. He said the resolution of
annexation was forced through by a
partisan majority, just as it was now
proposed to force through the Hawa
iian resolution, regardless of the fact
that the admission could only be legit
imately accomplished by treaty.
In concluding his speech Caffery
again referred to the Interest of the
sugar trust in the pending resolution.
"It has been said that the sugar trust
is opposing the annexation of the Ha
waiian Islands " said he. "Now, if
there is anything- that is perfectly clear
to me, it !e thnt the sugar trust wants
annexation. The charge that it is in
any way opposing the annexation of
the islands to my mind is not well sus
tained. What the sugar trust wants is
raw cane sugar free of any duty, and
annexation will give them the Hawa
iian product free. Thp sugar is brought
to San Francisco and there refined by
the trust. The refined product is not
mi" 1 - in Hawaii."
Caffery further maintained that the
sugar trust controlled the market for
raw sugar and that annexation would
fasten firmly its hold upon the market
in this country. At 5:05 p. m., Caffery
having concluded, the Senate on mo
tion of Davis, in charge of the resolu
tion, went into executive session and at
6 p. m. adjourned.

while crossing the bridge over Elkhorn
Slough, near the town of Castrovllle,
saw Mills on the opposite end of the
bridge. Mills afterward claimed he
was shooting birds with a shotgun
when he noticed Craig approach. An
altercation ensued over the charge by
Mills that Craig was pasturing horses
on Mills' lot. The lie was passed and
Mills, it is alleged, laid down his gun
and announced himself ready to fight
Craig with fists. A fierce struggle fol
lowed, during which Craig broke away
from his opponent and. Avrenched a
picket from a fence close by. With this
he struck Mills. Another scuffle re
sulted in Craig being disarmed and
crying quits. Mills, having vanquished
his neighbor, turned to go, when Craig
picked up the loaded shotgun from the
grass and discharged it point blank at
Mills, perforating the right side of his
body and head with No. 7 shot. â¢
After having shot Mills Craig -went
home and Mills hurried for medical aid
It was then thought Mills was but
slightly wounded and Craig, who was
arrested for assault to murder, was re
leased on $1000 bonds to appear before
the Superior Court. Mills was taken
to the Watsonville Sanitarium and
made comfortable, but owing to his
habits and mode of life erysipelas set
in and he died early this morning.
Craig has been rearrested and
charged wi'h ; .urder. Craig claims he
acted in self-defense, as he had re
peat 2dly been thrashed by Mills.
Darcy Not Arrested.
SALEM, Or., June 29.â The report last
night of the arrest of W. J. Darcy in con
nection with the alleged forgery of elec
tion returns was erroneous. No complaint
has been lodged against him.

OF
They are those who are afraid of their very bed. They know
there is no good sound sleep. They fear everything. Always con-
scious of their inability to perform any one of nature's duties in the
way big and grand men do, they are full of gloom. Yet they hesitate
to seek help. They hesitate about everything. Spots and lines be-
fore the eyes, , and . weak kneesâthese are all the lot of frail

GENERAL DEFICIENCY BILL
AS PASSED IT CARRIES OVER
TWO HUNDRED MILLIONS.
Senator Morgan Attempts to Apply
the Money Collected Fronl Rail
roads to the Nicaragua"
Canal.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 29.â 1n the
Senate to-day consideration of the gen
eral deficiency bill was concluded and
the measure was passed. An amend
ment of great importance was attached
to the bill, practically by general con
sent. It relates to the settlement of the
claims of the Government asainst the
Pacific railroads. It was offered by
Morgan of Alabama, who made a
strong appeal to the Senate for its
adoption. Before it was agreed to.
White of California proposed some
amendments to it, making it even more
binding upon the roads than it was in
its original form. The amendment in
full follows:
That the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of the Interior and the Attor
ney General and their successors in office
be and are hereby appointed a commis
sion with full power to settle the indebt
edness to the Government growing out of
the issue of bonds in aid of the construc
tion of the Central Pacific and Western
Pacific bond-aided railroads, upon such
terms and in such manner as may be
agreed upon by them or by a majority
of them and the owners of said railroads.
Provided, that any and all settlements
thus made shall be submitted in writing
to the President for his approval or dis
approval, and unless approved by him
shall not be binding.
That said commission shall not agree to
accept a less sum in settlement of the
amount due the United States than the
full amount of the principal and all
amounts necessary to reimburse the
United States for moneys paid for inter
est or otherwise. And also providing that
said commission are hereby empowered
to grant such time or times of payment
by installment and at Buch rates of inter
est, to be not less than 3 per centum per
annum, payable semi-annually, and with
such security as said commission may
deem expedient, provided, however, that
in any settlement that may be made the
final payment and full discharge of said
indebtedness shall not be postponed to
exceed ten years, and the whole amount,
principal and interest, shall be paid in
equal semi-annual installments within
periods so limited, and in any settlement
made it shall be provided that if default
shall be made in any payment of either
principal or interest or any part thereot,
then the whole sum and all installments,
principal and interest shall immediately
become due and payable, notwithstanding
any other stipulation of said settlement.
That there is hereby appropriated out
of money in the treasury not otherwise
appropriated the sum of $20,000 to defray
the expenses of said commission in mak
ing the said settlement.
The bill, as passed, carries about
$227,000,000, the largest sum carried by
any appropriation measure since the
Civil War.
Morgan's amendment as offered pro
vided for a commission to settle the in
debtedness of the Government growing
out of its assistance in the construc
tion of Pacific railways, and providing
further that the funds should be ap
plied to the construction of a ship
canal through Nicaragua.
Unanimous consent was given Mor
gan to make a statement concerning
the amendment. After discussing at
some length the existing situation be
tween the Government and Pacific rail
roads, he said it was evident that the
Nicaragua canal was going to be built,
and be built very soon. When the Sen
ate had carefully considered the matter
he was satisfied not a half dozen votes
would be cast against the canal pro
ject. The people of the United States
had discovered that a waterway
through Nicaragua was absolutely nec
essary to this country as a protection
of our coasts and as a promoter of
commerce.
Morgan referred to the fact that the
Atlas Company, a British organization,
had been granted by Nicaragua im
portant concessions m the San Juan
River and Lake Manama. This com
pany, he said, was composed of promi
nent and wealthy men of England and
the United States. He did not doubt
that the Atlas Company expected to
receive the concession which the United
States was about to lose through delay
in taking action.
Morgan urged that immediate*actlon
should be taken by Congress upon the
canal project which he regarded as
one. of the most important questions
that has confronted Congress for many
years. In conclusion Morgan, in order
to escape the i.oint of order against the
amendment, withdrew that part of it
relating to the Nicaragua canal.
Wilson of Washington, a member of
the special committee on the Nicaragua
canal, objected. He said that the con
struction of the canal was so vitally
important to his State and to the Pa
cific Coast generally that he could not
consent that the amendment should be
divided. He then made a point of order
agajnst the amendment and the point
was sustained by the chair.
The bill was reported to the Senate
and about to be passed when Wilson
withdrew his point of order against the
first part of Morgan's amendment. The
amendment, with some modifications
offered by White of California, was
agreed to.
The bill as amended was then passed
without division.

Order at Manila.
Had r^e-er)forcements Been Ser>t
Sooner Present Complications
Would rjave Been Avoided.
NEW Yn-RK. June 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
It wrs stated at the Navy Department
to-day that Information had been re
rceived from Admiral Dewey in regard
to the aspirations of the Philippine in
surgents for complete indenendence
guaranteed by European towers. It is
appreciated that Aguinaldo is too
shrewd a man to make all his plans
public at this time, and it is thought he
Is simply Bounding the Germans, as
certaining what they are willing to do.
France would vigorously oppose the
acquisition of the islands by Germans
or the establishment of a protectorate
over them, primarily because they
would make an admirable base of oper
ations against Cochin China, over
â¢which their flag floats. She is repre
sented, the authorities note with satis
faction, by a man-of-war.
The increase by Great Britain of her
â warships in Manila Bay to three is in
tended, the authorities believe, to coun
teract the effect of the presence of five
German ships.
It is evident from the number of war
ships present that diverse international
interests are tugging each other with
the American warships holding the
key to the situation by right of mili
tary occupation. Comfort is taken by
the authorities in the fact that up to
this time Aguinaldo has respected the
wishes of Hear Admiral Dewey, and
although Manila is at his mercy, he has
not ord' Ivance against it.
When the American re-enforcements
arrive the city will be taken, and Rear
Admiral Dewey will inform the foreign
warships in the harbor that the Amer
ican troops are in sufficient numbers
reserve order and that it is unneces-
Bary to land marines. By this means
it is hoped that foreign interference
can be averted. It is known that Ra ; : r
Admiral Dewey, like Rear Admiral
Bam] :>3 the arrival of General
Shafter's army, has repeatedly urged
4 The authorities to send troops to his as-
T BiÃtstnce, representing the importance
â â¢ in enabling the United
States: to avoid foreign complications.
3 was desired, an army had Been
Ly to sail for Manila from San
isco the day after definite infor
lon was received that Dewey had
1 the Spanish fleet, the situa
tion in the Philippines would now be
devoid of the possibilities of interna
tional complications, which are a per-
Bistent and present bugaboo to the ad
ministration.
It is not expected in official circles
that there will be any decided attitude
assumed by the natives until the ar
rival of Governor General Merritt and
his announcement of the determination
of this Government to regard the Phil
ippines as a military prize of the
ed States.
If there is to be a rupture it will come
then. In the meantime it will be Rear
Admiral Dewey's work to mine the
harbor and prepare as much as possible
for the coming of Admiral Camara's
squadron. He has been notified by thfs
Government of its presence at Port
Said, the vessels which comprise it, the
number of troops on board, etc., so he
may be guided as to his plan of opera-
It is believed the Charleston and the
three transports conveying 2500 men
have by this time reached Cavite and
within the next three days a dispatch
saying so is expected.
Before Camara can arrive at Manila
the authorities say there is no question
that Rear Admiral Dewey will have
been re-enforced by the monitors Mon
terey and Monadnock in addition to the
Charleston and the 10,000 troops now
afloat.
In accordance with the Instructions
sent from Washington the 10,000 tons
of coal purchased at Honolulu have
been forwarded to Manila for the use
,^'->f the warships and transports, and ar
rangements are being made for an am
ple supply for future use.
REVOLT EXTENDS
TO THE CAROLINES
As the Spaniards Have Only a Small
Garrison There, the Rebels Will
Gain Control.
VANCOUVER. B. C, June 29.â Ma1l ad
vices' from Hongkonp say that it Is re
ported that the revolt against Spanish
fulp has extended to the Caroline Islands.
The Spaniards have only a small garri
son there and as they are unable to send
relief it Is likely that the rebels will soon
have control.
SPANIARDS WILL FIGHT
TO THE DEATH
Preparations Being Mace for a
Most Desperate Defense
of Manila.
M\DRID, June 29.â Dispatches re
ceived from Manila to-day under date
of June 24 say the Spaniards are de
termined to fight to the death and that
there is every reason to believe that
when the American troops arrive des
perate fighting will occur on land and
It is supposed at Manila that the
German warships will prevent the
bombard ny-nt of that place, and it is
alleged that Prince Henry of Prussia is
on his way there on board a warship.
The Spaniards are said to be actively
pushing preparations for the defense of
the city.
General Aguinaldo, the insurgent
leader, declares that the family of Cap
tain General Augustl, who are prison
ers in his hands, are at Panpanga and
well treated.
LATEST CABLEGRAM
FROM ADMIRAL DEWEY
It States That the Progress of the
Insurgents Has Been Won
derful.
WASHINGTON, June 29.â The Navy
Department to-day made public the
following cablegram from Admiral
Dewey, brought by the McCulloch to
Hongkong 1 ar.d, though undated, sup
posed to have been sent from Cavite
June 23:
"No change in the situation since my
telegram of June 17. Five German,
three British, one French and one Jnp
anese men-of-war are in port. The in
surgents are constantly closing in on
the city. Aguinaldo, the insurgent
leader, with thirteen of his staff, ar
rived May 19, by my permission, on
the Nan i^han. He established him
self at Cavite outside of the arsenal
under the protection of our guns and
organized his army. The progress of
Aguinaldo has been wonderful. He
has invariably conducted the war hu
manely. My relations with him me
cordial, but my conferences generally
have been only of a personal nature."
The admiral made no reference to the
landing of German marines, and the
officials here are satisfied that Ger
many is acting in good faith and ac
cording to the rules of neutrality.
MEN OF THE MOHICAN
ARE ON THE ALERT
Searchlight of a Steamer Found the
Men at "General Quarters" and
Ready to Fight.
HONOLULU, June 22.â The officers
and men of the United States ship
Mohican have proved that they are
alert, up in discipline and ready to do
their duty to the flag.
At 2:30 o'clock on the morning of the
19th a telephone message was received
that a Spanish war vessel had been
sighted. Almost immediately the play
of a searchlight, evidently from a ves
sel from Barbers Point, was seen. In
an instant the bugle sounded "general
quarters," and oincers and men re
sponded promptly. Everything was
cleared for action. The engineer force
went to their stations and the gunners
to their posts. There was the rattle of
chains and the usual noise attending
preparation. The men on shore liberty
heard that something was up and hur
ried aboard their vessel.
Meanwhile the steamer W. G. Hall,
for such was the vessel, continued to
play the light as she steamed toward
the harbor. The Mohican was unable
to make out what vessel it was until
the Hall reached the mouth of the har
bor channel, but she was ready to send
a shot across the stranger's bow and
follow it up with a broadside if she
should prove an enemy. The Hall was
fitted with a searchlight some months
ago for use in entering harbors on
dark nights. The captain said he
thought he would try it on the Mohican
to see If tho officers and men were on
the alert. He found they were.
GUNBOAT PURSUED
BY A WARSHIP
A Spaniard Reports How He Kept
Within the "Blue Sea" and
Escaped.
HAVANA, June 28 (delayed in trans
mission). â The commander of the Span
ish gunboat Ardilla reports that â while
reconnoitering on June 2G at Coloma,
Punta Cortes, and other places, he was
informed that a strange steamer with
one smokestack, apparently a warship
of 3000 tons, was in sight. The stranger
soon came in sight of the Ardilla and
pursued her. The gunboat kept within
the "blue sea" and succeeded in keep
ing out of range of the guns of the
pursuer. To the southeast of the stran
ger, which turned out to be an Ameri
can warship, were several other ves
sels. The Ardilla made a reconnois
sance the following day, June 27, and
discovered that the American ship had
captured the sloops Nemesla of Pataba
no, Amistad and Manuelita of Coloma
and the pilot-boats Luz and Jacinto.
The American auxiliary cruiser re
ferred to in the dispatch from Havana
was undoubtedly the Yankee, manned
by the naval reserve, which arrived at
Key "West from Cienfuegos on Monday
last. She then reported that off the
Isle of Pines, on the west coast of Cuba,
she captured, burned and destroyed five
Spanish Bmall craft loaded with fish
and that she also captured two pris
oners who were released.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June 29.â Lord Salisbury,
the Premier, addressing the United
Club in this city, this evening, said:
"There is a black cloud on the hori
zon, one that does not affect us per
sonally, but -which evokes the deepest
sorrow and our largest desire for its
removal. It is the war of two great
nations, between whom we are neutral
â one bound to us by every tie of kind
red and similarity of institutions and
religion; the other, the state that
fought on our side when we struggled
with the threatening tyranny of the
first Napoleon. Watching this terri
ble war, we are bound to abstain from
expressing any preference or any judg
ment on either side. We know that
in both cases the motives were of the
highest character. We know that the
United States are animated by ele
vated philanthropy, and that Spain is
inspired by that love of independence
which was the greatest pride of all an
cient nations. I can only say I earn
estly wish the day may speedily ar
rive when this terrible slaughter be
tween two nations will cease and the
world be restored to peace.
"With this exception, the world looks
smiling enough to us, politically. The
convention with France has removed
the subject of conflict between us and
our greatest and most cultivated neigh
bor. The Soudan expedition, if suc
cessfully accomplished, will be the
greatest work for civilization that Eng
land has perforn.ed for two or three
generations.
"The Government's Chinese policy is
to prevent the Chinese empire from
falling into ruins, to invite it into
paths of reform, to give it every as
sistance in our power; to perfect its
defenses, and to increase its commer
cial prosperity. Thus we should aid
China and ourselves. It is impossi
ble that we should have the same in
fluence over China as over India and
Egypt, but I believe that so far as
railways are concerned, our advantage
will be fully equal to those of other
nations."
REDDING'S FAREWELL
TO HER SOLDIER BOYS
Three Days of Merry Making Before
the Sad Hour of Their
Departure.
REDDING, June 29.â Company H of

gent troops in Cuba and to starving non
combatants. Since the beginning of
the existing war one of the hardest
problems the President has had to
solve has been the question of sending
material aid to Cuban people suffering
on account of the war.
Information has been received in
Washington that since the beginning of
hostilities between the United States
and Spain and the establishment of the
blockade the suffering among Cubans
has greatly increased. Arrangements
are being made to send large quanti
ties of fresh beef and other provisions
to Cuba. After the fall of Santiago it
is thought General Garcia and the
American troops will be able to distrib
ute the food sent by this Government
throughout the entire province of San
tiago. Every week ships will leave
Tampa for Santiago laden with pro
visions.
The Government does not intend that
the Cubans in Santiago shall be the
only ones relieved. Vessels with pro
visions of all kinds will land their car
goes at places on the Cuban coast con
trolled by the insurgents. Provisions
will be carried into the interior by the
Cuban troops and distributed among
suffering non-combatants. This work
will begin in about ten days.

EXPECTANT
HAWAIIANS
Awaiting the Arrival of
Annexation News.
ACTION OF HOUSE KNOWN
IT HAS CAUSED A BIG JUKP
IN SUGAR STOCKS.
People of Honolulu Preparing to
Welcorr.c the Second Expedition
on the Way to the Philip
pines.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, June 22.â Flying the
prearranged signals in reference to an
nexation the steamship Moana with
bunting galore was sighted shortly
after daylight this morning. When she
docked at 7 o'clock there was quite a
large crowd gathered to greet her, hut
there was no demonstration and not
even a lonesome cheer, except in the
Imagination of those not present. A
sudden change in the weather brought
on a heavy rainstorm, and the people
became glum instead of Joyful, self
contained and repressing all emotion.
"Nothing decided, we must wait for
the Belgic on Saturday," was the gen
eral refrain. The anxiety and sus
pense is sorely trying, for our wishes
are the blind leaders of our opinions.
President Dole announces his hope and
belief that the Senate followed the lead
of the House and passed the Newlands
resolution by a proportionately large
majority. American Minister Sewall
anticipates delay and debate. Private
advices diametrically differ, and all the
community can do is to patiently wait.
The general impression is, however,
that we are already annexed, and it is
curious to note how many there are
who clamored for annexation three
years ago who now fervently pray that
the Senate may defeat the resolution.
There are many others who view the
situation with content as a means of
forcing out of future office the incum
bent?. , ..
One of the leaders of annexation said
this morning: "We must now organ
ize to drive these people from power
and to crush them once and forever.
Without annexation we never could
throttle them; with annexation we can
destroy them."
It is understood that the Legislature
will now set to work in earnest to clean
up its business and adjourn, to be
again summoned in special session to
vote upon the Joint resolution when it I
is received from the United States. j
There will be no great difficulty in ob
taining Its passage, although it is whis
pered that there will be pom" opposition
if certain arrangements can be made
politically.
The Hawaiian?. especially the
women, are very despondent at the
news, but there is not the slightest fear
of any disturbance. Annexation will be
accepted as a matter of course, with
1hÂ» reservation that vengeance will be
exacted politically whenever the oppor
tunity offer?, for there is the bitterness
of death in the souls of the people.
News has been received here that
Queen LHiuekalani proposes to return
to Hawaii via San Francisco next
month. . ._ Â
The tranpports of the second Manila
expedition have not yet been sighted,
'put we are expecting them hourly. The
executive committee of reception met
this afternoon and completed all details
for entertaining the soldiers. If agree
able to their commander they will be
divided into two divisions approximat
ing 3000 each and "fed" at noon on Fri
day and Saturday.
While Hawaiians are awaiting an
nexation news they are indulging in
unprecedented sugar stock gambling
and heavy betting on results by the
next steamer. Without entering into
professional details of "how much paid
up," etc., let it be understood that the
excitement is intense and that stock of
$100 par value is at $350, with an intima
tion that it will reach $500, If the news
in favorable. Honokaa. Pioneer, Maka
weli. in fact all the gilt edged planta
tions paying their 60 to 80 per cent divi
dends, more or less, are keeping pace
and those who were on the inside are
coining money. The stocks are worth
the money paid for them and more, for
production of sugar, under present con
ditions, la proof of their value. But
why this sudden spurt in prices?
The reasons are in the main political,
and In a word the annexationists, hav
ing duped the United States, are now
reaping their reward before their du
plicity Is discovered, knowing that the
deed that they may have caused to be
done, if done, cannot be undone.
President Dole has materially assist
ed in the deal by allowing it to be pub
licly known that he has every faith In
the accomplishment of annexation
within the next three weeks, that is to
say, within the term of the present ex
tra session of the Legislature, although
he admits that there may possibly be
delay and disappointment. The Legis
lature has aided and abetted by its
action on two most important bills in
connection with which faith has been
broken with the United States, the
labor contract repeal and the Chinese
restriction bills. HORACE WRIGHT.
THREE THOUSAND MEN
START FOR SANTIAGO
WASHINGTON. June 29.â The un
derstanding at the War Department to
day ni that cix transports, carrying
rÂ»-enforcements for General Shafter'a
army, would leave Tampa to-day, go
ing: cut with the tide. They carry
about 3000 men with their equipments
ami subsistence. This is only a small
portion of the re-enforcements to he
pent to General Shatter, as at present
deterriined, and include a portion of
Readier General Snyder'a division.
iÂ«rom the fact that they are In com
mand of Brigadier General Randolph
the presumption is that the artillery
batteries under his charge, or at least
a portion of them, also have been taken
with this expedition. There were six
batteries in all under command of Gen
eral Randolph, three of which were of
heavy and the remainder of lisht artil
lery. At Key West the transports are
to be met by a convoy of naval vessels
and escorted to Santiago. Other trans
ports are expected to return from Cuba
in a few days, and they will take the
remainder of the troops assigned to re
enforce General Shafter.
CHICK AMAUGA, June 29.â The order
issued yesterday conveying the infor
mation that the entire First Army
Corps would be sent to Cuba has
doubled the activity at Camp Thomas.
The work of completely equipping and
arming the twenty-seven regiments is
an immense task for the short time in
which it must be accomplished, but it
Is already in progress and officials say
things will be in shape sooner than is
generally though* possible. Everybody
in the twenty-seven regiments, from
colonels to privates, is hustling to-day,
and considerable rivalry to be the first
to get in shape Is In evidence. It is be
lieved that all under orders will be
woving inside of two weeks.

BOSTON, June 2S*.â The annual com
mencement orati"- at Arahurst College
was delivered to-day by Hon. John YV.
Foster, the celebrated American diplo
mat and Secretary of State in Harri
son's Cabinet. The subject was, "The-
International Relations of China." He
said:
"The great need of China to-day Is
a courageous and intelligent leader. It
is not unrensor.able to hope for such a
loadtr in the present emergency. The
existing crisis in affairs was provoked
and precipitated by Japan and followed
in rapid succession by a series of events
indicative of the ambitious designs of
European powers and the incapacity
and helplessness of China; first, a
JOHN W. FOSTER, Ex-Secretary of State.
guarantee of Chinese loans, and then
wresting from China of naval and com
mercial ports and territory by Russia,
Germany, France and Great Britain.
Th<.se events would seem to presage
â tho dismemberment of China. A nation
whose Interest and power might pre-
Aent It is Great Britain. How far fche
Will be disposed to assert herself to
that end Is a question of the future. It
.'or-nis almost hopeless to expect Chin.x
to achieve her redemption unaided.
What n.ay be done through the west
ern assistance is foreshadowed in the
customs service administered by Eng
land and other foreign employes to
honpfct and successful service.
"If the same system could be applied
to the collection and disbursement of
other material revenues and to military
establishment a new era might dawn
upon the middle kingdom. The British
Government asserts, and I think sin
cerely, that it desired the maintenance
and development of the Chinese empire
as an independent nation, and that its
only interest Is to have untrammeled
commercial intercourse with itfi peo
ple. This attitude emphasizes the new
spirit of commercialism which has
taken possession of the world in the
last half of tho present century. The
last half of the century has brought
about great changes in that part of the
world, changes which have been influ
enced by and affect no notion In larger
degree- than the United States. Under
these circumstances it Is impossible for
I us to look upon the situation In China
| with indifference as our Interest In
; pres?rvlns free commercial Intercourse
! with that country coincides with that
iof Great Britain. It 1b fortunate the
present v.-ar has brought us most close
ly together and led us to forget the
causes which have partly estranged us
in the past.
"Political alliance is not necessary to
bring about the co-operation of the
British and American Governments in
Chinese affairs. But it is a happy
augury for the future of that ancient
empire in Its crisis of distress that
there Is a concurrence of Interests and
views respecting it in two brance3 of
the Anglo-Saxon race. In the past
century It has far outstripped every
other race in all elements and qualities
.which make man noble, useful and
powerful. It stands to-day as a cham
pion of liberty, enlightenment and hu
manity. United it can stand against
the world. For fifty years Its mission
aries have been at work In China as In
Hawaii and the Caroline Islands, to
teach the people a better way of life.
If joined to these Influences England
and America can, by common policy,
give security to the Government, bring
about a better, purer system of admin
istration and break down the spirit of
conservatism, there may come to
China an era of power and prosperity
unequaled in the seas."

MAJOR LONG COMMENDED
Prominent Commercial Bodies Up
hold the Quartermaster's
Course.
Within the past few clays comments
have been made upon the course of Ma
jor Oscar F. Long of the Quartermaster's
Department It was asserted that he
winked at the uniform contractors when
he know that they were having garments
for the soldiers rr.nde by Chinese and
When he also knew that many white
women desired this same employment.
These charges were then published, ana
now comes Major Long's side of tho story
for publicity, not told by himself, but by
some of the best citizens of the commu
nity. The first to Â£0 to his defense was
Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber of
Commerce, and A. A. "Watklns. president
of the San Francisco Board of Trade.
Yesterday this subject was taken up at
the meeting of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, In which the
greatest respect and confidence was ex
pressed for Major Long. Manager Oscar
Lewis had been directed by President
Sbarboro to make an investigation of the
charges against the quartermaster, and
this was the report to the directors:
One of the moFt Important matters that has
been attended to recently Is that In relation
to Government supplies. By direction of the
president a. meeting was called at the rooms of
the association, and representatives from com
mercial bodies ami parties Interested were in
vited to be present. The meeting was well at
tended and important terrains signed by the
various parties were forwarded to Washington
ami substantial benefits to the merchants and
manufacturers interested In the furnishing of
Government supplies have already accrued.
In this connection I wish to state that I had
a very Interesting Interview With Major Oscar
F. Long, who is In charge of the quarter
master's department in San Francisco. 'When
Major Long took charge of the department here
all supplies were being procured from the East.
Upon investigation he found that when the
freight was udded the Government was paying
more for many articles than for which goods
of the Fame quality could be obtained here.
After a considerable amount of work and cor
respondence he obtained permission from Wash
ington from time to time to call for articles
made or for sale here, until at the present time
nearly every article used in his department Is
purchased in the San Francisco market.
This liaÂ» been accomplished through the
Strenuous efforts of Major Long and the earnest
and active co-operation of the merchants,
manufacturers and producers of this Coast.
Already $1,500,000 has been expended or con
tracted for, and It is expected that It will reach
tor th^ year to from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000.
Major Long has received the highest com
mendations from his superiors for the prompt
manner in which the Immense amount of sup
plies required for the fitting out of the Manila
expedition has been filled, being much more
expeditious than at any other point in the
United States during the present crisis.
The clause forbidding the employment of
Chinese labor on contracts for supplies was in
serted by Major Long without authority from
Washington, and in deference to the sentiment
of the people of the Coast against such labor.
This met with tho approval of every
one present and resulted in the following
dispatch being sent to Senator Perkins,
signed by the association, and subse
quently by five of the largest commercial
bodies in "the city:
Benator George C. Perkins. United Stntes
Ponate, Washington. D. t\â Dear Sir: Having
noticed the accounts of certain newspapers re
cently upon purchasing of suppplies by the dp-
I'artmont here, aftfr a thorough lnveÂ«tlKatl"n
we. are satisfied that the action of Major Oscar
F. Long in relation to the purchasing of Gov
ernment supplies has been in every way com
mendable, and that he bus used every means
at his command to protect the best Interests
ot labor ts against Chinese competition, and
that the mod work already accomplished on he
half of the manufacturers of the coast will be
bubsitantially increased ir not retarded by un
just criticisms and ground!'?ss complaints. All
contract)! contain the following clause against
the employment of Chinese labor:
"Chinese labor not to be employed in any man
ner whatever. If satisfactory evlJer.ce is pro
duced that such labor has been Â«o employed. It
will be considered sufficient to reject any and
every artlolp under this award, and it is so
understood by the party receiving and the
party making this award."
We believe that the manufacture of supplies,
for the first time in the history of the army
depot having been brought to this city, will
now remuln with us, bringing millions of d,.1
lars In emulation to our people. It is through
the concerted force of the depot quartermaster
that this has been accomplished, notwithstand
ing the unjust crltlclmH of local Journals.. We
heartily endorse and approve Major Long's ac
tions.
Will you kindly refer this to the California
delegation and the proper authorities?
Thanking you and your colleagues for your
valuable services to the State, we remain.
Yours very truly,

of A. B, Spreckels, president of the Board
of Park Commissioners, yesterday. They
were driven through the beautiful pleas
ure grounds of the people and shown the
wonderful improvements made by the

in still further beautifying- the park.
When Mr. Spreckels pointed out the
large tracts of land that needed cultiva

the trees, the drives that yet deserved at
tention and the hundred and ono import

City Thoroughfares.
Before mar.y months pass Market street

avenue from Mar
ket street to Green

>y electric lamps oil
)rnamental poles of
his design. The Su
pervisors left the
matter of selecting
the design of the
poles and lamps to
the Merchants' As
sociation which yes
terday decided upon
this one, out of 34
submitted. It is the
creation of Mr. Her
nan G. Scheffauer,
Rrho was awarded
the prize of $20 of
fered for the most
artistic production.
The poles are to be
of iron and made so
sis to take either the
overhead or the un
derground current.
The h"ieht is four
teen ieet from the
sidewalk to the
light. The cost ot
the poles to the city
will not be over $2a.
It is proposed to
place in the larger
blocks on Market
street three lights
and on the avenue
one to each block.
As soon as these
new poles are put in
place the associa
tion will have the
old flickering gas at
fairs removed. Tho
poles are to be
planted on the edge
of the sidewalk, so
as to throw the elec
tric rays over as
great a surface as
possible. The globe
of the lamp is to be
of pure white ground
glass to mellow the
electric light and it
has been suggested
that the globes near
fire alarm boxes be
of a delicate pink,
not so pronouncea
as to be out of place,
but sufficient to at
tract the attention
of any who might
have occasion to
turn an alarm of
fire and not know
whore to find the
nearest box. As soon
as the Supervisor*
are in a position
they will provide for
similar lights fur the
oth r large business
, streets of the city.
A -â â  .ill of the other
designs were of ex
ceptional merit the association was per
plexed as to which to choose, but after
careful consideration it was thought Air.
Scheffauer's had a little advantage in
point of beauty and simplicity.

Th<? following statement from John
T. Doyle throws a big flash of light on
Mr. HuntinÃton's new refunding bill:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 29.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
I beg through your columns to draw pub
lic attention to Mr. Huntingdon's new re
funding bill, lately Introduced In the
United States Senate, as explained In a
letter to his Honor Mayor Phelan.
The bill appoints the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of the Interior
and the Attorney General to settle th.Â»
Indebtedness to the Government growing
out of the issue of bonds to aid the Cen
tral and Western Pacific roads on such
terms as may be agreed on by them and
the owners of the roads. The Commis
sion is not to accept less tnan the prin
cipal and. the unpaid interest, due at the
time of settlement. But it is authorized
to grant time for payments by install
ments, with interest at not less than 3
per cent per annum, with such security
as the Commission may deem expedient.
The last clause Is intended to and will
authorize a mortgage of the hundred-year
lease of the Central road to the Govern
ment, and thus put it beyond the power
of a court to declare It void. It means
ninety years' further railroad oppression
to California, and confiscation of the
property of the Central Pacific stockhold
ers, whose shares will from the passage
of that act be worth the value of Mr.
Huntington's personal promise or two
years' dividend at 2 per cent per annum,
and not a farthing "?". Yo ur a reÂ«>ect

GEORGE ROSE
AGAIN MARRIED
MISS O'NEAL THE WIFE OF THE
BOOKMAKER.
A Wedding a Few Days Ago in
Detroit Which Recalls a
Divorce Sensation.
News was received here yesterday by
mail of the marriage of George Rose,
the well-known bookmaker, to Miss
Frankle O'Neal of Santa Cruz. Last
Wednesday Mrs. Emma Blake of this
city received a telegram from Mrs. Rose
acquainting her of the marriage, which -
took place in Detroit. The Detroit papers
of the following day published meager T
accounts of the wedding. That Georga \
Rose is married again there can be no
doubt, although some of the relatives of
the present Mrs. Rose were strong; in
their assertions that no wedding took
'' Mr.' Rose was the defendant in a sen
sational divorce suit in April. His wife
brought suit and a divorce was obtained.
In the complaint no specific person was
mentioned as a (('-respondent, but the
usual legal panacea. Miss Roe, bore the
brunt of Mrs. Rose's allegations. It is
believed that Mrs. Rose No. 1 obtained a
large settlement and that Mr. Rose did
not oppose the divorce very strenuously.
The present Mrs. Rose is well known in
The information received here yester
day mentions the marriage as having
taken place in the Russell House, De

FOR THE PHILIPPINES
MAJOR GENERAL MERRITT,
U. P. A., with the numerous
officers of his staff, embarked
for Manila upon the steamer
Newport at 5 minutes after 9
o'clock yesterday morning. An hour
later the "blue peter" was aflutter, the
lines rast off and the good ship had her
nose in the wind and was off overseas
In the yet rippling wake of the boats
of the third expedition.
From early morning the Mail dock
had been crowded to the gate with all
and conditions of people who had
gathered for a dozen different reasons.
Mothers and sisters and wives were
there, a host of the warm friends of
the general and his officers to bid them
godspeed, a crowd of curious spectators
who came to see and to shout, and shout
they did with right good will. Their
cheering found an echo in the rigging,
on the after deck and from every port
hole and from wherever else a boister
ous red and blue artilleryman had
been able to find a foothold.
A singing blast from the horn of the
Newport was the signal for every
bass-voiced siren and shrieking: fal
setto pipe along the front. Pande
monium broke loose. The myriad boats
of the mosquito fleet gave good hale
and courtesied their colors; from the
thronged docks and berthed ships came
a flash of flags and kerchiefs; a din
of cannon from the Marion and Alca
traz and a shout went up as long and
unremitting as the shrieking from the
Flrens. It was as royal a farewell as
has yet been given.
A crowd had gathered at the Palace
Hotel rotunda to see General Merritt
as he took his carriage for the docks.
They waited patiently, but in vain, for
the general, after a little nnst prandial
at the bar, quietly slippe^^^ through
to Market street and junostentatiously
took a Third street car to the b^at, his
luggage having preceded him.
Arrived at the boat side he was met
by Majors General Otis and Merriam,
Brigadier General Miller and a dozen
other of the officers of the department
who had come to bid him bon voyage
and to give assurance of their keen
hope of following not far behind.
General Merriam with his party ac
companied the Newport out of the bay
on the Government steamer McDowell,
as did a dozen of the small craft that
blocked the big ship's path.
A few minutes after the transport
had departed from the dock three be
lated privates from the Presidio
bounded on the dock shouting lustily
after their boat. They were taken on
a launch and put aboard the Newport
in the stream. No less than a dozen of
the men were left behind.
THE FOURTH
EXPEDITION.
Brigadier-General M. P. Miller
Commanderâ Vessels
to Go.
The exact date of the departure of the
next expedition to Manila is still the un
solved problem that is proving of great
interest to the officers and men at Camp
Merritt.
Next to this, the most interesting ques
tion is what troops will compose the fourth
expedition to the Philippines. While no
official orders have yet been issued, It is
positively known that the War Depart
ment proposes to move all of the troops
now at Camp Merritt on the next two ex
peditions. No effort will be spared to se
cure the necessary transports to do this.
It is certain that the next fleet of vessels
to leave will carry half of the force now
remaining here, and what Is left will go
upon the fifth expedition.
Major General Otis will accompany the
next expedition, and Brigadier General
Marcus P. Miller will have command.
This much has been positively determined
upon, and has been an open secret for
several days. No orders have as yet
been issued in regard to the mailer, and
none of the officers will discuss the ques
tion, but that this is the plan that Major
General Otis intends to put into execu
tion was confirmed yesterday by a prom
inent officer, who is in a position to know
â what he is talking about. The fact that
General Miller has been selected to com
mand the next expedition would indicate
that it will be composed largely of regu
lar troops.
The Peru will be ready before July 30,
and In spite of the extensive alterations
th; * are beincr made to her the City of
will i;o - be behindhand.
The i'ennsylvania is due here at ajiy
hour rio^'. but sht has a big cargo of ma
. hinery a -oard. and that will take some
time to discharge. After that she will
COMPANIES G AND F, EIGHTH CALIFORNIA, ARRIVING AT CAMP BARRETT.
have to be refitted throughout as a troop
ship.
The identity of the fourth vessel of the
fleet is in doubt. It will either be the
Umatilla. "Walla Walla or State of Cali
fornia. The first two named vessels are
handicapped by having no means of get
ting coal out of the hold into the bunkers.
If they are taken this defect will have
to be remedied. The Walla Walla carries
a water tank for ballast, and in it 500 tons
of coal could be stored, and with it the
trip might be made, so if either vessel is
taken it will be her. The State of Cali
fornia has been examined, but as she is
small and would require considerable al
terations, ihe chances are against her be
ing taken.
The Acapulco. due to-day from Panama,
will probably be added to the fleet, so
the Peru, City of Puebla, Pennsylvania,
Walla Walla "and Acapulco may be the
next vessels to get away.
MARCHED FROM
HOME TO CAMP
Oakland Welcomes the As
sembling Companies of the
Eighth Regiment.
The stern reality of war â¢was mani
fested in Alameda county yesterday.
From her two largest cities there
marched out over two hundred bravo
boys, who were last night under canvas
at Camp Barrett.
The sun had not kissed the crest of the
Eastern hills when the members of Com
pany F gathered at the armory, but early
as they were, others were before them.
The willing hands of many ladies had
transformed the usually bare armorr
into a beautifully di-corated banquet hall,
for Oakland ladies never do anything by
halves.
The scene was a new one for all who
figured in it, with the exception of a few
veterans who thought of a generation
ago as they watched the boys enjoy their
breakfast. The armory has been the
scene of mariy gay festivities and com
pany drills and dress parades, but yes
terday the usual jaunty air was missing.
The boys were Berious, and although it
was a labor of love to wait upon them
the task was not pleasant.
Before the boys went out they were
i given a farewell cheer and Judge E. M.
Gibson said a few words. He recalled h:Â»
youth, his enlistment in the Union army,
his years of active service and expi
his confidence that the sons of the gener
ation that bore arms for humanity's
cause would prove as brave and unselfish
as their sires.
Dr. George C. Pardee also made a fare
well speech. He hinted that the rigors of
war rarely permitted of the return of
complete regiments and concluded with
a fervent "God bless you."
Both the doctor and the Judge spoke
with much feeling and Beyeral handker
chiefs were in evidence when the order
was given "Forward march."
Oakland's first contingent marched to
camp through decorated streets. Thou
sands of flags fluttered overhead, antici
| paling the great holiday of next Monday.
As Company P passed down Broadway to
Seventh street and up Washington to
Fourteenth on their way to camp they
were cheered on every street corner.
Four companies more of the Eighth
California Volunteers reached Camp Bar
rett yesterday. Companies A and L,
from Chico and Marysvllle, respectively,
reached the camping ground at 9:30 a. m.
and were given a royal reception by
the boys already in the tents. There
were few civilians to greet them, nearly
everybody being at Oakland or Alameda
to participate in the farewell demonstra
tion to their own boys, who were about
to abandon peaceful pursuits for the stir
ring life of warriors. There were a few,
however, who were out to meet the new
comers. The ladies of the Red Cross
Society of Oakland and neighboring
towns did not forget the tired soldiers
who had been up all night. An appetiz
ing breakfast had been prepared for
them, for which the troops were most
grateful.
Before the men had fairly got their
! tents up the roll of drums and flare of
! brass to the south and west announced
the simultaneous arrival of Company
F of Oakland, -escorted by Companies A
and G of Alamada, Both commands
; were preceded by bands and followed by
i all the citizens of their respective local
ities who could muster a bicycle or buggy
or were able to keep up with the pro
! cession on foot. It was an inspiring
i scene and the men were gayly bedecked
! with flowers. Sisters and sweethearts
clung to the. arms of many of the soldiers
â¢ and would not discontinue their <
diity when the guard line was reached,
but, brushing past the sentries, continued
into camp.
It was surprising, considering the num
â¢ her of recruits in all the companies, the
celerity with which the tents were pitched
, and the men settled down to the routine
of camp life. The greatest difficulty they
have to contend with is the management
! of the Bussacott ovens, two of which arÂ«
I issued to each company. It is consider
i able of a knack to prepare a meal on
i these camp stoves without burning the
food or destroying the stoves, and were
j it not for the fact that all the companies
j come into camp fairly loaded down with
j edibles they would find their fare ex
| ce'edlngly meager. The amateur chefs
declare they will soon have the "hang" of
; the Bussacott, and some of them already
; boast that they can boil water without
burnine it.
â¢ The four "companies that arrived yes
THE SA^ IRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 30, 1898.
terday brought more than the maximum '
number, with the exception of the Ala- '
meda company, which only had 100 men
in line. Marysville sent 126 officers and
men, Oakland 100 and Chico 117.
At mustering headquarters the exam
ination of the men proceeded rather
slowly. Company D of San Rafael was
linished with during the forenoon and of
the ninety-nine enlisted men examined
only two were rejectedâ an excellent
showing, which reflects credit on the

AWAY ON A STERN CHASE
Vain Attempt Made by the Tug Reliance, With Mail for the Fleet, to
Catch the Transport Newport.
Shortly after the Newport got under way a couple or soldiers from Camp Merrltt came down with a
sack of mail from the Minnesota regiment. Their names are Privates Stephens and Connors and their in
structions from Major Higgins were to get the letters on board the transport by hook or by crook. They se
cured the services of the dispatch boat Grant's launch, but it failed to catch the Newport, so it returned to
Folsom-street wharf. Then the soldiers chartered the tug Reliance, and taking along with â¢ them Emile
Rasmussen of Battery H, Third Artillery, who had missed the boat, they started away after the transport.
As the Newport was passing out the signal man at Point Lobos tried to flag her, but failed to attract
the attention of any one on board. After passing the lightship Captain Brokaw of the Reliance saw the
transport slow down to drop the pilot and had great hopes of catching her. He kept the tug's whistle going,
but the Newport got under way again without taking any notice of the ensign union down which Captain
Brokaw in despair had hoisted at the peak.
When Captain Freeman, who had taken the Newport out, got aboard the pilot boat Gracie S and saw
the Reliance coming he at once set the signal "K. V." (important news), but the people on the Newport
took no notice. Then he set his ensign union down, but the transport kept on her way. Then Captain Bro
kaw gave up in despair and returned to the city with the soldiers.
Rasmussen was the only happy man on the tug. He had his best girl along with him and his whole
time out and back again was taken up in making love to her. The Reliance made a very quick run out,
covering the distance from Folsom-street wharf to the lightship in one hour and twenty minutes. As the
tug passed Meiggs wharf half a dozen other artillerymen who had missed their boat were keeping a look
out for her return to learn how their comrade had fared.

The companies that have passed the ex
amination have not been mustered in yet,
nor will they be until Governor Budd ap
points the commissioned officers. The
Governor la taking his time about this,
and in consequence most of the officers
in camp are somewhat nervous.
Captain Elliott of San Rafael was in
command yesterday. Colonel ESenshaw,
Lieutenant Colonel Carrington and Major
"Whitton visited the camp during thi
ernoon, but returned to the city for din
ner. They will all come over early this
morning, however, and Colonel Henahaw
will take formal command.
Captain W. S. Barnes paid a visit to the
camp yesterday morning and expressed
himself as greatly pleased with the loca
tion and the men. His company will ar
rive this morning.
While Major Whitton was here ho re
ceived a dispatch from Governor Bftdd
requesting him to report at headquarters
at once. Major Whitton took the first
train for the city, hardly waiting for the
congratulations of his brother officers,
who took it for granted that he was sum
moned to receive his formal appointment.
Captain George B. Baldwin also visited
Camp Barrett yesterday afternoon re
turning to San Francisco with Colonel
Henshaw and party. Lieutenant Me<"
gett. the newly appointed officer of com
pany D, clad in a spick and span new
uniform, was another visitor. He has al
ready gone into quarters.
COLONEL WILLARD
YOUNG ARRIVED
He Will Form the Second
Regiment of Engi
neers.
Willard Toung, appointed colonel of one
of the three regiments of engineers, the
formation of which was authorized by
Congress, arrived in this city last night.
He has been engaged in marshaling the
Second Regiment from volunteers in the
, Central "Western and Pacific Coast States.
The regiment will be composed of twelve
companies. San Francisco will contribute
one as its quota. Out of the ninety-one
men for the local company, sixty have
been enrolled.
Colonel Young will give a competitive
examination to-day for commissions in
the local company at the office of Colonel
Charles R. Suter, division engineer of the

NEAR HONOLULU.
The Alameda Sighted the China,
Zealandia, Colon and Sena-
tor on June 23.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda arrived from Honolulu last night
with some additional news of the trans
ports. She sailed from Honolulu on June
22 at 10 p. m., and at 2:10 a. m. on the
23d, when forty-five miles from port, she
spoke the steamer China under a full
head of steam. Then at 8:45 a. m., when
137 miles from Honolulu, she spoke the
Zealandia, Senator and Colon in a bunch.
At 11:20 p. m. on the same day the
steamer Belgic, also bound for Honolulu,
was spoken.
The China was bowling along at full
speed, evidently with the intention of
getting into Honolulu as quickly as pos
sible and getting her coal aboard to be
ready to make room for some of the other
transports on their arrival. At Hono
lulu everybody was on the tip toe of ex
pectation and a right royal time had
been prepared for the soldier boys.
The Alameda did not see any trace of
the Monterey and her consort, the collier
Brutus. The two vessels left here on the

GREETINGS FROM MINNESOTA.
Cordial Message From the Minneapolis
Board of Trade,
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., June 29.â The people and the presa of Min
neapolis have been pleased to recognize the kindness of the people of
San Francisco to the Minnesota troops encamped there, and to-day the
following resolution was adopted by the Minneapolis Board of Trade:
Whereas, The people of California and particularly the residents of
San Francisco, whose opportunities were greater, were unremitting:
in their efforts to make the sojourn among them of the Thirteenth
Regiment, Minnesota Volunteers, memorable for its comfort and cour
teous hospitality, and
Whereas, The hearts of fathers, mothers and friends of the boys In
the Thirteenth have been very deeply affected by the generous, unceas
ing kindness of these unknown friends, and
Whereas, The sensibilities of all the people of Minnesota have been
likewise touched by this gracious and unlooked for consideration,
which marks and emphasizes the common citizenship of the people of
all the States; now, therefore, be it by the Board of Trade of the city
of Minneapolis
Resolved, That on behalf of the people of this city and especially
on behalf of fathers, mothers and immediate friends of the boys In the
Thirteenth Regiment, Minnesota Volunteers, it sends its greeting to the
people of San Francisco and the great State of California, and assures
them of the grateful appreciation of the citizens of Minneapolis and of
the North Star State for the cordial reception and generous kindness
extended and manifested to Minnesota Volunteers.

FAREWELL TO COMPANY G.
Alameda Does Honor to Her
Brave Soldiers â Impressive
Ceremonies.
ALAMEDA, June 29.â Not in many
years has Alameda been so stirred or wit
nessed such an enthusiastic meeting as
was held this morning in order to bid
farewell to Company G prior to its march
ing to Camp Barrett and joining its com
rades there in preparation for war.
The meeting was arranged on the short
est notice, but that notice was sufficient
to bring enough people out to have crowd
ed Armory Hall half a dozen times over.
Those who were fortunate enough to get
Inside enjoyed a programme which was
full of interest from beginning to end.
C. L. Weller presided, and after the
members of the company had marched in
he introduced President J. F. Forderer of
the Board of Trustees, who responded
briefly. Messrs. Waymire, Judge Ells
worth, Green Majors, Lamborn and Cu
bery made short speeches, extending the
sympathy of the community to the boys
and wishing them godspeed. An attempt
was made to induce some one of the Red
Cross Ladies to make a few remarks, but
it was unsuccessful. Mrs. F. H. McCor
mick sang "Just Before the Battle,
Mother," which brought tears to the eyes
of many in the audience. Professor Fair
weather sang a song of his own compo
sition, entitled, "Who's Afraid?" and fol
loweu it with "Vive I' America." Mrs. F.
H. McCormick sang "The Star-Spangled
Banner," the soldiers and audience rising
and joining in the chorus, and then the
exercises concluded with the singing of
the "Battle Prayer" by Miss Patterson.
After the audience had left the hall the
soldiers took their arms and, headed by a
band, marched through the center of the
town, countermarching and taking up the
route to the camp, where they pitched
their tents and were soon absorbed in the
regiment. Lunch was served them at
noon by the ladies of the Red Cross.
There were 101 men in line when the com
pany left town.
MONEY FOR MANILA.
A Large Amount of Gold Is
Shipped on the Transport
Steamer Newport.
The steamer Newport, which sailed with
General Merritt for the Philippines yes
terday morning, will bring joy to the
hearts of our troops in Manila, as it car
ries a large sum of money for the pay
ment of the soldiers and the purchase of
needed supplies. It is said that the steam
er carries from one to three million dol
lars .in gold. It will be remembered that
General Merritt, in addition to the money
necessary for the use of the troops in the
near future, asked the Prf-sident for $100,
000 to be used by him as an emergency
fund at his discretion, and suggested how
this money could be appropriated for such
purpose. This $100,000 is probably included
In the coin shipment on the Newport.
ARMY HEADQUARTERS.
Major General Otis and Major
General Merriam Are at
the Phelan Building.
The offices vacated by Major General
Merritt in the Phelan building are now
occupied by Major General Otis and a
portion of his staff, Colonel Barry once
more being at his desk as adjutant gen
eral. Yesterday General Otis spent a por
tion of his time at Camp Merritt and he
proposes to do this every day- until the
sailing of the next expedition, which will
be about July 11, and with which It is his
present intention to take his departure.
He is making every effort to have the
fleet sail on or before that date.
There are now remaining at Camp Mer
ritt nearly 9000 troops. This force, witn
the addition of the First New York Regi
ment, io siart for San Francisco to-day,
and the troop? now at the Presidio ana
those en rouie to Manila, will make an
army of about 21,000 men for the Philip
pines.

EVENTS AT THE PRESIDIO.
The Washington Volunteers
Are Highly Praised by the
Regular Army Officers.
The first battalion of four companies
of the Washington Volunteers, under
Major Weisenberger, stationed at the
Presidio, is making â¢wonderful advance
ment in military work. Every man is anx
ious to learn, and the commendable zeal
displayed by these volunteers has excited
the most favorable comment of the regu
lar army officers. This battalion and also
the one under Lieutenant Colonel Fife,
now at Fontana Barracks, but to mova
to-day to Angel Island, will in all prob
ability be sent to the Philippines, as they
are made up of the right kind of material.
The troops of the Fourth Cavalry fully
expect to start for Manila on the next
expedition. The recruits are rapidly
reaching a high degree of proficiency in
their work.
Batteries D and G of the Sixth United
States Artillery, in command of Major
Grugan, are comfortably located at Camp
Miller, and from now until their departure
for Manila will do some hard work in
drilling. These batteries are to be re
cruited to their full strength.
Major Hess of the Third United States
Artillery has been assigned to duty at
Fort Point, with Major Kinzie's artillery
and a battalion of the Sixth California
Volunteers.
The monthly muster and inspection of
the Presidio troops takes place to-day.
A board for the examination of candi
dates for second lieutenant in the regular
army will ' convene at the Presidio to
day.
A general court-martial for the trial of
volunteers is in session at the Presidio.
Among the cases before .the court are
those of two men of the California Heavy
Artillery, one of whom is charged with
sleeping while on duty and the other
with disobedience of orders.

SOLDIER OR CIVILIAN..
THERE is an ancient belief, strengthened by
ages of experience, that no man can worthily
serve two masters. Evidently District Attor
ney Barnes does not accept this. While he essays
to gird on the sword, he would still retain his grasp
of a civil office.
Whatever legal question may be involved, whether
he may have a technical right to enact a dual role
does not matter particularly. There can be no two
opinions as to the violation of good taste involved
in the peculiar course of young Mr. Barnes. If he
were to tnlist in the army and resign from his office
he might be admired for the patriotism displayed, for
in some measure such a move would be a sacrifice.
But wiien he says in effect that he will enter the
army, and if the situation does not suit him, will re
sign and take up again the work of the courts, he
does not do honor to himself as a citizen, and there
is manifest in his declaration nothing of that ex
alted quality known as love of country. The ap
parent motive is love of young Mr. Barnes.
The District Attorney says that he will take the
captaincy of the Petaluma troops, and that if they
be not ordered to the front he will leave the com
mand. This is not the talk of a soldier. When a
man is inspired by the threat of war or by actual
hostilities to take up arms, he does not stop to in
quire where he shall ha sent. He agrees to go with
out protest wherever orders decre* and wherever
there is greatest need. It is not for him to dictate,
but to obey. If he is not ready to do this he is not
fit to be a soldier, and for him to avail himself of in
fluence to secure a position which a real soldier and
patriot would be glad to take is a policy so badly
selfish that it should be discouraged. There is no
justice in allowing the Petaluma boys to be placed
under the direction of an ambitious civilian who will
stay with them only so long as the position may be
precisely what he thinks it ought to be. War is
not made for the gratification of personal ambition.
By serving a few weeks Mr. Barwcs would have
the title of captain fastened upon him forever more,
and in after years could make brave speeches, telling
how he helped to crush Spain. But if he is going
into the service he should have a motive higher than
this. By clinging, with doubtful tenure, to a
civil office, and hinting at the probaWlity of return
to it, he shows that he lacks the essentials of the army
man. He must be either soldier or civilian. In try
ing to be both he will fail doubly.
BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN GATE PARK.
THERE is nothing else in which the citizens of
San Francisco so uniformly take pride as in
Golden Gate Park. They know it to be a
beautiful place, and yet even they do not realize fully
how superior it is to the park of any other large city
in the world. They catch fleeting glimpses of it as
they speed along the drives, but in this way get only
an inkling of its attractions. They miss the wide
vistas of green, the winding walks, the little shaded
valleys. There are lakes and knolls and groves they
never see.
One of the unapproachable features of the park Is'
that it is a park all the year round. When the parks
of New York and Chicago are dreary -wastes of snow
and leafless shrubbery, ours is at its best, the grass
brilliant, the foliage dense, the birds singing. No
wonder that the people of this city are willing to
expend money liberally to keep up improvements,
and make new ones. For all that has been accom
plished, Golden Gate Park is but a hint of what it
is destined to be. No spirit of economy, tending to
cause retrogression, or even check the advance of San
Francisco's great playground, would be acceptable.
Every dollar spent there goes for the permanent bet
terment of the entire city.
The law permits an assessment of 10 cents on each
$100 worth of property taxed, the sum thus raised
to be devoted to the park. Last year this maximum
was not reached, the assessment being less than 6
cents, creating a fund of $207,000, which was far too
small. Improvements which had been contemplated
had to be abandoned for the time. The public was
not pleased at this. There is no desire to skimp
the n^rk appropriation, and the Supervisors in doing
bo would make a mistake which they themselves
would recognize later. To have the appropriation
generous this year would be a popular course. Prob
ably the legal maximum need not be reached, and
yet if the required total make necessary the reaching
of the maximum, there would be no complaint from
the people who pay the money and for whose equal
benefit it is expended. Let the work of extending
Golden Gate Park improvements to the sea go on
Money could not be more wisely employed, could
not be promoted to a more lasting good.
Ohio recruits spanked a brakeman at Reno. While
the act was not particularly dignified, and is not pro
vided for in military ethics, the soldiers had the good
excuse that the brakeman needed it
THE MARKET-STREET QUESTION.
WHILE all of the articles contained in the July
number of the Merchants' Association Review
are of timely interest and pertinent to the con
ditions of the city, the one which will perhaps appeal
to the largest' number of citizens is that by D. V.
Kelly, relating to the proposed improvement of the
Market street pavement
Mr. Kelly heads his article with the question, "Pav
ing or patching .Market street: Which?" He ans
wers his query by saying, "The Market Street Rail
way Company alone can answer." In explanation
of this fact he asserts that the railway company con
stitutes the obstacle to the proper improvement of
the street, because in addition to the cable car track
on the street it holds a franchise for a ftorse car line,
the tracks of which are laid on each side of the cable
tracks. Thus fully one-third of the street is occu
pied by the street car company. The fear is ex
pressed that even when the repaying is done the street
will be only "repatched with a strip of bitumen along
each side of the car tracks, simply altering the ap
pearance of the street without improving it"
While the public will agree with Mr. Kelly as to
the desirability of getting rid of the horse car tracks,
it does, not appear that he is justified In holding that
the Market street company can prevent the proper
paving of Market street whenever the city gets ready
ro undertake the work. Furthermore, there is no
conclusive evidence before the public that the com
pany would object to the repavement Even if it
did object, however, there is a way of compelling its
compliance.
The true answer to the question, "Paving or Patch-
Ing: Which?" Is to be found only after a full con
sideration of the subject. As The Call has repeat
edly pointed out, any attempt at paving Market street
before the sewer system and the conduits for wires
of various kinds are adequately constructed would
be in the end nothing more than a patch-work im
provement of the worst kind. Hardly would the
pavement be laid under such circumstances than it
would have to be torn up again to allow for this un
derground work. The process of tearing up by
piecemeal would go on continually, and the new
pavement, no matter how carefully laid down in the
first place, would soon be a mass of tatters and
patches.
The desirability of improving Market street is not
questioned by any one. The avenue occupies in
San Francisco a more important place than any
street in any other city. It is the main artery of
traffic, the chief avenue of promenading, the center
of business, the thoroughfare by which nearly all visi
tors enter the city. Nearly every street in San Fran
cisco runs into it, and nearly all persons traverse it
to a greater or less extent in passing from their
homes to their places of business. Its improvement
is therefore a matter of prime necessity, and the pub
lic will support cordially any well directed efforts the
Merchants' Association may make to accomplish the
result. It must not be overlooked, however, that
the improvement when it comes must be thorough.
It is not a mere question of removing horse car
tracks, but of putting the whole street into condition
to fit all the' needs of the business, carried on along it.
THE HAUL OF JUSTICE.
THE excuse for the delay in completing the Hall
of Justice, put forward by Mr. Britt at the last
meeting of fhe Board of Supervisors, is not
likely- to satisfy the public It may be and probably
is interesting for the contractors to experiment with
terra cotta plants in and around Stockton, but just
why such an enterprise should entirely stop work
on a San Francisco public building needs further il
lustration. â  We imagine thaf this terra cotta yarn
jis intended for the marines. Perhaps Bateman Bros.,
! the contractors; think the population of this city is
made up of marines. If it is, such a story is ex
ceedingly appropriate. ;
We agree with an evening contemporary, which
discusses the matter with' considerable spirit) that it
is high time the people of. San Francisco put a stop
to the custom some contractors have adopted of mak
! ing necessary public work a football in their busi
ness. The practice of these men is to get a Govern
ment job and work on it when they have nothing
'else to do. Bateman Bros, have evidently taken the
i Hall of Justice at too low a figure and they are seek
ing to pull through on changing markets for ma
terials and various expedients, of which the alleged
terra eotta plant at Stockton may be one.
This is all wrong and a stop should be put to it
immediately. The public business is just as impor
tant as any other and the people have just as good
I a right to have their buildings erected promptly as
; private parties. It is an outrage that work should
be delayed on the Hall of Justice for the accommo
dation of contractors who, in order to euchre their
â¢ competitors, have taken the work at too low a figure.
It is a public outrage that the people of San Fran
cisco should be compelled to transact their postal
business in a barn while the Treasury Department of
ficials are skylarking around the site at Seventh and
Mission streets- and contractors are leisurely litigat
ing questions involving" the national labor laws in
I the United States courts.
The fact- is, a few contractors and builders in this
vicinity need to be shaken up. If the Board of Su
pervisors were able to resist the pull of Bateman
Bros, it would now kick those gentlemen out of the
Hall Of Justice and award the work to somebody else
collecting at the same, time the forfeit provided by
| the former's contract. In this way a useful lesson
might be administered and a public service rendered
j As things are going the Hall of Justice will not be
completed for a hundred years. There is no guar
antee that when Bateman. Bros, finish with their terra
cotta experiments at "Stockton they will not undertake
to make bricks, develop iron mines, establish a steel
; manufacturing plant, or go to Europe and engage in
the business of preparing cement.
If these contractors have taken the contract for this
, work at too low a figure they should be made to give
it up. It is important that the Hall of Justice should
i be completed some time during the twentieth cen
tury.

THE SAN FRAXCTSCO CALL., THURSDAY, JUNE 30, 1898.
THE FOURTH OF JULY.
AN address from J. E. O'Donnel, president of
the Fourth of July committee, to the citizens
of San Francisco says:
"You are respectfully requested to co-operate with
your neighbors in the matter of decorations. It
will be impossible for this committee, in observing
the economy adopted, to expend any amount for
street decorations; and, therefore, it relies upon you
to exhibit your patriotism by expending the amount
you. would have subscribed to this committee for the
celebration, in decorating your place of business in
conjunction with your neighbors, so that the line of
parade may be a continual decoration."
To this appeal a cordial and universal response
should be given. No citizen residing or
doing business on the proposed line of march should
neglect it. The committee has not asked much, cer
tainly not more than it has a right to expect of citi
zens animated by both civic pride and national pa
triotism.
The celebration of the Fourth will be this year
throughout the country one of the most ardent and
enthusiastic in the history of the nation. The occa
sion calls for something more than the usual demon
stration of joy in the greatness of the republic and
gratitude to the men who founded It on principles
of liberty, equality and justice. This year we are
engaged in a great war. Once more the souls of
men are being tried by the stern test of battle. Once
more we must show forth the enthusiasm of a loy
alty that braves danger and death for home and
country, and counts no sacrifice of self too great to
be paid for the maintenance of the cause of the
Union.
The ardor of patriotism which now infuses all
classes of citizens has already shown itself in many
ways. Volunteers have answered quickly the call
for men. Millionaires have been profuse in their
offers of wealth to aid the equipment of troops. Cit
izens of moderate means have subscribed liberally to
the national loan. Women have given their time,
their energies and their work to the service of the
Red Cross. Contributions from a thousand sources
have poured into the funds that are being provided
for the care of the sick or the wounded among the
soldiers, and for the care of any among their families
who may be left destitute.
All this has been well done. There remains to
make the Fourth of July the occasion of a grand
demonstration of all the ardent feelings of patriotism
which have prompted to so many deeds of loyalty
since the war began. In that demonstration every
citizen should do his share and take his part. The
duty imposed for the day upon those whose build
ings front the line of march of the parade is to decor
ate. Let all make preparations for it, so that noth
ing will be lacking when the great day comes.
ARMY CONTRACTS AND COOLIE LABOR
SINCE a newspaper in this city, the Bulletin,
has been found to discourage the efforts now
being made to put a stop to the employment
of Chinese labor on army contracts, it is more im
portant than ever to push the good fight begun by
tbe white labor unions, and to aid them in accom
plishing the purpose for which they began it.
The only argument by which the Bulletin has
sought to sustain the extraordinary policy it has
adopted is that agitation on the subject may produce
what it calls a "great rumpus" and thereby lead the
Government officials to let no war contracts in San
Francisco at all. The argument is not only un
sound, but is hardly specious. No profit is derived
by the white workers of San Francisco from jobs let
out to the sweatshops of Chinatown, and nothing
would be lost to them if such jobs were not given
out in this city. As a matter of fact, it would be
better for our working men and women if the Gov
ernment supplies were to be manufactured by white
labor elsewhere rather than by coolie labor, either
here or anywhere
It is, of course, to be regretted that it has been
necessary to have any agitation on the subject, but
the regret 13 not for the agitation, but for the cause
of it. It having been made known that a consider
able proportion of the war contracts Jet in this city
are being filled by the employment of Chinese labor
there was nothing left the labor councils but to pro
test against the wrong and make the protest known
to the proper authorities. That is what they have
done, and it is gratifying to learn that they are in a
fair way to succeed in their efforts to put an end to the
wrong. San Francisco will lose nothing in any re
spect by the. contest, and has the prospect of winning
much.
It is beyond all question that there is sufficient
white labor in San Francisco to perform all the work
required to fulfill every army contract let to our bid
ders. There are many large establishments here
employing none but white labor that could readily
handle the orders given for uniforms. Even if the
present force of employes in these places should be
insufficient to perform the work in the short space of
time allowed, it would be easy to obtain additional
workers. There are plenty of white men and white
girls here who would be glad to have steady work
at good wages. There is, therefore, no excuse for
the employment of Chinese, and the Bulletin, in mis
representing the protest of the labor councils and
The Call, is simply giving a sneaking support to the
coolies.
The President of the Colonial Cabinet is a pictur
esque sort of chap. He hoped tht sky would fall
flat into an abyss before the foreign invader had
pressed foot to the soil. Yet he may find the foot
prints of the foreign invader right now, and the sky
remains where it has been as far back as memory
goes. But, anyhow, the sky could not fall flat into
an abyss. It would necessarily be doubled up like
the letter V, and then the abyss would need to be
very deep or the jagged edges of cerulean blue would
protrude, an unsightly obstacle to pedestrianism. All
things considered, the sky seems to be doing the best
service where it is.
It was not strange that Major General Merritt
should have expressed a lively sense of appreciation
for the way in which he and his soldiers have been
treated in San Francisco. That the people of this
city have from the first been more than merely cor
dial is a simple fact. The soldiers have been re
garded as guests, and have been sent on their way
with such heartfelt good wishes as they will remem
ber while memory lasts.
A Mr. Woods writes a letter, expressing distate
for the clamor marking the departure of troops for
Manila. There are reasons for believing the only
way to stop it will be to enjoin the embarkation of
more soldiers. Can't Woods issue a ukase or an
irade, or something?
One of the standing mysteries of the war is the
intention of General Miles as to going or staying.
An announcement concerning the matter is made

THE PRICE WE PAY.
Our flag has flown for a hundred years,
For a century flown â unfurled.
It has proudly laughed at the coward'B
fears,
It has won the pride of the world.
It was flung to the breeze at Bunker Hill
With faith and fighting and prayer â
If blood be the price of Liberty,
Lord God! we paid it there.
To thy honor and glory, Lord, it waved
In the Mediterranean Sea;
It conquered the Tripoli pirates, Lord-
All honor and praise to Thee.
It humbled the pride of the Algiers Dey,
It cleared thy roads of sin.
If blood be the price of Liberty,
If blood be the price of Liberty,
Lord God! we have paid it in.
When in 1812 our ancient foe
Dared us once more to tight,
Our ting went as far as a Hag could go
In the cause of just and right.
Battered and shattered with snot and
shell,
It laughed at the foeman's rage.
If blood be the price of Liberty,
If blood bo the price of Liberty,
Lord God! we have paid the wag-e.
Wo carried the flag to Monterey,
And we carried it back in pride.
"We knew the price we should have to pay,
aiid they paid the price who died.
Thoy lie 'neath Mexico's tropical sky,
And we honor their names to-day,
If blood be the price of Liberty,
If blood be the price of Liberty,
Lord God! did we grudge the pay?
In a glorious causeâ to make men free,
Kin against nearest kin.
We fought, O Lord, by command of Thee,
And to clear our land of sin.
Our country groaned with the horror and
grief
Of mothers, of children, of wives;
If blood be the price of Liberty,
If blood be the price of Liberty,
Lord God! did we stint our lives?
Prom an isle in the sea we heard the cry
Of woman and child in pain.
And our country's best are marching to
die,
Or to humble the pride of Spain.
This land of the West, where our flag aye
flies.
Is forever the land of the free;
If blood be the price of Liberty,
If blood be the price of Liberty,
If blood be the price of Liberty,
Lord God! we have paid it to Thee!

A COMPANY OF HEBREWS
The Sixth Company of Infantry, M g .
aehusettf? provisional militia, was mus
tered into the service of the State last
evening at the South Armory by Inspec
tor General Carter. This is the first com
pany of its make-up that has ever taken
service with the militia of the State.
Therefore, there was much interest taken
by military men and others in the even
ing's proceedings. The company is al
most entirely made up of young men of
the Hebrew persuasion, and a majori y
are evidently citizens through natura!:Â«.a
tion. General Carter was very careful
throughout the evening to impress the
men with an idea that in joining the mili
tia they were taking a step of much mo
ment, and the recruits evidently appre
ciated the fact. Before {he muster the
men assembled In the large drill hall r,*
the armory, where they were examined
personally by the inspector general. He
asked them questions of different kinds
to bring out their knowledge of English
or their lack of it; their business, their
earning capacity and whether they were
citizens or not. This took the best part
of two hours. Then, with them standing
in double ranks, he administered the oath.
Following this. General Carter explained
their duties as to drill, and said if it was
desired to proceed to an election of offi
cers, the four days' notice could be waived
and the election held then. The notice
being waived, General Carter proceeded
to an election with this result:
For captain, Samuel H. Borofsky; first
lieutenant, William Morris; second lieu
tenant. Morris Silverstein. Captain Borof
sky is a member of the Common Council
from ward 6. . . ...
The men of this company are a bright,
clean-looking lot. of the age most suita
ble for military service. Some of them
have already seen service, a number of
them in the Russian army and one in the
army of Roumania.â Boston Herald.
A VETERAN`S PROTEST.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: As
exemplifying the policy and methods of
the California State military authorities
In commissioning officers to commands
under the President's calls my own case
seems to serve.
Early in April of this year I offered my
services in writing to the State, named
my rank as an artillery officer during the
rebellion and gave my service record and
references, the latter comprising living
and well-known officers of the United
States army and also United States vol
unteers, several residing in San Francis
co now. I was notified of receipt of my
letter, with no intimation that age or
other circumstances inhibited against my
eligibility. Upon announcement of the
second call I renewed my offer and May
29 I was in reply informed that it should
have "due consideration upon the receipt
of the call from the Secretary of War."
Since that date no written communica
tion has been made to me in the matter.
I accordingly called personally upon the
adjutant general of the State and was
by him distinctly informed that the pol
icy of the State government was to give
preference to the National Guard of the
State, and there was no probability of
others being considered for appointment.
I now read that District Attorney Barnes
Is appointed to a captaincy in the new
regiment, and cannot learn that he is of
the State National Guard.
I submit that this is an affront to old
service officers who are willing, as I am,
ana I so stated In my letters to the ad
jutant general, to waive rank equal to my
last service rank in the field and to re
linquish claim to pension for self and
heirs. I served as major, commanding
Reserve Artillery, Third Corps. Gen
eral D. E. Sickles (whose warm letter of
recommendation I sent with my applica
tion), but I offered to accept a junior sec
ond lieutenancy if necessary that I might
serve as an officer.
The disastrous results of officering raw
troops with green officers are only too
well known to all who served in the late
war or any war. These officers often be
come good officers, but only after sacri
ficing health and lives of the men while
learning to be officers in the field.
I do not ask the public to consider me
or my case, except as illustrating the
conduct of the State officials, in repeat
ing the egregious blunders of 1861 to 1865,
and I invite the attention of the friends
of the brave men who volunteer as pri
vates to the unnecessary perils to which
this policy exposes these patriotic volun
teers. I am. sir. respectfully yours,
WALTER M. BRAMHALL

PATRIOTIC, BUT HARDLY PRAC
TICABLE.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
Why not change the names of American
towns with Spanish names, or, at least,
turn those capable of translation into
English? Take, for instance, San Fran
cisco (St. Francis), San Antonio (St. An
thony) and others named after saints for
names to be translated, and Madrid, To
ledo, Dolores and others to be changed
absolutely and a good and decent Ameri
can name given insteadâ say, the name
of one of our naval heroes, like Sigsbee,
Bagley or others. Spanish names are
hard to pronounce, too. Yours,
J. T. WERMUTH.

Players, No Matter What Position
They Occupy, Should Know Be
forehand What to Do Whea
They Get the Ball.
BY JOE CORBETT.
I have long desired to discover, since
giving so much attention to the games
I now going on at Recreation Park, why
in close and critical plays players claiming
recognition through past performances
and otherwise make so many mistakes
and in general play inferior and at times
very stupid ball. Instances too numerous
to mention where baserunners wore per
mitted to score or advance, as the case
may be. when a little judgment on the
part of the man fielding the ball could
easily have prevented them, have, from a
baseball standpoint, marred the beauty of
more than one game played since the con
solidation. The casual observer, as well
as those patrons of the game who devote
but little of their time in figuring out
â whether or not a play was properly con
summated, are. as a general rule, ignor
ant regarding the correctness of a play.
However, there is another class of indi
viduals who regularly attend all games
and who are quite competent to criticize,
through their knowledge of the art, many
of the plays, I am intent on referring to
in this article. 1 might also be safe in
stating that this latter class of fanatics
Is greatly in the majority, and the sooner
players acquaint themselves with this
fact the better it will be for them in
every conceivable sense.
In last Saturday's game between the
Oaklands and Sand Crabs there occurred
enough stupid misplays to nil a book.
Owing principally to the closeness of the
contest and us sensational climax, these
Imperfect plays were allowed to pass un
noticed, but not into oblivion. Now, how
ever, as sufficient time lias been allowed
"us critics" to least on the mistakes of
others, the question arises. How is it that
an intelligent fellow like Mr. Sykes would,
us he did In Saturday's game, stop a ball
with a man on first, and, instead of at
tempting to complete a double play by
throwing to second, feel satisfied that his
work was properly finished when he re
tired the latter by simply touching the
initial base? It certainly was not ignor
ance of the correct manner in which the
lilay should have terminated on the part
of Mr. Sykes, as it was a very ordinary
one and simple in the extreme. Why,
then, did not Mr. Sykes, enjoying a per
fect knowledge of the play, attend to its
being consummated in accordance with
this knowledge and with the primary laws
of baseball? The answer is quite simple
he did not construct the play before the
ball was hit, and in consequence when he
received it a state of bewilderment im
mediately followed. â He looked toward
second base and saw that the runner was
not half way; yet, instead of throwing the
ball in that direction, walked over and
proudly stood upon first. True, one man
was put out on the play, but it does not
necessarily follow that the play was cor
Â« rect. It emphatically was not, and Mr.
Ja Sykes knew it. He should have thrown
W to second and retired that runner, and as
7 Mr. Sullivan, the gentleman who hit the
sphere, is by no means a fast sprinter,'
the chances for a double play were pro
vokingiy excellent.
Mr. Sykes is not the only player con
tinually breaking the first rules of base
ball. Mr. O'Neil, his side partner, who
has been connected with the national
game long enough to be its great-great
grandfather, makes plays occasionally
which not only dazzle, but have such an
intoxicating effect on Colonel T. P. Rob
inson that his absence from Recreation
Park during practice is often attributed
to business, when In reality he Is recuper
ating. For as he himself says, "The mel
lifluous epithets which emanate from that
vast multitude encircling yonder fence
every time my first love, Tip, shows the
effects of overwork, produces a feeling of
utter disregard for even baseball glory,
and is more Intoxicating, if I may use the
expression, than the sparkling beverages.
Tip made a play in this same
Oakland-Santa Cruz game, which
was not as simple a play as that
of Mr. Sykes, yet which was
brought to an unsatisfactory ending, be
cause O'Neil, while he constructed his
play, did so negligently.
The exact moment of the play I have
forgotten, but it occurred In this man
ner: Santa Cruz had a man on third
base and the Oakland infield was playing
In, with the intention of catching this
â  runner at the plate, should he attempt
to score. The ball was hit to O'Neil, com
ing directly into his hands, and he appa
rently fielded it perfectly. The man on
third, however, scored, and Mr. O'Neil re
luctantly tosed the ball to first, retiring
the batter. Now, something went wrong
with that play, as the man on third had
no more of a start than is usually taken.
Where, then, does the fault lie? With
Mr O'Neil. He only had his play half
constructed, for instead of going in oil
the ball he waited for it, and was lost.
My advice, therefore, comprises a rule,
Construct your play before the ball is
pitched. By this i mean say to yourself
while the pitcher is maneuvering in the
box "What will I do with the ball should
it come to me? In the case of Mr. Sykes
it should have been: If It comes to me
JÂ»ny way fast 1 will immediately throw
**^t to second, return to the bag and be
In position to receive the throw from
eecond should the play necessitate one.
Had he done this a double play would
have inevitably resulted, providing, of
course, that his throw to second was
perfect and also the return.
Every player should have his play con
structed before the pitcher delivers the
bail. Think of the time that is lost if,
ufter you pick up the ball, a glance at
the situation is necessary before you can
throw it to the proper place. Ml splay
upon misplay occurs in this manner. A
player picks a ball up. The bases are
lull. He has not constructed his play, and
Is consequently bewildered. All he can
see Is runners tearing around the bases
at a breakneck speed, yet bo remains as
though petrified, If he does not do this
the ball is thrown after the situation is
taken in by a hurried glance, and very
often arrives at its destination too late.
I have Been it happen many a time,
even in the National League, although
in the latter place it generally occurs
through negligence, and these players
pay for their negligence. At Recreation
Park however, it is a common occur
rence to see players do the wrong thing
In critical plays. They do so, I sincerely
believe, because they have never been
told otherwise. If â¢ they will, however,
follow this construction rule an astonish
ing improvement will surely characterise
their efforts. No matter what the situa
tion, no matter what position you play,
the rule applies to all.

Ning Yang Benevolent Association, 15
WILL PLAY THE PART OF ST. CLAIR
Dr. Frank B. Robinson, Who Is to Take a Part in a
Revival ol "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
Dr. Frank B. Robinson, Bon of the late Dr. Luke Robinson, an<! a gen
eral favorite In society circles of this city, will appear in the part of St.
Clair in the production of Uncle Tom's Cabin" at the California on Satur
day evening. Pr. Robinson has shown marked ability in an amateur way
and his many friends will doubtless enjoy the experience of seeing him
among prof': ssionals.
"This affair is a large and well developed joke on me," said he Sn
speaking of his coming appearance "The report has gone out that I
have been stage-struck and abandoned my profession for the allurements
of the .stupo. Afl a consequence rry triendfl are having no end of fun at my
expense. They stop me on the street, congratulate me and ask me what
kind of flowers I prefer. Would I like to have them in the form of 'a
lance.,' 'a saw' or 'a plaster-cast?' 1 can only offer a sad smile and ex
planations, but these do not disabuse their minds and they exuberate still.
They nend me notes by messenger and mail, call me up at the unholy hour
of midnight and rar^fully amuse therr>se)ves by asking me for parses; how
1 succeeded in breaking into the charmr-d histrionic circle and pleasing
queries such an 'Who hypnotized you into the idea that you could act?'
â¢ All these experiences were easy, but when it came to squaring myself
with my family, after the announcements were out, it was another and
serious matter. Why! I dare not go near my mother for fear I would be
unable to properly explain myselr. With my sister it was different. She
came to my office and to her I recited my tale of woe. She consented to be
my embassador to smooth the way lor me; but when the time came for
my appearance at home with explanations, the joke was still too warm
and I actually resorted to the telephone to account for the absence of body
and presence of mind. Oh! yes it is all very funny.
"The whole fact of the case is that I had no idea of becoming a profes
sional and only consented to appear on the original proposition that the
event was to be under the direction Â«>f the Red Cross Society, but that or
ganization .was too much engaged in other matters and had to decline. How
ever, I had accepted and had to stand the consequences."
The foregoing contrite confession was obtained during the rehearsal
yesterday afternoon while the doctor was vainly endeavoring to protect
his patent leathers from, the flying heels of a small army of -vild pickaninnies
and trying to watch Edith Howe's clever conception of Vopsy" and Rhys
Thomas' efforts to descend from the altitude of a lyric tenor to the humble
part of Uncle Tom.
L. R. Stockwell was asked what plausable excuse he had for conceiving
the idea that there was an aching void in this city that could only be
filled by the production of "Uncle Tom" In this epoch of war and car
nage.
"Excuse!" replied he with surprise. "Why don't you know that it is the
duty ofra conscientious manager to produce "Uncle Tom" ajid "East Lynne"
every rwo years in large cities and as often as possible in the country?
Go to, young man; this production will be all right with plenty of local col
or to it. By the way, that reminds me that there is a shortage of 'coonÃ'
In this old town and I must hasten me to Oakland to gather in some of the
floating colored population to assist in this seasonal event."
The rehearsals are progressing nicely and a really acceptable perform
ance is to be expected.
THE *SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUKE 30, 1898.
TWO CELEBRATIONS IN ONE
Irishmen Who Will Commemorate the Rebel
lion of '98 on July 4.
Preparations for the cominj? celebration at Schuetzen Park, on the
Fourth of July, by the members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, in
commemoration of the historical rebellion of "98," are nearing completion,
and the demonstration, as already outlined, promises to be one of the most
memorable events in the history of the organization on this Coast. The
preliminary work of months, coupled with the Indefatigable zeal of those
directly interested in the honouring of one of Ireland's foremost victories,
has ended in the arrangement of a perfect programme of patriotic exer
cises and national games. This celebration, which in character will be a
dual commemoration of the Irish Rebellion and the natal day of the Ameri
can Union, will also partake of the nature of a general outing for the Irish
population of the city. Lead by the Knights of the Red Branch, a pro
cession of hundreds of Irishmen will march down Market street early
Monday morning to the ferry, where, accompanied by a band of musicians,
they will board the 10 o'clock boat for Schuetzen Park.
McMahon and McCarthy will provide the jig and reel music, and plat
forms have been built for the dancers. The professional dancers will in
clude Messrs. Kelleher, O'Connor and others, and a large number of ama
teurs have entered. Valuable prizes will be awarded. There will also be
games, including tug of war contests, races of all kinds and jumping,
throwing the hammer, etc. The patriotic exercises will be held on a special
platform. Hon. Robert Ferral will deliver the oration. The poem will be by
Eustace Cuelman. Augustine Costello of New York will deliver an address
on the evils of alliance with England. "The Star Spangled Banner" will
be sung. The Declaration of Independence will be read and the memories of
" '9S" revived by song and recitation.

ARRANGING FOR
THE NEW WAR TAX
INSTRUCTIONS FOX THE SOUTH-
ERN PACIFIC AGENTS.
"When the Company Pays the Tax and
When the Shippers Pay
the Bill.
Circulars were issued yesterday by J.
C. Stubbs and William Sproule of the
Southern Pacific directing their agents in
the stamping of all bills for freight in ac
cordance with the new war tax.
In the case of bills of lading for goods
exported to foreign countries the original
bill alone is stamped. The compary is
obliged to ipsue a receipt for goods and
this will be stamped by the company. All
duplicates must be stamped at the ex
pense of the shipper. The stamps re
quired will be furnished by the railway
company.
Whenever bonds are required the ship
per will have to pay the 50-cent tax. The
expediency of the payment of the "en
try" tax by the company on goods en
tered In any custom-house for consump
tion or warehousing' will be considered
very carefully by the freight traffic man
agers at the various agencies.
An order for a ticket will not be
stamped, but where the Southern Pacific
Bells tickets, acting for Itself or us an
agent, between domestic and foreign ports
th* ticket covering the ocean service
must also be stamped. Tickets for trans
pacific ports will be honored by the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company and the
Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany. As the Canadian Pacific Company
is exempt from this tax the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company and the Occidental
and Oriental Steamship Company will
have to pay it.
When the Southern Pacific Company
or Its agents sells an order for an ocean
passage ticket to a foreign port, which
order is to be exchanged by the agent of
the ocean carrier at the port of embark
ation for a passage ticket, such order is
not subject to the tax.
Cogswell Fountain Gone.
The old Cogswell fountain, which for
years has stood at the junction of Cali
fornia, and Market streets, was yesterday
removed to the corporation yards and
relegated to the rubbish heap. It is stated
that a handsome flagpole will be erected
in its place by the merchants of that sec
tion.

JUDGE CONLAN
INDIGNANT
Trouble Over the Case of
a Dive Waitress.
CONFLICTING STATEMENTS
THE POLICE HINT THEY HAVE
BEEN TBICKED.
Some Interesting Developments Are
Expected When the Matter Is
Called in Court This
Morning.
The case of Kate Edington, a "dive"
waitress, has caused a feeling of unpleas
antness to arise between the arresting
officers. Sergeant Helms and Policeman
Cavanaugh, and Judge Conlan, which will
be ventilated in the Judge's court this
morning.
The woman was arrested on June 20 on
a charge of vagrancy. The case was as
signed to Judge Conlan's court and when
it was called the following morning it was
at the request of the police continued till
last Friday. The case was dismissed on
Friday and there is where the trouble
originated. According to the police they
wished the case continued till Saturday
and were surprised to find when they
went into court that day that it had been
changed on the calendar to "dismissed."
They again arrested the woman and the
case was assigned to Judge Mogan's court.
The police claim that the woman boast
ed that it had cost her $:*5 to "square" the
case and that she had been able to outwit
the police. She told them that when she
left the court room Friday a police court
attorney named Quigley or Quinlan had
approached her and said it was no use to
have the case continued from time to
time. He took her back and had the case
dismissed.
Judge Conlan admits dismissing the case
Friday, but says it was done inadvertent
ly. "I thought it was an old case," saia
the Judge, "and as the officers were not
in court to prosecute I ordered it Strlckeii
from tiie calendar. I was not in court
Saturday, Judge Mogan taking my place,
but I understand the officers called that
day and complained about the case beinjj
dismissed. I was informed of that fact
Monday morning and at once placed the
case again on my calendar. The officers
sent word to continue the case till to-day,
and when it was called to-day neither of
them appeared and 1 have continued it till
to-morrow, and if they fail to appear then
I will dismiss it for lack of prosecution
and will see if they can take it to another
court. I think they have treated this
court with marked discourtesy, to say the
least."
The Judge sent for the woman and shÂ«Â»
denied Riving any attorney a cent to
"square" the case or for any other pur
pose, she had nevei made any such state
ment. The only money Btte had paid was
to the men who went* on her bonds.
The statement that the case was markr-a
"continued" last Friday and afterward
changed to "dismissed is emphatically
denied by the Judge and officers of the
court and It is exp< . that ihe Judgo
will insist upon a thorough investigation.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICACO, June 29.â Wheat started strong on
the wholly unexpected advance at Liverpool.
Crop damage reports continued to pour in, al
though the weather was fairly favorable. A
good deal of complaint was based on the as
sertion that owing to the excess of moisture i
the straw had been abnormally developed, but
the heads had been poorly filled, so that the i
yield was extremely disappointing. The scat- j
tered threshing returns which came from the
fields seemed to confirm this view of the situa
tion. The result was that shorts began to show
a good deal of concern and started to cover,
the demand giving an upward turn to prices.
The market remained firm, but without anima
tion, until after the middle of the session,
when the mere firmness was changed into ex
ceeding strength. The crop damage rt.poru
were too persistent and general to be doubted I
any IC.ni.er. nna the covering of short ivlititl.
which had In the forenoon been conducted
with much care and unobtruslveness, became
too universal for the business to retain (*s
early undemonstrative character. An hour
from the clo-se trading became heavy and
somewhat fxc.tea at odd momenta and the
price rose rapidly and materially, September
reaching 59c, a gain of 2}, c, and July al
vanced \%c. celling at 73*ic. After this 'm
provement there was enough selling of \-jns i
stuff and s-ellirs: for the short account to '
cause a r,l:^ht reaction. Liverpool opened id
higher for July and %d up for later deliver
ies. At the close Liverpool was l^d up or Hd
lower than at '.he opening, and later t'cllÂ»crlÂ»s
were about .is tney had opened. At Lnc rI'JM
July was l%c higher and September 2*4- Lixher
than yesterday.
Good buyi-.S' by shorts in July and prominar.t
longs in s-'Â«:>i'jmber, together with the strength
In wheat, advanced corn. July closed %@lc
higher.
Covering by shorts, unfavorable weather
forecasts and the rally in wheat and corn were
the reasons for the strength in oats. July
closed with a gain of l%c.
Lower prices at the yards and large hog re
ceipts started provisions rather easy. The
decline was all recovered near the close with
the rally In the coarse grains. Pork left oft |
unchanged, lard 2%c lower and ribs 2V40 higher.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. June 29.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
wool market: The wool market has progressed
at a lively pace. Some fair sales of Austra
lian and pulled wools have been made, but
otherwise sales have been light. A great many
mills are running on short time and more ex
pect to be doing so very shortly. Some are
shut down altogether or are running no more
than is necessary to turn out their light-weight
samples. Consequently the wool trade does
not anticipate an immediate improvement in
the demand for raw material. Reports re
garding the Western situation are conflicting,
but it looks as if matters had begun to quiet
down somewhat. Taking both the Inactivity
of the mills and the excessive firmness of the
growers Into account, the outlook for the wool
dealers Is not quite so clear as they might
wish. The trade are practically unanimous in
believing that wool will eventually go to
much higher prices; but they are far from be
ing agreed that this end will be reached in
the immediate future. Prices are as well
maintained as they have been for weeks.
Sales of wool in Boston amounted to 854,000
pounds domestic and 407.500 pounds of foreign,
against a total of 7c3,500 for the previous
week and a total of 7.355.000 for the corre
sponding week last year. Sales since Janu
ary 1. 189S, amounted to 594,505,318 pounds,
against 178,572,600 pounds last year at this
time.

FOUND HIS
CHILDREN IN
SAN LEANDRO
A Millionaire Tracks
His Ex- Wife.
SHOT HIS HOME DESTROYER
CARRIES HIS CONTEST INTO THE
ALASIEDA COURTS.
Spends a Largo Fortune Hunting His
Children, and Their Mother Will
Now Fight to Retain
Them.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 2s.
After searching for four months
through two republics Joel J. Hurt, one ]
of the wealthiest and best known men of !
the State of Wyoming, found his three
little daughters this afternoon In th.c cus
tody of their mother at San Leandro.
Gavin McNab, who, with Milton S. Green,
Is Mr. Hurt's attorney, declares that
he has sacrificed not less than fc.VO.guo in
trying to recover his children.
As soon as they were found a writ of
habeas corpus was issued by Judge Og
den and a couple of Deputy Sheriffs at
once went to San Leandro and brought
the children and their mother into court.
About fifteen years ago Mr. and Mrs.
Hurt lived near Cheyenne, where they
were married. He owned some of the
largest, stock ranches in the State and
is a very prominent man in that section.
He has figured largely in politics, has
held several high offices and on three dif
ferent occasions has been nominated for
Governor, but has always declined the
honor. At the present time no one is bet
ter known i:i his State than Joel Hurt.
For several years after their marriage
the domestic life of the Hurts was all
that could be desired. Three little girls
into the faih..y anu are now aged
â  11, 9 and 7. 'ihey are all very in
telligent anu bright ana give evidence of
having been wen educated and reared in
iuxury.
About two years ago a man who was
under obligations to Hurt became ac- i
quamted with the tatter's wife. He paid
her much attention and finally succeeded
In severing the happy domestic relations
that had existed between her and her
huscanii for many years. Hurt la a Vir
ginian and las larnhy pride prevented him
li'um making his unhappiness public lor
borne time alter he discovered tan perfidy
01 his iaise friend: At last the scandal
became so pronounced that Hurt and his
wile separated and he brought a suit for ;
divorce on serious grounds, including un- j
laithfulnevs. Anxious to prevent a blot i
funowing ins children through life on ac
count 01 their mother's sin, Hurt agreed
to a incdiiication of the aecree, and on
her rruiuise to inaintaln a home In which !
the children should be free from evil in
fluence and be given good education, he
consented Lhat me decree awarding him j
a divorce should be so drawn as to per- i
mit the mother to retain the custody of j
his children.
After a. mtle 'while he discovered proof
that the assuiances of his ex-wife were
nut being kept, and. on the case bell re
opened in court the decree was so modi
lied -is to give trie t'uiher absolute pos
session and custody or the children. This
decree was never enforced, because last
February, alter its modification, Mrs.
Hurt took the three little ones â Juste,
Eva and Kittleâ and commenced the lon
chase that ended to-day.
After the divorce was granted to Hurt
there was a tragedy. The man who ha
spoiled Hurt's home and blighted hi life
and ruined his family showed a contempt
for the injured man's feelings, and on
several occasions tried to provoke a quar
rel. Three different times the defame
attempted to draw his gun on Hurt. At
last he got his reward. He met Hurt on
the street, attempted his old tactics of
provoking a quarrel, and before anybody
was aware that the two men were quar
reling. Hurt's enemy lay dead on the side
walk with a bullet through his heart. The
circumstances were considered so justi
fiable that nothing was done with Hurt,
and all Wyoming commended the action
which his Virginian blood had prompted.
As soon as Hurt was aware that his ex
wife had levanted with the children he
employed Pinkerton's agency to follow
her. After a short time the woman and
children were located in Colorado, and at
once a writ of habeas corpus was pro
cured, compelling her to produce them in
court, in accordance with the order of the
Wyoming court. While this case was
pending, the woman cleared out again and'
Hurt heard nothing of her or her children
till they were located at San Leandro.
The father learned some months ago
that his ex-wife had married a man
named Alfonso Shaeffer. For a long time
he refused to believe that such was the
case for to his personal knowledge Shaef
fer had been convicted of a felony. Hurt,
on one occasion, was In the courtroom at
Cheyenne when Shaeffer was convicted of
grand larceny. The knowledge that his
three little ones were in the custody of his
ex-wife and Shaefter spurred him on to
redouble his efforts to recover them,
knowing that they could not be sur
rounded by the best influences.
From Colorado Shaeffer, the woman
and children journeyed through Mexico
and back Into California, but the detect
ive* were not able to come up to them.
Hurt had prepared the way for this long
journey of his ex-wife and Shaeffer by
a. liberal appropriation he made her at the
time the divorce was granted. When she
assured him that the children should be
well cared for, he settled on her $:0.000
and allowed her $75 a month alimony. This
alimony ceased an soon as he knew she
was married to Shaeffer, and with the
balance of the $20,000 they have been flying
through the two republics. . _. -,
The ultimate discovery of the Shaeffers
and the little Hurts came about in a
Roundabout manner. With the Wyoming
troops which came to California a few
weeks Ego were some men who had
known Shaeffer at Cheyenne. Hearing a
little and suspecting the rest, tney com
municated with nurt and San Francisco
Plnkerton agency was set to work, and
in a few days they located the family at
8 Whcn tneÂ°'case came up before Judge
Oeden this afternoon Gavin McNab stated
to the court that they were very anx
i nÂ« for a, speedy hearing of the writ, as
the petitioner had succeed in business
interest* and actual expenses not less
than $2QOjOOO._ waÃ ,nt, n t
aoDel'red to be very much excited. There
< .JSZL Annht as to whether she in en-
Urely competent mentally. She Informect
Jud/e Ogden that she had no counsel and
â¦ hat any witnesses she might have were
in Wyoming The Judge told her that n c
wi no authority over any witnesses in
Wyoming but that he would continue the
case till to-morrow so that she might en
case coun-,-1. A little later Judge Gibson
Reared and stated that he represented
the respondent. Mrs. Shaeffer He de
sired a little time to look Into the casÂ«,
and asked that It go over till to-morrow.
Attorney McNab agreed to this continu
ance if the children should be kept In the
custody of the Sheriff, because he feared
that in view of former experience Mrs.
Shaeffer would again try to take the
young ones out of the jurisdiction of the !
cc Vi r reply to a question by the court, Mrs.
Rhaeffer said that she had exhausted all
her means and that she would not take
the children away. Judge Ogden tenderly
told her that although he might believe
her the allegation that she had once
evaded a court was sworn to and that he
was bound to take cognizance of it. Sher
iff White was then required to keep the
children in the Chabot Home and to pro
duce them in court to-morrow morning.
Mr McNab authorized the court to Incur
any expense that might be necessary in
looking after the children's welfare and
safety, saying that their father would bÂ«
only too glad to pay it. â ' â¢ '. i â¢ '.
At this point the children realized that
they v.-ere to he separated from their
mother. Whatever may have been her
past Indiscretion!!, it was made very plain j
that there is a linn bon<Vof affection be
tween mother and children which la re
turned. When they commenced to cry
and place their arms around her neck she
comforted then-, by saying that wherever
they went she would go also, and that li |
she were not admitted inside she would si'
on the door step till they came out. Shaef- !
fer sat by his wife in the court room and
was very nervous. None of the children
paid the slightest attention to him o\
even acknowledged his presence, but It
moat assuredly broke their little hearts
when they realized that they must part
from their mother for one night and pos
sibly forever.
There will be a bitter legal contest to
morrow morning when the case is called.
Joel Kurt v.-.is in the Sheriff s office to-day I
waiting to be called should the case have
been tried. His attorneys are not anxious
for him to meet Shaeffer. Hurt is a de
termined looking man, about 40 years ot I
age, ar.d has been rendered desperate aÂ» j
to consequences on account of his great
regard for his children and his naturally
proud nature. j
Mrs. Shaeffcr tells a story that differs
in . many particulars from that circulated
by Hurt.
"Ever since our divorce," she said to- :
n.pht. 'Hurt has persecuted â .â â , and at
the time I left Wyoming the children
were legally in my custody in accordance
with the decree of the court.
"1 he young man he shot did not deserve
1..,, so treated. His name was Robert
.Miller., and he was but twenty-seven
years old when he was killed. He had !
been brought up for some years in our
house In Wyoming, and was a very decent '
young fellow. At the time he was shot I
he was walking along the street with |
his overcoat buttoned up and my husband
grabbed him and a minute later shot
him. My husband has stated that he i
Save me J20.000 when we separated, but '
all he gave me was a house that was j
afterward sold for $1200. I have always
treated my children right and 1 shall .
fight to the bitter end before I let him 1
have them."
Shaefftr says he is a carpenter and a
good workman, and quite able to support
his wife. He -ays Hurt is circulating ...
lot of stories that are not true, and says !
Â« â¦w oe !,- not fear anything at the hands
of the W yomtng cattle king.

RUFFIN HAD
TWO WIVES
The Divorced One Came
as a Boarder.
DISCOVERY IN SAN RAFAEL
MRS. EVA ItUFFIN ASKED FOR
AN EXPLANATION. .
She Was Told That the Guest Had
Been Her Husband's Former
Wife â They Left
Together.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. June 20.
Eva Ruffin, a handsome young woman,
who is now residing with her mother in
this city, was granted a divorce to-day
from Richard TV. RulFm. because of many
acts of his which do not become an hon
orable husband.
About a year ago a Miss Mitchell board
ed with Mr. and Mrs. Ruftin at their
home in San Rafael. The guest remained
with them throughout one summer, and
finally departed for the East. This de
parture, however, proved to be only a
ruse to throw Mrs. Ruflin off the right
track, for Miss Mitchell only went as far
as Sixteenth street and then returned.
A little later Mrs. Ruiun's suspicions
that all was not right in her husband's
conduct led her to make some inquiry,
and she discovered that on one occasion
"Richard r.uffln and wife" had registered
at a San Francisco hotel. As Mrs. Ruttin
had never been there she asked her hus
band for an explanation, and Rufiin stated
that Miss Mitchell had forced him to
write the word "wife" under threat of
exposing his duplicity.
This explanation led to another, -which
fairly astounded Mrs. Eva Ruffin. Her
husband told her that prior to his 'mar
riage with her he had been the husband
of Miss Mitchell, and that they had been
divorced. This was the first time Mrs.
Ruflin knew she had. married a man who
had previously tried matrimony and
failed.
After these discoveries Ruffin left Oak
land for Redding, telling his wife he was
going to Shasta, While at Redding he
was accompanied by the lady whom he
said was bis first wife, and who had
boarded at their San Rafael home. After
floating a few "loans" in Redding, on the
pretext of a mining scheme, he attempted
to leave the State, and was arrested and
taken back to Redding, and- since that
time nothing has been heard of him. Mrs,
Ruffin was given permission 10 resume
her maiden name of Eva Nelson.

COMMISSIONER SCOTT MAKES
AN EXPLANATION.
What Must Be Done When Merchants
Are Not Able to Procure the
Stamps Designed by
the Law.
Internal Revenue Commissioner Scott
has addressed the following telegram to
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch, in re
sponse to numerous inquiries of business
men:
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 29, 1838.
Collector Lynch, San Francisco, Cal. : Tax
payers are importuning this office to know
what they Bhall do on the morning of the first
of July, If they have not been able to procure
the adhesive stamps necessary for the trans
action of business. In repiy attention is called
to the last three lines on page 3 Â»-fl the first
three lines on pmre 9 of tho war rÂ»venue law
or 1898. which reacts :i.Â« follows: "Ar.d provided
further that in all <^oseÂ« Where the party has
not affixed thr- stamp required by law upon
any such instrument iasued, registered, sold
â¢ ,!â  transferred at a time when and at a place
where no collection district was established, it
shall be lawful for him or them, or any party
having an interest therein, to affix the proper
stamps thereto." The lanpunge, "Where no col
lection district was established," is construed
anil held to be the same as If tt read, â¢'Where
no stamp deputyship or agency was establish
ed," and where for that reason it was impos
sible to procure the stamps and where the
failure to affix them was not due to any will
ful design to defraud the United States or to
evade or delay payment thereof, the taxpayer
may In such cases be relieved by the Collector
from payment of the penalty. It is held that
the law does not require Impossible things to
be done and when for the reason above given
it was not possible to procure the stamps It is
not insisted that business shall stop and
vendors shall by reason thereof withhold goods
from the market, but that legitimate business
may be transacted and the stamps required on
goods disposed of under such circumstances
may be affixed by the owners thereof, or par
ties Interested therein, and In cases of con
sumption the retail vendor shall make sworn
return of the facts to tho Collector of Internal
Revenue, who shall assess the amount of tax
due and collect the same under the rules and
regulations provided under the law. Taxpay
ers are admonished that this urgency regula
tion does not In any way excuse them from
the duties imposed upon them by the statute
with reference to procuring stampa for all in
struments and things required to be stamped
under schedules A and B of the war revenue
law of 1898, and neglect to perform any of the
requirement* there"* except for unavoidable
reasons as above stated will render the tax
payer liable to the penalties provided therein,
and they will be str 4 *" enforced.

TO GERMANY
State Cannot Collect in
the Roth Case.
DIED IN AN INSANE ASYLUM
LEFT AN ESTATE THAT IS
PROOF AGAINST CLAIM.
Trlany Other Suits of a Similar Nature
Are Pending in Different
Courts in the
State.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
808 Broadway, June 29.
Judge Ellsworth decided a case this
morning upon which many other suits in
different parts of the State arc hanging.
In the estate of Jacob Roth deceased, the
(. -ourt declared that the Sta*te of California
could not collect its claim, as it had not
presented it within the time allowed by
law.
Roth died in an asylum four or five
years ago. He had been confined for
nearly seven years and no one knew that
ho had any estate. Some years after his
death a clerk in a German savings Insti
tution named Feehan applied for letters
of administration. They were granted
him in this county, and he Inserted the
usual notices to creditors, but no cred
itors appeared. Feehan communicated
with a sister of Roth who resides In
Germany and obtained from her a power
of attorney. Armed with this document
he applied to the court to settle and dis
tribute the estate.
When he made this application the State
Hospital authorities learned that Roth
hud .lied worth sump money, and at once
put In a claim against the estate for
(1368. The law requires that according to
the size of the estate all demands against
it other than such claims as taxes must
!'<â  mad.- in from four to ten months. In
the easi.- of lioth four months was the
limit.
Attorney Darwin C. de Golia, who ap
peared for the asylum authorities this
morning, argued that the State being a
creditor was entitled to the same priv
ileges as would be granted should the de
mand be fir taxes. Judge Ellsworth de
cided that such a condition was not ap
pll< able In this case, as Roth's transaction
with the State was in the nature of an
ordinary contract. Hip money will there
to to Germany and the State of Cali
fornia will not receive a cent for caring
lor Roth seven years.
ROUGH TIMES
ON THE ALAMEDA
STORMY SEAS ENCOUNTERED
DURING THE TRIP.
Between Honolulu and This Port a
Heavy Gale Was Run Into and
the Cargo Was Shifted.
The Australian mall steamer Alameda
n ached port last night after a very
rough passage. She was looked for early
in the morning', but she encountered head
winds from the time she left Sydney,
which accounts for the delay.
It was very rough all the way up from
Honolulu amY the stout ship rolled and
pitched terribly. Tuesday night It blew
a hurricane, and when the passengers got
up in the morning they found the vessel
with >-uch a list to starboard that prom
enadlng the decks was only possible to
the Burefooted. LMjring the night the coal
and cargo had shifted a little and cauaed,
the list.
The Alamocla got in in time, however,
to send her English mail east on the
overland train last night.
The following cabin passengers came
up on the Alameda:

Mrs. Graham, the popular stewardess
of the Alameda, was the recipient of a
number of valuable presents from pas
sengers on the down trip of the steamer.
A day or two after the passengers landed
at Sydney, N. S. W., first one and thon
another of those for whom she had made
the trip pleasant remembered her. Mrs.
Graham has been a long time on the Ala
meda and is deservedly popular.
The fact that the Alameda was to
bring up half a million in treasure was
not commented on in tho Sydney papers.
Everybody wns afraid that if the news

here and will go to the Mint to-day.

THEY BURY THE HATCHET.
The San Francisco Yacht Club Fin-
ally Rejoins the Association.
The Law Cup.
At a meeting of the Pacific Inter-Club
Yacht Association held on Monday even
ing at the Merchants' Exchange the fol
lowing wore present; Dr. C. L. Tisdale,
Commodore J. S. Hanley and H. M.
Landsberger, delegates from the Encinal
Yacht Club; E. N. Walter and R. R.
l'Hommcdieu, delegates from the Califor
nia Yacht Club; ex-Commodore Alex J.
Young and J. H. Hopps, delegates from
the Corinthian Yacht Club. Dr. C. L. Tis
dale, president of the association, took
the chair. No delegates from the Pacific,
South Bay or San Francisco Yacht Club
were present, the last named not havir.g
been members of the association for two
years. It v.'as decided to request the sec
retaries of the various clubs to send no
tice to the secretary of the association
when yachts are dropped from or taken
into membership, so that the association
records may be accurate and up-to-date.
It was also determined that every yacht
on the bay should have a number assign- i
ed to it, and that the members should be i
consecutive. A letter was read from the ]
San Franciscos to the effect that the club
had voted to re-enter the association. Af
ter some little discuaFion the secretary
of the association was directed to ask ttvÂ»
San Franciscos to appoint three dele
gates and to send a list of their members.
A handsomely bound and gilt-lettered
copy of the "yacht signal code for use in
San Francisco Bay," wrapped in a silk |
American Hag and tied -with red, white
and blue ribbon, was presented to Mr.
Allen M. Clay, formerly secretary of the
association. A page had been inserted
containing the following Inscription in il
luminated letters: "Presented to Mr. Al
len M. Clay by the members of the Pacific
Inter-Club Yacht Association in testimony
of his eminently successful labors in
bringing this volume to so excellent a de
gree of perfection." A suitably inscribed
copy of the signal code was presented to
J. H. Hopps, and another will be given to
G. B. Edgar, both of whom were also
members of the committee charged with
the preparation of the code. Messrs. Clay
and Hopps thanked the association for
the conrpllment paid to them.
The delegates to the association, of
whom there will be eighteen, will present
a trophy, to be called "The Delegates'
Cup," to be awarded as a prize In one of
the classes at the association regatta on
September 4. A silver cup, offered by
Herbert E. Law, ex-commodore of the
Pacific Yacht Club, as a prize, was ac
cepted by the association, and will be ;
I6*ted for at the association regatta, j
The "Law Cup" was originally Intended ;
to be awarded to the winner of two out j
of three races of the half-raters of the !
Pacific Yacht Club, but none of the boats
being in a fit condition to race. It has been
withdrawn.
THEATRICALS IN NEW YORK
Alf Ellinghouse Beturns From an
Extended Visit to the East
ern Metropolis.
"You see more evidences of the war In
San Francisco than do the people of New
York or any Eastern cities." said Alf
Ellinghouse last night. "There Is a
greater display of bunting In the East
and the bulletin boards attract throngs,
but few uniformed men are in evidence."
Mr. Kllinghouse returned yesterday
from a three months' visit to New York.
In that time he saw all the theatrical at
tractions and all the boxing and sport-
ing exhibitions. He pronounces "Way
Down East," a play on the lines of "Shore
Acres." the hit of the season. The prin
cipal role is taken by Phoebe Davies. The
play was written by Mrs. Harry Dale
I Parker and J. R. Gnsmer.
Mr. Ellinghouse will be associated with
M. B. Leavitt In the management of the
new Bush Street Theater, which will be
known as the Comedy Theater. The
house will be furnished in ivory and gold,
with new stage scenery and fittings.
Boxing has not proved attractive In
New York. Sporting men discuss the
bouts, but do not attend them. George
j Dixon Is pronounced much improved over
I his California form. Dusky Joe Walc*tt
|Is enjoying life at the Springs. Nego
i tiations are pending for a match between
him and Tommy Ryan.
McCoy, Mr. Ellinghouse says, Is
wonderfully clever, especially in his
footwork. He is about Sharkey's
! height, but not so heavily mus
j cled. He Is a hard puncher and
| would make a good match with Choyn
i ski. The receipts of the McCoy-Ruhlin
i light were but $4100. It Is estimated they
would draw 120,000 here.
Horse racing it attracting immense
crowds and betting is heavy.
Among the sporting attractions to be
seen here will be Yousouf. the Turk, noted
as a wrestler, and an aggregation of bi
cycle riders. The latter will be here In
November and will include Michael, Bald,
Fred Titus, "Major" Taylor, Taylore, the
Frenchman, and others.
SHOULD USE SALT WATER
Local Merchants Want It for Sprink
ling the City's Streets.
At a meeting of the Merchants' Associa
tion yesterday the subject of sprinkling
the streets with salt water was discussed
at length, and as Professor Price, the
chemist, had presented a report upon the
I'fTects of water from the ocean upon
pavements and upon the general health
of the community it was decided to urge
upon the Board of Supervisors to sprinklo
the streets with salt water instead or
fresh. The reasons for making this re
commendation are set forth in the follow
ing communication to the Board of Su
pervisors:
To the Street Committee of the Honorable
Roard of Supervisors â Gentlemen: Herewith we
beg to sumtt for your consideration a report
carefully prepared hy Messrs. Thomas Price &
Son upon the effects of fresh and salt water on
bituminous pavements, and the respective value
of each for street sprinkling purposes. The fol
lowing conclusions may be summarized from
this report:
Firstâ Water has no harmful effect upon
bituminous rock pavement that Is properly pre
pared and well laid.
Secondâ There Is no substantial difference In
the effect of fresh or salt water upon any
bituminous pavement.
Thirdâ Water has an injurious effect upon
bituminous pavements where the bituminous
rock Is not well mlxpd or the pavement Is not
subjected to sufficient pressure.
Fourth â In a fanitnry point of view fresh
water Is inferior to salt water for street sprink
ling.
Fifthâ Salt water Is more economical than
fresh water, as less sprinkling will be required.
Sixthâ The use of salt water for street
sprinkling will not result In Injury to clothing
or merchandise In stores.
In view of the foregoing conclusions we would
respectfully recommend to your honorable board
that salt water be used In sprinkling the public
streets of the city.
Hoping that these recommendation!; will hava
your early consideration, we remain, very
truly yours,

THE BIG RAFT
IS ALL RIGHT
Carrier Pigeon Brought
a Message From It.
WILL ARRIVE ON SATURDAY
STEAMER OREGON COLLIDES
WITH CENTENNIAL.
Much Dissatisfaction Among the Pas
sengers of the Dirigo Over the
Long Delay in Getting the
Steamer Away.
Thd big raft which left the Columbia
River on the 24th lnst. Is slowly making
.y down the coast. Wlien two days
out it was sighted by ;je steamer Ore
gon about twenty miles northeast of Ya
quina Head, comng along at tho rate of
about two miles an hour. The barkentine
tier City, which arrived yesterday
from Grays Harbor, brought in a carrier
which had been released from one
of the tuga having the raft In tow. The
bird was evidently Intended to return to
i with a message to the owners of
raft, but "-nt lost and settled on the
yard arm of the barkentine.
Captain Palmgren of the Gardiner City
said yesterday: "On tho 26th lnst, at 8
p. m., in latitude 43 deg. 54 mln. north,
longitude 126 deg. 37 mln. west, a pigeon
v board. It had a ring on its leg
marked "R V a SB" and a paper under
its wing containing the following writing:
June 26, 8 a. m.-110 miles south of Columbia
River; 26 miles off shore: speed 3 miles: north
east wind; quite a sea running ; raft riding like
a duck; everything <> X Raft wl I surely ar
rive all right. 1 am having a hell of a time.
Kick all the time. INMAN.
'The Gardiner City was about fifty
seven miles off Cape Perpetua, so the
pigeon In twelve hours must have flown
about sixty-three miles in a south south
easterly direction. As the bird was very
tired the chances are that it covered four
times that distance while it was on the
W The raft contains 5,250,000 feet of lumber
and is in tow of the tugs Rescue and
Monarch. According to the message
brought by the pigeon it is only making
three knots an hour, so it wi.l probably
be Saturday before it arrives here.
The British ship Swanhilda arrived
from Newcastle. N. S. W., yesterday,
after a passage of seventy-one days. She
has beaten the American bark Genera
Fairchild now out seventy-three days;
British ship Eulomene. eighty-two days,
and Ardencraig, eighty-five days, and the
"ark Gladys, ninety-eight days. Captain
leaser and ship did not attract as much
attnetion on this occasion as they did on
their arrival a year ago. That time Mur
derer Butler was one of her crew, and
policemen and newspaper men were out
in dozens and aboard the vessel long be
fore the anchor was dropped. Since then
Butler has paid the penalty of his crimes,
"hie the Swanhilda has been over to
England with wheat, to Australia with a
general cargo, and back here again with
a cargo of coal. After discharging she
will again load wheat for Europe.
The new coasting steamer Newburg was
launched from the Fulton Iron orks
last Tuesday night, and was taken to
Mission-street wharf yesterday to be fitted
out. She is called after the sawmill of
that name in Humboldt County, and is
15$ feet long, 34 feet beam and 12 feet 6
inches deep. She will carry about 450.
000 feet of lumber. Captain L. Hansen
will command her. and Tom Houston will
be the chief engineer. S wlck. also built
The new steamer Brunswick, also built
for the coasting trade, was out pn her
trial trip yesterday and proved herself to
be a fast and comfortable boat. Before
going into the lumber trade the Bruns
wick! Will make a couple of trips to St.
Michael with gold hunters. In order to
fit her for that purpose her cabin has
been built up and accommodation pro
vided for over a hundred passengers.
The lighthouse launch Hazel came to
grief yesterday. As she was starting for
Goat Island about 2 p. m. her steam whis
tle broke and the little craft kept up a
continuous screech until the steam in the
boiler was exhausted. It took several
hours to repair damages and get the Ha
zel ready to proceed on her way to the
lighthouse station.
One of Max topper's mall wagons ran
amuck on the water front yesterday.
Max's contract expires on the Ist of the
month and the horse, thinking it would be
out of a job, did its best to commit sui
cide... It started on a wild run for thÂ«
ferries and getting among the posts that
are placed in rows to protect passengers
tore two of them down and continued on
its way. People scattered In all direc
tions and the screaming and shouting only
added fresh zest to the horse's exertions.
It turned in on one of the ferry slips just
as the steamer Garden City was coming
and in a frantic effort to stop the horsÂ«
went down and the wagon turned over on
its side. Neither horse nor vehicle will be
used again on the water front for some
time to come. ;â 
After many delays which have caused st
great deal of hard feeling among the pas
sengers, the steam* Dirigo will at last
get away to-day. For over a week the
gold hunters who are going north on her
have been camping on the wharf await
ing her sailing, but they were put oft
from day to day until patience ceased to
be a virtue and all kinds of profanity
broke forth. Captain Hall answered ques
tions until he got tired and then went up
town for a rest. The whole trouble has
been over the river steamer City of Daw
son which the Dirigo was to tow to St.
Michael. The vessel Is claimed by Birch
& Co., the builders, while the people for
whom she was built say they nave paid
all they owe on the craft. Should the
matter not drift into the courts the Dirigo
will start at 5 p. m. to-day with the
steamer Alviso in tow.
The barkentine Tropic Bird arrived from
Tahiti yesterday with three passengers.
She is 44 days from Papeete and Captain
Jackson says It is the longest passage .but
one he has ever made in the vessel. It
was due to light winds and calms. When
the Tropic Bird was in Papeete the news
arrived there that Spain had sued for
peace and the war was over. The vessel
is supposed to sail on July 1 with the
French mail for Tahiti, but it will prob
ably be the sth or 6th before she gets
away.
Owing to the falling off in the Alaska
trade the Alaska-Yukon Transportation
Company has no use for the steamer Ex
celsior. The vessel has accordingly been
returned to the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company and will be placed on the mail
route between Unalaska and Sitka.
The steamer Oregon, while trying to
dock at Folsom street wharf yesterday,
was caught by wind and tide and ran Into
the Steamer Centennial. The latter was
not very much damaged, but the Oregon
sprung one of the plates below the main
deck and will have to undergo repairs be
fore she can sail again.

HONORS TOR JOHN ELLIOTT.
Made a Delegate at Large on the
Board of Governors, Amateur
Athletic Union.
John Elliott, long recognized as the au
thority on amateur athletic sport on this
coast, has been highly honored by Presi
dent Harry McMillan of tho Amateur
Athletic Association. Mr. Elliott has been
appointed a. delegate at large on the board
of governors of the great association gov
erning athletes In this country. The im
portance of tho position may bo gathered
from the fact that there are but five of
these delegates. They are headed by W.
B. Curtis, the father of American ath
letics.
The delegates pass xipon all matters per
taining to the good of athletic sports. As
their title implies, they represent all the
country and not one section. It is tho
first time such an appointment has ever
come to this coast. The men interested
in the sports of the field and path are
glad that it came to so worthy and capa
ble a man as Mr. Elliott.

FAVORITES TO
THE FRONT
Some Hot Skirmishesfor
Place Money.
REX ALTO DOWNS PRIMROSE
GRIFFITH SERVES UP ANOTHER
SENSATIONAL TROTTER.
Charles David, With Everybody
Aboard, Wins a Queer-Look
ing Pacing
v Race. /
Favorites were In evidence at Oakland
j-esterda'y and the racing on the wholo
was rather tame. Several pretty fights
for place and show money, however,
served to keep alive the spark of interest.
Little Miss, even money and 3 to 2,
cleverly won the 2:22 trot, well driven by
Webster, who rigs her out with a screen
over the eyes to steady her, as with it
I she does not see shadows and other
troublesome sights en route for the
money. Dr. J. put up quite an argument
to the distance flag, but, tiring badly,
broke, and lost all chances of victory.
Ned Thorn, by a well-timed brush, got
the place. It was a fairly fast heatâ
2:l7VÂ£. Diamont showed speed but was
very unsteady. The winner Is by Sid
moor and a slick-gaited little trotter.
For the 2:26 pace Primrose, one of the
unlucky ones on Tuesday, was the favor
ite at 6 to 5, but was not over her ner
vousness, and broke at tho very spot
where Tuesday's accident occurred.
Thompson tried, but show money was all
the pretty daughter of Falrose could take
down. Dictatress, the three-year-old Die
tatus filly which won so nicely her last
out, was beaten in a stretch drive by
Walter Maben's Rex Alto, driven by Jim
my Sullivan. The heat was 2:18^ and
shows that pacers are uncertain things,
as Resort and Roderick, each capable of
miles well below 2:20, were away back in
the dust, disappointing their constitu
ents badly. Rex Alto'B price was 4 to 1.
Field bettors got good value, as it was
Primrose $10. field $12, and It looked like
a rattling field end.
The special race for trotters and pacers
belonging to members of the Golden Gate
Driving Club went to Butcher Boy, driv- j
en by Mizner, after quite a rattle with !
Ashton. Chloe and Bishop Hero were j
never in evidence toward the end. al- ;
though the mare led away fast and kept \
them at bay to the far turn In the open- ;
ing heat. But in the other it was mere- i
ly Butcher Boy all the way. The heats
were 2:lBVs and 2:2OVj. Poor old Hero was
Just able to hobble inside the distance,
and Is not fit to contest with sound
horses of 2:20 caliber, more's the pity. |
Butcher Boy was 9 to 5 and 3 to 5 prior â 
to each hoat, respectively. Ashton was
6 to 5 at one time, but went to 8 to 5 after
the opening heat. The scoring was a lit
tle tiresome, but Havey let them to the
wire but few times, keeping them from
going the usual route to the furlong post.
Jib Albert, a half brother to Flying Jib,
2:04, sired by Albert W, took the 2:27 trot
ters into camp handsomely, never vary
ing his machinelike stride, and the time,
2:17*4. is not a marker as to his capacity,
for he can surely beat 2:15. He is one of !
the veteran Salisbury's discoveries, and
belongs to C. L. Griffith. Webster teamed !
him so as to get the money the easiest way j
and not the record. He has a strong sta- I
ble of splendidly gaited horses, and seems |
bound to get a goodly share of the money.
Jib's price was 7 to 10. Lou, a t> to 1
shot, was the only contestant of moment,
but breaks ruined the prospects of a close
finish.
The special 2:40 pace went to the bay
gelding Charles David, a "cinchy" favor
ite apparently, at 3 to 5. He won It with
out the semblance of a struggle, in
2:2OVi. and every one on the grouds seemed
aboard. Peanuts was driven in about
plxth-horse place the entire mile,
though the field was a small one.
Some others seemed satisfied to wait
till the last end of It ere they got their
pacing shoes on. It was a good betting
event, but not a good looking
race by any means. Polo, the other
runaway of Tuesday, was driven by Far
rar, and at 5 to 2 was played somewhat.
He did well to beat the fence, as he was |
too unsteady to be a factor. In the auc- ]
tlons the winner was at $10 to the field !
$12.

tha "Wilkes, 2:08 (ex-champlon race rec
ord); Allandorf, 2:l9Vi. and other celebri
ties, Is here on a visit from Boston, and
sat In the grand stand, an Interested
spectator, because of the novelty of the
dash system of harness racing. He was
loud in his praises of the Oakland track
and grounds, and apparently much Inter
ested In the day's events, even though
the time made was not up to grand cir

CURTIS TALKS
OF BENEFITS
What the Railroad Has
Done for California.
ENCOURAGED MANUFACTURE
CAR WHEELS AND TIMBER ARE
OBTAINED HERE.
Average Rate of Wages of Employes
Greater in California Than Else
where in the "United
.;â¢ States.
Engineer Curtis was on the stand In
United States Commissioner Heacock's
chambers for nearly two hours yesterday
afternoon testifying in answer to ques
tions propounded by William F. Herrin
and E. S. Plllsbury, attorneys for the
Southern Pacific Company. Shortly be
fore 4 o'clock the direct examination was
concluded and It was announced by Dep
uty Attorney General Carter that he
would begin a. lengthy cross-examination
of Mr. Curtis this afternoon, beginning
at 2 o'clock.
"State in a general way," asked Mr.
Herrin, "the benefit accruing to the busi
ness of the State of California by the op
eration of these overland lines."
"The lines lie out of the region which
produces any timber," replied Mr. Curtis,
"and but little if anything of the mate
rial and supplies required for the opera
tion and maintenance of the track. In thia
condition it results that all the materials
required for the maintenance of the line,
bridges, culverts, vessels, etc., are large
ly shipped out from California. The ties,
for instance, come almost exclusively
from the redwood region and from the
timber belt in the northern part of the
State. The material for the maintenance
of the cars and locomotives is largely
produced in California and the repairs
are made in the company's shops in Cali
fornia. The effect of this has been to in
crease tho trade in timber in this State,
to employ many men in the shops in re
pairs and in the making of carwheels,
and tho money received by these men is
disbursed by them in this State or put
into the savings banks of this State to a
very large extent. The money paid to the
lumber and supply men rinds its way into
the channels of trade here. All that is
required for the maintenance of the lineâ
the woodwork and the manufacture of
large quantities of material for the lino
from the eastern boundary of the State
to the eastern terminus of the lino is pro
cured in California.
"With reference to the maintenance of
the line from Yuma to El Paso, with the
exception of some timber for the main
tenance of the culverts, I would say of
this line exactly what I would have said
of the Central Pacific. All its material
Is purchased from producers and dealers
in California or is manufactured In the
shops here."
The witness then read from a memor
andum the average daily compensation
of railway employes in the eastern por
tion of the United Statesâ oast of tho
Mississippi and Missouri rivers. In the
East the average compensation is fl 77
per day. On the Pacific Coast it is $2 54
per day. For the year ending June 30,
1897, the average daily rate of wages on
tho Pacific system was $2 80. If tho South
ern Pacific Company had paid its em
ployes at the Eastern rate of wages the
company would have saved tf.W.OOO. The
average in California is a little higher
than that paid on tho Pacific system.
A Big Doctor Bill.
Dr. Clarence F. Dickenson filed suit
against the Alaska Commercial Company
to recover $5000 for medical services ren
dered. The plaintiff alleges that in April,
May June and July. 1895, his services
were called in requisition by the defend
ant corporation to treat and care for the
officers and crew of the schooner C G.
White, which was shipwrecked at Kodlak
Island.

Had a Horse and Buggy in Waiting
In Which to Carry Off
the Stolen Prop
erty.
Lieutenant Anderson and Police Officer
Clancy of the Potrero station, and De
tective Tom Ryan last night arrested seven
â well-known crooks who have been oper
ating: in South San Francisco. Their
names are: John Sullivan, alias Murphy;
Frank Donnelly, Joe Hodge, Xeil and
John Bonner, James Murray and Frank
Burke. All are well known to the police,
Donnelly having served two terms in San
Quentin for robbery and burglary.
Late yesterday afternoon Lieutenant
Anderson learned that the gang had
broken into Pacific Rolling Mills at the
Potrero, and got away with a brass jour
nal worth about $100. After securing the
Journal the bold thieves carried it to a
boat whicli they had in waiting and rowed
to a point near the Arctic Oil Works,
where another of the gang was waiting
with a horse and buggy. After disem
barking they placed the journal in the
buggy and drove to this city, where the
stolen brass was disposed of for $S. Con
vinced that they would return to the roll
ing mills, Lieutenant Anderson stationed
Clancy at a point where he could com
mand a view of the place. A short time
afterward two of the gang rowed up to
the mills, evidently intending to make
another raid. Catching a glimpse of the
policeman the men pulled out in the
Btream and awaited developments.
Clancy, who was in citizen's clothes,
shouted to them that he wanted to board
a ship which was lying- in the stream,
and offered to pay them handsomely if
they would row him to the vessel. Evi
dently thinking he was a sailor, who was
anxious to get aboard of his ship, the two
thieves promptly accepted his offer. As
they roWed over to him Clancy jumped
into the boat, and showing his star placed
them under arrest. They were taken to
the Potrero station, and Detective Ryan
was sent for. After being put through
the "sweating" process tho prisoners
broke down and told the names of their
companions. After considerable trouble
the officers subsequently arrested the
rest of the gang and took them to the
City Prison, where they were charged
with grand larceny. The "horse and buggy
which they used in carrying off their
booty was found tied to a tree a short
distance from the rolling mills.
A Good Investment.
A saving of two tons of coal per day
Is effected in the power house of the
Claus Spreckels building by the use of
the Barnard-Wheeler Cooling Tower,
which enables the engine plant to be
operated condensing. It is a popular
belief that an engine must be located
close to an abundant and cheap supply
of salt or fresh water to secure the
economical advantage of condensing
the exhaust steam from the engines.
While the cooling tower system has
been extensively used in the East, Mr.
Bpreckels was the first to apply a mod
ern tower in a modern power plant on
this coast, and the results have been so
economical that the owners of- the pow
er plant in the Parrott building are
now installing two large Barnard-
Wheeler towers, which should result in
a material coal saving.
The cooling tower is simple in con
struction, small and compact. The
cooling of the circulating water from
the condensers is effected by distribut
ing the water over galvanized wire
mats suspended vertically in a sheet
Iron tower, between which mats a cur
rent of air is forced and the water thus
cooled is returned to the condensers,
when the alternate operation of heating
and cooling is repeated.

neering Company, New York.

BABYiFACE
And Neck Looked Like Raw Meat.
Mother and Child Had No Rest
Day or Night from Itching.
Blood Would Flow Down Cheeks.
Doctors and Dispensary No
Use. Awful Suffering.
Cured byCUTICURA REMEDIES
Now Entirely Healed With
Lovely Clear Skin.
Our baby, when one month old, had a raw
place on her neck which 6j>read slowly over
the â¢whole face, the face and neck being all
raw meat, sometimes dry and then wet, and
something awful to look .it. The way the
child suffered, mother and child never had
any rest day or night as it constantly itched,
and the blood used to flow down her cheeks.
We had doctors and went to the dispensary
without any result. By using part of a bottlo
of Ccticttba Resoli vent, throe boxes of Cuti-
OUBA (ointment), and Cithxra Soap, the
child teas entirely healed. Now she is two years
old and has a lovely skin, which we can be
thankful to Cirncc ha Remedies and nothing
ilse. Mrs. EMIL r. GABKJOSS,

BROTHER FRANCIS AND HIS FAITH CURE.
He Renders Unto God the Things That Are God's and Unto
Francis the Things That Are Francis',
COME!" said a man by the door,
"I've heard enough. It's blas
phemy."
He dragged a woman away with
him, pulling her roughly by the
arm. She looked back over her
shoulder. Her eyes were very
bright and wide. She was smiling.
Sht suffered herself to be dragged
along on stumbling feet, neither re
sisting nor a .eding.
The crowd closed in where these
two had stood. It blocked the door
and covered the board run from
the tent to the sidewalk. Within
was space neither to sit nor to
stand. It was necessary to thread
a passage slowly from the street
by dint of warm persistence and
the aid of fellow man. It is not by
the aid of fellow woman that one
gets anywhere in a crowd. Even
when concert d action is necessary
to reach a given point, woman op
poses woman with her elbow where
soever the sex meets in mass. This
few gathered together in a gospel
tent of Oakland to praise the God
of Gods and do honor to His
prophet Francis, fought furiously
among themselves for place as wo
men tight everywhere for place, on
the grand stand, on the street cor
ner, at the theater, in the criminal
courts.
"if you please, there is a sick wo
man here. Would you let her get
to the front?"
No, they wouldn't. They had as
much right to their i laces as any
body. All the sick were told to
come early and take seats near
the platform. Why didn't she come
early?
"She had to come fro-i the city
and she couldn't come any sooner."
Well, they couldn't help that.
She'd have to wait now. People
couldn't be crowded to death.
The man who had the- sick woman
in charge threw one arm around her
and put tiie other straight out be
fore him. SI. ulders divided against
themselves, warring elbows and
knees opposed came together to
form a wall of defense against a
common foe. The woman was
crushed against the man's breast.
"Don't, Charlie," she said, faintly.
"I'd rather wait! I'd rather go
home!"
"Move, can't you?" said the man
sharply. "My wife is fainting."
Those behind him fell back a little
and let him pass them again on his
way to the air. Those in front
settled grimly to their internecine
strife.
Around the wooden walls of tho
tr-nt men and women stood stiffly,
their faces turned in one direction,
with an odd air of arrested life like
the figures oi. a processional frieze.
The heads of persons standing out
side the tent were soen through the
lowered tran windows with the
flickering light upon their faces,
like strange, unreal, bodiless things
of the night. The floor of the tent
was covered. The seated struggled
for space in which to fan them
selves with papers and pocket
handkerchiefs. The standing had
no space to struggle for. The traps,
blocked like the entrance from
without, admitted little air. The
greedy lights burning overhead con
sumed it fast. The odor in the tent
was not alone of sanctity. The
character of the audience was of a
certain well-fed, well-dr 3sed, well
conditioned lameness. The women
wore good hats and bright silk
waists and gowns of summery
stuffs. The men were coated and
trousered respectably. These were
not God's poor. Among them was a
few of that class which holds long,
oiled locks, the sparse, virginal
beard and a humble unclcanliness
of person especially pleasing in the
sight of heaven â but only a few.
The rest mi^ht have been the con
gregation of any Methodi3t or Bap-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 30, 1898.
BY ALICE RIX.
tls' church, prosperous, unfashion
able, decorously fond of the world,
able to pay its pastor a good salary
and take up a gratifying collection
twice every Sabbath. Among the
women were many young girls.
Among the men were many gray
beards. Among both were negroes
of the lighter color and the better
class. Over them all had fallen the
religious exaltation which takes no
heed of spoken words, but wings
after the speaker's voice to heaven's
gate and sees and feels the glory
waiting there.
"You sheep of Christ you've all
grot the foot rot, or you'd run in the
ways of your Shepherd!"
"Yes! Yes! Amen!" shouted a
woman on the platform.
"Glory be to God!" sobbed a wo
man on the floor.
"He sees your sloth! You think
you can pull the wool over His eyes,
but He's, too smart for you "
It was here that the man by the
door shut his ears to blasphemy and
fled with the woman who belonged
to him â and who would have lin
geredâinto the night. Those who
remained had no such impious or
unjust thought. Nor had he who
spoke in colloquial terms of inti
mate familiarity of his Master. He
rose to the cheap words with the
voice of one inspired, with the man
ner of a prophet of the Lord God
of Israel. Those who heard him
sobbed and shouted as a multitude
moved by the mighty accents of
heaven.
"Does my Master fear to go into
the dark ways? He would go into
the depths of Hell and take His
light there! I would go after Him.
I would go as far as the gates of
Hell with Him. And if the old devil
came after me and said 'Here! This
is my territory,' I'd say 'No it isn't!
It's my Master's territory and you
get out of here, you old fool!' "
"That's it!" shrieked a woman In
the audience. "That's the way to
talk to him! That'll teach him!
Praise God!"
She thought It was. She thought
It was divine eloquence. It was
the sort, at least, that she under
stood.
As for the brother Francis, he
has understanding of a better sort
of eloquence, and can use it when
he likes. He is a man of middle
years and height, of gray hair and
b.ard, of fleshly face and hands, of
unascetic, unecclesiastic presence.
If he is fed by the ravens, the
heaven-sent birds do not forget
their charge. He has the full eye,
the full lips, the long, fat cheek of
the sensualistâ and heaven for
fend injustice!â there are sensual
ists of the spirit as well as of the
flesh. His manner is warm, his
voice lush, his gesture florid, his
action melodramatic. "Words pour
from him a heavy stream, like
water from a pump. Simile waits
on him, metaphor is ready to his
need, speech is his servant; he is
a speaker born. But the speaker
Is not always the thinker, words
are not always vehicles of thought.
They often pass in glittering or
gloomy parade, like the coaches of
royalty or the carriages of mourn
ing, and carry nothing at all inside.
And so they pass out at the lips of
the brother Francis and bring no
new message to the world. His
moods rise on them to spiritual del
icacy, sink to common depths,
touching no new territory at either
pole. He is picturesque, vivid,
touching, shocking and magnetic,
with the strange animal magnetism
that can take nerves into control
beneath its grasp and stimulate
them to sudden half-forgotten ac
tion that may or may not en
dure, according to the Individual
mind, which has almost as much as
faith healers claim for the soul to
do with the health and soundness of
the body. Fnr this great gift and
that other commoner gift of gab
the brother Francis thanks God
piously, publicly and I doubt me
not sincerely, calling both the di
vine healing power of Christ work
ing in himself a humble follower
of the Lamb. He renders to God
the things which are God's, but he
renders to Francis the things which
are Francis' â and even some things
which are not his.
At the close of his address the
voices of the faithful -were raised
in prayer. They prayed singlyâ
a man in vigorous, masterful voice,
commanding his God to go about
His business here on earth and
pointing it out to Him in fine par
ticularâ"Lord! Send Thy spirit
down into our midst! Convert the
sinner, God! Turn the evil man
from his ways" â a woman whin
ing, nagging at her Lord for favors,
bribing Him with promises of praise
and glory here belowâ "Oh,
Lo-o-o-rd! "We be-se-e-e-ch Thee,
do not forget Thy people, and they
will sing pra-ai-ses to Thee for
ever!"
And forthwith praises were sung
and the name of God glorified in
the gospel tent. And, as is the
emotional manner of the gospel
tenters, prayers and psalms alike
â¢were punctuated with wild cries of
Glory! Glory! and Hallelujah! and
Praise God! and Yes! yes! and
Amen!
The sick who came to be healed
were seated in the first rows be
neath the speaker's stand. Their
names and symptoms were sent up
before them and loudly read that
all might hear. Then they formed
In sad procession and waited for
the laying on of hands.
The methods of the brother Fran
da are simple â similar in almost
every case, untheatric and, accord
ing to the testimony of many of
those who came beneath his heal
ing touch, effective.
"Where is your trouble. Sister?"
"In the eyes. I have pains in the
eyes."
"She has terrible pains In the
eyes." announces the brother Fran
cis over his shoulder. "You can't
see anything, can you?"
"Oh, yes, sir. I can see a little."
"She can scarcely see â you can't
see to read, of course? Can't see to
read at all, can you?"
"Well, I can't see â "
"She can't see at all," shouts the
brother Francis. "How long is it
since you have read a book?"
"Well, sir, for about six years I
haven't read â " '
"Hasn't been able to read a book
for six years!"
"Without glasses, sir."
"Yes. yes, very powerful glasses,
of course. She hasn't been able tJ
read for years without the assur
ance of very powerful magnifying
glasses! Here, dear Sister, let me
place my hand on your eyes! Dear
Lord! Thou who made these ryes
restore to them the sight! Then*,
now, look at this! Can you see this
line? Can you read this? Holy
Bible! That's right. Hasn't been
able to read a word for six y^ars!
She now reads at sight a line held
before her eyes! Brother, did you
take the name and address?"
And as it is with the blind, so
it is with the deaf.
"You're deaf, you say, Brother?
Which ear is worse? The right ear?
That means when you close the left
ear you do not hear anything -
you're totally deaf? This man
(loudly) is almost totally duaf.
Brother, let me place my hands on
your ears. Dear Jesus! if it be Thy
will restore the hearing to these
ears."
And the brother Francis removes
his hands and approaches his lips to
the ears and in a whisper sharp as a
sword he hisses â "Can you hear
what I say?"
."Yes, sir."
"Totally deaf forâ how many
years? â forty? â totally deaf for
forty years. Can now hear a whis
per. Brother, did you take this
name and address?"
And be sure that the pood believ
ing Brother has taken it! Be sure
that it is read aloud and heard by
the faithful! Be sure that when
the unimaginative, the unemotional,
the unresponsive, the difficult sub
jects come up they are dismissed
quietly without this formality and
chided for want of faith and urged
to go home and into their closets
and down on their knees, to ask
grace and the faith that, had it
been theirs, would certainly have
made them whole! And be sure that
of those who go to the gospel tent to
be healed by th<> laying on of hands
of the brother Francis, the groater
number have that faith eternal in
their hearts and, in the spiritual ex
altation of it, under his thrilling
touch which darts like a flame into
their nerves, under his forceful ani
mal magnetism which sends the slug
gish current of their blood flowing
In great waves to their hearts, in
the presence of his swaying will to
which their lesser wills make glad
obeisance, they see, they hear, they
walk, they run, they jump, they do
whatever he bids them do and call
down God's blessing on his name.
With the crippled, the paralyzed
and the totally blind the Lord, even
with the assistance of the brother
Francis, needs more time to make
a perfect cure. There is no reason
given. The unbelieving are not told
why God who works miracles
should not do so at His pleasure.
The serious cases are sent away
comforted with promises. It is "Sis
ter! I will see you to-morrow. Pray
for help." And "Come again, Broth
er, It is not the Lord's wish that
you be healed to-night. Pra to
Him."
Yet even one of these incurables
and believers may be tortured into
illustrating the faith healer's
powerâ
"Dear child, dear little brother
in Christ, what' is your trouble?
The hip? You do not walk at all?
Only with canes! Give me your
canes, dear child of God! Trust in
Jesus Christ. Oh, Lord! May this
child walk!"
They say that the prayers of the
faithful are answered. In the con
gregation an old man prays with
uplifted hands and head bowed
upon his breast. His voice is heard
even above the sonorous, drowning,
praying voice of the brother Fran
cis â "Dear Master! help this boy
for his mother's sake!"
"Walk!" commands the brother
Francis.
The chi.d lcolcs for his canes,
the friends who have helped him
all through his little painful life.
They are held from him. He looks
for his father â for the arms which
have carried him.
"Try, son! Try in Christ's
name!"
The boy moves one, two, racking
steps. His face whitens. The.broth
er Francis hands him the canes.
"Praise be to God!" he says. "The
boy walks." ALICE RIX.
SCHOOL MONET
BEING WASTED
Director Gallagher Is
Incensed.
USELESS WORK GOING ON
FILED A DETAILED BEPOBT
WITH THE BOARD.
The Graduates of the Normal School
Have ' Been Granted Grammar
School Certificates â Notes
of the Session.
School Director E. J. Gallagher, chair
man of the finance committee, believes
that the money In the school fund is be
ing wast< d and frittered away. He in
tends putting a stop to useless and unnec
essary expenditures if that Is possible ol
attainment and yesterday presented the
following report at the weekly meeting of
the board:
The first matter to which I would call your
attention Is the fact that during the past week
or so the Building and Supply Committee has
put to work a very large number of men. The
total number, I believe, on both committees
exceeds sixty men. This" will mean an ex
penditure of at least JSGOO a month. I believe
that during the vacation period the Supply
Committee can find plenty of work and will
need at least thirty men. The Building Com
mittee, in my opinion, can get along with a
smaller number until such time as the board
determines whether or not the money should
be frittered away in repairs or devoted to
permanent and needed improvements, and then
whether thes*; improvements should be made
by contract or day's labor. I think the board
should determine Just how many men each
committee should employ and then that the
men should be appointed by the board, each
member appointing an equal number.
I would also call your attention to some of
the work being done by the Building Commit
tee. Very extensive repairs are being made
at the Winfleld Scott School. While repairs at
thla school were necessary, such extensive al
terations as the committee are making are in
our present financial condition entirely uncall
ed for. The school itself Is not under any
circumstances worth repairing. It is too old
and dilapidated a-M will soon be if it is not
already too small for the neighborhood. The
work being done on this school will cost, from
what I could judge, considerably more than
J4OOO, and the work Is of sufficient Importance
to have been submitted to this board for ac
tion.
Another school la the Polytechnic High.
There Is an exchange of rooms belngr made
here at the suggestion of the teachers which
is an exceedingly pood move, as It will greatly
facilitate the movement and work of the
classes in the department affected. The com
mittee Is also making two new rooms In the
hallway of the upper Btory of the school.
This work, I believe, is 111 advised and en
tirely uncalled for. The rooms will make ex
cellent death traps in case of fire. For all
practical purposes they are too small, and with
their immense skylights they will certainly be
the most expensive rooms in the department.
I visited the Agassiz School. Here the com
mittee is adding a new room. This work is
positively and unquestionably uncalled for.
The Halght School, in the immediate neighbor
hood, has ruom to spare and extra pupils
should bo sent there.
In the report made by Inspector O'Brien
about a month or so ago he does not recom
mend the adding of rooms to either of the
above mentioned schools. I visited the Stan
ford School, too, as I heard that extensive re
pairs were contemplated there. I have in this
Instance been able to delay matters until the
urgency of the alterations can be determined.
I noticed one thing about this school that did
not commend Itself to me. It seems some one
has cut out two immense squares in the yaws.
In one of them a garden is now flourishing,
the other is being prepared for a garden. This
whole thing seemed to me to be a very great
shame. It seemed as though the committee
was catering to the whim of some very selfish
persons, for while gardens are nice things and
very much appreciated by some, it did not
seem as though much thought was given to the
comfort t and welfare of hundreds of little tots
when the best and 6unniest portion of their
playground had to be taken and they must be
forced to occupy the cold, sunless portion of
the yard In the immediate vicinity of the lava
tories.
This is all I have to call attention to at this
time, but it strikes mo that it Is enough to
show you the character of the work being
done by the Building Committee. If you ap
prove of this work, then I am satisfied, as I
feel that in calling your attention to the mat
ter I have done my duty.
The present is the time to place a check upon
the indiscriminate spending of money. As
chairman of your Finance Committee I will try
to do my duty, and I do not propose in future
that my first acquaintance with matters having
to do with the expenditure of funds will be
when bills are presented for my approval.
E. J. GALLAGHER.
"I move that the board g-o into execu
tive session to discuss the financial condi
tion of the department," said Gallagher
at the conclusion of the reading of the
report.
Several of the directors objected to an
executive meeting. They contended that
as the only business that could be con
sidered would be of a public nature there
was no need for star chamber proceed
ings. The motion to hold an executive
session prevailed, but no business was
transacted, it being the sense of the ma
jority of the members that a special meet
ing be held next Tuesday afternoon to
discuss the matter.
The old schedule of salaries for teach
ers and principals was next adopted with
a few minor changes.
The use of the school lot on Bush street,
between Hyde and Larkin streets, former
ly occupied by the Girls' High School, was
granted the California Club for the pur
pose of establishing a public play ground
for school children.
The board, at the request of over one
thousand property owners, decided to re
commend that the half block of land on
the north side of Sacramento street ana
Gough and Octavia streets be set aside
and designated as a school site for the
use of the Lowell High School and that
the sum of $200,000 be placed in the next
tax levy for the construction of a sub
stantial and commodious brick building.
Principal Babcock of the Franklin
Evening School was voted an increase
of $20 a month salary.
A communication from Dr. Gallway,
Health Officer, was received calling at
tention to the unsanitary condition of the
branch Richmond School, branch Sutro
School and the Park Primary School, and
that he had been directed to take action
in the matter unless the School Board
abated the nuisance.
The board granted High School certi
ficates to Miss Evelyn D. Armer. Arthur
J. Dannenbaum, Maurice L. Euphrat,
Miss Elizabeth G. Fink, John J. Galla
gher, Alexander McCulloch and Miss
Maud McKinley. Grammar grade cer
tificates were granted the graduates
from the San Francisco Normal School.
Primary grade certificates were renewed
for Miss M. C. Barry, Miss J. A. Bigley,
Miss Ella Donovan, Miss Annie E.
Franks, Miss K. Lahaney, Mrs. B. A. Lit
ton, Miss E. J. McGreevy, Miss Annie E.
Owen, Mrs. Bessie Peake, Miss L. T. Ry
an and Miss M. H. Slavan. Other renew
als were granted as follows: High School
certificatesâ Miss M. J. Bragg, Ebenezer
Knowlton, Miss Marie Soule; special Ger
man certificatesâ Miss Laura Heineberg,
Adolph Herbst, Miss A. Miley, Dr. James
O. "Widemann. Special certificate in ar
chitectural drawing, Frank A. Gardner.
Mips Margaret M. O'Rourke was recom
mended to the State Board of Education
for a State educational diploma of the
grammar grade, Miss Minnie A. Monahan
and Miss Annie McCone Caldwell for lifo
diploma of the grammar grade.
Mrs. F. Bachman was elected a member
of the city board of examination for the
term of two years, from July 1. 1898, to
July 1, 1900, vice Miss Sophie A. Grote.
It was decided to allow the salary de
mands of eleven substitute teachers in
the evening schools, who had been ap
pointed without legal authority. The di
rectors took the position that the teach
ers, having given their services, were en
titled to remuneration. The demands will
not aggregate $300.
The following new teachers who served
successfully the term of probation were
appointed regular teachers: Miss Mary
E. Mangan, Dr. F. F. Fisher. Miss A. Mc-
Laughlin, M'ss E. Cerf. Miss A. C. Dow

Policeman Kenville Is
Formally Arrested.
EXTRAORDINARY COMPLAINT
SERGEANT PERRIN IS HIS SUB
ORDINATE'S ACCUSER.
Willie Lynch, the Injured Boy, Con
tinues to Improve Slowly at
the Receiving Hos
pital.
Frank L. Krnvllle, tho policeman who
la accused of throwing v. club at the boy
Willie Lynch last Friday Blfhi outside of
Woodward's Pavilion und fracturliiÂ« his
Bkull. m .- bovked at the City I'rlson yÂ«s
terday afternoon on a charge of assault
to murder, his bonds being Jlxed at 13)00.
He was detained pending the appearance
of his bondsmen, as Judge Mosan insisted
on new bonds being furnished. Chief
Lees and Captain Qillen are booked as
the arresting otllcers.
The complaining witness In the case Is
Sergeant Albert A. Perrln. lie wanted to
â wear to the complaint on information
and belief and append to thÂ« complaint
the statements of eye-witnesses, but
Judge Mopan wanted It "straight" for an
bault to murder, and I'errln is his subordi
nate's accuser.
The complaint was drawn up by Prose
cuting Attorney yptrietit, of Judge Slo
gan's court, and hÂ« was anxious that the
tact that he had done so should be cred
ited to him. It would have been butter
for him to have said nothing about it, us
.a tirst drawn up 11 wits the most extra
ordinary document tiled in v I'olW-o Court.
Willie Lynch's name was Kit v ted for
Kenville's twice, and the blank ira not
filled in showiiii; who the a-ssauli was
Committed upon. Two of the errors wero
discovered later and the alterations rnudo
and Initialed by the. Judge, but the most
important la Â»tl!l there and the complaint
la not wortli the paper it is written on.
The compi'ilnt ai- it stands now reads:
"And this (..implainant, upon oath, ac
cuses the said William Lynch of having
committed the said crime; and this com
pluinjtnt further alleKes and deposes that
tho eajd accused wuh arrested therefor,
and prays that the said accused may be
brought before a magistrate und dealt
with according to law."
The statements of four new witnesses
were procured by the police yesterday.
Their names are W. Goldberg, I. Living
stone, W. K. Adams and P, Meyers, all
hackmen. The tlrst three state that they
did not **cc uny club thrown, and Meyers
states that he saw KenvlUe throw the
dub and later stoop and pick it up.
Willie Lynch continues to improve at
the Receiving Hospital. Ho is very peev
ish, which is considered a good sign by
L>r. Hartley. The probability is that he
will recover.
Kenville was released last night on $5000
bonds furnished by "â¢Tom" Klynn and
James O'lirien.

THE PORTRAIT OF
CAPITALIST DEAN
THE ARTISTS HAVE A WILD
TIME WITH IT.
The Work of Art Had Many Failings,
Was Rejected, Repainte 1 and
Then Turned
Back.
Capitalist Walter K. Dean lias had his
face painted: that la, his features have
been reproduced on canvas by two local
artistsâ A. E. Jackson and C. A. Browne.
The latter are now after the price of their
masterpiece, which sums up $600; but they
are meeting with vigorous opposition in
their endeavors to collect. Dean doesn't
want the picture for many reasons. In
consequence a Jury Is now listening In
Judge Hunt's court to the reasons of the
artists why the picture should be paid
for, and incidentally those of the defend
ant why he should not be made to accept
the despised and alleged likeness.
The testimony of the plaintiffs was
taken yesterday morning and was ex
ceedingly amusing. Taking the separate
statements of the artists and weaving
them into "in; etory it produces a tale of
woe that only wielders of the brush can
appreciate. Here Is their narrative: As
Mr. Dean was too busy to sit for the por
trait he furnished the artists with a pho
tograph, and on this they .set to work.
In due time the portrait was finished and
Mr. Dean was well satisfied with the
work. Not so his wife.
In her opinion the portrait did not cor
rectly picture the extent of her husband's
avoirdupois. His eyes had a vacant look.
When one moved In a circle past the pic
ture the eyes did not follow one. It made
him have" the appearance of a parson.
Tho suit from which the head protruded
was black, a color much disliked by Mr.
Dean. There were wrinkles under the
eyes, likewise in the vest and tho trou
sers. The beard was too gray; it should
be darker. The portrait should be made
younger looking, as the subject was not
an old man. The build of the likeness was
too slight, which was the fault of the ar
tists, as had not Mr. Dean bared the calf
of his leg to let the artists see how well
he was "put up"?
So the artists went to work. They took
off that black suit and bedecked a larger
form with a brown one. More flesh was
put on emaciated parts. Wrinkles were
removed. Pants pressed, the vest pulled
down, the beard allowed a few. days' more
growth, the hair Was dyed, and, above
all, youth showed out from the face of
colors. More trouble.
The picture had been painted too light.
Who ever heard of an old master paint
ing a picture otherwise than with breadth
and depth and plenty of paint? Then
somebody said the likeness did not look
like the subject. Perhaps it was because
the hair was too dark, trie face too youth
ful, the pants too sleek, the vest pulled
too tight, or many other little deficien
cies. Anyway, tho picture was rejected.
Then came the suit.
To-day the defense will put on experts
to discuss the wrinkles, trousers and gen
eral appearance, and then the end will
come. The jury will decide whether or not
the artists are entitled â to recover or
â¢Dean to his money and a better picture.

AS A WIFE
SHE PLAYED
MANY ROLES
A Variety Actress in
Real Life.
IS CHARGED WITH BIGAMY
ANDREW BRUHN, A MUSICIAN,
THE COMPLAINANT.
He Was Married Last November and
Alleges That His Wife Has
a Previous Husband
Living.
Andrew linilin. a theatrical musician
living at 2<> Etondei place, nron to a com
plaint hi Judge Mogan'a COUCt yesterday
afternoon for the arrest of his wife on
rge of bigamy.
The woman is at present employed as a
singer In a variety theater, the New
Columbia on Montgomery avenue, where
she la known as Oracle Layng. Bruhn
met her at tho Empire Theater and mar
ried her November I last. She lived with
him till January 24, when she deserted
him without giving the. slightest hint of
her intention.
Bruhn is at present employed In a
theater In Sacramento, and, learning that
his wife had returned to the city, he came
here and called upon her. He wanted her
to return and live with him but she re
fused, telling him that she had not been
legally married to him. ltruhn then made
an Investigation and discovered that she
had been married in Portland. Or., In 1S1Â»2,
to Crelght Harrington, a variety perform
er, and had not been divorced 'from him.
After deserting Bruhn she went back to
Harrington and lived with him for some
months in Victoria, H. C.
She left Harrington and returned to this
city, after playing In a theater in San
pttgo, where she was known as Grace
Melburn. She assumed her stage name
here, Oracle Lavng, which led to the
discovery by Bruhn, who alleges that she
Is living with another man as his wife.
Officer Klasane, accompanied by Bruhn,
went to the Columbia music hall last
evening and served the warrant on the
pretty little singer. While she was chang
ing her stage costume for a street gown
Bruhn* became Involved In a quarrel with
Harry Parker, the stage manager of the
music ball. Words led to blows and tho
two men were severely punishing each
other when separated by people In the
hall.
Mrs. Harrington acknowledges that she
has never been divorced from husband
number one. but claims that the suit is
pending "This la simply a piece of spite
work on the part of Bruhn," she said.
' \\ lute I was living with him he abused
me and my four-year-old daughter by
my first husband. I have had him ar
rested several times for his cruel treat
ment of me. He would beat me and treat
me shamefully. I finally could stand It
no longer and left him. Re came to seÂ«
me yesterday and asked me to go back
to Sacramento and live with him. I told
him I could never endure a life with htm
and for this reason be has brought the
charge against me. When he and I were
married last November he knew that I
had not as yet obtained my divorce, but
he said he would bo willing to take the
chances. He never supported me and
very seldom worked, though I under
stand that he la employed at present. I
am not a bad woman, never drink and
always tend to my own business. All I
wish is a chance to work and support my
self and baby."
GREAT GAME PRESERVES

ANNUAL I.EPORT OF THE TAJff-
ALPAIS SPORTSMEN'S CLUB.
The Oflcers and Members Who Have
Bagged Deer, Quail nnd Snipe
During the Season.
The Tamalpals Sportsmen's Club held
its annual meeting and election of officers
a few evenings ago. The club controls the
shooting and fishing privileges of the
largest game preserve in this State which
is within easy reach of Sausalito. The
officers elected for the ensuing year are:
O. Muser, president; J. Borgaa, vice-presi
dent; J. i" Siebe, secretary. Directorsâ
W. tterg. A. Pissts, a. Roos, P. Lacoste,

man, F. Vernon. H. F. "Wagner. A. G.
Wieland and William Wolff.
In his annual report the president says:
We commenced the year 1597-98 with an
actual membership of twenty-eight, of which
number one resigned and four were dropped
for non-payment of dues. During spring and
summer we admitted seven new members, so
that to-day we can count thirty contributing
Members. The board of directors advocates
that the number, which according to our by
laws la limited to forty members, shall not ex
ceed thirty-live, and that a resolution be passed
to this effect.
Our finances are in fair shape. Toward the
latter part of the past fiscal year the board
was confronted with an unavoidable deficit,
but the admission of seven nÂ«rw members
helped us to pull through without an extra
assessment. A special asscssmTit was levied
tor trapping and transferring quails on our
preserve and for the construction of. ponds and
dams in and along the creek.
The llshlng on our preserve has been fair
during the past winter and spring, but owing
to the very low state of water has entirely
stopped. The creek, however. la full of small
fish, which promise good sport next season.
The ponds and dams, partly constructed and
contemplated by the special committee, will
also add to the sport. No account has been
kept of the Psh taken.
The quail shooting has been of the usual
average, and I give you the killing of each
member as per our game-book:
