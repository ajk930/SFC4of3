VOLUME LXXXIT.â^O. 28.
THOUSANDS MORE START ACROSS THE WIDE OCEAN.
BY HENRY JAMES.
STRAIGHT into the face of a stif
fening breeze that whipped the
banners of war until they beat a
martial cadence of th.-ir own;
which carried afar the Etable
clouds of smoke and flouted the puffs
from the saluting guns; whirh bore
back tuward the mist-enshrouded city
and the hazy hills the sound of patri
otic strains, four mighty ships plowed
their way out through the Golden Gate
yesterday afternoon, and the third Ma
nila expedition was on the ocean.
Three times has San Francisco
crowded the wharves and the heights,
three times have the cannon boomed a
farewell, three times the common
heart has been stirred to its depth by
the magnificent Bpectacle <>f a Meet
laden with citizen Boldiera going blithe
ly to take the chance of battle. The
lateFt to go. as the first, were cheered
by the enthusiasm of the good-by.
Bands played for them, fair women
threw them kisses, voices choked with
tears or by the frenzy of excitement
raised to the shrillest treble bade them
godspeed and safe return. There was
laughter and exchange of jests, but un
derneath it all was sadness.
A jolly Boldier boy threw a button
â which a young woman caught, smiling
back her thanks. Then she said, but
so he could not hear "Poor fellow, ptv
haps he will never come back."
An old man stood leaning against the
cabin of the tug Reliance. He was
waving a handkerchief. A stalwart lad
leaned over the rail of the transport
towering above. "Good-by. father," he
said. The old man stopped waving the
handkerchief, having other uses for it.
"That's my boy." he said proudly, and
added: "How the smoke does get into
your eyes." Hut it was not smoke.
The four transports were the Indiana,
Morgan City. * >hio and City of Para.
Just how the troops were distributed
among them few spectators knew and
few cared. They were all to tight for
the flag, some were volunteers, some
regulars; they came from different
State?, but they all shared the honors
of the day with equal favor. And truly
they must have felt glad. They
swarmed the decks and the rigging.
Some scaled the masts to the very p-;ik,
swinging their hats, shouting, gesticu
lating and bo sailed away. There were
hurm) for the lowa band,
for The Can, for the ladies.
The soldi'-rs Beemed to feel that thpy
had a debt to pay, and if they did the
BCOre was wiped out. In the eagerness
of the soldiers to get close to The Call \
tug a dozen of them climbed into a
boat hanging from the davits of the
Indiana. Something was, rotten. The
Iron to which the tackle was fastened
gave and without an instant's warning
the dozen were struggling in the water, i
That none was drowned was remarka

The San Francisco Call
There were many boats on the bay,
' but none other tricked as for a gala
day as was the Reliance. There were
i flags at every halliard and the rigging
was bright with color. On board were
! the members of the lowa band, a
1 splendid organization, and liner music
than they gave has never been heard
on the bay. The other army guests
were Colonel Loper, commanding the
lowa Regiment, Adjutant Davidson,
I Hospital Steward Carpenter and Miss
Weeks of the hospital corps. A little
I woman, fragile of aspect, with a calm
: and gentle but determined face, she
has cast her lot with the soldiers from
her State. "I'm going to Manila when
the Fifty-first goes." she said quietly
to one who had noticed the symbol of
the Red Cross she wore. She will go.
She has made up her mind as to what
is her duty, and more than a ruling of
the War Department will be necessary
to make her change it. In addition to
these guests were members of The
Call staff and their invited friends.
Few peopie who were out on the
water yesterday failed to grasp the fact
that the Irish rowing crow of the South
End Rowing Club to the number of six
had laid down the oar for the sterner
implements of conflict. There are six of
them on the Ohio. They stated this
freely, vociferously, joyously. The
throng expressed distinct approval of
the Irish rowing crew. They will re
member that Allen, Kelly, Ryan. Du
plissea and a pair of Lynches have re
linquished sport for the business of
fighting, and seem to face the prospects
of a tropic skirmish as gayly as they
would go Into a race. The Reliance
circled around the three transports in
the stream several times. At each
visit there would be an exchange of
whistles smiting the ears like a blow.
There would be a shower of letters,
while beauty and gallantry bar:
compliments and made pretense to
trade kisses. An officer tossed down ;<â
package of mail, and mining the tug
it went into the water. The officer
looked pained. Perhaps it was a final
message to loved ones. Happily the
packet floated, but not until it had been
rescued with a boat hook did the officer
smile again.
It was shortly after 10 o'clock when
the Reliance pulled away from the
dock, and two hours later the Para,
with Minnesota's regiment, glided out
to join the three already at anchor.
As it moved slowly along the Reliance
came close, the lowans playing "Amer
ica." The Mlnnesotans stood with bared
heads while the strains lasted and then
there burst from them a round of
cheers as only sincere patriots could
have given when wrought to fervor by
the melody, the sentiment and the
majesty of the occasion. From this
time to the going enthusiasm became
more and more marked. Along the
wharves the crowds grew denser. The

hue betokening war, sent from her siren
blasts fit to muse the city. The crash
,of sound was deafening. Every throat
' tried to add to the volume. The lowa
: band played in concert with one on the
Morgan <"ity. High in the rigging two
! buglers sent across the waves the calls
! which to civilians mean nothing but
harmony, and yet which on the field
may summon brave men to death.
There is something of mystery to a
landsman about all that pertains to
ships. Here were four giants of the
deep pulling taut their anchor chains.
There had been no passing of signals
s'> far as the untrained eye had ob
served, except that at each prow the
i "blue peter 1 " caught the breeze. Then
there was the rattle of iron against
iron, out of the water came the huge,
rusty anchors, The Indiana was mov
ing. Slowly, so scare â¢!>â¢ more than the
' ripple as of a skiff was at her prow,
while at the stern the gentle eddy hard
ly betrayed the motion of propellers,
the flagship set off on the sea-wide
, journey. Then faster and faster, v ith
spray in front and foam behind, it
Bped to the west. One by one the others
fallowed, stretching in imposing parade,
while chasing, racing, screaming with
lunge of steel and breath of steam, the
little craft of every sort tried to keep
, abreast. From the Mohican came a
salute. Then Alcatraz and the outer
forts took up the thunderous jubilation.
As on other days flags dipped in grace
i ful acknowledgment. From all over the
,city came the Mast of whistles blent
into one subdued hum as the ships
I passed farther and farther.
The day was beautiful. The bay
danced under the touch of a moderate
; wind. Over all was a veil, partly
smoke, partly mist, through which the
; sun could not pierce with a full glare.
It was heavy enough to drape and
soften the barren banks. At the Gate
â  the wind blew steady and strong, but
\ not with an unpleasant chill. Beyond
! the Gate the mist was heavier and
lower. In the order in which they had
started the transports were soon be

back to their friends. So long as they)
were within hearing they sent cheers.
And â  thus," grateful and happy, they?

ESCORTED THE
SHIPS TO SEAi
A Fleet of Small Craft Acoom-*
pany the Transports Out
of the Bay.
BY J. J. COREY.
Afar out on the boundless PaclflO
four huge transports are plowing their
way to tho hemisphere of the rising
sun. Yesterday they swung idly at
anchor in the balmy waters of San
Francisco Bay, their decks, rails and
ripping: alive with happy, careless,
shouting blueooats, forgetful of the*
morrow and intent only on the inspir
ing panorama that was spread befora
thorn.
The thoughts thnt occupy their at
tention now can only be conjectured,
but it is not difficult to imagine that
the shouts have died away, the songs
are hushed, and, instead of swarming
over the ships with daring bordering
on the reckless, the men have turned
their attention to the sterner duties
that fall to their lot. Many an eye
dimmed with unbidden tears is turned
toward the land long since hidden be
low the horizon, thoughts turn back to
the forests and plains of Minnesota, to
the mountains and vales of Idaho, to
the vinelands and orchards of Califor
nia, to every portion of the sisterhood
of States, for they are all represented
on those ships. Hearts that were light
yesterday are heavy to-day. To some
a strange unrest has come, and these â 
unfortunates feel that no rest can come
to their troubled souls â unless they can
succeed in unloading the souls with
the rest of their commissary stores.
These men monopolize the rails to
day, where all had an equal chance
yesterday.
The passing of the third expedition of
the Army of the Philippines was
marked by a demonstration o-n the bay
and along the entire harbor front, from
the Potrero to Fort Point, more mag
nificent, if possible, than when the van
guard sailed away. It has been my
fortune to watch the three fleets vanish
into the broad expanse beyond the
Golden Gate, and my impression is that
yesterday the people of San Francisco
outdid themselves. Perhaps the day
had much to do with the exuberance,
for no brighter sun or more balmy breeze
ever kissed the waters of the bay,
while before a haze deepening into a
raw fog settled down enveloping the
transports almost before they had
passed through the heads. Then, too,
when the first fleet sailed, our people
had just awakened to the full realiza
tion of the horrors of war and in ad
dition were called upon to Lid fare
well to legions of our youth and early
manho-od. Now, the great dread has
been calmed in a measure by the suc
cessive and almost bloodless victories
of our arms, and though more of the
youth of San llrancisco went forth to
battle yesterday, mothers yielded up
their sons, sweethearts their lovers and
sisters their brothers with less reluct
ance than before.
The bay was alive with small craft,
and the wharves and hills swarmed
with people. When The Call tug Re
liance, gay with bunting, and bearing
Colonel Loper of the Fifty-first lowa
Volunteers. Adjutant J. P. Davidson,
and the magnificent regimental band
among the other guests, made the first
round of the three transports lying in
the stream at 11 o'clock, comparatively
few boats were out. but within an hour
the upper bay was dotted with boats
of every description.
One of those on the Reliance was
Miss Weeks, the guardian angt-1 of the
boys from lowS.. Miss Weeks' life is2
spent in carine: for the sick, and when
the Fifty-flrÃt went Into camp at Dos
Moinea she joined the regiment as
nurse. When orders were received to
proce< i i" Ban Francisco, Miss Weeks
announced her det< rmlnation to ac
company her boys even to Manila, des
the decision of the War Depart
ment that Red Cross nurses would not
sent with troops. Citizens of Dcs
Moines raised a liberal fund to defray
Kpens 9| apd when the Fifty-first

boat to follow t" the Orient will bear
Miss Weeks on her mission.
Over the writer floated the strains of
the hand and the men on the ships
climbed on the mils and into the ri#-

Midwinter Fair lowa Bent her State
I to delight the thousands, and now
she sends a band â not quite so larpe,
but equally as goodâ to cheer her sol
i on to victory. Most of the boys
]<>w. i never saw salt water until
they arrive,) here, were carried away
by the enthusiasm and played until it
seemed as though the-- would not leave
a breath in their bodies. Every selec
tion brought forth cheers from the sol
diers and applause from the other boats
that followed in the v-ko of the Reli-
The selections that aroused the
â greatest furor, aside from the national
â¢ ; iar :hes In which

As ihe :. iached the In
., the flagship oi the BQuadron, a
great cheer wont up from the men on
board. The tug drew alongside and
made fast while three sailors clambered
S board the transport and the soldiers
astily scribbled a last message to
The band of the Twen
ty-third Infantry was Btationed on the
hurricane deck and answered the melo
dies of the lowans with like sweet
b trains.
Just after the tug made fast a mishap
occurred thai would have resulted in a
terrible disaster had it not been for the
foresight of Captain Brokaw, but hap
pily the only sufferers were a half
dozen men of the Third Artillery, who
were treated to an involuntary high
bath. Hanging in the .
davits was a boat rifled with sol I
: s noticed that the ropes
in the tackle were ...Id and worn, and
he ordered the tug's lines to be pa
well forward. This order was hardly
executed and the Reliance well out
from under the boat when down it came
With a crash and splash. Instantly an
astotu . rgan
ized an impromptu swimming match
for the stern or' the tug. Tiny were
hauled on board none the worse for
their ducking and clambered back on
board ihe transport. As the first man
went over the side of the ship a sym
pathetic comrade asked him if the
water was cold.
"No," was the reply, "it's salt," and
then the bather gave bark to the bay a
gallon or bo of its element.
One other mishap occurred during
the day. A boatman named Hagaman
[zed near the transports,
but was hauled on board uninjured and
sent ashore.
From the Indiana the Reliance went
in turn t.. the Morgan City and Ohio,
and at each letters were gathered and
greetings exchanged.
Lieutenani i C the artillery
avai.- The Call's boat to
reach the Morgan City, on which he
was to sail, and h id a lively scramble
up the ladder to avoid going Into the
bay, as the tide swept the tug out more
rapidly than was anticipated.
The City of Para drew out from the
Mail Dock and was escorted to where
the i â  3ports were lying by the
Reliance, the gallant Minnesotans that
swarmed all over her cheering them
selves hoarse. Col< nel Reeve sent his
farewell n o The Call aboard,
as the others had done, and then an
other tour of the fleet was made.
Shortly i fter 2 o'clock the "blue
I up to the fore of the
ships soon got un
der way. Pandemonium seemed t"
break loose on sh"!'f. whistles k<Â»pt up
fening farewell, and as the In
diana glided down past Fols^m-street
wharf the guns on the Naval Reserve
ship Marion boomed out a salute of
eleven Rims.
The gunboat B^nnington and the cut
ter Corwin contributed their full quota
to the uproar, while th<Mr yards were
manned with cheering sailors. Down
past Lombard street wjiere the Valen
cia lay, with the N'irth Dakota troops
ready to go on board, another salute of
eleven guns was fired, and later the
big puns of Alcatraz, Port Mason and
Fort Scott thundered out in honor of
the departing troops.
Following in the Indiana's wake
came tho Morgan City, Ohio and City
of Para, their rigging alive with boys
In blue, who dauntlessly swarmed
aloft as nimbly as veteran tars. The
most daring clambered to the very
tops of the masts and there took their
parting glimpse of San Francisco.
Out near the Golden <;rtte occurred
one of the prettiest incidents nf the
day. The six-oared boat of the life
saving station manned by stalwart Hfe-
B&vera pulled out, and as each ship
passed gave cheers which brought
forth a ringing reply from the soldiers.
An hour after the signal to get under
way had been given the last of the
fleet was well out beynnd the h<*ads,
hurrying on to join their comrades in
the distant isles.
THE WATCHER
ON THE HILL
The Departure of the Troop
ships as Seen From
Afar.
BY C E. EDWORDS.
Low lyirer strata of smoke and fog
hung over Berkeley hills and obscured
the upper bay as the watcher on the
hill took his seat on the rock where he
had spent so many hours In idle spec
ulation over the mysteries of the ocean.
The green waters of the hay took on an
hundred evanescent hues from pink
through the reds and greens and
browns to deep purple as the lights and
shadows were caught on the waves
tossed up by the capful of wind which
came through the Gate.
There came an unusual quiet on
the water as If even ocean itself were
waiting for the unusual to happen.
What email craft there were seemed to
scuttle to places of hiding, and when a
heavy schooner came toiling past Alca
traz a busy tug hurried out and quickly
Bhoved her to a mooring.
Soon the streets lying below In the
broad sunlight took on an air of bustle.
Midgets, that close inspection proved to
be human beings, were moving toward
the adjacent hills or down to the docks
and wharves at the water's edge. Grad
ually tho points of vantage changed
color from tha sere brown of earth to
the black of clustered humanity until

all the hilltops and all th? water front
were fringed with people who waited.
The quiet air of expectancy which
brooded over all was impressive and
depressing. There was no hilarity, no
gladsome shouting, no holiday appear
ance. The whole scene bore a funereal
appearance as if a people mourned,
There are some silences that are in-
Bpiring. The silence of the multitude
waiting on the hills yesterday was op
pressive to such a degree that the sud
den unearthly shrieking of whistles
brought relief to strained and tense
nerves.
As the long black hull of a troopship
slowly moved out past an obscuring
point of land to the ace paniment of
rdant steam voices the black
on hills i nd wharves swayed and pul
sated as if moved by a common im
pulse, and the watcher on the hill
could see that the crowd was
madly. There was the silent demon
stration, but to hear the sound was im
pi ssible. j^its were waved and flashes
of white showed where handkerchiefs
aided in the visible farewell.
As troopship after troopship, black
with its living freight, pushed out to
ward the open sea until four majestic
â¢Is with as many thousand men
: dear against the western sky,
there was a burning in the scar on the
brow of the watcher on the hill, and
again was that old itching sensation
felt in the side where the enemy's bul
let had plowed its way. In memory's
eye was the scene of another day when
men went forth to battle for their coun
try, and the habit of wondering
"where" and "why" in regard to the
vessels that come and go was replaced
by wondering "when 1 , 1 and "how" v
gard to the living battlement that had
sprung uj use of the country
and the nation's honor.
When and how would they distin
guish themselves? When and how
would they return? When and how
would they die? Fur war is dying â war
is suffering â and it was to die and to
suffer that those thlnkine machines
were going forth across the wide Paci
fic with the signal watchword, "Re
member the Maine," Hying at the
masthead. Nor was that watchword
â¢' revenge. It was the Inspiration
of a mass and in no sens.- the personal
grievance of the individual. Those men
grouped on deck to gel the last glimpse
of their native shores before meeting
their country's foe had no personal
feud. It was a collective body repre-
Bentlng the country, and ready to tnk<
up cudgels for humanity, with "Re
member the Maine" meaning naught
more than "Remember Spain's treach
ery to friends, brutality to foes and
opposition to civilization."
This was the sentiment that was im

THE INFANTRY
FOR THE FINISH
Regulars and Volunteers of
General Mac Arthur's
Brigade.
BY HUGH M. BURKE.
â War may begin -with engagements
in which cruisers, battle-ships and land
batteries exchange compliments in
steel projectiles. Examples of in
dividual heroism and the magnificent
achievements of squadrons may chal
lenge the admiration of the world, but
a war once begun is seldom finished un
til the man who walks and fights goes
to the front. The soldier with a mus
ket in his hand must go over the line
of rifle pits, drive in the skirmishers
and ultimately scale the main works
to win substantial victory and gain for
the country enduring peace. The he
roic figure in modern war, after all, is
the man with a musket. In the thicket
or In the open, without breastworks of
earth or armor of steel to shield him,
he advances. The shells of his own
protecting guns shriek over his head
and the bullets of the enemy hiss in
his face. Many fall, but so strong is
the fiber of courage in the American
soldier that few falter.
Men of this type compose the Amer
ican army destined for service in the
Philippines, and many of them turned
CO salute patriotic San Francisco as the
steamships Indiana; Ohio, .Morgan City
and City of Para sailed through the
Golden Gate yesterday.
Major General Merritt has ample rea
son for his faith in the soldiers of the
Eighth Army Corps. The volunteers
from Minnesota, Wyoming, Idaho and
North Dakota, as well as the regulars
of the Third United States Artillery,
Eighteenth and Twenty-third Infantry
and the Signal Corps will respond to
every demand of the campaign within
the limit of human endurance.
In the under current of the great tide
of enthusiasm yesterday one could ob
serve the strength of regimental and
State pride. The men of Battery L and
the men of Battery G were equally
proud "f their respective organizations.
The Minnesota Volunteers -welcomed
cheering recognition of their Thirteenth
Regiment. The young men who have
Berved in the National Guard of Min
nesota feel that they have, in a certain
sense, the honor of Minnesota in their
keeping. It was noted that the volun
teers of Wyoming and Idaho were ani
mated by the same spirit of State pride.
They went to the front resolved to up
hold the flag of the country and add
luster to the star in the field that shines
for their own State.
General Merritt is a renowned leader.
As gallant men as ever lived or died
fought under his leadership in the war
from 1861-65. He will lead a command
in the Philippines as full of dash, en
ergy and endurance as any that fol
lowed him in the war which ended for
soldiers at Appomattox.
General Arthur Mac Arthur Is a sol
dier with a record of soldierly achieve
ments and it is his judgment that no
better troops have gone to the front
than those which comprise the various
organizations of his brigade. It is
doubtful if the regulars are the su
periors in discipline of the volunteers
in his command.
The troops of the third expedition to
Manila are armed and equipped in ef
fective style. It is true that the volun
teers are not supplied with the modern
magazine rifle, but the improved
breech-loading Springfield which they
carry is not a gun for the enemy to
despise. The regulars of the brigade
carry the American Krag-Jorgensen
rifle. The batteries of the Third Ar
tillery have the "three decimal" breech
loading rifled pieces and rapid-fire
Hotchkiss guns.
These Western soldiers that sailed
for the Orient yesterday are pretty
handy fighters. Many of them have
been trained to the use of the rifle and
back of their readiness to fight is a
good stock of intelligence on the prime
question of taking care of themselves.
The next column may offer to lowa,
Kansas and Montana Volunteers an op
portunity to serve at the front.

WYOMING VOLUNTEERS.
Governor Richards Sails Out to
Sea Fourteen Miles to Bid
Them Farewell.
When the Wyoming Volunteers took
their departure from Cheyenne for San
Francisco, Governor Richards said to
them, in the course of a brief address:
"Boys, I'll not bid you a last farewell
now, but I promise you that when you
sail out of the Golden Gate for Manila I
will be the last Wyoming man that you'll
see as you pass out into the broad ocean."
Yesterday Governor Richards, who has
been in the city two weeks, went on board
the Ohio in company with his brother-in
law, George C. Hunt, of Oakland, and
went out to sea as far as the lightship, a
distance of fourteen miles, bidding all the
Wyoming volunteers a sincere farewell
and a hearty godspeeds He returned on
the first pilot-boat, and as the boat pulled
away from the Ohio, Governor Richards
was given round after round of cheers un
til he was out of hearing. He had kept
his word to the letter.
Thirty minutes before- tho departure of
the Ohio, Harry Wells of Company G of
the Wyoming Volunteers, who was
supposed to be sick in the hos
pital at Camp Merritt, was dis
covered on board, much to the surprise
of every one, by the regimental surgeon.
So determined to go to Manila was he
that he had quietly got up out of bed and
found his way on board ship. The sur
geon believed that his symptoms were
those of diphtheria. The Grace Barton
was immediately signaled, and -a few min
utes later Wells was put on board of her,
together with another sick man, and con
veyed to the Harbor Hospital.
Three other Wyoming volunteers were
left behind. One Is W. H. Holden of
Company H, who is in the French Hospi
tal, dying of tuberculosis, and the others
are Arthur Parker of Company G. and
Henry D. George, both of whom are in
the brigade hospital.
At a late hour last night a Wyoming
battery of light artillery, composed of 125
men and commanded by Captain Gran
ville M. Palmer of Cheyenne, arrive.! at
Oakland and will come over to San Fran
cisco at an early hour this morning. This
battery, the only organization that has r
been exclusively recruited in Cheyenne;
was accepted on the 15th, was mustered
in on the 16th and started for San Fran
cisco on the 85th. It will go into camp
on the same ground that was occupied
by the Wyoming volunteers, who sailed
for Manila yesterday. This particular
spot had been reserved for it.
Governor Richards makes the state
ment that 10 per cent of the population
of Wyoming of military age is now in the
army*. Wyoming has furnished three
times the number of men required under
her quota This is the best showing made
by any State.

WASHINGTON, June 27.â The Navy Department at
11:15 a - m - posted the following bulletin:
"I bmmodore Watson sails to-day in the Newark to join
Admiral Sampson, when he will take under his command an
armored squadron with several cruisers and proceed at once
to the Spanish coast."
The Navy Department has also posted a bulletin, which
indicates what ships will compose Commodore Watson's
squadron. It is designated the Eastern squadron, and is
made up as follows:
"Flagship Newark, battle-ships lowa and Oregon,
cruisers Yosemite. Yankee and Dixie, and the colliers Scan
dia. Abarenda and Alexander. The advance will be made at
once from Santiago."
The bulletin also showed the following changes in the
designation of the division of our war vessels: "North At
lantic fleet. "Rear Admiral Sampson, commanding; first
squadron, Commodore J. A. Howell commanding; second
squadron, Commodore W. S. Schley commanding; naval
base, Key West. Fla., Commodore E. Remey command
ing."
WASHINGTON, June 27.â The ad
ministration to-day finally came to a
decision to s^nd an American squadron
to the Spanish coast and into the Medi
terranean. Several times since the war
broke out rumors to this effect have
' irculated, hut the project had not
rlalized. It required the Spanish
ment toward the Philippines by
Camara's squadron to decide the Navy
Department to adopt this bold stroke
This first announcement to-day,
through a bulletin posted at the War
Department, of the Government's In
tention was received with incredulity.
There was a suspicion that the Btory
was floated to deceive the Spanish
nt. However, when, lat"r In
th" day, the detail of th^ vessels se
ititute < '"mmodore Wat
son's eastern squadron was announce<
and ders were given to pro
vision the fleet for four months, it be
came apparent t't the last doubter tha
rovernment was in earnest in thi
purpose to dispatch the fleet to Europe
The thrf> vessels selected as collier
have Btarted already on thfÂ»ir way to
Newport News to take on a large sup
ply of coal. It will require a week to
get them down to Sampson's fleet so
that if thÂ» start is to be made from
that point it will be Impossible for
Commodore Watson to get away befor
the 4th of July. This would seem to
1 â¢â  an auspicious date for the begin
ning of an expedition that will for th
first time in the world's history star
from tin- new world to attack conti
nental Europe. No attempt is made to
deny that the Governrn-nt is influeneet
in ordering this mov^nv-nt by a desire
to check th" propr*s^ eastward of the
! fleet It was not believed tha
the Spanish admiral could be guilty o
the folly of unnivi-rint; his own home
P' rts in this fashion, but in, ..much a.
he seems determined t i <!<> so the na
val Strategists could not do less than
take advantage of the magnificent op
portunity thus afforded them to strike
a crushing blow at Spain and thereby
perhaps save much time and loss of life
and money in the conduct of the tedi
ous campaign in Cuba.
The determination tÂ«> send this squad
ron against Spain was the outcome of
direct official advices reaching the State
and Navy Departments as to the pro
gress of Adminil Camara's squadron.
These advices give a list of the Span
ish ships now nearing the. Suez C;inal
which differs somewhat from the list
given in the press dispatches and by
I. '..yds. The official list is as follows:
Pelayo, Carlos V. Audaz, Osada, Pros
erpina, Tatriota, Rapido, BuenosAyres,
Isla de Paney, Colon, Covadonga and
San Francisco.
The additional information comes
from official sources that this squadron
is at Port Said and expects to take on
board ln.ooo tons of coal before enter-
Ing the Suez Canal. Such a heavy
coaling will take pome time. It dis
close* also that the admiral expects to
make a long sail, and is doubtless head
ed for the Philippines, a point which
the officials lure doubted at first.
The squadron is the most formidable
Spain has afloat in total tonnage,
strength of individual ships, armor and
guns.
The Pelayo Is the strongest of the
â hips and is th<> only battle-ship in the
Spanish navy. She is 9900 tons, with a
Bpe< '1 of 16.7 knots. She carries thirty
five guns of various caliber and has
eeven torpedo tubes. The largest guns
are the 12-lnch Hontorias, one forward
and one aft, and 11-inch Hontorias, one
on each beam. The Carlos V is of 9090
tons, with a speed of 19 knots. She has
twenty-eight guns, the largest being
]]-inch Hontorias, worked electrically,
one forward and one aft. She has also
six torpedo tubes.
The Audaz and Osada are torpedo
boat destroyers, finished In England
Just before the war began. They are of
400 tons each and are 30 knots. Each
carries six guns and two torpedo tubes.
:..Th>Â» iiueno* Ayxom belqag*. ta *he
! Transatlantic Company of Cadiz, and
has been transformed into a cruiser.
1 She is 5200 tons, with 14 knots speed.
The Proserpina, Patriota and Rapi
. do are merchant vessels recently con
structed and armed. The Colon, Cova
donga and San Francisco are colliers.
It is appnrent from this that the main
reliance of the fieetr is on the bnttle
ship Pelayo, the armored cruiser Carlos
V and the two new torpedo boat de
stroyers, Audaz and Osada. The others
are auxiliary cruisers and colliers. As
there are only two armored ships in the
lot, Adimral Dewey's fleet of protected
but unarmored ships probably will take
care of this Spanish squadron. With
the Monterey added he could certainly
do so.
Thp Eastern squadron, which the
United States will now send against
Spain, far outranks the Spanish squad
ron, the lowa and Oregon exceeding
the Peiayo and Carlos V at every point,
while the other United States vessels
are far superior, ship for ship, to those
of the Spanish squadron, with the sin
gle exception of the two Spanish tor
pedo-boat destroyers.
"When the American fleet sails for
Spain it win take with it complete In
formation as to the entire stretch of
Spanish coast, -with detail maps of
; every harbor and its fortifications. The
War Board had a mass of this infor
mation before it, and spent most of the
day studying Spanish charts and for
tifications, with a view of outlining the
series of blows which are to b" deliv
ered to Spain at home. The Spanish
coast line is 2122 kilometers long, of
which 769 kilometers is nn the north
coast, while 13H3 kilometers is along the
M<-niterranean and the Atlantic on the
south coast. The north is described
jby naval strategists as abrupt and
'â â  mountainous, with sinuous inlets and
gulfs, resembling the fjords of Scandi
navia. In general, the fortifications
i of the coast are relics of the medieval
greatness of Spain, and many of these
defenses are tumbling ruins.
The Spanish coast is divided into
three captain generalcies, namely: Fer
rol on the north, Cadiz on the south
and Carthagena on the east. At Fer
rol is the naval school and the school
lof naval application. At Carthagena
; is the school of ordnance and the tor
| pedo school. Cadiz is the point where
! most of the fortification guns are
made.
Each of the three naval provinces has
a certain number of ports and coast
towns under its care.
The total artillery of these ports, un
der the normal conditions prior to the
war, is as follows: One hundred and
nineteen Krupp guns, 65 Armstrong
guns, 90 Ordonez guns and a large num
ber of Hontorla guns. The main re
liance Is on the Ordonez guns, which
are especially for fortification pur
poses. They are of 21.24 and 30 centi
meters. A separate division of the
coast is made for the purpose of plac
ing torpedoes and submarine mines.
This work is divided into four districts,
with Ferrol, Cadiz, Carthagena and
Mahon as headquarters. Each town
along the coast Is allowed a certain
number of torpedoes. For instance, the
allotment for Barcelona is 500 torpe
does. *
Many of these ports are connected by
cables, which form an additional fea
ture of naval attack. A cable runs
from Barcelona to Marseilles. Cadiz
has three cables, one to the Canaries,
another to Gibraltar and another to
Villa Real. Vigo Is the cable station
for two lines.
The Information is In minute detail
as to the defenses of each port. For
Instance, Ferrol Is protected on the
north by a series of three batteries and
two chateaus. the chateaus occupying
points which command passes from the
sea. The town is encircled by bastions
and redoubts of ancient pattern, but
recently remodeled. The defenses of
Cadiz consist of a circle of eleven pow
erful forts. The other harbors are sim
ilarly defined, I with detail information

water, batteries, etc. With this full In
formation at hand the nature of the as
sault upon the coast of Spain will be
pretty well outlined before the Ameri
can squadron sails. At the same time
much will be left to the commander In
chief of this squadron.
Some naval authorities believe that
the Canary Islands will be the first
point of attack, and that the next move
will be to establish a naval base at
Ceuta, a ->Int on the African coast,
owned by Spain and opposite Gibraltar.
With this base our ships would be
within easy striking distance of the
long stretch of Spanish coast.
The United States Consul at Port
Said has reported to the State Depart
ment that, in obedience to its Injunc
tion, he had lodged a protest against
the selling of a supply of coal there to
the Spanish squadron. It is true the
failure to obtain coal at Port Said
would not in Itself prevent the Span
ish vessels from passing through the
canal and continuing on their way to
the Philippines, for they have with
them one or more colliers. But the
coal carried by these would be abso
lutely essential to the vessels of the
squadron long before they had crossed
the Arabian Sea.
To add to the embarrassment of Ca
mara there is good reason to believe
that the canal management will ob
struct his passage on the ground o f
interference with navigation.
Commodore Watson should reach Ad
miral Sampson by Thursday morning
or perhaps earlier, for the Newark hav
ing been extensively repaired. Is now
a swift warship. The operations before
Watson are of a character that will ad
mit of employment to the best advant
age of the big monitors for bombarding
purposes and small cruisers and gun
boats as blockading vessels. The start
will be made from off Santiago just as
soon as the squadron can be gotten
ready, and this, fortunately, owing to
the completeness of the naval mobiliza
tion, will be In a very short time.
There is no intention of weakening
the Havana blockade by the with
drawal of Commodore Watson with his
flagship. To prevent this Secretary
Long has ordered Commodore Howell
to proceed immediately to the Amer
ican fleet off Havana to take command
of the post vacated by Commodore
Watson. Commodore Howell is at
present in command of the coast pa
trol fleet and he will take the entire
fleet with him, that is, all of the larger
vessels, to re-enforce the blockade of
the Cuban coast. He is already on his
way south from the New England
coast and should reach Cuban waters
by the end of the week.
The Naval War Board was In session
all the forenoon. It had before it con
fidential telegrams from Admiral
Sampson, with whom It had been In
communication by cable for the last
two days.

FORBIDDEN
TO COAL AT
PORT SAID
MADRID, June 27. â A dispatch has been received here
from Admiral Camara announcing his arrival at Port Said. He
adds that the ships under his command had a "capital voyage,"
and averaged a speed of ten miles an hour. It was announced
here this afternoon that Admiral Camara has been ordered
through the Suez canal with the warships under his command.
PORT SAID, June 27. â Upon the application of the
United States Consul here, orders have been issued forbidding
the coaling at this port of Admiral Camara's iket until further
orders.
LONDON, June 27. â A special dispatch from Madrid says
the Minister of Marine, Senor Aunon, has made a statement
to the effect that Admiral Camara's squadron will leave Port
Said to-day for the Philippine Islands. He is credited with hav
ing said that he believed the squadron was powerful enough to
defeat the ships under Admiral Dewey. The dispatch an
nounces that the hope is expressed in Madrid that Manila will
be able to hold out until the arrival of Admiral Camara's squad
ron.
PARIS, June 27. â Admiral Camara's squadron, which
starts to-morrow morning for Suez, made a very fine record,
with an average of ten knots throughout, being led by the de
stroyers. Among interesting items is that the dues for the
fleet's passage through the canal amounts to $160,000.
LONDON, June 28.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standard says:
Egypt's refusal to supply coal to Ad
miral Camara's squadron is strongly
resented, as due to England's influ
ence. It is regarded as direct proof of
an Anglo-American entente.
The Spanish Transatlantic Steam
ship Company has coal depots at Aden,
Colombo and Singapore. Captain Au
non, Minister of Marine, hopes the mat
ter may be arranged, since England
has not yet declared coal contraband
of war. According to another version
the incident Will serve as a pretext to
bring Admiral Camara back to Spain
to check American aggression.
The Times, commenting; editorially
on the movements of Admiral Camara's
squadron, says: "This singular naval
promenade is probably of a theatrical
character, designed to serve the double
purpose of impressing the United
States and satisfying public opinion in
Spain. It will certainly fail to attain
the first of these objects. The million
pesetas required to pay for the passage
of the squadron through the Suez
canal might be more usefully employed
than in a demonstration that alarms
nobody and is too late >' to r, relieve
JtonUai .pou^U^j^^ossxfi^jh^^ga^
iards are justified in declining to be
greatly frightened by the throat of an
American expedition to the peninsula,
though this may stimulate the demand
for the conclusion of peace."
NEW YORK, June 27.â A dispatch to
the Tribune from Cairo, Egypt, says:
The Egyptian Government has in
structed its authorities at Port Said to
prevent the 150 stokers engaged there
by Admiral Camara for his fleet from
embarking on Spanish ships, and has
courteously informed Admiral Camara
that their embarkation would be an in
fringement of the laws of neutrality,
which Egypt intends to observe rig
orously.
The Audaz* machinery requires re
pairs and Camara has signified his in
tention of remaining at Port Said for
three days. ,
-â  â¦ â  â  . .
The Canal Is Deep Enough.
That Admiral Camara does not take
.his i fleet on through the Suez canal and
to Manila to crush Dewey cannot be
explained on the ground that his ves
sels , draw too much water "to pass
through. The Pelayo draws 24 feet 11
inches, the Carlos V one inch more,
and the Numancia, the deepest in the
water of all, draws 25 feet 3 inches.
The canal in the shallowest places is
at least four "feet deeper, and several
British ships now on the China station,
drawing 2 feet and ; 3 : inches more than
the Numancia, have passed through

HONGKONG, June 27.â General Agri
inaldo, according to letters brought
here from Cavite by a German steamer,
occupies the mansion of the late Gov
ernor of Cavite, but he will shortly
move to Imua to make room for the
American troops. The insurgents now
have 5000 prisoners.
A hundred and eighty-seven of the
Spanish wounded have been sent to
Manila with a Hag of truce by permis
sion qX Admiral Dewey. The wounded
Spanish ofhYers, with one exception,
are at Cavite.
The Spanish brigadier, Moret, was
killed at San Fernando, in an attempt
to force the rebel lines.
An American official at Cavite writes
ms follows: "If great bloodshed and
destruction come to Manila Spain may
justly blame the Germans. Manila
would have surrendered before the ar
rival of the German squadron without
bloodshed, but now, owing to the moral
support of its presence, the city refuses
to surrender."
MANILA. Philippine Islands, June 22,
via Hongkong, June 27.â The Spaniards
claim to have driven the rebels back,
but really the position is unchanged.
The arrival of the American troops is
awaited and they are expected to-day.
The Spanish outposts have prepared
to retire promptly to the walled citadel,
and will probably make only a nominal
resistance.
A section of the Insurgents, it Is al- '
leged, dislike the Americans and desire
German protection. Five German war
ships are here.
The Spaniards continue their nightly
fusillade, but the volunteers decline to
go to the trenches, while many of the
regulars are idling about the town.
Thousands of trees in the vicinity of |
the citadel have been cut down, but the
botanical gardens remain. All food is
held at famine prices.

Would Proclaim the Whole Penin

LONDON, June 27. â According to a special dispatch
from Madrid published here this afternoon Premier Sagasta is
planning t<> provoke a crisis and to form a coalition Ministry,
drawn from the different monarchial parties, including Marshal
Campos and General Polavieja. The new Ministry will pro
claim the whole peninsula in a state of siege, re-enforce the gar
risons in the C'arlist and republican centers, and then appeal to
a friendly nation, probably France or Russia, to secure terms of
peace.
MADR I I >, June 27. â An important body, the Chamber of
Commerce of Barcelona, has notified the Government that at a

LONDON, June 27. â The Rome correspondent of the
Standard says: The Pope, disquieted by Carlist rumors, sum
moned one of the leaders to Rome incognito, receiving him
privately. The latter assured the Pope that the Carlists had no
intention of attacking the reigning dynasty, but were resolved
to combat any attempt to proclaim a republic.
The Pope lately wrote to the Queen Regent, advising her
on no account to abdicate, because to do so would be to encour
age the enemies of the dynasty.
LON1)Â«)X, June 2S.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph
s;iys; Spain Ls in a state of ferment,
of transition without parallel during
the present century. Troubles of the
gravest kind are brewing all over the
province. Every political and Bocial in
stitution is threatened In turn, and the
least nervous among the far-sighted
politicians apprehend a complete de
bacle.
But the failure of the national de
fense .is not countable for
this. Incredible as it may Beem the
majority of Spaniards take absolutely
no interest in the war and even display
a willingness to forget the past and t>Â»
endeavor to rub along- without colonies.
The statesmen responsible for the loss
of the colonies are utterly reckless and
the indifference to the people's ruin
.manifested by the governing and upper
middle classes is probably unparalleled
in history. Hunger and misery are
making themselves felt throughout the
country. There, will soon be 860,000 un
employed in Catalonia, and everywhere
else there are similar signs of distress,
going from bad to worse, day by day.
The Government is painfully con
scious and is now taking energetic
measures, but all of these are of a co
ercive character. Troops which might
have successfully defended the Philip
pines are being massed at all the cen
ters where starvation protests are
likely to assume an aggressive form,
â¢while money 1b being wasted on war
shl&j" tli&t will never fire a shot.
The press expects to be gagged, but it
unanimously declares that no amount
of coercion and no degree of dictato
rial despotism will hinder the country
from rising and manifesting its will
What is far more serious is the unfor
tunate circumstance that the dynasty
Bharea in the unpopularity of the Gov
ernment.
The people argue that repression is
being employed solely in favor of the
monarchy, which has remained abso
lutely passive during the terrible na
tional crisis. On my way to the palace
to witness the confirmation of the
young monarch I heard the expression
given to anti-dynastic sentiments of
the most uncompromising character,
which bode no good to the boy King.
In all other classes the same lack of
sympathy is unmistakably manifest.
"If Spain's colonies are not worth
fighting for," said one nobleman,
"Spain's dynasty is still less so. If our
soldiers were not sent to fight the Yan
kees we shall take care that they are
not called upon to shoot down Span
iards for the sake of an Austrian."

THE SA3S" FRAXCISCO CALL, ' iuESDAY, JUNE 28, 1898.
LINARES WILL MAKE
HIS LAST STAND ONE
MILE FROM THE CITY
Strengthening His Line of Defenses for
the Attack Which Is Near
at Hand.
Special Cnble to The Call and the Yew York; Herald. Copyrighted, IS9S, by Jamr* Gordon Ilennett.
WITH TPIE ARMY NEAR SANTIAGO, June 26, by Call-Herald Dispatch-boat Som
ers X. Smith to Kingston, Jamaica, June 27. â Although only three or four miles now sep
arate General Shaffer's advance column and the Spanish forces about Santiago, it is likely to be
several days before the assault upon the city is made. Owing to the bad condition of the roads
machine and field guns can be hauled to the front only with the greatest difficulty. Much of this
day has been devoted to this work and the guns now are well on the day to the advanced posi
tion held by General Wheeler. The work hardly can be completed for two or three days, how
ever, and an attack cannot be made before then.
Seven thousand American troops and three thousand of General Garcia's forces are en
camped within sight of Santiago and the American flag is still floating all along the way from
Baiquiri to the outskirts of the beleaguered city.
It is apparent now that General Linares will offer no serious opposition to the concentra
tion of the entire American and Cuban forces about the city. He abandoned his last opportun
ity for making serious trouble when he ordered his troops to withdraw from Sevilla yesterday.
General Linare^the American officers believe, is devoting all his energies to strengthening the
defenses of Santiago, both by land and sea.
From several sources the information comes that the Spanish general has a larger force at
his command than has been supposed. Conservative leaders in the Cuban army declare that at
least 15,000 Spaniards have been gathered at Santiago. It is asserted the city's defenses have
been strengthened to a marked degree and that the capture of the city will not be the easy task
so many have expected.
Thus far the Americans seem to be more in need of artillery than men, but it is believed
the composition of the present land force is due to a plan for the co-operation of the fleet. The
health of all the troops is excellent. All the wounded are doing well. General Shatter and his
subordinate officers are unstinted in their praise of both volunteers and regulars under fire. Our
troops have shown themselves to be brave, cool and eager, and the examples set by the officers
are worthy of the highest praise.
As I write this dispatch the band of the Seventeenth Infantry is playing Sousa's marches
on the heights of Sevilla, in full view of Santiago. Six miles away the city lies peacefully in a
most beautiful valley, wholly invisible from the coast. Envy fillls the hearts of the American
troops as they behold the delightful scene. It is the secret desire of all to possess this attractive
land and only a speedy advance upon the city will keep the men from becoming impatient.
The next fighting will be directly before Santiago. Our troops have swept all before them.
They took Sevilla sooner than they had expected to and without a struggle. Owing to the ex
traordinary energy of our commanding officers in pushing the men along, coupled with the eager
ness of the troops to advance, the American flag was raised over Sevilla during Saturday night.
In this village, where General Linares made his headquarters while the American troops
were landing, a desperate engagement was expected Spanish troops had been hastening to that
point from all directions for several days. It was the last defense between Santiago and Amer
ican troops. Despite its strategic importance, however, the Spaniards offered little opposition.
They fired on our troops for some time in a desultory way, but without effect. They then retired
from the village, leaving it for the Americans to occupy.
Our troops, after making Sevilla their temporary headquarters, pressed on to a point two
miles beyond and established themselves within four miles of Santiago.
The Spaniards halted in their flight at Canev, a small settlement to the northeast of San
tiago and on the right of our line. Colonel Wagner, who took his men two miles beyond Sevilla,
there found the extreme outposts of the Cubans on the bank of Seco River. This detachment of
American troops approached to within a few hundred yards of the Spanish patrols, who moved
along in front four miles from the city. He then learned that the main body of the Spanish
army is within lines only one mile outside of Santiago.
General Shatter's next order, therefore, will be to attack the enemy's trenches. These are
in regular trocha form. The brush has been cleared for a distance of iooo yards from the lines,
which consist of a series of small forts connected by deep trenches and barbed wire.
Five hundred Cubans occupy a position in advance of the Seventeenth Infantry, but the
Fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry are coming along to take the leading position. They started at
daylight from Scco River and will go close to the Spanish lines. Â«
At the present rate of advance it is quite probable that the two armies will get within
range of each other to-morrow. The Second Cavalry is going forward with horses and sixty pack
mules.
Under orders from Admiral Sampson, the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius continues to hurl
shells inside the fortifications, but the Spaniards are devoting themselves assiduously to repair
work and the Socapa battery on the western side of the harbor seems to be as strong as ever.
The reports are that both food and ammunition are scarce in Santiago, but no one hears reliable
information indicating that the Spanish are in desperate straits for food. There no longer is any
trouble about furnishing American troops with good food and water.
Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt, after carefully investigating, emphatically denied the report
that forty Americans were killed in Friday's fighting. He placed the number of our dead at six
teen, of whom eight were Rough Riders. Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt, who led the way and
seemed like a lion in the action, is most enthusiastic in his praise of his men's dashing courage.
BARBED WIRE DEFENSES
WILL CAUSE TROUBLE
Army in Need of Nippers to Remove
One Serious Obstacle to Its
Advance.
NEW YORK. June 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: "There
is one feature of Santiago's defenses
which does* not yet seem to have been
considered," sniÂ«i an army official to
me to-day, "and that is the twelve lines
of barbed â wire entanglement which
surrounds the city."
This officer has explored the whole
of Cuba, and speaks from personal ex
perience.
"To attempt to clear these barriers
with guns," he continued, "results only
in throwing them down in a way to
harass the mtn going over them. This
will be found a formidable obstacle
when the attack is made. The Cuban
Junta furnished their troops with nip
pers with which to force their way
through the trocha. With these the
wires were cut and the problem was
comparatively Blmple. The American
army to-day needs nippers more than
guns. I ascertained that no nippers
had been furnished our army and un
der present conditions my informant
says it will be difficult for the United j
States army to make its way over this j
outer defense. It is the opinion of i
many experienced army men that the
United States army will not be in a
position to attack before Saturday or
Sunday next."
An officer old in the navy expressed
the opinion to-day that if Santiago
were stormed the so-called defenses
would be punctured like a bubble, and
the Spaniards would take to the brush i
to the west; but on the c-ther hand,
said the army officer, it is more likely I
General Shatter will lay siege and try
the starvation process.
ARTILLERY NEEDED
FOR THE ASSAULT
Army Officers Realize That a Hard
Task Confronts Shafter's
Force.
ON THE RIO GUAMA, June 26, via
Kingston, Jamaica, June 27. â The ad-
vance force of the American army rests
on the stream with the city of Santiago
four and fi half miles westward In plain
sight. The top of every hill and moun
tain north and east of Santiago is oc
cupied by blockhouses, -whence the
Spanish can view the movements of the
American army as it advances beyond
Sabinella to the eastward of this city.
Gashing every knoll and bit of high
ground are Spanish entrenchments.
A correspondent from an elevation to
the right of the American line to-day
counted thirty-four of these entrench
ments completely fencing every ap
proach to the city. The trenches have
been dug as the conformation of the
ground admitted. Their ends overlap
where breaks in the line occur, thus
securing a comparatively safe retreat
from rille fire in case parts of the
trenches are captured. Upon one of
these works modern guns have been
mounted. They can be plainly seen
with the naked eye.
Spies report that inside the entrench
ments are four parallel lines of rifle
pits, shoulder deep, and in front of
them are marked ranges and several
rows of barbed wire fences.
No officer who has surveyed the field
over which the advance must be made
underestimates the task ahead of the
GENERAL "JOE" WHEELER, in the Advance With the
American Army of Invasion in Cuba.
Americans, although our boys still ex
press the most contemptuous opinion of
their adversaries. The general opinion
is that more artillery will be necessary
before it will be safe to attempt to
assault the Spanish works, as the fire
of the different regiments must neces
sarily be deadly and sufficient to de
moralize any force, no matter how bril
liant is its courage, when halted by
wire obstructions.
Some of the officers believe it will be
necessary to lay a regular siege to
Santiago and advance with a line of
earthworks until the ririe pits can be
shelled with shrapnel by the light ar
tillery. These processes have an ef
fective shrapnel range of 2800 yards
and the Mauser rifles in the hands of
the Spaniards are sighted to 1900 yards
and kill at 2100 yards.
However gratifying to the national
pride is the careless attitude of our en
listed men, the grave fear remains that
they may need a more severe lesson
than the ambush of the Rough Riders
before they can realize the deadly pos
sibilities of modern warfare.
The problem now confronting the
army Is the transportation of supplies,
for the roads to the front are still im
passable for wagons, but are being im
proved. In the meantime the pack train
is being used. The first of these left
Juragua late last night and others left
to-day, officers and men were
completely out of rations yesterday.
The Seventh received half rations and
to-day they receive nothing. The boys
are complaining bitterly, but are paci
fied with the assurance that the pack
train will be here to-night.
Should a night attack occur our
soldiers would fare worse than did the
marines at Guantanamo, as the attack
ing force here would not I â¢ at the dis
advantage of having to charge up hill.
The Cubans with the advance forces,
in spite of the good behavior of their
comrades at Quantanamo, seem to be
utterly worthless. All day "they sit in
the shade of their palm-thatched camps
and at night they smoke cigarettes and
gorge on Uncle Sam's rations, while in
sight of them Uncle Sam's boys, with
empty stomachs and riot a bit of to
hacco for their pipes, build roads all
day under the blazing sun and sleep on
their rifles under the starlit sky ;:t
night. The Spaniards are using brass
sheathed lead bluets and the brass
rips on touching and tears the flesh
horribly, while the small brass splinters
cause blood poisoning. Thoy are prac
tically explosive bullets and are used in
the Remingtons. They also out a small
cross through the end of the Mauser
bullet, so that it mushrooms on strik
ing, with a similar result.

OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, June 2G.
via Kingston, Jamaica, June 27. â It is
believed Admiral Cervera contemplat
ed making a dash out of the harbor,
toward the mouth of the harbmr,
late to-night. Four columns of smok â¢>.
were seen at sundown advancing
and two small boats, believed to be
t.orpe'do-boat destroyers, were observed
in the neighborhood of the sunken col
lier Merrimac. Consequently Rear
Admiral Sampson ordered extra pre
cautions to be taken. The torpedo
boats Ericcson and Porter stood very
close into the harbor all night, but no
ships came out.
Shortly after midnight the dynamite
cruiser Vesuvius fired thr^e sun-cotton
shells in the direction of fiforro Castle.
They exploded on the ridge behind the
eastern hills. The damage done is not
known.
NOT TO GIVE BATTLE

WASHINGTON, June 27.â One short
telegram received by General Greely
from one <>f his signal corps officers
with the army under Shifter w;is all
that came to the War Department last
night or to-day. That related entirely
to tlie management of the telegraph
and contained no news as to the move

assumed at the department that Gen
eral Shafter is simply carrying out his
plans of bringing forward his troops
i from the Bea coast and o'lieentrating
I them at points of vantage on the

KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 27. â Information brought
from Guantanamo by the converted yacht Hist, which ar
rived in Port Antonio to-day, indicates that the Spaniards
in the province of Santiago now are devoting themselves en
tirely to the defense of Santiago City. An official message
was lately taken by the Hist to all points on the southern
coast of Cuba at which American interests' are located. She
has spent much time off Guantanamo the last few days, thus
having an opportunity to get much information there. Of
ficers of the Hist report all quiet about Camp McCalla. Our
forces in that vicinity are carrying forward the work to
which they have been assigned. They are ready to advance
against the town of Guantanamo whenever orders for attack
are received. There has been no fighting about Guantan
amo Bay since the landing of General Shafter's troops at
Baiquiri. Our men have held their own about Guantanamo
and the Spaniards have made no attacks recently. It is be
lieved the enemy's strength in the vicinity of Guantanamo
has been considerably reduced in order that a large force
might be gathered by General Linares for the defense of
Santiago.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 27.â The Presi
dent to-day sent two special messages
to Congress providing for the recogni
tion of the services of Lieutenant Hob
t=on, the hero of the Merrimac: of Lieu
tenant Newcomb and his crew of the
revenue cutter Hudson, which rescued
the torpedo boat Wlnslow at Cardenas;
of Captain Hodgsdon of the dispatch
boat Hugh McCulloch, which figured
in the battle at Manila, and of Na
val Cadet Joseph Wright Powell, who
held the steam Launch under the bluffs
at Santiago harbor searching for the
crew of the Merrimac Authority Is
asked of the Senate for the transfer of
Hobson from the construction corps to
the line of the navy, and the President
announces that with such authority
given he will, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate, suitably ad
vance Hobson in the line. The Hudson's
crew is to be given a vote of thanks and
medals of commemoration. Captain
Hodgsdon is to be suitably recognized.
In his message as to Hobson the
President says, after quoting Admiral
Sampson's praise of the Merrimac
heroes :

NEW YORK, June 27.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following-: Whether or not Spain has
acquired the armored cruiser O'Hig
g\r.s, which sailed from England a few
days ago, ostensibly for Chile, is a
question which has caused the authori
ties no little perturbation since Satur
day last, when they received an un
authenticated report from their apents
in London stating that the O'Higgins
had been bought by Spain and was
under the control of the Madrid Gov

Santiago de Chile has been instructed
to ask the Chilean Government regard

If Spain has purchased the O'Hlg
gins, she has acquired what experts
consider the most formidable vessel o-f
her type now in service, and has
strengthened her naval force corre

Reports received at the Navy Depart

ALONG THE DEFENSES
Santiago Soldiers Terror-Stricken
Over the Attacks by the
Dynamite Ship.
OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA. June 26,
via Kingston. Jamaica, June 27.â Naval
Cadet John Hallllgan Jr. of the flagship
Brooklyn returned on board that vessel
last night with a large silk Cuban flag,
which had been presented to him for
landing the first boatload of soldiers of
the Invading army.
Commodore Schley. commenting to
night on the landing, said:
"It la the breaking of all records In
modern history to land such a number of
men, fully provided with all the necessa
ries, in a hostile country. I cannot
fathom the lack of Spanish opposition."
Commodore Schley thinks the Spanish
naval officers will, as a last >re.sort, de
stroy their ships by blowing them up.
A Cuban spy who was recently In San
tiago de Cuba says a reign of terror ex
ists among all classes there owing to the
nightly attacks of the Vesuvius with the
terrible explosion of her dynamite guns.
A week ago to-night one of her shells,
striking Cayo Smith, demolished several
warehouses and a fort there, besides dis
mounting several guns. Windows, it also
appears, were broken in the city and the
general effect was similar to that of an
earthquake among the soldiers and citi
zens.
FOUGHT WHILE THEIR
THROATS WERE PARCHED
LONDON. June 27.â A dispatch to the
Dally News from Port Antonio, Jamaica,
says: The conditions In which the Amer
icans entered the battle at Sevllla shows
that their fighting was really magnificent.
When attacked they were hysterical and
half out of their minds. All courage
would have been scorched out of less
thoroughbred men. Their tongues were
swelled for thirst and their throats shriv-
"Hell," said a. survivor, "has no terrors
for me now."
The Americans appear to be suspicious
of the insurgents, who could be of im
mense assistance in bushwhacking.
"Hut how can we be sure," said an
American officer, "that any one of them
is not a Spaniard, ready to lead us into
trouble? We can't talk their nigger Cas

to go it blind. We should trust them
completely or not at all."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, June 27.â The body
of Robert McMurray of San Francisco
arrived to-night from Graniteville, in
the northeastprn part of this county,
where he died early yesterday morning
of cholera morbus. In the morning it
will be shipped to San Francisco for
burial.
Mr. McMurray loft here on Friday
with a party of Nevada City friends on
a fishing excursion to the mountain
lakes. Arriving at Faucherie he was
stricken, probably from over-indul
gence in cold water on the trip, and be
fore a physician from here arrived on
Saturday night he was past medical
aid. Yesterday morning he was brought
back to Granlteville, where he passed
away before his wife, who left home
last evening and was hurried thrmmh
on special trains and carriages, could
reach him.
Mr. McMurray came to Nevada City
early in the fifties and was engaged in
lumbering and mining, being for a time
a partner of Robert Morrow and A. E.
Head. For many years he has been
manager for the Eureka Lake Com
pany, and was an owner in various Ne
vada County mines. Ten years ago he
moved to San Francisco, but retained
extensive mining and other interests
here, spending much time in the
county.
Mr. McMurray was well known not only
in San Francisco, but throughout this
State as well. He was a pioneer, having
come here In early days, and had always
been actively engaged In mining ven

PLACING OBSTACLES^
IN CAMARA'S WAY
Washington Protests Against the
Spanish Ships Coaling at
Port Said.
NEW YORK. June 27.-The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Every obstacle possible will
be thrown in the way of Camara's
fleet by the American Government. The
American Consul at Port Said has pro
tested against permitting the Spanish
fleet to refill its bunkers with coal
there. In addition instructions have
been cabled to Embassador Hay to
make proper representation to the Brit
ish Foreign Office. It is claimed by the
Washington officials that the coaling
of Spanish ships -U Port Said or Suez
both of which are British ports, will be
in violation of neutrality fur the rea
son that it would be making such ports
bases of operations against the Ameri
can squadron in the far East. By pre
venting the enemy's ships from procur
ing coal at either end of the canal the
administration feels that it will greatly
embarrass the operations which Ca
mara's squadron may be required to
perform.
If more than twenty-four hours
should elapse before the dispatch is
received regarding the protest against
the Spanish ships coaling at either
Port Said or Suez a second protest may
be filed by the United States against
permitting SpanlÃh men-of-war to re

THE EXPECTED, HAPPENS.
WHEN the news of the great sound money vic
tory in Oregon was under discussion at Wash
ington, that picturesque Populist, Lewis, is
quoted as having said: "We dragged the Repub
licans into this war, thinking we had digged a pit for
our neighbor. Now we have got it where the chicken
got the ax."
All free silver men are not as cynically candid as
Lewis. It was foreseen at the time that before long
some of the silver leaders would set up the theory
that the war is a part of the great gold conspiracy,
and that it has been undertaken by the administration
for no other purpose than that of enabling the gold
men to carry out their wicked schemes by distracting
popular attention from financial issues. That which
was expected has happened.
In a recent issue the Denver Times says: "The
Republican party managers, assisted by the full power
and influence of the national administration, are mak
ing strenuous endeavor to sidetrack the currency is
sue by a prolongation of the war with Spain. By
this means they doubtless hope to divert the public
mind from study of the financial question, and under
the enthusiasms of a patriotic war gradually wean
them from the bimetallic cause."
This cry having been be'trun it will soon wax louder
and become wilder and madder. By and by we may
expect to hear that the gold men bunkoed Bryan
into enlisting and then shanghaied him out of the
country. Such a campaign cry as that would make
many a silver district howl during the coming can
vass, and in all probability prove as effective as any
other. It i? a strange change, however, from the
assertion made by Bailey not long ago that '"this is
a Democratic war," and by Lewis that the Democrats
dragged the Republicans into it.
THjE MINING CONGRESS.
IT is gratifying to note that the Infernational Min
ing Congress which is to assemble at Salt Lake
City early in July is receiving considerable atten
tion in the East, and even in Europe. According to
reports it is probable delegates will be present from
all the principal mining countries of the world and the
gathering will be one of the most notable ever held
in the West.
The proposed congress is an outgrowth of the
gold miners' convention held at Denver last year.
That assembly was successful in so many respects that
it encouraged the holding of a larger assembly draw
ing its delegates from all parts of the world and repre
senting all branches of mining. At the congress,
therefore, the whole wide field of mining interests of
all kinds will be considered and the results can hardly
fail to be both interesting and instructive.
The assembly is certain to promote the movement
started by the miners of California to provide for a
better governmental supervision of the mining in
terests in this country. Although the United States
is richer in mineral resources than any other nation
in the world, and has a larger mineral output than
any, less has been done for the industry by our Gov
ernment than by many others.
The Denver convention, following the lead of the
State Miners' Convention in this city, declared for the
establishment of a Department of Mines and Mining
with a Cabinet officer at the head. The same course
will probably be taken at the coming congress. Cer
tainly it is time to provide for a better supervision
and regulation of the vast interests and industries in
volved in mining, and to bring about that improve
ment will be one of the most important considerations
with which the Salt Lake meeting will have to deal.
One of the evening papers presented a picture of
the departure of the third expedition which is worth
saving. It would not look well in an art gallery,
but as an addition to the curios in the park museum
would be hard to beat.
It can hardly be believed that Campos desires to
establish a dictatorship. He is about the only Span
ish statesman with a reputation for eanity, and he
ought to cling to it.
Even if the Merrimac does not completely block
the channel to Santiago harbor Cervera thought it
did, and the effect was about the same.
Unless the string attaching Camara's fleet to Cadiz
be pulled pretty soon there will be trouble with Ca
mara at the unpleasantest end of it.
"Despair rules in Havana," says the telegraph.
Well, there is necessity for rule of some kind, and
Blanco seems to be incompetent.
It would almost seem that the patriots already
reaching for rich jobs in the islands had chipped into
the game rather early. . , , -â_.
THE EXAMINER'S DEMOCRACY.
I"~*HE Examiner in searching for argument and
authority to back up its "great national policy,"
including the annexation of Hawaii, debts and
coolies, and the purchase of West Indian coaling
stations, creates what it wants and argues from it as
H the fact existed. Advising that the example of
England be followed, it says: * * * "England's
institutions are as free and democratic as our own."
This throws light on the Examiner's ideas of free
dom and Democracy. England maintains a state
church, supported by tithes, and not by voluntary
contributions. Of this church the monarch is the
head. It is true that there is religious toleration
and the coronation oath has a clause protecting the
independence of the Scottish church, as provided in
the Act of Union j/Oi. But all bodies of noncon
formists exist and are administered by voluntary act
of their communicants.
Again, England has entail and primogeniture.
When Jefferson, who used to be quoted as authority
on freedom and democracy, set up in Virginia his
working model of this republic, he separated church
and state, abolished tithes and put an end to entail
and primogeniture. This gave absolute religious
equality and freedom, and enabled the partition of
estates equally between the lawful heirs, instead of
entailing to the oldest son. According to the Ex
aminer. Jefferson was wrong, and a union of church
and state, primogeniture and entail are right, and
constitute institutions "as free and democratic as our
own." It has been held heretofore that freedom of
inheritance and liberty to acquire and to distribute
real property, and non-union of church and state,
were peculiarly the jewels in the crown of American
democracy. Perhaps the Examiner will now put
their abolition and a return to all that Jefferson abol
ished among the features of its great national policy.
England has a House of Lords, as the upper cham
ber of her Parliament. It is composed of Peers and
Bishops, the lords spiritual and temporal. These
are not elected by the people. They hold their of
fices by virtue of their birth. The lords temporal
are the beneficiaries of primogeniture and entail. As
such an institution is declared by the Examiner to
be "as free and democratic as our own," it should go
back to the policy of the Federalists and advocate a
Federal Senate, wherein the members hold for life
and transmit their office with their estate to their old
est sons.
The Examiner's idea of our Government is fur
ther expounded in the same editorial utterance, to
this effect: "It is in the power and right of Con
gress to devise any sort of system that may apply
to the conditions of such outside dependencies, and
th is power n in no wist hmited by the national con
stitution."
That is enough to make the framers of the con
stitution groan and shiver in their dust. The Na
tional Constitution, Article i, Section VIII, says:
"The Congress shall have power," and proceeds to
enumerate under eighteen heads the powers and
authority granted to Congress. Then, in the ninth
amendment, adopted by Congress at its first session
in 1789, is this: "The powers not delegated to the
United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by
it to the States, are reserved to the States respec
tively or to the people." Hence not even the widest
latitudinarian in construction of the constitution has
e\er pretended that Congress, or either of the co
oidinate branches of the Federal Government, can
exercise any power or authority not granted to it by
the constitution.
The Federal Government, created In that instru
ment by the people, is one of granted and enumer
ated powers, and is limited to those powers exclu
sively. The historic rule of construction laid down
by the writers in the Federalist, and followed to this
day, is that the Federal Government may do only
what the constitution grants and the States may do
nothing which it prohibits. The Federal limitation
of power is in the terms of granted authority. The
State limitation is in the terms of prohibited author
it}'. The Examiner jumps this all, and declares Con
gress to be "in no wise limited by the constitution,"
and that it can use powers and exercise authority not
granted by that instrument which creates it.
In the light of this monstrous proposition the
people may see what lies ahead in the annexation of
Hawaii. L T nlimited by the constitution Congress
may set up in the islands such labor system as "the
conditions require," a system at war with that given
to us by the same body. In this way the addition
of every such "dependency" will mean the adaptation
of legislation to tropical conditions and the need of
cheap and servile labor to compete with home labor
paid and living on a white scale and in temperate
zone conditions.
If anything were needed to alarm fabor here and
warn it of coming distress this Examiner declaration
supplies it.
THE CURRENCY QUESTION.
A RECENT canvass of the members of the House
of Representatives has disclosed the fact that
140 Republicans â two-thirds of the party
sticngth in the House â are in favor of taking action
upon the currency bill at this session. Upon this
showing a warm debate has sprung up in the East
upon the expediency of the suggested policy. There
are those who hold that the House should do what
it can to bring about the needed monetary reform at
once, and throw upon the Senate the responsibility
of delay. There are others who maintain that as it
clear the bill cannot be carried through the Senate, it
would be inadvisable to precipitate that issue upon
the country during the war.
The New York Mail and Express, a strong cur
rency reform paper, opposes an immediate considera
tion of the question on the ground that the financial
affairs of the Government have entered upon a period
of great and important changes. The national debt
is increasing, there will be some inflation of the cur
rency from the issue of treasury certificates and the
enlarged coinage of silver and the results of increased
taxation will have a modifying effect upon the finan
cial affairs of the country. All this may produce
monetary conditions a year hence which could not
be anticipated by any legislation enacted now.
The argument on the other side is that the public
mind is ripe and ready for the reform. The passage
of the measure would be the tactical and logical se
quence of the great sound money victory in Oregon.
As one of the earnest advocates of prompt action has
said: "It would be the occupation by the main
body of the position conquered by the advance guard.
Those of the people who remember the past and
foresee the future are urgent for the Republican party
to complete its work in financial legislation by the
permanent insurance of the currency system from po
litical attack."
The Call stands with those who favor action by
the House at once. If there is to be further delay
in settling this long vexed issue the responsibility
should be placed where it belongs. The busings
interests of the nation have suffered a great deal by
the postponements of monetary problem-, in the past,
THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 28, 1898.
and will continue to be harassed more or less so
long as they remain unsolved. The very arguments
used by the Mail and Express against action tell
strongly on the other side. Since the public debt is
increasing and the currency is being inflated, it is
time to place our whole monetary system upon a
sound and permanent basis.
A LESSON FROM THE NfIVY.
PUBLIC interest in the war has led the average
citizen to give closer attention to military and
naval affairs than has been his custom, and as
a consequence he is learning much. Out of the new
knowledge have come new ideas. There is a grow
ing belief that we might profitably apply in our civil
administration some of the methods of the army and
navy, and suggestions to that end have been put
forth in different parts of the country.
The Albany Argus, for example, has found what
it considers a good precedent to follow in the case
of Engineer Menocal, who, it will be remembered,
has been recently court-martialed for neglect of duty.
The Argus puts the case thus: "Instead of giving
his personal attention to the work, Menocal trusted
it to his inferiors, and employed such men as the
pressure of politics might put upon him. The pro
ceedings, findings and sentence in the case have been
duly approved by the acting Secretary of the Navy;
and Menocal is suspended from duty for three years,
on furlough pay only â and why? Because he de
liberately set out to defraud the Government? No
such evidence appears. The worst offense charged
against Menocal was neglect of duty."
The Argus maintains that there arc many officials
in charge of State or municipal work in New York
who ought to be dismissed as promptly as Menocal,
because they have been equally negligent. The as
sertion will probably go unchallenged. Certainly it
would not have been challenged in this State had it
been said of California and her various municipali
ties. It is therefore to be regretted, since the foun
dation of its argument is so sound, that the Argus
did not point out the means by which the removals
could be made, and suggest the body to be intrusted
with the duties of the court-martial.
A court-martial by the Board of Supervisors, by
a Grand Jury or even by a committee of the Legisla
ture would not be a spectacle to be proud of. The
actions of such a court-martial, constituted either
way, would hardly do more than add another funny
episode to the great farce comedy of American polit
ical life. It is better to bear the ills we have than
fly to others we know not of. We have trouble
enough getting along with the officials in charge of
the construction of the Hall of Justice under the ex
isting order of things, and it might be something
like the opening up of hades if there were a local
court-martial, as well as a Board of Supervisors and
a Grand Jury, before which we could hale the archi
tect and the contractors.
TREAT THEM ALL ALI^E.
ACCORDING to a contemporary Gus Smith and
Bob Jackson, two pea and shell game men,
were arrested on Saturday evening and locked
up. They were taken in by a detective attached to
the Police Department on suspicion of having de
frauded a resident of Fort Bragg of $10. This gen
tleman called at the* station soon after they had been
landed and identified them, whereupon they were
"booked" on a charge of robbery.
Of course, it is proper to commend the detectives
for the prompt arrest of these two pea and shell game
sters, but while withholding from them nothing that
is their due, we cannot refrain from inquiring why
they do not perform their duty in another direction?
It is notorious that Gavin McNab and his partners,
Gould and Alford, are playing a pea and shell game
upon the Democratic party of this city. Why are
they not arrested and locked up? Smith and Jack
son were taken in for defrauding a verdant gentle
man from Fort Bragg of $10. McNab has already
bunkoed 30,000 Democratic voters in this city and is
abcut to play the same game upon the entire Demo
cratic party of the State, comprising upward of 125,
000 men. He openly declares that he intends to ap
point one-third of the State Convention and to nomi
nate the entire Democratic ticket in this city.
Why do not the police lock up Me Nab, Gould and
Alford? That is the burning question. They take
Smith and Jackson in for stealing $io. McNab and
his two coadjutors have not only stolen the Demo
cratic organization of this city, but they are about to
steal a portion of the State organization. What is
the character of the thing we call justice in San
Fiancisco? Are small rascals to be punished and
big ones left to ply their nefarious arts unmolested?
A3 we understand it, the pea and shell game, as
played by "Whispering" Gavin, is irresistible. This
is to say, the Democracy is compelled to guess the
location of the pea. It cannot escape the blandish
ments of the wily Scottish boss, for he has it in the
door. Even if it were sufficiently wide awake to
beat McNab at his own game, that worthy would
finally get away with it, for he has control of its
organization and may resort to "raw" methods any
time he pleases. It is idle, therefore, to warn the
Democracy and suggest that it strike for liberty. It
is impossible for its voters to shake off the iron grip
which McNab, Gould and Alford have upon its
throat. There is but one thing to do and that is to
call on the police to arrest the three pea and shell
operators. Why should Smith and Jackson be be
hind the bars and McNab, Gould and Alford at large?
All pea and shell men should be treated alike.
It is hard to understand how the Government of
ficials can have the slightest excuse for the fact that
some of the men from Tennessee should be in need
of food or shelter. That celebrated "state of un
preparedness," which has covered more sins than char
ity ever could, is out of date.
Even the riches of the Klondike, whatever they
may be, are not worth trying to reach in a rotten

the reading public had better not ques
tion its veracity, for the Warden is a
dangerous man either in or outside the
prison walls whenever the truth of his
stories is called Into question.
One of the prisoners recently arrived
at San Quentin prided himself on possess
ing a peculiar inventive ability. His mind
was of that active sort that always
works on problems, both mythical and
actual. The solving of the Chinese puz
zle or finding the continuation of an ar
ticle in a yellow newspaper from one
page to another were labors which
aroused his particular delight. Warden
Hale recounts many interesting incidents
which show this belated prisoner to be a
man of intellectual achievements as far
as the analytic and synthetic operations
of the mind go.
The latest problem which has beset
him grew out of the great rise in the
price of wheat. That this sudden ad
vance In the value of wheat, far-reaching
in its results, should not weigh too heav
ily on the multitudes the prisoner whose
penchant is the solving of great prob
lems â metaphysical, mathematical or
economicâ began to work on the eccentric
puzzle of how to make a doughnut, util
izing the least amount of dough. The
reason of the selection of the doughnut
instead of other wheat-made articles the
"Warden charges to a preference of taste.
After many hours of concentrated
thought and a thorough and particular
investigation of all the latent possibili
ties of an economy in the manufacture
of the great 10-cent accompaniment of
coffee, the prisoner came to the conclu
sion that if he made the hole larger
dough would he savod and a boon con
ferred upon humanity. Still, this did not
satisfy him. Something there was that
was lackingâ that he neglected in his
categorical consideration of the problem.
More painful hours of calculation were
consumed and at last the mist was
rleared. The prisoner discovered that the

more dough it would take to surround it.

OUR UNDRESS WAR REHEARSAL
Is it pnssible to imagine any other
country engaging in war and then begin
ning to create an army? Against a first
class enemy the undertaking of this
would have been suicidal. "Wo have also
been taking State troops that are all
right for the local purposes of State
troops and have destroyed their organi
zation and discipline to make a nation
al army. And it has been almost as hard
to make a national army out of them as
it would have been to leave them at
home and recruit an army de novo from
fresh volunteers.
As a result of the very crude dress re
hearsal we have gone through in our
preparation of the part of respectable
military power, we have lenrned the les
son inculcated by Washington, that the
time to prepare for war is in time of
peace. As the result of our experience it
is not probable that we shall ever be
found again with a standing army smaller
than 100,000, and with it the machinery
for enlisting, training and equipping
many times that number of men. Muc-h
loss of time and waste of good material
have been incurred, but It will not be
wholly a loss, since the country will have
l^nrned to appreciate the fa"ct that it
takes as long and is just as technical and
professional a task to create an army aa
to build a ship.â Minneapolis Times.

SPANISH PRIDE.
When Spain lost Its South American
colonies through their sucessful revolt,
nearly every one of them had actually
overthrown Spanish rule and set up a
government of its own which was offi
cially recognized by the other nations of
the world long before Spain would treat
with it as an independent nation; The
Argentine Republic, for example, was
not recognized by Spcin until 1542, Vene
zuela was not recognized until 1545 and
Peru not until 1853, notwithstanding that
all had maintained Independent existence
since 1825 or earlier, and had been receiv
ed without question into the family of
nations.
In this same connection It is significant
to note that the full title of the King of
Spain is for the most part an enumera
tion of a list of possessions that have
long been lost to that kingdom. It Is only
the Spanish mind that could find pleas
ure in recalling with such silly bombast
the glories of the past as if they repre
sented the power of the present But
such is the Spanish idea of dignity and
such is the absurdity which Spanish
pride Inspires.â Chicago Record.

THE DEATH RATE IN WAR.
When we see a regiment departing for
the war we commonly think of the perils
of battle the men are going to face. It is
these, indeed, that test their heroism, but
they are not their greatest dangers. The
camp and the march have many more
victims than the battlefield.
The Commissioner of Insurance of "Wis
consin has published a careful study of
the statistics of mortality In the Civil
War that is very Interesting and instruct
ive at this time. He estimates the whole
number of enlistments for various terms
as equivalent to 2,520.i:72 for three years.
The best attainable estimate of mortality
is as follows: Killed or died of wounds,
110.070; died of disease, 224,55Â»>; deaths
from accident and all other causes. 24.872:
total, 868,528, of 15% per cent of the whole
number of enlistments.
These figures give the death rate per
thousand for a three years' term: From
battle. 47; from disease, 97; from other
causes, 11. The annual average death rate
would thus be: From battle, 15.6 per 1000;
from disease, 32.3; from other causes, 3.6;
total, 52. It may be recalled for the pur
pose of comparison, that the average an
nual death rate of Philadelphia between
ISGI and 1565 was 24.43 per thousand. This,
of course, includes all ages, while the war
figures apply only to those of military
age, so that the comparison cannot be
complete. Even with this important dis
tinction, however, It is seen the deaths
from causes other than the enemy's
fire were one and a half times as great
among the soldiers in the field as among
those who remained at home, while the
deaths from battle were but 30 per cent of
the whole.â Philadelphia Times.
UNITED STATES AND VENEZU
ELA.
President Andrade of Venezuela, deliv
ering an address at the opening of an ex
hibition at Caracas, under the auspices
of the National Association of Manufac
turers, said: "At the present epoch of
our national existence I attach the great
est importance to this display of progress,
for it is a transcendent step toward the
commercial development of our republic.
The great nation of North America, in
that spirit of friendliness ever manifest,
has come to exhibit to us. and to offer for
competition in our markets, its perfected
products, and to show to us the results
of its advancement and powerful indus
trial forces. The United States is march
ing to the front, and we will strive to fol
low in its triumphal wake; we, a young
republic fully alive to the necessity of
progress; they, formed into a powerful
democracy, shedding light from the pure
federalism of their institutions over the
whole of America, and at the same time
Illuminating the continent with the flash
from their furnaces which are furnishing
to mankind the great and marvelous
works of an enlightened civilization. "We
Venezuelans owe a solemn debt of grati
tude to the country of Washington, and
while we open to its citizens our markets
for their industrial products we also ex
tend to them the right hand of fellowship
and a heart full of appreciation for kind
ness extended to us."
COLLEGE MEN AND THE WAR.
In the war with Spain, as in the Civil
War, it i 9 astonishing that so many col
lege-bred men have enlisted and are will
ing to enlist.
Occasionally we find an exception, as
in the case of Professor Charles Eliot
Norton of Harvard University, who is re
ported to have said that it was the mis
sion of the educated to minister to the
lower classes, and that of the uneducated
to do the fighting.
On the other hand, it is gratifying to
find such men as President Andrews of
Brown University, President Chapin of
Tufts College, President Schurman of
Cornell, President Patton of Princeton
and others equ?lly distinguished express
ing a willingness to go to the front.
It is safe to affirm that it is not a blind
impulse of combativeness that inspire^
such men, but rather that expressed by
Professor Albert B. Hart of Harvard
University when he said: "The interest
which the United States has in Cuba is
worth the price of war. It is not a self
ish interest, but simply a just and hon
orable obligation that the island should
be given the chance to exist under a civ
ilized form of government."â St. Louis

CRIME A-SEPOY-Sub.. City. The Cri~
mean war commenced with the declara
tion of war Nov. 1, 1553. Peace was de
clared Feb. 25. 1886. As to the Sepoy re
bellions there was one at Vellore July 10,
1806; one at Madras in ISO 9 and the on? in
India in March, ISST, when many native
regiments in the Bengal army mutinied.
DYNAMlTEâ Subscriber, City. Dyna
mite, as generally manufactured, con
sists of infusorial earth, porcelain earth,
coal dust, siliceous ashes or the like sat
urated with about three times its weight
of nitro-plycerin. When exploded it
leaves a white ash with little or no smoke.
It costs more than gun powder, but does
eight or ten times more work.
FOREIGN COINSâ W. 8.. City. The
English copper coin described. Issued in
1797 in the time of George 111. is one nf
the largest copper coins ever struck for
England. It is the kind that in its time
wafl known as a cart wheel. The selling
price of such is from 50 cents to SI. The
other piece is a Hamburg two-shilling

gineering, and art an<* science 01 war,

GUN COTTONâ Subscriber, City. Gun
cotton is a compound obtained from cel
lulose by treatment with nitric acid. Ex
periments have shown that gun cotton,
if gently ignited by a spark, in the form
of yarn smoulders slowly away; if by
a flame it burns up rapidly and if fired In
the compressed state by a detonating fuse
it explodes with great violence, even
when unconfined. While gunpowder does
not explode at a lower temperature than
600 F.. gun cotton has been knnwn to do
BO at 227. Gun cotton produces neither
smoke nor fouling when fired and does
not heat the gun so much as gun pow
der, though by the rapidity nf it 3 explo
sion it strains the barrel more.
GUERRILLASâ C. R.. City. The namÂ»
guerrilla was first given to bands nf ir
regular soldiery or armed peasants in
Spain, who harassed Napoleon's armies
during the Peninsular war frnm 1808
to 1814. The name is derived from tho
Spanish and means little war. The guer
rilla bands were led by bandits, who in
spired by hatred of the French and fa
vored by the hilly character of the coun
try, were successful on many occasions.
From Spain the name, guerrilla was
brought to Central America and thence
to the United States. Guerrilla bands in
Mexico and Texas were a source of great
annoyance during the Mexican War.
WHTTE CROSS SOCIETY-E. E. H.,

Light foot, D. P., Bishop of Durham,
England, in IRS2, the objects of which
werfl ?et forth in the five obligations that
the young men who joined it had to take:
1. To treat all vomen with respect and
endeavor to protect them from wrong
and degradation. 2. To endeavor to put
down all indecent language and coarse
jests. S. To maintain the law of purity
as equally binding upon men as upon
women. 4. To endeavor to spread these
principles among the companions of the
subscriber to the obligations and to help
his younger brothers. 5. To use every
possible means to keep the commandment
"Keep thyself pure."
TO CORRESPONDENTSâ The depart
ment of Answers to Correspondents is
always ready to answer questions of q-en
eral public interest, but it cannot under
take to guarantee an answer at a particu
lar time. Last week one correspondent
writing from the interior asked that the
answer be printed on Friday. The letter
of inquiry did not reach this department
until Friday afternoon. Another asked
in a second letter sent three days after
the first why the gut stion was not an
swered. The question asked was one in
volving questions of international law
that required several hours' research in
law books, and as the department has a
great many questions to answer it can
not devote hour after hour on any one
flay to securing an answer, but must de
vote such time to the inquiries of all,
and secure as many answers as
possible. Questions the answer to
which require a long research to obtain
are looked up at such leisure as can he
devoted to them, but none are unneces
sarily delayed. Answers are printed as
soon after being set In type as possible,
and if correspondents do not see the an
swer in print as soon as they expect they
should not feel disappointed.
MILITARY SERVICEâ M. X., City. In
case of war any nation has the right to
call upon its citizens. If such citizens
have taken up their residence in the
United States and have not become citi
zens thereof they would be in honor
bound to answer such call, but if they
did not feel inclined to do so this depart
ment has not been able to discover any
law that would authorize the country is
suing the call to come to the United
States and compel them to serve. Thera
are some foreign countries which claim
the military service of all their citizens,
and if they, after expatriating themselves
without having performed that military
service, should return to the country of
their birth, would he required to perform
that duty. For instance, Germany holds
that every one of its citizens must per
form military service. If such an indi
vidual, having left his country without
having performed that service, return to
the )ar.A of his birth, though he may have
become a citizen by naturalization he will
have to do military duty for a period not
longer than he would have had to per
form such originally, unless at the time
he left his country he was given a certi
ficate of exemption. By courtesy the
German Government allows a naturalized
citizen of the United States who owes
military duty to visit Germany for a pe
riod of four months, but if ho remains
beyond that time he is liable to he seized
and forced to perform that duty. Tho
United btates cannot protect a natural
ized citizen compelled in the land of his
birth to perform a duty which he neg
lected to perform before he became a
citizen of the United State*.

-tarted off for the docks. The boys
Of North Dakota had nothing but the
minutes until noon and a Few miles'
marching between them and thfir boat.
Their march from Camp Merritt began
at noon. The band of the First Montanas
led off and the troops in battalion forma
tion marched after. Lieutenant-Colonol
Truman led his men along- Point Lobos
and Central avenues to Post street, then
by Steiner street tfr Golden Gate avenue
and down by Market to the transport.
All along their march they were cheered
to the echo and given the same sympa
thetic gond-byes, the same kind treatment
and assurances of friendship that their
comrades had been given on the day be
fore. They arrived at their boat with no
doubt in their hearts of the strong friend
ship and sturdy interest they have won
from every Callfornian.
The steamer Valencia will sail about 8
o'clock this morning. All the men and
the pilot were aboard the ship last night.
The commanding officer of the troops re

CONFIDENTIAL ORDERS.
Major General Merritt Gives
Written Instructions to Brig
adier General Mac Arthur.
At 9 o'clock yesterday morning Briga
dier General Mac Arthur, commanding the
third Manila expedition, called on Major
General Merritt to receive his final In
structions, in writing, and which, It Is
natural to presume, were of a character
similar to those given to Generals An
derson and Greene, commanding, respect
ively, the first and second expeditions.
Of course, these Instructions were confi
dential and something in the nature of
sealed orders. The interview was brief
and, after a hearty handshaking, General
Mac Arthur went on board his flagship,
the Indiana, and at once ordered the fleet
to prepare to sail at 1 o'clock If possible.
It was about 2:30, however, before the
four transports were all mov.ng.
It was Impossible to get the Valencia
ready to sail with these steamers. The
North Dakota volunteers went on board
early in the afternoon and the steamer
will take its departure some time to-day.
Major General Merritt, with his staff,
will Bail to-morrow on the Newport. Yes
terday was largely devoted by the staff
at headquarters, in packing up docu
ments, books and office supplies and get
tir.pr everything ready to be put on board
the Newport to-day.
FOURTH EXPEDITION.
Troops Under the Command of
General M. P. Miller or H. G.
Otis May Sail July 9.
With the departure of the third expe
dition to Manila the next question of in
teri st to arise among the officers and
men at Camp Merritt is, When will the
fourth expedition leave and of what
troops will* it be composed?
There has been some talk of sending
all the troops on the next transports to
go, but this plan is not deemed feasible.
From excellent authority It has been
ascertained that the fourth expedition
will sail from here about the 9th of July
with either Miller or Otis in command,
and with Major General Otis accompany
ing the expedition. With the rebrigadlng
of the forces General H. G. Otis has the
Seventh California, Fifty-first lowa,
First South Dakota and First Montana
under his command. To this there will
likely be added the Twentieth Kansas, as
one of the four regiments of the Third
may be dropped and Colonel Funston's
regiment substituted. It is known that
Major General Otis thinks very highly of
Colonel Funston and the Twentieth Kan
sas has greatly improved since ho as
sumed command.
War Incidents.
The Red Cross Society of Berkeley pro
poses to give an entertainment on July
4 in Berkeley for the benefit of the Red
Cross. Upon that occasion the band of
the Seventh California will be present and
give their services for the entertainment.
Private C. B. Wheeler, Battery B, Utah
Light Artillery, who was left behind by
Captain Grant because of physical dis
ability and who since the departure of his
command has been with the Utah troop of
cavalry, was sent to his home in Ogdcn
yesterday by Captain Came. The men of
the troop voted to pay Wheeler's fare out
of their company fund, as he was here
without means waiting for his discharge
proper.
Sergeant James Kelly, Company F,
Eighteenth United States Infantry, who
sailed for Manila, and who was recently
tried by a general court-martial for leav
ing a post of duty while on guard, was
fined $10 and reduced to the ranks. The
approval of the court's sentence punishing
Kelly will be forwarded by General Miller
to Manila.
Private Harry Pepper, Company I,
Twentieth Kansas Regiment, who died at
the French Hospital on Sunday of con
sumption, was buried in the National
Cemetery at the Presidio at 5 o'clock yes
terday afternoon.
The Twentieth Kansas is still twelve
men short of its required strength, and
these men will be recruited in San Fran
cisco.
A sick soldier was taken off the Morgan
City just before sailing time. The tug
Annie was hailed as she was passing and
Captain Titchworth was asked if he
would take the man ashore. He agreed
to do so and Clifford Heath was put
aboard. The Annie then ran in to Mission
street wharf and Heath was takea to the,
Harbor Receiving Hospital. A cursory
examination was made by Dr. Stafford,
and he said it was a case of malignant
sore throat, which might later prove to
be diphtheria. Heath was later removed
to the French Hospital.
Dr. John Yost, a well-known and popu
lar young physician, has been appointed
assistant surgeon of the Eighth Califor
nia, the chief surgeon being Dr. Shiels.
Dr. Yost is the son of John B. Yost, a
member of the firm of H. S. Crocker &
Co.
Captain T. H. Mathew of Company D,
Seventh California, at Camp Merritt, wag
last evening presented with a handsome
sword by Sergeant Lee in behalf of the
company as a token of their appreciation
of his services. All the first officers of
this company were rejected and Captain
Mathews, a perfect stranger, was given
the captaincy and soon proved himself
the right man for the place.
DEATH CLOSED HIS KEY.
E. N. Cadwallader, a Well-Known
Operator, Dies While on a Visit
to This City.
Nothing ever shocked the telegraph pro
fession more than the news of the death
of E. N. Cadwallader, who passed away
while on a visit to this city on Sunday
last. The deceased was beloved by all
who knew him, and he was known
throughout the State and country as be
ing one of the most expert and popular
operators in the business.
He was familiarly known as "Cad" by
his intimate friends, and they attest his
goodness by being deeply grieved by his
sudden demise.
As Associated Press correspondent in
Stockton, he fulfilled the important posi
tion with tact and ability, and his loss
will be deeply felt by his company. He
was in their employ only two years, but
during that short period proved himself
a capable and conscientious worker.
Before accepting the position he occupied
at his death, he held important posts in
Fresno, Seattle, Los Angeles, Reno and
Salt Lake City. His touch was known
from one end of the country to the other,
and for smoothness and reliability he was
unsurpassed.
It was his wont to visit his friends in
this city on Sunday, and he was on one
of these little pleasure trips when he suc
cumbed to a hemorrhage of the lungs.
The operators conected with the Asso
ciated Press and Western Union Tele
graph Company have taken charge of his
body and many will accompany it to San
Jose, where it will be interred from the
residence of his aunt, Mrs. Emma Cad
wallader, a wealthy resident of the Gar
den City. The deceased was about 28
years old. ___________^__ â
ARRANGING FOR A
MAGNIFICENT PAGEANT
FOURTH OF JULY COMMITTEE
STILL HARD AT WORK.
Special Rates Offered by the Rail
roadsâA Splendid Military Dis
play Already Assured-
As the annual Fourth of July celebra
tion draws near, the committee in charge
has redoubled its efforts and is working
in harmony with a view to making the
122 d anniversary one long to be remem
bered in the annals of this State. The
committee has had but $3000 to prepare
a celebration, but it has already sue-
ceeded in making arrangements for a day
and night display that promises to out
shine all previous affairs of ita kind.
At the meeting last night, the men who
compose the committee showed earnest
ness and activity. Although little busi
ness was transacted a great deal of time
was devoted to a clear understanding of
each question as it was brought up. Ii
was decided that only legitimate bands
be engaged for the occasion. A com
mittee consisting of the chairman and sec
retary of the executive committee, chair
man of the music committee and grand
marshal will Inquire into the standing of
each band chosen, and see that it is prop
erly uniformed.
Colonel T. P. Robinson will furnish the
executive committee with a tug to view
the regatta the day before the Fourth.
The Harbor Commissioners will bo
thanked for their kindness in extending
the use of a tug on the same day.
Major General Otis has honored his
namesake, Brigadier General Otis, with
the command of the military on the
Fourth. The latter will review the pa
rade. The boys in blue were not ordered
to march, but asked and the Invitation
was unanimously accepted.
The transportation committee assured
the members that many thousands would
come to the city and enjoy the pageant,
as the railroads had offered special rates.
The North Pacific Coast and North Pa
cific will give one rate and the Southern
Pacific one and a half for the round trip â
allowing the visitor to remain over from
Saturday till Tuesday.
Two hundred leading citizens have ac
cepted the invitation of Grand Marshal
Alfred A. Borlini to act as his aids, and
! they, in conjunction with the Signal Corps
' and the First Troop of the National
I Guard will act as escort.
j Beautiful engraved invitations have
been prepared by the committee and will
soon be mailed to honored guests. A neat
ly type-written letter will be sent to prom
' inent residents asking them to decorate
j their homes and places of business so that
the line of march may be a continual
scene of color.

Democrats Arranged in

HARNEY FACTION ORGANIZED
THE CITY PARTY TO HAVE
HOME RULE.
Districts That Fought for the Dem
ocracy Ignored by the State
Body in the County Ap
pointments.
Major Harney, chairman of the general
committee of the Democratic party of
San Francisco, has named the following
working committees:
Campaign committee â Twenty-eighth Dis
trict, Lawrence Buckley; Twenty-ninth, Jo
seph Flanagan; Thirtieth, James O'Hea;

seph A. Fitzpatrick; Forty-second, E. J. Rey
nolds; Forty-third, Henry Neebe; Forty-fourth,

Committee on resolutions â W. I. Brobeck. Dr.
W. J. Gavigan, J. C. Saulman, J. A. Spinettl,

Frank Conklin. T. A. Burns. Peter McGlade,
Chris Reis-Jr., J. G. Fitzgerald.
Committee on registrationâ Fred Russell, W.
T. Pilkington, John O'Donneil, John Fennell,
J. L. Horget.
Committee on naturalization â Frank P.
Hughes. Thomas Harrison, James K. Colbert,
John Koopman.
Auditing committee â Samuel T. Kohltnan,
James P. Sheerin, T. W. McFarland.
The appointment of these committees,
particularly the campaign committee, is
indicative of the fact that a war is on by
the Harney faction of the local Demo
cratic party for recognition as the legal
Democratic party of San Francisco.
It will be remembered that at the lively
meeting of the Democratic State central
committee held a month ago, at which
that body adopted a report of a sub-com
mittee of nine appointing a county com
mittee of 100 members of San Francisco
as the local Democratic organization,
Major Harney protested against the ac
tion and announced that the San Francis
co Democracy would not tolerate any
such interference. In that committee of
100 the Democratic districts of the city
were ignored. There are nine Democratic
districts in San Francisco that have al
ways returned Democratic Assemblymen
to the State Legislature. These nine dis
tricts gave W. J. Bryan a plurality over
McKinley for President of 3551 votes. The
State central committee appointed from
these nine districts only twenty-seven out
of the 100 members of the county commit
tee. The other nine districts of the city
are Republican and have always sent Re
publican members to the Assembly as well
as returning Republican majorities for all
other offices. At the last general election
theÃe nine districts gave McKinley a plu
rality over Bryan of 4008 votes, and yet
the State central committee, in apportion
ing the county committee, gave a repre
sentation to these districts of seventy
three members.
"The evident intention of these attempted
dictators of the Democracy of the city,
says Maior Harney, "la to disorganize the
Democratic party. Their ignoring as they
have done the Democratic districts is con
clusive proof of their intention in this re
gard. The men who have concocte.l this
scheme know full well that tho only way
they can get hold of the Democratic ma
chine is to deprive the Democratic voter?
of any voice in the party management.
Tnc general committee oÂ£ the Democracy
of San Francisco over which I preside
proposes to go right ahead to call prl
mnries for the election of delegates to the
Siute convention and later on primaries
for delegates to the municipal convention
to Rc-minÃte municipal candidates.
"The Dcrrocratic party of San Francfs
co," continued the Major, "is recognized
by law, and no State central commit too
Composed largely of country mem!>er3 can
interfere with It, and the Democrats of
San Francisco propose that they shall
not. If the State central committee hrÂ».s
the right to dictate as to the management
of the San Francisco Democracy, then it
has the same rijrht to fnterfera with the
Pemocra'-/ of any other county in Cali
fornia. This certainly would be a danger
ous power, inasmuch as the State central
committee, as a rule, is controlled by two
or three men whose faculty is in gather
ing proxies from country members who
do not attend the meetings. This was
dpmnnstrated at the meeting of the State
central committee at which the question
of the San Francisco Democracy came up.
About thirty-five proxies were held by the
thr^e trustees. Alford. McXab and Gould,
whose offices as trustees are self-appoint

GIBRALTAR, June 27.â trans
atlantic steamer Alfonzo XIII has ar
rived at Cadiz from the Canaries and
entered the arsenal, where she is fit-
Ing out as a cruiser. I had an Inter
view with Martinez del Rio, a Texan

ped at the Hotel Paris. He passed as

Is not connected with any newspaper

partment with wonderful success, Join
ing in the hue and cry for so-called
traitors and supplying information to
the Americans. He had an interview
with Captain Aunon, Spanish Minister
of Marine, and contributed 200 pesetas
to the war fund. He was only suspected
when the fleet was leaving. He saw
the fleet off and sailed for Tangier on
June 17 and cabled to Washington. He
is now here. He says It is his opinion
that the third squadron is all bosh. The
Lepanto is the only good vessel. The
Ironclad Alfonso XIII is a thorough
failure, having been built wrong, and
is only useful as a coast guard.
He confirmed my views about the
Princesa de Asturias and the Porto
Rico. He leaves on Wednesday via
Marseilles. He adds that he cannot
discover the identity of the correspond
ent of the Herald, which he says is un
doubtedly the best-informed paper.

are ready for their armament.

Puig-Cerda, three torpedo boats and
the auxiliary steamers Meteoro, Leon
XIII and Montserrat, commanded by
Admiral Barrosa, has been "ordered to

Some of the vessels mentioned as
composing the Spanish third squadron
are very much behind the age. The

BLOCKADE OF
CUBA'S COAST
Every Seaport Will Be
Watched.
NEW SQUADRON FORMING
COMMODORE HOWELL TO TAKE
COMMAND.
President McKinley To-day Will Is
sue Proclamation Announcing
the Extension of the
Blockade. 1
Special Dispatch to The- Call.
NEW YORK, June 27.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: General Blanco and the
Spanish forces in Cuba are to be cut
off from every possible source of sup
plies. President McKinley will to-mor
row issue a proclamation declaring the
entire coast of Cuba to be blockaded.
This proclamation will be similar in its
terms to that issued by the President
on April 22 declaring the blockade of
Havana and other ports.
This action would have been taken
earlier In the war had the Navy De
partment enough vessels at its dis
posal to maintain an effective blockade.
Commodore Howell is to command the
entire blockading squadron, which has
been designated as the first squadron
of the North Atlantic fleet. His flag
phip will be the San Francisco, which
has been the flagship of the patrol
squadron. The principal vessels that
he will take with him are the Colum
bia, the Minneapolis, the Topeka and
the Princeton and all the torpedo-boats
which have been stationed along the
coast.
So certain do the authorities feel that
there is no danger of a Spanish fleet
crossing the Atlantic that the northern
patrol squadron, which has been under
command of Commodore J. A. Howell,
is to be disbanded and all vessels are
to go south, with the single exception
of the ram Katnhdin, which is to be
stationed in Hampton Roads and which
with the vessels of the mosquito fleet
under the command of Rear Admiral
Erben, retired, will be depended upon
for coast defense.
Cruelty to Her Child.
Mrs. Annie White, 11 Pollard place, was
yr-sterflay sÂ«nt to the County Jail for six
months by Judge Conlan for cru
elty to her boy, Frank. While drunk
early last Thursday morning she threw
the boy into the Btreet and he was plckea
up by a policeman. The case against the
woman's husband was dismissed, as he
proved that he was not at homo at the
time.

KEY WEST, June 27.â The chase of
a Spanish gunboat Into Cienfuegos
harbor on June 13 by the Yankee re
sulted in seven Spaniards being killed
and three injured, while the gunboat
was so badly damaged that she had
to be beached, according to advices just
received here. It is not known what
the name of the Spanish boat was by
any one of the officers of the auxiliary
cruiser, but the execution done causes
great elation among both officers and
crew, the latter being composed mostly
of New York naval reserves. The Yan
kee was not aware of the work she had
done until June 22, when a catboat
containing three Cubans was picked up
off Cienfuegos.
On June 20 the Yankee sighted a
Spanish merchantman off Casilda, but
she escaped into the harbor, and when
pursuing her the Yankee was fired on
by the fort and gunboat. She returned
the fire, sending in fifteen shots, and
although Blanco In a message to Mad
rid said that no damage was inflicted,
the Yankee's sailors are positive that
several Spaniards were killed, and that
much Injury was done to the fort.
Cruising near the Isle of Pines last
Saturday the Yankee captured five
fishing smacks bound for Batabano.
The crews were allowed to get to shore
and the smacks were then burned, be
cause of the difficulty of trying to get
them Into one of our ports.
CONFLICTING FBANCHISES.
SEATTLE, June 27.â There Is likely to
be trouble in the near future over the
building of railroads In Alaska. To-night
Paul Mohr, widely known on the Pacific
Coast as a railroad promoter, arrived In
Seattle direct from New York. He repre
sents the Yukon Railway Company, which
has received a charter from the Govern
ment to build a road from Skaguay over
the White Pass, a distance of fifty miles,
to an arm of Laka Tagish. Another com
pany, represented by Mr. Hawkins, has
procured a franchise from the Town
Council of Skaguav and is constructing a
railroad over the route which Mr. Mohr
claims had been previously accorded his
company. He will go by first steamer to
Skaguay, and he says he will take the
matter at once into the Federal courts.
OPPOSED TO
ANNEXATION
Democrats Are Against
the Resolution.
MANY OBJECTIONS URGED
CAREER OF CONQTTEST NOT THE
COUNTRY'S DESTINY.
Senator Stewart Alleges That Con
gress Has a Constitutional
Right to Take Hawaii by
Legislation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 27.â At 11
o'clock this morning the Senate con
vened and a few minutes afterward
adopted the resolution of Davis, chaJr
man of the Foreign Relations Commit
tee, providing that hereafter until fur
ther action shall be taken the Senate
convene daily at 11 a. m.
Consideration of the Hawaiian an
nexation resolution was resumed, and
during the session Clay (D.) of Georgia,
Roach (D.) of North Dakota and Caf
fery (D.) of Louisiana, addressed the
Senate in c-pposition. Caffery had not
concluded his speech when the Sen
ate adjourned.
The annexation of Hawaii would.
Clay insisted, start this country upon
a career of conquest which was op
posed to the true destiny of the United
States. He claimed that to make thÂ»
present war an excuse for the addi
tion of a colonization policy would bt
a violation of the declarations made in
the Cuban resolutions and would in
volve the country in tremendous diffi
culties and possibly ruin. He declared
that the United States had no business
to capture the Philippines, as the war
had not been begun for any such pur
pose.
Roach delived a carefully prepared
argument against the annexation prop
osition. He advanced the novel argu
ment that the United States should
not annex the islands, as their exist
ence was problematical. They were
liable to be swallowed up by the sea in
an earthquake. Roach maintained that
if annexation was to be .affected by
resolution, the proposition ought to be
first submitted to the Hawaiians them
selves for ratification. Any other
course would tend to destroy the very
foundations of our Government by a
subversion of this Government which
is based upon the consent of the gov
erned.
The messages of the President relat
ing to Naval Constructor Hobson, Cr>m
mander Frank H. Newcomb and Cap
tain Hodgson were read.
Caffery then began a speech In op
position to the annexation of Hawaii.
He said the policy proposed was dan
gerous to the safety and perpetuity of
the United States, and opposed to the
fundamental principles of the Govern
ment. He then entered upon a con
stitutional argument against annexa
tion, during which he was frequently
interrupted to answer questions.
In response to an inquiry by Faulk
ner Caffery said that he had never
known any nation to acquire foreign
territory by purely legislative act.
Stewart instanced the fact that Great
Britain had acquired parts oÂ£ India by
act of Pnrl lament.
"But the English Parliament is om
nipotent," suggested Spooner of Wis
consin. "Does the Senator from Ne
vada claim that Congress is omnipo
tent?"
"Yes, It is," replied Stewart, "within
the limits of the constitution." He
pointed out that the annexation of Ha
waii had not been perfected until Con
gress had taken action upon the ques
tion. In response to an inquiry by
Mallory of Florida Stewart maintained
the Supreme Court had held repeatedly
that it would not inquire into the ac
quisition of territf>ry. When the politi
cal power of the Government had taken
action the transaction was closed.
In resuming his remarks Caffery said
that if the argument of Stewart were
carried to Its legitimate conclusion it
would constitute Congress an absolute
despotistn.
At 5 o'clock Caffery. not having con
cluded his speech, yielded the floor and
the Hawaiian resolutions were laid
aside until to-mnrrow.
Allison called up the conference re
port on the Indian appropriation bill
and asked that it be agreed to.
Jones of Arkansas expressed the hope
that the report might be rejected be
cause of the provision which allowed
Indians to lease mineral lands on their
reservations. The report was rejected,
the special grounds of objection being
that stated by Jones and one stated by
Pettigrow, who insisted that the Sen
ate conferees should Insist upon the
free homes provision.
A bill granting a right of way
through the Indian Territory to the
Gulf, Chickasaw and Kansas Railway
Company was passed.
At 5:35 p. m., on motion of Davis, the
Senate went into executive session, and
at 5:55 adjourned.

Expedition.
PROBABLY TO PORTO RICO
RE-ENFORCEMENTS FOR SHAF
TER SOON TO START.
Fifteen Regiments Under Brooke at
Chickamauga Will Be Sent
South in Short
Order. _ a*
Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, June 27.âPrepara
tions for hurrying re-enforcements to
General Shafter and for the Porto
Rican expedition are progressing as
fast as possible. General Shatter's or
ders are to send back to Tampa as
many of the transports with his ex
pedition as he can spare. It was stated
officially to-day that General Miles,
commanding the army, would command
the next expedition which leaves the
United States. Just what this Is to be,
and where It Is to go, could not be as
certained.
The number of re-enforcements which
are to be sent to Shafter will be an ex
pedition nearly as formidable as that
which left Tampa two weeks ago.
After Santiago has been reduced and
captured by the American forces there j
will be an ample number to leave in ;
the province to preserve order and to
hold the place, while the remainder
may be used for the Porto Rican ex
pedition.
The officials at the War Department
decline to-day to indicate where the
fifteen regiments which General Brooke,
commanding at Chickamauga, has been
requested to have in readiness to move
would be sent. Fernandina, Fla.. has
been put in readiness for a large num
ber of men, and it may be the Chicka
mauga men will go there. At Miami,
further down the coast, there are about
six regiments, while at Tampa, on the
Gulf coast, there are approximately
12,000 men.
CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL MILI
TARY PARK, June 27.â At Camp
Thomas to-day all interest centers in
the preparations of fifteen of the regi
ments to get away to Cuba. The work
of supplying all the needs of these regi
ments, begun yesterday afternoon, con
tinues rapidly to-day, and such good
progress is bc-ing made that every one
of the fifteen is expected to be fully
supplied by to-morrow. It is not known
just when the movement will begin, as
General Brooke as yet has issued no or
ders except the one for immediate prep
arations. The indications are, however,
that the first to go will get out Wednes
day. The two railroads leading from
here to the Florida coast have scores of
locomotives and hundreds of cars in
waiting, and can handle the men rap
idly.
The fifteen regiments under orders
are the best trained and best equipped
at the camp. They are the Eighth Mas
sachusetts, Sixteenth Pennsylvania,
First West Virginia, Fifth Illinois, One
Hundred and Sixtieth Indiana, First
New Hampshire, Fourth Ohio, Thirty
first Michigan, Third Wisconsin, Second
Wisconsin, One Hundred and Fifty
eighth Indiana. Fourth Pennsylvania,
First Georgia and Twelfth New York.
The officers who will command the
brigades under orders to proceed from
Camp Thomas to Cuba are as follows:
General Earnest. First Brigade, First
Division: General Stanger, Second Bri
gade. First Division; General Wiley,
Third Brigade, First Division; Colonel
Gardner. First Brigade, Second Di

The Hall of Justice building may be yet

the absence of which they claim has beeii
the cause of so much delay.

They thought that they might bo able

ROBBED BY A SOLDIER.
A Miner From Montana Sought
Friends and Fell in With a Thief.
A Montana miner visiting the city for
pleasure sought the friendship of a sol
dier from his own State Sunday even
ing, and after spending considerable
money on the boy in blue, was rewarded
for his kindness by having his purse, con
taining SCO, snatched from him by his
supposed friend.
John Evans, who has been prospecting
In Montana, met Private Burke, of the
Montana volunteers' band, on the Bar
bary Coast, and took him out to see the
town. Burke informed his new found
friend that he had just been released
from the^uard house for having been ab
sent from camp for a week, and offered
to show Evans the woman who had been
the cause of his staying away from his
duties. The two went to a dance hall
on Kearny street, and Evans was duly in
troduced to the woman, and the party
proceeded to have a good time at Evans'
expense.
When all were a trifle the worse fov
liquor Evans went to a small room in
the hall whore he was followed by Burke,
who snatched a buckskin purse from
him and ran out of place. Evans
notified Burkes officers of the robbery
and they are on the lookout for the sol
dier. The robbed man also informed thi.
police and will swear out a warrant for
Burkes arrest this morning.

from Boston with money to burn. He has
burned it all and had stayed at the
Grand Hotel. Some weeks ago he was
sick and impoverished, and was F<mt to
the San Francisco County Hospital. He
there learned that he had consumption,
and he decided that lie might as well die
now as later. He had been drinking
heavily, and to-night, when the boat was
about half way across the bay. he took
off his overcoat and hat and threw them
overboard, jumping after them. He was
rescued by the ferry-boat f rrow ami
turned over to the police on this side. 11.
declares he will do the same thing again

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 28, 1898.
MARS IS THEIR PLANET.
Commodore, Ensign and Private Watson, a
Family, Defending the Flag.
From grandsire to sire and from sire to son the spirit of war flows In ttie blood of the Watsons. The most
famous of the family is the present Commodore Watson, who has been chosen to ride like an angel of victory
across tho Atlantic and raze the seaports of Spain. Commodore Watson's two sons now wear the uniform of their
country, and on a miniature scale they are attempting to repeat the deeds of their father.
Edward Howe Watson, the elder, is ensign on the Detroit, one of the ships in Sampson's fleet. He- Is very
well known in this city, having been stationed here when his father was captain of the San Francisco. He is a
graduate <"'f Annapolis of the class of 'i>s. The younger son of tho Commodore, James Thornton Watson, is a rrg
ular of the Seventh Cavalry, stationed at Fort Grant, Arizona. All the Influence his father commanded was insuf
ihltnt to obtain for young A'atson an appointment to West Point. He was a student in the University of Virginia
before be â¢ â¢"'â¢ Hi-- firm determination to follow the fortunes of the soldier was not to be shat
tered by the picture, constantly plae> d before his eyes, showing the impassable chasm with the officer on one side
and the private on the other. In a night he stepped from luxury into a private's shoes about five months ago,
losing his identity as the son of Commodore Watson and assuming the new characterization of Private Watson. It
is his intention to serve the two years' period required by law and then take tho competitive examination for a
commission.
The two sons of Commodore Wa'son are grandsons of Judge Thornton of this city and nephews of Crittenden
and Jack Thornton. Both of them aro well known to San Franciscans, a part of their early life having been spent
in the public schools of this city.
REV. DAVIS HAS
BEEN FORGIVEN
The Sensational Preach
er Will Quiet Down.
WILL NOT ANSWER CHARGES
DR. W. S. URMY THINKS A BIG
REVIVAL NECESSARY.
He Says the Methodist Church Is in a
State of Decrepitude â Other
Denominational Meet
ings.
Edwards Davis, the young preacher who j
Btartled church-goers in this State hy his
ited sensational actions, has sui
ed and promises to err no more. The !
actor-preacher has been forgiven by his '
brethren and the glad hand uf friendship :
has b< . n ex â¢ nded to him, and he is
again Lack in the fold.
The new condition of things was
brought about yesterday at the meeting
of the Christian Ministers' Union after a
long and deliberate discussion. For the
past month effort has been made to bring
him before a proper body and try him
for his peculiar conduct, but without suc
cess. Davis has always expressed a will
ingness to stand trial, but wanted spe
cific charges brought against him so that
he could make answer to them. The mem
bers of his old church refused to do this
and the matter was held In abeyance.
Davis squared himself Sunday by ac
knowledging his mistakes before the con
gregation of the Central Christian
Church of Oakland, thus smoothing his
way to reinstatement.
About thirty interested members, com
posing a committee, met in the Y. M. C.
A building yesterday and were called to
order by President T. D. Butler. Davis
was present and listened to by his re
lenting auditors. As a final action the
following resolution was offered and
passed unanimously:
Resolved, In view of the official statement
of the Central Christian Church of Oakland to
the effect that Brother Edwards Davis made
public (statement that the said church was
Justifiable in withdrawing from him on the
charges of disrepute and Immoral conduct, and
that he asked forgiveness and was received Into
their fellowship again, that we dismiss our
committee without attempting to pass Judg
ment on the case and authorize the publication
of this resolution as a final and official state
ment of the case.
An inquiry into the small increase of
membership during the year 189" was the
subject of Rev. A. H. Needham's talk be
fore the Methodist ministers yesterday,
and it brought forth a warm discussion.
The speaker said in part:
"Making all allowances for mistakes
that have been made in statistics and
other records it must be admitted that
we have made small additions. We are
settling down into the same kind of re
ligious life that emanates from many of
our sister churches. One reason for this
was the secular duties of the ministryâ
they being so many that it rendered it
impossible for them to keep well in touch
with the spiritual part of the work."
Rev. "W. W. Case thought that preach
ers did not stand firmly enough by each
other. "If one strikes firmly out and at
tacks some popular science he is not sus
tained in his neroic action. We need
more martyrs in the pulpit and few are
willing to be ground under foot in their
efforts to suppress popular errors."
Dr. W. S. Uriny said he believed the
church was in a state of decrepitude and
that a vigorous revival. should be insti
tuted such as was instituted by John
Wesley for the national church.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson considered that
the Methodist church was not under date,
but was the ablest factor In the world
for evangelistic work. "So far as being
a failure," he said, "the Methodists in
the last thirty-three years have out
stepped the Presbyterians. In the last
ten years they have grown beyond the
Episcopalians, and in the last nine years
beyond the Congregationallsts. This does
not look like death or dissolution." He
said the Bishops and . presiding elders
would always look out and give their ap
nroval and advancement to * those whom
they found progressive and deserving. He
was glad to see in the church a class of
young men better educated and fitted for
1 MissÂ° Lake asked the co-operation of
the ministers in religious - work at the
camp at Richmond. She said the sol
diers needed spiritual consolation as much
as social entertainment. The lady sug
gested that the Methodists erect a tent
fn tho Tennessee camp and J. W. Ells
worth who was present, offered a tent
and half the expense of fitting it out and
this offer was accepted. r < , _.. ;

FOUGHT LIKE A TIGRESS.
: Vicious Onslaught by Mrs. S. S.
Scott Upon Two Policemen.
Mrs. S. S. Scott, who lives on Bush

PECULIAR ACTS
OF JUDGE LOW
CASE OF ATTORNEY MAHONEY
NOT YET DISPOSED OF.
Although. Convicted Twelve Days Ago
by a Jury the Judge Has Not
Yet Imposed Sentence.
Judge Low nnpc-ars to he as change
able as the wind. One day he decides
upon a certain course and the next day
he is moved to go on an entirely differ
ent tack.
The case of Attorney W. IT. Mahoney
is an apt illustration. Mahoney was ar
rested on June 2 by Policeman W. J.
Smith for obstructing a street crossing.
The case was tried by a jury on June 16
and Mahoney was convicted and ordered
to appear for sentence June 18. That day
Mahoney's attorney moved for a new
trial, an- extraordinary proceeding after
conviction by a Jury, and the Judge
granted the motion, continuing the case
till Juno 22. When the case was then
called the Judge stated that he intended
to dismiss it, as the arresting officer and
Mahoney had shaken hands, but later he
changed his mind and again continued it
till last Saturday.
Saturday came and the Judge vacated
the order for a new trial and ordered Ma
honey to appear for sentence. As neither
Mahoney nor his attorney could be found
another continuance was ordered until
yesterday. When the case was called
yesterday a new attorney appeared for
Mahoney and he said he was not famil
iar with the facts in the case and, be
sides, as his client had not been informed
of the order to vacate the order for a !
new trial he asked for a further continu- :
anee till Thursday to enable him to he
in a position to insist upon the motion for
a new trial being granted. The Judge
granted the continuance.
It is nearly a month since Mahoney was
arrested and twelve days since he was
tried and convicted, and still he is not
sentenced and dors not take the trouble
to appear in court, as he is out on his
own recognizance. There is keen specu
lation in the City Hall as to what will be
the final disposition of the case after so
many twistings and turnings.
STEAM BEER MYSTERY.
Professor Wenzell to Analyze the
Beer and Edibles on the
Lunch Counter.
The mystery surrounding: the death of!
George Read early Sunday morning af- j
ter partaking of several glasses of steam '
beer along with his two friends, Victor j
Bergdahl and Edward Pearce, is no near
er a solution.
Yesterday Detective Wren submitted a
quantity of the beer, pigs' feet, pickles,
Saratoga chips and other edibles that
were on the lunch counter of the saloort
to Professor Wenzell of the- Board of
Health for analysis. The young men par
took of the edibles on the lunch counter,
and it was deemod advisable by tha police
to have them analyzed also.

to get him dischargfil.

Charles Rosenberg, who was found dead

CLUNIE GETS
A SETBACK
Judge Morrow Enjoins
the Commissioner.
HIS DISCRETION INDISCREET
NOT LAWFUL TO DECLARE THE
BONDS INVALID.
His Threat Was Made Without the
Limits of His Authority and
Must Not Be Carried
Out.
Insurance Commissioner Clunie was yes
terday restrained from carrying out his
threat to declare invalid the bonds of the
foreign insurance companies operating In
this State and from forfeiting their cer
tificates.
The decision was rendered by United
States Circuit Judge Morrow In the cases
of sixty-two companies against the Com
missioner. After giving a history of the
case with the progress of litigation on
both sides the opinion concludes:
"The duty of the Commissioner is part
ly ministerial and partly discretionary.
With respect to the performance of those
duties in which he exercises his discre
tion in good faith the courts will not re
view his judgment or restrain his action,
but the discretion he may thus exercise
must be a legal discretion and within the
limitations of his authority.
"He cannot act arbitrarily or capri
ciously or in disregard of all the rules of
law, and when he is called upon by a
court to answer a charge that his con
duct is illegal, oppressive and injurious,
he should be able to present such facts
as will clearly show that he is acting un
der authority and within the jurisdiction
of his office. It is true the defendant al
leges in his affidavit that in rejecting
the bonds offered and tendered by the
complainants and in holding them
to be insufficient and invalid he did
so after an examination and in
vestigation into the matter in the
exercise of the discretion conferred upon
him by law, but from the other facts al
leged by the complainants and not denied
by the defendant this allegation appears
to be in the nature of an opinion which
the defendant himself formed as to the
character of his own acts in the prem
ises.
"That there have been evils in the ad
ministration of the insurance law may be
admitted; that the defendant believes it
to be his duty to make the office of Com
missioner efficient and of substantial ben
efit to the public may be also conceded;
but it does not follow that he may adopt
any course or pursue any method that
will accomplish the purpose that he has
in view. The law furnishes the guide and
regulates the performance of official con
duct and will be construed as conferring
those powers only which are expressed,
imposed or necessarily employed. (Me
chem on Public Officers, section 51.) A
temporary injunction will issue in ac
cordance with this opinion."
GROOM IS BLACKLISTED.
I item Pugilists Will Not Fight
Under the Auspices of the
National Club,
unager Groom of the National Ath
; Club seems to be in very bad
- with the pugilists who reside on the
crn side of the big mountains,
'ter the contest between McConnell
McKeever the senior manager of the
ional Club, who is supposed to be a
omat in his own peculiar way, en
cored to, arrange a meeting between
winner and clever Tom Trace 3% which
est should attract more than ordinary
ntiun.
ex Greggains, who is looking after the
rests of McConnell, did not give much
mention to the nicely worded promises
iof Mr. Groom, but on the contrary he
I sought Billy Kennedy of the Ob'mpic Club
i and asked if a contest between McConnell
i and Tom Tracey could be held under the
j auspices of the Olympic. Kennedy replied
I that if he could make arrangements with
Tracey or his manager. Al Smith, a bout
i might possibly be consummated.
I Smith, on being interviewed, telegraphed
I to Tracey at Chicago and received the
i following reply:
"Having neard from my friend, Tom
Ryan, that Groom is such a good and
fair-minded man in every respect, I pre
fer to fight In some other club where less
soft Boap Is used on pugilists. If you can
arrange a match for me in any club out
side of tha National I will gladly consent
to fight McConnell under any conditions
you may agree upon."
Smith signed for Tracey with the Olym
pic Club, and the contest, which will be
twenty rounds, will *.c held on the even
ing of August 2.
Transportation was telegraphed to
Tracey yesterday and the clever pugilist
will leave Chicago for this city on Tnurs
day. McConnell is taking light exercise
at present and his trainer, Greggains,
although confident of McConnell's suc
cess, realizes fully that in Tracey his
charge will meet no easy game.

FAILURE OF THE
KLONDIKE BOOM
Transportation Compa
nies Suffering.
SOME ARE IN DEEP WATER
ALASKA - YUKON COMPANY'S
CBEDITOES MEET.
Travel to the Gold Fields Has Fallen
Away Tremendously and Conse
quently Many People "Will
Lose Money.
The failure of the Klondike boom Is
playing havoc with the companies that
went into the Yukon transportation busi
ness. Swiftwater Bill's venture was tho
first to go into eclipse, and now the
Alaska-Yukon Transportation Company
has been compelled to meet its credi
tors.
When the rush to Dawsnn began last
year the Alaska-Yukon Company came
into existence. H. J. Barling was chosen
president, and associated with him aro
S. F. Weeks of the S. F. Weeks Com
pany, Captain Hatfield, who resigned his
command of the British ship Lancing to
join the venture; Walter J. Scammell.
James Eva and others. They chartered
the steamers National City and Albion,
II the bark Rufus E. Wood and con
cted for four river steamers. One of
se, the James Eva, Is now on her way
to St. Michael, in tow of the steamer Na
tional City, and the Walter J. Scammell
Kiow at the Fulton Iron Works, ready
sea. Both the National City and the
ion have done well since they have
flown the Alaska-Yukon Company's flag,
and the Rufus E. Wood left here for St.
Michael with a number of passengers
and a full cargo. Had the rush to the
gold fields only continued all would hava
been well, but' as the passenger trade to
St. Michael is very light and growing less
every day the company thought it better
to come "to an understanding with its
creditors at once.
The chances are that when the steam
ers begin to arrive from the Yukon with,
the results of last season's mining
the interest in the gold fields will be re
newed. Millions will be brought down
in gold dust and nuggets, and the sight
of these fortunes will start the rush,
again. In that event it will be nearly
too late to go by the way of St. Michael,
and the travel will be again to Dyea and
Skaguay. Another meeting of all con
cerned will be held to-day, and it will ba
fn decided whether the river boats now
r'.y (.impieted will be held here until
t summer or sent to St. Michael at
c or sold. The Rufus E. Wood was to
kept at St. Michael as a receiving ship
passengers, and she will probably ba
ught home. The charter of the steam
ers National City and Albion can be can
celed at any time, and then if everybody
is willing the company can lie on its
oars until next year.
C. Dickey, who chartered and fitted out
the barkentine Catherine Sudden for a
voyage to Kotzebue Sound, went to St.
Michael on the steamer Humboldt. On,
his arrival there he will get together a
party of returning gold hunters to como
down on his vessel. After discharging
her passengers at the mouth of tha
Kowak River, the Catherine Sudden will
be taken to St. Michael to bring down,
the passengers Mr. Dickey has booked.
The steamer Dirigo and her tow, the
stern-wheel river boat City of Dawson,
are still In port. The repairs to the lat
ter's machinery have taken much longer
than was at first expected and now it will
be to-night or to-morrow morning before
she will be ready. The City of Dawson
belongs to the Swiftwater Bill company,
and many of the passengers on the Dirigo
bought tickets from that concern. They
spent nearly all their time for a week
past on Mission-street wharf waiting for
the expedition to get away, and their
patience is nearly exhausted. It is now
thought that a start will soon be made.
Twenty-one members of the San Diego
naval reserve arrived in the city yester
day and paid a visit to the California
boys on the Mohican. They will be sworn
in "at the naval rendezvous to-day and
will be sent to Mare Island to help man
the mosduito fleet.
The Railroad Case.
Clerk Chapin completed his testimony
yesterday In the matter of the suit of
the Southern Pacific Company against
the Board of Railroad Commissioners,
and Superintendent Curtis was put on thÂ«
stand to explain certain exhibits as to
cost of cars, etc. The taking: of testi
mony will be resumed this afternoon.

THE MIDSUMMER HOLIDAY.
CANNED SALMON IN ENGLAND.
The market for spot salmon continues steady
and unchanged, cays the London Grocers' Ga
zette of June 11. but the inquiry has shown
some Improvement consequent on the warmer
weather during the week. A meeting of the
British Columbia, salmon combination has been
held, at which the prices for the IMS pack
were fixed as follows: Unlobeled 1-lb flats
or "Fuuats " ISs (id for 400 to 500 cape lots,
down to 17s 6d for lots of over 10,000 cases; 1-It>
â¢â¢tails" 17s 3d for 400 to 500 case lots, and la
per case less for lots of over 10,000 cases; ft-lt)
flats 24s 3d, down to 23s 3d for similar quanti
ties- labeled prices for 1-lb flats are 19s, down
to ISs; 1-tt) tails, 17s 9d, down to 16s 9d, and
iZ-Tb flats. 24b 9d, down to 23s 9d. the prices in
each case being for the quantities enumerated
above. Prices for Skeena River are fixed at
Cd per case less than above prices, and Rivers
Inlet Is per case less. There is bo little fruit
left on the market to be dealt with that busi
ness appears slow, but this is entirely owing
to the absence of supplies, prices continuing
very firm. For the 1898 pack few canners will
fix a price, and those that are making con
tracts are only doing so at considerably above
the rates paid for last season's goods.
At a meeting yesterday the Produce # Exchange
voted to adjourn from Friday noon, 'July 1. to
Wednesday morning, July 6, over the Fourth.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 27.â character of the I
market for securities was very little changed
to-day from that recently prevailing. Rail
roads were neglected and with a few excep
tions drifted to a lower price level, the de
mand being Insufficient to absorb even the
email offerings. Meantime Individual special
ties were taken up and pushed forward inde
pendently to a higher level without regard to
the general tendency in the market and with
out influence upon it. There was a sharp drive j
against Sugar and People's Gas in the opening |
transactions which reduced their price nearly
sl per share. This was apparently with a i
purpose on the part of the bears to put a stop
to the upward tendency of some of the spe
cialties. But the industrial stocks continued to
be influenced entirely by individual causes and
both Sugar and People's Gas were allowed to ]
recover. Tobacco, Rubber, Spirits preferred, i
Pullman, Third Avenue and Brooklyn Transit j
all showed marked strength at one time or
another, the latter advancing to near 55 on
heavy buying in the final hour. There v. ? ere a
few exceptions to the heaviness in the railroad |
list, the Vanderbilts and Rio Grande Western !
showing some tendency to advance. There wa* j
also quite an active demand for Atchison pre- j
ferred at a email advance In price which was
explained by the later publication of the May
traffic statement showing an increase in the
gross earnings of $â¢*Â».'>, M 4, and in the net earn
ings of $233,297. Part of the dullness in the
market is attributable to doubt over the bear
ing of the new war tax to go into effect July
1 on stock sales, loans and exchange.
There was a degree of activity in bonds to
day and prices of railroad, mortgages were
generally higher. Total sales, $3,175,000.

London financial cablegram Bays: The stock
markets here remain steady, but the tone was
firm. The settlement money was very cheap,
and contangoes were low. On Americans the
average rate did not exceed 3 1 per cent, while
on Milwaukee and St. Paul the charge was less
than 2 per cent.
Prices of Americans here are generally high
er, but few purchases have been effected on
London account. Central Pacifies attract much
attention. Several riveting? of shareholders'
committees are being arranged, but nothing de
cisive has yet been determined.
A Dutch loan for Â£4,800,000 will be Issued on

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. June 27.â Damage reports from
excessive rair.s in that portion of the coun
try where harvesting is under way created a
bullish sentiment in wheat at the start. The
weather in Great Britain was unfavorable. j
Paris, Antwerp and Budapest complaining of I
continuous rain, and Great Britain joined
in the same complaint. In addition re
ports of poor yields, compared with previous
expectations, came from almost every uar
ter of the American winter wheat region where
harvesting had been completed. There was
considerable short interest in the market, and
the reasons for the opening strength being
found upon examination to stand inspection,
there was a general effort to cover. But the
same situation which induced the shorts to
buy checked the offerings, and with very lit
tle for pale there was lively competition which
resulted In better prices. Closing quotations
from abroad showed a decline at Antwerp of
2%c a bushel. This, together with some osten
tatious selling of July in the pit here by an
elevator concern. Bent the price down to 71c for
July and 66VÂ£c for September. The crowd was
short, however, and on some good buying the
market rallied quickly and closed near the
top for the day. July closed l>ic higher and
September lc higher.
It was a changing market in corn, with the
price improved somewhat in sympathy with
wheat. July left off with a gain of Vfcc.
Oats were steady to a shade higher at the
start, but prices eased oft later with the other
grains. The market closed near the bottom on
heavy selling by country traders. July de
clined ic.
Heavy receipts of hogs and the apparent ur
gency of some traders to get rid of lard de
pressed provisions. The close is at a slight re
covery from bottom prices. Pork lost 2ftc; lard,
6(&7 1 4c, and ribs 74c.

DECLINES TO
PAY HIS RENT
Dr. Woolsey Sues His Old
Friend and Partner.
ENGAGES FIVE LAWYERS
pB. DUNN ASKED TO PAY HALF
OF THE LOSSES.
War Has Emptied the Block and
the Senior Partner Will Exer
cise Patience No
More.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 27.
The spirit of the war has made itself
felt In the doctors' block at Twelfth and
Broadway. This afternoon Dr. EL li.
Woolsey filed a suit which shows that
the long standing friendship between him
and Dr. J. H. P. Dunn, health officer ana
Burgeon of the Fifth Infantry, has ended.
Dr. "Woolsey desires Dr. Dunn to pay
him $1534 45, which he declares is due as
the result of their mutual losses in try-
Ing to act as joint landlords of the build-
Ing where they have so long done busi
ness.
In December, I^9l. Dr. Woolsey leased
the upper portion of the building, and did
very well as sole lessee until August,
1^95. In the latter year l>r. Dunn
It would be to his advantage to
partnership with Dr. Woolsey. The two
doctors agreed, and at once went Into the
business of office-leasing. Dr. Woolsey
was to pay fcvj for his ii;>.ndsome ol
Dr. Dunn was to pay Sin. The business
â¢went along for a year or two, and Dr.
AVoolsey paid the money on the lease reg
ularly, but, according to his complaint,
he did not collect as regularly from his
partner.
About three months ago the partners
had a quarrel and submitted the matter
to several attorneys and it was patched
up. More reci ntly the patriotic spirit !);'.?>
struck the doctors, and as a result the
building at Twelfth and Broadway Is
tiai'y deserted and will probably be more
ao before long. Dr. Travers has gone to
war: Dr. Ludlow has also gone; Dr. l!;im
lin is hoping to get away every week,
while Dr. Dunn is considerably ai
that he was not appointed surgeon of the
Eighth California Volunteers. This
pect of having empty Offices on hand has
evidently forced the issue, for Dr.
Bey states that Dr. Dunn is liable for
his own unpaid office rent and half the
losses in addition.
Dr. Dunn, it appears, is $120 behind with
his rent, and ] ">r. Woolsey alleges that
since the partnership was formed he has
epent $11,1*..3. and taken in onlj â¢*â¢
According to this view of the case Dr.
Dunn is liable altogether tor 11534. Is
legal ability can secure the paym< I
this money Dr. Woolsey Bhould feel quite
easy, for his attorneys are Messrs. Reed
<<- Xusbaumer, while W. W. Foote, George
W. Baker and Hart H. North appear as
of counsel.
CONSTABLE HITCHCOCK
IS NOT A SCHEMER
DENIES THAT HE SHOOTS TO
CREATE FEAR.
Residents at Piedmont Start Humors
That May Be Ventilated in an
Action for Damages.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, June
Some of the residents of Piedmont and
Deputy Constable Hitchcock are just
now engaged in a controversy which pos
sesses many unique At pres
ent the residents, headed by Ri-
Garnett. are talking among them
and occasionally to the newspaper men,
while Mr. Hitchcock is talking to law
yers, and hints at the possibility of dam
age suits.
Hitchcock is a Deputy Sheriff and spe
cial officer at Piedmont. He depends for
his salary upon the voluntary payments
of the residents of his territory. Some
of these residents do not think they are
in need of any special protection, and
they are convoying the impression that
Mr. Hitchcock is attempting to impress
them with the idea that BUch prot<
Js a necessity if they' value th- ir lives
and property. On several occasions with
in the past three months .stray shots
have been heard around the vicinity of
Mr. Garnett's house. The morning after
the shooting, bo it is paid. Mr. Hitchcock
roes around to collect. A few days ago
Mr. Garnett reported to the police that
an attempt had been made to shoot him
by a big fellow, who escaped when Gar
nett went to the door. Hitchcock be
lieves that Garnett intended to convey
the impression that be did the shooting,
and has consulted Attorneys Reed & Nua
baumcr about .the matter.
The general impression among some of
the residents is that the firing is done as
a ruse to make it appear that burglars
and other desperate characters are
around, and that special protection is
necessary. Hitchcock indignantly denies
this suggestion, and took two little boys
before the Chief of Police who Btated
that they were responsible f<>r the shoot
ing by exploding some, torpedoes. Gar
nett and his neighbors scout any su-.h
theory and declare that they have heard
genuine shots, and believe that they arÂ«
the victims of a ruse more than of des
perate characters.
Hitchcock declares that Garnett Is op
posing him because he has asked for a
email contribution toward supporting the
special officer. He denies all insinuations
and says that at the time Garnett re
ports he heard the shooting and saw the
tall man disappear over his back fenco
he was over a mile from the place. The
matter is being Investigated and is creat
ing great Interest in Piedmont. Many <,t
the residents are prepared to support
Hitchcock's character, while some are
not positive in their own minds as to the
best course to pursue.
Purpose of a Civic Club.
OAKLAND, June 27.â Mrs. Emma Shat
ter Howard has published a circular in
which she advocates the establishment of
a public board whose duty It shall be to
devote itself entirely to the beautifying of
the city. She is a leading member of the
Civic Club, just incorporated, and in her
circular says:
'! The Civic Club of Oakland has begun its
work under this conviction, and did not take
its name until .it had performed actual service
in behalf of clean streets, demonstrating the
hand-sweeping method to the satisfaction of
the merchants who helped to sustain t sev
eral months; also taking: the initiative In tree
planting around the squares and along the
sidewalks and in the "park- question in Oak
land. The Civic Club did not Incorporate un
â¦ll ready to put in its bid with that of others
.for the street, cleaning of the city. It calls
upon every man and woman and child for
membership, as well a* for voluntary and
active co-operation In its direct, simple and
"businesslike methods.

MANY SCHEMES PROPOSED
SOME FAVOR A COUNTY CON
VENTION AT ONCE.
The Multiplicity of Plans Shows
How Thoroughly All the Offce-
Seekers Are in the
Dark.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 27.
There is a movement on foot to try
to induce the Republican County Central
Committee to call the county convention
nnd got it out of the way before the State
Central Committee meets, and issue its
call for the State convention. Should this
be done it will keep all the fights apart |
and will result in two or more primaries, i
It ia now dawning upon this county
that there is a possibility of its wanting
too much. It Is one of the seven counties
in the Congressional District and one
of eight times as many more in the State,
and yet it wants the Congressman from j
this county as well as the Governor, not- |
withstanding the fact that it already has
the United States Senator.
This idea is causing all the candidates
for high offices to be very wary. Should j
gubernatorial and Congressional can-:
didatea unite it is realized that the com-!
bination might be beaten on the ground
that Oakland wants too much. For this
i reason Davis, Pardee, Hilborn and Met- j
j calf are all stating that they would like
to have separate primaries for State,
Congressional and county conventions,
and at the same time they are all trying
; to find out. whether it would be more ad
visable to combine or not. This condi
tion [b likely to continue until it is con-
Bidered too late for other candidates to
1 put up the cry that Alameda is selfish,
which time all kinds of combina
â¢ tions may be expected.
Among the machine politicians a new
â¢ proposition is put forward about once a
week. Not long ago it was solemnly de
' clared that the only way I i secure a
united delegation was by electing dele
! gates to the State convention at a coun
| ty convention specially called ' for that
purpose. A little later it was announced
that delegates to the State convention
would be elected from Assembly districts
and thla also was said to insure a solid
delegation from Alameda. Now another;
scheme la being bruited which is to hold
three primaries and three conventions i
and keep the different issues widely i
apart. Still another idea is to have an j
early county convention called before the j
State convention, so that there can be
no combinations between county and
State offices.
All these plans convey the Idea that
there is an element at work on the rule
or-ruin policy, and who clutch at every
Imaginary expression of public opinion to
hold its own. As a matter of fact, thia !
planning and scheming and rumoring of
how these questions of combinations or j
te primaries shall be settled are all
without foundation and merely the whims '
of the individuals who start them goln*
the rounds. Until the State committee j
meets nothing definite can possibly be j
known.
This morning Dr. Pardee said that he. !
Is in favor of any plan which will give
the nomination to an Alameda County I
man.
"If Alameda County sends two cand:- !
dates to the State convention she will aÂ»
usual get left and come h<->me with' hei :
political tail between her political legs," ;
said the doctor.
W. It. Davis, when asked for his opin
ion, said:
"We wish it to be distinctly under- j
stood that we have no choice of our own
in the matter of primaries. We are work- !
ing for one end and one end onlyâ the
nomination for Governor. We have al
ways been in the habit of obeying the
mandates of the properly-constituted au
thoritips of the Republican party In this
State and county, and we shall continue
to do so. If one primary is ordered, we
shall prepare for one primary. If I
half a dozen are ordered we i
shall accept the situation with equal good
grace. We are Republicans and have no
desire to sway or dictate to those who
are at the head of the party organiza
tion.
"It has been stated in print that we
have made a combination with Mr. Hil
born. Such a statement is absolutely un
true. We have never sought, nor are we
seeking any combination with anybody.
We are following the policy laid down
in the beginning of our campaign ana
shall not depart from it."
NO SALOONS IN CAMP.

Licenses.

SERVED ON A COiCPSE.
A Legal Paper That Needs Some
Explanation.
OAKLAND, June 27.â James K. Jeffress
may have to explain to the Superior
Court how he accomplished the feat of
serving a paper on Mrs. Mary Styles after
she had been ten years in her grave.
Henry K. Styles died in August, 1895. and
before his 'loath he built a house in North
Oakland. His first wife, Mary, died ten
years before that, and Styles married
again. JOst before his death suit was
commenced to foreclose a lien on the
house, and among the papers in the suit
which Is .now being -'viewed In court
Is the typewritten afli<*.tvit of Jeffress, in
which he swears t!' â â¢â¢ he personally
served a summons on Mary Styles, known
to him to be such party. A search re
garding the title brought this curious con
dition of r.ffalrs to light.

THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 28, 1808.
DASHED INTO
A LOCOMOTIVE
A Flying Train and Mad
Horses Collide.
ONE IS INSTANTLY KILLED
DRIVER SCHLEUTER ESCAPES
BY BEING THROWN OUT.
Runaway at Fruitvals Caused by a
Wheel Breaking From a Heavy
Wagon and Startling the
Horse.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 27.
A runaway team attached to a heavy
wagon dashed into a freight train at
Fruitvale to-nitfht and the life of the
driver was only saved by his being thrown
out before the collision.
The team consisted of a pair of heavy
horses drawing a large covered wagon
owned by the Grand Rule Bazaar. It was
being driven by Tunnie Schleuter, son of
the proprietor of the bazaar, a boy about
20 years of age. The wagon was return
ing from Fruitvale and young Schleuter
had driven a litilo out of his way toward
Alameda, He turned and was approach-
Ing the railroad track when the freight
train was coming westward-
Schleuter was about to rein in his horses
when one of ihe rear wheels of the wagon
came off. This caused the animals to bolt.
Schleuter saw his danger and pulled with
all his might, but was unable to control
the horses, who rushed wildly toward the
train. The train was rapidly approaching
and the animals were headed directly for
ihe locomotive.
The driven held on with all his might
and bravely tried to avoid the collision
that seemed to be inevitable. When about
a hundred feet from the train, which was
flying toward the wagon end on, young
Schleuter was thrown out and this alone
Bayed his life. The horses went on, and
a few seconds later the locomotive struck
the team.
The crash was so great that one horse
was instantly killed and the other badly
bruised. The pilot of the engine was em
bedded in the animal's carcass. The
wagon was thrown to one side and
smashed to pieces, the wreck covering the
animal that was not killed by the side of
the track.
The driver was picked up and with the
exception of some bruises and scratches
he is not hurt, and his escape Is consid
ered a miracle. Had he been thrown on
the track he would not have had time to
crawl off before the train was upon him.
Harry Asher was thrown from 'a wagon
to-night and taken to the hospital suffer
ing from concussion of the brain, but hÂ«.
will recover.

the City Trustees to be held this eveniajj
a proposition will be acted upon to appro

on Wednesday. Oakland has made a sim
ilar appropriation, and otner companies
that will go to Camp Barrett have been
presented with contingent funds by citi
zens of the towns whence they hail. It is,
therefore, thought only right to do some
thing of the same kind here. Trustee
Fletter will not be present, as he is absent
in the country, but he has been commu
nicated with and has replied by telegraph
that he is in favor of the appropriation
and would vote for it were he here.

dles was held at the Council rooms this
afternoon, at which a committee of three
was appointed to wait on the Trustees

HER EYE MOURNS DEAD LOVE
Mike Sullivan's Former Sweetheart
Punished for Politeness. â 
Maggie Lucas doesn't dust a chair for
Mike Sullivan any more and Mike won't
move his trunk up to the Lucas resi
dei cc.
Instead of petting her erstwhile sweet
heart and addressing iiim with endearing
epithets, Maggie nurses her wrath and
pets a black eye, while Mike cools his
heels this morning in the anteroom of
Judge Mogan's court, awaiting sentence
for battery, and a!l because there's an
other man on earth and Maggie bowed to
him.
Sullivan is a lineman for the telephone
company, and owing to his monopolistic
connections didn't want any other man to
walk on the same side of the street with
his best girl, so when he took Maggie
out to enjoy the beauties of the evening
last Sunday he registered such an em
phatic objection to Maggie's recognition
of a male acquaintance that the love and
friendship heretofore existing died and
Maggie's eye put on mourning tor the lost
feeling.
As the object of the bow from the young
lady was a man Sullivan felt that it was
much safer to exercise his strength and
display his displeasure on the girl whom
he was ready to swear to love, cherish
and protect, hence his appearance in the
Police Court and the absence of his hat
from the Lucas hall tree.
His picture has been replaced by a copy
of the order of conviction for battery
which was rendered yesterday.
In the Divorce Courts.
Ida J. Barrier was granted a divorce
from Joseph A. Barrier by Judge Bahrs
yesterday. The decree was issued on the
ground of failure to provide.
Mary Barabino was granted a divorce
from John Barabino on the ground of
infidelity.
Amanda Johnson was granted her ap
plication for a divorce from Oscar John
son on the ground of habitual intemper
ance.
Clara E. Ronald was granted a divorce
from her husband, Robert Ronald, on the
gro\ind of willful neglect.
Rosalie Jalbert has applied for a di
vorce from Sylvian Jalbert, alleging
cruelty as a cause of action.

digging coal. The great distance under the hills makes it impossible
for me to get pure air, which is forced to us by the aid of great *ans.
During breaks In machinery the air would become bad, causing first
great pains in my head, dizziness and fainting. This continued until
next was pains in stomach, indigestion and dyspepsia. Working hard
in the mines I naturally was a hearty eater until at last I had dyspep-

some, but should be eaten with the
sauce of discretion.
The apple is at the head of the list.
It is more easily digested than any
other fruit. But the skin . should al-
ways be discarded, for It irritates the
bowels.
Fresh figs are good, but dried ones
should always be carefully cooked.
Grate the pineapple, or cut it into
tiny bits, for its riber is tough, and re- i
sists the juices in the stomach.
The common banana is a deceptive
thing, and children should never be al-
lowed to eat it raw. Baked bananas j
are highly praised. \.
Never should the skin of any fruit be
swallowed. The skin is an armor for
the pulp. It is as unfit for food as a
piece of chalk is.
Whenever you have eaten underripe
or overripe fruit, and feel sharp, dart-
ing pains In the gastric region, you will j
find prompt relief in Duffy's Pure Malt j
Whiskey, taken in a little warm water. I
It is supremely important that the i
sickness caused by bad fruit should be
treated at once. The value of a good
whiskey in bowel troubles is urged by
the leaders In the medical profession.
Duffy's Pure Malt Is absolutely free
from harmful matter, as chemical tests
prove.

PANIC REIGNS
AT HAVANA
Troops Are in a State of
Starvation.
NOW READY TO SURRENDER
PREFER YIELDING TO DYING
FROM HUNGER.
Police Force of the Cuban Capital on
the Verge of Revolt and Are
Watched by the Reg
ulars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., June 27.â The most
authentic and reliable news yet ob
tained of the true condition of affairs
In Havana was to-day furnished in a
report to the Associated Press by a
British subject who left Havana on the
British cruiser Talbot, and who ar
rived here yesterday. He says a reign
of terror exists at the Cuban capital.
Captain General Blanco has Issued a
proclamation, announcing that any one
daring to express an unfavorable opin
ion of or suspected of being dissatis
fied with the present policy of the
Government will be summarily shot
â¢without trial or investigation. This
proclamation, it appears, caused dissat
isfaction among the members oi' the
orden publico, or police force, who
threatened to revolt if full rations were
not given them. It is expected that
as the orden publico is v numerous
body trouble will result. Its members
are themselves policed while patrolling
the streets, Spanish infantry and ar
tillery eoldiers maintaining guard over
them at every corner.
Famine, it seems, is imminent and
the stories of the arrival of supplies at
Havana, via Bataba.no, ure pronounced
to be untrue. The informant of the
Associated Press thinks Havana can
not possibly hold out six weeks longer.
The city is said to be panic-stricken, its
inhabitants expecting every moment to
be bombarded by the American fleet,
as they realize that Captain General
Bianco's attitude releases the United
States from the obligation of giving the
customary bombardment notice.
Riots are daily expected at Havana,
as the troops are suffering from hun
ger and the volunteers see their wives
and children dying of want. Un
der such conditions the captain general
cannot much longer keep the military
forces in check, and a rebellion is like
ly to devastate Havana before the city
is captured by the Americans.
Captain General Blanco admits that
the situation is desperate. He recog
nizes, it is pointed out, his inability to
control his troops, goaded by hunger,
much longer, and he is reported to have
said that he will never leave Havana
alive, as he is prepared to take his own
life when the outbreak occurs.
Senor Gal ban Rio, a prominent Span
ish merchant, the refugee continues in
his statement, had 5000 bags of flour
hidden at Gueniados, a suburb of Ha
vana, and was retailing it to the public.
General Arolas, the military Governor
of Havana, was informed that Senor
Galban's trucks had traces of fresh
flour upon them, and he caused the ve
hicles to be followed. The store being
thus disclosed, it was seized and dis
tributed among the ravenous soldiers.
Referring to the strength of the Span
ish forces, the Briton says there are
120,000 men under arms at Havana,
and that the greater number of them
are ready to surrender rather than die
of hunger. In conclusion, the gentle
man says he credits the reports that
the gunners at Morro Castle and at
other Spanish batteries were taken
from foreign warships and he says the
Consuls, including Mr. Gollin, the Brit
ish representative, are strong Spanish
sympathizers. British Vice Consul
Arastegoi, he continues, is a Spaniard
by birth, and a reporter for La Lucha,
the mouthpiece of the government. Mr.
Gollin, the British Consul General, he
further remarks, gave a dinner on the
Queen's birthday, at which all the
guests were Spaniards, and three Brit
ish subjects, prominent socially and
financially In Havana, were, it is al
leged, relegated by Mr. Gollln's orders
to the forecast!.-? of th" Talbot when she
left Havana because they were Cuban
sympathizers. It is said that as a re
sult of the energetic protests of the
Englishmen to the British Foreign Of
fice and to the Governor of Jamaica,
the Talbot will shortly return to Ha
vana with Mr. Gollin's successor.

Appointment of General Friedrichs
as Attorney for Alaska Ex
pected Soon.
WASHINGTON,, June 27.â The appoint
ment of General Frledrichfl as United
States Attorney for Alaska will be made
in a day or two. When Friedrlchs visit
ed the President in company with Repre
eentative Curtis of Kansas he was given
to understand the matter was in the
hands of the Attorney General. It was
learned at the Department of Justice to
day that Attorney General Grigga has ex
amined the papers in the case, and de
cided that the time of the incumbent has
expired and there is now a vacancy in the
office.
At last there is a fair prospect that John
Clyde Sullivan, paymaster in the navy,
formerly stationed at Mare Island, may
be restored to his former rank. His bill
for relief has passed the Senate and been
favorably reported by the House Commit
tee on Naval Affairs.

ANTI-ANNEXATION
LEADERS MEET
They Decide to B-esist Any Effort to
Further Extend the Hours of
Daily Sessions.
WASHINGTON, June 2G.â The leaders
of the anti-annexation movement held a
meeting to-day and decided that they j
would resist any effort to further extend
the hours of the daily sessions for the j
discussion of the Hawaiian question. They j
agreed to begin the discussion promptly !
at 11 o'clock each day. providing trmrs i
was 't quorum present, but they decided i
<o take a position against th-j extension j
of the debates beyond i> o'clock in the j
evening. , .
There were numerous conferences be
tween the representatives of the respective
Bides of the Hawaiian controversy, and j
several of the anti-annexationists prave
assurance that they had no intention of
conducting a filibuster. It was these as
surances which led to the amicable ar
ranxement about the adjournment of the
dav*s session. They have alsoeause.l tho
supporters of the resolut on to regard the
outlook as more favorable than at any j
previous time. No one, however, looks
for a conclusion inside of ten 'iayj. }

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 28, 189 S.
MRS. LOWE IS
PRESIDENT
Honored by Federation
of Women's Clubs.
INTERESTING SESSION ENDS
GREAT EXCITEMENT DURING
THE BATTLE OF BALLOTS.
Mrs. F. A. Eastman of California Is
Chosen a Member of the Board
of Directors of the Na
tional Body.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, June 27.â Imbued with the
most Intense excitement, precipitated
by the factional feeling In the Feder
ation of Women's Clubs, brought out
during the past twenty-four hours, 2000
women packed the Broadway Theater
to-day to proceed with the election of
officers. Probably as - a pacific measure,
Miss Cole read the One Hundred and
Third Psalm, which commands people
not to keep their anger forever.
Mrs. Henrotin, the president, ap
pointed a parliamentary committee,
consisting of Mrs. Shattuck of Illinois,
Mrs. Roberts of Ohio and Mrs. Osgood
of Maine. Mrs. Noble of Connecticut,
as chairman of the nominating com
mittee, presented the official ticket
headed by Mrs. Lowe of Georgia. Mrs.
Barnes, secretary, followed, presenting
the name of Mrs. Breed of Massachu
setts, and outlining her policy.
Mrs. Alice French of lowa fired the
first gun for Mrs. Lowe with a plea for
the South for non-sectional reasons.
Mrs. Mumford of Pennsylvania, Mrs.
Lockwood of Washington, Mrs. Toutal
of Texas, and Mrs. Cauger of Arkan
sas, followed with similar arguments.
Mrs. Jennings of Utah fought in an
effective speech for Mrs. Breed, where
upon, amid the highest tension, the
speeches were divided between the two
candidates. An effort was made to pre
cipitate a vote after an unsuccessful ef
fort to have Mrs. Lowe take the floor.
Finally the confusion arose to such a
point that it was decided to eject all
visitors from the house. An amend
ment permitted a solitary man, the
Governor of Colorado, to remain. After
one hour of oratory, the debate was
dosed, Mrs. Henrotin relieving the ten
sion with her pood-humored ruling.
Mrs. W. B. Lowe of Atlanta, Ga., was
elected president. The vote was: Mrs.
Lowe, 429; Mrs. Alice Ives Breed, 234;
Mrs. C. P. Burns 10; Mrs. William Tod
Helmuth, 2.
Other officers were elected as follows:
Vice-president, Mrs. Sarah S. Platt of
Denver; recording secretary, Mrs.
Charles E. Fox of Michigan; corre
sponding secretary, Mrs. C. W. Ken
drick Jr. of Pennsylvania; treasurer,
Mrs. Philip X. Moore of Missouri; aud
itor, Mrs. C. P. Barnes of Kentucky.
After the presidential ballots passed
Into the hands of the tellers the ex
citement subsided somewhat, and for
two whole hours the assemblage split
fine parliamentary points. Then Mrs.
Mumford, as chairman of the commit
tee on resolutions, moved that the fed
eration telegraph Speaker Reed at
Washington, urging the passage of
Senator Hoar s bill to preserve bird
life, which resolution was enthusiasti
cally passed by the birdleps bonnet fac
tion of the fair fashionables.
It was also recommended by this
body to the incoming board that at the
next biennial more time be reserved
for discussions and the evenings kept
free for social affairs. Along with this
recommendation came another one to
hold the next biennial in the South.
Dr. Mussey of Washington, D. C,
moved that the word "women" be
stricken from the title and constitu
tion of the General Federation of
Women's Clubs, and thus give the
sterner sex a chance to come in where
there are clubs of both men and
women. This was met by a buzz of dis
approval and lost overwhelmingly.
At this juncture it was decided that
any president serving two consecutive
terms should be made an honorary
president of the federation, which in
novation will make that honor possible
only to Mrs, Henrotin.
Mrs. Marie Remick of Chicago arose
with her resolutions deprecating a na
tional policy of conquest, which pre
cipitated a flow of patriotism.
By this time it was 2 o'clock, and the
ballots having been counted the re
sults were presented to the audience,
breathless with suspense. The an
nouncement of Mrs. Lowe's election as
president precipitated a wild hurrah,
which was properly squelched by the
presiding officer.
Following a forty-five minutes' lnter
mission the body reassembled to elect
the bonrd of directors, as follows^ Mrs.
Mary Lockwood. District of Columbia;
Mrs. Charles Morris, Wisconsin; Mrs.
C. S. Kinney, T'tah: Mrs. H. H. Pyle.
Connecticut; Mrs. F. A. Eastman, Cal
ifornia: Mrs. Frances Wood, Nebraska;
Mrs. William Tod Helmuth, New York;
Mrs. E. L. Buekwnlter, Ohio; Mrs. Har
riet Windsor, Town.
Thereupon were precipitated the
mooted questions of taxation and rep
resentation, which detained the as
semblage until 5 o'clock. The outcome
was the taxation of clubs at the rate
of 10 cents per capita and State federa
tions at the rate of 25 cents per club.
The affection which the club women
have for Mrs. Henrotln was evidenced
on every side. Her biennial address
was very interesting. In stating the
number of clubs in various States 11
gave California credit for 23, Oregon 7
and Washington 9.
Following this speech the new officers
were presented amid great enthusiasm,
resolutions commendatory to the reign
of Mrs. Henrotin were offered by the
committee on resolutions, there were
good-bys innumerable and the greatest
convention of women ever held had
come to an end.

I " It Is Better That Only One of Us

Scribner.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LAKEPORT, June 27.â The placid
waters of Clear Lake claimed another
victim Saturday night. The Misses Ada
and Nelson Scrlbner of this place were
on the opposite side of the lake at the
Sulphur Bank, and went in bathing.
Ada got beyond her depth, and as she
could not swim she went down. When
she came up the first time she called
to her sister, who swam out and caught
her as she came up the third time. Nel
son held her up for a few minutes, but
did not have enough strength to take
her to shore.
When Ada realized the situation she
broke away from her sister, say in j:
"It is better that only one of us
drown."
She sank for the last time.
Help soon arrived and thje body was
recovered, but life was extinct.
The remains were brought to Lake
port to-day and will be interred to
morrow.
SHOOTS THE MEN
WHO ROBBED HIM
China Ferry Citizen Pursues His
Assailants and Wounds Two
of Them.
STOCKTON, June 27.â A robbery and
shooting affair occurred yesterday in Sac
ramento County, Just across the line from
San Joaciuin, In which two men were
wounded. The man who handled the fire
arm is Fred Allen, a saloon-keeper at
China Forry, a mile below Staten Island.
Karly yesterday morning he was set upon
by three robbersâ James Hennessy, Thom
as Sweeney and S. Flemming. Overpow
ering the saloon-keeper, they robbed him
of his watch, but for some unknown rea
son did not succeed in getting his money,
although he had $200 on his person at the
time. After the robbery the men fled.
Allen then went to his saloon and, pro
curing his shotgun, gave chase. On com
ing upon the trio he blazed away at them,
and two of the three were hit. The rob
bers escaped for the time being, however,
but weTe subsequently taken Into cus
tody. Sweeney and Flemming were ar
rested by the Sacramento Sheriff and
Hennessy by Constable McCulloch of New
Hope, this county.
Flemming was found to have been
wounded In the head and in one of his
legs, while Sweeney was struck in the
hand by some of the shot. None of the
wounds are serious. Hennessy was un
hurt.

POLL TAX LAW VOID.
Nevada Legislative Enactment De-
clared Unconstitutional.
CARSON. June 27.â The Supremo Court
' to-day decided the poll-tax law unconsti
tutional. The act as passed by the last
Legislature made the right to vote con
tingent upon the payment of a poll tax for
two years previous to an election. The
law would deprive at least a third of
the voting population of Nevada of the
right of suffrage.
Registration was denied John Wilson, a
printer, and the proprietor of the Appeal
usked the Supremo Court for a mandamus
compelling the Registry agent to place
"Wilson's nnme on the roll. The decision
is very sweeping and annuls the entire
law as being contrary to section 6, arti
cle 11 of the constitution of the State,
which does not allow any additional con
ditions to be imposed upon the right to
register other than included in the quali
fications of a voter.

PHELAN TO
SKIP THE
SHORT TERM
And Then Run for the
Czar's Office.
SEEK OBLIVION IN TRAVEL
HOPES TO BE WELCOMED AS
A SAVIOR.
Will Escape the Third TÂ«rm Cry and
Try to Be the First Mayor
Under the New
Charter.
Mayor Phelan has an Idea, so large
an Idea that it has drifted away from
its source and is being discussed where
politicians gather. He is said to have
reached the conclusion not to be a can
didate for Mayor the next term. It is
to be a short term, and while he does
not plan to lay aside forever the Joys
of municipal office, he likes better the
term of greater length which Is to fol
low. Moreover, the short term will not
carry with it the honor of czardom. It
is to be but the connecting link between
local government under the consolida
tion act and the same government un
der the charter.
The Mayor's idea has crystallized Into
an actual scheme. He intends to go
abroad on a sort of triumphal tour. He
will thus get clear of the possibility of
entanglements. Such mistakes as may
be made in his absence will be no con
cern of his. While he fraternizes with
the crowned heads of Europe, San
Francisco will have to take caxe of lt
eelf. Of course it will make a failure
of this, and Phelan will come home
just in time to be welcomed as a savior,
bow to the acclaim of the multitude
and accept the nomination which he
figures will be thrust upon him.
There is still lively recollection of the
coming of U. a. Grant through the
Golden Gate aftor having visited all â 
nations and peoples and having been !
treated most royally. Here bonfires i
were blazing, bells ringing and Grant
was hailed as might have been a king.
This is the way in which Phelan wants
to arrive-. He thinks there would be
Bomethlng in it.
The analogy between the warrior-
President and the Mayor does not stop
Oae Bought a third term, and
failed to get it. The oth^r hesitates to
Beck a third term tor fear he won't get
it, either. Yet Phelan has reached a
determination to be the lirst Mayor
under the charter. It will be a pium, j
a pudding, and the combination ap
peals, li'- does not propose, so runs
the story, to ri.sk this political pastry
rving the bobtailed term which
is to succeed the present one. He is
Bald also to bo fearful that the Demo- j
crate are t<> be- defeated this time, and j
d^-s not rare to be bearing the stand
ard at the time it goes down. This ex
perience would be as fatal to his later
ambitions as the cry of "third term."
Altogether, the friends of Phelan are
Inclined to believe that he has been
thinking hard and reached conclusions
bulging with wisdom. They will pre
pare the reception for the contemplated
triumphal entry and trust to the grati
tude of the iirst czar Mayor for their
pay.

Intense and Everlasting Suffering
Almost Frantic with Itching
Four Doctors No Avail
COMPLETE CURE BY CUTICURA REMEDIES
I have been an intense sufferer of that awful,
dreaded and everlasting disease. Eczema, for five
years. I tried every one's advice in medicines,
besides four doctors, one a specialist in skin dis-
eases, with no improvement at all, and from time
to time setting me almost frantic with dreadful
itching. At last I gave myself up to Cuticdra
Remedies, expecting them to result as all pre-
vious ones. To my great and agreeable surprise
I found a wonderful change in three xeeeki, and
after using three bottles of Cuticura Resol-
vent and one box of Cuticura Salts, I found
myself completely cured. #

POOLROOM MEN AWAIT THEIR TRIAL
Warring Factions In and Out of the Sausalito Town Council Are
Resting.
SAUSATiTTO has again assumed Its former appearance of a quiet, self-respecting, seaside resort. For the moment
the poolroom men have, through stress of circumstances, abandoned it as a field In which to pluck the unwary
bettor.
The situation will remain unchanged until the trial of Bookmakers Humphrey, Broyer, Glynn and Schwartz. The
men were to have been tried before a Jury and Recorder G. W. Slmpton to-morrow. Owing to the difficulty experi
enced in securing a Jury the case has pone over for one week. The charge to which the accused muÃt answer will be
that of receiving sums of money for wagering on contests of horses, outside of a race track.
When the firm, of which Johnny Humphrey Is the head, was driven from San Mateo County the members cast
about for a new field of operations and hit upon Sausalito. They expected no opposition there as the Town Trustees
wert elected on the so-called "poolroom ticket." Under its platform it was provided to license all poolrooms at a tax
of $300 per quarter. Two linns availed of this privilege, Joseph Harvey and W. H. Harrison.
Humphrey and his colleagues desired to open under the same conditions, but were denied a license. Attorney A.
Sylva, who Is a member of the Board of Town Trustees and Its legal representative, in explaining the reason for this
refusal. Bays: "These people come here to create trouble. They erected a barn on the main street of town where all
people going to Old Sausallto were compelled to pass. Ladies had to press their way through a motley crowd of
cheap gamblers, touts, Btable boys and hangers-on about the local tracks. When they applied for a license we refused
It, the vote being four to one. No matter how the forthcoming trial may result they will never write a card In Sau
salito."
Ex-Marshal Creed, the good-natured representative of the bookmakers In their recent conflict with the deputy
town marshals, is of the opinion that the citizens having elected the Town Trustees on a poolroom ticket are now
reaping a whirlwind.
"When they voted to permit pool-selling," he said, "they did not name the number of poolrooms that could be
opened. They alleged at the time that they needed the money which the licenses would bring in. Now they want
to give only their friends the privilege.
"The poolsellers have hurt the town. They have given the place a bad name and in return the only persons bene
fited have been the saloon men and keepers of n-staurants. The money the town received from the pool-sellers has
all been spent in the employment of deputy marshals."
The wires of the Western Union Telegraph Company have been removed from all the poolrooms. The officials of
the company affirm that they have not yet determined upon their future actions in the matter. They may decline to
resume the service which they have rendered in the past, they say, irrespective of what may be the outcome of the
trial of the men.
The residents of Sausallto have taken but a passing interest in the fight, merely deploring the notoriety which
has been thrust upon the town.
REFUSES
TO GIVE UP
THE MONEY
Chief Lees Still Clings
to the Haynes Gold.
DEFIES ATTORNEY WILSON
ORDERED TO APPEAR BEFORE
JUDGE' HUNT ON FRIDAY.
The Head of the Department Is
Evidently Determined to Re
tain Possession of the
Amount.
Chief L.ees evidently does not Intend to
surrender the money his officers found in
the cabin of Haynes, the murderer of
lieutenant of Police Burke. He has the
amount securely locked in his safe, and
from present indications he does not in
tend to part with it.
When the murderous tinker was ar
rested, after a "show of arms" by the
"crack" rifle team of the Police Depart
ment, his cabin was searched, with the
result that $985 in gold was found secreted
under the floor. The policeman who dis
covered it turned it over to Lees, who
placed the amount in his safe.
Evidently anxious to save his neck,
Haynt-s employed Attorneys J. N. E. Wil
son and Eddie Sweeny to defend him.
Through their efforts he managed to es
cape with a life sentem-e.
A few days prior to being taken to Fol
som to spend the rest of his days the ec
centric tinker sent for Attorney Wilson
and offered him $25 for his services.
"That is all you deserve," remarked
Haynos. "If you had allowed me to plead
my' own case I would have been ac
quitted."
Without deigning to reply Wilson lett
the jail and on the following day he ap
plied to Judge Troutt to have him fix the
amount to which he was entitled for hi*
services. After Assistant District Attor
ney Black, Eugene DeuprÂ»>y and several
other members of the bar had testified
to the value of Wilson's services, the
court fixed the amount at $2<XX). As Wil
son has already collected $S0 from
Haynos, judgment was accordingly ren
dered for $1920.
Notwithstanding that Wilson showed
Czar Lees a certified copy of the judgment
he persistently refused to turn over to
him the money found in Haynes' cabin.
Angered at the seemingly childish obsti
nacy of the head of the Police Depart
ment, Wilson, yesterday afternoon, went
before Judge Hunt and had him issue an
order citing Lees to appear before him
to show cause why he should not re
linquish his firm grip on the money founa
In Haynes' cabin.
The order is made returnable on next
Friday, and a lively fight for the posses
sion of the money is expected.
Chief Whitney's Body Exhumed.

Chief Engineer of the San Francisco Fire

As there Is but little to engage the at
tention of the county committee at the
present time it was suggested by J. C.
Gardiner that the meetings be held here
after at the call of the chairman. The
suggestion was adopted. Charles H.

the committee, Thomas B. O'Brien act

THE TROTTEBS AT OAKLAND.
The Card Promises Lively Contests
Between Saturday's Winners and
Other Good Ones.
The new system of harness races Inaug
urated at the Oakland race track last
Saturday under the auspices of the Pa
cific Coast Trotting Horse Breeders' As
' s-ociation bids fair to be successful. Pro
fiting by the experience of that day the
â  management has determined to have only
twenty minutes' intermission between
races. Instead Of half an hour, thus insur
ing a short afternoon's racing.
Colonel Park Henshaw and his com
mand have beÂ«n Invited to attend the
meeting to-day. Colonel Henshaw is one
of the directors of this association and
has a string of fast trotters and pacers at
the track in charge of James Sullivan,
the well-known driver from Willows.
The programme of to-day's races con
tains the names of many horses that
achieved fame on the California tracks
last Hcason, but it would not be surprising
if their colors were lowered by some new
recruits for fame and glory in the turf
world.

FEARS HE
WILL TRY
TO KILL HER
Dr. Kienborts Charged
With Being Insane.
ACCUSED BY HIS WIFE
SHE CLAIMS HE IS A SLAVE
TO THE COCAINE HABIT..
A Grizzled Veteran of the Civil
War Locked Up in a Padded
Cell in the Insane
Ward,
Dr. D. Klenborts. a gray-haired veteran
of the Civil War, Is locked up in a padded
cell in the Insane ward of the Receiving
Hospital. Yesterday morning his wife,
who lives at 30^ Twenty-eighth street,
went before a Superior Judge and swore
to' a complaint charging him with in
sanity.
According to her story, she was forced
to leave her husband some time ago, as
Phe feared that he would kill her. She
also declared that he was addicted to the
use of cocaine and likely to commit mur
der when under the effects of the drug.
Mrs. Kienborts further stated that she
had received a letter from her husband
dated Stockton, in which he said he had
grown tired of life in Stockton, where he
went last March, and intended to return
to this city. Thinking that his object
in coming here was to wreak physical vio
lence on her Mrs. Kienborts concluded to
have him arrested for insanity.
A Deputy Sheriff, who was Intrusted
with the warrant, learning that Kienborts
had already reached this city, started out
to find him. After considerable trouble
he located him in a friend's house at 311
Broderlck street, and placed him under
arrest.
Kienborts offered no objection and was
taken to the insane ward of the Receiv
ing Hospital and placed in a padded cell.
When spoken to by one of the doctors
Kienborts denied that his mental facul
ties were impaired.
"This is a job to get rid of me," he re
marked. "I am not crazy. They want to
get hold of the little pension I draw every
month, and to accomplish their purpose
they have conceived the bold plan of hav
ing me sent to an insane asylum.
"Last March I separated from my wife
and went to Stockton, where I practiced
medicine. Longing to see my wife again,
I wrote her that I Intended to return to
this city. Why she should have me ar
rested for being insane is beyond my com
prehension.
"It is true that I have used cocaine, but
not to any great extent. Frequently,
when suffering from pains In the head, I
would dip a piece of cotton in a solution
of the drug and apply it to my nostrils.
It is ridiculous to say that I am a slave
to cocaine. I Intend to vigorously resiÃt
any attempt to have me sent to an in
sane asylum, and will show the commis
sioners that I am being persecuted solely
for the purpose of forcing me to surren
der the little pension I receive as a vet
eran of the civil war."
The doctors at the hospital are unani
mous In their opinion that Kienborts is
"FORT FRAYNE"
MAKES A HIT
The Columbia Presents
a Fine Comedy.
"BOCCACCIO" AT THE TIVOLI
"THE GOSSOON" CROWDS THE
GRAND OPERA HOUSE.
"Frederick The Great" a Success at
the Alcazar and Standing
Room Only the Rule at
the Orpheum.
The presentation of "Fort Frayne" at
the Columbia last evening was a gala oc
casion and a proud one, not only for the
author, Brigadier General King, but for
the Prawley Company and the manage
ment. The n^-iy was a success from the
start, and what with the waving of ban
ners, the old-time Union cheers, mingled
with the startling rebel yell, contributed
by pome of the Tennessee soldiers in the
audience, the presence of Generals Mer
ritt, Otis, Whlttier and King, a large
number of officers and boys in blue and a
crowded, enthusiastic house, every imng
went merrily as could be desired. At the
end of the first act when "Old Glory" in
heroic size came gracefully down in the
place of the drop curtain, to the music of
the "Star-Spangled Banner," the audi
ence arose en masse, and for several min
utes there was a most stirring scene in
which cheers and singing mingled with
the various patriotic airs from the orches
tra.
General King was called for, but de
clined to appear until at the close of the
third act, when he made a brief, well
worded speech of thanks, in which he said
he agreed with his old soldiers in Arizona
that there was "no place like home-^ex
cept San Francisco." This, he thought,
was proved by the reception of his humble
efforts and the able work of the company.
Everybody was happy and "Fort Frayne"
had a most auspicious introduction, which
promises a very successful run.
The play is picturesque, full of bright,
nlrasing scenes, with sufficient of the pa
thetic to give a sharp contrast to the rich
vein of comedy and humor running
through It. There are some tears, but it
Is mostly laughter, of the wholesome,
well-deserved kind, that follows the
catchy lines and harmonious situations.
Mr. Frawley as a lieutenant of the Na
tional Guard of New York has a line in
which he says "The National Guard is
where it ought to be â shoulder to shoul
der with the regulars." General King, in
his speech, said that the words were pro
phetic, as they were In the original lines
of the drama, as the two branches of the
military were now "where they ought to
beâ shoulder t<> shoulder."
The company Is deserving of much
credit for the excellent manner in which
the members carried their respective
parts, especially on a first night. Miss
Bouton as the unhappy wife of the dis
reputable soldier, had a part that gave
fine opportunities to show her abilities,
and she did this most capably, winning
well-deserved praise. Mr. Frawley was a
most admirable persistent lover and Sam
Edwards as Dr. Wayne, the wretchedly
absent-minded wooer of a delightful
spinster," Miss Lucille la Verne, afforded
much of the genuine comedy of the play.
Thomas O'Mally as the Irish sergeant
created genuine fun, and Mr. Roberts, in
the part of the noble redman, iltted the
character nicely. Mr. Wilson as the com- j
mander of the post. Mr. Hiekman as the
fresh young officer from West Point, and i
Mr. Burke as the degraded soldier, were I
very natural and acceptable. Mr. Bell, !
however, could not escape from his own
personality, and appeared to be the Prince j
lifted out of "aristocracy." Miss Maude !
Winters was charming as the willful and !
loveable youngmissand appeared to much
better advantage than heretofore. Too
much of the vixen in Fanchon Camp- j
bell's lovers' quarrel somewhat marred j
an otherwise creditable piece of work.
The old maid of Miss I,a Verne was a ;
finished character and decidedly funny.
Eleanor Carey as the widow of the for- :
nicr commander of the post presented the j
part very agreeably.
The theater was beautifully decorated i
with flags, shields and coats of arms, and
the management is to be congratulated
on the success, artistic and otherwise, of
the production.
At the Alcazar.
Lewis Morrison and the Alcazar Stock
Company grow in favor and each new
play brings forth a hidden star in some
member of the company. Last night in
"Frederick the Great," Frank Denithorne,
as Baron Frederick yon Trenck,
lieutenant of the ' King's own guard, madÂ©
a great hit by his rendition of the part.
"Frederick the Great" is a comedy in
four acts, and some liberty has been
taken with historical facts in order to
bring it within the scope of the play.
The happenings of twenty years are com
pressed Into less than, that number 01
months for dramatic purposes, but this
has been so skillfully done that the lib
erty is forgiven when the performance
Is viewed.
As Frederick the Great, Lewis Morrison
presented himself in a new role and won
the hearts of the audience and incident
ally a number of recalls. Howard Scott
and Wallace Shaw ably supported the
star, and as the Princess Amelia Miss
Gertrude Foster was very successful ana
gained much applause. There was a
crowded house, and judging from the
manner in which it was received, the Al
cazar should be filled throughout the
week.
Grand Opera-House.
Carroll Johnson loomed up as well In
white at the Grand Opera House last
night as he did in black at the Orpheum
two weeks ago. "The Gossoon" give*
him a fair opportunity of showing his
versatility, and his appearance in Irish
comedy was a base hit and a home run
for popularity. The play is well supplied
with dramatic situations, with two heavy
villains to the. fore. The Gossoon Is, of
course, the hero. His support Is excellent,
the ladies of the company being at their
best. Maud Edna Hall as Rose O'Connell,
the deceived but unspoiled Irish girl, was
interesting but brogueless. The rol% of
Annabel Gray by Lorena Atwood was
charmingly and naturally played, while
Julia Blanc made lots of fun as Pansy
Peters. Her smile is worth a week's sal
ary. Max yon Mitzel was a fair Bernard
O'Malley. Maurice Stewart's RhodyDugan
was a neat bit of comedy and shared the
applause with the Dandy Darragh of H.
Percy Meldon.
In the last act Mr. Johnson sang "My
Honolulu Lady" and "Take Your Presents
Back," and sang them ro well that He
was encored half a dozen times by the
delighted audience. The play will hola
the toards for the rest of the week.
At the Orpheum.
A splendid bill was presented at the Or
pheum last night to a crowded and appre
ciative house. Among the new features
the most sensational were the aerial acts
of the three Watson sisters, assisted by
the noted gymnast, Juan de Zamora.
Falke and Semon. musical artists and
comedians, made a most favorable im
pression, and Charles Wayne, the well
known eccentric comedian, at once estab
lished himself in the good graces of the
audience. Jones, Grant and Jones, the
colored comedians, and Anna Caldwell,
complete the list of the new attractions.
The Four Cohans have made themselves
prime favorites, and their new sketch,
"Running for Office," is exceedingly clev
er and amusing. Tim Murphy in his char
acter sketches, the two Judges in their
equillbristlc feats, and Carlin and Clarke,
the Germao comedians, were as entertaini
ng as ever.
Tivoil Opera-House.
There has been a revival of comic
opera nt the Tlvoll and a change of bill
is promised for every week. The man
agement has made a happy selection of
shapely and comely artists whose vocal
abilities are second to none. The old fa
vorite, "Boccaccio," "waa presented last
oveninjr and. "JM Mikadoi'i jr\]\_ follow.

Iflw Market, Jones and McAllister Sts., / â 
noxt week. Helen Merrill made a hit in
her rendition of "The Prayer," which she
had to repeat three times. I-ouise Royce,
as the poet and novelist, Boccaccio, re
ceived her share of the applause, and
John J. Raffael as the Prinze Pietro filled
his part well. The introduction of Tony
Ryan as the mad musician into the opera
is not in the best of taste, as his enter
taining specialties are foreign to every
thing presented. Of course, Edwin Ste
vens had a part, which he filled to the
satisfaction of all. Without apparent ef
fort Stevens had the entire audience
standing and singing "The Star-spangled
Banner" and actually shouting with pa
triotic enthusiasm in response to his hyp
notic Influences. Stevens enjoyed it and
so did the audience.
At the Chutes.
The usual large Monday evening audi
ence gave a hearty reception to the spe
cialties at the Chutes Free Theater last
evening. Tom Gleason and Lottie Holmes
made their first appearance on this coast
and their burlesque boxing act was very
unique. Almont and Dumont, musical ar
tists; Jacklin and Grodgens, descriptive
vocalists, and Marion and Lynton, a com
edy sketch team, duplicated their suc
cess of last week. Walter and Lola Leon
repeated their thrilling trapeze perform
ance and the new moving war pictures
were greeted with enthusiasm. Henri
Maurice Cannon, the big Swiss, is a great
favorite at the Haight-street grounds,
and his 'receptions every afternoon and
evening are well attended. Great prepa
rations are being made for the Fourth of
July celebration at the Chutes.
California Theater.
The California Theater will be reopened
Saturday evening with a great produc
tion of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." The cast
will include Rhys Thomas, L. R. Stock
well, Jeffreys D. Williams, Edith Hall,
Phosa McAllister, Jessie Shirley and
others equally strong. The sale of seats
will begin Thursday morning.
A Prisoner Dying.
United States Attorney General Griggs
transmitted to the United States Marshal
In this city yesterday an order to take
James F. Rodgers from the penitentiary
at San Quentin to the penitentiary at
