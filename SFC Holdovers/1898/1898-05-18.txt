HONGKONG, May 17.â The Hugh McCulloch, Admiral Dewey's
dispatch-boat, sailed to-day for Manila. Prior to her departure Consul
Wildman took on board General Aguinaldo, CoJonel del Pilar, Private
Secretary Leyla and fifteen other rebel leaders, forming the insurgent
Cabinet.
General Aguinaldo will land at Cavite, where 37,000 troops are
reported to await him to complete the annihilation of Spanish rule in
the Philippines. General Aguinaldo has promised to conduct his
campaign on humane lines and to give absolute allegiance to Admiral
Dewey and Generals Merritt and Williams. The latter, with Consul
W'ilJman, carried through the negotiations with the insurgent refugees
in Hongkong.
General Aguinaldo's past record points to his ability to control
the insurgents and prevent a massacre at Manila. The Americans
expect an engagement in a few days.

HAVANA, May 17.â A rr>an who cari)e here to-day by train)
from Cardenas says that while a srrjall boat froro an American
warship was attempting to pull up some torpedoes wh)ich) tbÂ«
Spaniards had placed at tY)e mouth) of the channel one of tf)e
torpedoes exploded. The boat was blown up by t\je explosion,

son. One of the grenades thrown by the Americans exploded
in trje streetand killed tf)e wife and youngest daughter of the

MOVEMENTS OF SHIPS
TO BE KEPT SECRET.
Cablef Lines Ordered to Transmit
None But Government
Messages.
WASHINGTON, May 17.â Brigadier-
General Greely, chief of the signal ser
vice and in charge of all strategic con
trol of telegraph "and cable lines, has
adopted energetic measures to prevent
the admiral of the Spanish squadron
now in Caribbean waters from keep
ing posted on the whereabouts and
movements of United States squadrons
and of our prospective naval and mili
tary operations. Last night he tele
graphed to the New York manager of
the Haytien Cable Company, forbidding
the sending or receipt of any mes-
I sages, except official messages to or
from the United States Government,
i disclosing the movements of our fleets
! and ships. The manager answered this
I morning that the inhibition would be
| strictly observed. If Admiral Samp
son is in Haytian waters, as conjee-
I tured, then this cable restriction makes
it Impossible for his movements to be
known except to the Government, or if
known it is impossible to send out the
information except through the Gov
ernment.
General Greely also telegraphed the
Anglo-American Cable Company this
morning recalling its attention to the
prohibition against any messages ini
mical to the interests of the Govern
ment and in particular forbidding the
receipt or sending of messages disclos
ing the movements of our ships or pros
pective military movements. This lat
ter step was taken in view of the no
tice to the Anglo-American Telegraph
Company that "pending further decis
ion by the chief signal officer we will
accept press messages without restric
tion."
General Greely's order appears to
cover the further decision referred to
in the company's notice. The orders
to these two companies were sent, as
the channels of communication under
their control seem to be, for the mo
ment, the ones through which the Span
ish admiral and the Spanish authorities
at Madrid and Havana are most likely
to secure information as to our naval
movements. "While it was not sus
pected that spies were sending direct
information, yet the transmission of
press dispatches on naval movements
was looked upon as likely to indicate to
the Spanish with sufficient certainty
the general whereabouts and purposes
of our fleets.
The precautions taken. It Is be
lieved, will restrict this character of
cable information to the Government
and fleet commanders, and the Span
ish authorities from now on will be
cut off from all knowledge of our naval
and military plans.
General Greely's telegraphic orders
supplement the written orders he had
previously given to all cable companies,
six in number, having lines from the
United States. The written orders have
been agreed to in writing by each of
the cable companies and now consti
tute an agreement with the Govern
ment.
REPORTED BATTLE
OFF CAIBARIEN
Several American Ships Said to Have
Been Attacked by Four Span
ish Gunboats.
NEW YORK, May 17.â A Ha
vana dispatch to a morning paper
says several American warships
arrived off Caibarien, 200 miles
east of Havana, to-day and were
attacked by four gunboats, but the
result is not known.
MANY OF THEM
ARE NOW AT
SAN JUAN
Preparations fire Made to
Crush Them by the
United States.
fldmiral Sampson's and Commodore
Schley's Combined Fleets to Be
Sent Against Them
To-Day.
NEW YORK, May 17. â The Washingron correspondent of the Herald sends the fol
lowing : Believing in the correctness of the report to the Herald and Call from Porto
Plata, announcing the arrival of the Spanish squadron at San Juan, Porto Rico, the Naval
War Board is taking measures to-night to hasten the formation of an armor-clad fleet.
This action is regarded as especially necessary in view of the information which
has reached the authorities here that the battle-ship Pelayo and the armored cruiser Carlos
V sailed from Cadiz, not for the Philippines, but for the West Indies, where they will re
enforce Cervera's command.
The effect of the junction of these forces will be to give Spain six armored men
ot-war in Western waters against six flying the American flag. Before the arrival of the
Pelayo and the Carlos V, however, the battleship Oregon will be at Key West and at
tached to Rear-Admiral Sampson's command, which will give the American navy a pre
ponderating force of one armor-clad.
While having an eye to the future it
is the immediate present that the Na
val War Board is thinking of. The
information cabled by Consul Smith
from Curacao announced that the
Spanish fleet had headed westward, but
subsequently turned and headed east
ward. San Juan is to the northeast
of Curacao, and naval experts say that
It was the natural thing for Admiral
Cervera to doâ to first steam to the
westward out of sight of land and then
to double on his track like a fox, so
as to deceive the enemy who might be
watching his movements.
The distance between Curacao and
San Juan is about 475 miles, and
steaming at the speed of eleven or
twelve knots it would have been an
easy matter for the* Spanish fleet to
have cove-red the distance within forty
hours. The enemy's men-of-war were
last seen off Curacao at 6 o'clock on
Sunday evening.
The armored cruisers Vlzcaya and
Infanta Marie Teresa which were in
the harbor had received dispatches
from Madrid from the Governor-Gen
eral of Porto Rico and Cuba, and no
doubt exists that these dispatches in
formed Admiral Cervera of the de
NEEDLESS ANXIETY
OVER THE HARVARD.
Naval Officers Laugh at the idea
That It Cannot Cope With
the Terror.
$IEW YORK, May 17.â There are as
surances that the War Board has
found a way to get the Harvard out
of St. Pierre harbor without risk of de
struction by the Spanish torpedo-boat
destroyer Terror. It involves the use of
the Tale and the Montgomery to watch
the port at the three-mUe limit, to wait
until the Harvard appears, and then
to be prepared, in case the Terror fol
lows, or any other Spanish torpedo
boat destroyers come along, to fall up
on them with their heavy and light
rapid-fire guns and destroy them.
On the other hand there are naval
officers who laugh at the fuss that
has ben made over the situation at St.
Pierre and declare that there is noth
ing to prevent the Harvard from leav
ing if she desires to do so, and noth
ing but the assumption that the tor
pedo boat destroyer is a formidable
vessel to lead to the opinion that it
could destroy the Harvard without
difficulty. When Captain Cotton has
completed the repairs said to be needed
by the Harvard, the nature of which
has not been communicated to the de
partment, he can leave, and it is be
parture of the American fleet from San
Juan, en route to Cuba, and of the dis
position of the American vessels along,
the North Atlantic Coast.
San Juan, therefore, was the natural
harbor for the Spanish men-of-war to
make, especially as the Porto Rican au
thorities, without doubt, have renewed
the fortifications of the harbor and
have replaced the guns knocked down
by the projectiles fired by the guns of
Rear Admiral Sampson's fleet in ad
dition.
The fact that the Madrid Govern
ment has seen fit to announce that
there are no men-of-war at San Juan
is considered in the nature f a con
firmation of the Herald's information
that the Spanish fleet has arrived at
that point.
It is believed the Spanish fleet will
make its headquarters at San Juan
during its future operations, or at least
until re-enforced by the Pelayo and Car
los V, which are now on their way from
Cadiz. These two vessels, it is ex
pected, will touch at the Canaries to
refill their coal bunkers. It is esti
mated that they should reach their des
tination within two weeks.
In the meantime the problem con
fronting the naval war board is how to
lieved that France will stick closely to
the custom under neutrality laws to
prevent the Terror from leaving until
twenty-four hours later.
WASHINGTON. May 17.â The tor
pedo-boat McKeon and the auxiliary

destroy the Spanish fleet before its re
enforcement arrives, while affording
protection to the cities along the coast
and maintaining an effective blockade
of the Cuban ports. In view of the
small number of effective vessels at
the disposal of the Government, the
task is most difficult, and the board
thoroughly appreciates this fact.
There will be a junction to-morrow of
the fleets under command of Rear Ad

so that by to-morrow night an effective
force, which will be commanded by the

CERVERA
EXPECTED
IN HAVANA
Beacon Light Kept Burn=
ing on Morro to Guide
His Fleet.
Blanco Tells His Soldiers That
Spain's Warships Soon Will
Enter the Harbor.
ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL,
DISPATCH-BOAT ALBERT F. DEW
EY, off Havana, via KEY WEST, Fla.,
May 17. â The Spanish fleet is expected
in Havana. For the last two nights
the Morro Castle light, which has not
been burning since the blockade com
menced, has blazed a red signal to
guide the Spanish warships Into the
harbor.
Some information regarding , the
movements of the fleet has reached
General Blanco. This information must
have come from Madrid, for news of
the sighting of the Cape Verde fleet off
the coast of Venezuela could scarcely
have penetrated rfavana by last Sun
day. Yet on that day General Blanco
caused it to be officially announced to
his soldiers and to the people of Ha
vana that a powerful fleet, with rein
forcements and supplies, had eluded
the American fleet and was approach
ing.
This news was brought by a Cuban
scout picked up in a row boat near Co
jimar, on Sunday night, who brought
out the Information to the blockading
squadron, under cover of darkness, and
then returned to land.
General Blanco evidently expects the
Spanish fleet to round the western end i
of the harbor and enter Havana in the
night, there to land supplies and troops
and prepare for a battle with the block
ading squadron.
Reports of the presence of the Span
ish fleet in these waters have greatly
strengthened the courage of Blanco's !
soldiers, whose spirits were beginning
to droop under the conviction that
Spain had abandoned them to their
fate. Increased activity and prepara
tions for desperate defense are notice
able along the coast.
Soldiers are now plentiful at all
points. They have learned the folly of
exposing themselves to the fire of gun- :
boats and generally keep concealed.
Nevertheless they spring from day to i

of Lilies and Apple
Blossoms.
A UNIQUE BRIDAL TOUR.

Home.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, May 17.â That a wed
ding can be talked about until it is
worn threadbare and the wealth of the
groom and beauty of the bride dis
cussed until they sound like ancient
history, and yet the ceremony be cele
brated In the most quiet manner possi
ble, was proved to-day when Miss
Katherine Duer, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. William A. Duer, became Mrs.
Clarence H. Mackay in her father's
house, surrounded only by her own and
her husband's family and relatives and
comparatively few intimate friends.
Yet there was every social reason
here for much fuss and feathers â as
much pomp and display, as many
flowers, as much music, as lg a
crowd, as at any of the historic wed
dings that have passed into social his
tory.
Elegance and simplicity marked the
floral decorations. The bridal party
stood in the drawing-room before a
grotto of lilies and apple blossoms.
The mantel was banked with a mass
of deep-colored bougainvillaea and the
woodwork of the room was entirely
covered by branches of apple blossoms,
tied with apple-gTeen ribbon. The
library was done entirely in pink and
white flowers arranged In vases, moss
roses, sweetpeas and swanso-nia pre
dominating. American Beauty roses
nicknamed the Bride, by the way â
formed a feature of the decoration for
the dining-room and halls. By Instruc
tions of the bride the flowers used In
decoration were sent to the Working
Girls' Club after the ceremony.
The front part of the drawing-room,
for perhaps one-third of the distance,
was ribboned off for the bridal party.
Punctually at 12 o'clock Archbishop
Corrlgan, attended by his secretary.
Father Connelly, and Rev. Thomas
Ducey, entered and took his position
behind a low prle dleu. He was closely
followed by the bridegroom and his best
man. Mr. Columbua C. Baldwin, and
day some carefully thought out plan
to wreak injury upon the blockading
vessels, particularly the small gun
boats that patrol the shore.
Their masked batteries having by
this time been uncovered, General
Blanco has supplied fleldpieces. These
guns are continually being sprung upon
the gunboats from new places. One or
two will be placed In position during
the night and carefully concealed. The
next day when a gunboat comes slip
ping along close to shore, watching for
an opportunity to throw shrapnel shell
into a group of soldiers, these guns will
be turned loose on it.
Several of the smaller gunboats have
had narrow escapes in the last two
days and as the field pieces are moved
every night inshore patrolling is at
tended by some danger. An accurately
aimed shell from these guns might
easily sink a small boat.
The Dewey yesterday and to-day pa
trolled the coast from Havana to Car
denas and back again, seeing Spanish
soldiers in a half-dozen places. At an
abandoned summer resort on Iscosos
Peninsula, now apparently occupied by
the Spanish as barracks, a group of
soldiers fired several shots at us. Al
though the range was not over 2000
yards, at which distance a Mauser rifle
will easily carry, we heard nothing of
the bullets. Three Spanish gunboats
are in Cardenas Bay, but they are
afraid to venture out in the harbor.
I have good reason to believe that
the village of Siguapa, situated near
Cardenas, was attacked and partially
burned by the insurgents last night.
From where the Dewey was lying, two
miles off the coast, I could distinctly
see the flames of the burning houses
and hear scattering shots.
I know that a considerable band of
insurgents came down to the coast
east of Matanzas last Friday for the
Gussie expedition, and they may have
been waiting In concealment since then
in expectation of the steamer's return.
They might easily have taken a village
by surprise and retired before the
Spanish could get reinforcements from
Cardenas.
then almost immediately Lander's or
chestra, stationed in the main foyer,
struck up the "Lohengrin" wedding
march, and the bridal party entered,
the ushers, Messrs. Frank Lyon Polk,
Philip M. Lydig, F. L. H. Betts, Wil
liams P. Burden and Walter S. Lyon
of San Francisco leading the way.
The bridesmaids, Miss Evayn Burden,
Miss Daisy Leiter, Miss Llla Sloane and
Miss Inez Telfener came next, wearing
exquisite gowns, made entirely of alter
nating sections of white mousseline de
soie and lace, draped over pale blue
satin, and coiffure aigrettes of blue to
match. Each carried a large bouquet
of pink rosrs.
The bride, leaning on the arm of her
father, entered last, and superbly beau
tiful she locked. Her gown, made by
Worth, and cut with an immensely long
train, was of silver brocaded satin,
draped at the bodice only with some
beautifully fine maline lace, and the
veil was of tulle, held well back on
coiffure with a few orange blossoms.
Her bouquet was of orchids, and the
only jewels she wore was an immense
pendant, consisting of an extremely
large and perfect-shaped pearl, in
a setting of diamonds, the gift of the
groom.
In the group nearest the bride during
the ceremony was Mrs. Duer, her
mother, who wore a costume of pale
blue satin trimmed with lace and silver
pailettes; Mrs. John Mackay, whose
gown was of pale gray satin and chif
fon and who wore no jewels; the Prin
cess Colonna, wearing a toilet of mauve
chiffon and satin and also without
Jewels, and Mrs. Richard Irvin, in a
handsome gown of white crepe.
The wedding breakfast, which fol
lowed, was served at small tables. At
the bride's table, which occupied the.
center of the dining-room and was dec
orated with gardenias, lilies of the val
ley and orange blossoms, were seated
the bridal party and the Princess Co
lonna, Mrs. Archibald Mackay, Mr.
Bertie Goelet and Mr. C. K. Duer.
The going away of the bride and
groom was somewhat different from the
ordinary. Just a few minutes past 3
o'clock the bride, attired now in a gown
of blue-colored chiffon and silk, and "a
black picture hat loaded with plumes,
ran lightly down the steps, followed by
her husband and the customary shower
of rice, and took her seat in a smart
Victoria which stood just in front of
the awning, but which the curious
crowd thronging the street had no idea
was intended for the newly married
pair.
Quickly Mr. Mackay jumped in beside
her and with cheers from the bystand
ers off they started at a rattling pace
for a three-hour drive to Westbury,
L. 1., and the spacious country house of
Mr. Perry Tiffany, which has been
leased by Mr. Mackay for a term of
years. It is there that Mr. and Mrs.
Mackay will spend the first week of
their honeymoon.
It is hinted that this rather uncon
ventional method of reaching their des
tination was chosen by Mr. and Mrs.
Mackay in order to give the slip to an
enthusiastic crowd of friends who were
contemplating giving them a lively
send-off when they boarded the train
at Long Island City.
The presents were not shown, but
they were numerous and superb. Be
sides many other beautiful jewels Mr.
Mackay gave his bride a magnificent
necklace of emeralds and diamonds and
a toilet set of solid repousse, set with
turquoise, with every conceivable ar
ticle for the toilet table, glove box.
handkerchief box, etc., all of the same
beautiful materials. Mrs. Mackay gave
her daughter-in-law a collar of dia
monds and Mr. Mackay presented a
substantial check.

of shadows. The family are all sit
ting around him, or moving noiselessly
in and out. It is a pathetic scene that
is being enacted this gloomy night.
"Late last evening all the servants
of the household were admitted to the
sick room for a final farewell. They
found Mr. Gladstone lying on his right
side in a deep sleep, as if dead. Each
in turn touched his hand and left the
room tearfully.
"Mr. Dobie doubts that his patient
was conscious at any time on Tues
day, though he said 'yes' and 'no,' nor
does the physician believe that Mr.
Gladstone recognized any one. Never
theless, he suffered no pain whatever,
but Just lay with his heas facing the
light, his eyes closed, his hands some
times outside the counterpane and
sometimes hidden beneath.
"His grand face bears a most peace
ful and beautiful look. A few days
ago the deeply bitten wrinkles that so
long marked it were gone, but now,
strangely enough, they seem strong and
deep as ever. He looks, too, in won
derfully good color.
"A bulletin at 9 o'clock Tuesday
morning afforded the first intimation
of the serious condition of the patient.
For some hours no additional informa
tion became public; but there were in
dications that a crisis had been
reached. The little village post office,
from which the telegraph wires run,
was suddenly manned by a staff to
work the special instruments which had
been silenced since they were fitted up
last Saturday in readiness for the emer
gency. During the day wherever one
went one would hear the general ex
pressions of deep regret among the
working people, at Hawarden, Sandy
croft, another village situated at the
foot of the gentle slope, and at Ches-
ter."
3 a, m. â Dr. Herbert Habershon ar
rived at 2 o'clock this morning. The
rain has continued to fall at intervals
throughout the night. Villagers have
been coming singly and in groups of
two or three, entering the castle gates
to glance silently at the rain-beaten
scrap of paper which is the latest bul
letin and then as silently returning to
the gate, not a hundred yards away,
and disappearing into the darkness
only to return later. At this hour many
are collected to gaze in unbroken
silence at the castle lights.
Dr. Habershon has Just retired, from
which it is inferred that nothing in the
nature of an immediate collapse is ex
pected. His physicians think Mr. Glad
stone will never speak again. At this
hour he is in deep sleep, while the
members of the family are keeping up
the final vigil beside the dying states
man. _^_____^____

MADRID, May 17.â At the moment
of his departure from the Cape Verde
Islands Admiral Cervera, in command
of the Spanish squadron of the West
Indian waters, made the following ad
dress to the crews of his ships:
"After three years of struggle in
Cuba we were nearing the end of trou

VANCOUVER, B. C, May 17.â The
Australian steamship Paroo, which ar
rived here to-day with sixty pas
sengers for the Klondike, brings news
from Honolulu that grave fears are en
tertained, owing to the war, for a
sugar fleet which left there three weeks
ago. The Paroo left the islands on May
7, and big ship-owners and under
writers were then anxiously awaiting
news of the fleet. The thirteen vessels
composing it are dandy American
clipper ships, and they have an
aggregate cargo of nearly 50,000 tons.
The vessels cost on an average $100,000
each, and should Spain capture them,
as is feared, the loss would be in the
neighborhood of $5,000,000. The Ha
waiian firms would not be great suf
ferers from the capture of the sugar
cargoes, as they are insured for their

NOW IN SORRY PLIGHT
SPANISH FLEET
CUT OFF FROM
CUBfIN PORTS
American Styps Control the Avenues
by Wtych the Enemy Could
React} the Island.
Blanco's forces at Havana face Famine and Ad
roiral Cervera Must Fight if He Attempts
to Relieve Them.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, May 17.
It Is believed that the American squadrons are under orders to prevent Admiral Cervera
from gaining an entrance to any Cuban harbor with ammunition and supplies for Blanco. The
Secretary of the Navy has not the slightest doubt that this is the mission of Cervera, for his fleet
was started across the Atlantic soon after Blanco issued his urgent appeal for relief from a threat
ened famine.
That a famine will soon exist in Cuba is indicated by to-day's news via Jamaica stating that
exorbitant prices are charged for staple food products, eggs selling for 10 cents each, meat at 50
cents a pound and flour 30 cents.
The draft made on poverty-stricken Spain to feed her Cuban army may well be imagined.
This convinced the naval sharps that Admiral Cervera's fleet will make a desperate attempt to reach
a Cuban port and land supplies and ammunition. Havana harbor would natually be the destina
tion of the Spanish fleet but for the fact that it would add to its steaming distance, and at the same
time be more difficult to enter owing to the blockade maintained by our squadron of warships.
In view of this situation, it is believed that either of the two principal ports on the south coast of
Cubaâ Santiago or Cienfuegosâ will be the fleet's destination. The Navy Department realizing this fact,
Sampson's fleet and the flying squadron will be posted between the enemy and these ports. This is all that
is definitely known of our naval plans. While it is not believed there will be a juncture of our two fleets, it
is considered altogetner probable they will be so situated, relatively, that either could quickly steam to the
assistance of the other.
The distance between Cienfuegos and Santiago is comparatively short. With our four swift scouting
cruisers the Minneapolis. St. Louis, Yale and Harvard â variously disposed so as to patrol Virgin, Mono
and Windward passages and Cape San Antonio (the western extremity of Cuba) the early approach of the
enemy could be heralded. Sampson and Schiey could effect a juncture and by combined effort easily dispose
of the hostile fleets.
On the other hand, even though a juncture between our two squadrons seemed inexpedient, the ports
of Santiago and Cienfuegos would still be blockaded. With Sampson at Santiago and Schiey at Cienfuegos,
the enemy could at the same time be intercepted â to Havana through the Windward passage by Sampson
and around Cape San Antonio by the flying squadron. It is the universal impression in Washington that
some such plan has been adopted.
With Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago shut against it, the Spanish fleet would naturally seek coal
and provisions at the harbor of San Juan, and it is said that the American naval commanders would desire
nothing better than to have it follow that course. If the Spanish admiral could be enticed into the har
bor of San Juan it would be possible for the two flying divisions of the American navy to combine in a
blockade of that harbor and either starve the Spanish forces into subjection or to enter the harbor itself and
destroy the Spanish warships by the use of tactics similar to those adopted by Admiral Dewey in the har
bor of Manila.
The execution of such a plan has been rendered practicable by the recent destruction by Admiral Samp
son's fleet of the principal batteries guarding the entrance of the harbor of San Juan, so that in the event
of a battle in that harbor the United States navy would have only the Spanish ships to cope with. In
the opinion of naval strategists, the absence of land batteries would insure an American victory after a
short fight.
The Cuban invasion was discussed at the Cabinet meeting to-day, and, while it was agreed to rapidly
mobilize the volunteers at Gulf ports and have them equipped and ready for a possible hurried change in the
military programme, it was generally understood all around the President's table, that no movement should
be made to embark any considerable number of troops for Cuba until after the two fleets had reached their
respective destinations, or until it was ascertained that the troops could be landed without interference from
the Spanish squadron. In brief, the Cuban invasion is held up for the present and the delay is for an in
definite period.
The first military expedition to sail will be that from San Francisco for the Philippines, and within
two weeks, it is believed, the second expedition, convoyed by the Philadelphia, will embark. By July Ist
16,000 troops, regulars and volunters, will have landed at Manila.
General Merritt's telegram to the President to-day denying that he had submitted to the purported in
terview published this morning satisfied the President that General Merritt had been misquoted. Merritt
was represented as criticizing the administration for proposing to send only 1000 regulars to the Philip
pines instead of 5000. But despite the general's denial, there is good reason to believe that he made some
such statement, for it was partially confirmed by the arrival here from New York of a member of his staff,
Colonel Hughes, inspector general of the Department of the East, who stated that it was General Merritt's
desire that about 5000 well seasoned regulars should accompany the expeditions to the islands.
Secretary Alger and General Miles are considering the feasibility of sending immediate^ to San Fran
cisco three regiments of regulars now at Tampa.
General Greely, chief of the signal service, will dispatch a corps of electrical experts and cable and
telegraph operators to accompany the next troop ship that leaves for Manila. These are expected to splice
the Hongkong cable, establish a new terminal station and operate both the cable and land lines.
The rules adopted by the Navy Department and applied to-day, restricting officials and employes from
conversing freely with press representatives or others about the conduct of the war, amount to a rigid cen
sorship. General Greely, chief signal officer of the War Department, has closed another news avenue. The
Haytien and Anglo-American Cable Companies, operating in Cuban, Jamaican and Porto Rican waters, have
been warned not to accept any press or private cables giving information of the movements of war vessels.
By this strict censorship the naval war board hopes to hoodwink the enemy as successfully as the Spaniards
have deceived us.

HEAVY FIRING
OFF TORTUGA
PORT AU PRINCE, May 17. â A gTeat sensation was caused here by
the arrival to-day of the military commandant of the Isle of Tortuga,
off the northwest coast of Hayti, and due north of Port de Paix, near
the entrance to the Windward Passage, who brought word to the
Haytien War Department of what Is believed to have been a naval en
gagement on Sunday.
The commandant reached Port de Paix from the Isleof Tortuga in a
canoe. He reported to the War Office that throughout the whole of
Sunday a very persistent cannonading had been heard east of the
island, and that from its duration and intensity there was a strong pre
sumption that a very serious action had taken place.
A thick fog at the time made it impossible to distinguish any ves
bpl that might be engaged.

ceived the following telegram from
General Merritt:
GOVERNORS ISLAND, N. T.
Hon. R. A. Alger, Secretary of War,
Washington: 1 desire you to know that
the interviews published in the New York
papers this morning are in every way in
correct and unauthorized. I had intended
to take no notice of them, but I under
stand the articles are taken seriously in
Washington. WESLEY MKRRITT.
Colonel R. P. Hughes, inspector-gen
eral, with headquarters at New York
City, was at the War Department to
day on a mission from General Mer
ritt in connection with the assignment
of regular troops to accompany the
Philippine expedition soon to start
from San Francisco. General Merritt's
preference for a larger number of reg
ulars than it was proposed by the de
partment to give him has been known
for some time, and his views on t^at
subject are shared by many of the
army officials. They realize that Gen
eral Merritt will have a delicate and
important duty to perform as Military
Governor of the Philippines, and they
agree in expressing the opinion that
the general should have an adequate
and well-disciplined force at his com
mand to maintain order in a city that
will be filled with discordant elements.
There are not enough regulars in the
West to furnish the number that Gen
eral Merritt thinks should be sent on
the expedition, and consequently Sec
retary Alger and the department of
ficials have been considering the advis
ability of withdrawing about three of
the infantry regiments from Tampa,
where a large number are rendezvous
ed and disDatching them post haste to
the Pacific Coast.
These men are well seasoned and
thoroughly disciplined, and are just the
kind General Merritt believes should
be sent on the trans-Pacific trip.
Capta-in Jesse M. Lee, United States
Infantry, who has been stationed at
Tampa recently, reported at army
headquarters to-day in response to tele
graphic instructions, and it may be he
is here with reference to the sending
of some troops now there to the Philip
pines. General Greely, chief signal
officer, is making arrangements to send
a detachment of six officers and fifty
five men, made up largely of telegraph
operators and electricians to accom
pany the Philippine expedition.

HAVANA ACCOUNT
OF TWO VICTORIES
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, May 17. â The French .man-of-war Dubourdieu sailed
from this port to-day, but I was unable to ascertain her destination.
She carried four passengers, who fled from the island. As the ship left
port a mob hissed the fugitives.
Pome American ships at 8 o'clock in the morning of last Friday at
tempted to land troops on Tablas Acuas Beach, Plnar del Rio. Firing
â¢was kept up for two hours, the Spanish preventing a landing. Later
they attempted to make a landing at Salado Jarro Beach. An Ameri
can gunboat fired forty-nine shots, but Spanish troops prevented a
landing. It is asserted that the Spanish artillery fired two well-aimed
shots, the missiles falling on the deck of the American gunboat.
Colonel Rodriguez has routed in Carmen Hills, near Guines, the
combined forces of rebels, aggregating 400 men. They were dispersed,
leaving many killed and wounded. About 200 bodies were picked up.
It is asserted that among the dead the body of Emile Collazo was iden
tified. Many horses, weapons and supplies were captured at Guines,
and many good soldiers among the insurgents have since sworn alle
giance to the Government.

SANTA ROSA, May 17.â When Grand
Chancellor W. EL Grant of Woodland
called the session of the Grand Lodge,
Knights of Pythias, to order this
morning in Odd Fellows' Hall, he was
greeted by an enthusiastic delegation
consisting of < ver 300 of the representa
tive citizens of the State. The usual
formalities being over, the report of H.
Schaffner, grand keeper of records and
seals, was presented to the lodge. The
report showed the order to bs in a
flourishing condition.
Shortly before the adjournment at
noon, the following telegram was sent
by the Grand Lodge to the President of
the United States, tendering the serv
ices of a regiment of Pythians to the
Government in case they should be
needed. The telegram was as follows:
SANTA ROSA. May IT.
To the President of the United States,
"Washington: The Grand Lodge of Cali
fornia, Knights of Pythias, now in session
assembled at Santa Rosa, Cal., and repre
senting over 11,000 loyal American citizens,
hereby tenders the services of a full regi
ment, composed of and officered by mem
bers of this order, subject to your call at
any time. We will have ready for you a
second and third regiment whenever the
Government needs tnem. The men, ofil
cered, after two weeks' drilling in camp,
will be ready for any duty assigned them.
We await your order.
The report was adopted amid the
greatest enthusiasm, members cheering
the reading of the message repeatedly.
The action of the Grand Lodge shows
conclusively that the Knights of
Pythias is a thoroughly patriotic
organization.
Following close upon the heels of this
resolution was another, somewhat of
the fame general tenor, providing that
in case any member of a subordinate
lodge should go er be called to the
front in defense of his country in the
present crisis, his per capita tax to the
Grand Lodge should be remitted during
the period covered by his absence. This
was introduced by Colonel H. R. Arndt
of San Diego, and its passage was the
signal for renewed enthusiasm.
A committee of five was appointed to
attend to the matter of redistricting
the State, and the matter had hardly
been settled before H. L. Clark of Lodi
was on his feet with a resolution of
approval of the action of the President
and Congress in undertaking to assist
the liberty-loving residents of Cuba in
their struggle for independence. The
resolution also provided that subordi
nate lodges throughout the State do
all in their power to assist in this noble
cause, and the matter went through
with a rush.
Lieutenant-Governor Jeter of Santa
Cruz was then appointed a committee
of one to interview Governor James H.
Budd, and if possible get him to grant
a license to the different companies of
the Uniform Rank in the State, per
mitting them to drill, organize and
parade with guns and the other occou
terments of war.
The Introduction of a resolution in
dorsing Judge Stanton L. Carter of
Fresno for the office of supreme vice
chancellor of the Grand Lodge of the
United States met with the hearty ap
proval of the delegates, and the reso
lution was passed unanimously.
The action of Grand Chancellor Grant
in the matter of allowing certain ex
penses incurred during the resuscita
tion of Vita Nuova Lodge was In
dorsed by the Grand Lodge, shortly
after which the session adjourned to
to-morrow morning.
Already the matter of a place for
holding the next session of the Grand
I,odge in being agitated. Pasadena.
Par.ta Cruz, Rod Bluff and Oakland are
in the race, and the chances are said to
be somewhat in favor of Santa Cruz.
This evening a reception to the dele
gates was tendered at the Athenaeum
by the members of Santa Rosa Lodge
and citizens.
The delegates and visitors will spend
to-morrow In the redwoods of the beau
tiful Guerneville country, and a grand
ball will be given In their honor at the
Athenaeum !n the evening.
Grand Chief Mrs. Lydia Monroe of
Riverside called the eighth annual

the affairs of the order are in a highly
satisfactory condition.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 17.
Considerable progress was made by j
the Senate to-day in considering the j
war revenue measure. Mr. Jones of
Arkansas presented in a general state
ment the views of the Democratic mem
bers of the Finance Committee. He
maintained that the taxes imposed by j
the pending bill ought to be levied on j
property and not upon consumption;
that the policy of the Republican party
had always been to impose taxes upon j
consumption, while that of the Demo- j
cratic party was to impose it upon i
property. He believed that taxation !
that would raise $150,000,000 would be j
amply sufficient to be carried by this
bill, and that if the exigencies of the
war should demonstrate that more '.
money was needed, Congress could
provide it later. He opposed the prop- !
osition to issue bonds and certificates ;
of indebtedness far in excess of the
requirements of the war and held that
the expenses should be paid by the i
Government as the war progresses.
The Senate chaplain' in his invoca- j
tlon at the opening of the session to- j
day paid a tribute to those who suffei- j
at home through the horrors of war. j
Mr. Hale, qfralrman of the Committee
on Naval Affairs, offered the follow
ing resolution, which was agreed to:
That the treasury appointments made
by the President on and after April 21,
IS9S, and up to the date of the passage
of this joint resolution, of officers of the
line and staff of the navy are hereby
ratified and confirmed, to continue in force
during the exigency under which their
services are required in the existing war.
Officials so appointed shall be assigned
to duty with rank and pay of the gradeÃ
established by existing law, and shall be
paid from the appropriation for "pay of
the navy."
A bill was reported by the Military
Affairs Committee by Carter of Mon
tana, and passed, providing that pay
and allowance of the volunteers en
listed in the United States army shall
begin on the day of their enrollment at
the State camps, with a provision that
volunteer troops sent to the Philippine
Islands may draw one month's pay in
advance. It was explained that the bill
applied only to those who as volunteers
had enlisted in the United States army.
On motion of Allison, consideration
of the war revenue measure was re
sumed, Jones of Arkansas taking the
floor. Jones said he doubted whether
there was a man In the Senate who
was not ready to vote all the money
and taxes necessary to carry on the
present war. He would not perform
his duty, he thought, If he should vote
for too much money. The problem
presented was how much money was
needed.
Jones called attention to the state
ment of the Secretary of the Treasury
Gage that the additional expenses of
the war, over and above the current
expenses of the Government, would be
about $25,000,000 a month, a total of
perhaps $300,000,000 a year. Secretary
Alger had informed the Finance Com
mittee that the extraordinary war ex
penses of his department would be
about $150,000,000. He thought this
amount sufficiently liberal.
Mr. Jones declared that every feature
of the bill was a tax on consumption.
The stamp tax was one of the most
onerous and vexatious forms of taxation
ever devised. The tax upon tobacco
and upon beer was a tax on consump
tion.
Without reaching any agreement as
to what portion of the bill should be
considered first the Senate proceeded
with the reading of the bill. Mr. Alli
son presented tables showing the
amounts of the ordinary appropriations
for the next fiscal year. They aggre
gate (less $51,000,000 for the sinking
fund) $480,849,852. The total estimated
revenues (including postal revenues)
Mr. Allison's tables showed were $482,
874,647, an excess of $2,024,795 over the
estimated ordinary appropriations. The
appropriation for the war Mr. Allison
gave as follows: National defense (act
of March 9. 1898), $50,000,000; army, fort
ifications and navy (act of May 4), $35,
700,000; fortifications, $4,000,000; naval
act (increase over 1898 for war pur
poses), $23,100,000; naval deficiencies,
1898, $22,275,000; naval establishment for
1898, additional $75,000,000; naval auxil
iary bill, $4,000,000; immune bill and en
gineer bill, $15,000,000; army for 1899,
additional $150,000,000. Total appropria
tions on account of war, $379,192,000.

V
Island-- Government Willing to Aid
This Country Under Present Con
. ;V ditions During the War.
Special Correspondence ot ThÂ« Call.
HONOLULU, May 9.â President Dole
accorded The Call correspondent a very
lengthy interview this forenoon, dur
ing which the annexation and neutral
ity questions were thoroughly discussed
in almost all their phases. The views
of the President are those of a man
sincerely anxious that his Government
shall keep the truest and purest faith
with the Government of the United
States. â : V' \ â¢
While,, until the arrival of the last
steamer, he has not felt inclined to re
fer to the annexation bill sent some few
weeks ago from Washington, except in
the most secret councils of the Cabinet,
he has within the last few days taken
into his confidence legislators and other
prominent citizens. He does not feel
justified in permitting the text of the
bill to be made public until the Cabinet
has arrived at a decision ; upon it, for
there is one important provision in.it
(to which he will not specifically refer)
which does not meet with the present
approval of the Government.
Furthermore, while he does not say so
in plain words, he feels very doutf ul
whether if the bill were placed before
the Legislature with the* unanimous in
dorsement of the Cabinet (not yet ob
tained) it would stand any chance of
passing.
The President feels, to a very force- J
ful degree, that Hawaii has done all in
her power to foster the cause of an
nexation, and that if Hawaii is needed
by the United States," or is deemed an
acceptable gift by her, Congress should
consummate the bargain at once and I
not throw the onus of what may per- j
chance some day be regarded by others
as an irregular proceeding â , upon Ha- I
waii. Irregularities are often con
doned in time of war, and may be re
garded as one of those instances in
which the change of conscience on the
part of a few Senatorial votes in favor
of annexation, on the grounds of pa
* annexation, on the grounds of pa
tic requirements, might be forgiven
even by their political opponents,
The President has also practically de- i
cided that, if we are not annexed, he
will not issue a proclamation of neu
trality. He deems it absolutely un
necessary for us, and, furthermore, he i
is reading up the precedents, showing
that in certain circumstances, analo
gous to the relations existing between j
Hawaii and the United States, one
belligerent may be more favored by a j
neutral than another. He is determ
ined to assist the United States as far
as he possibly can without transgress
ing his constitutional limits. It , is.
principally because he ' believes the
Washington bill to be ultra vires of our
constitution that he almost anticipates
defeat for it when presented, probably
on the 12th inst. The United States
having a lease-cession of Pearl Har
bor might, : the bar had been re-,

States steamship Bennington is held
ready to slip her cables at a moment's
noticeâ and with the inglorious uncer
tainties of war staring him in the face
and with strong â¢ conflicting personal
and political influences confronting
him, President Dole is compelled against
his wishes to drift with "untried cir
cumstance" : and opportunism. . ;> â ;Â£/
The steamship Doric arrived ;â  last
evening, but she learned news from us
instead of bringing any. She did not
forget, however, to bring us another
horde of Asiatics.
Yesterday afternoon the Cabinet re
ceived a number of the representatives
of the planters in reference to a prop
osition to grant them further time in
which to import their 10 per cent of
American or European in proportion to
Asiatic labor. This they are com
pelled to do under a bond. The matter
was taken under consideration, which
practically means that the Government
will consent to their wishes on the
grounds that, first, such a class of la
bor cannot profitably be obtained; and
second, In view of the possibility of an
nexation the matter should be left in
abeyance until our fate is definitely
known. - '
The Government ; has introduced an

tention is to withdraw the tabu against

GARDEN CITY

No Funds for Payment
of the Electric Light
Company.
An Embarrassment Caused by
the Operation of the New
Charter.
Provision tor Lighting San Jose's
Streets Cannot Be Made Before
July.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 17.â The city was In
total darkness last night, and in all
probability the streets will remain un
lighted until after July 1. This is
due to the refusal of the Electric Im
provement Company to furnish light
for street purposes any longer until
some arrangement is made for paying
the bill. The contract under which the
city is illuminated amounts to $1510 per
month, and a few days ago this fund
became exhaiifited.
Under the new charter the Council is
not allowed to contract bills for work
or supplies for which there is not
money on hand to pay for the same,
and consequently there was no way in
which the street lighting could be paid
for from city funds.
Yesterday the Electric Light Improve
ment Company notified the Council that
they would light the streets no longer
under existing circumstances.
Last night was the first time In many
years the city streets were not lighted.
People who were out late experienced
considerable difficulty in getting home
in the dark, but they will have to be
come used to it. The city was plunged
into this condition of affairs by the ex
travagance of the last City Council.

MANILA, May 13, via Hongkong,
May 17.â The captain-general and
Archbishop of Manila are making
strenuous efforts to induce the natives
to remain loyal. They have formed a
council of twenty-four Filipinos for
mer separatists, as advisers to the
Government.
The country is quiet around Manila
and other provinces are reported quiet,
except Pangasan and Zambales, where,
it is rumored, there have been risings.
Business has been partially resumed in
Manila. Shops and offices are open.
It is reported that Americans have
captured the gunboat Ceyte off Bul
cacau. She was hiding off the coast.
Granted American Registry.
WASHINGTON, May 17.â The House
to-day passed bills to grant American
registry to the Centennial, now at Se

York, both proposed Government
transport ships.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A
man with his chin bowed on
his chest, with a woebegone
look in his eyes? He seems
to think that all the good things
of this world are lost eternally
for him, and possibly he is not
far short of the mark. In fact, he is alto-
gether right unless he wakes up from
sleep.
UNLESS HE ROUSES himself
and tries to get some help that
man is going to continue to
fade away as he is doing now!
If you will watch him you will
find that he is afraid of his
own shadow almost, and he
has a pair of knees that tremble like
twigs of a tree on a stormy day.
DO YOU KNOW what he needs
in order to make a strong man
out of him? He needs some-
thing that makes manliness-
some creative substance. And
"Hudyan" Is the only thing
yet discovered which does this.
It picks up eld men and makes them
young again, and it does it every time.
YOU NEED HAVE no doubt If
you are a poor, erring mortal.
Others have been as bad and
as foolish as you. Others have
abused opportunities and fooled
with health. And some ten
thousand of them in this coun-
try alone have been most completely |
cured by "Hudyan." Why not be a man?
ARE YOU GOINO to confess |
that you have no desire to be
respected by your fellow men
and by those of the opposite
sex, too? Why will you die a j
living death when you can live?
Ju?t ask for free circulars and
testimonials showing the wonders "Hud- j
yan" has performed; see for yourself.
NOT A CENT do they cost you,
and what is quite as good hear-
ing, you can have free medical

cure for every form of Indigestion.
They are In Tablet form which re-
tains their good qualities Indefinitely,

and useless with age.
They are convenient, can be carried
in the pocket and taken when needed.
They are pleasant to the taste.
After each meal dissolve one or two
of them in the mouth and .â mingling,
with the food, they . constitute a per-
fect digestive, absolutely safe for the
most sensitive stomach. . _
They digest the food before it has
time to ferment, thus preventing the
formation of gas, and keeping the
blood pure and free from the poisonous
products of fermented, half-digested
food. , ...

Cars of the Geary and McAllister street
lines make the camp accessible. The
Government is permitted to use the
track without charge, the only stipu
lation being that the army authorities
shall leave the premises in as good con
dition as they find them. It is pre
sumed that the incoming regiments
have tentage.
Lieutenant Neall will place straw and
wood on the ground at First avenue
before the regiments arrive. Mr. Rich
ardson, master of transportation of the
Southern Pacific system, has kindly
promised to keep Lieutenant Neall ad
vised as to the movements of trains

will be received and directed to their

Yesterday General Merriam issued an
order relating to the performance of
camp duties. Paragraphs of this or
der read:
"To facilitate prompt supply of the
troops in the camp established at the
Presidio of San Francisco and to pro.
vide for the proper policing of that
camp the following assignments arÂ«
made:
"Captain Charles B. Thompson, as
sistant quartermaster, will supervise all
requisitions and issues of quartermas
ter stores. Regimental and battalion
quartermasters of volunteer troops will
report to him for instruction in their
duties.
"First Lieutenant James E. Nolan,
Fourth United States Cavalry, will su- i
pervise all requisitions and issues of
subsistence stores. Regimental and
battalion commissaries of volunteer j
troops will report to him for instruc- j
tion in their duties.
"First Lieutenant John M. Neall,
Fourth United States Cavalry, will
have charge of location, arrangement
and policing of camps and the preser
vatlon of order therein.
"The commanding officer of the Pre- '.
sidio of San Francisco will give such
Instructions to the officers named as
will insure the subordination of their
post duties to those herein enjoined."
According to telegraphic advices re
ceived at department headquarters in
coming regiments will arrive as fol
Â°The Thirteenth Minnesota Volunteer |
Infantry, which left St. Paul at 9:30
o'clock on Monday evening last, is due
to arrive in San Francisco Friday ,
evening. May 20.
The First Nebraska Regiment of
Volunteers, that left Lincoln at 4 p. m.
last Monday, is due to reach this city
Thursday. May 19. The schedule
originally placed this regiment to ar
rive next Friday, but a telegram was
received at headquarters yesterday
saying that the command would get
here Thursday.
The Twentieth Regiment of Kansas
Volunteers left Topeka at 2 p. m. last
Monday, via the Union and Central
Pacific railways. The schedule at
headquarters provides that the regi
ment shall arrive in San Francisco |
next Thursday night or Friday morn- j
ing.
The Regiment of Colorado Volun
teers is slated to arrive next Friday.
The duty of receiving the volunteers
and directing them to their quarters
devolves upon Lieutenant Thomas G.
Carson, Fourth United States Cavalry,
post adjutant, Presidio. He received
the Washington Volunteers yesterday
and directed them to their quarters in
the Fontana Barracks. The troops
from points east of the Rocky Moun
tains assigned to quarters at the Bay
District will probably march along
Market street and Golden Gate avenue
to the camp ground on First avenue.
Information is wanted that will lead
to the finding of George Brown of
Texas, a recruit of the Third United
States Artillery, enlisted May 11, 1898.
He left for the Presidio the same day
under a misapprehension and in good
faith, and through no fault of his own.
Unless he-is found, however, a charge
of desertion against him will probably
have to be registered. As the matter
now stands, he is absent without leave.
He may either return to the recruiting
office, Phelan building, or to the head
quarters ; of his regiment at the
Presidio, and he need not, of
course, fear punishment. He is 5
feet 8 inches high, dark brown hair,
ruddy : complexion, light blue eyes,
slender but strong physique and
smooth shaven. It is feared that â  the
young recruit on his way to the Presi
dio, after having been accepted by the

fallen In with some of : the recently,
hatched volunteer surgeons and been
rejected. /â  . .

AT FONTANA BARRACKS.
Arrival of the Second Battalion
of Washington Vol
unteers.
Tha early days of '61 are recalled by
the scenes enacted in and about Fontana
barracks, near Fort Mason. Everything
is being done by the officers of the vari
ous commands stationed there to oring
the men tft perfection in drilling, and the
discipline shown by the troops speaks
well for the officers under whom they are
serving. This is particularly true oi â¢ ; -
tain Geary of Battery A of the H<uvy
Artillery, whose lung service in the
regular army and National Guard has
perfected him in the art of intelligently
handling troops. Captains Steere, Hay
and Cooke also deserve great credit for
the advancement made in bringing their
men to so complete an understanding of
their duties.
Major Rice, the commanding officer of the
heavy artillery, says that he is proud of
his command, and when the uniforms
which arrived yesterday are distributed
he will have as tine a body of troops as
any one would care to see. i
Everything In and about the barracks is
kept in perfect order, and cleanliness pre
vails in all of the departments. The men
are well satisfied with the food served
and with the way they are being treated.
They are, however, anxious to be fully |
equipped at the earliest moment possible |
so that they may be ready to take the
lield when the summons for active duty
comes.
The second battalion of Washington
troops arrived on the Umatilla yesterday
morning, and at once proceeded to Fon
tana barracks, where they are quartered |
along with the first battalion from the
bum State. The third battalion will ar- j
rive here from Tacoma on Thursday, and j
will be quartered at the same place. j
They will be under command of Lieuten
ant-Colonel W. J. Fife, and will be ac- '
companied by Colonel John H. Wholley,
the commanding officer of the regiment, j
which is designated as the First IV-gl- i
ment of Washington Volunteers. The :
following are the officers of the two bat
talions now quartered at Fontana bar

dier. He is a graduate of West Point, i
and for a long time was on detached ;
service as instructor at the University of
Washington, his rank being first lieu
tenant in the Twenty-fourth Infantry,
United States army.
PRESIDIO CAMP ROUTINE.
Seventh California Inspected.
More Oregonians Will
Arrive To- Day.
If "marching up a hill and marching
down again" is all that Is necessary. to ;
constitute a soldier, then most of , the I
volunteer troops at the Presidio . have j
nothing- more â¢to learn. By. the same
token, if ! giving the orders that dispatch
the soldiers aimlessly up and down the
aforesaid elevation, and when that is done j
with, mounting a pedestal for the adora- i
tlon of the throngs of mothers, sisters, j
wives and sweethearts who f daily and
hourly swarm through the camp, is essen
tial to wearing shoulder-straps . success
fully, the* officers can throw away- their
"blue books," secure in the knowledge
that they are letter perfect in the art of
war.
Battalion drill, extended order, and
army formation are the proper, thing out
on the , reservation nowadays; ', but : If one
were to pick an enlisted : man â  haphazard,
non-commissioned or private, and ask
him , to execute the first ; "setting up" ex
ercise the < chances ; are two to one that
he would look â : upon , you in \ amazement
and without the faintest idea of what you
meant. r It Is 'â¢â  quite j probable â -, that many I
of i the staff, vif s not the > lme officers ;. too, i
would have â  to ; confess their entire â  ignor- :
ance- of this first lesson in a soldier's :
career. .-;â : v.' â *â '"'" : ' -"'â¢â  'â '''â  '.. â  - 'â â ',
-,: The truth Is. the officers are putting the j
men through a lot of , hard and, r at. pres
ent, ; unnecegary. work . ju; fird,er that the],
field and line commanders may perfect
themselves in movements they should
have been entirely familiar with before
they were commissioned. As a result,
one may see a battalion â or even a regi
ment â drawn up in line with half the men
standing in anything but a soldierly atti
tude. Toes close together, shoulders
pitched forward or one dropped below the
other, and similar defects are all too
common. The cause is easy to dis
cern. Fully 50 per cent of the volun
teers never had any military training
previous to going into camp, and their
superiors, in.stead of beginning at the
foundation to make soldiers of them, put
muskets in their hands me first thing,
and after giving them an inkling of the
manual of arms and breaking into col
umns of fours and twos, the first day or
two, sent thorn out with their companions
fall-fledged soldiers.
it would be well for the volunteer offi
cers, commissioned and non-commisioned,
to watch the Fourteenth. Many men are
enlisting in that regiment daily, recruits
as raw as any who joined the volunteers,
and the way they are broken into har
nesa is a revelation to the few who wit
ness the proceedings. Those men are
not weighted down with muskets before
they have learned to carry themselves
properly, and in consequence after two
days a recruit In that regiment has a
more soldierly bearing and is better quali
fied to stand the hardships of a campaign
than volunteers who already look upon
themselves as veterans.
Colonel Johnson of the Sixth Is about
the only officer who seems to have
grasped this idea. Not a battalion line
has been formed since his command went
into camp, but the men have had, and
are daily getting, squad and company
drills, with the result that while his are
the poorest equippedâ many not even be
ing provided with a forage car) â they are

There was joy down in the quarters of
: the battalion of the Second Oregon yester
i day. Lieutenant Colonel Yoran received
1 a dispatch from Colonel Summers, dated
: Ashland, Or., stating that he would ar
rive in camp with the other two battalions
lof the regiment this morning. The news
I spread rapidly among the men. and great
was their delight. Accompanying the
i headquarters is the band, which will liven
!up the Oregonians wonderfully. The bat-
I talion now here is fairly well uniformed
I and armed with 'S4 model Springfields. It
I is also well supplied with camp equipage,
! but, like the Californians, the men require
[ shoes and suitable underclothing. Colonel
i Yoran has received no intimation as to
! when the regiment will be moved to Man
i ila, but he thinks it will be a fortnight at
least before it gets away. If an attempt
is made to supply the men with clothing
suitable for the Philippines he is of the
opinion that it will be even longer.
The regulars are doing plenty of hard
work these days, and with the recruits
that are coming in rapidly the officers
find plenty to occupy their time. The
new men are a very intelligent lot. who
are joining the regulars because there Is
j little chance to enter the volunteer ser-
I vice. The four companies of the Four
teenth Infantry now here, and the two
that will arrive from Alaska this week,
will easily be recruited up to the maxi
mum, but it is doubtful whether enough
men will be secured to fill up the two
skeleton companies and the t"wo new com
panies provided for by the reorganiza
tion law recently passed by Congress.
Lieutenant Hunt, the recruiting officer
of the Fourteenth, was busy mustering in
a lot of recruits yesterday, when a griz
zled veteran of the Rebellion entered the
tent and presented a letter from the
President's secretary demanding that he
be sworn In immediately. The applicant
gave his name as R. W. Patton and his
age as 66 years. Ho said he served through
the Rebellion as a scout, and before the
present war was declared he wrote to
President McKinley tendering his ser
vices to his country again. The letter
from Secretary Porter was in reply and
thanking; the old man for his offer. Lieu
tenant Hunt referred the applicant to the
post surgeon, and Patton started for the
barracks after declaring that if the reg
ulars would not accept him the volunteers
would be glad of his services.
Colonel Bern' of the Seventh California
is surprised and highly gratified at the
comparative freedom from sickness of his
men, notwithstanding the radical change
of climate and their poor equipment. Last
Saturday eight men reported at sick call.
Sunday," the day it rained so hard, there
were 27; Monday. IS, and only 5 yesterday,
when the weather had moderated. Most
of these cases were of a trivial nature.
Private Fichloter, Company A, was sent
to the Marine Hospital yesterday, as he
was suffering from pneumonia. The reg
iment was inspected in light marching
order by companies yesterday by Captain
Carrlngton, U. S. A., to verify the muster
rolls. Every man was present. Within
the last day or two the men have been
given more freedom, which is greatly ap
preciated. For a time it was necessary
to hold them close in camp, as they were
liable to be called upon at any time by
the mustering officer.
A number of ladies from Oakland visit
ed the Seventh yesterday and provided all
the men with "comfort bags," which are
greatly appreciated.
Seven men from Riverside and two from
San Diego have been enlisted as bands
men in the Seventh. There are enough
good musicians in the regiment, who will
be detached for band duty to form an
excellent band of twenty-three pieces.
Requisition has been made for instru
ments, and in a few days Colonel Berry
will have his band hard at practice.
The men of the Sixth and Seventh regi
ments are in want of shoes. When this
want is supplied they will be quite com
fortable.
Colonel Smith's regiment was made
happy yesterday by the arrival of a large
quantity of quartermaster's stores, and
the wofk of issuing shoes, underclothing
und mess utensils was be^un at once.
This regiment is being fitted out first, a 9
it is expected that it will be the first of
the volunteers to proceed to Manila. A
large number of spades and kitchen-ware
was also supplied to the regiment. The
spades wil be used for throwing up forti
fications, etc.
During the day the First had a long,
hard drill on the hill south of the camp.
Private W. J. Furey. Company L, First
Infantry, fell while romping in the com
pany street last evening and broke hia

Colored Men Organizing.
OAKLAND. May 17.â 1f a second call
comes from President McKinley for more
troops to Invade lands of the Spaniards
he will find 300 colored volunteers In this
city awaiting his summons. A meeting
was held in Bethel Church last evening
for the purpose of organizing colored
troops, and in a very short time the
names of 300 were on the roll. The meet-
Ing was called by Major Peney and Cap
tain Keeling of this city. The church was
crowded to the doors by those eager to
fight for the nation and their friends. Sev
eral speakers addressed the audience and
then the roll was thrown out for signa
tures. But very little time was wasted
by those anxious to go to war, and a
formidable body of men ready for servica
was soon listed. The troops will be drilled
once a week by their commanders, and
by the time a second call comes, if one
does, the colored soldiers of Oakland will
be among the first to offer their services,
whether or not the mission they are want^
ed to perform be one of war or peace.

THE LATE JUDGE CAMPBELL.
ABOVE the bier of the late Judge Campbell
tho9e who during his life had occasion to criti
cize him, perhaps with haishness, can pay a
sincere tribute to his worth. A unique figure in the
community, he had become a power; and as this
power extended into the homes of the lowly it was
far more for good than for evil.
Judge Campbell's manner of conducting his court
was so unusual, the relations he bore toward chronic
offenders so without precedent, as to create the hasty
impression that a farce was being enacted. In sober
truth Campbell was a just man as well as humane.
Under the apparent levity there was the working of a
logical mind. With certain forms of crime he had
no patience. The workman, indiscreetly intoxicated,
never found him a terror to face, but was sure of
words of kindly counsel, perhaps a chidiug. It was
thus the Judge won friends and kept them.
In private life Judge Campbell was genial, and the
humblest could address him without fear of rebuff.
The same feeling which on the bench induced him to
adjust family quarrels, to urge a bickering husband
and wife to "kiss and make up," was characteristic of
him always. His heart was easily touched. The poor
never vainly asked him for aid. So the poor regarded
him as their great and good friend, and long will they
remember him.
THE LATE F^AINS.
THE tardy rains coming at an unwonted season
have done considerable damage to the hay and
the cherry crop, but for all that the good re
sulting has far outweighed the evil. All parts of the
State have been badly in need of rains, and so serious
was the damage threatened by the prolonged drought
that every shower is welcomed as a general benefit.
.The effect of the rain has been most notable in the
fruit districts. Orchardists Vho a week ago were
facing the probability that their crops would drop
from the trees from lack of moisture are now san
guine of a fairly good output. The benefit to those
who have planted trees this season, or whose orchards
are but one or two years old, is even greater, for the
drought threatened them with a loss of every newly
planted tree. This danger is now virtually a thing of
the past. The showers have been sufficient in most
localities to give the young plantations a good start,
and if proper care and cultivation be now given they
have a reasonable assurance of outliving the summer
and its inevitable dry season.
Reports from the various fruit counties are to the
effect that the output of fruit for the year will be much
better than at one time was feared. There will not be
enough to overstock the market, but there promises
to be plenty to yield the orchardist a profitable return
for the capital invested in his orchard and the labor
he has put on it. The State will receive a considerable
revenue, and as a consequence all lines of business will
be improved.
Now that one good rain has come at this late sea
son we can with some reason indulge the hope of
more. The prospects are good for further showers
before the prevailing weather conditions change into
those which accompany the settlement into the dry
season. Every one that comes will improve the inter
ests of the State. Every drop that falls will be money
in the pocket of the orchardist, the farmer and the
stockraiser. We may have after all, therefore, a good
season and find our full share of the prosperity which
the outcome of the year promises to the nation at
large.
Society girls are said to be trying to organize a
regiment of dudes to send to the front. Everybody
will wish them success the most complete. Of course
the Spaniard once subdued will be in need of train
ing in the niceties of etiquette. Yet the girls run
some risks. Have they forgotten the Malay beauties
with which the Philippines abound? They think their
beautiful beaux will be back in time for the routs of
next winter, when, in fact, the danger that they may
not wish to come back is little short of appalling.
The establishment of a press censorship would not
be viewed with disfavor. There is not alone dissatis
faction that the plans of the navy are betrayed to
Spain, but the lies told by some of the saffron fellows
have become tiresome.
According to late reports the first boats out of the
St. Michael region will bring $25,000,000. This is
cheering news, but before fully accepting it human in
credulity craves a sight of the gold.
What a dreary stretch of monotony the war in At
lantic waters would be if the dispatch boats of the
yellow faker did not occasionally give the enemy a
scare.
Polo y Bernabe gives every outward indication of
being a spy. It is time for neutral Canada to give him
what is known in this country as the grand bounce.
TAXATION UNDER THE CHARTER.
r\ NSWERING the allegation that the proposed
j\ new charter sets up a limit on taxation under
* * which sufficient money cannot be raised to
conduct the government which it establishes, ami that,
therefore, it will be necessary to apply to the State
Board of Equalization for an increase in the assess
ment after levy, the organ of Mayor Phelan says:
"The financial affairs of the city under the new char
ter will be settled in Juneâ some months before the
State Board of Equalization takes up the San Fran
cisco assessment. The amount of money to be raised
in this city will be limited by the Assessor's figures."
If this were true it would be a complete reply to
the allegation to which the organ refers. But it is
far from the fact, as are most statements put forth in
support of the financial system of the charter. In
deed, it is doubtful whether the method of levying
taxes set up by the instrument is not void for uncer
tainty, or unconstitutional on the ground that it con
templates taxation without a hearing. It is a first
principle that the government cannot take a man's
property by taxation without giving him a chance to
question the justice of the assessment.
Section 2 of chapter 4, article IV, of the charter
enacts that "the Assessor shall assess all taxable prop
erty within the city and county at the time and in the
manner prescribed by the general laws of the State."
The provisions of these general laws may be sum
marized as follows:
1. Between the first Mondays of March and July
the Assessor must make up an assessment roll of all
taxable property. (Section 3628, Political Code.)
2. On or before the first Monday of July in each
year the Assessor must complete the assessment book
and attach his affidavit thereto, delivering it thereafter
to the clerk of the Board of Supervisors. (Sections
3652 and 3654)
3. The Board of Supervisors must meet to equalize
assessments, but it must not continue in session later
than the third Monday in July. (Section 3672.)
4. Upon the completion of equalization the roll
must be turned over to the Auditor, who must add up
the valuations. (Section 3727)
5. Before the second Monday of August the Aud
itor must prepare from the assessment book duplicate
statements. (Section 3728.)
6. The Board of Supervisors must meet on the
third Monday in September and fix the rate of county
taxes, designating the number of cents on each $100
valuation. (Section 37*4-)
These sections form a complete system for levying
county taxes. They are in force in this -city at the
present time. Section n of chapter t, article 111 of
the charter says that "on or before the last Monday
of June in each year the Supervisors shall levy the
amount of taxes for city and county purposes re
quired to be levied upon all property not exempt from
taxation." The general law says that the Assessor
need not turn the assessment books over for equaliza
tion until the first Monday in July, and the Super
visors must equalize until the third Monday in July.
Until equalization is finished the board cannot know
the assessed valuation of real and personal property
in the city. How, then, can it fix the rate of taxation
on or before the last Monday-in- June so as to com
ply with the limit of $1 on each $100 of valuation?
Probably in the event of the adoption of the charter
and the discovery that its taxation system will not
work no permanent damage would be done. As soon
as the Supreme Court disposed of the charter provi
sions the general laws would come to the rescue and
taxation would be resumed. But what would happen
in the meantime? The city would certainly be with
out an income from taxation for one year. A year
at least would be consumed in discovering that a levy
made without equalization is invalid.
These facts make plain other facts disclosed in con
nection with the proposed charter. It is quite evident
that on financial subjects the Freeholders did not
know what they were doing.
SPAIN TO BE BENEFITED.
IT is highly probable that Spain may experience a
needed resurrection as the result of the crushing
defeat she must undergo at our hands.
The renewal of vigor by nations and races is not
impossible and has frequent illustrations in history.
Prussia became the leader of the German states under
Frederick the Great. The German people under his
leadership expanded their power and influence in all
directions, but the effort had an exhausting effect and
a weakening reaction prepared them for the mon
strous humiliations put upon them by Napoleon. He
hacked German geography until it was beyond recog
nition. An observer, immersed in the scene of this
throttling of a race, could see no sign of its regenera
tion. The people seemed spent and finished. The
great Frederick's successor was a weakling. Such
military capacity as remained was utilized by the Cor
sican, and such vigor as survived was converted to
his uses against the prostrate nationality which he
walked upon.
From Germany at the beginning of this century to
the Germany of to-day is a far cry, but the change
that appears might well have occupied two centuries
instead of one. Popular education, the athletic train
ing promoted by Father Jahn and carried by "the
Turners" wherever German immigrants have gone,
have wrought the intellectual and physical regenera
tion of a people. It is probable that without being
embossed with the hard hoof of France and smitten
in the teeth by the fist of her neighbor across the
Rhine, German manhood and patriotism might have
slumbered and national decay have become perma
nent.
Spain has no future in her present paths. They lead
to the grave. She is to lose all her exterior posses
sions, and with them the temptations that have cor
rupted her public men. All of, her illusions are to be
destroyed. She is to be taught that Phillip II and
Charles V are dead, and their works have followed
them. The Cid is no more, and no hand among her
people is strong enough to raise the sword of Mu
darra. She has been following dead leaders for a
hundred years. What she needs now is living leaders
who can go where her people are raging and striking
each other and spending themselves in self-destruction
and make them sit down in the dust and ashes of
humiliation and enter upon self-examination. She
needs leaders who will secularize education, tolerate
religious differences and rebuild a nation upon action
and not upon declamation.
If these results issue out of the war the United
States will have been the agent of the new birth of
Spain by the only means that can be used on a
nation suffering the diseases that afflicted her.
We are not fighting an equal enemy; we are con
ducting art insane nation to the lunatic asylum for
treatment. We don't want especially to hurt her, but
she is beside herself and must not be permitted to hurt
us. If we get her to the asylum without killing her
in self-defense, we pray that she may be cured and
come forth the Spain of Ferdinand and Isabella again,
clothed and in her right mind.
Something serious should happen to the corre
spondent and the journal whose ability and circulation
have been devoted to spreading false information as
to the location of the Spanish fleet. ' In time of war
people have been hanged and papers mobbed for a
less offense.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 1898.
ROOSEVELT'S ROUGH RIDERS.
OF all the troops that have been mustered from
among the American people for this war the
one which holds the most conspicuous place
on the national stage and engages the largest part of
general attention is unquestionably that which is
known as Roosevelt's Rough Riders. It has had fame
thrust upon it before it has struck a blow, and will go
to the field with such a blare of trumpets as that which
on the mimic stage heralds the coming of some royal
dignitary.
This of course is one of the caprices of fame and is
due to time, place and circumstance. Roosevelt is
one of the Americans who knows how to keep the
public interested in himself. When Police Commis
sioner in New York he appeared larger in the public
eye and the press than the Mayor of the city or even
the Governor of the State. As Assistant Secretary of
the Navy he completely overshadowed Secretary
Long, cut as large a figure in the administration as a
Cabinet officer, and, to some people, seemed hardly
less important than the President himself.
Such a man operating in New York, having con
nections with clubs and the high social order of the
Knickerbockers, necessarily confers fame upon any
thing in the way of an organization which he per
sonally conducts. Even a Roosevelt cotillon would
make a nine days' talk. In this case, however, he has
added to the attractiveness of his personal command
by the character of the troop he has formed.
Rough riders we have in plenty. Cowboys and
plainsmen of all kinds are not uncommon in the
West. But rough riders headed by a Fifth avenue
resident and composed largely of dandies from the
clubs, polo players, college athletes and young mil
lionaires who got their millions by inheritance and
not by toil, is a sight sufficiently unusual to be spec
tacular. The combination of the dainty darlings of
Bradley Martin ballrooms with the uncombed terrors
of cattle ranges appeals to the imagination, and the
American heart rises in admiration at the sight.
Nor is the thing itself unworthy of admiration. The
essential equality of manhood in the United States ha 9
an impressive manifestation in this association for
service in war of men from the clubs of the metrop
olis with men from the wilds of the mountains and
plains. It is democratic and American in every re
spect. No other nation could organize such a troop
or harmonize such diverse elements of its people for
the common work of patriotism. This feature of the
troop helps to make it popular and will no doubt help
to make it effective. It represents the whole country
and the most diverse classes of its society, and there
fore stands as a splendid embodiment of thÂ» unity of
our people.
The only danger is that praise in this respect for
the Rough Riders may lead to injustice to other
troops. In every regiment that goes out from Cali
fornia, and probably in all from other States, there
will be the same mingling of the rich with the poor,
the college graduate with the cowboy type. These
will represent America as truly as the New York
combination. Full justice should be done to them,
and all praise and admiration should not be given to
the New Yorkers. Perhaps before the war is over
some of them may be even more distinguished than
the company which just now is the cynosure of East
ern eyes and the admiration of the metropolitan press.
A TEXT FROM ThjE CHARTER
THE particular passage of the proposed charter
to which your attention is invited this morning
is found in section 33, article XVI, under the
general heading "Miscellaneous." It reads as fol
lows and is interestin' readin'.
"No deputy, clerk or othe â  employe of the city and
:ounty shall be paid for a greater length of time than
:hat covered by his actual service."
This means much. It means that the fireman dis
abled at his post of duty shall suffer the loss of his
pay while his bones mend or his burns heal. If he is
ordered into a place of danger he will go not merely
at the risk of life and limb, but at the risk of having
his income cut off and his family suffer. It does not
strike us that this is the proper inducement to hold
out to the members of the Fire Department. Natur
ally it will check their usefulness by abating their ar
dor. A man might welljiesitate to place himself in
jeopardy when an injury would be not alone to him
self, but to those dependent upon him for bread.
The policeman is in the same boat. The outcome of
such hazards as he assumes must, by the terms of the
charter, be borne by himself alone. Let him receive
a wound from the pistol of a burglar, or a fracture by
an effort to stop a runaway, and this benign charter
says his pay shall stop.
Both firemen and policemen have now the privilege
of a vacation. This is accorded them not as a favor,
but because a faithful servant is entitled to rest; such
a rest is a part of the reward of his toil. Under the
new charter there will be no vacations. The fireman
or policeman who feels the need of a breath of country
air may go and get it at his own expense. The city
cannot, it would appear, afford to pay him.
Perhaps the school teachers will find the text of
interest. They are accustomed to having vacations on
pay. Their salaries go right on during periods in
which the schools are not in session. There is to be
no more of this under the charter framed for the ben
efit of somebody else. The result must be cutting
down of yearly incomes, not under the present ar
rangement princely. Perhaps it was in view of this
circumstance the Freeholders decided that the schools
were costing more than their worth, and proposed to
cut down the fund devoted to the payment of salaries.
When a text is of itself so clear there is no need of
extensive elucidation. The meaning of the one under
consideration is as plain as possible. It cannot be
twisted to mtan something else. It specifically adds
to the burden of all public servants. If any of the
ladies or gentlemen directly concerned are pleased
with it their reasons are certainly unselfish, and they
must regard themselves as at present underworked
and overpaid.
Without official confirmation from Washington no
body will believe that General Merritt refused to go
to the Philippines. The general is an old soldier and
a good one, not apt to be guilty of insubordination.
Probably the correspondent has once more erredâ an
operation toward which he seems to have a strong
leaning.
A sensitive Alabaman killed four men because they
had twitted him with cowardice. Possibly this did
not prove anything relative to the main question, but
it demonstrated that the epithet is objectionable, and
to be hurled only with discretion.
It is said that the new Cabinet of Spain will favor a
more active war policy. Perhaps this means that the
system of hiding will give way to a more manly fash
ion of coming out in the open and getting licked.
Alaskans are anxious to fight the Spaniards, but
they would have to be sent to the tropics in cold
storage or they would never stand the trip.
Possibly the rain was sent to keep the Oregon sol
diers from feeling neglected and getting homesick.

Sunday afternoon. The gentlemen who
habitually enjoy the luxury of the com
fortable leather-cushioned chairs in that
hostelry were much interested in the
antics of a little lad of 6 years, who was
dressed in the latest and swellest boy
fashion, including the diminutive box coat
which does so much to make youngsters
attractive these clays. He evidently wae
the son of a rich father who lavished
everything on his favorite child.
Presently there appeared on the scene
another lad, of about the same age,
plainly but neatly dressed, and apparently
not so well favored of fortune as the
other. The newcomer had a bundle of
"extras" in his little arms, which he en
deavored to sell by plaintively crying,
"All about the war!" Luck was not with
him. however, and he was about to de
part when he spied the other lad, who had
been intently watching the young mer
chant, who, on his part, now gazed in
open-mouthed admiration at the splendor
of the other's raiment. Then the follow
ing conversation took place: "Do you sell
papers?" The newsvendor replied: "Well,
I try to sell dem, but dese 'geezers' won't
buy any. I started out wid ten, and I
oniy sold two, and it looks as if I was
going to get Btuck on de rest." Then the
first iad, filled with an ambitious desire
to be a merchant like the other, said,
"Let me see if I can sell them," and
with that he took the papers and was
soon importuning the men who had been
watching the little act to invest In his
wares. In five minutes he had sold them
all, and he presented his protege with
$1 40 as the proceeds of the sales, for the
scene had stirred the generous impulses
of the onlookers, who willingly paid more
than the regulation nickel, and the in
creased sum was the result. The little
Samaritan, feeling that he had done a
good deed, tripped gayly upstairs, while
the other, gazing at hia rapidly retreating
figure, said: "Gee! I wish dat fellow
would go in partners wid me. We
would'nt do a t"ingâ not a ting!" Grasp
ing the money tightly in his hand, he
said, "I guess I'll call it a day," and van
ished as the other had done.

THE NEW CHARTER AND THE
CITY HOSPITAL.
No part of city government has been
and still Is more scandalous than the
management of the City and County Hos
pital, and it will be Interesting to ob
serve what methods are proposed in the
new charter to secure a better adminis
tration in the new hospital which is about
to be erected.
Section 3, page 120, decrees that "The
Board of Health shall have management
and control of the city and county hos
pitals, almshouses, ambulance service,
municipal hospitals, receiving hospitals,
etc.," and with the exceptions provided
in article 11. chapter 111, shall have ex
clusive control and disposition of all ex
penditures necessary in the institutions
under itÃ immediate control."
This exception takes away from the
Board of Health the power to contract
for goods, merchandise, stores, supplies,
as well as for all subsistence, supplies,
drugs and other necessary articles for
hospitals and other public institutions.
And here we may ask what sort of man
agement and control will be left the
Board of Health? They are not permit
ted to buy the bedding or other necessary
supplies; they cannot command the kind
and quality of food; they cannot buy the
drugs they require; they must ask leave
to purchase new instruments, new ap
pliances, and they are made dependent
on the Board of Supervisors even for
bandages and dishcloths. Now this 1b ex
actly the same division of authority
which has given the City and County
Hospital its dreadful reputation. It was
under contracts made by the Supervisors
that the beddinff was foul and insuffi
cient; that the flour was musty and the
oatmeal sour; that the meat was tainted
and uneatable; the beef and mutton wore
charged for when poultry was supplied
which never reached the patients; that
wine, whisky and even jewelry were de
livered in the place of groceries, and
only last year it was reported to the
Grand Jury that common drugs were
charged five times their market value.
For years the hospital has been regarded
by the poor as the home of misery and
death, and scores have left it because
they had not enough to eat. Moreover,
Supervisors are bound to take the lowest
blcf, as if cheapness was of advantage to
the sick.
Gentlemen endowed with immense pat
ronage and discretionary power cannot
be trusted, while Supervisors are given
the power to interfere on the most Impor
tant questions of administration and to
make their own terms with the con
tractors as they do now.
The same scandals will continue to pre
vail, and the poor patients and the tax
payers will be the chief sufferers.

MR. HUNTINGTON BEFORE THE
RAILROAD COMMISSION.
To the Editor of the San FranciÃCO
Call: I spent last week in listening to
the interrogation of Collis P. Hunting
ton by the Railroad Commissioners.
With sly humor the United States Su
preme Court had ordered the commis- j
sion to ascertain, as a preliminary to
fixing rates, what the railroads consti
tuting the Southern Pacific system cost
and what they are worth now; and
though the court might just as well
have required the commission to ascer
tain what it cost to accomplish the in
dependence of the United States, and
what it is worth in dollars and cents
after a century of freedom, still Messrs.
La Rue, Hinton and Clark took the
mandate of the court seriously and
probed Mr. Huntington with questions
which neither he nor any one else could
answer, and it never occurred to their
dull minds that they had been sent on
a fool's errand to demonstrate the ab
surdity of the body to which they be
long. They even indulged in a gallery- j
play of assuming that the witness was
fencing with their questions to conceal
the truth, and jibed at him just as
Cotton Mather jibed at the Salem wit
nesses for refusing to explain their re
lations with the devil.
It is silly investigations of this kind
which make California such a laugh
ing-stock in the East. The story of the
building of the Pacific railroad long
ago ceased ip be a mystery requiring
investigation. Nearly forty years ago
it was necessary for the interest and
safety of California that it should be
connected with the East by rail; but
neither the subsidy voted by Congress
nor the land grant supplied money
enough for the purpose. To construct !
the eastern end of the road, oakes !
Ames and Thomas C. Durant flung ;
themselves into the arms of the Credit |
Mobilier, and became financial wrecks ;
wrapped in a black cloud of obloquy: j
the building of the western end de- I
volved on Collis P. Huntington. He j
put his own money into the enterprise \
and induced his associates to put theirs, j
But their combined resources were only I
a drop in the bucket. He went round |
hat in hand to men of means, begging |
vainly for assistance in the work. Of j
the office of every rich man in Sacra- j
mento, San Francisco, New York and
Boston, the doorstep was worn smooth
by his tireless tread. The patience of
every ear was exhausted by his per-
Bistent appeals. But he could make no
converts; there came a time when he
could get no listeners. Men of means
had one invariable reply, "The risk is
too great and the profit, if any, too re
mote."
Tired, but not discomfited, he realized
that if the work was to be done he must
do it himself. He must lift unaided
the stone which the builders rejected.
People would neither buy the bonds nor
i subscribe to the stock of the Central
j Pacific. An idea broke on him. Per
| haps they would take an interest in a
] construction company. So the Con
i tract and Finance Company arose and
was followed by the Western Develop
ment Company. But capitalists were
! as shy of them as they had been of the
j railroad corporation. The risks were
too great, and the profits too remote.
! Thus, not because Mr. Huntington so
desired, but because he could not help
himself, the members of the building
j corporation and the members of the
I railroad corporation were and remained
the same individuals. They could in
duce no one to share their risks, and
their situation was not improved.
There was one chance left. If bonds
and stock were offered to capitalists in
sufficient amounts and at sufficiently
low prices, money might possibly be
got. It was figured out that offers of
$40,000 a mile in bonds, supplemented
by an equal amount of stock, might
perhaps unloose the purse strings of
i some who were rich and avaricious.
1 And they did. The securities were
1 sold at a large discount. But they were
; sold, sparsely and slowly. The road
j had been running about ten years be
i fore the Contract and Finance Com
j pany paid off the last of the floating
! debt it had incurred to carry them. It
had peddled its bonds and stock in Bos
ton and New York at all manner of
prices, and had borrowed money on
them where it could not sell. It is not
likely that either the Contract and Fi
nance Company, or the parties with
whom it dealt, remembered, twelve
months after their transactions, the ex
act terms of each, but now, thirty years
afterward. Mr. La Rue seriously asks
Mr. Huntington what the bonds real
ized, and Mr. Hinton, with a sad
air and a weary rocking of his head,
whines that the ends of Justice are de
feated because the president of the
Southern Pacific does not state at a
blow, from his own recollections, how
much money the Contract and Finance
Company received for securities which |
took nearly twenty years to market, j
Yet Mr. La Rue bears the reputation of i
being an intelligent citizen, and we j
have Mr. Hinton's own assurance that
he is a man of virtue.
Further designing that the Railroad
Commission shall make itself ridicu
le-us the court required it to ascertain
what the various properties constitut- ;
ing the Southern Pacific are worth
now. The only parallel on record is the j
question of the old schoolmaster who i
insisted that his pupils should state j
the size erf a piece of chalk. Railroad â 
properties fluctuate in value from year j
to year and from month to month, with
the vicissitudes of business and the
prospects of traffic. They are worth
more when crops are good than when
they are lean. Their value is less in
a season of drought than in a season
of copious rainfall; in a year when
trade is dull, than in a year when it is j
brisk; at a period when traffic is divid- j
ed by competition than at a period
when the recoipts are pooled. Yet the
Supreme Court required the Commis
sion to elicit from Mr. Huntington an
arbitrary and definite appraisement of !
the various roads which constitute the
Southern Pacific system, and the Com
missioners affected indignation when
he confessed his inability to do so. The
patience with which the old gentleman
played the part for which he was cast
in this fool play was really admirable.
Some vague conjectures as to values
may be derived from his admissions
that of the $150,000,000 of stock in the
Southern Pacific, $120,000,000 have been i
issued, and that shares are selling for
12 to 13 cents o-n the dollar; also, that
the $50,000,000 capital of the Southern
Pacific Railroad of California is repre- '
sented by shares which are locked up
in a trust, and have no present market
value at all. But how a knowledge of j
these approximations could help the i
commission to raise or lower rates of
freight it would puzzle a conjurer to
determine.
The head and front of Mr. Hunting
ton's offending is that he has made
money, which is gall and wormwood to
the demagogue and the impecunious.
Of course he has made money. Men
like Vanderbilt and Huntington always
make money, whatever enterprises they
undertake. Shrewd, thrifty, far-sight"
cd. Indefatigable, they were certain to
grow rich whether they constructed
railroads, or built stfamers, or dug
canals, or erected rows of hou?^~ or
dealt In real estate or merchandise.
Such men, of course, are rare, very
rare. It is quite possible that, thirty
years ago, no other man but Collis P.
Huntington could have constructed the
Pacific railroad In the face of the
enormous difficulties of the task and
the prodigious obstacles he had to over
come. Dogged resolution and indomit
able perseverance are exceptional. If
Mr. Huntington had not reaped a re
ward for labor pursued for so many
years with such unremitting persist
ence, his case would have been a re
markable exception to the rule of life.
But now, aa in the days of Seneca, it ia
the practice of the multitude to bark
at eminent men, as little dogs bark at
strangers. JOHN BONNER.

ELECTION BOARDâ A Reader. Hay
wards, Cal. There is nothing in the law
that says that a man who has been nomi
nated for a county office shall not serve
as an officer of an election board. The
rule, however, has been that if a candi
date has been chosen to serve on the
board he would send in his declination
of the appointment.
WATER RATES â Enquirer, Colusa.
Cal. The Jaw of this State on the subject
of water rates says that "such rates shall
be fixed at a regular or special session of
the Board of Supervisors or other legis
lative body held during the month of Feb
ruary of each year, and shall take effect
on the first day of July thereafter, and
shall continue in full force and effect for
the term of one year, aafd no longer." It
is held that this means that once tixcl
the rates cannot be changed during the
year thereafter.
LEAVING THE STATEâ Subscriber,
City. The law of California says that
"persons belonging to the military forces
while attending to military duty are ex
empt from arrest on civil process." This
is repeated in the section of the Political
Code, under the head of National Guard.
If it had been intended to cover the Na
tional Guard only the section would have
read: "Persons belonging to the Na
tional Guard" Instead of "to the military
forces." It follows from this that as a
debtor who attempts to leave the State
can be arrested only on civil process.
an officer or any one else of the
military forces cannot be arrested. Then,
further. It is doubtful if a court would
issue a warrant for the arrest of an of
ficer leaving the State under orders from
the War Department. The fact that he
was leaving the State under orders to
perform military duty would not be con
strued into an attempt to leave the State
for the purpose of defrauding his cred
itors.
CONTRABANDS OF WARâ A. S..
Cherokee. Cal. It is not a departure from
neutrality to furnish to either of two na
tions at war supplies which do not fall
within the description of contraband of
warâ that is, arms and munitions of war,
and things out of which munitions of
war are made. A neutral country may
carry on ordinary trade with either bel
ligerent, except when prevented by block
ade, but ships that carry on trade in the
ordinary line of commerce must not have
on board articles that are contraband of
war, nor must a coterminous land fron
tier be crossed by such commodities By
law and practice of nations, it Is for the
admiralty courts of the capturing power
to decide what is and what is not contra
band of war. At various times discus
sions have arisen whether corn, hay or
coal can ever be included in the list of ar
ticles of contraband of war. They are
obviously articles of peaceful commerce,
but they are also essential to the main
tenance of an army and sometimes a
supply would give one belligerent a great
advantage over the other, especially as to
coal in the present age of war steamers.

to determine which dog can claim the
proud distinction of being the best of
the respective breed.
The ribbons bestowed on competitors

Rlue denotes first prize in the class.
Rod denotes second prize in the class.
White denotes third prize in the class.
Yellow denotes a special prize.

MRS. PINKHAM CONQUERS BACKACHE.
Four Women Who Owe Their Present Happiness to Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound.
tDEAR Mrs. Pixkitam: â When I wrote to you last June,
I was not able to do anything. I suffered with back-
ache, headache, bearing-down pains, pains in my lower
limbs, and ached all through my body. Menstruations
were very painful. I was almost a skeleton. I fol-
lowed your advice and now am well and fleshy, and able
td do all my own housework. I took medicine from a
physician for over a year, and it did not do me a particle
of good. I would advise all suffering women to write
to Mrs. Pinkham. She will answer all letters promptly,
and tell them how to cure those aches and pains so com-
mon to women. â Mrs. C. L.Wikn, Marquez, Texas.
I think it is my duty to write and let you know what
your medicine has done for me. For two years I suffered
with female weakness, bearing-down pains, headache,
backache, and too frequent occurrence of the menses.
I was always complaining. My husband urged me to

â¢ â¢â '.""â â . .
Fears for the safety of the British
ship Leyland Bros., from Calcutta for
San Francisco with grain bags and
jute, have been partially allayed. The
vessel is now out 144 days and as much
as 10 per cent reinsurance has been
paid on her. Yesterday the Merchants'
Exchange received a cable from Lon
don, stating that on March SO last, In
latitude 20 north, longitude 145 west, the
Leyland Bros, was spoken in a partly
dismantled condition. She was prob
ably caught in the same storm that al
most wrecked the Willscott and caused
that vessel to put in here in distress.
When spoken the Leyland Bros, was
about 500 miles due east of Hawaii but
as the chances are that she is coming
along: under a jury rig she may not be
expected here for some time.
No word has come from the British
bark Midas, which is supposed to have
been caught in the same storm that dis
abled the Willscott and Leyland Bros.
She is now out ninety-two days from
Nagasaki for Astoria, and 70 per cent re
insurance has been paid on her. It is
feared that she has gone down with all
hands.
The steamer Umatilla arrived from
Puget Sound ports yesterday with an
other contingent of troops from Wash
ington. The boys seem to have been
recruited in a hurry, as gome of them
wore without guns and others
were only half-uniformed, while a few
were in civilian clothes. In a few
days Uncle Sam will have them all
fitted out. and then they will present
a soldier-like appearance. The trip
down the coast was a very rough one
and nearly all the guardsmen suffered
from mal-de-mer.
Owing to delay in the arrival of the
English mail, the steamer Mariposa will
not get away for Australasia before
to-morrow at 2p. m. Owing to the
war scare she will not carry many pas
sengers, but she has a very large cargo,
mostly canned goods, bicycles, plows
and hardware. About fifty passengers
will go away in the cabin, and while
that is considered a small list, it is
large when compared with the four
cabin passengers who sailed from Syd
ney from Victoria, B. C, in the War
rimoo a few days ago.
The old bark Canada, which went
ashore at Skaguay in a gale last win
ter, is to be turned into a barge. The
hull and cargo were sold for $2250 and
her new owners will .salve the cargo
and take the mast out of her, after
whtoh she will be cut down.
The following is an extract from a
letter written in Cardiff, Wales, on
April 29 last, by a British ship captain
who left here a few months ago with a
cargo of wheat for Liverpool: "All th&
people in this country sympathize with
our Yankee cousins, and I wish Amer
ica every success. I was at the thea
ter last night and in the middle of the
j performance the manager came on the
j stage and told the audience that Amer
ica had bombarded Matanzas. There
was a great spectacle after he an
i nounced it. Some person cried out
three cheers for America, and the whole
i audience stood up and cheered and
| waved their hats and sticks. It was a
i grand sight." â¢
The bark Alden Besse was cleared
for Honolulu yesterday. She was sold
a month ago for the cannery trade and
a deposit was paid to bind the bargain.
As she will not be wanted for the
Alaska business for a few months, she
will make a few more trips to the isÂ»
ands for sugar.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Bertha arrived from Unalaska
yesterday. She left four days after the
Portland, but brings very little addi
tional news. Work on the river steam
ers was progressing satisfactorily and
the chances are that all of them will
be ready for the opening of the river
next month.
The bark Rufus E. Wood will be thÂ«
next sailing vessel to get away with
gold hunters. She is bound for St.
Michael and will transfer her passen
pvrs and freight to the Alaska-Yukon
i Transportation Company's river steam.

PLOTTED FOR
RAWHIDE COLD
Further Developments in
the Scandal From
Fresno.
The Son of the Millionaire
Tells of Interesting
Conversations.
He Played the Hole of a Detective
and Succeeded to His Own
Satisfaction.
Two witnesses were examined yesterday
afternoon in Judge Joachlmsen's court In
relation to the alleged plot of Myron H.
Azhdaerian, Mrs. Elsie Williams and Mrs.
Grace Loose to obtain a portion of the
gold from the Rawhide mine. One of them
was the son of the complaining witness
and he proved that he is possessed of a
most retentive memory.
At 2 o'clock, when the hearing was to
be resumed, there was a disposition not
to go on, as a mark of respect to the
memory of Judge Campbell, but after a
consultation with the Judge it was de
cided to proceed. District Attorney
Barnes.Assistant District Attorney Dunne
and Prosecuting Attorney Graham rep
resented the prosecution, and Attorney
G. W. Baker, ex-Judge Ferral and Attor
ney Church of Fresno appeared for the
defendants.
Mrs. Williams took shorthand notes of
young Nevills' evidence, and when he
said anything to raise a laugh she and
her sister joined heartily in the hilarity.
David Stetson, a barber in Fresno, was
the first witness. He testified to shaving
Azhdaerian in February last in a house
at 31U South L, street, Fresno. He saw
Elsie Williams and some other Indies
there. Azhdaerian showed him a bank
book and told him that he had that day
made a deposit in the bank of $20W)
W. E. Nevills, son of Captain Isevills,
the complaining witness, was then culled.
He related a number of conversations
with Azhdaerian. and in cross-examina
tion repeated them almost word for word.
He was introduced to Azhdaerian, he
said, in Jamestown in November last,
while drinking in the bar of a hotel, lie
Bftld to Azhdaerian, "You have been bay
ing pretty hard things about my. father.
'i en he told Azhuaerian that he was
Standing behind a s< reeu and overheard
him telling his stepmother that his
father had been Intimate with Elsie Wil
liams fur three years. Azhdaerian at
lirst denied it, but linally confessed, and
â aid that he could prove it. He had a
great many letters from Captain NÂ«vilM
to -Mrs. Williams and he would use them
against him. , .
"I then." said the witness, "asked him
about his case against the San Jose Mer
cury for $50,000 damages, and he said that
it was all right, as he had three witnesses
against one."
Witness said he next saw Azhdaerian
in Fresno in the early part of December,
when they went to a house on South L,
street. Azhdaerian told him that he had
listened t<Â» a conversation at the house
between Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Loose and
the captuin when they were trying to ad
just matters, but nothing satisfactory re
sulted and the women threatened to
show the captain up. He and Azhdaerian
took a walk and witness made up his
mind to draw him out. Azhdaerian told
him that his father had been saying some
hard things apiinst him. If tney could
tret thÂ« captain to marry Mrs. Williams
they would have him in their hands. In
the latter part of December they were to
get $<M>o out of the captain and would
then commence suit against him and fight
him with his own money. Speaking of the
Shortridge case. Azhdaerian said that if
Dolan had not squealed i..ey would have
got the money.
Witness then spoke of his introduction
to Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Loose. Azh
daerian had paid his fare down to Fresno
from this city and they arrived about 1
o clock in the morning. They went to the
house on South L street, and he was in
troduced to the two women and Attorney
Church, who was there at the time. They
had some liquor, and after Church left
witness gave them to understand that he
hated the very ground the old man walk
ed on. Mrs. Williams spoke of a letter
she had written to Azhdaerian when he
was in Jamestown, in which she men
tioned about commencing suit against the
captain, and she added she would black
mail him out of $25,000. They were going
to push the Shortridge suit, and the wo
men said they could depend upon Myron
to stick to them.
The next conversation wit-iess had with
Azhdaerian was in this city. He told wit
ness that his father was sick and he
should go and see him at the Palace Ho
tel They met a few hours later and Azh
daerian said the old man was better and
was sitting up in bed smoking. Three or
four days later witness called upon his
father and found him a very sick man.
Later in the month he met Azhdaerian,
who told him that they had got some
money out of the old man and his share
was $1000. Three or four weeks ago they
again met. and witness told Azhdaerian
that he had no further use for him
in cross-examination witness cheerfully
admitted that in telling azhdaerian that
he overheard what was said to his step
mother while he was behind a screen he
was a liar. He also admitted that he had
been on very bad terms with his ffither
and had spoken to others besides Azhdue
rian in hard language about the old man.
He drew out Azhdaerian just for his own
benefit, as it might be useful. He admit
ted there was no occasion for it at the.
time He had taken the Koeleycuro since.
He 'then repeated the conversations he
had with Azhdaerian almost word for
W 'iutorney Baker then referred to the
death of Judge Campbell, and after pay-
Ing a hl K h tribute to his memory asked
that the court adjourn out of respect to
the deceased jurist. The other attorneys
concurred, and the court adjourned The
case will be continued Friday afternoon.

SOLDIERS WILL
BE WELCOMED
They Will Be Met at the
Ferries by the Red
Cross Society.
Coffee and Sandwiches to Be
Given Them Before the
March to Camp.
PJans Being Made to Carry On the
Work of Belief in the
Philippines.
The incoming troops will not be al
lowed to pass the ferry building with
out a welcome to California. Yester
day the officers of the Salvation Army
offered the services of their organiza
tion to the Red Cross Society and they
stated their willingness to take charge
of the work of providing refreshments
for the soldiers as they are landed from
the ferries and escorting them to the
camping ground at the Presidio. When
the companies that recently came from
Portland marched off the boats at the
foot of Market street there was no one
there to meet them and tell tfie strang
ers the way to the camp. The men
were hungry and tired from their long
trip from Oregon, and they were
obliged to tramp all the way to the
Presidio with no one to even offer them
a drink of water. It will now be dif
ferent. Hot coffee generously sup
plied and a good substantial lunch will
be waiting for all the soldiers who are
to arrive when they step from the
boats and some one who knows the way
will pilot them to the camp. The offi
cers of the Salvation Army have had
much experience in giving lunches to
hungry men and the Red Cross Society
could not trust a better organization
to carry on that branch of the work
they have undertaken. It will be a
practical California welcome to the men
and at the same time the troops will
receive an introduction to the Red
Cross Society the moment they reach
the city.
Money is what is now most needed
by the Red Cross Society. It was de
cided yesterday by the organization to
send a representative of the society
with the troops to Manila to superin
tend the work of the Red Cross among
the troops when they reach the field of
their battles, and money will be the
most necessary thing he can have. That
action was decided on after a confer
ence with the medical authorities of the
United States army. The financial
agent of the society who will be sent
to the front will be required' to give a
bond for the faithful performance of
his duties. Funds will be placed at his
disposal on arrival at the Philippines
and he shall from time to time pur
chase such supplies not furnished by
the army medical department as may
be required on the requisition of the
chief medical officer of the troops. The
agent will, in his judgment, extend the
benefaction of the Red Cross to all,
friends or foes, who may be in distress
in accordance with the articles of the
treaty of Geneva.
The fund up to yesterday collected by
the society amounted to close to $14,000.
Among the subscriptions received yes
terday were: Grace Chuch, $191 30;
Sequoia Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution, $50; C. B. Wat
son, $25; Mrs. T. W. Parke, $25; Utica
Mining Company, $100; ladies of Hop
land, $39; Pacific Heights School, $15 35,
and Henry T. Peman, $25.
The Needlework Guild of America has
decided to co-operate with the Red
Cross Society, and at a meeting held
at the residence of Mrs. Horace Davis
on Monday it was decided to send a
quantity of underclothing to the
soldiers at once and to follow the dona
tions through the individual effort of
each of the sections of the guild in the
city.
The Lincoln Relief Corps, an auxil
iary to the Grand Army of the Re
public, donated $20 to the fund of the
Red Cross.
The ladies of Visalia have organized
a branch of the Red Cross in that city.
Miss Frances Butz has taken the initia
tive in the organization, and subscrip
tion blanks are now being circulated
there. The Oakland, Alameda, Berke
ley and Vallejo branches are now doing
energetic work, and Los Angeles prom
ises to give much needed support. All
the auxiliary organizations will be
asked to appoint delegates to attend a
general meeting that will soon be called
to more thoroughly organize a State
society.
On Thursday evening the Pac'flc
Coast Woman's Press Association will
give a benefit entertainment at Native
Sons' Hall, and on Friday afternoon
little Paloma Schramm will give a re
cital at Sherman, Clay & Co.'s hall.
Both entertainments will be for the
benefit of the Red Cross.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath it. If any. the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lin^e. equal
temperature. The wont "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the" Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 17.â To-day's advance In
the price nf stocks was the result of a move
ment of professional operators to renew the
upward course of prices. These operators
argued that the market had undergone a fair
degree of reaction during yesterday and the
lattpr part of last week. The reaction had In
vited a fair short interest and had wiped out
the holders on the long side of speculation.
This represented an improvement in the tech
nical conditions of the market. The day's
trading started off with the advantage o f an
Improvement in London, where prices of Amer
ican securities were advanced a sharp fraction
all around. There was also some buying for
London at the opening here, but London after
ward turned seller when prices had risen.
There are a number of stocks which enjoy the
special support of friends and inside interests
and these imparted firmness by sympathy to
the rest of the market. The combination of
ihepe circumstances made the bulls fefi war
ranted in pushing up the prices of their fa
vorites without waiting for more definite de
velopments of the naval situation In West In
dian waters. There was no evidence of any
large outside Interest and any slackening of
the professional demand precipitated dullness
The absence of outside demand was Indicated
clearly also by the way in which prices tell
away In the realizing movement In the final
hour. The day's extreme advances were cur- j
tailed from % to % by this movement, but net '
advances of between 1 and 2 poir.ts for the
principal stocks still remained. Tobacco led
the list in point of activity. This stock shows
a net gain of 2%.
The rates for time money went lower, to 3
per cent for sixty days, 8% per cent for ninety
days and 4 per cent for four months. The
abundant supply of money in the country and
a prospect of a trade balance for a year in
our favor of over $900,000,000 are taken much
account of by those who study the speculative
outlook. A plethora of money seeking employ
ment and a continued foreign demand for our
products means an era of higher prices and
of- speculative and industrial activity.
Bonds were quiet but higher all around.
Sales 51.6T.0.000. United States new 4a fell %
and- the 5s % In the bid price. There was a
sale of the new 4b (registered) at an advance
â¢nf 3% over the last sale, which was several

here opened a trifle better to-day in the ab- i
- sence of other disquieting speeches and closed
unchanged in all except Americans, where the
pressure to sell has abated and which closed :
good on New York support. The New York
power of absorption excites surprise. It is be
lieved yesterday's sale to brokers there was as
1 much as 40,000 shares.
1 The ease in money is due to release of more
Japanese money and the operation of the Bank
of England's policy in making advances free
'â¢ of interest repayable in gold bullion.

CHICAGO GRAIN M^.^ET.
CHICAGO, May After a rather wide
fluctuation Wheat closed weak. Peace rumors
had some Influence, but there were apparently
very clear evidences that Letter brokers were
disposed to sell all the July the market would
take. Early Liverpool cables were %i(?3d
higher for July. Heaviness of u-e domestic i
receipts, however, overshadowed in the minds
of traders the Liverpool advance. The weather
map Indicated higher temperature throughout
'. the West. Heavy rains fell In the Northwest,
where most needed. The California crop has
freshened up wonderfully since last Saturday.
Reports from Russia Bay that the state of win
ter Wheat in that country is generally satis
factory, only a few of the central districts
having suffered. July opened unchanged at
$1 09U. ranged from $109 to $1 10, declined to
i $1 07 and rallied to $1 OS bid at the close. Sep
tember opened VÂ«c lower at 91 %c, sold up to
' 92c. reacted to $S%c and closed at 89% c bid.
May closed at $1 49% asked.
| Corn was depressed by more favorable weath
er conditions and poor cash demand. July
closed %c lower. .
Oats trade was Inconsequential. July closed
with a loss of %c.
Provisions made two turns to-day, weak at
the opening, strong later, showing an advance j
of 30c over yesterday's final quotation, caused
! by frond buying, and' closed weak. The close I
! for July Pork was 22% c lower. Lard 17Vic

HONORING THE
DEAD JURIST
Marks of Respect Generally
Paid to the Memory of
Judge Campbell.
i
Eulogistic Tributes Showered on the
Magistrate's Name â Widow
Prostrated.
The expressions of sorrow around the
Police Courts yesterday over the death of
Judge Campbell were universal. Judge
Conlan is away on his vacation, but
Judges Joachimsen and Low met at 10
o'clock in the morning and the latter was
made presiding Judge.
Judge Low at once went to the late
Judge's court, and after calling it to or
der Prosecuting Attorney Spinetti ad
dressed the court, and, after announcing
the death of Judge Campbell, moved that
an adjournment be taken In respect to
the memory of the dead jurist. Judge
Low then ordered all the cases on the cal
endar continued until . to-day and . the
court adjourned.
As yet no arrangements for the funeral
have been made. The widow of the ue
ceased is prostrated with grief over the
sudden taking off of her husband. â¢
The funeral services; will be under the
auspices of the South San Francisco Ma
sonic Lodge, and the interment may take
place Friday or Saturday, but possibly not
before Sunday.
As soon- as Mrs. Campbell receivers suf
ficiently from her illness she will comer
with her nephew, Archie Campbell, and
the Masonic lodge, and the arrangements
will be completed.
It is believed that a successor to Judge
Campbell will be appointed immediately.
While it was contended by some that the
Governor has the power to . fill the va
cancy, those' most conversant with ' the
law state that the" appointing power "lies
with the Board of Supervisors, and the
latter contention is undoubtedly correct.
But little difficulty in finding an available
candidate will be met with. i
It is said that Dr. W. J. Gavlgan has
already been decided upon. His friends J
worked until late last night in his behalf, !
and although many prominent politicians
are seeking the position made vacant by
death Dr. Gavigan, his friends are cer- '
tain, will be appointed.
At a meeting of the Phoenix Republican '
Club held last night resolutions of con- I
dolence for the sorrowing family of the
deceased were passed, and the club soon i
after adjourned out of respect for the I
dead. .
CELTIC UNION FAIR.
Preparations' for the Benefit of the
â  Irish Hall Nearing Completion.
A most enthusiastic meeting of the
Celtic Union was held last evening at
Knights of the Red Branch Hall, on
O'Farrell street. Colonel Thomas F.
Barry presided,' and fully 100 members,
representing all of the twenty societies
in the union, were in evidence to attest
to the deep interest taken by the Irish
men of this city in the proposed Irish
fair for the benefit of the Celtic Union
Hall. - .
Jeremiah Deasy, chairman of the exec
utive committee of the fair, and Mana
ger Buckley made reports on. the progress
of the work. A number of letters were
read from prominent citizens who had
been invited to serve â¢on the ; honorary
board, all willingly accepting â¢â  and ex
pressing hearty sympathy in the work
and a firm belief that the big fair could
not help but be successful and net a
considerable amount of . money for ' the
cause.'- â '. -:' â ; '.â  'â :â 'â :--- '- ;' â  ' : - â¢â *;;
Mayor Phelan consented -not only to
permit his name to be .used, but ex
pressed a desire to assist by active work,
and he will probably be called upon to

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 1898.
ROLLING MILLS
TO BE CLOSED
The Big Concern Had No
Practical Head as
Manager.
Doubtful Whether It Will Redeem ;
Its Obligations to the
Bondholders.
'â¢ The Pacific Rolling Mills, which at one
i time were the pride of San Francisco, are
about to close their gates as one of the
industries of this coast. : :t: t ?
Bad management is â¢ said .to be â . the
; cause of the failure rather than a lack of!
patronage. A gentleman in close touch
-with the kind of work turned out at the
mills gave it as his opinion that there is
| room for a first-class rolling mill % plant
! in this city provided it was properly con
â  ducted by practical men who y have a
knowledge of the work to be turned out.
He said:
"The great trouble with the present
I management of the mills was that â  the
directors overloaded their superintendent
by heaping upon his shoulders the work
! of three men. Previous to the late James
G. Fair assuming control of the mills j
there was a first-class salesman connect- j
: ed with them, but he was discharged, as
i were others who thoroughly understood
their business, and incompetent hands
taken on, whose only interest was the i
wages they drew for their labors. Be- j
sides this, contracts were taken for the ]
building, of street railroads in this city j
and Los Angeles, and bonds were taken
in payment for. the same. When those
roads went under the mills suffered as a
consequence, and the bonds fell short of
realizing what they called for. In addi- j
tion to this, a spirit of competition en-. j
! tered into the management against the I
i very men from whom it derived its pa- j
tronage and support. This, as a conse- i
quence, caused orders to be sent' East \
that by right would be given to the home !
mill. Through all of this it failed to
keep in line with the progressive spirit i
of the age, both in machinery, and |
method. It had capital, but it lacked
brains." â¢
In consequence of its neglected condi
tion it is doubtful whether it will redeem
its obligations. There are sets of mort
gage bonds out. The first bear interest
at the rate of 6 per cent and .aggregate â 
$213,000. There are also outstanding. $500,- !
000 worth of second mortgage bonds with i
interest at 5 per cent. The principal hold- ,
er of the coupons is the Fair estate,
which carries 570,000 worth. D. O. Mills
is also a creditor to a considerable
amount. These, with other bondholders :
and other creditors, have claims against
the. Pacific Rolling Mills aggregating â¢
$soo.ooo.
The principal stockholders in the con
cern are the Fair estate, with 100,000 j
shares; George Whittell, 1200 shares; Ed- j
ward Coleman, 1000 shares; Parrott estate, j
1000 shares; J. C. Wilmerdlng estate, 1000; j
Louis ivlonteagle, 500 shares; Calvin Paige,
500 shares. The Luning estate also holds
quite an extensive block of stock, and ;
there are numerous other small share- j
holders.
President Charles Neal attributes the
closing of the mills to Eastern competi
tion, high wages and a high price for fuel
in San Francisco. It was thought not
long ago that the Scotts would purchase
the place ami add it to their ship-building
plant, but this was not done. They would
not- take it as a gift in its present condi
tion, as it would cost more to fit it up as
a first class rolling-mill than a new place.
Since the building of the Charleston no
work to speak of has been done in the
mills for the Government vessels. All of
the heavy casting for the battle-ship Wis
consin was contracted for by Eastern
parties. The local mills had not even
quoted figures for any of the work.
TO WIND UP TO-MORROW.
The Matinee at the Baldwin for the
Widows' and Orphans' Fund.
The matinee at the Baldwin to-morrow
afternoon will be the grand finale of the
Masonic Widows' and Orphans' entertain
ment, which has been crowned with un
paralleled success during the past week
at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
The programme for the matinee is cer
tainly a most attractive one. It is to be
opened by the California stock company
in "Trilby," supported by Miss Carrie
Roma of the Tivoli. who will sing "Ben
Bolt." Then will come Pllar-Morln. the
gifted pantomimlst, who has recently
charmed the hearts of all theater-goers.
She will be supported by Mile. Severine.
and the music will be conducted in the
tragic "In Old Japan" by Lachaume.
S :beel with his groat orchestra is to be
heard in symphonies and selections. La
ter Robert Mantell will appear with his
entire company in "A Secret Warrant."
After other attractions the "Passion
Play" in its thirty-sixth tableaux Is to bo
produced. It is intended that this shall
end the long bill.
GAVE A CARNIVAL
OF FISTICUFFS
Western Addition Club's Suc
cessful Opening at Frank
lin Hail.
One Rattling Bout and Two De
cided Knockoutsâ A Disap
pointment.
The Western Addition Athletic Club
gave its first entertainment last evening
in Franklin Hall, 1839 Fillmore street.
The officers are deserving of unstinted
praise for the very excellent manner in
which the exhibition was carried out.
Sandwiched in between the several friend
ly boxing bouts, vocal and instrumental
music helped materially to make the oc
casion one of enjoyment.
The hall was comfortably filled at 8
o'clock, when the grand master of cere
monies, R. Snowgrass, introduced the lirst
brace of fistic artists.
Thf> first event on the athletic bill of
fare was a three-round bout between M.
Meyer of the California Swimming Club
and Harry Hitter of Los Angeles. This
was followed by a three-round contest be
tween H. McLaughlin and J. Porter. A
four-round "go" between "Young" Peter
JackSOQ and Jimmy Reilly was quite in
teresting, as Jackson cut out a hot pace.
Jack McDlvitte and Tom Devine caused
much laughter by a clever burlesque
three-round bout.
Frank Shuler and F. McCarthy boxed
cleverly for three rounds.
The next, and what really should have
been the event of the evening, was a
four-round "go" between Gene Mulligan,
the "red-headed" hurricane puncher ot'
the Manhattan Athletic Club, and Jack
King (unattached). King was several
inches taller than his opponent, but never
theless he lailed in the attempt to bring
Mulligan to terms. The stocky little fel
low put up a great fight, and excepting
the first round, which ended In favor of
King, Mulligan had the better of the
argument.
It was cut and slash in the second
round, and both of the men went to
their corners pretty well done up. In th<?
third round, Mulligan, who takes a
special delight in scrapping, went rt
King hammer and tongs, and after some
very hot exchanges he dropped Kin.'?
with a straight right on the jaw. Th<:
receiver, who was hit when leaning
against the ropes, fell forward, his face
striking the floor with effect. He was up,
though, before time was called on him,
only to be sent down again, where he
remained until counted out.
The last and final event of the evening
was to have been an eight-round contest
between Al O'Neil and Fred Trenman,
who was unable to secure a match until
lost night. Sufficient to say that Tren
man proved himself to be a pronounced
"dub," and his successful opponent was
by no means a "ealker," although he dis
posed of the "champion amateur of Mass
achusetts" in the fourth round by putting
him to sleep with a right smash in the
nose.
The entertainment was, however, a
great success and to the credit of the
officers, as follows: President, J. Denis;
vice president. T. Dixon; manager, Wil
liam Laib; treasurer, C. Roach; financial
secretary, Fred Woerner; recording sec
retary, R. Snowgrass; captain, E. Jacobs;
assistant captain, J. Shehan. Jesse
Marks, who was present, enjoyed the
eport ivugely. ,
WILL AID THE
COMING BAZAAR
Lad of St. Patrick's Parish
to Entertain at Odd Fel
lows' Hall.
An Excellent Programme Is : Ar
ranged Which Will Bo Fol
lower! by Dancing.
An entertainment and social will ": be
i given at Odd Fellows' Hall at 8 o'clock
I this evening by the members of the Klon
1 dike booth of the coming bazaar, which
i it to be held next September in aid of St.
I Patrick's Church and parocnial residence
| Since the announcement, some '>; months
i ago, that the clergy of this church, one of
the oldest in the city, were about to ask
: aid through the agency of the bazaar, for
: the first time in' its history, an immediate
j interest was displayed, both by Catholics
' and non-Catholics alike, who have striven
and are striving yet to help attain the
' object in view by realizing an absolute
j success.- â â o.^' : ,'â '
The entertainment this evening, like all
previous attempts of the same character
! that have been undertaken in" the past
i for the purpose of â¢ amusing the people
and at the same time benefiting the
church, promises and undoubtedly will
I be a success. - â¢ â â  . â¢
I Every effort is being made by the young
ladles of the "frigid booth' r to brush
away whatever frost that might dampen
the atmosphere around the vicinity of j
Odd Fellows' Hall : fey substituting a
warmth of enthusiasm that will pervade
the general interior and dispel â¢ all indi
cation or possibility of the advent of an
iceberg. ' ' â -';'
One of the most prominent workers in
the venture is Miss Mary Flaherty, who
has charge of the entertainment, and in
fact is the originator of it. Associated
with her in the arrangement of the pre
liminaries are Miss May Leonard, Miss
May Berritt, Miss Roberta Reid, Miss
Margaret Sullivan and Miss Margaret ,
O'Brien. M . I
The programme as arranged Is as fol- [
lows: Overture, Hungarian orchestra; |
vocal duet. Misses Clara and Stella Shee
han; mandolin and guitar duet, John and
Henry Dresner: contralto solo. Miss Lilian
Cornell, accompanied by Musical In
structor J. Creven; cornet solo, Mr. Cadi
gan; soprano sole, Miss Catherine Mc-
Shean; musical selections, Professor
Moore; basso solo, "Bedouin Love Song,'
Ben Grogens, accompanied by Musical In
structor J. Greven; mandolin and guitar
duet, the Misses Lille and .: Rose Mel
bourne, and a selected song by Mr. Cadi-
Reserved seats should be obtained at
once, as they are selling like the proverb
ial "hot cakes."
Dancing will follow the rendition of the
programme.
DOLLAR GAS IS
A GREAT FAVORITE
The Equitable Company's Of
fices Are Overrun With
Citizens.
They Readily Sign Contract* That
Will Not ExpirÂ© for Five
Years.
There seems to be a great deal of in
terest in this city in thÂ« operations of
the Equitable Gas Company, a new or
ganization, which is taking contracts to
supply the people of San Francisco with
gas for light and fuel for $1 per thousand
cubic feet.
The offices of the new company are in
the Mills building, where they are now
taking contracts to supply residents with
gas at the rate named. The company
agrees to supply the gas at the reduction
for the period of five years, and to supply
it at a cheaper rate if other companies
reduce the cost of gas in this city. The
consumer agrees to use no other gas for
the same period, and to use it for that
period if he resides in the city for that
length of time.
Thousands of contracts have already
been signed, and there is an influx of
people at the offices each day gathering
details of the plans of the company.
Among other things, the prospectus of
the company sets forth the following
facts:
"This company will supply the best and
cheapest light and fuel pas in the world.
It is made by a process owned exclusively
by the Equitable Gas Light Company,
for the city and county of San Francisco.
It has been tested by the best gas experts
in America, in comparison with gases
made by all the large gas companies in
Chicago. New York, Philadelphia, Wash
ington. Baltimore and other cities, and it
has been proven over and over again to
be incomparably the cheapest and best
gas known. The citizens of San Fran
cisco have many times been promised
cheap and good gas, and have in every
instance been disappointed. They know
the influences which have always kept
back and denied this great boon to the
public. This time, however, they will
not be disappointed."
It will be some months before the works
will be complete, hut there is no delay in
the work of gaining consumers' signa
tures. Each day sees a long addition
to the list of names.
A TROTTING CARNIVAL.
Will Take Place on Decoration Day.
A Speed Track Wanted.
The Golden Gate Park Driving: Associa
tion held a meeting last evening at 1200
Market street for the purpose of complet- '
ing arrangements for the grand free trot
ting cannval which it is proposed to give
on Decoration day at the Oakland track.
The proceeds of the privileges sold will
be used in putting the speed track in
Golden Gate Park in proper condition, and
only owners of horses ana amateur driv
ers will be permitted to participate. E.
H. Algeltlnger prosified and F. AW
Thompson acted as secretary.
It was decided to have four or more
trotting and dash races fnr purses of $90.
F. O'Kane and B. H. Aigeltinger were ap
pointed to take charge of the track, and
Cluirles F. Kapp and Secretary Thompson
were appointed a committee on printing.
Fifty horses were entered at the meet-
Ing, and the entry of fifty more was as
sured. Arrangements for special trains
to accommodate the anticipated crowd
were also made, as last year over 10,000
people attended the meeting.
The Journpvmen Barbern.
Although the Journeymen Barbers*
Union has lost a few of Its men by enlist- ;
ment in the army, the membership is not â¢
falling, off by any means. Each T meeting â 
sees at least one new member elected, and :
last night six - took : the obligation. A re- \
lief committee has been appointed to look -I
after ; the families of ; those who enlist. J. [

FLURRY IN
WHEAT CIRCLES
Yesterday's Trading in Local
Market the Largest in
Years.
Higher Liverpool and Paris Quota
tions Fail to Hold
Prices.
Wheat In the local market took a sud
den break of 6 cents yesterday in the face
of higher Liverpool and Paris cables.
The recent rains have tempered the trade
to bearishness. The opportunity seemed
to present itself at the opening, when of
ferings became heavy. Shortly after the
trade began it was apparent that a large
line of long wheat was about to be thrown
overboard. The bears were not slow In
sizing up the situation. As soon as this
particular selling started it was the cue
for severe hammering. December wheat
dropped from 170 to 164. Cutter & Moseley
sold fully 30.000 tons during the day"s trad
ing. The offerings were absorbed by the
shorts, who were anxious to fill their con
tracts. Later in the day new Ufe came
into the market and the price hardened to
166*4- Barley suffered a decline of 5 cents,
caused by liquidation. Heavy receipts of
Oregon barley acts as a depressing in
fluence.
Bresse was the heaviest buyer of wheat
on the break. Kauffman also bought
freely.
Heavy Bill for Medical Services.
Milton V S. Hamilton commenced suit
yesterday against M. E. Graves to re
cover $10,000 for professional services ren
dered by Dr. Beverly MaoMonagle and
Dr. Curtis G. Kenyon to his wife, Mim.
M. E. Graves. The physicians, who were
In attendance from April 5 to April 12,
allege, through Hamilton, who holds their
assigned claJms, that Graves promised to
pay them $10,000 for their services.

DIDN'T FANCY
SUCH RIDING
Thorpe Was Hissed for
His Handling of
Humidity.
Despite the Heavy Going Five
Choices Hit the Wire
First.
Piggott Astride Maroutio Furnished a
Fin* Finishâ ThorpÂ© Riding In
His Old-Time Form.
There was one race decided at Oak
land yesterday that caused a howl of
dissatisfaction, and a number of peo
ple gave vent to their disapproval of
Thorpe's tortuous riding by hissing
the popular rider of the Burns & Wat
erhouse stable. It all occurred over
the result of the third race, a four-and
a-half-furlong scramble for two-year
olds, in which Thorpe had the mount
on Humidity, equal favorite in the bet
ting with Sam Hildreth's fast filly
Toluca. When sent away from the
post Thorpe hustled his mount away
in the lead, and upon reaching, the
stretch apparently wanted all of It to
himself. Near the furlong pole, as
Clawson, on the outside, began riding
Toluca hard, it dawned on Thorpe that
he would take the extreme outside,
too, and Clawson was obliged to pull
up and go around. Humidity won by
over two lengths and the backers of
Hildreth's filly were willing to take
oath that Thorpe intentionally fouled
her. A crowd collected around the
stand and Clawson entered a claim of
foul. The judges wouldn't stand for It,
however, and the whole thing soon be
came a matter of ordinary turf his
tory-
The mud having dried out somewhat
was of the blinding sort, and horses not
possessed of speed enough to pick out
the dry spots soon found themselves
anchored. In the art of navigation,
Thorpe proved a past master, for he
got to the wire first an three separate
occasions, each time astride a favorite.
It was a day for first choices from the
start, for L*is Prietos was the only one
to meet with disaster.
Obsidian, a 1 to 2 chance in the open
ing two-year-old dash, disposed of his
company like breaking sticks. La
Parasseuse headed him into the
stretch, where he took the lead and
won without effort.
Nolan & Tholl's Rebel Jack was
pounded down from twos to even
money favoritism to win th^ six fur
long sprint that followed, and after
getting away none too well Clawson
managed to work his way to the front
and driving hard at the end beat
Master Mariner a head on the wire.
Soscol, weakly ridden by McDonald,
was a fair third.
For the mile and an eighth purse run
Mercutio with Piggott up opened
favorite, but his well-known unruly
antics at the post caused his price to
recede in the ring, and Los Prletos with
his light impost up was played down
from threes to 8 to 5 favoritism. The
latter appeared utterly at sea in the
going and never was a dangerous
factor. Li Hung Chang and Cromwell
looked to have the race between them
until the stretch was reached, where
Piggott went to work on Mercutio, and
by superb riding got to the front the
last few yards, getting the decision by
a head from Cromwell.
The going suited the uncertain under
pinning of old Red Glenn, and going to
the post a 6 to 5 choice for the seven
furlong run McDonald landed him a
handy winner at the wire from For
tuna. El Moro, which opened up
favorite, finished in the show.
The last rare of the day, a six fur
long sprint, went to the 11 to 5 choice
Lucky Star, ridden by Thorpe. The
brown gelding took the front position
in the stretch and led Sport Mc-
Allister out by three lengths.

for the firm of Burns & Waterhouse. The colt
was entered In the race to be sold for J3OO and
was "boosted" $500 over that price by Atkin
& Lottridge, owners of the second horse, La
Parasseuse.
There was another case of bidding up in the
last race. Lucky Star, the winner, was in
to be sold for $300, and when put up to be bid
on was raised $200 by Judge Tarn, the stable
letting the brown gelding go. He looks to bo
a bargain at that price.
From the betting and the way the race was
run it looked as though nearly all of the other
entries were "dead" to Rebel Jack.
At the post Li Hung Chang acted as though
he had taken a "long draw" before he went
into the Starter's hands. Basstnger, though,
managed to keep his seat, clinging like an
over-ripe blackberry to a bush.

COLLEGE MEN
AT BANQUET
Enjoyable Reunion of the Class
of '88 of the University
of California.
Delmonico's Made to Ring With Col
lego Songs and Class
Yells.
Twenty-one members of the class of
'88, University of California, attended the
decennial banquet, given at Delmonico's
last evening, the occasion being the first
big reunion of the class. To James Sut
ton, at present recorder at the univer
sity, is due the credit for the marked suc
cess of the affair, for it was he who orig
inated the idea of a decennial reunion and
carried out the arrangements.
A fine orchestra was stationed in a room
adjoining the banquet hall, playing the
most delightful music during the dinner
and accompanying the men, who became
rollicking boys again, when some familiar
class song was started up.
James P. Booth was toastmaster, the
principal speakers being G. Stoney, H. E.
Monroe, C. W. Reed, H. M. Holbrook and
Finley Cook. Letters and telegrams of re
gret were received from classmates who
were unable to be present, and their
health was drunk, after which they were
given three cheers.
The banquet was entirely informal, one
of the stipulations on the invitations be
ing that dress suits were barred, as the
members planned a good, easy-going time,
which they realized. College songs were
sung, class yells given until the dishes
rattled, and stories told of the good old
days of Berkeley.
To-day those who attended last night's
reunion will be present at the alumni
luncheon at the university and the dinner
in the evening at the California Hotel.
The class of '88 is justly proud of its
record. Of the forty-one graduates only
two have died. Most of the members re
side in this city and are prominent in
business and professional life. Among
those who attended last night's reunion
were- C. F. Allardt, A. Bachman, J. E.
Beard S. Bloom, J. P. Booth, I. I. Brown,
J A Chestnut, Finley Cook. Dr. W. B.
Deas, H. K. Eells, H. M. Holbrook, Rev.
W I Kip Jr., G. A. Merrill, H. E. Mon
roe T S Palmer, C. W. Reed, G. H. Rid
dell', W. E. Ritter, G. Stoney, G. M. Strat

PHELAN FIGURES AS HE
HEFTS.
Expert Cyril Williams Punctures
thÂ« Mayor's Erratic
Criticism.
In attempting to explain the figures
submitted by Cyril Williams, expert of
the Supervisors' Finance Committee,
showing the probable expense of con
ducting the government under the new
charter, Mayor Phelan has drawn ex
tensively on his imagination.
The Mayor consumes just as much
space in his newspaper organ as Mr.
Williams devotes to his estimates, but
his results are so inaccurate that there
Js a grim suspicion among the audit
ing officers of the city government that
he employed for the work a man who
dealt with facts very much as the
Mayor deals with politics.
When asked to reply to the Mayor's
figures Mr. Williams was very much
disinclined to grant the request. He
does not relish a controversy with the
chief magistrate of the city, but in de
fense of his estimates he said that they
had only been reached after a most
exhaustive and careful digest of the
provisions of the charter, and he was
willing to go on record as saying that
they were reliable.
He added that they had been thor
oughly inspected by Clerk Russell Of
the Board of Supervisors, and had
passed his criticisms. They had also
been accepted by Auditor Broderick,
who said that they substantially agreed
with the results produced by his clerks,
who had gone through very much the
same process employed by Mr. Williams
in reaching his conclusions.
"I do not desire," said Mr. Williams,
"to get into any wordy controversy con
cerning these estimates. They were
compiled at the request of Mr. Russell
and Chairman Rottanzi, and were orig
inally made, not for publication, but
for the guidance of our department in
case the charter is adopted. But since
they have been questioned, I think it
is do more than proper for me to givÂ«
you some additional facts tending to
support them.
"Mayor Phelan says that the Chief
of the Fire Department is authority for
saying that under the charter he will
not require an additional appropriation
of more, than $100,000. He thinks this
at or.je disposes of $138,600 of my esti
mated Increased expense. Since the
Mayor said this I have checked off my
figures with Mr. Maxwell, secretary of
the Fire Department, and have found
them, correct. I have computed the
saJarles of the department officials as
they axe stated in the charter; have al
lowed the department a fire boat to
cost $22,980, and have figured the ex
pense of maintaining a fully paid Fire
Department, according to the ideas of
the firemen themselves.
"Under the charter each engine com
pany will cost $12,390 per annum, each
hook-and-ladder company, $14,640, each
â water-tower company $5040, each tire
boat company $22,980 and each chem
ical engine company $5040. The addi
tion of all the expenses of maintaining
a fully paid Fire Department under
the charter, without taking Into ac
count any Increase except that author
ized, produces a total of $612,280. An
additional fireboat brings the total to
$635,260. The appropriations for the
Fire Department for 1897-98 were $396,
000. The increase, therefore, is $239,000.
"Police Department salaries have
been omitted entirely by Mayor Phelan.
After thoroughly revising the figures,
I have made a reduction in the amount
first estimated for the reason that the
law allows sixty-six sergeants and as
many corporals as in the Judgment of
the commission may be advisable. I
estimated on sixty-six corporals, but
Chief Lees informs me that twelve will
be sufficient, and I have made my fig
ures to a.gree with his. The cost of the
park police is in doubt, and I have not
changed them.
"The total expense of maintaining
the Police Department under the char
ter will be $992,380 per annum. The
appropriation for the current fiscal
year was $714,948. The excess author
ized by the new charter is, therefore,
$277,432. The charter provides for re
taining all of the members of the pres
ent police force in good standing.
Chief Lees says that the park police
will come under his jurisdiction,
though it is not clear, but the charter
Intends that they should be controlled
by the Park Commission. The expense
of maintaining them last year was
$18,116. The only change In my figures
therefore, is made by taking off fifty
four corporals.
"The Supervisors are authorized by
the charter to provide for a special
fund to be used in the construction of
a general system drainage and sewer
age. I think it is not unreasonable to
say that $50,000 will be a moderate
amount to allow for this purpose.
"Mayor Phelan says nothing about
annual elections, which will cost at
least $180,000 each year. The Mayor
also scouts my Idea that $60,000 addi
tional will be required to keep the
streets clean under the charter. He says
there is no reason for this estimate
whatever. The City Street Improve
ment Company, the present contractor
for sweeping the streets, gave me the
following figures for the month of
March: Expense of teaming and haul
ing, $4500; salaries of inspectors, $500;
wages of sweepers, if paid for at new
charter rates, $11,650; total, $16,650. The
street sweeping bill for March was $11,
362 48. This shows an increase in one
month of $5287 52. I have, therefore,
estimated the Increase for twelve
months at $60,000.
"Mayor Phelan figures the poll tax
commlsÃions of the Assessor as a credit
of $10,825. This is a State matter and
has nothing to do with municipal af
fairs. Mr. Herzer, Chief Deputy As
sessor, says that Mr. Siebe would de
cline to part with his fees, and I do
not see how the State law regulating:
the collection of poll taxes can be
modified by the charter. The same
may be said of the collateral inheri
tance tax fees.
"My estimate of $100,000 loss on li
censes is also objected to. Mayor Phe
lan says that the loss will be $78,506,
but he omits to include the fees paid
into the special fee fund on 20,234 mer
cantile licenses, which amount to $20,
234, and which bring the loss up to $98,
740, which is my estimate. Ido not es
timate on the court stenographers, be
cause I do not think the charter can
interfere with the Superior Court in
this respect any more than it can in
terfere with the Judges. They are not
municipal employes, but State officials.
I do not calculate on anything coming
in on Sheriff's fees, because the city
will be compelled to employ a keeper
in each attachment suit, and there will
be no profit.
"With regard to the schools, I am
certain that my figures are correct. The
department is now costing in teachers'
salaries $1,081,191 40â adding the officials
paid out of the general fund, whose
salaries amount to $27,400, and the total
salary account of the department Is
$1,108.591 40. The total appropriation
possible under the new charter for the
current fiscal yearâ when the average
attendance of pupils was 33,531 â would
amount to $1,089,757, or less than the
department salaries of the current year.
This amount available for salaries for
the current fiscal year at $28 per pupil
would be $938,868. There is here plain
ly a deficit in salaries of $169,723 40. I
have not considered In this estimate
the salaries of Superintendents of Con
struction and other officials who may
be appointed by the School Board un
der the new charter.
"I think, after a careful revision of
the estimates originally prepared by
me, in view of all the objections that
have been made to them, that I am
bound to reaffirm their accuracy."

FAMILY TROUBLES
OF C. F. JOHNSON
Accuses His Wife's Relatives
of Conspiring Against
Him.
A Suit for $23,000 Filed Against R
K. and J. J. Malcolm and
M. M. Struve.
The troubles of Charles Freeman John
son, his wife and wife's family seem to
be daily on the increase and growing more
and more complicated. About a month
ago he filed a suit for divorce from his
wife on the grounds of cruelty, alleging
that she was partially demented and had
made unkir.cl remarks regarding him. In
the answer she filed a cross-complaint, in
which Mr. Johnson was accused of doing
many things which would not look well in
print. Yesterday, through his attorneys,
Messrs. Beany & Sanderson, he brought
suit for $25,000 against Robert K. and
James J. Malcolm and M. i>i. Struve for
alienating Mb wife's affections. The Mal
colms are Mrs. Johnson's brothers, and
Struve is her brother-in-law. Johnson
claims that while his wife was suffering
from puerpal dementia her relatives dur
ing his absence visited the Johnson house
on Butter street and Induced Mrs. John
son to accompany them to Struve' s ranch
ftear Watsonville. He was not permitted
to see her while she was there, and he
claims that they influenced her to bring
suit for divorce with alimony against him,
in order that he might be compelled to
support the whole Malcolm and Struve
families. They also refused to allow him
to see either of the two children.
He says that his wife has for some time
been partially demented and that her
relatives suggested that she bring the
charges of cruelty against him. It is
said that Mrs. Johnson and the children
are now at the residence of R. K. Mal
colm in this city.
Postal Contracts.
Postmaster Montague was notified yes
terday by the Postmaster General at
Washington that the following contracts
had been let for carrying the mails in
California. The list will be of interest to
persons living in the districts affected by
the new contracts:
Pacific Coast Steamship Company to
carry the mails between San Francisco
and Eureka, a distance of 232 miles, and
back once a week, or as much more fre
quently as the boats may run. The con
tract price is $6000 for the year. The
mails will leave San Francisco every
Wednesday, and the trip to Eureka will
occupy twenty-seven hours. The mail
will leave Eureka every Saturday and
will arrive in San Francisco in twenty
seven hours.

Taber Loses Against Marceau.
That the art of embossing photographs
is not original has been officially declared
in a decision by United States District
Court Judge Morrow. The decision was
handed down yesterday in the case of the
Taber Bas Relief Photographing Com
pany vs. Theodore C. Marceau. This was
a suit in equity for infringement of let
ters patent issued to Freeman A. Taber
for "improvements in methods of produc
ing embossed photographs." Judge Mor
row said that neither of the patentees is
the pioneer of the art of producing photo
graphs in bas relief. The same method
is substantially covered by United States
letters patent issued to William H. Guil
leband of Hoboken, N. J., dated May 31,
1881; also to Mario Russo of Rome, Italy,
1894; and to Savillion Van Cam pen of
Jersey City, N. J.

ages for injuries received on May 24 last,
while crossing Townssend street, near

THE SAINT FRAKCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 1898.
HER LOVE
FOUND A
NEW WAY
How Mrs. Viola B.
Scott Drew Relief
From Missouri.
She 'Wanted a Divorce,
and by Woman's "Wit
Secured More.
Discovered That Her Husband
Had Been Technically
Wedded Before.
HER MARRIAGE ANNULLED
So Once MorÂ», as a Lovely Widow,
She May Essay Hymen's
Perils.
The different marriage laws in the
various States open a way for those
who wish to enter into matrimony or
to get out of it_ It is an old story about
couples going to Nevada to get mar
ried, but quite a new one to the r-urts
of California for one of the parties to
avail him or her self of the laws of
Missouri to get unmarried.
In Judge Belcher's court last Mon
day such a case came up, when Viola
B. Scott begged the court to annul her
marriage with George P. Scott on the
ground that he had a wife living in
Missouri from whom he had never
been divorced.
The testimony showed that Scott
had never been married to the woman
living in Missouri, but that they had
simply lived together as man and wife.
The plaintiff and defendant in this
action, it seems, were married a year
ago last January, and after living to
gether for two weeks ha went to Cen
tral America as representative of a
large firm in this ci\y. Mrs. Scott, or
rather Perry, a.s she and her husband
preferred to b<= called, during her hus
band's absence posed as a widow, and
as such she is known at the present
time to her friends.
She became tired of having a hus
band away off from here and for other
reasons she decided to get a divorce.
After diligently having the laws
searched for due grounds, it was found
that the laws of Missouri would give
her one.
It appeared that some time before
her marriage to her husband he had
been living with a woman back in
Missouri as a husband, introducing her
as his wife, and giving the public gen
erally to understand that they had
been married. In the State in which
they were living a man and woman
doing this are as legally married as
though a ceremony had been per
formed, and if the man marry an
other woman he can be prosecuted for
bigamy.
This afforded Mrs. "Perry" a means
to throw off the bonds that had be
come irksome, and she prayed the
court, on the constitutional grounds
that a law which makes a man and
woman husband and wife in one State
is binding in another, that her mar
riage with the plaintiff be annulled.
The affidavits of several people liv
ing in Kansas City, where the defend
ant had lived, proved that Mr. Scott
introduced a woman as his wife. Clar
ence 1m Partee and C. P. Palmer were
two of the most Important witnesses in
the plaintiff's behalf.
Mr. Scott, or "Perry," is still in Cen
tral America, and offered no defense.
Mrs. "Perry" is residing at 920 Van
Ness avenue. Judge Belcher ordered
the marriage annulled on the ground
on which the plaintiff asked it.
Rumor has it that Mrs. "Perry" Is
now engaged to marry a prominent
lawyer in this city, but when seen Mrs.
"Perry" would not affirm it. She said
that she did not want publicity, as no
one knew that she was the plaintiff in
the strange divorce case. Her friends,
she said, thought that she was a
widow.
BATTLE SURGES TO
OUR VERY DOORS
Fighting Breaks Out in the
Crowd Reading War
Bulletins.
Somebody Terms General Marrltt a
Coward and Straight-way Gets
Thumped.
There was battle yesterday In this
city. It was directly the outgrowth
of the war with Spain. Lest history,
ever prone to overlook details, fall to
make record of the engagement, a
brief account Is here appended. It is
from The Call's special commissioner,
and it is all right, because special com
missioners are invariably selected for
their probity, their love of truth and
their honesty and fairness.
Thus it happened: The wind blew
so hard around the corner of Third and
Market that the spectators lingering
there to scan the bulletin boards got
all mixed up. There were sudden col
lisions, hasty apologies. A man would
stand thoughtfully reading the bulle
tins on the Market-street side when a
zephyr would whirl him to the Third
street side, and he would have to be
satisfied to read something else. Prob
ably also he would come down on the
foot of another spectator who did not
happen just then to be hurtling
through the air. * In this manner ac
quaintances sprang into being and
quickly ripened into familiarity.
Two men were standing on the Third
street side. One was an American and
the other imported. The foreigner de
clared that General Merritt was a cow
ard. "The regulars." he continued,
"are no better than the volunteers.
Merritt wants to back out. He's sim
ply a coward."
The American did not think this
proper language, and explained at
some length why. He did not know
who the other fellow was, and did not
care, but he did not propose to hear
any officer of the army abused. At this
point the American began a series of
rapid maneuvers, at the end of which
observers noted that he had shed his
coat and had signals up for the open
ing of hostilities. But the crowd
rushed In between them. The excited
American waa Induced to resume his
raiment. He did so, but oulyasa tactical
ruse. All the time he was edging near
er to the foe.
"Any man who says an officer of our
army is a coward has to fight," he re
marked. With this he let out his right
and his left. By the time the left was
withdrawn the right was on duty
again. Far from having to fight, the
foreigner did not have a ghost of a
show to fight. All he could do was to
looked pained, and before the honor of
the army had been sufficiently vindi
cated his face was a map of the Manila
affair. A picture of it will probably be
used as such by a loathed contempor
ary, whose special commissioner ar
rived after all the danger was over.
There was in the crowd an elderly
lady whose prejudice against fighting
was so marked that she had hysterics,
when she found that woman's gentle
touch did not cut much figure in bring
ing the dove of peace upon the scene.
Other people were greatly agitated,
this appearing mostly in a celerity of
motion to get somewhere else. A few
tried to stop the affair from being
pulled off, as the technical expression
is, but they got n.owed down like a
Kansas corn field before a cyclone. The
episode demonstrated anew that the
police of this city are out of sight.
The wounded went one way and the
chap with the bruised knuckles the
other. Either will be fit to fight again
in a day or two, and attention is called
to the fact that for a spectacular scrap,
cutting and shooting barred, there is
not a finer corner in San Francisco
than the one utilized yesterday.
The special commissioner, who used
to be a mere reporter, declines to give
the names of the combatants. Such
specific exposures might hurt their
feelings. Besides, he doesn't know the
names himself.
HUNTINGTON ON
HIS METTLE
Lively Proceedings at the Hear
ing of the Robinson
Case.
The Railroad Magnate Squelches the
Attorneys on the Opposite
Side.
Collts P. Huntingdon was evidently on 'he
warpath yesterday afternoon, and thl*
fact served to relieve the doleiul monot
ony of the proceedings at the meeting of
the Railroad Commissioners, who had
gathered to hear the complaint of John
R. Robinson against th" Southern Pacific
Company and numerous other defend
ants.
Just before the meeting was called to
order Huntington made his appearance,
and Robinson, the plaintiff in the case, ac
costed the railway magnate and in urbane
accents said, "I am Mr. Robinson." Hun
tington gazed at him for a moment and
said, "Oh, yes; you wrote me some let
ters the last time I was out here." He
referred to some interesting communica
tions he had received in regard to stop
overs. Robinson replied, "I don't remem
ber having done so." "Oh, yes, you do,"
replied Huntington, "and you are ashamed
to own it." Robinson gracefully retired
and the Incident closed.
Those present felt that Huntingdon had
: his war paint on, and from the steely glit
: ter in his eye an explosion was looked for
at any moment. The old gentleman had
become tired of the eleven days' examina
tion to which he had been subjected, and
it was clear to see that he had reluctant
;ly answered the summons of the Com
, missioners in the Robinson case.
i When the hearing began, E. S. Pllls
; bury appeared for Huntington, while
I Robinson was represented by George \V.
| Monteith, assisted by Horace W. Phil
! brook, the disbarred attorney. J. M. Bas
j sett was there in the capacity of outside
i adviser to the latter. Mr. Pillsbury mani
: tested the plan of defense by objecting to
Huntington being sworn on the ground
that the Railroad Commissioners had no
i jurisdiction in the case. The point was
I taken that Robinson in his complaint did
I not state that he had a personal griev
ance, nor that he had been charged too
much, and that such complaints were the
only ones hearable before the commission.
They could only hear cases where their
orders had been violated, and they
could not inquire into any general com
plaint, like the one of Robinson, on thn
part of everybody. Huntington could bo
kept here for the rest of his natural life,
! he said, by getting up one complaint after
| another and causing him to be subpenaed.
The commission had announced that they
were through with him as a board, and
! Pillsbury argued that it was not right to
I harass him and that his client would de-
I cline to answer on those grounds.
Then it was that another little scene
enlivened matters. Monteith replied that
; It was the right of every citizen to come
! before the board and make complaints, as
it exposed the frauds of the railroads,
and to bring these frauds face to face with
i the railroads. At this Monteith turned
around and looked full at Huntington.
The latter with unruffled countenance
said, "I admit that I am face to face with
a fraud," and Monteith, too, subsided.
La Rue rebuked the attorney and paid
that Mr. Huntingtnn as a witness was en-
I titled to due respect.
The whole rjupstion was settled by the
commission referring the matter to the
Attorney General for advice as to the
jurisdiction of the board, and they will
meet on Thursday at 10 a. m. It is
expected that by that time the opinion
w<" be rendered.
At adjournment Philhrook madÂ© some
suggestion about appearing before the
Attorney General. Bassett interposed
with the remark. "All we want is to pro
ceed according to law," and turning to
Huntington said. "Is that not true. Mr.
Huntington?" The railroad potentate,
flushed with his two previous victories,
replied, "Anything you say cannot be
true; there is no truth in you!" and
grasping his cane with a firm grip he
seemed about to bring It down on the
head of Bassett if the latter made the
least move. The blow, if one was intend
ed, was not struck, and the session closed
without further incident.
Attorneys on the Rack.
There are two persons In the legal pro
fession who are very likely to be pro
hibited from following their chosen call
ing. One has already been placed where
he fs not in a position to practice law for
a few years, lie is J. J. Crouch of Stock
ton, who was convicted of grand larceny
and sentenced to serve a term of three
years in San Quenttn. Proceedings for
his disbarment were begun yesterday in
the Supreme Court. The other case is
that of Edgar B. Haymond. ono of the
attorneys for Albert Hoff, who while the
case of the murderer was in progress in
Superior Judgre Cook's court tried to sell
an alleged confession of his client to a
morning paper for $2000. His case was
brought before the Bar Association and
by that organization taken before the
Supreme Court for the disqualification of
Haymond. The hearing of both cases
was set by the Justices for June 6.

w
BARBERS HATE
A GRIEVANCE
They Object to Eight-
Week Graduates Ply
ing Razors.
Will Appeal to the Legislature
for Needed Pro
tection.
Are Strongly Opposed to Schools fcr
Barber 6 Want at Commission
Appointed.
Barbers who have devoted years to
learning the many difficult phases of
their trade are very much wroth at the
large number of alleged competent ton
sorialists that are being turned out like
grist from a mill by the so-called "bar
ber schools," and are making every ef
fort to do away with them.
With this object in view, over two
hundred knights of the razor and strop
met at 115 Turk street last Monday
night to discuss the situation, and the
best way to meet it. For more than
two hours a heated debate was held and
at its conclusion a vote was taken. It
was the almost unanimous opinion of
those present that the only way to ob
viate the nuisance was to petition the
next Legislature to enact a law similar
to that which is now in operation in
Minnesota and other Eastern States,
compelling those who wish to follow
the business to show themselves com
petent to do so.
During the discussion it was sug
gested that a commission composed of
three competent barbers be appointed
and it wouid be their duty to examine
into the qualifications of every candi
date, and if he proved satisfactory to
them a diploma or license be 'ssued to
him. Any tiler object of such a com
mission would be to visit barber shops
daily and examine into their sanitary
arrangements. The law could be so
worded as to make it compulsory for
the head of each establishment to see
that the brushes, razors and other ar
ticles be treated with a slight solution
of carbolic acid or some other disin
fectant, after the day's work was fin
ished, thus insuring their customers
from contagion.
The most important result to be
achieved by the proposed law would be
the doing away with the so-called "bar
ber schools," thus preventing the city
from being overrun with incompetent
graduates who have spent but eight
weeks in learning the trade. The reg
ular craftsmen say the novices have
proven a detriment to the business in
more ways than one, such as opening
B-cent shaving establishments; working
for cheap wages; keeping open all hours
in the night, and, in fact, doing many
things to lower the dignity of the
trade.
A committee of fifteen was appointed
at the close of the meeting to visit the
different shops throughout the city and
get the signatures of the workers to the
petition, which will be presented to the
Legislature. It was also decided that
the meeting formulate an organization
and meet on the 6th of June for fur
ther consideration of matters of interest
to their business.
An interested participant in Monday
evening's debate appointed himself a
committee of one to visit one of thesa
"colleges" and assure himself that full
fledged barbers could be turned out in
such a short period, knowing that hÂ«
had devoted a year or more to learning
the ins and outs of the business. HÂ«
was greatly surprised to learn that an
apt pupil could learn the business in
less than eight weeks. He was hand
ed a contract by the "professor" in
charge, in which was stated that for
$35 cash the institution guaranteed to
perfect the student In the trade and
would furnish him on graduation with
a complete set of tools, consisting ot
two razors, two strops, comb, hone and
case. With such a splendid induce
ment, many have been attracted and
the college was doing a tremendous,
business. The "professor" further en
lightened him by saying that from 9
o'clock in the morning to 8 o'clock at
night there was a constant stream of
customers who were willing to trust
their faces to the trembling and awk
ward fingers of a beginner, thus af
fording the students ample opportunity
for practical experience. The head of
the school stated that some months he
made money and other times he was a
lnspr. but whon the year came round he
was ahead of the game. Material for
the workers is attracted by a promise
O f f r pe shaving and free haircutting
and thpre is a constant stream of mfn
entering and leaving the school. There
are a few harbor shops in the vicinity,
but their business is hurt by the insti
tution. _______ââ
