NEW YORK, May 19.â A
Washington special to the
Herald says: 1 learn to
night that the Navy De
partment has received
semi - official information
confirmatory of the dis
patches from Madrid an
nouncing the arrival of the
Spanish fleet at Santiago
de Cuba.
The source of this informa
tion is not revealed by the
Navy Department. The state
ment to me was that it was
considered reasonably relia
ble though not official. Al
though unusually skeptical
about the movements of the
Spanish as reported from
Madrid it has been pointed
out that the two last reports
regarding the movements of
the Spanish fleet emanating
from that source have proved
correct.
The announcement of the
Herald that the fleet had ar
rived at Martinique and again
at Curacoa were promptly
confirmed by official dis
patches from Madrid. This
fact, taken in connection with
the semi-official information
received by the Navy De
partment to-night, has caused
the authorities to believe that
the fleet is really at Santiago
de Cuba and the Naval War
Board, 1 am told, is consid
ering strategic movements
based upon this belief.
The San Francisco Call
If the fleet arrived to-day
at Santiago de Cuba no doubt
exists in the minds of naval
experts that it coaled off the
coast of Venezuela from the
colliers sent there by the
Spanish Government.
As the Herald stated some
days ago it was the belief of
some of the naval officers
that Cervera remained at
Curacoa until he learned de
finitely the position of the
colliers. Receiving this in
formation on Sunday he
sailed at 6 o'clock that even
ing for the point where they
lay. Five days have elapsed
since that time. Two days
at least were undoubtedly
spent in coaling^and the re
maining three in cruising.
The distance from the coast
of Venezuela to Santiago de
Cuba is 600 miles and two
days at least must have been
occupied by the enemy's
men-of-war in making the
Cuban port.
The authorities say that the
Spanish made a decidedly
good move and that her
agents have been keeping
Admiral Cervera very well
advised on the position of
Rear Admiral Sampson's
squadron.
Now that the fleet is
safely ensconced in San
tiago it would be an ex

tremely difficult matter to
lock it up in that harbor.
In the first case the armor
clads are at Key West, about
; 800 miles away, and they
cannot reach Santiago under
sixty hours. By that time it
would be possible for Admiral
; Cervera to approach Cien
fuegos and to destroy the
blockading vessels there, pro
viding Captain-General Blan
co warned him of the depar
ture of the American ships in
an easterly direction. If the
Spanish fleet is at Santiago
another point of advantage is
that Admiral Cervera is in
constant communication with
Captain-General Blanco, not
withstanding the American
men-of-war cut the cables
at Cienfuegos. Furthermore
the Spanish fleet is at a base
of supplies, where it can se
cure both coal and provisions
and make any repairs that: its
voyage may have made neces
sary. All that the authorities
have done up to this time
in the matter of operating
against the Spanish fleet ha
been to send scouts to San
tiago de Cuba to watch to
its exit.

KINGSTON. Jamaica, May 19.â The Atlas lino steamship Adula,
"which has arrived uÂ»-re from San tin ro de Cuba, reports that be
tween Jamaica and Cuba she passed seven ships. They were steer-
Ing west In double column. Their nationality Is unknown. Two
American warships were lying off Santiago harbor yesterday after
noon, and drew the flre of the forts. The firing lasted from 12 to 1.
The ships did not reply to the fire of the fortifications, but the regu
lars and volunteers In Santiago were called out, as an attack was
feared.
Captain Walker states that he saw in the harbor of Santiago
twenty torpedoes and he noticed that several blockhouses had been
erected above town. He looked to see If any damage had been done
by American warships to the fortifications at the entrance to the
harbor, but apparently the Americans had not fired on them. The
cruiser Reina Mercedes is anchored close to the harbor, so as to
enfilade. A merchant cruiser of four guns, the Mexico of Barce
lona, is anchored close to the town.
MADRID, May 19.â An official dispatch received here to-day from
Havana says that some American ships fired thirty shots during the
reported recent bombardment of Santiago de Cuba, but that no dam
age was inflicted. The dispatch adds that the batteries at Santiago
de Cuba replied to the fire of the ships and that one of the latter
was damaged.

JUNCTION
FORMED AT
KEY WEST
Rear Admiral Sampson's
Fleet Augmented by
Schley.
It Is Proposed to Clean the
Battle=Ships Before Encoun=
tering the Spaniards.
NEW YORK, May 19 âThe Her
ald's Washington correspondent tel
egraphs: Rear Admiral Sampson,
with a division of the North Atlantic
Squadron under his command, which
attacked San Juan, Porto Rico, has
returned to Key West, where he has
effected a junction with the flying
squadron. This means that he has
under his orders the battle-ships
lowa, Indiana and Massachusetts,
the second-class battle-ship Texas
and the armored cruisers Brooklyn
and New York, which makes him
superior by two armor-clads to the
Spanish fleet.
Rear-Admiral Sampson, I under
stand, has been given authority to em
ploy divers to clean the bottoms of the
men-of-war which were with him be
fore San Juan, Porto Rico, and he
deems ihe opportunity a good one. If
it proves true that the Spanish fleet is
at Santiago de Cuba, he will, doubt
less, defer this action. The hulls of
these vessels are reported to be very
foul, notwithstanding the cleaning by
divers which they sustained three
months ago. Of two-fold importance
is such action. By removing the ma
rine growth from the hulls of his ships
their speed will be increased by one or
two knots at least, which will permit
an improvement in the squadron's
speed. In the second place the amount
of energy that will have to be expended
to drive the ships through the water
will not be so great when tbÂ« barnacles
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
are removed, and coal can therefore ba
saved, resulting in increasing the ves
sels' radii of action.
One official with whom I talked to-*,
day told me the information he had 1
showed that the bottoms of the Span
ish men-of-war were fouler than hai
hitherto been believed.
"I do not think," he said, "that they
can make from eighteen to twenty
knots an hour, notwithstanding that
they made that record on trial. The
Vizcaya and Almirante Oquendo have
not been docked for four months at
least. This we know positively, be
cause the Vizcaya visited New York
about the time the Maine was destroyed,
and the Oquendo followed her not lonsj
afterward. Before leaving for thÂ«L
United States the two ships were at
tached to the home station and later
touched at the Canaries, and this- would2
seem to show that probably five and
even six months have elapsed since they
were cleaned. What is true of the
Vizcaya and Oquendo is also possibly
true of the Infanta Maria Teresa and
Cristobal Colon. All these ships have
been in warm waters during the past
. six month^ We know from experi
ence that ir is absolutely necessary to
clean armorclads every six or nine
months. Consequently. I have no
doubt that the hulls of the Spanish men
of-war are very foul and that their speed
as a consequence has dropped off three
or four knots.
"While it is known that the Naval
War Board has given consideration to
the formation of a flying: squadron, in
fact and name, it can be positively stat
ed that nothing has yet been done look
ing to the formation of such a fleet, and
it is stated that nothing will be done in
this direction unless the Spaniards
should continue to evade the armor
clads."
"The fact is," said an officer, with
whom I talked, "that the board regards
the Spanish armored cruisers as vessels
which only battle-ships or armored
cruisers can meet with safety. The
armored sides of the cruisers and tur
rets are nine inches thick, so that the
six-inch guns of protected cruisers
could not penetrate this armor. None
of the protected cruisers, except the
Minneapolis and Columbia, carries guns
of greater caliber than six inches, so
that we must depend upon our armored
cruisers and battle-ships to do the fight
ing."
TERROR READY TO LEAVE
ST. PIERRE AT ONCE
Bepairs to the Spanish Torpedo-Boat
Destroyer Have Been
Completed.
ST. PIERKE, Martinique. May 19.â The
Spanish torpedo-boat destroyer Terror, at
Fort de France, has completed her re
pairs and is ready to leave at any mo
ment. The Spanish ambulance ship Ali
cante to-day changed her moorings from
the inner to the outer harbor in order to
take on coal.
The British steamer Twickenham, with
2000 tons of coal, has arrived at Fort de
France. It is reported that a contract
has been made with the Spanish Govern
ment under the terms of which the
Twickenham is to furnish coal for a two
months' basis at Fort de France. The
French Government has thus far refused
to allow the Alicante to coal from the
Twickenham, l.ut the Spanish Consul has
obtained permission for a five days' wait
for the Twickenham before declaring at
customs.
The excitement among the Spanish
sympathizers is very great.
TWO BIG SNOWSLIDES
ON VALDES GLACIER
SEATTLE, May 19.â Passengers of the
steamer Morgan City, which arrived here
from Copper River, Alaska, to-day, report
that two large snowslides occurred on
Yaitles Glacier, April 30 and May 1, in
which about one hundred people were
caiiÃht. Only three persons were killed.
They were: Joseph Furner, Chicago; B.
Antwerp, Minneapolis; A. Johnson, Eu

A report was current that four more
were missing, but it could not be con

SAN JOSE, May 19.â Society circles
of Los GatiÂ»s are greatly stirred up
over an elopement that was frustrated
at a late hour last night by a number
of town officials. The parties to the
proposed runaway were W. G. Harri
son and Lillian Sund, the 18-year-old
daughter of Hc-rnian Sund, a prominent
contractor and politician of that place.
Harrison is married and has a wife and
two children. Plans for the flight had
been well arranged. A negro with a
team from this city had been hired to
meet them at an obscure point and
drive them here, where they were to
take the 4:30 train this morning on the
way to Seattle. Justice Beggs and
Constable Reynolds learned of the mat
ter, and when Harrison and Lillian ap
peared at the appointed place to meet
the coachman they were taken into
custody. Both of the lovers carried
large bundles of clothes and were well
prepared for a long trip. Miss Sund
was escorted to her home, and Harri
gon was taken to Jail. He was released
this morning upon his promise to leave
the town forever.

re-elected for a second term. He served
as a Consul at Hang Chow, China, under
Cleveland's first administration. Coming
to Arizona he was appointed Governor of
the Territory early in 18% by President
Cleveland and retired on the qualifying of
the Republican appointee fourteen months
later. He was an able attorney and a
Democrat in politics. â  '

LIVELY CHASE
OF TWO BOATS
Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, May 19.â The cruiser Montgomery had a lively en
gagement Tuesday afternoon with two Spanish gunboats near Nue
vitas on the northern coast of Cuba. The Montgomery was return
ing from Porto Rico under moderate speed, when suddenly rounding
a headland she sighted two gunboats quite a distance out at sea. The
gunboats quickly saw the Montgomery, turned back with all possible
speed and ran for anchor. The Montgomery crowded on steam and
endeavored to cut the gunboats off, but unfamiliarity with the chan
nel caused her to lose time and the Spaniards succeeded in darting un
der the protecting batteries, where the Montgomery did not foliow for
fear of mines or running aground. m
During the chase, which lasted twenty minutes, the Montgomery
fired six shots from her five-inch forward after the fleeing Dons. The
practice was exceptionally good, two shells bursting near the gunboats,
and one carried away the foretopmast of one of the enemy's vessels.
Her rigging came down with a crash and the officers on the Montgom
ery think several Spaniards were injured. The gunboats checked their
speed and fired several shots at their pursuer. All flew wide. This
was the first time the Spanish gunboats were known to venture out of
that locality for several weeks.

Washington, May 19.
Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman
of the California State Republican
Committee, has been here for several
days and incidentally has conferred
with'senator Perkins over the distri
bution of Federal patronage in the
State There are severaf good places
yet to be given out, viz.: United States
District Attorney, Pension Agent at
San Francisco and Shipping Commis
sioner, to say nothing of the brigadier
generalship. .-Â«_..__
It is pretty well understood that the
District Attorney ship lies between
Flank Coombs, who was recommended
by the delegation, and Tirey L. Ford.
The chances naturally favor Coombs,
although Mr. Ford's friends are mak
ing a Btrong fight for him
The pension agency will go to State
Bank Examiner Fuller. Paris Kil
burn will be made Shipping Commis
sioner to succeed Gwln, if this office
can be removed from the civil service.
The friends of Captain deL. Carnng
ton regular army, have begun a move
ment here In his behalf for brigadier
general of volunteers. They under
stand that President McKinley has
signified his intention of promoting
regular army officers to be brigadiers
of volunteer troops in most instances,
and this encourages them to believe
that Carrington may win, although
the President is strongly disposed to
appoint Otis. The fact that Senator
Frye of Maine is making a determined
fight against Otis leads Carrington's
friends to believe that their candidate
may stand a chance for appointment.
The Call correspondent understands
that Frye has sworn vengeance against
Otis for an editorial published in the
Los Angeles Times some time ago de
claring that the Maine .Senator was
under Huntington's control. This was
at the time that the controversy was
over the San Pedro harbor. Senator
Frye said to a friend yesterday: "I
did what I could to defeat the nomina
tion of Colonel Otis for Assistant Sec
retary of War, and he shall not be ap
pointed a brigadier if I have any in
fluence with the President."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 19.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Sena
tors who are opposed to Hawaiian an
nexation are now trying to prevent
annexation by the House of Represen
tatives on Newlands' resolution.
Since that resolution has been re
ported to the House plain intimations
have been conveyed to Chairman Hitt
of the Foreign Affairs Committee
that if the House should pass the reso
lution the enemies of annexation in
the Senate would retaliate by holding
up the war revenue bill indefinitely.
Pettigrew of South Dakota is a Sena
tor who has taken the lead in this
movement.
On the other hand the more earnest
advocates of annexation in the Senate
have intimated that action by the
House on the Newlands resolution
would accelerate the passage of the
war revenue bill. There are apparent
ly dangerous complications between
the annexation resolution and the war
revenue bill, whichever course Is taken
in the House.
Representative Hltt had a confer
ence with Speaker Reed to-day about
getting the resolution up for consider
ation in the House by means of a spe
cial order from the Committee on
Rules. No definite agreement was
reached, but Hitt is confident that a
special order will be reported in the
near future and that the resolution
will speedily pass the House.
There will be a delay in the Senate,
where the opponents of annexation are
determined to talk against time, and
present indications are that the only
way by which the matter can be
brought to a vote there is by holding
the Senate in continual session and
tiring out the opposition Senators.
Honolulu is to be miide a base for
obtaining coal and supplies for naval
and military expeditions to the Phil
ippines, and it has been pointed out
that should one of the troopships be
come disabled on the way to Manila
it might be necessary to land her
troops in Hawaii until arrangements
could be made for carrying them on to
Manila. ________________

THREE HUNDRED
SPANIARDS SLAIN
Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, May 19. â Until to-day no adequate estimate could be
made of the damage done to the Spanish forces at Cienfuegos last
week, when the cables were cut iÂ»nder an attack by Spaniards, and the
Marblehead and Nashville bombarded the forts, lighthouse and forces
on the bench. It now appears that the Spanish loss was at least
300 killed. This information came to Captain McCalla to-day and
is believed to be accurate. The figures made show the fight at Cien
fuegos second only to Manila in blc.odshed.
Of course all the men in the lighthouse were killed, but that was a
mere bagatelle. There was a large force on the beach, consisting of
cavalry, artillery and infantry. They had field pieces. These soldiers
had attacked the boats' crews engaged in cutting the cable when the
Marblehead came up and opened fhe. All the officers ashore unite in
saying that the conduct of the men in cutting the cable was one of
the bravest exploits ever performed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
OTTAWA, Ont., May 19.â 1n the
House of Commons Hon. Mr. deary, a
representative of one of the border con
stituencies, in discussing the American
alien labor law and the manner in
which it had been enforced against
Canadians, incidentally referred to the
Hispano-American War, saying that
the American people would come out
victorious, still there were not a few
who would not like to see the United
States get a "bit of a spanking" be
cause of its unfriendly treatment of
Canada. Cries of "No!" arose from all
parts of the House.
Premier Laurier, arising^ evidently
with some warmth, said: "I sincere
ly hope my honorable friend who has
just taken his seat, in his utterances
which at the moment called forth ex
pressions of dissent, speaks his own
personal feeling and not the feeling of
his party. I would rather hope that
upon the present occasion, though we
are bound to be neutral and must be
neutral In the present differences be
tween the United States and Spain, I
should like to believe that If there Is a
feeling at all apart front our duty as
neutrals. It is a feeling of sympathy
for those who are our neighbors and
who share the continent with us."
Sir Charles Tupper, opposition leader,
expressed entire acquiescence in what
the Premier had said, and concluded
his speech by saying: "While we are
bound to respect that complete neutral
ity that has been proclaimed by the
parent state in reference to the war
between the United States and Spain,
nevertheless, I feel that we cannot for
get that the people of Canada, as of
Great Britain, are but one branch of
the great English-speaking family,
and that the interests of peace, the in
terests of civilization and the interests
of the~world would be promoted by the
most cordial co-operation between the
two great branch nations."
Mr. Charlton, a member from On
tario, then called the Government's at
tention to the presence in Canada of
Senor Polo y Bernabe, late Spanish
Minister at Washington, who seemed to
be actively engaged in attending to an
office of war.
Premier Laurier replied that the
Government had no knowledge that
Bernabe had done anything to warrant
interference by the Government. At
any rate, the attention of the Govern
ment had not been called to the mat
ter. The British Empire had always
been the asylum of refugeen under
any circumstances. So long as the

NEXT GRAND
LODGE FOR
SANTA CRUZ
The Pythian Session
at Santa Rosa.
NO CHANGE IN MEETING TIME.
GRAND OFFICERS ELECTED FOR
THE COMING YEAR.
Governor Budd Gives the Uniform
Bank Permission to Drill
and March Armed nnd
Equipped.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, May 19.â The session
of the Grand Lodge of the Knights of
Pythias of California was called to or
der this morning by Grand Chancellor
W." H. Grant of Woodland, and was a
lively one. A proposition to change the
time for holding the Grand Lodge from
May to December was voted down after
a hot discussion. The special order of
businessâ the place where the next ses
sion will be held â was then called for.
Although several cities were in the race
until last night the fight this morning
had settled down to be a question of,
whether it should be Pasadena or Santa
Cruz. Amid great enthusiasm Santa
Cruz finally secured the honor.
A resolution was introduced instruct
ing representatives to the Supreme
Lodge to use their efforts to secure the
recognition of the Rathbone Sisters at
the next meeting of the Grand Lodge;
also declaring it to be a Pythian of
fense to speak disrespectfully of the
American flag.
It was announced that Governor
Budd would grant the uniform rank
permission to march and drill with
guns, as requested at yesterday's ses
sion.
At the afternoon session the follow
ing officers were elected to serve for the
ensuing year: Supreme representative,
vice Frank McGowan, resigned, C. F.
McGlashan'; trrand chancellor, C. L.
Patton; grand vice chancellor, H. R.
Arndt; grand prelate, W. T. Jeter;
grand master of exchequer, S. G. Lit

Alkire; grand inner guard, T. H. Black
man; grand outside guard, J. H. John
ston; grand trusteesâ G. H. Morrison,
A. Johrdahl and W. H. Esdor.
The session of the Grand Temple of
the Rathbone Sisters was called to or
der this morning by, Mrs. Lydia Mon
roe of Riverside, grand chief. The prin
cipal feature of the day was the elec
tion of officers, which resulted as fol
lows: Grand chief, Mrs. Mary V. Fitz
gerald, Sacramento; grand senior, Mrs.
Ida Merguire, Oakland; grand junior
Mrs. Juliet Stibbens, Riverside; grand
manager, Mrs. Lily Samuels, Oakland;

Details of Bombardment
of San Juan Fully
Set Forth.
Monitors, Particularly the Ter
ror, Did Plucky Work, but
Their Fire Was Not
Very Effective.
KEY WEST, May 19.â An onlooker of
the bombardment of the fortifications
of San Juan de Porto Rico on May 12
by the fleet of Rear Admiral Sampson
gave the following details of that en
gagement. He said:
"The most remarkable feature about
the bombardment was the escape of
the fleet with so few casualties. The
enemy's fire was heavy and continu
ous, and the elevation of their batteries
gave them a tremendous advantage.
How they missed hitting the ships no
one understands. Their shots fell all
around, and their guns had capacity
for twice the range. Yet they only
landed two projectiles with any serious
effect. The San Juan affair strengthens
the opinion that well placed fortifica
tions make a hard task for even the
strongest battle-ships.
"The secondary batteries of the ships
were not used after the line had passed
before the forts. This was chiefly on
account of smoke. Drifting in front of
the turrets, it made the handlers of the
big guns liable to lose all sight of land.
"The admiral and his assistant chief
of staff, Staunton, were on the super
j structure on the lee side of the conning
i tower. They did not go inside the con
1 ning tower, which will probably not be
1 used in action unless the fire is coming
from both sides. So far it has proved a
rather useless institution. On the fore
castle, in the lee of the forward 12-inch
turret, were Lieutenant March, flag
secretary, and Ensign Bennett, flag
lieutenant, both of whom, with Staun
ton, accompanied the admiral from the
New York. Bennett had signal buoys
with him. His signal flags, in the can
vas bags, were made fast with a line
which Van around the turret barbette.
This was to prevent them from being
shot overboard.
"It took about four broadsides to
wake the Spaniards up. In the mean
time great yellowish white clouds were
rising from the hillside, marking where
our shells had fallen. Then a few
puffs of white and little lines of flame
came from nooks in the bluff. The
water spurted a few hundred yards
from the lowa and everybody was glad,
because they knew that the enemy was
TO USE HAWAII
AS MILITARY BASE
CHICAGO, May 19.â A special from Washington says: It Is prob
able that American troops will soon be occupying Hawaii. Presi
dent McKlnley agrees with all callers that the temporary occupation
of the Philippines is out of the question. Whether we desire it or
not we will be compelled to retain the islands for a long time, if not
permanently. More troops than now decided on will have to be sent
to Manila in the course of several months.
This contingency has appealed to the administration with such
force that the advisability of making Hawaii a base for both army
and naval operations has been discussed. It Is not known at what
time the American commander in the Philippines might need addi
tional men The distance between San Francisco and Manila might
endanger American prestige and many lives. To offset this possi
bility it is proposed to send probably 10,000 volunteers to Hawaii,
there to be held in reserve. They could be trained there and from
that point could be sent to Manila twenty days earlier than they
could if kept in the United States. The climate of Hawaii is excel
lent No finer point could be selected for organizing, drilling and
equipping raw recruits and getting them into shape for active field
service.

returning the fire. Before that tht
jackies had been glum. By this time
the smoke began to hang heavily and
the lowa was moist and covered with
saltpeter. Marine glasses had to b<;
wiped every fey minutes. The men's
faces were giimy and their mouths
were bitter from the saltpeter. Wher.
the big guns in the turret were fired
it seemed as if the ship was almost
drawn from the water in a straining
effort to follow the projectiles as they
whizzed shoreward. Behind, the In
diana's port side looked like a huge
fort, her own smoke hiding her star
board side.
"When the lowa was turned to gc
back to the starting point, the entirÂ«
line was engaged. The New York,
stately, standing high out of the watei
and showing all her gracefulness, but
making an easy target, slowly ran the
gauntlet of two miles. While the en
emy's fire was at its hottest, two jack
ies stood at the lowa's bows, withoul
any cover, heaving the lead. They
worked just as calmly as if in New
York harbor. 'They can't hit us,
George,' sang out one of the men ta
another in the lee of the turret. Just
then a shell whizzed by. 'Rig a line
to that thing,' laughed the man In the
chains, pointing derisively to the watei
that spurted fifty yards ahead of him.
"The feature most discussed was the
wonderful pluck of the Terror and hei
escape from being hit. Shells simply
rained about her as she lay within 50*
yards of the forts, and blazed away
with her five-inch rapid-fire batteries.
The Amphitrite's trouble was with her
after turrets, and was caused by an
accident to the gear which supplies the
turret power. Several slight accidents
occurred on the ships, but on the whole
they were not as numerous as generally
happens during heavy target practice.
The strain on the men was rather se
vere. The heat of the sun wa^ intense
before 8 o'clock. The work done by
the engineer officers and their men,
who for three hours were under th*3
battle gratings in the intense heat, can.
not be too highly praised. The firing
of the monitors seemed hardly up to
the mark of the other ships, the heavy
swell causing them trouble and pre
cluding any degree of accuracy of
aim."

news of Mr. Gladstone's death, which
occurred at 5 o'clock this morning,
spread rapidly, it was the tolling of the
Hawarden church bell which carried
the sad tidings to every sorrowing
home in this vicinity. Slowly the de
tails of the last moments of the great
statesman are coming out of the castle,
where the grief is too profound to be
intruded upon. The family was sum
moned at 2 a. m. owing to the sinking
noticed by the medical watchers.
From that time until Mr. Gladstone
peacefully passed away no one left the
death chamber. The only absentee was
little Dorothy Drew, who had tearfully
complained that her grandfather did
not recognize her. Even in that hour
of agony silent thoughts for others
were not wanting. The old coachman,
who had been unable to be present
â¢when the servants bade farewell to the
dying man, was summoned and re
mained to the end with his master.
At 8:20 a, m. Dr. Dobie took his leave
of Mrs. Gladstone and returned to
Chester, deeply affected. Indeed,
every one around the castle was In

"To the Rt. Hon. Herbert Gladstoneâ
I beg to present to all your family my

personal loss and at the same time to rev
erently congratulate you and the English
race everywhere upon the glorious comple

poses. JOHN HAY."
LONDON, May 19.â The deepest man
ifestations of grief are seen through
out the country. Flags are half
masted, the bells are tolling, shades
are drawn down and in the public gal
leries here the pictures of Mr. Glad
stone have been draped with crape. The
Queen and the Prince of Wales received
an early intimation of the sad news
and immediately sent touching expres
sions of condolence to the widow.
Public opinion is profoundly stirred
by the death of Mr. Gladstone. A mem
ber of the Cabinet in the course of a
long interview said:
"It is difficult to find words adequate
to express one's feelings at such an
event. The disappearance of such a
central figure is a tremendous loss. In
Parliament and throughout the country
his influence over our public life was
unparalleled."
Lord George Hamilton said: "What
impressed me most in Mr. Gladstone
was his extraordinary moral influen-efe,
especially in converting the House of
Commons to accept his home rule bill.
Nothing but his personal influence
could have achieved so much in the
face of insuperable difficulties. I doubt
whether there ever was a parliamenta
rian who equaled him in his high stand
ard. His dramatic aptitude and quick
adaptability as an orator made him
equal to any emergency."
Sir Charles Dilke. Radical member
for the Forest of Dean, said: "Mr.
Gladstone's leading personal charac
teristic was old-fashioned courtesy,
while as a statesman it was his abso

incomparable and superior to that of
any of his contemporaries."
Henry Labouj*here, editor of Truth
and Liberal nrember for Northampton,
.<;nd: "What impressed me most was
his power of concentrated effort. Once
he had decided on a course of action
every thought was bent to attain the
end. No duty was too arduous. He
was animated both by his supporters
and opponents, inspiring the former
with his own fierce energy, while if he
could not gain over the latter he
crushed them. It was to this grim de
termination that he owed most of his
success."

SAMPSON NOW ASKS
FOR FURTHER TIME
Desires That the Invasion of Cuba Be De
layed Until the Ships of His Squadron
Can Meet the Spanish Fleet.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, D. C, May 19.
It is stated to-night on high authority that Admiral Sampson has asked the
Secretary of the Navy to postpone the invasion of Cuba for a few days in order
that the fighting squadron may "meet and destroy" the Spanish fleet, and that the
President has consented to allow a reasonable length of time for the continuance of
the search for Cervera's ships. In the meantime preparations for the landing of a
large force of troops will proceed vigorously, and as soon as the American com
mander has carried out his purpose or the Spanish fleet has left the Caribbean Sea
the bombardment of Havana will begin.
The Secretary of the Navy to-night
states that no information has been re
ceived at the department as to the
whereabouts of Admiral Cervera's
squadron. Two conflicting press re
ports locate it at San Juan, Porto Rico,
and somewhere off the coast of Costa
Rica, but both rumors are so vague
that, considering the similarity in sound
of Porto Rico and Costa Rica, they
may have come from the same source.
Admiral Sampson's request for fur
ther time ih which to pursue the Span
ish fleet is believed here to be based
upon an exchange of dispatches between
himself and Commodore Schley, com
manding the flying squadron. Rumors
have been current to-day that the two
fleets have formed a juncture, but there
is no official confirmation of these re
ports. It is probable that both Samp
son and Schley several days ago re
ceived notice from the Navy Depart
ment for a rendezvous for their dispatch
boats at which information and sug
gestions could be exchanged without
the necessity of uniting the two fleets.
The Oregon is now believed to be on
her way from the Barbadoes, where she
touched yesterday, to Key West. At
the latter port she will be ordered to
join Sampson's fleet, together with the
gunboat Marietta and the dynamite
cruiser Nictheroy, or Buffalo, as she
will be called after her formal delivery
to the naval authorities at Key West.
When the fighting squadron, the flying
squadron and the Oregon and her con
sorts are united it is understood that
Admiral Sampson will reorganize thÂ«

fleets with a view of maintaining an ef
fective blockade of the northern coast of
Cuba, and at the same time keeping his
most formidable vessels free to follow
and attack the Spanish fleet. The moni
tors, which are of low speed and fre
quently require to be towed, will be left
with the less powerful cruisers to
blockade Havana, while the battleships
and the swift cruisers will keep up the
hunt for Cervera.
It is reported to-day that Blanco's
last cables have been cut These wires
leave the isiand at Santiago, and it is
said they were grappled for by launches
from American gunboats and cut in such
a manner that it will be impossible to
repair them, long sections having been
removed. The Navy Department has
no confirmation of this report, but be
cause of the instructions given some
days ago to "isolate Blanco" it is very
generally credited.
In view of the desire of the adminis
tration to cut Blanco off from commu
nication with the outside world the ac
tion of the State Department in grant
ing permission to subjects ot European
powers to go to Cuba as passengers on
the German steamer Polaria is the sub
ject of considerable adverse criticism
here. It is understood that among
others Gustavus Bock, a German sub
ject and a leading tobacco merchant,
will be permitted to land. He has lived
in Havana thirty years and has been
specially favored by both Weyler and
Blanco because of his pro-Spanish lean
ings. He has extensive business in
terests which would make it convenient

for him to be in Havana. Four or five
other persons are making strenuous ef
forts to secure permits.
So long as one individual is allowed
to go or the vessel itself is permitted
to go the number who are passengers
or form the crew is not important. In
formation which Blanco and the Span
ish authorities want will be within their
reach, and they will have their own
methods of getting it. As a naval offi
cer said to-day, "It is a waste of lives
to have our brave jackies shot while
trying to cut cables if they art to per
mit persons thoroughly familiar with
the situation in the United States to
visit Blanco."
A decided flurry was caused to-day
by the report coming by way of London
to the effect that the Spanish Govern
ment had secured from France a coal
ing station at St. Pierre, Miquelon,
near Newfoundland. State Department
officials, however, ridiculed the story,
saying first that France was hardly pre
pared to take such a hostile step against
the United States as the transfer of a
coaling station in time of war would be,
and second, that Spain would only be
able to hold it as long as a small Amer
ican fleet would require to sail to
Miquelon to capture it. In well in
formed circles the prospect that any
European power will openly assist is
regarded as exceedingly remote.

nearer to Santiago de Cuba. It appears that Brigadier-General
Mendez, by order of General Calixto Garcia, has brought the insur
gent forces from the extreme east to the neighborhood of Caiman
ero, on the south coast, and Brigadier-General Castilla of the insur
gent army has shifted his command to within twenty-five miles of
Santiago de Cuba.
Small insurgent bands engage in nightly raids past the outlying
garrisoned towns to within about six miles of the city of Santiago de
Cuba. They retire without pursuit after their forays. The con
certed design is to cut off the meat, vegetable and fruit supply of the
city and produce the effects of a siege.
In the meantime the prices of provisions at Santiago are even
less than they were three weeks ago, during the first panic following
the outbreak of hostilities between Spain and the United States, and
the expectation of being blockaded. Small cargoes of flour, grocer
ies and canned goods have been received by schooners from Jamaica
any Hayti, and the markets of Santiago de Cuba are full of fish.
Senor Enrique Capriles, Governor of Santiago de Cuba, in an in
terview printed in La*Bandera Espanola, of May IS, is quoted as say
ing: "Spain has 300,000 regular troops and volunteers in Cuba, and
we fight on our soil. Those of us who are from Spain are acclim
ated and we are entrenched. Therefore, one of us is equal to two in
vaders; yes, to three invaders. We hear America purposes to as
sail us with 100,000 men. Some reports say 150,000 men and raw lev
ies. We Invite four times that number to enrich our fields with
their carcasses. The greater the number the greater the glory. Let
us keep our hearts elevated by patriotism and thoughts of our
wrongs. Our flag has been called the 'golden and bloody flag of
Spain.' In our hands may it indeed win that name."
The feeling against Americans in Santiago de Cuba is most bit
ter. The Spaniards threaten to confiscate the plantations owned by
Americans.

CHICKAMAUG A NATIONAL PARK,
Ga,. May 19.â With to-night's arrival*
the three divisions of the First Provis
ional Volunteer Army Corps will bÂ«
completed. The arrivals to-day block
aded the railroad" yards, but the offi
cials of the various roads have been
working together harmoniously to re
lieve the congestion. Twelve trains of
an average of fifteen cars each stood
on the sidings of one road at noon to
day awaiting a clearing on the main
track to the park, but shortly there
after they began to move. There were
at the park at 6 o'clock to-night 24,000
men.
To-day has been the busiest day at
the park since the volunteers began to
arrive, and the forces of the various
supply departments have been taxed
to the utmost to dispose of the business
promptly and without confusion. The
quartermaster's department has re
ceived all the supplies needed In the
matter of tents, uniforms, ammunition,
food supplies, etc., but no ordnance for
the artillery batteries or guns for tha
unarmed volunteers have been receiv
ed. They are expected, to-morrow.

WAUSAU, Wis., May 19.â The cyclone
which passed across this vicinity last
night and did its most severe damage !
Rt the village of Antigo, in Langslade j
County, took an almost straight course
northeast from one end of the coun
try to the other. That it did not sweep
through the city of Wausau, the heart
of which lay right in its path, is due
to the fact that at Rib Hill, southeast
of the city, it seems to have deflected I
from its course. Passing north and
east of Wausau it struck the farm
house of August Hanke, about a mile
and a hajf from Siegler postoffice,
which was demolished and Mr. and ;
Mrs. Hanke and four children per
ished.
Passing on toward Taegge, the saw
mill of the Curtis & Yale Company
was unroofed and practically demol
ished. The storm center crossed the
river at Granite Heights, seven miles
north of Wausau, and the sawmill of j
David Finn was damaged and his stock i
in pile blown about. From there the j
path of the storm to Antigo lay 1
through uninhabited timber country. At
Antigo it struck the northernmost part
of the village and made a path about
a quarter of a mile wide, where the vil
lage extends for about three-fourths of
a mile. There were thirty houses de- â 
stroyed. The dark, funnel-shaped cloud j
swung along toward the village with i
terrific velocity. It seemed to be com
ing straight toward the business part
of the city, when suddenly it was seen
to veer slightly to the north and the ;
damage was much lessened by the i
slight change of course.
CHICAGO, May 19.â Conductor E. D.
Carroll of the Chicago, Milwaukee and I
St. Paul Railroad, who arrived in this !
city to-day after a run of over 150 miles
through the storm center in lowa and
Illinois yesterday, says:
"The first report received of the death
and disaster caused by this storm fails â 
to give the full account of the havoc
worked. When full reports are re
ceived I believe it will appear that yes
terday's storm was one of the most de
structive on record.
"At Ellwood, a point half-way be
tween Marion and the Mississippi, the
worst havoc was wrought. Several peo
ple were killed and the buildings of
the town were swept from their found
ations. At Delaware Junction I re
ceived news that four persons had been
killed; at Briggs Station report was
brought of many buildings leveled and
two persons killed; at Preston five were
reported dead, and then the train
crossed the Mississippi into Illinois.
"At Savannah news was received of
the killing of four persons at Teades
Grove, the first station east of that
city."

Work of Repairs Will Be Carried On
Day and Night in Order That

ON BOARD THE CRUISER
CHARLESTON, via VALLEJO, May
19.â Owing to a slight accident to her
machinery, which might have been
most serious If it had not been discov
ered just when it was, the cruiser
Charleston was compelled to put back
to Mare Island early this morning for j
repairs which Captain Glass thinks it I
may take a day or possibly forty-eight !
hours to complete.
The cruiser left the navy-yard, bound
for Manila, promptly at 10 o'clock on !
Wednesday morning. She steamed
down the bay under a good head to
Red Rock, opposite the upper end of
Raccoon Straits, when the ship was
swung and her compasses adjusted to
get the angle of deviation caused by
the eteel of the hull. It was a most
interesting process and lasted, as the
navigating officer had figured it would,
during the greater part of the after
noon.
It had been the intention to figure
up the results of the compass adjust
ment during the nightâ and this was
what was doneâ and run out to sea
early this morning, but during the pro
cess of swinging ship it was discovered
that the tubes in the condenser of the
boiler were leaking, and to so great
an extent as to render repairs advisa
ble at the earliest possible moment.
There was not, of course, any danger
to the ship in this condition of affairs,
excepting the remote danger that the
salt water overflowing into the bollers
from the condenser, would make a
scale of salt and eventually wear out
the boiler through disintegration. There
was likewise the condition that salt
water in the boilers would retard the
vessel's progress and cause a greater
coal consumption for the voyage â a
most serious consideration in view of
the supply possible to carry in the
bunkers and the length of the prospec
tive trip. Of course Captain Glass
could have taken his ship to Honolulu,
where the repairs needed could be
made, but they could be made there
neither so effectually nor so expedl
tiously as at Mare Island, which was
?lose by and where all the tools needed j
ror the work were right at hand. More
over, with full steam on it was im
possible to take the caps off the con- j
iensers and ascertain whether one or
a dozen tubes were leaking. If only
3ne were faulty, the one csuld bo
plugged and the cruiser go on her way
with only a few hours' delay. If mort,
than one was at fault, then the defec
tive tubes could be taken out and new
and sound ones substituted. But so
long as the exact extent of the damage
was unknown the captain and the chief
engineer would be working in the dark,
rhe boilers of the Charleston had been
Siven a short trial in the yard before
:he vessel started for sea. Everything
had been found to work satisfac
torily. The condenser tubes wert>
sound and the machinery perfect in all
ts parts. The longer test and highev
3peed of the trip down the bay had
leveloped defects theretofore latent,
rhe condensers were leaking with salt
ivater, and while ail that might come
from one brass tube, worn by age or
lefective in the original casting, on the
Jther hand there might be a sufficient
number of tubes defective, in addition i
:o those plugged at the yard in making !
"epairs, to seriously cripple the cruiser |
it sea, or even to cause a breakdown j
perhaps at a moment when to break (
lown would be fatal. In a vessel go- j
;ng to tempt the fortunes of war, whoss
first mission out of port was believed
to be to act as escort to the fleet of
3hips carrying the California troops to
Manila, It was decided, and wisely, not
to take even a remote chance of a
breakdown.
The Charleston lay all night at the
head of Raccoon Straits, within sight
and almost within hearing of the land,
but It was long after midnight when
the conclusion was finally reached to
go back to Mare Island for repairs.
At half past 4 this morning the ves
sel got under way, and at half past 7
she was once more in the yard and the
work of inspecting her boilers to as- â >
certain the exact nature of the defect j
begun. The work will go on every
hour, night and day, so that the delay I
In reaching Admiral Dewey will be as
brief as possible.
The examination of the condenser of
the Charleston made to-day shows that
the vessel will not be delayed more
than forty-eight hours in getting away
to Manila. It was demonstrated in
one of the condensers examined that
rmly one tube was leaking and this was
the condenser that gave the most trou
ble. This tube will be replaced and
the other condenser opened to-morrow.
The examination has shown that the
blame for the delay in getting the ship j
away was with the contractor who fur
nished the tubes from the East, and
not with the navy-yard officials. The
tubes, all of them new. were furnished
on contract by a Norfolk (Va.) concern
and being made at cheap rates were
also probably made by cheap process.
There was no way to determine their
quality, of course, until they had b^en |
tested, and made as they were, they j
w-pre apt to split even while in transit !
to the coast before they had been used I
at all, and as soon as the ship reached
the yard this morning new tubes were
ordered from the Union Iron Works,
5500 of them, and as the ship's conden
sers only require 2895 altogether, she
will bo outfitted all ri#ht when she
puts to spa again. The spare tubes
will be taken down on the ship.
The story telegraphed to the New
Fork Evening Journal to the effect that
sue of the crew of the Charleston had
tampered with her machinery is ab
surd on its face. The condenser tubes
are five-eighths of one inch in diame
ter and are placed in a vacuum cylin
der. To reach the tubes to tamper
with them it would be necessary for
the alleged tamperer to take out the
low pressure valves of the engine (a
manifest impossibility) removethecon
denser head, a work which required a
large force from the navy-yard nearly
all day. crawl into the vacuum and cut
the tubes; oi*thealleged tampererwould
have to Jump overboard and get him
self pumped up with the salt water
into one of the five-eighth inch tubes,
when he would have to cut the brass
tube from the inside. The yellow
journal, it is clear, can get no sensa
tion out of the sensible precaution ta
ken by Captain Glass to secure thÂ«
most perfect safety of his ship.
Captain Glass himself told me to
night that the Evening Journal state
ment was utterly without foundation.

SANTA ROSA, May 19.â The City of

sweet Queen Grace and her court, and
from now on until the last of the
week dull care and toil have been ban
ished from the city's gates.
Never before has Santa Rosa pre-

sented a scene of such gaiety. The
Btreets are one radiating mass of color,
the red, blue and yellow of the carni
val colors being blended with the deli
cate shades of the floral decorations
and gTeenery on every hand.
To-night the lights from 13,000 Jap
anese lanterns which are strung across
the streets In rows twenty-five feet
apart the entire length of Fourth
street, Hinton and Exchange avenue,
cast their gleams upon a brilliant
scene. The city is thronged with visi
tors, and the glare of electric lights,
augmented by the thousands of lan
terns, has turned night Into day.
Bands parade the streets, and the open
air concert from the courthouse porti
co attracted a vast throng of specta
tors. "No sleep till morn" It Is plainly
to be seen has been adopted as the
motto by the thousands of visitors
within the city gates, and, as the eye
gazes over the brilliant scene the City
of ltoses presents to-night, no one
could for a moment think of doing
otherwise.
Shortly after 8 o'clock to-night the
beautiful ship, "Queen of the Carni
val," the flagship of the fleet that will
In to-morrow's great floral parade be
the gorgeous crowning feature, left its
moorings in what has come to be
known as the "Navy-yard " and
steamed to the home of Queen Grace,
who now holds the destinies of the
city within her tiny grasp.
The Queen and her attendants were
ready and soon had taken their places
on board. The gallant vessel then
steamed direct for Courthouse square,
where, upon a raised dais, erected es
pecially for the occasion, the public
coronation of the Queen took place.
The scene presented was one of un
rivaied beauty. A wealth of floral
treasures had been spent in the deco
rations, myraids of electric lights in
terspersed their rays among the many
hued petals lavished upon every hand,
and the bands discoursed sweet music.
After the l.oral crown had been
placed upon the royal brow Mayor
James S. Sweet presented the sovereign
with the key to the city made of pure
gold. The queen's chamberlain then
announced that by a royal edict from
her Majesty dull care had been ban
ished from the city's limits and Pleas
ure would hereafter hold full sway.
The queen and her royal retinue then
were taken to Ridgeway Hall, where
the grand carnival ball was held.
Queen Grace and her escort occupied
places upon a raised platform at one
side of the auditorium, while those
present all united to do her homage.
To-morrow afternoon the great floral
street pageant will take place. The
most elaborate preparations have been
made to insure the success of every
feature and the display will undoubted
ly excel in beauty and any previous
effort made by the City of Roses in the
arrangements for any floral festival.
The beautiful fleet, consisting of the
"Queen of the Carnival" and the two
monitors "Damon"' and "Pythias" will
be the crowning feature of the parade,
CASTOR! A
For Infants and Children.
Thi tto- fl
though a gTeat array of floats and dis
plays of like nature have been entered.
In the juvenile carnival division of
the parade will be over 125 entries, con
sisting of every conceivable thing of
a movable nature capable of being
decorated with floral treasures. Dog
carts and pony carts will be there
galore, and there is no telling how
many more features of this nature will
be entered before to-morrow noon, as
the entries are still coming in.
In the rose carnival division Walter
Morosco of San Francisco has entered
his famous eight-horse drag:; President
A. W. Foster of San Rafael his beauti
ful team of six Shetland ponies; Mrs.
Thomas Hopper her splendid carriage
and pair, and almost every one in the
city having suitable turnouts will ap
pear in line. The Irene Club has pre
pared an elaborately gotten up float, as
has also the Santa Rosa branch of the
Rathbone Sisters. In fact there is lit
tle use in attempting to enumerate the
many features that will be seen in the
great carnival parade here to-morrow
afternoon.
POLICE INTERFEBED.
Lawler and Maxwell Prevented From
Fighting on Account of Pro
fessionalism.
Sergeant Martin and the police gen
erally -were roundly hooted by about 800
disappointed sports who had attended the
Alpine Club's initial event to see Jimmy
Lawler try to put Mr. Maxwell to sleep
or vice versa.
In a pointed way the sergeant informed
the management at the last moment that
the match could not go on, as both con
testants were professionals. When the
announcement was made it was greeted
with groans of disapproval, but the police
were not disconcerted.
"Kid" Maynard and "Kid" McFadden
were put on as substitutes, and gave a
lively eight-round exhibition, which was
declared a draw. McFadden was the
! aggressor throughout the bout, and many
j thought he deserved a decision.
Arthur Jackson was "put to sleep" by
Young Peter Jackson in the fourth round.

The first of the four sections
of the train bringing the Colorado

at 11:15 a. m. on May 19, and should
arrive ai Oakland at 11 o'clock to

The I"tah contingent left Ogden

As an example of the lack of system
in Washington a few facts which
have recently come to light may be
cited. A few days ago the adjutant
general of the I'niu>d States army
wired to Governor Budd that Califor
nia troops organized under the Stare
law and accepted by the Government
would be entitled to officers under such
law In accordance with this ruling:
the Governor decided to issue commis
to four first lieutenants of in- '
fantry, four second lieutenants of in- j
fantry and two additional lieutenants
of artillery. These were selected to
fill the positions of ordnance and com
missary officers and to provide for trie
First and Seventh Regiments respec
tivi Iy an assistant surgeon. Yester
telegram was received from the
general's office in "Washingr

War Department would make one rul

The order from the War Department
which revokes the former ruling made
to the Governor may not work any
particular hardship bo far as ordnance
and commissary officers are concerned,
but It places Dr. Hancock of Los An
geles, who was appointed assistant
purgeon of the Seventh, and Dr.
O'Brien of San Francisco, assistant
surgeon of the First, in a somewhat
awkward position. Dr. O'Brien re

yesterday by Major White, chief sur
geon of the Manila expedition.
It is suid that General Otis looked
surprised yesterday when he saw the
number of commissioned officers on
the roll of the (California volunteers.
The general should have seen a Cali
fornia r< ster of troops some years ago
when half the force of the National
Guard consisted of staff officers. The
California troops may be officered up
to full limit of any possible military
emergency and perhaps every mother's
shoulder-strapped son expects his
daily tribute of salutes, but it can be
said to their credit that they are ready
to go to the front and take whatever
comes to the men of the command.
They are not like some of the officers
of the regular service, pullingand haul
ing for influence to obtain soft billets at
Washington and New York.
If the story is correct that the Gov
ernment is purchasing mules in Balti
more to outfit the expedition for the
Philippines, then some Washington
quartermaster of the ideal staff corps
is fully aroused to the peril of the sit
uation in the Orient. Of course it cuts
no figure in Washington that good
mules are plentiful in Calfornia and
cosi no more here than they do in Bal
timore. Old-time army officers of the
regular service laughingly say that
some railroad company has got the ear
of the staff corps in Washington, and
spread the story that mules cannot be
found west of the Rocky Mountains.
Yesterday Captain Lockett of the
Fourth Cavalry and Lieutenant Martin
of the Fourteenth Infantry received
telegraphic instructions from Washing
tori to purchase horses. This signifies
that the Fourth Cavalry is slated for
the Manila expedition. Each tro.-t. of
the squadron at the Presidio is being
recruited to a strength of 100 men and
the horses called for are to supply the
recruits. Captain a. H. G. Gale, Fourth
Cavalry, has beer, designated as officer
in charge of recruits.
At State headquarters high praise !s
given to Colonel John R. Berry, Seventh
California United States Volunteer In
fantry. Yesterday he filed in the of
fice of Adjutant-* General Barrett a re
celpt for every article of State prop
erty received by the Government from
the State of California. On this re
celpt of the regimental quartermaster,
duly authenticated by the colonel com-
mandlng the regiment, the State will
be enabled to collect from the general
Government the value of the property
supplied for the emergency. It Is also
highly creditable to the Seventh that
a requisition has been made and duly
approved by the chief quartermaster
for everything that the regiment re
quires for the Manila expedition, or at
least everything that the regiment is
entitTted to under the regulations. The
Seventh is making a splendid record
for observance of military methods and
-will surely be selected for important
work by future brigade and division
commanders.
At a meeting of the officers of the
Seventh last evening the following let
ter was read and acknowledged by a
vote of thanks:
To the Officers and Men of the Seventh
Regiment. California Troop: Ladies from
the Alameda churches wishing to do
something for your comfort have made
you some bags for your pockets, filling
them scantily that they may not be bur
densome, and we have also brought a
little home cookinp, which we trust will
bo found acceptable. More will follow on
Saturday. With many good wishes and
prayers for your safety, believe me,
yours very truly, MRS. J. Q. WARD.

FLAG PRESENTATION.
Chamber of Commerce Gives a
Stand of Colors to the
First Regiment.
The Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco yesterday confided to the First
Regiment of California, United States
Volunteers, the sacred flag of this repub
lic and its fitting mate, the colors of the
State of California. Imposing in the ex
treme were the ceremonies, and of such a
nature as to strike In every heart the
chord of loyalty and patriotism.
The presentation ceremonies took place
about 2 o'clock upon the southern slope
that rises directly in the rear of Colonel
Smith's headquarters, and it was wit
nessed by at least 6000 people. . The flag
was presented by President Hugh Craig
of the Chamber of Commerce and re
ceived by Colonel Smith upon the part of
the regiment. The regiment was drawn
up at the foot of the slope, and half way
un it Chief Trumpeter Julian Aitkln took
his position with the colors encased in
a waterproof covering. On the right in
the formation was the First Battalion,
in the center the Second and on the left
the Third.
Whyii the formation was completed
THE SAIST FBANCISCO CALL, FBIDAY, MAY 20, 1898.
The Nebraska Volunteers Going Into Camp on the Old Bau District Race Track,
President Craig and the following com- â¢
mittee from the Chamber of Commerce
took their position near the colors: A.
: W. Foster. Andrea Sbarboro, C. L. Tay
lor, IJppmann Sachs, Julian Sonntag, H.
H. Sherwood, C. W. Coburn. A. A. Keith.
Heno* Fortmann, Henry Bendel and J.
i Blum. General Dickinson and staff, in
; uniform, worn also in the immediate
party grouped anmrd the colors, as were
many ladies and gentlemen who had
been especially invited to witness the
ceremony.
When the formation of the regiment
had been completed Colonel Smith and
his staff rode up and dismounted, then
the band and Company M, under the com- '
mand of Captain O'Neill, passed in re
view of the regiment and took their posi
tion immediately in front of President
Craig who stepped out from the crowd
and advancing to within a few paces of
Colonel Smith made the speech of pres
entation in words well chosen for the oc
casion. Â .
The colors were then taken from their
covering and their graceful folds tossed
to the gentle wind. As they unfurled the
crowd uncovered their heads, the band
struck up "Sweet Land of Liberty,' and
cheer after cheer arose from the assem
bled crowd. The colors were then handed
into the keeping of Company M, which
received them on behalf of Company is,
the color company of the regiment.
When President Craig had concluded
his remarks. Colonel Smith, in accepting
the stand of regimental colors, pledged
on the part of the regiment Its faith and
loyalty to the flag that had been confided
to its keeping, and he promised that lta
proud folds should never be sullied, and
the hand of the tyrant should never pol
lute its purity as long as there was left
a man to strike in its behalf. He ex
preflS<-,sp <-,5 reflS with deep emotion the cratlnca
tlon of the regiment at the kindly action
of the Chamber of Commerce in present
ing it with the colors, and upon the oath
of"a # soldler and a gentleman he promised
that the flag should ever be foremost in
the defense of our country and that its
brilliant mars and graceful folds should
never be furled until the oppressor's heel
had yielded to the sweet ministrations of
liberty and peace.
At the conclusion of these ceremonies.
In honor of G^noral Dickinson and his
Bluff. Colonel Smith had the regiment
p.'iFS In full review of the general. The
band played the national airs. tho nol
dlern swung off with lively iitep, the
crowd broke over the field, and one of the
Biosi impressive and stirring ceremonies
that have ever taken place upon the
801 lof California wuh over.

and Btaff and the band of twenty-three I
pieces. They, too, were taken In hand j
by the ladies of the Red Cross, and after I
they had eaten their fill and had given I
three cheers for their hostesses, line was j
formed, and, escorted by Lieutenant Car
sun of the Fourth Cavalry, and the Mer
chants' band, the column proceeded up
Market street to Golden Gate avenue and
out that boulevard to the camp ground, !
which was reached shortly before 5 j
o'clock.
lieutenant Neall, Fourth United States
Cavalry, had been as busy as a whole
hive of bees all day preparing for their
coming, and the battalion found an
abundance of wood and straw for bedding
waiting. Pipes had also been laid and
water turned on, so that all the troops
had to do was to pitch their tents and
make themselves as comfortable as pos
sible.
Colonel Bratt did not accompany the
battalion to camp. He went direct to
army headquarters and reported to Gen
eral Merriam, and having received word
that the First Battalion would not reach
Oakland Mole until after 6 o'clock, he ar
ranged to have it remain aboard the
train until morning.
There was some misunderstanding In
regard to this, for when Lieutenant-
Colonel Colton and his command reached
Oakland he was notified to proceed at
once to the camp. In consequence, the
First Battalion came across the bay, land
ing at the ferry at 6:15 p. m. They, too,
were bountifully provided for by the Red
Cross Society before beginning the march
out beyond Lone Mountain.
The second battalion brought two oddi
ties in the way of mascots. One Is a mag
nificent golden eagle, presented to tiie
regiment by Hon. William J. Bryan before
it left Lincoln. The bird is confined in a
big wire cage. The other pet is a baby
wolf, which one of the men carried in hi 3
arms. The little thing is as tame and
playful as a kitten, but is only contented
when one of the boys in blue is holding
him. Both of these will be taken to Man
ila with the regiment.

THE LATEST EXAMINER SWINDLE.
THERE was told in the local columns yesterday
the story of a gross and shameful swindle per
petrated by the Examiner. Facts were set forth,
backed by. indisputable evidence, showing that
Hearst's paper goes by thousands daily fresh from the
press to the crematory, there to be burned. These
papers can be meant to accomplish only one object,
that of deluding the public and blinding an absent
proprietor. Fittingly enough, the papers go in a gar
bage wagon and are consumed amid other rubbish
and offal.
In a prominent place each morning the Examiner
states that more than 90,000 copies are distributed
every day. People reading this are supposed to be
lieve that the distribution is to subscribers or by the
method of street sales. That a large part of the copies
simply serve the purpose of being sworn to has been
kept a secret from them. But while the Examiner
is boasting, why this modest figure? The capacity of
the crematory has by no means been reached. Even
with its present facilities it could easily reduce to
ashes and oblivion 200,000 copies, and without inter
fering with its regular business. It charges only 20
cents per cubic yard, this including cartage and in
violate secrecy. So why does not the Examiner take
a giant stride such as will paralyze beholders? A big
lie stoutly sworn to is more impressive than a little
one; not that the lie as now blazoned on the front
page of the Examiner is really small. It is merely
smaller than might have been expected to appear
there.
In this there is involved more than a mere matter
of commerce. There is a question of morals, of honor
and of decency. True, these are traits and qualities
the Examiner neither possesses nor holds in regard,
but the community has certain rights. Among these
rights is that of protection against rogues. There
could be no objection to the burning of the Examiner
in itself. Indeed, were each entire issue to be given
to the flames the city would be distinctly the
gainer. The Examiner is welcome to cremation,
but when it tries to make people think the
papers burned are circulated in the manner of legiti
mate papers, that they go through the mails or di
rectly to readers, it is guilty of a meaner confidence
game than ever played by a bunko sharp.
These truths are not mentioned with hope or with
desire to reform the swindler. It is apparently jail
proof. There is in it no sound spot on which re
pentance could be grounded. But there is a reason
able hope of warning the public. When it realizes the
extent and deliberatene?s of the way in which it has
been cheated, it can take its own revenge. ,
0 LITTLE MORE NOISE, PLEASE.
WHEN soldier boys, already far from their
homes, come tramping up Market street it is
fitting that they should pass between lines of
cheering citizens. A common impulse stirs the pa
triotism of the country. Let the boys know that they
are welcomed and honored.
Yet, although San Francisco does not make much
noise, the people living here are as heartily in accord
â with the nation as any other part of it. They haVe ob
served with regret, and almost with indignation, that
some of the recruits were poorly provided with ne
cessities, and these they have hastened to supply.
The women of the Red Cross are working nobly.
They toil for the men in the ranks as though for
brothers and sons. They have appealed for financial
aid and the money pours in. They wanted volunteers
for hospital duty, and from every side come trained
nurses eager to serve.
These women have not overlooked details. As the
6tranger? arrive coffee and substantial fare awaits
at the ferry. If the Government blankets are tied up
with red tape these ladies send blankets purchased by
themselves. They have shod the feet of scores, sent
delicacies to the sick, thought out schemes for send
ing comforts to Manila.
Yesterday these women watched the Nebraska boys
go by and waved a salute, at once a hail and a fare
well. And some of them wept because out in the
street there was hardly a sign of hurrahing from the
hundreds of spectators. Then next time let the peo
ple shout. The soldiers will appreciate it. and the
soldiers' Red Cross friends will be grateful.
In making mention of its circulation the Examiner
has a habit of jubilantly setting forth its April record
and asking "What will it be in May?" There is no
way to find out. Perhaps the books of the crematory
would throw light Â«on the subject.
Possibly the Examiner can make the plea that it
contributes numerous copies of itself daily to the
crematory furnace for the purpose of patronizing
home industry.
Let none marvel hereafter at the fumes of the gar
bage crematory. The smell of yellow journalism could
hardly be expected to vie with the sun-kissed violet.
CHARTER ARGUMENTS.
' I 'HE final answer of the morning organ of the
proposed new charter to the estimates sub
* mitted by Auditor Broderick and .Expert Wil
liams of the Supervisors' Finance Committee of the
probable cost of conducting the government under
the instrument is exceedingly characteristic. The
organ declares that Sam Rainey, the Democratic
boss, has directed Broderick to compile his figures
for the purpose of deceiving the public. It attributes
the activity of Mr. Williams to the desire of the
"shifty eight" to prevent the adoption of the charter.
"What," shrilly exclaims the organ, "do the voters
of the city think of this sort of opposition? Are they
satisfied to have the city government run by cheap
boodlers of the type of the Devanys, the Haskinses,
the Sheehans, the Delanys, the Mortons, the Britts,
the Smiths and the Riverses? Has the rule of these
men been so wise and just that the people care to ac
cept their views in deciding upon the city government
for the future?"
This is a highly intellectual argument, and we con
fess our inability to meet it. If the estimates of
Broderick and Williams were inspired by Sam Rainey
and the "shifty eight" they must necessarily be in
correct. We can conceive of no contingency under
which Sam Rainey could add two and two together
so as to make four. We have no idea that the
"shifty eight" could compute the salaries authorized
by the new charter and reach an accurate result. It
is said that figures do not lie, but we have a notion
that mathematics is not a science in the hands of
municipal officials who are opposed to the new
charter.
Really the organ overreaches itself in its charter de
fense. It assumes that the public is as muddle-headed
as itself, and in putting forth the flap-doodle- we have
quoted it insults the intelligence of 300,000 people.
The discussion of the charter and the determination
of the question whether or not it shall be accepted
ought to be a matter of intellectual fencing. We all
desire the adoption of a good charter. The present
generation is no more interested in the pending in
strument than generations to come. If the proposed
charter is likely to be a failure it is to the interest of
everybody to defeat it.
When the organ descends to the level of ward poli
tics in discussing this important subject, in our judg
ment it damages its cause â at least in the minds of
all thoughtful men.
WANAMAKER'S CAMPAIGN.
WANAMAKER'S campaign against Senator
Quay in Pennsylvania is attracting more at
tention in the East than any other proceeding
of the time with the exception of the war. Nor is
this surprising. Mr. Wanamaker has put forward
such a series of grave charges against the Senator
that even citizens who are most indifferent to faction
fights within party lines are compelled to give them
consideration.
It is to be regretted that charges so boldly advanced
are not made of a nature so specific and so definite
that a direct issue would be raised between the con
tending parties. Mr. Wanamaker has served the na
tion in high office with conspicuous ability, and no
one likes to regard him as a reckless and abusive
orator, careless of what he says so long as he injures
his opponent, and yet from the indefinite way in
which his attacks are made a good many will be led
to think him so.
An example of his method is to be found in a letter
read by him in a recent speech to prove that Quay
snd his friends in office are in the habit of selling
postmasterships for the purpose of raising campaign
funds. The letter, which has been widely published
and extensively commented on. runs as follows:
April 23, 1898.
Dear Sir: I have filed my application with the
Postmaster-General for the postofflce at T , but
it is said that our Congressman Is holding it for
$3000. Now, I do not think it right to buy the office,
and have not the money to do so, and write asking
for your aid in the matter. Can you give me any
or suggest any course that will help me in securing
it? If you can I will be greatly obliged. Yours, etc.
The charge in this letter is one of the most serious
that can be made against a public man, and yet there
is nothing definite about it. The name of the writer
is not given, the name of the Congressman is sup
pressed, and even the name of the city where the
postoffice is located is concealed under the initial T.
No one could answer an accusation of that kind, for
no one knows who has been accused.
If Mr. Wanamaker has evidence sufficient to con
vict any Congressman of demanding $3000 for a post
office appointment he owes it to the country to bring
the guilty person to justice. If he has no such evi
dence he should not make the charge. Campaign
ing of that kind may attract attention, but it is more
likely to injure the orator than Senator Quay.
Some weeks have elapsed since Lieutenant Burke
was murdered and the policemen who were with him
went running over the hills like a lot of scared sheep.
The public has not altogether forgotten the tragedy,
and has been denied the opportunity to congratulate
itself over the dismissal of the runaways. Does Chief
Lees like a coward?
There can be no excuse for the policeman who ar
rests on the supposition that she is one of the prowl
ing thieves of the tenderloin a lady whom he person
ally knows to be respectable, warrant or no warrant.
The time seems to have arrived for the Police Com
mission to weed the ranks of paretics.
The statement is made that the captain of the men
who landed from the Gussie witnessed the fight from
on board. There is such a thing as being valiant by
proxy and discreet in person. However, there is no
excuse for condemning the captain on the strength of
a correspondent's rumor.
As the plumbing inspector has reported that the
plumbing of the ferry depot is a violation of eleven
rules of the Board of Health, it is fair to assume that
the Board of Health has just eleven rules which apply
to plumbing.
The same dispatch which declares Bismarck does
not like the idea of an Anglo-American alliance states
that the Prince is suffering anew from rheumatic
pangs. There is, possibly, more than a mere co
incidence in this.
Blanco sends word from Havana that plenty of food
is coming in. Blanco may not be much of a soldier,
but what splendid material for a "special commis
sioner" of yellow journalism!
An evening paper has seen fit to attack the integ
rity of the Charleston. Of course the facts to justify
the attack are lacking, but enterprise is not to be
balked by trifles.
Perhaps the Charleston is overloaded. It must be
remembered that she has on board one of those pe
culiar impertinences known as a "special commis
sioner."
Any old thing could get a cirqulation by means of
an understanding with the crematory.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAT, MAT 20, 1898.
THE PARTITION OF CHINf*.
WHILE the partition of China was never dis
cussed by statesmen as a proposition of prac
tical politics until the war with Japan exposed
the weakness of the old giant empire, as a matter of
fact the partition has been going on by degrees ever
since the development of steam power in ocean navi
gation brought the aggressive nations of Europe into
close communication with the Orient. China has
been shorn of many of her provinces, and partition
is already well advanced.
The situation is much better understood in the
Orient than here. To the foreign residents of Chinese
ports the partition of the empire is not so much a
policy to be possibly undertaken in the future as a
process under way at the present time. The Shang
hai Press recently pointed out that since 1858 the
territory lost by China comprises the Amoor region,
288,830 square miles; French Indo-China, 140,630
square miles; Saghalien Island, 24,540 square miles,
and Formosa, 14,978 square miles. The last named
island was taken by Japan. All the rest of the lost
territory has passed into the hands of European
powers.
In addition to these wide regions of territory now
clearly lost, China has virtually surrendered control
over Korea and Manchuria. Thus it will be seen that
Great Britain, France and Russia seized a consider
able part of the Chinese empire before they began dis
cussing the advisability of dividing it. Each has taken
care to have a good share of the spoils before ad
mitting that any spoliation was to be made. The
partition of China has, in fact, been going on at a
rapid rate for years, and yet European diplomatists
have sufficient composure of countenance to be able
to discuss the subject as if it were a new proposition
never before heard of.
It is the consciousness of the extent to which China
has been plundered in the past that makes the various
nations watch each other with such jealousy and sus
picion now. They know that what was so easily
done in the past can be as easily repeated. More
over, Germany has entered the field as a rival spoli
ator to the other powers, and the new competitor is
not likely to be content with a small share of the
spoils.
In a recent speech Lord Salisbury informed Parlia
ment that Great Britain had taken Wei Hai Wei to
"encourage Chinese reform and to show Japan and
Korea our naval power." The phrase is a good one,
but the encouragement of reform and the display of
naval force might have been accomplished without
seizing a Chinese port directly opposite the port
taken by the Russians. There is a suspicion that
Salisbury desired to make a show of power for the
warning of other people than those of Korea and
Japan.
Even after the extensive spoliation of territory to
which the empire has been subjected, there remain?
to China a territory larger than that of the United
States. It is known to have coal fields more than
twenty-five times as extensive as those of Great
Britain, and is rich in gold, silver, lead, tin and iron.
It contains upward of 300,000,000 industrious people
and is the largest single market in the world. The
temptations to greed are therefore immense, and if
the United States expects to share in the Chinese
trade for the development of the commerce of her
Pacific Coast she will have to keep a close watch on
what is being done there from this time forth.
EUROPE AND THE WAR.
I I OWEVER averse we may be toward any inter
! I ference on the part of European nations in our
* * war with Spain, we cannot overlook the fact
that most of them have strong inducements to inter
| vene. The war has raised the price of wheat, and
that in turn has caused such distress among the
poorer classes of the people of Europe that already
bread riots have occurred in Italy and are threatened
elsewhere.
We have been so much occupied in this country
with the progress of our armies and navies that we
have given but little attention to the economic situa
tion on the other side of the Atlantic. The riots in
Milan and other cities of Northern Italy have been
passed over as if they were ordinary street disturb
ances, whereas they were in fact of such magnitude
and so portentous as--to amount almost to the de
gree of a civil war. Indeed, they appear to have re
sulted in a greater loss of life than has been caused
by the war with Spain up to this time.
Every European statesman is aware of the danger
that comes when a dissatisfied populace are rendered
desperate by a lack of work or by such a rise in the
price of food as to make wages inadequate to the
needs of families. All of them are therefore eager
to take whatever action promises to break the dead
lock in wheat and restore, if not prosperity, at least
endurable conditions among their people. A cessa
tion of the war with Spain would undoubtedly have
a tendency in that direction, and accordingly all of
them would gladly do almost anything to hasten the
return of peace.
In this condition of affairs their animosity may be
directed toward the United States, but most of them
have sagacity enough to see that they could not
"bring the war to a close by siding against us. The
much talked of intervention, then, if it come at all, is
not likely to take a form that would be resented by
our Government. It is more likely to be a pressure
applied to Spain to induce her to recognize the in
evitable and seek for peace at once on whatever terms
we choose to grant. In that direction lies a fair pros
pect of attaining a speedy peace, whereas an attack
upon us would simply precipitate the much talked of
Anglo-Saxon alliance and involve the world in a
war whose end no man could foresee.
Financial experts have noted in the course of the
European money markets many signs inclining to
the belief that the great dealers in national securities
are assured that peace will not be long delayed. One
of these signs was discerned in the rise of Spanish
securities after the heavy slump that followed the
declaration of war. Spain has won no victories and
nothing has occurred to justify an expectation that
she will manage to win any or to hold her colonies.
The only cause for giving a better price for her se
curities must therefore have been some information
that the prospect of peace is better than is generally
supposed. Thus while so many rabid Europeans are
shouting their antagonism to the United States no
one is likely to help Spain. Her most interested
friends are those who are most eager to see her drop
her arms and end the war.
Announcement is made that the administration has
declared in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the
war. This is one of the announcements which might
as well be kept standing. It pleases everybody, and
telegraphic tolls for its daily transmission from Wash
ington represent a waste.
People will be glad to know that the Americans
captured in Cuba^re to be exchanged. For once
Spain seems to have been generous. It is to be an
even trade, although the two are easily worth a dozen
of the sort of Spanish prisoners held in this country.

mortuary verselets that have been pub

"This man was a unique figure in our
locality in the fact that he had a won
drous faculty for acquiring land. He
would either buy it outright or become
the owner by foreclosed mortgages, and
the old fellow, Sam Johnson was his
name, if I remember correctly, had ac
quired Immense land interests in the sur
rounding districts, so much so that it be
came a byword among our citizens that
Johnson wanted the earth. He lived a
hermit's life, and one morning he was
found dend In bed.
"Now the epitaph which I claim should
take rank with other more pretentious ef
forts in that regard reads as follows, and
it will be remarked that there la more
truth than poetry in the lines:
" 'To Sam Johnson.

And he went about with determination

He was disappointed cruelly, his tone has

ARMY AND NAVY BANKING.
The correspondence In ranks in the
United* States navy and army and the
salaries attached are concisely set forth
in the following:
(Vice-Admiral .... $9.00n eral $11,000
jiear-Admiral 6. CM :n Major-Oeneral ... 7,500

There is a decrease of $200 to $1000 a year
in the shore pay of naval officers, and a
still further decrease when they are on
waiting orders. In the army mounted
officers receive a little more than those
who are not mounted. The table shows
that all the naval ranks below commo
dore receive a larger compensation than
the corresponding ranks in the army. In
the cases of naval captains and com
manders It is ea.sy fo perceive the reason
for this. Captains and commanders are
command ranks, and the officers in these
grades are usually placed in positions of
the gravest responsibility as commanding
officers of ships. Furthermore, they are
compelled to do a considerable amount of
entertaining, which puts them to much
expense. Again, naval officers when
afloat are obliged to maintain sep
arate establishments for their families.
CAVALRY SONG.
Our good steed sniffs the evening air.
Our pulses with their purpose tingle;
The foeman's fires are twinkling there;
He leaps to hear our sabers jingle;
Halt!
Each carbine sends its whizzing ball;
Now, cling! clang! forward all,
Into the fight!
Dash on beneath the smoking dome;
Through level lightnings gallop nearer!
One look to heaven! No thought of home;
The guidons that we bear are dearer.
Charge!
Cling! clang! forward all,* .
Heaven help those whose horses fall!
Cut left and right
They flee before our fierce attack!
They fall! they spread in broken surges!
Now, comrades, bear our wounded back,
And leave the foeman to his dirges.
Wheel!
The bugles sound the swift recall;
Cling! clang! backward all!
Home, and good night!

A temporary State organization was
perfected by thf> Red Cross Society in tho
ra of the Occidental Hotel yester
day. Eighteen delegates from near-by
cities* attended The conference, and for
ver an hour matters of interest were de
b.;r.>d. and a council of nine was ap
pointed to look after the destinies of the
organization. The appointees were: F. B.
Ginn. Oakland; Miss Hook. Martinez;
Mrs. O Neil. Alameda; Charles A. Noble,
Berkeley; Mrs. Angellotf, San Rafael;
Mrs. Smedberg, San Francisco; Mrs. Grif
l les; Mrs. Baker and Mrs.
\V. B. Hamilt n of San Francisco.
As president of the local society Mrs.
Harrington called the meeting to order,
and in a few concise sentences outlined
the objects of the organization.
Mrs. F. G. Lemon of Oakland, who has
been an associate with Clara Barton in
Red Cross work, explained the workings
of the national society.
Professor Bacon of Berkeley followed
and stated the requirements for gaining
Government recognition. He was followed
by Mrs. Abbott, who told of the Dans
ville (N. V.) Red Cross Society's methods
in getting the Government to recognize its
work.
Rabbi Voorsanger then explained the
necessity of meeting the emergencies that
now confront the local society. He sug
gested that the executive committee com
municate with the medical authorities of
the army and proceed to fill the wants
called for by their requisitions. He con
cluded by saying that a financial agent
and a small expedition of trained nurses
and srpplies would accompany the
troops and advocated the advantage of
this city as the headquarters of the State
organization, as this city was the supply
point.
Mrs. Abbott suggested that a president,
secretary and treasurer be selected and a
State society be formed at once. Profes
sor Bacon moved that this should be done
and that a provisional council be ap
pointed to ascertain what was necessary
to make the organization permanent.
The motion was carried and the nine dele
gates were appointed.
Mrs. W. B. Harrington, the present head
of th^ local society, was on motion made
temporary president of the State society,
while Dr. G. F. Hanson was appointed
secretary and William Alvord of the Bank
of California treasurer.
Before adjourning the following tele
gTams were read by Professor Bacon, who
etated they had been received by Mrs.
Greenleaf, who is the head of the Ber
keley branch of the Red Cross. They
were from her husband who is chief sur
geon on Miles' staff: ;

This was followed by a second message
which read:

Dr. Voorsanger said that if it could be
done the whole State would have to as
sist, as ships were expensive luxuries.

Macble Cutters Will Make a Fight to
Keep Work at Home.
At the last meeting of the Marble-Cut
ters' and Finishers' Union the following
resolutions, presented by John E. McDou
gald, v.< iv unanimously adopted:
Whereas. During the last few years a num
ber of the largest contracts for marble work in
the city of San Francisco nave been let to East
ern linns; and whereas, such firms do all or
the work Upon the marble in the Eastern work
shops, with scab and prison labor; and where
as, we have-been credibly informed by marble
dealers and manufacturers of the city of San
Francisco that If the competition with the
Eastern firms is to continue, the local dealers
and manufacturers must either reduce wages 50
per cent or go out of business; and whereas,
such reduction of waves would mean great
hardships to SOT marble workers of the city of
San Francisco, and the closing of business
-would bring destitution and starvation to 214
families' doors, and 628 children would be
thrown upon the charity of the citizens of the
city: and whereas, the Marble Cutters and
Finishers of the city of Ban Francisco deem it
an outrage to the owners of property who are
making improvements by building, and the va
rious trustees of public buildings, to allow the
awarding of contracts for marble work to go
from this city to Eastern Arms where they only
employ convicts and the cheapest kind of labor,
when the work can be executed as well, if not
better, in this city and with union labor. The
money lor this .y.ik should be spent in this
city, and especially during these trying times,
when so many good mechanics are out of em
ployment and find It hard to support themselves
and their families. We know, and are positive,
that we have artists at home competent to do
any work in an artistic manner, and, ; more
over, who do the work in this city, thereby put
ting the money In circulation here. We want
all to patronize home Industries for mutual
benefits; therefore, be It
Resolved. That none of the branches of the
building trades of this city of San Francisco
will allow any of its members to perform any
work upon any building In which the marble
is to be furnished by Eastern firms, which do
not make the same from rough stock In this
city; and be it further
Resolved. That the secretary of Marble Cut
ters' and Finishers' Union is Instructed to re
quest that all Eastern labor and trades unions
shall, as far as they may be able, prevent
marble setters from coming- to this city to set
marble in any of the above cases; and be it
fl..f 1 ..- .her
la-solved. That a committee wait upon the
owners of buildings and the architects of the
city of Ban Francisco and request all good
citizens to co-operate with this movement in
keeping all finished marble work other than
the production of crude marble to be worked
in this city.
HEISE IS HONORED.
The Hero of the Schuetzen Verein Re-
ceives a Trophy for His Victory.
John D. Heise, who won the title and
was crowned the shooting king of the San
Francisco Schuetzen Verein. at Shell
Mound Park on Monday last, received an
ovation from his fellow marksmen la--t
evening, whe presented him with a trophy
for his glorious victory. California Hall,
where the festivities were held, was
crowded with visitors who were anxious
to get a glimpse of the illustrious Ger
man.
Promptly at 8 o'clock Captain J. F. j
Bolts, who had command of the sharp- i
shooters who were to honor their com- i
rade, assembled his men in the basement j
of the hall and at a given signal led them
to the hall above, where hundreds of j
pretty girls with their escorts were wait
ing to join in the general applause and
witness the crowning of the king.

EVEN THE SMOKE WAS YELLOW
Paul J. Martini and Viola Craso recently had a falling out. Each follows the
honorable calling of scavenger, and each held the idea that the other belonged
on the garbage heap along with the Examiner circulation. They were before
Judge Joachimsen yesterday to toll about It. The disturbance they had raised
brought a policeman to the scene and him they had jointly smote, against the
peace and dignity. During the trial W. H. Trade, a special officer at the crema
tory, was examined as a witness for the prosecution. Attorney Grant for the
defense asked Tiado if he had seen Examiners going into tho furnace at the
crematory lately.
"Oh, yes," replied the witness, "and the smoke was very yellow."
It would seem that Trade is an observing person. Also that when an attache
of the reduction works is on the stand, the seal of secrecy touching the delicate
matter of Examiner circulation Is off.
"I object to both the question and answer," said the attorney for the prosecu
tion, "as irrelevant, immaterial and too saffron for this court."
Such possibly was the view of the Judge, for he remarked, "Tut, tut." Yet
the ejaculation WU non-eommital, and may be construed to suit individual
taste. The incident caused a ripple of laughter In which the Judge endeavored
not to join.
Both the prisoners were convicted, but it is believed they do not have a clear
idea as to whether this was of having hit a policeman or of having handled the
Examiner circulation. They will appear for centence this morning and find out
by the severity of tho penalty imposed.
THE SAN FHAKCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 20, 1898.
COLONEL EUGENE LEHE DEAD.
The Late Leader of the Sixth Regiment, N. G. C,
Succumbs at the German Hospital.
Colonel Eugene Lehe, who until a few months ago was the commander of the
Sixth Regiment. N. G. C. died yesterday at the German Hospital. With the
passing of Mr Lehe California loses a man who was closely linked with the civic
and military life of the State. For years his name has been before the public,
as he was one of those men who. wherever they go. are at once marked as lead
ers. Added to this he had the faculty of making friends among people in all
ranks of life and was beloved by all who kenw him.
During the civil war he was stationed at the Presidio as lieutenant of the
regulars Later he went to Stockton, where for six years he served faithfully as
President of the City Council and for a number of years was commander of
the Grand \rmy post at that place. He was then commissioned as colonel of
the Sixth Infantry, fulfilling his duties faithfully and conscientiously. About
two years ago owing to failing health, he resigned and took up his residence
with his family at 51 Haight street. Monday he was taken to the German Hospi
tal ana an operaÂ»'on performed on him for cancer of the stomach. The strain
of the operation was too great, however, owing to his advanced age, and he
gradually sank, urtll yesterday afternoon, when death put an end to his suffer
ng Colonel Lehe was 57 years of age, and leaves a widow and four children. His
son E D M. Lehe. is connected with the Merced Falls Electric Company and
his daughters are Mrs. Grace Canfleld and Mi*Â»s Henrietta Lehe of Sacramento
and Mrs. Adell Stockwell of this city.
WHEAT AND BARLEY
MAKE A BAD BREAK.
LIVERPOOL AND PARIS WEAK
AND NO OUTSIDE SUPPORT.
The Talent Sold Viciously â Henry
Crocker Catches the Market
Both Ways.
Wheat opened strong yesterday regard-
I less of lower Liverpool and Paris markets.
! The strength was only temporary. After
j the few early shorts filled up, the market
began a toboggan which continued until
the close of the day. December wheat
I opened at $1 63Vi>. At the close the price
had dropped to $1 57, the lowest price
reached since the recent big advance.
Stop loss orders were found at every half
j cent decline. There was a very weak tone
\at the time when curb trading was
stopped for the day. Spot wheat was
weak and caused futures to yield quickly
to the pressure of shorts who hammered
viciously. Recent rains have done a great
deal of good. Altogether Influences could
not have been more fa\'orable for bear
hammering.
Barley, as was predicted by The Call
two weeks ago, had a severe break. De
cember opened at $1 26. Brokers with
outside connections seemed to have a
great many selling orders. The market
gave way rapidly under pressure of liqui
dation. At the closing prices had dropped
to $1 17% for December, a break of BVi
cents for the day. Had it not been for
the support given the market by shorts
who bought to secure profits, the market
would have suffered a greater break. The
market was weak and panicky, at the
close many predicting $1 lo for December
barley to-day. Without strong support
nothing can stop the decline over one
dollar. The rains were of marked benefit
to the barley crop.
Henry J. Crocker made a killing in Bell
ing barley. His clean-up runs up into tho
thousands.
PASSENGER RATES REDUCED.
Great Northern and O. R. and N.Will
Put Their Schedule Into Effect.
Instructions were received yesterday at
the local office of the Great Northern
â  Railway to commence the sale of tickets
' on May 21 to all points east at rates based
j on cut rates from Portland and Seattle,
! which have been in effect from those points
! for the past two months. This action on
i the part of the Great Northern will en-
I able passengers to take advantage of the
I reduced rates by an all rail line, as well
as by thg ocean routes.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation I
Company has also decided to make a bid j
for public patronage and announces that |
with the sailing of the State of Califor- j
nia on May 21 the passenger rates from
San Francisco to the East, via Portland,
will be as follows: First and second class, j
respectively, New York and Boston, $47.'
|81; <'hioago.s43 fA $27 50; St. Louis. $48, p. 2:
8t Paul, $32.?16;13utte.M0nt.. 537.52& The i
first-class tickets call for passage via the O. I
R. and N., Great Northern and connec
tions, and the second-class via O. R. and I
N., Oregon Short Line and connections.
With the Northern Pacific this makes
three railways that have decided to get
some of the business which has been
absorbed by the Canadian Pacific, and
further developments will be anxiously
awaited in railroad circles.
OPPOSED TO THE BOULEVARD.
Meeting of Property Owners at the
Wentworth Hotel.
A large meeting of property-owners was
held at the "Wentworth Hotel, 617 Bush
street, last night, for the purpose of op
posing the Bush-street boulevard.
It was decided to form a permanent or
ganization to be known as the Bush-street
Improvement Club. David Rich was elect
ed president, Mrs. Mary E. Newman vice
president, P. Boland secretary and J. B.
Kissing treasurer, and the following form
the executive committee: J. N. Manning,
Judge Toohy and A. B. Moulder. A sub
committee consisting of J. N. Manning, A.
S. Baldwin, Mrs. Mary E. Newman, A.
B. Moulder and P. Boland were appointed
to wait on the Supervisors and present
the views of the club in opposition to the
boulevard scheme.
A. S. Baldwin presented a report from
the figures of an expert as to the probable
expense of putting Bush street in proper
condition. The estimated amount was
$46,188.
A TRIP TO ICELAND.
Miss Jessie Ackerman Lectures for
the Benefit of the Red Cross.
Miss Jessie Ackerman, the well-known
mtssion worker and lecturer, addressed a
large audience in Native Sons'
Hall last night for the benefit
of the Red Cross Society. Her de
scriptions of the manners and customs of
so little is known were both interesting
and instructive, and the timely witticisms
thrown In here and there, just enough
of them and just at the proper time, kept
the audience In a continual state of good
humor. â Â»,.Â»,..
Miss Ackerman first told the story of
the discovery and settlement of the island
by the Norwegians, their mariner of
which paganism was overthrown and
which Paganism was overthrown and
Christianity introduced by legislation,
simply because the King of Norway had
changed his faith. Later when Denmark
obtained possession of the island the re
ligion was again changed from the Ro
man Catholic to the Lutheran, and the
latter is still the religion of the country.
The lecture was profusely illustrated
with stereopticon views and from time tc
time the Plymouth Quartette rendered
timely selections.

TO DEVELOP THE
ORIENTAL TRADE
A COMMISSION WITH THAT OB
JECT WILL GO TO CHINA.
It Is Under the Patronage of the
United States Government
and Will Do Good
Work.
Two members ot a commercial commis
sion to China, which has the indorsement
of the United States Government and is
being sent thither under the direction of
the Philadelphia Commercial Museum for
the furtherance of our trad* with China
and foreign lands generally, are in the
city. The two members are Hon. Sheri
dan P. Read, until recently United States
Consul at Tientsin, China, and Cassius A.
Green. They will meet the third member
of thfc commission in Shanghai. Dr. Gus
tavo Nlederleln, a well-known explorer
and pcii-mlst.
The consensus of opinion in the East Is
that this commission is most opportune,
and will he very valuable for the promo
tion of our trade with China. That it has
the Indorsement of the United Suites Gov
ernment will add much to its efficiency
in reaching Chinese high officials. Mr
Read, the head of the commission, is well
known, and his career of over ten years in
China has fitted him to direct a commis
sion of this sort, for he has devoted a
life time to the study of commerce, and
his experience of Chinese life and travel
will be invaluable. Mr*. Green is known
to the merchants of this country as an
expert on all matters touching the indus
trial and commercial development of the
United States. .
When the Pacific Mail Company learned
of the proposed commission to China it
tendered to the members complimen
tary passage from this city to Shanghai.
The Peking having been chartered by the
Government the same courtesy has been
extended by the O. and O. Company on
their steamship Doric.
That such a commission is of moment
to California is beyond question and the
gentlemen composing it will receive the
best wishes of all interested in the exten
sion of trade with the Oriental countries.

FAILURE TO PROVIDE.
A Carpet Layer and an Ex-Policeman
in Trouble.
Percy I* Smith, a carpet layer, on
Broadway, between Stockton tuid Powell
streets, was arraigned before: Judge Low
yesterday for failure to provide for his
four young children who were ranged up
in court for the Judge's edification. Mrs.
Smith testified that they were destitute
and had no means of support. She had
money in the bank at one time, but her
husband had squandered it. Smith
claimed that he had been sick, but prom
ised to support his family, and the Judge
continued the case for a week to see If
he would carry out his promise.
The wife of Fred Higgins, ex-policeman,
swore out a warrant yesterday for his ar
rest on the charge of failing to provide
for â  his three young children. She said
that she had to depend upon her mother
for their support. Higgins was dismissed
from the force for his conduct toward a
young girl who was then employed in the
Emporium, and his wife states that he is
now living with her and neglecting his
family. <*"

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig- I
uree at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath it, if any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal !
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high ;
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres- i
cure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When ;
the pressure is high in the interior and low !
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 19.â No *r?at success at- |
tended the effort to awaken speculative inter- j
ests in stocks to-day. There *a.s, in fact, no 1
very great effort to do so, the powerful influ- j
ences in the market being ipparenOy content j
to rest on their oars and wait for more defl- j
nite information of the operitiona of the op- 1
posing fleets in West Indian \vat;n. The ineas- 'â 
ures taken by the Government to shut off all â 
information on this subject have apparently
proved entirely successful, and Wall siti-oct was
completely in the dark. Even rumors on the
subject which are likely to prove plentiful in
T?uch circumstances were not forthcoming and :
the market was consequently -lull, there wera
a number of conspicuous advances during the
day, but they were by no m^ans uniform, nor
were they simultaneous. First on; stock, then
another, seemed to be the object of some spe
cial demand, but these Isolated movements tad
very little influence on the general list Sugar
was the most prominent of sncli stocks and ad
vanced suddenly about two points after the ear- |
ly hesitation. Tobacco also hud its period of j
strength.
Bonds showed a notable awakening into activ- ;
tlvity. evidently a result of the more abundant
supply of money. The Missouri Pacific issues
were all in demand and were advanced from
lÂ«t to "8% per cent. There were very hea.y
dealings also in Union Pacific fours at a slight I
concession fmm last night's prices. Total
sales, J2.37r,,0<VP.
T'nited States fours registered gained % per
cent and xho coupons 1% per cent in the bid ;
price. Then; was no other change.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 19.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were stagnant but steady to-day, â¢
business being checked by the general holiday
on the Continent (Ascension day). Americans
were easier. Consols and similar stocks were
good on easy money.
Details of the gold movement for the week
show the purchase of 921,000 pounds in bar j
gold and foreign coin, the receipt of 211, '^0
pounds from Austria, of 160,000 pounds from
Egypt and of 87,000 pounds from Australia and
15,000 pounds from South America, and the ex
port of 10,000 pounds to Peru.
The discount market was weakened to-day
by the release of a large amount of Japanese
money, which is being lent to the market in
June.
Jai an is also believed to be endeavoring to
Invest part of the indemnity money in bills.
All this contributes -to temporary ease in the
money market.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 19.â Wheat got to the call
price to-day, but closed under the top. It was
a short market, ruts having been good for sev
eral days. The best advance was In the last
hour on cable avices from Paris that .he remis
sion of the wheat tariff might be extended to
October 1, the Chamber of Commerce having
petitioned for that action. Liverpool cables
showed a decline for the day from %@2d a cen
tal. The continental markets were taking a
holiday. There was a continuance of favorable I
weather In the West. The Price Current wsu
rather bearish. Joseph Leiter had a bid to-day
for another heavy line of wheat from the same
people whom he sold 2.000,000 bushels for ship
ment to France about two weeks ago. The
opening strength here was added to by reprrts
emanating from St. Louis that complaints of
rust wheat were being received there from
northern sections of Missouri, and of course i
as the bearish local sentiment was based almost |
entirely on the unblemished reputatlo/i of the
coming crop, shorts took fright immediately
upon the shadow of suspicion being cast upun
it. July sold down to $1 05% and September to
gSHc, and they rose respectively to $1 07-i and
S9%c on the rust scare. July wheat opened I
higher at $1 06. sold up to $1 06%, declined to
SI 96%, recovered to Jl 07% and closed at $1 07
asked. September closed at SB 7 /tc. May opened
unchanged, declined to Jl 35 and advanced to
$1 45 bid at the close.
Corn was firm to-day and at one time was a
full cent above yesterday. July closed with a I
ne-t gain of >Â»,i&%c.
Oats followed corn, but closed unchantjcJ.
Provisions ruled dull and ea-y. Thare was
some buying by packers. Pork an} lard and

LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON, May 19.â third series of the
colonial wool sales closed to-day with a good
attendance. The offerings to-day numbered
11,673 bales. including good Queensland greasy,
which sold at the highest of the present prices.
New South Wales and New Zealand were
strongly supported. Competition was strong
throughout the sales, with prices ruling against
buyers, especially low cross-breds. During the
sales 206,000 bales were available, and of this
number 178,000 were catalogued, 10,000 with
drawn and 29,000 not offered and carried over
to the next series. The home trade purchased
82,000 bales and the continental buyers 70,000
bales. The Russian buyers purchased a few
hundred. A few trial lots were taken by the
American buyers. Early sales showed hesita
tion, with occasional declines, merinos and
cross-breda showing 5 per cent lower than the
second series. After a few days the sale be
came animated and prices hardened until the
March quotations were equaled. Low merinos
and heavy cross-breds, however, did not fully
recover the losses of the early part of the
series and closed at 5 per cent lower than the
second series. The offerings at the fourth
series are listed at 300,000 bales. Following are
the sales in detail:

SENATORIAL FIGHT.
Gage Disputes Their Assertions and
Lectures Omce-Seekers on
Evils of Sectionalism
in Politics.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 19.â Henry T.
Oag-e will be a candidate for the Re
publican nomination for Governor.
Borne of the close friends of Senator
Robert N. Bulla, who wishes to be
United States Senator, claim that
Gape's candidacy will only have the ef
f defeating Bulla and that Gage
Bhould step back. Gage in an Inter
view upon the subject say?:
"The election of a Republican Gover
nor from the south, instead of injuring
the prospects of a senatorial candidate
from that locality, would, in my opin
ion, strengthen his candidacy. These
assertions, made from time to time,
that the north conceded to the south
certain things, are based upon a
hypothesis purely problematical. Ob
viously, the only persons who could
make such concessions are those (with
the exception of holdover Senators) to
be elected to both houses of the Legis
lature, and they have not as yet been
even nominated.
"Who, therefore, can say that the
members to be elected will vote for a
Senator from the south? Is it not,
therefore, a matter of wild speculation
to insist that the north has conceded
in advance the Senatorship or anything
else to the south? This must be deter
mined by a vote of the people and not
by political arrangements of individ
uals. If the Legislature should be Dem
ocratic, what would become of the al
leged concession to the Republican
party? The Legislature can be Demo
cratic and a Republican Governor
might still be elected, or vice versa.
Thus it is a manifest fallacy to say that
the north concedes us anything.
"If 1 should permit the use of my
name for the nomination for Governor
(and I have not determined so to do),
I do not see how that could by any
possibility injure the ambition of any
man from the south aspiring to the
United States Senate or to any other
position of trust and honor.
"For a great many years the north '
had not only both Senators, but also I
Governor. If it be true that the north
would, at the proper time, concede to :
us the Senatorship, why would it not
be reasonable for us to assume that
it would do for us what the south has
so often in the past yielded to the
north, namely,- the Senatorship and
Governorship, with other places as
well? But so far as this political
clamor about the north and south is
concerned, permit me to cay, for one, I
that 1 despise this spirit of sectional
ism. I dislike this verbal division of j
our magnificent State into north and
south, or east or west, by interested j
office-seekers. People of this great
State will know whom to select and j
where to select when the proper time !
comes. Nationally and locally there is |
now no north, no south."
VIOLENT TIRADES OF
THE PARISIAN PRESS.
Every Form of Insult Used in Its
Frantic Abuse of the United
States.
Copyrighted, IS3B, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, May 19.â Patrie continues
this evening its violent campaign
against Americans. Every form of in
sult is used, and startling headlines
lead its readers to believe that a sort
of anarchy reigns in the United States.
An article -which is headed "Remem
ber" tries to excite public opinion by
declarine that in 1870 America con
gratulated Germany upon its victory
over France, as a triumph of civiliza
tion over barbarism.
Figaro has a peculiar passage, ex
tracted from rv>mte de Beust's book,
entitled "L.c Dernier dcs Napoleons,"
â¢which appeared in 1870. The author,
after blaming Europe for remaining a
simple spectator of France's oppres
sion in 1870, says: "Europe entire will
suddenly see the American eagle, after
having ravished the Queen of the An
tilles from Spain, begin to meddle with
her affairs and weigh down with re
doubtable heaviness upon the mon
archical destinies of little old Europe."
This prophecy, written twenty-six
years ago, which seems so likely to be
fulfilled, is attracting much attention
to-night.

COLLIER HAS QUIT.
The Special Department Land Agent
Was Mixed in His Reports.
Information from Washington leads the j
Federal officers to the conclusion that H. !
L. Collier, United States Examiner of
Surveys and Special Agent of the Interior
Department, has been dismissed from the
service. About four weeks ago he left
suddenly for the East to answer to
charges of misconduct In office and the I
fact that he has returned to his home In ;
Georgia is taken as evidence that he has
received his walking papers. Collier was
appointed under the second Cleveland ad- i
ministration, but he did not get along !
well with his superiors and was given an j
indefinite leave of absence. By promising i
to throw much light on alleged land
frauds in this State he was reinstated un- I
der the present administration. After ar- |
living here he sent to the department !
long reports of frauds in the matter of j
surveys.
This sadly hampered many transactions !
in the Land Office and prevented many of j
the surveyors who had done the work of i
getting their money for their services. I
Upon the appointment of Senator Qleavea
as Surveyor-General the matter was i
called to his attention and he made an
investigation, finding that Collier's re- i
ports were untrue. This information was j
sent to Washington. Collier, hearing that !
his conduct was under investigation, has- |
tened to Washington to fix up matters, j
and the information that he has returned
to his home leaves but one conclusionâ
that he has been dismissed.
PARTNERS DISAGREE.
E. Trespaille and A. E. Hiett Quarrel
Over the Right of Possession.
Trespaille Twice Arrested.
I ;. Trespaille and his partner, A. B.
Hiett, saloonkeepers at 723 Howard street,
gave the police an interesting and lively
time yesterday. The former was arrested
on a charge of threats to kill, and on his
release was rearrested for disturbing the
peace. The trouble arose over a loan
of 1150, which the men got from Tresâ
paille's father last February and which !
remained unpaid. Last Saturdays legal !
proceedings were instituted by the lender |
to recover the amount from the linn.
He had a Sheriff's officer placed in charge !
of the place. When Hiett went to the â¢
place he was ordered out by Trespaille, I
but stood his ground until forced to leave
at the point of a pistol. He returned
later, and a mutual agreement was
entered into which held good until yes- i
terday, when hostilities were resumed. '
Hiett was again forced out and on advice j
of his attorney, W. B. Daly, swore to a
warrant for threats to kill. Trespalllo j
was arrested, and on his release tried to |
eject H. P. Mannan, Hiett's representa- j
tive, from the saloon, when a scuffle
ensued. They made such a disturbance
that Officers T. P. Gibbons, T. C. Murphy
and J. J. O'Meara placed both men under
arrest.

THOUGHT HIM A FARRIER.
A Daring Thief Enters a Stable and
Takes a Valuable Animal.
One of the coolest and most daring rob
beriefl to happen In this city in the pasÂ£
I year was reported to the police last night
by Manager Elisha Stewart of the Santa
Clara Ranch Company.
He Informed them that a man entered
their stables at 337 Fifth street early yes
terday morning, nnd in the presence of a
half dozen employes coolly marched out
with a has- valued at RSO. His visit was
not questioned by the men, as it was
thought he was a blacksmith or some one
sent by those in authority.
The theft was not discovered until late
In the afternoon, when a painter named
Dassondell culled to get the horse, he
having purchased her the previous day.
Questioning developed the fact that the
man was about 5 feet 8 inches in height,
gray haired, and wore dark clothes. Chiel
Lees detailed two of his best men to trace
the daring thief.

ON THE VERGE
OF REBELLION
Yangtse Kiang Coolies
In Ugly Mood.
DANGEROUS SECRET SOCIETY.
AIMS AT ANNIHILATION OF
FOREIGNERS.
Agitation Against European and
American Machinery Which Is
Closing Many Sources of
Employment.
Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., May 19.â Late Ori
ental papers received per Empress of
India state that there are many indica-
tions of rebellion in theYangtse Klang
Valley, owing to the unsettled Indus
trial conditions. The Kolao Hui, a for
midable anti-foreign secret society,
continues its agitations and to increase
In numbers. The real ruler of Yangtse
Valley is stated to be Cheng Chihtung,
Viceroy of Hunan and Hupeh, who ia
disgusted with the weakness of the
Peking Government and is winking at
the organization and prospective arm
ing of the Kolao Hui Society.
It is estimated that the complete
opening up of the Yangtse Kianig and
its tributaries to European and Ameri
can steamers will throw a million boat
men and coolies, now dependent upon
freighting, out of employment. These
boatmen work from sunrise to dark
for only their daily rice and a few
strings of iron cash, paid them at the
end of their round trip, occupying one
to three months. When steamers suc
ceed them they see they must starve.
All through the Yangtse Valley their
loud anti-foreign mutterings are heard.
This feeling is particularly strong
wherever foreign machinery has been
introduced. A cotton mill recently es
tablished above Shan Hal has thrown
many weavers out of work. Recently
pome of them attempted to blow up the
mill and partially wrecked It. Two
were convicted and sentenced to 500
lashes each and terms of Imprisonment.
The recent anti-missionary outbreak
at Chung King has engendered very
bad feeling among the natives there.
Forty missionaries there, many of
whom are American Methodists, are
believed to be in danger. The Metho
dist mission at Kiang Peh, in that lo
cality, has been threatened with de
struction.
MASONIC BENEFIT
A GREAT SUCCESS
MATINEE WILL ADD GREATLY
TO THE CHARITY.
An Excellent Performance Pleased
Those Who Attended Yesterday.
Best Talent in the City on
the Programme.
The benefit performance for the Ma
eons' Orphans' and Widows' Home, at
the Baldwin Theater, added many shin
ing gold pieces to the quickly filling cof
fers of that charity. All society was
there, at least all the ladies were there,
the men, as usual at mitanees, being con
spicuous by their absence. The ladies
this time, however, had the best of It,
for the sterner sex missed a real theat
rical treat by staying away.
The programme consisted of the third
act of "Trilby" by the California Theater
Stock Company, the first act of "A Secret
Warrant" by Robert Mantell and his
company, and Pilar Morin in the "Dres
den Shepherdess," followed by the stere
opticon views of the "Passion Play," com
pleted the programme. Schecl's orches
tra, during the intermissions, also served
to please the audience. The "foyer scene"
from "Trilby" was excellently rendered
by the company, Frederick Paulding as
Svengali and Bertha Morrison as Little
Billee making quite a hit.
Robert Mantell received two curtain
calls from the appreciative audience. Mr.
Mantell sotmt-d to pay more attention to
please the people yesterday than, if it is
possible, at his regular performances.
Pilar Morin in "The Dresden Shepherd
ess" ended the programme.
Mr. Friedlander stated after the re
ceipts had been counted that the amount
taken in at the box office reached over
$400, and when the outside tickets sold
were counted the total to be turned over
to charity would be something like $1000,
as the boose was very well filled.
This performance and the Red Cross
benefit will be the last performances at
the Baldwin, the total receipts of which
will be turned over to the charity. Here
after, according to an agreement signed
by all the managers in the United States,
benefits will only be allowed at the thea
ters on condition that 12'/ 2 per cent of the
gross receipts be turned over to the
actors' fund of New York City for the
infirm, aged and disabled actors and
actresses. Messrs. Friedlander, Gottlob
& Co. have signed this contract, and on
these conditions only can benefits be
given at their theaters.
NOW A QUESTION
OF JURISDICTION
ROBINSON SUIT BEFORE THE
COMMISSION.
Unconfirmed Rumor That Hunting
ton Has Left the City to
Avoid Giving Testi
mony.
The State Board of Railroad Commls-
Bloners listened yesterday to arguments
on the question of whether or not the
board has jurisdiction In the suit recently
Instituted by J. R. Robinson against the
Southern Pacific Company.
Attorney Philbrook opened the argu
ment on behalf of the plaintiff. He de
voted half an hour to an attempt to
convince the commission that he had
been sneered at by opposing counsel for
the purpose of poisoning the minds of
the Commissioners against himself and
the interests of his client. He appealed
to the commission, and asked that the
alleged acts be given their true worth.
Attorney Pillsbury, who appeared on be
half of the railroad company, disclaimed
any attempt to discredit the standing of
opposing counsel, and denied that he had
been guilty of the acts charged. He also
appealed to the Commissioners, and ob
tained from each the assurance that
they had not witnessed any discourteous
acts.
In reply to the argument of Philbrook,
Pillsbury set up the claim that the Rail
road Commisioners have no Jurisdiction
in the present suit, for the reason that
the statute provides that such suits must
be brought by the Attorney-General at
the request of the commission. He also
claimed that if It ware lawful for persons
to bring such suits in the manner m
which the present proceeding has been
Inaugurated it would then be possible to
keep Mr. Huntlngton In court for the bal
ance of his life at the will of every Tom,
Dick and Harry who had or Imagined he
had a grievance against the railroad
company. He claimed that Robinson
must show that he had been personally
injured before the Railroad Commission
would have jurisdiction te hear his com
plaint.
Attorney Montelth, who aJso appeared
for Robinson, suggested to the commls-
Blon that if Hunttngton were brought be
fore a court of justice every time he was
guilty of an infraction of the law the
term of his life would not be sufficiently
long to make it possible for him to an
swer all the complaints that could be
brought against him.
Huntington was not present at the
hearing, and this fact gave rise to the
rumor that he had left the State in order
to avoid appearing as a witness In the
event that the Commission decided to hear
the case. His attorney denied the truth
of the rumor, and asserted that his client
Would be on hand when he was needed.
When the arguments were concluded
the Commissioners announced that they
would render a decision this morning at
10 o'clock.
JUDGE CAMPBELL'S FU&ERAL.

WELBURN IS MINING
FOR ALASKAN GOLD.
REVENUE AGENTS HAVE LO
CATED HIS WHEREABOUTS.
He Left Texas After His Second In
dictment and Instead of Going
to Mexico Went to the
Arctio.
It Is some months since O. M. Welburn
left California after his acquittal by a
Federal Jury of more than a score of
charges of withholding Government mon
ey, and since then hia whereabouts has
been involved in mystery- It is known
that ehortly after he left here he re
mained for a while in a town in Texas,
where he used to live before he came to
California, but after the United States
Grand Jury found a second indictment
against him he disappeared and the
United States Marshal could not find him.
A story was persistently circulated by
his friends that he had gone to the City
of Mexico and was living there under an
assumed name. This report for a time
threw the Government agents off the
track, and they censed actively purÂ»uiutf
the fugitive for the reason al-so that the
Government has made no provision Tor
the payment of the expenses of United
States "Marshals other than $2 per day
when engaged in the pursuit of criminals, j
This allowance being about one-seventh :
of the expense which would incurred for
railroad fare alone, has had a chilling
effect on the ardor of the officers of tho
law and the result has been that persons
wanted by the Federal authorities enjoy
much more immunity from capture and
punishment than criminals of almost any
other class. Notwithstanding the dis
couraging outlook, the special agents of
the Revenue Department have kept a
keen lookout for the whereabouts of the
ex-Collector, and their efforts have been
rewarded by the discovery that Welburn,
shortly after the second Indictment by
the United States Grand Jury, went to
Alaska, and is there now digging for gold
in the hope of retrieving his fallen for
tunes, and possibly with the idea that
should he make a rich strike he may bo
able to restore, if not all. at least a por
tion of the money alleged to have been
withheld from the Government and ef
fect a compromise through political in
fluence which may lead to the dismissal
of the charges against him. It is evident
that no United States Marshal or Reve
nue Agent will attempt to look for the
fugitive among the snows of Alaska at
an a'lowance of $2 per day for expenses,
and if the fugitive ex-Collector is thero
he will be undisturbed in his search for
gold.

CAPITALIST MILLER
POISONED BY GAS
HE WENT TO SLEEP WITH THI
LIGHT TURNED LOW.
Although the Windows Were Opened
the Deadly Fumes Took Effect
and Death Came Be.ore
Dawn.
William L.. Miller, a retired capitalist,
was found dead in his bed yesterday
morning at his residence, 1759 Butter
street.
He had retired at about 10 o'clock on
the evening before in his usual health and
spirits, and when breakfast time came he
was called and made no reply. Miss
Neale, a relative who resides in the house,
knocked at his room door, and receiving
no answer opened the door and found him
dead.
The room was filled with the Illuminat
ing gas, notwithstanding the fact that
both windows were open at the top about
six incheÃ.
The only gas burner in the room had
| been partly turned on. It had been the
habit of the deceased to leave the gas
burning low when he retired. The win
i dows being opposite each other caused a
draft when they were open, and it is be-
I lieved that a puff of wind blew out the
: flame and allowed the gas to escape into
I the room.
The deceased was fin years old and a
j native of Scotland, Some years ngo he
was employed in the Assessor's office, and
after that went into business, wh<>re he
realized a competence on which he re
tired.
He was a widower and leaves three
I sons, one of whom, William EL, was
i grand president of the Native Sons of the
! Golden 'West.
| POPULAR DOGS AND PONIES.
Large Crowds Still Fill the Exhibi
tion Tent to Watch Performance.
NorriÃ Bros.' dog and pony show at
Centra! Park seems to improve upon ac
quaintance. The performance given last
night was only one of the regular ap
pearances of the animals, but it was full
of good points and taking features. All
of the feats performed by the animals are
worthy of the closest attention, and the
way the pretty, high-stepping, graceful
ponies and their close friends and com
panions, the dogs, were applauded last
night showed that the large audience
was fully cognizant of the- labor and pa
tience required to bring the performers
up to the high state of docility and in- ,
teHigence exhibited.
The engagement here will end with
afternoon and evening performances Sun
day.
A Play for Charity.
Lawrence Barrett"? masterpiece "Fran
| cesca di Rimini," with all its beautiful j
j effects, costumes anrl scenery, will he pro !
; duced at the Bush-street Theater to
night for the benefit of the Little Sisters'
Infants' Shelter. This society is located
at 512 Minna street, and its object is to '
provide for the cnre and shelter of chil
dren whose parents are called from home
to their work. Like many otlie:- ehdi- j
lties, it frequently finds itself handi- i
capped for want of funds, and the man-
HBcnifcnt hopes that the entertainment to- :
night will provide sufficient to enable
them to broaden the ecope of their char
itable enterprise.
Suits Against Railroads.
I William E. Mortenson has commenced suit
; against the Market Street Railroad Com-
I pany for $25,000 damages for injuries sus
[ tamed by reason of the company's alleged
; carelesÃness in starting the car from
I which he intended to alight on Folsom i
i and Tenth streets on January 29.
G. J. M. E. d'Aguin has filed a complaint
I with the County Clerk against the Califor
i nia Railroad Company for $3000 for in
juries alleged to have been received by a
: derrick falling on him at California and
I Hyde streets, while some cars were be
1 ing shifted from a truck to the carhouse
of the company.
A Drunken Mother.
Mrs. Sarah Dockrell, 22S Everett street,
was sent to the County Jail for three
month 3 by Judge Low yesterday on a
charge of cruelty to children. When ar
rested Monday she was lying drunk on
her door step and her three children were
on a bed undressed and crying from
hunger. All the provisions in the house
were a bag of salt and a few potatoes.
The children have been sent to Mount St
Joseph's Orphan Asylum.
New Doctors.
The graduating exercises of the Califor
â  nia Medical College (eclectic') were held
UiPt Wednesday evening In the large par
lors of the Maclean Hospital, 230 Douglas
street. After the ceremonies the manage
: ment gave a banquet to the college fac-
u lty and graduates. Degrees were con
i ferred upon W. M. Forster, John Hard
ing-Mason, G. E. Hall, G. D. Pratt, W. N.
Kennedy and A. Stuttaford.
Benefit of the Charter.
A mass meeting has been called for this
evenfng at the Turk Street Temple by the
San Francisco Trade and Labor Alliance
at which the new charter will be fully
discussed. The meeting will take the !
form of a debate on the question: "Is the j
new charter for the benefit of the citizens
of San Francisco?" Some of the ablest
speakers in the labor movement have been
secured and it is expected that some in
teresting points will be brought out.
On Trial for Forgery.
John Cratg was placed on trial In Judge
Wallace's court yesterday on a charge of
forgery. He forged the names of Irving
M. Scott and Thomas H. Thomson to a
check on the Crocker- Woolworth Bank
for $300 six years ago.
Charter Meeting.
The West Castro Street Improvement
Club will hold a charter meeting to-night
in Anderson's Hall, 708 Douglas street.
Prominent speakers have been secured to
address the meeting.
"No, Sir,
I do not care to turn my stomach
| into a laboratory for chemical experi-
ments. What you desire to sell me
may be all right, but, again, it may be
all wrong. I am taking no chances
. and I know what I am getting when I
buy
Duffy's Pure
Malt Whiskey
Please let me have that or nothing."
That is the sort of talk for a dealer
who is short-sighted enough to think he
serves his own interest by presenting an
obscure substitute for such a standard
article as Duffy's Pure Malt. For dys-
p epsia, indigestion and similar troubles,
as well as for preventing colds and
pneumonia, it has no equal.

THE TALENT
ON VELVET
The Bookies Hard Hiton
Nearly Every Race.
NERVOSO A BIG SURPRISE.
BUCKWA, HEAVILY BACKE:
BEAT MOBELLITO HANDILY.
Flandes Scored Brackets Again â The
Top-Heavy Favorite Shasta
Water Won in a
Drive.
The talent made life miserable for the
bookies at Oakland track yesterday. The ;
four favorites that won were strongly <
supported, and the two outsiders. Nervoso j
and The Fritter, that led out their fields, j
came in for considerable backing at the j
hands of the shrewd set. The track was ;
still heavy, but the horses ran true to j
form.
The curtain raiser was a mile selling
event, with a big field of fourteen going
to the post. Before the betting began St. j
Distaff was heralded as a good thing, and j
was played down to 11 to 5 favoritism. ,
The touted one ran a good race under
Piggotfs guidance, but was easily downed
by the 15 to 1 shot Nervoso, ridden by
Charley Maoklin. Rebekah, asoto 1 ,
chance", finished in the show.
H L Frank's Inverness colt Mallakwa
appeared to be the real thing for the four |
and a half furlong scramble for two-year-
Olds, and went over to the barrier a 2 to a
chance, played down from 7 to 10. head
ing all the way, the youngster was given
â  hard rub at the finish by the second
choice, Rev Hooker, winning all out by a \
length. Polka was a tiring third.
The Fretter made the two choices, Owy- i
hoe and Banewor. look cheap in the five j
furlong jaunt for members of the two
vear-old division. Clawson had the son i
of Brutus in front at the head of the .
stretch, and he won hands down from the
latter. Owyhee. the even money choice,
never looked a winner from the time the !
barrier was released.
For the mile nad a sixteenth event, de
cided under selling conditions. Mat
Btorn'o colt Morellito was installed an
even money chance, with Buckwa next in :
demand at 7 to 5. At post time the condi- ;
tions were just reversed, Buckwa i
issuing from the paddock a 4 to j
5 favorite. It was a procession. Buck- !
wa was allowed to cut out his own i
pace, and the big gelding galloped in win- ,
ncr, over two lengths ahead of Morellito. ;
Pan Marco took show honors without ef- j
fort.
In the seven furlong run. Flandes, with
Thorpe again In the saddle, made it three
straight. The big chestnut colt was an
overwhelming- favorite in the ring, and
leading from the time Ferguson released
the harrier, was ridden hard at the wire
to heat Mistleton a length. Los Prletos
appeared to better advantage in the dry
going, securing the show from Master
Mariner.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry. Shasta
Water, was made a prohibitive. 1 to 7
choice, and at the end Thorpe was com
pelled to ride hard to lead the outsider
Howard out a half a length.
TRACK NOTES.
McDonald, a promising boy In the saddle,
left for St. Louis last nirht. He will ride
for Hughey Jones, and ought to do well under
that honest pencller's guidance.
The game hangs on well to the last. Four
teen bookmakers swung their signs out at yes
terday's cut-in.
Sausallto. it would seem. Is not to enjoy a ;
monopoly of the poolroom business. Johnny
Humphrey and Glenn & Broyer will open up i
a room at Ocean View on Monday next.
Tommy I^tti-ldge, the well-known trainer, .
will shortly depart for Chicagro, where he will 'â¢
again enter the employ of Bookmaker George â 
Rose.
Hughey Jones took the overland for St. Louis ;
last eveninp.
Py Holly has decided to drop off and try and
win a purse or two at his old home, Colorado
Springs, on the way to Denver.

J. Toomey Wanted to Enlist But Was
Sent to Jail.
J. Toomey 1b a young man 21 years of
ago and lived with his mother at 333 Har
riet street. He appeared yesterday before
Judge Joachlmsen to answer to a charge
of battery upon his mother, who was In
court with one of her eyes blackened by
a brutal blow from her son. Toomey
seemed to be on the repentant stool and
asked the Judge to let him off as he
wanted to Join the army and go to the
Philippines to fight the Spaniards.
"I will send you to jail for six months, "
retorted the Judge. "Any man who would
strike his mother would never make a
good soldier."

NEW SECRET AGENT
FROM WASHINGTON
CEMPOBABY AGENT SPBAQUE
BELIEVED FBOM OFFICE.
iB. S. BrownÂ© Will Look Out
Spanish Spies and Other Male
factors Around San Fran
cisco Harbor.
â  ;â .;â â¦ â  â 
Early yesterday morning 1 a keen-eyed
young man entered the office of Secret
Service Agent Sprague and, after pre
senting his card, announced that he had
been sent hither by the Secretary of the
Treasury to relieve him of his office. His
credemtials were in proper form, and Mr.
Sprague turned over the office to him
without any further formality.
The newcomer iB R. S. Browne of
Washington, D. C. He has been in the
service of the Government for seven
years, and has made a brilliant record
for astuteness, having made many im
portant captures of counterfeiters and
shovers of the queer. The work cut out
for him in this city is of a more difficult
and responsible nature, for his especial
charge will be the espionage of Spanish
spies and other enemies of the Govern
ment.
The Government has been aware for
some time that the ex-Spanish Minister,
Polo de Bernabe, has taken up his abode
in Canada for the purpose of organizing
an attack by the Spanish fleet upon cities
on the Atlantic seaboard and for the fur
ther purpose of being in ready communi
cation with the army of spies which he
has scattered all over the ii T nited States.
The explosion at the Santa Cruz Pow
der Works is believed to have been a j
part of the plot, and it is understood that !
other plots are hatching on this coast to |
hamper the Government in its war '
against Spain and to furnish information j
to the Spanish Minister regarding the j
preparations made and being made for
carrying on the conflict. For these rea- ;
sons it has been felt prudent to send one ;
of the most expert of the secret service
men to this coast to thwart the plans of
the secret foes of the country.
Mr. Browne was disinclined to talk to
the reporters as to his mission. He did
not know, he said, whether his appoint
ment was to be temporary or perma- ;
nent. All that he would say was that i
these were stirring times and that there
were other things besides counterfeiters
to look after.
Mr. Sprague was ylad to be relieved.
He said his appointment was for ninety
days only, and that when the time ex
pired he wrote to the Secretary of the i
Treasury notifying him of the fact and :
requesting to be relieved. The Secretary
asked him to remain at his post a while >
longer, until some one from the East ;
should be sent hither.

HER CHARMS
COST HIM
HIS PLACE
J. W. Hinkel Now Out
of a Job.
HE LOVED NOT WISELY.
A GRASS WIDOW CAUSES HIS
DOWNFALL.
He Took Her for a Drire anc
Both Were Arrested on
Charges of Drunk
enness.
J. W. Hinkel, collector for a well
known real estate firm, now wishes he
had not become smitten with the charms
of Mrs. Mary Ruhling. a dashing grass
wldow, who a short time ago left her
husband In the East and came to this
city. In an evil moment Hinkel, who Is
the son of the well-known contractor,
met the woman and invited her to accom
pany him to the Cliff House. They had
several bottles of wine and were in a
hilarious condition when they started to
drive hack to the city.
While driving through the park their
horse became unmanageable and ran
away. Park Officer Arellaes gave chase.
and with the aid of a lariat succeeded in
stopped the maddened animal. Hinkel
showed a deposition to be ugly and
accused the officer of being too "fresh,"
and becoming incensed at his remarks,
Arellaes placed him under arrest.
At this Juncture Mrs. Ruhling became
belligerently indignant, and dared the
policeman to arrest the gay collector.
"You shall not take him away," she
declared. "Touch him at your peril."
Arellaes blew his whistle, which was
answered by two of his fellow-officers,
and, after a short struggle, the policemen
finally succeeded in arresting the couple.
They were then diyven to the O'Farrell
street station, where they were charged
with being drunk.
Hinkel had $17;> 80 on him, and he offered
to put up the amount to secure his re
lease. Tne desk sergeant, however, re
fused to discharge him until he had be
come sober.
A: tor being thrown into a cell Hinkel
pent for his employer, and explaining his
predicament begged his assistance. His
employer consented to furnish the nee
. ssary amount of bail, but positively re
fused to assist the woman in regaining
her freedom. But Hinkel would not ac
cept his offer, declaring that he would
rather die than desert his fair companion.
ral hours later Hinkel and the
woman were released on $10 bail, which
was taken from the amount found in the
collector's pockets.
Through the efforts of several friends
Hinkel on the following day had the cases
against him and Mrs. Ruhling dismissed.
After learning the facts of tne disgrace
ful episode. Hinkel's employer sent nim a
note informing him that his services were
no longer n quired.
Mr?. Ruhling gave her address as
Haight street, near Buchanan, but in
quiry in that neighborhood failed to re
veal her whereabouts.
IN COMMEMORATION
OF THE ASCENSION
SOLEMN SERVICES IN THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH.
Masses Are Solemnized the Same as
on Sundays With Vespers and
Benediction in the
Evening.
Ascension Day. in honor of the ascen-
Flon of Christ forty days after the resur
rection, was solemnized in the Catholic
churches throughout the city yesterday.
It being a holy day of obligation, services
were observed the same as on Sunday,
with the exception that the sermon which
Is preached at high mass on the Sabbath,
Jn many churches was omitted. At St
Jsratius Cathedral, however, an address
was delivered both at high mass and at
all vespers.
At St. Mary's Cathedral the regular
Sunday service with the omission or the
sermon was held. At the high mass at
o'clock the Rev. Father Hanuigan
eOiriated as celebrant, being assisted by
members of the clergy and acolytes. The
altar and sanctuary decoration" consisted
of pure white artificial and natural
Jiowers, and myriads of wax candles. The
;it tendance at all the churches was un
usually large.
BETT7RN OF J. C. STUBBS.
The Passenger Rate Differences of
the Western Roads No. Yet
Adjusted.
J. C. Stubbs, third vice-president of the
Southern Pacific Company, returned from
his Eastern trip Wednesday night. Mr.
Stubbs denied the published report that
he had left to attend the meeting of the
FrMght Traffic Bureau in Milwaukee. The
object of his trip was to attend a meet-
Ing in St. Louis for the purpose of reor
ganizing the Southwestern Traffic As
sociation of Texas. The meeting did not
take place on account of lack of a
Quorum and Mr. Stubbs immediately went
to Chicago, to be present at a meeting of
the executive officers of the western
roads, for the purpose of discussing the
passenger rate reduction inaugurated by
the Canadian Pacific, and if possible ar
rive at some amicable adjustment of the
differences. The last-named railway did
not send a representative, for the reason
that J. M. Hill of the Northern Pacific
would not go to St. Louis to enter the
conference. "The matter," said Mr.
Stubbs, "is now where it originally stood,
and it does not appear as if there would
be an early settlement of the difficulty. I
understand that the Canadian Pacific had
expressed a willingness to surrender the
differentials enjoyed by them on freight
traffic at the Milwaukee meeting, but
they evidently do not choose to do so in
regard to the passenger traffic, as their
absence from the St. Louis meeting would
imply. 1 am unable to state what the
outcome will be. and I feel that my trip
wa.s somewhat barren of result."
CAMPBELLS SUCCESSOR.
The Nephew of the Late Jurist Enters
the Race.
Archibald Campbell, nephew of the late
Judge Campbell, is the latest candidate
in the field for the place vacated by the
deceased jurist. "Archie." as he is famil
iarly known, has a host of friends who
arc striving hard to have the Supervisors
appoint him his uncle's successor. At
torneys Mogan, Spinetti and Gavigan are
In the fight, and each is confident
of victory.
The friends of Archie Campbell claim
â¢ mlnentiy qualified to fill the posi
tion, and on account of his relationship
to the late Judge should be given the
place.
Jennie Kean Scores a Point.
The charge of assault with a deadly
weapon preferred by Jesus Borboa, pro
r of the Spanish-American Hotel on
Geary street, against Miss Jennie Kean,
one of his roomers, was dismissed by-
Judge Low yesterday, as there was no
evidence to show that Jennie had done
anything but exhibit the hatchet in a
threatening manner. She was Imme
diately arrested nn a charge of malicious
mischief for breaking in the door of her
room, and was released on her own recog
nizance.

GOOD DOGS ON THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR.
Beauty Turned Out in Great Numbers Yesterday to View the
Beasts at the Kennel Club's Show.
THE San Francisco Kennel Club was
highly pleased yesterday with the at
tendance which showed a marked In
crease over the opening day of the
bench show. Last evening the ladles were
well represented among the visitors. The
dogs that caught the eye of the fair ones
were the fox terriers, spaniels and pugs.
The pug cannot be classed as a beauty un
less the part bulldog nose and the "what
do-you-think-about-me" look, which is
decidedly inquisitive, are accepted as
points in value and sweetness, which only
the pug apparently commands.
Much interest was manifested yesterday
afternoon in the judging of pointers and
setters and the owners of dogs that cap
tured blue ribbons were elated when the
judge handed them the winning colors.
The decision giving the ribbon to the beau
tiful and stylish young pointer Alex C
over Calamity Kennel's Lock was a fea
ture of the judging that was appreciated
by breeders of sporting t*ogs.
Considerable discussion resulted yester
day among the fanciers of the greyhound
concerning the capture of the blue ribbon
by Skyball over several competitors
which were expected to easily defeat Sul
livan's latest addition to his kennel. Of
course there were many beautiful dogs
in his company but all dogs cannot be
prize winners.
The collies are an excellent lot, and
when they were "shot" yesterday after
noon by a camera artist as they stood in
line facing the marksman, much laughter
resulted when the flash startled the dogs
in all directions, but the intelligent ani
mals soon detected the joke, and with
wagging of tails they returned to their
handlers evidently pleased with the sur
prise accorded to them by the photo
grapher.
The show will doubtless attract thou
sands of people to-day and to-morrow.
Dogs of high quality and many of them
valued at thousands of dollars cannot be
seen every day. Apart from the oppor
tunity of patting canines that have won
laurels at all of the great bench shows
held in America and Canada la recent
years, the public should not forgot that
the proceeds will be devoted to the cause
of charity, and that fact alone should at
tract large gatherings of ladies and gen
tlemen to the pavilion.
THE JUDGING.
Result of the Second Day's
Work in the Ring.
Judfiringr began at 10 a. m. and continued
until 1 o'clock. At 2 o'clock the judge re
sumed his labors, and at 5 judging was
concluded for the (Jay.
Greyhounds were a fine lot, so fine, in
deed, that comparlsans among the win
ners are well-nigh invidious.
in puppies, dogs and bitches, Petronius '
and Clare B were alone and received first â 
prizes. Both are fair speclments. In \
novice dogs. Dr. Norman is the best look- â ;
ing dog and received the blue ribbon, and <
I OGrady and Fear Not were properly |
served with red and white.
In novice bitches, Beatrice was first,
being head and shoulders in front of
Black Patti. In limit dogs, Skyball was
first without a rival; in bitches. Minnie j
E received the first prize, no other ribbon '
being awarded.
In open dogs. Sunol, second, should
most certainly have been placed over
Pretender, the winner, who is flashy look
ing, but lacks in chest and hindquarters.
In open bitches, the famous Nellie Con
roy could not possibly have lost, though
Diana, third, might well have changed
places with Mercy May, the second bitch.
The winner's prize fell to Sky ball, and
justly so, but Sunol should have been
placed in reserve instead of Pretender.
In the winners, bitches, the prize fell ;
rightly to Nellie Conroy, with Beatrice i
properly reserved.
American foxhounds were a small class, i
but select. The puppies were well judged. 1
Major, the first, being a typical hound. i
The same may be said of the blue-ribbon
puppy bitch, Dinah. Her competitors,
though fair, were both inferior to her in
every respect.
In Borzois Russian wolfhounds, one !
kennel of six was exhibited. Saladin, a :
dog, received the tricolored winner's rib- ;
bon, and Czarina, his- litter sister, was ,
reserved.
In bloodhounds, the famous champion
Buckshot II was beaten by his own pup, !
Ben Butler, who was first in the winners' ;
class, his little sister, Madge, being
awarded reserve.
One fair specimen of the Chesapeake !
Bay was shown, the bitch Bessie receiv
ing first open and winner's.
Pointers were a large entry. Mr. Bell's !
decisions In this class were above criti
cism. Glendale, in puppy : dogs, was I
placed first over Van Dyke, excelling the
latter in head and marking.
In novice dogs over 55 pounds, Don G i
was an easy winner, between Duke of !
Tyrol and Cliff was just a toss up for j
second place.
In novice bitches over 50 pounds Fan
nette was alone, and received the blue '
ribbon. She is a decidedly good bitch, and
would win out in good company.
The English setter class is one of the
finest ever seen on this coast, but Judge
Bell's decisions were not quite as perfect
as in some other breeds.
Irish setters were a large and fairly â 
good class.
That rattling good dog Champion Nemo !
II captured the winners' prize, the reserve i
going to Jesse Moore Whisky. The
bitches were properly served with Lady
Inroelleo first and Champion Lightning re
serve.
In Gordon setters the winner was Dick i
111. who should, however, most : certainly i
have yielded pride of place to Major 11,
who is a far better dog, with more type i
and character.
The bitch Jewell was rightly adjudged
the winner over Belle M reserve.
The field trial. prize fell to Aleck C, who
; properly beat Lock and Dash Antonio. In
the bitches Countess X should have re
ceived first, being a better bitch than the
much vaunted Peach Mark, who is greatly
overrated. â¢
Irish water spaniels â¢ were few in num
ber. Dan Maloney was rightly placed
winner of the dogs and Belle March of the
bitches.
In field spaniels Rondo, won out easily
I in the winners' class for dogs; no bitches
I were shown.
Cocker spaniels made a powerful show-
Ing, but were much of a sameness.
In black - dogs, under twenty-eight
pounds, Dufferin Pastime was rightly ad-
Judged winner over Pedro, reserve; in the
bitches, Polly. Pastime captured the red,
white and blue. -
In bitches, others than black, under
twenty-eight pounds. Banner Trilby beat
Lassie Jean for the - winners' prize, the
latter receiving reserve.
, The only kicker was Dr. Ed Dial of San
Luis Oblspo. who claimed that Mr. Bell
was not judging : strictly according to
standard. â¢ . ."â â  - . .... ... '.-.-, ,
J. "W. Burrell judged the collies with
great discernment. Alto Clifton | won In
puppy dogs, beating Verona Captive: In
head and coat. The other competitors
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 20, 1898.
were not in it.
Gauby Girl beat Shadeland Quean In
puppy bitches on the same grounds.
In novice dogs Verona Approbation was
but a shade better in markings than
Goldfine, otherwise it was about a match.
The others were well placed.
In bitches Verona Artistic deserved her
success.
In the limit dogs Verona Braw Scot was
successful, and in bitches Verona Bonnie
Brae repeated her San Jose success, beat
ing the imported Heather Molly with ease.
In open dogs Braw Scot scored again,
and Bonnie Brae in bitches.
The winners' class was a foregone con
clusion. Braw Scot receiving the prize for
dog with Approbation reserve, and Bon
nie Brae carrying off the bitches 1 ribbon,
with Artistic in reserve. The reserve in
the bitches should, however, have been
awarded to Heather Molly, who excels
Artistic in head, coat and markings.

BUSY TIMES
ON THE FRONT
Grain Cars Loading at
the Sea Wall.
FIREWOOD FOR SOLDIERS.
SIX THOUSAND CORDS BEING
CUT AT POWELL STREET.
Much Activity at the Mail Dock and
Pacific-Street Wharf Over Get
ting Ready the Troop
Ships.
While business generally Is quiet in
shipping, still .here are some portions of
the water front where things are going
with a rush. At the Mail Dock double
gangs of men are at work getting the
steamers City of Peking and City of Syd
ney ready for the troops who are to go on
them to Manila. At the Oceanic dock the
Australia is ready for her freight and as
soon as the Government begins sending
freight and passengers the steamer will
be ready to receive them. At the seawall
several gangs of men are at work loading
wheat into cars on the belt railroad. The
grain Is going to New Orleans via the
SunÃet route and will be shipped from
there In a neutral bottom to Europe. At
Powell-street wharf a couple of donkey
engines are going day and night cutting
up 6000 cords of wood for the use of the
troope at the Presidio, while at Meiggs
wharf M. Fitzgerald, the reporter for the
Merchants' Kxchaiiyr, was busy all day
keeping tab on the big fleet of vessels thai
sailed.
On the Mall Dock the general opinion Is
that neither the Peking nor Sydney will
be ready for service before Saturday or
Sunday, and in that event it will be Tues
day or "Wednesday next before they can
get away. Of course, delay in their case
means that the Australia also will be de
layed, so that all three of them will get
away together.
The wheat is the first shipment that has
gone by rail for Europe from San Fran
cisco. There are about 5000 tons of It, and
as the cars are loaded they are moved
around the belt railroad to the freight
slips at Lombard-street wharf and there
transferred to the Southern Pacific
freight boats and thence to the yards
across the bay. where the trains for New
Orleans are made up. It is a very ex
pensive way of handling grain, but then
the long voyage around the Horn is
avoided and the shipments are made on
hurry orders.
The 60u0 cords of fire wood now being
rut at Powell-street wharf are only a
commencement, and the chances are that
the work will go steadily on as long as
there are troops at the Presidio and the
old Bay District track.
Captain James Johnson is very sick at
his home in Tc-mescal. At one time it was
feared that he would not recover, but
yesterday he was a little better, and his
businessassociates expect to Bee him out
and about again shortly. Captain John
son is the senior partner of the firm of
Johnson & Emigh, president of the J. F.
Cunningham Company and part owner of
the ship John Ena. bark Harvester, bark
entine Ruth and schooners Five Brothers,
Seven Sisters, Honolulu and Rachel. He
has five sons and seven daughters and
two of his schooners got their names
from that fact.
The American ship Reaper has cleared
for Comox. B. C, where she will load coal
for Honolulu. After discharging at that
port she will load sugar for New York.
The British ship Crown of India, be
fore reported as being partly dismasted
150 miles from Newcastle. N. S. W., while
on her way to San Francisco, has been
towed into'Sydryy. N. â¢Â». W.

who is accused of having caused the
death of Miss Susan A. McCalmot. Ex
tradition papers were issued and Dr. Or
pen went back with Detective Maddern
on the Marlposa.
The Passion Play.
"The Passion Play," which has been a
strong matinee attraction at the Baldwin
Theater for some weeks past, will be pre
sented but a few times more, as the final
performance is to take place next Mon
day night. There will be matinees to-day.
Sunday and again on Monday, and in the
evening of that day the pictures will be
displayed for the last time. The play is
shown with attractive realism, and each
scene, exactly as presented at Oberam
mergau, is thrown upon the screen to the
accompaniment of music or lecture. The
prices for next Monday night will be the
same as prevail at the matinees.

When she suffers in that part of her organ-

her body, and her suffering is pictured in
her face, and reflected in her disposition

It is easy for a woman to be well and
strong in a womanly way. Dr. Pierce'9 v Fan

important and delicate organs that consti-
tute womanhood. It makes them J strong
and healthy. It allays inflammation, heals
ulceration, soothes pain and gives the tor-
tured nerves rest and tone. . It prepares for
wifehood and motherhood. Taken during
the expectant period it banishes the usual
discomforts, makes the coming of baby
easy and painless, and insures the health
of the newcomer. Thousands of women
have said so. All good druggists sell it ., ;
" Please accept mv thanks." writes Mrs. Maud
