STOCKTON*, Nov. 27.â At least six
persons were killed and over a score
Injured by an explosion that occurred
at 4:20 o'clock this morning 1 aboard the
California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamship T. C.
Walker on the up trip from San Fran
cisco to Stockton. When near -.fourteen
mile Slough the steam drum burst with
terrific violence, scattering death and
destruction throughout the forward end
of the vessel. The four walls of the en
gine-room -were demolished and the
lower deck, hurricane deck and Texas
deck directly over the engine-room were
wrecked. The direction of the flying
debris was upward and autward toward
the bow; Hut for this the loss of life
would have been much greater, as most
of the passengers occupied staterooms
toward the rear of the vessel. The
damage to the T. C. Walker will not

ter may never be known, but rumors
are afloat here to the effect that the
T. C. Walker's boilers were carrying a
greater steam pressure than was safe.
The death-dealing accident occurred
just as the boat was leaving Turners
Landing", at Black SJuugh, fourteen
miles beio-.v 3tÂ» kt.-n. Ti;e first inti
mation of trouble was the escape of
steam, followed by a sharp report
â¢which shook the boat from stem to
stern, making the timbers creak, dis
abling the electric light plant and leav
ing the boat in total darkness.
The terrified passengers rushed out
to find the dead and dying in the for
ward part of the boat. Heartrending
moans from the unfortunates and
screams from the women passengers
made an impression on those present
which time never can efface.
The officers quickly got out lanterns
provided for such emergencies and the
work uf Investigation and rescue began.
Glass and other debris were scattered
over the decks, the pilot house was
destroyed and tl. forward part of the
boat a mass of wreckage.
Engineer Henry was found dying in
his statero* and it was with con
siderable difficulty that he was extri
cated.
Captain Tulan. whose room was near
the pilot-house, was shut in and had to
be extricated with axes. When re
leased he. was so scalded that the
flesh drnT'ji â >'. from his limbs and ad
hered to his steam-soaked clothes.
W. A. Blunt, foreman at the sugar
beet ranch, happened to be below, and
died as he was being carried to the
upper deck. It was some time before
his indcatity was discovered.
There was not a drop of medicine on
board. The crew, in desperation, tore
down piles of freight until they found
a case of sweet oil. Flour was brought
from the kitchen .d an angel ap
peared on the sc:ne in the person of
Mrs. Frances Robinson of 1131 % Har
rison street, San Francisco. This lady

St. Luke's. She came down among the
sufferers in her nightrobe and in bare
feet and began mixing oil and flour,

which she applied, binding up the
fearful burns w.th strips of sheets,
which a member of the crew stood by
!ig up. No doctor was aboard and
the woman, with wonderful nerve,
worked and directed the men. The cold
morning wind swept through the
wrecked boat, dealing what would have
been certain death to many wounded
had she not been equal to the emer
gency.
One Italian deckhand was below in
I the water and others jumped Into the
river in their desperation to relieve
the awful agony. While part of the
crew rescued the? . from the water oth
i ers improvised a hospital and worked
I heroically.
There is no telephone or telegraph
at the point of the disaster. One of
the officers, engaging a rig at a ranch
near by, drove desperately to Stockton
and gave the alarm. Every doctor in
the city was called out and the steam
ship Clara Crow made ready to go to
the scene with surgeons and necessary
appliances.
While this work of rescue was being
arranged the steamship Dauntless came
up the river, and in spite of their
awful sufferings those on board the
Walker could not refrain from cheers.
As soon as signaled the Dauntless
came alongside, and every officer and
man was ordered on board the Walker
to assist in the work of rescue.
It was found that the Walker was
so badly crippled she could not pro
ceed, and it was decided to bring the
! injured to Stockton on the Dauntless.
Litters were made ready and the suf
ferers were carried to the lower deck
and laid in rows, with one dead already
â  among them. The awful scene was only
j relieved by the heroic work of the
; nurse, assisted by Miss Keagle and
other brave women as they moved
among the victims. The body of Cap
tain Tulan was carried to a room, as
was that of Henry, whose wife, herself
fatally injured, pathetically called his
name. When all had been transferred
the Dauntless proceeded to Stockton.
On the crowded deck were many able
j to walk, but their faces were swathed
, in bandages.
Three miles below the mouth of the
channel the Clara Crow met the boat
and six surgeons went aboard and be
i gan administering to the sufferers until
additional medical aid arrived on a
steam launch.
The scene on the lower deck of the
Dauntless was distressing. Around one
dead man lay several In agony, oth
ers lulled to insensibility by heavy
opiates.
At the landing place vast throngs
were already gathered. Many had
relatives on the Walker, and as
usual, conflicting rumors were afloat.
The suspense and uncertainty were
responsible for many scenes of hys
teria among women as the boat came
into view. The uninjured all tried to be
first to wave to waiting loved ones a
signal of safety.

the grim scenes began. Patrol and
ambulances backed up and trip after
trip was made to the Receiving Hos
pital. Then came the dead wagon. It
made a half-dozen trips to the Morgue
before It's day's work was over. The
entire city seemed to be one of mourn
ing.
Nine men having no homes here were
taken to the Receiving Hospital. The
less dangerously injured were sent out
to the County Hospital in carriages.
Mrs. Watson Henry, wife of the chief
engineer, died at her home soon after
being brought to this city. Jerry
Dailey, a fireman, died at the Receiving
Hospital. Both bodies, with those of
Tulan. Blunt, Henry and Law are In
the Morgue, making six dead In all.
The scene had its heroes as well as
its heroines. One poor Italian on board
was burned terribly, but refused to
give his name, saying his wife would be
alarmed and he wanted to be the first
to break the news to her.
Many rumors are afloat as to the
:ause of the explosion. It is said the
steamer left the landing with 160
>ounds of steam, when her boilers could
Hand but 150.
John York and wife of this city were
the first to be awakened by the explo
sion. Mr. York says the first incident
to attract unusual attention occurred at
8 o'clock last night, when the steamship
ran Into a mud bank near Denicla. She
got oft all light and everybody was
THE DEAD:
asleep when the explosion occurred
this morning. Mr. York noticed during
the night a very peculiar noise, such
as would have been made by escaping
steam. It gave Mrs. York some con
cern, but he assured her that it was
nothing unusual, and they were both
sound asleep when the explosion oc
curred.
The report was like the boom of a
cannon. Just then Mr. York heard a
passenger going past his room groan
ing with pain, as if seriously hurt. Mr.
York got out as quickly as possible, and
going forward saw a great hole torn
out of the front of the boat from the
boiler room up to the pilot house. The
whole front of the cabin was a mass of
splinters.
Chief Engineer Henry had retired be
fore the disaster. He and his wife oc
cupied a stateroom under the pilot
house and were biown out of bed and
thrown some distance by the explosion.
The screams of the men who were
locked in their rooms near the pilot
house were heartrending. Captain John
Tulan had been blown from his bed
against the door of the state room, and
so seriously burned that he could not
move. The door could not be forced
open and he was jammed up against it.
One of the employes of the boat ob
tained an ax and cut the upper part
away. Although the captain was suf
fering as few people are called upon
to suffer, be bore it bravely and .not

CARING FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE EXPLOSION,
a groan escaped him after he was taken
out of the steam.
One of the remarkable escapes was
that of Captain Henry Potvine, who
was at the wheel of the Walker when
the explosion occurred. The pilot-house
was torn away, but he was not dan
gerously injured, although he is some
what scalded about the lower limbs.
When the survivors had all left the
Dauntless the colors were run to half
mast. Many business houses evinced
the public sorrow for the calamity by
doing likewise.
At 1 o'clock the "Walker was sighted,
towed by the Clara Crow. Shortly
afterward she was made fast at her
wharf. The lower deck forward was a
mass of wreckage; piles of bloody
sheets, bedding and pillows showed
how blood had flowed before Mrs. Rob
inson and her corps of volunteer nurses
bound up the wounds. Windows were
smashed and the space under the pilot
house was blown out as if by dyna
mite.
Manager Corcoran Is Indignant over
the claim that the boilers could not
carry 160 pounds of steam. He says
they would carry 300 pounds and that
any board would have made such an
authorization.
"It is one of those terrible calamities
which will happen. We do not know
jus=t how it happened and never will.
The boilers of the Walker were in
splendid condition," said Mr. Corcoran,
quietly. Not a nerve flinched as he
spoke and he watched the unloading
of the freight aa though nothing had
happened.
Herman Shafter, the cabin watch
nan on the Walker, said:
"I had just stepped out of the cabin
and was walking forward when the
boiler blew up. The electric lights were
going at the time, but everything was
dark in an instant. Hot steam was
pouring up from below. I did not know
for the moment what had happened. I
heard some one say, 'Hold this lady,'
and afterward I found that it was Mrs.
Henry, the wife of the engineer. She
was blown forward to the very bow of
the boat. When we went up to Henry's
room we found that it had been
wrecked. He was lying on the broken
timbers of the floor. His body was half
way through and was hanging across
one of the beams, which prevented him
falling."
In their once happy home the remains
of Henry and his wife lay to-night.
The survivors of the disaster cannot
say too much in praise of Mrs. Frances
Robinson of San Francisco and Mrs. C.
H Keagle, wife of C. H. Keagle of the
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of this
city. The wounded presented a shock
ing appearance, and their cries of an
guish were such as to unnerve some of
the men who heard them, but they did
not cow these brave women. Daniel W.
Webster of Vallejo and Dr. Davis of
Oakland were on the Dauntless and as
sisted in the removal of the wounded
and the dead from the Walker. Dr.
Davis says he never saw any person
use such good, practical and efficient
measures to help the wounded as did
Mrs. Robinson. The next best worker
in assisting the wounded, he says, was
Mrs. Keagle. The scenes were horri
ble. Many women fainted at the sight
and others were unable to assist from
terror. Charlotte P. Ebbets of 1401 Jones
street, San Francisco, helied the engi
neer's wife, Mrs. Henry, and did not
give up her post until Mrs. Henry had
been removed to her home to die.. Of
the work of Mrs. Robinson another pas
senger is quoted as saying:
"I found the forward part of the boat
below demolished, and "it was some time
before any of us could reach the lower
deck, as the stairs were gone. After a
little a ladder was brought and we went
down. Mrs. Robinson did not wait for
a ladder. When she knew what had
happened and heard the cries of the
scalded men she handed her two-year
old child to her husband and. went down
the dumb waiter shaft, out of which
the elevator was taken for the pur
pose. There were no surgical appli
ances onjjonrd, but she tore sheets into
bandages; saturated them with sweet
oil, of which there was plenty, covered
the scalded sufferers with flour and
soon had the wounded easier, though
many of them cried and moaned piti
fully all the way up. I never saw a
woman work so hard or so effectively
as that noble woman did."
Miss Anna M. Budlong, a teacher of
this city, was on the boat. She was so
greatly excited that as soon as she was
landed at the Union Transportation
Company's dock she started for home
on the run and did not stop running
until she was safe inside her gate.
Mr. Reaber is accustomed to engage
room 3 on the Walker when he makes
a trip. When he applied for this room
last evening he was disappointed to
find that it had been engaged. He was
told that it was occupied by three
young girls who were going to Antioch.
He contented himself with room 26.
Room 3 was nearly over the spot at
which the explosion occurred, and had
Mr. Reaber taken it he would have
been in the hospital now, if not at the
Morgue. As the girls landed at An
tioch the room was empty when the
explosion came.
M. L. Schiff, a San Francisco com
mercial traveler, was on the ill-fated
steamer. He occupied room 40. Tell
ing of his experience he said:
"I was aslee~ -vhen the explosion oc
curred. The concussion was so terrific
that it almost threw me out of my
berth. The lights all went out immedi
ately after the explosion, and it was
some time before I could collect my
senses and convince myself that we
were not goinr to the bottom of the
river. Mingled with the noise of es
caping steam could be heard the moans
of the wounded and the nervous
screaminer of women and children that
made one's blood creep with fear. It
was an experience I would not care to
go thro. Th again for a great deal of
money."
The hand of fate seems to have de
scended on the California Navigation
and Improvement Company. It had
$75,000 invested in the H. J. Corcoran,
and the vessel was a failure for the
purposes for which she was built. The
J. D. Peters sank se\ _ral weeks atro,

brought death and destruction.

damage suits against the company is
expected. The story of Professor York
that he heard steam escaping during
the night will be investigated.
In consequence of the disabling of
the Peters and the Walker the naviga
tion company has no boat to send to
San Francisco to-night on the sched
uled trip. At present it has but one
boat running â the Mary Garrett, which
left San Francisco at 6 o'clock this
evening for Stockton. It is said the
H. J. Corcoran, which has been laid up
for the winter, will be put on in- place
of the Walker within a day or two.
DOUBT AS TO
THE CAUSE
Officials Declare the Boilers
Were in Excellent
Condition.
Inquiry among the officers of the Cali
fornia Navigation and Improvement
Company in this city regarding the
cause of the disaster aboard the T. C.
Walker brought forth no definite infor
mation. Nothing had been learned by
them from Stockton. They professed to
be unable to advance even a theory.
Cantain C. D. Clarke, the company's
agent, said the machinery and boilers
of the luckless steamboat were in the
best of condition, the latter having un
dergone the official test before the Gov
ernment inspectors a few months aso.
Chief Engineer Barber of the Mary
Garrett made substantially the same
statement. .".'_â¢'
Engineer Henry was chief engineer
of the compar- and was only relieving
Charles Sampon, the regular engineer,
for this trip.
John K. Bulger, Assistant United
States Local Inspector of Boilers, said
the boilers of the T. C. Walker were
tested last April to a hydraulic pressure
of 250 pounds to the square inch, and
registered for a pressure of 170 pounds.
The boilers were made in 1893 and were
in excellent condition as was demon
strated by the careful test. Fifteen
years is a safe life for such class of
boilers, and those of the Walker had
never been subjected to great strain. In

HISTORY OF
THE WALKER
Was Built in 1885 for the
First Opposition
Line.
The steamer T. C. Walker was built
by her namesake. Captain T. C. Walker,
at Stockton, in I&SS, at a coat of $50,
000. She was 200 feet long, 38-foot beam
and carried four IS-foot boilers. She
had a boiler, main and hurricane, or
Texas, decks, with the staterooms built
into each. The steam drum, the blow
ing up of which caused the frightful
calamity of yesterday, was situated
under the dining saloon, forward state
rooms on the man and Texts decks and
the pilot house.
Captain Walker built the boat to run
in opposition to the old Stockton Steam
Navigation Company. He had pre
viously built the City of Stockton, in
1876, and the Mary Garrat, in 1877, and
to these boats he added the Walker.
He operated at a loss for three years,
when he sold out to his competitors.
The Navigation Company kept up the
line for three years longer, when a new
company was incorporatedâ the pres
ent. California Navigation and Im
provement Company â and the Walker
was turned over to them. She was laid
up for three years after the transfer,
and when again put Into service her
passenger and deck room had been ln
â¢,1 by one-third and numerous
other improvements made, which ma
terially added to her value. . Captain
Walker is of the opinion that she was
w.u-th as much at the time of the ex
plosion as on the day that he slid her
down the ways at Stockton for her first
trip to this city.
NOMINATIONS OF OFFICERS
PROMOTED FOR GALLANTRY
There Is a Prospect of a Renewal of
the Controversy Over the Merits
of Schley and Sampson.
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
President McKinley will send to the Ben
ate next week the nominations of a large'
number .of officers promoted for gallantry
dlsplayeaN^urinq; the war.
Among the nominations will be that of
Naval Constractor Hobson, who sank the
Merrimac in the mouth of the harbor of
Santiago. Just what reward will be given
him has not been determined, but it is
thuught in naval circles he will prefer
r to the line, though Chief Naval
Constructor Hichborn ha.Â« urgÂ«J that he
be promoted eight numbers irf the con
struction corps.
The nominations of Rear Admirals
Sampson and Schley will, it Is expected,
reopen the controversy regarding the re
spective merits of the two officers, and
fmm what friends of Rear Admiral Schley
say there is evidence that another effort
will be made to call up a resolution giv
ing him the thanks of Congress.

GREAT NORTHERN BUYS
WEST VIRGINIA COAL
Alarm at Pittsburg Over the Report
of the Placing of a Big
Contract.
PITTSBURG, Nov. 27.â The Dispatch to
morrow will say it has reliable authority
for stating that the Great Northern Rail
road Company has placed contracts with
West Virginia coal operators for 500,000
tons of coal at $1 23, delivered at San
dusky, the delivery to extend throughout
1899 Jfime? J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern, in reply to a telegram, says:
"This company does not publish its pur
chases of coal or other material."
It is generally believed here that the
contracts have been made arid the fact is
viewed with apprehension by the Pitts
burg operators, as it is evident that West
Virginia is usurping the trade hitherto
held by Pittsburg, by giving a rate ma
terially lower than the local operators
can. In fact, offers have been made by
West Virginia mine owners to Pittsburg
operators to furnish all the coal wanted
for $1 20 delivered at Sandusky. This is
made possible by a lower mining scale,
and better freight rates. The net cost
to a Plttsburg opf-rator under present
conditions for delivery at Sandusky is
?1 88%.

THREE NEGROES LYNCHED
BY A MOB OF FARMERS
An Assault Upon a White Man Causes Missis
sippians to Take Summary
Vengeance.
MERIDIAN, Miss., Nov. 27.â Reports have reached Here that
three negroes were lynched last night four miles west of Meridian.
New ton County farmers are said to be on the trail of others implicated
in an assault on a white man, who came to Meridian Friday from
Newton County, and was pursued and fired upon by the negroes.
A mob of armed farmers left for the scene, and while no definite news
had been received from him it is believed that they have summarily
dealt with the blacks.
Early to-day a frightened negro reported to the Sheriff that a mob
of white men was shootinjr into the negro houses and threatening to
kill every negro in the community. He said they fired over a hun
dred shots into the house of the ringleader of Friday's trouble. The
Sheriff organized a posse and started for the scene, but on arrival
could find no trace of the white men nor any corpses. However, the
three negroes concerned in the outrage had "disappeared," and it is
said the mob had taken them in charge.
ACTOR COULDOCK
OFF LIFE'S STAGE
Curtain Rings Down on

One Thousand
Times.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â Charles W.
Couldock, the actor, died to-night at
his home in this city after a short ill
ness, from dropsy. Mr. Couldock was
stricken on November 3 with -what was
thought to be indigestion, but after
ward diagnosed as dropsy. On Novem
ber 21 his condition became critical and
since then, even though he has had
several slight rallies, death ww ex
pected. His son, S. Y. Couldock, a
traveling salesman, survives him.
Charles W. Couldock was born on
April 26, 1815, at Long Acre, London.
He made his first appearance as an
actor at the age of 21, personating
Othello at a benefit performance at
Sadler Wells Theater, in London, for
which he purchased Â£10 worth of tick
ets to distribute among his friends. He
was billed as "Mr. Fortescue, his first
appearance," and was applauded rapt
urously by his clique. Afterward, de
siring to adopt the stage as a profes
sion, he, after a struggle, got into a
stock company at Farnham, Surrey.
After four months he left the troupe
and went with Jackman's company and
played leading parts. Subsequently he
joined the Shakespearian Club, which
gave performances at the St. James,
Drury Lane and other London theaters.
Couldock here essayed lago to Her
bert Gregory's Othello, Anthony to his
Shylock, and Hotspur to his Falstaff,
meeting with more or less success. In
1844 he joined the Edinburgh Theater
Company, the same year that Lester
Wallack and William Davige became
members of the organization. He played
a winter and summer season with this
company and then joined Professor
Anderson's forces at Glasgow. In two
weeks the theater was burned and he
secured the position of leading man at
the Royal Theater, playing first Sir
Giles Overreach. He remained with the
Royal four years, and during that time
acted with MacCready, Candenhoff,
Keane, Mme. VeÃtris, Charlotte Cush
man and others.
On September 15, 1849, Mr. Couldock
arrived in this city on the steamer
America, a member of Charlotte Cush
man's company, and opened at the old
Broadway 1 heater. He supported her
throughout the season in all the promi
nent cities of this country and when
Charlotte Cushman returned to Eu
rope he became leading man at the
Walnut-street Theater, Philadelphia.
Since then he has been prominently
identified with the American stage,
playing with Laura Keene, Jefferson,
Sothern and others. Mr. Couldock Is
best known as Dunston Kirke, in
"Hazel Kirke," which part he had
played over 1000 times.
CLARENCE KEY DIES
IN UTTER DESTITUTION
Sad Passing of a Grandson of the
Author of "The Star-Spangled
Banner."
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â An El Paso
(Texas) special to the Herald pays: The
report comes from the City of Mexico
that Clarence Key, a grandson of Fran
cis Scott Key, author of "The Star
spangled Banner," died there on Thanks
giving day, and that prior to his death
Key and his wife were in circumstances
of the utmost destitution.
Key had been in bad health for a year,
but managed to make a l.ving as a trans
later and teacher of Spanish and Eng
lish. About ten days previous to his death
he fell while walking along the street and
sustained injuries which subsequently re
sulted fatally. After the accident he
could no longer earn his living and was
too proud to ask aid from members of the
American colony. A hotel man seized his
baggage for debt, and the sick man and
his wife were about to be turned into the
street when American residents learned
of their condition and contributed suf
ficient money to provide the necessities
for Key and hts wife. The best physi
cian was procured, but he could do noth
ing for Key, and he died three days later.

THE CHARITY BAZAAR
WILL BE A SUCCESS
MANY DONATIONS RECEIVED
FOB GALLANT FIREMEN.
General Interest Being Manifested in
the Noble Project â A Merry-
Christmas for the
Poor.
General enthusiasm Is manifested in the
coming benefit to be given at the Pavil
ion December 1 to the firemen of the clty
as a public testimonial of appreciation for
their indefatigable and almost marvelous
work of subduing: the recent Baldwin
fire and preventing a general conflagra
tion in that section of the city.
The project is the outcome of a deter
mination which was formed by the man
agers of the coming charity bazaar and
California grand musical contest, which
is to be held at the Pavilion during the
month of December In aid of the needy
poor of the city. Immediately after the
Baldwin fire it was decided to set aside
and devot* the proceeds of the first night
to the men who risked their lives In the
performance of their duties.
A letter was sent to Chief Engineer Sul
livan of the Fire Department notifying
him of this intention and requesting his
sanction of it. The reply was one of
full acceptance. In it gratitude was ex
tended to those interested in the coming
bazaar and a hope for its success ex
tended to Captain de St. 1-Ã¼bert, its'orig
inator and manager.
Those who visit the Pavilion on the
evening of December 1 will do so with
the knowledge that they are paying the
price of admission for a worthy object.
Already a large sale of tickets has been
made and the demand is increasing daily.
Many people who knew the risk the fire
men took to insure the safety of the city
have sent checks ranging in value from
$5 to $25 as evidences of appreciation of
the work of the firemen and as an en
couragement for the promoters of the
coming benefit.
Aside from the benefit for the firemen
the object of the bazaar, which is to ex
tend almost into the month of January.
Is a worthy one. It is the intention of
those In charge to raise sufficient money
to make the approaching Christmas day
a memorable one to the poor of San Fran
cisco. The money received nightly will
be turned over on the following morning
to the nineteen or more charitable insti
tutions, the members of which are to
distribute it among the needy and the
deserving.
Letters of congratulation an<* â¢indorse
ment of the noble work have been and
are heing received daily at the head
quarters of the bazaar from well known
and influential people all over the city
and State. The one of most interest and
the one that will do more to bring the
general public to a fuller realization of
the charitable importance of the under
taking is the following, signed by Gov
ernor-elect Henry T. Gage and Mrs. Fan
nie V. Gage:
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22, 1898.
Captain J. Charles de St. Hubertâ Dear Sir:
Tour favor of November 12 just received. In
reply will state that we have always been In
favor of every plan for the amelioration of the
conditions of the poor, and believe that your
Charity Bazaar Is prompted by right motives
In that direction. Yours very truly,

MADRID, Nov. 27.â The Cabinet has
agreed upon the instructions to Senor
Rios, president -* â¦*â¢Â«> Spanish Peace
Commisisort*, for to-morrow's joint ses
sion at Paris, at which the treaty will
be signed.
El Imparcial exhorts the Government

America offers and to protest against
America's appeal to force with respect
to the Philippines.
El Correo denies the reports that an
insurrection has broken out in the Sulu
Islands.
A red book, dealing with the peace
negotiations, is being prepared.
There is a good deal of comment upon
a dispatch from Gibraltar announcing
the arrival there during this month of
180 new model cannon.
PARIS, Nov. 27.â Senor Montero
Rios, president of the Spanish Peace
Commission, is this evening waiting
for the reply from the Spanish Govern
ment, and unless there is some change
in the situation before noon to-morrow
the reply will be an acceptance, under
protest, of the American offer of $20,
000,000 for the Philippines.
Even up to a late hour this evening
telegrams have been exchanged be
tween the Spanish Commissioners and
Madrid; but the Americans, who are in
a position- to speak with authority, are
convinced that the foregoing outlines
the Spanish reply.
Senor Abarzuza expressed the opin
ion this evening that there would be no
break in the work of the commissions.
Marquis de Comillas, who is the
largest individual creditor of Spain, and
has been here from the outset in behalf
of numerous important enterprises, of
which he is the head, also indicated this
evening that Spain /had made up her
mind to yield. He is in very close touch
with the Spanish Commissioners.
â â Nothing that we have done here,"
said the Marquis, '"has made any im
pression upon the minds of the Ameri
can Commissioners. From the very first
their intention was to take the Philip
pines and they have never wavered."
There is no truth in the report cabled
here from Washington that in the last
American memorandum a demand for
the Sulu group had been added to the
previous American demands. The orig
inal' American claim was upon the ter
ritory within lines longitudinally and
latitudinally defined. It embraced the
so-called Sulu group. There has been
no change since the first demand, and,
according to the statement of one of the
American Commissioners, there will be
no modification of it.
SPAIN'S CABINET
YIELDS ON ALL POINTS
LONDON, Nov. 28.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standard says: The
Cabinet has concluded that the wisest
policy is to accept the American terms,
leaving to the Spanish Commissioners
full power to secure the best possible
indemnity and to place on record, if
the American Commissioners will per
mit, a protest against the American in
terpretation of the . protocol affecting
â¢the Philippines and against the pro
ceedings generally. The decision of the
Cabniet is approved in political and
financial circles. I understand, how
ever, that the deliberations of the Min
isters were very protracted. Senor Sa
gasta, Duke Almodovar del Rio and
Senor Puigceiver had great difficulty in
inducing some of their colleagues to- ac
cept the small indemnity. Undoubtedly
the situation is hard and critical, but
ministers say SenOr Sagasta is deter
mined to confront all opposition until
the Cortes is convoked, probably at ttie
end of December, when he will demand
a vote of confidence, virtually implying
approval of the treaty and the con
servation of his party.
The Paris correspondent of the Times
says: It may be regarded that Spain
will accept th"e~"American conditions and
sign the treaty, perhaps even without
a protest. Thus her colonial empire
will disappear forever, and the day is
not far distant when the patrimony of
the United States, accruing to them un
der prosperity from exploiting the
islands, and with good administration,
will have increased to four fold the
sum total of the terrible war indemnity
France paid Germany.
GRIGGS UPHOLDS THE
"OPEN-DOOR" POLICY
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Ter
ritorial possessions can be held by the
United States and can be treated as
foreign territory as far as the revenue
laws of the country are concerned.
This In effect is the position taken by
Attorney General Griggs In an opinion
which he rendered in regard to the
question of enforcement of the United
States navigation laws in Hawaii. This
opinion Is of particular importance at
this time on account of the important
bearing it has upon the proposition to
carry out the "open door" policy in
dealing with the new insular PdWeÃ
sions in the Orient. In this opLaion the
Attorney General said:
"The resolution of Congress which
with the corresponding action of the
republic of the United States operated
for international purposes to make
those islands part of the territory of
the United States. But when territory
is acquired by treaty or conquest or
otherwise its relations to the nation ac
quiring it depend upon the laws of that
nation unless controlled by the instru
ment of cession. It may for certain
purposes remain foreign territory tem
porarily or permanently and is not pre
sumed to be at once put upon the same
footing as all other, but rather the con
trary. When therfore Florida had been
ceded and fully transferred to the
United States its ports were regarded
as foreign within the meaning of our
revenue laws."
The Attorney General also indicates
that the position of the administration
in adopting the "open door" policy
would be much strengthened if it
should be provided for In the treaty of
peace, as he says in his opinion, that
when territory is acquired its relations
to the nation acquiring it depend upon
the laws of that nation unless con
rolled by the instrument of cession.
PRESIDENT SATISFIED
WITH THE CONCLUSION
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.âThrough
out the peace negotiations which are
still pending in Paris the President- has
expressed confidence that a treaty sat
isfactory to the United States would be
drafted and signed. From time to
time assurances of substantial progress
toward that end have been received by
the President from Mr. Day, president
of the American Commission, reiterat
ing the assurance he had previously
j given the President of the early and
! successful conclusion of the work of
! the commission. Judge Day, it is un
; derstood, states positively that the
Spanish Commissioners formally wjll
\ accept perhaps to-morrow the terms of
the United States, and that a treaty
drawn along the lines of the agreement
! reached will be drawn and signed In a
few days. 5 r y: ' â¢ rv;:.:
The dispatch from Judge Day was the
! first absolutely definite statement as to
the conclusion of the labors of the com
mission that has been received, and
quite naturally it afforded the Presi
dent and his advisors considerable sat
lsffiction. ' â â¢" '-'â  ' ' ' "
It is probable that the President will
discuss in his message to ..Congress,
which will be delivered one week from
to-morrow, the successful efforts of the
administration in the negotiation of a
peace treaty, althouerh there is a possi
bility that the treaty itself may not
have been signed at the time.
INDICATIONS OF A
DECLINE IN WHEAT
SHORTS ARE FILLED AND THE
DROP HAS STARTED.
Bulls Forced the Barley Market Up
and Then Try to Unload
on the Quiet
What promised to be a strong wheat
market early In the week flattened out
to one of extreme, weakness, chiefly
caused by long holders of early options
becoming discouraged and throwing
their holdings overboard. Foreigners
throughout the week were disposed to
buy best wheat in large quantities, ex
porters reporting upward of a million
bushels worked each day. A good sized
short interest had credit into December,
resulting in advancing the price to 68%
cents before the hungry sharks were
filled up. When this was accomplished
the urgent demand was taken out of the
market, which was a signal for the start
ing of liquidation which carried Decem
ber to 65% and May to 65% at the close
on Saturday, with Indications of a still
further decline this week. The general
influences during the past week were
rath* inclined to more favorable prices,
except news from Argentina, which
places the exportable surplus from this
country at 35.CHXl.0iX). One report makes
this figure too small by 10.000.000 bushels.
For some time to come Argentina crop
conditions will furnish the guide to
American wheat prices. Later on. possi
bly in January, home conditions. Severe
cold weather will, as it always does,
cause apprehension regarding the winter
crops. At the present moment there
seems but little to encourage higher
prices. Farmers may hold back their
holdings, but it is more than likely they
Will begin to market them before May
comes around.
Country millers are showing less anx
iety for stocks, indicating -their storage
capacity is comfortably filled. From
the present time on American wheat
prices will be controlled by the demand
from abroad. The home demand MOBI
pretty fairly eliminated from the market.
Too much SbOTt selling by daring bears
will at times give the market a congested
condition, resulting in a fair sized rally,
but should not be accepted as a fore
runner of permanent advancing prices.
At present values there Is a fair return
to producers. Corners do not come every
year, and would be more benefit to pro
ducers if they never appeared, as false
ideas are their result, and it takes timo
and money to brush them from the mind.
Corn has shown considerable strength
and may do better after liquidation in De
cember is over. It Is generally accepted
that the present crop Is much smaller
than the Government figures.
Wheat in the local market appears to
be going through a case of liquidation
which may carry prices lower.
December barley tried hard to stay at
$1 30, but too many wanted to get out
around these prices, and ac a result not
much trading was done at or above $1 30.
The bulls, who have so far handled the
market with fairly successful results,
were on Saturday peeping through the
cracks to ascertain if they could unload
on the quiet. The chief factors were mak
ing it appear that they were standing
under the market, whereas they had
broken, selling regardless. Undoubtedly
some few stanch friends of money cereal
will accept delivery, which at present ap
pears of the white elephant order, but
the greater portion of the longs do not
want a pound of the real stuff. The ques
tion arises, who will hold the bag after
December 1? I believe the price will go
much lower. R. E. MULCAHY.

THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM
THE PACIFIC BANK VAULTS
The History of a Pledge of Property That Was Never Given
to the Deluded and Dishonest Young
Â« Financiers.
The Wily Schemer of Los Angeles forced From the McDonalds a
Fortune and Was Then Protected From Restitution by
His Relative, J. E. Farnum.
, In .".its expose of theÂ»secret history of
the Pacific Bank and the People's
Home Savings Bank The Call has ex
plolted many outrageous robberies and
ifhameless conspiracies. This morning
P-h & Call will show h<>\v one of the great
conspirators deliberatefly robbed the
Pacific Bank of $50,000. This robbery
was committed in the latter part of
1892, and. it still has* the indorsement of
; techni.at legality. -The people of San
â¢ .Francisco are now familiar with the
fact that late in 1592 and early in 1893
\ the. bank wreckers, were assembled in
. >Je\.v â  York, City. Affairs had reached
such a crisis ..that it was absolutely ne
ceFFary for; .the McDonalds to obtain
money! Dick McDonald, as The Call
â¢ Ihas already described, was left in this
I city to fight": the battle alone. His
I father, his brother and his confederates
fin crime were in New York. They
pleaded and threatened the banker in
this city %vith the single purpose of pre
yentiner him from taking the desperate
measures that his desperate condition
demandpdJ ' .'â  '.- 'J'~S?&
The letters, of these men show that
they understood, thoroughly the fact
that the banks must go down. They
had already received individually and
collectively hundreds of thousands of
dollars from ' the bank, but they were
not satisfied, and realizing that the
final collapse, WSUJ inevitable they deter
mined to secure rriore money. They pre-
tended, as The CalT has shown conclu-
y. to have hopes of relief which
1 they never expected to realize. Under
â the mask of assumed assistance they
planned to secure more funds. Like
vultures they realized the approaching
dissolution of the bank and they sought
to secure their final feast on the body
of the institution. The leader and the
craftiest of these schemers was Moses
H. Sherman. His tremendous schemes
in reference to Phoenix properties had
become by this time little more than a
bagatelle. Over two hundred thousand
dollars had been sunk by the Pacific
Bank and th*> People's Home Savings
Bank in these dishonest ventures, but
this enormous sum of money was very
little compared to thÂ»> amount that had
' been sunk in th^ Los Angeles electric
r r&ilro;id deal. The McDonalds had
staked their bank on the success of this
deal, and Sherman kn-w that his dupes
at that stage of the game could not re-
tire. He planned, therefore, to get more
money from . them under the guisp r>f
assisting the railroad in which they
'were most intimately concerned. He
â¢wrote false promises and dishonest as-
surances. He declared with every pos-
sible insincerity that the bonds of the
electric railroad were to be floated here
and there and that the McDonalds
â¢would Ret the money they had so fool
ishly squandered.
Sherman understood perfectly the ef
fect of his own imposition. He gave his
lying promies that he might secure
money for himself. Time after
"time he wrote his alluring letters and
traveled from city to city to deceive
his dupes with the idea that he was
honestly working in their service. He
'professed the greatest possible concern
over th^ affairs of the. Pacific Bank and
asked his victims to believe that he was
as deeply Interested as they. He was
â simply scheming to secure more money
. 'â¢:.-. -stird literally to loot the Pacific Bank
In its declining days.
As already described in The Call a
majority of the conspirators were in
Xew York. They were spending hun
dreds of dollars every month simply to
create & false impression of energy in
behalf of McDonald. Sherman de
scribed his visit to this and that city,
and iJ* fi(s ow n hysterical,, eccentric
fashion exalted Dick McDonald to an
opinion that everything would come
out well in the end. Sherman had no
thought that this would be the case,
and Stave- his., lying promises simply to
filch: mhre. tn.oney .froni the banks. In
I). 'â rprtipz'r 0f 189.2 he went to Frank M<
booa,id and: told him that the Los An
geles Electri- Railroad Company was
in absolute .ftcamMaj distress. More
money, he said, .was needed, and if it
were not supplied the road must fail.
Sherman misrepresented the condition
..of. the road, and declared that it was
daily lofii.hÃ a great deal of money.
He assured Fran McDonal n that lm
jkniediate assistance must be given or the
.-oad w:ould go under and in its
collapse the Pacific Bank would lose
the enormous sum ..of money that it
had already advanced. Sherman had
then begun his final. manipulations that
to end only in the destruction of
! d McDonald banks. He had already
'' won an enormous fortune, but with the
treed that marked his efforts he
wanted more. He knew that the lie-
Donalds did not dare sacrifice their in
tf.rept? in the Los Angeles Electric
Railroad Company. While they were
cryinc: frantically for some tangible
return on their Investment, Sherman
was plotting to throw them deeper Into
the scheme.
He went to McDonald and assured
him that it was absolutely necessary
f..r the bank to give up fifty thousand
dollars more. Frank McDonald pleaded
and begged for mercy, but Sherman
was inflexible, and said if the money
was not forthcoming the McDonalds
would have to abide by the result. At
that time it was absolutely Impossible
for the McDonalds to take any more
money out of their banks. The funds
were not there. The Bank Commission
ers for a variety of reasons were in
sisting upon immediate rehabilitation
of th~ bank. Frank McDonald explain
ed this condition of affairs to Sherman,
who understood it as thoroughly as the
bankers themselves, but the unscrupu
lous Los Angeles manipulator demand
ed the mnnev and suggested a scheme
by which it could be obtained.
It should be remembered that at that
time the Pacific Bank was considered
to be one of the safest and most con
servative banks on the Pacific Coast.
The true condition of its affairs was
not known to the -uiblic. and any of its
guarantees or promises to pay was ac
cepted absolutely without comment
and with perfect confidence. The cer
tificates of the bank were accepted by
the general financial public as if they
w e the contracts of the National Gov
ernment Itself. No one, except those of
the little cotorie of conspirators, knew
how rapidly the Pacific Bank was then
ncaring the dishonorable close of Its
existence. Sherman suggested, there
fore, to Frank V. McDonald that th 2
Pacific Bank issue fifty thousand dol
lars in coupon certificates.
This paper, the wily manipulator of
Los Angeles assured Frank, could be
hypothecated as readily as if it rep
resented the currency of th< Govern
ment. Sherman told his dupe that he
could hypothecate the paper, secure the
fifty thousand dollars, or very near
that sum, and nlace the money to the
credit of the Los Angeles Electric Rail
road and use it for the necessities of that
road. Frank McDonald, as already de
scribed, pleaded for mercy, but Sher
man was uncompromising, and de
clared that the very existence of the
bank depended on this mnnev.
It should not be forgotten that cou
pon certificates of the Pacific Bank
were at that time as good as gold. Af
ter Sherman had concluded his argu
ment, his hysterical pleadings and his
throats, Frank McDonald decided to
issue coupon certificates of the Pacific
Bank to the extent of $f.0,000. Even
such a fool as Frank McDonald did
not dare make this transaction any
thing but ostensibly legal. He knew
that if there were the slightest flaw jii
the transaction it would be vitiated and
destroyed in the courts.
He was forced, therefore to give
| some security for the $50,000 that Frank
McDonald decided to give up. This se
curity was given in the shape of pledges
on some of the Phoenix property of
Moses H. Sherman. This property is
not even now worth one-third of what
Sherman claimed it to be. The wily
schemer from Los Angeles, however,
determined not even to give up this
property in consideration of the enor
mous sum of money he was to receive
from the Pacific Bank. It was impos-
I sible for Sherman and his dupe to con
i summate this transaction aboveboard.
j Sh'-rman's relations with the Pacific
j Bank at that time were very well
I known.
Public comment would have been
created if the schemer had received this
money in the ordinary routine of finan
cial transactions. He was forced, there
fore, to resort to new financial trickery,
and another officer of the bank, who
was then in New York, was pressed
into service. Frank McDonald issued
the coupon certificates of the Pacific
Bank to the amount of $50,000. These
certificates were signed by Dr. R. H.
McDonald as president of the bank and
by Frank V. McDonald as cashier. As
soon as these signatures were obtained
the certificates were as good as cur
rency. When the deluded and dis
honest bankers placed their names upon
these certificates Moses H. Sherman
had received $50,000 from the bank he
had already ruined.
The certificates were placed in the
financial market and as the credit of
the Pacific Bank was then good the
paper passed practically with the same
validity as currency.
Sherman was compelled, however, to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1898.
give some ostensible security. In con
sideration of the receipt of these cer
tificates he pledged to the Pacific Bank
certain property that he possessed in
Phoentx, Ariz. This property at the
very outside estimate was not worth
more than $6000. When the coupon cer
tificates of the Pacific Bank were issued
to Sherman he wrote an agreement in
which he promised to deed to a certain
officer of the bank this Phoenix prop
erty. This agreement was duly ac
knowledged and the coupon certificates
were issued. According to the terms
of the dishonest transaction the officer
of the bank who had been pressed into
service agreed to transfer to the Pacific
Bank the property which was to be
deeded to him.
As already described Sherman had
obtained the coupon certificates of the-
Pacific Bank to the amount of $50,000.
His agreement to deed his property was
sent to this city from New York and
was placed in the vaults of the Pacific-
Bank. Sherman came to this city and
hypothecated the certificates. He had
placed upon these documents his own
indorsement, which made him person
ally responsible for the money if the
bank could not pay. In his craft he
recognized that this indorsement was
most dangerous to himself, but he was
forced to sign his name in brder to re
ceive the money. After he came to San
Francisco he had a consultation with
Dick McDonald and took the first steps
in his scheme to recover this agreement.
He had hypothecated the certificates.
He was determined to recover his
agreement. He was then very closely
in touch with at least two members of
the Bank Commission. He told Dick
McDonald that the Commissioners were,
threatening, with increasing insistence,
to decend upon the bank and close its
doors. He promised Dick that he would
protect the bank if he received back
his agreement to deed over his Phoenix
property to the institution. Dick Mc-
Donald became frightened and gave
up the agreement.
It is perhaps fortunate for the de
positors and creditors of the Pacific
Bank that a certified copy of this agree
ment is still In existence. Sherman
never deeded this property to the Pa
clfic^ Bank or to the officer who had
been pressed into service. Before it was
necessary to make this transfer the
agreement was obtained by Bherman
from Dick McDonald. The coupon cer
tificates therefore were given abso
lutely without < ompensation from Sher
man. He received $50,000 and in ex
chnnge gave nothing.
This transaction has been unknown
to the people of this city for nearly six
years and it is perhaps one of the most
outrageous deals in which Mo-ses IT.
Sherman was involved. After it was
over and Sherman had obtained the
money the coupon certificates still re
mained as a menace to the Los Angela
schf mer. As already described his in
dorsement and personal guarantee to
pay was upon each certificate, and as
Jong as he possessed a dollar that might
be levied upon he was personally re
sponsible. The failure of the bank
made this responsibility absolute, and
Sherman plotted after the failure of ihe
bank to control the liquidation of the
institution. He was still closely in
touch with the Bank Commissioners.
The coupon certificates were held by
outside people, who at any moment
could hold Sherman responsible for the
poyi.ient of them.
In order to evade the satisfaction of
this just obligation Sherman planned
to control the closing of the bank. X
should be remembered In connection
with this outrageous transaction that
th? Pacitic Bank had issued to its de
positors certificates representing the
amount of each deposit. Th^se certifi
cates, after the failure of the bank, be
came acknowledged claims against
â whatever assets might be collected.
Each depositor, at the request o-f the
bank authorities, had surrendered iiis
book and received his certificate. In
the liquidation of the bank these cer
tificates were recognized as already de
scribed as unquestionable claims. On
the other hand the coupon certificates
issued to Sherman were taken for what
they were worth. They did not hold the
same relation to the bank as did the
regular certificates issued to depositors.
If the coupon certificates could not be
paid by the Pacific Bank Sherman
would have to satisfy each obligation.
As a matter of course he determined not
to do so, and In order that he would not
be compelled to repay this money he
plotted to manipulate the liquidation of
the bank.
The Call has already described how
he placed his relative, John E. Farnum,
In the Pacific Bank. Farnum was there
to protect the interests of Sherman,
and one of his duties in this connec
tion was to call in every coupon cer
tificate bearing the name of Moses H.
Sherman and reissue the certificates of
the bank that had been given to bona
fide depositors. In this way Sherman's
r.-bligation was erased from the records
of the bank and from the coupon cer
tificates. Farnum pledged the bank to
pay what Sherman owed. The great
schemer of Los Angeles thug secured at
one touch of the pen $50,000 more from
the vaults of the Pacific Bank.
After the Pacific Bank closed Sher
man perfected another gigantic deal.
He had in the bank his personal note
for $49,000. This note, in conjunction
with Frank V. McDonald, he had
signed, and necessarily was responsible
for its payment. He had received the
money that the face of the note repre
sented. Frank McDonald had signed
his name to the document as a matter
of absurd friendship for Sherman. It
was this fact that saved Sherman from
the obligation. He pointed out to Dick
McDonald the danger of allowing offi
cial investigators or the public to know
that Frank McDonald, an officer of the
bank, had signed such a nr.-te. It was
unwise, Sherman declared, to have such
a note in existence, and Dick McDon
ald, deluded by the representations of
this schemer, returned the note to him,
and all trace of another gigantic deal
was blotted out of the records of the
Pat -fie Bank. In this way Moses H.
Sherman operated in the ruins of the
institution he had destroyed. He be
came almost literally a tlnancial scav
enger.
The Call will show to-morrow morn- i
ing how he effected another deal of j
$60,000 and won the money by satisfying j
his confederates that he had bought the
honor of the City Council of Los An- â 
geles.

SAURIES OF

ALMOST HALF
Many Dismissed at
San Jose.
REA'S BOARD USES THE AX
COST OF CORRUPT RULE IN
THE SCHOOLS.
Having Squandered the People's
Money It Is Found Necessary
to Dispense With a Num
ber of Instructors.
Si*cial Difspatrh to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 27.â The corruption
of San Jose's School Board has culmi- i
nated in serious financial injury to the â â 
teachers and in their consequent gen
eral demoralization. The board became
so deeply indebted that it was almost
impossible to carry on the schools, and, !
as was predicted in The Call a month
ago, the Trustees last .night abolished
th'- kindergarten system and cut the ,
salaries of all teachers about one-third.
This action was taken at a star cham
ber session of the board. So afraid were i
the members that some one would be i
present and see them wield the ax that
they held the meeting at Trustee Lang- '
ford's house. Besides the members not I
a person except, probably, Rea and the I
Mackenzies knew such action was to be '
taken.
There were present Trustees Graham,
Kenyon, Wemple, O'Neil and Langford.
The business had been previously ar
ranged, and they at once settled down
to work.
The kindergarten system was abol
ished, thus dispensing with the super
visor of kindergartens, sixteen teach
ers and six janitors, effecting a saving
of $1295 a month.
Special teachers of physical culture,
music and drawing were dismissed,
which saves $185 a month.
In the High School the biggest reduc
l tion was made and salaries were cut
| almost in half, saving the department
$465 a month.
The ax was then used on the salaries
of teachers in the grammar grades.
Forty-nine teachers were reduced from
,as high as $78 to $70 a month. This will
save $G43.
! The salaries of janitors were made $65 I
i a month, reducing them over one-third. !
The action of the board reduces the l
running expenses of the City Board of i
Education $2398 a month, or $23,980 for ;
I the school year of ten months. There
! was but half enough money nn hand at i
j the beginning of the year to conduct \
| the schools, yet the Board of Educa- I
i tion conducted things in the same old i
1 extravagant way. It created the posi
; tion of supervisor of kindergartens for
Miss Belle Mackenzie, sister of "Boss"
Rea's lieutenant, at a salary of $75 a
month. There was no need of such of
fice, and it was simply a sinecure. As I
the schools were being run there would
have been an indebtedness at the end '
of the year of about 535,000, and the big j
cut made last night will not keep down !
a deficiency. The Board of Education |
knew months ago it would have to take j
the action it did, but it was postponed j
until after election In order to keep the i
teachers and their friends in line for |
the "gang," and thus secure votes.
Trustees Graham. Kenyon and Lang
ford have been most active In ruthless
ly expending the people's money, and
the former reluctantly voted for the j
curtailment. O'Neil and Wemple have
tried to check the raid on the city
treasury, but unsuccessfully. During
the past year the schools have been al
most wrecked. Politics caused a strike
in the High School, and about 150 of the
clty"s pupils go to Santa Clara High
School, and in the grammar schools
and kindergartens there has been
trouble. The people have been aroused,
and the three officials who take Rea's
word as law have been strongly con
demned and the citizens have heen on
the verge of asking them to resign.
The reduction of salaries goes Into
effect on December 15.

Americans Emboldened by the Suc

Obtaining a Large
Award.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B, C, Nov. 27.â 1t was |
learned to-day that, emboldened by the
success of Victoria sealers who were
awarded $425,000 a short time ago by
the American Government on account
of Bering Sea seizures, v number of
American sealing men â owners, cap
tains and huntersâ are now preparing
claims for submission to the Washing
ton authorities, demanding many
thousands In payment for the losses |
incurred by them in consequence of the
seizure of their vessels in the Bering
Sea. As all know the statutes of the
United States in the years of the seiz
ures, most of which occurred in 1887,
prohibited pelagic sealing in the waters
of Alaska. In consequence of this law
many American schooners changed
their register and sailed as British ves
sels, which were without the jurisdic
tion of the United States laws, hence
the awards made to them in compensa
tion for their seizures.
Among those, however, who contin
ued to hunt under the Stars and
Stripes.notwithstanding the prohibitory
statutes, was a fleet of San Francisco j
and Puget Sound schooners. Of these
a number were seized by the patrolling
fleet of revenue cutters.
Among them was the schooner Ethel,
on account of whose seizure in IS9I the
Government of the United States will i
soon be asked to pay $20,000. Her cap- !
tain and owner. I'hll Moore, left here ;
for San Francisco ab<mt four days ago, |
where he will complete the preparation
of the claims of that schooner.
Another claim being prepared here
is that of the Lily Ladd, a San Fran
cisco schooner. Captain Todd, who was
master of her when she was seized in
1887 and who is now on the Victoria
schooner Enterprise, is preparing the
claims of those connected with that |
vessel. He will leave for San Francisco
in a few days.
Claims are being prepared for the
San Francisco schooner Louise. Sev
eral other claims for the seizure of San
Francisco vessels and the losses in
curred by those aboard them are be
ing prepared. There are, too, a num
ber of Seattle men here, preparing
clams for the Feizure of the Kate and
Anna, the Allie I. Alger and other ves
sels which during the heyday of seal
ing sailed from the Sound. #
The Americans are not alone in the
preparation of claims for compensa
i tion. for a number of claims are in
course of preparation askinp Russia to
pay large sums to compensate the own
ers of vessels seized off the Copper Isl
ands, and the men belonging to them
; who were imprisoned at Petropaulov
ski. In all six vessels were seized.
Twoâ the Willie McGowan and Arielâ
and those connected with them have
been recompensed already. The other
vessels seized by the Russian cruisers
in that year were the Carmelite, Rosie
Olsen Vancouver Beile and Maria.
They were all seized about thirty
miles from the islands and their mas
tfrs and crews were thrown into prison
pt Fetropaulovpki. where they were,
shamefully mistreated. They were ul- J
tlmately released and sent home in the j
Rosie Olsen. The other vessels are
still lying at Petropaulovski.
Besides these about twenty-five
hunters are preparing claims for com
pensation on account of imprisonment.
They were captured in their small
boats by Russian cruisers and thrown
Into prison with the others whose
schooners were seized.

Chusan Islands Net Seized.
SHANGHAI. Nov. 27.-The report re
ceived here â¢ yesterday that the British
admiral had hoisted the I'nion Jack over
TinK-Hai capital of the island of Chusan,
and over several islands in the Chusan
archipelago, is not credited. The British
Consulate has had no confirmation ot ti;e
rumor which probably originated in mis

A FELON HAS EIGHTS.
A Peculiar xirial in a Southern Cali-
fornia Criminal Court.
The Justices of the Supreme.Court have '
made an important decisipn. It Is in ef
fect, that while a case is being tried the
Judge before whom the cause is being
heard must atter.d to his duties and hear ;
what both sides have to say. This may :
seem a peculiar ruling, but the matter ;
which gave rise to it is more surprising.
In Los Angeles County C. L. Tupper â 
was on trial for a serious crime, a felony
that would open the gates of San Quentin
to him. It looked as though it was a case
of striped garments for him. and much
evidence was presented. After a while
the Judge became weary and took a re
cess all by himself. It was not stated
whether he went out to get a drink or a
dinner, or what, but he was gone for
nearly half an hour and the case went
along just 'he same. Tupper was con
victed and sentenced by the Judge when
he came back, but Tupper did not lik>'
the way it wps done, neither did his at
torney, nor the Justices of the Supreme
Court. The latter in sending the case
bade for a retrial says:
"There can be no court without a Judge,
and all that was done in the absence of
the Judge was in fact done in the ab- '
sence of the court. A defendant convicted !
under such circumstances has been de
priVed of his liberty without due pro
cesa of law."
The judgment an^i order of the lower j
court waa reversed and a new trial of the
case was ordered.

WARFARE ON THE
LIQUOR TRAFFIC
The Young Temperance
People Organize,
ONE MILLION CLUB rORMED
ITS OBJECT TO CLOSE SALOONS
THROUGH BALLOT-BOX.
By Securing the Pledge of Voters thÂ«
Organizers Hope to Force Na- .
tional Parties to Take
Action. : â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. 27.â Christian Temper
ance young people all over the United
States are preparing for the formation of
an organization to be known as the. One
Million Club, which will wage relentless
warfare against the liquor traffic,. us. ng as
a. weapon the ballot-box. Chicago will be .
the headquarter!? of the new organization,
and from this city It has already received
a strong impetus.
The One Million Club will differ from
the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.,
in that its energies will be entirely dl
rected toward the election of officials and
tickets pledged to work for the suppres
sion of the saloon. While not exactly on
the plan of the Prohibition party, the
One Million Club has for Its object the
same aims as the Prohibitionists.
It is not the intention of the young 1
people to put a ticket in the political Held,
but to indorse tickets which contain a
plank in the platform pledging a war
against liquor. The members will all be
pledged to vote for the ticket selected re
gardless of political belief.
Mips Eva M. Shontz. president of the
Chicago Young People's Christian Tem
perance Union, is interested in the forma
tion of the new club. She said to-day:
"Before the national conventions of 19*10
we hope to have 1.ui0.000 voters pledged
to use suffrage against the liquor tranic,
and from this it takes its name. An effort
will be made to induce one or two great
political parties to include in the platform
a ifmperance plank. In the event q,f suc
(â¢â¢â ss in this direction one of these parties
wili !><â  indorsed.
"Otherwise the regular Prohibition party
will receive the votes of the members of
the organization. If we can succeed in set
ting 1.ii00.000 voters pledged to help us in
this fight we feel our strength could be
so great that both Republicans and Dem
ocrats would be anxious for our indorse
ment." , Â.
Steps are being taken toward calling
delegates to a meeting at which all States
will he represented in this city in Janu
ary in order to perfect the organization
already begun through the medium of
correspondence.

THE STfITE OF BUSINESS.
THE past week in trade was dull. In the East
cold weather and storms interfered with business,
though the bank clearings were 25.6 per cent
larger than for the same week in 1897. Here there
were no norms, but business was quiet, nevertheless.
But it is seldom that there is any activity in trade
during the two closing months of the year. All the
wimer buying has been done by the middle of No
vember, and the spring demand does not set in until
g in February, and in the meantime there is very
little going on. except- among the retailers, who are
kept busy by the holiday demand.
Trade reports from the East last week were meager,
and contained little of interest and nothing new. The
recent reduction in some kinds of cotton goods re
sulted in rather more liberal buying, but the move
ment is slow at bet. The opinion is that cotton has
?een its lowest point, and it is to be hoped that it is
correct, for this great industry, which is the life of the
Southern part of the country, has been paralyzed for
months; There have been free sales of wool, but at
concessions, and there are still large stocks left on
hand to be got rid oi before any marked activity in
business can take place. The iron and steel trade
keeps up its brilliant reco.rd.-and although the demand
is not as sharp as some time ago. it is still large
enough to' be classed as "enormmis" by the men who
are engaged in it. An unusually good demand for
export is anticipated for next year. The exports of
wheat and corn from Atlantic ports continue larger
than. for the same time last year, and prices have gen
erally been maintained. The failures for the week
were Â»88, against 236 for the same week in 1897. The
hide and leather markets show more firmness; other
wise the great staples exhibit no new features of in
terest. . .
The feeling in Wall street continues strong, and the
present temper of investors, both professional and
public, continues bu-llish. The market j s nnto t easily
affected by unfavorable reports, while anything in the
way of a bull movement meets with an immediate re
sponse. The ease of the money market has a great
deal to do with this, but notwithstanding the abun
dance of funds the undercurrent of the market is one
of marked firmness. Bonds are especially sought
after, though the usual stocks have come in for their
share of trade.
Business out on this coast is a fair reflex of that in
the East. While there is no activity, there is no real
dullness, and profit margins are sufficient to pay rea
sonable dividends on invested funds. The continued
lack of rain has been severely felt, and until the State
gets a good soaking general trade will undoubtedly
rule quiet. The rainfall, to date is below that of last
year, and this ominous fact deters capital from branch
ing out in any direction.
Although 1898 has been called a year of scanty pro
duction, it is satisfactory to note that the shipments
of fruit overland from California were only 9 per cent
below those for 1897. Early in the spring it was not
thought that this year's shipments would amount to
niore than 2500 carloads, or about one-half of last
year's shipments, but the close of the season finds us
with a total of 4824 carloads of deciduous fruit â quite
an improvement over the early estimates. Last year's
shipments were 5323 carloads. But the returns this
year were larger than those in 1897, owing to the
higher prices this year. Cherries and pears made the
best showing,, the loss in the latter being only 3 per
cent. The dried fruit exhibit this year, however, is
not as favorable as usual, and falls behind that made
by deciduous fruit, owing to its inferiority, due to the
dry season, which resulted in a large proportion of
small-sized and otherwise undesirable fruit, prunes
being the chief sufferer in this respect. Canned fruit
has done very well, having met with a good demand
at better prices than have ruled for several years.
In field and range products there is little or nothing
new. !:Wool has shown rather more life, but is dull
at best, and sales are made only at concessions. Live-
stock of all kinds except veal has declined during the
week, owing to the raising of the tunnel blockade in
the Sierra Nevadas. . Hops are still in brisk demand
at good prices; and sales are readily made. Provisions
are slow and unchanged. The grain markets have ex
hibited no striking features during the week, and trade
lias been dull all around.
One man has gone crazy over the defeat of Cor
â¢. bett, but the defeated seems to keep his head all right
. and is probably even now planning how next to
f.ecce the public.

fL MILITARY REPUBLIC.
THE citizens who are advocating a strong mili
tary policy because our possession of tropical
colonies will require it may be suspected of fa
voring an imperial colonial policy, because it will
I make necessary a standing army of about 200,000 men
and a navy equal to the combined sea strength of
Continental Europe.
It all means that we are to have a military republic,
in which the army and navy will eclipse civil pur
suits. By pursuing a non-military policy and keeping
arms in a position for defense only, the country has
prospered until we are the richest of the nations.
Now we are following the same course as that trav
eled by older countries. The wealth won in the pur
suits of peace is regarded as a prize to be devoted
to the purchase of glory, and its investment in a
mighty military establishment is treated as the highest
patriotism.
If there be no check to this, it will not be long un
til the army spirit will control the country.
Already the politicians are on the lookout for a
military hero as a candidate for the Presidency.
Early in our Civil War, when an army of 50,000
men was passing under review. Caleb Cashing looked
thoughtfully on the marching mass and a friend
asked him what he was thinking. The veteran law
yer answered, "I am wondering what subaltern officer
in those ranks will rise to be ruler of the republic
when the struggle is over." The old student of the
history of nations reasoned rightly. Following the
war seven military men were candidates for the
Presidency, and five have reached that high office.
Politicians will materially assist in making this a
military republic, for our appearance under arms on
the theater of the world's contentions and disputes
will supply us with an abundance of military material.
Our Sirdars and Pashas will be coming home, pan
oplied in military glory, and none of them will forget
the path that brought him to the highest civil prefer
ment. The army will be to this country what it is to
France, where it dominates every interest in the re
public and is able to arrest or distort the processes of
civil justice.
Already the politicians are bringing the heroes of
our brief war into focus for 1900. When the war began
political ambition sent men after commissions in the
army, and the desire to deserve well of their country
men at the polls was not improperly among the mo
tives that sustained their courage under fire and f
It is well that the people should consider how .y
we may glide from our position as a peaceful nation
to that of a military republic, in which the pursuits of
peace are valued, not su much for the homes they
build, the tables they fill and the hearths they warm,
a= for the sinews of war they can supply and the pomp
and circumstance they can support.
LIBRARY AFFAIRS.
ONE of the most gratifying results of the con
ference of librarians at Sacramento was the
appointment of a committee to draw up a bill
for submission to the Legislature providing for the
establishment of some form of the traveling library
system which has been so successful wherever adopted
in the East.
The matter is one of interest to all sections of the
Sate, for in every community there is a considerable
number of persons who will be benefited by it. Its
main benefits, however, will be conferred upon those
portions of the commonwealth which are so sparsely
settled that they contain no public library for the use
of the people.
So much experience has been gained in several of
the Eastern States in the conduct oT traveling libraries
that the committee appointed to draft a bill for such
a system here can hardly go astray in formulating it.
They have only to follow the main lines of the New
York plan and adapt them to local conditions in or
der to devise a feasible and beneficial system.
While the proposed bill promises for the State at
large a better and fuller use of the State Library, the
people of San Francisco have a library problem of
their own to consider. According to the annual re
port the Free Public Library has outgrown its pres
ent quarters, and for its normal growth requires
more space than can be provided for it in the City
Kc.ll. Within two years, it is estimated, a new build
inp will be absolutely necessary for the institution.
On this showing it is full time for the public and
the officials having charge of such matters to begin
to consider how the needs of the library are to be met.
San Francisco is far behind other large American
cities in the matter of libraries, and while, owing to
her comparative youth, this is not to her discredit, it
is time she was making preparations at least for a
suitable home for her Free Library. Two years is

OUR PROMPT NEWS SERVICE.
YESTERDAY The Call once more demon
strated the superiority of its news service by
being the first to give to the public full and ac
curate information of the results of the fearful explo
sion that wrecked the steamer T. C. Walker.
The details of a catastrophe of the kind constitute
a species of news for which the public cannot wait.
Thousands of persons have friends who may be in
volved in the disaster, and these are eager to know
at once the names of all who were killed or injured.
Recognizing this anxiety on the part of the public,
The Call, as soon as the report of the explosion was
received, set about gathering all the details and pub
lished them without a moment's delay.
The extra contained every particle of information
that could be desired by the general public. It in
cluded a full list of the passengers, the names of the
dead, and also the names of the injured, together with
a statement of the nature of their injuries. Thus the
full extent of the disaster was made known at once- to
the city and the surrounding country as far south as
Bakersfield, and the further evil of anxiety and fear
*n many households whose friends were uninjured
was spared.
The promptness with which the news was gathered
and published is another demonstration of the efficacy
of The Call staff and the splendid equipment of its me
chanical departments. The accomplishment may be
accepted as another assurance that The Call affords
-riot only to the city but to all the country round a
news service adequate to every demand and prompt
to meet every emergency.
OUR LATEST BATTLESHIP.
BY the successful launching of the Wisconsin an
other powerful battleship has been added to
our navy and another proof given of the con
structive ability of our shipyards. As Mr. Scott
pointed out in his speech at the banquet on Saturday
evening, the launch was a most important one, "in
fact, second to none in the United States, as the ves
sel is a thousand tons larger than the Oregon and
the contract calls for one knot more speed."
That the new ship when armored and equipped for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 28. 1898.
her trial will show herself equal to all the require
ments of the contract and probably superior in speed
is hardly to be doubted. The record of what has been
accomplished by our ship-builders in the past affords
a firm foundation for the most sanguine hopes in this
case, and w^e may, therefore, expect to see the Oregon
surpassed not only in size and speed according to con-
tract, but in every respect.
This new achievement of our ship-builders increases
the strength of our claim that the Government should
provide for the construction of another battleship
I of the first and most powerful class, to bear the name
I of California, and that she should be constructed at
i our shipyards. This should be borne in mind by our
Representatives at Washington whenever plans for
further naval expansion are under consideration. It
is time to have a California upon the. seas to protect
the Hag of the Union and do honor to the State that
has contributed so much to the wealth and the glory
of the republic.
\A OXTHS ago this paper made an expose of
/ \. the jobbery which had marked the construc
tion of the ferry building. It demonstrated
dispassionately, yet sparing no offender, that the job
bery had been actual robbery: that the State had
lieen swindled by the Harbor Commissioners,, in con
nivance with a lot of contractors; that every change
made in the specifications for the building had been
detrimental to the integrity of the structure and an
extra expense to the State. It pointed out in detail
who had permitted the crooked work and to whom
had fallen the unholy profit.
According to the belief of The Call, founded on
careful investigation, the stealings amount to a sum
not far from $100,000. and, to add to the offense, the
people get a depot far inferior to that for which they
were willing to pay, and for which they were taxed.
In justice to the present board it must be said that
Chairman Colnon is the only member who was a
member of the body while it was devoting its ener
gies to the swindling of the public and the fattening
of contractors.
It is seldom that even in connection with public
work, where stealing i? recognized as a habit, there
has been such bare-faced, unblushing frauds as The
Call brought to light. The accused made denial, but
they could bring forward nothing to sustain their con
tentions. The evidence against them was complete.
The testimony of figures and the logic of tangible
facts were not to be shaken by indignant assevera
tions of innocence.
Yet for a time the matter has seemed to rest. Per
haps the erring, clinking their ill-got coin, thought
their method of obtaining it had passed from mind.
If so, they were over-hasty with their congratulations.
A Senate Committee has heard the report of ex
perts. This report is not yet complete, but so far as
it goes it completely sustains the charges made by
this paper. It shows that on four contracts alone the
stealing amounted to $66,847 55- On masonry it was
more than $28,000, and on carpentry and plastering
more than $.20,000. There are many other contracts,
and there is reason to believe that each one of them
above the foundation was tainted by corruption and
manipulated for illicit gain.
The question arises as to what shall be done about
so shameful a condition of affairs. Shall officials who
have been faithless to their trusts be permitted to go
unpunished? Shall one of them still be continued in
the power he has abused? Surely the people of Cali
fornia can find some way to protect themselves against
rogues. Penalty should be meted out and a demand
for restoration of the loot vigorously enforced.
A NOTABLE feature oi the annual report of the
Secretary of the Interior, which has just been
made public, is the prominence given to
Alaskan affairs and the space devoted to a considera
tion of the needs and the prospects of the Territory.
i Before the Klondike excitement of last year Alaska
I could hardly pet even recognition at Washington.
! but now the officials of the Interior Department make
her the subject of a host of recommendations.
The first feature of Alaskan conditions referred to
i: the difficulty of preventing the smuggling of liquor
into the country. This difficulty is likely to. increase
as the population increases. The Governor of the
Territory is quoted as favoring a high license law as
a means of putting an end to smuggling, but it is a
safe prediction that the higher the license the larger
will be the amount of smuggled liquor in the country.
It has been found impossible to prevent the illicit
importation of liquor into districts where its use is
prohibited even when they are so well policed as
Mnine and Kansas, and it is safe to say the only way
to regulate the traffic in a country like Alaska will be
to make the license so low that the legitimate dealer
can compete with the smuggler and drive him out of
business.
By the imposition of high license the Secretary
believes there could be raised in Alaska a revenue of
$200,000 annually. To that sum $50,000 could be
added by a tax on salmon, and probably $100,000
! more by wharfage duties. The Secretary, however,
announces his opposition to the enactment of any
system of taxation upon the Territory until land laws
have been provided which will enable settlers to ac
quire titles and make homes for themselves.
A sanguine view is taken of the resources of the
country outside of its mineral wealth. It is stated
â that many sections of the Territory are shown to be
suitable for agricultural purposes, and that with
proper care cattle can be raised in the milder dis
tricts. The report adds: "It cannot be doubted that
in the course of time herds of reindeer will cover the
plains of Northern Alaska, and a few thousands of
dollars spent now in helping the Esquimaux to ob
tain herds will save the expenditure of many thou
sands in the future."
The rapid increase of the trade of Alaska has
brought with it a necessity for the erection of more
lighthouses along the coast and the establishment of
a better mail service. Strong ground is taken by the
report in favor of granting the people of the Terri
] tory representation in Congress, and it is pointed out
that there is needed an enlargement of administrative
authority to the local government and the extension
of land laws to the more settled portions of the vast
region.
It will' be seen that the development and organiza
tion of our northern possessions entail a great many
problems and a considerable cost of money. Nothing
cr.n be gained, however, by postponing the settlement
of any of them. Representation in Congress, some
thing of local self-government and liberal land laws
such as are conceded to other Territories ought to
be granted to all parts of Alaska, where there is a
considerable number of Americans residing and
working. The region promises to be rich, and a full
opportunity and encouragement should be given to
American energy and enterprise to develop its re
sources to the uttermost.
According to the Report its contemporaries have
been announcing that no bodies would be found in
the, ruins of the Baldwin. No such contemporaries
are on our exchange list-

ALASKAN AFFAIRS.
THE BALDWIN'S HOODO CHAIR.
"It's a mighty bad piece of business," loudly remarked a glassy-eyed,
horsey-looking man with a red-and-yellow sweater reaching up to his ears,
as he stood opposite the Baldwin ruins the day after the fire and made tun
nels In the drifts of smoke with the strongly charged breath of an Inglesme
cigar, "but there are lots of the boys will be tickled to know the hoodoo
chair Is gone for goo-d and all. . ,
"You see. 1 ' he went on, after he had saved the cigar from being sueKeu
by a strong draught through one of its own tunneJs, "it was the corner seat
in the office just as you went Into or came out of the bar. but it was usu
ally when you came out, and especially In the morning, that it took a tail
out of you. I don't just exactly remember who got the first rally s^eral
years ago. Strikes me it was White Hat McCarthy or Jim-but say, names
don't cut any figure. Anyhow, all you had to do was to stroll out in toe
morning after a few blinkers at the bar to soothe the sensation that comes
hand in hand with the gray dawn on certain occasions. Is ot feeling strong
enough to make any play on tips and things till somebody else had . mad^
a break a chap'd naturally drop into that first seat, light up a clgM Â«QO
size up the field in a free-and-easy way, so no one'd think he was surprised
to find himself there. Then he'd haul out his ticker as steady as he could
and compare it with the office clock to see if the hotel was up to date.
Next he'd nod familiarly to some one across the office. It didn t make any
difference who it was. If one of your friends was watching he d think you
were all O X to be able to see that distance, and that you only failed to
recognize him 'cause you were tcro busy picking winners for the day to clot,
up your mind with too many details.
"So far so good-and the hoodoo hadn't whispered. Well, after a rev.
more passes with yourself you'd light up your cigar again and
brace youself for a look at the street through the Powell-street windows.
Of course you wouldn't be fool enough to waste any time admirinsr the
early morning sunlight, for you all know about those times when no matter
how bright the sun and blue the sky there's a wart on everything m na
ture. It's an optical delusion, I s'pose. but we won't argue that. Any now,
a fell.,w'd try himself on human nature first, lhats something in mo
tion, and Its comforting if you don't feel like moving yourself to IN otbffl
moving, and then you're dead sure the world hasn t come to a standstill be
cause you're tired. Well, you'd see two lovely butterflies come llittint, Daat
the windows from the direction of Market street, and you d follow em with
your eyes to see 'em go past the door or maybe come in. Would you see
rr f m? Nit. They'd reach the door post, and men either evaporate or be
changed into a couple of men or an old woman with a basket on her arm.
Funny, you'd think, but perhaps they got in a Corbett side step, and you d
lay foir the next lot. The same thine:.
"Say you saw Colonel Kowalsky coming up to the post to keep an en
gagement with his breakfast you'd feel sure he wasn't going to do any
fide-stepping act on you. But at the door the colonel would become
Clawson the jockey, or some other Dipestem fellow weighing oO pounds.
One morning I saw Baldwin himself melt into a newsboy. Now wouldn t
that Shock you and make you think that your last night's dreams were true,
or that you had been born over aerain and changed at the birth?
"And the effects it would have on different chaps. I saw a fellow one
morning steady himself .in a manner that was a nerve tonic in itself, it
was done so beautifully until he got the hoodoo. First he tried to keep
his eyes from the windows, but they wandered back again and he began
to twitch He crossed carefully over, opened the inner door and stood out
side looking rather wild at everybody passing He looked quite awhile,
rubbed his face and then coming in to the clerk gasped: My grip-quick.
'Save a room for to-night?' says the clerk, passing the grip. Iso, no
must get back homeâ wife sick,' and out he went.
"Then there wasâ but never mind the nameâ he came rushing up to the
desk from the chair crying: 'Quick, for God's sake, save them.' 'What's
upÂ°' asks the clerk. 'Why. your coal hole's open outside and Ive seen at
least twenty people fall Into it. Send some one >wn for heaven's sake.
"Another fellow I know dashed out of the house, took a drink cure and
has been sober ever since. I tell you our old friend conscience was not in
it as a reformer with the hoodoo chair. And it was ail as easy to get the
hang of as a hundred-to-one shot on the square tip," and the glassy-eyed
man became confidential. "You know the inner doors of the hotel set in
about six feet and the passageway was paneled with long mirrors. rou
couldn't Â«cc the street doorway except as it was reflected in the glass, and
a fellow'd naturally think it was a continuation of the window. Of course
I mean some fellows. The people that passed the window went into the
back of the glass, and in their place you'd see the people coming down the
street as they went by the door. Sitting in any other chair in the house
a fellow'd glance to the window on the other side of the doors, but in the
hoodoo Â«?eat one would no more do it than he'd take his eyes off a mix-up
at the quarter pole to see if the home-stretch was clear. It was a double
barreled game with every trump against you. Some of us put up a job
on Tod Sloan one morning, but it never phased him, and that was Why
Toil's picture always hung above the hoodoo chair. Now, there "
But at. this point a policeman fell through an unusually large tunnel
which the exhalations from the Ingleside Maduro had made in the street
smoke and the glassy-eyed man was lost in the ensuing shoveback.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
An armored cruiser named Kaieer Karl
VI was launched October 24 at San Rocco,
near Trieste. She is the largest ship of
modern design In the Austrian navy and
is 367 feet 6 Inches In length, 56 feet beam
and displaces 6250 tons on a mean draught
of only 20 feet 4 inches. All the armor is
of Harveyized steel, the belt having a
maximum thickness of 10.6 inches, the tur
rets 9.8 Inches and the protective deck 1M(
inches. The armament consists of tv/o 9.4
inch, eight 6.9-inch Krupp guns, the latter
being quick-firers, and eighteen smaller
guns in the secondary battery. With twin
screw engines of 12,000 horse-power a
speed of 20 knots is anticipated. The nor
mal coal supply is exceptionally large. It
being 800 tons, and the ship in its entirety
Is credited with being a perfect specimen
of her type on bo limited a displacement.
The courtesy of Russian naval officers
is well known and thoroughly appreciated
all over the world, and they are welcomed
wherever they go. One reason for this en
viable reputation is that the officers are of
the best families and have private means
besides their salaries, and are therefore
not hampered with the unpleasant trouble
of how to make both ends meet. It is
not alone abroad but also at homo that
their courtesy gains for them so many
friends, and an incident is told of the ex
perience of some English tourists, who by
some misunderstanding were left by
their steamer at Kronstadt. The Orient
steamer Lusatanla called at St. Peters
burg and a party of ten took a trip to
Kronstadt while the steamer dropped
down the roads. The tug failed to come
in time for the excursionists and they
were in danger of losing their steamer
when the admiral commanding the fort
ress learned of their predicament. He at
once placed his official launch at the dis
posal of the party, insisted on paying
their cab fare from the pier to the place
of embarkation, and had search made for
one of the party wbo had lost his way,
and he twice dispatched the launch to the
Lusitania to satisfy himself that all the
belated passengers were safe on board
The London Times gave an account of the
pleasing Incident and stated that the
naval officer to whom the excursionists
were Indebted was Admiral Wessalago
naval governor of Kronstadt.
One of the most remarkable battleships
in any navy Is the turret Bhip Bouvet, in
the French navy. Her offensive and de
fensive power exceeds that of any other
ship afloat In that she carries heavier
armor and can bring 1 a battery of 52 guns
of all calibers into play. She was built at
L'Orient. her keel laid in January,
1893, launched in April, 1X96, and completed
two years later. The Bouvet is 401 feet 2
inches in length, 70 feet 3 inches breadth,
and displaces 12,200 tons on 27^ feet
draught. She has triple screw engines
developing 14,000 horse-power and a speed
of lT l^ "knots. Tm? ship has an all-around
water line belt Â»>f nickel steel 16 inches
thick at the water line, tapering to 8
inches below, and a protective deck 3^
Inches thick, which with the belt gives
protection to the machinery and maga
zines eciual to 44 inches of iron. There
are four turrets, one at each end and one
on each beam. In the forward and after
turrets, which are MV2 inches thick, are
placed one 4fi-ton 12-inch gun of 40 cali
bers, with muzzle velocities of 2625 feet
per second, equal to a striking force of
30,750 foot tons, and the beam turrets car
ry one 10.8-inch gun of 45 calibers, with a
striking force of 22,750 foot tons. Eight
6-inch quick-firers are carried in small
turrets 4 inches thick, and eight 4-inch
quick-firers are distributed on the upper
deck behind 2-inch steel shields. The sec
ondary battery includes twelve 3-pounders
and twenty 1-pounders, a total of 52
guns. There are three above water and
two submerged torpedo tubes, and the
three conning towers are 10 inches in
thickness. The power of the four larger
guns at 2000 yards is calculated as capable
of penetrating 24 inches and 18 inches of
iron, or roughly estimated to go through
12 and 9 inches Harveyized steel at the
range of 2000 yards. At the twenty-four
hours' trial at sea the Bouvet averaged
about 17.25 knots. Her normal coal supply
is only 621 tons, and the estimated cost of
the ship ready for sea, including arma
ment, was a little over $5,415,000, which has
been slightly exceeded.
THERE IS LACK OF
MILITARY ENTHUSIASM
UNCERTAINTY RETARDS RE
ORGANIZATION.
The National Guard aa Viewed by the
Second .brigade Inspector in
His Report.
For the reason stated in the National
Guard department last week, that is to
say, the disinclination of men already in
the guard to go before the medical board
for physical examination, and the fur
ther reason that, In view of the incoming
administration, there is no telling at this
time if there will be any change in the
plan at present being followed in the
reorganization of the guard, matters in
the guard came to almost a standstill last
week In this city.
The medical board held two sessions.
At one there were examined twenty-eight
men for Company I of the First Regi
ment, and at the other session four men
were examined for Company B and a like
number for Companies D and L.. Another
session will be held this week. The en
thusiasm which prevailed at the time that I
the announcement was made that the ac- I
tual work of reorganization would com
mence seems to have been snuffed out as
suddenly as it was kindled.
The petition of Colonel Fairbanks of the
Fifth Infantry to be placed on the retired
list has been granted.
The Naval Militia of California was In- j
vited to send a representative to the ses- ]
Bions of the Naval Militias of the United ;
States, to be held In Philadelphia on the i
2d and 3d of next December. A
proposition to send an officer to represent !
the California militia was discussed some ;
time ago, but nothing came of it for want
of funds to meet the expenses of a journey j
there and back, and there was no mem
ber of the guard who is in a financial
condition to expend $500 for the glory Â«>f
attending the meeting and obtaining in
formation for the advancement of the
militia in this State.
During the absence of Captain Turner,
now at Honolulu, Executive Officer
Nearny Is now in command of the mili
tia.
On the first Tuesday in December the
officers will meet on board of the Marion
for officers' mess and the discussion of
matters that are calculated to advance
the interests of the militia throughout the
State.

VETERAN OF MALATE ARRIVES
ON THE PARA.
He Tells His Sensations When the
Shot Shattered His Breast
bone and "Went Through
Him.
.;: "Victor. Henry Xlolmes, aged IP. private
.of Company K. Tenth Pennsylvania, U.
S. V.. inVa.Ude.d. >;ome." is a simple entry
IrV.the war records which reachpd this
ctty en route to Washington, by the City
of Para. â  But the boy bravery in battle
and guttering from a bullet wound
through; his lungs deserves more extend
ed mention.
? When President McKJnley called for
, volunteers last April Young Hoimes and
: thirty-five fellow students at Waynes
burg, Pa... college laid aside their studits
and ambitions, took up their muskets ami
bade farewell to weeping relatives and
sweethearts. These boys all joined Com
pany K. under Captain Crago, a Waynes
burg graduate. The most popular soldier
in th< company was young Holmes, the
all-round athlete of the collepe and the
winner of highest honors in oratory and
literature.
On the morning of August 1 in far away
Manila he was brought in from the bat
tle around with a Mauser bullet wound
which the surgeons pronounced fatal.
The deadly missile struck him square ,ri
the breast. Shattered the chest bone and
perforate^ th< right lung, making its exit
beneath the right shoulder blade. \\ Uh
every breath blood oozed from the wound
and "the surgeons gravely declared the
young patriot's hours were numbered,
Jlut Mother Nature said no, the youth
must live. Holmes' splendid constitution
and great vitality saved him. and thougn
weak ai d emaciated from months of ter
rible suffering, his covery is assured.
immediately on the arrival of the City
cf Para I>!\ Porter had young Holmes
taken to St. Luke's Hospital. The pa
tient stood the long journey remarkably
well and as soon as he has regained a
portion of his former strength an opera
tion will be performed which will hast< n
convalescence. Owing to lack of medical
facilities and inexperienced nurses at Ma
nila the wounded soldier did not receiv?
proper treatmen. Suppuration lollowed.
and the orifices in his breast and back
have been discharging pus for months.
While he- suffers no great pain. Hoimes
has a racking cough which causes him
great distl ;: ',
Young Holmes has all the characteris
tics of. a-.good soldier and tells his story
with the greatest modesty. Here is his
account. of the battle of Malate:
"The fight began about midnight July 31.
and I was.ordered to vidette duty at the
extreme right of our lines. I had been
firing- a.t the enemy for about an hour
when a' bullet struck me in the chest. I
fired tine more shot from my Springfield
and then fell. . 1 presume that shot was
fir^d automatically, although I remember
(â very incident.: When the Mauser struck
me it. seemed as if a thousand redhot nee
dles had been plunged into my breast.
That : wits only sensation I felt. The re
coil i>t my mngket knocked me down and I
caused the blood to gush from rhy breast.
I walked and crawled about 400 yards to
ward. .our lines : and fell exhausted in an
Â©Id trench- . \.
â  "As '<â¢ irl-y a-sl'ean estimate the time I
laid there about an hour before my com
ra<3<*s found me- and carried me back to
the rf^ar. r had. not lost consciousness, ai
though tlie wound bled terribly. The sur- |
peons â¢ xamined my injury and said it was
fatal. Well; I though of my widowed
motherland sister- and I didn't want to die.
"I was placed in the hospital at Manila
and remained .there two. months. The sur
geons were not .properly equipped, the
nurses did not know their business, and I
<Jiu not get y.-ell very rapidly. I often ex
pressed a wish to my fellow sufferers that
the Red Cross had been allowed to send
nurses to" the war. But they weren't and
we had to suffer' in consequence. Then,
too, the food was abominable. Why, the
morning we went- out to fight we were
given half a can of salmon and six hard
tacks for twenty-four hours' rations.
When we were in the hospital we fared
no better. I was pleased, indeed, when
the doctors told me I was to be sent home.
1 knew I would never â¢ get well down
there." ' â 
The. wounded soldier still worships the
Stars and Stripes as dearly as he did the
day he enlisted, but he declares the volun
teers were badly treated.
Young- Holmes -is anMn-,;s to learn some
thing of his only brother, who went to
Cuba as a correspondent when the war
began. His mother has not heard from
the eider brother for months and they
fear he is dead. â â 
Mrs. Holmes, tHe widowed mother, lives
at Millsboro. Pa., and is assistant princi
pal of the Brownsville public schools.

SENT THE BILLS TO
THE COMMANDANT
Marine Neustadt, Deserter, Has a Good
Fling, but May Have to Pay the
Piper Himself.
DOCTOR" or "Gunner" George Neustadt, now in the City Prison, says
he stood on the bridge of the flagship Olympia and morally backed
up T)ewey when that intrepid sailor was battering the Spanish fleet
into Bcrapiron, Whether George Neustadt is a plain, black-coated
M. P., or a rolling, fighting, timber-shivering IT. S. N., the commandant at
Mare' 'island navy-yard would like to get hold of him. As "Dr." Neustadt is
In jail and as "Gunner" Neustadt will soon be at Mare Island, It is prob
able the commandant will capture the prize.
George Neustadt first appeared at the Nevada stables several months
ago as a physician from L<os Angeles, hired a horse and buggy, and. his
name is yet on the stableman's books for $3. He "doctored" a number of
people and extracted much coin from their pockets. In April he enlisted at
the marine rendezvous, 20 Ellis street, and carried a musket around the
navy-yard as a private marine. About a month ago he deserted and re
turned to this city with stories of splendid achievements with Dewey at
Manila. He was the gunner of the Olympia, and to his courage and skill
was due In a great measure the fact that Dewey met the enemy and
gathered them In.
Then began for Gunner Neustadt a day more glorious that "First o'
May" at Cavite. Tt was give and take in the matter of wining and din
ing between himself anil the people who delighted to do him honor. His
word was history, and no one doubted him. He hired fast team? for
land locomotion, and gasoline launches for voyages on the bay, and his
gentlemen and lady friends speeded those bright four weeks through.
When the matter of the Manila prize-money was adjusted the where
withal to pay for this luxury would be here. This he told to some; to
others in a greater burst of confidence he told that the money was al
ready here. He sent a number to tho navy pay office for amounts due.
In a spirit of recklessness or possibly jocularity he sent some of the bills
of his swell expenditures to the commandant at Mare Island, and this is
the reason that old sea-dog desires to get his tarry paws on "Gunner"
Neustadt is 19 years old, a native of Bre-slau, Germany, well educated,
connected with an old noble family, several brothers officers !n the army
of the Empemr of the Germans, and thus equipped was able to take in a
number of society people of this city. Notwithstanding he was garbed in a
private marine's uniform, the gleam of his buttons blinded their eyes,
and they took him in. to be themselves taken in ultimately. He grew weary
guarding the old hulks along the seawall at the navy-yard from the foes
that never came, and deserted. It was in time of war, and the penalty is
five years on the island. But morally his offense is in sending his bills to
the commandant, and when that commandant gets his hands on that "gun
ner"âwellâ!

Police Attempt to Balk the Vice

The crusade of the Society for the Sup

inmates of Bacon place was continued last
night by Secretary Kane, but before any
result in the way of closing the objection
able alley was gained the affair resolved
itself into a bitter bandying of hard
names between Kane and Attorney Ach,
who appears as the legal champion of the
soiled virtue of the district.
Kane made his appearance early the
If into a bitter bandying of hard
rÂ»es between Kane and Attorney Ach,
j appears as the legal champion of the
ed virtue of the district,
ane made his appearance early in the
evening with a coat pocket full of war
rants, all made out for the arrest of Jane
Doe. They were the same warrants that
he had with him on Saturday evening
when he made his round-up, and it was
his intention to rearrest a number of the
women who had been released upon bonds
the previous evening, the same charge be
ing alleged against them all.
An hour or so after Kane's arrival At
torney Ach turned up and he was shortly
followed by Officers Coleman and Clark,
who had been detailed by Chief Lees to
serve the warrants. Kane turned the
warrants over to them and after a cursory
examination they discovered that they
were the same that he had with him on
fre the warrants. Kane turned the
rants over to them and after a cursory
mlnation they discovered that they
c the same that he had with him on
the previous evening and declined to serve
them unless they were made out in the
right name of the parties charged in the
complaint.
Kane waxed â¢ warm, and dramatically
throwing open the door to one . of the
houses pointed to one of the women and
said: "There is Jane Doe. arrest n-ir."
"Nit," said Attorney Ach. "You know.
Kane, that woman's name is not Jane
Doe, for you arrested her last night and
she gave you her right name then. What's
more I warn any man against attempting
to arrest this woman on the warrant that
you have there. It's no good and you
know it, and I'll have you pulled for
battery.'.
"I know this woman's name Is Jane
Doe. and I call upon Officers Coleman iind
Clark to arrest her," yelled Kane, "and
what's more, Ach, don't you try to run
any more of your bluffs on me."
It looked like blood-letting for a time,
but attention wa-s distracted by Officer
Coleman refusing to make any arrests
except upon proper warrants. That made
Kane hot again, and he accused the offi
cers of standing in with Chief Lees, whom
he said was aiding and abetting and in
terested in the syndicate that is a time,
attention was distracted by Officer
nan rffusing to make any arrests
)t upon proper warrants. That made
â¢ hot again, and lie accused the offl
af standing in with Chief Lees, whom
lid was aiding and abetting and In
ted in the syndicate that is fighting
to keep the houses open. This again
brought down the wrath of Ach, and af
ter another wordy war Kane left for the
City Hall to get Judge Conlan to come
out and issue and serve his own war
rants, as on Saturday night,
Judge Conlan finally decided to take no
further ' action until to-day.

Al White Brings Suit
for Divorce.
SHE TRAVELED WITH SPORtS
SAYS SHE MET THEM WHILE
SHE WAS IN TENNESSEE.
Ho Furnished a Lodging-House for
Her, but She Sold Out and Left
With a Female Com
panion.
Al "White, the well-known saloon man,
who has been identified with the history of
the water front for many years, is en
deavoring through the courts to secure a
divorce from his wife on a number of
charges, among thqm being desertion and
on account of his wife's ungovernable and
vicious temper. White claims that he has
done everything in his power to make his
wife happy, but that all his good acts are
useless.
The trouble began, White says, when he
decided that be would endeavor to secure
some of the gold in the Klondike country.
He left for that region several months
ago, but before starting he left a sum of
money in the hands of a reputable mer
chant, who was to pay it to Mrs. White
in monthly installments. The moment
White had gone north, he claims, his
spouse decided that she would take ft trip
to Tennessee. She soon formed an ex
tensive list of acquaintances, but White
claims she did not travel in the right set,
in fact he says she began to tra\el with a
gang of sports.
From Tennessee she journeyed to Chica
go, with sports and race horse people for
companions, and from there over the bor
der to Toronto. At the last place she be
came financially embarrassed. She then
found out that her friends were not of the
right kind. She decided to return to San
Francisco and sent some very .touching
telegrams to her husband for money. He
sent her the money, he states, and on her
return to San Francisco furnished for her
a lodging house next door to his saloon on
Hush street. But the life was too slow
for her and she sold out the place and is
at present living on Stockton street with a
female companion.
White claims his wife secured possession
of a number of pieces of jewelry that had
been presented to him by admiring sea
faring friends, which he prizes most high

DONLIN GIVES
THE OAKLANDS
A NEEDED LIFT
Handed Out Eight
Ripe Tallies.
THREE INNINGS WAS ENOUGH
SANTA CRUZ DROPPED ONE OF
THE POOREST OF GAMES.
Its Latest Acquisition in the Deliv
ery Department Not Whac Is
Usually Termed aa. Un
qualified Success.
By Joe Corbet t.
Mr. Donlin, the late acquisition of the
Sand Crabs, essayed to pitch yesterday's
game for that organization against the
Oaklands and received such a warm re
ception that the management was com
pelled to replace him. This change oc
curred in the third inning, after the game
was irretrievably lost. Whether Donlin
was out of practice or had an off day
the fact remains that he gave, for the
short time he twirled, the poorest exhibi
tion of pitching ever seen at Recreation
Park.
In three innings he was directly respon
sible for eipht runs, while in the same
length of time fifteen runs had crossed
the plate. He gave seven bases on balls,
w;is hit safely six times, the hits com
prising three two-baggers, one three
bagger and two singles. Goodness knows
what else he might have done had not
the management called a halt on him and
put Whalen in his place.
The game, however, at this stage, had
lost all semblance of baseball, as the
team played simply because they had to
finish the nine innings. The crowd, which
was quite large for such poor weather,
remained hoping in vain that the Sand
Crabs would rally and stir tip some in
terest. Disgusted toward the end they
made their way homeward and were just
as well off. f"r those who did remain the
entire nine innings saw nothing worthy
of mention.
The game does not need description, for
the score tells the awful tale only too
well. Then again the contest was such
a mixed up affair that the less said about
It the better. The score follows:

LEAGUE BABIES WIN.
Watsonville Take? an Easy Game
From the Athletics.
WATSONVII.LE. Nov. 27.â T0-day's
game of baseball drew a large attendance,
this being the last league game to be
played at Porte's Park for the season.
The Athletics of San Francisco and the
Babies of Watnonville contended for the
honors, the score standing 9 to 3 -in favor
of Watsonvllle. Balsz and Hartman
formed the battery for the home team
and Fltzjnatrlck and Lohman for the Ath
letics. The most noted feature of the

Steel Launch Chris
tian Endeavor.
RELIGIOUS SERVICES AFLOAT
DEDICATED TO HER WORK
WITH PRAYER AND SONG.
Chinaman Ah Ting Imitates the De
spairing Caucasian and At
tempts Suicide From the
Ferry-Boat.
The "Christian Endeavor" Is the name
of the pretty little steamer that -will
henceforth ply in the missionary cause
on the waters of this bay. For a long time
Golden Gate Branch of the Christian En
deavor Society in this city has earnestly
desired to own and operate a craft around
the harbor and on the adjacent waters.
No suitable vessel being found for sale. It
was determined to build one. The result
Is a beautiful new boat, propelled by a
twenty horse-power gasoline engine, cost
ing $2100. Her steel hull is 32 feet long,
with 9 feet beam. She is put together in
the strongest manner and richly furnished
Yesferdav the vespel was dedicated at
Meiggs wharf by the Golden Gate Branch
of the Christian Endeavor Society. After
the singing of several appropriate hymns
by a choir, President John Allen told of
the future of the new steamer. She was a
battleship, he said, not a battleship with
great steel turrets and death-dealing can
non of carnal warfare, but one destined to
carry the gospel of peace to whoso would
receive it. The mission of the Christian
Endeavor would be to board ships in the
bay where divine services would be held.
In this way many seafaring men would bo
enabled to avail themselves of religious
instruction, right at home on their own
decks. Addresses were made by Dr. Kig
den and Rolla V. Watt.
The ever-imitating and Ã¼biquitous Chi
naman has passed one more milestone in
his progress through civilization. Not con
tent with crowding all pathways that
lead to a livelihood, he is pressing to the
dreary end of the suicide. Ah Ting, with
mind diseased from poppy juice or fan-tan
table losses, went overboard from the
ferry steamer Piedmont at 4 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. He was seen to walk
nut in the forward end of the boat and,
pulling off his hat, proceeded to "do" his
back nair up in a neat coil around the
crest of his head. Then he went to the
rail and clumsily rolled over it into the
bay. When Ting struck the water its
chilling touch wrought an instant change
in his heart, and he yelled loudly for help.
He had hardly disapeared over the boat
guards when the steamer was stopped and
a boat lowered. Ting's now good inten
tions helped him swim a little, or rather
flounder on the surface till he was picked
up. his stomach distended with the salt
water he had swallowed in his yelling,
and very wet and very cold. At the
Branch Receiving Hospital he was cov
ered with blankets and left to get warm.
"Secret Service" To-Nignt.
To-night "Secret Service" will be plven

ment is said to equal if not surpass the
old, and for one week lovers of a high
class romantic production will have an
opportunity of seeing Gillette's celebrated
war play.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The seventh annual convention of the t
California Miners' Association convi
on Monday of last week and adjourned
on Tuesday. As is generally known '
through the reports of the daily press, a
number of resolutions concerning pending ;
legislation of importance were adopted i
and reports of some importance were ;
read. The perfeci harmony which has j
characterized the association since its or- i
ganization was preserved, when slightly
threatened, by ectlng again the only
pr< sldent the association has ever had.
Hon. Jacob H. Neff.
But one new thing of importance was
brought ; u.p during the convention. That
wa.s the question of the need of impound
ing in servoirs generally throughout j
the State the wat< which flood the ;
many . in tain streams in the spring and j
leave the stream beds and valleys and
sometimes the present irrigating ditches, [
miner's Humes and electric power plants j
in vratery poverty in the fall This â¢
idea- .was- vaguely expressed in a i
resr.lu.rion whi< was not specific- |
ally- referred to any committee, but }
it 'is 'a new thing in the industrial j
economics of fornia and it is of j
transcendent Importance. It is not a Ben- :
sational matter for the newspapers: it j
wfil attract attention but slowly and if >
any practical results are reached it will ;
be years in the future. But it Is a part
of the recbrd of this miners' convention
that this hew and broad idea of impound
ing for. power and irrigation purposes the
mountain waters of the State was first ;
then- set forth. Any one who in even a
small degree comprehends the waste and
the. possibilties of the waters of the
western' slope of the Sierra .Nevada range
will recognize in this brief suggestion a
tremendous potentiality of the future
and. probably, the futility of saying much
about it now. It may be observed that
this may be counted as one of the com
jjensati'ng lessons of the drought. It is
well to be cheerful under all circum
stances.
No one can forecast much about the
next- year's future of the association from
the convention. It dealt wisely, quietly
and well with those old and very Impor
tant matters of the mineral lands bill, the
need of a Secretary of Mines and Mining,
etc., and left the affairs of the organi
zation, as far as active progress may be
concerned, with the executive committee.
â¢The chief thing of home interest, apart
from what the association may recom
mend and -do by the gentle impact of its
influence on the California delegation,
concerns' what the secretary's office may
or may not amount to as the organ
thro-ugh which the association may do
many things for the advancement of the
minihg industry in the State. It had been
suggested before the convention convened
by 1-eading mining men that the associa
tion should broaden Itself and energize it
eelf and take in all the highly varied min
ing interests of the State and become an
initial force for their advertising and
awtikening. All .this was left among the
rest of the executive business of the asso
ciation to the executive committee, but
theri does not appear much promise that
the association Will this year hustl itself
to boom the mining industry beyond urg
ing the highly "important legislation that
has been on the books for some time. But
the association will come to the front
some day, like those reservoirs of which
it vaguely and favorably appoke.

Many thousands of dollars of California!
llâ especially from Southern
forniaâ are going into mining properties
in Arizona, Mexico and Lower California.
The Anti-Debris Association at a recent
meeting at Sacramento received a report
from Manager Phipps to the effect that j
some of the individual restraining dams <
behind which certain hydraulic miners are
operating under license by the California
Debris Commission, were not properly
n-st raining the mud and sand supposed
to be confined behind them. However this
may be. the said dams have been for
mally accepted by three Federal entd
neers, after inspection, and if the darns
arc not properly fulfilling their function
the Government engineers, within whose
soje province the regulation of such dams
lies, would undoubtedly be quick to r
the repair or reconstruction of the damn,
or the cessation of hydraulic mining be
' hind them. The Government engineers
who have in charge all the Government
! engineering work on the Pacific Coast be
sides the hydraulic mining in the Sacra
mento watershed, have not yet been ac
cused of partiality to any interest, and
may be relied upon to carry out the Cam
lnetti law in its spirit as well as its let
: ter. In this connection it may be noted
i that Herbert Vischer, the assistant en
gineer who devoted the past summer to
Investigating the foundations, etc., for
the proposed restraining dam at The
Narrows above Marysville, is now in the
mountains making a tour of inspection
of the dams erected by permission of the
commission and the sites proposed for
future ones.

along these lines.â Trinity Journal.

Several weeks ago a large body of very
rich ore was struck in the Talc mini at
the bottom of a fqrty-foot shaft. 50u feet
in at the 350-foot level. Since then an
other shaft has been sunk sixty feet near
i er the mouth of the drift to a depth of
1 twenty feet where on Monday last a two
! foot lead of very rich rock was struck.
1 This is no doubt the same body of ore
whi^h was recently discovered, and it
goes to Khow that there is a large amount
of this rock in the mine. How much can
only be told by sinking deeper and run
ning drifts under it. â Kern County Echo.

Manila,
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Oct. 21.â Aguinaldo hns
made to a representative of General |
Otis an official statement of thÂ« posi
tion of himself and of the MaJolos
Government. For obvious reasons I j
am not pc rmitted to cable this state- i
ment. I am permitted to write for the I
same reason, possibly, that the Spanish
newspapers here are allowed to say
whatever they please, good, bad or in
different, about the Americans and the j
American Government. General Otis I
and his press censor argue that the j
papers will be so long reaching civiliza
tion that it dues not matter a great
deal what they say. A letter to the j
American press has the distinct ad
vantage, for the Americans, that it may
lead to some inquiry as to methods and
to future reform. Thus we all work to
gether for the good of posterity.
Mr. Aguinaldo, President and Dicta
tor, consented to make a statement
i when he learned that the gentleman
who came to him bore credentials from
; Otis. The conversation lasted two
hours, and was largely in the nature of
I a fencing match. The Tagallo leader,
although he was once a butler, is also
a diplomatist of no mean order, and he
has some shrewd advisers, if they do
j not car â¢ a great deal about how they
i attain their- ends. Also, he is a liar â
which fact dues not lessen the value of
his statement officially, nor is the state
; ment of it superfluous in view of what
has gone before. A man may be a
diplomat and tell the truth by the im
plication of silence, although 1 admit
that the talent is rare.
Aguinaldo began by fencing. H
filially said, in effect, what he has sai
to me more than once before â that h
is in favor of the independence of th
Filipino Republic, with an America
protectorate.
"I realize," said the dictator, "al
though my people do not, that the
Filipinos cannot stand alone. There arc
two parties in the state, about equally
divided. The first, and I believe the
.stronger party, wants the Americans to
guarantee the independence of the
Philippines, leaving us to work out uur
destiny, as Cuba will, under the pro
tection of the Stars and Stripes. 1 am
myself of this party. The other party,
almost equally Strong, is for independ
ence complete, with no foreign inter
vention of any kind whatever. Th
Americans have beaten the Spaniarc
and their work is done here, says th
party. Now, let them go home and le
us alone. We can care for ourselves
We have fought for independence, am
won it. We will have it or we wi
die."
"And are they not," General Otis'
representative asked, "afraid of the
meddling of some of the great powers,
that the land hunger of Europe will
lead to the downfall of their republic?"
"The great powers," Aguinaldo re
plied, "have seen by our action in the
past four months that we can take care
of ourselves. None of them will inter
fere â oi\ if one does, some other great
and merciful powerâ England, perhaps,
or Japan, or even the United Statesâ
will come to our rescue. If no power
saves us, we will fight to death. You
will bear in minrl that this is not my
view. It is the view of the extremistsâ
a very large party."
"And is there no party in favor of
annexation to the United States?"
"The people do not know what an
nexation means. It has never been ex
plained to themâ and will not be. They
do understand independence. They have
fought for it. They will have itâ or
they will have death. The Filipino
knows how to die."
Asked the reason for the recent hos
tile gathering of native troops on the
northern front of Manila, Aguinaldo at
once became non-committal, although
he denied that the men were there with
any hostile intent, asserting that he did
not know men hnd been mobilized in
any unusual number. He is a liar on
both counts. This story of the gather
ing of the troops is another which I
have not been permitted to cable. Gen
eral OtlÃ has been anxious, ever since
General Morritt went to Paris, to get
the rebels who enme in on August 13
out of the suburbs of Manila. He has
succeeded, by adroit manaeemÂ«nt, in
getting them to retire from Ermita and
Malate to Santa Ana. but the division
under General Pin Pllar still holds
Paeo. General Otis does not believe
much in temporizing, although he does
not wish to provoke a crisis, and sev
eral days ago ho issued an order to
Pilar to retire. This stirred up a hor
net's nest. Aguinaldo was asked by
General Otis' representative at Maloloa
to-day If Paco would be abandoned.
Pilar having said he would not give up
the place. The dictator replied that he
had already written Otis, as he had In
fact, that he had relieved Pilar from
his command, and that Paco was even
now being abandoned. Neither of these
statements is correct. Pllar still holds
his place, and the Insurrertn pickets
pace their beats In Paco. Further thnn
that, the Americans are In possession
of proof that the dictator â or his secret
council of six, which amounts to much
the same thing â Is directly responsible
for the concentration of troops in front
of Manila. When Pilar was ordered to
move a circular signed by Aeuinaldo
was sent broadcast through the pro
vinces calling the Filipinos to come In
and nttack the Americans, whose ag
gression had become unendurable. The
officials have n copy of this circular, the
only one In Manila. T discovered the
fact of Its issue and of the concentra
tion of rebel troops on Wednesday. On
Thursday I gave General Otis the first
intimation he had received of the ex
istence of a condition threatening
trouble. His own secret service had
led him to believe the most peaceful
state of affairs existed outside. On
Thursday night his own personal repre
sentative, an officer not attached to the
secret service, going, over the same
ground T had covered, confirmed what
T had told Otis. The General, however,
while he was very courteous, would not
permit my story to be cabled.
"The insurrects may not mean any
thing," General Otis said. "It Is of no
use raising an alarm. I do not believe
they want trouble. In fact, I do not
think they know themselves what they
want. They have moved troops up
close to the city. To-morrow or the
next day they may all be gone agata.
In this, at least. General Otis is cor
rect. I have reason to know that the
Filipino troops now gathered about the
city are being neither fed nor paid, and
that these men who have come from a
long distance have left at home famil
ies without provision for the future. It
being easy for these men to desert and
go home again, and the Malolos Gov
ernment being hardly in a position to
inflict the penalty for desertion, it fol
lows that one reverse, or the lapse of a
little time, will see the present force
melt like a miasmatic mist from the
Pasig before a tropic sun. General Otis,
I know. counts upon the lapse of time
to help the Americans. If the Filipinos
do not attack within the next ten days
General Otis will probably win on his
calculations.
The fact of the concentration of
troops came to fhe knowledge of Gen
eral Otis through a trip I took to the
end of the Manila Railway, at Dagu
pan, on Wednesday. On the road I met
400 rebel troops on a train bound from
San Fernando toward Manila, and I
met also a certain Senor Castilla, a na
tive of the province of Pampangas, and
the head of the raLlroad secret service.
It is to the interest of the management
of this property, an English concern,
to keep informed accurately concerning
conditions In the provinces. Senor Cas
tilla told me these men had been sent
by General Makabtrlus, Gobernor Mili
tario of Pampangas, at Aguinaldo s
order, to threaten the Americans. Senor
Castilla also informed me. and I was
correctly informed, that there were 3000
men at Caloocan. the first station north
of Manila, and that natives from all the
northern provinces were coming down
on Aguinaldo's order to attack the
Americans. MakabuJu3, who does not
like Aguinaldo, and scarcely acknowl
edges his authority, sent his quota of
troops under protest, and told the men
they would be kept onJy for four days.
It follows, if the Americans are to be
attacked, the attack must be delivered
forthwith. The troops sent down by
Makabulus reached Caloocan on last
Wednesday. This is Friday night.
General Otis waited for an official
confirmation of my information before
he declined to permit me to cable the
story at all. He did not wait for an
official confirmation before *ta-enÃthen
ing the defenses of Manila. The threat
of an attack, if the natives mÂ«an to at
tack is on the northern side. On

Special DiÃpatch to The Call
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 27.â A spe
cial to the Journal fpom Woodbine
(Kans.) says: Grant G. Gillett. the
cattle king, so-called, whose failure
last week with liabilities estimated at
over a million and a half of dollars
startled the livestock trade, is believed
to be on his way to Spain. The fol
lowing telegram is said to have been
received in this city to-day by a
brother-in-law of the missinp plunier:
"NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â 1 will leave
to-day by steamer for Spain. Cable
me at Cadiz. How are my wife and
baby? G. G. GILLETT. 1 '
The creditors of Grant" vj. cjlllett. the
cattle king who left for parts unknown
last week, spent Sunday struggling over
the wreck which he left behind. It has
developed Into a case of every man for
himself, and the result is a worse snarl
than ever. Each commission firm who
holds Gillett's paper seems to devote
most of his time In checkmating the
moves the others make. In the mean
time losses are piling on losses, arid the
million and a half estimate liabilities
may go even beyond that amount.
There is no one to fet'd or water the
thousands of caitle at the Glllett farm
here and while the creditors of the
failed magnate are quibbling among
themselves, the cattle in the stalls are
d -ing for the want of water and feed.
The employes on the ranch have de
serted their posts. On a side track are
twenty carloads more of Herefords and
short horns suffering in the storm with
no one to care for them. They had ar
rived on the date of the failure.
It is said to-Jav that Gillett has cer
tainly mortgaged and remortgaged
the same cattle to different parties. In
at least one case, it was stated to-day
he rebranded cattle he had sold to one
man and mortgaâd them to a com
mission house, or, as It seems probable,
to two or three commission houses, for
a heavy sum, and then had the herd
divided and driven quietly off his farm
to another man's place, where he ar
ranged to have it kept for the winter.
It is still impossible to accurately es
timate Gillett's liabilities.
FORT WORTH, Texas, Nov. 27.â
Grant G. Gillett, the Kansas cattle
king is well known In Texas. During
the present year he bought from Texas
cattle men nearly 50,000 head of cat
tle paying for them $2,800,000. Gillett,
after leaving Kansas, came to Texas
and registered at the Worth Hotel in
this city. He Is thought to have gone
to old Mexico.

Mrs. W. E. Paxtox, Youngtown,
North Dakota, writes about her strug-
gle to regain health after the birth of
her little girl:
11 Dear Mrs. Pixkham: â It is with
pleasure that I add my testimony to
your list, hoping that it may induce
others to avail themselves of your val-
uable medicine.
â¢â¢After the birth of my little girl,
three years ago, my health was very
poor. I had leucorrhcea badly, and a
terrible bearing-down , pain which
gradually grew worse, until I could do
no work. Also had headache nearly
all the time, and dizzy feelings. Men-
struations were very profuse, appear-
ing every two weeks.
" I took medicine from a good doctor,
but it seemcu to do no good. I was
becoming alarmed over my condition,
when I read your advertisement in a
paper. I sent at once for a bottle of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
ponnd, and after taking two-thirds of
the bottle I felt so much better that I
send for two more. After using three
bottles I felt as strong and well as any
one. \
41 1 think it is the best medicine for
female weakness ever advertised, and
recommend it to every lady I meet suf-
fering from this trouble." (^
Maternity is a wonderful experience
and many women approach it wholly
unprepared. Childbirth under right
conditions need not terrify women.
The advice of Mrs. Pinkham" is freely
offered to all expectant mothers, and
her advice is beyond question the most
valuable to be obtained. If Mrs. Pax-
ton had written to Mrs. Pinkham be-
fore conflnementtshe would have been
saved much suffering. Mrs. Pinkham's
address is Lynn, Mass.

The storm played havoc with the tele
graph wires along the coast of New
Jersey. The Western I'nion and other
wires in Long Island are nearly all
down, and- beyond Jamaica there is
practically no connection. â 
Late to-night the wires were getting
into good working order, and . It is be
lieved that by to-morrow there will be
no overcrowding.
The large fleet of outward bound ves
sels which were obliged to anchor in
the bay yesterday afternoon, owing to
the prevailing heavy snowstorm, got
under way this forenoon and early this
afternoon and proceeded to sea. Busi
ness at the quarantine boarding sta-.
tion was at a standstill. The only ves
s< la to reach port up to 6 p. m. were the
Mallory line steamer Conial, from Gal
â  eston; the Leitrim, from London, and
the Old Dominion liner Jamestown. The
French liner La Touraine. from Havre,
anchored outside the bar at 5:55 p. m.
Among the steamers due are the Maas
dam. from Rotterdam; the Francisco,
from Hull, and the Thingvalla, from
Christiansand.
NEW ENGLAND COAST
SWEPT BY A BLIZZARD
BOSTON. Nov. 27. â A record break
ing November blizzard swept over the
greater portion of New England last
night and to-day completely demoral
izing traffic of every description, and
well nigh paralyzing telegraphic and
t< 1 --phonic communication, while the
northeast gale, coming on a high course
drove the sea far beyond its
usual limits and made a mark alone
thÂ«- shore exceeded only by the mem
hurrlcane of 185 L
While the storm was heaviest in the
southeastern part of New England, the
whole district was affected, and ex
ceed a snowfall of from eight to
twenty-four inches, and as the center
of the disturbance moved down the
Maine coast that section and the -rov
inces will probably receive a similar
taste of winter weather to-night.
fortunately the storm was heralded '
sumeiently in advance by the Weather j
Bureau to dotn^ most of the coast j
shipping in safe harbors, but the warn- :
ing was entirely unheeded and ignored 1
by those on shore, with the result that ,
nearly every one, especially the rail- |
reads and electric companies were
caught nappin^ and suffered according- j
ly. There was not a railroad in New
Kngland that was not more Â«â¢ less tied ;
v- by the heavy fall of snow and the j
great drifts, and the roads running j
along the coast, like the New York, i
New Haven and Hartford and the Bos- j
ton and Maine, had the added difficulty [
.if frequent washouts in places ex- J
posed to the heavy seas.
Trains, north, east, south and weit
were â  arly all stalled early in the ;
night, although one train from Bangor
reached Lynn this noon, and no Chi- j
cago trains came into the city this;
evening.
In cities and towns dependent upon
electric cars, service v.as even worse
for the damp snow packed hard on the
rails and held up even the heavy snow
plows.
The service In this cit-" was probably
the best of any of the surrounding
community. vet even here there was
no attempt made to run more than a
dozen cars on Washington street and
one or two others of the main thor
oughfares.
The storm, while not so severe and
far-reaching in its effects as the fear
ful blizzard of last February, was
nevertheless the heaviest experienced
in November in this part of the coun
try for a long series of years. Coming
fin Sunday It did not cause the annoy
ance or inconvenience it would have
done on a week day, and most of the
transportation companies made a
heroic effort to at least partially re
cover from the effects of the blockade.
Only the barest reports were received
ufi to 6 o'clock to-night of the effect at
the storm on the coast, but even those
few lines gave rise to the gravest fears
as to the safety of what little shipping
that may have been off Cape Cod last
night or to-day. It will probably be
two or three days before a complete list
of the disasters can be made.
All points south of this city and east
of Providence were isolated early last
evening, New Bedford being lost to the
outside world before 8 o'clock and New
port and Fall River disappearing into
the night not long after.
Farther to the west, at Providence
and in other parts of Rhode Island,
communication was intermittent and
subject to great delay. Night trains
over the Shore Line to New York
reached Providence with only a few
minutes' delay, but beyond that point
they met terrific drifts and it was
morning before either of the two regu
lar trains reached New London. Here
they were stalled nearly all day by
freight wrecks on the road between
that point and New Haven. The trains
from New York met a similar experi
ence west of Saybrook, and after some
hours of telegraphing they managed to
reach New London and started late in
the afternoon for Providence.
At noon to-day the regular New York
express from Chicago left Springfield
for this city, followed a short time later
by the morning express from the west,
and, barring a slight delay from a
wreck at East Brookfield, came through
to this city all right.
WROUGHT GREAT HAVOC
THROUGHOUT PENNSYLVANIA
PHILADHLPHIA, Nov. 27.â The bliz
zard which came out of the west reach
ed this city at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning. As unexpected as It was vio
lent, it wrought great havoc not only
here but throughout the entire State.
The snowfall reached a depth of over
nine inches, and the wind a velocity of
forty-five miles an hour. These figures
are unprecedented in the November
records of the local Weather Bureau,
and the officials there say that the
storm in general was the worst since
the memorable blizzard of 1888. With
the snow the mercury steadily dropped
until well below the freezing point, and
to-night it is still on its downward way.
In this city traffic of every kind, as
well as wire communication, was crip
pled. The suburban lines were brought
to a complete standstill, with the roads
piled high with drifted snow.
The country milk trains which tried
to get into town this morning are still
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1898.
snowbound, and no Atlantic City trains
got away from the city after 11 o'clock
this morning. The main line of the
Pennsylvania Railroad was greatly de
layed. To-day the weather has been
cold and clear and much progress has
been made in restoring affairs to their
normal condition.
Dispatches from interior towns tell
of like conditions. At Stroudsburg
large forces of men were working all
day on the Delaware, Lackawanna and
Western cracks, trying to get trains
through to New York.
In the mountain regions of Scranton
and Wilkesbarre the greatest damage
was to telegraph wires, but the delay
to steam traffic was inconsiderable. The
gale was especially severe around the
Delaware capes.
The schooner William M. Wilson,
from Philadelphia for Norfolk with a
cargo of coal, sprung a leak four miles
south of Metemkin life-saving station.
Her signals were promptly answered
and the guards took off her crew of six
men. The schooner is anchored a mile
and a half off shore and is likely to sink
during the night. A number of vessels
off the capes were unable to get into
the harbor, and it is feared that there
have been heavy losses. The new
steamship Admiral Sampson, which
left Philadelphia yesterday for her of
ficial trial trip, is safely anchored be
hind the new breakwater.
ALL TRAINS DELAYED
BY THE FIERCE STORM
BALTIMORE, Nov. 27.â 0n account
of the blizzard in New York last night
all trains from points north of Phila
delphia were from one to five hours late
to-day. The Pennsylvania train bear
ing this morning's issue of the New
York papers did not arrive until nearly
noon, four hours behind schedule time.
During last night and to-day high
winds prevailed on the Chesapeake
Bay, but so far as known there were
no casualties.
MUCH DAMAGE DONE
IN ITALY AND FRANCF
PARIS, Nov. 27.â During the last
twenty-four hours storms, increasing in
severity, have raged throughout South
â  crn France and Northern Italy. Much
i damage has been done at Marseilles,
j Cannes, San Romo and Genoa, Along
! the Riviera seawalls and sea fronts
j have suffered especially.
At Genoa the German cruiser Hertha,
j one of the convoy warships during Em
i peror William's recent trip to Pales
tine, broke her moorings and collided
i with the Italian mail steamer Scilla,
i both vessels being slightly damaged.
{ Several o-ther small casualties are re
i ported.
VESSELS GO ASHORE
DURING THE GALE
BOSTON, Nov. 27.â A dozen or more
coasting vessels were driven ashore in
Boston harbor during the blizzard of
last night and this morning, and the
great ocean steamer Ohio of the Wilson
line was torn from her moorings and
driven high and dry on Spectacle Isl
and. Schooners and coal barges with
two anchors out and every reason to
expect a safe weathering of the gale
were dragged from their moorings and
hurled against pier heads, dashed on
islands and rocks, or sunk outright.
Fortunately the greater portion of the
coasting fleet was securely tied up at
the wharves. The schooners and barges
anchored in the lower bay bore the
brunt of the storm.
*chored at quarantine was the Wil
liner Ohio, a great four-masted
o boat, just in from Hull, England,
had only a small cargo on board,
and her Bides being high out of the
water offered a large surface to the
wind. The swift tide prevented the
vessel from pointing her nose into the
wind, and after a fierce battle for
hours her cables gradually gave way
and she ran up on the beach of Specta
cle Island, where she now lies high and
try.
As the tide was very high when the
I Ohio went ashore the work of hauling
i her off is likely to be difficult. The
i Ohio lies about a mile from the place of
I the Venetian wreck. Ashore, not far
; from the Ohio, is the schooner C. A.
| White, from Baltimore, but she will
1 probably float.
Just above Spectacle Island is
Thompsons Island, and on the beach
are three down-coact lumbermen, with
the Watchman, Fred F. Emerson, S. E.
Kaphine (British) and a vessel be
lieved to be the Virginia. It is likely
that they will be hauled off without
serious damage. The schooners John
S. Ames and Lizzie Dias are also
ashore at Fort Warren.
So far as known there were no lives
lost from any of the above schooners,
although it is said two men were wash
ed overboard from the Virginia. No
effort was made this afternoon to reach
two unknown schooners ashore at
Moonhead or another further upQuincy
'â  Bay on the flats off the Atlantic.
Further out in thf bay the casualties
began with the sinking of at least one
if r.<>t two coal barges and the lose
of the crew of each. The tug Cumber
land came in earlier last evening with
two barges, and one nfthem belonging
to the Consolidated Coal Company
broke away from the tug and striking
Hunts Ledge, sunk with all four of her
crew Another bar^e blowing into the
Staple Coal Company Is reported to
have sunk off Los Angeles Head and
her crew of four men lost.
The schooner Albel E. Bahcock from
Philadelphia if reported to have foun
dered with her crew of seven men out
side of Boston light. Two other coal
barges are ashore at Ganupt-s Island,
but it Is likely that the crew of neither
has been lost, as the vessels appear to
be in a comparatively safe place.
All of the captains of the fleet were
lucky enough to round the cape and
make the harbor, and say the storm
was the worst that they experienced
in M;iHs:ichusetts Bay. The loss 1n and
'â  about the city will amount to $50,000.
LYNN". Mass., Nov. 27.â Th<Â» damage
to the seawall on thp ocean front is be
tween $30,000 and $40,000. To-night the
city is in darkness. This has been the
only train into Lynn from Boston to
day.
BUILDINGS WRECKED
ON NANTASKET BEACH
HULL,, Mass., Nov. 27.â With the ex
j ception of the Nantasket Chutes and
the main building of the Hotel Nan
tasket there is not a structure left
standing on Nantasket beach between
Hull and the Ocean View House. Ho
tels, dance halls, bathhouses and other
structures succumbed to the high wind
and tidal wave of the storm. Wreck
and ruin now line the beach. The prop
erty, exclusive of the Hotel Nantasket,
was probably worth $100,000.
HEAVIEST KNOWN SINCE
THE BLIZZARD OF 1888
HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 27.â The
storm in this city is the heaviest known
since the blizzard of 1888. The snow
is about two feet on a level and is
drifted badly. J tin Ahem, an elec
trician, was killed on the Glastonbury
trolley line to-day while working at
clearing the tracks. He was shifting
the trolley when he was struck by the
blade of a snow plow following and
instantly killed.
VESSELS AND
LIVES LOST
IN THE GALE
BOSTON, Nov. 27.â During the
gale last night and this morning
thirty barges and schooners ly
ing in the harbor were wrecked
and sunk and at least twelve
lives were lost. The Wilson liner
Ohio is ashore on Spectacle Isl
and in the bay. No serious dam
age is reported.
NOVEL JAPANESE JOURNALISM.
The Kokumin Shimbun of Tokio, one of
the most public spirited and important
newspapers in Japan, has recently Intro
duced an interesting and novel feature
into its columns. It has always taken an
intelligent and thoughtful Interest in for
eign affairs, and among its other efforts
to promote a good understanding be
tween Japan and the rest of the world
has been the establishment of a high
class monthly review and magazine, writ
ten In English and called The Far East.
The proprietor, Mr. I. Tokutomi, has now
"incorporated the magazine, so to speak,
into the Kokumin Shimbun," in which an
"international department" has since the
beginning of September been inserted
dally for the benefit of foreign readers.
This department is written chiefly in
English, though articles are occasionally
published in other European tongues.
Perhaps the most striking feature of the
innovation is the Insertion of notes writ
ten In Japanese, but printed In the Ro
man characters. "This," cays the Koku
min Shimbun, "may possibly turn out to
be a step toward the general adoption of
Roman letters for writing our languageâ
an innovation certainly desirable from
various points of view, but attended by
very serious difficulties." The experi
ment will be watched with interest by all
who favor closer intercourse between the
Far East and the nations of the West.â
London Times.
READE'S ECCENTRIC ENGLISH.
Reade's use of the English language,
too, was eccentric, not to say ludicrous.
In "A Simpleton," when he wished to
signify that two people turned their backs
on each other in a tit of temper, he wrote,
"They showed napes." Describing the
complexion of the Newhaven lishwives in
"Christie Johnstone," he says: "It is a
race of women that the northern sun
peachitles instead of rosewoodizing." In
"Readiana" he describes a gentleman
giving a lunch to two ladles at a railway
restaurant as follows: "He souped them,
he tough-chickened them, he brandied
and cochinealed one. and he brandied and
burnt-sugared the other." (Brandy and
cochineal and brandy and burned sugar
being Reade's euphemisms for port and
sherry respectively.) While, he. was pre
paring his series of articles on Old Tes
tament characters he read what he had
written to John Coleman on one occasion
and came to this startling passage in his
'^Having now arrived at this conclusion
we must go the whole hog or none.'
Coleman objected to this phrase.
"You don't like tho hog. I see, said
Reade; "well, it's a strong figure of
speech and it's understands! of tru- peo
ple; butâ yes, you are right; Its scarcely
Scripturalâ so out it goes."â Gentleman s
Magazine.
HIS POWER OF ORGANIZATION.
London "M. A. P." vouches for this
ftory by General Kitchener of Omdurman
fame as true: More than a year ago, it
seems, he. being rather inefficiently nap
plied with the appliances and rolling:
stock necessary for his undertakings, the
Sirdar was anxious to get a telegraph
wtre from a certain post to another ten
miles further up the river, without delay.
He gave his orders and went his way.
Coming back he found the work at a
standstill, and his electrician and en
gineer complained that although they had
all the necessary wires, they had no
means or appliances for rolling them
along the ten miles to the next post.
The matter was very pressing. The
Sirdar knitted his brow and said. There
are these donkeys. I can give you don
keys." But that was no good. How was
the wire to be unrolled without a trolley,
truck or drum? Again the Sirdar stood
baffled, deep In Thought. Suddenly he
picked up a piece of loose canvas mat
ting and wrapped it around a donkey's
neck, then be seized the roll of wire and
passed it over the donkey's head, Ho
gave the animal a kick and off it can
tered, unwinding the wire as it went, for
the i>ther end was duly secured to the
ground! The Sirdar laughed. "You must
use the donkeys," he said*
A LADY CYCLISTS SOMERSAULT
An extraordinary accident has occurred
on the North Circular road, Dublin, to a
lady cyclist. Sho was passing alonp a
portion of the road where arrangements
for thp electric tramway system are being
completed. The wire was allowed to lie
slack upon the roadway. Suddenly as
she was crossing the wire it was drawn
taut, with the result that the lady and her
bicycle were flung high Into the air. Both
turned completely over, but fortunately
the lady landed on her feet, sunVriiip a
violent "shock, from which Bhe Is at pres
ent prostrated. The machine, which was
raised a considerable height, was com
pletely smashed.â Newcastle Daily Chron

He has now in his charge one of the largest stationary engines in the manafacrurfn*
dlntrict of Kensington, and for more than fifteen years was one of the most trusted
engineers in the employ of the Reading Railroad Company. Speaking of RIPANS
TUBULES, he said: "The lives of thousands of people often depend upon. the
single hand of an engineer. The man at the throttle is responsible for the safety of
every sonl aboard the train. He must have a steady hand and a clear eye. But en-
gineers like alt other human beings, are subject to ills and more than once RIPANS
TABUJLES have helped me along when, without them, I must have failed in my duty.
"As an engineer I have been on duty at all hours of the day and night," said this
man who, by the way, is named John GjlHece and lives at No. 2054 East Somerset
Street in Philadelphia, "and sometimes have had to snatch my meals with scarcely a
moment's interval of rest. Consequently I haTe at times suffered intensely from
nervous dyspepsia and poor digestion. The only thing I ever found that would
relieve me thoroughly and quickly was a RIPANS TABULE and I still take one
when 1 feel the need of a stomach stimulant, Ido not know of anything that could
take their place."

EVIDENTLY A
JOKER HIDDEN
SOMEWHERE
Council in a Hurry to
Make a Big Deal.
SELLING CITY PROPERTY
THE INDECENT HASTE HAS
AROUSED SUSPICION.
Three Cities Are Anxiously Awaiting
the Unraveling- of the Tangle
of the Syndicate Street-
Car System.
'â¢â .â¢Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call.
.'â¢ :'/â  â ' :â ; 908 Broadway, Nov. 27.
A icheme : involving a. million dollars.
nd a Council on. the eve of going out of
office, together .form the most important
Incident â¢interesting the people of Oak
land a 1 this time. The *ale of the City
Hall Bite is a big proposition. It is one
that should noit be acted upon hasUly, and
certainly ono thnt should not be deter
mined without first ascertaining the
opinion of the public. . >
Director.. Sohst of the Merchants 3-^x
change may be-wrong when he estimates
the value of the site at a million dollars.
Councilman Woodward may be wrong
when he estimates it at $613,000. The syn
dicate of which the Mayor speaks may be
wrong in estimating that $600,000 would
be a fair price. ; But there are other facts
connected" with the scheme directly and
indirectly about which there Is no doabt.
It is true that Oakland needs an ade
nuate and modern City Hail. It is true
that the city needs a large public park.
It is true that this Council will go out < f
office next spring, and equally true that
a great portion of it will not succeed it
self. Nor i 3 it any less true, as Mr. Cu
vellier said last night, that somehow or
other there is a very apparent feeling ol
distrust on the part of the public toward
the present City Council which is not al
together unnatural or surprising. It is
too late now for this Council to try. by
three months of death-bed Tepentance, to
blind the i-.uhlle to the acts of the past
twenty months.
It cannot be denied that this Council as
a financier Is a huge failure. In its ar
rangement of water rate schedules, even
â¢with the assistance given the author of
the schedule by the president of one of i
the water companies, the figures were so
thoroughly unjust to the public that they
have not yet been enforced, although they
became a law last March and could have
been legally enforced since last July. ;
These rates were declared by six members
of the Council to be just and equitable,
and Mr. Woodward said that, having
studied the water question for many
years ho knew what, he was talking !
about. idently the â¢ water companies,
who certainly, if they did not suggest the
appointment of Mr. Woodward .were
heartily in favor of him, did not suffi
ciently respect â¢ these expert ideas on
water rates to- carry them out. or else,
which la perhaps truer, they feared pub
lic opinion. â¢ . . ... '".
UlnU In any -event this experience with the j
Council is not such as to invite public
confidence in a maiter where a sum
in the neighborhood of a million is in- i
volved If such a schÂ«me were proposed
irt the close of an administration in San
Francisco it would bo at once denounced
as "a final clean-up," but in Oakland
things are given .different names, although
they smell no sweeter. . _
Councilman Cuvellier, who is personally
opposed to the sale of the City Hall site,
declares that the proper way to decide the
matter is to submit it to the people at the
next city -election, whitih is only three
months away.. It would not cost a cent
to do this/ and would, be the practical
method of solving the question. Oakland j
will not suffer through not having a new !
City Hall for three months, and if all Is
not" straight she will not suffer by waiting i
as many years. In any event the propo
sition â¢is one - that should be carefully
watched during' its successive stages by
every tax payer and voter in this city.
â¢ Tne 'following extract from the report of
the â  Merchants' Exchange Committee is â 
worth studying.
Your committee would also draw your at- j
tention to the fact that the City Hall lot
â which the. city officials are rf-ady to sell for
$r>oo,o<\>. is worth over $1,000,000. With Wash-;
ireton -sirfet cut thr^ucrh, the frontage on that i
street alone : wlll 'be worth $750,000. If a syndi
cate should buy If for $600,000 they could then
ask the city of the people on Washington streft
to pay '$100,000 to <,pf>n the street. Busi- I
r,(-Fs .win be â  strictly business then, for the ,
prosj?ectlVe value of th;u property if $1250 iÂ» r
front -foot;' eighty feet on Fourteenth street
and eighty f.eet on Fifteenth street. One hun
dred and sixty- feet running at the above rate
w!!l mak-e $200,000. . Half of that will therefore
h" a very -reasonable alloAvan^e. Are the peo- i
ple on Washington -street ready to put up that j
amount?' â¢ .
Your eommKtee hopes that the people of |
Oakland will not allow the City Council to sell
& $20 gold piece for $io. .
The West Oakland Improvement Club has j
expressed Itself on the subject. It will be a I
shame- if history should repeat itself and Oak
land should be served the s^/ne way as San j
Francisco was disgraced to all future genera- !
tions by their authorities in disposing of the
front portion of their City Hall lots.
If you want to make a San Franciscan
blush -ask him'-why he allowed that shameful
act to be perpetrated. So will the people of
Oakland blush In future years if the City
Council carries out its intention.
The man who will be appointed to the
general management of the street car line
syndicate of .this city will have' a tnsk not
to he envied. The situation is Interesting:.
Until a .year ago there were half a dozen
systems. Individually managed, and in
many Instances running parallel to each
other. â¢â  Competition was so keen that cars
ran as fast as they could- get out of each
oth-er's 'way. The result was that one af-.
ter another the lines were bankrupted and
receivers were appointed. In other words,
the public was receiving a better service
than it paid for.
Then came the syndicate. It acquired
all the roads and proceeded to formulate
one complete system that would pay. Of
course this could only be done by strict
economy, arid economy meant Iphs cars
and no parallel lines. This of course re
sulted in long waits, more crowding and
fewer connections at transfer pointsâ in
fact, everybody in Oakland. Alameda and
Berkeley well knows what it meant. At
present all vis chaos, but through it all
there is a prospect that the pood old times
of a year agro may he revived.

THE INSANITY OF
A YOUNG SOLDIER
BOBERT ALLEN CHOKES HIS
AGED FATHEB.
Lost His Reason at Manila and Was
Out on Parole From Stockton
Asylum.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
*X) 3 Broadway. Nov. 27.
Robert Allen. af?od 23 years, was arrest
ed in East Oakland to-day for insanity.
He will be detained at the Receiving Hos
pital awaiting the arrival of authorities
from the intane asylum at Stockton, from
which institution he had heen released on
parole about a month ago.
Allen's case is sad. He was amonÃ the
first to go to the front in defense of his
country. Tie became insane at Manila and
Vas brought back on the Australia some
time, ago. From San Francipco he was
â¦ommltted to the Stockton Asylum. The
had intended to commit him to
the asylum at Washington. D. C, but it
was feared he might succumb en route.
About a month ago his father secured
his release from the Stockton asylum on
parole, and his time expires to-morrow.
For a time Allen's reason seemed to be
regaining its former equilibrium but this
morning he became violent. He -was under
the constant care of his aged father at
their home in the AJlendale tract near
Fruitvale, and when the son awoke to-day
ho choked his father, who was n bed.
Later he stopped inio a cigar store in East
Oakland and calling for a smoke a box
was exhibited, when he grabbed a hand
ful of cigars and crushing them in his
hands strewed the mess on the floor. Then
he Stepped behind the counter and started
to clean out the place, when Constable
Jack Robinson placed him under arrest.
Allen will probably be returned to Stock
ton Borne timo to-morrow.
WILL DEMAND RECOGNITION.
Alameda Wants a VorifcÂ© in the Man
agement of Oakland Harbor.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 27.â â  The merchants
and business men of Alameda are taking
a lively Interest in the improvement of
the water front as proposed by the Im
provement Syndicate. The pro.joct will be
a.ffectert to a great extent by the Oak
land harbor bill, which will he introduced
at the next session of the Legislature by
>r Leavitt of Oakland. It proposes
to place the State in control of tho har
bor and provides for the appointment of
a i)Oara of three Harbor Cwmnxissioners.
In the event of the bill beoomiiig a law
Alameda will claim that one of the Com
missioners be selected from here. This
matter has born discussed by the Board
of City Trustees, it was brought to the
attention of the members by Oity Clerk
Lamborn, who urged thai City Attorney
B X Taylor, Pt;itt- Senator-ehect from
this district, be instructed to right against
the harbor bill unless provision Is made to
recognize Alameda's claim to representa
tion on th/e commission. No action was
taken, !>ut it is likely some order will be
made when the board holds its next ses-
The Court's Dignity Exempted.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 27.â The curtain will
be rung down jiext Saturday in the com
edy in which Justice I). T. Hard Is play-.
ing a star part. A cruel Constable has
nung a big sign in front of his honor's
i ourtro.im announcing that on that nay
he will sell at public auction all the court
possesses hut its dignity. Justice Hard's
paraphernalia was attached a few days
after the election, in whioh he was men
tioned a^ among those who "also ran."
The suit was brought by ex-Justice G. A.
Swasey, whom Hard succeeded in office
' when Swasey resigned. An action for
'l;un;.ges has grown o*it of the suit.
It is based on the ;*ict that the Constable
placed his lock on the courthouse door
when he levied the attachment. The case
has agitated all Alameda.
Stoddard Will Not Surrender.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 27.â T. C. Stiwldard
and his friends have not entirely given up
the idea of contesting the election of
County Clerk Jordan. Tt is more than
likely "that a recount will be demainded.
A meeting of his friends was hold this
afternoon to discuss the matter. A ma
jority favored a recount They claim they
have enough information to warrant such
proceedings. Several promdnent attor
neys have volunteered their services to
conduct the matter in court.
Injured by a Vicious Horse.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 27.â Harry Widgeon
was seriously injured last night by a
vicious horse. He was in the animal's
stall scattering straw flor its bedding
when it kicked him in thÂ«e abdomen. The
force of the kick threw the young man
fully ten feet. He was found in an un
conscious condition some time after. Phy
sicians were summoned and pronounced
his injuries serious. Although his con
dition is critical he is restng easily to-
day.
Funeral of B. F. Fletter.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 27.â The funeral of the
late Benjamin F. Fletter was held this
afternoon. The services were held at
Masonic Temple under the auspices of
Live Oak Lodge, F. and A. M.. of which
deceased was a member. Following the
Masonic ceremonies Rev. W. W. Scudder
made an address. The pallbearers were
Judge John Ellsworth. C. EL Wever. Mr.
Crooks. James B. Barber. James L. Field,
E. B. Dunning and James Millington.
QUINN PREPARED
TO ENFORCE LAW
WILL HAVE A COURTROOM IN
BERKELEY.
The Newly Elected Justice Intends to
Uphold the Municipal Ordinances
of the University Town.
BERKELEY, Nov. 27.â Berkeley is now
in a fa\ r way to have law and order en
forced within its limits.
It is understood that James P. Qulnn. |
the newly elected Justice of Oakland j
Township, has agreed to arrange the j
work of his office so as to give the unl- j
versity town a firm and efficient admin- .
istratlon of the law. To this end he in- j
tends to summon a Berkeley jury for all
cases originating within this district, and.
if possible, to have them tried within a
Berkeley courtroom. The extra expense
involved, and the incidents of rent, law
books, etc.. will be borne by the city.
Town Attorney Brenton H. Hayne said:
"If Justice Qulnn really intends to do this
it means that the problem of a court for
Berkeley is settled without further dim- j
culty. There will be no further need of
troubling about a Police Judge or the ex- |
pense of more special elections, for this !
practically provides us with all we have I
asked for.
"As it is now our municipal ordinances j
are more or less of a dead letter, since i
we have no means of enforcing them. The i
question of a local police court with a I
Police Judge involves quite an Item of
expense â too great, In fact, for the present
state of our ilnances. But a jury drawn
from the town overcomes ail that diffi
culty and places us within effective reach
of the machinery of justice, which has
been so noticeably lacking."

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, KOVEItfBER 28, 1898.
DOCTORS NOW
INTERESTED IN
POLITICAL PIE
Supervisors to Show
Gratitude.
A MIX-UP OF INTERESTS
DR. ST-RATTON'S CHANCES ARE
ABOUT EQUAL.
Coroner-Elect Mehraiann May Decide
to Change the Location of the
Morgue â New Deal
Planned.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, |
908 Broadway, Nov. 27.
The patronage at the disposal of the |
Board of Supervisors is now uppermost In
the minds of those who make a business
of polities. There will be a reorganization
of the board after the first meeting: of the
year, and tills means a redistribution of
the patronage.
The board has the appointment of phy
sicians to the County Hospital. Receiving]
Hospital and County Jail, besides all the
assistants, and all the janitors, watch
men, gardeners and engineers at the coun
ty buildings. The medical patronage is of
the greatest interest at this time. Dr.
9t rat ton, brother of the Senator, is in
charge of the Receiving Hospital, Dr. Por
ter of the County Jail, and Dr. Clarke of I
the County Infirmary.
It is acknowledged on all sides that Ala
meda deserves something from Supervis
ors Church and Talcott, for it was in Ala
meda that both these men received the |
majorities that elected them. It is known |
that Talcott favors Dr. C. L. Tisdaie, an
active Republican of the Encinal. Church \
has no man for this place, but although i
he favors Stratton, he might have to vote
for Tisdaie to save his other patronage.
Dr. Stratton was originally Supervisor
Roeth's choice, but it is now said that
Roeth would like to see Dr. Hainlin ap
pointed to the hospital. Church would also
like to see Dr. Porter promoted from the I
jail to the Receiving Hospital. Supervisor j
Mitchell is non-committal and his prefer- i
ence, if he has any, is In doubt. He is â¢
apparently anxious to stand in with Sen- i
ator Stratton to hold the incumbent. Both j
Mitchell and Stratton's terms expire two ;
years hence. Supervisor Wells is also un- I
derstood not to be opposed to Dr. Strat- '
ton.
So far nothing has been said or done in
regard to the County Infirmary, and Dr.
Clarke may be retained. H<- Is strongly in
favor with Supervisor Church.
There were also whisperings that in the
new combination Roeth may be left out
entirely. Mitchell, Church and Talcott
are the Republican majority, and Wells
has a son whom it is said is anxious fur a
job. But for a complication it is probable
that young Weils would have been ap
pointed special watchman of the treasury
during tax-collecting time. Should Wells
enter the deal with the Republicans, his
son will be placed.
Steward Tobin of the Receiving Hospi
tal may be the next Deputy Coroner, It is
given out that Coroner-elect Dr. Biehr
mann may change the location of the
Morgue. When asked about it this even
ing the doctor sai-i :
"There are all kinds of wild stories fly
ing around, but it is a fact that I have not
yet decided where the Morgue shall be.
I have made no promises and no one can
tell what I shall ultimately decide on. for
I cannot tell myself."
It will not be a surprise if the Morgue
be located with McCarthy & Co.. although
it was understood before election that it
would remain with Albert Brown.
There is a new deal being- arranged all
around, and there will undobutedly be
some big surprises.

SKYROCKET'S
SON WINNER
AT INGLESIDE
Young America Cap
tured the Stake.
GOLDEN RUSSET WAS SECOND
VAN CHLOEE AND LADY HER
SCHEL WERE OUTFOOTED.
Pleasure Girl Won the Sapling Stake.
The Betting Public Broke
Even on the
Day.
The> features of yesterday's coursing at
Ingleslde Fark were the fast and sensa
tional courses, the short waits between
races and the abundance of fog. The
day would have been one of the most suc
cessful held this year had It not been for
the thick weather.
The "all-age" stake was won by Young
America, a black and white clog, the prop
erty of J. Shea. The dog, after running
a bye a few minutes before the nnals, j
eamo back to the flips and was slipped to
a good hare In company with Golden Ruh
set, and led up and took the first turn,
and until he was obscured by the fog ap
peared to have things all his own way.
The Skyrocket strain took a boom yester- j
day, fur besides sToung America being hjs j
son, Golden Russet, the runner-up, and O.
K. Capitol also lay claim to the same .
father.
The longest course yesterday was be
tween Counterfeit and Mlra Monte, which
was won by the former in 3 minutes and
::<i seconds, but the pace told on him and
Ills owner withdrew him after hiss next !
course, after he had defeated Rush o' J
Hill. All through the day the bans
proved themselves in good condition, but |
the demon hare of the day was one that j
led Lady Herschel and Van Cliloie a mcr- '
ry dance. He made for them a hot pace j
up the field and back again, with a few j

RELIGION AND POLITICS.
Rev. Mr. Rader Explains the Rela-
tion of One to the Other.
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con
gregational Church is conducting a series
of services which are attracting much at
tention. He inaugurated this series yes
terday evening when he preached on
"Politics" with local application. This
series he has classified under the sensible
head of "Applied Christianity." Under
the subject of "Politics" he delivered a
powerful discourse. During the opening of.
his remarks he announced that this was
an era of applied power. Continuing, ne
said:
"Two things make our age, discovery
and application. The world is searched
for forces, and human ingenuity is taxed
in the tactical application of them, hence
we have machinery and organization, in
the religious world we see the marks or
practical power. Religion like a pent-up
sea seeks for freedom and application. At
least four departments of life illustrate
this spirit, politics, business, amusements
and labor. Politics is the science of gov
ernment and is the realization of religion
In the state. Politics is synonymous with
corruption, bossism. falsehood, bribery
and deceit. Every State suffers from po-
Htioal scandals, and every great city is
more or less looted by politicians."
The speaker read an editorial showing up
the PÂ»oard of Education in San Francisco,
referring to the private and corrupt deal
between the supplies committee of the
board and contractors, whereby the Mis
sion school has been equipped with more
furnaces, patent chairs, desks, and type
writers than there is room for.
If the permission to do this was on the
basis of a "divvy" then there are some
men on the Board of Education who
should go to a less comfortable place.
The greatest evils are entrenched in pol
itics. The social evil, the saloon, gam
bling, and every department of municipal
government. They are all hedged in and
protected by the barbed-wire fences of
political pulls. Even our public schools
fire caught In the meshes of politics. Big
steals are condoned, but the poor fellow
who steals a loaf of bread goes to jail.
There is no better place for a man to
practice religion than in his citizenship.
No better p!Â»ce for the- priest and the
preacher and the church deacon. When a
preacher gets too good for legitimate poli
tics he is ready to go to the land where
there Is no politics.
Christianity may be applied to religion
by having respect for the burdened. It is
just as religious to help a man by your
ballot as by your creed or your Bible.
Religion may be applied to politics by
putting conscience, patriotism and right
eousness in the state.

THE WRECK OF THE ROSARIO.
Captain E. Coffin Returns From the Arctic and
Describes the Disaster.
CAPTAIN EDWIN COFFIN of the wrecked whaler Rosario arrived In this city Saturday, and brings with him a
story of Arctic adventure that Is well worth the telling. He has traversed every Inch of the Arctic seas, but his
latest adventure appeals to him ay the most interesting of all.
Sitting before a blazing flre In his room at the Russ, yesterday afternoon, Captain Coffin told the story of his
ship's destruction.
"The wreck, occurred July 2, of this year," he said. "We left Point Barrow August 17, 1897, In search of the crew
of the bark Xavarach. The ice was running like a strong tide and drove us toward the shore. We were but two and
a half days going down from the Point, but it took nineteen hard days beating our way back. We passed within
four miles of the crew, but the haze was BO dense we did not see them. They were rescued afterward by the steamer
Thrasher which came along their path by accident.
"I tell you the ice began to come up big and strong. It drove us onto the beach and we were three days getting off.
On September 30 we were entirely frozen in, about three-quarters of a mile from shore. Then we worked at It and cut
our way out for about all the distance, there being just 150 feet of Ice left between our ship and the shore. Here
we wintered, preparing everything for the long hibernation. We did not suffer from want of food or supplies. Other
vessels were' In such a predicament, I understand, but we were all right in that respect. Our only difficulty was the
scarcity of coal, for which we were obliged to send to Point Barrow. We hauled it forty-five miles in dog teams. It
took ten days to make this trip and it was severe traveling, I can tell you. During the winter we got sixty deer and
we had a ton of frozen fish on the ship at the time of her destruction.
"On July 2 the crush came. We were forced bodily on the shore Ice, our rudder carried away, the masts ground
to splinters and the Rosario was turned on her side to an angle of 38 degrees with the Ice. The crush came
so quickly we were obliged to leave the ship at once if we wished to save ourselves. She kept careening from one
side to the other and finally settled. on her stern with the bow up In the air. the ice. eight to ten feet in thickness,
forcing her up. We had just five minutes to get out and not even the ship's chronometer was saved.
"For thirty days we lived in tents alongside the ship and could do nothing to save her from being ground up
In the ice. The crew left about August 8 for Point Barrow, I with them. They came down on the Bear and I came
on the steamer Fearless."
SHOT TO SAVE
THE LIFE OF
HIS SISTER

Deadly Combat.
ROW IN A LODGING HOUSE
LOUIS HJORTH TRIES TO KILL
O. A. WEST.
Both Men Are Arrested After a
Struggle and Formally Charged
at the City
Prison.
In a moment of anger I>ouis Tljorth, a
rook, last night, fired a shot at his broth
er-in-law, C. A. West, a longshoreman.
That the bullet did not take effect was no
fault of Hjorth. He intended to kill West,
and when arrested for the offense bitterly
regretted that he did not send his relative
to the Morgue.
Both the prisoner and his intended vic
tim live at 5 Stevenson street-
Last night West, who was under the in
fluence of liquor, invited his brother-in
law to go with him to a saloon on Market
street. They had several drinks together,
and as West was scarcely able to navi
gate Hjorth induced him to go home with
him.
After reaching the house West, who is
married to Hjorth's sister, proceeded to
abuse her. Hjorth Interfered and was
promptly knocked down by his infuriated
brother-in-law. Fearing further violence
at his hands Hjorth went to his trunk and
got a revolver.
Just then West entered his room and
told him to pray, as he was going to kill
him. Thinking he intended to carry his
threat into execution, Hjorth pointed the
revolver at him and fired. West fell to
the floor with a groan as if mortally
wounded.
Policeman Donovan was standing 1 only
a few feet from the house, and, hearing
the shot, quickly entered. On the floor
lay West, apparently fatally Injured,
while over him stood Hjorth, with his re
volver pointed at his supposed victim.
Donovan quickly seized Hjorth, and after
a short struggle disarmed him. West
then jumped to his feet, and after de
claring that he was not injured started
to leave the place.
Donovan also arrested him, and at the
City Prison he booked him for drunken
ness. A charge of an assault to commit
murder was recorded against Hjorth. The
latter claims that West has been in the
habit of beating his sister, and as he
seemed determined to make her a sub
ject for the Coroner last night, he con
cluded to Interfere.
"After I had called him down," said
Hjorth, "he started after me. He first
caught me by the throat, and 'whdi I
screamed for help he knocked mo down.
When I regained my feet he started after
me again, and, thinking he would kill me,
I got my revolver and fired at him. If I
thought that he was feigning when he
fell 1 would have fired the remaining
shots at him."

NEW COACH FOR
THE BLUE AND
GOLD TEAM
Nelson Poe of Prince
ton Is Selected.
COCHRAN IS AROUND AGAIN
SENSATION THAT WAS NAR
ROWLY MISSED.
The Princetonian Was Ready to
Tackle Murphy When That Long
Seventy-Five Yard Run
Was Made.
The news that the University of Cali
fornia had practically selected its foot
ball coach for next season was learned
yesterday afternoon. He will be no other
than the great Princeton quarter, Nel
son Poe, of the famous Poe football fam
ily, a descendant of Edgar Allen Poe, the
great American genius, and a brother of
Arthur Poe, now the most prominent foot
ball player in America.
When seen yesterday afternoon in re
gard to this matter Garrett Cochran, who
is yet in this city, said:
"Yes, there is every probability that
Nelson Poe will be out here next season.
I have advised the University of Califor-
nia footbail management to secure his ser
vices, as he is undoubtedly the best coach
in the country to-day. I know that he
will accept the position and will be only
too happy to take charge of the blue and
gold team. My returning to California
next year is out of the question, or you
may be assured that I would again find
myself with the California boys. But
they get a better man in Poe and I am
satisfied."
Yesterday was the first time Garrett
Cochran came out of his lair since the
Thanksgiving game. He was advised to
sequester himself for his own protection,
which he did so successfully that he was
considered lost. Inquiries Concerning his
whereabouts proved futile, and only a
few of his most intimate friends could
locate him. The reason for his conceal
ment was to avoid the many social cour
tesies which the supporters of the uni
versity had determined to force upon
him, so he permitted himself to be buried
at his hotel until the storm blew over.
Few people knew of the strain under
which Cochran labored the last few days
of the practice. He is willing to talk it
over now that the game has been played
and won.
"Why I was more nervous than I have
ever been in my life," he said. "I could
neither eat nor sleep the last twenty-four
hours before the teams lined up in the
field. When Murphy caught the ball and
ran for that famous stretch of seventy
five yards my heart was banging my ribs
to their destruction. I started after him
and never ran faster. I was practically
keeping up with him along the side lines,
and 1 honestly believe that had not Hall
tackled him when he did I would have
so far forgotten myself as to lunge out
and bring nim down. You can't imagine
how I was itching to cut short his long
and beautiful run. When . Hall caught
him I was ready to explode for Joy."
Nelson Poe is a football athlete with a
great national reputation. For three years
he played quarter back on the Princeton
team, graduating from that institution in
18%. His brothers were all famous on the
gridiron â Johnson Poe, who was at Prince
ton in IRS4 and 1885, and who was colonel
of the Fifth Maryland at Santiago; Edgar
Allen Poe, captain of the Princeton team
of 1889 and 1890; Johnny P. Poe, who has
the reputation in the East of being the
star of the family, and Arthur Poe, of
whom the Eastern papers are not yet done
talking on account of his wonderful eigh
ty-five yard run in the Princeton- Yale
game on November 11, winning the battle
for his college.
If possible Cochran will make a flying
trip to the coast next year to be with the
California team at least for a week.

Desperate Attempt of a Prepossess
ing Young Woman to
End Her Exist
ence.
Domestic troubles impelled Mrs. E. T.
Furman. a prepossessing young: woman,
to attempt to end her existence yesterday
afternoon.
In a fit of despondency she fired a bul
let into her left breast while her husband
was in an adjoining room. The deed was
committed at her home, 321 Fourth
avenue. A physician was immediately
summoned, who late last night expressed
the opinion that the wound was fatal.
Shortly after noon yesterday the
woman left her home to visit her hus
band, who has an office at 6 Golden Gate
avenue. What conversation they had will
never be known, as the husband positively
refused to throw any light on the tragic
attempt of his wife to commit suicide.
It is known that the couple left the
office shortly after 1 o'clock and boarded
a Geary street car. After reaching their
home Furman entered the parlor and sat
down. A few minutes later a pistol-shot
rang out, and. suspecting that his wife
had shot herself, he ran into her room.
She was lying on the bed with a revolver
tightly clutched in her right hand. Blood
was flowing from a bullet-hole in her left
breast, and as Furman approached her
she feebly begged him to go away.
"Let me die in peace," she remarked as
her husband proceeded to stop the flow
of blood. "I know I will be better off in
the other world."
After taking the still smoking revolver
from her, Furman went In search of a
physician. Meeting Policeman Begley ho
told him of the tragic occurrence. Beg
ley suggested that the wounded woman
be taken to the Receiving Hospital, but
Furman refused to allow her to be moved.
After considerable trouble he managed to
find a physician who lost no Timo in
repairing to the house. An examination
disclosed that the woman was beyond
medical assistance. The bullet had en
tered the left breast over the heart, aiid
passing downward, had lodged in the in
testines. At a late hour last night her
death was momentarily expected.
Suspecting something wrong Policeman
Begley lost no time in notifying Chief
Lees. The latter sent one of his detec
tives to make an investigation. After
satisfying himself that the woman had
shot herself the detective so reported to
the head of the department.

This season, as its name indicates. Is a
time for the preparation for the Advent,

preparation, the church, from time imme

adoption of such other spiritual observ

ACUTE PNEUMONIA.
Chinese Did Not Recognize the Ail
ment in Time to Enable Them
to Obtain Proper Medical
Attendance.
The thorough Investigation made by the
Board of Health to settle once and for all
the scare over the bubonic plague has
resulted as members of the board ex
pected There is not now nor has there
been a sign of the disease in Chinatown.
The sanitary conditions of that section
of the city are better than they have been
in years.
The following statement, made yester
day by the executive officer of the Board
of" Health recites the exhaustive inves
tigation made by that body and its ex
perts and the conclusion reached:
"The Board of Health has always main
tained a watchful eye over the district
known as Chinatown," said he. "It is
no new thing to receive reports of the
existence of epidemics in this district.
On investigation, however, these rumor?
have Invariably been proven untrue. The
recent scare as to the existence of bubon
ic plague commenced about ten days ago
and culminated on Friday with a com
munication from the Chinese Consul
through Chief of Police Lees, who in
turn conveyed the information to the
Health Department that it was the belief
of the Chinese Consul that the plague
existed in Chinatown.
"In addition, the death of I.eong Chun
chew was reported by the physician in
attendance as presenting suspicious symp
toms of an unusual character, previous to
bis demise.
"For ten days prior to this time com
munications were received from Dr. Wor
lej of the Chinese mission, and from a
number of Chinese of the higher class,
stating that they were fearful of the ex
istence of some mysterious disease, pre
sumably the plague. As it was causing
rapid death to those stricken the Board
of Health quietly set about making a
thorough investigation of all cases of
sickness In the district. The City Physi
cian, Assistant City Physician and Pub
lic Vaccinator, with two health inspec
tors, thereupon were detailed to make a
systematic house to house search for sus
pected cases.
"The instructions were carried out to
the letter. A final report of the City
Physician showed that there were ab
solutely no cases of the bubonic plague
In Chinatown. The increased death rate
was largely due to cases of acute pneu
"The rapidity with which death
occurred in these cases is easily account
ed for by the fact that the affection was
not recognized sufficiently early by the
Chinese to enable them to obtain proper
medical attendance. Upon the death of
Leong Chun Chew and the notification of
the Health Department of the symptoms
attendant on his sickness, the Board of
Health decided as a result of a special
meeting held to consider the matter, to
make a further thorough investigation in
order to effectually settle the question of
the existence of the plague in this city.
"The city bacteriologist was ordered to
make a bacteriological examination and
autopsy in order to ascertain the exact
cause of death. The premises occupied by
the deceased Chinaman and the imme-
rliate neighborhood were placed under pro
visional quarantine until the result of the
bacteriological examination was made
known The examination was made, and
on Saturday at noon the bacteriologist
presented his report. No bacilli of the
bubonic disease were found. No glan
dular enlargements, which are peculiar to
that disease, were present. The cause of
death was ascertained to be acute,
diffuse inflammation of the kidneys, with
oedema of the lungs.
"The Health officials visited the Chinese
Consul on Sunday for the purpose of ob
taining such information as he possessed
upon the subject. The secretary of the
Consul stated that as far as the Consul
was concerned he had n& positive knowl
edge of the existence of the plague in
Chinatown. Only rumors had reached
him of the many cases of illness and
death, and he reported the same to the
Chief of Police.
"The Board of Health deprecates the
fact that any publicity was given the
matter pending the completion of its in
vestigations. The Health Department has
been ready at all times to take effective
measures to stamp out epidemics of con
tagious disease, and the action taken on
Friday and Saturday was purely pre
cautionary and entirely in line with the
daily work of the department looking to
the conservation of the public health and
the prevention of disease.
"Under the present administration much
has been done to improve the sanitary
condition of Chinatown, but a great deal
remains to be accomplished, and no ef
forts will be spared to carry out the plans
originally outlined by the Board of
Health.
"The public, therefore, can dismiss
their fears/"
