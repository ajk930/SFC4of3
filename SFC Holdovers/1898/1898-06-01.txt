All the Advantage Said to Have

Squadron.
Naval Officials at Washington in Strong
Terms Discredit the Story of the
Engagement.
PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, May 31.â About 2
o'clock this afternoon an American squadron, com
posed of fourteen warships, of which the cruiser New
York displayed the flag of Rear-Admiral Sampson, and
a number of torpedo-boats, began a bombardment with
heavy guns of the forts and the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba.
The American fire was directed principally against the
forts and the harbor. The forts of Morro Castle, La Zecapa
and Punta Gorda suffered especially.
The cannonading was very persistent and cannot have
failed to be destructive. It lasted until 3:45 p. m.
The town, which is situated near the inner end of the
harbor, escaped damage.
At 3:45 p. m. the cannonading diminished. About 3
o'clock cannon discharges were heard at a distance, pre
sumably at sea, continuing for some time, when the firing
ceased completely.
The Spanish authorities maintain strict silence as to
the number of victims, which were apparently numerous.
According to a Spanish source fourteen American war
ships and two torpedo-boats were engaged in the combat
at Santiago.
A very careful fire was directed against the batteries of
Morro Castle until 3:45 p. m., when discharges of cannon
began to be heard at sea off the port. These discharges
continued until 4 o'clock, then entirely ceased. From the
Spanish account it is impossible to judge as to the exact
merits of the encounter.
CAPE HAYTIEN, May 31.â Advices just received from
Havana say that since 2 o'clock this afternoon the American
Santiago de Cuba has been cannonading the bat
teries of Morro Castle, La Zecapa and Punta Gorda.
At the same time, it is added, the American ships have
been engaged with the Spanish warships. The firing was
extremely heavy.
At 3:45 p. m. the cannonading became less heavy

ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL DISPATCH-BOAT, Off Santi
ago de Cuba, Monday, via Port Antokio, Jamaica, May 31.â The first
engagement between Commodore Se^ley and the Spanish fleet com
manded by Admiral Cervera took plaÂ»e last night.
Two torpedo-boat destroyers, aboii. midnight, slipped quietly out of
the harbor, bent on mischief. They along in the shadow of old
Castle Morro and the mountain two liiles to the westward before they
were discovered by the lookout on thQ battle-ship Texas, where the
men were asleep by the guns so that hie battle-ship could be quickly
manned.
An instant after the lookout gaveUhe alarm the white stream of
the Texas' searchlight flashed along tie shadow under the mountain,
revealing the desperate game of the irriirisoned Spaniards. The tor
pedo-boat destroyers, when they saw ihat they had been discovered,
dashed toward the Texas, which, withithe cruiser Brooklyn, was lying
inshore. The Texas promptly opened tire with her port forward and
her crack six-pounders, and the hiss ; of the armor-piercing shells
thrown in the direction of the advancia? torpedo-boat destroyers star
tled the whole fleet. The Brooklyn alsd,cajne into action, firing several
rounds at the Spanish craft, but the b^lk of the shooting was done by
the Texas. The entire fleet went to ger)?ral quarters, and soon their
searchlights were playing around the n^row entrance to the harbor in
expectation that Admiral Cervera's while fleet would emerge from its
haven and fight it out. The torpedo-bolt destroyeres made a plucky
dash through the rain of shells from tie battle-ship and cruiser, but
foiled in their attempt to surprise the watchful Schley, they turned and
ran back into the harbor.
No attempt was made to pursue. It I as jhey retreated quickly and made

The Spaniards did not discharge tor
pedoes, though within 600 yards of the
Texas. The greatest vigilance at night
on the fleet prevents the success of
such attacks.
This nerve-racking duty will soon af

the chance of ending all In one decisive

While Schley appreciates the difficulties
of entering the harbor to fight Cervera.
who is protected by batteries and
mines, it is understood he nevertheless
is anxious to repeat Dewey's feat at
Manila, preferring even risky action to
tedious delay. When seen to-day he
declined to announce either his opin
ions or his plans. His ships have made
an examination of the batteries along
the channel, revealing much stronger
guns and mines than was supposed.
They discovered four rows of mines
laid across the narrow entrance of the
harbor.
Early this morning the Marblehead
ventured to within two miles of the
harbor and positively recognized the
cruiser Cristobal Colon and the two
cruisers of the Vizcaya type and the
dismantled cruiser Relna Mercedes, up
on which guns have been mounted.
This leaves only two ships of the Cape
Verde squadron unaccounted for, but
Schley is sure they are further up the
bay.
The following form the Santiago
blockading fleet: The Brooklyn, lowa,
Massachusetts, Texas, New Orleans,
Marblehead and Vixen.
The British cruiser Indefatigable
reached Santiago this morning. It re
ceived permission to enter to protect
British subjects, but did not go in, pre
sumably because of information that
the Spanish fleet was inside.

HOW UNCLE
SAM'S TARS
FACE DEATH
f^emart^able Bravery of
American Sean)en at
Cienfuegos.
Calmly Worked at Cuttiog Cables
While a Target for Spares!)
Shot ar)d Shell.
KEY WEST, May 31.â Some day after
the war has passed somebody will tell
the true story of the cutting of the
cable at Clenfuegos. And when that
story is told people will understand
more clearly than they understand to
day what sort of stuff Uncle Sam's
navy is made of. It was a theme for
Victor Hugo or a picture for Meissonier,
that three hours of heroism, determina
tion and death in the bay of Cienfue
gos that bright May morning. The
men knew that death awaited them.
They knew when the small boats were
lowered from the ships and they pulled
toward the shore that while they work
ed a thousand Spaniards were con
cealed in the tall grass and underbrush
on the shore, waiting to shower bul
lets upon them. The lookouts from
the masts knew this. The officers knew
it, the men knew it, but the order to
cut the cable had been given and the
command was obeyed.
Small sections of the cable which
these brave seamen cut that morning
are much sought for souvenirs at the
Key West Hotel since the warships
brought back the dead and wounded
after the work was done.
Lieutenant Winslow of the Nashville,
who was in command of the expedi
tion, came into the hotel last evening
and was soon surrounded by a group
of friends, eager to hear his story of
the affair in which he was the principal
figure. He had been wounded in the
left hand and his arm was yet in a
sling. He was not eager to talk of the
matter, but little by little the details
were drawn out, and this is the story
about as he told it:
The Marblehead, Nashville and Wln
dom were detailed to do the perilous
work. The town of Cienfuegos is sit
uated some distance back from the sea
in a harbor which winds and twists
about between high hills, completely
obscuring it from ships standing out at
6<a. Near the mouth of the harbor
the land is low for some distance back
from the coast and then there is a sud
den rise, a sharp bluff towering up and
covered by trees. The lowland is cov
ered by tall grass and underbrush. The
cable-house was located within a few
feet of the water. Not far from this,
on one side, was a lighthouse and on
the other an old blockhouse, or look
out, such as the Spanish in former
years established along the coast. They
were built for the purposes of. inter
cepting filibustering expeditions.
When daylight came the three war
ships were in position a short distance
out from the Bhore. It was soon dis
covered that the Spaniards were ex
pecting and evidently knew the mission
of the ships. Kifle pits were plainly
distinguished at the very water's edge
and commanding the point where the
cable was supposed to be and where the
Americans would have to go in their
small boats. Rapid-fire guns, and small
cannon could be seen. The polished
steel and brass of the guns glistened in
the sunlight. Squares of infantry
swarmed like insects upon the shore.
Groups of cavalry were galloping here
and there and constantly racing up and
down a dusty white path tliat led from
the shore to the side of the bluff and
the hill top.
The little flotilla that did the hazard
ous work consisted of two small
launches, two steam launches and a
half-dozen row boats. The launches
â were armed with machine guns and
were designed to do what they could
In protecting the men in the small boats
as they worked and to tow them back to
the ships in case the men should be so
badly disabled as to be unable to use
the oars. With stead - nerves and
strong arms th â¢ sailors pulled close to
the shore cable house. They went until
they could see the faces of th? Spanish
soldiers peering out from behind the
buildings and out of the rifle pits. They
knew it was only a matter of minutes
when fire would be opened upon them.
But the regular swing of the oars did
not falter.
At last a point within 100 feet of the
cable-house was reached. They were
â¢within 200 feet of the rifle pits, where
the Spaniards were lying ready to open
fire upon the boats.
Lieutenant. Winslow stood up in the
boat and gave the command to throw
out the anchor and begin grappling for
the cable. The water was clear as
glass. The morning sunlight pene
trated It, and every object upon the
bottom was clearly seen. Calmly as if
trolling for fish the men bent over the
boats and began to work with the grap
pling hooks. All this time the men
on the Nashville, Marblehead and Win
dom stood at th^ir guns ready to rain
shot and shell upon the shore the mo
ment a puff of smoke was seen to come
from the rifle pits. The men In the
boats worked on steadily and in si
lence. At las^ one of the grappling
hooks caught nomething and the arms
of two strong sailors soon brought the
cable into viow.
Then came the first shot. It was
Just a flash, a shaip snap, a singing
over the heads of the sailors and a
spiash in the water beyond. There
was no white puff from the depot. The
Spaniards were using smokeless pow
der.
It was the sisrnal for the opening of
a deadly (Ire upon the men in the boats.
It was promptly answered by the guns
on the ships out in the bay. A hurri
cane of shells shrieked and hissed
above the heads of the sailors in the
boats and tore to fragments the earth
whore the Spaniards were crouching
and hiding. Again and again the guns
roared from the ships. Again and again
the great clouds of dust and debris
flew skyward on the shore. Another
mighty <-raPh from th<* Nashville and
the cable-house flew into the air, torn
into numberless fragments. Another
crash from the Marhlohead and the
blockhouse was in ruins.
Then this iron storm from the sea
swung around and pv.-ept the hillside.
It shattered the rocks and trees. It
plowed great furrows in the soft sand.
It drove a throng of panic-stricken
men scurrying to shelter. Then it low
ered again like the rays of a mighty
searchlight and raked and riddled the
rifle pItB.^p^BBBffIPVBBMBM
*vjiat , marksmanship! < i The terrible
flre pouring in upon the rifle pits
passed only a few feet above the
sailors working in the boats. Who but
Yankee gunners could do that â who
would do It, and who but Yankee
sailors would work on yke heroes under
such a blast furnace of destruction?
At the time a heavy sea was rolling
and the miscalculation of a fraction
of an inch or the fraction of a second
would have slaughtered the men in the
boats.
But there came a moment's pause in
the awful bellowing from the ships,
and that moment was the fatal one.
Snap, snap, crash! From a hundred
different points came the fire from the
Spanish rifles, and eight brave men
sank down in the boats. Two were
dead and six wounded. But the Span
iards were too late. Already one cable
had been hauled up and 150 feet cut
out of it. This was the cable that ran
to Banatabo and connected with Ha
vana. The heavy cables had to be
hauled up across the small boats and
then by slow degrees the tough steel
wires were cracked off with chisels
and saws.
After the volley had been fired by the
Spanish the men transferred the dead
and wounded to another boat and be- i
gan looking for the other cable, which :
ran to Santiago. This was soon found,
and again under the canopy of shot i
and shells from the ships the men !
worked bravely on until a section of j
eight feet had been taken from that I
one. After this another smaller cable j
running to some local point east was I
cut, and Captain-Genera! Blanco's last
line of communication with the world
was apparently severed.
When our ships first opened fire on
the shore it was the intention to allow j
the lighthouse to remain standing, but i
when the Spaniards poured their fire \
in on the boats the Marblehead decided j
that a large number of the shots had
come from the lighthouse.
"Out it down," shouted the com
moner from the bridge and the Mar
blehead'R guns again thundered.
The marksmanship was marvelous.
First the small hut, the base of the
tower, was literally torn to atoms, and
then like a woodman cutting down a
tree one of the gTeat guns of the ship,
with shot after shot, bit off the great
tower. This was done at a range of
1000 yards with a heavy sea rolling.
It was Just 7 o'clock in the morning
when the small boats were put off and
it was 10:15 a. m. when the boats wern
again hauled up. For nearly three
hours these men worked under the very
shadow of death without flinching.
It is said the men in our navy are un
tried. That is true. But this is how
they conduct themselves when the trial
comes. They are veterans without ser
vice.
MISSOURI REGIMENT
OFFERED TO BRYAN.
He Declines a Commission, Pre

Volunteers.
WASHINGTON, May 31.â William J.
Bryan, late Democratic nominee for
the Presidency, may, after all, be a
colonel in the volunteer army now be
ing organized to drive the Spaniards
out of the Western Hemisphere. To
day the Secretary of War authorized
the Governor of Nebraska to raise a
regiment of infantry for the service of
the Government under the President's
call for 75,000 additional volunteers.
The Governor previously had requested
authority to do this, and the regiment
he proposed to tender the Government
is being recruited with the expectation
that Bryan will be its commanding
officer,
ST. LOUIS, May 31.â A special to the
P<.%st- Dispatch from Jefferson City, Mo.,
says: Governor Stephens to-day sent
the following telegram:
Hon. William J. Bryan, Lincoln, Neb.:
Seeing that your State, under the second
call for 75,000 volunteers, may not be re
quested to furnish a full regiment, and
knowing of your patriotism and anxiety
to go to the front in the service of your
country during the present war, I hereby
tender you. If, under the second call I am
empowered by the Secretary of War to
make such appointment, the colonelcy of
a Missouri regiment.
Presuming to speak for my State, I say
that our people will be as loyal to you per
sonally as you to your country, and they
wi'l feel honored to fight under your lead
ership. LON V. STEPHENS,
Governor of Missouri.
In an interview Governor Stephens
said: "I offered the colonelcy to Mr.
Bryan In good faith and h^pe he will
accept it. Missourians generally will
indorse my action. I believe, if I am
empowered to make this appointment
and Mr. Bryan accepts, he may be in
duced to become a citizen of our
State."

locality where the fleets were engaged.
Morro Castle is at the entrance of the harbor of San
tiago de Cuba; La Zecapaâ also shown on the maps as Laz
ecapa Castleâ a short distance inside the harbor entrance, and
Punta Gorda is situated on a point well inside the harbor of
Santiago de Cuba, showing the American fleet has entered
the harbor, according to the Havana advices, and has en
gaged the Spanish fleet in those waters.
Private messages intimate that there has been a severe
fight between the American fleet and the outer fortifications
and the Spanish fleet. The fight lasted the greater part of
the afternoon. The advantage appears to have been with
the Americans.
DISCREDITED BY THE
NAVAL OFFICIALS.
They Say It Is Not Probable the Har
bor's Entrance Would Be
â  Forced.
WASHINGTON, May 81.â Naval of
ficials absolutely discredit the news
from Cape Haytien to the effect that
Commodore Schley forced the entrance
to Santiago Bay and engaged the Span
ish fleet in the harbor.
While no official advices have been
received from Schley since the battle is
reported to have occurred naval officials
declare with positiveness that it is not
only improbable but und"er the circum
lcized the prohibition of the export of
silver money as being useless and urged
the Government to increase the silver
coinage and avert a monetary crisis.
Senor Puigcerver, the Minister of Fi
nance, said the measure was intended
to prevent the export of immense quan
tities of silver money stored in the
frontier provinces, adding that if the
prohibition was not sufficient stronger
measures would .be taken. The Min
ister of Finance also said that the Mad
rid mint was coining a million pesetas
daily, which amount, if necessary, he
expected, would be increased by an ar
rangement being made with the Paris
mint.
The Chamber of Deputies voted the
law prohibiting the exportation of sil
ver coin. It is feared the measure will
fail of the effect desired. The rush on
the Bank of Spain to change the notes
continues. The authorities have -le
cided to treat as criminal disturbers
of the peace all persons who change
the notes for pure speculation or to
create difficulties for the bank.
MONITOR MONADNOCK
TO GO TO MANILA.
Officers and Crew Surprised by Sud
den Orders to Hurry to Ban
Francisco.
PORT ANGELES, Wash.. May 31.â
The United States monitor Monadnock
left this port this afternoon for San
Francisco. She started yesterday after
noon, but a slight accident to her boil
ers' compelled her to return for repairs.
The officers of the ship were exceeding
ly close-mouthed as to the extent of the
orders received from Washington. The
order to leave for the tsouth came to
them, however, as a great surprise.
That much is almost absolutely cer
tain.
The officers and men were chafing for
a chance to mix in the actual warfare
with Spain, but they were not antici
pating an opportunity to do it. All ar
rangements here pointed conclusively
to the fact that they expected to re
main here for a month or two at the
least. Most of the officers had sent for
their wives and had perfected arrange
ments for them that indicated they
would be here for an indefinite length
of time. Of course such a supposition
must have had some basis of fact, and
it is conjectured that the demand of
Dewey for additional ships and men
caused the Washington authorities to
change the original plans as to the
monitor. It would thus appear that
the Monadnock will be sent to rein
force Dewey's fleet at Manila.
It is <$uite certain that Captain Whit
ings' orders did not forecast what
would be done with his ship after ar
riving at San Francisco; at least he
gave no hint of receiving any further
orders than to proceed to San Fran
cisco and there await the final instruc
tions from Washington.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, May 31.â Dawsonites
will never read a hurriedly prepared
special war edition of the Examiner,
which was slung together at Victoria
and sent north with Bert Collyer, an
immature youth, who terms himself a
"special commissioner."
Collyer left Victoria several weeks
ago with 2000 copies of this- edition.
With the assistance of a guide he got
as far as Lake Bennett and started
over the ice. He became ill, his guide
deserted him and his condition was
aggravated by snow-blindness. In the
meantime the several packets of Ex
aminers became sport for the winds,
whi'.e Collyer, in a half-crazed condi
tion, wandered aimlessly around for a
day and a night. He was found by
mounted police and cared for, but suf
fered severe illness. He reached port
on the Tees at midnight last night, a
wreck of his former self. To a Call
representative he said;
'1 cannot express In words the
fu'l horror of the trip. I have lost
thirty poui.ds and my health was
bnkpn under the strain. After I had
become sick my guide deserted me.
I beo.'-me snnwblind and lost some of
my papers. Had it not been for mount

Vhen I recovered I went down the

pack the papers and gave them away.
What I could not give away I de
stroyed. The loss is a big one to us,
ta we expected to make a big thing on
them in Dawson.
"Joaquin Miller Is at Tagish, al
though most people think he Is in Daw

"How does he write such entertain
ing letters of Dawson's doingÃ If he is
at Taglsh?" was asked.
"Oh," came the ready reply, "that's
easy enough for Miller. He is the best
newspaper padder the world ever saw â
the best stuff that comes from the
north is obtained through his letter,
and the Examiner has a jewel in him.
The old gentleman is not in too robust
health, but you see he gets the best
of care and will no doubt pull through
all right. He won't go into Dawson
until navigation opens, which will not
be for a couple of weeks. As for my
self, I have got enough of packing pap
ers overland, and will make the next
attempt by way at St. Michael."
REGARDED AS STRONGLY
FAVORING THE SPANISH
Customs Department at Ottawa Gives
Instructions Concerning Ship
ment of Coal. A
VANCOUVER, B. C., May 31.â The
customs department at Ottawa, in an
swers to inquiries from the Collector
of CustomÃ here and at Nanaimo, has
wired definite instructions concerning
the shipping of coal to the States. The
message is headed "clearances of ves
sels with contraband of war and coal
ing of warships," and states that clear
ances may be granted to any trading
vessel carrying goods in the ordinary
course of commerce to ports which are
not blockaded. However, when offi
cers of customs have reason to believe
that coal or articles Canadian, contra
band of war, are destined for use or
service of said powers, clearance is to
be withheld. Stress is laid on the fact
that warships of either belligerent
while in Canada's ports are permitted
to take only a limited quantity of coal.
Until otherwise ordered all cargoes des
tined for Bt. Pierre Mlquelon and the
Schley would not endeavor to force his
way into the harbor In view of the
great difficulties of navigation which
would have to be surmounted In the
effort. The entrance to the harbor is a
channel nearly three-quarters of a
mile long, and at one point only about
a hundred yards wide. While the
channel has plenty of water to float
the ships, It is tortuous and at places
dangerous. At one Â»point it twists
sharply to the left as a vessel enters,

JUDGMENT IN FAVOR
OF THE GOVERNMENT.
United States Supreme Court Be-
verses an Alaska Seal Fish
eries Decision.
WASHINGTON, May 31.â The Alaskan
seal fisheries question was threshed over
In a reversal of the judgment of the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for the Second Cir
cuit by the Supreme Court to-day in the
case of the North American Commercial
Company, plaintiff in error, vs. the United
States.
The Supreme Court, in reversing the
lower judgment, remands the cause with
a direction to enter judgment in favor of
the United States for $76,678, with inter
est from April 1, 1594, and to enter a
judgment in favor of the United States
in the counter claim.
The action was brought by the Govern
ment to recover $132,187, with interest, for
rent reserved for the year ending April
1, 1894, under a so-called lease made oy
the Treasury Department to this company
for royalties on 7500 fur sealskins taken
and shipped by the company thereunder,
and for the revenue tax of $2 on each
skin.
The court says that when the number
of seals that might be killed was limited
by the Government or its agent the com
pany was entitled to such reduction in
the rental reserved as might be propef>
mid that the rule would be a reduction in
the same proportion as the number of
skins permitted to be taken bore to the
maximum. This would reduce the total
to the amount now allowed.
The company also claimed a Govern
ment liability to it in damages of $287,255
for skins it could have taken without in
jury to the seal herd, but which it was
pn-vented from taking by the United
States, which contention the Supreme
Court holds cannot be maintained The.
seal fisheries of the Pribyloff islands the
court says, were a branch of commerce
and their regulation involved exercise of
power as a sovereign, not as a mere pro
prietor, governmental powers that can
not be contracted.

Complete Success of the
Steamship Florida
Expedition.
Volunteers Find a Cuban Force
and a Brass Bar)d WaitiQg
to Welcome Ttjem.
KEY WEST, May 31.â The steamer
Florida returned at 7 a. m. to-day from
Cuba, having successfully landed a
most important expedition on the Isl
and. The expedition was landed on
the coast of Cuba on Thursday morn
ing, May 26.
When the Florida, escorted by the Os
ceola, drew up close to the shore at the
place selected for landing, she sent
scouts to see if all was clear. These
scouts were greeted by Generals Feria
and Rojas, with some 1500 armed insur
gents. Consequently, far from there
being any hostile demonstration on the
part of the Spaniards, the landing of
the expedition was in the nature of a
triumphal invasion. The Cubans who
were in waiting for the party had a
brass band and welcomed the newcom
ers with national airs.
The work of unloading the cargo of
the Florida was promptly begun by the
432 men composing the expedition.
There was nothing in the nature of in
terruption until the work was finished
on Friday.
While the cargo was being unloaded
the Osceola, an auxiliary gunboat, with
her guns ready for action, scouted
about the vicinity, looking for the en
emy, but the Spaniards apparently had
no suspicion of what was taking place.
So easily was the dangerous mission
accomplished that, while some mem
bers of the party were getting the sup
plies ashore, others were providing
themselves with fruit, sugar and other
products of the landing place, a large
stock of which was brought back to
Key West.
Nevertheless, no precautionary meas
ure was neglected, and the moment the
work was concluded the Florida and
the Osceola slipped away, leaving the
insurgents to convey their reinforce
ments into the interior, which, it is con
fidently expected, was done without
any casualty.
The returning members of the Flor
ida party brought with them several
hundred private letters, which, it is
understood, give a complete insight into
the present conditions prevailing in the
blockaded island.
The local colony is elated over the as
tonishing success of the expedition.
The Florida sailed on the night
of May 21. Its men and the
equipment constituted an expedi
tion able to operate Independently
and to defend itself against any body of
Spanish troops which might oppose it.
The expeditic-n was under command of
Colonel Jose Lacret, formerly insur
gent commander in Matanzas province.
He assumed the direction of affairs on
the landing of the expedition. Until
then General Joaquin Castillo was in
control.
Until the landing of the expedition
the United States army was represent
ed by Captain J. A. Dorst, and Tomas
Estrada Palma was represented by J.
E. Cartaya, who has been landing
agent of nearly every filibustering ex
pedition for more than a year. Messrs.
Castillo, Cartaya and Dorst will return
to Key West. General Julio Sanguilly,
on the way to report to General Go
mez, was also on the boat.
This is the most powerful anti-Span
ish expeditic-n ever sent to Cuba. About
300 of the men are Cubans; the others
are Americans. The engineer corps of
the expedition is composed entirely of
Americans, under Aurelian Ladd.
The men were dressed in canvas uni
forms furnished by the, United States
Government, ajid the commissary de
partment had rations enough to last
fifteen days after the landing. The
pack train consisted of seventy-five
mules and twenty-five horses. The ex
pedition carried 7000 rifles and 2,000,000
rounds of ammunition for General Cal
ixto Garcia.
The Red Cross relief steamer State
of Texas, with provisions for the starv
ing Cubans, and which has been at an
chor in the harbor of Key West for
three weeks, sailed for Cuba on May 21.

during the nifht with a pacemaker and
ruptured a ligament of his stomach. He
remained in the race, however, but his

He covered 237 miles.PLANS OF CONQUEST
HAVE BEEN MATURED
SPAIN'S DEFEAT
LOOKED UPON
AS CERTAIN
The Taking of Havana Will Be the Great
and Decisive Battle of the
War.
CALL OFFICE, Riggs
House, Washington, May ;i.
â The Associated Press re
ports from Cape Haytien
were shown to Secretary
Long by The Call correspond
ent immediately upon their
receipt to-night. When told
that the batteries at Santiago
were being bombarded he
seemed not to be surprised.
He was evidently expecting
some such information, but
when informed that a la f er
report from the same source
indicated that Schley had
given battle to the Spanish
fleet he shook his head and
said;smilingly : "I do not be
lieve that last statement can
be correct"
This would seem to indi
cateihat while Schley is ex
ed to reduce the fortifi
; ions, and may be doing so
Â he will not enter the
harbor.
Secretary Long said that a
dispatch had been received
from Commodore Schley this
af'.ernoon stating that another
cruiser had been seen in the
harbor, making three alto
gether. He has no doubt that
the whole six are within,
viz : the Maria Theresa, Viz
caya, Cristobal Colon, Oquen
d ) and the two torpedo boat
destroyers.
The general feeling in
Washington is that,while
the war is by no means
ended and may be pro
longed, Spain is already
defeated. With her Ma
nila fleet annihilated,
Blanco and the entire
island of Cuba sur
rounded and being
starved into submission
and Cervera's ships and
men in a miserable
plight in Santiago har
bor, Spain has only her
so-called reserve fleet
now, and it is by no
means as formidable as
represented.
The list as wired from
Madrid from time to time is
formidable enough, but it is
all on paper. The bureau of
naval intelligence has re
ceived reports of its condi
tion. There are only two
vessels that are worthy of
notice, the battle-ship Pelayo
and the Carlos V. The rest
are in a badly dilapidated
condition.
That the President and his
Cabinet are of the opinion
that Spain is already beaten
is indicated by the discus
sions in the Cabinet confer
ence, where the disposition
of the Philippines and of.
Porto Rico are being as seri
ously considered as if we
were already in possession.
It was decided to in
vade Porto Rico imme
diately after the capture
of Santiago by a com
bined land and sea force.
It was represented to the
President by Senator Spooner
and others that in order to
hold Porto Rico or any other
of Spain's islands, they must
be in our possession at the
close of hostilities, or when
the treaty of peace is nego
tiated. Senator Davis, chair
man of the Foreign Relations
Committee, concurred in this
opinion. Therefore, believing
that the war would end with
the capitulation of Havana,
the President and Cabinet
decided to invest Porto Rico
by land and by sea, and cap
ture and hold the island tern-
porarily at least.
The impression is growing
here that President McKinley
is in favor of the permanent
occupation of both these isl
ands. So far as the Philip
pines are concerned it is hard
to put any other interpretation
on the policy of the adminis
tration in strengthening
Dewey's position by such a
formidable array of warships
and big body of troops.
Still another vessel is to be
sent to Manila besides the
Monterey. Secretary Long
said to The Call correspond
ent to-night that the monitor
Monadnock will be sent as
soon as she can be made
ready. She has been ordered
to San Francisco. The Mo
nadnock is a vessel of nearly
4000 tons, has a speed of
twelve knots, and carries four
10-inch rifles and two 4-inch
rapid firing guns. The vessel
will undergo some repairs at
Mare Island. Like the Mon
terey, she will have to be
towed, for her coal carrying
capacity is limited. Secretary
Long when asked if any ves
sel would be left for coast
defense at San Francisco, said
the Philadelphia would re
main there.
There is no longer any
doubt that Santiago is
the objective point of
the troops now depart
ing from Tampa.
The Navy Department has
thrown off much of its re
serve since it became defi
nitely and positively known
thatCervera's fleet was inside
the harbor.
Secretary Long is well
pleased with the naval cam
.paiep thus far. He said to
THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 1, 1898.
night that he had no doubt
the Spanish fleet would be
captured or destroyed v ithtn
a short time.
It is evidently the ex
pectation in naval cir
cles that when Commo
dore Schley begins to
knock Santiago's forts
to pieces Admiral Cer
vera will be in honor
bound to sally forth and
give battle to Schley
outside the harbor.
It is pointed out that any
other course would be an
exhibition of abject coward
ice. But whether or not he
emerges from his present
security, his vessels will soon
be stormed by the siege guns
operated by our land forces
from the hills surrounding
Santiago.
The capture of Santiago has
been undertaken for a two
fold purpose â the destruc
tion of Cervera and the es
tablishment of a Cuban Gov-
ernment there, under whose
auspices the work of reliev
ing the reconcentrados might
be undertaken. The city was
formerly the capital of Cuba,
and is in a province which is
now in the possession of the
insurgents.
Already the President has
begun to prepare to help these
people, and the commissary
general of the army has pre
pared an estimate of $5,000,
000 for the purchase of suffi
cient supplies to feed 150,000
reconcentrados for three
months.
Santiago will certainly be
under a state of siege before
the end of this week. Many
of the troops have already
embarked from Tampa and
have now reached Key
West. These include the
heavy artillery, with siege
guns, the engineer corps with
its pontoons tor landing and
its force of road builders and
intrenching, tools.
Bianco is helpless. He can
do nothing to aid Cervera.
The length of Cuba filled
with a hostile army lies be
tween them. The Spanish
force at Santiago is small.
It is not believed to number
5000 troops. The batteries
of Santiago and the ships of
Cervera must depend on
themselves to repel the Amer
ican army and navy.
It is said without reserve
by the highest administration
officers to-day that immedi
ately after Santiago's fall the
occupation of Porto Rico will
be undertaken, and the inti
mation is made that 30,000

men will be landed in the
western part of the island.
Then will come the
siege of Havana. One
hundred thousand Amer
ican troops will join
with General Gomez in
attacking Blanco's
stronghold. Army of
ficers are of the opinion
that this will be a great
battle. General John M.
Wilson, chief of engi
neers, says that Havana
is now one of the best
fortified cities in the
world. Defensive works,
of which he has plans,
have been erected al!
around Havana for a dis
tance of twenty - five
miles, and 100,000 well
drilled Spanish soldiers
will be there to resist
the American invasion.

concluding battle of the
war.
FAKE OF THE YELLOW
"JOURNAL" EXPOSED.
It Claims to Have Possession of a
Flag Captured by Admiral
Dewey.
NEW YORK, May 31.â Under the
caption "Fake Flag for Fools," the
World prints the following dispatch
from Washington: Claims are made
by a New York newspaper (the Joir
nal), faked for fools, that it has pos
session of a flag captured by Admiral
Dewey from the flagship of the Span
ish fleet at Manila. These claims, ac
cording to the statutes, are without
foundation. Section 1554, Revised
Statutes, provides:
"The Secretary of the Navy shall
cause to be collected and transmitted
to him at the seat of government all
flags, standards or colors captured
from the enemies of the United States."
The next seetic-n directs him to de
liver them to the President for the
purpose of being "preserved and dis
played" under the direction of the
President. These laws are mandatory,
and must be obeyed by the President
as well as by the humblest citizen.
Before these flags can pass out of the
possession of the Government, a special
act of Congress is required, and as
proof of the correctness of this state
ment, a measure is now pending in
Congress authorizing the President to
return the captured Confederate flags.
STEAMSHIP BELVEDERE
LOST ON CUBA'S COAST.
Spaniards May Have Captured the
Vice-President of the Island
Republic.
BOSTON, May 31.â The Poston Fruit
Company received a cablegram to-day
announcing that its large steamer Bel
vedere, which left Jamaica last
Wednesday night for Boston, is ashore
cm Cape May si, on the eastern end of
Cuba, and is probably a total wreck.
The fate of the passengers and crew is
unknown, although it is thought they
were rescued. The company states
that among the passengers was Senor
Capote, Vice-President of the Cuban
republic.
It is thought that the Belvedere was
wrecked late Wednesday night. The
captain of the fruit company's steamer
Ethelred, who sighted the Belvedere
when passing the cape, says the latter
craft had been abandoned and the hull
was badly damaged. The after part
of the steamer was full of water.
The Belvedere was bui.lt at GlasgpfW
about one year ago and registered
about 1800 tons. Her cargo consisted of
26,000 bunches of bananas and 300 bags
of cocoanuts.
NEW YORK, May 31.â A dispatch
from Kingston, Jamaica, says: The
feeling has grown almost to conviction
here that the Spaniards wrecked the
steamer Belvedere by changing the
light on Cape Maysi, and captured
Dr. Domingo Mendez Capote, Vice-
President of the republic of Cuba, who
was a passenger. The Belvedere had
twenty other passengers, who are
thought to be in the enemy's hands.
NEW YORK, May 31.â A copy
righted cablegram to the Herald
from Kingston, Jamaica, says: The
report is current here that the deck of
the Belvedere, which was wrecked at
Cape Maysi, was covered with blood,
indicating a severe fight. Captain An-
I derson of the Beverly, which arrived
to-day, says the Belvedere Is lying on
the rocks pointing seaward. She
seemed to be stripped of nearly all that
! could be moved. The lighthouse is
! about four miles away, but on account
i of the hills the coast tenders probably
cannot see the Belvedere. As the
coast is usually deserted, the vessel is
not likely to be boarded from the shore.

LONDON, May 31.â The Madrid correspondent of the Standard,
telegraphing Sunday by way of Bayonne, says:
The reserve squadron now undergoing speed trials and grin trials
outside Cadiz is composed of the battle-ship Pelayo, with 821 men; the
armored cruiser Emperador Carlos V, with 417 men; the cruiser Al
fonso XII, with 361 men; the auxiliary cruisers Patriota and Rapido,
each with 175 men, and four torpedo-boat destroyers, each with 120 men.
When these vessels are ready to start Admiral Camara hopes to
take with them seven transatlantic steamers now preparing at Cadiz.
They are armed with Krupp guns and quick-firing guns and carry 250
men each. They will serve at the same time as carriers of coal and
war stores for the squadron, which will also carry a strong force of
marines and provisions for six months.

division. Colonel Roosevelt is with the
last section, and did not arrive until
after midnight. The command occu

Friars Ask for Protection.
MADRID, May 31.â The superiors of
the various missionary orders in the
Philippines have sent a message to the
Government claiming 1 the friars are
subject to persecution and assassina

societies there and in c pain. The mes
sage further declares that the friars
are willing to give their lives and

troops. The Third Artillery and Fourth
Cavalry now stationed at the Presidio
have been assigned to this brigade.
It is also regarded as certain that these
troops will go to Manila on the next
fleet that sails from Kan Francisco for
the Philippines.
It is figured out at army headquar
ters that Charles King, who was re
cently- appointed brigadier-general, will
command the Second Brigade. The goa
sip goes that Harrison G. Otis, whose
name was embraced in a batch of brig
adiers recently appointed, will be as
signed to the command of the Fourth
Brigade. There is considerable spec
ulation as to the assignment for the
Third Brigade. If Major-General Mer
ritt has any particular officer In view
for this command he has not made the
fact known to his fellow officers in the
Phelan building. General Anderson's
name is not included in the list, as he
commands the brigade now due at Hon
olulu on its way to Manila.
For the present it is figured that the
Second Brigade will be commanded by
the colonel of the Thirteenth Minne
sota, the Third Brigade by the colonel
of the Tenth Pennsylvania, and the
Fourth Brigade by the colonel of the
Seventh California. General Miller,
having been relieved from duty as the
commander of the artillery defenses of
San Francisco, will no doubt take com
mand of the First Brigade at once.
Officers and enlisted men of the Third
United States Artillery and Fourth
United States Cavalry are daily ex

departs for the Philippines.
The First Battalion arrived at the ferry
at 9 a. m., and was given a characteristic
reception by the Red Cross Society. The
hot oreakfast was moÃt acceptable after
a week on the car* on traveling rations.
The Second Battalion with headquarters
followed three hours later, and those men
also found a hot meal awaiting them,
which they did full justice to. While the
members of the last detachment were
being cared for by the ladies an express
wagon drove up to the Red Cross So
ciety's dining-room filled with boxes of
oranges. The driver announced that a
carload had arrived for the society from
public-spirited citizens of Los Angeles.
The men of the First North Dakota are
a strong, active looking lot of men, to
whom campaigning will be little more
than child's play. About half are In uni
form, and fully as many are unarmed.
The regiment is also short of tents and
other camp equipage. They are a well
drilled lot, however, and as soon as they
receive their supplies they guarantee to
give a good account of themselves.
Three men of the command were suffer
ing from fever, and three more afflicted
with measles were left at the Oakland
mole until an ambulance could be sent
over for them.
After the men had finished their break
fast, postal cards were distributed among
them by the ludies and time given them
to write a line to friends at home. Then
line was formed, and escorted by the
Merchants' Association band, the regi
ment started for camp. As it started Into
Market street, the cannon in the Spreck

their coming, and the streets were soon
filled by eager crowds who loudly cheered

YOUNG SCHLEY IS FULL OF FIGHT
The Commodore's Son Backs His "Dad" Against Cervera and
Spain's Whole Fleet,
"You can bet dad will give Cervera the greatest scrap he ever had if
he manages to find him, but I don't think the old man will take the chance of
having any of his Bhips blown up by going into Santiago harbor, for the har
bor Is no doubt thoroughly filled with mines."
Thus it waa that Second Lieutenant Thomas Franklin Schley, the Bon of
Commodore W. S. Sohley, expressed his belief yesterday in his father's abil
ity to cope with the Spanish admiral. Lieutenant Schley 1b the junior offi
cer In Company F, Twenty-third United States Infantry, although he expects
in the near futurÂ« to add a bar to his straps. In fact, he recently
passed a successful examination in Mobile for promotion to a first lieuten
ancy, and he will be officially confirmed for that office by the Senate in a few
days.
Lieutenant Schley Is one of the most promising and brilliant young officers
in the service, for he has risen purely on his own merits, having entered
the army as a private, January 18, 1884, when he passed the required exami
nation and was assigned to the army Signal Corps, then at Washington,
Lieutenant Schley waa born at Annapolis, Md., in 1864, and lived there for
sixteen years, attending St. John's College. In ISSO his father was sent to
Boston as lighthouse inspector, and his son accompanied him, and attended
college in Boston for four years. After leaving college he entered the army
and saw service throughout the West. During the seven years that he
served in the ranks Lieutenant Schley was promoted from a private to a
first sergeant.
In March, 1891, he took his preliminary examination for promotion at
Fort Snelling, and in July of the same year he successfully passed his sec
ond examination at Fortress Monroe, and was assigned to the Twenty-third
Infantry, with which regiment he has served ever since.
Lieutenant Schley Is now detached from his company as regimental
commissary. In December, 1894, he married Miss Lila M Langhorne of
Lynchburg, Va., who is a first cousin of Mrs. Charles Dana Gibson, the wife
of America's foremost illustrator.
Lieutenant Schley is short of stature, with clean-cut features, dark hair
and keen, blue eyes. He has about him that air of determination which
characterizes his father. Lieutenant Schley 1b greatly admired by his brother

into a regiment. "We have now on the roll
at our headquarters more than three hun

headquarters for mobilization. All com
munications should be addressed to Major
L. N. Penney, 1331 Market street. The ne
groes of the State should respond to the
call of the President and show that they
are not at all lacking in patriotism or
bravery."
Major Penney requests that all loyal
colored- men throughout the State take
steps at an early date to organize for the
war. He wants to see a fine body of col
ored men go to Manila at as early a pe
riod as is possible.
The major was orderly for General

NOT ON DRESS PARADE.
ThÂ© members of the First Regiment of
North Dakota Volunteers feel somewhat
aggrieved over the statements of the
Evening Report to the effect that they
were only half uniformed; that they were
poorly supplied with clothing, especially
shoes; that they were short on blankets;
that the men were armed with all sorts
of guns, and that they were green farmer
lads, ignorant of military affairs.
"These men from Dakota," said a mem
ber of the regiment, "have come promptly
to the front at their country's call, with
out regard to comfort or style. We are
not on dress parade, but nevertheless we
received an enthusiastic ovation as we
marched up Market street, and we ap
preciate the hearty reception. When we
go to the front we will be as well equip
ped as any other regiment, but clothes
or no clothes we are prepared to pull the
trigger all the same. The fact Is, how
ever, that we are fairly well equipped.
As to clothing, there is not one man who
is not well supplied. About 65 per cent
have Springfield rifles, all of the same
pattern. The two battalions are made up
of lawyers, business men, clerks, farmers
and cowboys. There is not a man in the
command who cannot read and write.
When the time comes for action on the
field of battle we shall not be found lack
ing in courage."

DEFENSES OF THE HARBOR
Adjutant-General Corbin's Re
ply to the Chamber of
Commerce.
Shortly after the First United States
Infantry regiment and light artillery
soldiers were moved from the Presidio
to the Gulf, the commercial people of this
city became uneasy. They feared that
with Spain's Asiatic squadron Bailing at
' will in the Pacific, unconquered by Dewey,
the notion might take the commander to
! pay this coast a visit, to the great injury
! of this city, especially if the artillery sol
diers were not here to give protection. A
meeting of the Chamber of Commerce was
called and resolutions were passed by the
members to the effect that without artil
lery soldiers the city was practically de
i fenseless against the ships of the enemy,
i especially as the battleship Oregon had
j also been ordered to the waters of the
Atlantic. These facts were properly set
forth in a memorial, which was sent to
the Pacific Coast Representatives in Con
i gress, with the request that every effort
| be made to have a more efficient artillery
service in this city. The gentlemen to
1 whom the letters were sent acted with
promptness and the , situation was pre
sented to the heads of the War Depart
ment. That the request was noted by the
authorities mentioned is shown by the fol
lowing letter sent to Senator George C
Perkins, who at once .forwarded it to the
Chamber of Commerce, the letter arriv
ing yesterday: : ;â¢Â£â ; â / . .

WANT BASEBALL GLORY.
Members of Companies I and F cf
Minnesota Issue a Challenge.
The members of Companies I and F of
the Thirteenth Minnesota Regiment are
anxious to gain glory on the athletic field
before leaving for Manila. Yesterday they
Issued a challenge to any local base
ball team of standing to meet them on tho
diamond. The soldier boys would prefer
to meet the San Francisco team, and in
view of the game this club has been put
ting up of late, it would be well for thorn
to think twice before accepting any chal
lenges.
The "boys in blue" are not particular
what team opposes them; yet would pre
fer to compete with some representative
club of the city, in the event of the San
Franciscos failing to meet them.
Address all challenges to Al Rieberg of
Company I, Thirteenth Minnesota Volun
teers, Camp Merrltt.

were in attendance and formed a quiet
and apparently interested audience.

interpreted by Mrs. Vrooman, who fol
lowed with a short Bible reading- in Chi
nese. In addition to other addresses Mrs.
Condit announced that a calling commit
tee had been organized, as the members
were desirous that their white frienda
should visit them. Refreshments, con
sisting of fruit, cake and tea, were then,
served, after which flowers were distrib
uted to guests.
Musicians at a Banquet.
The Musicians' Club of San Francisco
gave its annual ladies' banquet at the
California Hotel last night, and over fifty
guests were entertained at table with a
delightful menu. After the good things
had been discussed a musical programme
of high character was rencered and closed
an evening of exceptional enjoyment.
The officers of the club are: President,
H. J. Stewart; vice-president, H. B.
Pasmore; secretary and treasurer, R.
Tolmie.
ADVEBTISEMENTS.
Thousands of men in every walk of life
all over the world are playing a desperate
game with Death for an opponent. They
are playing with an opponcutwho has every
advantage, and the outcome of the game is
as certain asâ Death. The man in any walk
of life, who is too hard-worked, too busy,
to take care of his health has only himself
to blame when the final break-down comes.
It is easy to keep health while one has it,
but uphill work to win it back when it ia
lost A man neglects a slight indigestion.
Then his appetite gets poor. That's a trifle
and he pays no attention to it Then he
complains of headaches and it is hard to
work or think. His sleep becomes restless
and he only gets troubled spells of it Hf

wrong both at home and at business. He
persists in paying no attention to his
health. Then some day he breaks down.
The doctor says nervous prostration or con-
sumption as the case may be. He has been
playing a game with death and has been

Troops From Far Easterr
States Coming to San
Francisco.
Commissary Department Is Lay
ing In Supplies for Twenty
Thousand Men.
WASHINGTON, May 81.â Assistant
Secretary Meiklejohn of the War De
partment was engaged to-day in nego
tiating for additional vessels for trans
ports for tho tmops to Manila. How
ever, the day passed without the ne
gotiations being closed in any one
case. The commissary department is
hiving in a three months' supply for
nifn at San Francisco, which
would seem to indicate that the troops
to re-enforce Admiral Dewey will ap
proach that number. It is rumored to
day that the troops from lowa, Ten
nessee, New York and other States
would be ordered to San Franoisco, but
the officials declined to say whether
these reports were correct.
Paymaster General Stanton of the
army has directed that $1,000,000 be
placi d to the credit of the representa
tive of his office at San Francisco to
pay the officers and men who are to go
to Manila one month's wages in ad
vance. This action is taken because of
the authority conferred in a recent act
ogress. It has been decided by
the War Department officials that the
term "operations against the enemy"
begins when the soldiers actually start
for their embarkation points for the
places to which they are to go. The
Question arose In connection with the
law which permitted officers of lower
rank to present claims for increased
compensation when they are assigned
temporarily to command a higher rank
In the operations against the enemy.
COLUMBIA, S. C, May 31.â A special
train bearing General Miles and party
from Washington to Tampa passed
through here at 1 o'clock this after
noon. They are traveling as the sec
ond section of the limited over the
Southern and Florida Central and are
due in Tampa to-morrow morning. A
committee of Savannah citizens met
General Miles here for the purpose of
inducing him to concentrate some
of the troops now at Chickamauga in
Savannah. That city will appropriate
$5000 for a camp ground.
CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK,
Ga., May 31.â Much to the disappoint
ment of a number of volunteers here
who think they are ready to go to the
front no orders were given for the
movement of any commands additional
to those mentioned yesterday. The
Southern and the Western and Atlan
tic railroads were instructed to-day to
move four regiments, two each to-mor
row morning. In accordance with this
order the following regiments have
designated to move to-morrow:
First District of Columbia, One Hun

KEY WEST, May 31.â Couriers from
Cuba to-day brought very encouraging
report* from General Callxto Garcia's j
army. Garcia alone, it is said, has j
10,000 men, better equipped than ever !
before, except in the matter of cloth
ing, and they are in excellent spirits.
Five thousand men, it 1b added, occupy
territory along the northern coast, near
Manatee. The Spanish troops have
withdraw to Santiago, Holguin and
Manzanlllo, and General Garcia has es
tablished headquarters at Bayamo.
General Menocal has been obliged to
abandon his contemplated attack on
Holguin, province of Santiago de Cuba,
General Luque of the Spaniards hav
ing thrown 10,000 men into the city and
strongly fortified neighboring hills.
The Cuban military leaders have
been discussing the summer campaign.
They believe five or six thousand men
can well be spared from Santiago
province, where the Spaniards are en
tirely on the defensive, and sent to the
western part of the islands.
CRAMPS TO BUILD A
FLEET FOR RUSSIA
Contracts Awarded for the Construc
tion of Two Battleships and
Ten Torpedo Boats.
PHILADELPHIA, May 31.â -It was
announced to-day that the contract
made by Charles H. Cramp with the
Russian Government is far more com
prehensive than at first supposed. In
stead of merely building two battle
ships the big ship-building yards will
begin work on ten torpedo-boats for
the navy of the White Czar. The total
amount involved in the contract ex
ceeds $15,000,000.
The ships are to be rushed with all
speed possible. Contracts for guns for
this small fleet, it in said, have already
been awarded to th^ Bethlehem Iron
Works. Either that corporation or Car
negie's will furnish armor plate. The
firm, it tfl admitted, has a proposition
for establishing a ship yard in Russia
under consideration. No definite agree
ment has, however, been reached and
that is why stories concerning this
venture are met with denials by the
Cramps.
The first definite announcement on
this subject, it is expected, will ome
from official sources in Russia.
Presidential Nominations.
WASHINGTON, May 31.â The President
to-day sent these nominations to the Sen
ate: Oscar S. Strauss of New York, to
toe Minister to Turkey: James W. David -
Son of Minnesota, to be Conjul at Tamsul,
I nearly forty thousand of the President's
! second call for volunteers.
Inspector General Breekinridge this
! morning reviewed the Third Division
I of the First Corps and the afternoon
! was devoted to regimental and brigade
: inspection of the same division. The
' division presented at review a more sat
isfactory appearance than either the
; First or Second. Inasmuch as the regl
, ments in the Third Division have been
! more generally equipped and uniformed
; than the others. A single line was
formed extending for nearly a mile just
I southeast of Kelly field. The columns
| were then formed by fours. Then fol
j lowed quickly regimental platoons in
! line by companies, the division advanc
! ing thus, 9000 men, with flags flying and
bands playing, to the reviewing stand.
I It was a Bight that warmed the martial
! spirit of the old warriors who wit
nesÃed it, and o officer, in the en
thusiasm of the moment, said that "no
i nation on earth could make such a
showing in thirty days' time."
The Second Nebraska, the Pennsyl
vania and the Ohio regiments to-day
receif^d their pay from their respective
States for the time they were in camp
prior to being mustered into the Gov
ernment service. The amount paid the
Pennsylvania troops is about $90,000;
the payroll of the Ohio troops amount
| Ing to about $150,000, while the Nebras
1 kans only received $3960. The West
Virgina and one regiment of Illinois
j troopÃ are to be paid this week, the
total payroll amounting to about $300,
000.
Major MoKee of the Ninth Penn
sylvania was thrown from his horse
to-day and received serious injuries.
Two 1 ribs were broken and he suffered
other bruises and contusions. George
Schwartz, private, Company B, Fourth
Pennsylvania, of Allentown, died at
I the division hospital to-day of pneu
i mania.
The First Mississippi Infantry, com

mand of Colonel Ge<rrge Govan, ar
rived to-day.
OGDEN, May Sl.â The First Regi
ment, South Dakota Volunteer Infan
try, passed through Ogden for the
Philippines this afternoon. It numbers
1000 men. Colonel A. S. Frost is in
command. Colonel Frost was a first
lieutenant in the Twenty-fifth Infan
try, regular army. The regiment Is
1 well drilled and in excellent condition
las regards health. It marched through
1 the principal streets in company forma
tion. The three trains got out from
here at 7:55 o'clock.
JACKSONVILLE, May 31.â General
Fltzhugh Lee arrived in this city from
Tampa this c ning and his welcome
amounted to an ovation. Hundreds
crowded the station as his train rolled
in and cheer upon cheer greeted him as
ha stepped from the car. No formal
demonstration was attempted as he ex
pressed his strong aversion to such a
welcome. Later in the evening, ac
companied by several members of hia
staff, General Lee paid his respects to
General Miles and his party during
their stay In the city en route to
Tampa.
BRAZIL AND JAPAN
AS NEUTRAL NATIONS
| The Mikado's Proclamation Rather
Remarkable for the Exactness
of Its Rules.
WASHINGTON, May 31.â The Consu
! lar Reports Issued to-day contains some
' additional declarations of neutrality,
J this time from Brazil, Japan, British
! Guiana, St. Lucia and Gibraltar. It is
| noticeable that both Brazil and Japan
; go out of the way of the usual pream
i ble to express regret at the outbreak of
hostilities between the United States
! and Spain. Bermuda modifies her orig
; inal proclamation of April 23 so as to
: make the rule relative to supplying
I provisions, subsistence, coal to bellig-
I erent ships conform closely to the very
j severe English rules on that subject.
The Japanese proclamation is rather
remarkable for the great exactness with
which it prescribes the rules that are to
! govern Japanese subjects in their deal
: ings with the belligerents and as to
| the treatment which will be accorded to
belligerent ships. The proclamation
evidently was prepared with great care
i and may serve as a model for the quid
â  ance of diplomats of all nations.

THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY; JUNE 1, 1898.
LODGE URGES
ANNEXATION
Attempts to Justify His
Course.
PLEA FOR MAJORITY RULE.
â  â  .' â 
WAR REVENUE BILL MAKING
NO HEADWAY.
Senator Elklns Declares This Coun
try Should Retain All Ter
ritory Wrested From
Spain,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 31.
In the Senate to-day Lodge at some
length urged the necessity for Con
gress remaining in session until every
measure that the President desired, in
cluding the Hawaiian annexation, was
passed. He was proceeding to com
ment on Dewey's position and the ne
cessity of supporting him when White
of California and Turple of Indiana
insisted such matters should be dis
cussed in executive session, and the
doors were closed.
When the consideration of the war
revenue bill was resumed Lodge made
his statement concerning his motives
in offering the Hawaiian annexation
resolution as an amendment to the war
revenue measure. In beginning, Lodge
said that as he had no special desire
to speak behind closed doors, he would
not call up the amendment which he
had offered to the pending bill. He
said it was a generally recognized
principle in this country that the ma
jority ought to rule, and that any vio
lation of that principle was a travesty
on justice.
A situation had now arisen, how
ever, in which it was being demonstra
ted that the minority was still ruling,
and in this case it was a minority orig
inally selected by the majority.
Turning to the victory of Admiral
Dewey Mr. Lodge said we were com
pelled to go back as far as Trafalgar
to find a victory more complete and
more sweeping in its results than that
of Admiral Dewey. Now that Dewey
had Manila under his guns and entirely
at his mercy, it was all important, said
Lodge, that we should support him.
The American people would never for
give the administration if it should fail
to give him that support which was
only his just due. They would feel as
did the people of' England when Gordon
| was left to his fate at Khartoum.
Lodge had just announced his belief
that Admiral Dewey was in greater
need of relief than most people Im
agined when he was interrupted by
Turpie, who demanded the .Senate pro
! ceed to the consideration of the sub
ject under discussion in executive ses
sion. Under the rules the demand had
to be acceded to and at 2:05 p. m. the
doors were closed.
At 4:45 p. m. the Senate resumed con
sideration in open session of the pend
ing bill. Elklns (R.) objected to the
tax upon corporations, on bank deposits
and to the stamp tax. He maintained
especially that the tax on deposits was
wrong in principle as it was a tax on
debts. Concerning the corporation tax
he held the tax on gross receiptÃ was
manifestly unjust, as it bore upon
property which the corporations did not
| possess. The net earnings were a
; proper subject of taxation.
Mr. Elkins discussed territorial ex
j pansion. The present war, only a
j month old, had sent the country fur
ther on in the progress of the world
than in a hundred years before. It
had wrought changes in the public
mind, brought on new conditions and
problems and we must look more and
; more to extending our markets for our
! own products, and to that end must
| acquire more territory, than may come
through fortunes of war.
"We must have merchant marine
I ships on the seas, control the shipping
; and commerce on the great oceans that
wash our shores and a navy greater
j and more powerful than any now
j afloat. This is manifest destiny," he
! said.
Mr. Elklns said that because of our
' traditional policy of isolation, and op
: position to acqulrine territory in the
â  past, we must not put aside what
I comes to us by war. The Nicaraguan
( canal and the Hawaiian Islands,
' said he, rise above the horizon and
| come into sight more plainly than
â¢ ever, and whatever opposition therÂ»
I may have been to building one and ac
! quiring the other heretofore must dis
: appear in the face of the flag going up
| over Morro Castle, what has transpired
; in the Philippines and the great trip
of the Oregon.
The Senate, at the conclusion of Mr.
Elkins' speech, agreed to convene at
11 o'clock to-morrow. On motion of
Mr. Allison the Senate at 5:50 went into
executive session and soon afterward
adjourned.
UNALASKA A NEARER
BASE THAN HONOLULU.
Strong Argument Against Annexa
tion Presented by Senator
Pettigrew.
WASHINGTON, May 81.â The Sen-
ate remained In secret cession
for three hours to-day. The entire
time was given to a rather free discus
sion of the Hawaiian question, based
on a motion declaring it to be the sense
of the Senate that annexation should
not be discussed in open session. At
the conclusion of the debate the Senate
voted viva voce not to pursue the Bub
ject further except behind closed doors.
Senator Lodge did not press the sub
ject of his speech after the public was
excluded, but other Senators declared
themselves in favor of prompt action,
the speeches of Chandler and Morgan
being the most pronounced in this di
rection.
Senator Morgan expressed the opin
ion that under the circumstances the
annexation of the Hawaiian Islands
was as much a war measure as any
step that could possibly be taken, and
he thought Congress had remained in
session long enough to pass all war
measures. He paid his respects to
those who preferred adjournment to re
maining here, attending to the coun
try's business.
Senator Chandler contended that the
possession of the islands was a military
necessity. He dwelt upon the fact that
Hawaii afforded practically the only
stopping place between our shores and
the Philippine Islands.
Other speeches favorable to annexa
tion were made by Senators 3tewart
and Elkins, and Senator Allison, acting
chairman of the Finance Committee, in
timated a willingness to take up the
Hawaiian question after the passage of
the war revenue bill.
. "Let us/ said lie, "finish tbia bill ani
Llien if necessary take up the Hawaiian
qutetion."
He made a plea against Involving
one subject with the other.
Senators i'ettigrew and White were
antagonistic to annexation and Senator
Hale announced himself favorable to
ilnal adjournment after the passage of
the war revenue bill and necessary ap
propriation bills.
Pettigrew devoted himself especially
to Senator Chandler's declaration that
the acquisition of the islands was a
necessity of war. He contended that
such was not the case and argued that
Unalaska, a town within our own
borders, was a far more desirable stop
ping point for ships bound to the Orient
from San Francisco than Honolulu
could be. He said Honolulu and Una
laska were each about 2100 miles from
San Francisco, but that while Hono
lulu was more than 4900 miles distant
from Manila Unalaska was only a little
j over 4100 miles.
"Why," he asked, "did not our Gov
ernment, in view of this difference in
distance, in view of the saving of two
days' time, store her coal at Unalaska
Instead of Honolulu? Why, if it was
not in anticipation of the raising of this
cry of necessity In order to force us
into acquiesence as to the acquisition
of the islands as a war measure, when
it was known that annexation could
nut be accomplished In time of peace."
Senator White thought he saw in the
effort to secure Hawaiian annexation
at this time a desire to establish pre
cedent for future proceeding in other
cai:es, and said the matter should be
postponed until after the war ai.d all
eft >rts at annexation considered to
gether. He thought that if our princi
pal object had been that of securing
a coaling station, we should have forti
fied Pearl Harbor, but as this had not
been done, it was evident that we must
have other designs.
Senator Lodge said after the conclu
sion of the secret session thnt he ac
complished his purpose in calling at
tention to the necessity for action on
this subject before final adjournment,
and that he would not further press the
subject in connection with the war
revenue bill.
â¢
HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.
Life-Saving Stations to Be Kept Open
During June and July.
"WASHINGTON, May 31.â The House
to-day adopted a concurrent resolu
tion directing the commission now
codifying the criminal laws to prepare
and submit a code of civil law and
procedure for Alaska.
A number of private bills were
passed and the House in committee of
the whole considered a bill authorizing
the Secretary of the Treasury to keep
open during June and July this year
such life-saving stations on the At
lantic and Gulf coasts as he might
deem advisable. The bill was urged
by the Secretary of the Navy as pro
viding for the continuance for the
months named of an important adjunct
to the naval and co.ast signal service
in making efficient the patrol service.
After some desultory discussion the
bill was amended to carry $70,000, In
stead of ;i25.0n0, and passed.

CANNOT FIX
WATER RATES
Legal Opinion Affecting
Los Angeles.
OLD CONTRACTS STILL VALID
SCHEDULE CREATED IN 1868
HOLDS GOOD.
City's Agreement With the Water
Company Thirty Years Ago De
clared to Be Yet in
Effect.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 31â In the
United States District Court to-day
Judge Wellborn delivered an opinion
particularly important in its local
bearing, though to all lawyers its
significance and interest may be great.
The case concerned was the resist
ance of the City Water Company to the
enforcement and existence of a city
ordinance, passed by the Council, fixing
rates to be paid by water consumers
in the city. In February, 1897, the City
Council fixed a table of rates to go into
effect in July of the same year, a pro
ceeding which that body is required by
law to do. The idea was to reduce
rates materially. The water company
decidedly objected to the reduction
and proceeded to fight the ordinance,
asking that the city be enjoined from
enforcing it and that it be held as void.
The case was gotten into the Federal
court on the plea that the ordinance
was unconstitutional, as it would im
pair a contract, the contract in this
case being that of 1868, which was
made between the city and the water
company, giving the latter the right to
supply the city with water, and provid
ing that rates to be charged at any
time should not be less than those
charged in that year â IS6B.
The city sÂ«t up a number of pleaa,
five in all, one of which was that the
contract was invalid, in that it was
contrary to public policy; that its term
of existence, thirty years, was unreas
onable, and that rates made by ordi
nance would allow a fair return upon
their investment.
All of these claims were overruled
by the Judge. He decided that the
term of the contract's existence -was
not unfair, apparently holding that be
cause the city got its water for fire
purj.jses free It did not bring the con
tract within the purview of those de
cisions which have held that similar
contracts were unreasonably long,
which were in cases where the cities
concerned had to pay very largs sums
yearly for their fire hydrants.
The contention of the city, that the
municipality at the time the contract
was made, had no legal right to make
It, was overruled. Another claim of
the city was that the contract origi
nally was made for ten inches of water,
but that the company had for pome
time been taking out 400 inches, which,
it was argued, invalidated the whole
contract; but the Judge held that the i
city having acquiesced In the increase
ul" the amuur.t of water taken, It could
not cnme in now and plead that In der
ogation of contract.
The amount of the whole opinion is,
that the Judge holds the contract of
I*6s is valid In all respects, and that
the city has no right to make water
rates less than th^y were in the year
the contract was made.
TO RUSH THE WORK ON
NEW BATTLESHIPS
Purchasing Yachts for the Auxiliary
Fleet â To Test a Seattle Tor-
pedo Boat.
"WASHINGTON, May 31.â The Board
of Naval Bureau Chiefs is trying to
hasten the work of construction of. the
battle-ships authorized by the present
naval appropriation bill. The Illinois
type, upon which the new vessels are to
be constructed, will occupy three years
In construction. After a conference
to-day the bureau chiefs, presumably
with the knowledge of the construc
tive ability of the American shipyards
capable oÂ£ undertaking this work, re-
BOlved to reduce the time allowed for
building the new ships to a maximum
<-f thirty-two months.
The Navy Department bought an
>ther yacht to-day- the Inquirerâ at
N'.-w York for use in the auxiliary
ileet. Other purchases are in prospect,
but the final selection of the dozen ves
sels to be purchased from the eligible
list of over 100 supplied by the examin
ing board has not be*n made.
The torpedo-boat Rowan, built at
Seattle by Moran Bros., has now been
reported "ready for trial, and instruc
tions were sent to the department to
day to run the trip on Friday in Puget
Sound. _
PEACE UNION EVICTED.
No Longer Occupies Quarters in the
"Cradle of Liberty."
PHILADELPHIA, May 31.â The Univer
sal Peace Union no longer occupies quar

tory demand of Chief Eisenhower of the
Bureau of City Property, which was sent
to President Love on Saturday, request-
Ing the Peace Union to vacate the
"Cradle of Liberty," was complied wfth
to-day The trouble arose over the let
ter written by the Peace Union people to
Premier Sagasta and the Queen Regent
of Spain urging further concessions by
Spain to the United States In order to
terminate the war.

LOS ANGELISS, May 31.â The weekly
crop bulletin for Southern California pie
pared by Observer Franklin, for the week
ending May 30. says; Corn, alfalfa arid
root crepe are looking well; bean planting
is in progress. The deciduous fruit pros

state that oranges are not developing
fast, probably on account of the cool
diimy weather, but the trees are full of
fruit which seems to be healthy though
srraller than usual at this time of tha
year.

PHILIPPINE TARIFF.
Existing Spanish Schedules Will Be
Practically Unchanged.
NEW YORK, May 31.â A special to
the Times from Washington says: As
a result of the investigation the Treas
ury Department has been making into
the question of a tariff for the Philip
pines, to be levied as a military con
tribution during the occupation of the
islands by the United States forces, the
administration has practically decided
to enforce the existing Spanish sched
ules, with only such changes as the cir
cumstances may make necessary. As
the import taxes will not be increased,
as American merchants will have no
advantage over those of other coun
tries, and as there will undoubtedly be
an improvement in the administration
with regard to honesty and progress,
the commercial worki of the far East,
it is pointed out. will have nothing to
complain of as a result of the change
of masters in the Philippines.
TO ORGANIZE CAVALRY.

WASHINGTON, May 31.â Senator
Pettigrew to-day Introduced a bill to

Yankton, S. D., as colonel, he to be au
thorized under the direction of the Sec
retary of War to enlist and equip
twelve troops of light cavalry for two
years or more for special service in the
Philippines. The command is to be
armed with rapid-firing rifles, guns and
revolvers. The troops are to consist of
not less than sixty nor more than
eighty-four officers and men. Two hun
dred and twenty-five thousand dollars
is appropriated to carry the bill into
effect.
STUART TIRES OF TALK.
Wants Fitzsimmons and Corbett to
Change Tactics.
NEW YORK, May 31,.â There will be
no match between Corbett and Fitz
simmonÃ so far as "Dan" Stuart is
concerned, unless the big pugilists
change tactics. Stuart wants some
thing more substantial from the prin
cipals than newspaper challenges be
fore he offers a purse for a contest
between Bob and Jim. This was gath-
from an interview with. Stuart oÂ»
his arrival from the West to-day. Stu-i
art said he was quite willing to offer a
I purse for the match, but could not be
convinced that the match was posslbla
until the men each posted a forfeit.

HONGKONG, May 31.â The Span-.
' lards are busy fortifying the shore at
i Manila, recalling all field guns from
â  landwards. Engineer and artillery of-Â»
! fleers have little faith in these de-Â«
j fenses against the heavy American,
guns, but the infantry still professes
1 ability to hold the city. Strangely
j enough the defenses, on the Cavite sida
( are neglected.
Letters continue reassuring, but tha
anti-British feeling is keener among
the lower classes. A price has beea
set upon Aguinaldo, dead oc alive.
NO MEXICAN DOLLARS.
American Coin for the Troops Senft

WASHINGTON, May 31.â Paymas-.
ter-General Stanton of the army au
thorizes a specific denial of the reported
negotiations for the acquisition of a
large number of Mexican dollars for
the payment of the troops to be sent
to the Philippines. There is no desire
on the part of the Government to pay
its soldiers in depreciated coin and they
will be paid in gold and silver of the
United States.

A MATTER OF SELF-DEFENSE.
THE necessity for calling attention to the Ex
aminer is not pleasing. As the circulation of
that paper goes up in the smoke of the garbage
crematory it calls attention to itself. But occasionally
there is no escape from directing notice to the shame
less and harmful course of the weakly twin of the
Hearst pair. This becomes, in fact, a matter of self
defense.
Ever since the soldiers have been gathering at this
point the Examiner has used every endeavor to stir
up among them a spirit of discontent. It has ac
cepted the word of the inevitable grumbler and has
employed it in an effort to show that the volunteers
are on the edge of revolt. That such a statement is
an indecent slander matters nothing to the Examiner.
It would rather lie than be truthful, and its delight is
to make trouble. It has portrayed the men as ready
to mutiny, when, in fact, no such thought was in the
minds of any of them. When underwear was sent
to the Kansas regiment there were a few men not
supplied because of the lack of proper sizes. The
misfit garments were stored in officers' quarters so
as to be exchanged. The Examiner seized the chance
to say that the soldiers were not being clothed, not
withstanding the clothing had been supplied. Of
course the statement was a lie, and of course the
ExamineT knew it This was a sufficient reason for
giving it credence and publicity.
The results are likely to be serious to the soldiers
and to decent papers as well as to the Hearstling.
The officers are disgusted, and properly so, with the
seditious tone of the reeking Examiner. They do
not want the men to see it. But to discriminate is
a matter of some delicacy. There is a possibility
that because of the deliberate and malign lying of
the Examiner all papers may be barred from camp.
It is for this reason that attention is called to the
daily Garbage. The Call does not desire to suffer for
the sins of that sheet, intolerable to decency in and
out of the newspaper world, without going on record
as protesting against the unpatriotic, unAmerican,
untruthful and shameless course of its contemporary.
It wishes the soldiers to know that the Examiner
represents nothing, that it is the pervert of journal
ism, with the morals of an outcast and the influence
of a zephyr from Butchertown.
THE GHOST OF THE COUMO.
PERHAPS this man Schwerin of the Pacific
Mail is not wholly to blame for his present con
duct. It may be that he has gone daft. It was
in May, 1895, that the overladen Colima steamed out
of this port. The vessel had many passengers and a
deckload which made her unwieldy. Off the coast of
Mexico she went down and 100 lives were swallowed
up in the Pacific. The Colima had a good captain.
The pathos of his death has not been forgotten. Pos
sibly even Schwerin remembers it. The captain had
a habit when he sailed out of the Golden Gate of
saluting his wife, who always stood at the most sea
ward point. He did this by means of a whistle.
And as the ship went down he blew the three blasts
which had been her salute and farewell. Yes,
Schwerin must recall the circumstance. It may be
that in the night he is visited still by the ghost of the
Colima.
Or it may be that Schwerin, having sent the City of
Peking out carrying California's brave boys crowded
like convicts in a galley, is now undergoing compunc
tions of conscience and does not know what is the
matter with him. He wants to fit up the China in the
same way, and set a thousand more boys afloat,
thinking that if the newspapers say nothing about it
the world will never know. So he has Issued an or
der that no Call man shall be permitted upon the dock
where is in progress the shameless work of prepar
ing another ocean prison for the other brave boys
who have come to this shore ready for what may
befall.
No wonder that Schwerin tries to be exclusive.
No wonder that he would hide from the world his
cruelty. He may be monarch of the dock and king
of all the teredoes, but he cannot keep the truth from
the public. We have all the sympathy for him that
he deserves. We know that to be haunted by the
wraith of a ship and a hundred dead is no small
thing. It is not even pleasant to realize that a ship
now on the sea crowded with American citizens is
approaching the tropics, where malady threatens, and
that they are jammed into the hold like freight.
Schwerin has all these things to think about, poor
man, and yet he will have more to think about if he
be permitted to have his own way with the China.
By exposing him we really protect him against future
misery. And he does not appreciate the fact and
orders that reporters be kept away. There is some
thing wrong with Schwerin.
A few days ago Â« contemporary asked, "Where
rolls the Oregon?" The Oregon, dear sir, does not
roll. It is net built that way.
THE MAN FOR GOVERNOR.
DURING the convention of league clubs there
will doubtless be much discussion, although
perhaps informal, as to the man whom the Re
publicans shall select for Governer. Men from all
parts of the State will exchange views, and while Re
publicans are united it is well to bear in mind the fact
that in the coming campaign success must depend
upon the character of the candidate. A weak man, a
man known to be subservient to corporation influence,
would be defeated. A strong man, independent, fear
less, honest, would be elected. Under the circum
stances a choice must be made with unusual care.
There is no lack of good material.
The time is too early now for naming the indi
vidual, but not for considering the qualities he must
possess. Above all he must be free from railroad
affiliations and of clean record. People this year will
not vote for any man who is suspected even remotely
of taking orders from the Southern Pacific or of
being capable of giving to that institution any form
of pledge as to his conduct The man demanded by
the needs of the hour is one who will do nis whole
duty to the State, and being approached by railroad
emissaries be ready in requesting them to go about
their business, which is in no measure the direction
of the State's affairs.
On the other hand, the aspirant who poses as a
hater of corporations and loudly denounces them all
as thieves and robbers is apt to be dangerous to the
public welfare, or to be insincere. There are plenty
of men of the proper sort. The duty of the party is
to find one. Perhaps he will not be a politician, or
one known nowto be seeking the office. It maybe that
he will be picked out by reason of ability displayed
in private life, for executive capacity, for his known
integrity and his freedom from association with the
railroad.
Certain it is that if the Republicans nominate a
man in whose past there has been the least railroad
taint they will fail to elect him. By a judicious nomi
nation they will undoubtedly be able to carry the
State.
THE OMAHA EXPOSITION.
OMAHA is just as patriotic as any city in the
Union, her people take as keen an interest as
any in the events of the war, they were as ex
ultant as the rest of us over the victory at Manila, and
have made as many guesses at the whereabouts of
the Spanish fleet in the West Indies. Nevertheless
they keep one eye and a portion of their minds firmly
fixed on their exposition, and proudly proclaim that
next after the volunteer army it is the biggest thing
in the nation.
As soon as Congress declared war Omaha issued a
manifesto announcing that it would not interfere with
her exposition. She called attention to the safety of
her position in the middle of the continent, out of
reach of Spanish guns and flying squadrons, and in
vited all the sea coast people of the republic to spend
the summer at her show. Since then she has repeat
edly sent out similar notices, and it may be accepted
as a fact that the war has not in any degree interfered
with Omaha.
From all reports the exposition is one of which the
city and the whole district around may be proud. The
display from California will not be so good as it
should have been, but Omaha does not seem to notice
the fact, probably because she is unaware how very
grand that display could have been made had we done
our best. There will be enough from California at
any rate to prove that we are in the Union and that
we have minerals and fruits both rich and rare. This
will be sufficient to save the show from our point of
view, and for the rest everything looks promising.
One of the notable features of the reports sent out
from time to time concerning the progress of the
preparations for the exposition is the information
given of the liberal way in which the enterprise has
been supported by the great railways of the Mississip
pi Valley. These corporations seem to have vied with
one another in promoting the undertaking, and will
doubtless continue to do so as long as it remains
open. They have contributed generously and will
grant low rates of fares so as to attract visitors.
Omaha is lucky.
The success which has attended this enterprise will
encourage us in the movement to surpass it with a
Californian and Pacific Coast exposition in commem
oration of the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of
gold. As all the States adjoining Nebraska have taken
an active and prominent part in making that exposi
tion a true presentation of the natural wealth and in
dustrial accomplishments of that large section of the
Union, so we may expect a similar support from all
the States and Territories of the Greater West. We
have therefore an interest in the Omaha exhibition of
no small magnitude, and there will be no little gratifi
cation over every report which makes it evident that
even the outbreak of war has not disturbed the course
of the exposition nor prevented it from proving profit
able as well as instructive.
Now the soldiers can ride between the Presidio and
the city without aying fare. This is due to a gracious
and considerate act on the part of the Union and
O'Farrell car companies. The first set the example
and the second quickly followed. The example is still
available for the guidance and uplifting of Mr. Vining.
Some malicious individual started a report that
$1000 given by the Red Cross to the Kansas regiment
had been stolen. As no such sum, nor any other
6um, has been given to the Kansas regiment, the re
port is of no value save in being just about the sort
of lie to be regarded by the Examiner as useful.
Spaniards are having much joy in the celebration of
victories which have not occurred and never will. It
is a wonder they are not printing pictures of the Capi
tol at Washington flying the colors of Castile. If
they would find pleasure in it they might as well go
ahead and have a good time.
From all indications there is to be a third call for
troops. This will have the effect of urging responses
to the second call, as those to enroll later will prob
ably be kept at home and have no duty to perform
save the routine of garrison.
Cervera's maneuvers were adroit enough while they
lasted, but the object of sailing into a trap has not yet
been explained. If his ultimate intention was to com
mit a fatal error he could have carried it out without

THE SAIST FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 1, 1398.
NIHILISTS, ANARCHISTS AND SO
CIALISTS.
IN his speech against restriction of immigration,
which we have quoted, Judge Maguire offered a
conspicuous example of habitual loose thinking and
erroneous generalization. He dumps Nihilists, An
archists and Socialists together. The principle and
purpose of socialism is directly opposed to anarchy
and nihilism.- They believe in a violent leveling by
force. They inculcate and practice assassination. The
murder of Lincoln, Carnot, the Czar and Canovas
was in line with their policy.
Lincoln abolished slavery in the United States.
Canovas in the Spanish possessions, and the Czar lib
erated the Russian serfs. They were all murdered.
In their character of emancipators they were re
spected by socialism, but not by anarchy and nihilism.
The Socialists pursue the paths of peace. Their policy
is altruistic, and though their benevolent philosophy
is probably founded upon an estimate of man that is
too high to be realized, they do not believe that
human misery can be lessened by increasing it. They
oppose war and teach the benevolent brotherhood of
man. These millennial views are in precise contrast
to the violent cult of anarchy and nihilism. Social
ism seeks a peaceful revolution, a change in the social
state worked on the lines of reason and enlighten
ment. It hopes for the ideal man and seeks not to
destroy, but to humanize institutions of government.
To mix these gentle philosophers and altruistic
dreamers with the poisoners and bomb-throwers is
characteristic of the man who could see no difference
between a naval officer and a pirate, between the
calm adjudication of a prize court and the scuttling of
a merchant ship.
Socialism violates neither moral nor statute law.
Anarchy and nihilism oppose both. Socialism
claims affinity with a most refined view of Christian
ity. Anarchy and nihilism reject Christianity and re
gard religion as a potent means of enslaving mankind.
If the dream of socialism were realized by a change
in the tendency of human nature and in that nature
itself, the foundation of the new order would not be
upon the ruins of life and institutions destroyed by
violence. " There is no peril in the dream nor the
principles upon which it is based. The wild purpose
of anarchy and nihilism, if accomplished, would as
completely nullify evolution as socialism does, but
would also ruin and refuse the rebuilding of all that is.
Human society argues with socialism. It sends
anarchy and nihilism to jail and gibbet. They have
struck a foul blow at institutions in this country and
were punished in return. They break law. Socialism
obeys it.
This marked difference escaped Judge Magufre, as
it does other superficial observers, who, like him, are
in the habit of dumping the reasonable and unreason
able critics of the social state into one mass and either
opposing or supporting them as a whole, without re
gard to their irreconcilable and organic differences.
BY proclamation of the President a reciprocity
treaty with France, the first which has been
arranged under the new tariff, goes into effect
this morning. It has been hailed at Washington with
satisfaction as an evidence of the friendly commercial
relations between the two nations, and doubtless will
be as well received throughout the country.
The Dingley tariff provides two methods of ar
ranging treaties of commercial reciprocity. By one
of these, set forth in section 3, the President is author
ized to act alone; by that in section 4he can act only
with the advice and consent of the Senate. In the
first place his power to reduce duties provided by the
tariff is limited to a comparatively few articles of com
merce and the amount of the reduction is also pre
scribed to narrow limits. The French treaty has been
arranged under section 3, and therefore is not subject
to supervision on the part of the Senators.
The only articles on which the President under this
clause could reduce duties are argols, brandies or
other spirits manufactured or distilled from grain or
other materials; champagne and all other sparkling
wines; still wines, vermouth, paintings, pastels, ink
drawings and statuary. The treaty grants to the
French the full reduction allowed by the law on all
of these with the exception of that on champagne.
In return we receive a reduction of French duties on
meats of all kinds, fruits and wood exports.
The chief advantages gained by the United States
are on meat products and lard compounds, the reduc
tion of the French duty on the first being half and
on the second one-third of the present rate. The main
advantages given to France in return for these are
the reduction of duties on her exports of still wines
and brandies. It will be seen that the beef and pork
producing States of the Union make an almost clear
gain by the treaty, while the wine-producing States
pay the cost and obtain bAit little in return.
It is not certain what will be the effect of the new
arrangement upon the industries and commercial in
terests of California, but the chances are it will
prove more or less injurious. We have but little in
the way of pork or lard or canned meat to send to
France, while the amount of our fruits and woods
which she may consume is not likely to be large. On
the other hand, the lessened duty on the vast amount
of still wine she will send to the Eastern States may
prove a serious competition to our wine interests and
more than counterbalance the gains we obtain in
other respects.
These drawbacks to the treaty are inherent in the
nature of the subject itself. The United States are
so large and have such a variety of industrial interests
that a commercial arrangement which helps one sec
tion is almost sure to injure another. This
time it is California that loses and the East that gains.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the Presi
dent had no option in the selection of the articles on
which the reduction was to be made. That was fixed
by the tariff itself.
At the time the bill was unaer discussion The Call
directed attention to this clause and urged Western
men to see to it that something else besides wines
and brandies and works of art were included in the
scope of Presidential treaties of reciprocity, but
nothing was done. There remains for us now, there
fore, nothing but to make the best of the situation.
Fortunately the amount of the reduction on wine im
ports is not large, and perhaps our wine men may
! still command good prices for their products despite
the advantage given to their French competitors.
The Klondiker who is afraid to ship his gold lest
the Spanish capture it is too far irom civilization to

THE FRENCH TREATY.
THE ERA OF BROTHERLY LOVE.
ON the 21st inst., at Baltimore. Md.,
a demonstration took place credita
ble to human nature, and, historic
ally considered, unique. On that
day the Sixth Massachusetts Regi
ment passed through the streets of Bal
timore, cheered by enthusiastic thou
sands and honored by the welcome of a
great city. This was the "historic Mas
sachusetts Sixth" which was stoned in
the streets of Baltimore thirty-seven
j'ears ago the 19th of April, when on its
way to Washington. The Baltimoreans
and the Massachusetts soldiers fully un
derstood and fully appreciated the greet
ing which was extended at this latter ap
pearance. Doubtless at the coming cele
bration of Memorial day the episode will
figure In orations spoken over battle
fields of the "sixties." where the wearers
of the blue and wearers of the gray Bleep
forever.
The newspapers of Boston and the
newspapers of Baltimore make much of
the affair. The Boston Herald pictures
on one page the scene of the first blood
shed on Pratt street, Baltimore, In 1861,
and an old print showing the deadly at
tack upon the Massachusetts volunteers
of 1861, and as a companion piece "the
great demonstration at Mount Royal sta
tion in Baltimore on the arrival of the
Sixth in 1*98." In the last mentioned pic
ture the Baltimoreans are waving scores
of American flags, throwing hats In air,
and otherwise demonstrating good will
and forgiveness. And the Baltimore
American editorially Bays!
"Baltimore and Boston, Maryland and
FLORAL DESIGN PRESENTED TO THE BOSTON TROOPS BY BALTIMORE
Massachusetts, are more than allitera
tions; they are very loving members of
a big family, and whenever they meet
there Is an outburst of I"* For over
twenty years they have been reuniting
and celebrating the reunions, and if
these Incidents have been repeated, It has
only been to make the pleasure the great
er and the friendship the stronger. A3
far as these two cities and these two
States are concerned, the unpleasantness
of 1861 was long ago settled; but yester
day offered a dramatic opportunity which
could not be passed over. It was a temp
tation to show the Yankees a fine town,
and to applaud them, and to let the
bursting patriotism of tha streets enjoy
a full outlet.
"People who remember the past realize
perfectly well that the troublo about the
former visit of the Sixth Massachusetts
to Baltimore was due to the work of
hoodlums, who infest every center of
population. Maryland, although com
pelled to do so by no law, made a hand
some appropriation for the families of
the victims, and this was gracefully re
ceived and acknowledged by Massachu
settsâa fact that is lost sight of in all
accounts of the unfortunate episode. But
still more has been done since to wipe
away the recollection. And yesterday
the climax came. It was superb. Never
were men more enthusiastically received.
The whole city spoke. It opened its heart
and its lungs sent echoes of gladness to
the stars. The air danced In glee, and the
Hag waved until a cyclone was threaten
ed. It was fervent, unanimous, delirious
and fine. And Baltimore rejoices that it
was so."
Let the Bostonians tell the remainder
of the story, writing from Baltimore, as
follows:
"No Massachusetts man could view with
undlmmed eyes the spectacle afforded
In this proud city to-day, when its citi
zens, putting everything else aside, turned
out to cheer the 'historic Sixth Massa
chusetts,' which same regiment was
stoned in the struts of Baltimore thirty
seven years ago the 19th of April.
"Some of the same men who threw
bricks and stones at the Massachusetts
soldiers in '01 formed an escort for our
boys to-day, and the sacred sentiment
that sways a united people ruled the
day.
"It was a history-mnking day. No onÂ«
who saw it could fail to understand its
full meaning. It mfant that .sectional
strife and hatred are buried; yes, buried
forever. It meant that we are all Amer
icans and that the Civil War is history.
"It almost made one glad that we were
at war to see this whole city rise up to
welcome the men whose fathers they
mobbed. Old Confederate soldiers were
almost trnmpled under the foot of the
horses in trying to grasp the hand of
Colonel Woodward and his staff, and the
women of Baltimore, whose beauty is
known the world over, showered our
boys with flowers. The mÂ»n gave them
something more substantial.
"Senator Lodge and Representative
Moody and I came over to Baltimore
from Washington to meet the regiment,
and met It as It was? coming up North
Charles street. The regiment was late
In reaching Baltimore, and 10,000 persons
were at Mount Royal station â when it
came in. They had waited there since
noon.
"Mayor Malster welcomed our boys on
behalf of the o ity, and Colonel Woodward
made a brief but handsome acknowledg
ment. Then the line was formed and the
regiment marched to the Camden sta
tion. Permission for the regiment to do
this had been secured by Senator Lodge
yesterday, at the request of Colonel
Woodward, in response to the invitation
of the city of Baltimore.
"As all the Maryland troops were
away at the front, or In camp, an escort
had been made up of a detachment of
firemen, a battalion of clerks and city
employes, and a company of Confederate
veterans. These men led the march
through many of the same streets of Bal
timore where the regiment was stoned
in '61.
"The Sixth, in heavy marching order, -
looked business-like and soldierly. There
were no frills or gold lace about it, and
that made it all the more imposing:. No
better troops ever marched through Bal
timore. Praise was In every one's
mouth. The company of negroes in the
regiment was cheered and praised by
these Baltimoreans as much as any
body, and this in Itself was a little un
usual.
"On they marched, soldierly, to the
Camden station of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad. Into this same station
thirty-seven years nun the 'old Sixth'
marched after its fight in the streets or
the city and took the train for Wash
ington.
"Our hoys marched in this evening, but
how different the scene! Our own drums
and fifes played 'Pixie' as the regiment
came Into the station, amid the cheers
and 'rebel yells' of the people of Balti
more.
"This was. indeed, the crowning feature
of this great historical episode â our own
boys marching to the tune which General
Sherman once said we 'captured." Buc
there was none of that feeling to-day in
the minds of the men who heard it, or in
the hearts of the men who marched to
lta strains,
"Senator Lod*e, after the regiment had
passed by. sala, huskily: 'This 1b one
of the irreatest daya of my life.' HÂ«
Bpoks for ManÃÂ«.ehuiottÃ when he said It."
Baltimore did more than cheer. The
Mayor, In behalf of the citizens, presented
Colonel Woodward, a large set piece of I
roses bearing three streamers of patin ,
ribbon, one red, one white and one blue, j
The streamers were lettered as follows:
"Maryland honors Massachustts, May j
21 1898 ' '
"God bless you, and bring you Bafely j
"Baltimore welcomes Sixth Massachu
setts Regiment. Flowers not bullets. _
During the progess of the Mayor s ,
speech Tie was frequently Interrupted by I
bursts of applause, and at its conclusion ,
the applause and cheers were hearty and |
sustained. . .. . 4
Colonel Woodward stepped to the front
of the balcony and mado the following
response: . _ ...
"Mayor Malster and Citizens, of Balti
more: No feeble words that I can utter
would express the thanks and gratifica
tion which the Sixth Regiment owes you
for the glorious reception which you have
given us here this afternoon. This mag
nificent reception not only does honor to
the Sixth Regiment, but to Massachusetts i
and New England as well, and expresses
the good feeling prevailing between Mas- ,
eachusetts and Maryland and between the ;
North and the South. _ |
"One benefit which we shall derive from
thlfl war will be that it will cement the
bonds between sections and make us all
one people, from the groat lakes to the
Gulf of Mexico and from ocean to ocean,
united in one common cause against a |
C0 "Thanking you again most heartily for
your most cordial greeting, I bid you
adieu, and may God be with you until
we meet again." , j
The colonel's speech was applauded
heartily, and at its close three cheers and j
a tiger were given for the Sixth, which |
the Doys returned with interest for the !
city of Baltimore.
After a few more rounds of cheers and a
few more words with the girls the regi
ment was called to "attention," and the
parade was formed.
In the procession, amongr the various
bodies composing it, were a squad of
fifty Confederate veterans and "a squad
of fifteen original stone throwers who
participated in the riot of 1861," accord- i
ing to the Boston Herald's account. The :
Mayor of Baltimore said to the Massachu- !
setts soldiers the following
"Soldiers of the Sixth Regiment, Mas
sachusetts Volunteer Infantry: I join in
tne general rejoicing of the people of ;
Baltimore that the deferred opportunity !
of thirty-seven years has at last arrived
and 1, for and in behalf of the people
of our beloved city, tender you the wel
come, freedom, hospitality and protection
of this city. The latchstrings not only ;
hang on the outside of the doors, but the
doors of the citizens of our dear old city
are wide open, and their arms are out
stretched and eager to receive and do
honor to those who have inherited the
legacy of the old Sixth Massachusetts i
Regiment. Their deeds of valor on many â 
hard-fought fields can only be told by the
historian.
"The citizens of this city will never
enjoy a greater degree of pleasure than
in meeting this splendid body of soldiers
On their return to the bosom of their
families, with each of their names em
t>iaznm-d high upon the scroll of honor
in letters wrought there with patriotic
and loyal actions of their individual
worth that will never bring shame â¢or
blush to their posterity."
During the march, so reports the Boston
Herald, rebel yells were heard, and one
old, gray-haired man in frunt of the
City Hall shouted: "I'm an old-time reb ,
but I'm with you this time, boys."
On Cathedral street, opposite the ca
thedral,- several ladies in the upper win
dows of a large brick house were singing
"The Red, White and Blue."
Never before has a Massachusetts or
any other regiment received such an
ovation away from home, and very sel
dom at home. The cheering was inces
sant.
Several times the regimental fife and
drum corps struck up "Dixie," and then
the crowds were wild. Men threw up
their hats and yelled, women waved their
handkerchiefs and screamed, and even
children caught the fever of excitement.

THE assembling yesterday of the
delegates to the first biennial
convention of State Republican
League Clubs may be considered
the real beginning of the politi
cal campaign of 189$. The acts of the
â¢anvpntion are destined to affect in a
greater or lesser degree the chances of
some scores of would-be candidates who
have made early bids for public favor
and will make manifest in a manner
the- wishes of the Republicans of the
State as to the attitude of the party
on such questions of public interest as
will be brought to the attention of the
voters at the coming election.
Though the deliberations of the con
vention are but just begun one import
ant fact has already been demon
strated. It is that corporation influ
ences are to have no part in determin
ing the issues of the coming campaign.
This is a matter that has received early
and unofficial attention because the
corporation boss-s have seen fit to per
mit their wishes in the matter to be
come known.
This attempt on the part of the cor
porations to influence the acts of the
.invention is being frowned upon by a
majority of the delegates because they
(Malm to see in it an effort to disrupt
the party and to bow discord in the
convention that has for its purpoec no
other object than that of strengthening
the party organization. Those among
the delegates who are reckoned among
the party leaders are also aware that
It Is the Intention of the corporation
bosses to bring about the breaking of
a pledge made almost four years ago
and which Is held by them to be bind
ing on the party in the sense in which
it was given. The pledge referred to is
that given to the Republicans south of
the Tehachapi line at the time they
pledged their votes in the Legislature to
secure the election of Senator Perkins.
The promise then given was that the
next Republican Senator should be a
man selected from the Republicans of
the southern portion of the State.
It so happens that the leading and
logical candidate of the southern Re
publicans is not a corporation man
and for this reason the corporations
would like to see the pledge ignored, so
that they could bring forward a can
didate from the northern portion of
the State who would do their bidding.
To bring about this result they have
perfected a plan that has progressed
so far that its influence was felt in
every proceeding Incident to the acts
of the convention yesterday. The ob
ject hoped for is to so influence the con
vention that the north will be arrayed
against the south. When this object
shall have been attained a resolution
will be offered declaring it to be the
sense of the convention that no par
ticular section of the State be recog
nized as having a claim to the nominee
for Governor or th>i candidate for
United States Senator.
The permanent organization of the
convention has not yet been effected,
yet bo strong Is the pressure that has
been brought to bear on the corpora
tion delegates that the lines are al
ready strongly drawn and delegation
Is arrayed against delegation. Frank
D. liyan and Grove L. Johnson of Sac
ramento are the leaders of the cor
poration forces In the delegation from
the Second Congressional District,
which has been selected as the stand
ard bearer of the forces that are out
In opposition to the candidacy of R.
N. Bulla for Senator. Many of I?he
delegates from the Fourth and Fifth
Congressional districts have also been
whipped Into line and the corporations
have a few votes among those dele
gates who have their residence in the
northern portion of the Seventh Dis
trict. This comprises the corporation
strength in the convention.
The Sixth Congressional District
delegation, with the exception of a few
members who are either in the pay of
the railroad or have been ensnared by
the po-litical flirtations of Henry Gage,
whose acts are inspired by the corpor
ation bosses for the purpose of furth
ering the scheme that is now being
worked out, is solid for any proposal
that will insure for the Republicans of
the southern portion of the State the
pelection of the Senatorial candidate.
The same is true of the Seventh Dis
trict delegation. The delegation from
the Third District will join hands with
the men from the south because by so
doing they will ward off any
contemplated injury to the gu
bernatorial aspirations of Dr. Par
dee and ex-Mayor Davis. If the party
is pledged to support a southern man
for Senator, the pledge will carry with
It a stipulation that the candidate for
Governor shall come from the north
ern part of the State. For this reason
the friends of Brown, Pardee, Davis,
Flint, Barnes, Dickinson, Fitzgerald,
Ellert and others who have a desire to
head the ticket at the next election will
stand In to defeat the plans of the cor
poration deleg-ates. The delegation from
the First Congressional District will
also vote with the southern men.
Those delegates from the Fourth and
Fifth districts who do not wear the
corporation collar will support any
proposition that will promote har
mony.
The friends of R. N. Bulla declare
that now that the corporations have
come forward in an evident attempt
to defeat their candidate even at the
expense of wrecking the party, it is a
plain indication as to .the course the
Republicans of the State should pur
sue. It means, they say, that the Re
publican party, which has always
stood for all that is good in political
government, must either come out with
a frank acknowledgment that it is to
be owned and controlled by the cor
poration bosses, or it must declare in
unmistakable terms that the influence
of the corporations is not to be per
mitted, and that corporation candi
dates need not expect to receive recog
nition at the State convention.
They believe that the present con
vention is a representative organiza
tion of the Republican party, and as
such it should take such action as will
demonstrate to the voters of the State
that the attempt of the corporation
bosses to secure the repudiation of the
pledge made almost four years ago is
not in accordance with party principles
and should be frowned upon by every
one who has the interests of the party
at heart. This can be done, they con*
tend, by the adoption of a resolution
declaring it to be the sense of this con
vention that the nominee for Governor
be selected from among the Repub
licans of the northern portion of the
State, and that the southern part of
the State be accorded the candidate for
United States Senator. Such action
would not commit the convention to
the cause of any man, but would be a
measure tending to promote harmony
and strength, a purpose . that comes
within the ra.nge of the scheme of
league club organization.
The men who will lead the fight on
the floor of the convention against the
machinations of the corporation bosses
will point to the acts of Henry Gage to
prove the methods by which the at
tempt is being made to defeat the
chances of honest and honorable men*.
Some months ago Gage was an
nounced as a candidate for the position
of United States Senator. This was
done for the purpose of testing the
popularity of the anti-corporation can
didates who were known to have Sena
torial ambitions. The result was an
overwhelming verdict for the anti-cor
poration men. Had the result been the
other way Gage would have remained
in the field and his monopolistic sup
porters would have moved heaven and
earth to exact from the present con
vention a pledge to permit the south to
select a candidate for Senator. As it
was. however, another course had to be
pursued. Gage was withdrawn from
the Senatorial field and his unpopular
friend, Harrison Gray Otis, editor of
the Los Angeles Times, was induced to
announce that Gage would be a candi
date for the Republican nomination for
Governor. This being accomplished,
the subsidized press came forward with
the assertion that no particular dis
trict had a just claim on any particular
office within the gift of the voters of
the State. By this course it was hoped
that the north would combine against
the south, with the result that both the
Governor and Senator would be lost to
the south.
Certain newspapers in this end of the
State lent aid to this scheme and the
same aid is being extended to the cor
poration servants in this convention.
M. 11. de Young would like to wear the
Senatorial toga and he and his lieu
tenants are lending aid and comfort to
the promoters of any plan that will de
feat the chances of prospective candi
dates from the southern or any other
part of the State. H. V. Morehouse of
San Jose is also on the ground to render
such assistance as his railroad affilia
tions give him to the corporation pro
gramme. Morehouse would also like to
honor the United States Senate by his
presence as a member of that body and
he is not particular as to the means he
adopts to further his vaulting ambi
tion. The question seems to be one that
this convention will be forced to de
cide and there are those among the
party leaders who pretend to say that
upon the decision depends the success
of the party at the polls next Novem
ber.
There are numerous Individual politi
cal booms that are being carefully
nursed under the glare of the conven
tion sun, the gentlemen who are doing
the nursing paying very little attention
to the grave assertion that the purpose
of the convention is not to afford an
opportunity for the grinding of political
axes, but to promote and strengthen
party organization. Dr. Pardee and ex-
Mayor Davis are giving the glad hand
to the country delegates while not en
eraged in watching each other. To the
man in the conning tower the rivalry
that exists between these gentlemen ap
pears to be of that peculiar brand that
readily yields to the softening influ
ences of a nominating convention com
bination. Lew Brown has a smile for
all and is positive in his declaration
that he wants the nomination for Gov
ernor or nothing. His most intimate
friends accuse him of holding a mental
reservation in favor of the nomination
for the position he now holds, but he
declares that the has no faith in their
powers as mind-readers. Tom Flint' and
District Attorney Barnes have also
taken advantage of the. opportunity af
forded them to mend a few holes in
their political fences, and as the recep
tion accorded each of them at the mass
meeting last night was about equally
enthusiastic they are both in doubt as
to which stands the better chance of
convincing the State Convention that
their proper place is at the head of the
ticket.
THE CONVENTION OPENS
Delegates Show Unanimous
Enthusiasm for the Republi
can Administration.
"Three cheers for our country!"
They wpre piven and with them an old
time hip-hurrnh.
The \v;ir spirit is now uppermost in the
minds of all our citizens as was evidenced
yesterday at the convention of Republican
Clubs held at Golden Gate Hall. The band
played patriotic and inspiring- airs and
the delegates from the north, from the
south, the past and west of California
cheered until their throats were sore and
their voices husky.
The opening of the convention was
marked by demonstrations that have not
been seen since the close of the civil war.
The delegates were all Imbued with the
spirit of patriotism and it seemed as If
they would never tire of cheering the flag
of the country and those who are now
fighting under its " folds. : There were
cheers for our heroes, cheers for the star
spangled banner, and cheers for the "pri
vate" soldiers of the army and the sea
men of our battleships. The delegates
were in a cheering mood. Before their
minds was pictured the gallant and victo
rious battle of Dewey with the Spanish
squadron in Manila Bay, and in the fore
ground was depicted another equally glo
rious battleâ a battle of tne ballotâ to be
held the coming fall.' - .
Every one felt in hopeful mood. The
delegates to the convention , were
ready willing, - aye anxious to
display their feelings. When the band
"laved "Dixie's Land," the representa
tives of the fighting, working force of the
Ileuubllcan â¢ party in this State rose and
rhf-ered with the same spirit and enthusi
asm as when the , musicians branched off
into the "Star* Spangled Banner." With
them there was no North, no South. The
nast was buried, and with it all thoughts
of the long struggle that resulted in the
firm establishment of the nation at }: the
enÂ«t of many thousand, lives. And among:
the delegates , were not a.a '. few who had
been arrayed against one another, dur
ing the stirring and eventful- times of 1861
and 1865. The bloody shirt is forever
Yesterday they met as brothers. United
were they on ; the â¢ political issues of the
day united on the problem of war: There

rifle to fight for American rights and
American principles.
So it was that when the band played the
national anthem, the delegates cheered,
and still they cheered when the musicians !
were taking needed rest.
The work of the convention yesterday !
was entirely of a preliminary nature.
This morning the delegates will be called i
upon to decide the great and momentous
question who shall guide and direct them
in the coming political campaign. There
is quite a unanimity among them as to :
who shall be the officers of the league ;
and It is probable that but few ballots â 
will be taken on any office. Of course
there is a spirit of sectional rivalry
shown, but the minority will cheerfully
bow to the decision of the majority.
To the local reception committee* is due
much of the credit for the enthusiasm
and patriotism displayed at the first
meeting. The delegates met at 12:30
o'clock in the Baldwin Hotel, an<l from
there marched to Golden Gate Hall on
Sutter street, above Mason. A band at
tne head of the several delegations played
patriotic and inspiring airs, and when '
the delegates reached the hall they were I
to a man willing to be mustered In on :
live minutes' notice to join the gallant
Dewey and his men. When the musicians
struck up any of the airs so dear to the
hearts of all patriotic citizens the men
cheered, and they cheered when the band
ceased. Then there were cheers for
Dewey. cheers for Sampson, cheers for
bchley. but the heartiest cheers were
given wh.-n s.>me one suggested cheers
rpr the privates In the navy and army
)oices grew husky, but that did not af
fect the men. They applauded and
shouted when George Lee. a deputy In
the C ounty Clerk's office, proposed three
cheers and a tiger for our country The
delegates arose to their feet, waved their
hats and gave voice until their throats
The convention was called to order at
1:30 o'clock by Colonel George Stone who
'in-:i n - : , w brief rf>m a-rks introduced General
\\ . H. U Barnes, who had been selected
to deliver the address of welcome Gen
eral Barnes was in happy mood and the
address will long he remembered by those,
who heard it. There was a tinge of'pathos
here, only to be quickly dispelled by a
word painting that touched the risibility
of his auditors. Then he drifted off on the
stre; m of sarcasm and his words were
biting.
General Barnes is counted among the
"war horses" of the party and three
cheers were suggested when he ap
proached the front of the stage. The
cheers were given by 1500 delegates and
spectators. He acknowledged the recep
tion and in humorous vein extended a wel
come to the visiting delegates in the name
of the Mayor.
"1 am sorry that owing to the unfor
tunate condition of local politics our lo
quacious and Ã¼biquitous Mayor is unable
to be present to-day," saicl he, "but in his
name 1 welcome you all."
General Barnes had his auditors. They
laughed and cheered and it was several
minutes before Â«he was able to proceed.
He then drew them over to the somber
side of our political history. With words
that touched the hearts of all who heard
him he drew a picture of the now-forgot
ten past, when the North and the South
were divided and the blue and the gray ,
In combat met.
"It was under a Republican administra
tion that these battles were fought," said
he, "and It is under a Republican admin
istration to-day that there is another call
to arms. Thank God we are now fighting
a common foe. The bitter passions of the
past are over. There is no North, no
South, but there is instead a united peo
ple â united now and united forever.
Thank God that we are united. We are
united at the cost of blood, but we are
unlti'd by tios that never will be sun

common Impulse, and to-day on the fields
of C'hiekamauga, under the shadow of

our brothers fell, the soldiers of the North
and the BokUen of the South are waiting
to answer the call of the country. It is

strains of 'Yankee Doodle' and 'Down In
Dixie" are blended. And we are only wait

war is already known. When it is over
We will not only be respected but feared
abroad."
General Barnes said that the, next politi
cal campaign would present new issues.
It would not be a question of gold or sil
ver but one of territorial expansion.
"The time is coming, and very soon,"
said he, "when Uncle Sam will shake the
paw of the British lion."
The suggestion of an alliance between
England and America was the signal for
an outburst of applause.
"I don't intend delivering a speech,"
said the general when the audience quiet

THE GLORIOUS PARTY.
Speeches on Republicanism at
the Mass-Meeting Held
Last Night.
It was a hurrah meeting that the State
League of Republican Clubs held last
night at the Golden Gate Hall. Copious
outpouring* of eloquence and oratory
were lavished on the representatives and
the outsiders who attended to hear the
politicians sing the praises of the Repub
lican party. There was not the attend
ance expected, but the hall was neverthe
less comfortably filled. The Alameda
County aggregation was present to a man
and not an opportunity did the men from
Oakland lose to shout, applaud and show
their appreciation of things in general.
Tirey L. Ford was chosen presiding offl-
I cer. With a few well selected words he
opened the mass meeting and Introduced
T. P. Eddy of San Francisco as the first
speaker or the evening. Mr. Eddy said:
"Great issues are to be determined in
the coming campaign. The tariff question
is settled, the financial question la set
tled, but there still remains a question of
life and death, that of national limitation
I or expansion, confronting the people in
this campaign. We don't want a United
States Senator from California who is not
in favor of taking the Philippines if they
are offered to us. Admiral Dewey plant
ed the Stars and Stripes on the Philippine
Islands and I am opposed to any one
hauling them down. We do not want a
congressman who says that in a time of
war the taking of a Spanish ship on the
high seas is an act of barbarity and rob
bery."
The next speaker was Dr. George C.
Pardee of Oakland. Immediately upon
his introduction the Alameda contingent
lost Itself in shrieks and shouts and ear
splitting tournaments. This was the sec
ond ovation Pardee received at the hands
of his partisans. When he walked upon
the stage and shook hands with his rival
for the gubernatorial candidacy. W. R.
Davis, the Alamedans gave the first exhi
bition of strong pulmonary abilities.
When order was restored Dr. Pardee
spoke of the glorious Republican county
of Alameda. its political instincts and Us
good behavior in the last campaign. The
doctor "perorated" on the present war
and the soul stirring patriotism of our
soldier boys.
Not to have two men from Alameda
shout patriotism in succession, Tirey L.
Ford sandwiched in Robert N. Bulla of
Los Angeles. Mr. Bulla suffered from
an attack of hoarseness and said but a
few words, for. which he was loudly
applauded. Then followed the second
speaker from Alameda Countyâ W. R.
Davis. The cohorts of Pardee were silent.
A scattering cheer rose, which was taken
up by the gallery and the generous-spir
ited outsiders. Davis said: "I feel as if
wo were at a family reunion. We are
GO EARLY AND AVOID THE RUSH.
Do you wish to vote at the next election?
Of course on the impulse of the moment everybody will an
swer "Yes," but if they do there is but one course to pursue. Go
at once to William Biggy, Registrar for the City and County of San
Francisco, whose office is located in the basement of the City Hall,
and -write your name in bold-face on the books. Have yourself
weighed and measured and the color of your eyelashes taken down
according to the statutes, else when your time comes to cast your
ballot you will think it iceberg time.
Begistrar Biggy announces that, according to the statutes,
all previous registration was canceled last night and the books will
be opened anew this morning. There will be a sufficient number of
clerks on hand to take care of the crowd, and business will be trans
acted in a smooth, business-like way. There will be no distinctions
made, and those who have formerly voted in other portions of the
State, but wish to throw in their lot with San Francisco voters, must
bring a writ of cancellation from their former voting place â the
mere statement of the fact that they have lived ninety days in this
county will not go. Proof must be brought that they have not reg
istered "early and often." The office is open from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m.
not in the war of a campaign as yet, but
are merely getting ready for it. The pub
lic knows that this assemblage was not
brought togther to consider the Interests
of individuals, but to show Republicans
that the party is behind the ticket it will
form. We assemble to confer how wo may
push forward the outposts of Republican
ism. We want to be enrolled, in touch
with one another, confronting the De
mocracy in the center, the right wing and
on the left, winning a victory for our
party and our State at the head of the col
umn for 1900."
The next speaker was J. W. Hudson of
Sonoma County, who has lately become a
politician of thiÃ State. Mr. Hudson is a
man of small physique with a scpu chra.l
voice, and he entertained the audience
by a dissertation on the benefits of min
gling religion with politics for the sake
of giving men work who wanted to work.
Cries for Morehouse brought that orator
from Santa Clara to the front and then
the assembly was treated to an ornate
and multi-colored speech, redolent with
the soft perfume of a southern garden and
stuffed with metaphors. Mr. Morehouse
spoke of the golden sands lapped with
amorous kisses and the umbrageous oaks
The Republican party was the theme or
his peroration.
This concluded the mass-meeting.
THE STATE WIITS.
The Sacramento Fair Accident Cases
Must Be Tried Again.
p. W. Melvin attended fhe State Fair in
Sacramento in September, 1891. and while
in the grand stand the seats broke down,
carrying him to the ground under a mass
of debris, causing severe injuries. He sued
the State for $25,000 damages, setting
up that the defendant had been negligent
in attending to the safety of those who
attended the fair, and further it had pre
vious knowledtre of the unsafe condition
of the grand stand. These allegations
were denied, the State claiming that the
fair was held by the Stale Agricultural
Fair Association, and that this society de
rived all the benefits and profits made by
the venture. However, Melvin obtained
judgment for $10,000 damages.
The State was successful in its plea to
have the verdict set aside and a new trial
was granted. From this order the plain
tiff appealed and yesterday the Supreme
Court decided that the granting of a mo
tion for a new trial was proper.
Tully P de Long, a minor, was also In
jured by the same accident and his suit
by his guardian, Rachael M. Wright, was
successful in the lower court. As in the
other case, a motion for a new trial was
granted and the decision of the Melvin
case was applied to the case of De Long,
a similar order being made.

bank there by means of "crooked"
checks. At their request the money was
sent through Wells-Fargo's office, and
when they called there Monday afternoon
for It the detectives were waiting for
them.
To Move the Exhibit.
J. A. Filcher, manager of the State
Board of Trade, has been notified by the
Harbor Commissioners to vacate the
j premises in the ferry building, for several
j months occupied as un offlVe ajid exhibit
room for the Alaska trade committee,
which iH now under the direction of the
former organisation. The information was
| given that the work of tearing down the
old unsightly shed will begin within the
next ten days. The new ferry building is
not yet ready for the occupancy of the
Board of Trade, which is to have exhibit
rooms near the main exit. The fine exhib
its of the board are now in the Mechanics'
Pavilion, where they have been since the
close of the lUining- Fair. What to do with
the Alaska exhibits is puzzling Manager
Fileher, for while there are plenty of
places that can be had he does not want
to go to mur'h expense for such .1 short
time. It is believed that he will take tem
porary quarters in the basement of the
Crocker buildiiiK, where the State Board's
exhibit was on view several years ago.
COOLIE LABOR
IS NOT WANTED
TBOUBLE OVER THE CHINESE
MADE UNIFORMS.
The Building Trades Council Sends
a Scathing Letter to the Secre
tary of War.
The agitation over the fact that a num
ber of uniforms for the volunteer- wero
n:ade In Chinatown is not by any means
ended, and many of the trades unionists
prophesy that it will revive the old ques
tion of Asiatic labor, which at one time
threatened a race war. For the past week
letters and telegrams have been hurried
to Washington at a rate which threatens
to swamp the officials. The Building
Trades Council last week sent a telegram
to Washington stating- the main points,
but afterward thought it advisable to
send a letter thoroughly explaining mat
ters. This letter was prepared by James
Rose, a veteran warhorse in the labor
movement, and is as follows:
Hon. Russell A. Alger, Secretary of War-
Dear Sir: You will see by the accompanying
resolutions that the Building Trades Council
of San tranclsco end the State Department of
uaoor, after a thorough Investigation, hava
secured ample and reliable proof that the
1 nit-,1 Stales Commissary Department, located
in Sun Francisco, is letting contracts to firms
in this city for the manufacture of clothing
for the Doited States army; said clothing is
being made almost exclusively by Chinese la
bur, to the exclusion of white male and fe
male unemployed garment makers, who are
continually appealing for the work.
You no doubt are aware of the fact that the
Pacific Coast States have waged a long and
very expensive agitation against coolie la
bor, which at time- has almost taken on the
tOf a race war. If you have never been
a resident of the far West, it is almost im
possible for you" to realize the conditions; but
aside from these facts we are led to believe
that the war now being carried on between
the I nlted States and Spain is actuated hy
the noblest of all sentiments inherent in man
viz.: "Humanity."
If such be the case and we earnestly, hon
estly and sincerely believe it to be so, 'we ap
peal to you to u.=e your best endeavors, ma da
doubly powerful by the high and noble posi
tion you occupy as Secretary of War to aid
us in seeing justice done in this unfortunate
matter, as many of the applicants for work
on these garments are the wives, daughters
and children of veterans in the late war and
volunteers in this.
v.v further believe that men who offer up
tlieir lives on the altar of their country in sup
port of the Stars and Stripes are entitled
through their f:im!lieÂ« to the pitiful benefits
to be derived from the making of their uni
forms, and that this sentiment of humanity be
extended tn the families of these noble vol
unteers, who, hy their enlistment, have in
many cases deprived tlieir families of their
only support. Keel ing that our cause is a j:ist
(.IK- and that we are asking nothing bit what
we would be glad to r-xtend were we in a po
sition so to do, we appeal to you.
Trusting to your well known spirit of gen
erosity and patriotism, we submit our cÂ«usÂ»
knowing that it will receive, through you the
result we so earnestly desire.
We remain patriotic to our country to the
end of all time. JAMES W. ROSB,
Secretary of Committee.
YOUNG PIGEONS RACED.
Fast Time Made by Homing Birds
From Santa Rosa.
The California Pigeon and Homing So
ciety had Its first young bird race of the
season on Monday, May 30, from Santa
Rosa, for the Kuehn trophy and two oth
er prizes. Thf new timing machines were
used and proved very satisfactory. Tho
birds were liberated at 8 a. m. sharp by
T. A. Rooter of Santa Rosa, who tele
graphed Secretary Whitman the time of
liberation and that the wind waa blowing
from the north.
The birds arrived as follows:

speed to San Francisco, 1237 yards per
minute.

tance, 50 miles 885 yards; arrived 9:12%
a. m. ; si>eed to San Francisco, 1226 yarda
per minute.
Thirdâ John Filmer, bird W513; dis
tance, 50 miles BSO yards; arrived 9:13
a. m. : speed to San Francisoo, 1217*4 yard*
per minute.
Fourthâ H. F. Whitman, bird W155; dis
tance, 53 miles 1320 yards; arrived 9:15Â»4

The only first-class hotel in Oakland,
the Hotel Metropole, has been handsome
ly refitted, and is now equal to any in the
State. The court recently set aside sev
eral thousand dollars of the estate of the
late James Smiley, the owner of the prop
erty, for the renovation. R. M. Briare,
late of the Pleasanton, San Francisco, is
the genial host. The location. Thirteenth
and Jefferson streets, is one of the finest
in the city, with cars passing the door to
all depots and suburban pleasure resorts.
The climate is several degrees warmer
than in San Francisco, and business men
can live here comfortably and cross the
bay daily.
Sustained a Fractured Skull.
John Brown of 37 Clementina street, a.
driver in the employ of Charles R. Allen
& Co., was thrown from a coal cart at
Third â¢ and Folsom streets last night and,
sustained a fracture of the skull.
'-â -. He was removed to the Receiving Hos
pital : and was attended by Doctors Bun
nell and Prentiss. Little hope was given
for his recovery. The injured man is the
father of a large family, the youngest be
ing but four days old. . .

Mr. Mogan is' a' well-known native of
San Francisco. He was born In ivj'j and
was educated at St. Mary's College. .Af

William J. Gavigan, who is well-known
by his unique title of sociological expert
for the city and county, a position which
is now being contested, was appointed
prosecutor In Judge Conlan's court, vice
Mogan. That ended the fight on appoint
ments. The matter was apparently a
foregone conclusion in both cases, as
there was no conflict of any consequence.
The Excelsior Athletic Club was grant
ed permission to give, boxing exhibitions
at Teutonia Hall, 1322 Howard street.
The board passed the bill granting T. V.
Maxwell permission to fence his property
at the northeast corner of Market and
City. Hall avenue. This bill was passed
over the Mayor's veto.
The Mayor attention was called to the
fact that voting booths In the city are
mill standing and that they* constitute a
nuisance. Supervisor Clinton stated that
they ought to be removed within forty
eight hours and that they were allowed to
stand for weeks last year. The Mayor
said the matter was attended to by con
tract and was under the jurisdiction of
the Election Commissioners, whose atten
tion he would call to the matter at an
early date.

The resignation of Dr. Henry H. Hart
from the Board of Health of San Fran

A few months ago Â£>r. Hart asked to be
relieved from duty as a member of the

follow*:
BACRAMEXTO, May 25. 1S!Â»S.
Dr. Henry H. Hartâ Dear Hlr: I received
your letter tendering your reMignatlon aa a
member of the Board of Health of the City
and County of San Francisco by reason of
your Intended departure to UawÂ«on City, N.
W. T., and have delayed replying thereto In
the hope that possibly somethlnK might pre
vent your leaving San Francisco and thus per
; mlt you to hold your office until the end of
I the term. Now that your going seems im
: mlnent I take this occasion to thank you for
your excellent work as a member of the Hoard
â¢â¢â  Health and to state that you have fully
.instilled the high hopes and confidence I had
In vuu as a physician, official and a man
when you were appointed to the office, your
resignation of which I am now compelled to
accept with regret. Yours truly
JAMES H. BUDD.
Dr Hart proposes to leave for the

Robert MoFarlane. a boxrnaker, who
: lived at the Lindel] House, Sixth and
Howard streets, was taken from there
: Monday to the City and County Hospital,
where he died yesterday morning and his
i body was removed to the Morgue. It was
, reported that he had died from a fracture
i of the skull and Captain Bohen detailed

while drunk, fell Saturday and iniured
himself slightly, but all doubt was set at
rest when the autopsy showed that he
died from natural causes.

WILL NOT FORSAKE THE STAGE.
The Wedding of Frawleu's Leading Ladu and a German
Baron Has Been PostDoned.
MADELEINE BODTON,
The fact that Miss Madeleine Bouton has signed a contract with Man- 5
ager Frswley for the season as leading lady of his company, which Is to j
open at the Columbia Theater on June 13 In "An Enemy "to the King," .\
should set at rest the report which was lately given wide "publicity In the ]
Xrw York papers that she was about to forsake the drama, of which she Is j
bo brilliant an exponent, for the purpose of wedding a German baron of real j
nobla blood, Yon Mimptsch by name. The rumor was extensively circu- â â  j
lated while Miss Bouton was playing a highly successful engagement In i
the "Tarrytown Widow," at the Bijou Theater In New York City. It wad i
further stated that the couple would spend their honeymoon amid the tur- j
rets and moats of the Baron's ancestral castles, which he had not visited In i
years. The lady did not deny the engagement when Interviewed in New j
York at the time, but It Is evident from later developments that the mar- .j
rlage has been postponed at least until after her more prosy engagement <
with the Frawley company has expired. j
It appears that Baron yon Mlmptsch has a legitimate right to the ]
title, but for reasons of his own and on account of his personal tenden- j
cies toward a democratic form of government, he deserted his ancestral ]
castles to come to America. This was several years ago. and when he ar- -
rived in New York he went into business as an Importer. He is now a J
wealthy cidfr and champagne agent, and his name appears In the city dlrec- â¢
tory as simply G. yon Mlmptsch of 112 Central Park, west. i
It tMul also been stated that thfre is a pretty romance connected with â¢
the meeting of the Baron and the fair Madeleine, but the details of the ro- â¢
mance are lacking. Suffice It to say that the Baron has been most assidu- i
ous. in his attentions to the charming enslaver of his affections On the â¢
opening night of the "Tarrytown Widow" he sent his fiancee a handsome
parasol of duchesse silk, studded with jewels, which an Inquisitive usher of
the theater, who saw the price tag, declares cost $800.
However, It is an assured fact that the graceful and accomplished ac
tress will contlnuo to charm theater-goers for some time to come, and after
that, time will tell whether Madeleine Bouton will desert the fascinating â¢
glare of the footlights for the more serious realities of domestic life. :
PAID WELL FOB, HER DIVORCE.
Mrs. Reardon Wants Q. W. Howe Ar
rested for Obtaining Money by
False Pretenses.
Mrs. Mary Reardon, 607 Minna street,
applied for a Warrant in Judge Joachim
sen's court yesterday for the arrest of
George \V. Howe, the disbarred attorney,
on a charge of obtaining- money by false
pretenses.- She alleged that she went to
Howe in December last and engaged him
to apply for a divorce from her husband,
James Keardon.
"Howe." she said, "represented himself
as a practicing attorney and offered to
secure th>: divorce for $200. I had money
in the Hibernia Bank and paid him the
$20>J out of it; Then I gave him $29 for
witnesses' fees. The divorce was granted
by .ImJge Troutt and Howe employed At
torney J. W. Carter to represent him In
court.
â¢"A few days ago I went to the bank to
draw out some money and found that It
was all rrone. I consulted Judge Cooney
and he ascertained that it had been rep
resented to Judge Troutt that my hus
band had money in bank, but that I was
penniless, and they got an order from him
for $V.o, being $7o for their fee, $25 alimo
ny for me and the rest for costs. A week
later they got another order from the
Judge for"slSs on the same representations.
Judge Cooney had them brought before
Judge Troutt and they promised to re
fund the money, but they have not done
so. Judge Cooney has now made a for
mal demand upon Howe for the return of
the $229 I paid him and threatens to take
the matter before the Grand Jury."
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Mann
gave Mrs. Reardon a letter to Howe ask
ing him to appear in court this morning
to explain his conduct, otherwise a war
rant would be issued for his arrest.
WILL GRANT NO MORE O. R.S.
Judge Low Declares He Is Disgusted
With the Business.
Judge Low declares that he will Issue
no more O. R.s for the release of prison
ers. The expose in The Call of how he
granted two O. R.s for the release of J.
D. Beserra, charged with an assault with
a deadly weapon, has nerved him to defy
"de push."'
The Judge's explanation is that when
Attorney Gallagher applied for the sec
ond order Gallagher Informed him that
Beserra would have nothing to do with At
torney Quigley, and refused to be released
on the order obtained by Quigley. Beserra
was in court yesterday, and, In answer to
the Judge, conllrmed what Attorney Gal
lagher had stated. But the fact remained
that the Judge gave two O. R.s for the
release of one prisoner.
A Celtic Union Presentation.
At a special meeting to-morrow night

tion ajid a set of resolutions of esteem
and respect. The committee in charge
will also give the gallant officer, who was
a colonel of a California regiment for sev
eral years, a fine saber and revolver and
belt. The recipient is now a lieutenant in
the light artillery, acting as quartermas
ter, and expects to be soon sent to Ma
nila. All members of the Union and
friends of Lieutenant Barry are welcome.

Meeting of Directors Which May Re
sult in Serious Trouble in thÂ«
Popular Athletic
Body.
A reached by the board of
1 directors of the Olympic Club yesterday
may have a t.>ndÂ«.'iioy to rauso trouble in
J .that old and jionular organization. .
Contrary tn the wishes of many of the
| memhors. the board iHscharged Prpfes-
Soirs Walter W.atson and Hugo Belan,
who have served the organization for
many years.
The popularity of the two men was
Conclusively shown the day after the
story of their undoing liad been pub
lished exclusively in The Tall, when mem
bers voluntarily signed petitions to the
board and many personally interceded !n
their behalf.
Their efforts were for naught, as at the
meeting held in President Newhall's of
fice yesterday six directorsâ Messrs. Kel
ly, McClennan, Forsythe, Morse, Newball
and Taylor- voted to uphold the course "f
Directors Newhall and Taylor. It was
also decided that IÂ»e Witt Van Court, a
more aggressive a nd younger man, should
be employed as boxing instructor, to take
office to-day. Meihling, the wrestling in
structor, will lake charge of the deposed
gymnasts' elapse:-; during the' summer
months, and should it. be found necessary
another instructor will be employed to as
sist him during August
It is rumored that v general meeting of
the members will soon be held to rebel
against the directors" course, and some
interesting developments, are promised.
Many are opposed to Leader Howard
Taylor and are anxious that he hand in
his resignation. In the event that he can
be prevailed- on to do it, ex-Leader John
Hammersmith has signified his willing
ness to take the position in the hope of
Winning back the alleged lost prestlgd 'of
the club. â¢ â¢
RUN OVER AND KILLED.
A Four- Year-Old Boy's Life Pressed
Out by the Wheels of a Truck.
Clarence Hayden, a four-year-old boy
living at 411 Fourth street, was run over
by a heavy truck loaded with iron on
Third street, near Harrison, yesterday,
and died forty minutes mter in the Re
ceiving Hospital.
The driver, unmindful of the cries of
anguish that arose from pedestrians who
witnessed the accident, drove away and
up to a late hour has not been found.
C. : Waggenmann of 417 Third street
rushed out and cared for the little fellow
until Officers O'Keefe and Beach arrived,
when he was taken to the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital. It was found that the
immense wheel passed over the lower por
tion of the child a body, crushing it terri
bly.
The father of the boy, J. J. Hayden, a
cook, said the boy was on his way home
from the Kindergarten school when
killed. :-,

LEITER'S W'IEAT DEAL.
Chicago's Heavy Speculator Appar

CHICAGO, May 31.â T.eiter's famous
â wheat deal was formally closed to-day.
The last moments were lively, and Jo
seph Leiter, to all appearances, was mas
ter of the situation. He went I'ay wheat
down from $1 7T> t<> $1 25 for the purpose of
evading the big receipts and circumvent
ing: the "tallers" who wnnted to "ring In"
a Tot of wheat on Letter at fancy prices.
Nevertheless he had to take aboard an
other 500.000 bushels to-day in addition to
the 5,000.000 or 6.000.000 bushels which he
etlli has on his hands. Attempts to place
Loiter, co far as his profits and losses are
concerned, at the culmination of this gl-
Kantlc deal are widely at variance. Some
claim thnt he will pocket a profit of W. 000
,-000. while others Insist with knowing
glances that he will be fortunate if he ,
comes out whole on the deal.

NOTRE DAME
COMMENCEMENT
Large Gathering at the
Exercises.
AN EXCELLENT PROGRAMME.
MUSICAL N~_BERS PARTICU
LARLY BRILLIANT.
Graduates Crowned With Wreaths.
A Few Appropriate Remarks by
Archbishop Riordan at
the Close.
8pÂ«c!Â«l Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSB, May 81.â ThÂ© annual
commencement exercise* of the Col
lege of Notre Dame were held this
morning before a large and apprecia
tive gathering-. The programme was
undoubtedly the finest of its kind ever
heard in this city. The numbers were
exceedingly well rendered, and reflect
ed great credit upon the painstaking of
the sisters In charge of the institution.
This was the forty-seventh commence
ment, and in the audience were many
mothers of pupils who had come to pay
homage to their own alma mater,
Notre Dame has long been recognized
as one of the best institutions of learn
ing in the State, and the best society
of San Jose and the State has been
heavily recruited from its graduates.
The stage was decorated with palm
leaves and draped with several large
American flags, while in the back
ground was a life-siae image of the
Virgin Mary. In front of the platform
were a number of potted plants and
flowers, while above the rostrum was
the motto "Suavia et Fortis," worked
in bright carnations on a groundwork
of green. Grouped in front of the stage
were the students in their pretty white
dresses, and the whole made an im
pressive scene that will long be remem
bered.
The graduates who received diplomas
and were crowned with wreaths were
Misses Gertrude O'Connor, Annie
Hughes and Annie Kelly. All three of
the young ladies recited original poems
and both their composition and deliv
ery showed they fully deserved the high i
honors they received to-day. About I
one hundred other young ladies were
promoted and received awards of med
als and premiums.
The first number on the programme |
was the "Morceau de Concert" for five
pianos, the performers being Misses M.
San Vincent, L. Maliano, J. Chopard,
L. Eager, E. Amestoy, M. Longe, J. S.
Lathrop, I. Ruiz, M. Scally and E.
Jones.
The following numbers were then
presented:
Chorus (five parts), Wallace, vocal
classes, accompanist. Miss E. Bradley;

The "Souvenirs de la Colline dcs Lau

called forth the admiration of the as

At the close of the programme Arch
bishop Rlordan made a few appropriate
remarks.
HORSE THIEVES ESCAPE
FROM VENTURA'S JAIL
By Great Ingenuity Two Young Des
peradoes Regain Their
Liberty.
VENTURA, May 31.â Two horse-thieves
escaped from the County Jail last night.
They are William Hall, aged 19, and John
Netto, aged 24, a Portuguese.
Their escape was carried out In a most
deliberate and well-planned manner.
From a piece of stove wood, smuggled In
through a trusty, the prisoners made a
wooden key to fit the padlock of the
door. They displayed much Ingenuity in
it* manufacture. It required much time,
and was made only during spare mo
ments In the absence of the jail officials.
Upon escaping from their cell they
climbed up the steel framework to the
trapdoor lending to the roof. After con
siderable work this trap was broken open
and the prisoners passed upon the roof.
To the chimney they attached a ropo
cleverly made from their blankets, and
by the aid of the rope the men lowered
themselves to the ground.
Their escape was not discovered until

PASSENGER RATES

Transatlantic Steamship Companies'
Pooling Arrangements Has
Been Broken.
NEW YORK, May 31.â The Tribune to
day says: A reduction In passenger rates
to Europe this summer is expected among
thy agents of the large transatlantic lines
at this port. The pooling arrangement
which has prevailed for a number of
yeara among the large lines has com
pletely fallen through. The agreeirtent
ends in June, and, while efforts have 1 n
made to continue it for another year they
have failed utterly, and the conference
which was to have been held In London
has been declared off.
That this disagreement means a rate
war is generally understood among the
local agents. They say that the war with
Spain has already reduced traffic, and
that the lack of harmony between the

" Several years ago I was troubled with an aggravated case of
dyspepsia and, of course, the first thing I did was to consult a physi-
cian. As I had always enjoyed the best of health I was worried a good
deal over this, my first illness, and my only desire was to get well as
speedily as I could. I took regularly all the medicines as my doctor
prescribed them. In a short time I felt all right, thought I was cured
and stopped taking the medicine. But it wasn't long before I was feel-
ing as badly as ever, and again I had recourse to the doctor. This
kept up for some time until at last I made up my mind I would quit
doctoring and try some of the remedies I saw advertised. I had read
so much of Ripans Tabules that I concluded I would give them
a good trial. It Baid ' one would give relief,' and I thought if one
could give relief a whole lot might cure me. I purchased a dollar's
worth, and when I had finished them I was feeling better than I had
for years. I continued to use them, and to-day I believe lam a per-
fectly well man. Once in a great while Ido have a slight touch of
the old malady, but a single Tabule fixes it all right I general!*

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 31.â T0-day's stock market
was active and strong, but the activity and
strength was not by any j means uniformly
distributed. The Grangers exercised a power
ful sustaining influence and Rock Island was
the feature of the group. St. Paul closed the
day with a net gain of over 2 points, the ad
vance being encouraged by published reassur
ances as to the permanent character of the
improvement charged to the large operating
expense for April.
The newly published statement of Burling
ton's April earnings with a similarly large
proportion absorbed in operating expenses, was
a drag on. that. stock early in the day, but its
tone improved later and there was a net rise
of 1%. The buoyancy In Rock Island was ac
companied by a notable show of strength In
others of the Granger group. ..
â¢ People's Gas was the most conspicuous stock
In the list and rose at one time BVi points.,
but lost nearly a point on realizing. Brooklyn
Transit was also up' nearly 2 points at one
time. The recent rise In the iron stocks con
tinued to-day, Minnesota Iron and Illinois
Steel rising respectively 3 and 2V4 points. The
recent entry Into the directory of the Illinois
company of a powerful financial Interest has
led to rumors of extensive combinations in the
iron and steel business and this Is the ground
of the rise In these stocks. Chicago and East
ern Illinois rose 6% points and Northern Pa
cific preferred. Union Pacific preferred and
Sugar also developed strength. A rise of 3%
in Delaware and Hudson should also be men
tioned. The buoyancy of so large a number of.
important stocks : was sufficient to carry the
whole market upward, but the strength was
much less notable at other points In the list,
London bought stocks in this market and a
beneficial effect generally was felt from the
definite locating of Admiral Cervera's fleet in
Santiago harbor. But the benefit * from : this
factor was due principally to its giving freer
play to conditions specially affecting different
stocks. Manhattan- and Metropolitan Street
Railway gave some positive ; evidences 'of de
pression and it was with difficulty that they
rose at any time above Saturday's level. . A
fair amount of commission house orders to buy
had accumulated over the double holiday and
helped on the rise. -
.Dealings In bonds were In fair volume and
were well distributed, gains being general
throughout the list. Total sales, $2,950,000.
United States old 4e coupon advanced' % In

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 31. -The Evening Post's
, London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet but fairly firm to- i
, day on cheap money. Americans and Grand
TrtÃtka were active and were quite the best
markets. The buying of Americans was
chiefly for New York and the Continent, but
there are signs of more buying here. Brazlla
were easier on a reaction In exchange.
I Spanish 4's wtre stationary. The gold pre- '
I mlum was S3 to-day, after touching 76 on '<
! Saturday.
The Continental demand for gold at 77s 9UJ
Is becoming keener, but a scarcity of bills
has forced the discount rats to a weak 2 Der â 
cent.
WBSIT DEAL ENDED.
NEW YORK. May SLâ ThÂ« May Wheat deal I
; at Chicago and New York ended rather lg
nomlnlously to-day. Extreme weakness In- j
stead of the "fireworks" expected markÂ»d tho i
closing scenes of one of the most famous
corners In years. It had beÂ«n confidently ex
j pected for weeks past that the Chicago clique
I would run the price of May Wheat there to j
! $2 per bushel and help the local market In pro- i
portion. Too much publicity, however, had j
been given the deal and farmers in all parts â 
of the country Bcraped their bins and poured â 
Wheat into both of the above markets to catch
the phenomenal prices predicted. At Chicago
much of this Wheat was taken by clique opera
tors as it arrived, but locally the grain be- i
came somewhat a drug on tne market. Only I
one result could follow such proceedings ami 1
that was a general downfall In prices, bfigin
uhig here. Shorts were speedily filled up and
for some days the May option had been de
clining steadily, reaching to-day $1 15 at New
York against sales at $1 91 early in the month.
July broke in proportion, selling off to Jl 04^
after early sales to-day at Jl 11^ and closing
at Jl 07. News of all sorts from weekly sta
tistics of crop advices were all favorable to
the bear attack which accomplished this de
cline in prices. The only support came from
foreign houses at tho opening and a llttl
covering by shorts near the close. The feature
was a sale of 88,000 bushels No. 2 red, pre
sumably for* French account, at $1 08@l 20 and
near lots pales of contract Wheat amounting
to 175,000 bushels at $1 34@1 35, mainly $1 35
The latter was supposed to be for Leiter, at- !
tributed to a desire on the ollque's part to i
stay the decline. Future price levels were I
dependent somewhat upon crop prospects un
less, as ia already Intimated, the clique takes
hold of July and booms it with the aid of
European demand and a scarcity of cash sup
plies In this country.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 81.â To-day's session saw the
close of perhaps the greatest wheat deal In the
annals of grain business. The May option,
which left oft Saturday at $1 75, ranged to-day
between $1 40 and II 26, closing at the lower
figure, a loss of 50c a bushel. The slump In
May. coupled with the bearish statistics, enor
mous world's shipments and bright crop pros
pects, caused a severe decline of the deferred
futures In wheat. At the close July showed a
loss of 606ftc and September i@2^c.
The demand In the wheat pit to-day was far
shorts, who took advantage of the break to buy

In and secure , profits. July had , a sensational
I decline during which some longs sold out. It
I started at from $1 01 to i *1 02 and was offered
down from $1 02% a cent at each trade, until It
had dropped to 94% c. It recovered a portion
of the decline later with a little help from
Letter. May, â  which closed Saturday at 11 75,
opened to-day at $1 40, and July dropped to
Jl 25 In the first few minutes. The evident
intention was to make a price for the heavy re
ceipts that were offered In the sample mar
ket.- The trade was confined to Letter brokers,
who were both buyers and sellers, and made
what price they chose. The crop news at home
and abroad could hardly have been more bear
ish. The visible supply Increased nearly 600.000
bushels, where a small decrease was expected.
July closed at 97%@98c, a loss of 6'j?6%c. Sep

large receipts and the wheat break. It rallied
very soon, however, on good buying and wet
weather reports. July closed %c higher.
In oats a moderately large business was
done. July closed' %c . higher.
The firmness in provisions was largely as
scribed to the signing of the reciprocity treaty

GUARDSMEN
Reorganization of the
Guard to Be Delayed.
-A POINT AS TO THE STANDING
OF ENLISTED MEN.
It is uncertain now when the National
Ouard of the State of California will be
reorganized, as it is not known at this
time the precise number of men to be fur
nished from the Guard to fill the second
call for volunteers, If the number re
quired is to be that' given when it was
first announced what California's second
quota would be. namely. 1942. that would
allow the requisite number to fill the sev
eral companies up to the maximum and
;then allow the Fifth Regiment to go as an
as was done in the case of
isthe First and Seventh Infantry, but if the
quota is to be reduced to .1076, as an
nounced in the dispatches of last Saturday,
then the members of the Fifth could not
â¢go as a regiment that could preserve its
organization. Until that is definitely set
wii! be Impossible to go ahead with
â the reorganization.
Thp plan of reoriranizatiin is still being
â worked upon, and it is probable that a
â¢conclusion will bo reached this week. Then.
soon as the disposition of the troops
>ehall have been a thing of the past, the
â -work of organizing a new guard for the
â¢State will be vigorously prosecuted.

applications were received last week in

Into the service of the State;
SOME SUGGESTIONS. 4 : * '":.
Some who are interested. in), the : reor
ganization are of the opinion;... that the!.
State should do more :>r ; the National
Guard than it did in the. vpast, in : order
that it may be put: on a ; better footing
than it ever was beforehand; in. support of
this â¢ the recommendation -of;-' Inspector.
General J. C; ;Breckinridge, ;of . the
United States- Army, â in ; ; the. . ' lap/
presented report to the Secretary of War.
waÂ«- "The National Guard, is i.our. main
traditional reliance for the common de
fense. Its need for funds is most severely
felt. A more adequate sum should be-ap
propriated toward its maintenance.. This,
of course, refers to the appropriation by
Congress, but the reorganize** hold that
It applies with equal force to the State.
One of the suggestions that has been
offered for the guard to be reorganized
Is that to secure the utmost effectiveness,
the several regiments should be kept in
closer touch with the tactics of the United
States army than they were in the past;
that the men should be trained in exer- 1
cises simulating war, for United States ;
army officers hold that that is as im
perative as the prior training of the in- :
dividual soldier. It is also suggested that!
the men should be instructed as fully as I
possible in all that pertains to camp life, i
not such as was given in State encamp
ments, but such as the volunteers at the
Presidio and Camp Richmond have been
receiving for several weeks past and are !
Btill receiving; that they should be thor
oughly instructed In the art of pitching
and striking tents, preparing ovens and
all details of camp life, and that such .
Instruction should be imparted to every !
member of a regiment so that in case of |
need every one would know just what to \
do and not have to inquire of his neigh
bor how he should go about performing
a particular duty. It Is also suggested
that there should be at every armory an
adequately adapted gymnasium for the I
exercise of the men so that they may be
thoroughly "seasoned" for the field. â  An- j
other suggestion has been offered, and j
that is that the commissary and quarter- ]
master of each regiment be required to
make himself thoroughly familiar with
his duties so that when called upon to
provide for the regiment he may know
just exactly what to do and how to pro- j
vide for it. The lessons of the nast few
weeks will no doubt be remembered by j
the officers whose duty it shall be to re- [
habilitate the Guard, and that they will
serve in the making of Lac new Guard ]
the most perfect of any in the United j
States.
V"IXTS THAT HAVE COME UP.
During the past week it has been decid
ed that the officers and men who as
rial Guardsmen tendered their ser
to the Government of the United
and Wire accepted by that act
severed their connection with the Guard
of the State, and that it will be in order
to give each an honorable discharge from
the service of the State. A question has
been rnise^ as to whether a National
iluardsman, who as such, tendered his
services to the United States for the war,
was accepted as a Guardsman and then
mustered in as a United States volunteer,
could be considered as entitled to be car
ried on the roll of the State so as to be
held to be in continuous service and en
;.!>;â¢â  him at the end of ten years of such
j-. rvice, to apply for a service medal. The
r has been referred to Judge Ad
vocate Dwyer of the division staff for his
opinion. If that opinion should be that
the volunteers cannot be so carried, on
the ground that they are no longer in
the service of the State, an effort will
be made to have the next Legislature do
something in the way of recognizing the
men who have sacrificed so much for
their country, and an effort will be made
to have the legislative body grant to all
such who, during the time they are volun
teers, would be entitled to the ten year
service medal, a decoration of some sort
emblematic of the State's recognition of
their service in the Guard and In the
war.
THE FIFTH REGIMENT.
The Fifth Regiment Infantry expects
to be included in the quota of California
on the second call for volunteers, and it
wants to go as a regiment. To complete
it it will have to have four companies
added and the existing companies will
have to be recruited up to tho maximum.
This the officers say they can do at very
Bhort notice. Last week, in anticipation
of being called to the front, the board of
officers held a meeting and discussed a
plan of action. It was decided that if
called upon to be mustered in the regi
ment will present itself in such a man
ner that it will be a credit to the State.
All of the men who have .been members
of the several companies for some time
and are well up in the tactics will be
furnished with the new uniforms pro
vided by the State, and those who come
under the head of recruits will be fur
nished with uniforms that were in use
prior to the issuance- of the new ones,
and these recruits, instead of being dis
tributed throughout the company, will be
placed at the rear, In order that the well
driiled men may, in marching, show that
they are Boldien and not have their
movements interfered with by men who
in time will be their equals, hut who are
not yet sufficiently well drilled to under
stand the execution of each command. It
la the intention of the officers to be
designated "the Dandy Fifth of Califor
nia." Colonel Fairbanks has the ma
terial to make it such and he will take
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

THE SANTA CLARAS THE COLLEGE CHAMPIONS OF 1898.
IN defeating Berkeley two games out of three : at Recreation Park a month or
so ago, the Stanford University baseball team was unjustly hailed the col
lege champions of 1898. In so fax as downing Berkeley was concerned they
certainly deserve all the honor and glory that could possibly be derived from
such a victory, but in winning from the boys representing- the "blue and
gold" they by no means won the college championship. This honor belongs
exclusively to the Santa Clara Col' i-g-e boys, who, while they did not compete In
what is known as the intercollegiate games, nevertheless met : : and defeated
both Stanford and Berkeley, not once, but a number of times, and i.ri so doing
rightfully deserve the title of "College Champions of 1898.'' Their victories over
Stanford were four in number, the scores being 10 to 8, 9 to 4, 14 to 6 and 10 to 7.
Berkeley they met twice, defeating them In both games by this scror^s.ofll to 2
and 9 to 6, Such is the wonderful record of this great team over thfe. college clubs
and never in the history of baseball did famed Stanford succumb so many times
to the prowess of a single team. The string of games won by these? boys does, not
stop here. Finding the college organizations bo easy they went . in search of
advantage of It to make a display- su
perior to that presented by any of the
troops that have come to this city. !:
THE SIGNAL. CORPS.
During the past week Captain Perkins,
commanding the Second Brigade Signal
Corps, located In this city, has selected
a number of the members of his corps
for recommendation as first-class signal?
men for the Philippine Islands. Now that
their captain has been, commissioned in
the regular army as a lieutenant of the
Signal Corps there has been a revival
of spirit among the men and an ambi
tion to be assigned to duty in that corp3
and show that the high encomium be-
Btowed upon the Signal Corps of San
Francisco by members of Congress, out
side of California Representatives, on
â â  tluÂ» 11th int--t., when the bill for a vol
; unteer signal corps came up for con
i sideration, were well deserved. The men
,in thÂ« corps are all young, proficient
in the work of signaling and some of
; them possess the qualifications required
under the new bill, namely, that of be
ing expert telegraphers, electricians and
< chemists. They are now waiting the i
time when they shall be mustered Into
the service.
THE NAVAL MILITIA-
The fact that a portion of the naval, ml
litia has been selected for active duty has
aroused a spirit of enthusiasm in the
militiamen and those who . wo'Crtd like to
join the Jackles. The organization. will be
kept up and the divisions kept recruited
up so that there will always be a number
of willing men on hand to meet any call
that the Navy Department may make
within the limit of the militia's numerical
strength, and those who will remain be
hind will perfect themselves in all the de
tails of the duties to which they may be
aligned. â  ' '"' â¢ 'â  â â  ' ' -~ '' â ' '-'"
There is only one branch of the militia
that feels agrieved at the course of
events and that is the medical corps
which was not Included in the call. . .
THE VETERANS' BANQUET.
The tenth annual banquet given in the
Occidental Hotel last Wednesday night
by the Veteran Association of the Na
tional Guard of California was attended
by nearly two hundred members and there
were present several invited guests. After
the dinner there came the usual after
dinner speeches and among those who re
sponded were Thomas F.Barry, ex-colonel
of the Third, now lieutenant of artlllery
in the volunteers, who spoke to "The
Volunteers of the Present War: Captain
A. A. Hanks responded to "The Young
Veterans of the Guard;" Col. G. R. Bur
dick responded to "The Twenty-One et
erans Who Enlisted for the Present
War" Colonel Jerry Moore responded to
"The Veterans of the Civil War, and
George T. Bromley responded to The

THIBTY-SECOND DISTRICT CLUB.
Democrats Pass Resolutions Against
the Appointment of the Com
mittee of One Hundred.
The Thirty-second District Democratic
Club held its regular weekly meeting last
night. There was a large and enthusias
! tic attendance. James Boylan made a
1 vigorous speech denouncing the action of
; the Eemocratlc State Central Committee
in appointing the committee of 100 as un
â  Democratic, un-American and without pre-
I cedent. The following resolution was
I adopted by acclamation:
We, the members of the Thirty-second As
sembly District Democratic Club, In regular
meeting, deprecate and denounce the action of
the Democratic State Central Committee in
; the appointment of the committee of 100, there
by constituting a self -arrogated body and ig
noring the wiÃhes of at least 40,000 Democrats
jof this city, and furthermore. giving tht
' power of perpetuating themselves in office
! without tenure or term, which Is certainly
j unAmerloan, unwise and unDemocratlc.
We therefore ask that the secretary of the
i Democratic County Committee address a let
ter to the president of the Democratic clubs
I In each of the AeKembly districts, and there>
! by get a consensus of opinion, and that there
after you cause a regular rrass meeting of the
Democrats of this city to be held at the very
1 earliest and convenient date, for the pur
i pose of harmonizing the Democratic party, bo
that victory may be ours at the next general
election; and
That it Is the sense of the Thirty-second
District Democratic Club that the chairman
and secretary of the Democratic General Com
mittee be notified to call a meeting of the
general committee on or before the iElh day
of June, 189 S.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 31.
Tho resignation of Rev. W. Sawyer of
the Central Christian Church will prob
ahly end in the long desired union of the
two churches of that denomination in this
city. The Central Church was brought
up to a paying membership through the
efforts of Rev. Edwards Davis, and since
he left the pulpit that branch of the or
ganization has been gradually dwindling
away.
On Wednesday evening the church offi
cials will meet and it is stated the resig
nation of Mr. Sawyer will be accepted.
The Central Church agreed to give him a
stipulated salary when he came here a
couple of months ago from Montana. So
far, however, the money has not been
paid, and the church is not in a condition
to keep its promise. A large part of its
former membership, which was attracted
mainly by the peculiarities of Rev. Ed
wards Davis, has fallen away, and there
is now a revival of the effort to unite
with the First Christian Church and to
worship under one roof. The two branches
could support one pastor and be free from
financial pressure, but now there is not
enough membership to support two
churches.
During the palmy days of Rev. Ed
wards Davis the finances of the church
were in such good condition that Rev. Ed
wards Davis frequently gave away on
Sunday evening i.ie whole of the collec
tion for the purpose of advertising his
church. The getting of money did not
seem to trouble the pastor in those days,
and as he was a single man, his personal
requirements were very slight. Now, how
ever, with a decreased membership, the
expenses are greater, and there is a prob
ability of the union, which was upset
about six months ago solely through the
efforts of Mr. Davis, lust at a time when
it seemed to be certain of being consum
mated.

SITUATION UNCHANGED.
T. H. Goodman and F. A. Wadleigh
Beach No Satisfactory Agree
ment at Their Conference.
T, H. Ooodman, general passenger
ng-ent of the Southern Pacific Company,
held a conference yesterday morning
with F. A. Wadleigh of the Rio Grande
and Western Railway in regard to put
ting the reduced second-class rates into
effect via the Ogde/n gateway. In order to
allow the lines out of Ogden to reap the
benefits of increased passenger traffic,
b;u the negotiations were fruitless. Both
Pfiitlt-men were extremely reticent as to
the outcome of: their meeting, and as one
tersely expressed It, "there was no out
< umc" It is practically acknowledged
by all the lines interested, however, that
Mr. Wadleigh, who in reality represents
the Rio Grande,, ajid not all the lines east
of Ogden, as has been report. >d. was un
aueoessful in his endeavor to have the
Southern Pacific Company, as the initial
line, consent to a reduction in rates via
the Ogden gateway, (./onpidorabl- dissat
tlon i.s expressed by the officials of
tlie roads out of cigden as to the disin
clination of the local company t<> <-nt.-r
into the compact. It is now stated that
If the Boutherfl Pacific Company is will
ing to put rates in via Ogden oh a regu
lar basis of division, supposed to be fair
and tiniitablo, the lines out of Ogden
and their connections will immediately
join- But the Southern Pacific Company,
it is said, insists. on $11 SO as its share of
the haul to pgden. On a $20 rate to Mis
souri River points this would leave the
other lines 19 20 as their share. Now as it
is 833 miles to Ogden and 1034 miles to the
river the officials of the ogden lines say
that the demands of the Southern Pacific
Company are unreasonable. Not only
that, but the latter company wishes to
exact the regular 40 per cent on all rates
where such a method of Computation
would bring them a larger return than
$11 SO. In oiher words they desire practi
cally an arbitrary rate from here to Og
den. and as usual with the corporation
"they want all the traffic will bear."
Mr. Wadleigh will have another confer
ence with Mr. Goodman to-day, and It is
possible that something will develop.
Another complication is liable to arise
in case of reductions via Ogden, and that
is the Canadian Pacific's possible inten
tion to make still further reductions in
their rates, and in that event affairs in
railroad circles will become quite inter
f-sting and developments will be anxiously
awaited for by the traveling public.
Died With Cramps.
Ostero Komatsuzaki, a 17-year-ol(J do
mestic employed by T. P. Ryan, was
taken to the City and County Hospital
yesterday afternoon Buffering from severe
pains in his stomarh. He died fifteen min
utes after reaching the hospital, and his
body was taken to the Morgue. The dead
boy had been treated for stomach trouble
by Dr. Katsuki, but the fact that he had
just eaten a meal in Chinatown prior to
taking cramps in his stomach led to the
belief that the food might have contained
poison. The Morgue chemist will make
an analysis of the contents of the
stomach.
Chinatown Blaze.
An overturned lamp started a fire In the
room of Jo Kee at 1020 Dupont street last
evening. An alarm turned in from box
25 brought out the Fire Department, arid
the quick work done by the firemen avert
ed a serious blaze. The damage amounted
to $200, and the loss falls on the lodger,
whose possessions were almost entirely
consumed. ,

WAS TRUE
TO HIS
PROMISE
Faubel Kept His Word
With the Coroner.
A SENSATIONAL SUICIDE
DRINK AND BUSINESS TROU
BLES THE CAUSE.
A Taking-Off That Was a Day Later
Than Was Scheduled in
a Farewell
Letter.
Very early yesterday morning the
dead body of Ernest Faubel was found
in Alta Plaza, just two days after the
expectant Deputy Coroners awaited it.
The Corpse was discovered by Mrs.
Pehafer of 24"ft Washington street. Be
hind this suicide is a sensational stnry
which lends proof to the belief that the
mind of Fauhel was unbalanced at the
time of his raking-off.
On Sunday Coroner Hawkins re
ceived a letter from one Ernest Fau-
HE MADE HIS WORD GOOD.
Ernest Faubel, Who Committed Suicide at
Alta Plaza.
Bel, acquainting him with an Inten
tion on the part of the latter to put an
end to all the ills that flesh is heir to,
as far as he as an individual was con
cerned. Faubel also notified the Cor
oner that his body would be found in
Alta Plaza. Immediately a deputy
was sent to the plaza, but nothing of
the homo genus, cyld and stark, was
discovered. The search forÂ»the writer
of the letter was not relaxed, however.
Monday evening he was discovered in
a saloon on the corner of Fillmore and
Clay, engaged in a game of draw
poker, quite self-possessed and out
wardly calm. To the small band of re
porters that were on his track he, in
answer to their many inquiries, had
but one thing to say and that was that
the Co/oner's letter might be of some
use yet. Yesterday morning the body
of Ernest Faubel was brought into the
Morgue.
Faubel was a young man with bad
habits. His father had supplied him
with mrmey to start a milk depot and
repeatedly he was called upon by the
creditors of his son for the payment of
debts contracted by the latter. ThÂ»j
suicide was a man of small business
ability, which, coupled with a taste for
strong liquor, was the cause of his
failure in the commercial world. Until
two weeks ago he lived with his father
and mother at their home, 2432 Sacra
mento street. Coming home one night
about two weeks ago, and under the in
fluence of drink, he announced in cold
blooded fashion that he had deter
mined to commit suicide. His mother
remonstated with him, attempting to
drive such thoughts from his head. The
son in a frenzy of anger drove her
from the house, and the woman fled
for her life.
After that Faubel moved downtown,
where he lived In a circle of disrepu
table people of both sexes. About a
week ago he was arrested foT disturb
ing the peace, and his father was called
on to pay for the damage he had
caused in his nocturnal maraudings.
Becoming sated with the life of thes
streets on the Barbary C6ast, Faubel
returned to the haunts of his early days
and Indulged his passion for drink.
The letter which Faubel wrote to the
Coroner is very carefully indited, and
shows a chirc-graphy that a man of
fine ability as a penman might envy.
Not a tremor can be discerned in the
writing. In fart, every letter seems to
have been measured. If there was any
emotion back of the hand that penned
those last few lines to the Coroner it
certainly received no outward manifes
tation, either in the composition or the
chirc-graphy itself. The letter reads as
follows:
Coroner Hawkinsâ Dear Sir: By the time
you receive this letter I will be dead to
the world. You will Jind my remains at
Alta Plaza. I wish to be buried as a pau
per. Throw me In a plain redwood box;
that will do just> us as a casket; also
BftVfl fxpen.scs to my friends, as I have
no parents. I rliod a* I have livedâ always
happy and contented. J am perfectly so
berâalso have my right senses when I
committed this deed. Which no doubt will
be a surprise.
I am better off now than I was before,
ap I have friends in both placesâ in
heaven also in holl-so it makes no differ
ence to me where I go. One thing I will
ask of you, Mr. Hawkinsâ and that is to
r.otlfy my relatives of my death. They
may cast their iast looks at my remains
at the MorÂ«uc, where I will lie on a mar
ble slab. I owe a few bills, but they will
be paid in the other world. I am a man
in business, dispose of it in some manner
and give the receipts to the Red Cross So
ciety.
KepordÃ to all the boys and girls. I have
troubles of my own, tell yours to a poMce
man. Yours respectfully,
ERNEST FAUBBL.
The people who saw Faubel on Mon
day say that he was perfectly at ease
and that if he did contemplate suicide
he showed no signs of it. Late Mon
day afternoon he purchased a bottle of
carbolic acid from G. F. Fuller, a phar
macist, on the corner of Clay and Fill
more streets. Fuller had been in the
habit of selling acid to Faubel, who
used it to wash out the sores on his
horses' less. Fuller says that when
Faubel bought the last bottle he was
sober and in good spirits.
The mother of the deceased was
heart-broken. In the letter to the Cor
oner the deceased says he has no par
ents. This was perhaps due to the
malignancy of the sulr!dÂ° because of
parental correction, and his parents' re
fusal to assist him further unless he
divorced himself from his vicious
habits. Mrs. Faubel assigns the cause
of the suicide to an unbalanced mind
and too frequent potations of whisky.
The body was found In the place di
rected by Fauhel in his letter to the
Coroner. Two empty bottles with car
bolic acid labels on them were found
in his pockets. The suicide was true
to his determination and his taking-off
was merely postponed a few short
hours.

gins To-Day to Bakersfield
on the Valley Road.
The San Francisco and San Joa.quln
Valley Railroad will, inaugurate a regular
train service, between Rakersfiirld and
Stockton, commencing to-day. The ser
vice contemplates both passenger and
freight traffic and the first passenger
train will leave Stockton at 7:20 this morn
ing and is due to arrive in Bakersfield at
2:4.", in the afternoon. From Bakerslield
another train leaves at 30:15. arriving in
Stockton at 5:40 p. m. A mixed daily will
also run, Sundays excepted, leaving
Stockton at 9 a. m., arriving in Bakers
field at 11:59 p. m., and going north leaves
Bakersfield at 2:30 a. m. and reaches
Stockton at 3:45 p. m. The distance trav
\ eled is exactly 235.3 miles and the fare
from Stockton to Bakersfield has been
j fixed at $6 75. and from San Francisco to
i Bakersfleld at $6 90, which are the same
as the rates in effect over the Southern

JACK DALY SHOWS
THE WHITE FEATHER
THE WELTEB - WEIGHT WILL
NOT FIGHT M'KEEVER.
McConnell Haa Taken Daly's Place
and Now the National Club
Feels Happy.
For some reason best known to himself
Sam Fltzpatrick, manager for Pugilist
Jack Daly, has refused the offer made
by the National Club for a contest of
twenty rounds between Daly and Mc-
Keever.
It is thought by many of the promoters
of fistic sport herÂ© that one of the local
athletic clubs haa been corresponding
with Fitzpatrick with the view of giving
the National Club a black eye. Doubtless
the tricksters have succeeded, as Fitzpat
rick has taken a very sudden change of
mind concerning the proposed meeting
between the crack welter-weights, and
may not Journey to this coast at all
However, the National Club is not de
pendent upon Fltzpatrick nor his fighting
machine. Jack Daly, and yesterday it
consummated a twenty-round bout be
tween McKeever and .McConnell, who is a
protege of Alexander Greggains.
McConnell, although a light puncher, is
an exceedingly clever fellow, and there
are not a few of the sports who believe
j that the San Franciscan is competent to
best McKeever in twenty rounds. It is
certain that the Eastern writer-weight
will have to use all of his cunning and
hitting powers to win a decision over the
local lad.
Tom Sharkey. "Spider" Kelly and Tim
McGrath have departed for New York.
Tom will sign articles upon his arrival to
I fieht Gus Ruhlin before the Greater New
York Athletic Club for a $7000 purse.
Jimmy Lawlor and Jimmy Riley will

the National Club will match L-awlor to
fight Maxwell on the evening of the Mc-
Keever-McConnell contest.

CLEVER CONVICTS AT WORK.
PRETENDED TO BE IN SEARCH
OF A SUITABLE ROOM.
Impose on a Japanese Servant and
Get Away With Considerable
Money Belonging to -ilia
Employer.
The police are Investigating an unusu
ally bold robbery, which occurred Mon
day aftornoon In the Dunlap house at 220
O'Farrell street.
Shortly after 2 o'clock on the day of the
robbery a well-dressed young man vislt
; ed the house, and after representing him
self as a wealthy horse owner/rented a
! room. He was accompanied by a f ash-
I lonably attired individual, whom he in
troduced as his "backer."
The Japanese servant, who was in
charge at the time, offered to direct the
alleged' horseman to his room. The lat
ter, after profusely thanking him for the
trouble, took him to one side, "just U
have a quiet talk," as he expressed it.
During the temporary absence of the
Japanese, the "backer" of the alleged
horse owner entered the office of the
lodging house, and breaking open a tin
box. which served as a cash drawer,
abstracted $60.
He then left the place, after signaling
his confederate to follow him.
A few minutes after they had left the
house the Japanese became suspicious,
and proceeded to Investigate. On enter
ing the office he found the cash box on
the floor, devoid of its contents. An ex
amination disclosed that the thief had
forced the lid with a jimmy. Suspecting
that one of his visitors had done the job,
the Japanese, after informing the land
lady of the house of the robbery, notified
the police. Detectives Gibson and Wren
were detailed on the case, and after a
thorough investigation they became con
vinced the two strangers had connived to
get away with the money in the tin
box.
The man who first approached the Jap
anese is described as being about 30 years
of age. wearing a light mustache and
dressed in a dark suit of clothes.
His companion is about 35 years of agre,
having a fi^ht mustache, and being fash
ionably dr<-ssed. He is supposed to be
the man who, a short time ago. bunkoed
an Eastern tourist out of considerable
money by inducing him to play an "in
vincible" hand in a game of draw poker.
CLEARING UP TITLES.
Official Investigations of Surveys in
the Interests of Settlers.
Surveyor-General Cleaves of the local
land office has just returned from an ex
tended trip in the southern part of the
States, where he went nearly two weeks
ago to investigate a number of surveys
that have caused some little trouble in the
land office at Washington. These lands
are in Pine Canyon near Mojave, the San
Gabriel Forest Reservation in the Mount
Lowe district, at Calabasas and near Jo
hannisberg.
This trip was made necessary because
of a number of reports of H. L. Collier,
formerly United States Examiner of the
Land Office. Collier got himself very
much disliked by vie heads of the depart
ment and he was given an Indefinite leave
of absence from his duties, which was al
most an equivalent to a dismissal. In or
der to get back into the department he
promised to expose a number of frauds in
the matter of surveys in this State.
I'lM.n being restored to his former posi
tion hf made good his word so far as the
sensational features were concerned, for
his reports alleged the exposure of many
irregularities in the work of surveyors
and deputies in many parts of the State
where there Is and was government lands.
This naturally had the effect of stopping
all issuance of patents by the Federal
Government to the lands in question and
many honest settlers were made to suffer
by having their locations under a cloud.
When Senator Cleaves came into office re
cently he made some inquiry that led
him to the belief that the reports made
by Collier were not correct and that the
surveys had been properly and correctly
made. In order to make no mistake he
went over the ground in person accom
panied by several of the best surveyors
in the State nnrl the deputies whose work
had been questioned.
Upon his return yesterday Mr. Gleaves
stated thai he had found all of the sur
veys correct and the work performed in a
very satisfactory manner. This practi
cally stamps the reports of Collier as
faIHP and it relieves many a settler of
much anxiety, for upon the statement of
the officer that the surveys are all right
there is but little doubt that the gov

ernment will give titles to the lands upon
which many have spent years, money and
Improvements. Surveyor Gleaves says that
he will request all of the land officers in
the States to give him the data relating
to surveys under a cloud in order that he
may make an investigation in the inter
ests of the hundreds of settlers now on
the lands.
AH OPEN LETTER.
From the Agent of the Crocker Eb-
tate Company.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 81. 1898.â T0
the Editor of the San Francisco Call-
Dear Sir: The statement has gone
abroad that the military encampment
on the gmund formerly occupied by
the. Ray District race track was pro
cured through the Instrumentality of
the Market Street Railway Company.
When this was first suggested I did not
think it possible that it would be ac
cepted by the public mind as a sober
fact; but I am confronted to-day with
the irresistible conviction that an ef
fort is being made in certain quarters
to instill into the minds of the great
mass of the people of San Francisco
the belief that the change of encamp
ment from the Presidio to Richmond
was due to the secret and skillful ma
nipulation of the Market Street Rail
way Company; that it was accomplish
ed by collusion with the military au
thorities of the country, and that by
this change the Market Street Railway
Company accomplished the self-seeking
purpose of locating the military camp
where it would do that company the
most good; and that the military au
thorities on their part were vulnerable
to this sordid consideration.
I believe that a simple and truthful
statement of this matter will receive
at the hands of this community due
credit. I therefore beg leave to say,
through your courtesy, that Major
Rathbone of General Merriam's staff,
on behalf of the commanding offWr,
visited my office and asked if the
ground owned by Mrs. Leland Stan
ford and the Crocker Estate Company
could be procured for a camp ground.
He stated that the sewerage and water
conditions existing at the Presidio w^ro
not adequate for the accommodations
of this large number of men, and that
it would require considerable time to
make them so, while the Bay District
track grounds had both sewerage and
water: that the large body of soldiers
could be accommodated there, and that
sanitary conditions made it judicious
to move the camp from the Presidio.
Animated, I trust, by that impulse of
patriotism which is common to every
right-minded American citizen, and be
lieving that my principals, who were all
absent from the State, would confirm
and approve the action, I at once con
sented, and upon presenting the matter
to Mrs. Stanford she as readily con
sented on her part. From that consent
grew the encampment now known as
Camp Richmond, without consultation
with any officer or employe of the Mar
ket street system, and without any
thought or consideration of any benefit
it might possess to the Market street
system.
The administration of all business en
terprises is necessarily in the direction
of increasing their revenues. It is the
natural impulse of business to do so:
but in the instance under consideration
a spirit of hostility to the Market Street
Railway Company is being engendered
by placing it in the unpatriotic light
of having sought to gain a financial
ml vantage out of the national strueerle
in which we are engaged. Being fully
in possession of all the facts which bear
upon this case and knowing that the
accusation is wholly unjust and com
pletely untrue, I have felt that It was
at least incumbent upon me to make
this statement to the public. Respect
fully, CHARLES E. GREEN.

THE NEW MARSHAL.
State Senator J. H. Shine Presented
With a Magnificent Testimonial.
State Senator J. H. Shine of Sonora,
TiK>h:mno County, the newly appointed
United States Marshal to succeed Barry
Baldwin, assumed the duties of his office
yesterday morning. His first official act
after the filing of his bond was the arrest
of Captain Richardson of the bark Aryan
for cruelty to seamen.
Marshal Shine said he did not propose
to make any changes in his office at pres
ent.
The Tuolumne "Independent" of May
2Sth contains a leading article giving the
particulars of a reception and farewell cc
it'i)(|<-(l to the Senator by the citizens of
th<- town of Sonora previous to his de
parture for Snn Francisco. The affair took
place in Turn Vereln Hall in which place
the leading citizens had assembled pre
ceded by a brass band. J. B. Curtin. in
a happy speech, made on behalf of the
people of Tuolumne County a presentation
to the Senator of a handsome gold badge
of office set with diamonds. The Senator
is very proud of the present.

OLD GLORY
FLIES AT THE
MAIN PEAK
Zealandia and China
American Vessels.
IMPROVING THE COLON.
SHE IS BEING FITTED WITH
ELECTBIO LIGHTS.
A Strike Among the Carpenters on
the Zealandia Caused Some Delay
in the Work on the
Troopship.
The steamers Zealandia and China
were passed by the United States Board
of Inspectors yesterday and at noon
the Hawaiian flags on both of them
were hauled down and . Old Glory
thrown to the breeze instead. In the
case of the Zealandia the Jack was set
at the end of the bowsprit and the stars
and stripes were flown from the fore
and mainmast and the gaff. The flags
at the fore and the gaff were brand
new, having been made for the occa
sion, while the one at the main was
part of the steamer's bunting. In
honor of her admission to the Ameri
can merchant marine the China flew
almost the same flags as the Zealandia,
There was no ceremony in either case
and the stars and stripes had been fly
ing over each vessel for nearly an
hour before the general public along
the front were aware that the change
had been made. In future the China
and ZeaJandia will appear in Lloyds
and the American register as "Ameri
can steamers," and not "Hawaiian."
This will mean a big diminution of the
fees earned by the Hawaiian consulate
and will detract considerably from the
importance of Consul-General Wilder
on sailing days.
The work of getting the Zealandia.
China and Colon ready for their trip
to Manila with troops is being rushed
to completion. A temporary stop was
put to the work on the Zealandia early
yesterday morning. The trouble was
overcome, however, and everything
went along as usual. W. Boole, the
shipwright, engaged a lot of men to
do the work required In putting in
extra berths in the steamer. All of
them, with the exception of four, were
union men and they threatened to quit
work unless the non-union men were
discharged.
Mr. Boole was angry, but power
less, and had to give In, so the
non-union men were discharged. Boole
said that had It not been that the work
had to be done In a hurry he would not
have given in, but would have sought
and secured non-union men. The Zeal
andia, like the Australia, is to be fitted
with 491 of Turner's patent bunks.
These* when not in use can be trans
formed into 2931 feet of settees on
which the men can sit and lounge in
comfort.
The Colon Is having a new electric
plant put in and she will be the last
of the fleet to get ready. While on
the Panama route the Colon was lit
with oil lamps, but now that bunks
have to be placed In the 'tween decks
it was not considered safe to extend
the coal oil system that far, so elec
tricity was substituted. The change
will greatly improve the steamer and
will be a blessing to the soldiers when
the tropics are reached.
Work on the China Is progressing
steadily. The quarters for the men in
both her and the Colon are to be vast
ly different from what they were on the
City of Peking and the soldier boys
who will sail on those vessels can de
pend upon having at least a little com
fort.
The boys of the Naval Battalion are
angry. They say the naval authorities
are fooling them and there is a move
ment on foot to form a light battery
a hundred strong and offer their ser
vices to the army. Last week they
were given a year's leave of
absence by the State and told
to report at the naval rendez
vous for enlistment In the service of
the United States. Saturday last they
appeared for examination, but were
told to come again on Sunday. Sun
day the office was closed. Monday they
received a notice to present themselves
Tuesday, and yesterday they were in
formed that Admiral Kirkland had sent

This comes as a great hardship to the
boys of the reserve, as each of them
lost two days' work in order to attend
at the naval rendezvous for examina
tion. It is no wonder, therefore, that
they feel sore over the way in which
they are being treated.
Lieutenant J. T. McMillan, who for
over ten years has been the nautical
expert in the Branch HydrogTaphic Of
fice, has been ordered to report for duty
on the gunboat Wheeling, now at Puget
Sound. Lieutenant McMillan has made
a host of friends while he has been in
San Francisco, all of whom will be sor
ry to hear of his having been ordered
to sea service again. He himself, how
ever, is delighted with the change, and
is hoping and praying that the Wheel

The gasoline launch Belvedere has
been a success ever since she was put
on the Sacramento River. She has
been running opposition to the other
river boats between Rio Vista and Sac
ramento and has done so well that her
owners have decided to improve on her
and give their patrons an improved
service. Hitherto the launch has been
making 9 knots an hour with a 20
horsepower engine, but a 35 horse
power engine has been ordered from
the Union Gas Engine Company, and
with it the Belvedere will be able to
speed up to 12 knots. This will cut her
running time down considerably and
will prove a great bcron to the travel
ing public between Rio Vista and Sac
ramento.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
magnificent new steamer St. Paul is to
be thrown open for inspection to-mor
row evening between the hours of 8 and
10 o'clock. Those who desire to look
over one of the finest ocean steamers
ever built on this coast should apply at
once to the Alaska Commercial Com
pany, 310 Sansome street. The St. Paul
is now lying at section 4 of the seawall.

The British bark Birkdale, which left
here on February 20 last for Algrra Bay,
had a very rough passage. She was
caught in a hurricane and thrown on
her beam ends. Two of her boats were
smashed by the heavy seas and at one
time it was feared that the stout ship
would go to the bottom. She was
straightened up, however, and reached
Algoa Bay in safety a couple of days
ago. .
HAYNES' DOUBLE DEFENSE.
Witnesses to Prove That Lieutenant
Burke Fired the First Shot.
Theodore Park Haynes, through his
counsel, J. N. E. Wilson, will present a
double defense to the charge of murder
against him for the killing of Lieutenant
Burke. One will be insanity at the time
he fired the fatal shot, the other that he
fired in self defense. In his statement to
the court and jury Attorney Wilson said
that he would prove that the police were
responsible for the killing, and that the
first shot was fired by Lieutenant Burke.
Following the statement. George Foley,
the most important witness for the de
fense, was placed on the stand. The wit
ness testified that he was standing near
the defendant's shanty, at the time the
shooting took place, and was positive in
his statement that Burke fired the first
shot. It is claimed by the defense that
other witnesses will testify to the same
effect. After Foley left the stand the
case was continued until this morning.
In trie Divorce Courts.
The following petitions for divorce were
granted yesterday: Alfi.us P. Cade from
Edna N. Cade on the ground of desertion;
B. A. Whittier from Emma F. Whittier;
Jennie Hooper from Henry Hooper on the
f round of failure to provide; Robert
tevenson from Minnie Stevenson on the
ground of willful desertion.
TROUBLE MADE BY
THE SHIP'S CAT.
CAPTAIN AND CEEW OP THE
SEA KING AT OUTS.
Almost a Mutiny Aboard the Bark
Because Both Parties Wanted â¢.
Possession of Pussy.
There was nearly a mutiny on the
American bark Sea King over a cat yes
terday. When the vessel was in New
castle, N. S. W., pussy came aboard and
at once became friendly with the sailors.
The captains child laid claim to thÂ«
feline, but strange to say the animal pre
j ferred the forecastle to the cabin. When
the ship reached this port and
I came to an anchor yesterday, the men
sought to come ashore and bring the cat
with them. The captain and his wife and
child objected most strenuously, but with
out avail, as the sailors would not give
up the pet. Finally Captain Wallace said
that not a man should leave the vessel
unhss the cat was left on board. That
brought the men to time, and pussy was
turned over to Mrs. Wallace. The sail
ors assert however, that as soon as the
Sea King docks, or perhaps before that
the cat will be missing.
Vaughn Was not a Burglar*
John Vaughn, the locksmith, who was
arrested Monday night on a charge of
burglary while calling upon his sweet
heart at the residence of Mrs. J. Edlin,
1216 Laguna street, was discharged hy
Judge Low yesterday morning. His sweet
heart. Miss Hall, was in court and ex
plained to the Judge that it was at her
request Vaughn crawled under the bed
as she did not want any member of tha
household to know that he was in tha
house.
His Trousers Caught Fire.
D. Myers, who is employed in hiÂ» broth
er's sawmill at Fourteenth and Harri
son streets, was taken to the Receiving
Hospital yesterday afternoon with his
left leg and foot badly burned. Myers had
been drinking and crawled into a corner
to have a snooze. It is supposed that ha
had been smoking a cigar which dropped
out of his hand on his trousers and set
them on fire. The loss to the mill by tha
fire was about $100.
