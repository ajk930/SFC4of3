PROOF OF TREACHERY
IS YET ACCUMULATING
SHOWN BY THE
NAVAL COURT'S
INVESTIGATION
Conclusive Proof That the Dis
aster to the Maine Was
Not Accidental.
Facts That Point Most Ominously to an
Explosive Force Directed Against the
Outside to Destroy the Battleship
and the Lives of Brave
Seamen.
On board Here Id- Call dis
patch-boat Albert F. Dewey,
between Havana and Key
West, Feb. 27. â Eager as is
the waiting public for a defi
nite announcement of the
conclusions reached by the
Naval Court of Inquiry, it
may as well be stated now
that the suspense which per
vades the entire country and,
indeed, the whole civilized
world, must be endured prob
ably several weeks longer. I
have studied the situation
carefully. The President and
Cabinet may, perhaps, be cog
nizant af the court's conclu
sions at a somewhat earlier
date, but I shall be surprised
if its findings are made pub
lic before the latter part of
March, and the announce
ment may be delayed even
later. In the meantime the
only good advice is that
which has already prevailed.
Let the American people
abide in patience and wait
with full confidence that jus
tice will be done in the end
dispassionately and without
prejudice.
To-day marks the end of
the first week's session of
the court Never in the his-
Tory of similar proceedings
have such precautions been
taken to guard the facts from
public scrutiny. Never have
officers in either arm of the
service remained more con
sistently reticent under the
orders of their chiefs. Nev
ertheless I have passed many
hours aboard the Mangrove
during the week, and am'in a
position, if not to publish a
report of the evi
dence, to give at least an ac
curate synopsis of the situa
tion as it is to-day.
The first and most obvious
I .conclusion is that already
The San Francisco Call
stated, viz.: that the court's
report must not be expected
soon. The second and most
i important conclusion â the
|one which even the most
i conservative observers must
I have reached ere now â is
I that at the end of the first
j week's work the probability
i is more remote than ever that
the board can ever attribute
the Maine disaster to acci
dental and interior causes.
| The week's work has hardly
been one that tends for peace.
Just in proportion as that fact
has become plainer in the
light of the testimony taken
the evident purpose of the
court of inquiry to make haste
slowly has forced itself upon
those who watch its course.
Had it been possible early
in the investigation with rea
sonable certainty that the
Maine calamity was a misfor
tune only and not a crime the
continued suppression of that
conclusion would have served
the interests neither of the
United States nor Spain. On
the contrary, had the facts
tended to show an accidental
origin of the explosion all
the peace - loving, sober
minded people would have
rejoiced to see even partially
lifted the dark cloud that now
menaces both nations, and
the conservative newspaper
press of America would have
welcomed the opportunity to
relax the dangerous tension
that now prevails.
It was in the hope of some
such early assurance that the
Herald representative watch
ed the first week's proceed
ings of the court. That hope
has almost vanished. The
testimony thus far adduced
points overwhelmingly in an
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898.
I opposite conclusion. That is
i why we are moving so de
jliberately. The Navy Depart
i ment needs time and will
make good use of . it. Un
doubtedly the most import
ant evidence yet taken is that
of Ensign Powelson, the
grave purport of which was
carefully outlined in Friday's
Call and Herald. Mr. Powel
son is one of the most accom
plished of the younger officers
of the navy, especially in the
arts of naval construction, to
which he has given years of
faithful study. His views
even as a theorist would, have
great weight with the naval
board, in the personnel of
which, curiously enough,there
is not a single officer who i s
really eminent in that branch
of naval work; But in Ensign
Powelson's evidence the na
val court is confronted by a
condition and not a theory,
a condition so clearly demon
strated by him as to all but
carry conviction. His exploit
in discovering the green
painted plates from the very
bottom of the ship at a point
in the wreckage which indi
cates they were forced up
ward from their normal posi
tion to a height of some twen
ty feet has been the sensa
tion of the week. Coupled
with the other discovery that
in common with most of the
other wreckage from the
ship's interior these plates
were, not only heaved upward
by some titanic force excited
from some blow, but also .dis
tinctly in the direction from
the port to starboard side.
This fact points most omin
ously, it cannot be denied, to
an explosive force directed
Drimarily, at least, from the

station and stronghold of the British West Indies.
outside rather than inside the
vessel. The unparalleled up
heaval of the ship's decks and
superstructure is consistent
enough with the theory of
the magazine's explosion
alone having caused the dis
aster, but such explosion, of
course, would have tended to
force downward plates from
the ship's bottom and keels,
and could hardly have result
ed by any freak of explosive
gases in an upward thrust
capable of lodging them
twenty feet or more above
their normal position in the
debris.
SPAIN GETTING
READY FOR WAR.
FERROL, Spain, Feb. 27.â
Fhe work of naval construc
tion and armament is being
pushed by the government
with the greatest activity at
the arsenal and dockyards.
So grave an impression
was made on the court at this
discovery that the board, not
content with the immediate
personal inspection of the
wreckage, which seemed to
confirm all Ensign Powelson
had said, directed him to pre
pare at once- elaborate draw
ings illustrating the points
made in his evidence. These
drawings â  Mr. Powelson pro
duced yesterday when re
called for re-examination by
the naval court, and they will
doubtless be filed with the
official report when made to
the department at Washing
ton.
Nor is Ensign Powelson's
testimony unsupported by
other evidence similar in im
port. The further the work
of the submarine divers pro
gresses the more they bring
to light which tends toward
the same unwelcome conclu
sion. Both the 6 and 10 inch
magazines have been suc
cessfully entered, and in each
some most significant condi
tions have been found. The
linings of the magazines in
places are entirely free from
evidences of fire or explo
sion. Six-inch shells have
been found in the magazines
intact and unexploded. Every
where is abundant evidence
of a terrific concussion, but
there are equally plain condi
tions which naval officers re
gard as inconsistent with the
theory of a primary explosion
having occurred. In both
the 6-inch and io-inch maga
zines are found many of the
powder cylinders which,
though smashed and dented
by concussion, have obvi
ously riot been exploded, as
the large-grained brown hex
agonal powder contained in
these cylinders is stored in
bags which in turn are packed
within cylinders themselves,
and ordinary excelsior is used
in the spaces between. Some
of these bags and much of
the excelsior have been found
unscathed by fire. The pow
der for the most part has van
ished, 1 am told. This was
explained to me by a naval
officer as follows; Some of
the powder caps were opened
by the concussion which
smashed them. The subse
quent sinking of the ship
flooded the broken powder
cylinders and the action of
the water soon disintegrated
the powder, which, of course,
ran out of the bags in a thick
ink-like solution and soon
disappeared, leaving little
more than a sediment adher
ing to the bags, One of the
6-inch breech- loading rifles
from the port battery has
been located well over on the
starboard side of the wreck.
Its breech blocks have been
discovered.
All ot these discoveries I
understand have, been de-
tailed at great -length before
the court of inquiry. During
the examination of Powelson
yesterday, and also during the
testimony of Diver Andrew
Olson and others, Captain
Chadwick was particularly
active in the cross-examina
tion, whether from a simple
desire to elicit every available
fact or any feeling of skepti
cism on his part of course it is
impossible to say. It has
been persistently rumored,
however, that the naval court
is not wholly satisfied with
the work done or reports
made by divers up to the
present time. lam inclined
to believe some such feeling
exists and that it is partly re
sponsible for the naval court's
contemplated return to Ha
vana in time to observe the
work of the more efficient
wrecking apparatus now en
route from New York. In
connection with the work of
divers it is painful to have to
record that one of these men,
Martin Riordan, hitherto at
tached to the fleet, was yes
terday returned to Key West
ijn deep disgrace and will
probably .te court-martialed.
The crime of which he stands
accused is no less heinous
than that of pilfering from
the sea chests of dead
sailors and appropriating to
himself various things of
value which it was his duty
to bring to the surface and de
liver to the proper authorities.
One seaman's chest in the
berth deck is said to have
contained savings aggregating
more than $1000. The diver
had been under suspicion.
He was watched by other
divers while at work and the
suspicions verified. Yester
day his quarters were search
ed and many trinkets and
articles of value are said to
have been recovered. On his
arrival at Key West the rep
resentatives of a sensational
New York paper promptly
made overtures to him to sell
what information lie had
gathered under water.
Some effort has been made
and further effort will proba
bly be fnade to give undue
importance to certain testi
many taken by the naval
court Friday from a party of
Cubans resident in Havana
The story of these men was
to the effect that on a ferry
boat crossing the bay one
night some days prior to the
Maine disaster, they over
heard a suspicious conversa
tion between two Spaniards,
whose identity they did not
then and do not now know. Ac
cording to their tale conspirator
No. i was heard to remark to
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
conspirator No. 2 that a little plan
was all arranged and that the rot
ten Yankee battle-ship would be
soon on the bottom of the harbor.
The naval board summoned these
men and heard their story for what
it is worth. I understand, how-
ever, that slight importance is at
tached to it, especially as the Cu
bans unfortunately neglected to
learn the names and addresses of
the two mysterious. bravos.
While the drift of sentiment
among Americans of Havana is UnÂ°
doubtedly as indicated it is proper
to state that loyal Spaniards to a
man still refuse to entertain for a
moment the suspicion that the
Maine was the victim of foul play
or any other than accidental
causes. Many of them scout as
ridiculous the statement that the
harbor is filled with submarine
mines and point to the freedom
with which their own naval and
merchant vessels come and go as
best evidence of the absurdity of
the rumor. Among the Spanish
army officers, though they are as
courteous personally as ever to
American strangers, there is a
rapidly growing feeling of unrest.
Most of them would now welcome
a war with the United States. As
a Spanish lieutenant-colonel said
to me yesterday: "If we must have

PLANS FOR DEFENSE OF SEAPORTS.
DEFENSE OF
PORTS ON
THIS COAST
All the Naval Vessels of
the Station to Be Kept
on Duty.
Cruiser, Baltimore and Gunboat
Bennington Will Remain in
Hawaiian Waters to Pro
tect the Islands.
INTETW YORK. Feb. 27.â A Washing- |
tun special to the Herald says: Fear
iug in the event of hostilities that an
armored cruiser might be sent to the
Pacific Ocean to attack the Pacific
pojrta of the United States the Navy
Department proposes to keep on that
poast the force of naval vessels now i
stationed there. It is recognized by i
the department officials that the \
t-trength of the North Atlantic squad- I
ro-ri would he greatly increased by at- ;
taching the battleship Oregon to Rear :
Admiral Sieard's command, but they 'â 
appreciate the danger of leaving the '
Pacific Coast without a vessel of this |
class, just a? they appreciated the im- :
portancL- of defending the ports of the '
Atlantic coast by vessels of the moni- j
tor type. There are now stationed on
the Pacific Coast the Oregon, coast de- j
fense vessets Monterey and Monad- j
nock and the traJning ship Adams. |
The Oregon, which is at Puget Sound,
will be ordered to leave that port and
proceed to San Francisco harbor, and
her place in northern waters will
be probably taken by the Monterey.
The department recently directed
that the Monadnock be laid in reserve,
but these orders have not been carried
out. and she will probably be sent to
San Diego. Besides these ships the
department has at Honolulu thecruis
er Baltimore and gunboat Benning
ton. No orders have been issued for
the return of these vessels, and in view
of the well known aspirations of the
administration to bring those islands
within American jurisdiction, it is ap
preciated that Spain would probably
attempt to do as much damage as pos
sible to Honolulu. The department
plans contemplate, therefore, the re
tention of these two ships in Hawaiian
w.:tTF. The cruiser Alert and gun
boat Marietta are in Nicaraguan and
Guatemalan waters, respectively.
These ships will in case of trouble be
ordered to proceed to San Francisco
and to hold themselves there ready
active service. The department does I
nut anticipate that Spain will send a I
peel to the Pacific Coast in case of j
war. but there is some expectation
that a detached armored cruiser will
be ordered around to the Pacific to
make a demonstration there with a
view to compelling the United States
to strengthen the naval force there.
There is reason to believe, however,
that the department hopes to check
mate any such plan by a little diver
sion of its own.
One or" the objects of the department
to .â¢securing sufficient men to place the j
cruisers Columbia and Minneapolis in
commission is to attach them to Rear- j
A'lmiral Sicard's command at Key j
West: With these vessels in southern
waters it will be an easy matter to
have them joined by the cruisers New
Â»ork and Brooklyn and to send them
to Spanish waters in order to make a
demonstration upon one of the ports j
of Spain, probably Cadiz. The depart
ment does not anticipate, of course,
that this flying squadron would be able
to take Cadiz or any other fortified
town, but it is appreciated by naval
tacticians that Spain of necessity will
have to keep a force at home to pro
tect her own ports. She will also be
compelled to re-enforce her Cuban
squadron. The result will be that she
will in all probability find it desirable
to divide her forces, which will give
this Government greater advantage
over the Spanish forces than is now evi
dent.
The authorities say that the Colum
bia. Minnesota, Brooklyn and New
York will be the ideal ships to form a
flying squadron. The Columbia and
Minneapolis have a bunker capacity of
1670 tons of coal each, the Brooklyn 1750
and the New York 1290. Their steaming
radius is sufficiently large to enable
them to carry out the programme con
templated by the department, and so
far as obtaining coal on the other side
is concerned the authorities point out
that although coal was a contraband
of war during the rebellion a ship of
the Union had no difficulty in getting
from English merchants all it wanted.
NO trouble is anticipated in the event
; of war in the future in case an Amer
ican man-of-war should run out of coal
on a European station.
The monitor Puritan, which as stated
in the Herald this morning, will be re
tained near Hampton Roads to defend
Baltimore, Washington, Norfolk and
Richmond, will have her repairs com
pleted the first of next week. She now
has a part of her crew, and Lieuten
ant-Commander J. M. Hawley is pre
paring a detail of men who will be as
signed to fill vacancies now existing on
board ship. As to showing plans of
the department with respect to the pro
tection of the Atlantic coast this ex
tract taken from the report of the
Bunce board which met last fall is of
especial interest at this time:
â¢'On the Atlantic coast the positions
mpst likely to be sought by an enemy
are Massachusetts Bay, Long Island
Sound, New York and Chesapeake bays.
The positions strategically Important
for naval defense and which should be
strongly held are the harbors and
their approaches, which are at Port
land, Me., and Provincetown, Mass.,
the eastern entrance to Long Island
Sound, and Sandy Hook at the en
trance to New York Bay, and Cape
Henry Channel at the entrance to
Chesapeake Bay. The entrance to
Delaware Bay and to Port Royal
Sound, S. C, should also be secure
from occupancy. On the Gulf coast
an attack will be through Florida or
Yucatan channels, and the natural de
fense will be on a line from Tortugasto
Key West. On the Pacific Coast the
positions of greatest importance are
Puget Sound, San Francisco Bay, and
contingent on its projected improve
ments, San Pedro Bay. The conditions
at the entrance of the Columbia River
are similar to those at Delaware Bay
as respects its naval importance. Ow
ing to the great distances from this
coast to ports of any sea power except
those of Great Britain to the north
ward, an attack will be an attempt at
seizure of one of these ports. To meet
the enemy in these positions and hold
the lines of defense will be a most im-'
portant work of the navy."
As the Herald showed this morn
ing, the only harbors for which a naval
defense has not yet been provided are
those on the Maine, Massachusetts and
Connecticut coasts. The Terror will ar
rive at the entrance to New York Bay
by Tuesday, and will be held there for

the defense of New York; the Puritafc
will be held at the entrance to Dela
ware Bay; the Amphitrite at the en
trance to Port Royal Sound; and the
squadron at Key West and Dry Tor
tugas.
The turret armor for the battle-ships
Kearsarge and Kentucky will be fin
ished next month. The armor is divid
ed into two groups. The first group
will be accepted or rejected on the
showing to be made by a plate taper
iqg from seventeen to fifteen inches in
thickness, which will be shipped in a
few days to the Indian Head proving
grounds for a test. The plate will be
fired at with twelve-inch guns. Imme
diately after the launching of the two
battle-ships next month the work of
putting on their armor will com
mence. It is expected that they will be
completed and in commission in about
a year. '

AN OUTSIDE EXPLOSION
CAUSED THE DISASTER.
But Before Forming an Opinion the
President Wants to Secure All
the Facts.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
There will be at least another week of
uncertainty of the cause of the Maine
disaster. All the information the au
thorities have concerning the Court of
Inquiry is that contained in a dispatch
from Admiral Sicard received by the
Secretary of the Navy this morning,
announcing the arrival of the Man
grove, with the Court of Inquiry on
board, at Key West. I was told by one
of the officials who saw the dispatch
that it contained no reference as to the
progress of the work yesterday, or any
intimation as to when the court would
be likely to conclude its labors. I was
Reproduced from the New York Herald.
further informed that the court was re
quested by the department to come
back to Key West at this time in order
that the survivors at that place might
at once be examined, so that they could i
be assigned to other vessels, where they
are needed.
It is declared by the department offi
cials that it is not known whether it
will be necessary for the court to re
turn to Havana, In any event its re
port is not expected in Washington be
fore the latter part of the week and it
may be delayed still longer. If the court
does not return to Havana it may be
accepted as a foregone conclusion that
the members of the court are already
convinced that the Maine was blown up
by an explosion from the outside. Their
return on the other hand would indi
cate they have not yet reached a final
conclusion and wish to avail thmeselves
of further evidence from divers and
wreckers. The impression among naval
authorities with whom I talked is that
the court^^ill return to Havana in
order that^*^ery scrap of evidence may
be obtained before they finally put their
conclusions to the Navy Department.
While as anxious as anybody to have
the facts at hand at the earliest pos
sible moment, the President on account
of the gravity of the question wants
the investigation made Just as thor
ough as the circumstances will allow.
All of the officials insist that up to this
time they do not know what the final
conclusion of the board will be. It is
true that they have had the opinion
officially expressed by Consul-General
Lee that everything pointed to an out
side explosion.
The Herald's dispatches and private
letters from officers who were on board
the vessel at the time of the disaster all
indicate that the vessel was blown up
by some exterior agency. The Presi
dent has declared, however, to even his
most intimate friends that he would re
serve his Judgment as to what actually
caused the disaster until he had the
official facts to go upon. Secretary
Long insists that no dispatches from
either Captain Sigsbee or the Court of
Inquiry, which have related in any way
to the cause of the disaster, have been
concealed from the public. But not
withstanding the absence of official in
formation on the subject it may be
stated that none of the authorities an
ticipate the report showing that the
fundamental cause of the catastrophe
was accidental.
The Herald's Key West dispatch pub
lished this morning showing that the
armor belt was blown inward: that six
inch powder cases were crushed longi
tudinally, and adducing the additional
evidences that the keel was forced in
ward, ha^s tended to greatly strengthen
the conviction in official circles that the
explosion came from outside of the ves
sel. Every step taken in the direction
of emergency preparations and in con
sideration of precedents for formulat
ing a demand upon Spain indicates that
Spain is to be held responsible for the
blowing up of the vessel.

Ex-Senator Edmunds on
the Position of

Will Have to Punish the Men

Theory of Government Connivance
Declared Too Horrible to Be
Entertained.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â A Philadel
phia special to the Herald says: The
status of the Maine disaster as effected
by international law was interestingly
discussed by United States Senator
George F. Edmunds at his home this
afternoon with a Herald man.
"While I have not been called upon
to study this instance with minute
care," Mr. Edmunds said, "there have
been cases which were similar, in their
effects at least, and to which my legis
lative duties required me to give care
ful attention. Above all. it seems to
me that American chivalry demands
that we exercise our finest and nicest
sense of honor and dignity, and impute
nothing evil to the Government of
Spain unless most incontrovertible
facts demonstrate such a necessity.
"Our own Government is now with
out precedent of her own making in
the matter. At the time of the Mafia
riots in the State of Louisiana some
years ago, you will remember, the then
Secretary of State, James G. Blame,
contended, and I think rightly, that the
death of a number of Italian subjects
was brought about by circumstances
so extraordinary that the Government
could not be expected to have foreseen
their danger, and, therefore, could not
have prevented it.
"If, in view of these facts, the United
States sought out the real offenders and
brought them to the fullest Justice, he
further insisted that all had been done
that the Italian Government could
properly demand. The offenders were
found, and an attempt was made to
bring them to justice, but the condi
tions were such and public opinion was
so prejudiced that it even affected the
State's courts of Louisiana, and made
it impossible to bring them to jus
tice. Then ihe President was author
ized by Congress to indemnify the wid
ows and children of the Italians who
were killed.
"This case and that of the Maine
disaster are analogous in their effect.
A great wrong has been done this na
tion, and many families have been
sadly broken. The battle-ship was on
j a friendly visit to a friendly port, and
| all propriety demands that the fullest
! restitution shall be made. If some
wicked person or persons were instru
mental in bringing about an explosion
which cost so many lives, then the
Government of Spain must find them
and mete out to them the most severe
punishment which so cowardly a crime
demands. If she does this, 6he has done
her duty, in my opinion. If she fails
to do so, then our national dignity will
force us to compel something else.
"This, of course, is upon the assump
tion that Spain as a Government was
neither instrumental nor had ac
knowledge of the impending catas
trophe. Anything else is too horrible
to contemplate. The dignity and
chivalry of United States forbid deal
ing in suspicions. An efficient board
of inquiry is investigating the matter
in an orderly and commendable man
ner, and when it has announced its
findings we must accept it as truth."
Asked as to what would be the prob
able result if the report of the board
of inquiry should show that Spanish
Government officials were implicated in
a plot to destroy the Maine, Senator
Edmunds repeated that such an as
sumption was too horrible to think
about, unless it was finally shown to
be necessary.
"Spain could not afford to do any
such thing,' he said. "She would for
ever lose all honor among the nations
of the earth. The strained relations
j which have existed between the United
States' and Spain made it incumbent
upon Spain to, take the greatest pre
cautions against accident to our shipa
when they visited the port of Havana,
and it is only fair to assume that
Spain did her duty. Until more facts
| are obtainable from an unquestionable
source we must be content to hope for
the best."

CARIBBEAN SEA
BADLY NEEDED
Required by the United
States to Protect Her *
Interests.
Sobral Wrote Upon This Sub
ject and the Nicaragua
Canal.
From a Strategic Point of View the
Command of Southern Waters
Is Necessary.
\
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
United States looks upon the Caribbean
Sea the same as England looks upon
the Mediterranean, and they go so far
as to state these two seas are similar
in their history and their future. El
Tiempo, a Spanish organ published in
Madrid, credits these words to Lieu
tenant-Commander Jose G. Sobral, the
Spanish officer who the Spanish lega
tion here declared has been relieved
from duty as its naval attache. El
Tiempo has published an article from
the peri of Sobral, which shows what
he has observed of American affairs. It
is also evident, according to officials of
the Navy Department, that he has
colored what he has learned. El
Tiempo says:
"That the Caribbean Sea is from a
strategical point of view of as much
importance to the United States and
other nations of the American conti
nent and even some of the European
nations as the Mediterranean is to
England is a fact so well known that
it is not necessary to dwell upon it.
Rome time ago we published under the
title, "The Key of Panama,' a work by
A. T. Mahan, a c?.ptain in the Ameri
can navy. On the same subject Jose G.
Sobral, naval lieutenant of the first
class and attache of the Spanish lega
tion at Washington, has published a
well-written article ki Hevista Gene/al
de Marina.
"In another article published by said
Sobral some time ago under the title
of 'The Nicaragua Canal' he called at
tention to the aspirations of the North
American Republic in regard to the
Caribbean Sea, not for strategical rea
sons only, but for its commercial ad
vantage and for her own safety and
defense, hence we have to add that
Lieutenant Commander Sobral's words
are worth being taken into considera
tion, especially under the present cir
cumstances. He says: "The United
States covet naval supremacy in the
Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; in
the former to- obtain absolute control of
the future of the Nicaraguan canal; in
the latter in order to have a free road
from the mouth of the Mississippi to
the Atlantic."
"It is difficult to close in a fleet in
the Caribbean Sea on account of its
many outlets, and it is this same diffi
culty which makes it easy of access.
Fortification on different islands bound
ing the Sea of the Antilles to the west
would protect the ports were they to
be erected, but not the channels sep
arating them. For their protection a
large number of cruisers and ships
would be required.
"The interests of England beyond the
Red S.ea have caused her to fortify the
whole road that takes her ships to
Bombay and Singapore and Hong
kong, with naval stations at Gibraltar
Malta, Cypress. Aden and Penang'
These same interests the American
people see for the future not only in the
Caribbean Sea, but in the Gulf of Mex
ico, and this leads them on the same
lines as their brethren in Europe.
"The chain of Antilles hampers them
because It is in the way of the course
of their ships to Central and South
America. Key West is not sufficient
even in connection with the Dry Tor
tugas to Insure the safety of the Flor
ida channel as long as Havana belongs
to Spain.
"The Yucatan channels belong to
Spain and Mexico, so that American
merchant ships with their cargoes
from Galveston, New Orleans. Pensa
cola and Mobile would be endangered
in time of war while passing through
these two channels, and her fleet
would be very apt not to be able to go
to the assistance of the cities named in
case they were threatened by foreign
ships.
"In order to go to the Caribbean Sea,
they have to pass between Cuba and
Hayti or between the latter and Porto
Rico and by St. Thomas, Martinique
and St. Lucia, all of which islands are
under European flags. With what
safety could their ships pass from the
Atlantic to the Pacific in the event of
the opening of the Nicaragua canal?
How cojild they maintain a fleet In the
waters of the Caribbean Sea without
owning an island which would serve
them as a base of operations?"

WILL ATTEMPT
TO CALM THE
EXCITEMENT
Statement to Be Given Out
Soon by the Navy
Department.
In the Face of Evidence of
Treachery Officials Will Say
the Disaster Was Due to
an Accident.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 27.
It is pretty generally believed in
Washington to-night that the admin
istration is now firmly convinced that
the Maine's explosion was accidental,
and these are the reasons for this pre
sumption:
Firstâ The assurance of the Spanish
Government that there were no torpe
does or mines in that part of, the har
bor, known as "Man-of-War anchor
age."
Second â The ordnance experts have
given their opinion that while a mine or
torpedo might tear holes in the vessel's
hull and sink her it could not have
wrought such fearful havoc in the up
per structure of the vessel.
A member of Congress said to The
Call correspondent to-night: "If you
want a scoop just say that a statement
will be given out by the Navy Depart
ment to-morrow or next day which will
assume that the explosion of the Maine
was accidental."
"But such a statement would hardly
be given out in adVancp of the report
of the naval court," suggested the cor
respondent.
"Yes, it will be put out as a 'feeler' "
said the Congressman, who assumed to
know what he was talking about.
"Whether the President and his ad
visers have received any further 'tips'
from Consul-General Lee, Senator
Proctor or members of the naval court
I don't know, but it is certain that they
are now convinced that there were no
torpedoes or mines where the Maine
was anchored. And that the character
of the wreck pointed to an internal ex
plosion."
"But why should the administration
want to make any statement in ad
vance o-f the report of the naval court?"
asked the correspondent.
"Merely to head off the jingoes in
Congress," said he. "The President and
his Cabinet have been anxious and ap
prehensive every day since the disas
ter for fear that the jingoes in Con
gress would break loose and pass a res
olution recognizing the belligerent
rights of the Cubans. Of course, as
everybody knows, the passage of such a
resolution would precipitate a crisis."
The Washington Post, which is gen
erally regarded as the mouthpiece of
the administration, as far as the Maine
affair is concerned, says: "The Presi
dent, it can be again stated, does not
expect war with Spain. He is of the
opinion that the present trouble can be
settled on a basis of diplomatic ne
gotiations if it should be decided that
the disaster to the Maine was not ac
cidental, a contingency which has not
yet arisen and may not arise. The
President expressed himself along these
lines to more than one of his callers
to-day. The belief in the existence of
sub-marine mines in Havana harbor
was unsettled by the positive statement
of Senor Dubosc, the Charge d'Affaires
of the Spanish legation, as well as by
the positive assertion of several naval
officers, who claim to have positive
knowledge. It is said as proving the
truth of Senor Dubosc's statement, that
submarine mines are never placed in
anchorage grounds because the con
necting cables would always be in dan
ger from dragging anchors. They are
submerged in channels whenever they
are considered necessary."
The Post also publishes the follow
ing to show that the explosion may
have been, and probably was, acci
dental:
"In volume X, Chambers Cyclopedia,
page 668, is an account of the terrific
explosion that took place on board the
ship ' European when lying in harbor
at Colon, Panama, on April 3, 1866. It
says: 'At 7 a. m.. on the 3d a most
tremendous explosion occurred in the
afterpart of the ship. It was described
as most rapid, without smoke, but with
a great flame, and the ship was im
mediately after seen to be on fire. The
whole of the deck and cabin aft were
carried away, and the side of the ship
was also much damaged, the plates
above the water-line being blown
away, and the parts below it being
much Injured. For fear of further ex
plosions the ship was towed Into the
bay, where she shortly sunk.' The
conclusion was irresistible that the ex
plosion was due to the nitro-plycerine.
Gun cotton has large explosive power
also. It has been known to explode
without apparent cause. Pending the
result of the official inquiry â  into the
Maine explosion, it is worth while to
remember that similar explosions have
occurred as the result of accident."
NEBRASKA OFFERS AN
ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS.
Citizens From All Parts of the State
Are Deeply Imbued With
the War Spirit.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â A Lincoln,
Neb., special to the Herald says: The
local force in the Governor's office Is
being snowed under by the showers of
letters from different points and so
many individuals in the State offering
their services as volunteers in case of
hostilities with Spain or other foreign
nations.
One letter received to-day is from a
leading Omaha newspaper man, John
A. Pierce, who declares that he Is
ready to go to Cuba and stay there
until the last vestige of Spanish bar
barism 1b swept from the American
continent. N. A. Crum of Crelghton
offers to raise a company, and J. M.
EiUngÃWorth of Gothenburg does the
same. In the list of those writing to.
day C. C. Pulis of Kearney, a graduata
of the State University, who was rec
ommended as able to receive a com
mission in the regular army for his pro
ficiency in military Science and tactics,
is another. Dr. J. H. Downing of Waco
offers his services in any capacity,
while William Neve of Omaha proposes
to raise a regiment of Danish-born
American citizens, who-- will be all
trained soldiers from the State.
The Adjutant-General's office has re
ceived a joint letter from H. H. Rowker
and I. J. Oviatt, veterans of the War
of the Rebellion, who distinctly state
that they offer to enlist as privates,
and that their age, 54 and 56 years re
spectively, will not prevent them from
again serving their country.
Altogether offers to raise regiments
that will aggregate 20.000 men have
thus far been received by Governor
Holcomb. All are placed on file and
careful data sent to General Coppinger,
commanding the Department of the
Platte.
FESTIVE SABBATH AT

Senator Proctor Attends a Bull Fight
and Makes a Speech Whicn
Is Applauded.
Copyrighted. IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Feb. 27.â Suspension of
work on the Maine, a bull fight and tho
fag end of a carnival combined to give
Havana a somewhat gay Sunday.
Senator Proctor was among the Ameri
cans at the bull fight, the star matador
of which was Alazzantini. In a speech
addressed to Acting- Chief of Staff.
General Solano, the Senator said h<;
hoped for peace through means of the
army. A tremendous outburst of
cheering greeted the mention of th^
army. The audience was one-half offi
cers and soldiers.
Divers will resume the work of re-~
covering the Maine's dead to-morrow.J
and the big wrecking tug Jones is ex
pected then also.
Senator Proctor and Captain Sigs
bee dined with General Lee this even

the island in a few days, but will go
leisurely, not expecting the report of
the court of inquiry very soon.

COURT OF
INQUIRY AT
KEY WEST
Arrival From Havana of
the Investigators of
the Disaster.
They Confer With Admiral Sic=
ard, Whose Fleet Is Under
Steam and Ready to Pro=
ceed at a Moment's
Notice.
KEY WEST, Fla., Feb. 27.â
The court of inquiry which has
been investigating the Maine
disaster arrived here this morn
ing on board the lighthouse ten
der Mangrove, the vessel in
which the sessions were held
in Havana harbor. Captain W.
T. Sampson, president of the
court, and Lieutenant-Comman
der Marix, Judge- Advocate,
came ashore this morning and
had a. conference with Admiral
Sicard in the Key West Hotel.
Other members of the court.
Captain Chadwick and Lieuten
ant-Commander Potter, went
aboard their ship, the flagship
Nr'.Y York. The work of the
c< >urt will be resumed to-mor
rnw. It will convene in the
mind States District court
roofia in the Federal building.
Lieutenant John J. Blandln, who
:ftcer of the deck of the
Maine at the time of the disas
ter, will be the first witness
called, and after his examination
all other officers of the Maine who
are here will be called before
the court to testify.
Six vessels of the North At
lantic Meet are now at this port.
These are the flagship New
York, battleship lowa, cruisers
Detroit, Marblehead and Mont
gomery, and the gunboat Nash
ville.
At Dry Tortugas are the bat
tleships Indiana, Massachusetts
and Texas.
Martin Redding, a diver, returned
here to-day. He was taken to Havana
to work on the wreck, and his arrival
to-day caused much comment, it being
said that he had talked too much at
Havana, and had been removed In con
sequence. On his arrival he held forth
at considerable length before a street
corner audience, and but little cre
dence could be given to his numerous
statements.
Rear Admiral Slcard has held fre
quent conferences with Captain Samp
son and: other members of the court of
inquiry: at the hotel. He said to-night:
"I think they ought to get away on
Wednesday. As yet there is nothing i
that can be said about their work."
In reply to a question as to the
rumored removal of the warships to
Cuba, Admiral Sicard said: "The fleet
is not moving and I know nothing
about its gotng to Cuba. Still, you
know I have steam up, and cou-ld go
anywhere If ordered."
He was asked if anything had hap
pened to justify the statement that the
situation was more serious to-day than
It had been, and he replied: "They
know at Washington about that. Just
how strained our relations are with
Spain, I am unable to say."
The excitement yesterday after the
arrival of the Cuban filibusters, headed
by General Nunez and Captain John
O'Brien, completely eclipsed all the do
ings and sayings of the court of inquiry
officers. Their quick departure pre
vented very much being learned as to
the expedition, but the Cubans here
are elated. An expedition has been
preparing to go away from Key West
for some time, but it will probably suf
fer another delay, as the plot has
leaked out through two Spanish spies.
BLOCK THE WAY FOR
NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Democrats in the House Stop Con
sideration of the Artillery-
Increase Bill.
â  NEW YORK. Feb. 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Con
gress is moving slowly In, matter of
granting legislation desired by the
President for the national defense.
Representative Sulzer's ; objection to
â¢ the ' consideration of ' the artillery
increase bill on Friday â allowed the
..sundry civil bill to get .right of way to
. the. House, and made it probable that
.it, will be late in the week before the
â¢ forrner'measjlre.can get through.
â ;â : .Chairman Hull of the Committee on
â¢ Military Affairs told- me to-night
...that., he intended *to press the ar
tillery Increase bill. He was sure
. there .. .would . be objection from
: the Democratic side, : and ' that he
would, have to have a Â° special order
rroni the Committee on Rules, but he ,
believes; he will have no trouble in
: getting such. an order'- at " the proper
. time,;.. ".. .:.'â¢" â¢;,.;..
;. Many .of the Wading Democrats are
taking the same ground as Mr. Sul
. zer on the bill. They consider it a
threat at the liberties of the people
and will try to. make the measure a
â¢ party issue. There are no more earn
est advocates of the bill in the House.
-. however, than Representatives McClel
lan and Cummings of Georgia, When
the emergency legislation-asked for by
the administration will be enacted will
depend largely upon developments in
regard to the Maine disaster s It is
provable the matter will be allowed
to rest until the naval appropriation
bill Is taken up, when, the provision
in that measure for an Increase of SOO
men in the enlisted strength of the
navy will be. amended so as to make
the number 1500.
Senator Hale, chairman of the Sen
ate Committee on Naval Affairs, said
to me to-day: "There is no doubt that
Congress will grant authority to the
Secretary of the Navy to enlist 1500 or
2000 additional men in a provision
which will be incorporated in the naval
appropriation bill. Mr. Roosevelt's
letter requesting the increase was
simply in accordance with the custom
which has been followed by the Navy
Department. It simply pointed out
the navy's needs, and we propose to
provide for them as suggested."
OUR MILITIA SYSTEM
A MATTER OF CONCERN
It Is Begarded at Washington as
One of the Chief Weaknesses of
the Nation.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: One of
the chief national weaknesses of tho
militia system is the fact that the Na
tional Guards are purely State organi
zations. Any officer may resign his
commission or any private may secure
a discharge should the militia be re
quested to serve the Federal Govern
ment. To become United States sol
diers they must volunteer to serve.
War Department officials are doubtful
of the number of militiamen who would
volunteer to serve the nation. Many
National Guards regard themselves as
schools for officers, and many of their
members would enter the service only
with the encouragement of an officer's
commission. The impression prevails
at the War Department that the Na
tional Guards of New York would fall
within this category.
I am told by the War Department
authorities that in the event of the
outbreak of hostilities the Secretary of
War would advise the President to is
sue a call for not less than 350,000 men.
If war is to come it is argued that the
country must be prepared at the out
set with ample men to strike at the
enemy a decisive blow, as well as to
protect the coast and the capital. It
is believed enough militiamen would
enlist to form an important element
in the emergency army.
An abstract of the number of men
in the United States liable to military
duty and who may be drafted, accord
ing to the late State returns of the
adjutant-general of the army, shows a
total of 10,301,339. Enlistments into the
regular army directly would un
doubtedly be very large in case of the
outbreak of war, and the quality of
men who would thus voluntarily put
themselves forward would be excellent.
SWEDES OF ST. LOUIS
EAGER FOR THE FRAY.
Would Avenge the Slaughter of
Many of Their Countrymen on
the Maine.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â A St. Louis
special to the Herald says: The war
feeling is growing in St. Louis. To
day a company of 500 Swedes was
formed. There was a meeting of Suedes
held here Saturday night, when over
200 men enlisted, and at a meeting to
day the number was increased to 500.
They are excited over the prospect of
war and many speeches were made
denouncing the Spanish. There were
forty Swedes killed in the blowing up
of the Maine, and the speakers said
that their deaths should be avenged.
Another company, to be known as
Company B, with 200 members, was
organized this afternoon. The Busch
Zouaves were also organized to-day,
making fifteen companies thus far or
ganized in St. Louis. Captain Roemer,
who has seen service in the Cuba Libre
army, was elected commander of the
z'u.-ives. He at once wired Governor
Stephens that the company would be

PLATES PREPARED FOR
AN ISSUE OF BONDS.
Secretary Gage Making All Arrange
ments to Negotiate a
Lnrge Loan.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â Secretary
Gape not only contemplates a bond is
sue, but plates are being prepared in
the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
It was published two days ago that he
was conidering an issue in case our re
lations with Spain are broken, but the
growing seriousness of the situation
has caused him to take a great step in
advance. Engravers have been put at
work, and now they are examining and
preparing plates.
Senator Hanna went to New York to
advise with financiers and he returned
to-night. He went immediately to the
White House and held a long confer
ence with the President. To-morrow
he will confer with Secretary Gage, and
then it will be determined how soon
bonds will be placed and when the call
shall be put forth for bids.
The amount of the bonds probably
will be $2f.0,000,000, 4 per cent and gold
bearing. As the Senate is unalterably
opposed to such an issue, it is under
stood that Secretary Gage will keep the
matter secret until the moment it be
comes necessary to issue the call.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
FROM THE HOLLAND.
Everything Ready for the Final
Trials of the Famous Subma
rine Torpedo-Boat.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â Everything Is
in readiness for the final trials of the
submarine torpedo-boat Holland, and
its actual value to the naval world
will be thoroughly demonstrated in a
few days. The Holland is now moored
to a wharf at the Raritan drydock, at
Perth Amboy, N. J. All day to-day
there was a steady stream of visitors
to the Holland. Mr. Holland's men
sat around and refused to discuss
the boat, and no one. excepting the
Herald and Call representative, was al
lowed on board the boat.
Only a few changes are contemplated
In the mechanism of the boat, A new
rudder lever will bo placed on the
Holland to-morrow, and then the trials
will be resumed in Princes Ray. Mr.
Holland thinks it possible that he will
change the electric engine of tho boat
in order to get more speed out of her.
This week her gun will be thoroughly
tested. A cartridge used in the gun
will, it Is estimatPd. cost $2200, and for
this reason several dummies will be
used. When the gun is found to be in
working order Mr. Holland will sub
merge his boat and blow up a sunken
wreck.
ARIZONA WILL FURNISH

Governor McCord Says There Is No
Alternative But War as Mat

PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 27.â Governor
McCord was interviewed to-day on the
course that should be taken concerning
the destruction of the Maine and said:
â¢'lf it should be proved that the
Maine was blown up by Spain or by
Spanish intrigue, the United States
should declare war on Spain and de
mand Cuba or Its independence and a
large money consideration as Indem
nity. In case of war between the
United States and Spain, Arizona
would put POOD as good soldiers as
ever shouldered a musket into Galves

provide transport for them."
FOUR WARSHIPS
COMMISSIONED
League Island Adds to
America's Fighting
Force.
Repairs on the Miantonomah
Will Be Completed by

For the â¢ First Time in Years the
-Yard's Force Worked on
the Sabbath.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 27.â League
Island Navy Yard was literally
swarmed with visitors to-day in con
sequence of the report from Washing
ton that the cruisers Columbia and
Minneapolis, the double turreted moni
tor Mlantonomah and the ram Katah
din had been ordered to go into com
mission with dispatch. Both cruisers
have skeleton crews aboard, while the
monitor has been lying at her dock for
several years, and the Katahdin since
last winter.
None of the naval officials at the
yard would say anything relating to
the future movements of the vessels,
but from workmen it was learned the
commission orders had ben issued.
This was borne out by the fact that all
day a lage force of men in the con
struction * and repair departments
were actively at work on the Mianto
nomah and the Katahdin. Visitors
were kept off these boats, and only
those having friends among the offi
cers and crew of the cruisers were al
lowed on board.
The repairs to the monitor were all
of a minor nature, and will be com
pleted by Tuesday. Over twenty men
have already been detailed for her,
and her full complement of 150 will be
made up as rapidly as possible.
A large force of inon was busy on
the Katahdin improving her ventilat
ing apparatus and fitting her with
attain pipes. This work will take only
a few days. Sunday work at League
Island is very unusual, and to-day's
action is taken to Indicate that the
Navy Department Intends getting the
vessels ready to sail at a moment's
notice.
This afternoon steam was gotten up
on board the monitor for the purpose
of testing her boilers and machinery.
In one of the lofts nearly one hundred
men were at work on small spars
and boat fittings. Everything is
shipshape on the Minneapolis and Co
lumbia, and beyond filling up their
complement of officers and men and
taking coal and provisions nothing re
mains to be done. This will consume
about five days at the most, and then
both vessels will be ready for active
service.
The work of enlisting men will be
continued until orders to stop have
been received from Washington. Cap
tain Casey, the commander/said he did
not know for what vessel the men now
being enlisted are wanted. The roster
was simply being filled up, and he did
not know how many men were wanted
or where the recruits will be assigned.
TO PHOTOGRAPH SHIPS
BEYOND THE HORIZON.
NEW YORK. Feb. 27.â William A.
Eddy of scientific kite fame offers to
furnish tandem kites for the use of the
UnitPd States Navy at sea. Eddy has
sent an application to Secretary Long
for permission to test his apparatus
for the purpose of photographing
ships beyond the horizon line at sea.
He said to-day that while in Washing
ton several weeks ago he had a talk
with Assistant Secretary Roosevelt, in
which Mr. Roosevelt suggested that he
make application for a test of his ap
paratus. Eddy said that his experi
ments have shown that a kite is much
steadier at sea than on land, and that
tho mast of a battleship is an ideal
place from which to fly kites. He said
that in his letter to the Navy Depart
ment he had pointed out that by the
use of kites carrying cameras photo
graphs of smoke of vessels at a dis
tance of forty-three miles can be taken
and the presence of an enemy can be
detected. He alluded to his apparatus
as a "day pearchiigrht," and said that
it could also be used from a rapidly
moving steam launch to photograph
an enemy's fortifications on land, a
1,;,.,,,;.. lens being employed on the
camera for that purpose.
Eddy referred to experiments on
Governors' Island last year, in which
Lieutenant Wise was lifted forty-two
feet in the air, and said that he could
operate his camera by electricity, and
had no need to send a man aloft to
work them.
DOES NOT MEAN TO
BE CAUGHT UNPREPARED.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt Ex
plains the Activity of the
Government.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 27.â At the
suggestion of Secretary Long, Assis
tant Secretary Roosevelt of the Navy
Department gave out the following
statement in regard to the published
map, with the Maine in Havana Har
bor purpoting to be marked on it:
"As soon as the map was brought to
my attention T sent to Mr. John Russell
Young of the Congressional Library
and got the original. It is simply one
of the innumerable maps of Havana
Harbor. There is not the slightest
sign of a mine marked anywhere on It.
As a matter of fact. I am informed
that this map is one which has been
used in giving lectures at the Colum
bian University."
In answer to the question as to what
was the meaning of the movements
of guns and munitions, Mr. Roosevelt
said:
"It merely serves to show that the
department docs not believe there will
be any trouble, but neither does it in
tend to be caught unprepared if there
should be trouble."
FORMING AN INDEPENDENT
CAVALRY REGIMENT.
Active Recruiting of Cowboys and
Frontiersmen in Arizona's Prin
cipal Towns.
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Feb. 27.â A move
ment Is under way for the formation in
Arizona of an independent cavalry
regiment, composed mainly -of fron
tiersmen well skilled in the manage
ment of horses and arms, and embrac
ing a large number of cowboys.
Companies are being organized at
Prescott. Flagstaff, Phoenix, Globe,
Solomonville. Tombstone and Tucson.
The intention is to be in nowise a part
of the Territorial militia, but an in
dependent command ready to go to the
front at once. The enrollment is ex
pected to reach one thousand.
EVIDENCE
IS MORE
POSITIVE
Divers Continue to Dis*
cover Proofs of Foul
Play at Havana.
More Intense Becomes the War
Spirit in the States South
of Mason and Dixon's
Line.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Feb. 27.â 1 completed to
day a hurried journey from New York
to within a few feet of the battered de
bris of the Maine, over which floats at
half-mast the stars and stripes, and
from Jersey City to the pier where I
took a rowboat in Havana harbor I
heard one topic alone discussed, the
Maine, and discussed by men in many
walks of life. On the way to join the
staff of Herald reporters here I noticed
that in the Southern States, especially,
there is a tendency to become impa
tient of what, rightly or wrongly, is
considered the delay of the United
States Government in taking definite
action. I found that despite the ad
vice of many of the foremost Ameri
cans to suspend judgment and the ob
vious impossibility of action by the
Government before the board of in
quiry completes its work, many South
erners were inclined, to believe the pro
longed inquiry is evidence of hesitancy
rather than determination to be right
before going ahead.
This attitude I found surprisingly
general among railroad men and others
with whom I talked on the way from
Xew York to the wreck itself, and I
could but recall their earnestness In the
matter when I saw the wreck and
Chaplain Chadwick among the coffins
awaiting the spoil of busy divers. I re
port a condition and make no deduc-
tions^
There seems no doubt to-night that
while to-day's evidence before the
board was the most positive and im
portant, yet in ,line with the relations
concerning the position of the bottom
plates made in Friday's Herald, the re
sult of investigation will not reach the
American people officially for a consid
erable time. This fact, taken in con
nection with the growing impatience I
noticed during the journey and among
Americans here, leads to the belief that
interest in the cause of the Maine dis
aster will increase rather than subside
because of the prolonged session of the
board and the delay in an official ex
planation of the means by which the
American crew were killed. The fact
Is that enough of the evidence heard
by the board has been printed in es
sence to convince many beyond doubt
that the ship was anchored over a sub
marine mine and that she swung safely
from her buoy till the very night when
conditions of wind and tide placed her
fairly over the explosives.
Of course, there is absolutely no di
rect evidence yet to prove who, if any,
were in the plot to destroy the ship and
crew and as to who assumed the un
speakable responsibility of causing the
explosion. Few expect that any such
evidence, at least of a trustworthy
character, will be adduced by the in
quiry at this time.
I heard to-day a group of Americans
talk as they looked at the wreck in
the harbor, and one, in explaining the
necessity for caution on McKinley's
part and the possibility of war with
Spain precipitating a general conflict
involving Europe, said, pointing to the
Maine:
"Eyes of thinking men all over tin
world are now directed toward that
twisted iron and that flag at half
mast."
The evidence regarding the upheaval
of the keel, reported by the Herald, is
regarded here as overshadowing all
previous information in significance,
and the daily proceedings of the board
tend to give it greater importance.
Demonstrations are likely to follow
the arrival of the Vizcaya from New
York. She is expected on Monday, and
will be hailed joyously by the Spanish
as the first of the powerful fleet soon
due in Havana harbor, which is to in
clude, besides the Alfonso XIII, nou
here, the Vizcaya's sister ship, Almi
rante Oquendo and the Chrlstobal Co
lon and four torpedo-boats. The known
presence of the American fleet at Key
West, which is regarded here as men
acing, will lend additional zest to thÂ©
greeting accorded the Vizcaya, and at
this writing it is hard to predict what
turn the demonstration on the arrival
of the cruiser will take. I heard one of
the most conspicuous American repre
sentatives here to-day say that if the
Vizcaya and other Spanish ships en
tered this harbor as expected they
would be bottled up here and therefore
trapped in case a foreign fleet appeared
off Moro Castle. The Spanish fleet
may cruise off the Cuban coast near
port.
Captain Eulate will be all the more
heartily welcomed because of the fact
just made known ta Americans b,y the
Herald that he was one of the judges
who passed the death sentence on the
Competitor's prisoners. The extremists
of the anti-American party here will
endeavor to honor him conspicuously
on that account. To make room for the
Vizcaya near the wreck of the Maine
the Alfonso XIII has been moved still
further from the ill-fated American
battle-ship, and the new arrival will
be thus awarded a place of honor near
est the Maine and the most frequented
piers.
There is much speculation here
among both Americans and Spanish as
to whether the Terror will keep the
Vizcaya company on the voyage south
and join the squadron at Key West.
SAGASTA SAYS SPAIN
WILL NOT ARBITRATE.
Bitterly Resents the Suggestion
Reported to Have Been Made
by Bismarck.
MADRID. Feb. 27.â Sehor Sagasta,
commenting upon an alleged interview
with Prince Bismarck, In which the lat
ter is represented as suggesting that
the Cuban trouble should be submitted
to the powers for arbitration, expressed
his astonishment that such an idea
could emanate from Prince Bismarck,
and declared emphatically that "noth
ing but ignorance of the question could
inspire the notion that Spain would
suffer foreign intrusion or submit to
arbitration in her Indisputable rights
of sovereignty."
"Nobody," said the Spanish Premier,
"would dare propose such an absurdity,
and no Spanish Government would list
en or dream of such a proposal."
The Imparcial in an editorial to-day
blames Spanish weakness In the Alll
anca, Venidito, Competitor and other
affairs as "encouraging the United
States in their present bellicose atti
tude." It counsels the Government to
awake to the reality of a situation,
which the good sense of Spanish peo
ple understands and is ready to meet.
WYOMING MILITIA IN

IN TIME OF PEACE PREPARE FOR WAR
FACILITIES
FOR BUILDING
BATTLE=SHIPS
Sixteen Plants Which the
Navy Department Could
Call Upon.
Five Men=of=War Are Now Under
Construction, but the Work
on Them Has Been
Delayed.
The strained relations with Spain,
may or may not culminate in
Hrar, will naturally direct public atten-
I tlon to the size and condition of our
. navy, and also to the resources we
I possess for further expansion and
â¢making good the losses which a naval
â war will necessitate. Owing to the de
cline of our foreign shipping and the
kelow growth of the coasting trade
fthere has been but a slight incentive
(â for organized capital or individuals to
engage in ship-building, and but for
the building of the new navy there
would have been no shipyards nor ma-
Tine engine establishments at the pres
ent time at which war vessels of mod
ern design could be built.
The one hundred and odd millions of
dollars expended In the construction of
the new navy during the last twelve
years have created two armor plants, a
national naval gun foundry, encour
aged the establishment of shipyards,
developed and increased the facilities
of iron and steel plants in the manu
facture Of plates and other material
required in ship-building and kept
manufacturers of projectiles and small
ordnance busy.
When bids were invited in December,
18S6 for the construction of the cruis
ers Newark, Charleston and Baltimore
only three firms responded; namely,
Harlan & Hollingsworth, Cramps and
the Union Iron Works. For the gun
boats Yorktown and Petrel two other
bidders: Columbian Iron Works at
Baltimore, and Reeders, also in Balti
more, responded. These five ship
building nrms represented practically
the private resources of the country
for turning out ships-of-war. Not one
of the navy-yards had the facilities to
build a cruiser, much less an armored
vessel; but now the Brooklyn yard,
Norfolk and Mare Island yards are
provided with tools and other appli
ances for ship and engine building,
and at Brooklyn and Norfolk two bat
tle-ships and two 3200-ton cruisers
harp been built.
That the firms which undertook
building the first cruisers and gunboats
made much money out of the transac
tion is not believed. On the contrary,
they paid for the experience, and the
Government got good vessels at a cost
which would have been doubled in the
navy yards. Meanwhile more ships
were to be contracted for and other
firms came to the front, lured by the
fLpparently liberal compensation and
the credit and standing it would give
as builders of warships.
Two- years after the first batch of
contracts four more firms appeared In
the field, namely, Palmer's, successors
to John Roach, Bath Iron Works,
Moore of Elizabethport and Loring &
Harrison of South Boston. And so with
the business created by the Govern
ment and the consequent competition
of builders the private establishments
have multiplied until there are now six
teen firms to which the Government
can give contracts for vessels with a
reasonable assurance of non-failure.
During this period of twelve years two
firms have gone to the wall unable to
fulfill their contracts except at losses
â which swamped the concerns.
The following list shows the ships
and engine building establishments on
the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Those
marked with a star have facilities for
building armored vessels, cruisers and
torpedo boats; those indicated by a
dagger have facilities for cruisers and
torpedo boats; the others are as yet
only on the torpedo-boat list. None of
those who have made bids without hav
ing the means of carrying out a con
tract are included in the list.

Sparrows Point. Baltimore, has re
cently closed down for want of work.
The establishment has turned out good
work, and has excellent facilities for
cruisers and small craft. In case of
necessity this yard would undoubtedly
be re-opened and prove of great value
to the Government.
While the above list indicates a pret
ty fair resource for the supply of war
ships, their ability to turn out work
with the rapidity demanded during war
yet remains to be tested. Only about
one-half of the establishments enu
merated have furnished vessels. The
others still carry unfilled contracts. At
the start of our navy butldlng con
tractors took work for terms and time
limits which not even the experienced
builders in Great Britain would have
attempted, with the result that the
time limit has always been extended,
and, although the contracts stipulated
penalties for non-delivery on time and
shortage in power and speed, the Gov
ernment very wisely refrained from
collecting the penalties which would
have swamped the builders. As to the
causes of delay in delivering ships ,on
time, these may be summarized as fol
lows: Lack of experience and facilities
on the part of the builders, failure of
rolling mills to supply material and the
multitude of changes and alterations
made by officials of the Navy Depart
ment.
The latter cause, with that of non
delivery of ordnance, has been the
greatest factor in causing long delays,
and etill remains. Left to carry out
the contract according to plans and
' specifications, the experienced builders
I would now be on time were it not for
| the interference of officials and endless
recommendations, suggestions and or
ders of changes in plans. It is only
I fair to state that the bureaus of con
struction and steam engineering have
but a small share In this delay, but the
Government inspector at the works,
whether he be a contractor, engineer
or line officer, does, as a rule, feel it
incumbent to burden the bureaus and
the builders with suggested changes,
and time and money are thus lost with
out any appreciable increase of effi
ciency to the ship, but certainly a great
loss to the builders. This everlasting
time-killingand money-eating business,
without resulting in the production as
yet of a perfect ship-of-war, does not
cease with the delivery of the ship at
the yard, for the alterations frequently
consume four or five months before the
ship goes on her first cruise, and with
the assignment of each new command
ing officer changes are made involving
the expenditure of many thousands of
dollars and loss of time.
An incident which occurred during
one of the spasmodic efforts in the
j French navy some years ago points
j the way out of the difficulty. An offi
cer was assigned to the command of
an armor-clad lying at Toulon ready
for sea, but notwithstanding orders to
proceed with as little delay as possi
ble the captain dallied, urging various
j changes in the ship. At last the Min
| ister of Marine solved the trouble by
I detaching the officious captain and
i turned the ship over to another officer,
i who sagaciously took the hint and
i went to sea at once.
The result of these delays caused by
j Government officials is that contractors
! consider this factor as an additional
| expense, which is included in the surri
j total, but yet for all that Cramps, the
; Union Ironworks and others have been
badly caught, and are seeking remun
eration by claims on the Navy Depart
ment.
In the case of the Indiana the
I Cramps claim $480,231 90; for the Mass
| achusetts, $483,757 49; for the lowa,
! $185,662 2S; Brooklyn, $183,246 62; New
'< York. $211,018 31, and the Columbia,
$192,235 79, making a total claim of
i $1,736,153 29 on account of losses in
[ curred through, changes and delays by
the navy officials. The Union Iron
Works have equally good claims for
extra compensation for delays on the
; Olympia and Oregon, where the Ord
'â¢ nance Bureau failed to deliver the re
i quisite armor and guns until a year
after the builders should have deliv
ered the ships.
The appended tables show the con
tract time in months and the actual
time before the ships were turned over
to the navy yards. The most conspic
uous cases of delay attributable to
builders" inexperience are the Mont
gomery, Petrel, Concord, Princeton and
Ericsson. The others may be fairly di
vided between the builders' lack of
facilities and Government delay and
Interference. The fact that this coast
draws its supply of ship-building ma
terials from points 2500 to 3000 miles
distant greatly hampers expeditious
work, and Cramps and other Eastern
builders have a decided advantage
over the Union Iron Works in this re
gard:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898.
DEFENSE OF WEYLER,
HATRED OF LEE.
MADRID. Feb. 27.â The Nacional, General Weyler's special organ, takes the entire wind out of the sails of
the Havana correspondents' pet theory of a mine. It says it has consulted one of the chiefs of the army most
authorized to speak on the matter, thus thinly disguising General Weyler himself as the speaker. He says it
is absolutely false that General Weyler took away any documents or plans necessary to the Government in
carrying out the campaign. His defenses of the ports of the island were confined to the mounting of many
cannon of as large a caliber as possible, their positions being a professional secret. The problem of defense has
been thoroughly studied, and the defense of the pcrts of Havana, Matanzas, Clenfuegos and Santiago have
nothing to fear. It would be difficult for a hostile squadron to lay in front of the bay of Havana, for the bat
teries established there would stop it. The article ends up: "The attack on General Lee as having nightly left
Havana for a conference with Colonel Aranguren or other rebel chiefs is an edifying sight."
The feeling here is very bitter against Lee, whose rebel and jin~o sentiments are constantly referred to.
Spaniards look upon him as a most mischievous element in the prevention of a peaceful solution.
delivered January 2, 1899-they are
only one-half completed, and the Ala
bama, Illinois and Wisconsin range
from 25 to 20 per cent in state of com
pleteness, with a good chance of being
two years .behind time and fair claims
for delays owing to the Government's
failure in providing the armor.
Of the unfinished torpedo-boats the
Rogers and Wlnslow, contracted for
May 3, 1895, were to be delivered Aug
ust ~3, 189t>. Rowan contract October 19,
l&yo, to be delivered January ly, 18*7.
The Dahlgren, Craven and Farragut
contracts of October 6, 1836, to be filled
April 8, IS9B, will likely be six months
behind time. As for the seven boats,
Davis, and including McKee, only one,
Gwin, is near completion, although
they were to have been delivered Oc
tober 7 last year.
The submarine torpedo-boat Plunder
was contracted for March 13, 1895, to
be delivered one year from, that date.
She is now nearly two years overdue,
and was only 66 per cent completed
last January.
The foregoing record shows that,
however excellent the ships may be
when completed the vast difference be
tween contract time and actual rime
proves that there is wanted more dis
patch. Allowing one-half of 'the over
time as due to official mismanagement,
there still remain many months for
the contractor to account for. and, as
they are men of business, desirous of
turning- over th^ir money as rapidly a.s
possible, the inevitable conclusion
forces itself upon the public that the
establishments lack the requisite fa
cilities for expeditious work.
Comparing our navy building with
that of Great Britain in its dockyards
and private yards, it will at once be
seen how much quicker our builders
should stir themselves.
The British battleship Magnificent,
14,900 tons, was begun at Chatham
dockyard December 13, 1893, and com
pleted December 7, 1895. in less than
two years. A sister ship, Majestic,
built at Portsmouth, was begun Feb
ruary 5, 1594, completed December 10,
1895, or In twenty-two months.
Prince George of the same tonnage,
from September 10, 1594, to October,
1896. The 14.200-ton cruisers Powerful
arid Terrihle were built and ready for
cruising in thirty months. The list
of names might be lengthened to a
great extent, but it suffices to conclude
with that all the torpedo-boat destroy
ers ranging from 265 to 300 tons have
occupied only from ten to fifteen
months.
It should be noted in this connection
that the building time of the Ameri
can ships is that during which they
were in the builder's hands, and that
from three to. four months at the navy
yard must be added before the vessels
were ready for sea. In the instances
quoted of British navy building the
period is up to the time of being- ready
for sea. This rapidity In ship building
in England has shown itself only dur
ing the past five years, prior to which
the Admiralty and other officials
greatly hampered the work. With the
removal of these causes the private
contractor has been able to make rec
ords, and the dockyards to compete
with outside establishments.
The foregoing record of past and pres
ent shipbuilding presents the query as
to what our shipyards could do in an
emergency. They are hampered with
the uncertainty of prompt delivery of
material, including plates, angles,
shapes and castings. The armor de
livery is another uncertainty. It is,
however, fair to estimate on the pres
ent known facilities of the several
yards and their capacity for expansion
that nine battleships could be built
simultaneously in the four principal
yards, and which with all conditions
favorable could be completed, includ
ing the time at the navy yard, in three
years. Cruisers and gunboats would
require from two years to one year ac
cording to size and general character,
while torpedo boats would consume at
least nine to ten months, under the
most favorable conditions. The navy
yards, would, of course, be fully
occupied with repairing and fitting
out.
The public will realize that different
conditions exist now than obtained in
1860-64. "Ninety-day grunboatg" are a
thins of the past, so are cast Iron
chunks, once denominated as guns,
and while preparations are proinp for
ward and devices made for defense, so
inadequately provided for. the war
may be over with Its terrible conse
quences to be remedied.
CONVENIENT SUPPLY
DEPOT AT ST. LOUIS.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â A St. Louis
special to the Herald says: The Gov
ernment has in stock in the supply de
pot in St. Louis equipment for 5000
men. Wfthin twenty-four hours 2000
infantry, 2000 cavalrymen and 1000 ar
tillerymen could be fully equipped for
service. St. Louis is the base of sup
plies for the West and Middle West,
and arms, clothing, saddles, ammuni
tion and tents are kept here.
Major Booth, commanding the arse
nal, received a few days ago five car
loads of clothing, blankets, shoes, hav
ersacks and every other kind of equip
ment for soldiers. The only short sup
ply is overcoats. There are only 1000
of these on hand at the arsenal, but it
is said that no difficulty would be ex
perienced in filling up the stock of
these if it should become necessary.
The supply of rubber ponchos â combi
nation caps and helmejie and extending
over the head and shoulders, back and
breast--is large, and these are of more
importance in the Florida peninsula
and Cuba than woolen overcoats.
The various Western forts are full
and are in a position to move at once.
The majority of them have been com
pletely stocked recently, so that the
vast amount of supplies now at the ar
senal would be used for new companies.

ARE HINTING AT
NEEDLESS DELAY
Americans in Havana
Disposed to Criticzie
the Government.
Many Hold to the Belief That
It Purposely Blocks Full
Inquiry.
This View Not Shared by the More
Conservative Members of the
American Colony.
Special Dispntch to The Call.
HAVANA, Feb. 27.â Many Americans
and some Spaniards here insist that
the investigation into the Maine disas
ter has thus far been superficial and
barren of vital results. They claim
that, though nearly two weeks have
passed, no knowledge has been gained
as to the condition of the forward part
of the hull or as to whether the six or
ten-inch ammunition magazines for
ward to the starboard exploded. They
insist, moreover, that expert divers,
\\ ith enough experience to make draw
ings of the condition of things subma
rine, might have been at work a week
ago and might have settled the ques
tion as to the magazines, at least, ere
this.
Those who hold these views demand
that the hull forward should be raised
without further loss of time and before
it hassunk too deep in forty feet of soft
mud. There are some who go so far
as to charge the Unit. 1 States Govern
ment with adopting the Spanish policy
of delay until the disaster shall be par
tially forgotten.
Many of the Spanish officials are said
to entertain the opinion that this is the
case, ahd to be very well pleased with
the notion.
On the other hand, however, good
judges say tiiat all criticism in this
vein is made without a knowledge of
the facts and that none save the mem
bers of the court of inquiry and their
superiors are aware of all the testi
mony developed or of which submarine
plans have been made. Those also
urge that there is no use trying to raise
the hull until the wreckage of armor,
superstructure, engine, decks, guns and
masts have been taken out. To do this
will take time, and the apparatus for
the work can be found only in the
North.
The court of inquiry is as quiet as
the statue of Memton, as dignified and
as stern. Its members are courteous,
but they feel the deep responsibility
resting upon them. They were not ex
clusive when on shore, and they dined
with the consul-general now and again,
but the wreck was always a prohibited
topic.
If memory did not have a tinge of
tragedy, Havana's harbor would have
appeared commonplace enough to-day.
Kail boats, tugs and launches plied to
and fro all day. Steamers large and
small arrived and departed, and the
bustle of a busy and not specially pic
turesque harbor came and went in the
usual fashion.
It is generally expected that
the court of inquiry will return here
after taking testimony at Key West,
and it is likely that efforts would be
made by agents during their absence
to secure other testimony.
The arrival of a battalion of more
than 2000 regular troops from Barcelo
na, as was cabled, excited public inter
est for the day. Guns were fired,
"vivas" shouted and decorations which
the rain spoiled were displayed. The
men, so it is alleged, are the advance
guard of a division of 11,000 Spanish
regulars, sent to take the place of the
sick and wounded who have returned
to Spain within the last few months.
The Spaniards know that Senator
Proctor is a close friend of President
McKinley, and despite his disclaimer
of a political mission they continue to
attach considerable importance to his
visit at this juncture. Some think that
he has been sent by the President to
make a report upon the situation as
Mr. Blount was sent to Hawaii by
President Cleveland. The Spanish, who
in the main are ignorant of American
customs and political methods, cannot
understand why a former Secretary of
War should come to Havana, and there
are many expressions of surprise that
Senator Proctor is not in uniform in
stead of in civilian dresti.
Great preparations are being made
to welcome the cruiser Vizcaya. Senor
Rivera, editor of La Discusion, says:
"The general impression here Is that
the United States court of inquiry has
already decided that the disaster to
the Maine was the result of an acci
dent."
The grrip is very prevalent in Ha
vana.
TEST OF BIG COAST
DEFENSE GUN.
General Flagler Entertains States
men With an Interesting Ex
hibition on the Potomac.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Gen
eral Flagler, Chief of the Ordnance
Bureau of the War Department, treat
ed a number of Senators and Repre
sentatives yesterday to a practical il
lustration of what can be done with the
new coast defense guns. At his invi
tation Senators Hawley, Carter, Petti
grew and Mitchell and Representatives
Hull, Hemenway, Pitacy and McClel-.
Lan went down to the foot of Washing
ton, on the Potomac River, where they
inspected the new fortifications and the
two ten-Inch guns which have been
mounted in them. One of these guns
mounted nearest the water front corn-
mands the approach up the river. The
other gun on the crest of an elevation
behind the old stone fort has a range
not only down the river but up stream
as well as far as Alexandria. A test
was made with the upper gun. The
gun was first raised and lowered sev
eral times in order that the delegation
might see the working of it, and then
all the men were called into their pit
and the actual test bega:p. Twenty
men were required to work it, and ev
ery one of them knew just what to do
and when to do It. They worked with
the smoothness of veterans, and the
officer in charge informed the visitors
that they would fire the gun up the
river. He chose a spot about one mile
below Alexandria and about six from
the fort where he said the shot would
fall. It was not fired straight up the
river, owing to a number of sailing ves
sels which were in the vicinity and the
officer was compelled to have the shot
drop in shallow water. After the gun
had been properly loaded and the ele
vation had been figured to a nicety one
of the officers touched an electric but
ton, and the ponderous gun slowly be
gan to rise and after getting about
half-way up it began to go faster until
it reached the top, where by the pres
sure of another button it was fired.
The gun was fired three times, and
each time the elevation was so changed
as to send the shell in a different local
ity. Those who did not know of the
nicety with which the course of the
projectiles could be computed feared
that one of them would strike some of
the craft in the river. In fact, when
the first shot was fired it looked as
though it was going directly through a
large three-masted schooner which was
sailing majestically up the river under
full canvas. After the. shot was fired
the officers could plainly see, with the
aid of field glasses the consternation
caused by the screaming and hissing
of the shell as it passed over the boat.
The crew all ran to the bow and
watched carefully to see if they could
discover what was causing the unusual
noise on the usually silent river. They
gave it up in disgust apparently, but
when a second shot was fired the men
went below. The gun while being de
pressed falls so Mghtly-that one of the
men placed his finger under it to show
that it would not even bruise it. The
recoil is lessened by numerous oil
chambers.
Chairman Hull of the House Commit
tee on Military Affairs stated that the
test yesterday was sufficient to demon
strate the need of materially increasing
the artillery branch of the army. These
high power guns require twenty men
to work, and all have to know exactly
their positions.
STORY OF A PLOT TO
BLOW UP THE MAINE.
In a Letter a Cuban Agent Says
Divers Were Sent Out With
a Torpedo.
KEY WEST, Feb. 27.â The latest
story as to the way the Maine was
blown up Is contained in a letter for
warded by a secret Cuban club In Ha
vana to J. M. Govln, a Cuban insur
gent agent. The club received it In
the ordinary course of the mall. It
was written in English, but was signed
"Maquinista" (Machinist). After a
long preamble, saying that the writer
knew that the Maine's fate was due to
a Spanish plot, the letter goes on to
say that in an old warehouse at Santa
Catalina, 200 yards from where the
Maine was moored, some diving ap
paratus had been hidden and that
from this base two divers had worked
by night and filled the torpedo holes
of the Maine with the dynamite cart
ridges connecting with wire to the bat
tery on the land, from which the cart
ridges were exploded. According to the
letter the divers were to have been
paid a large sum, which has not been
forthcoming.
The Cubans in Key West say that
the investigation in Havana has tend
ed to confirm the statements of the
letter, which will go before the court
of iitauiry. An officer of the Maine,
whose attention was called to the story
to-day, asserted positively to the cor
respondent that the torpedo holes of
the Maine had not been opened during
their stay in the harbor.
HOW PARISIAN PAPERS
VIEW THE SITUATION.
Believe War on the Point of Break
ing Out â Uncle Sam Advised
to Think Twice.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â A Paris cable
says: Le Temps says of the Maine
disaster: Not only do the facts which
have leaked out so far point to a sub
marine mine as the cause of the dis
aster, but there is also argument in
support of its being due to design. If
such is the case McKinley will have
great difficulty In preventing a con
flict.
Patrie thinks war on the point of
breaking out between Spain and the
United States, but advises the latter to
think twice before engaging in the con
flict. Spain's army and navy, it says,
arecomposed of seasoned and tried men,
whereas this quality is absent in the
forces at the disposal of the United
States. The American fleet is organized
only for a defensive war. As for the
American army, it is still to be brought
into existence.
NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL
NOT BE FOUND WANTING.
BOSTON, Feb. 27.â The Journal to
morrow will publish the following*
NASHUA, N. H., Feb. 27.- War Is al
ways a terrible calamity. I do not believe
it will come out of the present complica
tions. If it must come New Hampshire
will be found ready and willing, as in the
past, to do her full share in maintaining
the honor of the republic.

DEPARTMENT
MEN AT WORK
ON SUNDAY
Secretary Long and His
Assistants Labor
Constantly.
Spain's Representative at Washing
ton Gives Out Assurances That
the Public in General Is
Not Inclined to Share.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. ?7.
The usual Sunday quiet was not
broken to-day by any important de
velopments in connection with the
Maine disaster. Captain Crowin
shield, chief of the Navigation Bureau,
came to his office in the Navy De
partment to open the department mail
and a few unimportant telegrams. A
dispatch from Havana confirmed the
press reports that the court of inquiry
left there on the Mangrove for Key
West. The State Department received
nothing from Consul-General Lee dur
ing the day, and the only dispatches of
consequence reaching that department
was from Minister Rockhill at Athens,
briefly stating that an attempt had
been made on the life of King George,
but without serious results. Five shots
were fired by the would-be assassins,
none of them taking effect.
Up to 6 o'clock the dispatches of the
Navy Department were taken to the
officers of the department, and were
not regarded as of sufficient conse
quence to send to the Secretary.
Mr. Long said the court of inquiry
would now proceed with its work at
Key West, examining the witnesses
there, in accordance with its original
plans. No definite information lias
been received as to how much time
would be taken with the inquiry there,
or what the next step would be. Mr.
Long stated that the department was
to-day in possession of no more infor
mation on the cause of the disaster
than it was immediately after the oc
currence, and that no evidence had
been received up to the present time
showing that the disaster was caused
by design. During the afternoon the
Secretary received a call from Assist
ant Secretary Roosevelt, who assured
him that an examination of the map
said to show mines in Havana harbor
disclosed that no such mines were on
the map.
Senor Dubosc, the Spanish Charge
d'Affaires, to-day received a cablegram
from the Minister of State saying that
the new Minister to the United States,
Senor Polo y Bernabe, will start to
morrow from Gibraltar. This will
bring him to Washington in about ten
days. At Gibraltar he will take one of
the German line of trans-Atlantic
steamers touching at that point. The
credentials of the new Minister will be
presented soon after his arrival, and it
is expected his first attention will be
given to the commercial treaty be
tween the United States and Spain
with particular reference to Cuba. His
service as chief of the Commercial Bu
reau of the Foreign Office has given
him charge of the details leading up
to the negotiation of this treatey, and
he will come sharing the earnest desire
of the Sagasta administration to put
through this matter with the least de
lay possible. Minister Woodford has
been carrying on the negotiations with
the authorities at Madrid, and they are
well along toward completion.
Beyond the foregoing dispatch, Senor
Dubosc received no news to-day from
Havana or Madrid. He expressed sat
isfaction at the more conservative tone
of the public sentiment within the last
few days.
Press reports from Madrid stated
that the authorities were jubilant over
the receipt of important favorable in
formation from Havana. Mr. Dubosc
could shed no light on the nature of
this information.
In other quarters, however, the im
pression prevailed that this informa
tion could not refer to the Maine in
quiry, but concerned the general con
duct of the insurrection in Cuba. There
have been strong indications of late
that the autonomist Cabinet, under the
leadership of Govin, who is the recog
nized force of that body, wrruld en
deavor to make terms with the sepa
ratist wing, and in turn secure the co
operation of the insurgents in a move
ment, to conclude the war. How far
this is possible is not known here, al
though it has been expected that Go
vin would succeed in effecting a rec
onciliation. There has been added rea
son for this belief within the last few
days, owing to the fierce attacks made
on Govin by some of the irreconcila
ble elements. He repelled these and
repudiated an alleged letter in which
he was reported to have attacked
Premier Sagasta.
COLLECTING DATA IN
THE PACIFIC STATES.
War Department Figuring on Trans
fer of Troops Should It
Become Necessary.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 27.â 1t is an
nounced here that the War Department
is collecting data which will show how
and in what time troops can be moved
through and ou f of the Pacific Coast
States and probr.bly all Western States.
Telegrams asking for this information
have been received by Governor Rog
ers, and reports forwarded by mail.
Though hundreds of men are going to
Alaska, there are thousands left in
Washington who, according to specials
from every county printed, to -day, will
quickly enlist if volunteers be called
for.
The greatest interest is manifested
throughout the State, and news dealers

Havana, to have doubled and trebled.
Several men, including Colonel Wil
liam Fife, have given up going to Alas
ka that they may be ready for
service if war comes. Colonel Fife
has asked the War Department to per
mit him to offer the first volunteer regi
ment, already partly organized, it
troops are called for. Officers of the
National Guard believe that northwest
ern troops will pass through California
en route to Florida if hostilities are
commenced; otherwise they could be
rapidly sent East over two trunk lines
which traverse the State. The State
National Guard is being recruited to its
full strength.
WOULD RATHER FIGHT
THAN DIG GOLD.
BOSTON, Feb. 27.â Some folks would
rather fight than dig gold. A Klondike
party, made up of residents of Rhode
Island headed by Quincy Andrews, has
delayed departure, owing to the Span
ish trouble. There are about fifteen
solid men in the organization. Each
has a rifle and a first-class outfit for
camp. They have just voted not to
leave next week for Alaska, as con
templated, but to offer their services to
the Government if occasion demands.
The members of several other similar
expeditions slated for an early depart
ure signify their intention of follow
ing the example of the members of this
party.
Shipment of Big Guns.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. â There
were a number of alarming stories as
to heavy shipments of ordnance from
the Washington Navy Yard to New
York for arming the auxiliary of the
new navy. It is said that the depart
ment that so far none of these guns
have been shipped to-day, but that a
few for the Chicago, probably four
teen 5-inch rapid-fire guns, will be
dispatched Monday or Tuesday. With
these guns in place the Chicago would
be pretty well modernized in the mat
ter of armament. She will carry still
her four big 8-inch guns in sponsons
on the spar deck, while on the gun
duck these fourteen 5-inch rapid-fire
guns will replace eight 6-inch guns of
old pattern.
Falls Dead After an Installation.
CHICAGO, Feb. 27.â Charles A. Thie
man, grand president of the Arbiter Stet
zunf? Verein (Workingmen's Mutual Aid
Society), dropped dead on the platform of
the lodge hall to-day. He had just finished
the work of installing officers. More than

iat 1 o'clock. La Champagne was
1 picked up in latitude 45:28; longitude
41:23. and from that point onward no
trouble was experienced. The weather
I was fine until to-day, when a snow
flurry started and the steamships had
ito proceed siowly. A subscription was
' made up on board for the men who so
bravely manned the lifeboat and left
in search of help, and i>ooo francs was
quickly realized.
When La Champagne was entering
! Halifax harbor an address signed by
i all the passengers was presented to
i Captain Poirot to which he made a
i suitable and modest reply. So thankful
â  were some of the passengers to be in
j port that several of them were anxious
I to have some of the clergy on board
; hold a service of thanksgiving.
The accident to La Champagne Is a
i most serious one and will necessitate
| the ship going into a dry dock. La
i Champagne mails were landed here to
i night, and they, with the saloon pas-
I sengers will be forwarded to New York
! to-morrow morning.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â The news pub
i lished this morning that the steamship
, La Champagne was anchored safely on
! the banks of Newfoundland set at rest
the anxiety and fear for the safety of
her passengers and crew, which have
been felt by relatives and friends of all
those on board during the past week.
At the office of the company to-day,
i there were only a few callers. The
j officials had heard nothing more from
the belated steamship, but from the
j moment that they heard of her where
abouts, they hastened to send relief
; steamers to her aid. Agent Bocande,
i and also the heads of the passenger
I and freight departments of the Com
> pagnie Generale Transatlantique, were
jat the company's dock to-day when
!La Bretagne arrived here. La
Bretagne's commander, M. Rupe, as
well as the officers and passengers
learned of the accident to the sister
; ship from Pilot George Waldie. when
â  he boarded the steamship off the Sandy
| Hook lightship at 7:30 o'clock this
morning. The news caused conslder
; able excitement among the passengers,
: and when the vessel arrived at Quar
i antine, additional information was
eagerly sought by all on board.
A representative of the Associate!
Press boarded La Bretagne at quaran
tine and was besieged by officers and
passengers alike for the latest news
about the overdue vessel. A large sup
i ply of morning newspapers was put _.n
board from the Health Officer's boat
- and quickly distributed among the pas
sengers. The reports were read with
much interest by every one. and warn
words of praise were bestowed upon
Third Officer I'nsworth and the othor
; members of La Champagne's crew who
: came so near losing their lives while
making their heroic efforts to get aid
for the disabled French liner. When
j the vessel reached her dock this after
noon Third Officer Unsworlh and Sec
ond Quartermaster Julian Camard of
La Champagne were there speaking to
Agent Bocande. Officer I'nsworth re
ported that of the ten men who
manned the lifeboat and were picked
up six days later by the steamship
Rotterdam, only four were able to
leave their bunks on board the Rot
terdam at Hoboken this morning. Offi
; cer Unsworth showed little of the ef
fect of . his fearful exposure, except
that the skin had peeled from his
, face*
Quartermaster Camard's hands were
blue and swollen from frostbite, but
they were not bandaged. He walked
with difficulty, as his feet were badly
swollen. He made no complaint, how
1 ever, and said he was grateful to ho
alive after such an experience. He
praised the captain and officers and
crew of the steamship Rotterdam, and
said that they were extremely cour
teous and kind to the rescued men.
The remainder of the boat's- crew is
still being cared for on board the Rot
terdam, but, with the exception of Sea
men Oruer and Tanquy, the men will
be able to leave their bunks to-morrow.
As soon as they are able they will be
transferred to La Bretagne, and the
others who are still suffering will be
sent to the French Hospital, 320 West
Sixty-fourth street, this city, where
arrangements have been made for their
reception.

STEAMSHIP
DESTROYED
BY FLAMES
The Legislator, From
Liverpool, Lost
at Sea.
Lives of Two Officers and
Four Seamen Are
Sacrificed.
Survivors Brought to Boston
by the Vessel Flower
Gate.
SEVERAL BADLY BURNED.
Disaster Duo to Spontaneous Com
bustion in a Cargo of
Phosphate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Feb. 27.â The British
steamship Legislator, Captain Tennant,
bound from Liverpool for Colon, was
burned at sea on February 16, in lati
tude 31 deg. 23 mm. north and longitude
44 deg. 10 mm. west. The fire broke out
on February 13 and burned fiercely for
three days, during which time Fireman
Thomas Roberts was burned to death;
Second Officer James Bateman and
Seaman William Angell were drowned
by the capsizing of a boat; Third Offi
cer Martin and Chief Steward John
Gaffney went adrift in another boat,
and Chief Cook Fred E. Lee, crazed by
fearful burns, jumped overboard. The
rest of the crew of thirty men, with
two passengersâ Dr. William E. Morti
mer and wife of Londonâ were rescued
by the fruit steamship Flower Gate and
brought to this port, arriving here to
day. Four of the crew, Chief Engineer
John Troughear, Engineer John Holde,
Fourth Engineer Robert Miln and Sea
man Charles Ibblitson were so severely
injured that they were taken to the
Marine Hospital on arriving at this
port. Holden is not expected to live.
The suffering of those who survived
the fearful three days, in which they
were tossed about by the waves, while
explosion after explosion threatened to
send the fire-bound steamship to the
bottom, makes a tale seldom equaled
in the annals of merchant marine. The
Legislator left Liverpool on February
3 with a miscellaneous cargo, including
phosphate, cotton goods and percussion
caps for Colon and Central American
ports.
At 4 o'clock on the morning of the
13th, without warning, an explosion
took place from half way forward of
amidships, followed by a tremendous
outburst of smoke and flames. All the
firemen and engineers but one came
tumbling on deck, some of them more
or .less burned. The missing man was
Thomas Roberts, and it was not until
two days later that his charred body
was recovered during a lull in the. fire.
The crew was badly handicapped in
fighting the fire, as the hose and pump
ing engine were disabled or consumed.
The fire spread so rapidly that the
forward part of the boat, on which
we're seven men, was cut off, and Cap
tain Tennant called for volunteers to
rescue the remainder of the crew.
Second Officer Bateman and Seaman
William Angell at once offered to row
along the side of the ship and bring
the men aft. One of the boats was
launched with difficulty, as there was
a heavy sea running, and by careful
work managed to reach the almost
doomed men. All were finally taken on
board and the boat dropped astern,
but before the nine men could be
pulled on the afterdeck a tremendous
sea capsized the small boat and every
man was thrown Into the water. After
their heroic work, Bateman and An
gell were the only ones who were not
rescued.
In the meantime, through some con
fusion, another boat had been launched,
and in it were Third Officer Martin
and Chief Steward John Gaffney. An
other big sea swept them away. They
have not been seen since.
The fighting of the flames continued,
and as the fire reached the boxes of
percussion caps there were almost con
stant explosions. During one of these
Fred E. Lee, the chief cook, was so
severely burred that he jumped over
board and could not be saved.
At 8 o'clock in the morning of the
16th the steamship Flower Gate from
Palermo hove in sight. Two boats
were immediately lowered from the
Flower Gate, and after three hours all
those on board the burning vessel
were safely transferred, Captain Ten
nant being the last one to leave. Some
of the crew saved a part of their
clothing, but a majority of those on
board lost everything. The rescue was
none too soon, for as the Flower Gate
started away the fire was seen burning
from the after deck of the Legislator,
and the steamship was apparently con
sumed not many hours after.
The Legislator was a steamship of
1899 tons net register, 2997 gross tons.
Her dimensions were: Length, 330
feet, breadth 40 feet 1 inch, depth 20
feet 2 inches. She was" built at Middle
borough. England in 1888, and was
owned hy the Charante Steamship
Company of Liverpool, England.
CHRIST AND HIS FOLLOWERS.
Rev. W. H. Moreland Says "The
World Judges Him by the Lives
of Christians."
In spite of the weather a large congre
gation was present at St. Luke's Church
yesterday morning. The rector. Rev. W.
H. Moreland, preached a sermon appro
priate to the beginning of Lent. His
subject was, "Christians, the Represen
tatives of Christ."
He said in part: "The world judges
Christ by the lives of Christians. This
would be fair if the world chose those
who obey Christ and live his gospel as
the Master's representatives. The church
asks only the same impartial judgment
accorded to earthly institutions.
"How do you' estimate the value of
Stanford and Berkeley universities to
our young man? Do you judge these in
stitutions by the students at the foot of
their classes, by lu.ers and trlfiers? This
would be unfair. You must judge them
by the most diligent students and esti
mate their value by, the best work they
produce. This is all the church asks for
herself. Judge her by the best char
acters she has produced. Her true rep
resentatives are to be seen in the St.
Pauls, the George Washlngtons, the
Phillips Brookses, the Bishop Kips and i
other heroes who have lifted up the
world.
â¢â¢But the world is illogical and unfair to
tfae church and persists in Judging Christ
by the life of tho average Christian. We
must take the world as we find it. There
fore, let each Christian realize that by
his conduct Christianity Itself stands or
falls.''

STILL BREAKING THE RECORD.
THE speculative markets of the East began to
feel the strain of the Cuban situation last week,
and during the early part there were several
slumps in stocks and bonds in Wall street, but at the
close a reaction occurred and prices took the up
grade again, chiefly under prospects of free importa
tions of gold into the United States from Europe.
During all this uncertainty in stocks and bonds, how
ever, the regular merchandising of the country went
on as usual without a break. Indeed, the movement
of goods was even larger than during the preceding
week, as was shown by the increased bank clearings,
which exhibited a gain of 54 per cent over the same
week in 1897, and, what is still more noteworthy, not
a city of any consequence showed a loss. To realize
what this means it is necessary to. know that over
eighty.cities and towns report their clearings weekly.
Of these eighty cities and towns the three showing a
de-crea.se from last year were Hartford, 5.9 per cent;
Norfolk, 3.5 per cent, and Bay City, Mich., 1 per
cent. Practically every city in the country showed a
gain, and the combined clearings amounted to the
enormous sum of $1,201,874,000.
The failures throughout the country last week were
only 183, against 269 for the preceding week, 258 in
the corresponding week of 1897, 271 in 1896, 234 in
1895, and 272 in 1894.
The main feature of general trade at the moment
is the increased number of mills which are starting up
and the decrease in the number of men on strike. The
business of February thus far reported is said to be
larger than that of any February in the history of the
country. From Kansas City, which is the most im
portant market for agricultural implements in the
country, comes the report that the demand for these
goods exceeds all previous records and sales are
limited only by inability to fill all the orders. Evi
dently the farmers of the United States are buying
tools by the wholesale. From the West and South
come advices of an active and constantly increasing
distribution of merchandise. The dry goods trade of
the Atlantic coast has lately been enjoying quite a
ipurt, and the jobbing business of New York is re
ported exceptionally fine. Wool seems to have
quieted down again somewhat, but the cotton trade
holds its own and rather more. The silk manufacture
is reported unusually active. As for iron, this branch
of trade continues so lively that the different mills of
the country are put to their trumps to fill their
orders.
In California the outlook has been immeasurably
brightened by the recent rains, which have been suffi
ciently copious to almost insure the different crops,
except in two or three sections, and even from these
no grave reports are heard. The tendency in the
leading staples is generally upward, as shown by the
advance in provisions, beef, mutton, pork, beans and
a number of minor articles, while the cereal markets
have weakened but little under the influence of the
rains. At present writing the prospects for the
farmer are brilliant. He sees before him a reasonable
rertairrty of good crops, and an equally reasonable
Duflook of good prices for them. Indeed the only
drawback to the general prosperity is the continued
stagnation in dried fruits and raisins, the latter hav
ing made another decline under an almost complete
absence of orders. At the same time there is a slow
export demand for dried fruits, which, according to
those best posted in the trade, if kept up will reduce
stocks to almost nothing by the time the new output
appears on the market. From this showing dried
fruit operators look for as good prices this year as
last. The wine industry. is still in an unsatisfactory
condition owing to the want of harmony between the
different associations, but the wine-makers of the
State express their conviction that the trade will right
itself before lohg. This conviction is re-enforced by
the fact that shipments of wine from the State to the
East, which for a year or more have shown signs of
languishing, are again exhibiting an increase.
The prospect of a series of nights unrelieved by
street lamps must be depressing to the footpad. He
has been doing well in the glare of the gas, the
illumination, bad as it is, facilitating his work and
enabling him to observe the approach of the police.
Operating in the dark he may not be able to dodge
so effectively. Of course the police have not been
dodging any.
â¦â ;
In case of war this country could send to the front
a full regiment of pugilists. They would not fight
much, but discreet officers would naturally use them
to draw the enemy's fire.
The distinguished persons who are ready to act as
aibitrators between the United States and Spain
could with good taste wait until a request had been
made for their services.
THE GOLDEN WEST EXPOSITION.
GOVERNOR BUDD, in an interview with a
representative of The Call, has announced an
intention to address letters to the Governors
of the various States inviting their co-operation in the
work of preparing for the proposed exposition to be
held in commemoration of the admission of Califor
nia to the Union. It is in every way desirable that
this should be done. The exposition will fall far
short of the opportunity and needs of the time if it
is made merely a State celebration. It is designed to
mark the semi-centennial of the first notable historic
event of the American development of the whole of
the rich region of the Great West, and accordingly
all the States and Territories that have been created
out of the district ought to be workers in the task of
promoting it and sharers in the profits derived
from it.
As a first necessary step toward attaining the de
sired co-operation of the Golden West the Governors
of the different States and Territories will be re
quested to appoint delegates to a convention to be
held in this city, where the whole subject will be fully
discussed and a committee chosen to direct its af
fairs. It is Governor Budd's intention to send these
letters in a short time, and as a consequence the con
vention may assemble at a comparatively early date.
and the joint State project be speedily put forth in a
definite form as a movement deserving the assist
ance of all enterprising men.
The committee to be selected by the proposed inter
state convention would of course not interfere with
the city committee appointed by the Mayor. Even if
the general direction of the enterprise as a whole is
taken by the committee representing the co-operating
States, there will be abundance of work to be done
by San Francisco. The city will be looked to for
leadership in almost every step that is to be taken.
It will need a strong and energetic committee to at
tend to its share of the great task, and there will be
no lack of employment for any one who is willing to
lend a hand and help.
The West has a right to look to Congress for a
liberal appropriation for the enterprise. Certainly as
much should be given for an exposition here as has
been given to Omaha for the display to be made there
this summer. If to this sum to be appropriated by
the nation the Western States add sums sufficient to
make adequate exhibits of their respective resources
and industries, the success of the enterprise will be as
sured. The outlook that this will be done is now
bright, and it is to be hoped the convention to which
Governor Budd will invite delegates from other
States will be held as speedily as is consistent with a
full attendance and good results.
THE STREET-LIGHTING PROBLEM.
IT is by no means creditable to the officials of the
city that so simple a municipal work as that of
street lighting should be a problem impossible of
solution. It would seem to be an easy calculation to
determine how much money is needed to keep the
streets lighted, nor, from the heavy burden of taxa
tion imposed upon the people, should it be difficult to
provide the money required. It appears, however,
that the task is too hard for the Supervisors, and as a
consequence we are to have lights shut off for a
good many nights in each month from now to the
end of the fiscal year.
In every household in the city the heads of families
have to meet this problem. There are so many nights
in the year, so much light will be needed each even
ing, and the cost per month will be so much. In
every family not wholly destitute provision is made to
meet this charge, and as night succeeds night the
family home is duly illuminated. Every Supervisor,
whether of the average caliber or below it, can solve
the problem for his own home, but when he meets
with his fellow Supervisors and proceeds to act for
the city at large his brain seems to give out some
where and then to the annoyance of the public the
lights give out everywhere.
There are people who talk of municipal ownership
of water works and lighting plants. They fondly be
lieve the Supervisors could take hold of the business'
of those works and operate them with success. To
these people the failure of the Supervisors to properly
manage even so small a thing as street lighting
when they have none of the bother of running the
plant will doubtless appear as a direct evidence of
diabolism. "The devil is in it," they will say when
they go out some night and find the streets unlighted,
and they will add, "He delights in darkness and has
put up this job."
The general mass of citizens, however, will not have
to lug in the personality of Satan to explain the
situation to their understanding. It is but another of
the thousand evidences of administrative incompe
tence that is the bane of American municipalities. If
the thing were not of such common occurrence and
so similar to the results of equal incompetence in the
management of all kinds of municipal work there
would be something almost startling in the fact that
a city as rich as San Francisco, having all the ap
pliances of modern science and art at command, can
not keep its streets lighted. As it is the darkness
will simply give occasion to a few more crimes than
usual; life and property will be a little less safe; there
will be some grumbling and some swearing at the
Supervisors, and then, with our habitual American
toleration of official misconduct, we will let the thing
pass and wait for the coming of the new fiscal year.
It is a familiar saying that every community has as
good government as it deserves. San Francisco can
have a competent municipal administration when
she chooses. Our citizens have only themselves to
blame if they permit incompetents to attain office and
control civic affairs, and so long as we walk willingly
in such political darkness it is hardly to be wondered
that occasionally the incompetents turn off the lights
altogether and leave us in physical darkness as well.
A man who has been convicted of obtaining money
by false pretenses may of course reform, and yet he
should hardly be chosen stenographer of a police
court until he had had ample opportunity to de
monstrate that all the pretense had been knocked out
of him by his experience there in an unofficial ca
pacity.
If Mr. Lynn of Oakland is so sure that he is crazy
hr assumed unnecessary risk in making - a desperate
attempt to escape from jail. One of the privileges
freely granted the lunatic is that of shooting his wife,
as Mr. Lynn has done, yet he deliberately puts him
self in the way of being suspected of sanity.
People coming to the coast for the purpose of
reaching the Klondike must beware of local thieves.
If robbed before they set sail they will miss the op
portunity of freezing along the northern trails, nor
ever know the joy of a gum boot diet.
If Weyler should prove to be the wretch who
caused the blowing lip of the Maine and be executed
for it, the fact that a great loss generally causes a
small gain would once more be demonstrated.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898.
MR. TOWNE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
\A R. TOWNE of Duluth has received the wel
/ \ come which San Francisco gives to distin
* guished visitors, even when they come to mar
the joy of a general prosperity by the utterance of a
long drawn tale af woe. He was met at Metropolitan
Temple by an audience large enough to comfortably
fill the building, and comparatively few persons left
during his address. His well turned periods were
cheered at appropriate points, and he was encouraged
to talk until the approach of bedtime near the middle
of the night.
Mr. Towne will deceive himself, however, if he
thinks the welcome accorded to him by the audience
at Metropolitan Temple signified any sympathy on
the part of San Francisco with the crusade he is
preaching. Metropolitan Temple does not hold a
very large gathering. When any discussion is held
there on a subject that really interests the people of
San Francisco the hall is crowded to the doors. The
assembly overflows the auditorium. The very stair
ways are thronged, and not even standing-room
awaits the late comers. The absence of any crowding
at the meeting on Saturday night is itself an evidence
that the great mass of the people of San Francisco
felt no interest, not even that of curiosity, in the cause
of the distinguished orator from the zenith city of the
unsalted seas.
As a matter of fact Mr. Towne came to tell us a
twice-told tale. The people heard all the arguments
of the free silver advocates two years ago, and after
hearing them rejected them. Every development
which has occurred since that time has attested the
wisdom of the vote of 1896. Signs of reviving pros
perity became manifest the day after the election,
and since then the country has moved steadily for
ward until at present it has attained a condition of
industry, commerce and finance that assures the wel
fare of the people so long as that condition remains
undisturbed.
Mr. Towne has nothing new to say for the simple
reason that nothing has taken place since 1896 to fur
nish new facts on which new calamity arguments can
be based. The logic of events is on the side of the
gold standard. Factories closed during the free trade
regime have been reopened, idle workingmen have
found employment, the consuming power of the peo
ple has increased, farmers are receiving better prices
for their products, mortgages are being paid off, our
exports are rising in quantity and value, and the
revenues of the Government, thanks to the Republi
can tariff, are rapidly approaching an income that will
be sufficient not only to defray the expenses of the
nation, but to pay off the debt accumulated during
the operation of the Democratic tariff.
Free silver is virtually a dead issue. Eloquent men
may go about the country delivering lectures on the
subject, but their words are received by the people as
funeral orations. Mr. Towne might as well try to
summon spirits from the vasty deep as to endeavor to
call up again the ghastly phantasm of Democratic
folly that affrighted the timid in 1896. The American
people are honest, and they have common sense.
They will not pay off their just debts, either public
or private, in 50-cent dollars, neither will they vote to
accept such dollars in payment for their own wages or
for the hard-earned savings which they have invested
in banks, building and loan associations and other in
stitutions of the kind.
SO far as they can afford to do so the people of
San Francisco should extend a liberal patron
age to the entertainment given at the Mining
Fair this evening for the benefit of the families of the
heroes of the Maine. This is the duty of the day.
San Francisco has undertaken to manifest the ardor
of her sympathy with the sufferers from the dread
disaster in Havana harbor, and the manifestation must
be made worthy of the city and oi the cause.
The people can with confidence give freely to this
charity, since they are assured the fund raised by the
entertainment will be distributed at once among
those for whom it is intended. This is no yellow
journal scheme for advertising itself and obtaining
money to be held in trust indefinitely. It is designed
for the immediate relief of the stricken families of the
heroic dead and will be applied to that purpose with
promptness and dispatch.
The entertainment provided for the occasion will
in every respect repay the attendance of all, but that
is but a minor consideration in the matter. Rich as
are the exhibits that have been made at the fair of our
golden resources and industries of wealth, the finest
exhibit to-night will be that of a patriotic people re
sponding to the call for relief for the loved ones of
the brave sailors of the nation who died so suddenly
and awfully at thÂ« post of duty, leaving their families
in many cases almost destitute of the means of sub
sistence.
San Francisco has taken the lead of American cities
in the performance of this necessary work of patriotic
relief, and the leadership should be made sufficiently
brilliant to attract emulation elsewhere. If our people
respond liberally to-day a movement will have been
started which will result in obtaining for the widows
and fatherless of the sailors of the Maine a sum suffi
cient to assure them from want and wretchedness
which now threaten some of them. To accomplish
that is an object which certainly appeals to the best
instincts of generous hearts and the response should
be liberal. Let the people bear in mind that all the
money raised at the fair is for immediate relief; it
is not a trust fund.
PRESIDENT DOLE'S LETTER.
WE print a letter from President Dole of Hawaii
in which, in the form of a denial of what The
Call has said about the agreement between
the United States, Japan and Hawaii, in his relation
thereto he remains silent as to the intended effect of
that agreement upon annexation. The Call did no
more than print the day's news in giving currency to
the agreement The annexation press did the same
and hailed it with pleasure as removing an obstacle
to the ratification of the treaty. As it seemed such an
important matter in their estimation The Call war
rantably inferred that it did not come to pass during
President Dole's presence in Washington without his
knowledge and a manifestation of his interest in it.
We understand him now to deny both knowledge and
interest.
May we say, also, that he intends to deny approval
of it? It has not proved the help to annexation that
was expected. Indeed it added to the unpopularity
of that policy, and President Dole's denial of respon
sibility for it will be a boon to the annexationists
who are compelled to throw off as a burden that
which they so recently boasted as a benefit.
It is a pleasing surprise that from the wreck and
debris of crashing institutions pronounced unconsti
tutional there arises, still firm and self-confident,
enough courts to do the pronouncing.
THE DUTY OF THE DAY.
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS.
BY A MODEST CRITIC.
Before the Issuance of the order
which compelled the reticence of naval
officers anent the Maine horror, Ad
miral Bunce, than whom there is no
more respected officer in the marine
branch of the national service, prac
tically indorsed what appeared here a
week ago, viz., that it is possible we
may never know what the initial agent
was that destroyed the ship; if we ever
do, the probabilities are that we shall
learn only when what is left of the hull
has been raised and inspected by ex
perts. The finding of unexploded ex
plosives means nothing; it is no clew
whatever, and the Examiner's silly
story about the cap of a torpedo being
found in what remains of the battle
ship is twin to other lies which have
appeared in that paper. This was told
in an attempt to prejudice local opin
ion, and in an attempt to show that the
Maine was destroyed by an "anchored
torpedo." If the faker only knew some
thing about buoyant mines it would
have suggested that part of the case
of one had been found in the Maine.
This hint had better be watched closely,
for it will possibly be cooked anew by
some "commissioner" as a special dis
patch.
The Havana calamity, it may seri
ously be hoped, will not prove an un
mixed evil. That it has drawn express
attention to our national defenses is
one of the balms that may help to
soothe bleeding hearts. The nation is
all too prone to sleep in the proud
safety which matchless natural re
sources provide. Knowing that we are
practically unconquerable, we invite se
rious annoyance by carelessness that
approaches neglect. General Miles'
statement of the condition of the de
fenses of New York is not exaggerated;
that able soldier sees things as they
are and is not afraid to tell the truth.
Not only do we need trained men to
man guns, fortifications in which to
mount cannon, ammunition that can be
depended on and a perfected system of
land defense, but the navy should be
strengthened so that we may in the
very near future efficiently protect our
coasts, as well as our slowly but surely
growing commerce. It moy be pre
sumed, too, that this serious casualty
will open eyes before blinded to the stu
pidity of attempting to make empire
while the whole of the present seaboard
is so open to attack.
In Frederick W. Lawrence the Ex
aminer once had a "commissioner" to
Cuba. This person should never have
been heard of were he not his brother's
brother. But he is, and so he is per
mitted in the weekly edition of the
orpimental screed to say what he thinks
he knows of "Torpedoes at Havana."
"I have heard it stated," says the
youth, "by Spanish naval officers, that
there is not a spot in the entire harbor
large enough to accommodate an ordi
nary-sized ship that is not protected
by a torpedo." Exactly, enfant. You
are a pocket edition of Julian Haw
thorne â you believe all you hear â you
know nothing yourself â you are of
the supine of the earth. Listen to the
dolt (He is talking of firing a buoyant
mine of electricity from the shore):
"Of course no one except the high offi
cers of the Spanish army and navy
knows the secret of where the torpe
does are located, or has any knowl
edge of the manner of working the ap
paratus, so that any torpedo at any
particular spot may be exploded with
out exploding all of them." It is no
part of the duty of this paper to edu
cate the Lawrences, but the merest
tyro in torpedo defense should know
how securely buoyant mines electrical
ly connected are locked against inter
ference from outsiders. Current is not
generated by imagination â no, not even
when so red-eyed as that of the Ex
aminer's commissioners. A dynamo
might be called in to assist!
Generally speaking, submarine de
fense is intended alone to prevent en
trance to harbors; not for the destruc
tion of ships therein. Mines are laid
in navigable channels â not in anchor
ages. The idea of Havana being
"sown" with torpedoes is fit for the
conception of a child-like and bland
mmd â the mind of an Examiner com
missioner.
As pointed out a week ago, much
force attaches to the question as to
whether the Maine was anchored on
ground usually used for that purpose.
If Captain Sigsbee was compelled to
moor at a buoy, that one fact would
excite grave suspicion, but until it is
known with certainty it is fair to dis
miss the possibility from the mind.
It Is an established principle that war
ships must, wherever possible, depend
on their own moorings, and, presuming
the Maine did this, her destruction by
a buoyant mine is extremely improb
able. If her commander had no choice
of location, this bit of circumstantial
evidence cannot be overlooked.
The latest phase of the Hawaiian
"situation" is the proposal to attach
these islands to this State as a county!
Infatuation on any project equal to
this is, I believe, unique. Does Cali
fornia ask the admittance of the rab
ble of the inhabitants of the islands to
her citizenship? Must this State ac
cept a proposal that increases her re
sponsibilities and. gives no adequate
return? In the defense of the Union
of States California will never rank
second, but why the group of Hawaiian
Islands should be saddled on us (if the
country ia bent on getting them by
hook or by crook) heaven alone knows.
If fourteen men having an interest in
San Domingo can get tools enough to
grab the reins of government of that
republic, and for pay will offer the
whole territory to us, will Pennsyl
vania accept the gift, or shall we make
that other negro land a "county of
California." California neither wants
Hawaii nor its semi-barbarous popu
lation.
There Is under consideration a char
ter which will possibly be the future
organic law of San Francisco. Judg
ing from action already taken it is
proposed to make the Mayor (yet to be)
much of an autocrat. With a percep
tible example in evidence, and one that
should teach, the freeholders will act
wisely If they deny to the city's chief
official inordinate power. Despite his
politics, no man has been seated in
the mayorial chair with more acclaim
than Mr. Phelan. Few who go into
politics have either his education, his
money or his one-time repute for com
mon sense. Yet, hoping, It seems, to
get the help of a newspaper in his
ambitious flight for the Governorship
he indorses each scheme that this par
ticular paper tries to foist on the pub
lic. Given appointive power in degree
he would doubtless have the whole
staff of some journal in municipal of
fice of some kind. Mr. Phelan's name
is to be found as a committeeman on
almost every trothless project that has
been evolved by the Examiner. He
should have a higher idea of his of
fice than he has; he should try to
make of himself a dignified leader of
the people and not a cat's-paw for a
newspaper. Possibly he does not un
derstand that the public is gradually,
but steadily, being undeceived as to the
character of the journal for which he
is ever ready to stand sponsor, but the
breaking of the dawn of intelligence
will come some day. The awakening
will be somewhat rude, too, for those
who worship at the altar of yellow
Journalism, a fact to which Mr. W. W.
Foote could testify if he cared to.
Zola has "gone to his reward," an
other example of the apothegm that
those who have talent and misuse it
occasionally meet stern justice. That
many papers sympathize with the fa
mous writer is no proof of the injustice
of the punishment meted out to him.
The French nation has no wish to dis
cipline those who do no wrong, but
Zola, having erred grossly, is properly
compelled to suffer. It is given to no
man, no matter how able, to dictate to
a people. France, through two juries,
has declared Dreyfus guilty, and that
must suffice. In any event, Zola was
unfitted to champion the cause he es
poused. In other hands an attempt to
get a rehearing of the traitor's case
might have had a better chance of suc
ceeding, though it may well be doubted.
The Academic has spoken in no uncer
tain way the opinion of educated men
of Zola's moral.
"Too much Johnson," says the Chron
icle in discussing the well-known Con
gressman's speech in the House the
other day with reference to the pro
posed annexation of the Hawaiian Isl
ands. There can never be too much of
the class of talk which this stalwart
Republican gave his co-legislators an
opportunity to hear. The man who can
rise above partisan and local issues,
above the reprehensible, but all too
common, desire for immediate popular
ity shows one of the distinguishing
marks of the statesman. "I trust God,"
said Mr. Johnson, "that this question
will not be made a party issue." In
deed, it is to be hoped not. That so
serious a matter as altering what has
been the clear-cut policy of the nation
for a century should be decided on
party lines is a staggering proposal.
This is not a question of protection or
free trade; of bimetallism or monome
tallism. It is a proposal to snap in
twain traditions which bind us to a
principle that has brought prosperity
that is unequaled.
Mr. Bierce, having ceased to write
paragraphs for the Examiner, has turn
ed his attention to political econ
omy. "Money," he explains, "is not
wealth." I agree, but what is wealth?
The word has puzzled many of us. It
means, as a noun, nothing apparently.
I move its expungence from the lan
guage except when desired as an adjec
tive.
NOTE FROM PRESIDENT DOLE.
H e Tal^es Exception to Certain Editorial
Utterances of The Call.
To the Editor of the San Francisco
Callâ Dear Sir: My attention has been
called to two editorial articles pub
lished in your Issues of February 5 and
10, and entitled "Is It Dole's Hand?"
and the "Japanese Race," which, by
innuendo and indirection, announce to
the public, that an agreement has
been entered into between the United
States, Japan and the Hawaiian Gov
ernment, by which the Japanese Gov
ernment has withdrawn its opposition
to the annexation of Hawaii in con
sideration of the extension of the priv
ilege of naturalization in the United
States, to the Japanese. These ar
ticles also suggest that the negotia
tion of this scheme was the subject
of my visit to Washington.
I wish to say that there is no founda
tion of fact in the proposition which
these editorials announce, or in any

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The French cruiser D'Assas has had a
new set of boiler tubes put In, although
the ship is only .one year old. With the
new tubes the boilers developed 8000
horse-power under natural draught, speed-
Ing: the vessel at the rate of 18 knots and
consuming only 1.91 pounds of coal to
each horse-power per hour.
The French navy will shortly be repre*
sented in China waters by four armored
ships, Vauban, C2OB tons; Bayard, OH
tons; Brulx and D'Entrecasteaux, ar
mored cruisers, of 4754 and 8114 tons re
spectively. The cruisers will consist of
Duguay-Trouin, 3593 tons; Jean Bart, 4109
tons; Descartes, 3990 tons; Pascal, 4015
tons, and Eclaireur, 1769 tons, and the
gunboats Surprise of 627 tons and Lion of
503 tons. Rear-Admiral de la Bonnlnlerra
de Beaumont, who served as captain on
the station In 1895 during the Tonquln
war, is to be promoted to vice-admiral
and will have charge of the new squad
ron.
At Kronstadt plans have been prepared
for the construction of a depot for the
storage of "matsut," or liquid fuel. Tha
tanks In the depot will have a capacity
of 17,000 tons and in the building of thesÂ«
tanks old marine boilers will be utilized.
A special Iron vessel of 1000 tons is to bÂ«
constructed, fitted with requisite appa
ratus for the transportation of the pe
troleum fuel from the shore to the ships.
The Admiral Grieg, a coast defense tur
ret ship, is having tanks fitted in her coal
bunkers, and when the Admiral Vrakin
opp returns from China she will undergo
similar alterations and will also be fitted
with new boilers, the present ones having
been thirteen years in the ship.
China's navy building abroad since tha
peace with Japan includes two torpedo
cruisers. Feiying, SSO tons and 22 knots
speed, built at Elbing, Germany; Feiting,
of 1000 tons and 21 knots, built by Arm
strongs, both of which vessels have been
delivered; three protected cruisers of
2550 tons at Elbing of 2950 tons and 19H
knots speed, one of which has been
launched; two protected cruis'rs of 4?/>0
tons and 24 knots speed at Armstrong's,
one of which, Haiyung, which means the
wide ocean. Is launched. Of torpedo
boats, two of 24 knots are building at
Schichau, Elbing, of 130 feet length; t*.^>
at Vulcan, Stettin, of same speed, but t<m'
feet longer, and four 32-knot torpedo-boX
destroyers of 195 feet are building by
Schichau. No armored vessels of any
description have been contracted for, but
these five cruisers, two torpedo cruisers
and four torpedo-boat destroyers, the
completions of which are near at hand,
would be valuable additions to any navy,
as they are unusually fine and speedy;
vessels.
At the Portsmouth dockyard eight ship
wrights on piecework made frequent com
plaints to the yard authorities that the
wages they were able to earn were In
sufficient to support them, but no atten
tion was paid to their complaints. As ak
last resort they addressed a respectful
communication to the Admiralty explain
ing their grievances, and this brought
forth a letter from the Admiralty to the
admiral superintendent ordering the dis
charge of four of the men because the/
had dared to write direct to the Admir
alty. There is great public indignation in)
Portsmouth over the affair, and a publia
meeting was held at which a resolution
was passed by acclamation censuring tha
Admiralty for summarily discharging tha
four men and thereby interfering with,
worklngmen in their right of free speech,
and combination. The First Lord of tha
Admiralty had denied that the men
earned only 8 shillings ($2) a week, but
did not deny that they were unable to>
earn adequate wages. Seve/al members of
Parliament have taken an interest in tha
affair and the Admiralty will be called,
upon to explain its outrageous treatment
of the workmen.

Few W. E. Dugan Declares Treachery in Nation, as in Individual,
Must Be Severely Punished.
Rev. W. E. Dugan, paster of Stewart Memorial Unites Presbyterian
Church, Guerrero street, between. Twenty - second and Twenty - third,
preached to a large congregation last evening on the subject of the Maine
disaster. His theme, "Individual Responsibility,- was a 'continuation of
the previous Sunday evening's discourse on "Shall We Have War With"
Spain?" The treatment of the guilty party Â©r parties was held up as a
moral to those sinning against God. In part he said:
No two things in all creation are exactly alike. There must then be, an indi
vidual cause for every thing, act or event. That is just what we. are recognizing
In regard to the Maine disaster. We have not yet been able definitely to locate
the cause. We may never do so, but we all know that there was an individual
cause, either of nation or private party, either of deliberate determination or of
accident. If we succeed in locating that cause we are going rigidly jto hold the
author of it responsible for the foul deed. If an individual, he iftust pay the
penalty; if Spain, she will be called upon to give an account of her. treacherous
act. No condition of circumstance in either case will justify any excuse.
The Maine went into that fatal harbor never so much as dreaming of a con
cealed torpedo, and if that were the cause of her disaster, she is not In' any way
responsible for her own destruction; but if hundreds of others before her have ',
been so blown up and she thereby knew that deadly enemies lay concealed in '
. the bottom of the harbor, then she would be individually responsible for her
own destruction. :

Arrangements are now almost com

of delegates from the different Celtic
societies of the city met yesterday af
ternoon to prepare for the proper ob
servance of the event. It was report
ed that Woodward's Pavilion had be?n
engaged for the occasion, and it was
decided that the entertainment during
the afternoon should consist of a pro
gramme of stereopticon views of Ire
land and America, with an appropriate
lecture. In the evening literary exer

The programme has not yet been ar
ranged, ncr has the orator been chosen.
That will be done this week, and the
committee having that part of the
work in hand will meet on Thursday
evening.
The celebration of the national day
of Ireland will be of more than usual
significance this yeir. It will be as
well the centennial anniversary of the
achievements of Wolfe Tone and his
band of patriots, whose memories are
dear to. the hearts of every liberty
luving Irishman.
The proceeds of the entertainments
are to be devoted to a fund now being
collected from all parts of the world
for the erection of a monument in Dub-
Jin to the memory of Wolfe Tone, the
Irifh patriot.
A resolution deploring the destruc
tion of the Maine and expressing sym
pathy with those of her crew who were
injured was adopted as follows:
"Whereas, The United States battle-ship
Maine was recently damaged and sunk
In the harbor of Havana by explosive

either accidentally or by design; and
whereas, a large number of brave sol

responsible shall suffer the most extreme
luences, and that the Stars and

The following resolution, protesting
against the proposed arbitration treaty

A TRINITY OF SANCTUARIES.
The Synagogue, the Home and the
Temples Consecrated to a
Godly Life.
Rabbi Isidore Myers delivered an en
tertaining discourse at the Bush-street
Synagogue last evening on the subject
"A Trinity of of the Jewish Sanctuaries."
"There are three kinds of sanctuaries,"
he said, "that have been in vogue among
Jews and will he in use as long as there
.are Jews in the world. When the temple
was destroyed about 1800 years ago the
synagogue was already a place of worship
for the Jews. The first of the trinity is
the synagogue. In the past it was a
home, a school, a place of worship, where
the Jew heard the words of the past,
where he found comfort and words of
courage.
"There is another sanctuary which has
been dear to the Jews! It is the Jewish
home. In this sanctuary every step and

every duty is consecrated to God. The
table is the altar. On it from time to
timt' are kindled lights which tell of the
history of the brave Jews of the past, j
The food is consecrated to God's service. ]
and It is thus the Jew leads a healthy
and temperate life, for those who live up
to the words. Where is there to be found
such love as is found lavished in a Jew
ish home? The synagogue is a sanctuary
for a community. The home is a sanctu- j
ary for the family. The tabernacle that i
was shown to Moses in The wilderness is ;
the model after which every one should
pattern his sanctuary. On the south side j
of that tabernacle, on one side of a cur
tain, stood a seven-branched candlestick.
This is the symbol of light which should
be In every one's heartâ broad-minded
and searching after knowledge. On the
north ride stood a table of gold, cotered :
with golden plates, twelve in number, j
each of which had on it a loaf of shew ;
bread. This teaches us frugality in times
of plenty, also temperance, charity and i
benevolence. Between these stood the !
ark, with the cherubim with outstretched ;
arms, which teaches us to thank God for j
all we possess or are, and at the door was !
the altar of burnt offerings where the ;
priests offered sacrifices to God; so in our j
sanctuaries we must learn to sacrifice, to }
exercise self-denial to our God and to j
man. It was on such altars that our fore- '
fathers for years had offered themselves !
as burnt offerings or martyrs to their
religion and to God. At the entrance to j
the tabernacle were the basins of water '
where the priests cleansed their hands i
before the service. In our sanctuaries we j
must use these basins to keep our hearts I
and minis clean, and in the innermost
sanctuary of our tabernacle we must !
place that reliance and show our grati- ;
tude to God by our good deeds to our fel- j
low man."
Rabbi Myers will lecture on Dreyfus
and Zola next Sunday evening.
ATTEMPTED ARSON.
Martin Aronsohn, a Deaf Mute, Ar
rested on a Groundless Charge.
Martin Aronsohn, a deaf mute, was ar
rested at an early hour yesterday morn-
Ing by Policeman Beach and was booked
at the City Prison on a charge of at
tempted arson. The charge proved to be
groundless and Judge Campbell, after
learning the circumstances from Fire
Marshal Towe, relased Aronsohn on his j
own recognizance yesterday afternoon.
Aronsohn was arrested in a vacant
house on First and Federal streets. A
number of newspapers were strewn along
the hallway and on the stairs. The news
papers were saturated with coal oil, and
this led the officer to suspect that Aron
sohn intended to set the place on fire, and
as he was unable to make himself under
stood he was marched off to prison.
Yesterday morning Aronsohn's wife and
mother were sent for and the former ex
plained her husband's presence in the
vacant house, which belongs to his moth
er, a wealthy lady. It seems that some
one has been persistently destroying the
pipes and other fixtures in the house, and
Aronsohn conceived the Idea of stopping
there all night in the hope of being able
to capture the offender. He sat up till he
got sleepy and had Just lain down on the
floor with a plank for a pillow when the
officer came in and arrested him. The
newspapers were there when Aronsohn
entered the house.
Fire Marshal Towa will appear in court
to-day and ask that the case be dis
missed.

WAS WAGNER A
THEOSOPHIST
Members of trie London
Wagner Society Will
Lecture.
Alice U Cleather, One of Bla
vatsky's Pupils, Now in
the City. â¢
Basil Crump, Vice-Presldent of the
Universal Brotherhood, to
S peaks
A peculiar and somewhat new de
parture in the realms of mysticism is
the endeavor to prove that Richard
Wagner, the musician and composer,
was a firm believer of the doctrines of
theosophy as they are taught to-day.
Two of the most prominent members
of the London Wagner Society are now
in the city and will lecture at the
Golden Gate Hall to-morrow evening
on Richard Wagner as poet, musician,
dramatist and, incidentally, theoso
phist.
The names of the lecturers are Alice
Leighton Cleather and Basil Crump,
and in addition to being well-known
members of the Wagner Society, they
are eminent in the ranks of the theoso
rhists. Mrs. Cleather is the wife of
a well-known British army officer, and
Basil Crump Is the only son of one of
the leading lights of the English bar,
C. Crump, Q. C.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Crump
said: "The philosophy of Wagner re
sembles theosophy in many respects.
He introduced great reforms in musi
cal drama, and revived the old Greek
symbolical tragedy. Many of these,
such as the Prometheus of Aeschylus,
for instance, were performed in con
nection with the schools of mystery of
that time, and in these dramas were
taught the great truths of man's be
ing. In fact, they were tragedies of
the soul. Wagner is chiefly known as
a musician. In reality, lie was a great
deal more than that ; he was a great
mystical poet and philosopher, and his
prose works are as voluminous as his
musical dramas. In his writings he
describes the ancient Greek drama,
and shows that he has based his own
work upon it, at the same time describ
ing his own dramas as tragedies of the
soul. In our lecture we quote from
his own works and give a sketch of his
life, showing how great were the re
forms that he introduced in modern
opera."
Both of the lecturers are accom
plished musicians, and will illustrate
the meaning of the great master with
selections from his works, on the or
gan and piano. Stereoptfcon views of
scenes from "Parsifal," the "Ring" and
"Lohengrin," from photographs taken
at the great festival at Bayreuth, will
also be used to illustrate the lecture.-
Mrs. Cleather, when seen yesterday,
said: "There can be no doubt that
Wagner was a true theosophist, for his
works prove the fact. He was an ar
dent admirer of Schopenhauer, and all
of Wagner's work was composed on
the lines of the teachings of Schopen
hauer. He was a philosopher and mys
tic teacher. He employed music as a
detail only, and not as the most im
portant part of his teaching. The mod
ern revival at Point Loma of a school
of the lost mysteries of antiquity will
accomplish a great deal for theoso
phists and the world, in the direction
of proving the 'Inner Soul Motives' of
the mystic teachers."
Mrs. Cleather was one of the mem
bers of the theosonhical crusade in
augurated by Katherlne A. Tingley,
the high priestess of theosophy, in 1895!
She has traveled much, and is a pleas
ing speaker, her intention being at all
times to convince her audience rather
than to parade powers of flowery rhet
oric. Mrs. Cleather was one of the
first pupils of Madame Blavatsky, and
the appreciation of her work in the
theosophical ranks is shown by the
hearty welcome she has received from
all disciples of the faith in this city.
Basil Crump is a barrister, a mem
ber of the Inner Temple and of the
Middle Temple, and was for some time
the sub-editor of the Law Times, the
leading English legal Journal. He is
secretary to the president of the Theo
sophioal Society of England, and vice
president of the Universal Brother
hood, the name by which the Theo
sophical Society of the United States is
now known.
Editor Piskulich Explains.

Sloga, desiring to correct certain state
ments made by Christopher Radulovlch
In an article recently published in The
Call, says Radulovlch came into his office
accompanied by two friends and learning
that they stood Jn the presence of the
editor of the Hovatska Sloga the irate
Radulovlch attempted to make an assault
upon him, but was not successful. The
only damage done was the breaking of
two large plates of glass in a partition.
Editor Piskulich admits that the best
of feeling does not exist between Radii
lovich and himself; a feeling engendered
by the publication of certain strictures
placing in doubt the veracity of Radu
lovlch in connection with certain state
ments made concerning the ' death of
Samuel Maitenovich. who was found dead
in his room in the New European Hotel
Editor Piskulich claims he was justified
in publishing the statement to which
Radulovich has taken umbrage and that
he Is at any time ready to defend his po
sition.

MOURNS THE LOSS OF A DIAMOND,
The Unbleached American Vainly Seeks to Regain
His Vanished Sparkler,
ERNEST HOGAN IS SAD.
Ernest Hogan, the unbleached Amer
ican and the bright particular star of
Black Patti's Troubadours, feels the
loss of his $1200 diamond keenly. Since
he has been separated from the expen
sive sparkler which ornamented his ex
pansive shirt front and has been de
prived of its beneficent influence he has
lost the happy disposition which char
acterized him at all times, whether on
or off the stage, and to-day he wanders
about with a genuine sorrow tugging
at his heart strings. However, Mr. Ho
gan's natural humor will crop out even
at critical moments such as this, and in
relating the occurrence to a Call rep
resentative he could not help joking
about the matter. and, although he was
sad at first, he soon Indulged in some
of those hearty expressions of laughter
which have helped to make him fa
mous.
He Said: "No one can realize the
sorrow I feel at losing that diamond,
not because of Its Intrinsic value, but It
belonged to one of the best friends I
ever had, William J. Scanlan, the sweet
singer who died a few days ago." At
the recollection Mr. Hogan brushed
away a drop of moisture from his
dusky cheek that had every suspicion
of a tear.
When the remark was ventured that
there was a rumor that he had fol
lowed the example of star actresse3
â who advertised themselves by repre
senting that they had been robbed of
their diamonds, Mr. Hogan bristled up
in darkened wrath and said: "That's
a prevarication and I am willing to pay
$100 for the return of that diamond, ask
no questions and worship the man who
has the goodness to bring It back." I'd
like to ask the man who took it 'What

The Principal Shooting Clubs in
Their Usual Tussl* With the
Targets.
The Shell Mound ranges presented a
very animated scene yesterday after
noon, the principal shooting clubs be
ing represented for their regular fort
nightly contests In marksmanship.
The elements were decidedly adverse
to the Interests of the marksmen, the
light being very "shifty" most of the
day and a miserable "fish-tail" wind,
the despair of a shooter bent upon ac
â¢ curate aim, prevailing, this combina
tion making accurate shooting almost
an Impossibility. There were, how
ever, Intermissions of steady light and
low wind, which may account for the
| fact that some really good shooting
I was done during the day â notably on
the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club's
rifle range, where one of the members,
F. O. Young, distinguished himself
with the Winchester single-shot rifle,
making 37 in ten shots on the Columbia
target, as follows: 1, 3, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3,
5. This means that the average ring
for the shots was 3.7 Inches, which
stands as the record of this club, and It
is believed that It Is the best score
made in America since the adoption of
! the Columbia target, which has been In
use nearly three years.
Company M, First Regiment, Infan
try, held Its regular monthly medal
shoot, making the following score:
Captain O'Neil, 24; St-rgeants Cobby, 36;

Following are the winners In the
am yer gwine to tell Massa Peter at de
gate? "What about that diamond you
took from poor Ernest Hogan, eh?' All
I ask is that he bring me back my dia
mond and I'll be the happiest man alive
and when I do get it back I'll have it
riveted on a screw that will go clean
through my chest and button it on my
back."
There la no doubt that this particu
lar sample of crystallized carbon was
the real thing, for it weighed a fraction
less than 7 carats. It was the "warm
est baby in the bunch," and was a
source of great comfort to the versatile
writer of "coon" songs. In fact, since
losing it he has developed a severe
cough which is liable to turn Into pneu
monia, and the heat which the dia
mond disseminated was so great that
he did not need to wear an overcoat.
And that diamond was invaluable in
cases where a quick breakfast was de
sired, for all that was necessary was to
place the frying-pan over it and in the
twinkling of an eye the steak was
cooked to a turn. And when Ernest
was doing his turn the lights of the
theater would pale into insignificance
when the sparkler emitted its kalel
scopic rays.
Mr. Hogan has entirely eliminated
the song, "I Don't Care if You Never
Come Back," from his repertoire, far he
does not wish to be misunderstood in
this matter, and he is considering the
advisability of writing another song
dedicated to the lost diamond, the title
of which will be, "I'd Be Mighty Glad
if You Did Come Back." He is now
singing his latest ditty, "Come Back
and I'll Be Good" with much feeling,
and has changed the chorus to fit the
exigencies of the situation so as. to
read:
Come back, my diamond. I'll be good-
I'd be a happy coon, babe, if you would
\\ ny did you leave me, how could you be
so rude?
Come back and I'll be good.

A BRUTAL SON-IN-LAW.
George Patterson, a Plumber, Arrest
ed on Charges of Battery and
Mayhem.
George Patterson, a plumber, living at
609% Minna street, went home at an early
hour yesterday morning In an intoxicated
condition. He was In a quarrelsome mood
and soon began to beat his wife. Her
father, James Cosgrove. who was stop
ping In the house, interfered to protect
his daughter, when Patterson knocked
him down and beat him in a horrible
manner, finishing up by biting off part of
his left ear.
Mrs. Patterson's screams attracted the
attention of Policemen Hurley and Mc-
Grayan and thÂ«y ran to the house and
placed Patterson under arrest. Patterson
was taken to the City Prison and a
charge of battery was booked against
him. Cosgrove was sent to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Tormey stitched and
dressed five wounds on his face and scalp
and also his wounded ear. The doctor
thought Patterson must have used brass
knuckles or some other instrument, as It
would have been impossible to have made
the wounds with the hands. When the
police saw that Cosgrove's ear was partly
bitten off they preferred a further charge
of mayhem against Patterson.
The old man is a dairyman and after
his wounds were attended to he said that
he would not prosecute his son-in-law,
because he did not believe he knew what
he was doing.

-
Hides in a Gas Tank House to I
Escape From Men in
Pursuit.
Overcome by the Deadly Fximes, He
Dies Soon After He Is Dis
covered.
Special Dispatch to "The Call.
'. PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 27.â Ed Evans, a
burglar, hid in a gas tank-house early
this morning: to conceal himself from
pursuers, .and met swift retribution. Es
caping gas overcame him as he lay there
and he was taken out at daylight to die.
Evans had been released from the
County Jail only yesterday. He had spent
the night looting the residence of J.
Pollvka. a few blocks from the place
where he met his death. Arousing the
family as he left the house he ran up
the street followed by Polivka and several
neighbors, who had been aroused by Po
llvka's police whistle. The pursuers were
hard on Evans' heels when he suddenly
vanished in the darkness near the grounds
of C. E. Smith, and all further efforts to
find him proved in vain.
This morning the gardener, smelling a
leak in the tank, which is part of a small
illuminating plant, opened the door of the
house which shelters it and found a man
lying on the floor, his face blue and swol
len. The victim died a few minutes after
he was taken out. Papers found on his
body settles his identity beyond doubt.

LOS ANGELES. Feb. 27.â T0-morrow
Is going to be a great day in the City
Council. The special committee, com
prising Messrs. Grider, Hutchlnson and
Matthus, will make a most interesting
and comprehensive report. It has de
voted several weeks to the investiga
tion of available sources of mountain
water supply and has spent days in the
wild and rugged mountains north of
this city trying to find the sources of
mountain water. From the committee
it is learned that it found plenty of
water as clear as crystal and as pure
as purity itself, and all of it is still
unappropriated; consequently it is
available for the use of the city.
The most convenient mountain water
is that of the Big Tejunga Canyon,
where 1500 or 2000 inches of crystal
water rolls to waste down the rocky
gorges, while a hundred thousand peo
ple are athirst for such a liquid. The
greater part of the watershed of the
Big Tejunga is above the elevation cf
3000 feet, and the whole territory is a
Government forest reservation. The
Big Tejunga watershed is but twenty
or thirty miles from the city, and the
rain fall in that high altitude is usually
two or three times as great as it is in
the city and on the plains near Che city.
Among the other sources of mountain
'tvafcer supply is that of Piru and Ala
mos creeks in Ventura County, about
fifty or sixty miles from the city. Those
creeks have an enormous supply of
pure mountain water that is unappro
priated, and their remoteness seems to
be the only serious obstacle to using
them as the source of supply for Los
Angeles. However, competent engi
neers consider that such a distance is
not by any means an insurmountable
obstacle.
The Arrow Head Reservoir Company
Is willing to sell its vast property at a
reasonable price. Its supply of good
water is practically unlimited. The
Hemet Land Company is another hold
er of a large quantity of pure mountain
water. The Hemet dam is already con
structed and ie one of the finest in the
world, while Lake Hemet is a vast body
of water covering a thousand acres and
filled with crystaline mountain water.
The dam. reservoir site and other prop
erty of the company can be bought at a
reasonable price.
Besides these there are many smaller
supplies of good water that are availa
ble for the use of the city. The water
of San Gabriel Canyon is too nearly
appropriated to render its use by the
city even a remote possibility. Enough
Is already known to prove that the city
can get plenty of pure mountain water
whenever its officials are willing to ac
. quire It.
The great question will arise as to
â¢what action the Council will take upon
the report of the committee and the
recommendations which it will contain.
It is to be supposed that the committee
will recommend some course of action.
It will probably be in the nature of an
instruction to the City Engineer and
City Attorney to investigate certain
Bources of supply, ascertain what the
title to them is, and whether the waters
â . are pure and can from an engineering
standpoint be used by the city. If the
Council decides to take this step, which
is in the nature of further investiga
tion, then will a move have been made
to make good the pledges all the politi
cal parties made to the people of this
city at the last election, when they
promised to give them pure mountain
â¢water for domestic purposes. If the
report is simply sidetracked it will
Bhow that the water company and its
syndicated dailies command the City
Council.
DEFRAUDS A SAN
JOSE MERCHANT
Swindler Schwartz Wanted by
the Police of the Garden
City.
Obtained a Loan of $2000, Giving a
Collection of Bogus Diamonds
Â©s Security.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 27.â Joseph H.
Schwartz, the Diamond King, who was
arrested at Seattle, Wash., yesterday
for stealing $1250 worth of diamonds
from Wolfsohn & Livingston of San
Francisco, is wanted by the police here.
Several weeks ago Schwartz came to
San Jose. He struck up an acquain
tance with A. H. Loewenstein and
other sports. He spent money lavishly
for a few days, then stated that he
would like to borrow $2000. Schwartz
exhibited $12,000 worth of diamonds
that he was willing to give as security.
Loewensteta introduced Schwartz to
Charles Stern, a pawnbroker at 69
West Santa Clara street, and negotia
tions were at once entered into to pro
cure the loan. Stern examined the
etones and pronounced them genuine.
A local capitalist, whose name Stern
refuses to divulge, advanced $2000 on
the diamonds, and took the stones as
security. Schwartz at once left town.
A few days later the capitalist
thought that maybe all was not right
and had the stones examined again.
Stern then found that the jewels were
paste and that they had been substi
tuted for good ones.

various nominees of the New Charter
Club that the organization has made
its ticket public at this early stage of
the campaign. The club argues that if
any of its candidates cannot withstand
the scrutiny and criticism of a period
of six weeks he would not be worthy of
election. .
It is for the purpose of telling the vot
ers of San Jose Â»mething about the
men whom they will be called upon to
vote for on Aprill 11 that the following
brief sketches of some of the more im
portant candidates of the New Charter
Club are given:
S. E. SMITH, the candidate for
Mayor, has been engaged in business
in the city of San Jose for more than
ten years. In all that tfme he has
steadily gained friends and has grown
in favor with the general public. He
has never held any public office, and
never before sought any honor at the
hands of his fellow citizens. He has
been a prominent figure In the move'
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898;
ment for better government, which re
sulted in the formation of the New
Charter Club, in the adoption of the
new charter for San Jose and in the
present movement to overthrow gang
rule in this fair city. He was a mem
ber of the Board of Freeholders which
framed the new charter. He is a suc
cessful business man, and promises to
apply to the affairs of the public the
same energy, ability and honesty that
have characterized his private dealings.
J. F. COLOMBET, the aspirant for
the office of City Treasurer, formerly
held this office in this city for the
period of six years. He filled it to the
satisfaction of the people at large, but
was retired to private life through the
machinations of the "gang," as he had
persistently refused to lend his aid to
its schemes for plundering the city
treasury, or to even countenance any
such attempts. He is a well-known
and prominent orchardist, owning a
large property about five miles from
town, on the Almaden road. He re
sides in this city, and is a large con
tributor to the city treasury.
J. P. JARMAN, candidate for Coun
cil-man-at-large, was formerly Coun
cilman from the Fourth Ward. He
fulfilled the duties of his office to the
satisfaction of all the decent and rep
utable citizens, and was always op
posed to the "gang." For this reason,
he is sure to be a mark for the bosses'
shafts of abuse and vilification. He
never flinched when the "gang" or any
of its jobs were to be exposed, and
proved himself an enemy to be
feared. He has been in business here
for about ten years or more, and has
always been identified with the most
progressive public movements. He is
a man of undoubted courage and high
principle.
W. E. CROSSMAN, the nominee for
Councilman for the First Ward, is a
well-known real estate man, who is
recognized as one of the strongest op
ponents to gang methods. He was a
candidate on the Citizens' ticket for
Councilman some years ago, but was
defeated by the efforts of the "gang."
He is enterprising and progressive in
his ideas, and is qualified to make a
first-class city father.
ADAM RTEHL. the candidate for a
peat in the Council from the Second
Ward, is a retired merchant. He was
a member of the State Legislature,
and as snich made an enviable record
for honesty and integrity. Some years
ago, while a resident of Gilroy, he was
elected Mayor of that thriving town,
and there also he made a clean anc.
excellent record in every respect. He
has been a resident of San Jose for at
least a decade.
MAURICE O'BRIEN, the candidate
for Councilman from the Third WarO,
is a pioneer of the city and a promi
nent business man. He is also a largp
property-holder Â»and taxpayer. He is
'.veil known as a man of sterling
honesty and integrity, and has been
frequently mentioned for office, but
has heretofore always declined to run.
He now thinks it a duty to himself
and to his fellow-citizens to run a& a
candidate on the ticket of the New
Charter Club. He was a member of
the Board of Freeholders which framed
the new charter.
EDMOND COOPERS, the candidate
for Councilman from the Fourth Ward,
is a retired merchant and capitalist.
He has large property interests here,
and his only motive in running is to
issist in freeing the city from the con
trol of the corrupt "gang" that has so
ong been a vampire on the body politic
it San Jose.

Special DlÃpatch to The CalL
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 27.
Beyond the fact that the Corbett case
will be decided on Monday and that
after its decision the bill regulating the
right of way for railroads in Alaska
and for other purposes will probably be
taken up the programme in the Senate
for this week Is quite indefinite.
The Alaska bill is of much wider
scope than its title indicates, and it
will not be voted upon without con
siderable discussion. There is no gen
eral disposition to defeat the bill, but
some Senators are of the opinion that
it should be amended in several par
ticulars, and they will seekÂ° to secure
these changes before the vote is taken.
It is believed the bill will pass after a
day or two's talk upon it.
It is probable that after the Alaskan
bill is disposed of some of the bills of
less general importance on the calen
dar will be considered. One of these
is the bill for the payment of the claim
of the book agents of the Southern
Methodist Church for property destroy
ed at Nashville during the Civil War.
This bill appropriates $258,000 and has
aroused some opposition. It is also un
derstood to be Senator Davis" intention
to again move the consideration of the
Hawaiian treaty If opportunity offers,
but there is no disposition at present
to unduly press the treaty In antago
nism to other measures.
It is possible the bill making appro
priations for the District of Columbia
will be reported by the Committee on
Appropriations during the week. There
are only five of the appropriation bills
to be considered by the Senate, which
is a record far in advance of that usual
ly made at this date in long sessions of
Congress. This fact is causing Sena
tors to begin to talk about final ad
journment at a far earlier date than
usual.
Three of the bills which are as yet
unconsidered are the District of Co
lumbia, the naval and the sundry civil
bills. These are all important meas
ures and each is liable to arouse de
bate, but Senators generally agree that
unless there is some "other reason for
postponing adjournment it can be
reached by May or June. The friends
of the Hawaiian treaty say, however,
that some of the appropriation bills
will be held back until the question of
annexation is decided upon, and this
determination is one of the circum
stances which may cause the post
ponement of adjournment.
The House leaders have been strain-
Ing all their energies to expedite the
appropriation bills, with a view to an
early adjournment, and they are suc
ceeding beyond their most sanguine
expectations. Not in a quarter of a
century have the appropriation bills
been so far advanced in the long ses
sion as they are at this time. Only
three of the thirteen regular bills re
main in committee. The other ten have
gone through one or more executive
stages and oneâ the military academy
billâ is in the hands of the President
awaiting his signature. The condition
of the other nine bills is as follows:
The pension bill has passed both
houses, and the differences have been
agreed upon in conference; the legisla
tive, executive and judicial, the army,
the fortifications and the agricultural
bills have passed both houses, and the
differences are being adjusted in con
ference; the Senate amendments to the
diplomatic and consular bill have been
agreed upon by the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs, and the bill only
awaits confirmation of this action by
the House before going to the Presi
dent; the Indian bill has passed the
Senate and the amendments placed on
the bill there are being considered by
the House committee; the District of
Columbia bill which has passed the
House, is still in the Senate committee,
and the sundry civil bill will probably
pass the House to-morrow.
Of the three bills still unreported to
the House, both the naval and post
office await contingent developments
before they can be completed. The
naval bill is practically completed, save
for the provisions for dry-docks and
new ships. On both these propositions
the development of the next few days
are expected to control the action of
the committee. If the board of inquiry
into the Maine disaster should render
a finding which portends strained re
lations with Spain, the most liberal
provisions will be made both for dry
docks and ships. If the disaster was
not due to accidental causes aboard
ship, it is almost certain that two new
battleships will be provided for â one
recommended by the Secretary of the
Navy, and one to replace the Maineâ
and that at least one of the new dry-
docks recommended will be authorized.
In case the Maine disaster is found to
have been caused by accident, it is
probable no provision for battleships
will be made in the new bill.
The completion of the postofnee bill
depends upon the action of the House
upon the Loud bill, relating to second
class mail matter, which is to be acted
upon this week. The general deficiency
is always the last of the bills to be re
ported, as it includes such deficiencies
and other items as must be provided
for at the close of every session.
With the appropriation bill and the
immigration bill â the consideration of
which has been set foT March* 15 â out
of the way nothing remains to prolong
this session of Congress save the ques
tions of annexation of Hawaii or of
war. The leaders of both sides, lock
ing ahead, eliminating both these sub
jects as to probabilities or possibilities
of delay, agree that the appropriation
bills should be passed and that Con
gress should be ready to adjourn early
in May. If such a contingency as war
should arise, it would be necessary for
Congress to act both in the formal dec
laration of war and in furnishing ivays
and means for its prosecution.
With regard to Hawaiian annexation
there is no doubt that if the present
treaty is abandoned in the Senate no
move for annexation by legislative en
actment will be initiated by the House.
The sentiment both among the friends
and opponents of annexation in the
House seems to be that after the long
contest at the other end of the capitol
the Senate should retain jurisdiction of
the subject. Action by the Senate on
a resolution of annexation would there
fore precede any action by the House,
and it is this which gives color to the
general impression in the House that
action upon a resolution in the Senate
can be delayed until Doth houses have
completed their other work and that
then an effort will be made to adjourn
and leave the question suspended.
Speaker Reed makes no concealment
of his personal opposition to annexa
tion, and says that other very promi
nent Republicans, members like Can
non of Illinois, Walker of Massachu
setts and Johnson of Indiana are out
spoken. Some of the others, like Chair
man Dingley of the Ways and Means
Committee, have made no public dec
larations upon the subject, but are be
lieved to be in sympathy with the oppo
nents of annexation. A large majority
of the Republicans, however, are of
course, in favor of the administration's
policy, many of them enthusiastically
so.

WILLIAM
M. SINGERLY
FILLS DEAD
Heart Disease Takes
the Journalist and
Banker.
Seized With a Coughing
Fit While Smoking
a Cigar.
Indisposed From a Cold, but
His Condition Caused No
Apprehension.
SKETCH OF A BUSY LIFE.
Founder of the Philadelphia Record,
Bank President and Demo
cratic Leader.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 27.â William
M. Singerly died suddenly at his resi
dence, 1701 Liocust street, this after
noon. Heart disease was the immedi
ate cause of death. Mr. Singerly had
been suffering for about ten days from
a cold, and had remained at home
since last Wednesday, although his in
disposition was in no way serious.
While sitting in his bedroom smoking
a cigar he was seized with a violent fit
of coughing and immediately after
ward fell over dead. In the room at
the time were Mr. Singerly's grand
daughter, Miss Mabel Singerly Mere
dith, and two servants. His son-in
law, James S. McCartney, had left a
few moments before the sudden end
came, leaving Mr. Singerly in appa
rently good health, apart from his
slight cold.
The physicians say they had fre
quently cautioned Mr. Singerly that
his heart was weak as a result of ex
cessive smoking, and of late his cus
tom was to take a "dry smoke." To
day, however, his cigar was lighted,
and it is thought that the smoke
brought on the coughing spell, the se
verity of which ruptured a " vessel of
the heart.
Mr. Singerly leaves a daughter, Mrs.
E. Singerly Balch, who is at present
touring Europe.
William Singerly was proprietor of
the Record Publishing Company, presi
dent of the Chestnut-street National
Bank and the Chestnut-street Savings
Fund and Trust Company, which re
cently collapsed, and president of the
Singerly Pulp and Paper Mill. He was
a member of the Fairmount Park Com
mission, and until lately the treasurer
and trustee of the Philadelphia Com
mercial Museum. He was born in this
city on December 27, 1832, and with the
exception of a brief period in his early
manhood, when he conducted a com
mission business in Chicago, has lived
here ever since. His father, Joseph
Singerly, was one of the originators of
the street railway system of Philadel
phia, and William returned here to as
sume the management of the German
town Passenger Railway Company. In
1877 he bought the Record, then a com
paratively feeble journal, and brought
it to its present standard of excel
lence. . _,
In ISB7, upon the retirement of Gov
ernor Pattison from office, Mr. Singer
ly took an active part in establishing
the Chestnut-street National Bank, of
which the ex-Governor became the first
president.
Upon Mr. Pattison being called
for a second time to the Governorship
of Pennsylvania Mr. Singerly succeed
ed him as president of the bank and
also became president of the Chestnut
street Trust and Savings Fund Com-
pany.
In seeking relaxation from the cares
of business Mr. Singerly had for many
years taken a keen interest in farming
and stock raising. His herds of Hol
stein cattle at his large farm at Gwy
nedd, in Montgomery County, were fa
mous for years, and he was also owner
of the Elkton stock farm.
Mr. Singerly was also an active Dem
ocrat. In 1894 he was unanimously
made the Democratic candidate for
Governor of Pennsylvania, and entered
with great energy into the canvass,
speaking in nearly every county in the
State. In all he made over seventy
speeches in upholding the cause of
Democracy. The natural Republican
majority of Pennsylvania was too great
to be overcome, however, and his com
petitor. General Hastings, carried off
the prize. During the last national
campaign he supported the Palmer and
Buckner ticket, making a number of
speeches in its behalf in Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Maryland and organlz
â¢ne a local association in the move
ment. He also took an active part in
forming the Pennsylvania Bankers As
sociation. Â
Financial misfortune overtook Mr.
Singerly durfns the last few months of
his life, when, on December 23 last,
the Chestnut-street National Bank ana
the Trust Company were compelled to
"close their doors. Messrs. Earle and
Cooke were made trustees of the com
pany. Mr. Singerly promptly turnert
over to them every personal asset that
he possessed, including his interest in
the Record. Since then a receiver haa
been appointed for that bank, and the
affairs of it and the Trust Company
are in process of settlement.

GUARD NOTES
How the First Regiment
Infantry May Be Called
Together,
The New Major - General Is
Looking Around to Learn
What Is Needed.
An Army Officer Who Tells of the
Necessity of Imparting Mili
tary Knowledge.
There is, at this time, in view of pos-
Blble war -with Spain, a great deal of war
talk In the armories of the First Regi
ment in this city, in the armory of the
Signal Corps and in that of the cavalry,
Troop A. The tnlk extends throughout
the Second Brigade, within the territorial
limits of which are Alameda, Contra
Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Men
docino, Marin, Napa, Santa Cruz, So
noma, Santa Clara and San Mateo coun
ties and San Francisco. The majority of
the enlisted men, as well as the officers,
p.re ready .it a moment's notice to don
their uniforms and go to the front. There
are in addition to the regularly organized
guard in the Second Brigade limitsâ
namely. First Regiment of Infantry, 872;
Fifth Regiment of Infantry, SSO; Signal
Corps, 45, and Troop A, Cavalry, 45* menâ
al.out 280,000 men liable to military duty,
.and out â¢>? this number there could be se
cured in a few days more 'men than
would be rt-quired to bring the two regi
ments up to the maximum, and there
would be material to form a number of
-egiments.
In the guard located In this city each
company has what Is known as a "squad
in which is the name of each
â â r. his home address and business
addrefis, so that in case of an emergency
the .individual may he found without
In each of the local organizations
yst^m by which a certain num
: names are placed on a book which
is in charge of a non-commissioned offi
cer whose duty it is on an emergency call
to start out at once and notify every man
whose name is on his list to report at the
armory at once. ' By the system each man
is called upon at his place of Business and j
: at his.. home, and that system is so com
plete that within two hours every man :
in the -First Regiment will be with his |
company at the armory ready to march. j
In addition arrangements have been made j
by which the commissary can within the i
same time have all that is needed to pro- i
vide the men with food and shelter, and i
by the system there will not be a repe
tition of the difficulty that presented It
â  self; at Sacramento , when the regiment
was. sent to that place during the rail- j
road, strike.
The. new major-general, John H. Dick- i
inson,' ls at this time looking around in
. order to â  satisfactorily . answer the ques
... tion â he has" asked- himself â "Where am I
at?" Just as soon as he makes the dis- j
coveryâand he expects to make that in
..a few daysâ he will put into force a great :
'.. deal of that energy, that was characteristic '
' of him during the time he was brigadier- :
â  general. During the week he will issue
orders for the inspection of the various
companies of the guard. The inspections
will commence with the companies of the
Second Brigade; those of the First :
and after that those of the Third. These i
. inspections will be finished before tha ,
close of April, and by that time the :
division commander will have before him
the condition of the entire guard, so that :
...he will be in a position to know what ;
â  changes should be made, If any are re- '
qti/red. Ha, will visit the various orgau- .
. izatiiihs and ! discover by personal â  ob-' i â¢
.. servation what is needed to place the
guard of this State at the standard that !
it should be in order to be effective In
. ; case of need.'
During the week orders for inspection
will be; issued from the headquarters of i
; t.'j Second Brigade, in conformance with \
r^^rs to be issued from division head- i
. quarters. .'Orders will also- be issued for |
seven elections to be held in the First i
. and the Fifth regiments of Infantry.
â  . Last Saturday night Major-Genera i
'Dickinson, 'for the -first time since his
appointment, officially met the members
of the staff, who were appointed -by ;
"Major-General Janies. and who, having, :
in accordance, with custom when there is ;
a change of major-general, offered their ,
resignations, 'been notified that there will !
. not be any changes of the- staff until
further orders. He was formally intro
duced, and during the evening he. on be- i
half of the staff, presented to his prede
cessor In office, who .was present by mvi- j
tation," a fine silver tea service as a token
of the esteem in which he was held by ,
â¢those who were on his staff.
Captain D. A. Smith, adjutant of the
Fifth Regiment of Infantry, has been
confined to his home for several days
by an attack of la grippe. . ..
The following extract from an essay on
"The -Military Department In Our Schools !
and Colleges," by Captain J. Regan of 1
the Ninth United States. Infantry, is at
this particular time of great value and j .
Importance, and its lessons are well worth I
heeding: 1 â  .-'..";^ 'â¢*
The idea, which dates back to the ancients,
of teaching the boys and young men In schools
and colleges the rudimentary art of war. Is a
st excellent one and deserves every en
.ragfment. '"Nothing.' 1 says the inspector
.-., "can be more imjx>rtant than the ln
n of freemen in the wisest way to de
relr country," and in its enforcement
- principle "in time of peace prepare for
â¢â â nr." finds its most Intelligent application.
Ita purpose Is patriotic, as the law providing
'.â¢jt military Instruction in our colleges had Its
irtgtn in 1566. based upon our experience In the
Civil %Yar, which clearly demonstrated the
kvnt imixjrtance of giving to the young- men
of th-i 'jountry such a knowledge of military
â  ties as will enable them to take Â«tn active
Orient part In the future wars of the
â  try.
For the spread of military knowledge
ighout the land much is due to the vet
of the Civil War. The national flag.
eb their efforts, Is now seen and yen
! by the school children In every ham-
U>t and villas. Th<*v have taken to heart the
JÂ«or<Js of General Sherman: "I cannot help
{â¢lead to my/countrymen, at every opportunity.
):-Hsh all that is manly .md noble In the
military profession, because peace is ener
â¢ * and do man is wise enough to foretell
when soldiers may bo In demand again."
The policy of thus Imparting military te
flon, theoretically and practically, has al
ready produced marked results In preparing
< men to take important positions in the
ituU Guard and in giving to them a
-i military bearing, i. c., head erect,
â w-th the natural swing of the arms and legs.
How disappointing it is to see young men. jet
In their teens, hollow-chested and round
;-red. These defects are now closely nb
: in the schools and corrected on the
â¢ one of our inspectors recently reporting
â¢â at h<? found the cadets â¢straight, square-
Fhouldereci, receptive and alert."

The military department, so far, is giving
entire satisfaction to teachers and the faculty, '
who, be It said to their credit, are giving |
it loyal support. It would Indeed be strange
It they were not alive to Its merits and ad
vantages.
It is needless to remark that the Government
is no loser by the efforts it put? forth toward
sustaining these Institutions. Had this eye
tern been in vogue before the Civil War we
would have had a splendid nucleus upon
which to form armies. The material In tens
of thousands of trained and Intelligent raan
nooons now at hand and Increasing every
year, to spring to arms at the first call of the
President. In t-.iÃ connection the following
from the report of the inspector-genera! is
pertinent: "One of the oldest colleges, whose
military department was established as early
as ISI9. is said to have- furnished from Its
j alumni for the Civil War 13 general officers,
| 25 colonels, 40 field officers and 198 company
j officers, or a total of 275 commissioned offl-
I cers." What stronger argument do we desira
than this piece of history, burled In the pub
lic arch levee, presents?
If a few of the surplus officers of the
T'nited States army were detailed to at
tend the drills of the companies of the
; National Guard they would find as good
material to work upon as they find in thÂ«
schools and colleges, and as the great
majority of the men who belong to the
guard are anxious and willing to become
soldiers the instruction that such officer*
could impart would do much to make the
National Guard a much more effective
organization than It is now and the Gov
ernment would in time of need have much
more efficient men than it can obtain now,
but probably not more willing. What the
National Guard" needs is instruction the
same that 1b imparted In the regular army
so that if called upon the National
Guardsman may know exactly what thÂ«
regular does.
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
It 1b probable that this week the men
of the two divisions of the naval militia
located at this port will be given their
respective positions on the Marion and
be instructed in the particular duties re
quired of each man.
There will soon be an election to nil
the office of junior lieutenant at San
Diego, vice Shaw, who was promoted
lieutenant and navigating officer; for
lieutenant of the division at Sa:.ta Cms;
vice Lieutenant Morey, resigned, and it Is
believed .that Carl j3. Lindsey, who is in
line of promotion, will be chosen. There
will also be an election, for ensign and
passed assistant engineer In the engineer
corps.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898.
CAUGHT IN A
SOUTHEASTER
Overdue Steamers Santa
Cruz and Walla Walla
Arrive.
Encountered Heavy Weather
From Flattery to the
Golden Gate.
Visitors Were Not Allowed Abot
the Mohican Yesterday Owing
to the Storm.
A storm-tossed fleet of vesselÃ
reached port yesterday, and the pas
sengers and crew were not sorry to
reach a safe anchorage The steamers
Santa Cruz and Walla Walla were
overdue, and their captains state that
It was blowing as hard when they
reached the Golden Gate as it was
when they passed out of the straits of
San Juan de Fuca. The bark Alden
Besse arrived off the Farallones on
the 23d Inst., but the southeaster was
too much for her, and Captain Potter
had to put to sea again. She was
twenty-one days coming from Hono
lulu, and it was a fair-weather voyage
until this coast was reached.
The bark Oregon from Newcastle,
N. S. W.. was reported from the heads
last Friday as being "fourteen miles
southwest." She was then out eighty
six days, and Captain Parker was con
gratulating himself on the termina-
Uun of his long voyage, and refused a
tow from Captain Randall of the tug
Fearless, when the gale came along
and he had to stand out to sea again.
Yesterday it was blowing forty miles
an hour at the heads, so her chances
fur getting in to-day are not very
The Santa Cruz struck the gale al
most as soon as she got away from Se
attle, on the 20th inst., at 9:30 a. m.
With a fair amount of luck she should
have been here Thursday last, but in
stead of that she was bucking into a
heavy sea off the coast of Mendocino.
At times no headway could be made
at all. and had it not been for the sails
Captain Gielow says he would not be
here yet. AVith steam and sail the
Santa Cruz managed to beat her way
down. So many tacks were made dur
ing the seven days the vessel was at
6ea that toward the end the sailors
thought they were on board a "wind
jammer" again. Off the Columbia
River it blew a hurricane, and the ves
sel had to be hove to. But, all's well
that ends well, and last night captain
and crew took a well-earned rest in
The Santa Cruz has been carrying
freight to Dyea and Skaguay, and no
one aboard the vessel has any desire
to go back to that part of the country
again. The wharf runs out for miles
over a mud flat, and even then the
Santa Cruz could only get half her
length alongside of it. The tide rises
and fallÃ from twenty to twenty-nine
feet, and the wind blows bo hard at
times that the men had to hold on to
ropes In order to keep from being
blown overboard. The officers on the
steamer predict that the route be
tween Seattle and Jtfneau, Dyea and
Skaguay will be strewn with wrecks of
many a good steamer before the winter
The steamer Walla Walla got in yes
terday from Puget Sound ports. She
also caught the southeaster, and was
nearly thirty hours late an the run.
Captain Wallace rejoined his vessel
this trip after a vacation spent in the
East. He was congratulating himself
prior to the sailing of the Walla Walla
from this port on the fact that the
worst of the winter was over. He had
barely reached Point Reyes when a
northwester came and the steamer
caught it all the way to Victoria. B.
C. On his way back he ran into the
souhteaster and had to endure another
siege of it. "We caught the first of it
off. Cape Flattery," said Captain Wal
lace yesterday, "and the gale stayed
with us right into port. Every night I
thought that by morning we would
have run out of it, but no it stayed
by us and was blowing as hard at Point
Bonita as it was off Flattery."
The oil steamer George Loomis was
to have sailed for Ventura yesterday.
Captain Bridgett took his vessel out as
far as the bar and not liking the looks
of the weather came back to port.
The big four-masted British ship
Speke is disgusted with the turn af
fairs have taken and refuses to leave
her bed of mud in Oakland Creek. The
vessel arrived here on. November 18 last
and at that time freights were high and
charters plentiful. Captain Wain
wright, for his owners, refused an offer
of 35 shillings holding that the price
would go to 40 shillings before the
season was over. Instead of going up
rates went down and finally the own
ers of the vessel were glad to accept 25
shillings. This sudden drop disgusted
the Speke and when the tugs Sea Queen
and Redmond went over to pull her out
of the mud and take her to Wheatport
to load she could not be budged. An
other attempt will be made to haul her
out when the high tides come.
It was too rough on the bay for vis
itors to get out to the sloop-of-war Mo
hican yesterday. In fact, visitors were
not wanted aboard, as out of the 127 ap
prentices on the warship there was not
a score but what was seasick. The boys
have not got their sea legs yet and as
the Mohican has considerable top ham
per she rolls a great deal more than
the lads like. The messroom was de
serted, but every quiet corner on the ves
sel was occupied. Many a boy on that
warship came to the conclusion yester
day that "a life on the ocean wave"
is not what it is cracked up to be.
The ferry steamers Sausalito and Ti
buron caught the full strength of the
gale as it swept in through the gate.
Both boats faced the wind as much as
possible, and when off Meiggs wharf
were put about and run before it along
the wharves to their landing slip. Nei
ther one of the steamers made a run
yesterday but what a dozen or more of
the passengers were seasick.
VIEWS OF JESUS.
Sermon by Rev. Edwin Hart Jenks
at Howard-Street Church.
Rev. Edwin Hart Jenks, co-pastor of
the First I'rpsbyterian Church, prea^hc-d
at Hi'waid- street Methodisl EptfcuopaJ
Church at the morning service. His
theme was "Views of Jesus." He said:
"At the last Passover before his death
certain Greeks came to the disciples, ask
ing to see Jesus. They wished to meet
and converse with him, not merely to look
at him. They wanted a more Intimate
relation with Jesus, so they asked to see
h'm.
"We would like to sea Jesus. CurloKlty
is aroused to ask how he looked. Was
he tall or short, fair or dark handsome
or plain? No picture quite fills our ideal
of him. But this is not so important as
to know him better. The first thing to
ask is what has he done? We can Judgo
by the historical setting of a man's lire
whether It Is worth while to inquire fur
ther of him. We can answer this best
negatively Take Christ out of literature,
out of law, out of civilization, out of U\e
hearts of men and learn what a place he
fills. We are far enough away to see
how colossal was his figure when he
stepped into the world's life. The world
to-day is seeking to deal honestly by the
truth. No fear but what the yistorica!
Chrirt will grow In men's eyes as the age
advances.
'Next we would ask what character he
bears. The world's representative an
swers: 'I find no fault In him.' He stand*
as the Ideal of a man's life, what God
would have men to be. Manhood, stal
wart, noble, restored In the divine image
1h realized in Christ. Then he is the
manifestation of God himself. But the
higher we put him the further from our
reach he seems. We would this morning
see Jesus in a nearer light. We must then
learn what he is personally to us. Then,
and then only, shall we really see and
understand him. He died for us. The
words are trite; when they are believed
and his sacrifice is made personal it is
the greatest fact in the world, and it
makes Jesus our dearest friend."
NYHAN HAD A GOOD TIME.
T. Scott and C. F. Devine Arrested
for Attempting to Bob Him.
Thomas Nyhan, a longshoreman, living
at 423% Clementina street, left his home
Saturday night with a $20 gold piece and
the intention to have a good time. He
visited several saloons and was generous
enough to ask all hands to have a drink.
About 3 o'clock yesterday morning he
started to go home and soon discovered
that he was being followed by two men.
He stopped and asked them what was
wanted and they tried to induce him to
go to a room with them on Folsom street.
He declined and walked away. They con
tlrued to follow him, and when he
reached a dark spot on Sixth street, near
Clementina, they came quickly up to him
and one of them knocked him down.
One held him down while the other put
his hand in his victim's pocket. Nyhan
fought desperately and succeeded in get
ting to his feet. He yelled for the police
and Policeman A. Tracey heard his cries.
Tracey saw two men running toward him
and he ordered them to stop. They
obeyed and he took them Jsack to where
Nyhan was standing. Nyhan accused
them of trying to rob him and Tracey
sent them to the City Prison, where they
were booked on a charge of attempted
robbery. They gave their names as
Thomas Scott.a miner, and C. P. Devine,
a clerk.
CHINESE BOYCOTT
TO BE SUPPRESSED
Property-Owners Combine to
Undermine a Pernicious
System.
Chinatown Improvement Association
Organized to Bring About
Needed Relorms.
The existence of a pernicious boycott
which for a number of ye;irs has been
di. ected against property owners in Chi
natown by Chinese tenants has roused
the landlords to determined fiction and
has impelled them to form an organiza
tion calied the Chinatown Improvement
Association, having for its object the se
curing of needed public improvements' in
that locality and the attainment of nec
essary legislation. State and municipal,
to accomplish that end, and for the mu
tual protection and benefit of the prop
erty-holders.
The preliminary meeting was held In
the offices of Attorney Ruef at 4U2 Mont
gomery street, the temporary headquar
ters of the organization, some time ago,
and more than sixty property owners,
recognizing the necessity of the move
ment, responded to the call or were rep
resented by their agents.
Considerable enthusiasm was manifest
ed when It was stated by the_temporary
chaiunari, "Joseph Goetz, that the asso
ciation was to be Incorporated from an
esthetic and sanitary 'standpoint for the
purpose of rehabilitating Chinatown on
a proper basis and equalizing Its assessed
valuation, which is twice as much in pro
portion as that In other parts of the city,
and to relieve in some measure the bur
dens which the landlords in that section
have been obliged to bear for some years
past, It ib a noted fact that the water
i rates are considerably higher there than
! elsewhere because of the meters which
| axe used almost entirely. Again, when
ever the Board of Health deuires to make
a iecurd.it Invariably singles out China
town as a good target for its operations
and cuiioen^ns buildings which In some
canes are probably as substantial, as
many in other portions of the city â¢ - " ; â 
But especially will this association vig
orously combat the system, of boycotting
which is known to exist among Chinese
tenants influenced by the highbinders
and which works great hardships on the
owners, who are extremely desirous of
breaking it up. Mr. Goetz further said
'lt is impossible to proceed legally
against these boycotting highbinders be
muse they never disclose their identity
For example, if a tenant Is ejected or
even moves out of his own accord a
flaming red poster is stuck on the prem
ises in which It is stated that JSO or $100
must be forthcoming before a new tenant
wi 1 be allowed to occupy the premises
"Of course, if the place is a desirable
one, the new tenant, rather than have
any trouble with the highbinders will
pay the money, or the landlord will do
so In order to rent the store. One good
way to overcome the -system of blackmail
l\i h h V s , of forcible physical argunln '
which 1 found quite effective In the case
of two tenants who had moved out and
had me placed under the ban After I
had given them a thorough drubbing: I
assure you that the boycott was instantly
removed, and I nave never suffered from
it since. But many others do; and we in
tend to organize for mutual defens^
Mr , Ruef. the legal adviser of fhe as
sociation, when seen yesterdAy <f
"This is the first concerted effort of ('hi 1
natown property-owners to oppose organ
ization with organization, and they w^sh
to demonstrate that they alone control
the situation and propose to serve thesi
heathen boycotters with some of thSS
own medicine. Two-thirds of the land
lords are suffering from the boycott of
h ghbinder tongs, which have that special
object in view, and the necessity for or
ganizatlon is apparent to any one 1

The General Results in 1897
have been satisfactory, notwithstanding
conditions are not wholly favorable. The
recovery from the previous business de-
pression has not been as rapid nor as
complete as many had hoped; the uncer-
tainties of a confused currency system
still remain to keep prudent men wary;
great caution has prevailed as to extend-
ed and new undertakings; the demand
for loanable funds on our usual standard
of security has been small; the price of
desirable bonds has increased, which
means a lower Interest rate on such se-
curities; the liquidations growing out of
the depression of the last five years,
which have made It necessary to fore-
close some of our mortgages, have not
entirely ceased, and the market for real
estate has, in consequence, seen no gen-
eral revival such as may be anticipated
when all these disturbing conditions shall
have disappeared. Although there has
been a growing amendment in some of
the conditions affecting the many-sided
operations of a life-insurance company,
something of the special difficulties of re-
cent years has remained.
What Has Been Accomplished.
It is therefore gratifying that at sub-
stantially the same unequaled low rate
of expense as heretofore, we have more
than kept our volume of business good,
have maintained to the full the com-
pany's great strength, and, from the sav-
ings through economy, from the savings
on a mortality more favorable than our
calculation, and from the Interest earned
over and above the rate calculated upon,
we have earned a dividend on the same
increasing scale as that paid during the
year 1897; a dividend equaled by no other
company.
The Full Measure of Our Success.
In judging the success of a company
one should have clearly in mind what is
the precise best standard of accomplish-
ment which It can set for itself; the high-
est which the business Intrinsically per-
mits; to completely realize which is the
only true success, and. falling which, no
achievement in the way of magnitude in
operation can be other than comparative
failure. The Connecticut Mutual takes
for its single aim the one peculiar ser-
vice which life Insurance alone can ren-
der and which no other institution can
rival: The perfect protection of depend-
ent families, at the lowest possible costâ
the cheapest, simplest, most thorough
family protection. By dint of Incessant
care and economy at every point It has
succeeded and does succeed in this pur-
F'OSe as none other has done or is doing
t secures the best and highest obtainable
results from the prudent and unselfish
policy-holder's point of view; and to
make sure of and to maintain these it
steadily foregoes those things for which
others strive at such fearful cost, to wit
rapid growth and enormous size- things'
very impressive, even startling, to the
general eye. but which do not benefit the
policy-holder in the slightest, and which
can be had only at an enormous cost
which he must pay. '
Therefore the Connecticut Mutual re-
fuses to seek to attract any other con-
stituency than those who desire to give
their families and estates the highest pro-
tection at its lowest possible cost, in fur-
nishing which it stands alone. And we
deem it our duty to our present great
membership to consider their interest
first, to do the best we can for them to
make their insurance as secure and as
cheap .as possible, rather than seek to
greatly Increase their number by schemes
which would greatly Increase the cost of .
their Insurance and benefit them in no
wise. We prefer to draw to us as new
members those who desire to share In
the present low cost of Insurance to our
old members and who can appreciate that
benefit at its full value, rather than at- !
tract men by speculations in dividends |
postponed ten or twenty years, of great
apparent promises In the far future the !
promised or "estimated" benefits of which '
could, at least, be realized for but a few
by the sacrifice of the many, and which
by reason of the enormous expenses of j '
the companies floating them, have so far
been and must continue to be egregiously
disappointing. Thousands of their old
policy holders know Just what we mean.
The Interest Standard.
One of the most interesting events of
the year has been the change by a num-
ber of companies in the rate of interest
assumed in calculating their premiums
and reserves, in which respect they have
more or less closely followed the action
of the Connecticut Mutual sixteen years
ago. In 1882 we became satisfied that the
rapid Increase of wealth in this country
and the Increasing confidence of foreign
investors in our resources were certain
to so increase the supply of capital as to
cause a serious and prolonged decline in
the rate of interest on conservative In-
vestments. We were then, as all other
companies were, calculating our prem-
iums and reserves on the assumption of
earning at least 4 per cent annual in-
terest for all the time any of our policies
might remain in force, that is, for at least
seventy or eighty years. We became
satisfied that this assumption was not
entirely safe, and that 8 per cent was as
high a rate as could be safely assumed
for so long a time ahead. That rate was
accordingly then adopted by us to our
continually increasing satisfaction ever
since. At the time our action was much
criticised as unnecessarily timid Instead
of really conservative, and our rivals af-
fected to treat it as a mark of weakness
rather than a prudent provision for future
strength and safety. But that which we
then foresaw and guarded against as the
inevitable result of causes then operating
has been so fully demonstrated by time
that the way of prudence has become
clear to all, even to our then harshest
critice.
Sundry Matters.
It is our usual habit to take up the
various Items of the year's operations and
comment upon them In detail. But as the
effect of these items Is fully set forth in
our detailed financial statement herewith,
and as the experience of the year has de-
veloped nothing of unusual Interest or
significance respecting them, we venture
to use the space usually devoted to them
to call your especial attention to a matter
of profound personal interact to every
policy holder In every mutual company,
namely:
The Taxation of Life Insurance.
Among the most threatening features
of our political life to-day Is the disposi-
tion of those concerned In various enter-
prises to turn to the State for aid, and
also the disposition of legislators to grant
such aid, either to win popularity or to
INSUBANCE.
avoid unpopularity. States have no in-
come except from taxes. What they give
| to one has to be first taken from others
by taxation. They have nothing of theli
own to give. In order to indulge this free-
handed response to growing demands tax-
ation naust be increased. But increased
taxation" of the voter endangers the po-
litical aspirations of those* responsible for
the increase. So to gratify their con-
stituents who want State aid for some
project, and at the same time not to
offend their constituents who are voters,
legislators are put under a strong tempta-
tion to tax somebody who doesn't vote
for the benefit of those who do. At-
i tention is at once directed to corpora-
tions, which are only "soulless" person-
alities, whose funds are in plain sight and
easy to reach,, and against which it is
easy to excite such prejudice as to make
many people blind to all questions ol
; justice or propriety and careless of those
! who really compose these corporations, oi
where their funds come from and what
they are held for. Not a session of a
Legislature passes in any State but more
or less ,measures for taxing or increasing
the taxes on life insurance companies art
brought forward, and almost always wit I:
some degree of success.
It is high time that policy-holders should
understand clearly and precisely how this
matter affects them personally; thai
whatever their company is taxed is paid
by themselves; that the tax is really upor
them personally, and that the companj
merely collects it from them and pays
it over to the State, for a mutual com-
pany has no funds except those derived
from the premiums paid In by its policy-
holders. The premium paid in by a mem-
ber or policy-holder is calculated to ful-
fill two purposes: First, to pay the death
losses of the year, and also to provide a
reserve against the certain future greatei
losses as the membership gets older; and
second, to pay running expenses. These
things cover the normal cost of insur-
ance. Whatever is left of the premium
after providing these things through the
year is surplus and is returned to the
policy-holder as an overpayment, or Jri
ordinary, but incorrect speech, as a
"dividend." Whatever is paid for taxes
comes out of that surplus and makes the
return of surplus just so much less and
makes the cost of his insurance just so
much more. Any tax on a life insurance
company or on its premiums is a direct
tax on the individual policy-holder who
pays the premium taxed. He does not see
the tax. It is not intended that he should.
! It is intended that he shall suppose that
: It is a tax on a corporation only and not
on him. But he pays it and no one else
and It is the State's addition to the cost
of his family's protection.
A second matter for yotrr moat serious
consideration is this:
Life Insurance Ought Not to Be
Taxed at All.
Taxation ought to bear on the posses-
sion and use of property and not upon the
loss of property or upon the means by
which such losses are distributed.
The only moral and humane theory of
taxation is the collection of only such
moneys as are necessary for the proper
and legitimate expenditures of the State,
; from such sources, that is, from such per-
| sons owning such properties, as ought to
! bear those expenditures and in the pro-
! portion in which they ought to' bear
j them.
Under such a theory no one would sug-
gest a tax upon people's losses. These
I could be regarded neither as the proper
] subject matter of taxation nor as a hu-
j mane basis of the distribution of tax
! burdens.
To illustrate:
No one would suggest that because a
man's house, on which he has been pay-
ing taxes, has been burned, he should at
once pay a special tax on its value which
he has just lost. Or, that a man's family
should oe taxed on the money value of
his life to them, because he has died and
| they have lost that value.
Insurance is merely a method of dis-
tributing the property losses of those who
have lost property among those who
have not lost it. It is effected through
contributions or payments, called pre-
miums.
A's house, worth $5000, and on which
: he has paid taxes while it was in being,
i has burned. A has lost $5000. There Is
Ino restoring It. That property and its
I value are gone forever, not only to Abut
1 to the whole world. To tax A on that
loss would be an unspeakable Inhumanity.
I But A has insured against that loss,
j that is, he has agreed with other house-
I owners to share their like losses, if they
| will assume his loss if It comes. While
his house is unburnt, he by his premiums,
assumes his share of the losses of those
whose houses burn meantime. When his
house burns, they, by their premiums,
take his loss on their shoulders and make
it good to him. They lose it instead of
A, because, before that he had, through
his premiums, been losing his share of
I their houses which had burnt.
Their assumption of the loss and giving
! A the money in place of his house hasn't
; restored the house. It hasn't changed
the loss into gain, or into an even thing.
The property is gone. The loss remains.
It has merely been distributed. A is made
whole, but the contributors to that result
have taken the loss to themselves and
are just so much worse off. They
have lost A's house. They ha>o divided
up the $5000 loss among them.
To tax A additionally on the $5000 be-
cause It was returned to him would be
Inhuman. It would be to make him lose
something in spite of his own and others.'
efforts to avoid loss. It would be a loss
created and inflicted by government on
the occasion of his escaping from a
greater loss. It would be a fine on him
for not losing.
To tax the other men, who, by their
premiums, have taken A's loss upon
themselves and distributed it among
themselves, is an equal inhumanity. They
have made A's loss their own to save
him. To tax them on their loss Is an
equal outrage to taxing A upon that same
loss if it had remained on him.
It is taxing a loss, and It Is a fine, a
punishment upon men for so sharing eacli
others' losses that It becomes possible for
them to be borne, 'i^e group of men
forming a mutual insurance company can
together bear losses which would crush
and destroy the Individual. But it Is as
inhuman and tyrannous to tax the losses
of the group as to tax those of the indi-
vidual, which he would have to bear but
for the action of the group.
The only element in the transaction that
suggests taxation of these losses, either to
the individual or to the group or mutual
company, is the fact that it requires the
use of money to adjust them, and that the
money is brought into sight, in the hand
of the adjusting association or corpora-
tion, and in easy reaich of the tax-
gatherer, and so becomes a temptation to
Ignore the true nature of the fund which
is simply the collective losses of the group
or company, thereby relieving the indi-
vidual calamities of its members.
Life Insurance differs from fire insur-
ance only In the subject matter of the
loss. Instead of a man's losing his house,
or other perishable property, his family
loses the money value, the earning and
producing capacity of his life. His life.
Its money value, what it will do for them,
what It will earn, is just as much prop-
erty, and their property, their financial
dependence, as Is the house; and the loss
of that life is just as much a property loss
to them as that of his house is to him.
For example: If a man, aged 30, is
earning $1000 a year for his family, taking
his chances of life according to the Ac-
tuaries' table, and assuming money to be
worth 4 per cent, the present value of his
life in money to his family is $17,000. That
is their actual money property in his life.
That Is the money they lose If he dies.
If, when he dies, the State should openly
tax that family on that loss, on that
amount, the world would stand aghast.
Such a Government could not live, for no
one could live under it.
Life Insurance is simply the distribution
of the loss of family property in the lives
of husbands and fathers. The father,
while he lives, by his yearly premiums as-
sumes his share of the loss of those fam-
ilies whose heads have died during the
year. All the fathers who have associated
tnemselves with him do the same thing.
They, by their premiums, take each fam-
ily's loss as It occurs over upon them-
selves and divide it among themselves.
They lose the money value of the man's
life, Instead of his family. The family
is not financially crushed, for these men
have taken the burden from it. They are
not crushed, for they are many and have
divided the burden, and the losses do not
come all at once. But these men have
lost the money value of that life just as
truly as the family would have lost It if
these men had not assumed and divided
it among themselves.
To tax them as a group or company
upon the loss they have thus assumed
and suffered Is as abhorrent to justice
and humanity as It would be to leave the
loss on the family and then tax the fam-
ily on that loss.
The division of the tax among these
men does not alter Its unjust quality. It
simply reduces the tax. which any one
man has to pay on any one loss. He
doesn't have to pay the whole of the tax
any more than he has to pay the whola
of the loss. But the portion which he
does pay is a tax on a loss which he has
suffered by helping others to bear It, and
1 INSURANCE.
in proportion as he has suffered it, just
as much as if he had borne the whole loss
I and paid the whole tax on that loss.
To summarize: A tax in any form upon
a mutual insurance company is a. tax on
j its members individually, and is paid and
! must be paid only by them out of their
! premiums, so much reducing the surplus
to be returned and so much Increasing
consequently the yearly cost of their poli-
cies. It is not a tax on their property,
1 but upon their losses, and is laid upon
i the money which is" the distributive share
: of each member In those losses as It
1 passes, through the hands of the company
I to make good the original sufferer.
The remedy for this matter lies with
the policy-holders themselves. They
should make the Immorality and inhu-
manity of such taxes clear to those whom
they send to their Legislatures.

In these supreme tests of accomplish-
ment the Connecticut Mutual stands

doing, these incomparable benefits have
i not been and are not, done for a class at
I the expense of another class. They have
I been and are for all alike. We have not
persuaded men to put at hazard the pro-
, tection of their families, nor to leave
their yearly overpayments (accruing div-
; idends) with us at the like hazard of loss,
; in the hope that they may by living long?
i and holding on catch some part of what
\ lessfortunatemenand less fortunate famÂ«
j Hies may lose by forfeiture. We have no
! schemes for despoiling some of our mem-
bers for the benefit of others. We deft-
i nitely secure to each family all the pro-
| tection its prudent, unselfish head pays
i for; we require him to pay year by year
'. only what It actually costs for the year;
' nnd we have made that cost lower than
has been done by any other company.

A BIC BILL
THAT DWINDLED
Judge Campbell's Ready-
Signature to a Treas
ury Demand.
Indorsed as Correct Bills for
Two Amounts for the
Same Service.
Fat Jobs of Court Stenographers Who
Have Free Access to the City's
Vaults.
Police Judge Campbell and his sten
ographer, Howard Vernon, may be
asked by the Grand Jury to explain
the enormous fees charged for the
transcription of the evidence of the
preliminary examination of the Figel
case. The stenographer's bill was. for
six days' attendance in court at $10 a
day, and 22,553 folios of transcript at
15 cents a folio and 2200 additional
folios at 10 cents, making a total
charge of $3662 95. That bill was paid
on an order of Police Court 1 and in
dorsed a3 correct by Judge Campbell.
The money was drawn direct from the
treasury on the order, without the
scrutiny of any of the officials who
guard the city vaults, as to its correct
ness. The bill might have been a cor
rect one, but no one but the stenog
rapher knows whether it was or not.
Suspicion was first directed toward the
bill when an order was presented to
the Treasurer for the transcript of the
testimony in the Figel case two days
after the case was closed in the Police
Court. The bill that time called for
over $3900. The presentation of the bill
so soon after the case closed excited
the curiosity of the Treasurer, and he
asked if the transcript of the testi
mony had been completed. It had not,
nor was it in the possession of the
proper city officials, and the stenog
rapher was asked to delay his bill until
the transcript had been completed. Just
the same, Judge Campbell had signed
the bill as being correct. The
bill was a few days later presented,
and it was about $300 less than the pre
vious figures. Judge Campbell, how
ever, indorsed both bills as being cor
rect.
A stenographer's position in the
police courts is a sinecure. At the
close of the last fiscal year the fees of
the four Police Court reporters were as
follows: Police Court 1. $5211 60; court
2, $7008 10; court 3. $4238; court 4,
$4911 30. These fees give the stenog
raphers greater salaries than any of
the Judges of any of the courts of the
city and county. It is estimated that
extra transcripts of the court proceed
ings net the stenographers at least an
additional sum of half the fees, regu
larly charged, bringing the total of the
SCENES AT INGLESIDE COURSING PARK.
earnings up to nearly $7000 a year â
which is $1000 more than a Justice of
the Supreme Court receives.
All the bills of the stenographers pass
to the treasury without being vised as
to correctness, and the city has nu
knowledge of the number of gold bricks
it has purchased by cashing the orders.
The judges claim that the bill in
dorsed by them should be paid direct
by the Treasurer without question. They
claim that the law gives them that S
right. Auditor Broderlck says there is
no such law in existence, and that no i
test has yet been made of any laws i
under which the Judges act. Cases â¢
somewhat similar have been carried to j
the courts, and decisions have been giv- ;
en by the Supreme Court to the ettect
that the Boards of Supervisors nave
no right to vise the bills of the judges,
but there is silence as to the Auditor's
right to Judge whether the bills are
just or not. According to the law as
It is Interpreted by the Auditor, that
official cannot deny a warrant on an
order of the court if It be legal. If
the court in making an order on the
treasury quote the law on which it is
based it bars the Auditor (if the law
be constitutional) from refusing a war
rant on the treasury. If, however, he
should find that the court is imposed
upon to the extent that there is a non
delivery of the material or service for
which the order is issued, then he
would have the ability to notify the
court so that a revocation of the order
might be made.

Although the rain poured down In
torrents at Ingleside Coursing Park
yesterday morning a large crowd was
present when the clouds clearecj away
and allowed the game called coursing
to open. Unusually strong hares and
ambitious dogs participated, and not
withstanding the dampness of the
early part of the day not a disappoint
ed spectator was among the many.
Two Eastern dogs, Dakota and Mys
tic Maid, for the first time in the com
bat of a course on this coast were
slipped yesterday, and although the
former proved a surprise in lacking
qualities, the latter, a dainty, spunky
hound, manifested the fact by her per
formance that when she becomes ac
climated only the best performers can
be safely pitted against her. Dakota
was up against Magnet in the run
down, but there he died. Speed was
lacking as well as cleverness, and it is
safe to say that Dakota will not run
agin for some time, at least not until
his lungs become accustomed to West
ern air. Mystic Maid was pitted
against the clever little animal Nellie |
B, and won the course by superior
speed and equal cleverness.
Another small sensation was created
by a Fresno dog known as Widow
Brophy. The Widow started with
Bendalong, and soon took the hare,
leaving Bendalong far behind. The run
was not satisfactory for the Widow,
and she started out on a little game of
her own, and succeeded in scaring up
three hares. The first was caught by
the game animal in a short distance,
and then she took after the second.
The second hare proved strong, but
notwithstanding this fact after a run
or two around the grounds it was cap
tured and killed. Then the Widow went
after the third. The game animal fol
lowed the startled hare around the
grounds until she began to show signs
of collapse, and to avoid a possible
fatality another dog was slipped to
finish the vagrant hare. The work was
soon over and Widow Brophy then
submitted to capture. Altogether the
day's sport was an exceptionally good
one, and considerable money changed
hands on the various events. The re
sults follow.

DEAN AT UNION PARK.
His Swift Hound Connemara
Carried Off the Laurels on
the Course Yesterday.
About 2000 people visited the Union
Coursing Park yesterday to witness
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, MOXPAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898.
the runs for the three purses which
had been hung up. Although the
hounds ran well and the hares were
exceptionally good, much dissatisfac
tion was expressed at the work done by
Slipper 11. L. Taylor, and the decision
rendered by Judge E. J. Bull on the
result between Master Jack and
O'Grady in the second ties of the Union
Park Derby.
In the go between Royal Buck and
Blackette the slips were carried away
by Royal Buck, which ruined his
chances, and in other slips the dogs
were not started on an even footing.
What caused the most trouble, how
ever, was the decision giving the hound
O'Grady the course over Master Jack.
It seemed for a time as though a free
fight would ensue, but fortunately the
disturbance was quelled and the sport
proceeded. Many hard words passed
between a number of spectators and
Slip Steward C. C. Griswold from the
fact that the steward was curt in reply
ing to ordinary questions concerning the
decision given by the Judge. It was
claimed by Judge Bull that O'Grady
won from the fact that he had led to
the hare, which entitled him to four
points, but the majority of those pres
ent claimed that Master Jack had been
wrongfully decided against. However,
taken all in all, the day proved a pleas
ant and exciting one.
Next Saturday and Sunday an open
stake, with $500 added, $2 50 entry, will
be run off. The draw will be held at
Pythian Castle Wednesday night.

PERMANENT ZOO.
Building Nearly Completed â Open
to the Public Saturday.
FRANK C. BOSTOCK.
The opening of a permanent zoo in San Francisco is now an established
fact. The building being erected for that purpose, on the Wallace-street side
of the Chutes, will be completed in a few days and the animals with which
the zoo will be stocked will arrive in this city next Wednesday. It is ex
pected that the promoters of the enterprise will be ready to open the zoo to
the public on next Saturday with about 200 animals, each the finest speci
men of its kind procurable. One of the principal animals, and one which
will afford great pleasure to the children, is Jolly, the famous elephant from
the London Zoo, who has always shown especial liking for children, car
rying them on his back and allowing them all kinds of childish liberties
with him. He has never been known to resent any playful trick. Jolly is
also well known as an especially strong and intelligent elephant^ he at one
time successfully pulling against 100 men in a tug of war. On his way
across the continent he is being used to do all the switching of cars, doing
away with the use of a locomotive for such purposes. Another animal of
note is Tommy Wallace, the largest, tallest and handsomest lion ever seen
In captivity. Bostock, his present owner, has refused $10,000 for him from
the London Zoo.
There will also be a monstrous specimen of the lion-slaying baboon,
the only animal known to successfully combat the king of the forest. The
baboon to be exhibited here permanently Is one of the most ferocious of its
kind, it having recently torn an arm from one of its keepers.
The aswail, an animal Inhabiting the Himalaya Mountains, the only
animal of its kind ever exhibited in this country, will also be a special at
traction at the zoo. The aswail has many points similar to a bear.
All the other animals are equally as attractive, being the best speci
mens of their kind.
Frank C. Bostock, who will have charge of the animals at the zoo, Is an
Englishman, ami one of the best-known handlers of animals in the world.
His mother was a Miss Wombwell, whose father established the first travel
ing menagerie in 1806 in England. A brother of Frank C. Bostick now has
a permanent zoo in London playing in opposition to Barnum & Bailey's
show, exhibiting in that city at this time. Bostock recently dispatched an
agent to Borneo, Sumatra, for the purpose of procuring several orang-outangs,
an animal unable to live in this climate for any length of time on account
of being subject to affection of the lungs. It will therefore be necessary to
Import a number to insure the safe arrival of a specimen. He also has
agents in all parts of the world, through whom he will from time to time
increase the number of animals in the zoo. Among the most recent pur
chases is the elephant ridden by H. R. H. the Prince of Wales while hunt
ing in India.
The large experience had by Mr.Bostock â¢will be a guarantee of his
adaptability to the position in which he has been placed by the managers
of the Chutes, to which the zoo is attached.
As the regular admission fee as now prevailing at the Chutes will be
maintained and no additional charge made for admission to the zoo, the
people of San Francisco will have an instructive and entertaining place of
amusement without putting a heavy burden upon the taxpayers, as the
present zoo will in every way fill all the requirements of a public institu
tion of its nature.
GRIFFO MOURNS
A RUBY LIP
A Too Affectionate Dam
sel Bit Off a
Piece.
He Had No Money, but Kisses
Were Current Coin for
the Time.
The Pugilist Carries His Mouth in a
Sliny and Says His Partner
Bit Him.
A man would give all other bliss,
And all his worldly worth for this.
To waste his whole heart in one kiss
Upon her perfect lips.
These lines appeal less strongly to
"Young Griffo," the pugilist, than they
did a few days ago. His sense of poetry
has been somewhat bluntedâ and, in
cidentally, he has been compelled to
carry his mouth in a sling ever since
I he tried to carry out the bard's in
! Junction.
Because of his gallantry, Griffo yipld
i ed a kiss to a smitten maiden, and in
her ardour she broke away with a
piece of his lip, and now Griffo says he
was hit too hard by his sparring part
ner.
It was lack of money, primarily, that
' caused the loss of Griffo's most neci-s-
I sary feature. He and a friend wanted
i a drink, and his friend was broke.
Griffo had 20 cents and a friendship for
a bartender in the Brighton saloon,
and thither he and his friend went.
The much-needed beverages had not
been prepared when they were joined
by a young lady. Dispensing with the
! formality of an introduction, she an
! nounced a consuming thirst, and askea
Ito be included In the Griffo treat. It
! was hard, but Griffo assured the young
lady that his worldly possessions, were
all included in the drinks already con
| tracted for, and he had not enough to
buy her a drink at Lotta's fountain.
It was an unfortunate situationâ very
unfortunateâ but the lady was equal to
it. Since Griffo could not buy her a
drink, he could give her a kissâ and
they would be just as good friends as
if bound by the ties of John Barley
cornâso would the penniless pugilist
make amends in that wayâ and this
was before he had his drink, too.
Griffo'e gallantry would brook no re
treatâand he leaned toward the thirsty
danmsel and kissed her fair and
square as damsel could desire, but for
getting for a moment the Dresden
china texture of Griff o's features, the
young lady went too far, and though
he got the kiss. Griff o lost the where
withal for future successful efforts.
She had bitten off a piece of his face â
and Grlffo has no face to spare.
The too affectionate maiden was hor
rified at what she had done. She of
fered gold until the thirsty Griffo and
a score of friends need never thirst
again, but this .the pugilist refused.
It was an accident, he said, plainly an
accident, and then he revived the
maiden with the drink he had pur
chased for himself. But he had the
kiss, and his friends say It doesn't
make so much difference, anyhow.

PLUNDERED
An Unknown Thief Robs

Vases.
Three Robberies Committed in
the Church in the Past
Two Weeks.
The Last Pilfering Was Perpetrated
on the Eve of a Holy
Feast.
The French Church on Bush street
was desecrated last Friday evening by
an unknown thief who stole from the
sacred shrine two vases which had
been dedicated to the sacred effigy on
the St. Joseph altar. THIS is the third
crime of a like nature which has been
perpetrated within the church during
the past two weeks, not a single trace of
the thief having been detected.
The first time the sacrilegious ma
rauder began operating his nefarious
trade in the edifice was about two
weeks ago, when he robbed the Sodal
ity rooms in the basement of the
church of all the games and various
articles of pastime which Father Du
bois provided for the members dur
ing their social gatherings there.
Hot he gained access to this portion
of the building is not definitely known,
but it is presumed that he picked the
lock of one of the windows on the
Stockton-street side of the church

" 1 havr used Ripans Tabules and they have done me lots of

a blacksmith. "After a hard day's work I would eat too much, I
guess," continued he, "and suffer like everything. My wife's brother
told me that Ripans Tabules had helped him and he thought they
would help me. I believe they have cured me, but I still take them
regular, for I would not have them pains again for anything. My

members of the clergy. *jÂ£
It was not until the disappearance of
two vases from the Virgin's altar a few
nights later and two more from the
altar of St. Joseph the following week
(last Friday night) that the clergy con
cluded to take the matter under advise
ment. Who the thief is and what dis
posal he makes of his plunder is a mys
tery that they are entirely unable to
solve. The onJy possible theory that the
priests are able to advance is that the
crimes must have been committed dur
ing the mid-day lunch hour or at 6
o'clock, when the church is compara
tively empty, there being few if any
worshipers in the church at this time
and no priests.
Considerable sorrow is expressed by
the clergy, as the last theft was com
mitted almost upon the eve of their an
nual celebration of the Forty Hours'
Adoration.
When Father Guibert entered the
church yesterday morning to solemnize
the mass which was to be celebrated
in honor of the commencement of the
service little did the hundreds and hun
dreds of devout worshipers think that
but a few hours before the same shrine
where they now offered up their pray
ers was visited and plundered by an
outcast who had lost all respect and
every vestige of honor and religious
respect and fear.
All day the devotees assembled before
the sacred tabernacle to offer up their
devotions for the reward of the prom
ised indulgence for their faithfulness.
The ceremony will continue to-day,
concluding to-morrow morning with a
solemn high mass.

IT IS NOT YET TOO LATE.
Either Woodward or Brosnahan Can Earn
the Gratitude of Oakland To-Night.
Oakland Office San F4fmclsco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 27.
The allied water companies of this city evidently take issue with
Abraham Lincoln. They have taken the trouble to show, in the most
positive manner, their belief that so far as Oakland is concerned, all
the people can be fooled all the time.
It is just possible that there may have been a mistake made
by : the combination in this assumption and" that the fooling may coma
from the other side. That the people have been fooled since 1593 ad
mits of no doubt, but a quintet of years is not "all the time," any
more than poor Woodward is all of the combination. Some one, dur
ing the controversy, has said that it would, perhaps, be the best thing
that could happen to Oakland, to let the water companies charge the
rates on the Hennebory schedule for one year, for that such a system
atic steal, month after month, is about the only thing that will im
press upon the public mind the necessity of remembering at the next
election that ratepayers are not serfs or willing victims of robbers.
It is true that this method of retaliation will necessitate nearly a
year of waiting, but the Job was put up a year ago, prior to the city
convention, and it is about as certain that another such scheme is
already incubating for next year.
One hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a big stake to play for,
and a big sum for the people to lose, and the best legal talent Is being
employed to consummate the job. Hennebery and Heitmann have been
particularly well posted in the intricacies of the charter and parlia
mentary procedure during the past month, and it is certain that
neither of them has lacked for a roach.
It is a good sign that Mayor Thomas has stated very emphatically
that he will veto the ordinance because such. action will make it cer
tain that the matter will go into the court? if the companies attempt
to collect rates under the Hennebery resolution.
There is more than a suspicion that tho. Solid Six may attempt
a job to-morrow night, in which even Herod will out-Herod himself.
It is a good opportunity to carry out a scheme, for the water-rate or
dinance cannot be brought up, as it is still being printed, and there
is nothing of particular interest to the public, consequently only a
small lobby may be present. The probable scheme is to rescind the
resolution of last Monday night by the Solid Six's vote, and then a
speech embodying these facts will be made: "This being the last night
in February, it Is our duty, to-night, to fix the water rates under the
law. We do not want to be placed in the position of the San Fran
cisco Supervisors, and be indicted for neglecting our duty. The ordi
nance now in print is not a law, and consequently cannot be consid
ered as having legally nxod water rates. We received the report of
the committee and their ordinance, and have had full time to study
it. The committee informs us that it made all kinds of inquiry, and
took volumes of testimony. We have considered the matter in open
meeting, and, therefore, we now offer the following resolution fixing
rates for the next fiscal year. " And it would get six votes.
This scheme is said, by an attorney, to be almost a cinch, and
would avoid the necessity of the Mayor's veto. Whether this scheme
will be tried or not remains to be seen.
There is yet another speculation in the air. Con Brosnahan Is
now posing as a conundrum, and I would not undertake to give a
solution of his position. He has given it out that he is going to assist
in allowing his enemies (the water companies) in charging their own
prices for water, merely because he is piqued at the action of some
gentlemen who did not vote for his liquor ordinance. Nobody believes
this, and Brosnahan knows the people do not believe it. His resolu
tion fixing water rates on the basis of 1897 is with the clerk and could
be called up and passed to-morrow night, if he so desired it. He,
having voted "aye" on the Hennebery resolution, could move to re
consider, and could kill it, and in the same breath could call up and
pass his own resolution.
Brosnahan, at this stage of the game, for game It is, is invested
with greater trust than was Woodward.
Such a coup would make Con Brosnahan the next Sheriff of Ala
meda County.
Now comes Major Woodward. In The Call of the 19th he says,
"I am for the people." In the Examiner of yesterday he say?, "I can
come to no other conclusion than that my vote and position are un
popular." This being so, it would seem that it is the easiest thing in
the world to become popular, far easier and much more comfortable
than to try and prove that being "for the people" is to oppose their
wishes. No matter what Mr. Woodward thought last Monday night
or last Thursday night, he surely knows now how he ought to think.
After all, he has been condemned rather prematurely, for it is a com
mon custom to vote to pass a measure to print for the purpose of let
ting the public read it, and in numerous Instances it fails of final
passage.
Should Major Woodward call up the Brosnahan resolution to-mor
row night and vote for it, or, better still, when the ordinance comes
up later, vote for it to be amended back into the ordinance as recom
mended by the committee, thus showing his mistake, as he has said,
was "of the head and not of the heart," Oakland would bow before
him, and he could get 20,000 signatures to a petition for pension agent
or anything else.
It is not too late. STUART W. BOOTH.
"UNDER THE
PARTY LASH"
So Says Rev. E. R. Dille of the
City Council on the
Water Rate.
No Christian Can Vote a Straight
Ticket at the Peril of His
Soul.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Feb. 27.
The action of the City Council on the
\rater rate ordinance was the theme of
a prelude to the regular sermon of tne
Rev. E. R. Dille of the First Methodist
Episcopal Church to-night. He paid:
"The recent stir about the Council and
the water . rates seems . to be but a new
phase of an old fight. I remember sev- !
eral years ago an Indignation meeting in
Dletz Hall about the alleged water the
Contra Costa Company was selling us at
a fancy priceâ water that you could not
drink without getting a sandbar in your
system; water that was too thin for pea
potip and too thick for a beverage. Now
the dirt seems to have got out ot the
water Into the Council. Dirt, you know,
lias been defined as real estate in . the
wrong place. Do not go away and say
that I said a 'real estate agent in the
wrong place,' for I still hope and believe
that my old friend, Major "Woodward,
voted in the first Instance for the water
Bteal under a misapprehension and then
stuck to it through a false pride of con
sistency, and I trust he will. justify my
good opinion by daring to do right.
â¢ "I confess to you. that recent develop
ments have surprised me In two ways.
;I have been surprised at the. action of-
Borne members of the Council and 1 have
been surprised that the people have gone

Iniquitous ordinance which put our water !
rates back to the larceny figure of the j
old monopoly seven years agoâ l hope
that some of them will listen to the voice
of reason, of conscience, of their friends
and of all their fellow-citizens, who are
not corporation tools, and rescind both
these measures. If they do not, wo expect
the Mayor to veto the ordinance, and then
the courts to defeat the resolution, which j

fealty or expediency, were to have a

disaster than that recently in Havana

Men of Oakland. I wish I could bring

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, IS9B.
ADDRESSED BY
THEIR FOUNDER
General Booth Leads a
Day With God in
Oakland.
Uses the Maine Incident to
Close a Forcible
Argument.
Enormous Crowds Gather at the
Theater on All These
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, |
908 Broadway, Feb. 27.
In the middle of the platform in the I
1 Macdonough Theater, three times to- ;
day, prayed and spoke the most unique
Individual that has ever been seen In
. Oakland's playhouse.
Surrounded on the atage by four hun
dred of his officers and facing an au
: dience that filled every seat and corner
from floor to dome, General Booth '
i conducted a day with God and gave !
three addresses in his usual dramatic,
logical and convincing language.
The Macdonough Theater has never
contained such an audience. Not even
Steve Brodle or "The Girl From Paris"
is as strong an attraction as General
Booth. As the white-haired old man
stands erect it is impossible to look at
him without letting the mind go back
ito that little hall In Mile-end Road,
London, where less than thirty years
ago the Salvation Army had its birth.
The scope of its present work was
shown to some extent by the procession
which for several blocKs, accompanied
by two brass bands, passed through the
streets of Oakland twice during the j
day. There were colored faces, some
Chinese officers, others who spoke with
a strong Yankee accent, while a few !
were so English in their language that
'â  one almost expected to see hackney
cabs and tramcars bowling along be- .
side them.
The orchestra was filled with musi
cians such as the Macdonough hitherto
knew not of. Every player, fnom the
cornetist to the bass-drum operator,
wore a red shirt with an army crest
upon It. with the exception of one lady
who handled an alto horn.
The big audience was composed of
ministers and judges, attorneys, men
about town and of many classes that
are not usually seen at religious gath
erings. During the whole of the day
there was not a single vacant seat and
not a soul moved during the ad-
dresses.
General Booth is a dramatic speaker.
He has a tremendous command of his
vc-lce, which permits him to shout or
whisper with equal distinctness. At
times during his impassioned moments
he falls on his knees and pleads with
remarkable force. Another instant hÂ«
will be jumping around, his long arms
raised toward the ceiling, while h?
i forces some special point.
In the morning he took for his sub
ject, "All things are possible to them
that believe," and his discourse was
: largely alung the lines of personal holi- I
ness.
This afternoon he drew some power
ful pictures from the old story of Ana
nias and Sapphira.
"Whether you like it or not," said lie,
, "I want to tell you some truths. There
1 may be ministers In Oakland and Sal
] ration officers, too, for all are God's
servants, who believe they can bring
j about practical results in the hearts of
, mankind by relying upon themselves
entirely. I have had over half a cen
tury of experience along these lines,
and I can truthfully say that I have
i not accomplished anything except
i through the working of God In me."
After reciting the story of the two
; ancient liars, and making special ref
erence to the "keeping back" part of
the prlcp, the general drew the follow
ing dramatic word picture, suiting his
gestures to the different phases of his
story:
"A man and a woman aro united in
wedlock. On their knees they promise
i God that the outcome of their mar
: riage shall be dedicated solely to his
i honor and glory. By and by an an
gelic-faced bright-eyed little babe
comes alongâ a gift from the Almighty,
j a sacred trust. It is clasped by its pa
! rents in their arms, and falling on
their knees they return thanks to the
Almighty for his pift and again renew
their vows. As the little one grows its
Intellect develops, one friend after an
| other sees something to praise about it,
! suggests this and proposes that, and
i there arises an element of vanity in
; the parents for their child. This in-
I creases as it grows up, they decide to
\ train It this way and that wayâ any
| way but that which they had promised
it should follow. It Is educated along
certain lines, great attention is paid
to special subjects, and what for? To
make a success In the world; eventu
ally, to become a servant of the devil
and ultimately to perish eternally.
This is the result of keeping back a
part of the price."
A few minutes later the ereneral had
gone from pathos to sentiment
"Whoever gained anything by going
back on the Lord?" shouted the gen
eral with his arms extended. "When
we make a bargain with our fellow
man we intend to keep it, and as a rule
wo do keep it. It Is just as criminal
and wicked to repudiate a bargain be
tween the conscience and God as be
tween man and man.
"God Is not mocked. You can
not mock your fellow-man; you
cannot mock the Government of
the United States; you cannot
take advantage of anybody be
cause they will seek redress.
God is not mocked any more
than this country can be
mocked. The Government of the
United States Is at this very In
stant proclaiming to the world
In 'no uncertain tones, and to one
country especially, that It will
not be mocked, and If it shall
be found that It has been mocked
you all know the result that will
follow. It is so with God. Com
pacts cannot be broken with im
punity."
"Fifty-two years ago I became a
Christian, and from that day to this I
have never been content -with keeping
my religion to myself. I always want
ed some one else to share It, knowing
what a valuable possession It is. These
Ideas all Salvationists try to carry out.
We know In whom we have believed
and we have seen that it 13 only the
pure Gospel that can save this world
For fifty-two years I have worked
along these lines, and, if I live for an
other half a century, I would do the
same.
<3> "I did not make the Bible, but *â¦
â¦ if I had made a Bible I am sure $>
"â¦, I should have made it a good â¦
deal easier to follow than it is.
1 should have left some out and
put other matter in, and what a
glorious failure such a Bible
would have been. No man could
have made our Bible, and any
man if he tried to make one
must of necessity produce a very
inferior work, because our Bible
is complete and is of God."
General Booth opened his remarks
to-night by saying: "I am well satis
fied with the meeting this afternoon. â 
It was one of the best in all of my ex- |
periences. People are usually satisfied !
to sleep their souls away in the after- '
noons, but this was an exception. ,
Thirty-nine I am sure were born into !
the kingdom. Thirty-nine came right
up on to this platform and went away,
as did all who were here, greatly dif
ferent from the condition in which they ,
came. Now, what we want to-night
ts the coming of sinners from this j
audience to salvation, leaving sin to I
enjoy a new life."
He then took his text from Jeremiah \
xii: "If thou hast run with the foot- !
men, and they have wearied thee, then >
how canst thou contend with horses? ,
and, if in the land of peace wherein ;
thou trustest. they wearied thee, then
how will thou do in the swelling of
Jordan."
"Crossing death's stream is far '
greater than battling with life's ;
trials," he said, "and is a vastly dif
ferent thing. Hear a few of the points !
to be considered in the matter of death.
It is a certainty its uncertainty is as to !
when it will come; it is usually a time !
of great suffering physically, and no j
one wants to be mentally tortured as I
to his future at such a time; one has to j
die alone; death is going to fix one's
destiny. What are you going to do in
view of all these facts?"

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or doited lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first nppear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure Is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. Tha
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898.
NATIONAL CLUB
ON THE GRILL
"Welshing" on the Ryan-
Green Fight Receives
Caustic Criticism.
"Kid" McCoy Refuses to Box a
Native Californian in
This City.
Bunkoing of Fitzsimmons Bearing
Bitter Fruit â Erne- May Face
Dal Hawkins.
Whether revolvers were or were not
drawn at the meeting in Groom's hat
store last Saturday, when Ryan and j
Green went in to get the money due j
them on their fistic contest of the night
preceding, threatens to develop into as j
great a mystery as the identity of the i
villain who struck Billy Patterson.
George Harting, official timekeeper for
the National Club, an eye-witness of
the scene, told a responsible sporting
man they were, but afterward denied
himself for publication. The fact that
his tenure of office depended on silence
is not alleged as a reason for George's
reversal of tongue.
But Tommy Ryan, willing as he is to
give Green another chance to regain j
his lost laurels, has firmly made up his i
mind that never again will he fight un
der the auspices of the National Club.
Despite his friendship for Gibbs and
Groom, Green is also much disgruntled
over the club's not keeping its word as
regards the $4000 guarantee. As the
"right promoters" assert, they might
have violated their agreement with
kindred organizations by giving more
than 60 per cent of the gross gate re
ceipts, but lovers of fair play are unan- I
imously of the opinion that they should
not have signed to violate their agree
ment in the first place.
This act of "welshing" on the part ;
of the National Liub duo and a sup
posed journalistic silent partner can j
naturally serve only to embitter the
hostility evinced by the East against
the California public, which it has
oeen unjustly led to believe by the j
Sharkey-Fitzsimmons fiasco to show
favoritism to native-born boxers. A j
good idea of the false light in which |
the State has been placed by that
child of the National Club duo is :
shown in a recent letter sent to Wil
liam J. Kennedy, superintendent of the
Olympic Club, by Homer Selby, brother
of "Kid" McCoy. .
"The 'Kid' would like to get a fight |
in California under the auspices of the j
Olympic Club," stated Seiby, "but |
will refuse to fight a native-born Cali
fornian like Choynski, Jeffreys and |
Sharkey. The Kid' intends to claim i
the championship by default on March I
9. Later on he has an engagement to j
spar with Peter Maher before a kineto- j
scope, but would like afterward to get j
a battle in California. He will bar !
none of the heavy-weights of the world,
but will not fight a native Californian
in his own State."
Kennedy, in common with the public
;in general, now learns for the first
time that Sharkey is a native Califor
nian. However, this mistake of the
writer does not alter the fact that a
. referee in any glove contest her-; is
believed always to favor local men.
; The bunkoing of "Lanky Bob" In a
fight pulled off by the National Crib
is commonly admitted to be the cause
lof this erroneous opinion. Their act
i of "welshing" on the Green-Ryan con
i test will not help to better that Im
pression.
Frank Erne has written to Dal Haw
kins that he would like to come out
here and box him at 130 pounds, givo
or take two, some time in April. Haw
kins htis replied that he has placed h.
forfeit of $250 up for the contest. Etrna
has also written the superintendent of
the Olympic Club that he is willing to
box either Hawkins or McConnell.

WHAT'S THAT? YOU ARE?
GOING TO BUY A PIANO?
WELL. NOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
A piano made in IS9S. with every dollar ex-
pended on the instrument, modern in every
respect, with all the late attachments, or the
same old piano made from 1849 scales?
I have a piano to sell that I will guarantee
from top to bottom and will back it with
every dollar I have. As I own my own build-
ins and store, and as the manufacturers also

PREPARING
TO MAKE A
TRUE CENSUS
The School Depart
ment Will Make
Extra Effort.
The Elementary Commit
tee Has Issued New
Orders.
Compulsory Education Law
Will Be Strictly En
forced.
PARENTS TO BE NOTIFIED
Much Money Will Bo Saved to the
City by the New
ReglmÂ«.
The Elementary Committee of the
Board of Education, has issued orders
to the newly appointed Census Mar
hal. Thomas F. Maher, that extraor
dinary precautions must be taken to
Every parent, guardian, or other person, in the State of California, hav
ing control and charge of any child or children between the ages of eight
and fourteen years., shall be required to send any such child or children
to a public school for a period of at least two-thirds of the time during
which a public school shall be taught in each city, or city and county, or
school district. In each school year, commencing on the first day of July in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, at
least twelve weeks of which shall be consecutive, unless such child or
children are excused from such attendance by the Board of Education of
the city, or city and county, or of the trustees of the school district in
which such parents, guardians, or other persons reside, upon its being
shown to their satisfaction that his or her bodily or mental condition has
been such as to prevent attendance at school or application to study for
the period required, or that the parents or guardians are extremely poor
or sick, or that such child or children are taught in a private school, or at
home, in such branches as are usually taught in the primary schools of
this State, or have already acquired a good knowledge cf. such branches;
provided, in case a public school shall not be taught for three months* dur
ing the year within one mile by the nearest traveled road of the residence
of any person within the school district, he shall not be liable to the provis
ions of this act.
In case any parent, guardian, or other person shall fall to comply with
the provisions of this act, said parent, guardian, or other person shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable to a fine of not more
than twenty dollars; and for the second and each subsequent offense the
fine shall not be less than twenty dollars nor more than fifty dollars; and
the parent, guardian, or other person so convicted shall pay all costs.
Each such fine shall be paid to the secretary of the Board of Education.
CHARLES L. BARRINGTON,
President Board of Education, San Francisco, Cal.
see that all children of school age are
enrolled during the canvass that is
about to begin.
These orders have been issued be
cause of the fact the committee be
lieves that in years past the city has
not received from the State the amount
of money to which the School Depart
ment is entitled. It is believed that
fully 10 per cent of the school children
shown by the census have failed to at
tend any school and that by carrying
out the provisions of the law the city
will be saved several thousand dollars
annually.
The mode of procedure that will be
adopted will hinge on the report of the
Census Marshal. The attendance as
recorded by the principals will be com
pared with the Marshal's report, and
the names of those children who fail
to attend will be called for several days
in succession in order to give them an
opportunity to. respond. In case they
fail to answer the truant officer will be
sent after them in accordance with the
provisions of the compulsory education
law, and parents will be held account
able for the non-appearance of their
children. This law in substance re
quires that all children between 5 and
17 years of age must attend school, and
a penalty is provided for the non-ob
servance of the statute.
The Board of Education has reason
to believe from experience of past
years that the city loses annually sev
eral thousand dollars because of
non-attendance of children and that It
is required to pay some thousands of
dollars to the general State school fund
In excess of what it receives. This is
the matter the "Elementary Committee
desires to correct.
Another matter to be closely looked
to will be the careful allotting of schol
ars to their proper schools. Hereto
fore scholars have been placed accord
ing to the blocks in the city map, re
sulting in the overcrowding of some
schools and a sparse attendance at
others. The new method It is intended
to employ will allot the children of
school age according to population and
the scholars will be arranged accord
ingly.
By this means it is hoped to save the
services of a large number of teachers
and avoid a portion of the threatening
deficit in the School Department funds.
MISS WILLARD'S
NAME IS EULOGIZED
Memorial Services Held in
Honor of America's "Un
crowned Queen."
Beautiful Tributes of Love and Re
spect Paid to a Brilliant Chris
tian Woman.
A large and interested congregation
filled the Simpson Memorial Methodist
Church last night to do honor to the
memory of Miss Frances E. Wlllard, the
bright star and shining light of the Wo
man's Christian Temperance Union, who
has passed to the great majority that
has gone before. The occasion was the
memorial services held to do honor to the
most brilliant woman that America has
produced In this century. Many kind
words were spoken, deep sympathy was
expressed, and the eulogy that comes to
the tongue from the promptings of per
sonal bereavement were bespoken as trib
ute and homage upon the name of Fran
ces Wtllard.
The exercises were presided over by
Mrs. L. P. Williams, who read the Cru
sade Psalm of the W. C. T. U., "Praiso
Ye the Lord," after which Mrs. Nellie B.
Eyster delivered an address upon the
early life of Miss Willard. She said: "As
I thank God for the sunshine, so do I
thank him that Frances Wlllard lived. I
was a member of the National W. C. T.
U. Convention that was held some years
ago In Nashville, Term., when Miss Wil
lard was requested to write the story of
her life. Sho did Â»o, and 'Glimpses of
Fifty Tears.' one of the most beautiful
books, kas the result."
Beginning with Miss Willard's birth in
New York State near Rochester on Sep
tember 28, 1839, Mrs. Eyster beautifully
sketched her young life up to the time
she became identilied with the temper
ance cause.
Mrs. D. J. Spencer, the corresponding
secretary of the W. C. T. IT. of Califor
nia, next spoke. She declared that Miss
Wlllard's life was like an open book, and
spoke of the wonderful effect that it had
had upon so many people for their good.
Her intellectual and spiritual aspirations
always kept apace with each other, and
during ten years of platform work she
delivered on an average of one lecture a
day. "Her death." said Mrs. Spencer,
"is" a personal loss to every one In this
country."
Rev. W. S. Matthew. D. D., followed
Mrs. Spencer and from his personal
knowledge of Miss Willard he told of her
lovely Christian character and noble
work. In describing her he said:
"Her voice was not strong, but her face
was magnificent. I shall never forget her
bright, genial eye, her mobile yet firm
lips, or the poise of that broad Intellect
ual head upon the slender body. She was
not only a scholar, but she was also rich
in the information of travel, and when
she spoke her words went straight to the
heart and conscience."
Rev. John Stephens paid to Miss Wil
lard the highest compliment of all. In
ap%aking of the high estimation in which
she was held all over the world he said:
"When the Americans joined with the
British in doing honor to Queen Victoria,
the English responded by calling Miss
Willard 'America's Uncrowned Queen.'
Alas, I must say the Queen is dead!"
here the speaker paused, looked about
him. and then In a voice shaken with
emotion he said, "and where shall I turn
to cry, 'I.Â«ong live the Queen!'
"She won her immortality in this world,
and now the crown 01" life, the reward of
those who are faithful unto death. Is
hers."
During the exercises a beautiful offer
tory was sung by Miss Alma Bergland.
JUDGE HUNT'S MOTHER DEAD .
Remarkable Prophetic Fulfillment as
to the Time of Her Demise â It
Came as She Phophesied.
As she had prophesied during the three
years of her last illness, the mother of
judge John Hunt passed away last Fri
day at sundown. During all her illness
she looked forward to that day and hour,
' and as she had foretold it brought death
with it. She was 79 years old and up to
'. three years ago enjoyed excellent health.
I Since that time, however, her health be
| came somewhat Impaired â  from heart
; trouble, which eventually caused her
. death.
Mrs. Hunt came from a family of good
old Pennsylvania Quakers, who settled In
; that State long before the United States
' enjoyed the blessings of independence.
' Her maiden name was Supple, and in the
early history of , the Quaker State this
name can be found coupled with the early
settlers who, when Washington and his
colonists battled for liberty, were found
. in the front ranks of the victorious army.
Her husband, John Hunt, died about
fourteen years ago, leaving her in the
tender care of her devoted son, ' Judge
Hunt, who, with one daughter, did every
thing possible to make her life pleasant
and enjoyable. ' She made her home in
this city with the Judge and his wife. :
In accordance with her last wishes and
with the desires of her son and his fam
ily, the funeral, which will take place
from the residence at 1703 Octavla street
at 10:30 this forenoon, will be private the
intimate relatives only of the family par
ticipating. Rev. W. H. Moreland of St.
i Luke Episcopal Church will officiate at
â  the residence, where the ceremony will
take Place The body will be interred in
Laurel Hill Cemetery, where the family
has a vault. â

A YOUTH WHO PROMISES TO BE A GENIUS.
Walter Morosco considers that he has found a genius in the thespian
line and has been congratulating himself that fate sent him into the
theater one afternoon last week while a youth by the name of Daniel
Hanlon was showing the stage manager what he was able to do in the
way of acting.
The boy came to the Grand Opera House two months ago and ap
plied for a position. Stage struck youngsters were a common sight
around that establishment, and no attention was paid to him but he
was persistent and declared that he had to earn his living and he was
willing to do anything. They at last engaged him for a scene shifter
and super. Getting this far he decided to go further, and repeatedly re
quested Mr. Imhaux, the stage manager, to give him a hearing, which
the gentleman promised to do, naming a day that he should be at the
theater.
It was on this occasion that Mr. Morosco happened into the building
and was electrified, as were all those present, at the young fellow's im
personations. He made inquiries about him and found that he was an
earnest, bright boy that was shifting scenes. He Immediately told the
stage manager to do everything for the boy, as he realized he had gen
ius, and he intended that the boy should succeed if he could possibly
help him. . '
Daniel Hanlon. who is just 21, has had an interesting career. He was
born in this city, and first knew the world as a messenger boy later
he sold newspapers, and then, having saved enough money, he went to
Portland, where he obtained a position as check boy at the Western
Union Telegraph Office this giving him an opportunity to go to day
school, as his hours were from 5:30 p. m. until 3 a. m., and during the
night he would also practice telegraphy until he became expert and ob
tained a position as operator.
In Portland he took elocution lessons, and would speak for anybody
who would listen to him. He gave up telegraphing and then went on
the cars as newsboy, later going East. He came back to San Francisco
as a tramp, and then went to Portland again, returning here two
months ago. and had the experience as previously told. He is an hon
est lad, and does not realize that his talent is anything more than nat
ural.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1898"T
TO HONOR THE MARTYRED DEAD.
The Mechanics' Pavilion to-day will be the scene of a won
derful popular demonstration on behalf of the survivors of the
ill-fated Maine. It has been arranged that all the proceeds of
the day and evening are to go to the immediate relief of fam
ilies of the lost. The managers of the fair have gone to a
meat deal of trouble to introduce attractive features. There
will be a number of vaudeville stars and features of striking
interest. The music will be of a character to stir the hearts
of all to patriotic impulses and the attendance should be such
as to make the day forever memorable as an event in local
history.
PATRIOTISM
WILL OWN
TO-DAY'S FAIR
Miners to Show How
Americans Honor
Their Heroes.
Proceeds of the Day Will
Go to the Maine
Sufferers.
Vaudeville Stars Will Help to
Make the Entertainment
a Success.
MANY NATIONAL ANTHEMS
Music and All the Arts Will Show
That the Country Is One
in Sorrow.
It is the opinion of all connected with
the management of the Mining Fair
that the benefit to-day for the sufferers
of the Mane will be a great success.
Arrangements have been made for a
fine entertainment. Nearly a dozen
well-known vaudeville stars will ap-
pear during the afternoon and evening
for the purpose of adding to the enter
tainment.
Among those who will be present for
the purpose of adding to the pleasure
of the audience are the following:
The wonderful Lozelles, whose only
rivals in their line are the famous fly
ing Jordans, and who have been all
over the world; the Martels, the great
bicyclists, will perform afternoon and
evening; Cunningham and Blake, two
jig representatives of Ireland's wealth,
will give a novel vaudeville act; Schil
ling, the hero of many a long-distance
race in times past, will give an act;
Antonio, the juggling marvel, will ap
pear, and also Master Harry Mangels
and Master Roy Rogers, the little Juve
nile artists.
Interest in the entertainment for the
benefit of the relatives of the unfortu
nate dead is widespread. There is not
a civic or military society that has not
given some touching evidence of the
fact that the cause of the unfortunate
has struck a responsive chord in the
hearts of the multitude.
The following resolution was unani
mously adopted by the board of direc
tors of the Society of California Pio
neers at the regular monthly meeting
held yesterday:
Resolved, That the Society of California
Pioneers is hereby requested by their
presence and aid to assist in the benefit
to be given at the Golden Jubilee Mining
Fair on Monday next to the families of
those killed in the recent disaster to the
United States battle-ship Maine.
Those in charge of the programme
have spared no pains to make the en
tertainment attractive in every pos
sible way. It is highly probable that
the musical features will be of a very
popular character. Many patriotic
airs will be rendered by the great band
that furnishes music each day and
night. The audience will be invited to
Join in the chorus of national anthems,
and that there is little doubt that there
will be such an outburst of patriotism
as has seldom been seen in the his
tory of this part of the State.
Last night there was an interesting
contest between members of various
singing societies. The result of the
balloting on the most popular society
was as follows: Verein Eintracht, 537;
Order of Hermann's Sons, 109; San
Francisco Turn Verein. 67; Germania
Club, 13; Walhalla Encampment, 4.
Five other German societies received
votes, but the workers of the Verein
Eintracht captured everything in
eight.
GARIBALDI GUARDS.
A Ball in Honor of Their Sixteenth
Anniversary.
The Italian inhabitants of the city
turned out In force last night for the
sixteenth annual masquerade ball given
by the Garibaldi Guards at Garibaldi
Hall. 423 Broadway.
The hall was elaborately decorated with
the United States and Italian national
colors and the floor was filled with danc
ers from early In the evening until this
morning. The grand march was led by
F. Demartini and his niece. Miss Amelia
Demartini, and over a hundred masked
couples were* In line. At 12 o'clock, ac
cording to an old Italian custom, a large
balloon In the center of the room was
broken and as the confections fell from
It and three white pigeons were released
from bondage and flew about the room
the dancers unmasked.
The committees having charge of the
ball were:

IT WAS THE WIND'S TURN.
A Gale at the Cliff, but To-day It
Will Be the Water.
When the ocean wind picks up and
comes howling in over the beach sands
and among the Presidio hills the sea goes
down; sullen round topped rollers break
with little more than a show of froth and
bide their time. But when the wind goes
down the waves have a chance and with
a boom and a roar they throw their spray
high over the cliffs and cover the beach
with foam.
Yesterday it was the wind's turn and
all the morning it blew one of those
"tanglefoot" gales that made the few peo
ple who braved it crawl on their hands
and knees. Toward noon it abated and
by evening it was comparatively calm.
Not so with the sea, however. In the
morning it was the calmer element, but
by night it was beginnins to mutter. This
morning, say the old-time haunters of the
cliff, it will be a sight to see.
Travel to the Ciiff House was fair yes
terday afternoon, but the Park was, com
paratively speaking, deserted. There was
no music and there were no whoelcaon.
consequently the hospital and police sta
tion were places of rest and slumber. The
museum attracted nearly 7000 people last
week, but the attendance yesterday was
not large.
At the Chutes the crowd was a fair one
for a threatening day. Chkjuita was the
principal attraction.
At Sutro's Baths there were races and
music as usual. In the 50-yard race for
boys under 12 years of age A. C. Durrant
was first with S. dough second. The 75
yard race for men. professionals barred,
was won by A. East, with G. Carroll sec
ond.
The obstacle race proved the most ex
citing and laughable of the afternoon.
After clambering over railings and im
gedlments of every description Otto
chtirtz managed to reach home first,
closely followed oy Fred Burnett.
In the fancy diving contest Fred Bur
nett was awarded first place. His diving
was graceful and he performed many dif
ficult feats. T. C. Winthrop also did
clever work and was given second place.
Oscar Rice, champion of Southern Call
fornia, swam against Dan Green, San
Francisco, champion, in a 100-yard special
race for a prize of $25. Both covered the
distance neck and neck in the fast time
of 1:12%. Referee Mowry declared the
race a dead heat. Green was willing to
swim again, but Rice for some reason re
fused.
CELEBRATION OF
LENTEN EXERCISES
Members of the Calvarian So
ciety Assemble in the
Cathedral.
Archbishop Riordan Delivers an
Eloquent and Instructive
Sermon.
Over 3000 Catholics assembled in St.
Mary's Cathedral yesterday afternoon to
participate in the Lenten exercises given
under the auspices of the Calvarian So
ciety.
As it had been announced that Arch
bishop Rlordan would open the ceremony
by preaching the initial sermon of a series
to be delivered on Sunday afternoons dur
ing the period of L*nt, much Interest was
manifested by Catholics, who took advan
tage of the opportunity to hear the elo
quent speaker.
Long before the appointed time for the
ceremony to commence people from all
parts of the cityâ Catholics and non-
Catholics alikeâ began to arrive at the
Cathedral in large numbers, crowding the
edifice and blocking the vestibule.
Promptly at 3 o'clock the service began.
It consisted of "The Way of the Cross,"
being said by Father Ramm and partici
pated in by the members of the entire
Calvarian Society, who chanted the an
swers to the prayers as the priest an
nounced them; a sermon by the Arch
bishop and the solemn benediction.
"Watchers With Christ" ("Stay ye here
with me â¢ â¢ â¢ and he cometh with his
disciples and flndeth them asleep") was
the text which the Archbishop chose as
the most appropriate to the occasion.
The preacher briefly outlined the object
of holding religious exercises of this char
acter during Lent, concluding with an ac
knowledgment of the efforts of Fatnei
Ramm, to whom the present prosperous
condition of the Calvarian Society is
mainly due.
At the conclusion of the address bene
diction was said by the Archbishop in
person, assisted by Father Ramm as
master of ceremonies. Services of a sim
ilar character as those observed yester
day will be held by the society next Sun
day afternoon.
BIGHT SORT OF COURAGE.
Rev. David James Talks to the
Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation.
The address yesterday to the' members
of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion was entitled "True Coruage" and
was delivered by Rev. David James, pas
tor of the Franklin-street Presbyterian
Church.
Dr. James spoke of the muchly admired
physical courage,- and, leading up from
that to moral courage, showed, in elo
quent terms, how much superior the one
was to the other and how much greater
is the bravery that dares to do right and
obey the commands of the Lord, despite
the sneers of the world and the prompt
ings of self-interest, than the purely ani
mal bravery that is often nothing more
than a form of vanity and the fear of
what others will think of us. He wound
up by exorting his hearers to persevere
in the higher kind of courage and reap
the final reward that will be much greater
than any that can be bestowed by kins
or potentate.

tectives Tom Gibson and Ellis and
Chief Dwyer of the capital city police
force. He was brought back last night
and locked up in the City Prison.
Lynch was assistant bookkeeper and
collector for Lewis, Anderson & Co.,
| shipchandlers on East street, near Mar
ket. About four weeks ago, it is
claimed, he broke into the safe of the
company and stole $400. The crime was
| discovered a short time afterward and
the police notified.
Detectives Gibson and Ellis were de
tailed to arrest him, and by dint of in
quiry they learned that the absconding
; bookkeeper had gone to San Jose.
The police of the Garden City were
notified, but before they had a chance
Ito arrest him Lynch left, going to
Lathrop. From the latter place he
went to Sacramento, where he was lo
cated by Gibson and Ellis.
Lynch made a complete confession to
; the detectives. He attributed his
downfall to poker and dog races. Some
time ago, he said, he collected $300 be
longing to the firm, and as it was after
I banking hours he concluded to take the
] money home. On the way he visited a
saloon where a game of poker was in
progress, and at the invitation of one
1 of the players he called for a hand. In
I a short time he had lost all the money
he had, including the amount which he
had collected. Fearing exposure and
subsequent disgrace Lynch, according
Ito his own statement, periodically
robbed his employers. The money he
stole he played against the dog races
in the hope of recouping his losses. He
intended in case he made a winning of
several hundred dollars to replace the
amount he had stolen from the com
pany. As ill luck continued to follow
him. Lynch, becoming desperate, re
turned to the store one night after it
had been closed and proceeded to open
the safe. Foiled in his attempt to un
lock the inner drawer in which was
stored the money of the firm, he broke
it open v ith a hatchet. He took WOO in
greenbacks, but overlooked a roll of
crisp bills amounting to $2000. The fol
lowing day Lynch went to San Jose,
where he slept in a barn for several
nights, as he feared being arrested if
he appeared on the streets. Evidently
concluding that the police had aban
doned their search for him Lynch
emerged from his hiding place and pro
ceeded to have a "good time," as he ex
pressed it. In a short time he had
squandered his ill gotten gains, and,
being penniless, he boarded a freight
train and went to Lathrop and thence
to Sacramento.
A short time after the commission of
the crime Lewis, Anderson & Co. had
an expert examine the books of their
former eoHector. with the result that
a shortage of $1000 was discovered.
Lynch confessed to taking the money
and claimed to have lost it at the dog
races. It is likely that other charges
will be placed against him to-day.
EXPLORER PEARY
TALKS OF FOOD
Everything for the Klondike
Should Be Carefully
Chosen.
The Lieutenant Says Liquid
Food Is the Proper Diet
for the North.
Lieutenant Peary, the Arctic explorer,
in his lecture at the Baldwin Theater
last evening, urgently advised his hearers
against patronizing the cheap outfitters
in preparing for the journey to the Klon
dike. In the evening he hit the hand-me
down clothiers and their "cappers" hard,
and advised that only the best material
be purchased.
The explorer gave some very valuable
advice to the would-be Klondikers by tell
ing them the character of the robes they
would require, as well as of the food it
would be wisest for them to take.
For clothes, he advises the following:
Undershirt of birdskin, stockings of fox
skin, trousers of sealskin, shoes of flexible
sealskin, overcoat of reindeer-skin and
undercoat of bearskin. These, he said,
were the most advisable, as they came
from animals that lived in that region and
are destined by nature to protect the
wearer from the severities of the climate
In regard to food, he advised liquid
foods for the Arctic regions, as they are
easier to carry and give the greatest
amount of nutrition. What he would
take, did take and will take, are com
pressed tea, compressed peasoup, con
densed milk and sea biscuit. The milk
he said, is the most nutritious thing a
person can. take, as one can of it is equal
to a gallon of milk and sustains a person
for a long time.
Lieutenant Peary discounted the idea
that sleeping-bags were necessary, stat
ing that by the use of the clothing he had
described such appliances could be safely
eliminated from the outfit. He also said
tents should be made in one piece, the
floor covering being securely fastened to
the upper portion, so that Arctic storms
could not possibly carry away the cover
ing and leave the wayfarer exposed to
the Intense severity of the elements.
