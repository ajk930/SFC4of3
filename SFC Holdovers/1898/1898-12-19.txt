APPEALED FOR AID
ONLY WHEN HUNGER
LURED DEATH ON
Starving People of Lockwood
Hesitated Long Before Making
Known Their Need.
Reports of Their Deplorable Condition Have Not
Been Exaggerated â Relief Measures to
Be Taken Immediately.
KIN'iS CITY, Dec. IS.â Bereft of
ock of all descn:
w ithcut moans of obtaining pro
for their fan
with no hope of better timer! un
til another year shall have p tss â¢>â¢ the
people of Southern Montert y and
Northern Pan Luis Obispo counties are
now face to face -with starvation. For
weeks they have struggled on. hoping
almost against hope that rains would
come and bring a change for the bet
ter, but now the situation has be
so grave that there is no longer â â 
fibility of self help, and. in dire want,
an appeal has been made to th<j
executive for assistance.
That, this appeal is timely and that
the aid ;â  :y there can be no
doubt. For almost two years no
have been raised on the farms, and the
hills and valleys have lain bleak and
bare entirely destitute of vegetation.
Salinas to Paso Robles the whole
country is destitute. In the off]
:"f John L. Matthews at Salinas
are dozens of letters from despairing
farm* !ing for aid in divers
ways. In all the general merchandise
stores In I c trict are pitiful
pleas for extension of credit, while
every one who enmes in from the back
distr s the same tale of desti
tution and want.
One by one the cattle of the poorer
farmers have dropped and died from j
ustion and starvation. Then the
horses followed,, until now the entire
np community is nereft of all
ki:. 'ls of livestock and famine has laid
Its gaunt fir -s on the wives and
children, who are fast succumbing to
th terrible situation.
Hollow-pyr-d women and children peer
out of the doorways at the passer as
if in the vain hope of obtaining some
thing to drive away the pangs of hun
ger that are rating out thoir lives.
Around Jolon and Lockwood th" con
dition is of the utmost gravity. The
wealthy people have reached the point
where they are doling out their
to their families as if to a shipwrecked
crew. What then must be the condi
tion of those who have been living from
hand to mouth for months? Their live
stock gone and their means .of support
entirely withdrawn, they have seen
their food suppl-- diminish day by day
until at last they have been compelled
to use the coarsest food that is :
to cattl* and in many families
made of water and shorts have been
the entire sustenance for weeks.
Three carloads of provisions have
been sent into the famine-stricken dis
trict by kind-hearted people who have
learned of the misery that exists, but
three carloads is but as a drop in a
bucket when the extreme destitution is
considered. Here in Kings City only
the echoes reach, but back in the foot
hills the stories are of such nature as
to appeal to the hardest heart. On the
big Milpitas rancho owned by Johnson
& Browne, and on the ?anch of A. M.
Xewhall, the cattle have reached such
a condition that they are dropping
dead all over the hills. Gangs of men
have been cutting down th" big live
oak trees, and the leaves serv^ to stay
the pangs of hunger for a while, but
within a week from now not a head
of cattle and only a. few of the best
horses will be found in a country 100
miles square. It is impossible to gather
what little stock is left on the ranges
and drive It into the home ranches, and
should it be driven ther- is not r-nough
to carry one further through the
winter.
While all classes are suffering, the
grf-at-'st destitution exists anwnsr the
renting farmers. These people have al
most given up the struggle and unless
aid soon reaches them they, like the
cattle, will lie down and die.
RELIEF COMMITTEE'S
SPLENDID WORK IN
PROVIDING FOOD
Several Carloads of Sepplies
Distributed Among Fami*
lies Sadly in Need.
SALINAS, Dec. 18.â During the early
portion of last July letters were re
ceived by W. J- Hill and others calling
attention to the awful state of affairs
In the southern portion of Monterey
and the northern part of San Luis Obis
po counties. A committee, consisting of
prominent attorneys, doctors and min
isters, was formed on July 28, and steps
taken to work on the suggestion of Dr.
Miller of San Lucas that something be
done and done promptly. Letters were
pent out, and Boon several carloads of
Fupplies were dispatched, and on Octo
ber 30 the committee reported it had
helped eleven families near San Lucas,
f'even near San Ardo, and twenty-six
around Bradley, Including 154 children.
The San Francisco Call
These families were recommended for
assistance by prominent citizens. The
supplies Included food, flour, beans and
clothing.
Again, on December 8, only eleven
days ago, the relief committee reported
having assisted families at Soledad, San
Lucas. San Ardo and Bradley. The re
port says supplies were distributed to
families, aggregating 54S persons, who
j were given 81 sacks Sour, 47 boxes ap
47 sides of bacon, 96 sacks of on
; ions, 62 sacks of beans, 54 pairs of shoes,
70 sacks of vege
tables. 142 packages of groceries, 36
sacks of prunes. 21 hats, 5 quilts and 92
sacks of | The report concludes
with tl â  tng statement:
As I Is of thai portion of Mon
terey County, we refer you to the fact
I was very light and a
limit- I Income to the farmers,
while tie crop of 1888 was a complete
failure. Their stock has been a burden to
tht->m, most of it having been driven to
.res outside the county. Should
come they will get relief in a
meas:. able to obtain more credit.
Most of the I: I cattle in that
r and it will be on.y under
the most favorable conditions that they
will live through the winter.
Letters bearing the indorsements of
prominent residents of Southern Mon
terey are being received daily from the
sufferers. They say their provisions
are all gone. They do not wish to live
on charity, but for their children's
sake they are forced to at present.
"In the i&mf vt God and humanity
help v â¢. exclaim.
Prominent people here of all classes,
t possibly a few who believe the
truth will hurt the county or their
business, say the reports are not half
as bad as the reality. One morning
journal denies the truth of the report
and berates the San Francisco papers.
It says if any one is Hying on shorts
and bran in that locality it is surely
from choice or for a gratification of the
pride that has prevented them making
known their destitution to the local
Supervisor or their more fortunate
neighbors.
A meeting of the relief committee will
be held to-morrow evening to devise
further means of succor. Merchants
Bay that owing to the widespread desti
tution their sales for Christmas are in
significant. One and all say the Board
of Supervisors and many generous
hearted private individuals have ren
dered a great deal of aid, but much
more is needed. The people in this
great, glorious Golden State must not
be permitted to starve.
HUNGRY BECAUSE
THEY PREFER IT,
SAYS BRUNNER
Banker Thinks the Starring
People Should Have Lo
cated Elsewhere.
The Germania Trust Company, of
which If. Brunner is cashier, has large
colony interests in the country adjacent
to southern Monterey County. Mr.
Brunner travels through that section
quite frequently and returned there
from yesterday afternoon.
"There is no question," said he, "that
there is privation and hunger among
the people in the Lockwood district.
However, I should say that all told
there are not over 200 who are in need
of outsid* assistance.
"In a great measure It is the fault of
these people that they arc in their pres
ent condition. The trouble is that they
went into a stock raising country and
settled on hilly land that is fit only for
grazing purposes and proposed to sup
port families on 160 acres of land. They
are not over-industrious and as they
depend on natural feed for dairying
they have been left without any re
sources whatever.
"The expenditure of a few hundred
dollars would provide the temporary
food requirements. There should be
beans, potatoes, flour and salt meats
Bent; also hay to keep the remaining
stock alive. This should be done right
away to prevent further suffering. In
this connection, however, I want to say
that this should not be done with the
idea of enabling these people to estab
lish homes in that part of the State
Such an effort is useless for the reason
that those lands are not calculated for
sirjiill holdings. And it is not right that
â¢ people, by reason of their bad
judgment and shiftlessness, should cir
culate the report that the industrious
farmer in California is starving to
death.
"It will be a highly proper act to send
food to them as soon as possible. Aside
from this the most charitable act that
can be done on behalf of these squat
ters is to give them transportation to
sections of the country where they will
have opportunities to obtain work and
support themselves and families. There
is no other sensible thing to do unless

REFUSED TO KISS THE
HERO OF THE MERRIMAC
Miss Douglass Quarrier of Louisville Would Not

Miss Quarrier Is the daughter of one of the highest offi

SIXTY MILLIONS TO BE SPENT
IN INCREASING THE NAVY
NEW YORK, Dec. 18.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald
says: Assurances have been
given to President McKinley and
Secretary of the Navy Long by
members of the Naval Committee of
Congress that the ship building pro
gramme which they recommend will be
adopted. This means that Congress
will pledge the Government to the ex
penditure of almost 560,000,000 for in
creasing the navy.
An immediate appropriation of such
a large sum will not, of course, be
necessary. It will be spread over a
period of at least four years. In the
forthcoming naval appropriation bill
the expenditure of only $10,000,000 to
$15,000,000 will be authorized.
It is proposed to distribute the money
among fifteen vessels, three of which
will be sea-going, sheathed, coppered,
battle ships of 13,500 tons, to have a
speed of about eighteen knots, if pos
sible; three sheathed and connered ar

city. His appearance in the theater was a signal frr a
storm of 'applause, which was continued between the acts,
until he consented to address ..he audience from the stage,
which he did. On his return to his box he was honored
with calls from various parties of young people present.
one. of which Miss Douglass Quarrier was a member.
It seems that at the instigation or suggestion o f one
of the young men in the party Lieutenant Htobson
made an attempt to emphasize his greeting to Miss Quar
rier by offering to kiss her, which very marked civility
she declined, and drawing promptly a y from him. left
the box. Occurring as it did in fuil view of the audience
the incident created a good deal of comment and some
laughter.
mored cruisers of about' 13,000 tons and
at least twenty-two knots speed; three
sheathed and coppered protected cruis
ers of 6000 tons; and six sheathed and
coppered cruisers of 2500 tons.
Strange as It may seem, some oppo
sition has developed from ship builders
of the country who may try to secure
a reduction of the number of ships au
thorized, or, if Congress be willing, to
obtain the authorization of fifteen
ships, contracts for a certain number
of which are to be placed yearly until
the entire programme has been exe
cuted.
The opposition of the ship-builders
arises from the fact that their plants
are not large enough to accommodate
the entire construction, especially when,
this Government already has under
way eight battle ships, four monitors,
one protected cruiser, sixteen torpedo
boat destroyers, twenty-two torpedo
boats, one training vessel for the naval
academy and one- submarine . torpedo" j
I boat, and is awaiting the close of nego
j tiations of the Anglo-American High
J Commission to place a contract with a
j lake. ship builder for the construction
of a gun boat. Apprehension is also felt
by the ship builders that Congress may
direct the construction of some of the
vessels at the navy yards, and this it is
desired to prevent if possible.
There is reason to believe, however,
that Secretary Long will seriously con
' sider the advisability of recommending
to Congress that three vessels, probably
of the 6000-ton class, be constructed in
Brooklyn. Norfolk and Mare Island
navy yards. Some of the officials of the
department believe it would be a part
I of wisdom to take such action, especi
ally in view of the alleged congestion of (
the ship-building yards. Other officials
! may oppose the proposition and point
to the difficulties of Government con
struction, as shown in the cases of ves
j Bels now in the service.
DEATH COMES IN
STRANGE GUISE TO
A YOUNG SOLDIER
Lockwood Josselyn Found Lying
Fully Dressed in a Bathtub
at His Home.
The Coroner Will Hold an Autopsy on the Body, fof
the Man's Relatives Believe Him the
.Victim of Foul Play.
MYSTERY shrouds the death of j
Lorkwood H. Josselyn, son .of Dr. '
Jospph'H. Josselyn. who -was found
in his bath tub yesterday morning
fully dressed "and with his military over
coat wrapped around him like a burial
robe. The relatives of the young man be
lieve he was' the victim of foul play,
and await with anxiety the result of the
autopsy which Coroner W. J. Hawkins
has ordered for this morning. Young Jos
selyn received a week's pay shortly after
midnight Saturday. "When found his
pockets had been emptied of their con
tents.
As far as known he was last seen alive
by his employer, A. \V. Furst of the Cine
ograph Parlor, Market street, opposite
Grant avenue. Mr. Furst paid off his em
ployes at the close of the day"s business,
and Josselyn was the last to go. He was
handed $S 50 in silver half dollars and was
asked to call at the office the following
afternoon to assist in mounting a skele
ton used in the exhibition. Before he left
the place he made an appointment with a
fellow employe to go driving- in the morn
ing. They separated and the friend called
for him at 8 o'clock, the appointed time.
He arrived to find him being lifted from
his bath tub, dead. "
The youngest sister of the dead man
walked into the bath room attached to
the rooms occupied by the Josselyn
family, 441 Geary street, and was starlted
to find her brother lying in the tub. His
military overcoat was tucked carefully
under the lower portion of his body. The
coat also covered his head, the sleeves
being tied in a knot at the back of the
head. The young woman summoned as
sistance and was joined by a brother and
sister. They first gave him a drink and
he opened his eyes partly. They then took
him to his bedroom across the hall and at
once summoned a physician. The physi
cian came but found the young man dead.
His relatives at once instituted an inquiry
to trace his movements from the time he
left his place of employment until he was
found in the bath tub, but they were
unable to do so. His money was all gone
and there were marks on the throat and
head that indicated a possibility of his

Strange Death Is to Be Investigated.
having been desrtt with in a violent man
ner.
He had seen his mother late on Satur
day and had told her he would have some
money for her that night, as it was pay
day. He had not been complaining of any
illness which would be likely to carry him
off so suddenly. To reach the bath room
he would, of necessity, have to pass his
own room, the door of which was always
unlocked. His sister, who says she is a
light sleeper, was in a room separated
from the bath room by only a thin parti
tion, and yet she did not hear him c-nter.
The family lives two flights up and one
has to make many turns to reach the
upper landing. The gas is turned off at
the meter by an economical landlord, so
that the dead man reached, or was taken
to the place at which he was found, in
Utter darkness.
Young Josselyn was a native of this
city and was entering upon his twenty
fourth year. He left here last May and
went to New York, where he enlisted in
the volunteer service. He was mustered
out of this and cast his lot with the regn

lars, being 1 attached to the Hospital Corp*
of the Second Division. Fourth Army-
Corps. He returned here on a furlough
md was to have joined his corps again
early in January. He gained some un
ipleasant notoriety in this city last Sep
tember, he being arrested at the in
stance of his wife, who charged him with
having first attempted to chloroform her
and then shot at her. The couple sepa
rated two years sine and wpre divorced
after the alleged ast-ault. The charges
against him were not pressf-d.
All indications are against the death of
the young man being from natural causes,
but it will require an autopsy this morn
ing to determine the exact cause. Owing
to the suspicions of his relatives. Coroner
Hawkins will not be satisfied Â» ntil he has
proved beyond a doubt what was respon
sible for his untimely death. Josselyn
wan nf a happy disposition and his rela
tives scoff at the idea of his taking his
own life. There were no signs of his
having been drinking, which makes it
doubly hard to explain the absence of his
money. Mr. Furst, his employer, speaks
kindly of him as being steady and sober
and a clever workman. He had taken a
liking to him and was to send him out on
the road with a cineograph show.
This may prove another tragedy which
will be added to the long list, the polic*
have been unable to solve in recent years.
REMARKABLE FEAT
OF BRIDGE MOVING
MILWAUKEE. Dec. IS.â A remarkabla
feat of bridge "moving was accomplished
to-day by the Chicago and Northwestern
Railway Company, under direction of J.
S. Robinson, division superintendent of
the engineers of that road. The bridga
was a single-track draw weighing: 215
tons and was removed a distance of 250
feet to a new foundation in the quick
time of two hours and fifty-five minutes.
The structure was floated on two scows,
one on either side of the center, which
were sunk with 90,000 gallons of water.
With the scows in proper position thÂ«
water was pumped out and the bridga
gradually lifted from its foundation, and
it was towed to its new resting place by
two tugs. The bridge had rendered ser
vice since ISBO and is still in good condi
tion, being removed to make way for a
double-track structure of the latest pat
tern.2

Whether it does or not a number of

early in January. Already there is talk
of the probability of disposing of the
treaty du^ng the preseni session, and
the Impression of a favorable result is
growing. A few Senators manifest a
disposition to debate the treaty at

opposition, but the feeling is so strong
against an extra 3sion and in favor of

of the disposition of the I'hiliu

the closest details of opposition as they
develop themselves, have taken the
pains to have enumerated the nan of

Senate, and they find that there are
fewer than 2000 of them, distributed
among the States as follows: Massa

Senator Morgan said to-day that he

The holiday recess by the terms of
the resolution reported by the Ways

the resolution will be amended so as to
make the recess begin Wednesday in

of 1500 or servo sixty days on the chain

Moore was hilariously intoxicated at

Moore is rvow on the chain-gang, -where he

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec. 17.âTele
graphic advices from Banks, Ala., tell of
a horrible crime at the Meyers planta
tion, near Josie Postoflice, eight miles
from Banks. Mrs. Ida Meyers, a wealthy
widow, and her daughter-in-law. Mrs. E.
Meyers, also a widow, conducted a store,
and It was known that they kept a large
1 amount of money in the dwelling across
the road from the store. A young man
Cook was employed to superintend the
farm and he occupied a room In the
â¢ house. Â . ,_. . ,
Some time between midnight and day
Cook was aroused by a noise in the room
lof the elder Mrs. Meyers. He sprang out
I of bed and ran to the door and saw Mrs.
! Meyers struggling with two strange men.
He" rushed to her assistance and was
knocked senseless with a club. When he
r< gained consciousness he found the house
on fire and the elder Mrs. Meyers appar- ;
ently dead on the floor.
Dragging her from the fire he went in
search of the younger Mrs. Meyers and
found her dead In her room, her brain
i having been beaten out. He rescued her
body just in time from the flames. He
then rang the farm bell and aroused the
neighbors,, who came in great numbers.
but were too late to save the house or
! any of its contents.
It is believed that the robbers obtained
about $3000 in cash. Evidently they
i thought they had killed all three persons
and fired the house to cover their crime.
i The condition of the elder Mrs. Meyers is
I critical.

"I had no idea that teuch a condi
tion existed, even in a small spot in
our State," said President Dohrmann of â

attention was called to the declaration j
of the Lockwood mass meeting. "If!

Colonel E. A. Denicke, president of

WASHINGTON, Dec. IS.-The Navy
Department to-day made public a re
port from Admiral Schley covering that
part of the operations and movements
of the flying squadron from its sailing
from Key West for Cienfuegos up jto
but not including the first bombard
ment. The report is as follows:
Flying Squadron, United States Flagship
Brooklyn, off Santiago de Cuba, May
Sir: 1 have the honor to report that
the squadron sailed from Key West on
the morning of the 19th Inst i<>r Clenfue

Hear Admiral Sampson. In company with
the flagship were the Massachusetts,
Texas and Scorpion. En rout^passed the
Marblehead, Nashville and Wasp, com

Off Cape Antonio communicated witti tne
Cincinnati and Vesuvius, scouting.
2 On the morning of the 2<l Inst the
squadron stood in for the entrance ot
Cienfuegos harbor to reconnolter and
later in the day passed the entrance twice

to believe that the Spanish squadron
might have arrived there, lhat day the

blockade of Cienfuegos be preserved and
the Scorpion be sent to communicate with
the Minneapolis and Harvard, off Santi

4 Also that on the 2:; d inst. the Hawk

Sampson, directing me to move eastward
with the Bquadron to Santiago, it satis
fled thai the enemy's vessels were nut in
Cienfuegos. Not being satisfied at this
time that they were not there, I held m>
position, being further strengthened in
my opinion by the fact thai 1 was m

Thursday preceding my arrival "ft â

Vixen and Eagle joined the squadron ana
the Marblehead and Eagle were immedi

to furnish them with ammunition cloth

squadron was not in Cienfuegos. Dis
patches were at once sent by the Dupont
to Admiral Sampson and to Commodore
Remey for the department, lndi<
that this squadron would move toward
Santiago de Cuba.
7 Great difficulty has been expert
in coaling the Texas on account of her
projecting sponsons, in any seaway what
ever and only under tae most favorable
conditions can she go alongside a collier.
In anything more unfavorable than ab
solutely smooth water there Is great dan

or the collier. In this connection the ad

y The run to Santiago was marked oy
rain and rough weather to such an extent
that the Eagle was unable to keep UP a
speed of 7.5 to 8.5 knots and fell behind so
much as to seriously delay the squadron,
which was forced to slow to a speed ol
from four to five knots for her to regain
and hold her position. As this rough head
sea continued with no apparent prospect of
abating and as the Eagle's coal supply
was becoming dangerously low, she was

[Â»d as a further embarrassment to the
squadron and a source of considerable
anxiety, as, with the weather conditions
that had prevailed since leaving Cienfue
gos it appeared absolutely necessary to
abandon the position off Santiago and
seek a place whero the vessels could be
coaled and the collier's machinery re
"iL Off Santiago the St. Paul, Yale and
Minneapolis were siehted and communi
cated with. The Minneapolis repotted
that sho only had sufficient coal to reach
bad condition. The coal supply of the
other two scouts was also much reduced.
Arrangements were at once made where
by the Yale was to tow the collier, and
ns the prospect did not seem favorable
for replenishing the meager coal supply
of the other vessels the squadron stood
to the westward, towing the collier. The
operation of taking the collior in tow
proved to be quite difficult, owing to the
-:â¢/â  and weight of the two ships and the
repeated parting of the tow lines. Finally
the collif-r's chain cable was got to the
Yale and the squadron proceeded. The
St. Paul was ordered to remain off San
tiago until her coal supply would no
longer permit of further delay.
12. After standing to the westward for
about three hours, or about twenty-live
miles, the conditions became less unfa
vorable and the squadron stopped. The
Texas and Marblehead were sent along
side the collier, whose injury had be< n
temporarily repaired, and coaled during
the night.

set sufficient coal into these vessels t

port we arrived about dusk. Established
an inner picket line, consisting of the
Vixen and Marblehead, the remainder of
the squadron lying off the entrance of
the port about four or five miles out.
18. The next morning, 29th inst., steamed
In to examine the entrance to the harbor
and sighted the Cristobal Colon, appar
ently moored head and stern across the
â western channel around Cay Smith, also
one of the vessels of the Vlzcaya or In
fanta Maria Theresa class, moored In the
eastern channel, and two small torpedo
boats. Later in the day made out the
military tops of a third vessel further up
the harbor.
10. A close blockade of the harbor has
been maintained and no vessels have en
tered or left since our arrival Yesterday
morning H. M. S. Indefatigable came up
to the line of blockade and made signal
"Request permission to communicate with
the commodore," which was of course
granted. A boarding officer came on board
the flagship with a letter from the com
manding officer, Captain L. A. Primrose,
requesting permission for his vessel to
pass the line of blockade in order to com
municate with Her Majesty's Consul at
this port. My reply was that there would
not be the slightest objection to his doing
so. Instead, however, of availing himself
of the permission, the Indefatigable
steamed off from the direction she came,
signaling "No harm done, courtesy." It
may have been that his learning that the
Spanish fleet was in port was of more
importance than Her Majesty's Consul,
and he may have desired first to com
municate with his Government from
Jamaica.
17. On the 30th Inst. the New Orleans ar
rived convoying the collier Sterling.
18. Concerning the coaling of a large
fleet of vessels, I would particularly call
the department's attention to the ne
cessity for heavy bags holding about 800
pounds in addition to buckets, which have
not proved of much use. They should
also be provided with at least six cotton
bales or heavy wooden camels six to eight
feet broad, to be used as fenders to take
the thrust of the ships and to permit coal
ing in rougher weather than is now possi
ble with the means at our disposal. At
present we are coaling on all favorable
occasions in plain sight of the enemy's
fleet. Very respectfully,
W. S. SCHLEY, Commodore, U. S. N.
Commander in Chief Flying Squadron.
RESCUED FROM A
DISABLED SCHOONER
Eight Men and Two Women TakeD
From the Deer Hill by a
Eritish Steamer.
NEW YORK, Dec. 18.â The British
steamer Pawnee, which arrived to-day
from Mediterranean ports, brought ten
ijhi [i wrecked people, eight men and two
women, who were taken from the disabled
scnooner Deer Hill of St. John, N. 8., in
mklocean. Captain Aikenhead reported
that on the morning of December 8 he
sighted the Deer Hill in evident distress
and needing assistance. A heavy north
west sale was blowing and a dangerous
sea was running. The schooner was seem
ingly unmanageable and the rudder dis
abled or carried away. The Pawnee stood
by and at 2 p. m. succeeded in getting a
towline aboard, which had been sent by
drifting a small line to leeward. Ihe line
parted, however, and a boat was launched
in charge of the chief officer and sent to
communicate with the Deer Hill. The
boat had nearly succeeded in boarding the
wreck when an enormous sea struck and
Btove it. and after great difficulty the
boat crew succeeded in sotting on board
the schooner, where they were obliged to
remain all night. On the following morn
ing (Oth) the weather slightly moderate,].
a tow line was sent on board and the
Pawnee towed the Deer Hill toward Ber
muda. After towing about six hours the
line again parted. The wind and sea was
Increasing when the line parted and it
was found impossible to get out another.
The captain of the Deer Hill signaled that
he Wished to abandon the wreck, and re
quested the Pawnee to stand by. The gale
continued throughout the 9th. 10th and
11th, the Pawnee keeping her position
near the wreck, but found it impossible to
use the boats to remove the unfortunate
people from the Deer Sill, owing to the
dangerous character of the seas. Finally
at 7 p. m. on the 12th the rescue was ef
fected and the Doer Hill was abandoned
in latitude 30:45, longitude r.2.40. The res
cued people were Captain C. w. Burns,
Lroulsa Burns, his daughter: Hazel Mer
ritt, the owner's daughter and seven of
the crew of the Deer Hill.

TWO FIREMEN
CHARGED WITH
LOOTING RUINS
Sensational Arrests at
Fresno.
THIEVES CAUGHT IN THE ACT
SALVAGE STOLEN FROM BURNED
STORES.
Charles Bach, Assistant Chief of the
Fire Department, One
of the Accused
Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Dec. IS.â Charles Bach and
Charles Reed, prominent members of
the Fresno Volunteer Fire Department,
were arrested this morning, charged
I with having looted the ruins of the
I White Front stores, which were burned
on Friday night.
After several fires recently the pro
prietors of the burned property have
j complained to the police that articles
jof value were stolen. During the fire
| in Holland & Holland's grocery store,
two weeks ago, the till was robbed, and
several articles of value were stolen.
At the fire in Sughira & Co.'s Japanese
fancy goods store a week ago, the till
was robbed, and when McVey's furni
ture store was burned two weeks ago a
large quantity of goods were stolen.
Last night police officers were on
watch in the alley in the rear of the
White Front stores. At about 1 o'clock
this morning Fireman Charles Reed
I was seen emerging from the ruins with
I a bundle of burned silks, handkerchiefs,
! etc. The officers gave chase, whereupon
I the plunder was dropped. Reed was
finally run down and captured.
Charles Bach, assistant chief of the
Fire Department, who had been placed
' on the burned premises to guard the
: damaged stock, was seen taking num
i erous articles of dry goods to his bar
ber shoy, which adjoins the White
; Front stores. J. Bennett, a drayman,
: and Milton Hutchinson, an escape from
! Whittier, are also in jail, charged with
i looting the ruins.
Bach was released this evening on
\ $1000 bail.
Hutchinson probably will be sent
back to Whittier, as he has four years
yet to serve.

Jesus del Monte â Cubans Cause
Serious Biots.
HAVANA, Dec. 18.â The Spanish evac
uation commissioners informed the Amer
ican commissioners this evening that the
Havana suburbs of Carro and Jesus del
Monte had been evacuated. The Spanish
troops left Jesus del Monte at 5 o'clock
this evening, immediately afUT which
American and Cuban flags were raised,
crackers were fired and the usual dem
onstrations made by the large crowds
in honor of the event. At the hour of
filing this dispatch, 8 p. m., it is reported
that some of the troops of the Cuban gen
eraJ, Mario Menocal. entered Jesus del
Monte. Probably the United States forces
will be sent there to-morrow.
The suburb of Carro was evacuated yes
terday. American and Cuban Hags were
displayed from the houses on Calzada del
c.rru'and crowds rushed through the
streets shouting: "Viva Cuba libre!"
About 5:30 o'clock last evening a crowd
of Cubans of the lower class passed a
barracks of engineers on the Infanta avu
nue shouting "Long live Cuba!" and
"Death to Spain!" and firing shots into
the air in celebration of the evacuation of
Cerro. The < â â¢ngineers did not fire, but the
guard was doubled.
The crowd then passed on from the Cal
zada del Monte to the Calzada del Cerro,
stopping the street cars and compelling
ngors to shout "Viva Cuba Libre."
Among the demonstrators were a number
of butchers who carried pistols and
knives. Jose Gancedo and his brother
Teodoro Huortia, who were in the cars,
wore wounded with knives. Gancedo died
to-day and Huertia will probably die.
Later the crowd met some engineers at
the Esquina de Tejas and fired upon them,
seriously wounding one. The engineers
returned the firo. wounding a street car
conductor, a civilian, Isador Basolas, and
John Leonard, a colored man. The riot
ing continued, many shots being flrod in
front of the Casa do Socorro, where the
wounded were assisted.
Spanish soldiers were ordered to tne
scene and arrived about 9 o'clock. Whiie
inarching through Corro they were tired
upon by men concealed behind pillars. Une
Spanish private fell, wounded, and the
battalion fired into the air to scare the
rioters. On resuming their march they
were again fired upon and another man
! was hit. The Spaniards then fired and dis-
I porsed the .rioters.
Among the wounded was a colored
woman, and it fs also reported that there
â¢vv. r.- several others. The rioting caused
i great alarm in Cerro and along the Cal
zada del Monte, where all houses have
j kept closed doors since last night.

GENERAL BROOKE SICK
ABED WITH FEVER
Broken Down by Hard Work, He
Must Rest Before Going to
Havana.
NEW YORK, Dec. 18.â A Savannah.
Ga., special to the Herald says: Gen
eral John R. Brooke, Military Governor
of Cuba, is here in the Desoto Hotel
sick abed with fever. Accompanied by
four members of his staff, he arrived
last night and went right to the hotel.
He is accompanied by Mrs. Brooke.
Brooke got his appointment on Friday,
and though he wanted to see the Presi
dent before going to Havana, he was
prevented doing so, as the President
was on his Southern trip. He started
therefore for his new post. President
McKinley happened to be in Savannah
to-day. General Brooke saw him here.
It is said General Brooke is broken
down as a result of recent labors, and
his sickness Is due to that fact. He
will remain until the latter part of the
week, when, if sufficiently recovered,
he will proceed to Havana.
ATTEMPT OF CADETS TO
KILL THEIR COMMANDER
Major Jones Has a Close Call From a
Musket Bullet in xtis
Office.
LEXINGTON. Ky., Dec. IS.â Rebellious
cadets at the State College here to-night
attempted to assassinate the commander,
Major M. B. Jones. When Major Jones
opened the door to his office he waa
startled by a loud explosion, and upon
examination found that a musket had
been so adjusted in a far corner of the
room that the trigger was pulled when J
the office door opened. The bullet missed
the major, but struck a door panel ami
glanced backward, entering the wall near
one of the hinges. Major Jones was so
startled that he did not regain control of
himself before the office was filled with
students. The guilty cadets have not
been found. The major to-night says it
was only a college prank and amounts to
nothing.
The college is furnished a commander
by the United States army, but after the
war was declared Major Sam Swlgert was
forced to return to his post of duty and
Major Jones was appointed to act in his
absence. Major Jones is unpopular and
a number of less serious tricks have been
played on him during the past few weeks.
The faculty of the college voted a salary
for commissioned officers of cadets recent

fled the privates.
FARRAGUTS DEFEAT RELIANCE.
Vallejo Football Team Shuts Out the
Men From Oakland.
VALLEJO, Dec. IS.--The football game
here to-day between the Farraguts of
Vallejo and the Reliance of Oakland re
sulted in a victory for the home team by
the score of 15 to 0. The Farraguts were
on their mettle and played the best game
since they were organized. McGuire, the
big fullback, was the star of the game,
and his hurricane work won rounds of
applause.
Reliance had the kick-off, and the Far
raguts secured the ball, but one yard
from their goal. They carried it across
the field and scored without losing the
pigskin. Reliance kicked off again, and
Farragut scored the second touchdown
without Reliance having the ball. Captain
McEnerny then began, open plays, the
half ending without further scoring.
Jn the second half Farragut scored one
touchdown, the visitors failing to have
a chance to score. McGuire's ankle was in
bad shape, and he failed on all his tries
at goal. For the visitors Delicon, Platt
and I'rick played hard football, but their
team was overmatched.
The Farraguts will play the Olympics
on January 1.
SUISUN, Dec. 18.â The Chilcoots of Be
nicia were defeated in a football game
hero to-day by Suisun Valley by a score
of 24 to 0.

Steamers Released From the Ice in
Detroit River.
DETROIT, Mich., Dec. 18.â Aided by a
northwest wind and the mild weather of
the past two days most of the imprisoned
steamships at the mouth of the Detroit
River were to-day released by the tugs
and the ferry steamships. To-morrow
morning fourteen more steamships will
leave here for the blockade to attempt to
force it. If the fleet to-morrow meets
with as good success as it did to-day and
breaks through the ice it will leave but
three freighters still stuck.

TO BLOCK THE
LEGISLATURE
State Printing Office to Be Used
to Prolong the Senatorial
Fight.
Plot of Politicians to Checkmate the Board
of Examiners and Clog Organization
of the Incoming State Gov
ernment.
The Legislature is threatened at its ap
proaching session with a serious complica
tion that is without precedent in the his
tory of the State. There are grave fears
that the organization of the Assembly
and the Senate will bo delayed for at
ten days after the day set by law. It is
known that certain prominent m^mbt-rn
of the uppper House are encouraging this
threatenend delay In order that they may
succeed in certain schemes in reference
to the United States Senatorial election.
The business of the Legislature is to be
d( laved, the wishes of State officers, who
desire to expedite official business are to
be opposed and the people of California
are to be burdened with thousands of dol
lars of useless expense in order that a few
politicians, whom chance has made
legislators, shall exercise the unwarranted
power to do a little petty poHti< s.
This official and unexpected dilemma
\risen over the closing of the State
Printing Office. It should not be under
d however, that either Siate Printer
A. J. Johnston, or Governor Budd is ever,
countenancing the plot that Is on foot to
paralyze the energies of the Legislature
and make the State government ridicu-
In the eyes of its people. When the
true condition of affairs was discovered,
Governor Budd and State Printer John
buried whatever personal quarrel
may have had, forgot their political
:â  nces and as public officersâ ore a
crat and the other a Republicanâ
fht to save the State government from
redicament into which It has been
;
Because the State Printing Office is
closed the Legislature of this State can
not be rmally organized. The lav pro
vides that certain preliminary printed
matter must be supplied to both houses
before they can attempt the orderly trans
action of official business. There must. In
the nrst place, be printed roll calls.
Bills must be printed. or they
cannot legally b< considered. Re
ports must be furnished in print
ed form. Messages and official docu
ments must be sent to the Governor tn the
came shape prescribed by laV. The print
ing office is at the opening of the Legis
lature a most essential adjunct, uut the
State Printing Office is closed.
This is the dilemma that faces the I.eg- j
i.a'tature, and it is the condition *>t affairs j
Hr which a few politicians are taking .id
vantage in order that the organization of j
the Legislature may be delayed, and with j
it the election of a United States Senator.
It la not necessary to be explicit in telling
why certain members of the Legislature
seek to postpone the election of a Federal
Senator. The longer such a contest is on
at icramento the better certain legisia
tors are pleased. The affair in this as
pect has created a great deal of comment.
A few â¢ys ago it was seen that some
thing must be done at oncu or State busi
ness would be paralyzed. It was argued
that an appropriation could be ordered
after the Legislature organized, but there
is doubt that even this can be done, as an
appropriation bill must be printed.
Friends of both administrations inter
vened to see what possibly could be done.
The merits of Governor Budd' 8 action in
closing the State printing office by cutting
off the entire appropriation were not dis
cussed, as they were not pertinent.
Those who sought to secure a confer
ence between Governor Budd and State
Printer Johnston were interested only In
expediting public business and saving the
State from ridicule and expense. After
some discussion Governor Budd and State
Printer Johnston agreed to mccl and
consider the situation. They both neces
sarily were of the opinion that the State
Office must be opened at least ten
days before the opening of the Legis
lature or organization could not formally
be made. If this were not done the busi
ness of the Legislature would be delayed
unnecessarily for ten days.
Under these circumstances Governor
Budd agreed to audit, as Governor and aa
a member of the State Board of Examin
ers all bills necessary for the printing of
caDers and documents needed in the or
ganization of the Legislature. State
Printer Johnston promised to open the
State Printing Office and to order Uie
printing of certain material that was to
bTKfated in a bill of items. With that
understanding the conference closed. It
was understood as a matter of course
that the indorsement of the entire Board
of Examiners should be obtained to this
P Â°Under the State laws, it is claimed, the
c tn tc Board of Examiners has no ngnt
to audit a deficiency bill where no original
appropriation has been made and demand
the State Legislatur.- to sanction it and
order the money paid. The Legislature
has full discretion, however and even
without the indorsement of the Board of
Fxaminers could order the money paid.
In this instance, where the expense was
to be incurred solely for the benent ol the
I ecislature. to expedite its business, give
rfienlty to Its organization and effect to
ir<? actions, every one interested agreed
that the demand of the State Printer
would be adopted promptly by the Legis
lai" |s absolutely necessary that the work
muÂ«t be done and it is a matter of the
worst public policy to have it done at a
time when public business will be delayed.
Since it must be done it is argued that it
should be done now. These arguments
fell on deaf ears when they were made to
certain members of the Legislature who
see rsonal advantage in a long contest
for the United States Senate.
After the conference between the Gov
ernor, the State Printer and friends of
both was over the indorsement of the re
maining members of the Board of Exam
iners was sought. Secretary of State
ouls H. Brown, recognizing the neces
sity of immediate action, at once promised
to "audit the demand of the State Printer.
It was seen that it is imperative to have
printed the reports of the State Controller,
the Board of Examiners, the State Treas
urer and the State Board of Prison Direc
tors These documents, with the mes
sages of Governor Budd and of Governor
elect Gage, must in printed form be sub
mitted to the consideration of the Legisla
ture For these reasons, so imperative
from the point of view of public policy,
Secretary of State Brown signed an order
authorizing the State Printer to proceed
at once to the printing of the necessary
papers, reports, documents and messages.
The third member of the Board of Ex
aminers, Attorney General W. F. Fitzger
ald was also seen. He at once signed the
order giving the State Printer the au
thority of the Board of Examiners to pro
ceed Governor Budd, as Governor and as
a member of the Board of Examiners, also
affixed his signature, and it seemed as if
State Printer Johnston needed nothing
further in the way of official indorsement
for the necessary work. ,
In order that there might be no mis
take in the matter the State Printer, the
Governor and his associates in the Board
of Examiners agreed upon the documents
that were to be printed. The list included
about 150 items, each one of which was
ordered by the examiners to be printed.
In the list as originally arranged, the re
port of the Prison Directors was omitted
and the report of the Senatorial Commit
tee on the Harbor Commission was in
eerted. This arrangement .was reversed.
I The Senatorial report was omitted and i
that of the Prison Directors inserted.
With this arrangement State Printer
; Johnston professed to be perfectly satis- :
! tied. He had held out until the signature !
of Attorney General Fitzgerald had been
obtained and the indorsement of the com
â  plete Board of Examiners was at his com
mand. When the Attorney General signed
: the order there appeared to be nothing
! more than to open the State Printing
Office. But Mr. Johnston balked.
He wa? i: t satl Â»fl d with his own agree
ment and sought the advice of outside at
t torneysâ Devlin & Devlin. These attorneys
, gave the State Printer a long opinion, in
' which they assured him that the State
1 Legislature had full power to pay the ex
'â¢ pense that he would Incur in opening the
j State Printing Office at this time and
' printing the documents that are an abso
j lute necessity to the organization of the
i Senate and the Assembly and the conduct
|of public business. More than that. Mr.
j Johnston was assured by his private at
i torneys that there Is a moral obligation
I on the part of the Legislature to pay the
j money he would expend. In a printed
j opinion, submitted by Devlin & Devlin, to
the State Printer, the attorneys say: "We
have no doubt but if the Legislature
should appropriate money to pay an in
; debtedness created by the Board of Ex
aminers the appropriation would stand
j and be valid."
With this opinion to support himâ with
I the Governor, the Secretary of State and
i the Attorney General to authorize him.
! and with a clear understanding that ac
i tlon is a matter of good public policy â Mr.
j Johnston refuses to act. In order that
i there might be no misunderstanding State
j Printer Johnston received the following
: official letter from the Secretary of the
| State Board of Examiners:
j A. J. Johnston. State Printer: The author
! ization to open the State Printing Office was
'â¢ plven to facilitate the work of the eg stature,
i and the Fame could be paid for legally by an
| appropriation of the Legislature, as stated by
j your attorneys, Devlin & Devlin. Â«'
If, under the circumst you decline to
i perform the work, aftt-r authorization by this
! board, that is a matter which r--stÂ¥ entirely
! with you. EPH GORMAN.
retary of the State Board oi Examiners.
But still Mr.- Johnston refuses to open
| the ate Printing Office, and he givs his
j reason. He declares that certain promi
| nent members of the incoming Legisla
; W.re have told him that they will not ,l
low the expense that will be Incurred.
Their reason for retarding public business
! and bringing discredit upon themselves
j s nil their party is that they may reap
I whatever advantage there may be In a
f prolonged contest for United States Sena
tor. It is an old trick of dishonest legis
j lators to extend such a contest as long as
I possible. There are financial and other
| reasons for this action, but it is seldom
j that even petty politicians will place
j themselves and their honor so conspicu
| ously on the auction block. The busi
j ness community of this State has never
taken kindly to the length of legislaive
#eÂ«=slons. Business men and merchants
have always been restless in anticipation
of the biennial meeting at Sacramento.
This unrest has changed to disguest. now
that it is shamelessly proclaimed that cer
; tain legislators intend even to clog the
i machinery of government to attain ihe.r
dishonest tnos.
HAMILTON LEWIS
DECLARES FOR PROGRESS
The Washington Congressman Does
Not Join Democrats Who Op
pose Expansion.
CHICAGO. Dec. IS.â "The Democratic
party must be a progressive party, and
not a party of mere obstruction, if it
would retain the confidence of the peo
ple of this country," said Congressman
James Hamilton Lewis of Washington
at the Auditorium Annex to-day. To
gether with Mrs. Lewis the Congress
man is on his way to Washington.
"I am a Democrat," he continued,
"but I do not feel I can act with my
party if it places itself in opposition
to the policy of expansion on which the
country has embarked. But I do not
believe a majority of the Democratic
members of the House can be whipped
into line to oppose this policy.
"The $20,000,000 payment clause in the
peace treaty I do not favor, but I do
not consider that sufficient reason for
opposing th^ whole instrument, which
I believe will be ratified."

SAVANNAH, Ga., Dec. Notwith
standing this was supposed to be a day \
of rest with the Presidential party, it
was, as a matter of fact, filled with ln
i terest and activity. The day was an \
! ideal one.
Though they had sat late to the ban- j
quet last night â it was near 2 o'clock
when General Wheeler delivered his de
lightful peroration to "Woman"â the ;
j President and accompanying members
,of his Cabinet arose to breakfast at
about the usual hour, and later they
separated to attend divine services.
President McKinley attended church
at the Wesley Monumental Methodist
\ Church. Mrs. McKinley did not ac
company him. She is suffering: from a
' slight cold -tnd remained in the hotel. !
I Her indisposition, however, does not
amount to real illness and this after- j
noon she was able to taKe a carriage j
ride about the city.
The President was met at the door of
i the church by leading members of the
congregation, who escorted him to the
â  pew reserved for him. As he entered
the congregation arose and remained
standing until he had taken his seat.
The sermon was by Rev. John A.
Thompson, D.D. There was no refer
ence to the distinguished presence
ing the service, beyonu an invocation
by the preacher for divine guidance
I for the President during the crisis
| which now confronted the country.
| Secretary Alger and General Shafter
attended the First Presbyterian
Church, and after the service held an
informal levee in the aisles, many oer
sons crowding around them to shake
hands and bid them welcome.
General Joseph Wheeler and Secre
tary Wilson attended the First Bap
tist Church. After the service they
shook hands with several hundred per
sons.
Secretary Long attended St. John's
Episcopal Church, and Secretary Smith

After dinner the President visited the :
! Georgia Agricultural Medical Collece
J (colored), where he delivered an ad- .
dress. The route to the college took
the President through the camp of the
Seventh Army Corps and, going: and )
coming, he stopped at the camp for a i
brief inspection and to speak words of
appreciation and encouragement to the
men. Secretary Alger and General
Shafter also visited the camps.
Secretary Alger paid more attention ;
' to the camp than any other member of
the party. He went through several
of the regimental villages from head
' quarters to kitchens and made a crlt- |
ical examination. He also visited the
hospital of the First Division, where
he spoke kindly to the sick men and i
made inquiries into their wants and
how they were supplied. After his trip
he expressed himself as very much j
gratified with the camp and the work i
i of the State hospital corps.
Postmaster General Smith. General

M'KINLEY HAS WON
ALL SOUTHERN HEARTS
of the President and his party to
Savannah ended to-night after two
days 01 remarkable displays of en
thusiasm. Although to-day was sup
posed to be a day of rest, the I 1I 1
dent attended two public functions and
received ovations. But far above the
importance of the receptions to-day
and the receptions already reported is
the fact that the original object of
President McKlnley*s visit has been en
tirely lust sight of. The unprecedented
outbursts of loyalty to the Union have
completely overshadowed the reioicine
over the peace with Spain, though par
ticipation in the latter was the avowed
object of the President's Southern trip.
To thoroughly explain what is going
on in the South to-day, it is necessary
to not only record the continuous en
thusiasm and hospitable receptions, but
also to recount the causes that have
made the trip so remarkable. In all
the speeches and in all the demonstra
tions which have marked the Presi
dent's visit to Atlanta, Tuskegee. Mont
gomery and Savannah, there has been
the tacit admission that the war with
Spain was the great factor in achiev
ing the result, but it is to the result and
not to the factor that the chief trend
of speech-making and of enthusiasm
has lent itself. Political influences seem
to play no part In the reception of
President McKinley. On all sides there
is an eagerness to publicly express the
loyalty of the Southern States and to
admit that the war with Spain not
only helped to weld the compact of the
sections, but gave to the South the
opportunity to express sentiments of
loyalty that have long lived, but which
have lacked opportunity of expression,
and this has been done chiefly by Dem
ocrats, most of whom fought for the
starÃ and bars, and to all of whom the
name of Davis Is a sacred memory.
The frank references -to -and the dis
cusslon of the civil war have led to
many delicate situations that were only
saved from becoming irritating dilem
mas by the tact of a President who
fought against Southern troops, or by
the graceful utterances of the Confed
erate who years ago opposed him on
the battlefield. The marvelous scenes
of an audience In the old Confederate
capital cheering the atara and stripes
until they grew hoarse, of Confederate ]
veterans struggling to grasp the hand [
of a Northern Republican President: of j
General Wheeler leading the people of
his State in cheers for William Mc-
Kinley in the place where Jefferson
Davis once urged the South to fleht
for separation, are all redeemed from
the suspicion of fulsomeness or the
faint praise of politicians by the blunt
truthfulness of the men who led in
these new and tremendously fervent
declarations of loyalty. Governor John
ston of Alabama said at Montgomery:
"We of the South have nothing to re
gret, except our dead," but he at once
' went on to say that he rejoiced in the
United States. With a strong accent ;
| on "United."' and if any man now said. '<
| "'ls Alabama loyal to the Union?" he j
asked an absurd question, because Ala
bama's loyalty had been proven by i
, Wheeler and Hobson, and there wer* ;
' hundreds of other Wheelers and Hob- :
: sons in Alabama ready to give eaual ;
I proof of Alabama's glad fealty to the
Union. â  I
Such utterances as these have marked .
the trip with more frequency than it
has been possible to report. On the i
part of the former Confederates who
have made addresses of welcome to j
President McKinley there has been no
eleventh hour confession of sin. In j
substance they have all said that they
fought for what they then thought was
! right; that they neither blame them
selves nor their dead fathers or sons
for enlisting in the cause of the Con
federacy; but that they accept to-day;
i the changed conditions with a gladness ;
I and sincerity they never felt until the [
war with Spain knit the nation into a
common cause and. until a Republican;
i President urged the people of the North ;
! and South to honor the Confederate .
, dead. In the latter reason lies the main
incentive to the intense and almost un- |
expected enthusiasm with which the
Presidential party had been greeted j
i since Mr. McKinley"? first speech in At- j
lanta. Scarcely a speaker or a paper
In Alabama or Georgia has made refer- j
ence to the President without mention- !
ing on every occasion his tribute to the j
' Confederate dead. A distinguished
; Southerner said to a correspondent:
"There have been many reunions of i
i North and South on paper and in ;
i speeches. These were well meant, but
they signified little, because neither
side had given in to the other on the
principles that they fought over. This
suggestion of the President to care for
our dead is the first practicable evl- j
dence given to the South that the
North really means what it says, and
It has touched our hearts more than i
we can say. Coming as it does upon
the heels of tlu> war with Spain, which
' gave to the South the chance to prove
her loyalty, this utterance of the Presi
dent enables us to say not only that wo
: are true to the Union, but for the first
time that we love it."
This utterance represents a host of
public and private speeches that have
; been made since the arrival of the
Presidential party in th>> South. It is
thÂ»- consensus of various opinions ex
pressed to the correspondent by State
officers and citizens of Georgia and
'. Alabama, nearly all of whom are op
i to the President in politics, but
who have ed him right gladly
in his capacity of chief executive and
who have given vent to wild enthusi
asm over his : regarding the
Confederate dead. In 'his way what
was planned to be ;< celebration of the
i peace with Spain has become almost
entirely a genuine practical ratification
' of the peace between North and South.
I epoch-making in its significance, thrill
: ing in its details and pathetic in the
countless memories that it awakens.
THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS
TO THE COLORED PEOPLE
SAVANNAH. Ga., Dec. IS.â The feat
ure of the President's day was his visit
to Georgia Agricultural and Mechanical
College. This is an institution for col
ored persons supported by the State of
| Georgia. Its president is R. R. Wright,
colored, who was recently appointed by
President McKinley as a paymaster in
the volunteer army, with the rank of
major, but who has resigned and re
turned to the school. There were no
elaborate exercises connected with of
r, but who has resigned and re
d to the school. There were no
rate exercises connected with his
visit. The pupils were gathered in the
chapel. Mr. McKinley was introduced
by the president of the college. He
j said:
"Fellow citizens: I have beÂ«n profoundly
â  impressed with this scene and 1 have been
deeply touched with the eloquent words
and the exalted sentiments which have j
been uttered by the gentleman whom you
delegated to speak in your behalf. It
gives me cullar pleasure to meet you i
and to greet y ou in -this institution of
learning presided over by one whom I
have known for more than twenty years i
' and whom I have come to admire and re
spect as one of the splendid leaders of
your race. I congratulate him and all as
sociated with him in the good work done
here for the exaltation of your race. I
congratulate all of you upon the splendid ]
advance made by you in the last third of
a century. You are all entitled to praise
and to high commendation, which I am
sure you receive from your white !
fellow citizens in this and every part |
of the country. i congratulate you upon i
your acquirement of property. Many of â 
: your race have large properties on the
tax lists in the several States, and in that |
way contribute proportionately to the I
support of the Government. 1 congratu- !
late you upon what you have done in |
learning and the acquirement of useful â 
> knowledge, on the fact that there is not i
i a foot of ground beneath the ria.g of Stars |
and Stripes where every boy and girl, \
white or black, cannot have an education !
1 to tit them for the battle of life. Keep on
is the word I would leave with you to
day. Keep on in the efforts upward, but
remember that in acquiring knowledge
'â¢ there Is one thing as important as that,
and that is character. Nothing in the
i whole wide world Is worth so much, will
last so long and serve Its purpose so well
>as good character. It Is something that i
! no one can take from you, that no one can I
give to you. You must acquire it for j
yourself.
"There Is another thing. Do not forget
j the home. The home is the foundation of
good individual life and organized govern
ment. Cultivate good homes, make them
pure and sweet, elevate them and other
good things will follow. I congratulate
you that this institution is not only look
ing after the head, but after the hand. I
congratulate you that -it is not only mak
ing orators, but good mechanics. It is
better to b*e a skilled mechanic than a
poor orator or an indifferent preacher.
(Great applause.) In a word, each of you
must want to be the best in whatever
you undertake. Nothing in the world
commands more respect than skill and
industry. Every avenue is open to It.
"I congratulate you upon the splendid
valor of your race. My friend, the Presi
dent, has made an allusion in his speech
to what many years ago I said in a pub
lic address. I told of a white colonel who
had delivered the flag of our country to
his black color sergeant and said to hinv
'Sergeant, I place in your hands this
sacred flag. Fight for It; yes, die for it;
but never surrender it to the hands of an
enemy.' That black soldier, with love
of country and pride In his heart, an
swered: 'I will bring the flag back, col
onel, in honor, or report to God the reason
why.' In one battle, in carrying that flag
of freedom, he was stricken down. He
fell with the folds of that flag wrapped
about him. bathed in his blood. He did
not bring it back, but God knew the rea
son why. He did all he could, all any
man could do. He gave his heart's blood
for that flag. At San Juan Hill and at
El Caneyâ but General Wheeler is here.
(Great applause.) I know he can is here,
â¢eat applause.) I know he can tell you
better than I can of the splendid heroism
of the black regiments which fought side
by side with the white troops on that
historic field. Mr. Lincoln was not far
from right when, speaking of the black
men, he said: 'The time will come when
they will help to keep the jewel of liberty
in the hands of the human race," and in
a i third of the century since â  you \ have
helped to give liberty in Cuba .to an. op-
jpepple.. I leave yritb. you this one
â¢word, 'keep on.' You will solve your
own problem. Be patient. Be progressive.
Be honest. Be God-fearing and you will
win, lor no effort falls that has a stout,
honest, earnest heart behind it.
At the conclusion of the President's
speech "America" was sung by all
present, with possibly more vigor and
spirit than harmony. General Joseph
Wheeler was introduced as "the hero
of Santiago." He was given an ova
tion which lasted for several minutes.
He spoke briefly of the hope and glory
of the country and of the efforts which
were being made by both white and
colored people to secure educations.
After General Wheeler's speech he was
applauded for several minutes.
Secretary Gage also spoke. He said
that he had not fully realized until this
trip South that there was any such
thing as a negro problem, and that it
was of such widespread proportions.
What he had seen, however, had opened
his eyes. There was such a problem,
and it was a very serious one. How
ever, the information derived by him at
Tuskegee and at the school which he
was addressing has led him to believe
the true solution of' the problem has
been found, and that it lay in the in
dustrial education of the colored youth.
on plans that were being worked out at
the institutions named.
Returning from the college. the
Presidential party passed through the
camp of the Indiana regiment, which
is to embark for Cuba on the transport
Minnewaska to-morrow mornin^. The
President graciously wished the offi
cers and men godspeed and a safe re
turn.
SHAFTER EVIDENTLY
DOESN'T LIKE CUBANS
SAVANNAH, Ga., Deo. 18.â At the
collation of the officers of the Third
Georgia Regiment to Postmaster Gen
eral Smith and the newspaper corre
spondents this afternoon General Shaf
ter had some interesting things to say
about Cuba and the Cubans. He did
not make a speech, but in a conversa
tional way expressed himself, his re
marks being nominally addressed to
Colonel Berner of the Georgians,
though they were intended fur the
whole assemblage.
"It seems to me," said General Shaf
ter, "that a great many persons have
an erroneous idea respecting our rela
tions with the Cubans. As 1 view it
we have taken Spain's war upon our
selves. We shall in all probability hear
a good deal more of the 'insurgents.' "
"How about self-government for the
Cubans?" General Shatter was asked.
"Self government," the general re
peated. "Why, those people are no
more fit for self-government than gun
powder is for hell."
In the same line General Shafter went
on to tell why the United States, in
his opinion, would be obliged to remain
in the island for some time and govern
the territory by military force.

A DISTINGUISHED
THEOLOGIAN DEAD
REV. W. H. PLATT SUCCUMBS TO
KIDNEY TROUBLES.
Short Sketch of a Busy Life Well
Spent â Some Important Publi
cations That Won Him
Fame. '
Horace G. Platt, the distinguished at
torney of this city, was yesterday ap
prised of the death of his father. Rev.
\V. H. Platt, who passed away in his
country home at Petersburg, Va. Death
was the result of kidney trouble, but the
famous theologian's end was hastened by
the sudden taking off of his wife three
weeks ago.
The news of his father's demise has
been a severe one to Mr. Platt and his
brothers, occurring, as it did, so soon
after the death of their mother. Dr. i
Platfs last hours were comforted by the
presence of two of his children, E. C.
Piatt, treasurer of the Postal Telegraph
Company, and Mrs. a. w. Kent of New
; York, who was formerly Miss Nina Platt
lof this city, a reigning belle. Besides the
three children already mentioned, Dr.
Platt leaves two more to survive him.
They are John M. Platt. treasurer of the
California Wine Association, and Charles
W. Platt, who is connected with Wells,
i Fargo & Co.'s Bank.
The deceased was known personally and
! by reputation in this State and through
i out the East. He was at one time a res
ident of this city, and officiated as rector
i of Grace Episcopal Church, corner Cali
i fornia and Stockton streets, now presided
over by the Rev. R. C. Foute. While
; here he attracted marked attention
i through his brilliant pulpit orations and
! thougntful publications. He delivered a
I course of lectures at the Hastings J^aw
i College during his stay on the "Ethics of
| the JLaw," which were afterward pub
: iished in book form and had a wide clr
', culation..
The late Dr. Platt was a self-made and
Betf-edneated man. He was born in
Charon, N. V. . seventy-eight years at,'".
|At the age of 12 he went South and
j through hardship and under distressing
I circumstances he secured siis education.
: He gained his first start in life in Mobile,
i after he had been admitted to the bar.
Eating and sleeping in his little office,
I he waited for clients who never material
s ized, until through good fortune he was
I appointed to detenu a prisoner. Alter
| his eloquent argument on the prisoner's
i behalf, clients were not wanting and the
! tide of ill-fortune turned. He was law
; partner of Governor Peter Burnett of this
| State, who then resided in Mobile, and he
was afterward appointed District Attor
ney of Alabama. He married Miss Cuth
burt, daughter of Judge Cuthburt. who
was at that time Congressman from Ala
bama.
Through the loss of a favorite brother
and nine hours' exposure in the waters of
Mobile Bay, due to shipwreck, his
thoughts turned to the ministry. His first
charge was at Selma, Ala., and In 1858 be
moved to Petersburg. Va., taking the of- I
lice of rector of St. Paul's Kpiseopal
Church. He remained there during the
war, and in 1865 moved to Louisville. Ky.,
and acted as rector of Calvary Church.
In 1572 he came to this city. He was at
the head of Grace Church until ISSI. when
he left for Rochester. N, V., remaining in
that city until IS9I. when he retired. He ;
then traveled through Europe, and on his i
return took up residence at his old home
In Petersburg, Va., whence he will be
borne to his last resting place.
Dr. Platfs principal worn has been as
an author. During his visit in Europe he '
studied art, and on his return he published
a text book on Ruskin. Other works have
followed rapidly. In ISB3 he made a learned
reply to Ingersoll in a book entitled "God i
Out'and Man In." Other important theo
logical works followed, as did also a j
novel and some widely printed poetry. The
poetry Horace G. Platt intends collecting
and printing in book form within a short
time.
The deceased was a member of the vet
erans of the Mexican War Society and
was a high member in the Masonic oraer.
The news of his death will be received
with regret by all who knew him, as he
was a genial and a lovable man.

HARBOR.

Fail in Bepeated Attempts

Special DiÃD&tch to The Cali.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Dec. 18.â
While the United States cruiser Cin
cinnati was leaving port at about sun
set yesterday she ran full speed upon
a rock clearly defined in the charts, but
not buoyed. Last September General
Leonard Wood, considering that the ab
sence of a buoy there might lead to
some accident, anchored a small one.
the first ever placed there, but the
Bessie, on entering the harbor one
night, carried it away, and since then
there has been no buoy to mark the
location of the rock. The Cincinnati
probably is not seriously damaged, as
she is not making water. For the last
twenty hours the Government collier
Southery and the Mayflower have been
engaged in an effort to pull her off.
Thus far they have been unsuccessful,
but it is hoped they will have better
luck to-night at high tide. The princi
pal risk now is of tearing a hole in
the cruiser's bottom while hauling her
off.
Captain C. M. Chester, the cruiser's
commander, insists that the landmarks
are in the wrong places and have not I
been altered in any way since the Am
erican occupation. Pilots are not com
pulsory upon the entrance of warships,
but the Santiago harbor is difficult and
a warship should invariably take one.
Hereafter a large buoy will mark the
rock upon which the Cincinnati struck.
It now turns out that the man who
was shot here Friday morning by a
Cuban negro after landing from a
schooner hailing from Baracoa. was
not, as at first supposed, Celesto Rod
riguez, the guerrilla, but a merchant
from Baracoa. who had come here to
purchase supplies. The assumption is
that th^ crime was committed for the
sake of robbery.
From Firrmsa. a town which is vir
tually the property of the Juraeua
Iron Company, comes a report that the
alcalde has been attacked and stabbed
with a machete and that there has
been another stabtiing affray at Bai
qulri. Although these affairs are prob
ably mining camp rows, the authori
ties now feel compelled to police those
places, which heretofore has been un
necessary owing to the fact that a
majority of the workmen were Spanish
soldiers and under military discipline.
The arrival of the news that the
United States Senate had confirmed
the nomination of General Wood as a
major general was the occasion for
general rejoicing here. General Wood
was at El Morro examining the im
provements, and got his first intima
tion when the Punta Gorda battery
fired a major general's salute. The

were rung, the civic band played for
several hours and in the crowded cafes

EVERYTHING AMERICAN
PRAISED BY MORI
Japanese Naval Commander Talks of
This Country and the Recent
War.
SEATTLE, Dec. 18.â Commander Ichibel
Mori, who has arrived here from Japan
â¢with a number of seamen, -will shortly
leave for San Francisco to take charge
of the cruiser Chitose.
The commander has an Intense admira
tion for everything American. He says
the policy of expansion which has been
adopted by the United States receives the
most cordial support of the Japanese.
They had long looked with sympathetic
eyes at the oppressions heaped upon the
natives of the Philippines by Spain and
were glad when the strong arm of Com
modore Dewpy put an end to them.
Another cause of their favor is that the
islands now probably will be opened to
commerce, furnishing a new and im
portant field for traffic of all nations, one
of the most important of which, on ac
count of the accessibility of the Malayan
markfts. will be Japan.
Captain Mori believes that the United
States is entitled to the islands, not only
for reasons of humanity, but as the legit
imate fruits of a victorious war. It
would be preposterous, he says, to seri
ously thinK for a moment of returning
them to Spain.
The American methods of warfare were
critically studied during the recent con
flict, and Japan will adopt many of the
improvements which were demonstrated
to be feasible. In the meantime, the
building of the new navy will go on as
planned at the end of the war with
China, and a considerable portion of fu
ture contracts for warships will be let to
American firms, he says. One of the prin
cipal reasons of this, aside from the su
perior workmanship, will be that the
United States is nearer to the home coun
try so that the vessels can be taken
across the Pacific without the long voy
age through the Suez Canal or around the
Cape of Good Hope.
GENERAL CLOUS NIPS
A SPANISH "JOB"
Prevents the Letting of a Sewer Con
tract in the City of
Havana.
HAVANA, Dec. 18.â General Clous
called on General Castellanos this even
ing to bring to the latter's notice tha
action of the Havana municipality in
attempting to hastily negotiate, during
the last days of Spain's control, a sewer
contract involving the city in an in
debtedness of millions of dollars.
The project underlying the contract
was approved by the municipality last
Friday without sufficient examination,
and the contract was to have been
executed at the next meeting of tha
council to-morrow morning.
General Castellanos expressed his
surprise, asserting that he had received
no previous intimation of the contem
plated action, and thanked General
Clous for informing him regarding: a
proposal which was entirely without his
sanction and opposed to his directions
and desires. He promptly announced
that his secretary would inform tha
civil governor and the municiDal au
thorities that no contracts of this na
ture must be entered upon, and that
whatever had been done in this Una
must be annulled.

(q COMMERCIAL f^NF^RE-
IT is rather difficult out here in California, where
trade is not particularly brisk, to realize that the
year 1898 is going out with Hying colors and a
record which will beat all previous exhibit?, but such
seems to be the case. The commercial statisticians of
the East are enthusiastic over it. It is largely a case of
figure.-, for taking the different lines of trade individu
al!} no especial activity is apparent, except in iron. But
the Government statement of exports and imports for
the first eleven months of the calendar year shows
that the exports of the United States amounted to
$1,117,681,199, exceeding the imports by $537,837,046,
r.n increase over the same period in 1897 of $143,026,
115. Dun's weekly review calls December a month
of surprises, and Bradstreet's says that "Likening the
general business of the country to that of a water
-c, it may be authoritatively stated that nearly
all the channels of seasonable trade are at the pres
ent running full and in some lines of business the
stream is virtually overflowing."
In point of activity the iron and steel trade leads
all others. In fact, at the present rate of progress
it will not be long ere the United States will be to
the iron trade what Great Britain lias been for dec
ades Already foreign countries are seeking our
markets for supplies, and the demand is now so great
that the mills are turning down orders right along.
The most recent instance of this is the refusal of
the Chicago mills to execute an order from the Rus
sian Government for 75,000 tons of steel rails to be
delivered at Vladivostock, because they are too busy
to fill it. Nothing like the present activity in iron
has been seen for years, if indeed, ever.
In other branches of business the signs are favor
able. During the past week there have been ad
vances in cotton, coffee, lumber, copper, lead and
almost all the cereals. Increased buying of cotton
at the advance is reported. The improved movement in
wool already noted still continues and large purchases
by the Eastern mills are reported, while many mills
long idle have started up. The exports of wheat and
corn from Atlantic ports are running very large,
those of corn being surprisingly so, and if it con
tinues it will result in enormous benefit to the West
ern farmers. In fact, it is our phenomenal export
trade in all classes of products which is exciting the
East, and well it may, for we are now sending away
liars' worth of goods for every dollars worth
we buy. Xo other country in Christendom is mak
ing such a record.
Business failures also continue to make a fine
showing, those last week amounting to 261, against
320 for the same week in 1897. The bank clearings
showed an increase of 2,3.4 per cent over the corre
sponding week last year. The distributive trade of
the country is fair, but is completely dwarfed by the
magnificent exhibit of the export trade.
Wall streets reflects the general prosperity by an
cnorni' gate of transactions in both bonds
and stock*, which has carried prices tor many to the
highest level of the year. The leading feature of the
week was the heavy buying for London account,
showing that the foreigners realize our prosperity
and are taking advantage of it.
I n California the situation has measurably im
proved during the past week, owing to the rain,
which, though not copious, was sufficient to give the
feed a frond start and break the long dry spell, which
was beginning to stagnate trade. Moist, foggy weath
er has followed the rain and given it a chance to
soak in. We need more rainfall, but will probably
get it, for the dry conditions seem pretty well broken
up.
The cereal markets have improved during the past
few nays. Wheat has scored a small advance owing
to reported damage- t" the Argentine crop, and all
the minor cereals except rye have shown a tendency
to ri c c The grape growers and winemakers have
been encouraged by the sale of 5.000.000 gallons of
red wine at i_ >i i(n 15c per gallon, and what is still bet

in the trade to come together for the common good.

THE ACME OF GALL.
A RECENT report of the transportation com
mittee of the Boston Associated Board of
Trade shows that the Expressman's League
has applied to the Board of Trade to take action
! toward inducing Congress to repeal that portion of
j the internal revenue tax law which imposes upon cx
l press companies a tax upon the shipments of mer
chandise.
It is not likely that the Boston Board of Trade is
the only association which the Expressman's League
j has endeavored to set to work in its scheme of fur
j ther tax-shirking. It has probably applied to similar
! bodies all over the country, and doubtless has a lobby
at Washington ready to swear that the people at large
I favor the repeal of the tax.
Recent experiences of the impudence with which
I the express companies have shifted their taxes upon
! the public show it is difficult to fix limits to the ex
! tent of their gall and tax-shirking rascality, but this
I petition seems like capping the climax. It is the
I very acme of gall. Possibly the league has in it a
! capacity for even further impudence in its rapacity
I than this, but until something new is revealed this
i must stand as the supreme effort of disloyal greed
tc rob the public and avoid its share of the cost of
: the war.
The express companies have never paid a dollar
of the revenue tax. They shifted the cost of the
i revenue stamps upon the public at the start, and are
even now fightirfg" from court to court every attempt
made to compel them to obey the law. Their dis
loyalty knows no limit.-. They would see our soldiers
Mar\e in the field, our navy lie idle and helpless for
lack of supplies, and the nation itself perish, before
they would pay one cent out of their swollen revenues
to the Government. By shirking, by lying, by cheat
ing and by bullying the public they will shift the tax
;r long as they can; and then ask Congress to repeal
tic :.i\ upon their business and increase it upon that
: of some one else.
The transportation committee of the Boston Board
of Trade has refused to single out "this one class of
business which is taxed by the new internal revenue
law" for relief; but it suggests that the law might
!>-â  improved by levying the tax upon the gross re
ceipts of the companies instead of upon shipments
c f merchandise. The plan might be a good one, if
any corporation less shifty and prevaricating than the
express companies were to be dealt with. A tax upon
their gross receipts, however, would simply impose
upon their officials the easy lie of swearing they have
no gross receipts. They could make that lie on Sat
urday and go to church on Sunday looking as sanc
timonious as they do now.
The present form of the tax is good enough. The
only thing needed is to provide a heavier penalty
upon the expressmen for their violation of it. If
: a few of the psalm-singing thieves in high office in
the companies were sent to the penitentiary for rob
bing the public and defrauding the Government, their
virtue might not be improved, but their gall would
be lessened and the public to that extent benefited.
NO MORE ROSSER FORCES.
IF the courts of California adjust themselves to the
feeling indicated by expressions of indignation
and disgust at the Rosser travesty, the present will
be the date of a new judicial epoch. There will be
from now on. a tendency to administer justice for the
laudable purpose of punishing and restraining crimi
nals, rather than for the purpose of bedecking them
with bouquets and sending them on their ways re
! joicing.
There were, aside from the display of maudlin wit
ilessness in the jury-box, features of the trial resulting
; in the absurdity of acquittal calling almost as mark
' edly as the jury for rebuke. The prosecution was
half-hearted. The deputy of the District Attorney
di-]ilayed only a moderate interest. The infection of
a misplaced sympathy had apparently touched and
ruddled him. The instructions of the Judge, read by
! another Judge, were given no more inflection nor ef
ii t than a bill being droned into the unlistening ears
1 o! a tired Legislature.
The instructions themselves, we think, laid greater
stress upon the possibility of the prisoner's having
been drugged than the evidence warranted. Other
soldiers who had drank an equal amount had re
tained their senses. They had killed no men nor at
tempted to kill any boys. If Rosser had been given
drugged liquor why was not the seller of it haled into
court? Why is he not now in jail? The probability
must be recognized that Rosser merely drank such
whisky as the dives afford.
Altogether, the trial, hollow, howling tearful pre
tense that it was, may be productive of good results.
The roar of protest against it is a healthy sign, and
a hint that this community will endure no more such
frauds. We do not accuse the jury of worse than
foohshne^, nor say Rosser was hurried out of the
service that the military authorities might have no
hold upon him. We have never said that the fact
I of the attorney for the defense, being father of the
District Attorney, a gentleman now too busy to at
tend to the duties of his office, had any bearing on the
laxness of the prosecution. We only say that such
1 j wanton turning awry of law and equity must not
occur again, for the people will have none of it. In
a =inccre though possibly crude theory which is dear
to them, they refuse to recognize the courts as sus
: taincd for the benefit of the criminal.
THE BRITISH IN EGYPT.
A CORRESPONDENT of the New York Sun
claims to have official authority for the state
ment that the recent activity in British naval
and military circles is due to an understanding be
tv. (tn Great Britain and the triple alliance that if the
British Government formally annexes Egypt to the
empire, Germany, Austria and Italy will support her
against any objection that may be made by Russia
and France. Upon this agreement, it is said,
the British are preparing to get rid of the in
ternational council in Egypt and are making their
navy ready for possible consequences.
It is hardly likely there will be any war over the
issue, notwithstanding the irritation caused in France
by the recent speech of Sir Edmund Monson. How
ever earnest the French jingoes may be in their de
sire to establish a colonial empire in Africa to rival
that of the British, they cannot accomplish it. The
lion that bars the way for them is more potent than
the British lion, even though that beast be backed by
the eagles of Germany and Austria. It is the lion of
natural law.
Official reports of the French population for the
year 1897. which have just been issued, show that the
total number of birthsVor the year was in round num
bers 850.000, as against 865.000 for the previous year.
This diminution in the birth rate has been going on
for years, and it is stated that the French population
contains a smaller number of men and women of
what are called able-bodied ages, namely, from 15 to
55 years in the case of men and to 45 in the case of
women, than it did thirty years ago.
With a population so diminishing at home it would
be the wildest folly on the part of the French to
THE SAJN" JfKAJN CISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 19^189*.
sacrifice their bravest men in an attempt to build up
a colonial empire. Territorial expansion is one of
the things France does not need and could not profit
by, even if the valor of her troops could attain it for
her.
As the case stands the British seem to have a free
way in Egypt. They have possession of the country,
they have the support of all the capitalists who own
Egyptian bonds, they have a swarming population
capable of furnishing adventurous pioneers to go into
the land and subdue it from Cairo to the Cape, they
have a navy strong enough to stand of? most of the
world, and, if it be true they have also the support
of the triple alliance, the end" is a foregone conclu
sion. It will hardly be necessary for the Salisbury
Government to make any change in the situation.
Egypt is theirs, and along with Egypt goes almost
everything else that is African.
THE MONTEREY PETITION.
BY the memorial addressed to the Governor set
ting forth the distress occasioned in some sec
tions of Monterey County by the prolonged
drought, a call for assistance has been made to which
the generous people of the prosperous portions of
the State will promptly respond. The extent of the
suffering and the amount of relief required should
be investigated without delay in order that help may
be given adequately and at once.
There have been frequent calls made upon the
general Government in cases of this kind, but these
have come from the people of the half arid plains of
Western Nebraska, Kansas and Texas, and from the
dwellers along the often submerged banks of the
Mississippi. From such regions a call for help was
not surprising, but there will be something of sur
prise if any section of California should come as a
petitioner to the Government.
Fortunately it is not at all likely there will be any
need to ask assistance from any source outside the
State. A good deal of railroad building is going on
in the vicinity of the drought-stricken section, and
that will provide work for the people and put money
into circulation. With the coming of rain, for which
the prospects are now good, the grass will revive and
afford plentiful pastures for stock. Finally the county
as a whole is fairly rich and prosperous, and there
will be a bountiful local aid to help the needy over
the hard times that have come upon them.
While all of these reasons tend to justify the belief
that the distress is not very extensive and will not
require any further help than can be given by private
generosity, the subject should not be ignored or put
aside. California has shown a great bounty to the
people of famine-stricken Russia and to the starv
ing, plague-stricken people of India. She should be
even more bountiful in ministering unto the needs
of her own citizens.
THE WASHINGTON CENTENNIAL.
A MOVEMENT has been started in Washing
ton to celebrate the centennial of the city,
which occurs in 1900, by the establishment of
some kind of permanent memorial to mark so his
torical an occasion. The President has warmly com
mended the plan and has recommended Congress to
appoint a committee to assist in the work. He has
also urged an appropriation for it.
The plan of celebrating the event by the erection
of a great memorial structure instead of by holding
an exposition, is a good one, for Washington has
comparatively little commercial and industrial ac
tivity to be benefited by an exposition, while its posi
tion as the capital of the nation and its general mag
nincence makes it well fitted as a site for monumen
tal architecture.
What form the memorial is to take has not yet
bten decided. There are certain to be plenty of sug
gestions. The supporters of the National University
scheme will of course suggest some notable struc
ture for that institution, and with good reason, for
as Washington urgently recommended the foundation
of such a university, it would be fitting to celebrate
the centennial of the city by dedicating a noble build
ing for its uses.
There is also a long standing demand for a state
lier home for the President. A more recent demand
is for a spacious building for the Department of Jus
tice and the Supreme Court. There is another for
a massive memorial bridge across the Potomac.
Washington, in fact, has, an abundant supply of
schemes for architectural improvements. It is possi
ble, however, the citizens would not be willing to
sacrifice any of these for the centennial memorial.
They may hope to get all of them and the memorial
"besides.
As a rule the whole nation is gratified with the
upbuilding of the national capital. If any well con
sidered plan is adopted for the proposed memorial,
Congress need not be parsimonious in appropriating
money for it, as the people will be sure to approve it.
But in the competition for the design the architects
and artists of all sections and States should have a
chance. It would be a subject of some historical note,
as an illustration of our development as a nation,
if the designer of the centennial memorial should be
a resident of the Pacific Coast.
THE Examiner is now engaged in calling W. J.
Bryan down on his attempt to connect the dead
issue of free silver with the living issue of im
perialism. Having bullied the country generally, it
now proposes to bully its own chosen leader. The
work is doubtless congenial and a fine corollary to
the alliance between the epileptic press and the bogus
Democracy.
The Examiner has great projects. It looks upon
the world as "a small ball of dirt," which could be
easily controlled by an American Napoleon. Sup
pose we try the experiment on a limited scale. The
man who offered $50,000 reward for the destroyer of
the Maine, who sent a Congressional commission to
Cuba to supervise the commission appointed by the
Government, and who wants to nail our flag to the
rotten tree of Spanish despotism, deserves some
recognition. Let us give him the Philippines and
allow him to start a little imperial hell of his own
under the gorgeous title of "Hearst the First." Then
he will have a fair chance for a "national policy,"
unhampered by the American constitution, and, if
he will only take with him the Examiner and the en
tire crew it directly represents, they can heal their
election sores and live on free silver, while the United
States plods along within its ancient limits as a con
tinental republic, sustained by white labor, paid in
gold.
Wine dealers are expressing their regret that an
adulterated article should have been sent to Mexico,
but by expressing no more such wine they can best
demonstrate that the regret is the outpouring of con
trite hearts.
In connection with some recent shipments from
this State a question has arisen as to the quality of
Mexican justice. Why not refer this to Dan Burns?
Our battleships seem to have their greatest dangers
to contend with in times of peace.

Vlckers & Sons and Maxim at the Naval
Construction Works, Barrow, have work
to the amount of $17,500,000 In hand, chiefly
naval contracts.
The armament of the Gladiator class,
British cruisers, is to consist of ten 6-inch
quick-firing rifles, instead of four 6-inch
find six 4.7-lnch quick-firers as originally
designed.
The discontent of the crew on the Brit
ish battle ship Majestic has spread to the
Prince George, also in the Channel fleet.
Several of the tompions belonging to the
6-lnch quick firing guns have been lost,
presumably thrown overboard by the
crew.
The corrected time made by the Jap
anese cruiser Kasagi on her recent trial
over a course of 20 miles, run twice over,
was 23 knots up and 22M; knots down, giv
ing an average of 22^, knots. The revolu
tions ranged from 168 to 164. The Kasagi
was built by the Cramps and completed
within contract time.
At Schneider's yard at Chalons sur
Soane (a part of the Creuao" establish
ment) the following number of vessels are
under construction: Nine torpedo boats
of 24 knots and six of 21 knots, all for
the French navy; two screw boats for use
on rivers in Russia: two tugs of 1000
horsepower, and three floating dock-gates.
There are ten different caliber guns in
the British navy and It Is ap--ehended by
naval officers that one more will bo added
by the Admiralty. The calibers now on
board ships aro 16^-inch, 13& 12. 10. 9.2.
G, 5, 4.7, 4 and 3 inch. The new Run talked
of is one of 7 Inches and officers are op
posed to Its introduction. The above list
does not include the smooth-bore guns, of
â¢which there are still a number on the
older vessels.
Some very successful experiments have
been made at Fiume, on the Adriatic, with
an invention of an Austrian naval en
gineer for stopping vessels under way.
The Inventor claims that by the use of
his apparatus the way of a steamer going
at full speed can be instantly checked.
The experiments, which were made with
the Government steamer Clotilde, were
witnessed by representatives of the navy,
the Austrian Lloyd and other shipping
companies.
Experiments with mixed fuel, composed
of coal and petroleum refuse, have been
carried on in the French navy with the
Dunois torpedo gunboat of 898 tons, in
tended to make a speed of 23 knots. The
trials have not proved satisfactory, for
the consumption of the mixed fuel was
1.66 pounds against 1.61 pounds per horse
power per hour of coal alone. Another se
rious objection was the dense volume of
smoke made by the mixed fuel. The
horsepower reached as high as 11,000.
At the time of the Fashoda Incident the
supply of ammunition at Toulon naval
arsenal was so small that there was not a
sufficient quantity in the magazine for the
squadron in the Mediterranean. It Is also
stated by Le Yacht of November 12 that
on the Northern squadron the big guns on
the Redoubtable were without fittings,
making it impossible to fire these guns,
and that the Baudin and Formidable lack
some of their armor. A naval war with
Great Britain would most likely reveal a
condition of naval affairs In France as bad
as its army was found when war was de
clared against Germany In IS7O.
The Fleurus, a third-class cruiser in the
French navy. Is causing the authorities
much trouble. She was built at Cher
bourg In 1593, at a cost of $642,650, and is
of 1310 tons, 4000 horsepower and was to
steam 19 knots, but only reached 17.1 under
the most favorable conditions. Her ma
chinery was taken out in IS9C and new
engines and boilers put In. A trial took
place last month, when under natural
draught and 132 revolutions the vessel
reached 17.5 knots. As the Fleurus was

SHALL WE ANNEX
THE PHILIPPINES ?
By FRANK H. SHORT,
I am not in sympathy with any man or organization of men who think
that the Government or the people of the United States have departed from
their allegiance to the principles for which it, the Government, was creat
ed, or that think any party is organized or actuated with intent to cen
tralize, imperialize. socialize or anarchize our republican government or in
stitutions. It is not so much purpose or intent a free people must vigilant
ly guard against as it is mistakes, misconceptions and misguided enthusi
asm and effervescent patriotism.
To assume that the certain acquisition of Porto Rico or the probable
annexation of Cuba, or the accomplished annexation of Hawaii, are logical
forerunners of the annexation of the Philippines-, >r preconceived advanced
steps connected successively with each other, is in my judgment a mistake.
To illustrate, the annexation of Hawaii was planned and well nigh accom
plished before the American Government or people substantially realized
that the Philippines were on the mar, or ever would in the remotest degree
come within our sphere of direct influence. The assumption that to approve
In their successive order the acquisition of the Louisiana purchase, Florida,
Texas, California and the adjacent States and Territories, Alaska and Ha
waii, is also logically to approve of the proposed annexation of the Philip
pines, is equally or more false and absurd.
The acquisition of all the territory acquired prior to Alaska was consist
ent with the natural growth and political organization of the young repub
lic. It meant only that a similar race under similar purpose should occupy
and conjointly govern contiguous and homogeneous territory. Alaska main
land and islands were not contiguous, but it brought with it no new prob
lems of government, no new policy of administration, no race questions, no
labor problems, no "colonial" system. Hawaii was brought in under dif
ferent but not radically inconsistent ideas. The islands were pointed to as
more American than otherwise, more a part of this country than any other,
and essential to its own commerce and defense â a population infinitesimal in
comparison with even one ordinary State, not to mention the whole popula
tion of the country. This Government could not with complacency see those
islands possessed, fortified or occupied by any other power either in times
of peace or war, so that Hawaii was annexed, not as a colony, but as oc
cupying a sufficiently and relatively contiguous position on th-> map of the
world so that the islands could and did come in more properly as a part of
the republic than of any other nation. 1, therefore, approve of the annexa
tion of Hawaii. If mistaken, then the mistake is not great or momentous;
if it be poison, then the quantity is too small to kill or seriously affect the
whole system.
It is argued because some loyal and able men thought that the Louisiana
territory should not have been acquired and they were wrong, because Web
ster and kindred statesmen opposed the acquisition of the territory from
Mexico and they were mistakenâ that those who oppose the annexation of
the Philippines are necessarily wrong. In other words, une step proves
right, another proves right, and another and then you may close your eyea
and walk any way and anywhere and no step can be mistaken nor lead
over the abyss beyond which the true purpose or scope of the republic can
not go
We are a peculiar people, a nation born beneath the clouds of war and
by the sword, a nation founded in a new world, with new aims, new prin
ciples and new hopes.
The essential and fundamental principle of this republic is that man
is the unit; that each one is a coequal part of the whole; that if you add
together all of the people and divide by the sum of the whole the result
is always the exact measure of the exact rights under the law of every
citizen, no one one fraction more, no one one fraction less. "All of the just
powers of government come from thÂ» j consent of the governed." "A gov
ernment of the people, by the people and for the people." So it came about
in the formation of this republic that though for many thousand years
mankind had journeyed to reach the dawn, as by one stroke, by inspira
tion from God or man it matters not, it was at once high noon, the per
fection of civil liberty, from dawn to midday in the passing of one little
moment in the great sum of human history. No one is now under the
jurisdiction of the United States that is not, or may not become a citizen,
and the question is, Shall millions come under our jurisdiction that are not
to be brought in as, and never can become, citizens? I know there are
many who are wiser than when our declaration of independence and con
stitution was adopted. The world has progressed. We are more learned,
we have grown, expanded; we are wiser, so much wiser, than Washington
and th> rest of them. The answer to it all is this: We are building upon
their foundation, not our own. It might be we could lay it better and more
securely. I think not, nor half so well; but whether lam mistaken or not
there is the foundation and upon it we must build, or not at all. It might
be that one architect should commence the construction of a building that
took years to complete, he should pass away and another take his place,
a better one you may assuror, but upon the other's foundation he must
build, or not at all. Notwithstanding this, he radically changes the char
acter, proportions, weight and appearance of the structure. If he makes
changes enough and go on long enough the only result possible is that In
the end he will be buried beneath the ruins of the better structure than
that begun by his predecessor. Some things progress; others cannot. Per
fection is the end sought. It may be attained in principles at the begin
ning as in the inception of our Government; if so, the beginning and the
end are one and the same.
Truth is eternal: it was at the beginning; it will be despite all human
effort the same truth at the end. We have statesmen to-day before whose
radiant wisdom (estimated by themselves) the combined wisdom and learn
ing of Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Jay and Madison pales Into
a little, belated star before the rising sun. We are not burdened alone
with statesmen of this class; ministers even with university degrees, silk
hats, creased pants and patent leather shoes can tell us the wisdom, wishes
and ways of Almighty God so much better than He who, bareheaded and
sandal shod, stood upon the Mount of Galilee and spoke words that have
journeyed down the ages and ameliorated the condition of untold millions
of the human race, words that have made this government a possibility
among mankind. *
All this is passing to the subject, "Shall we annex the Philippines?"
I am an American, proud of the success and ambitious for the pros
perity of my country. I am a Republican, loyal to my party, proud of
her history and devoted to her principles. My country has not acted, my
party has not spoken, so I oppose no law whatever way I decide for my
self, but if both had occurred in action I could to be true to myself say
only. No.
This Government was founded upon a new principle. To-day she is the
supreme and undisputed controlling spirit of half the earth; when we con
sider this Its possibilities, the work to be done, the wisdom, valor and hon
esty necersary to accomplish this work, the man who sighs for more, if
he knew what he was sighing for, would be a tit subject for the envy of aji
Alexander, a Caesar, a Napoleon. Washington in his farewell address
warned arainst the departure from and pleaded for tho preservation of two
things. "National unity," that, his first hope and dream, a great democratic
government, is realized, fixed and cemented largely by the Republican
party, for which divine mission it was created and c :ime into existence.
The second wish, that his country should pursue its higher and better
mission free from foreign entanglements, alliances or contaminations, is now
for the first time to be put to actual trial and determined for all time, It
may be. We have achieved a great victory over a very inferior power. We
now have the opportunity and ability to violate his injunction and radically
depart from the principles that thus far have in the main controlled us
and served us well. Having the opportunity are we great enough to re
fuse it? ThÂ° fundamental question is at stake. Is man still the unit? Is
human liberty and the rights of man first? Shall we abandon the position
of the dominant democracy of the Western hemisphere, the great self-re
specting republic of the world, for a "colonial system," for "commercial
supremacy?" Shall we, the descendants of Washington, Hamilton and
Jefferson, become one of the governmental, monarchial hogs, fattening at
the trough of Oriental degeneracy and decay? Can any one delude himself
into balievlng that we can by conquest plant our flag over ana assume to
rule eight or nine millions of people in violation of every principle that has
thus far actuated us without suffering a great loss in national conscience
and national character? Can we bring in and -voTern a non-participating
and non-consenting people perpetually under our constitution, without vio
lating it? Admittedly not. Can we bring them in Oriental by birth,
slothful in habits, living beneath a tropical sun and barred by nature's laws
from ever becoming homogeneous with the Anglo-Saxon race? Can we ad
mit them nd not suffer a frightful loss in the average character of our peo
ple? Here lies the most immediate objection and danger. This country, its
laws, its prosperity and existence hinges on the stability, the industry, the
integrity and loyalty of the average American man, the man who works,
who has a wife, who has children, who has a home; upon him depends his
country's greatness and prosperityâ not the very poor, there should be as few
as possible; not the very rich, the tewer the better of either class. Can we
bring in the opposite of this, our ideal, and not injure our country?
In the - nilippines we have labor in its simplicity, in its servility; wealth
in its arrogance and supremacy. Thus it has been in the Orient since the
beginning; thus it will remain to the end. Shall we bring in what we have
too much of already? Shall we aggravate the one national disease that
now commands the anxious attention of every American, who hopes to
hand down to his children, unimpaired, the institutions he received from his
fathers?
Whether th# Philippines would add to our trade or commerce or wealth
I do not know. I think the same energy, the same effort and industry ex
pended in our own hemisphere and among our own kind would accomplish
much more in a material direction. Build the Nicaragua canal, improve
our intern' l and external resources, advance our borders, if they need be
advanced, along lines contiguous? to our boundaries. Somewhere in
the Western hemisphere would seem to allow latitude enough.
I cannot comprehend the man who argues that though we might con
trol all of this half of the world, we are isolated and non-progressive unless
wo divide with five or six other powers the control of the other half It i<
the enthusiasm and intoxication of oratory, it is not thought, it is not nec
essary to commerce or finance. But suppose it enhanced both at the expense
of national principles and the character of the average American man? Is
man still the unit, or is money? Is man the beginning and the end and
money the means, or is money the beginning and the end? If free govern
ment perpetually maintained, where all men shall be equal, is an iridescent
and passing dream, then it matters not much whether we depart now or
later from our fundamental principles. But if we still have faith in our
selves and our country, then our first and imperative duty is to stand by
the institutions of our fathers, true to our faith and inspired by the same
hope they cherished.
The stock argument is, that it Is popular, that the people want it, that
it is manifest destiny, that it means more commerce, more money, more
population, more territory, more power, more, more, more. In heaven's
name, is mere acquisition, mere wealth, the sole aim and object? Cannot a
man stand honestly against what he believes a mistaken popular clamor
without being rated disloyp.l to his party in advance? Are the cuckoos the
only true partisans of our age? If annexation must be supported on such
grounds, then, right or wrong it will triumph and American thought, man
hood and conscience will have been unheard and at a time when, since the
Declaration of Independence, or the civil war, real American institutions
have not been called so much in question.
The world reads yet, and for generations will continue to read, the
story of Caesar as he paused on the banks of the Rubicon. That event,
momentous as it was, is infinitesimal in comparison with the attitude of
these 70,000,000 of free people and this great republic as it stands unde
cided w-hether it shall remain content with and true to constitutional princi
ples and democratic government, or, at the behest of ambition and greed,
shall turn to the flesh pots of tho Orient.
One who opposes a great public clamor may forfeit popularity, place and
fortune, but a worthier end it seems to me awaits the American citizen,
though he should be but the drift wood along the short line that marks the
boundary of his country's departure from her great and godlike position as
the representative of the true principle of government for the people and
by the people, than to hold the highest of all the high places between the lineof departure from those principles and the inevitable decay and destruction
that lies beyond.

adopted will, right or wrong, be the American policy, our policy: but pend

control the American mind. The minority must be as fearless as the ma

â rum is great enough to decide it except the forum of the peo
ple, for from that final verdict there is no appeal. This people of ail
ught to decide it right.
Peculiar of character, steadfast of purpose, were those fathers and
mothers of ours who came to these shores. Broad, fertile and beautiful
was the continent spread before thorn. Well and bravely and truly they
fought, wrought, labored and died. No other such a people again will come
upon the scene of action, or ever found so true or pure or good a govern
ment. All those hayÂ« hef>n delivered unto us and into our keeping. If
we are false, or fall, by what stretch of imagination or dream of philoso
phy can man ever again hope or strive to found an enduring government
of the people, by the people and for the people.
Bo thus understood we are upon trial, not for this republic or this peo
ple, not for this generation, not for the Anglo-Saxon race, but for human
!:br-rty. self-government, for mankind and for all time. It is not a ques
tion of party policy. It may never be. If it should become such my sin
core hope is to see the party that with blood and treasure made perpetual
the unity of the country at home, with equal patriotism and greater un
selnshnesa guide her further progress along lines consistent with her mis
sion and birth, as defined by him who was first in war, first in peace and
first still, I hope, in the hearts of his countrymen.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1898.
BERNARD D. MURPHY,
BANK, COMMISSIONER,
Governor Budd .Makes tl^e .Most
Popular Jlppointment of His
Jldministration.
P>-:rnard D. Murphy, Santa Clara County's best known and most
highly respected citizen, has been appointed Bank Commissioner to suc
i ! Paris Kilburn, whose term of office has expirtd. In appointing
Judge W. P. Lawlor to the vacancy on the Superior bench. Governor
I madÂ« a selection that was eminently satisfactory, but in nam
ing Mr. Murphy for the office of Bank Commissioner it is evident that
he made the most popular appointment of his administration.
No man is better known throughout the State than Barney Mur
phy of San Jose, and although this paper differs with him politically.
it is pleased to testify that none haa won a more enviable place in the
estimation of his fellow citizens of all classes than has the Gover
nor's newest appointee. Always a consistent Democrat, Mr. Murphy has
more to aid the success of his party, financially and otherwise,
than any one else.
Four years ago Mr. Murrhv went before the Democratic State con
vention as a candidate for the gubernatorial nomination, being Budd's
most formidable opponent, and the Governor could not more hapnilv
close his administration than by thus recognizing the long and faithful
service of his old friend and former political rival.
Moreover, Mr. Murphy is particularly well qualified to fill the posi
tion, his long experience as the leading banker of Santa Clara County
giving him a thorough knowledge of banking institutions and bankers
ry section of the State.
Born in Quebec, March 1, 1841. Mr. Murphy crossed the plains with
his grandfather. Martin Murphy, his father and James Murphy and fam
ily. The Murphy family settled in Santa Clara County, where Barney
was educated, graduating from Santa Clara College with honors. He at
once entered upon, an active business career, and by shrewd invest
ments amassed a large fortune. As a property owner, Mr. Murphy has
done much toward improving and beautifying San Jose. He has held the
positions of Park Commissioner and director of the Agnews Asylum.
He married in 1569 and has nine children, four boys and five girls, all
of whom are living.
STANTON MAY
COME WITHOUT
FEAR OF ARREST
The School Board Is
Outwitted.
RAGAN'S PLAN FRUITLESS.
INJUNCTION SUIT MUST BE
HEABD IN DEPARTMENT 7.
Directors' Scheme to Pay Political
Debts WUh Appointments Frus
trated by Judge
Belcher.
.
E. D. Stanton, ex-teacher in the
Business Evening School, may come
into San Francisco and before the
Grand Jury to say things that he
knows against the School Directors
without fear that the law will again
reach out for him or that his liberty
will be assailed, no matter what
threats have gone out from- those who
are most interested in compelling his
silence.
Judge Belcher has said so, and
Judge Belcher's attitude on the pres
ent disgusting status of school af
fairs is not one that permits of
1 doubt. He yesterday left with tte
Police Department an order to bring
Stanton before him as soon as he may
be arrested upon the warrant threat
ened by Dr. Ragan, and when this
ie done Stanton will be released, no
matter what the charge, upon his
own recognizance. He may come into
this city without let or hindranceâ
this by the order of the court.
In connection with the case Judge Bel- I
cher yesterday said : "I read in The Call of
yesterday morning that it is the intention
of School Director Ragan to swear to a
warrant charging Mr. Stanton with ox
tortion or some other charge yet to be de
cided upon. I immediately came down
town and sought out Sergeant Lind
helmer, who was in charge of the desk at
the Central police station, and left word
with him that immediately upon the
threatened arept of Mr. Stanton I
should be notified and that I
would release him upon his own
izance as soon as he should
appear before me in court. I did this not
to protect a guilty man from the operation
of the law, but to facilitate the investiga-
Â£ n > of the P rty ent Grand Jury into the
affairs of the School Department. His
testimony, I understand, will be of utmost
value to this investigation and I want
-ur. fetanton to understand, wherever he
may be, that he will be protected and al
low, -d to lay all that he knows before the
jury without the f.-ar of suffering an as
sault upon his personal liberty "
The plan of Director Ragan Is to have
btanton placed under arrest as soon as he
is found in this city. The charge he will
prefer will be either attempted extortion
or conspiracy. It was Director Ragan who
preferred the charge against Stanton
upon which the Indictment that wa<=
quashed on the Bth inst. hv Judge Carrol
Cook was brought, and the charge that
ne will make in the present case will b#
the same. To assist him in his case
against the ex-teacher he has called in
the legal services of such attorneys as "W
\\ . Foote. Reel B. Terry. Andy Clunie and
Oeorge Dwyer. Represented by Mr. Terry
he will appear this morning before Judge
Cook to ask that the indictment recently
quashed be restored, upon the ground that
the law under which Judge Cook made his
order of release did not cover the case"
The injunction that Judge Belcher' has
a against the School Board was a
solar plexus punch. It has effectually
put a stop to the plan that existed to
clear the substitute list of the thirteen
teachers that remain upon it since the
last mooting, and it has prevented the ap
pointment to the depleted list of the
thirty new teachers who have been prom
ised positfons in the department. And
the most distressing part of it all is that
the thirty who were to go on were not
the ordinary paid article at $500 or so per
but were pledged the positions in payment
of political debts. Behind over half the
number is the strongest political influence
that this town musters. These appoint
ments represent the unpaid debts of elec
tion time that have been delayed from
meeting to meeting in the confident ex
pectation that when the last day came
and things were ripe for the regular end
of the term clean-up there would be no
trouble in rubbing the account off the
elate. It Is one of the biggest of the
regular annual political deals that Judge
Belcher has put a stop to, and the roar
Is accordingly a loud one.
But the Judge stands firm in his posi
tion. The statement that the Directors
will take the injunction Into another
court to ask its annulment is absurd in
face of the fnct that Judge Belcher Is
presiding Judge over every court In the
department. He has assigned the case to
himself and to no other department, and
only he has Jurlsdictoin over it He. was
asked yesterday by Attorney Samuels
representing the Directors, to assign the
injunction to another court, but the re
quest was flatly refused and Samuels was
informed that if he would appear on the
regular law and motion day. next Friday
a time would be set for hearing reasons'
why the injunction should be dissolved
Despite the fixed intention of the court
Director "Waller and Attorney Samuels'
will again this morning ask that special
consideration be given the matter and
that a special day be fixed for the hear
ing. The request, Judge Belcher an
nounced yesterday, would be denied.
BURGLAR RIFLES A HOME.
S. Solomon's Residence on Sutter
Street Robbed of Valuables.
On Saturday evening- between 5 and 6
o'clock a burglar broke into the home of
' S. Solomons, the real estate broker, who
! resides at 1842 Sutter street. His haul
i amounted to $15 in gold coin and jewels
| valued at several hundred dollars. The
entrance was effected through the front
door, which was guarded solely by an Â»r
dinary latch lock. Several burned matches
were found in the doorway, evidences of
the burglar's work in picking the lock.
The last one in the house before the
burglary was committed was the servant
girl, who left at 5 in the afternoon. She
returned at 9, but noticed nothing strnnge
or disturbed. At 10 Mr. and Mrs. Solomons
returned and upon their entrance to their
bedroom discovered evidences of the rob
bery. The bureau was rilled and all that
was secured was taken from it alone. The
jewelry carried off consisted of some few
diamond pins and earrings and a gold i
chain with a locket pendant.
The only other person in the house be
sides Mr. ami Mrs. Solomons and the ser
vant girl is J. Toplitz, a warm personal
friend of Mr. Solomons. The police are
now at work upon the burglary, but so
far the burglar is undiscovered.

TTnless Charitable Aid Comes To-Day
His Body Will Be Buried

Field.
TThile the people of this city are bust
ling a ; >out the business section of town
In pursuit of appropriate gifts for friends,
relatives and dear ones, there mourns a
lonely and poverty-stricken family almost
within a block of me bright show win
dows of Market street, whose only
thought is directed to the fulfillment of
the hope that siurvation may be kept
the door. Until last Thursday
Hermann Lindner, his wife and three
children, the eldest of whom is hardly 4
years of age. lived happily, if such a
thing were possible, In a one-room hovel
at 940% Mission street, and strove with the
although unequally, for a paltry
and miserable existence. I. ate Thursday,
night Lindner was seized with a delirium
d by a neglected attack of pneu
monia. He tvÂ«s taken to the Receiving
Hospital and later was conveyed to the
County Hospital. After lingering at this
institution for h little over a day he suc
cumbed to the disease, and now his body
lies on a slab In the hospital morgue
awaiting interment. His wife, owing to
her destitute circumstances, lias not
sufficient money to defray the expense of I
burying the body, ajid unless assistance
comes to-day it will be delivered over to
the <-ity undertaker and will be interred
in the potter* a fleld. Dlerk, the under
taker, volunteered to inter the body for
$20, but. on the advice of friends Mrs.
I.indner was influenced to agree to accept
the money, which she is urgently in need
of. and have the body of her husband
buried at the city's expense. However,
although the money was offered by
friends, it v.us not given aa readily as it
wns volunteered and the prostrated
woman is almost frantic with despair, as
her children have no bread and there is
absolutely no money in tiie house. The
sympathizing neighbors in the vicinity
tnok up a collection yesterday morning
h n<l raised sufficient money to provide a
meal for the little ones and the means
â whereby the widow could visit the hos
pital and view the remains of her hus
bojid.
The hovel where the Lindner family
lives and which It calls home is a small
room in the rear of a workshop at 940H
Mission street. Here the mother and
thrift children Â»*at. sleep, cook and, In
short, exist mo>t miserably. There Is
hardly any light in the place, and the sun
never shines within the den. Kntrance to
It Is effected by going through an ordi
nary plank tl<>or facing an allvway that
runs paraJlel to the houses adjoining and
leads to an ordinary paint shop. At the
extreme end is situated the room where
Mrs. Lindner and her three children live.
The partitions are of ordinary frail lum
ber and barely keep the cold and frost
from entering within and claiming tho
little ones as It lias their father.
Whether the people of the city and the
charitable institutions which they support
will come to the aid of this deserving
family is a question that can only be
solved to-day with the volunteered offer
of some philanthropic person to take the
body of Hermann Lindner out of the.
hands of the city and bury It decently in
the name of charity.

winner of the third competition for the
ladles' cup.
The Oakland team is f=till speculating
on its defeat on Saturday by the San
Krancisco men, the defeat being attrib
uted to the visitors' unfamiliarity with
the Presidio links, the roughness of the
course and the absence of putting greens.
The Oakland men are Ftrong in putting,
and the Presidio links furnish almost no
opportunity for skill in this department
of the game. The Oaklanders think that
pome at l"ast of their men are individu
ally as strong players as the San Fran
cisco men. inasmuch as they have done
the nine holes on the Oakland links in
fewer strokes than the best. San Fra.ncisco
men.
In the Handball Courts.

come to the Pacitic Coast on a pleasure trip and is accompanied by his wife
lie will remain for a week or ten daya and may visit the southern portion
of the State before returning to New York. Chief McLaughlin is almost as well
known here as he is in New York. At
the time he appeared before the Lexow
committee the press of San Francisco
was filled with long accounts of the in
vestigation. Chief McLaughlin is a
thoroughly business looking person. He
Is rather under height, but stockily
built. His hair is gray, but there is no
thing else about him to indicate the
thirty years of service he has seen in
the Police Department. At present he
Is one of the rive deputy chiefs and haa
charge of the borough of Manhattan.
Years ago he was a detective in the Dis
trict Attorney's office before Superin
tendent Byrnes was made Chief Inspec
tor. He was then associated with Detec
tive Richard O'Connor and they were
known as the "two Dicks." McLaughlin
was made detective sergeant by Super
intendent Byrnes when he took charge
of the Detective bureau, and afterward
made captain. He was In the Old Slip
station when transferred to the West
Thirtieth street station.
When seen last night Chief McTjangh
lin said: "I have merely come 10 San
Francisco on a pleasure trin. and I pro
pose to renasto bero a -week or ten days.
There is really notbJmr new that I con
tell you about the Police department of
New York that you do not already know
except that the department is now all
under one head, covering the five boroughs, which, of course, includes Brooklyn.
We have over 7000 men on the force at present. Under the new charter the Chief
of Police may ue appointed from any of the captains, Inspectors or deputy
chiefs,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1893.
SICK OFFICERS
NO LONGER TO
BE TOLERATED
Police Commissioners
Call a Halt.
SEVERAL TO BE DROPPED
I
, INCAPACITATED FOR DUTY
THROUGH ILLNESS.
j The Heads of the Department Deter
mine to Weed Out the
Invalid Mem
bers.
It behooves the members of > the Police
Department not to be sick for any length
lOf time In the future. The Police Com
missioners have become tired of certain
members being laid up for several months
In the year and have decided to call a
halt. It is their Intention to keep a record
of the men who, through sickness, are un
able to do police duty. When a policeman
becomes sick It is their intention to make
a note of It and if he is incapacitated for
any length of time he will be. summarily
dismissed from tne department.
Chief Clerk Wright has been Instructed
by the Commissioners to keep a list of the
men who are reported sick. At the end of
each year the list will be considered by
the Commissioners and the ailing ones
who have been unable to do patrol duty ]
for any length of time will be dropped
from tiie roll. This d' â  not include any
member who might be whot or Injured
while In the discharge of his duties.
There are several patrolmen who have
not reported for duty for some time owing
to sickness. The Commissioners have in
vestigated their cases and as they are !
convinced that they will never again be
able to do police duty they have decided
to dismiss them from the department.
Among the number is Policeman Maurice
Duane, whose bravery In entering the
cabin occupied by Theodore i'ark Haynes,
the murderer of Lieutenant Burke, won
for him the admiration of the entire Po
lice Department. While the snarpshooters
of the force were riddling the cabin with
bullets iii the hope that a stray shot
might disable the murderer. Dunne, alone
and unassisted, entered the cabin and
placed Haynes under arrest. IK- was tak
en ill several weeks later, and has since
been confined to his home. The attending
physician says he has lung trouble and
does not expect to save his life.
Another unfortunate, whose star is
about to be dimmed, is policeman Hen
nessey of the Central Station. Ue is af
flicted With cancer of the jaw and Is in a
critical condition, lie has been operated
on several times, but without success.
It is said that the sick officers will not
hear their fate until the Police Commis
sioners meet as a Pension Board in Janu
ary. They will then be dropped from the
roil with as little ceremony as possible.
At the same meeting Policemen More
house and Fred Smith will be retired on
pensions, having served the allotted twen
ty years and attained the age of 60 years.

LEGAL KNOT FOR LAW MAKERS
When Will the Next Legislature Begin ;
Its Session ? ;
m MOST interesting question has arisen in regard to the meeting- of the
A next Legislature, one which promises to set the lawyers on edge and
/-A to provoke a storm of legal technicalities. The cause of It all is the
â *- juxtaposition of January 2 and the first Monday in the month of
January. The State constitution in a mandatory section sets the day for
Jie convocation of the Legislature as the first Monday after the first of
January. According to the calendar New Year's day falls on a Sunday
and by virtue of statutory law the day following is made a legal
loliday. This is where the conflict arises and forces the question: Can the
Legislature begin its session on a holiday or must it begin its session in
iccordance with the terms of the constitution?
The direct import and necessity of a speedy solution of this political
problem is bound up with the selection of a United States Senator. That
>fflcer is elected according to the political code on the second Tuesday
ifter the organization of the Legislature. If they do not meet on Monday
he organization will not be effected until a time which will necessarily
postpone the election of a United States Senator another week. The at
orneys and politicians about town have been discussing the question and
:he stronger and more authoritative opinions seem to point to the
lecessity of a convocation of the Legislature on Monday. January 2. The
following is the opinion of a well-known constitutional lawyer of this
â¢ity:
"The. State constitution (Article 4, Section 2) provides: The sessions of
he Legislature shall convene at twelve o'clock M. on the first Monday
ifter the fir- day of January next succeeding the election of its members,
rhis is mandatory (Article 1, Section 22.) The political code (Sections 235.
138, 23P) follows the direction of the constitution. Holidays are provided
'or by statute and cannot affect constitutional provisions. It follows that
he next Legislature will be called to order and that its session will com
nence on Monday, January 2, 1899, at 1- -U.

THE OTHER WISE MAN.
Subject of an Eloquent Address by
Father McCorry at St. Mary's
Church.
"The Other Wise Man" constituted the
subject of an interesting and eloquent lec
ture by leather McCorry la.st evening at
St. Mary's Church. The lecture, although
given for the purpose of emphasizing the
charity and love of one of the wise men
of Egypt in succoring his fellow man on
the desert at the risk of losing sight
of the Messiah, included a complete, pic
ture of the birth, life and death of the
Savior. Father McCorry spoke of the
rir.st advent of the miraculous star in the
eastern sky, and traced the journey of
the inspired sages from Kgy'pt to the
manger at Bethlehem.
in following them from country to coun
try the preacher never lo?t nor thoroughly
cast to the background the idea of the
Redeemer.
The lecture was concluded with an elo
quent description of the remaining days
or Christ on earthâ his trial before and
condemnation by Pilate, his agony in the
garden ami hi.s death upon the cross

Two Aeronauts Sail an Air Kace at
Glen Park Yesterday.
Notwithstanding the fact that the day
was cold and cloudy and not otherwise
climatically arranged for outdoor attend
ance a large number of people visited
Glen Park and the Mission Zoo yesterday.
The. principal attraction was a novel af
fair in the .shape of a balloon race for
the championship and aeronautic honors
generally.
Professor Charles Conlon and Mile.
Anita were the contestants, and as the
big swaying- air ships left the ground to

good-bvs commingled. They cut loose
from their balloons and dropped back to
earth almost at the same timeâ Conlon,
however, went higher than his fair com
fietitor. The decision was by popular bal
ot, each person present having one vote.

CHRISTIANITY AND LABOR.
In his topic, "Christianity as Applied to
Labor," Rev. William Rader at the Third
Congregational Cliurch, after showing
how little up-to-date Christianity sympa
thized with the soul needs of the laboring
man, severely arraigned the churches for
their sin of omission. 'â¢Religion." said the
speaker, "must work not so much for the
salvation of the individual as for the sal
vation of Society. Christ died for the
world, not fur one man, and it is time
for the ministers of the gospel to speak
the kingdom of heaven into the heart of
labor. The church has been interested in
other matters too long already. The
church Is not antagonistic to the working
man, though the Socialists hold to that
idea."
A Victim of Footpads.
G. B. Thorne," a laborer, was taken to
the Receiving Hospital last night to be
treated for a nasty gash on the chin,
which he said was caused by his being
thrown on a curbstone by two footpads.
Four stitches were needed to close the
gaping wound. Thorne claims that he was
walking on Stevenson street, between
Sixth and Seventh, when two men grap
pled with him for the purpose of robbing
him. In falling he struck the curb and
the footpads, seeing his condition be
came frightened and ran off without com
pleting their work.

as the Friscos' chances were concerned.
But this is just where 1 made a huge
mistake. Doyle was hammered over
Recreation' Park In a manner that was
really distressing and appalling. It is a J
wonder to me that he continued to the !
end thout registering some sort of a j
complaint, but I guess the boy has been j
there before; at least, he gave that im
pression. It must not be conjectured from j
what I have said relative to Mr. Doyle's I
hureh â  itment that he was alone re
sponsible tor the i.umiliating defeat. That |
would be doing him a great injustice, j
â \Vhile it is true he was batted unmerci
fully for such a "star" twirler, yet his
cohorts contributed quite largely toward
assisting him to defeat by their many er
rors and hair-raising wild throws.
To give a correct Idea of the extent to
which these men, who are supposed to |
capture base hits and make them when at i
bat, went in their endeavors to outd< the '
baseball world I will say that Mr. Hop- !
kins Ith a man on third interfered with a I
pround ball, then picked it up and tossed j
it not only over Murphy's head, but clear
ir.to the bleachers. This same individual
ir.ade five errors, all told, and they were
costly. Combined with his misplays
wire clever ones, but this Bide must not
be taken into consideration. immid up
the supporters of Mr. Doyle made nine
large, juicy yellow errors. * Every one of
them was responsible in some form
for a run and a few were respon
sible for more than one. It is quite i
j.nsslble then that Mr. Doyle was not the
only bad egg In yesterday's game. The i
part he played is by no means rving j
of mmen lati< i and yet he must find in
finite consolation in the fact that outside
of the "Friscos' " work there is not a sol
itary thing worthy of mention in an ap- |
proving sense. This is cruelly so. The .
"Florists" to a man played like a bunch !
of Lmboo p< ddlers. It appeared as j
though they were striving to outdo the j
many other poor hibitions that have
time and again been witnessed in the vi
cinity of Recreation Park, and if this be
the ease they succeeded admirably. In fact,
thr-ir success in this respect wa such as to
arouse even the displeasure of Mr. Raver,
the "collection warrior." and their oppo
nents, who up to this moment were head
and heels ahead of all competitors.
There is, of course, no comparison be
tween the two teams as they played yes
terday. The Friscof won with an ease
that was Â»hingâ they so seldom win
with easeâ and played an almost faultless
game. Batting and good base running i
marked their march through the "Flor- j
istf?." while theii fielding was simply su- i
perb, savi In one or two cases. Shea !
pitched a steady, earnest game and kepi j
the opposition guessing at all times. The
boy has always work hard and earnest- j
ly. no matter what position they played
him in. Smith made a wonderful one
handed stop, but in his anxiety threw
badly to llrst and spoiled a good opportu-

FIGHT FOR A COURTROOM.
Judge Mogr.n Steals a March on the j

Since the recent elections there has been j
much speculation as to which of the Po- j
lice Judges would occupy the court room I
now occupied by Judg< Joaehimsen.
Juuge-elcct Graham, who has been Prose
cuting Attorney of the court, considered i
that ie had the best right, to it, but Judge |
Mogan differed from him and believed
that he had B prior right to it on the
ground of lorlty.
The City Hall Commissioners! met last
Thursday j and Tossed a resolution trans- I
ferring Court No. 1 to I "<>lirl NO. 3. and
vice versa, and yesterday afternoon Judge
Mogan with a corps of assistants trans
erred his desk and other furniture to
IfJudtfc Joachimsen's chambers and took
the trouble to transfer Judge Joachimsen's :
desk and other effects to the chambers ,
vacated by him. The sign on the door
was also changed from No. â ': to No. l and ;
. now locks were placed on the doora.

MOONDYNE HAS
A HARD MATCH
WITH PATRIA
Dean's Dog Wins a
Fast Match.
FOUR SENSATIONAL HEATS
SOME GREAT SPORT IN THE FOR-
TV DOG STAKE COTJRSiI.
Matchless and Pat Mailoy Follow a
Lively "Jack" for More Than
Six Minutes and
Lose It.
A match race for $500, a forty
dog stake race and a balloon ascension
race and parachute drop within seeing
distance were a few of the many specta
cles that contributed to the enjoyment of
a tremendous crowd at Ingleside Cours
ing Park yesterday. The initial perform
ance attracted the greater interest, al
though there were stages in the big stake
race that made It a close second in point
of interest.
As anticipated, the betting on the out
come of the match between Patria and
Moondyne was heavy. Both dogs had a
large following, and before the rundown
the excitement was intense. As the rivals
were led to the slips by their respective
trainers they were closely examined and
found to be in superb fettle. The dogs
were slipped to a fast "jack," but it was
quickly overtaken by speedy Moondyne
and killed. l:w the next round Patria
evened matters by scoring ten points to
her rival's tour in a chase after a
I "long" hare. Patria's win gladdened the
hearts of the "shortenders, as she was
played at o to 3.
I On their next iippearance Moondyne was
a slight favorite. The dogs were in such
good condition that the jack was killed
before it had made much progress. Judge
Grace's decision "undecided" was greeted
j with loud applause, as bettors were tiven
another chance for their money.
An hour later the dogs were slipped for
their final heat. Moondyne led up and
took the turn by three lengths, gaining a
i "wrench," when Patria shot forward and
"killed," spoiling her chances of landing
the big purse. Moondyne' 8 score was 4
;.' Patria a 2%.
Elcperts were of the opinion that Moon
dyne won the race on fiis merits. They
believe him much faster and stronger
than his rival, but qualify their asser
, tions by adding that Patria is not far bt
hind him in both essentials.
The feature of the stake race, and there
were many during the afternoon, was the
' course between Matchless and Pat Mal
loy.. The last named dogs chased back
and forth across the big park for six
minutes and thirty-five" seconds and
stopped from exhaustion, the hare
scampering to the escapes. This course
was one of the longest ever witnessed at
the park, and created a sensation. Judge
Grace's steed became tired following me
long clia.se. and the man who bestrode it,
fearing fatal results to the hounds, or
dered them stopped. This was an easy
task, as they were barely trotting. Pat
Malloy was awarded the flag, but was
afterward withdrawn.
In the minds of many Matchless might
1 have ended the course earlier in the game
and won but for the long run he experi
enced in the previous round.
Favorites landed often, but the infre
quent victories of the "shortenders" add
ed spice to the betting.
Following are the results and the num
ber of points scored by each dog:

LOOKING FOR
A SCHEME TO
EFFECT REFORM
The Last Convention
Brought Failure.
OAKLAND'S POLITICAL CHAOS
MUNICIPAL LEAGUE TOO FOND
OF CLOSED DOORS.
Jlepublican Party Quite Able to Give
an Honest Administration if
It Be Not Split by
Ambition.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 18.
Within the next two weeks the Repub
lic ,n? of this city will have to decide
whether the municipal convention shall
If composed "f appointed delegates or
whether each member of the party shall
1,0 given an opportunity to vole f >r such
sentation as he desires. The matter
Is now being freely debated, and mm
prominent in the party have been found
earnestly advocating either of these
methods. Th^e last appointed Republican
convention was an unmitigated failure.
and no one conversant with th* municipal
history of the past two years needs to
be told anything more about the present
administration. It matter not now
whether the water companies or a few
ambitious individuals en an 6 the last Re
publican city convention. As many peo
ple believe that it was the child of cor
ruption as there are others who unhesi
tatingly declare it was conceived in vir
tue and good faith.
It is the next convention in which this
city la now Interested. For a few months
the old manipulators of politics have been
Bleeping, and just now there is a. feeling
of distrust, which has been increased by
the sudden activity shewn by the .Muni
cipal League, which, as at present â¢
tuted. may be considered .is an offshoot
of the Republican party, having a tew
epecitic purposes to tulttll. The Municipal
League is to a large extent composed of
that vvinf, of the Republican party who
favor the appointment of delegates to
the city convention. This main principle
is surrounded by a tew others of subor
dinate Interest, Inasmuch as they all de
pend upon the men nominated at the con
vention, but there Is no doubt the chief
vim is to have men in the convention who
will not do certain things rather than
have men pledged to certain propositions.
]t is stated that the l";njue will haw- no
men in Its convention who are In any
way pledged, and that it will not p
any of its candidates tor office. This, of
course, is an impossibility, because it is
well known that of necessity both the
convention and the candidates must be
pledged to something or there would be
no earthly reason for their being In spe
cial politics.
The purpose of the league la to secure
grood government anil also the carrying
out of needed Improvements. This is !
very proper. There is, however, no ax- ',
gumont yet put forth to show that these
came Republican wishers of pood govern
ment and Improvement could not carry
OUI their purposes inside of the party to
Which they belong. If they be strong
enough to carry out their platform in
dependency, they aro certainly strong!
enough to carry out a double purp
viz.. their plan of g.Â»,,i government and '
the purification of the Republican party,!
which they declare is badly needed.
There is. however, a very apparent r^a-
P'ih for th<-> activity shown at this time
Municipal League. It is simply
iliis: That there an- two Bets of men
anxious for office, and us they feur they
cannot agree on any Joint lin>> of action,
if they come together, they musi each
1; alone. An analysis of the personnel of
padershlp of the League and the Re
publican party proper bears out this Idea.
The leaders <>f the League are Giles, li.
Â«Jray, an old-time Republican, who is
ovÂ»-ii now lillir.fi- a s*at as ;< School Di
rector, being elected on the Republican
tlekf-i two years ago; John F. Towle, a
Councilman with :i u<Â«,>\ record, who two
years ago was a candidate before the Re
publican convention for Mayor; J. \V.
Nelson, a stanch Republican; Cary
Howard. ,\ Republican; Prank Mott, ;md
many other gentlemen whose Republican
ism is well known. There are just a few
who iiro not Republicans, and Colonel
Lyons, who was elected to a minor office
hist w.-'ok. is one "f these, although M Is
ovii whispered that the Colonel is back
In the ranks.
The League is pledged, or rather, its
practice provides for the appointment of
ites to a â  onvention, and this natur
ally draws toward it that wing of the [
Republican party favoring appointment, i
and also many candidates who would i
naturally desire the support of the !
On the other hand the recognized lead
ers of the party proper are mostly In
favor <>i' the Republican plan of the elec
tion of a convention at primaries. At the
head of these are W. R. Davis, Arthur H.
(Breed, president of the Republican
County Central Committee, and most of
the old-time Republican*!. These men re
fer to the recent experience of the Ban
Francisco Democracy with Its appointed
convention. So much suspicion was at
tached to thp work of tho Committee of
One Hundred that the downfall of
Jtp nomincs was very pronounced.
There is no nrod. however, to
po to San Francisco for an cx
iample of the pernicious effect of ap
pointing conventions. Oakland had one
two years npo and the result needs no
reference at this time.
One little incident that occurred at the
last city election shows clearly how im
perative it Is that there should not be a
single flaw in the nominees of a success
ful ticket. At the convention called by
the Committee of Twenty-one, F. M. Par
r-ells secured the nomination for Council
;jn;in from the Fifth Ward. The incumbent
â¢was Dr. W. O. Buckland, n hone.-n ofli
<â r.i] who should certainly nave been re
nominated. He was turned down by the
appointed delegates, not being wanted,
although there is little doubt that he
â would have won at a primary. He de
cided not to be thrust aside through the
â¢whim of delegates named by three men or
jposslbly less, so he made an independent
[campaign, and between his vote and the
Vote of Parcells, a Democrat, Aaron Fi
fcush. was elected In a district strongly
Itepubliean. This evil effect of appoint
ing delegates Is directly responsible for
the existence of the "solid six" and all Its
malodorous history in the City Council.
For reasons known to himself, but which
the water combine could easily explain,
Councilman Fibush resigned. Mayor
Thomas then appointed Major Woodward.
The Major made the sixth member of the
"solid six" and that is the reason why in
connection with his marvelous erudition
In drawing up water rate schedules he
has been regarded as the author of all the
unpleasantness of the past year. Had the
logical candidate from the Fifth Ward,
"Dr. Buckland, been nominated, he would
have been elected and the scandals of the
present administration would not have
been possible, for Oakland can feel per
fectly safe with six such men In her City
Council as Buckland, Cuvellier, Oirard,
Prlngle, Row and Upton. The turning
down of Buckland was not aJiogether an
accident; it was rather a clever part of
a clever scheme, put up by the water
combine and successfully carried out. and
would hardly have been carried out in
any other than an appointed convention.
The lossons to be learned from the scan
flals of the past two years would seem to
be that secrecy in the early stages of a
political campaign is not desirable. This
fremark applies at this time as forcibly to
the Municipal League as it did two years
ago to the secret meetings of the Com
mittee of Twenty-one. At the last meet
ing of the league A. B. Nye outlined a plan j
of campaign which contained theT^wments
of a first-class municipal platform. It is
true that there wi^re in his remarks some
references to State and national govern
ment which were not complimentary and
which have no place in municipal doc
trine. But on the whole Mr. Nye's ideas
were instructive and practical, and it
seemed a pity that they were not put
Into the hands of every voter in this city.
If such work as was done at the last
meeting of the League is typical of its
objects, there does not appear to be any
good reason why, as Mr. Nye expressed it,
"gentlemanly representatives of the
press" should n<>t be welcome. The public i
has a perfect right to know the various
stages leading up to the nomination of a j
ticket for which it is to be Importuned
to vote. Secrecy always breeds suspicion,
and the basis of a campaign of moral and
material reform and progress cannot be j
too broad or too generally known. The ,
League objected to Its being termed by its
political enemies. "the Dark-Lantern,
League." but there was some foundation
for such a name. During the past four
years far too much of Oakland's politics
have been done behind closed doors by :
private or eemi-r.-lipious organizations, i
There has been almost a revulsion of feel
ing In this regard during the past year
that was made very manifest at the re
cent election, and henceforth there will
always be genuine suspicion attached to ;
any organization or party clique, the ob^
Ject of which is entirely political and
which meets secretly to transact what is '
In reality public business.
There Is no foundation for the presump- I
tlon that the worthy gentlemen who com
prise the Municipal League are any more
capable of judging of what is good for the
rest of Oakland than those who are out
side the league. Every tax payer who
makes his periodical visits to the Tax
Collector and the water companies real
izes that the next city government will
not have to deal with the policy to be ob
served in regard to the Philippine Islands
or the government t)f Cuba, but they fully
appreciate the fact that they are dealing
with matters closer home. They know
that upon the integrity of the city gov
ernment depends the amount of money
each tax payer has to take out of his
pocket ana they realize that in this mat
ter honesty is even of more importance
than any other principle of a party. Con
sequently the city campaign must per
force resolve itself into a campaign or in
dividuals rather than parties, and the
ticket that guarantees the impossibility of
the next Cltv Council being resolved into
a "solid six r> will be the one that com
mends Itself to the confidence of the vot
ers, whether this ticket be nominated by
one section of the party or another.

RABBI VOORSANGER OFFICIATES AT
CORNERSTONE LAYING.
New Mount Zion
Hospital*
Handsome Building in
Course of Con
struction*
THE cornerstone of the new Mount
Zlon Hospital, on Slitter street,
near Scott, was laid yesterday
afternoon by Rabbi Voorsanger,
assisted by the officers of the Hospl
' to.l Assoeiatio 1. The interesting cere-
mony took place at I o'clock in the
afternoon, in the presence of fully 600
spectators, nearly all of whom were
more or less identified with the rais
ing of funds for the erection of the
edifice, which. In the language of Dr.
J. Nieto, is "A monument to God, dedi
cated to suffering humanity."
A feature of the exercises was the
musical programme rendered by the
Pacific Hebrew Orphan Asylum brass
band. Among the selections rendered
were "First Effort," "Albanian March,"
"America," "Hail Columbia" anu
"Yankee Doodle."
The services opened with a prayer by
Dr. M. S. Levy, followed by a brief ad
dress by President Joseph Branden
stetn of the Hospital Association. Dr.
Voorsanger then read a prepared
(statement of tho history of the asso
ciation from Its inception, November
3, 1887, to the present day. and appealed
to those present to come to the aid of
the hospital with liberal subscriptions
for Its support.. The historical manu

CRIME FIEND
HOUNDING HIM
TO HIS RUIN
A Bright Schoolboy
and a Forger.
ROY JONES IS A PUZZLE
HIS CASE PERPLEXES THE AU- i
TEORITIES.
His Guardian Applies to Have the I
Boy Sent to lone â Criminal In
stincts That He Is Un
able to Overcome.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 18.
Roy Jones, a pupil of the Swett School,
has cultivated forgery until he has almost
reached perfection in that crime, and his j
case is now puzzling the District Attorney j
and the police. There, are some good traits
in the boy's character, but the criminal
' tendencies predominate and he now faces
j either the lone Reform School or the Jail.
Roy's first attempts at forgery were
'Â practiced to cover up his absence from
! school. He soon learned his guardian's I
signature and then for nine days he ap- I
â  peared regularly with a note from hi 3 ;
guardian excusing his own absence. When |
this plan was discovered Roy seemed |
: really sorry and it was agreed that every :
; day he was at school he should be. given |
! a check, signed by the principal of the
Swett School, to take home. This worked
[ well for a time and a few days ago his ]
guardian was surprised, on calling at the.
school, to learn that Roy was frequently .
absent. An inspection of the checks j
Bhowed that many of them were very
il< ver forgeries. The boy had practiced
bo well that he could make a fac-simile of j
' the principal's signature.
The lad is absolutely truthful. ITe never
denies his doings. He freely confesses to !
Borrow and make* honest efforts to over
come the evil tendencies. He cannot re
sist the temptation to stenl. although he ]
does not practice deceit. Recently he stole j
: $.?0 and took home the material he pur
chased, at the same time admitting his j
â  act. He appears to be as much grieved as
hfs relatives. He has an irresistible desire '
jto purchase games, and with his last j
script was then placed in a zinc box,
together with copies of all the Jewish
and dally newspapers of San Fran
cisco, lists of all the. Hebrew organiza
tions In the city, with the names of
their officers, tho names of the mem
bers of the Ladies' Auxiliary and of
the hospital staff and nurses, and
United States coins of the year IS9B.
The box was deposited in the cavity
beneath the cornerstone, the latter was
placed in position and the cement
packed around it with an ordinary
mason's trowel wielded by Dr. Voor
sanger, while the Inspiring strains of
"America" were poured forth by the
young and enthusiastic musicians.
After the laying of the stone an ad
dress was delivered by Dr. J. Nieto
and the ceremony was concluded with
a prayer by Dr. Myers.
The new hospital will be a hand-
Fume structure of colonial architec
ture. 90x137!4, and two stories In
hoight. The hospital will be thor
oughly equipped with every modern
booty he bought ten. When he has them
home he shows no desire to play with
3. re not contlnunl . but brtrflk out &t inter*
vals. The boy is kind, not vicious nor ma
licious and is always obedient, except
when by himself and there is some
temptation around. His parents are
well off, but their duties keep them trav
eling, and their boy was sent to Oakland
to be educated. There is a feeling that it
would not be proper to send such a boy
to lone, and an effort will first be made
to send him on a long whaling trip, where
his surroundiner will be novel and where
temptations will be few.
WATER FRONT SURPRISE.
Oakland's Attorneys Clrfim to Have
Discovered a New Point.
OAKLAND, Dec. 18.â The great water
front controversy may be reopened along
new lines. The attorneys for the city filed
their first brief yesterday and it contains
some new matter that may alter the en
tire complexion of the recent decision of
the Supreme Court.
The brief refers largely to the manner
in which the city dedicated streets to the
tide line. It is asserted that the dedicat
ing ordinances "come within the principle,
inherent in the character of the property,
that where a public street is brought to
the shore of a navigable water, the way
does not stop at high tide. For beyond
lies the ocean highways, already dedi
cated by nature to public uses; and the
intent and purpose of declaring a public
highway to the shore is to reach out to
and make a union with, the dedication
which nature baa made of the navigable
waters as a. public highway."
<"' nn!ng finally to the most important
argument advanced the brief says of the
matter of acceptance: "When the city
by these legislative acts declared so dis
tinctly its intention to carry its streets
out to the navigable waters of the bay,
it is idle to talk of the necessity of show
ing acceptance of a dedication, for two
controlling reasons." The first of these
is that acceptance was not necessary, and
the second that acceptance was Involved
in the dedication.
These contentions will have to be passed
upon by Judge Ogden, and should he
hold them to be good the case may have
to be, in a great measure, retried.
KAMP'S ACTIONS UPHELD.
City Trustees Take No Stock in
Hoeck's Charges.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 18.â The Police Com
mittee of the City Trustees have disposed
of the charges filed by Jacob Hoeck
against Officer Albert Kamp. Their de
cision was that the charges were un
worthy of consideration. Hoeck accused
Kan*p of giving information to a Call re
porter concerning the incarceration by
Hoeck of his two little sons. It was
shown that Kamp only allowed the re
porter to interview the boys after he
produced an order from the City Marshal.
Kamp stated at the investigation that had
he known the circumstances of the 'boys'
Imprisonment and the fact that no charge
had been placed against them he would
not have kept them In jail, even tllough
their father insisted they should be
locked in separate cells. The Trustees
told him that under the circumstances
they would have upheld his actions if he
had set them free. Hoeck said the Mar
shal's order to Kamp had been written
to protect, the officer after the charges
were tiled. In reply to this Kamp called
Hoeck a "dirty cur," and Marshal Rogers
said he would treat him to personal pun
ishment if he was not an old man.

THE TUG RELIEF.
She is now stationed in the Columbia River, but is coming to San Fran
cisco to have new boilers put in and be thoroughly overhauled. She
will then go into service on the bay. The tug Rescue leaves to-day
to take the place of the Relief in Oregon waters.
DECK OF THE
TRAINING SHIP
ADAMS SPRUNG
Boys "Marking Time"
Did the Damage.
TWO MORE TUGS FOR THE BAY
THE NEW FEARLESS AND THE
RELIEF FROM PORTLAND.
Runaway Son of Baron Pflugk Com
ing Here as an Ordinary Seaman
on the Ship William
Mitchell.
The United States training ship Adams
Is not likely to go to Samoa or any port
far away from home. She may go to
Magdalona Bay for gun practice, but the
authorities may not even allow her to go
that far. Her spar deck beams have
opened up and other defects have showed
themselves, so the vessel is not now con
sidered safe for a long voyage.
The Adams went into commission nearly
three months ago, and 200 naval appren
tices were put aboard her from the re
ceiving ship Independence. Her guns had
not arrived from the East, so the vessel
came down from Mare Island and an
chored on the easterly side of Goat Isl
and It was thought that she would only
be there for a week or so, as her arma
ment was daily expected from the East.
The guns have not arrived as yet, how
ever and no ono seems to know when
they' will get here. In the meantime the
apprentice boys havu been drilled dail>,
and that is what has caused the dam-
"x'wo hundred of them on the spar deck
marking time at the double quicK causes
the old sloop-or-war to tremble from stem
to stern, and the result is the starting of
the deck beams. The chances are that
when the cannon arrive the Adams will
go outside for gun practice, and then re
turn to Mare Island for an overhauling,
if however, the stamping of 2uO boys
causes the deck beams to open, what will
the concussion from the firing of the guns
ao to the vessel?
The apprentice boys thoroughly enjoy
their life aboard the training ship, lhey
llke their officers, are well fed and well
treated and in consequence there has not
been a' single desertion since the vessel
went into commission.
The British ship W llliam Mitchell,
which is coming here from Hlago, Japan,
to load wheat for Europe, win lose one
of her crew as soon as she reaches port.
Herman yon Pflugk, the runaway son of
a German Baron, is on board of her as
an ordinary sailor, and aa his father
wains him at home the chances are that
he will go back to Germany from San
Francisco. ,
In March last the "William Mitchell was
in Antwerp, preparing to leave for the
United States in ballast. Young Pflugk
had run away from his home in Hamburg,
taking with him 200 marks (.about $su;,
and had made his way to Antwerp. There
he made the acquaintance of some Ger
man sailors, who had shipped aboard the
William Mitchell. There was no vacancy
on the ship, so the sailors stowed him
away and when the ship had cleared the
Scheldt River they brought him before
the mate, who set him to work. Pflugk
could not speak a word of English, but by
the time the vessel reached Philadelphia
he could make himself understood in any
company. Captain Cutting took a great
liking to the handsome 16-year-old lad,
and when he refused point blank to go
home saying he would ship on another
vessel if he couldn't go on the Mitchell,
he shipped him as an ordinary seaman
for the voyage to Hiogo. Japan, and
thence to San Francisco. Baron Pflugk
has cot on the track of his son and heir,
however, and the boy will bo persuaded
to so home via New York from San Fra.ll-
C fna month or so the Spreckels towboat
company will have its force of tugs reor
ganized. The taking of the Fearless.
Active and Vigilant into thp Government
service left the concern with only two
tugs to handle Its large business, so
another boat had to be chartered. The
new Fenrles* now being built by the Union
Iron Works is soon to be launched and
the Relief is coming here for good from
the Columbia River. This will give the
company the Fearless, Relief, Reliance
and Alert, four of the finest tugs on the
Pacific, with which to handle its business.
The Relief has been under charter for a
long time to the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company. That company is
now having completed for it, at the Union
Iron Works, a steel tug that will take the
place of the Relief. She will be called the
Wallowa and is almost a duplicate of the
Fearless. Both tugs are being built side
by side. New boilers have been built for
the Relief and she is to come hero at
once and have them put in. At the same
time she will receive a thorough over
hauling and will go into commission on
the bay again. The tug Rescue, Captain
Dan Thompson, will sail to-day for the
Columbia River to relieve the Relief.
The landing float at the foot of Folsom
street suffered during the norther. It he
came waterlogged and now if there is any
kind of a sea on people using it get wet
feet. It is to be pumped out and put in.
first class repair again in a few days.
The Japanese who came from ciijipprton
Island on the steamer Alice Blanchard
refuse to leave the vessel unless to land in
San Francisco. They were taken to
Clipperton from Honolulu and the Im
migration Commissioner refuses to land
them on the ground that they are con
tract laborers. The Japs are going to fight
the case and in the meantime the steam
ship company will have to feed and house
the natives.
The old whaling bark Mermaid, that
made a trip to Kotzobue Sound last spring:
with gold hunters, is to bp fitted out for
another cruise in the Arctic. She was
purchased by B. H. Madison and she will
go whaling in place of the schooner Ro
sario that was wrecked. The steam whaler
Alexander, that came in clean, is also
being fitted out for another cruise.
MUSIC BY THE BLIND.
Sacred Concert Given by the Pupils
of the State Institution.
BERKELEY, Dec. 18.â A large audience
gathered this afternoon at the State In
stitution for the Deaf and Dumb and
Blind to listen to the concert given by the
blind pupils. The concert wan held in the
assembly hall of the institution, under the
direction of Otto Fleissner, director of
music. All of the numbers given were
from sacred pieces, and their rendition by
the blind pupils, both in technique and
expression, was thoroughly artistic. The
whole programme showed very careful
training on the part of the yuung musi
cians, and reflected much credit on the
institution's musical department.

MRS. BOTKIN'S
TRIAL DRAWS
NEAR ITS END
Attorneys for Both the Prosecu
tion and the Defense Profess
to Be Satisfied.
The Accused Woman Is the Star Boarder
at the Jail, and Has Unusual Privi
leges Unknown to the Sheriff.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin -will eat her Christ
mas dinner where prison bars cast no dis
turbing shadows if the men who are mak
ing her legal battle can break down the
strong testimony of the. witnesses for the
prosecution, as they claim to be able to
do.
Of those who have already appeared on
the stand, Mrs. Harris, who sold the
handkerchiefs, has given them the most
concern, and they will leave nothing un
done to shake her convincing statements.
They affirm that the records of the City
of Paris disclose no delivery of the hand
kerchiefs and that in addition the sys
tem of securing the addresses of custom
ers is different from that she described.
Mrs. Ruoff, the former nurse and com
panion of Mrs. Botkin, was so severe in
her arraignment of her that it is thought
by the attorneys to have detracted from
the force of her testimony. They claim
also that no one but a writing teacher or
an expert on handwriting would make
vise of the technical terms that flowed so
glibly from her tongue when she identic
fled the exemplars of writing as having
be< i) the work of Mrs. Botkin. According
to their ideas the average person does not
know anything about "muscular recoil,"
"arm and linger movements" and similar
terms applied to handwriting. The prose
cution believes that nothing can shake
Mrs. Ruoffs testimony, much of which
will be given added strength by what
John P. Dunning will disclose as to the re
iations existing at one time between him
self and the woman now on trial for her
life.
Here again the defense finds hope. It
will bend all its energies toward im
poaching Dunning. To that end the at
torneys have subpenaed the managers and
editors of the various papers, and through
them claim they will show that his repu
tation for truth, honesty and integrity is
not good. It is possible that there will
be a fluttering among the dove cotes at
the reporters' tallies, as the men and
wi mci; working there may be asked to
add what knowledge they possess in the
premises to that contributed by the heads
of departments. The attorneys for the
defense profess to anticipate much satis
faction from their cross-examination of
Mi^s LJvernash, a reporter. She obtained,
they affirm, all tho information she pos
9, under a pledge of Becrecy and by
making strange admissions to Mrs. Botkin,
condoning her violation of the laws of
morality. They will lay baje the methods
used by a certain class of reporters in
getting their Btories.
The case is expected to run its course
rapidly this week. This morning the
prosecution will commence to put on the
stand its last witnesses, with possibly
a chance of concluding before the time
for adjournment this afternoon. The
witnesses will include the handwriting ex
perts, Jjunning and Miss Livernash. It
will not require long to present the infor
mation they possess before the jury. The
time will be consumed by the rigid cross
examination, through which the attorneys
f<T Mrs. Botkin will take at least two of
these witnesses. They are fighting for a
human life and in keeping with the trust
reposed in them by their client will light
desperately, not sparing the feelings of
the person sitting in the inquisitorial
chair.
The defense expects to require but a
trifle over two days with its witnesses and
then will come the arguments. It has not
been definitely determined, but it is
thought that Attorney General R. C.
V.'hite of Delaware will make the opening
argument for the prosecution, Mr. Hos
tner closing for the people
For the defense George Knight, Sena
tor Frank McGowan and Attorney Whee
ler will all take part in the argument and
try to create in the minds of the jurymen
that "reasonable doubt," which means to
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin the difference be
tween acquittal and conviction, life and
death. If the case goes on as expeditious
)y as is expected, the question of Mrs.
Botkin's guilt or innocence should be in
the hands of the jury to determine by
Friday or Saturday, if Judge Cook would
hold court on that day. the end of the
trial being in sight. Mrs. Botkin is now
on trial for the murder of Mrs. Dunning
and there will still hang over her the
charge of taking the life of Mrs. Doane
The rapidity with which the trial is
proceeding is duo to the respect the attor
neys on both sides have for the ability
fund fairness of Judge Carroll Cook. There
have been no arguments on either side re
tarding decisionH on questions of law
with a vacillating Judso the clever men
who represent Mrs. Botkin would try to
bring him over to their side on all ques
tions raised. There is no hesitation on the
tort r,f Judge Cook, hence no arguments.
Mr has presided over the proceedings with
nignlty befitting the trial cf a woman ftÂ»r
her lif.-. throwing a certain solemnity over
the rase frnni the start.
Mrs. Botkin is the star boarder at the
Branch County Jail, out near Ingleside
She has won the favor of Dan Boyle' the
latter in charge, and has in consequence
Ihe run of the house. She has a cell t6
norsoir ami has adorned it with articles . f
her own that tako from it the prison look
\\ nen she first went tliore she askfd
Sheriff Whelan for a separate room on the
tipper Moor of the jail, but this was de
nied.
The Sheriff received his first intimation
ps to Mrs. Botkin s illness Saturday from
He Call, yesterday. He was angry t ha"
po important a prisoner should he so ill
bs to require the attention of a physlcan.

learn that, contrary to prison regulations,
Mrs. Botkin was permitted to use the
prison telephone. She has been in the
habit of entering the- room where the tele-
phone is located, and intimating that she
desired to carry on a private conversa

room and leave her alone. Mm. Rotkin is
on the same footing as other prisoners,
according to Sheriff Whelan, and she has

SEEKS POLICE PROTECTION.
W. B. Harrington, a Botkin Juror,
Shadowed by Unknown Men.
Willard B. Harrington, one of the jurors
just now sitting to decide for the life or
death of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin and presi
dent of the Merchants' Club, has applied
to Chief Lees for police protection against
three men who have since last Wednesday
night dogged his -ootsteps to his Sacra
mento street home and who have several
time approached him in a menacing atti
tude. He fears .that they in .end some at
tempt upon his life or upon his safety at
least, and his request to the Chief is for
protection against some such act.
Mr. Harrington could furnish â¢ to the
police nothing more than a good general
description of the men who have so per
sistently followed him. Their names he
does not know, though he is of the opin
ion that one of them he has seen before;
where, ho cannot remember. Nor can he
account for any reason why h* should be
followed or why he has been several times
so openly menaced by them.
His application for police protection was
made in Judge Carroll Cook's court room
on Thursday afternoon of last w-eek,
shortly after the Botkin case had been
continued for the day and the rest of the
lurors had Bled out to their homes. Mr.
Harrington remained behind and through
â¢ 'lerk Tulle sent word to Chief Lees that
he had something to say to him. Judge
Cooks injunctions to the jury had been
so Imperative against communication
with outsiders that Chief Lees hesitated
at granting the request ana called Judge
Cook to ask his permission. Judge Cook
Bald that he thought it would be perfectly
proper but advised him that any.conver
sation should be held in the court room in
the presence of the few w..0 remained,
i bat no suspicions might attach to the
proceeding. Upon this Mr. Harrington
explained the circumstances of the case
and gave his reasons for asking police
P He e said n that on the previous night after
c 1. -ft tin- jury room he had tnkon the
i'ar for his home at 1118 Sacramento
street but was obliged to turn aside at
an alley through'which it is his custom
to pass by a man who stood in the en
trance and menacingly blocked his way.
He apprehended no harm at first, but
alter he had made his way a hundred feet
or so down the lane he looked around
and found that he was being followed by
the person who had first stopped him,
and that a companion of equally unpre
possessing appearance had joined him.
They followed closely at his heels until
he emerged on Sacramento street, where
be found another of the gang almost at
the door of his house. The fellow moved
away slowly as Mr. Harrington ap
proached, but subjected him to a close
scrutiny. After he entered the house the
three men joined forces and after loiter
ing about the neighborhood for some time
longer went away down the street.
Mr. Harrington described their appear
ance and his experience to his wife, and
she told him she had noticed the same
men loitering in the vicinity during the
day and had been made nervous by the
way in which they eyed the house. Mr.
Harrington's experience lias been repeat
ed several times since, and though as
yet no open threat has been made against
him he says he does not care to take the
chance of a blow or so from a sand bag,
and has again appealed to the police.
The department is at a loss to account
for the peculiar persecution of one of the
jurors on an important case. Coming
with the well founded reports that the
Jury has been expressing itself rather
more freely of its opinions on the case
than Judge Cook's Injunctions allow, the
police are inclined to put two and two
together, and Mr. Harrington's case with
the others will be thoroughly investigat
ed. In its Investigation the police are
hampered by the prohibition against
speaking with the jurymen, but are pur
suing it along other lines, and some sen
sational and tangible results are looked
for.

SLAYER STARTS
FOR TENNESSEE
Rosser Goes to Meet
His Mother.
FATHER ACCOMPANIES HIM
MOCKERY OF JUSTICE AS METED
OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO.
Family of the Murdered Man Declare
the Verdict Is a Disgrace â Sis
ter Tells of Peculiar
Methods.
Walter Rosser, the Tennessee volunteer
whose acquittal of the murder of Henry
Hilderbrand by a jury of San Francisco
citizens of presumed intelligent is de
nounced on all sides as the most disgrace
ful miscarriage of justice in the history
of the city, departed for his home Satur
day ' afternoon, accompanied by his
father, W. Rosser, who came here to save
his son from the hangman's noose or a
felon's cell. They go to rejoin the wait
ing wife and mother whose unfamiliarity
with the manner of treating murderers in
California has doubtless caused her many
sleepless nights and endless worry, for
fear her boy might be compelled to pay
the penalty of his coldblooded crime on
the gallows.
In a modest flat at 535 Turk street the
young widow of the murdered man
mingles her tears with those of his aged
mother. The other immediate relatives of
the victim of Rosser's bullet, his father,
Bister and two brothers, have momentarily
forgotten their grief in his untimely death
in their righteous" indignation at the pre-

posterous verdict that allowed his slayer
to go scott free. They did not demand the
life of their brother's slayer, but they did
ask for justice, and they regard the an
swer to their prayers as a mockeryâ a
sarcastic echo which seems to deride the
supposition that there is any such thing
as justice in the metropolis of the Pacific
Coast.
If the story of Miss Lilly Hilderbrand is
to be believed, and her veracity has never
been questioned, there are many peculiar
things in connection with the trial of
Rosser that need explaining- Her con
clusions may be biased, It is true, but the
facts from which they are drawn reflect
no credit on those whose sworn duty it
is to Bee thiit strict justice is done to all.
Miss Hildorbrand thought. she had a right
to demand that the slayer of her brother
should be punished. She so informed As
sistant District Attorney Hinkle, who had
charge of the case, whtn sup went to him
to ask that he subpena certain witnesses
whose testimony might have penetrated
the understanding of even a jury of the
mental caliber possessed by the twelve
men sitting in judgment on the evidence.
She was given to understand that her
sim^t-stions were regarded as interference
and was plainly told that District Attor
ney Barnes' deputy did not propose to
ask for a continuance to enable him to
secure new witnesses, for fear the trial
might go over until the new year, and he
wanted the "honor" of trying it himself
before he went out of office.
"He would not allow our attorney to
assist in the prosecution or have anything
to do with the case," said Miss Hilder
brand last evening. "I wanted him to
summon witnesses to prove that Rosser
had been released from the guardhouse on
the morning of the shooting, after a
month's confinement there for offenses
against military discipline; also to prove
that he had tried to shoot a private in
the Tennessee regiment before the regi
ment came to California, and that he was
of a quarrelsome disposition. Mr. Hinkle
said he could not do that, as he was not
allowed to introduce testimony an to the
prisoner's character on special occasions
as that would be no proof of his natural
disposition. The fact, in my opinion, is
that Hinkle was acting under instructions
from District Attorney Barnes, whose
rather, General Barnes, was attorney for
Rosser I told Mr. Hinkle that it w-as a
case of father and son standing together
ami I am more than ever convinced that
I was right in my surmise.
Ji BB v*u * c^ cn T with the evidence that was
Introduced I cannot see how the Jury
could return such a verdict. It was shown
that Rosser shot my brother deliberately
without provocation, and without giving
him a chance to defend himself. There
was no evidence to show that he was
drugged; lie was simply drunk and had
been walking up and down in the market
swearing and using vile language for
some time before he killed my brother "
"He had murder In his heart that day "
interrupted old Mrs. Hilderbrand sadly
"and if he had not killed my poor boy he
would have killed somebody else."
Yesterday was the third anniversary of
Henry Hilderbrand's wedding and a sad
anniversary it was for the young widow
scarcely more than a girl in years. The
6-year-old mite, Marie, whom the young
couple had adopted, has been taken into
the family of the elder Hilderbrand and
the widow is also with them at present.
Her husband had made no provision for
her in the way of insurance, as he was
hoarding his earnings with the expecta
tion of going into business next year on
a small scale. It has been reported that
a collection amounting to $2500 had been
subscribed for the widow, but the report
was unfounded, as was the report that
the family of the murdered man had con
sented not to prosecute the case against
Rosser In consideration of the payment of
LED FOR THE JAW AND LOST
Captain Rottanzi Mixes It With Andy Law
rence and Changes Hats.
ANDY LAWRENCE, whose proud boast it is that he has risen (or fallen)
from "peanut butcher" to managing editor of the Examiner, has felt
the fist of Captain Rottanzi nestling up against his jaw, and now Andy
is boasting of his great victory over the doughty warrior. It was rank
foolishness on the part of the captain to attempt to make any impression
on Lawrence's jaw. Had he shot for any other portion of his adversary's
anatomy he might have accomplished his laudable intention of inflicting
some punishment, but to shoot a fist not encased in a boxing glove against
such a jaw could only result one wayâ the fist suffered.
The encounter took place in the Orpheum annex last night, and was all
too short to satisfy the spectators. Captain Rottanzi was standing at the bar
with George Fuller Golden when Lawrence entered the place with Police
Lieutenant Fred Esola. Rottanzi saw the editor come in and made for him,
at the same time shouting:
"I've been looking for you, and now you must settle with me for your vil
lainous attacks on me."
With that he cut loose his right, landed on Andy's jaw, but only succeeded
in putting his own hand out of business. Lawrence closed in and the two
tumbled about the floor until Esola and others pulled them apart.
Then Lawrence took a mean advantage of the warrior. While both were
tightly held at a safe distance apart he set his jaw to work as only the Law
rence jaw cart get busy.
"You're a thief," shouted Lawrence, "and a disgrace to your father. I'll
roast you in my paper harder than you've ever been roasted yet."
Lawrence paused a moment to get a fresh start, and at that instant saw
his hat lying on the floor. Rottanzi also discovered his battered headgear
kicking about at the same time, and both grabbed simultaneously for their
tiles. Now, it happens that both heads are of the same caliber, and the hats
having a striking resemblance, owing to their rough treatment among the
echoing war whoops, neither combatant noticed that he had possessed him
self of the other's property, but clapping the wreck upon his crown each man
permitted himself to be led away.
To-day there will be an exchange, not of challenges, but of tiles.
the sum of $5000. That sum may have been
spent to secure tho remarkable verdict,
but no member of the family of the de

Rosser, the father of Hilderbrand's slayer,
is said to be worth $150,000, or was before
the trial.

HER REMAINING YEARS
NOT WORTH THE LIVING
Rosina Klaiber, an Aged Woman, Ends Her Life by
Hanging Herself in a Toilet at Golden
Gate Park*
Rosina Klaiber, 60 years of age, reached the conclusion that the few years of
life remaining were not worth the living and some time Saturday night com
mitted suicide by hanging herself in a ladies' toilet at Golden Gate Park.
While making his rounds of the various buildings in the Park yesterday
morning Park Policeman John O'Shea found the body of a woman hanging from
the door of the ladies 1 lavatory near the peacock paddock. The body was rigid
and cold, death having evidently occurred several hours before the discovery.
A piece of strong woolen skirt braid was tied around some ornamental work
above the door and the other end made fast about the woman's neck. Her *eet
were so close to the ground that by standing on her tiptoes the unfortunate wo
man could have saved herself from strangulation.
The Coroner's office was notified and Deputy Coroner Tyrrell and Messenger
Tom Smith went to the Park and removed the body to the Morgue, where an ex
amination was made of the clothing and effects, in the hope of ' identification.
The woman was fairly well dressed and wore three gold and two silver rings!
Engraved on the inside of one was the name "Eugene." and on a gold cuff-but
ton were the initials "W. O. J." Further than this there was nothing to tell who-,
the woman was.
The body remained unidentified all day. Several persons visited the Morgue
and viewed the remains, but were unable to identify them. Late last night Mrs
Emma Wantel. proprietress of the Crystal Palace lodging house, at 533 Broadway
was taken to the Morgue by a friend, and when she viewed the body she identi
fied it as that of a woman who roomed at her house. Mrs. Wantel has only been
keeping the house a few days and could not give the name of the dead woman
The former owner was Mrs. Jean Meier, who resides at 537 rowell street. When"
the place changed hands the dead woman owed two months' rent for the room
she occupied and the bill was turned over to Mrs. Wantel for collection.
Saturday morning the woman, who had been afflicted with rheumatism for
some time, left the house about 9 o'clock. She told Mrs. Wantel that she would
return sodn and pay her the money she owed. That was the last seen of her in
the house.
A man who refused to give his name called at the Crystal P*alace about 7
o'clock last evening and wished to remove the trunks of Rosina Klaiber Mrs
at that time did not know that her lodger was dead and the man did not
say anything of the woman's death. The lodging-house keeper refused to let the
man take the trunks. She asked him why he wanted them, and he replied that
it was at the request of another man whose name he refused to give
Deputy Coroner Hallett took possession of the woman's trunks last night and
among the papers found was a fire insurance policy on some property in Ger
many which is owned by the woman. From this the name was learned
Mr. Meier, the husband of the former landlady of the Crystal Paiace says
the woman returned from a visit to Germany about five months ago and took a
room at the lodging house. She seemed to have a number of friends anad until
two months ago paid her rent regularly. For the past week she seemed despond
ent, bo her friends say, and it is thought that lack of money caused her to de
stroy herself.

upon to resign before the present board
quits office.
A young lady teacher under White s
supervision has brought charges against
him that place him in the same class that
the over-gallant Major Moore of the
Treasury Department has been placed by
the allegations of his blonde and hand
some typewriter.
The first hint of scandal at the Spring
Valley institution did not come to the
ears of the Directors until the first of the
present month, when one of the teachers
â who had got leave of absence. on Novem
ber 1 because of nervous prostration ap
plied for an extension of thirty days. It
was known that she was well enough to
teach, and an investigation immedi
ately set on foot. Nothing was developed
until a week ago, when through Director
Carew she applied to the chairman of
the proper committee for a transfer to
some other school. As she gave no reason
for her request the Directors were in
clined not to grant it. and Mr. Carew
was forced to explain the whole case.
According to the charges made to him
by the teacher, the last several months
that she was employed under White he
made her life a misery by his persistent
attentions. Upon every pretext and upon
every possible occasion, she said, he
would call her into his office for no other
purpose whatever than to lavish smiles
and bestow more than fatherly atten
tions. As time progressed his attentions
and intentions became more marked. Hia
victim had declined to longer heed his
calls to his office, so she said he sought
her out in her classroom during the re
cess and after school had been dismissed.
Under the strain of his persecution her
health began to fall, and finally she col
lapsed and was confined to her home for
a month with nervous prostration. At
the end of the month she made the re
quest for an extension that resulted In
the discovery of the state of affairs.
Every effort will be made before the
present board gives way to its successors
to find a vacancy for her in some other
school, where her brunette beauty will not
tempt to her undoing.
Her personal friends among the Direc
tors intend to bring the matter formally
before the board in a few days and will
demand White's resignation as the price
of his conduct.
The accused principal is one of the
fancy salaried employes of the depart
ment. With the $175 per month that he
has been the recipient of he has built
himself up an independent income, and is
beyond the need of his monthly stipend.
He is a man of large family, and is as
well known as any one in the department.
He has as yet been given no opportunity
by the Directors to say what he may
have in defense of himself or to deny the
allegations that have been made against
him. The members of the board who
have heard of his alleged transgressions,
however, are convinced of their truth, as
the young lady who makes them is of
excellent character and good family, and
with the influence that is at her com
mand the investigation that has started
will not flag.
AT THE PABK AND CLIFF.
Owing to the Cold Weather the
Crowds Were Unusually Small.
The crowds at the park and cliff yester
day were the smallest of the year. Al
though the sun shone during the greater
part of the day, the air was biting cold
and the majority of people chose to spend
Sunday by their firesides. No accidents
occurred to dull the little enjoyment there
was to be had, and in consequence the
police and hospital attendants were con
tented.
A large crowd gathered at the Chutes
to witness Emil Markeberg, "the hero of
the burning balloon," make an ascension.
Ihe balloon was cut away just at 5
o'clock and with the daring aeronaut
turning in the trapeze, sped two thousand
feet toward the clouds. There was not
a breath of wind blowing at that time and
Markeberg landed just outside the
grounds with his parachute, while the
balloon fell on top of the shooting gal
lery in the Chutes grounds.
A good-sized crowd of pleasure-seekers
also visited Sutro's Baths. The aquatic
contests were entertaining, if not exciting.
Following are the results: Fifty-yard
novice, H. Anderson first, D. O'Hare sec
ond; fifty-yard juvenile, D. Harris first, C.
