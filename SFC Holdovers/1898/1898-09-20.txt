VCLUME LXXXIV.-NO 112.
COLONEL DAN BURNS
ON M. H. DE YODNG
Declares the Wonld-Be Senator Can Only Win
by the Aid of a "Sack" and a
Popular Upheaval.
The Proprietor of the Chronicle Was Told That His Position
in Politics Was Prejudicial to the Best Interests
of the Republican Party,
"Before M. H. d^ Young can expect
to be elected United States Senator
there will have to be an upheaval of
the people In his favor â and from my
kpetrledge of the feelings of the peo
p'fe toward Mr. de Young I am free to
Bay that such an upheaval will never
occur."
Such is the expressed belief of Colonel
Dan Burns regarding the Senatorial
aspirations of M. H. de Young. The
colonel had much more to say on the
same subject and particularly with
reference to his alleged support of the
after-dark canvass that is being made
by the proprietor of the Chronicle In
his efforts to stalk the Senatorship.
The colonel is not usually given to flat
tery and what he had to say about De
Young was certainly not flattering to
that gentleman or to his political pre
tensions. In fact quite the contrary
was the case.
Colonel Burns declared that De Young
was a man whose position in politics
had been such as to be injurious to the
interests of the party; that he had not
the confidence or respect of the masses
of the people; that he was so unpopular
that the knowledge that a candidate
for the legislature favored De Young
for United States Senator would be suf
ficient to defeat that candidate; that
the only way that he could become
Senator was by the use of money in
purchasing the support of legislative
nominees; that his Senatorial aspira
tions were only a "noise in the bush"
and nothing more. In other words the
colonel so expressed himself as to lead
to the conclusion that he believes De
Young to be a "false aJarm" of the (
- ,-r\- WtffSt dr-srnptron, as well as a
man -whose political ambitions, while
excusable, are not complimentary to
the Intelligence of the voters of the !
State.
Colonel Burns' sermon on De Young
and the Senatorshlp was suggested by
a query put to him relative to the an
nouncement made earlier in the day
that De Young had appointed Burns
.and -I.C. Meyers, a member of the State
Ceneral Committee, as his political
managers and head promoters of his
under-coyer Senatorial boom. Mr. de
Young was asked as to the truth of the
statement, but declined to be inter
viewed on that or any other political
subject.
"I never allow myself to be Inter
viewed on political subjects," he said,
"for the reason that I have a paper of
my own and when I wish to make my
views public I do so through its col
umns."
While this seems to be a very good
position to be in still it is not expected
that in this instance the circulation of
the Chronicle will be materially In
creased by reason of a rush of buyers
who are anxious to be let in to the De
Young confidence.
With Colonel Burns the case in dif
ferent. He has no newspaper and does
not want one. But he has views on
political questions which he keeps to
himself â and also on the subject of De
Young's Senatorial aspirations â which
he is willing shall be printed in any
old newspaper. So it was that when
he was told of the announcement that
he and Meyers had been appointed to
take charge of De Young's Senatorial
boom he had something to say and
said it.
"I do not know who has made such
an announcement," he said, "and do
not care. All I have to say about it is
that it Is a He. I am not making De
Young's fight nor do I expect to make
It. So far as I know he has no fight,
and if he had I do not think there is
one chance in a thousand for him to
â win. I do not think the people want
him as United &^vs Senator and I
do not bÂ°lieve they would vote for any
legislative candidate who was known
to be in favor of him for Senator.
"So far as my personal preference is
concerned I favor a man who has noth
ing in common with De Young; but I
told that man as I have told others
that I did not intend to interest mybelf
In any way in anything except to do
what I can to secure the election of the
Republican State ticket.
"Some time ago I went to Mr. De
Young and told him that his position
In politics whs prejudicial to the best
interests of the Republican party; that
If he was a candidate fur United States
Senator he should come out in the open
and Bay so, and that if he was not a
candidate he should also make a pub
lic declaration to that effect. I told him
what all of his so-calltd friends have
been too co-wardly to tel! him; that his
political standing in the community
precluded the possibility cf his election
to the United States Senatorship.
"As a result of that and -mother con
ference which occurred a few days
later Mr. De Young wrote and publish
ed the statement that he is not a can
didate for the Senatorshlp. 1 presumed
that settled it. but now it appears that
there is a quibble about, the wording of
the letter; and tho assertion is being
made that De Young is hard at work
pledging the support of legislative
candidates. I do not believe taat this
is true, but if it is true that he is a
candidate and that he 1b attempting
to pledge legislative candidates, he Is
The San Francisco Call
chasing a forlorn hope. Before he can
expect to be elected United States Sen
ator there will have to be an upheaval
of the people In his favorâ and from
my knowledge of the feelings of the
people toward him I am free to say
that such an upheaval will never occur.
"The only chance De Young has to
secure the Senatorship Is to spend a
lot of money In securing the election
of legislative candidates who would
support him after their election. I do
not believe he intends to do this. My
beliof is that De Young's candidacy
is only a noise In the bush. I am free
to say that it does not frighten me.
"As I said before, the only chance
De l^ung has) is in an upheaval of the
people in his favor. I have lived in Cali
fornia a goodiy number of years and so
far have failed to witness any such an
upheaval unless there was a big sack
behind it."
Dr. R. C. Meyers denies that he has
received any notice of his appointment
as one of De Young's political man
agers. He says that he has not seen
either Colonel Burns or Mr. De Young
for many days and that he has never
been approached on the subject by
them or any one else.

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1898.
FREED FROM
HER BONDS
California Will Now Have
Another Road Across
the Continent.
The days of a single railroad "czaro
cracy" In this State are passed and
now California will be enfranchised.
Yesterday afternoon a legal document
was filed with the County Clerk which
In its importance and momentous con
sequences to the people of this State is
without an equal. The four pages of
type written matter tell a story of a
new transcontinental railroad with a
terminus at San Francisco nnd connec
SIGNATURES WHICH READ EMANCIPATION.
tions that will make it possible for the
people of California to communicate di
rectly with all Eastern points.
The name of the new corporation is
the Bakersfleld and Los Aneeles Rail
way Company. Five men comprise the
incorporation. They are Claus Spreck
els, John D. Spreckels, A. B. Spreckels,
Robert Watt and A. H. Payson.
These men will constitute the board of
directors of the new company and I. W.
Hellman is the treasurer elected by the
five subscribers.
The capital stock of the new Bakers
field and Los Angeles Railway .Cotn
pany is fixed at $5,000,000, which is di
vided into 50,000 shares at the par value
of $100 each. Of these 50,000 shares 2200
have been actually subscribed for,
which represents $220,000. Each of the
five directors has made a subscription
of $44,000.
The new line will be constructed from
Bakersfleld over the Tejon Pass
straight through to Los Angeles. The
estimated length of the road is 200
miles. The surmises ventured as to the
direction of the new road from Bakers
field were all incorrect as Mojave will
not be touched. The most direct route
possible has been selected for the new
road. According to the articles of in
corporation the Bakersfield and Los
Angeles Railway Company will be con
structed _ from Bakersfield in Kern
County and thence by a practicable
route to a point where such proposed
railroad shall connect with the present
constructed line of railroad of the
Southern California Railway Company
In the city of Los Angeles. The South
ern California Railway is a branch of
the Santa Fe running from Mojave to
Los Angeles. This is the connecting
link which will place California in
touch with the entire continent and de
stroy forever the dictatorial policy of
the one road out of the State.
In building the road from Bakersfield
to Los Angeles the new company in
sures itself one or more Eastern con->
nectlons. As it is to cross the Tejon
and build the line into Los Angeles by
a direct route it will not of necessity be
thrown upon the Santa Fe for connec
tions. The Oregon Short Line has a
branch road from Salt Lake which will
have a terminus at Pioche. There is
hardly a doubt that, if the exigencies
demand It, this line would continue its
road to a meeting point with the new
continuation of the Valley road.
The Bakersfleld and Los Angeles
Railway Company-Is a distinct corpora
tion, although all of its members are
connected with the Valley, road. The
five directors all hold positions of trust
in the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Railway, and their interest in the es
tablishment of a new transcontinental
line with a terminus at San Francisco
has been closely allied with the original
venture of the Valley road. The logical
deduction of the building of the Valley
road was that some day connections
would be made with Eastern lines.
When the Valley road was originally
contemplated a number of patriotic
citizens came forward and voluntarily
subscribed, thinking: at the time that
it was a contribution. Time has proved
that the money that was advanced to
build the road through the San Joaquin
Valley was well placed from the stand
point of investment. To protect these
original and patriotic subscribers the
officials of the Valley road lately ad
vised the stockholders not to sell, for
certain events would soon occur that
would insure them the par value of
their stock. So It was arranged that
the Union Trust Company should hold
all shares at the option of the deposi
tor to sell for par value at the end of
the year or to still continue to hold
them. The one thing that could make
the Valley road a part of a great and
prosperous system was connections,
and now these are secured. The new
road will not pass through a fruitful
country and as an isolated line would
not be self-sustaining. It is through its
terminal connections that it will be a
power, at the same time making the
Valley road a railway of great value.
With the new road over the pass from
Bakersfield to Los Angeles and the
Valley road from Bakersfleld to San
Francisco the knell of death has been
sounded for railroad monopoly in Cali
fornia. Practically two tide-water ter
minals are assured the Valley and
Bakersfield and Los Angeles roads with
all their Inestimable benefits. The re
cent adjustment of Santa Fe compli
cations when that road was transferred
at ito real valuation was a prognostica
tion which the present shows In reali
zation. The Valley road with its new
connections will be able to cut freights
at both ends. The situation after the
construction of the new line will not
be the same as it has been for many
years, ever since the Southern Pacific
Company of Kentucky railed with a rod
of iron. The spirit of competition will
be injected into that corporation and
the benefit to the people of California
cannot be easily ascertained so great
will it be.
The "purpose" section of the articles
of incorporation besides reciting the
purpose of the formation of the com
pany to build the road with all its ac-
cessories â wharves, necessary steam
boat lines, ferryboats in connection
with the railroad, docks, landings, to
buy all real estate necessary and proper
for the exercise of its powers, etc., etc.
âmentions the proposed building of a
telephone and telegraph line along the
route.
The tenth fiction of the articles of
incorporation shows that there was
actually subscribed before the filing
$1000 for each mile of road intended to
be constructed or purchased by the cor
poration and that $100 has been sub
scribed for every mile of telegraph or
telephone line. The article* also show
that 10 per cent of the amount sub
scribed has been paid to the treasurer
for the benefit of the corporation.
San- Francisco is selected as the prin
cipal place of business of the new cor
poration. To shippers, to farmers, to
grape growers this new road of 200
miles of rails will be as the shower of
manna to the famished. The day for
one-armed and undisputed power has
now surrendered to the growing de
mands of a people who will soon know
what enfranchisement means.

PHELAN-McNAB MEN
CARRY OUT ORDERS
There Were Several Hitches Last Right at the
Opening of the Self- Admiration Society
Convention.
The Slate Work Was Carried Out in a Very Bungling Manner by Some of tha
Actors, to the Great Disgust and Dissatisfaction of Those Who
Were Engineering the Performance.
The Phelan-McNab Self-Admiration
Society, sometimes called the Demo
cratic Committee of One Hundred, held
a Democratic municipal convention last
night in Native Sons' Hall.
Nearly three hours' time was wasted
in carrying out a programme that Boss
Buckley, when ho was "doing" politics,
would have finished inside of ten min
utes. The work was mapped out dur
ing the afternoon hours, but the artists
of the occasion were evidently the vic
tims of a bad attack of stage fright.
The "prompters" of the political drama,
Charles W. Fay and Colon\el W. P. Sul
livan, were distinguished with the stu
pidity of the actors. In several in
stances they had to cross the ball to
give the cue to those who had been
assigned parts in the play of pure poli
tics. But Is was a first- night perform
ance, and it is believed that the actors
wil know and understand their lines
better when the second performance of
"working the slate" is given.
Jasper McDonald, chairman of the
self-appcrinted band of political reform
ers, was a little slow In ordering the
curtain raised on the first act.
"What is your pleasure, gentlemen?"
asked he in the tones of an interlocutor
In a minstrel show.
"Give us the programme," shouted
some one from the rear of the hall.
Secretary Thomas J. Walsh at once
proceeded to read the minutes of the
preceding meeting. When he had fin
ished, Francis J. Heney made himself
heard. He objected to the adoption of
the minutes as recorded. "We want the
truth recorded here," said he, "and the
minutes do not give us that. I would
like to know where the secretary gets
his information that the resolution in
troduced doing away with a primary
had only one vote against It. It was
a viva voce vote, and how does he know
that there was only one vote cast In
opposition? Then I would also like to
knov.- where the secretary obtained his
Information that the resolution declar
ing against proxies was carried unani
mously. I voted against it "
"So did I," chirruped several of the
committeemen.
"No you didn't," said some one In an
angry tone.
"Whoever says I didn't," shouted
Heney, "does not tell the truth."
Heney looked around to find his tor
mentor, but no one answered his words
of challenge and defiance. It was then
decided to change the minutes to con
form with the suggestion of Heney,
that they only set forth the truth. Thus
ended the first act.
Chairman McDonald announced that
the committee would next resolve It
self into a nominating convention.
M. C. Hassett placed McDonald in
nomination for temporary chairman,
and W. J. McGee was nominated by
Colonel Sullivan.
McDonald, who had his part well
learned, spoke his lines thanking the
convention for the honor conferred on
him, and withdrew In favor of Mc-
Gee.
"Programme!" shouted some one in
the lobby.
"If there is any further interruption.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
from the lobby," exclaimed Joseph N.
- ougues, "I will ask to have it clear
ed."
It wouldn't be a Democratic conven
tion," interjected E. P. E. Troy, "un
less we had a row."
McGee, who had been sitting next to
Fay, was then called to the platform
to take the gavel. He made a speech of
acceptance, and introduced in the
course of his remarks some old-time
friends like "it is a most unexpected
and unsolicited honor," and "I have no
friends to reward nor enemies to pun
ish." These remarks were applauded,
just the same as they have been a hun
dred times before.
Charles Fay then went over to M. H.
Hernan and promp*- ' him to make a
motion that a committee of seven be
appointed on credentials. Hernan com
plied.
Colonel Sullivan looked uneasy when
P. H. McCart) 1 " who had been assign
ed the part of moving that a committee
of seven be appointed on permanent
organization and orilr of business,
forgo', his part. Some one sitting near
McCarthy nudged him and he spoke his
little piece.
It was then suggested that before
going any farther it might be advisable
to have a temporary secretary to keep
record of the proceedings. The secre
taryshi- as per programme, fell to T.
J. Walsh. Lawrence J. Hoey was made
assistant secretary.
"We are getting along nicely," said
Chairman McGee, "and as I haven't got
a slate, I would ask ten minutes' time
to name the committees."
A recess was taken and Fay and Sul
livan hastened to the aid of the chair
man in his arduous work.
When the convention reconvened the
following announcements were made
from the programme:
Committee on Credentials â M. H.
Hernan, Charles J. Gallagher, P. J. Mc-
Cormick, H. L. Rea, G. Howard
Thompson, J. M. Klein, Matt Lally.
Committee on Permanent Organiza
tion and Order of Business â P. H. Mc-
Carthy, Emil Pohli, John H. Hansen,
Jeremiah Deasy, G. D. Maxwell, How
ard Park of Susanville, and August
Tillman.
It took the credentials committee half
an hour to frame a report deciding that
the members of the admiration so
ciety were entitled to seats in the nom
inating convention.
Then came the report of the second
committee. It was to the effect that the
temporary officers of the convention be
made the permanent officers; that H.
L. Bienfield, aid de camp to Maximilian
Popper, be chosen chief bouncer, to
take care of any one suggesting a "pro
gramme," and that the order of nomin
ation be as follows: Mayor; four Su
perior Judges; Board of Supervisors;
Board of School Directors; Assessor;
Sheriff; Public Administrator; Auditor;
Treasurer; Tax Collector; Recorder;
County Clerk; City and County Attor

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 19.
The convention was late In getting down
to business, but no time was lost after
the ball was started. Chairman "Flettei
of the County Central Committee called
the delegates to order and assured them
that be would waste no time talking of
Presldt-nt McKinley or the Spanish war,
but at the same time he wished them to
understand that his loyalty to the Presi
dent or his patriotism to his country must
not be judged by his desire to save time
and not inflict platitudes on Intelligent
men.
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Fletter, "the Re
publican banner of California is now] in
the possession of Alameda County. What
are you going to do with it? (Cries of
"Keep it.") I would impress upon tho
delegates the necessity of putting up men
who can be elected and who after elec
tion will make good officers, and would
advise all candidates who may not be
nominated to become reconciled to their
fato, to trust to the future and to do
everything for the success of the whole
ticket from top to bottom."
Rev. Barton W. Perry delivered a short
speech of welcome to the delegates on be
half of "San Leandro, the garden spot of
Alameda County, and therefore of the
world."
He proclaimed to the convention that
the latch string was out and the doors '
Of their homes were opened to o.H who 1
wished to enter.
"Some of you may remember," said he, j
"that two years ago Alameda County j
cast a snowstorm of ballots for a gen- j
tleman named McKinley. and I wish 10
remind you that this little precinct In
which you now are did more than Its pro-
Fortlonate share to attain the desired end.
t is past human comprehension to under
stand how any business man or any one
with good common sense can vote for
that mongrel aggregation called Demo- I
cratic-PopullÃtlC or any other thine, ac
cording to the way the wind may be olow- j
Ing."
Dr. Perry then related a little anecdote
which, he said, would make a good sug
gestion for a cartoon. "An old hun
ter In New York," said he, "was i
hunting foxes with a dog. The dog ;
ran up against an old-fashioned corn cut- I
ter that split the animal In two. The hun
ter picked the two parts up and clapped
them together, but had one-half of the
head against the other half of the tall,
and when the dog recovered he continu- j
ally wondered why It could not run both
way* at tbe same time."
Colonel Hastings made a Httje speech, !
after which J. \V. Evans was nominated
by A. A. Moore Jr. for chairman. There
being no other nominations, Mr. Evans ;
was escorted to the platform, and after ',
the appointment of TV. W. Curnow and i
R. G. McKenzte as secretaries and half a ;
dozen Fergeants at arms, a recess was i
taken to enable the chairman to appoint

The reports of the committees were
adopted without dispute, although
Charles THrichs of Berkeley attempted
to Introduce a resolution which had been ]
voted down In committee. His resolution
stated that:
Whereas, It is openly charged that this con
vention Is slated by the said bosses In the In
terests of a set of candidates, in contravention
of the expressed wishes of the majority of ths
Republican voters of Alameda county; and
whereas, the dissensions arising from the sub
version of the sublime principles of the Repub
lican party, which should Insure equal rights
and privileges to all, can only result In the
lo*s of prentice, weaken the strength and tar- j
n!sh the honor of the party of Alameda county; !
therefore be It
â :ved. That the Republican party of Ala- â 
meda county In convention assembled hereby '
declares its disapprobation of any system
which has fcr Its sole purpose the pledging j
of delei-atos to this convention to the carrying !
out the wishes of political bosÃes, and to the
nomination of only such men for public office i
as have been dictated by the said bosses; and I
be it further
Resolved, That the Republican voters of Ala
meda county view with disquietude and alarm
the prospects of a campaign prosecuted under I
conditions which, unless speedily remedied
DMÂ»t result In disaster to the party, and the
defeat of Its candidates at the coming election- j
und be it farther
Resolved, That the members of this conven
lion hereby deelure their unswerving loyalty to !
the principles of liberty, truth and freedom of i
thought and action. In the preservation of j
which our forefathers sacrifices their fortunes I
and their lives, and they pledge themselves to -
free and Independent action In the nomination 'â¢
of only such men for offices of public trust as
may add to, rather than detract from, the ',
strength of the ticket to be voted at the polls 'â 
While waiting for one of the commit- I
tr-r-F the band delighted the audience with â 
much music. It was an energetic hand '
nnd It played from early morn till dewy !
cve â played conscientiously, and if each j
man didn't receive three days' pay for |
his day'Â» work he has a legitimate griev- j
ance against the city of San Lean- j
dro. which employed him.
Chairman Evans then stated that some!
one had made the suggestion that Dr.
Pardeo fill In the time by addressing: the
convention. The suggestion was rapidly j
accepted, and Joe Herrscher and A. A. |
Moore Jr. were appointed a committee to I
escort Alameda's favorite Republican to !
the platform. The doctor complimented j
the convention on Us personnel, referred ;
to the promises and pledges made at |
Sacramento, and declared that he had no^

hesitation In stating that Alamc n would
carry every one 01 them out.
"The eyes of every county in Califor
nia," said he, "are upon Alameda Coun
ty at this time, a-nd they will remain
centered upon her until after the elec
tion. Wo have a plain duty to perform,
and, judging by the enthusiasm and the
evident sincerity of purpose which I can
not fail to detect in the faces before mo,
that duty will be faithfully fulfilled. Not
long ago I stood before another conven
tion. (Laughter.) On that occasion I
stated to the Republican representatives
of this whole State that Alameda County
had come to Sacramento for the purpose
of seeking a nomination on the State
ticket. We pledged ourselves that If we
received that nomination we should feel
grateful, and that if we did not we should
not suffer our heads to become sore, but
we should go back to Alameda and work
Just as hard as though we were granted
what we sought. We did not attain our
desire, but we do not feel badly, and 1
feel Justified in saying that the Republi-
can party of this county will vote as a
unit for the ticket from Governor to Con
stable, and that the party majority will
be as great if not greater than It was
when we were battling to elect our great
soldier President. William McKinley."
The nomination of candidates was then
taken up in earnest.
R. B. Tappan nominated Oscar Rogers
of Alameda for Sheriff, and Informed the
delegates that he had known the nominee
"from the time he came into Â Alameda
without a stitch of clothing on his back
to this afternoon, when he will appear
before you decently attired," afterward
explaining that Mr. Rogers was a native
son, considerably younger â  than the
speaker, and wan born In-Alamedar-*' â--
W. H. Waste of Berkeley seconded the
nomination, which was made unanimous.
; Delegate Sherltt of Berkeley nominated
Charles Spear- from Recorder.:-- There
were several seconds and no other nomi
nations, Mr. Spear being declared the
nominee.
Billy Mac Donald of Murray Township
in a humorous speech nominated Arthur
Wellington Feidler for Treasurer. After
frequent secondings the nomination was
made by acclamation. . â¢ ..â¢â¢ >
Clarence Crowell placed in nomination
for Auditor J. Cal Ewing, and there be
ing no more names the secretary cast the
convention's ballot for the nominee.
It was at this juncture that G. S. Lan
gan amused the convention for a couple
of minutes, after which Dr. Pardee nomi
nated Henry P. Dalton, which nomination
was seconded by Rev. . Dr. Perry and
made unanimous.
A. A. Moore Jr. placed before the con
vention the name of Harry A. Melvin for
District Attorney. Attorney George Sam
uel placed in nomination the name of
Judge J. J. Allen. Several speeches were
made, eulogizing both men, after which
Mr. Melvin took the platform and in a
manly address withdrew his name in the
interest of harmony and asked that the
nomination of Judge Allen be made unan
imous, which it was. :
Ben Woolner placed in nomination
Frank Jordan for County Clerk. Near
ly every delegation seconded the nomi
nation and there being no others the sec
retary cast the ballot for the nominee.
Dr. Tlsdale of Alameda placed in nomi
nation James B. Barber to succeed him
self as Tax Collector and the nomination
was made by acclamation. â 
Rev. Mr. Barton Perry said that Eden
Township, although feeling very hospita
ble, only wanted one thingâ B. C. Hawes
for Public Administrator. This was con
ceded by the convention without a mur
mur.
For the nomination of Superintendent
of Schools there was a lively fight. H.
S. Henlon of Washington nominated ' H.
W. L. Lynch and W. H. Waste of Berke
ley nominated S. D. Waterman. Water
man proved to be the. favorite.
Dr. H. B. Mehrmann was nominated for

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALIi, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1898.
SAN LEANDRO
IS VOTED A
GREAT HOST
Delegates Received
With Republican
Hospitality.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 19.
It was a great band that was stationed
by the considerate citizens of San Lean
dro near the Plaza this morning to wel
come with generous strains of music the
30) delegates and their political friends
who attended the County Republican Con-
REPUBLICAN COUNTY NOfIINEES.
' ventlon. The music was gTeat â literally
so, the ambition of each musician was
i great and the occasion was greater.
San Leandro kept all of her promises â
1 In fact, she did better than she promised.
j Rev. Barton W. Perry, the Presbyterian
minister. Is a hero among politicians to
night, probably the only minister In the
county occupying that unique distinction.
The pretty town was given over to the
politicians. Before the hour for conven
ing arrived carloads of candidates, dele
gates and of the usual crowd that is al
ways to be found at political conventions
swarmed into the little town. Some of
the delegations were driven in in gayly
j decorated wagonettes, ornamented with
| banners proclaiming their particular can
didate. Many went out in buggies and hun
dreds came from the Interior of the coun
ty who would never have graced a county
convention with their presence had it been
held in Oakland. The idea of holding the
convention in Eden Township proved a
marked success, for it created great en
thusiasm and lire and Republican Interest
in a locality definitely Democratic.
San Leandro ladles must also be com
plimented on trKSlr ability to decorate a
convention hall. One gained the sugges
tion on entering that two or three nursei
ies must have been raided to supply the
many floral pieces that were placed round
the stage, while on the walls, tastefully
ornamented, were all the heroes in Amei-
I lean history, from George Washington to
I those who distinguished themselves in the
[ late war. Even the banners which deslg
nated the sections to be occupied by the
different delegations were neatly painted
on silk and were specially manu
factured across the bay, which fact Dr.
Perry stated was responsible for spelling
Murray Township without an "a."
It was Joseph Herrscher's quadrennial
day. Joe Is one of the most successful of
county contractors. He ran for Cdunty
Treasurer four years ago, was beaten at
the election, costing him several thou
sands of dollars but is as good a Repub
lican as ever. He has long been In the
local government of San Leandro and
when he undertakes to run the financial
end of the entertainment of the County
Convention, he invariably makes a suc
cess of It. There is a good deal of diffei
ence in some of their views between Mr.
Herrscher and the Rev. Dr. Perry, but
neither can claim precedence as a royal
executive manager. Joe took advantage
of a lull In the convention to state that
the town had provided everything free of
charge, and that the modest assessment
of 50 cents required from the delegates
was for the benefit of the campaign and
not for the payment of the hall, or the
transportation or the decorations, or the
band, or the sumptuous banquet supplied
to the press and County Committee or*â
the famous Estudfllo wine.
The last convention held in San Lean
dro was that of the Democrats four years
ago, and it Is notorfnus that not a single
man nominated at that time was elected.
Joe Herrscher assured the Republican del
egates that the Democratic hoodoo had
been transformed into a Republcan mas
cot and that the business of to-day
would certain be ratified on November 8.
The reception accorded to Dr. George C.
Pardee when he entered the hall reaf
firmed. If such were necessary, the ex
pressions of party harmony that were ut
tered at Sacramtnto. Dr. Pardee was
the most prominent man in the conven
tion, and his timely speech, short, to the
point and uttered In his conscientious,
forceful manner, fittingly represented the
spirit of the convention. The doctor took
his seat as a delegate in the Fifth Ward,
and in addition to addressing the con
vention he placed in nomination Henry
P. Dalton.
While nominations were being made, a
regrettable litue. incident occurred, which
Eden Township sincerely regrets. One of
Ha delegates, Gurdon S. Langan, arose
presumably to place In nomination a can
didate for Assessor. As it was well
known that Dr. Pardee was already in
tending to nominate Mr. Daltpn, Langan's
effort was rather a surpriseâ his ultimate
actions a greater surprise. Langan went
on the platform and commenced to make
a speech in which he declared that since
so many men had been nominated unani
mously, it was very evident that the thing
had been prearranged. Mr. Langan wan
dered considerably in hi6 speech, for which
he apologized by saying ne had had "too
much dinner," which was evidently true.
He was voted out of order and retired to
his seat with the Hay wards delegation.
That there was no sincerity in the stand
which he professed to take was best
proved by the fact that the Eden Township
delegation voted solidly for each of the
candidates and Mr. Langan made no pro
test.
NOT A SLATE
BUT PERFECT
HARMONY
Nominees Come From
All Over the
County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 19.
Although the nominations were mostly
unanimous and there were but few con
tests, there was no slate In existence at
the convention. There were two factions
striving for supremacy and for the privi
lege of filling certain offices, but Instead
of carrying: their factionalism Into the
convention it was quietly adjusted after
the primaries.
H. A. Melvin withdrew in favor of
Judge Allen, and although there is no
reason to suppose that any promises have
been given in violation of the purity of
election law it is rumored that Mr. Mel
vin will be the chief deputy when Judge
Allen assumes tne duties of DiÃtrict At
torney.
Thomas S. Robinson also withdrew in
favor of James B. Barber, and it is also
expected that when Mr. Barber is elected
Tom Robinson wilt take the chief deputy
ship in the office of Assessor Dalton.
Robert Graham withdrew in favor of
Frank C. Jordan for County Clerk, and it
is possible that Mr. Graham will be a
deputy, in fact, the chief deputy of Mr.
Jordan's next administration. Cal Ewinr
having been nominated for Auditor, will
leave just such a vacancy in the County
Clerk's office as Mr. Graham would desire,
and it is also hinted that it will not be a
stranger who will fill the position of chief
deputy under Mr. Ewing.
Geographically the county ticket is a
good one. Berkeley has two nominees,
Alameda two, Eden Township one, Mur
ray Township one, while the First, Sec
ond, Third, Fifth and Seventh wards have
one each.
The Fourth Ward has a Supervisor,
Brooklyn Township has a Supervisor,
while the Sixth Ward and Alameda have
each a State Senator.
The platform as adopted was as fol
lows:
The Republican party of the County of
Alameda, In county convention assembled
at San Leandro, this 19th day of Septem
ber, IS9S, as expressive of its stand on the
political questions of the day, and as a

AVllliam McKinley, under whose splendid
leadership, with the assistance of the Re
publican party in Congrress, our country has
been restored to a rapidly Increasing degree
of prosperity, revived and rescued from the
effect of the previous Democratic financial
policy, and our flag caused to be respected
in Â«very quarter of the world to a degree
hitherto unparalleled.
Resolved, That this convention pledges Its
nominees for the Legislature to do their ut
most and vote for a straight primary law.
Resolved, That we hereby pledge our can

quished.
Resolved, That we pledge ourselves and
our representatives to a loyal support of our
common schools and our State University.
Whereas, the building up of the manu
facturing.. Interests of our" city and State Is
greatly to be desired, and as a means to
that end we believe that Incorporated cities
should have the right to encourage, foster

BANQUET TO
THE COUNTY
EDITORS
Haywards Vies Witn
Alameda at Blush
ing.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call*
908 Broadway, Sept. 19.
One of the most enjoyable Incidents of
the day was the banquet tendered by the
citizens of San Leandro to the press of
San Francisco and Alameda County. *.
â¢ San Leandro is the only town in this
county that makes any pretense of treat
ing the county committee and j visiting
editors with marked hospitality. At the
table which was spread under the grow
ing vines in the garden of the historic
Estudillo House were seated members of
the staff of nearly every paper published
in the two counties.
George Oakes, proprietor of the Hay
wards Journal and Postmaster of that
town, blush i to the roots of his hair
when he was forced to recollect that four
years ago when the Republican conven
tion was held at Haywards the only pro
vision made for visitors was - cold tea
with ice. :â â¢ -
Editor T. O. Danlells of the Alameda
Areus turned the color of the Estudillo
claret when some one reminded him of the
time two years ago when the Republican
convention met at Alameda and refresh
ments were not even dreamed of.
Dan McCarty, the Democratic editor of
the San Leandro Reporter, swelled with
pride as decorated with a reception badge
he called the guests' attention to what
his town can do. â  In fact the Democratic
editor was the lion of the noon recess.
Proprietor Emlay of the Berkeley
World-Herald-Gazette tried to make a
speech;- but ..was too busy discussing the
lengthy bill or rare, pjairor sorter. laTS
of Echoes, was: also present and A. R.
Waters, proprietor of the Nlles Herald,
and Artist Langford, with their clear
glasses in one corner of the table, bora
testimony to the fact that the Christian
Endeavor Society had representatives on
the press.'. â %&tÂ£S*sÃ&lÃ&xÃrtf*SÃt <
E. B. Thompson, proprietor of the Ir
vington Press, came up loaded down with
a â¢ specially illustrated magazine edition
of his paper, to which he treated the dele
gates. A. V. Morgan, proprietor of the
Haywards Review, shared the discom
fiture of George Oakes as he thought of
the iced tea of 1894. A. W. Bishop, who is
a member of the * press by virtue of the
fact that he edited the old Oakland Tran
script thirty years ago. occupied the post
of honor, and during the banquet revised
the yell, of the Alameda city delegates.
Ed O'Brien, H. S. Pugh, Clyde Sunder
land, Adna A. Denison, Bert Reynolds
and others having partaken of the boun
tiful spread, joined the vote of thanks
that was tendered the entertainment
committee through Dr. Perry.
She Weeps Continuously.
OAKLAND, Sept. 19.â Miss Pauline
Tells was brought in a wagon from Liver
more this morning to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Drs. Myra Knox and Wake
field examined her for insanity. ' Judee
Hall committed her to the Stockton

RE'UBLICANS ARE CONFIDENT
ACTIVE DEMAKT) FOB CAMPAIGN
LITERATURE.
The Republican Nominee for Gov
ernor Will Address the People
of Santa Barbara Next
Thursday Evening.
Major Frank McLaughlin and his asso
ciates of the executive committee of the
Republican State Central Committee are
quite well satisfied with the reports daily
received from the various sections of the
State. The Republicans throughout Cali
fornia are confident that their State tick
et will be elected. This confidence is not
the result of hasty conclusions derived
from superficial observation, but Is
formed after a study of the situation. The
fusion ticket is nowhere receiving the
strong support of Democrats. The Ma
guire meetings have not awakened the
enthusiasm of the masses. There are no
Indications of Republican defection. On
the other hand the Republicans are in
line, taking an active interest in the af
fairs of the campaign. The demand for
Retpublican campaign literature Is great
er than the committee anticipated. Gage
buttons are in great demand. Fifty thou
sand buttons have already been sent out
to fill the requests of local committees.
Major McLaughlin returned from Santa
Cruz last evening and with the assistance
of two secretaries took up the accumulat
ed correspondence of the day.
Eugene F. Loud, Republican nominee
for Congress in the Fifth District, was at
headquarters yesterday afternoon. He is
arranging for a tour of the district. His
friends bring him the most encouraging
reports, predicting that he will be re
elected by an increased majority.
John T. Dare and Henry Kowalsky, who
have just returned from New York, were
callers at headquarters yesterday. Each
visited the military oamp at Montauk
Point. John T. Dare waited there ten
days for the arrival of his son from San
tiago. He speaks highly of the manage
ment of the affairs of the camp and
speaks from knowledge gained by Inter
views with hundreds of soldiers there en
camped. The attempts of the New York
World and Journal to stir up feeling
against the administration by attacking
the military authorities utterly failed of
Its purpose, says Mr. Dare.
Colonel Kowalsky, as a military man,
was not altogether satisfied with the
camp at Montauk. He observed that
some of the tents were blown down dur
ing a violent storm, and as a result sol
diers were exposed to the elements. Col
onel Kowalsky was in New York during
the recent heated term and was himself
exposed to the elements, but he did not
ascribe his discomforts to the Republican
administration.
Henry T. Gage, the Republican nomi
nee for Governor, will visit Santa Bar
bara next Thursday and speak there on
the evening of that day. He will ad
dress several meetings In Southern Cali
fornia before he comes to San Francisco.
Judge Magulre, the fusion nominee, is
now campaigning In Southern California.
He will speak at Lompoc this evening;
at Santa Barbara to-morrow evening;
Ban Buenaventura Thursday evening-;
c<nn Bernardino Fti<Say evening; Santa
Ana Saturday noon and San Diego Satur
day night; next Monday at Los Angeles
and Tuesday next at Riverside.
The managers of the Magulre campaign
at the California Hotel say that the
Judge is having good meetings and that
the people attending listen to what he
says.
Dr. F. H. Emerson was Inadvertently
mentioned in The Call yesterday as a
Democratic aspirant for the office of Cor
oner. He is a stanch Republican and
would be happy to receive the Republican
nomination for that office.
The next big Republican meeting In San
Francisco under the auspices of the State
Central Committee will be held at Met
ropolitan Temple Saturday evening of
this week. Hon. M. M. Estee will ad
dress the audience. The celebrated Ply
mouth Quartet will sing patriotic songs."
GENERAL MERRIAM AND
HIS STAFF ARRIVE
Reported Clash Between President
Dole and the Hawaiian Com
missioners.
The steamer Australia from Honolulu
reached port at a late hour last night. She
had on board General Merriam and staff
and three sick soldiers.
The Commissioners have finished their
â¢work and will return on the Alameda,
which is expected in port hourly. When
the Australia left Honolulu there were
vague rumors afloat of a clash between
President Dole of the provisional govern
ment and the Commissioners, but the mat
ter was kept so quiet that nothing definite
could be ascertained.
FIGHTING FOB A NAME.
People's Party Asks Recognition by
the Supreme Court.
The pinto combination, commonly called
the Fusionists, has made an" effort to se
cure the dignified consideration of having
a party name. Secretary of State Brown
did not think that the organization was
worthy of a cognomen, and the leaders
decided to take the matter to the Supreme
( !ourt and get permission from that au
gust source to be Judicially placed among
the parties of the political community.
Mandamus was the method of procedure
to secure the desired end. An application
for such a writ was petitioned for yes-
Tfi-rlay by Edward L. Hutchison, candi
date for Lieutenant Governor, and E. M.
Wardall, chairman of the "People's Party
Btate Committee."
The petitioners make the contentions
that the People's Party is a regularly
constituted political party and that at the
last election it cast more than 5 per cent
of the entire vote of the State. It has a
State Central, Executive Committees and
County Central Committees. The legal
and regular forms of calling the conven
tion of July 12. 1898. were observed, the
propÂ«r officers of the convention were se
lected and a platform was adopted.
The petition recites the nomination of
J. G. Magulre for (Jovernor and his selec
tion as candidate for Governor by a ma
jority vote of the convention. One point
on which the- petitioners rely for strength
is that the nomination of Maguire for
Governor took place before any agreement
or plan of union with any political parties
was made. After Maguire, Hutchison and
others were selected f or the officers of
the State the petitioners assert that a pre
tended organization of a separate conven
tion was held by a disgruntled minority,
fifty-three of the Peoples Party met and
made certain pretended nominations.
Since then the People s Party has ful
filled all of the requirements as to filing
a certificate of nomination, and that the
pretended People s Party has also filed
similar certificates, which promises to
create and promote confuslm. The peti
tioners claim that they hax 0 no speedy
remedy or plan to straighten out matters
except by applying to the Suireme Court.
It is likely that the court *ni i ssue an
alternative writ of mandate mode return

SHANAHAN IS
READY FOR
THE BATTLE
The People's Party
Fight Begins.
FUSION WILL BE KNIFED
HISTORY OF MAGUIRE AND RE
CENT POLITICS.
Loyal Populists Reorganizing Every
where by Direction of the State
Committee â A Local Ticket
Promised.
The decision of Secretary of State
Brown that the People's party and not
the hybrid organization known as fusion-
Ists Is entitled to the use of the party
name, has started the regular Populist
organization Into vigorous activity. All
their campaign plans had awaited this de
cision.
Now the State Central Committee, of
which D. T. Fowler, the candidate for
Lieutenant Governor, is chairman, and
Carleton H. Johnson secretary, is hasten
ing arrangements for opening the cam
paign.
The most prominent and vigorous ele
ment in it will be Mr. Shanahan himself.
He will begin operations next week, prob
ably at Redding, and proposes to keep
hustling thereafter until the close of the
campaign, speaking as far as possible in
every town in the State. Maguireism
will find him a thorn in its side after he
gets started.
All candidates on the State ticket and
on local tickets will work more or less on
the stump, and some who are not can
didates. Including Thomas V. Cator, will
be heard in the hustings. However, the
campaign will be largely conducted by
means of political literature, which will
be liberally distributed. One document
soon to be issued will give a history and
exposition of the fusion arrangement into
which a portion of the party was
treacherously inveigled. It will include
the story of how the San Francisco dele
gation was elected by fraud and how it
acted contrary to its express instructions
and the events and influences attending
the consummation of the fusion pro
gramme at Sacramento will be set forth,
together with the considerations which
appeal to members of the party who are
loyal to their princlnles.
A great deal of attention will be given
to James G. Maguire and his varied po
litical career, in which there figures his
campaigns against the Populist party, his
refusal in 1892 to subscribe to the free
silver plank in the Populist platform
when 'that nomination for Congress was
offered him, his opposition to an income
tax In Congress, and his vote to deprive
Tom Watson of Georgia of his seat in
Congress. These and some other fea
tures of Maguire's career as a trimmer
have already been set forth by Carleton
Johnson.
A circular has just been sent to party
leaders throughout the State from the
State headquarters announcing Secretary
Brown's decision, and that the campaign
is now open. The circular includes the
following instructions:
Wherever your county committee adheres to
the Democratic fusion State ticket, withdraw
the true Populists and organize a new commit
tee In the name of the People's party to sup
port the State ticket of the party.
which Is being: run on the condition thnt Ihe
Democratic State ticket be supported In con
nection therewith, you should, after orK.\r.ijia
tlon of your new county committee, call a
county convention and nominate a straight
People's party county ticket. State Senators
and Assemblymen should be nominated In
every district.
Pay no attention to communications emanat
ing from fusion sources signed by Wardall or
Qillesple in the name of the People's party, as
such use of the party name is fraudulent and
Intended to deceive voters.
Many county organizations have been
waiting for the decision now in force, and
will now proceed actively to the business
of the campaign.
The San Francisco County Committee,
which was recently organized, will bÂ»
called together this week to fix a date
for a county convention. It Is now pro
posed to put in the field a complete gen
! vine People's party local ticket, with
the probable exception of the judiciary
nominees. The decision as to the party
name is regarded as giving the right
to the party designation in this city to
the middle-of-the-roadsters, as the local
committee was organized under the direc
tion of the regular State committee. This
precipitates a secondary local squabble
! between the factions, and if Secretary
I Brown's decision is sustained by the Su
1 preme Court the local Glllesple crowd
â  will likewise be out In the cold.

The report was adopted as presented.
Joseph Nougues next moved that a
committee of eleven be appointed to
frame a platform. The motion prevail
ed and one of the members of the lobby
called for another recess.
"A recess is not necessary," said the
chairman cheerily. "I think I can ap
point the committee inside of two min
utes."
He did better than that, however, for
one of Buckley's old pupils, who held a
stop watch on him, afterward said that
it only took McGee one minute and
twenty-eight seconds to do the work of
reading from the programme that had
been furnished him during the other
recess. The committee is as follows:
Joseph M. Nougues, Jasper McDonald,
Max Popper, J. C. McKinstry, D. C.

"Move we adjourn until 8 o'clock to

ily.
There was no objection and the puri
fiers of Democracy and several hundred
place hunters wandered out into the
night. ( _^_ (

NANCE O'NEIL
IN THE JEWESS
Big Temperament, but
Too Much Melodrama.
THE ADRIENNE OF MODJESKA
"THE QUEEN OF SHEBA" PRO
DUCED AT THE TIVOLI.
"Jones Again â Alhaxnbra and Or
pheum Variety â Alcazar Farce.
Morosco Melo
drama.
I explained yesterday that Miss
Nance O'Nell wanted to celebrate her
reurn to San Francisco in "Magda,"
but owing to some legal wrangle about
the American rights, could not. So she
fell back on what she considered the
next best part in her repertoire and com-
menced her engagement at the Colum
bia last night in the oppressed Hebraic
heroine of Mosenthal's "Leah the For
saken," or rather "The Jewess," for
McKee Rankin has readapted and re
titled the piece.
My recollections of the earlier ver
sions are not clear enough to warrant
a searching comparison, but I can say
with easy conscience that Mr. Rankin's
adaptation has robbed the original of
none of Its weight and gloom. "The
Jewess" weighs a ton. And it is serious,
with its persecutions, prejudices, thun
der storms, grave yards, ill-starred love
of Jewess and Gentile; all written in
the old mode of obvious melodrama. It
is so serious that it is hard to take
it very seriously. Perhaps it will prove
a profitable attraction during this week
of Jewish holidays, but it does not im
press me as a piece that would warrant
a week here in the ordinary circum
stances of a season.
The excuse, of course, is the opportu
nity offered Miss O'Neil's emotional
gifts by the title part. After last night
I should say that emotional work of
the large, heroic order is Miss O'Neil's
specialty. She is a large woman with
a big, low, roughish, beautiful voice,
large plastic features and a compelling
personality. While she plays you say
to yourself every now and then, "That's
bad art! That's rant! That's melo
drama!" â but the robust music of that
voice, the spell of the personality
even the athletic swing of the big round
arms â reach over the lights and grip
you where you live. Miss O'Neil surely
has it in her to be an artist, a unique
artist, butâ and I tremble to write it,
as I think of the scornful way in which
other good and famous Californlans
have said that they had to come back
to this little old town to find out how
much they didn't knowâ she needs to
modify. The half of what she did last
night would have played the part per
fectly; the whole effort was too much.
She was too tempestuous, too strenu
ous, and she overdid the rich pathos of
her voice. In a word Miss O'Neil's per
formance showed positive ability, and a
strong, passionate personality, but it
lacked the tactful qualities of repres
sion and suggestion. McKee Rankin is
too good a coach, and according to all
accounts has already done too much for
Miss O'Neil's art to let her go the pace
of mere melodrama. There Is no 1 f ason
why Nance O'Neil should not live up
to all the good things that have been
written about her.
Mr. H. A. Weaver did a bit of unob
trusive and telling work in the part of
the Gentile father. The rest played In
the open key of melodrama, Herbert
Carr, energetic and sonorous as the
Christian hero, and Mr. Rankin elab
orately dangerous as the villain school
master. ASHTON STEVENS.
The Tivoli.
The musical event of the grand opera
season at the Tivoll opened last night
with Goldmark's "Queen of Sheba." This
"magnum opus" of the famous German
composer had never before been given In
San Francisco and the management has
spared no trouble and expense to make
the event a success.
The libretto was written by the well
known author and playwright Mosenthal,
and Is founded on the erotic love story
of Antar, the favorite of King Solomon.
It is a well-known fact that operas or
plays founded on biblical history pre
sent extraordinary difficulties for a true
realistic production and It was, therefore,
extremely satisfying to behold costumes
and scenery which were true enough to
suffice a Dore.
Marie Brandis in the title role surpassed
all her former performances and her pow
erful soprano was never heard to better
advantage. Her passionate acting moved
the audience to prolonged applause sev
eral times.
Antar. sung by Rhys Thomas, was a
well studied production, although his
Blnging was better than his acting.
Miss Merrill, for the first time during
the season, had a congenial partâ a role
where the sweetness of her voice could be
brought well Into playâ and she won re
peated applause.
Miss Elvia Crox evidenced again tnat
she is capable of excellent singing, her
Sulamlth being a pleasing, well presented
part.
William Schuster sang the high priest,
his big basso being at all times under
good control and agreeable.
King Solomon, in the hands of Maurice
de Vries, suited the voice and acting of
this artist extremely well, and all his
forces came into play as the wise ruler of
The sextet in the first act was a treat
and the finale in the third fascinating.
A great deal of credit for this splendid
performance ought to be given to the
chorus and to the untiring exertions of
Directors Hirshfeld and Lask, who have
really worked wonders in the short time
of preparation.
To-morrow Flotow's "Martha" is on the
programme. G. H. MORRE.
The Alhambra.
Mile. Almee Austin, the human fly, is
the feature of the new bill at the Al
hambra Theater. Her act Is really new
and Just about as sensational as any
thing in its class seen here in some time.
Previous to her inverted stroll about the
celling of the theater she indulged in a
series of aerial feats with her sister. Al
together the act is far above the aver
age. Fassi, the Russian danseuse, did
not complete her act for reasons ex
plained elsewhere in these columns. Co
rinne sang a number of songs and Mc-
Bride and Dallon told a number of hu
morous stories. Mr. and Mrs. Sidney
Drew "appeared In a new and clever one
act comedy, "Diana on the Chase." The
performance was quite up to the mark
which this popular couple have led their
admirers to expect. Slgnor del Puente
as usual sang well, but John Byrne,
titled as "The man with a style of his
own," ought to either change his style
or give up the stage as a means of sus
tenance. He Is a bad actor, but plays
the cornet In a conventional manner.
Baldwin.
Modjeseka gave her well-known Imper
sonation of Adrlenne Lecouvreur at the
Baldwin last night, playing the part of
the unfortunate actress with her old
verve and sympathy. Of the supporting
cast Mr. Lane was notably to the good as
the old prompter. Modjeska will appear
again as Mary Stuart to-night; the bal
ance of the week will be devoted to the
special production of "Antony and Cleo
patra." The Wednesday opening promises
to be a great event.
New Comedy Theater.
Plenty of fun for the present week Is
assured at the New Comedy Theater.
Harry Corson Clarke, supported by a clev
er company, presented Broadhurst's
HE QUIT IN DISGUST.
Timothu I. O'Brien, an Old-Time Politician, Resigns
From the Democratic Committee of One Hundred,
Timothy I. O'Brien, an old-time local politician of prominence, has
thrown a bombshell into the Democratic camp. He resigned yesterday
from the committee of one hundred and is at no pains to disguise his mo
tive. He was appointed to the committee without being consulted. He
knew nothing of his selection until he was informed that he had been
chosen to take part in the deliberations of the local organization and to
have a voice in its decisions. With this understanding he accepted the po
sition. He had not been actively Interested in politics since- his retirement
as License Collector and he determined to renew his work for his party.
After his appointment he was utterly ignored. He was simply one of
scores of political dummies erected into galvanic life to give dignity to a
clique of petty bosses. When he saw this situation he resigned, and In his
resignation voiced the opinion of a majority of his associates.
"What Happened to Jones," at the cozy
playhouse last evening and will continue
throughout the week. The play is ex
ceedingly laughable. Although it is said
that Clarke is at his best when he as
sumes a character that demands the sil
very locks of age, in Jones he has found
a part to which he is well adapted. The
witticisms in the piece are many and
funny situations numerous.
Grand Opera- House.
The production of that lurid melodrama,
"The Coast Guard," with the first appear
ance at that place of amusement of Miss
Maud Miller, daughter of Joaquin Miller,
the poet, and the debut of ; the Waterman
sisters in their coon: songs, drew a large
and more than usually- select â¢ audience ;at
ji- r..w,',, < - Orand" Oix>rn.houoe' even
ing. -s Miss Miller proved ar.very attractive
and sympathetic heroine. v She did a', neat
bit of acting In the last scene of the play
and made something like reality out of
the unreal, and improbable creation of the
author. ,-.-. ,;;â â  -â â :â¢â . .
The Alcazar.
"The First Born" commenced Its final
â week at the Alcazar last night to a
diminished house. It was announced that
owing to Miss Gertrude Tidball having
been suddenly called to New York Mlsg
Gretchen Lyons would assume the part
of Looey Tsing, the slave girl. Nothing
was lost by the change. Miss Lyons as
suming the part cleverly. She was re
calU-d twice. The curtain-raiser waa ho
lanU Reed's old friend, "Lend Me Your
Wife," a skit full of amusing complica
tions that kept the audience in good hu
mor. Wallace Shaw as Captain Abner
Tarbox, a bluff old sailor, waa particu
larly praiseworthy.
The Chutes Theater.
At the Chutes the new bill In the Free
Theater was well received by the usually
large Haight street Monday audience.
Marie Wood, soprano, approved by
Melba, was also approved by the Chute
clientele, and Burns and Evans, the
"Farmer and the Clown," made an acro
batic hit. Camilla does a pretty Cuban
dance and Oro, Clifford and Oro, In "Fun
in Chinatown," and Eusapla, transforma
tion dancer, varied their acts of last
week. The new moving pictures were
interesting, particularly one showing a
panorama of Market street, taken from a
moving car. The Zoo is at all times
attractive and new animals are constant
ly being added.
DEMOCRATIC TICKET
NEARING COMPLETION
MICHAEL J. KELLY WILL BE
NOMINEE FOR RECORDER.
Caucus of a Quartet Which Was Dis
turbed by Charges and Counter-
Charges ot Treachery.
Great was the consternation among the
members of the Democratic County Com
mittee of One Hundredâ Municipal Con-
ventionâ ratification meeting yesterday,
when they saw published in The Call the
fruits of their secret scheming and
treachery to certain of their own members
and to the party at large. There was only
one error in their slate as given in The
Call, that being in the candidate for Coro
ner, th% name of Dr. Francis Emerson
being Inadvertently substituted for that
of Dr. E. E. Hill. Dr. Emerson, is a Re
publican and will go before that conven
tion for the nomination for Coroner. Dr.
Hill, who is slated for the Democratic
nomination. Is at present in charge of the
Harbor Receiving Hospital.
Two places were left open in the slate â
Recorder and Surveyor â and the auto
cratic body was to have caucused again
yesterday morning to fill the vacancies.
The caucus was held, but only four mem
bers were present. And what a time those
four had. Charges of treason were flung
about so freely that everybody was hit,
and each sought to resent the imputa
tion by imputing treachery to some ab
sentee. Finally they calmed down suffi
ciently to endeavor to ascertain how their
carefully guarded slate could have be
come public, but It was plain that none
of the quartet pinned much faith to the
avowals of the others that they had noth
ing to do with it, and the attempt to dis
cover the supposed talking member was
given up.
The four of them turned their attention
to completing the slate, and the Record
ership was taken up. Michael J. Kelly,
at present a deputy in the office under
McGlynn, was booked for the nomination,
the slate makers being satisfied that
their selection would not be upset by the
others.
The Call's expose still rankled to such
an extent that the plotters gave up me
attempt to agree upon a candidate for
Surveyor, and adjourned until such time
as Mayor Phelan sees fit to hand in his
list of Supervisorial selections. This the
Mayor is expected to do by to-morrow.
A Severe Sentence.
Herbert Wilson, the contractor, con
victed by Judge Conlan of the charge ot
immoral conduct In Golden Gate Park,
was sentenced yesterday to pay a fine of
SSOO. with the alternative of six months
in the County Jail. He gave notice of ap
peal and his bonds were fixed in $1000.
THREW STALE EGGS.
Annie Creeg-an Creates a Disturbance
at Margaret Shepherd's
Lecture.
Annie Creeg-an, a domestic 25 years old,
was arrested last night on a charge of
battery and disturbing a public meeting.
Annie went into Odd Fellows' Hall,
where Margaret Shepherd is lecturing,
carrying with her a Rood supply of stale
eggs. As soon as the lecture was well
under way she began delivering these at
tiio npoalior with fairly good effect. x his
created an uproar immediately, and five
officers rushed in just in time to prevent
the disturbance becoming 1 more serious in
its nature.

FLEES WITH HIS
PRISONER ON A
SPECIAL ENGINE
An Indiana Sheriff Gets BanK
Wrecker Cadwallader Out of
the State.
flourishes a Revolver at an Officer Who Serves
a Habeas-Corpus Writ on H'") at
Truc^ee.
BTOCKTON, Sept. 19.â The rumbling
of wheels; a hack flying through the
streets, throwing mud at every turn;
within a criminal extradited by the
Governor and wanted in Indiana; a
special engine waiting In an out-of-the
way place; a handcuffed man thrown
from the carriage into the engine cab;
a pull of the lever, escaping steam, a
train off for the Nevada State line like
a flash, and one has a resume of the
story of the unwilling flight of C. H.
Cadwallader, the embezzler, which took
place this morning with many sensa
tional incidents.
As related In The Call on Sunday,
Governor Budd, who was in Stockton
on Saturday, notwithstanding the ob
jections of Attorney Levlnsky, extra
dited Cadwallader, who Is wanted in
Randolph County, Indiana, on seven
teen different charges of embezzlement
from the Citizens' Bank. To accom
modate the extradition proceedings a
continuance of the preliminary hearing
of the prisoner went over until this
afternoon. It was agreed between At
torney Levlnsky, Sheriff Cunningham
and the Governor, so Mr. Levinsky
holds, that the much-looked-for habeas
corpus proceedings would be instituted
at 9 o'clock this morning. The Sheriff
recalls no such mutual understanding.
This morning, shortly before 9, At
torney Levinsky went over to the Jail
where Cadwallader was confined. The
petition for a writ of habeas corpus
was read by Cadwallader and the af
fidavit sworn to after the prisoner had
been turned over by Sheriff Cunning
ham to Sheriff Simmons of Indiana.
This, of course, was unknown to Le
vinsky.
Levinsky left his client In the Jail
and ran over to the Courthouse, where
Judge Jones mtfde the order for the
writ returnable at 1:30 to-morrow.
Back to the Jail went Attorney LeÂ»
vlnsky, supposing that the papers
would be served.
When Levinsky left the Jail to go to
the Courthouse, Simmons clapped the
handcuffs on Cadwallader and then
handcuffed the man to himself. The
door of the Jail was thrown open and
down the steps they went. Simmons
was occompanied by Witness Paskell,
who came out to identify the prisoner.
Once on the street, a turn was made
east on Channel street; there was a
wave of the hand and a closed hack
drove up posthaste. Cadwallader made
resistance, but was thrown bodily into
the carriage, the door was banged shut
and off went the horses under the lash.
At Aurora street a turn was made
north to Park at a rapid pace; thence
to the railroad. There a special en
gine was waiting. The fireman had
steam up to the last notch and she was
blowing off so hard that It was difficult
to urge the horses up to the desired
spot. The turn was made Â»Â»i a Jiffy,
the hack door thrown open, Cadwalla
der taken out and in a minute he was
in the enerine cab, still handcuffed to
the Sheriff. The signal was given and
the engine dashed up the track toward
Sacramento at breakneck speefl.
Then came a chase. As soon as At
torney Levlnsky found that he was
tricked he rang for a hack and started
In pursuit. He thought that the Sheriff
Intended to get away on the 9:20 o'clock
train with his prisoner. Jumping out
of his carriage at the depot he rushed
Into the cars, and as the train started
to pull out he found that the bird was
not there. From a friend he learned
that a special engine had left farther
up the track i.nder suspicious circum
stances, and the attorney knew that the
Jig was up, and returned to his office
to follow up the other means at his dis
posal.
The hackman who assisted In the
flight was "Billy" Anderson.
"We had It all fixed up last night,"
he Bald. "I was to have my carriage
at the corner of Sutter and Channel
streets and out of sight of the Jail. 1
was to be stationed at a convenient
point and when I got the signal I was
to give It to my driver, who was to
whip up, wheel around, get his man
and be off. Everything worked fine."
Attorney Levlnsky wired to the peace
officers all along the line as far up as
Truckee to stop the engine by virtue
of an order Issued out of the Superior
Court of this county. Levinsky said:
"I believe from the authorities which
I have consulted that the Governor can
recall his warrant, if subsequent facts
show that he made an error in granting
the requisition. In view of Budd's dis
tinct understanding with the Indiana
man at the time he granted the requi
sition, that the law should be allowed
to take its course and that the Eastern
sheriff did not do so, I would not be
surprised if Budd recalled the warrant.
He can do so at any time before the
officer reaches Indiana â in fact under
certain conditions, he may do so then.
I may go to Indiana to testify to the
Irregular proceedings here If the case
should progress that far."
Levinsky to-day caused a writ of ha
beas corpus to issue in the Superior
Court at Sacramento, and It was tele
graphed to Truckee. Deputy Sheriff
Harvey telegraphed late to-night that
he served it on the Indiana sheriff, who
went on with his prisoner. It now re
mains to be seen what the Superior
Court of Sacramento and the Governor
will do in contempt proceedings. The
Robb case Is a precedent In this State.
SIMMONS AND HIS
PISTOL HOLD THE FORT
TRUCKEB, Sept. 19.â Excitement
was created here this evening when
passenger train No. 1 arrived bearing
Sheriff Simmons and the defaulting
banker, Cadwallader, Constable Heff of
Emigrant GGatp t Placer County, aided by
Truckee peace offlcerÃ, endeavored to
Btop Cadwallader and Simmons. Sim
mons boarded the east-bound train here
with his prisoner. Cadwallader's attor
neys, determined not to be outwitted,
dispatched Constable Hess at Emigrant
Gap to serve the summons on Simmons
and take him off the train. Hess tried
to do as he was Instructed, but it did
not suit Simmons, who chained his
rrlsoner to himself and kept on his
journey.
Hess fretted and fumed till he ar
rived at Truckee, where he expected to
get his man with the assistance of the
officers here, they having been Instruct
ed in the meantime to Berve papers on
Slmmona. Constable Long, Deputy
McÃae and Deputy Sheriff Harvey
were all at the depot, and with Hess,
endeavored to persuade Simmons to get
off the train, but he steadfastly refused
and with his right hand handcuffed to
ills prisoner and .with a pistol in his left
hÂ« warned all comers to keep their
hands off at their peril. He willingly
accepted the summons, but denied any
authority to remove him from the train.
Long entreated and Hess stormed, but
Simmons, as firm as a rock, stayed in
the seat and said, "hands off," with his
pistol leveled over his knee.
The instructions received by the
Truckee officers did not say to take him
off the train, so they were not bo de
termined as they might have been, es
pecially with all the grit and determina
tion there was behind that ominous gun,
and Hess could do nothing. So the
train pulled out, taking Simmons and
his prisoner on to their destination,
while Hess gave up the chase and re
turned empty-handed to his home.
SACRAMENTO OFFICER
TRICKED BY SIMMONS
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 19.âAttor
ney Albert M. Johnson had been
employed through a firm of Stockton
lawyers to sue out a writ of habeas
corpus and serve the papers on Sheriff
Simmons as soon as the latter should
reach Sacramento with his prisoner.
Johnson and Deputy Sheriff Hinters
thought Cadwallader would be brought
up on the regular morning train, but
when they reached the depot they
learned that a locomotive, drawing only
a tender and carrying two mysterious
passengers, had preceded the Stockton
train, paused at the depot a moment
and then spe*. eastward. When the
regular train arrived the Deputy Sheriff
found how neatly he had been baffled.
Railroad men here had been instruct
ed to let the engine pass on its way
without hindrance or unnecessary de
lay.
HOW CADWALLADER
WRECKED A BANK
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.âAn India
napolis, Ind., special to the Herald
says: Charles H. Cadwalrader, the
fugitive Union City Bank cashier, will
soon be within the borders of Indiana.
He will be taken, to Union City, where
he will be tried, and "Jeffersonville
Prison" may be his future address when
citizens whose bank accounts dwindled
to almost nothing when Cadwallader
left are through with their prosecu
tion.
The bank of which Cadwallader was
cashier operated under State laws. He,
through his position, was enabled to
cover up his peculations, which
amounted to nearly $75,000. A large
part of the rhoney went to wheat
gamblers in Chicago, being lost in
speculation. When he left Indiana Cad
wallader had fully $25,000 and some of
this money has been recovered.
It was almost two years ago when
Cadwallader left Union City. The bank
was obliged to close its doors and the
losses to the people of the community
were heavy. Many farmers did busi
ness at the bank and these suffered
considerably as the result of the opera
tions of Cadwallader. There has been
general rejoicing In and about Union
City since the man was caught.
AN INSANE MAN
LOST^ROM A TRAIN
Predicament of A. 0. Malone of Oak
land, Who Was Taking W.
0. Greebe East.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept 19.â A- C.
Malone of Oakland, Cal., reported to
Chief of Police Strauss of Topeka, Kans.,
to-day that he had lost an insane man
whom he was taking from Oakland to Mt.
Clements, Mich., and asked for assist
ance in locating him. The Insane man's
name is W. C. Greobe, and he has been
in a private asylum at Oakland for some
months. Recently it was thought he had
recovered sufficiently so that it would be
safe to send him to his brother's home in
Michigan in charge of conductora. He
was started on his Journey a week ago to
day, but while the train was running
through the Mojave desert Greebe made a
wild dash and jumped from the train. He
was recaptured, however, and his friends
at Oakland notified. Mr. Malone then
started with him in charge and had no
trouble with him until Kansas was
reached. At Hutchinson at 10:80 last night
Malone fell asleep, and when he awoke
at Lawrence, 200 miles this side, this
morning Greebe was gone. No one saw
him leave the train, and it is not known
whether he decamped at a station or
whether he Jumped from the train while
It was in motion. Energetic telegraphing
to-day has failed to locate the missing
man.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, Sept. 19.â The Demo
cratic-Silver Republican-Popullstic vol
cano Is "raging and throwing . lurid
chunks of anything that will fuse or
savor of fusion. The wildest excitement
prevails In every , precinct in the
county. John McGonlgle, the stalwart
Democrat, the editor and proprietor of
the Ventura Democrat, and the ap
pointee of Governor Budd as one of the
trustees of Highlands Asylum, and a
member of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee, has bolted the fushion
ticket. In an editorial last Friday, en
entitled "A Few ./ords," he says:
Party nominations have been made in
this county and the tickets are before
the voters for their support or. rejection.
And while we would delight, from a per
sonal standpoint, if . such a thing were
possible, to see all candidates on both
tickets succeed in Â©very undertaking in
which they engage, , all things equal, . as
the editor of a- pronounced Democratic
paper,' we ; would be derelict In duty and
fraudulent In our prÂ«tAnsiono - l * â â¢*'Â» <*'<* j
not draw the line at politics. Therefore
this' paper will support in the present
election the candlates who represent the
principles of the Democratic party, and
when we fail to promulgate the pedi
grees, extoll the virtues * and , slobber â on
the necks of gentlemen who compose the
opposition ticket, we desire it understood
that it is not because we have not as
warm regard for them as citizens and
friends as we have for other people, but
simply for the reason that it is not in the
line of the political end of our business.
We have no fears we shall live to see
the day when differences in political opin
ion will cause us to undervalue the friend
ship and respect of men whose
politics do â¢ not accord with ours,
but not being a professional toady,
dirt-eater and . slobberer, we could
not ' blow hot and cold â¢ : with the ; same
breath if we were to try ever so hard.
The Democrat . will treat the . Republican
candidates, as it always has, fairly and
decently in everything pertaining to the
campaign, and will aid them by publish
ing their cards (lor the usual fee) from
now until election day, because that is a
matter of mutual business, but that con
sideration will not move us to support
both tickets and sleep indiscriminately
with all the candidates.
As Its ; title implies, the Democrat is . a
Democratic paper, it is known at home
and abroad as such, and we fly that flag
and are not ashamed of it. .; We support
alone the candidates. that do political bat
tle under that banner, and we . would be
the veriest hypocrite and dunghill were
we to do otherwise. For fifteen' years we
have unflinchingly pursued that course in
Ventura County, and no compliment has
been more appreciated by us than the dec
laration from our â¢ respected political :â  op
ponents ; that "McGonigle is an uncom
promising' Democrat, but we always know
where to find him." â >.-.. v. â¢;. v
These few words fell like a thunder
bolt in the camp of the fusionists. Ex
cited knots of Democrats, Populists
and Silver Republicans could be seen
on every street corner discussing the
article. The Populists and Silver Re
publicans were violent in condemning
the article and threatened to cut every
Democrat on the ticket.
The strength of the Silver Republicans
and Populists in this county is placed
at about 800 votes, and with this vote
against them the Democratic ticket
would be beaten 800 or 900 votes. The
Democrats are desperate. The article
not only hurts their county ticket, but
will cost Maguire and Toland a large
number of votes.
McGonlgle has been busy all day
trying to explain the article to the rav
ing Democrats, wild-e-^ed Populists and
silver-lined Republicans. The more he
explains, the madder they get, and no
doubt his . editorial will prove the
Waterloo of every man on the fusion
ticket, with the exception of Donlon for
Assessor, who has no opponent.

MXD-ROADS ABE AGGRESSIVE.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 19.-The Middle
of-the-Road Populists have decided to
hold a convention in a few days and to
nominate a complete county ticket. J.
E. Camp, a member of the anti-Fuslonist
Populist State Central Committeo, is au
thority for the statement that the decis
ion of Secretary of State Brown, that the
anti-Fusionists were entitled to the name
"People's party," has it^duced his wing
of the party to organize and hold county
conventions all over the State.
SECRETARY ALGER
HAS TENDERED
HIS RESIGNATION
Head of the War Department
Ready to Give Up the
Office.
Verbally Asks the President to Retire Him,
but He Expects Vindication by
Investigation.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â The Washington correspon
dent of the World telegraphs : Secretary of War Alger
has placed his resignation at the President's disposal^
This was his last official act before leaving Washington
ten days ago, yet the fact has just come to light.
A member of the Cabinet, who was
asked for corroboratlon of the report,
said: "It would not be unnatural for
Alger to ask to be relieved. In view of
the circumstances."
When the Secretary called at the Ex
ecutive Mansion one week ago laat
Thursday night and presented to Pres
ident McKinley a letter asking for an
investigation of the War Department
and its various subdivisions, he inform
ed the President he would leave the
Cabinet at any time the President saw
fit to relieve him. The resignation was
not made out in writing, but was ten
dered to the President verbally.
Alger*s decision to take this step was
not the result of hasty action, but the
logical outcome of weeks of unfavor
able criticism from the press and public
on the conduct of the war. Although
he has endeavored to maintain outward
calm. It is known he has suffered Be
verely under the fire.
Whether or not the resignation will
be accepted is undetermined. The
President has the highest regard for
Alger, and believes him to be a worthy
and competent official. Unless the in
vestigation determines the contrary,
the President will probably stand
shoulder to shoulder with his Secre
tary.
VOLUNTEERS FOR
CUBAN GARRISONS
Forty Thousand Troops
to Be Sent
IN ADDITION TO THOSE THERE
WILL NOT WAIT FOR SPANISH
EVACUATION.
As the Rainy Season Is Closing There
Will Not Be Much Sickness
Among the American
Soldiers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Sept 19.â 1t is the
present Intention of the administration
to send to Cuba as a garrison force for
the Island about 40,000 troops, In addi
tion to the force now at Santiago under
command of General Lawton.
The organizations which are to com
prise the Cuban garrison have not all
been designated yet, but It is assured
that at least half of them will be vol
unteers. Within two weeks orders will
be Issued for the movement to Cuba of
the first 10,000 of the permanent garri
son, and it Is the expectation now that
they will sail from the United States
about October 10. These troops will be
followed quickly by others, until the en
tire force of 40,000 has been established
on the island.
It la not the Intention of the admin
istration to await the evacuation of the
island by the Spanish forces before
sending United States troops to Cuba,
as the indications now are that It may
be several months before the Cuban
Commissioners complete their work.
Quite naturally a considerable number
of Spanish troops will remain on the
Island until the arrangements for the
relinquishment of Spanish sovereignty
over it formally have been concluded.
The rainy season in Cuba is nearly
at an end ,and the most delightful sea
son of the year on thÂ» Island is about
to begin. During the late fall and win
ter months the climate in Cuba is not
only enjoyable but healthful, and with
such care as will be taken for the
health and comfoct of the American
forces to be stationed In Cuba, officials
of the War Department have no fear
that serious illness among the men will
follow the occupation of the Island.
SHAFTER'S BALLOONS
AT OMAHA'S SHOW
And President McKinley Hay Make
an Ascension Before the Ex
position Closes.
OMAHA, Sept. 19.â The captive balloons
used by Shatter's army in the advance
upon Santiago have reached the exposi
tion grounds and the officers' of the Unit
ed States Signal Corps are getting them
ready for daily ascensions. It is said
that President McKinley intends to make
an ascension during his visit to the ex
position.
ORDER OF SCOTLAND.
CINCINNATI, Bept. 19.â The Order s of
Scotland held its twenty-fifth annual con
vention at the Scottish Rite Cathedral
here to J day. Over a hundred members
were present. This lodge is the only one
In the United States, and is under the
jurisdiction *of the Provincial Grand
Lodge at Edinburgh, Scotland. The order
is one of the oldest In existence. The
Provincial Lodge of America has Juris
diction over Hawaii and Japan.
The regular routine of business was
transacted at the morning session, after
which a recess was taken until 2 p. m.,
when the degree of the order was con
ferred on fifteen candidates. The head
of the order is Judge Josiah Hayden
Dmmraond, R. L. F., Provincial Grand
Lodge Master of H. M. R., Portland, Me.
Among the officers Is Sir Thomas H. Cas
well, San Francisco, Deputy Provincial
Grand Master*
It is known that Secretary Alger ex
pects to be vindicated by the official In
vestigation. He does not think the
blame for camp horrors and misman
agement of affairs generally can be
traced direotly to his door.
"A scapegoat Is what the press wants
and It has taken me," said Alger a few
days before his departure. "But I re
fuse to be the goat"
Prominent Republicans 'In various
sections of the country, however, have
warned the President that the con
tinued presence of Secretary Alger In
the Cabinet would result in the loss of
Republican votes.
The Washington correspondent of the
Herald says: President McKinley will
probably be able to announce In a few
days the names of the nine men who
will serve on the Military Investigating
Commission, thus bringing It up to the
number he at first desired. In addition
to the six, who had previously ac
cepted, It can be said to-night that the
President has selected Charles Stewart
Smith, president of the Chamber of
Commerce of New York; General Ste
phen D. Lee of Mississippi' and General
Jackson of Tennessee, a brother of the
late Judge Jackson of the Supreme
Court. It Is probable that General
Dodge of New York will be made chair
man of the commission.
KINGS COUNTY'S
JUDICIAL LOSS
Death Removes Justice
Jacobs.
HAD BEEN FAILING SOME TIME
SCRAMBLE OP THREE CANDI
DATES FOR THE PLACE.
The Battle Royal for the Vacant Po
sition Between Dixon L. Phil
lips, M. L. Short and Horace
L. Smith.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HANFORD, Sept. 19.â Superior Judge
Justin Jacobs of Kings County died
yesterday In Oakland, where he went
to receive medical attention two
months ago. He was elected to the
bench in 1893 and has served ever since.
Judge Jacobs had been a sufferer from
diabetes for two years. He was a na
tive of New York, aged 54 years.
His death has been expected for some
time, and some of the candidates for
his position have been making a quiet
light for the position, but as soon as the
news of Jacobs' death reached Here the
fight for the Judgeship opened In earn
est. There are three candidates for the
positionâ Dlxon L. Phillips, M. L. Short
and Horace L. Smith. The Republicans,
having no available candidate, they
held a caucus last night, and It Is given
out that they have given their support
to Horace L. Smith, a gold Democrat
Phillips has sent out a petition to Gov
ernor Budd for the appointment, and
Short's friends are at work in his be
half. The Democratic Central Com
mittee has taken i.o action as to in
dorsing any of the candidates to the
Governor, nor is It likely that any ac
tion will be taken, as the appointment
will only hold until the election In No
vember, and three of the candidates
mentioned wjll come out as independ
ent candidates. The only Republican
attorney In the county Is running for
District Attorney, and it is expected
that most of their strength will go to
Smith. Short is now District Attor
ney, while Phillips was defeated for
Superior Judge In 1893 by Judge Ja
cobs. As it iooks at present the fight
for the appointment by the Governor is
between Short and Phillips, and both
are confident of the position. The fignt
will be shifted to Sacramento In a day
or two.
RUHLIN FAILS TO
SCORE A KNOCK-OUT
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.-Gus Ruhlln, the
Akron giant, met Eddie Dunkhorst of
Syracuse for a twenty-flve-round bout
at catch weights before the Greater New
York Club to-night and outfought and
outpointed the Syracuse boy for twenty
two rounds, but was unable to knock him
out. The referee stooped the bout in the
twenty-second round and awarded thÂ»
fight to Ruhlin. Dunkhorst was hog fat
and weighed about *20 pounds. Ruhlin
gave his weight as 195. Dunkhorst was
elmply an animated punching bag and
took enough punishment to settle a half
dozen boxers. At the outset no one
thought the bout would last ten rounds,
and the power of endurance exhibited by
the big pugilist surprised Ruhlin as much
as It did the spectators.
ALL CRETAN TURKS

CANDLa, Island of Crete, Sept. 19.â

Victor Colwell, Soq of a Respected Fan)ily,

t^e County Prison.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 19.â Just as the
stage which runs between Bolinas and
this city reac.'.cd an old bridge on
â¢what is known as the Jory ranch, about
seven miles from town, at 9:30 o'clock
this morning, a masked highwayman
arose from his seat at the foot, of a
live oak tree, presented a revolver and
ordered the driver, named Wallace Say
ers, to stop. Sayers complied, but when
ordered to dismount from his seat re
plied that one of his horses was un
ruly.
"I will hold them," was the retort.
"You do as I say."
The passengers were lined up and
Payers was then forced at the point of
the revolver to search their pockets.
There were six passengers, three of
whom were ladies. The latter were not
molested.
The driver obtained $30 05 In cash
and two gold watches. The robber was
dissatisfied with the search and feeling
In the pockets of one of the men found
a $10 bill.
After ordering the driver to throw
the money and valuables upon the
ground the highwayman permitted the
stage to proceed on its way to San
Rafael. Sayers at once rushed to the
Courthouse in search of Sheriff Harri
pnn and told him the facts. Harrison
organized a popse consisting of himself,
Constable Louis Hughes, George Ag
new, James Gordon and Isaac Smith.
Before their departure Harrison
learned the man's description and also
the driver's belief that he was Victor-
Colwell. a teamster, who for the last
three months has been working as a
brakeman on the narrow-gauge rail
way. About midway between Tamal
pais Station and Greenbrae Colwell, for
he it was, was overtaken by the posse
and brought to town. At first he denied
his guilt, but when they reached Ross
Station Sayers identified Colwell by his
dress. He was searched and there wefe
found in his possession the money, the

Jockey Piggott Gets a Reprimand
for Going to the Starting Post
With a "Plug" Hat Over
His Brain.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sent. 18.â The two
weeks' race meeting under the auspices of
the California Jockey Club opened at
Agricultural Park to-day with only a fair
crowd in attendance. The fields were
light and the prospect of short-priced fa
vorites no doubt kept the attendance down.
Charles F. Price of Louisville and J. W.
Wilson of Sacramento officiated in the
stand and their decisions gave perfect
satisfaction. Seven books laid prices that
were not parboiled.
It was pleasant sailing for the first
choices, San Mateo being the only one to
spoil the board. Marplot, a i-to-6 chance,
was given a rub by Carbineer, being ex
tended all the way, and in the final event
Homestake, a friendless 10u-to-l shot, cut
quite a swath by finishing second to
Moringa. Rubicon. Himera and Stepabout
were the other winners.
On his recent good performances San
Mateo, with P. Sullivan and 115 pounds In
the saddle, was installed an even-money
choice for the opening five and a half
furlong sprint, but roguish old Rubicon
led all the way and won galloping. Gus
Wilson strolled along from the far rear,
taking the place with Etta II from the
favorite. Sullivan on the latter took his
mount back as the barrier was released,
losing much ground. The winner was 3
to 1 in the betting.
Thp Gold Finch filly Hemera had a
strong call in the betting over the other
tour entries in the six-furlough scramble
**>r two-year-olds and, with Frawley up,
v.ri cleverly at the end. Magdalenas
?>Â«4 a world of speed during the early
Ktapr-s of the running, but found the route
too far and began stopping at the pad
dock. She lasted long enough to lake the
place from Ocorona.
Thrrf wae very little to choose between
Stepabnut and Kruna to win the mile
and seventy yard selling run, 2 to 1 be
inx obtainable against either. Stepabout
was possessed of the speed of the party
and, maintaining tho lead throughout, led
Kruna pan the wire by over a length.
Pedro Enoa to..k matters a trifle too leis
urely astride Sea Spray, finishing a dis
tant third. Ockturuck was well backed,
but found the route too far.
Tom Boyle's gelding, Moringa, was her
alded as the correct thing for the nnal
six-furlong sprint, and tfre bookmaking
fraternity laid no better than even money
against him. It lookpd at one time as
though Lady Britannic would land, but
eho stopped th<Â» last sixteenth and the
favorite assumed command, beating the
rank outsider, HomestaJce, two lengths In
1:15%.

watches and even the handkerchief
that had served as a mask.
Colwell then admitted his guilt and
said he had eaten hardly anything for
three days, hunger forcing him to the
crime. In a prison cell the man broke
down completely and sobbed.
"O God! This Is terrible on my poor
mother and 6lster," he moaned.
The robbery has created a great sen
sation here on account of the promi
nence of Colwell's relatives. His
brother, Grant Colwell, was one of the
first to Join Roosevelt's Rough Riders
and generally distinguished himself in
the Cuban campaign at Santiago. Miss
Idelle Colwell, his only sister, Is a dep
uty clerk in County Clerk Bonneau's
office and Is highly esteemed in the
community. The father, Jesse Col
well, and his wife are well and favora
bly known.
Victor Colwell himself is only 25
years of age and has hitherto borne a
good reputation, though of late he has
drank a good deal and was reprimanded
in a fatherly manner for the fault by
Superintendent Shoemaker of the
North Pacific Coast Railway Com
pany.
The passengers on the stage when
the robbery was committed were a
Miss Hutchinson of 806 Valencia street,
San Francisco; Lucas Cadogan of 327
Pine street, San Francisco; Mrs. J.
Stewart of San Francisco, a coachman
and a Chinese, who has been employed
at the Flagstaff Inn, Bolinas, for the
past three months.
Cadogan had about $100 In a purse
which Colwell failed to obtain. Say
ers lost $10 himself. The Chinaman
laughed in high glee when the stage
rolled safely into town. Said he:
â¢ "Me velly clute. Got lots money In
inslide plocket. Lobber no find, clause
me glot heap many plockets."
.Sheriff Harrison asserts that if he
had not i taken the revolver away as
soon as 'Colwell was arrested he be
lieves the fellow would have committed
suicide on the spot. The penitent pris
oner himself says the only reason he
did not open fire on the pursuing posse
was a personal friendship for Sheriff
Harrison and his family.

BEATEN TO DEATH
BY HIS RIVAL FOR
A WOMAN'S LOVE
Salioas Excited by Ugly Ruroors
CoQcerQiQg Charles Maguire's
Demise.
Was Said to Have Jumped prom a Window
W^ile Sleep-WalKing, but Facts Dis
prove the Story.
SALINAS. Sept. 19.â Mystery shrouds
the death of Charles H. Maguire, which
occurred shortly after midnight last
night, and there are afloat rumors of
foul play and attempts to hide a crime
for the purpose of shielding the dead
man's name and his sorrowing family
from disgrace. 'Among the reports cur
rent is one that Magulre was killed by
an outraged husband.
On September 7 Salinas was startled
by the report of an accident at Spreck
els. Maguire, a bartender at the hotel
there, had gone to sleep early In the
J evening, had dreamed that the hotel
was on flre, and, whil<* dreaming, had
jumped from a third-story window to
the ground, a distance of forty-five
feet. Doctors who were first called
claimed that his hip was broken and
that he had received probably fatal In
juries, but two days subsequently an
other doctor denied that any bones ex
cept the left wrist were injured, and
up to Saturday last held and reported
that Maguire was improving and would
recover. Yesterday it was reported that
the injured man was dying, and to-day
his death was announced.
Hardly was Maguire reported dead
when ugly reports, which had been cur
rent from the day after the supposed
accident, were again revived and open
ly "'scu-sed by every one. No one de
nied a rumor to the effect that on the
night of the alleged accident a woman,
said to be one who had left her hus
band and two children to come to Sa
linas from San Francisco with a mar
ried man, had retired to a room in the
hotel, and was p on after followed by
Maguire. At about 11 o'clock the same
evening the man with whom the
woman had eloped, appeared unexpect
edly and attacked Maguire. Maguire
went outside and showed fight, but was
sobn beaten into insensibility, dragged
under the window and left for dead.
Intimate friends say, however, that
the couple were caught by a man and
two friends in one of the cottages at
Spreckels. Maguire attempted to es
cape, but was Bet upon and terribly
beaten.
When the Coroner and District At
torney, hearing of Maguire's possible
death, went yesterday to take his ante
mortem statement, they were informed
that Maguire was unconscious. Others
since state that Maguire could have
made one if he had been allowed to do
so.
Despite the reports made by the doc
tor previously that no. bones were
broken or serious injuries inflicted, this
afternoon the same medico grave out
the information that Maguire had sus
tained a complete fracture of the right
hip, had ruptured the kidneys and had
received terrible internal injuries. He
had also severe bruises over both eyes,
both of which were blackened, and his
entire body was almost covered with
bruises. Despite the statements of
himself and family, who deny such re
ports, no inquest was demanded; no
post mortem was held; no inquiry was
made by his parents. To-night it was
stated that the deceased made a state
ment to his parents to the effect that
he had been beaten. Everywhere on
the streets the case is being discussed
and when the person accused of hav
ing inflicted the fatal beating was
searched for it was discovered that he
had disappeared. It is said he departed
a few days ago when he heard that
HOLD-UP OF THE BOLINAS STAGE.
Magulre's injuries would likely prove
fatal. When the report was current
that Maguire would recover, it is said,
this man acknowledged that he had
beaten him, and said that when Ma
guire's room was searched the window
would be found closed and the frame
Intact. Such was the case and Ma
guire's clothes cannot be found.
The woman remains at Spreckels but
refuses to be interviewed, as do all oc
cupants of the house. While practically
admitting foul play every one is anx
ious to keep the matter dark. The
county officials also are reticent on the
subject and quiet excitement pervades
the entire locality. The Grand Jury
which will convene on Monday next
will probably take up and investigate
the reports, several members of that
body having become cognizant of the
curious condition of affairs. ~mce the
report that the Grand Jury would in
vestigate the cause of death has be
come public talk, the mother, brother
a*|d betrothed of Maguire have been
interviewed by officials and friends and
each interview was contradictory of the
other. No two statements as to how
the accident occurred agree. One says
Maguire Jumped from a window after
having opened it; another -that he
jumped out without opening it, while
a third says he crawled out, hung on
the sill and dropped.
The stories further disagree as to the
condition of Maguire before his death.
One states that he was totally uncon
scious for nearly twelve hours, another
for twenty-four hours and another that
he was conscious until within an hour
of his demise. All agree on one fact,
that about eight or nine hours before
his death Maguire was delirious and
that during the delirium he went over
the entire scene before the accident and
cried for help, mentioning names and
pleading for mercy.
A contractor at the factory, named
Farnsworth, one of the men who found
Maguire, says he was awakened by
groans and cries for aid underneath
h|f window. He opened the window,
put his head out and asked who it was
and what was wanted. The reply
came:
"It is Maguire. Help me; I'm badly
hurt." *
When questioned closely Farnsworth
refused to say whether Maguire said he
had been Injured by a fall or by other
means. He assisted in taking Maguire
to his room. He noticed that the win
dow was small, was open only about six
inches and the frame was Intact and
the curtains drawn.
Severe criticisms of the various offi
cials for not making a full Investiga
tion prior to the burial of Maguire,
which is announced for to-morrow
morning, are made. Although much
sympathy is expressed for the family
of the dead man all demand that if
there has been foul play, even though
the report of the cause be true, his
slayer and the latter's accomplices
should be arrested and brought to Judg
ment for their crime.

Railway Men's Political Club of Los
Angeles Defends Its Members
Against an Uncalled-For
Attack.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 19.â The first
meeting of a Railway Men's Political
Club held in California at which a
newspaper reporter was present was
the session of the Los Angeles club this
evening:, which was convened in En
gineer Hall on New Main street. A
representative of The Call requested
to be permitted to attend and by unan
imous consent he was permitted to
make a full report of the meeting with
the simple statement from the presi
dent that the proceedings be in no way
distorted.
The first Railway Employes' Political
Club was organized, here about the
middle of July last. Since then similar
organizations have been formed in the
State. There are two clubs in San
Francisco, one of which meets every
Friday evening at 8:30 o'clock in Pyth
ian Temple at Fifth and Market streets.
There are two clubs in Oakland, two
in Sacramento and two here. The two
Los Angeles clubs are made up, one of
Southern Pacific employes and the
otlper of Santa Fe men. The Southern
Pacific employes' organization has 355
members and it is the one that met
to-night. The meetings are executive
for the reason, as President Clough
states, that the objects and aims of
the organiaztion can be best accom
pliehed in that way.
About 200 members were in attend
ance at the session this evening when it
was called to order. Later other mem
bers entered. The members are men
engaged in all branches of railroad
service and far above the standard of
membership in ordinary political clubs.
They were, in the discussions, free in
expressing their opinions in good, for
cible English. No member indulged in
discussion of partisan politics, and
there was no abuse of individuals,
either in public or private life.
After some preliminary business had
been transacted the secretary read the
following resolution:
WHEREAS, The Los Angeles Times,
in its issue of Monday, September
12, 1898, unjustly and untruthfully
takes occasion to vilify the mem
bers of this club by designating
them as "serfs," and states that the
Southern Pacific Company is whip
ping its employes into a surrender"
of their political rights, herding
them, intimidating them, etc. Beit
Resolved, That we hereby reaffirm
o'iir privilege as free-born American
citizens to combine for our best in
terests as we see fit.
That we believe, and positively as
sert without fear of truthful contra
diction, that a man may, if he
chooses, work for a railroad or any
other corporation without being
any less a man, and that he can do
so without sacrificing either his
manhood or his political rights.
That we denounce the statements
above quoted as base, cowardly, ma
licious and false, written by a full
fledged son of the father of lies
rtnd published in a so-called, self
styled Republican newspaper, but
which is handled in the interests
of whomsoever will submit to its
dictation, Irrespective of political
affiliations.
That we utterly refuse to submit
to coercion and abuse from the in
solent personal organ of a man
whom the Republican party of the
great State of California has re
peatedly repudiated, and who most
unworthily wears his present barre*
military honors, which were only
given him after his long-continued,
persistent, servile, importunate
whining at the back door of a po
litical party he never fails to be
tray.
That we will not support and will
use all honorable means to show our
condemnation of a paper that will,
without any cause, except its own
envy and malicious efforts to as
sume the position of dictator of
Southern California (which, if suc
cessful, would be serfdom indeed
for our citizens), to misrepresent
and vilify a large, respectable and
honorable portion of our com
munity, which in no way merits its
filthy abuse.
That a copy of these resolutions
be sent to the Los Angeles Times,
Herald, Express, Record and Labor
World and the San Francisco Call,
and that a copy be sent to similar
clubs to our own, that all may know
its true character as a despicable
example of yellow newspaperdom
and outside the fold of decent and
honorable journalism.
As soon as the resolutions were pre
sented President Clough called for a
full discussion of them. He said that
he did not want the resolutions rushed
through, as they were important, and
every member should understand their
purport. He suggested that if any one
had objections to make then waa the
time to make them.
T. J. McGonlgle of the locomotive de
partment took up the cudgel and for a
few minutes General Otis received a se
vere scorching. McGonigle said that as
far as he was concerned he did not care
who knew he belonged to the organiza

tion. He was an American citizen and
proposed to exercise the right of suf
frage free from the dictation of any
one. He had joined the Railway Men's
Political Club for an honorable pur
nose and he was not ashamed of it. One
thing he did not propose should pass
without his protest was the statement
of the Los Angeles Times that he was a
slave and a serf, and that the employes
of the Southern Pacific had been robbed
of the right of franchise and their man
hood.
"Ninety per cent of the men whom
the Times had designated as serfs,"
said McGonigle, "own their own homes
in this city. Th^y are honorable and
respected citizens and have as much
right to organize a political club as any
other body of citizens."
President Clough stated that one of
the questions at issue in the campaign
was whether the Los Angeles Times
was the Republican party of California
or not.
"If that courageous and able leader.
Major McLaughlin," said President
Clough, "had submitted to the insolent
dictation of the Times, then indeed
would the party in Southern California
be in a pitiable plight. But Major Mc-
Laughlin stood by his manhood in
naming the executive committee and
thereby incurred the enmity of the
Times; but he demonstrated his manly
independence."
It was finally decided that it would
be ill-advised tp place the organization
on the same pteine as the Times, so the
clause referring to Otis was stricken
out and the resolutions as amended
were adopted by a unanimous vote.
For the benefit of the railroad men
present, who had not yet joined the
club. President Clough made a brief
statement as to its objects and alms.
Among other things he said:
"We are not organized for the pur
pose of accepting dictation from any
one as. to how we shall vote. "We are
organized to protect ourselves and to
see to it that men hi the employ of
railroad corporations are not, because .
of that fact, debarred from political
prominence and preferment. In this
campaign we do not expect to accom
plish much, but two and four years
from now we do expect to be able to
put a railway employe on the State
ticket of the two parties and to get
representation on the county ticket.
We are entitled to it and we are going
to see to it that we get it. Right now
we neither ask for nor expect anything.
"I myself hrmded to the editor of the
Times a circular setting forth the ob
jects and aims of this organization and
asked for a favorable notice. He used
the circular I -ive him and ptsied us
serfs and slaves. We see no reason
why a railroad employe is not entitled
to recognition politically as well as sa
loon bums and professional politicians
â who never do an honest day's work in
their lives. We claim that by united
action we can make the railroad em
ploye a factor in politics and put down
the impression that he is a political
outcast."
T. J. McGonigle made a brief address
condemnatory of demagogues. In which
he said:
"We all know that Uncle Collis is not
a philanthropist. He pays us the best
wages, though, paid by any railroad in
the country. If you cut off the en
tire revenue of thÂ» Southern Pacific
Uncle Collis will not be compelled to
fast, but we will starve. We, there
fore; propose to see that our employer's
interests are not unjustly assailed by
selfish demagogues and self-opinion
ated cranks."
Some fifteen new members signed the
roll and the session closed.

JUDGE MAGUIRE'S ISSUE.
THE Pinto candidate, in his opening speech of
the campaign last Wednesday night, is reported
as vindicating has views on the single tax, and
as declaring that it is a policy that can be accom
plished only when a majority of the people of the
State ask for it. Judge Maguire probably knows that
his statement is untrue, for he told The Call once, in
a letter, that he is an educated and intelligent man.
The single tax is in issue in this campaign in
amendment No. 2to the State constitution. That
amendment was prepared and urged through the
Legislature by Judge Magnire's single tax junta. It
is a very dishonest piece of business. It proposes
that any county may erect a separate and special
government of its own. Under it the single taxers
propose to accomplish what they call "local option"
in taxation, by putting it in the power of the majority
of the people in any county under such special char
ter, to confiscate land and take it away from private
owners without compensation. The amendment, de
vised by the single tax propaganda, is peculiarly
Maguirean and dishonest. It is intended, as Judge
Maguire well knows, to make possible the confisca
tion of land and the robbery of its owners. If it is
adopted that will be its effect. When Judge Maguire
says that a majority of the people of the State must
vote for robbery of the land-owners he must know
that what he says is untrue. In adopting an amend
ment to the constitution it is only necessary that a
majority of those who vote on that amendment shall
vote for it.
In this lies the extreme and degrading dishonesty
of amendment No. 2. Every single-taxer in the State
knows what it means. He knows that under it land
can be stolen from its owners without a penny of
compensation, and every single-taxer will therefore
support amendment No. 2. They would rather adopt
it than elect Maguire, for as Governor he could only
feed his motley gang at the public crib for four years
and then wrap the drapery of oblivion around him.
But with this amendment adopted the levelers who
make war against the accumulations of thrift and in
dustry can rob the land-holder of his property. Their
motto, often affirmed by Maguire, is "Land owner
ship is robbery." and their consciences do not revolt
at robbing those whom they call robbers.
The ordinary voter cares but little for the consti
tutional amendments printed at the end of the long
ballot. Nothing on the ballot tells what the amend
ment is for. Therefore the single tax amendment if
carried at all will not carry, as Judge M quire knows,
by the vote of a majority of the people, but by that
of a minority, and the distress and the misery which
will follow the robbery of the land-holder will be in
creased by the reflection that it was accomplished by
a minority by methods void of honor and honesty.
TH|E REWARDS OF HEROES.
REPORTS from Great Britain are to the effect
that Parliament will probably reward General
Kitchener for his campaign in the Soudan by
a grant of $125,000, and that the Queen will add to
that the bestowal of a peerage. The fortunate hero
will, therefore, receive a high reward for the service
he has rendered the empire, and in accepting it will
have the satisfaction of knowing that his advance
ment has done no wrong to any of his comrades in
arms. He will not be promoted over any man's head,
will not cause any one to lose his comparative rank
in the army, nor will interfere in any way with the
standing of officers serving in other parts of the em
pire.
This report, coming at the time when we are dis
cussing the vexed problem of promotions and re
wards due to our military and naval heroes, will make
clear the fact that there are some things the British
do better than ourselves. The absurdity of our sys
tem of naval promotion by advancement on the regis
ter has been fully demonstrated by the results of its
application during the war. The victory at Manila
led to the advancement of all the captains in Dewey's
fleet, and consequently when Captain Clark of the
Gregon completed his record-breaking trip around
Ihe Horn he found himself lower in rank than he was
When he left this coast. After the fight off Santiago
be was in turn advanced, and then of course Dewey's
men went down.
Peerages are unknown to our constitution, and are,
moreover, impossible in a republic. Large grants of
money would probably not be popular. Certainly
such a thing would be unprecedented, on the part of
the nation, though the States in early days made such
grants, and were generous in gifts of landed estates.
Still some means should be provided by which heroes
of our army and navy can be rewarded in accordance
with the desires of a grateful people without doing
wrong to some other officer equally brave and faith
ful, but to whom the fortune of war has not granted
an opportunity for distinction.
The same oW item, "Repairs for the City and Coun
ty Hospital." figures in municipal estimates as usual
this year. So it will next year, and possibly the year
after that, and about then the old thing will tumble
down.
BAKERSFIELD TO LOS ANGELES.
BY the filing of articles of incorporation
of the Bakersfield and Los Angeles Rail
way Company the first actual step is
taken toward the accomplishment of the link
which is to connect the Valley road with the
railroad system of the southern part of the State,
and thus procure for San Francisco and California
generally a competing transcontinental road which
will break the Southern Pacific monopoly and liber
ate commerce and industry from the burdens the
monopoly has so long laid upon them.
In accordance with the articles of incorporation the
Bakersfield and Los Angeles railway starting from
Bakersfield, where it will connect with the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin, will connect with the present
constructed line of the Southern California Railway
Company at Los Angeles. This virtually means connec
tion with the Atchison. Topeka and Santa Fe road, so
that the combination constitutes a grand through line
from San Francisco to the East.
The incorporators of the Bakersfield and Los An
geles railway are the men to whose energy and capital
are mainly due the construction of the Valley road.
The rapidity with which they carried the one enter
prise to success is a guarantee to the public that the
new line will be constructed without delay. The vigor
of direction and movement so evident at every step
in the work on the line from Stockton to Bakersfield
will be manifest in the work now undertaken, and in
a time comparatively short we shall see the era of
monopoly transportation closed and the era of com
petition begun.
It is hardly necessary to point out to the people of
California the benefits sure to accrue to all industries
from the work now under way. The whole subject
has been thoroughly studied for years by the business
men of the city and the State and is familiar to all. The
new road will not be burdened with large debts at
heavy interest rates, and will not have to pay divi
dends on vast blocks of watered stock. Conducted
from first to last on business principles by business
men it will need only the income from legitimate
business to prove profitable. As a competitor to the
former monopoly, therefore, it will have great advan
tages and may be confidently counted on to largely
reduce rates of transportation and materially ad
vance the welfare of every section of the State and
of every class of its people.
NOT AMUSING AT ALL.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Third-street
Boodler, pretends to be greatly amused over
our efforts to place the Senatorial candidacy
of Mr. M. H. de Young properly before the public.
Evidently this adroit explorer of railroad treasuries
thinks that in some way our endeavor to compel De
Young to openly submit his claims to the people is
going to help it get another "advertising" contract
out of the Southern Pacific or aid in the election of
the sandlot State or municipal tickets which it is sup
porting. The glee it affects, therefore, has a business
office projection which is far from amusing to us.
The esteemed Boodler is mistaken in assuming that
our opposition to De Young's Senatorial aspirations
is based on anything less exalted than a desire to
force the perennial toga-chaser into the open field.
If the people want De Young we are perfectly willing
they should have him. It might disagree with us, but
we are satisfied that if the State could survive a Sena
torial term by him we would manage to pull through.
But we insist â and this is urged in the interest of
square politics â that the journalistic candidate shall
not fool the people by posing before them as having
no designs upon or aspirations for the Senatorship,
while at the same time maintaining a political bureau
and packing legislative delegations pledged to vote
for him for the office. Is there anything amusing
about this?
We do not deprecate insincerity in others while
practicing it ourselves. In this matter we are plead
ing for an open and fair Senatorial contest. If The
Call had a candidate for the office it would not hesi
tate to name him. Certainly we would never permit
him to crawl up on the blind side of the office and throw
a lariat over it when every back in the State was
turned. If we were the happy promoter of a Sena
torial ambition and hoped to succeed with it the very
first thing we should do would be to place our man
before the people, confident that the mere mention of
his name would enthuse the masses and bring votes to
our standard.
This is the course we demand that De Young
should pursue â and it is the fair course. Gage,
Maguire and the others are compelled to ask the peo
ple for votes. Why should De Young be permitted
to steal the office to which he aspires?
Every Republican in California should oppose se
cret campaigns for the Senatorship. Not only are
they a fraud upon the people, but they imperil party
success and place entire campaigns in jeopardy. Sup
pose, for instance, that De Young had been permitted
to prosecute his Senatorial schemes this year in
silence and had succeeded in pledging a majority of
the Republican legislative nominees in the State to
vote for him. What result would follow if, upon the
verge of the election, it should suddenly be developed
that Republican success meant the selection of De
Young for Senator? Undoubtedly the legislative
ticket would go to smash. But would not the State
and every Republican county and municipal ticket
west of the Rocky Mountains be endangered?
It is for the purpose of averting such a calamity as
this that we have uncovered De Young's Senatorial
schemes. We do not care whether the Boodler credits
us with sincerity or not. We intend that the Republi
cans of this State shall not be fooled into electing De
Young, come what may. If they want him after a
fair contest that is their business. We would do what
we could for the State while he was Senator.
Several Frenchmen were ejected from an Havana
theater for creating a disturbance when the play ex
ploited the Dreyfus case. Naturally their "honor"
was touched, and the thud with which they struck the
pavement outside may have been as efficacious in
"satisfying" as a bluff but more picturesque duel.
Taxpayers would like to know under what head
luxurious quarters for the Superintendent of the
County Hospital come. They can hardly be classed
among repairs, and they must curtail the sums appro
priated for the purpose of caring for the poor and
helpless.
In making inquiries concerning hospital manage
ment Aiger prefers to trust his own powers of obser
vation. The simpler course of applying to New
York's yellowest editor for information does not seem
to have occurred to him.
It is pleasing to learn that trespassing sheepmen are
being chased out of Yosemite, and nobody would re
gret to know that the soldiers had found it necessary
to prod a few of them in order to stimulate their
going.
Possibly some members of the Seventh California
are wondering if they did not begin to kick a little
soon.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1898.
BY an interview with President Jordan of Stan
ford, published this morning, it will be seen
that at least some of the Regents of the Uni
versity of California have thought of offering to him
the position of president. Mr. Jordan is not a candi
date for the office, and distinctly announces that he
will not accept it. His life work is to be devoted to
the upbuilding of Stanford, and he refers to his refusal
to accept the high office of director of the National
Museum at Washington as a proof that no offer of a
position elsewhere can tempt him to swerve from it.
While it is thus made certain that President Jor
dan cannot be induced to transfer his services from
Palo Alto to Berkeley, the very fact that the Regents
have tentatively discussed his selection for the presi
dency of the State University is gratifying. It is an
unmistakable evidence that they are on the right
track and are seeking the right kind of man for the
place. It is in fact a man of President Jordan's stamp
and characteristics that is needed at Berkeley, and if
such a man can be obtained the whole educational
work of the State will be benefited.
In his interview President Jordan names a goodly
list of distinguished men who might be induced to
accept the position. The office is certainly one that
must be attractive to all who are interested in the
higher departments of educational work. No univer
sity in the nation has at this time more brilliant pros
pects before it than that of California, and no other
affords an equal field for the labors of a man of
original force and scholarly aspirations. It ought to
be possible, therefore, for the Regents to obtain the
services of a man of the highest order of intellect and
executive ability, and now that it is clear they are
seeking for such a man the outlook of the university
is brighter than ever.
THE PRESS AND THE DREYFUS CASE.
ACCORDING to dispatches from London
Major Esterhazy, one of the notorieties of the
Dreyfus affair, is living in hiding in that city,
and has announced to his friends that he will soon
make a full statement of all that he knows concerning
the case. He is further reported as asserting that all
he did in any part of the affair from beginning to end
was done under orders from his superior officers, and
that when he makes his confession he will tell the
whole truth and spare none.
These statements will be received with compara
tively little doubt by the public, because they are in
line with what has long been suspected by all who
have studied the case. Of course a man with the rec
ord of Esterhazy will never be fully credited even
when he tells the truth, for he who confesses to such
lies and forgeries as, since the Henry suicide, are
known to have been used against Dreyfus, will be
open to the suspicion of lying even when he makes a
confession.
Whether Esterhazy confesses or not, however, it
is now fairly certain that a rehearing, and this time a
public one, will be given to the prisoner. That much
of a victory has been already accomplished for jus
tice, and the prospect is that in the end the innocent
will be acquitted and the guilty punished.
For this good result of a great scandal and gross
wrong the cause of justice is indebted to the press.
It will be a triumph for trial in newspapers over trial
in the courts. From the highest military tribunal of
a mighty military nation, an appeal was taken to the
press of France and the world. The hearing of that
appeal has gone on for years. The civil courts came
to the assistance of the military authorities and en
deavored to reduce to silence Zola, the most eloquent
of the advocates of the condemned man among the
writers for the press, but in that instance, as in the
one of Dreyfus himself, an appeal from the court was
carried to the people.
The end is now approaching. The right of the press
to criticize the decisions of courts has once more vin
dicated itself. Once more it is proved that the su
preme tribunal of modern times is to be found at the
bar of public opinion. In all nations as in this coun
try it is true that one cannot fool all the people all
the time. Where freedom is given for an appeal to
the judgments of the great mass of citizens justice
soonenor later establishes her cause.
CALIFORNIAN bankers, joining hands with
those of other States, have adopted resolutions
declaring that the gold standard is the only
proper and sole possible standard of value, and
urging the importance of the passage of a currency
reform bill at the coming session of Congress.
Such resolutions were not unexpected. As a mat
ter of fact the bankers of all parts of the Union have
for years been endeavoring to bring about some re
form in the tangled maze of our monetary legislation.
They have worked faithfully at the task of popular
education on financial problems, and have done far
more than our statesmen to make it possible to es
tablish in this country a safe and rational currency
system in place of the disordered lack of system that
obtains now.
The present demand for monetary reform fortu
nately coincides with conditions that augur well for
good results from any well directed undertaking in
that direction. The national treasury is overflowing,
the banks are carrying abundant supplies of money
for all purposes of trade and industry, interest rates
are low, and the commerce of the country is sound
and flourishing. Everything dependent upon finance
is therefore in a condition of equilibrium sufficiently
stable to meet such changes as may be made in the
monetary system without suffering in any respect
even temporarily.
It is gratifying that a great majority of the busi
ness classes of the people are not only united in
demanding a speedy reform of the existing evils in
our monetary laws, but are virtually agreed as to the
best means of effecting that reform. This harmony
of views will go far toward making the adoption of
reform possible at the coming session of Congress,
and we may therefore reasonably hope to see the
long disputed issue settled before next March.
It seems a pity that the soldiers about to sail for
Manila could not have had assurance of it weeks ago.
This would have saved much discontent, and home
sick volunteers spoiling for a fight would have re
frained from working off their surplus energy in a
manner annoying to the police.
Esterhazy says he will confess everything. As this
must include a declaration that he is a perjurer he
should have some corroborative evidence handy.
Still, when Esterhazy proclaims himself a scoundrel
to believe him will be comparatively easy.
Judged from a distance, the best course for France
is to get' off the trail, if it happen to be the trail that
man Kitchener happens to have chosen for his own
use.
Americans would like to see affairs at Havana reach
that stage at which Blanco shall have been eliminated.
Germany seems anxious to adopt a Mike de Young
style of campaign at the Philippines.
ON THE RIGHT TRACK-
FOR CURRENCY REFORM.
A LESSON FOR CONGRESS-
When Congress convenes it will reveiw the lesson taught us by the
war and It will find that one of the most important issues before it is the
question of upbuilding our merchant marine, first, because in our expected
commercial expansion the item of transportation is going to be of most
pressing importance, and second, because we have been found wofully de
ficient, when the crisis came, in means to transport troops, supplies and
fuel, necessitating our purchasing over $7,000,000 worth of foreign tonnage
In two months to enable us to keep our navy at sea and move our troops to
the assistance of the navy. All this had been predicted time and again
by those who saw the importance of promoting shipbuilding, but Congress
satisfied Its own ideas in this respect by giving us laws totally unfitted to
help the industry.
Besides a navy we require a fleet of colliers and supply ships, which
are to a fleet what a pack train is to an army; and as our navy grows
more transports will be required. It is here where the Government would
derive its first benefit from substantially subsidizing vessels that In time
of peace can be used in ordinary vocations, and in time of war as auxiliary
naval vessels.
Our ocean merchant tonnage was so small in quantity that when called
upon for Government service in many cases trade connections were com
pletely broken off and to compensate for the disruption in trade the owners
of such tonnage were obliged to ask what appeared to be excessive rates
of charter, whereas h*d American tonnage been more plentiful it would
have been secured at much less figures.
Had the $7,000,000 or more that the Government paid for foreign vessels
been paid in subsidies during the past few years the Government would not
have been obliged to buy a single vessel from foreign sources and over
$10,000,000 would have been spent in American shipyards in building vessels to
partake of that subsidy. In addition to this these American-built vessels
would have earned from freight and passengers a gross amount of not less
than $5,600,000 per annum, 80 per cent of which would have passed Into
the pockets of American citizens. As it turns out the $7,000,000 Is a loss to
the Government; the $10,000,000 is a loss to the shipyard and its kindred
trades, and the $5,600,000 per annum is a loss to the shipowner and every
one else, because one of the most peculiar features In connection with a
Bailing vecsel or steamship is that Its career Is interwoven directly with
every Industry in the country.
Surely our eyes are open now and we are going to stop paying other
countries to carry our goods to market, and when this country legislates
liberally to the end that we may become a great sea power, commercially,
we will prove the old adage: "Peace hath her victories no less renowned
than war." FREDERICK S. SAMUELS.

S5OÂ«Â»5O00Â»OÂ« master of trans
portation of the Southern Pacific of Ken
tucky, Is noted for his polish, his wit and
delayed trains. .-â¢ A - few Â£ days ago one of
the officers of the company wrote to Rich-
ardson for information regarding the dis
position of a certain car. The letter was
full of waillngs, and the writer concluded
his note of warning by saying that iho
car would bÂ© exposed to the withering
rays of a pitiless sun if it were run over
the Sunset route, and unless the master
of transportation showed some signs of
pity there would be a blistered abomina
tion instead of a car. The face of the
tragedian â for so Mr. Richardson appears
to be, since the order of the Knights of
TieÃ and Wheels directed him to shave
his handsome mustache â wreathed with
smiles when he read the letter. The fol
lowing was dictated to his stenographer:
Dear Sir: I am sorry that you think that I
have not the milk of human kindness within
my breast, but If you are so solicitous about
the welfare of that car you might give It a
parasol for protection. I assure you, if you
had notified me sooner, I would have had two
rows of trees planted along the Sunset line to
shelter the dear, sweet thing. Yours very
truly, G. M. RICHARDSON.

IN FAIR NATAL.
Through the long tamboukie grass we rode
at set of sun â
Round the hill, across the spruit, we fol
lowed, one by oneâ
And the rattle. lowing, went before and,
everwhere they trod,
Crushed the perfume from the grass; It was
breast high from the sod.
In the swamp, away below ua, flamed and
blazed the pokers red
And the many spiked orchid proudly raised
her soented head.
The grassbells rang a warning In their
pink and purple chime.
The reeds bent low to hear It, and swung the
birds' nests to the rhyme.
The spruit came gurgling down the kloof be
tween the arums gay,
Where the ferns grow In the crannies of the
rocks pink and gray.
From out Its dull dark foliage the chestnut
bloom was fair,
The moss, like graybeards hanging, on its
stem straight and bare.
The setting sun was gilding all the Berg with
fiery light.
The mist rose in the valley, dim and white.
We passed the big plantation where the wattle
flowers smelt sweet.
The red dust was rising from the red road
'neath our feet.
We were near the kraal at last, and we
coo-ed, long and low-
Cracked our whips, and, as the sun sank, the
breeze began to blow â
Ihe dogs barked as the cattle through the open
gateway passed,
The rails were shut behind themâ oar work
was done at last.

A United States patent runs for seven

BITUMEN ON MARKET STREETâ H.
S., City. The reason that bitumen has
not been laid in front of the property
of Mayor Phelan on Market street, be
tween Grant avenue and Stockton streets,
is because the Mayor has been given per
mission to place a newly invented wood
en pavement in front of his premises.
POINTS FOR DEBATERSâ A. A., City.
This department has on a number of oc
casions announced that It does not fur
nish points or ideas for debaters who
may wish to take the affirmative or the
negative side of a question. The purpose
of a debate is to bring out the individual
ideas of the debater, and if he uses those
furnished by another they lose their value
so far as he is concerned.
LETTERâ Subscriber, City. . "General
delivery" is a term that is affixed upon
a letter when the writer does not know
the address of the party addressed or
desires that the party for whom it is
intended shall call for it at the general
delivery department of the postoffice.
There is no Latin term used in place of
the words quoted, but there are French
words which are understood the world
over, and these are "poste restante."
CLIMATE OF SAMOAâ Mrs. N., City.
; The climate of Samoa is tropical, it is
i fairly good and ranges from 80 to 93 de

1 tempered by the .trade winds. Strangers
: who wish to live in that country should
exercise the same care that, they would
in any tropical clime, and if they will
i follow the rules that are laid down by
I the local physicians, there will not be
much fear that the climate will be bard
on them.
INCIPIENT BALDNESSâ C., Camp
Merriam, City. There are any number of
"infallible" remedies to be used in case
j of incipient baldness and to prevent the
hair from falling out. The commonest
and simplest is a mixture of equal parts
of tincture of cantharldes and olive or
almond oil simply agitated together, ana
shaken before use. Another liquid is
i made by substituting proof spirit or good
I rum for the oil. and adding from one to
] one and a half drams of glycerine to
I each ounce of the mixture. This prepara
| tion, it is said, imparts moisture and
i gloss to the hair and is genial in its ac
tion on the scalp. These are given for
what they are worth, but this department
does not know anything of their worth.
THE FOURTH FINGER-Mac, Ala
meda, Cal. Many years ago, in fact, many
centuries, there was a belief among the
Egyptians that there was in the fourth
finger of the left hand a small artery that
proceeded directly to the heart and that
for that reason it was the proper finger on
which to place the Wfddlng ring. In the
"Attick Mghts" appears the following in
regard to that finger: "The motion of this
artery may be felt by touching this finger
to the pulse, it being an index in case of
sickness, or where persons are weary or
overlabored, always informing when the
heart is overburdened or offended. â¢ â¢
This finger rarely hath gout on account of
the sympathy and neighborhood it hath
with the heart. It is the first finger that a
new born babe is able to move, and the
last of which a dying man loseth control.
It is also the one last to swell when the
vital heat is abating in one that is passing
over."
MEAN LEVEL OF OCEANSâ C. M. M.,
Veterans' Home, Cal. There is no differ
ence in the mean level of the Atlantic
and the Pacific oceans. The idea that the
one was higher than the other has no
doubt arisen from a statement that was
published in the papers some years ago
to the effect that the ocean level was
higher at Colon on the Atlantic side of
the proposed Panama canal than it was
at Panama on tne Pacific sute. That
statement was not correct, and must have
been the result of insufficient observa
tions; or perhaps the party who made the
statement on which the article was based
was misunderstood by the writer, and
the one who made the statement re
ferred to the levels of high or low water.
There is very little range of tlo~ at Colon
ânot more than eighteon or twenty
inches. At Panama the range of spring
tide is from eighteen to twenty-two feet
and of neap tide from six to ten feet

THE BUSH STREET THEATER-W
R. M., Los Angeles, Cal. "What was the
last performance at the Bush Street
Theater, San Francisco, Cal?" is a ques
tion that cannot be satisfactorily an
swered without a precise knowledge of
under what management the questioner
would like to know. The last perform
ance in "The Bush Street Theater" this
department however, will announce was
on the night of January 6, 1889. with
1 *? G / an d European Novelties. On
the 26th of that month it reopened as
iJr j. ev Â£m. Bush 1 Street Theater," with
the Lydia Thompson Company, and closed
as such September 5, ISSI, with "The
Burglar. It was then continued as "The
Bush Street Theater" for a time, and
then aÂ« "The New. Bush Street Theater"
until March 25, 1894, when the last p<&
formance was again given, thâ¬ play try
ing "The Spider and the Fly." That mny
properly be designated as the. last per
formance at the Bush as a regular the
ater. In June, 1894, Percy Hurttirg
brought out "Faust" tor one week fro"4j
the 3d to the 10th; in October, thÂ« 7th and
the 24th, Martinez brought out "Che Bar
ber of Seville," and on December .'2 Hoyte
and Lee reopened the theater Tith Lil
lian Beddard in "The White Toman.'
and the place closed January 2, 1195, witU
"The Yellow Mask." After that tie placa
was opened occasionally for a on< or tw<j
nights* performance, but this deptxtment
has not the time to follow the ales oi
the papers day by day for nearly fottr
years to discover "the last performance
prior to the recent reopening of the plaag
as a comedy theater.
CLEANING A RUGâ A. 8.. Placervillft,
Cal. If you have a "fine Angora goat
rug" that needs cleaning or washing, the
most economical and safest way to >lo it
is to turn it over to a professional cleener,
as an amateur, to say nothing of the
labor and trouble, would be likely to
spoil and render it unfit for future use-
The following is said to be the met V.on
of washing such a rug: "Make a strong
lather with hot water and let it stana
until cold, wash the skin in it carefully
squeezing out all the dirt from the wocÂ£
wash it in cold water until all the Boa!
is taken out. Then dissolve a pound each
of Bait and alum in two gallons of hot
water Put the skin in a tub with suffi
cient of this water to cover it. Let it
remain for several hours, then hang it
over a pole to drain. When well drained,
stretch it carefully on a board to dry,
and stretch several times while drying.
Before it is quite dry, sprinkle on tn<s
side on which there is no wool one ounce
each of pulverized alum and saltpeter,
rubbing it in well. Try If the wool be
firm, if not, let it remain a day or two,
then rub again with alum. Fold the flesh
side together and hang in fne shade for
two or three days, turning over each
day until quite dry. Then rub the flesh
side with pumice stone." It takes experi
ence to manipulate a skin in the manner
described.
LONG DISTANCE FIGHTINQ.
"Unless they have had experience," re
marked an army officer, "people are very
liable to have a very imperfect idea as to
distances in army and field operations,
and as a result they get things consider
ably mixed. When they read that armies
are engaging with each other at 2000 yards
between them, they may think that they
can see each other, but the reality is far
different. At that distance, to the naked
eye, a man or a horse doos nut ionlc.ju>t
larger than a speck. It Is impossible to
distinguish at that distance between a
man and a horse, and at 800 yards less,
12iiO jards. especially where there is any
dust, it requires the best kind of eyes t<>
tell infantry from cavalry- At 900 -yards
the movements become clearer, though it
is not until they get within 750 yards of
each other that the heads of the columns
can be made out with anything like cer
tainty.
"Infantry can be seen In the sunlight
much easier than cavalry or artillery. JfÂ°r
the reason that less dust is raised. Be
sides that, infantry can be distinguished
by the glitter of their muskets. At 2000
yards, however, everything is unsatisfac
tory, even with the aid of field glasses,
for a marching column in dry weather
raises a great deal of dust. At our recent
engagements at Santiago, the heavy Tains-,
of course, kept down the dust, but the
falling rain shut out from view the op
posing forces as effectually as would the
dust. Even a giass would not penetrate
"There is no doubt that the rifles of tha
present day do service at a much greater
distance than those formerly used, but no
general is going to waste ammunition at
a greater distance than his men can see
to properly use it. Any first-class arm
will shoot and do good service at a great
er distance than men can clearly see: but
the chances are that no battles will be
fought at such distances. The distaqce
between the White House and the Capf
tol is about 1900 yards, and it would not
be practicable to fight a battle at that
distance If it could be avoided." â Wash

TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY.
Interminable distances of monotonous
Asiatic geography will before long be
speedily traversed in comparative com
fort, if undertaken in the typical corridor
car of the first class, commonly met with
on the Russian railways, and thereafter
in the boats on the river route to Vladivo
stok. What a contrast such a trajet will
be to those who have laboriously covered
the same ground under pre-existing:'condi
tions! Then, the seemingly endless jour
ney was undertaken with whatever un
comfortable primitive vehicle might be
found at hand, appropriate either to sum
mer mud or A. cue winter snow. But soon
the comfortable travel of the sleeping'
cars, with leisurely waits at meal sta
tions, and, later, the easy-going advance
of the river vessels, with full personal se
curity and polite attendance, may safely
be reckoned upon, thus acentuating the
extraordinary triumphs over obstructive
physical difficulties which may be accom
plished by persistent and intelligently di
rected human effort.
According to an official Russian report,
some of the goods bound from China or
Siberia to Russia proper were formerly a
year on the road. The fur-clad, snow
bound journey across the stpppes. with Its
frightful monotony, relieved only by oc
casional stops for tea and for change of
horses at the posting houses, is a familiar
picture in literature. It is another strik
ing contrast that perhaps in the coming
summer the new rail and river route may
be open to any robust traveler who,
equipped with home passport and with a
special permit from the St. Petersburg
authorities, is prepared to meet rough
wagofl travel over a few hundred milea
of uncompleted railroad between Lake
Baikal and the Shilka River. Whatever
he may encounter, this much is certain,
that if he is an American and properly
vouched for, he will find extreme and un
failing sympathy and civility from all thp
Russiansâ officials and othersâ as those or
his countrymen who have met these gen
tlemen will gladly testify.â The Forum.

Stories of Friction Circulated De
clared by Aguinaldo to Be
Malicious Slanders.
In a Cabled Manifesto the Insurgent Leader
Alludes to the Confidence t^e Filipinos
Have in Americans.
NEW YORK, Sept 19.â The following dispatch has been received
at the office here of the Associated Press:
"MANILA, P. L, Sept 19.â The Filipino Government desires to
inform the American Government and people that the many rumors
circulated regarding the strained relations between the Filipino and
American forces are base, malicious slanders of the enemy to both
parties, are -without any truth and are circulated for the purpose of
prejudicing the appeal of the Filipinos for their release from the
oppression and cruelty of Spain.
"The relations of our people and yours have been and will con
tinue to be of the most friendly nature, and we have withdrawn
our forces from the suburbs of Manila as an additional evidence of
our confidence In the great American republic AGUINALDO."

ALARM OVER CONDITION
OF SPANISH PRISONERS
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, Sept. 19.â The condition of
the Spanish prisoners is beginning to
excite anxiety among military officers
here. Eleven thousand of these pris
oners are quartered In churches and
other buildings within the narrow con
fines of the walled city, where most of
the Spanish live, where the American
garrison is necessarily quartered, and
where General Otis has located the
army headquarters.
Members of the sanitary corps are
kept constantly at work clearing out
filth that accumulates. the Span
lards not having: a knowledge of
chc iÂ«.we ot sanitation. The result 1b a
condition threatening a general out
break of some zymotic disease at any
moment. Typhoid fever is already in
creasing at an alarming rate.
The authorities feel It is absolutely
essential to the health of the city to get
the Spanish prisoners out of Manila at
the earliest possible date. Similar con
ditions are reported from Cavite, where
the Spanish in the hands of the rebels
are suffering for a lack of the necessa
ries of life.
To make matters worsÂ«, the sailing of
the hospital ship Rio has been repeat
edly delayed. It is now stated that the
vessel will sail on Thursday. Probably
by that time she will have a consider
able accession to her invalid passenger
list.
SENDING WARSHIPS
TO THE ISLANDS
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 19.â The offi
cials at the State and War departments
â¢welcomed the announcement to the
American people through the Associ
ated Press of the falsity of the stories
describing the friction between the
Filipinos and American forces In Lu
zon. While the officers do not care to
discuss the matter for publication it
was evident that the main source of
their satisfaction was the internal evi
dence contained in the document that
Aguinaldo had profited by the warnings
of the American commanders and had
gracefully receded from the arrogant
attitude assumed by him just before
General Merritt left Manila for Paris.
While there is little in the official rec
ords that tends to contradict what the
insurgent chief says, still it must be
recalled that both General Merritt and
Admiral Dewey, In cable messages to
Washington, have pointed out the
threatening complications arising from
the attitude of the insurgents.
The Navy Department is rushing

GREAT GROWTH IN THE
ORDER OF ODD FELLOWS
BOSTON, Sept. 19.â An official welcome
to the Sovereign Grand Lodge of the In
dependent order of Odd Fellows was
given in the Y. M. C. A. Hall to-day.
The members of the Sovereign Grand
Lodgf, 200 In number, and the ladies rep
resenting the Order of Rebekah, were es
corted to the hall by committees.
The members of the Sovereign Grand
Lodge after the. welcoming exercises
inarched to Copley Hall, where their se
cret deliberations began. Following the
reading of reports a great deal of busi
ness was rushed in and referred to com
mittees.
Grand Sire Carlton reported that a re
quest had been received from Brother
Hartley, who Is with the United States
army in Manila, for permission to estab
lish the order in the Philippines. Tho
grand sire rrcommendf d that action to
this end be taken by the Sovereign Grand
Lodge at this Hesslon. He also recom
mended legislation by which members of
the ord'-r serving in the army may be
permitted military lodges or associations,
limited to consultlve, or fraternal ses
sions, strictly prohibiting initiations or
conferring degrees. He reported the or
df-r in foreign countries as prowing and
prosperous. A request has been received
for the establishment of the order in the
Argentine Republic from W. D. Mayer,
United States Consul at Buer.os Ayres.
Grand Secretary J. Frank Grant pre
sented a voluminous report. Grand Treas

Committees wore then appointed. The
session adjourned until to-morrow morn-
Ing when the election of officers will be
the important business.
The Odd Fellows to-day sent a message
calculations, they should arrive at
their destination by the end of Janu
ary. There Is little effort made now to
conceal the fact that the department
will have the ships met at Honolulu by
a dispatch boat with orders to turn
their prows westward to Manila.
Battleships of this character are not
needed to keep the Filipino Insurgents
In order and their assembling at Ma
nila, in conjunction with the dispatch
of heavy reinforcements of troops for
the American land forces, cannot but
be regarded as significant. In well-in
formed circles here it is said that the
real purpose of the President In mak
ing these preparations is to insure the
Peace Commissioners agralnst any in
terference In their work of disposing
of the future of the Philippines, ac
cording to their best judgment. Not
having disclosed his plans respecting
the islands outside of Luzon, the seat
of the capital of the group, the Presi
dent still reserves for the American
Peace Commissioners the right to dis
pose of the remainder of the Islands as
they may deem best.
A long line of curious Incidents, to
which one of the great European
powers has been a party, has beyond
question done much to cause a feeling
of uneasiness on the part of the ad
ministration, as tending to show a pur
pose to interfere in our free action In
the Philippines, and this has been only
Bllghtly diminished by apparently
frank disclaimers of an ulterior pur
pose, because the Incidents continue
quietly and In a manner calculated to
avoid attracting attention. Such, for
instance, is the gathering of naval ves
sels to the south of the Philippine
group, the only explanation of which,
coming from native sources, it is true,
but still bearing marks of genuineness.
Is a purpose of acquiring either by seiz
ure or by some secret pact with the
Spanish Government the Important
island of Palawan.
This particular Island forms one side
of the gateway through which must
pass all of the extensive commerce that
floats between Australia, Micronesia
and Southern China. The passage Is
narrow, and if the islands of the Phil
ippine group are to be retained, outside
of Luzon, this island of Palawan must
be kept, forming one side of the gate
way. It Is gathered that It is the pur
pose, therefore, to prevent the aliena
tion by Spain of any of the Philippine
group, and that these preparations,
naval as well as military, are but steps
toward the execution of his purpose
With the addition to his fleet of two
battleships Admiral Dewey will have a
force only second to that of Great Brit

General Otis will have a more numer

AN ATTEMPT TO
POISON AGUINALDO
MANILA, P. 1., Sept. 19.â The Repub
llca Filiplna asserts that an attempt
was made to poison Aguinaldo on Fri
day night. A steward, it is alleged, saw
a Spanish prisoner who had been al
lowed his freedom make a movement
which appeared like tampering with a
bowl of soup Intended for Aguinaldo,
whereupon the steward tasted a spoon
ful of the soup and fell dead. Eleven
Franciscan friars are alleged to have
been engaged in the conspiracy.
The populace, It is further said, at
tempted to lynch all the Spanish pris
oners,' but Aguinaldo intervened. At
Saturday's session of the national as
sembly it appears Aguinaldo was ab
sent, but his representative related tfip
story of the outrage to the members"
who unanimously adopted the chair
man's proposal that they all go to
Aguinaldo's house, express sympathy
with him and congratulate him upon
his escape. During the evening a spe
cial thanksgiving service was held in
the church at Malolos.
Soup intended for Aguinaldo is niv
subjected, it is stated, to a chemical

insurgent leader, and the Spanish prls- I
eners are kept closely confined.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1898.
PASTORS ASSIGNED
TO NEW PLACES
Concluding Day of the
Conference.
APPOINTMENTS ANNOUNCED
BUSINESS CROWDED INTO THE
CLOSING HOURS.
Pacific Grove Selected by the Method
ist Delegates as the Site of the
Next Annual Gather
ing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal.. Sept. 19.-This
was the busiest day of the entire confer
ence week. What with three sessions of
the conference, the closing business of the
nearly two-score conference committees
and the preparations of all the members
for departure there was not a moment
from dawn till midnight that remained
unoccupied. Naturally, the busiest of all
these busy men was the presiding Bishop,
for upon his shoulders rested the burden
of the responsibility of settling the busi
ness affairs of this important body, of
making provision for the temporal and
Bplritual welfare of nearly 300 men and
their families. That peculiar usage of the
Methodist church by which each minister
surrendered all right of choice in regard
to his home and field of labor, placing the
decision solely In the hands of the Bishop,
makes it necessary for the church to have
great care in its choice of men to bear so
great a resposlbllity, but Bishop Hurst,
in whose hands are the affairs of,the Cali
fornia Conference, is fully equal, both in
natural ability and caution, to the task ha
is performing. The members of this con
ference feel perfectly satisfied with the
manner in which he has ordered their
affairs.
The clerk of the weather sent a magnifi
cent day, and sunshine without and
within, judging from the countenances of
the members, prevailed when Bishop John
F. Hurst called the first session to order
at 9 a. m. The first business of the morn
ing was the report of the committee of
Sabbath observance, made by Chairman
11. C. Briggs, D.D., and that of the com
mittee on missions, read by W. P. Grant.
Both reports were adopted.
After a motion of Dr. H. B. Heacock
that the committee on ministerial quali
fications be divided into three sections of
five members, one section to go out and j
a new one to be elected each year, was t
carried, Rev. Dr. A. J. Palmer of New j
York addressed the conference on the sub- j
ject of church missionary debt, and the j
workings of the organization by which
the money belonging to the Methodist
Missionary Society are disbursed in chan
nels along which it is most needed for !
civilizing and christianizing the unenlight
ened peoples of the earth.
The report of the special committee ap
pointed to consider a change in the ratio
of the episcopal fund of this episcopacy
was presented and after considerable dis
cussion was adopted as follows: That
the apportionment of the episcopal fund
in each charge be fixed at 10 cents per
member, and that it be made a pro-rata j
claim with that of the pastor and presid
ing elder. The shortage of $678 IS In last |
year's fund has made the increase nece*- j
sary and also has made necessary the
further action of the conference that this
assessment be strictly enforced hereafter
in order that the fund may not fall short
in the coming- year.
Resolutions ol courtesy were read and
adopted, after which committee reports :
were heard. The report of the committee
on periodicals was presented by Rev. J. H.
Wythe Jr. and spoken to strongly by Rev.
Dr. W. S. Mathews, editor of the Califor
nia Christian Advocate; Bishop .Hurst, the
present conference president, and Dr.
George P. Mains of New York, the latter
of whom talked of the publishing Interests
of the M. E. Church. Dr. Mains said that
Methodism was engaged in the colossal
partnership of enterprises to accomplish
the sublime aim of conquering the world
for Christ. This was Dr. Main's first ap
pearance before the California Conference.
Dr. Mains then presented to the confer
ence a check for $1095, its share of the div
idend recently declared by the Methodist
Book Concern of the United States.
The discussion which all supposed
would be precipitated by the question
which Bishop Hurst then asked: "Where
will you hold your next conference?" was
obviated by his saying when on motion of
Dr. H. B. Heacock Pacific Grove was pro
posed:
"I'd like to be able to vote for Pacific
Grove myself."
The motion was carried with no jopposl
tion. J. D, Hammond addressed the con
ference for himst-lf and J. N. Beard, both
of whom were absent when the vote on
ministerial representation in the general
conference was taken, asking that their
votes in the affirmative be recorded. The
request was granted.
A notable resolution was presented Dr.
Kummer. The preamble stated that as
Bishop William Taylor, who was a pio
neer Methodist minister of California,
having begun as a street preacher in the
village of San Francisco and who con
tinued unbroken missionary labors for fif
ty-five years and passed a phenomenally
useful life in Christian influence upon all
continents and almost all islands of the
sea. had come to California to rest and
recuperate, the committee proposed that
the conference adopt a resolution of wel
come, expressing the profoundest venera
tion for this honored man of God. The
resolution was adopted by a unanimous
rifing vote, after which the Bishop gave
an eulogy upon his venerable co-laborer.
The report of the committee on educa
tion contained the most important action
of the day In the conference. The com
mittee proposed to take care of the large
debt now resting on the property of the
University of the Pacific by unifying the
indebtedness and runding it by iÃsuing
$60,000 worth of ten-year gold-bearing
bonds at 5 per cent, the bonds to be se
cured by trust deeds to the Columbian
Banking Company of San Francisco. The
bonds are to be floated by popular sub
scription and other means ln\'okf>d by the
laity of California. This action was unan
imously adopted by the conference.
Several gifts to the University of the
â Pacific were reported. Dr. Farrar of
}'->taluma gave $2240; Mrs. Woodward of
S;i .itopa, twelve acres of land valued at
$.Â°.S&u; Joseph Shopard of Point Arena,
320 acres of timber land valued at $2000;
Dr. J. E. Stubbs. president of the Univer
sity of Nevada, $100.
Trustees of the University of tho Pa
cific were elected as folllows: Rev. Drs.
E. R. Dille, H. B. Heacock, F. F. Jewell,

son, Messrs, L. B. Hanson, T. B. Hutch
lnson, S. E. Holden. I;. J. Norton, J. A.
Percy, I. J. Truman, Rolla V. Watt.
Referred cases wore taken up by the
committee on conference relations. The
relations of J. D. Henderson and W. C.
Sawyer were changed to supernumerary,
and those of T. R. Hartley to effective.
A veritable "battle of giants" occurred
in regard to a resolution relating to
church extension, introduced by Dr. A. T.
Needham. It provided that the Church
Extension Society be asked for a dona
tion and loan to help the Eighth Avenue
Church in Oukland to meet its heavy in
debtedness. The resolution was finally
adopted.

ADVANCE NAVAL
EXPEDITION IS
WELL EQUIPPED.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19.â The advance guard of the naval ex
pedition for Honolulu and eventually for Manila started yesterday
when the Abarenda sailed from Fortress Monroe via Brazil. The
Abarenda is a collier, one of four which are to keep the big battle
ships Oregon and lowa supplied with coal on their long voyage
around South America. The plan is to have two of the colliers pre
cede the battle-ships and two to go along with them.
In addition to these escorting craft Acting Secretary Allen to-day
ordered that the Celtic and Iris be added to the expedition. The
Celtic is a refrigerator and supply ship and the Iris is a distilling
ship. Theircapacity is enormous, and Mr. Allen said that no such per
fectly equipped naval expedition ever sailed under any flag. With their
large reserve supply of coal, with an abundance of refrigerated
fresh meats and vegetables, with appliances and plant for making
repairs to machinery, and finally, with an abundance of fresh water,
the squadron will be able to keep the seas for an indefinite period
of time.

MAKING A STRONG
FIGHT FOR LIFE
Frank Darby on Trial, Charged "With
the Brutal Murder of
Louis Boldini.
FRESNO. Cal., Sept. 19.-The trial of
Frank Darby, charged with killing Louis
Boldini, was commenced here to-day. The
affair occasions considerable interest, ow
ing to the prominence of young Darby.
Last June the young man went to
White's Bridge to kill doves. He did lit
tle hunting. Instead he remained all the
afternoon in a saloon situated near the
bridge and late in the afternoon Louis
Boldini, with a party in which was Lena
Castro, reached the place and went into
camp. Darby, by this time intoxicated,
chased the woman until she hid under
the bridge. About that time Boldini, who
had left the camp, returned and was shot
down as he attempted to cross the bridge.
He fell right above the Castro woman,
and his blood flowed through the cracks
in the bridge to her feet as she crouched
in hiding. No one saw Darby fire the shot,
but the evidence against him is strong.
He is making a strong fight for his life,
being represented by four attorneysâ
Lewis H. Smith. R. E. Rhodes, A. C.
Williams and Frank Short. He has had a
number of private detectives working up
his case for him.

CLINGING TO THE CAPITAL
DONS LOTH TO GIVE UP A GOOD

They Also Ask That Their 115,000
Soldiers Be Permitted to De
part With Their Flags
Flying.
Special cable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
dcn Bennett.
HAVANA, Sept. 19.â The first work
of the American Commission to-mor
row will be to prepare a second series
of propositions answering the Spanish
reply to the first series sent a week
ago to-day.
Secretary Girauta of the Spanish
Commission was about to take a pon
derous document to the Resolute when
Major Glous called, and the response
was delivered to him. It somewhat dis
pleased the American Commissioners,
especially the date set for the comple
tion of evacuation, February 28, 1899.
It has been suggested that the evacua
tion should begin with Gibara, Nuevi
tas, Cienfuegos and Havana in the or
der named, which is not in consonance
with the American terms of experi
menting with a small port before be
ginning at the capital. This was re
garded as a desire on the part of the
Spaniards, according to the Americans'
Judgment, to cling to the main source
of revenue as long as possible.
The Spanish reply also ask* that the
soldiers be allowed to depart fully
equipped with flags flying. The Ameri
cans were surprised at the number of
troops being placed at so large a figure
as 115,000, having expected fewer.
There has been no Spanish response
yet to the second demand of the Ameri
can Commission in regard to the Co
mal, upon which the whfle question of
landing supplies depends. The big
Spanish mail steamer Alphonso XIII
leaves to-morrow for Spain. One of her
passengers will be Rear Admiral Pas
tor Landero, Captain of the Port,
originally appointed one of the Spanish
Commissioners. Admiral Landero's
delicate health was the cause of his
withdrawal from the commission.
TERRIBLE STORIES OF
ANARCHY IN CUBA
LONDON, Sept. 19.â The Havana
correspondent of the Times cables ter
rible stories of anarchy in Cuba and
says the American Government is ap
parently attempting to suppress the
truth. As an instance, he gives the
following story, which he declares
was suppressed by the censor at Key
West :
A band of Insurgents attacked re
cently the Providencia Cigar Factory,
near Guines, one of the richest in Cuba,
The guerrilla force which the proprietor
maintained to defend his property un
til the arrival of the Spanish troops,
was obliged to surrender, because the
Spanish troops now do nothing to
suppress lawlessness. The insurgents
invaded the inclosure, where they
found a lot of reconcentrados. They
stripped the women naked, and plac
ing them in line, fired from behind
them at the guerrillas, thus making it
impossible for the defenders of the fac
tory to return the fire.
The correspondent declares that the
most irremediable effect of the pro
longed war in the island is the almost
total destruction of the white popula
tion, which has left Cuba almost as
black as Hayti.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â The stock market
started off this morning: as "though it had
shaken off the incubus of the recent tight
money scare, but the marked weakness of
sugar, which made up two-fifths of the total
transactions, unsettled the tone early and car
ried prices below Saturday's level. The decline
was quite steady and general for the remainder
of the day. Evidently last week's sharp recov
ery was the result of extensive covering of
short lines by speculators and the general spec
ulative public is now prepared to pause and
t;.ke breath to study how far the last oscilla
tion of the market has' brought prices to the
true level of values. It is more and more evi
dent that the late apprehension over a squeeze
la money was largely fictitious. How far the
efforts to manipulate the money rate were In
fluenced by the natural desire of money lenders
to obtain better rates and how far by a pur
pose to effect a reaction in the stock market
cannot be definitely ascertained, but it might
be attained that very powerful financial in
terests who have a dominating woice in the
control of vast surplus capital had! taken their
prontÃ in stocks and were willing to see a re
action. It is obvious, however, that their mo
tive In taking profits must have been a con
viction th.it prices were equal to or in excess
01 their true value. The problem of to-day's
speculator is whether the reaction has carried
prices below their values or whether conditions
have so far changed as to have increased their
value. The monthly report of the Treasury
Bureau of Statistics Just issued threw some
light on the money question. The circulation,
after deducting sums in the Treasury on Au
yust 1, was 7:21.205 greater than one year
before. Saturday's Treasury statement showed
that the cash balance in the Treasury had in
creased since that time a little over $03,000,000.
This would leave an Increased circulation for
the year of about $100,000,000, not counting the
Imports of gold and the increase in bank cir
culation since August 1. Neither does this take
account of the large Increase in the last few
weeks of Government deposits with banks.
There is room, thei efore, for a very largely
Increased use of money in the country, in spite
of the Treasury's absorption by the loan. The
actual surplus reserve of New York banks, al
though reduced to less than 000,000, also re
quires some qualifying considerations. For one
thing the Government deposits are secured by
Government bonds, thus obviating the necessity
of actual cash reserves to secure them. Some
of these banks do not report their Government
deposits at all In . making out clearing state
ments. Furthermore, the surplus reported is
above the 25 per cent requirement, although
the State banks are required by law to main
tain only 15 per cent of reserve. These facts
explain why the measures of relief offered by
the Treasury Department have not been availed
of.
Bonds were dull, but yielded slightly in thÂ«
late trading. Total sales, $i,Â»6s.niÂ»i.
Government bonds were unchanged.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Bept. 19.â The Eventng Post's
London financial Â«iblegram says: The stock
market opened here good to-day on the more
cheerful political outlook as represented In the
morning papers; on the better prices In Paris,
but there was a sharp reaction later on dull
ness in the Paris bourse and on the chilled op
timism here and prices closed generally dull.
The decline was made marked In such Kaffir
specialties as were dealt In In Paris. Consols
were exceptionally broken, due to a covering by
bears and the fact that money is cheaper than
had been looked for. Americans opened good,
the demand' being chiefly for coal stocks. Only
Northwestern was bought freely. The prices
gave way later on, on selling and the market
was flat, Northern Pacific was especially of
fered.' "Argentines were good on a drop of six
points In the gold premium.
The London market discount sale Is 1% per
cent. The tone is easier on the .falling oft in
the supply of American bills, while It is no
ticed that the bills maturing here are paid off
and not rpnewed.

" CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. Wheat exhibited some
hesitancy during the first half . hour's trading.
Receipts In the Northwest : were -exceptionally
heavy, ] and though the crowd ; was In . a meas
ure prepared â ' for this yet enough liquidation
and : short selling resulted In. prices settling for
a time. This show of weakness was only tenf
porary, however. Notwithstanding the heavy
receipts prices at Duluth, especially ' for cash
wheat, were firm, and this fact caused a bull
ish â  feeling to gradually develop. Besides : the
firmness of the Northern market prices here
were helped to a certain extent by the small
Russian shipments, â¢ 1,200,000 bushels, and the
receipts both here and at New, York of numer
ous foreign buying orders. - Many of the early
sellers turned buyers and in the absence of any !
particular selling pressure December soon re- j
covered its early loss, advancing to 62^c be
fore the demand was satisfied. For son* time ]
after that price was reached the market ruled
very dull, but was steady until after the vis
ible supply statement was completed. This
showed an Increase of 1,782,000 bushels, making I
the total 10.188,000 bushels, compared with 17,
140,600 bushels a year ago. The figures were
a distinct disappointment to bull : traders, as
an increase of not over 500,000 was looked for,
and the market was affected at once. In the
afternoon the market 1 became ! very dull r again
and continued so until the close. September
and December each declined %c.
Corn was dull and Inclined for the most part
to follow, wheat. It was firm early, due partly
to light receipts, but when wheat turned weak
corn did likewise. December closed %c lower.
Oats were very dull. May closed unchanged
after a dull session. There was a , very good
cash demand.
The market ' for 'â  provisions vat weak from
the start and substantial â  declines took place,
due principally to the yellow fever report from
the South. Speculative markets were moder
ately active, but cash trade was light. The
dose was 5@12%c lower on the day.

A "WEATHER
HOODOO"
Mile. Fassi Was in
Despair, t
THE STORM THAT FAILED
LIGHTS, MUSIC, SCENERY, ALL
DROPPED ON HER.
The Famous Russian Fantastio Dan
seuse Suspected She Was the
Victim of a Con
spiracy.
Owing to an inclemency In the "proper
ty" weather and a combination of cir-
cumstances over which no one seems to
have had any control Mile. Faesl, the
"unparoled Russian fantastic danseuse,"
did not linlsh her "turn" last evening at
the A l ham bra Theat.T.
The failure of stage rain to fall In tor
rents and the non-appearance of lightning
flashes, accompanied by the conventional
peals of thunder, which in stageland is
produced by shaking a piece of sheet iron,
is attributed to a well-digested conspiracy
on the part of the stage hands. Mile. Fas
pi, who speaks remarkably good English
for a full-fledged subject of the Czar, does
not hesitate to brand Stage Manager
"Mr." Johnny Williams and Stage Car
penter Simmons as the ringleaders of tne
plot to deprive her of fame and fortune
here In the far West. Stage Manager
"Mr." Johnny Williams and Stage Car
penter Simmons "pooh-pooh, pish-tush"
and "go to" the accusation, and with sin
ister stage "ha-has" laugh the charge of
the Russian maid to scorn.
But, nevertheless, the bald fact remains
that Mile. Fasal's turn was consigned to
oblivion, bo far as the Alhambra is con
cerned, by a combination of eventÃ that
lend weight to her statement.
It happened this way:
Mile. Fassi was billed to appear In a
quartet of "copyrighted electrical danc
ing creations." The opening number was
entitled "the bicycle dance." During this
creation the stage was to be flooded with
rain and the "cloud drop" at the back
of the stage was to reek with thunder and
blaze with lightning. The arrangement
was symbolistic and tended to convey an
impression of a woman cycler overcome in
a greet storm.
After the customary musical introduc
tion Mile. Fassi tripped on the stage and
began whirling and twirling about in the
conventional movements of the foreign
danseuse. Suddenly the lights in the or
chestra went out and the music stopped
with a jerk. Mile. Fassl ceased her danc
ing a moment afterward and looked anx
iously toward the wings. Then she ran off
the stag.-, only to come back again a
minute later, when the lights and music
also ri-sumed. She had no sooner got well
into the swing of the dance when the
lights went out a second time and the
music ceased.
Turning toward the wings on her right
she said In a rather sharp voice, "If you
don't- give light how can the orchestra
play?"
Then the light came back and the
dance went merrily on, only to be Inter
rupted for a third and last time. This
time, however, not by a shutting off of
the light, but by the falling of a scene
drop, which completely shut oft Mile.
j'bb.-.* onA hr-r netting x>t the firmament,
irom the eyes of the wondering specta
tors. The sound of a whistle preceded
the raising of the drop, and then Mile.
Fassi for a second time orated. "I won't
go on with my act to-night. The electri
cian will not properly work .he lights,"
and then with a little bow and the sym
pathy of the audience she left the stage.
When seen In her dressing-room she
s;tid: "Did you ever hear of such a
thing? The stage manager, Mr. Wil
liams, and the fctage carpenter, Mr. Sim
mons, deliberately shut off the lights and
dropped that scene to ruin my act. I'll
sue them all. They are incensed against
me because I demanded that they prop
erly arrange the stage for my act. They
would not Duild a platform for my lights
nor drape the setting in a manner neces
sary to produce my illusion. I com
plained to the managers and they were
compelled to grant a few of my wishes.
I made such a hit at the rehearsal last
night they got jealous and determined to
ruin my turn. When I went on the
stage to-night I felt they had arranged
to Queer the act. Subsequent events
justified my suspicions. My turn was
deliberately ruined by them.
Here is Mr. Williams' Btory: "Absurd,
absurd, absurd! I don't know how it all
happened, and as for a conspiracy it's
pure, simple and unadulterated rot.
Everybody knows me and that settles it.
I don't know what was the matter with
the lightsâ they went out by mistake, may

And Mr. Simmons, the stage carpenter,

it aIL Surely, you cannot think that I
would do such a thing. A conspiracy?

some one turned them out and the scene

Now how could it be a conspiracy?"

Carrying Out a Settled Policy of Gar
risoning the Islands â Efforts
for Begiments Left
Behind.
Joy reigned supreme among the weary
soldiers at the Presidio yesterday. Like
a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky
came the news from Washington that
nearly all the forces were to be sent di
rectly to Manila, and when this fact was
formally made known to the various reg
iments the news spread like wildfire,
causing the greatest excitement and dem
onstration among the men.
The following is the order directing the
movements of troops from San Fran
cisco: i_ â

Oregon Volunteer Infantry, now at Ban Fran

Department of California and will proceed to
Manila. Philippine Islands, reporting upon ar
rival for duty to the commanding general of
the United States forces at that point.
The Quartermasters' department will furnish
the necessary transportation. Bpeclal care be
ing taken to provide sufficient space, and the

raneÂ» for ample and suitable supplies to be
furnished by thÂ«lr respective departments to
lnÂ»urÂ« the well being and health of thÂ« troops
ci ByÂ° command of Major General Miles.
H. O. CORBIN, Adjutant General.
The first order was received by General
Miller Bhortly after 9 o'clock in the morn-
Ing and a few minutes later it was read
by many hundreds upon The Call's bul
letin, which announced the good news
several hours ahead of any of the other
papers. The first dispatch was supple
mented later in the day by the following
additional one:
Adjutant General' a Office,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 19, IS9B.
Commanding General, Department of Califor
nia, San Francisco, Cal.: With approval of
the Acting Becretary of War all recruits and
detachments now at San Francisco belonging
to regiments now In Philippine Islands, Includ
ing the four companies of the Twenty-third In
fantry, are directed to proceed to Manila.
By order Major General Ml leu.
H. C. CORBIN. Adjutant General.
As soon as General. Miller received the
dispatches he immediately communicated
them in the proper I military . manner to
the various commanders 1 interested, and
they In 'turn, informed their men of the
good news. The announcement of the
dispatches was followed by loud and pro
longed cheering,- and : the '.bands of the
Kansas, Tennessee and â¢ lowa regiments
paraded through their respective camps,
followed by the entire regiment, the men
singing and cheering at the top of their
voices. The scene was one not soon for
gotten, but In the camp of the Seventh
Regiment and the California Heavy Ar
tillery a radically different picture was
presented. Colonel Berry and his officers
nad nothing to Bay when they were in
formed of - the dispatches, . but .it was
plainly evident that they felt keenly their
misfortune, and from the expressions of
the men there was left no doubt but that
they regretted their hasty efforts " in se
curing the muster out of . the : regiment.
Major Rice of the heavy artillery was
sorely disappointed that his two batteries
now here were not Included in the list
of those to ' go. He ' bore up ' manfully,
however, and later in the day General
Miller wired thÂ« War Department recom
mending that the heavy artillery be sent
to Manila. His reasons ; for the â â  recom
mendation are that one-third of this bat
talion is already in Manila, and the bat
teries hero are composed of the best
drilled and disciplined men, and as there
Is little artillery in Manila the general
seems to think they will be needed. Th*
general is hopeful â that the department
will consider: his, recommendation favor
ably. Under the â  wording of .-; the dis
patches -General : Miller and his >. staff : are
not included among those to go; and this
fact was a , universal â¢ ' source af * regret
to : every . regimental commander. r It .is

pany this division, but if â¢ such should not
be the case, then Colonel John H. Whol

senior colonel, will be in command of the
troops until they arrive at Manila. â

orrhage.
gotten aboard and the troops dispatched.
This is the length of time which General
Miller estimates will be necessary for the
embarkation of the forces now here, and
judging from the experience of former ex
peditions that have sailed, he has not un
derestimated the time that will be re
quired.
No one seems to think that the orders
received yesterday will have any effect in
stopping the mustering out of the Sixth
and Seventh regiments. Captain Pratt
stated yesterday that it would take until
the first of next week to get the neces
sary papers in shape before the Seventh
could proceed to Los Angeles. The regi
ment will retain 900 of the rifles that were
issued to them, as that was the number
of old ones that they turned in to the
Government.
Should the Heavy Artillery be sent
along with the other forces then the gar
rison duty of the Presidio will probably
be done by either the two troops of the
Fourth Cavalry now here or some of the
companies of the Eighth Regiment. The
Eighth will no doubt be required to gar
rison Angel Island.

WASHING'! ON. Sept. 19.â 1t was stated
at the Quartermaster General's Depart
ment that the returning transports which
have been to Manila on one trip will be
used to take the troops now at San
Francisco to the Philinpines.
Two of these steamers, which will ac
commodate about one-half of the com
mand, are expected to arrive in a day or
two. Other steamers are on their way
and will be sent back as soon as loaded
with troops. Four steamers will be suf
ficient for the transportation of troops
and supplies. It Is believed that less
time will be consumed by using these
transports than in fitting up new vessels.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept 19.-Read
ers of The Call were ad-vised by its Wash

ago that additional troops were to be
sent to Manila. There Is high author
ity for the statement that the dispatch
then received from General Otis was
carefully censored before being given to
the public, urgent demand for more
troops not having been made known. The
War Department shares the fears of
General Otis that Aguinaldo's ready ac
quiescence in the request to withdraw
from Manila and his protestations ' of
fealty to the American cause must be
taken guardedly.
WON ITS FIBST STRIKE.
An Easy Victory for the Newly Or
ganized Plasterers' Union.
The newly organized Plasterers' Union
easily won Its first strike yesterday and
wages have accordingly been raised to $4
per day. Previous to the organization of
this union men were working practically
for what they could get, the general
average being about $2 60 per day.
Satttrday night the employers were
given notice that the union had decided
on a scale of $4 per day and none of the
men would go to work Monday morning
unless the wages were raised. The
strike was of short duration and by 11
o'clock yesterday morning the great ma
jority of the men were back at work. A
meeting of the union was held last night
and several new members took the obli
gation and were enrolled.

A CHANGE IN
THE PUNS OF
THE DEFENSE
Will Not Resort to
Habeas Corpus.
MRS- BOTKIN WAS IN COURT
GRAND JURY MAY INDICT JiRS.
EDWARDS.
Upon the Request of the Defense
Judge Cook Postpones the
Hearing to the 3d of
October.
What appears to be a sudden change In
the plans of the defense brought about
another postponement of the Botkln ha
beas corpus hearing when that case came
up in Judge Carroll Cook's court yester
day morning. The same reason operating,
the hearing on the criminal charge pend
ing before Police Judge Joachimsen was
also postponed, October 3 being the date
set in both cases.
The change in the plans of the defense,
if change It really was, involves a rather
nice point of law, and indicates clearly
the course that will hereafter be pursued
by the prisoner's defenders.
For some days past Messrs. Knight,
Wheeler and McGowan have allowed to
freely circulate the idea that when their
petition for habeas corpus came up for
hearing yesterday morning they would
make a hard fight for the release of their
client. To lend strength to this state
ment it was given out that Mrs. Botkin
would appear in court and would person
ally assist her counsel in the first battle
in open court for her freedom. These
positive statements aroused a good bit of
interest and at the appointed hour yester
day morning Judge Cook's court room
and the corridors of the hall were densely
packed with a mob of men and women,
with the curious sex largely predominant,
ail eager for "Just one look" at the well
advertised prisoner, and with, perhaps, an
incidental interest in the proceeding itself.
Mrs. Botkin, however, was not brought
into court until after the continuance had
been asked and granted. She did appear
finally, upon the arm of Captain Seymour,
and there was a rush that nearly carried
the officer and his charge from their feet.
Women pulled and fought for first place,
and once they gained it drove the pris
oner nearly frantic with their comment
and heartless criticism. When she dis
covered that she had been brought to the
court room for no other apparent reason
than to satisfy the crowd she became de
cidedly angry and did not spare the head
of Chief Lees in saying co. She declared
the whole proceeding a farce and Insisted
upon being immediately returned to her
cell.
That was a matter of no easy accom
plishment. From the court room to the
jail door Captain Seymour had to fight his
way through an almost impassable mob,
and it was only when the iron door
clanged to that he and his prisoner were
rid of them.
The unlooked-for continuance of the
case was as much a surprise to the prose
cution as to the rank outsiders. They had
made every preparation to rearrest Mrs.
Botkin, as soon as she might be liberated,
upon a charge of murdering Mre. Deano,
and it Is evidently this fact that upset
prearranged plane.
When one of the counsel was asked why
the fight had not been made, he said: "We
could easily have freed Mrs. Botkin by
habeas corpus this morning, but as she is
accused of murdering two women and ar
rested upon a charge of having killed but
one, her release would leave her amenable
to rearrest at once upon the second
charge. Governor Budd's decision in the
requisition matter, if it be In our favor,
will make it Impossible to bring her to
trial for murder, and we can then effect
her release by the same means that wa
have already resorted to, and she will
then be tried in this State and upon the
reduced charge of mixing poison with
food."
Chief Lees, however, says he will not
stand for any such plan, but that he will
compel Budd to grant extradition if he
has to make a little law all of his own.
Armed with one of his unique construc
tions of Hawley's opinion on extradition,
and with a haJf-dozen decisions adverse
to hie position, he is going to storm the
executive citadel with the weapons of the
Supreme Court, providing that with his
constructions and decisions he can con
vince the court that he ought to be al
lowed to run at large with tne weapons.
He has threatened the Governor with
everything from a writ of mandate to the
great Lees wrath, but so far without any
apparent result.
The Delaware authorities are pushing
the scheme to convene the Wilmington
Grand Jury, but the full two weeks al
lowed by Governor Budd will probably
have more than elapsed before the case
will be so straightened out that the Gov
ernor can again consider it.
MRS. EDWARDS
MAY BE INDICTED
Prominent Grand Jury Men Think
That She Knows More Than
She Has Told.
There is a. growing probability that the
Grand Jury will, befora no great length of
time has elapsed, find an Indictment
against Mrs. F. C. Edwards upon the
charge of murdering Mrs. John P. Dun
ning.
From the beginning of the Botkln case
the name of the Edwards woman has per
sistently bobbed up in one connection or
another.
The police knew of her confessed in
timacy with John P. Dunning before it
became public and at one time she es
caped arrest only by a hair's breadth.
In Bpeaklng or the matter yesterday a
prominent member of the Grand Jury
said: "We will probably bring an Indict
ment against her if we are successful in
getting at three or four important facts
concerning her past history. We will in
dict her not so much for the reason that
we think her guilty, as that we suspect
that she knows far more of the case than
she has >ld.
"The Tinman has confessed to nearly
every sin that Id written In the immoral
code. ShÂ» las been an associate and cor
respondent of Dur.iing, and has not only
admitted but boa iced of her Intimacy with
him. She is known to be a professional
candy-maker and there are a dozen and
one facts that, collectively, tend to con
nect her with the case. I think there
would be nothing lost by indicting her and
there might be a great deal gained."

DANGER FOR
GRAIN VESSEL
AND LIGHTSHIP
Narrow Escape of the
Clan Macfarlane.
MORE LUMBER RAFTS COMING
TWO OP THEM NOW ON THEIB
WAY FROM ASTORIA.
Second Hate Olsen of the Schooner
Albert Meyer Badly Beaten
in a Whitehall Race by
J. Barrie.
Captain Lowell came In from the light
ship yesterday and told of the narrow es
cape of the British ship Clan Macfarlane.
The vessel left here with a load of wheat
for Europe. She was towed outside and
when a good southeast breeze was en
countered the tug let go and all sail
was set. In a little while the wind fell
light, and then the big Britisher began
to drift. She passed the station buoy,
which has been placed there to guide the
lightship back to her moorings should
stress of weather force her to sea, and
bore steadily down on Captain Lowell's
vessel. All was excitement on the light
ship. The Clan Macfarlane was less than
700 feet away and a collision seemed Im
minent. The lightship was steamed up
to her moorings, and just as everything
was ready for a hasty departure a cur
rent caught the ship and turned her
around. For two hours she continued to
drift back through the Golden Gate, and
then a breeze sprang up from the west
ward which carried the ship and her
valuable cargo out to sea.
Captain Lowell says there must be a
fleet of vessels kept outside by the fog.
Night and day they can hear on board
the lightship the ringing of bells and the
tooting of fog horns. Occasionally the
fog lies low on the water and then, here
and there, can be seen the skysalls of dif
ferent vessels sharply defined against the
sky, but not a sign of the lower yards
and hull. On other occasions the lines
of the hull can be seen and not a trace
of the spars, while yet again neither hull
nor spars can be descried, and yet the
conversation carried on by the crews of
the different vessels can be distinctly
heard. Captain Lowell says that the ex
perience of hearing voices coming from
apparently nowhere Is a weird one, and
the men do not like it.
In spite of the disaster that has over
taken previous rafts, two more of the
structures are now on their way to San
Francisco. The tug Relief and collier Pro
gress are towing one down from Astoria
containing 3,000,000 feet of lumber In piles,
while the Rescue and Monarch are
bringing down from the same place 4,500,
000 feet of sawn lumber. It is the rafts
of sawn timbers that have gone to pieces,
and this one has been strengthened fore
and aft by two and a half inch steel ca
bles to prevent it breaking in two.
People living in the coast towns are
very thankful to the raft owners. Round
about Point Reyes the , ranchers have
been enriched by about 150,000 feet of lum
ber which has come ashore there. Many
a new house has been put up from this
flotsam and jetsam, while old ones have
been repaired. At Moss Landing nearly
another 100,000 feet have drifted ashore,
while Monterey and other points have
been remembered. The people from Coos
Bay to San Pedro have great hopes from
the two rafts now on the way, but they
may be disappointed.
The steamer Czarina finished discharg
ing coal yesterday and went to Howard
No. 2 to load general merchandise for
Seattle and Tacoma. She was to have
sailed last night, but as there was over
600 tons of freight waiting for her she
did not get away until this morning.
Owing to the fog outside and on the bay
an exasperating mistake was made yes
terday afternoon. The collier Titania
waa coming In from Nanaimo, B. C, and
the lookout from Point Lobos mistook
her for the Mall steamer Australia from
Honolulu. The customs officers and the
quarantine doctors went out to meet the
incoming vessel and a crowd of people
gathered on Pacific-street wharf to wel
come their friends when the eteamer
docked. In about half an hour, or when
the vessel was nearly up to Meiggs
wharf, the mistake was discovered and
everybody notified. The mistake was a
natural one, as nothing but the loom of
the vessel could be seen through the fog.
Charles J. Webster, who for nineteen
years has filled the position of clerk to
the Government steamer McDowell in a
manner that has made him a host of
friends, has been slated for the position
of "forage master" to thÂ© United States
troops at Honolulu and will leave for the
Paradise of the Pacific on thÂ© next
steamer.
Second MatÂ© Olsen of the schooner Al
bert Meyer does not think as much of
his abilities as a rower as he did last
Sunday. Yesterday he issued a challenge
to all mariners to row a race to his ves
sel, which is lying off Folsom street, and
back. Jim Barrie took up the challenge
and the two men started in Whitehalls
from Peterson's boathouse. Olsen for
got about the ebb tide and never looked
up until he thought he was nearing the
schooner. Then he discovered that the
current had carried him down to Clay
street. He worked his way back and
found Barrie waiting for him on the
Meyer's deck. Olsen says he will learn
something about the bay of San Fran
cisco before he rows another race.
The pilot boat America has gone to
Sausalito to be overhauled and painted.
She had a narrow escape lasr Saturday.
While working her way In through the
fog an outgoing vessel nearly ran her
down. Some of the pilot boat's standing
rigging was carried away, but she was
not seriously damaged. The name of the
vessel that caused the trouble could not
be ascertained.
The Italian bark Mario, from New
castle, N. S. "W., late the British bark
Carleton, and the British ship Garsdale
from Antwerp made their way Into port
through the fog yesterday.
If dreams are of no earthly use they
at least don't bother a man when he's
busy.

tween myself and him to take place in

not think that he will get a square deal
out there. Well, I'll fight anywhere, and
I'll make this proposition to him: I'll
stand for Martin Julian as referee. I don't
ask any odds of Fitzsimmons. He can
have everything his own way, and If he
doesn't want to fight in San Francisco I'll
meet him anywhere."

STRANDED GOLD
SEEKERS RESCUED
Empty - Handed Men
From Copper River.
BROUGHT ON THE EXCELSIOR
UNCLE SAM BEGINS THE WORK
OF BELIEF.
Fearful Hardships Encountered in
Traversing Northern Glaciers
Becounted by a Los An
geles Woman.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 14, via Seat
tle, Wash., Sept. 19.â The end of the
line of empty-handed gold seekers from
the Copper River country is not yet in
sight, but it must soon be, owing to
the advancing season. The steamship
Excelsior arrived at 2 o'clock this
morning with two more hard luck sto
ries told by as many passengers. This
voyage of the Excelsior is the first sign
that either the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company or President McKinley is do-
Ing the charitable thing to the help
less ones who cannot help themselves,
for the Excelsior has on her passenger
list some fifty men who, though they
did not have enough money to pay the
fare of $60 first class and $40 second
class from Valdez to Seattle, were nev
ertheless accepted for passage. Seve
ral hundred more are at Valdes and
coming back over the glacier, stranded
and broke.
Advices from Captain Abercombie,
commanding the United States regulars
of the Copper River country, have been
productive of results in the War and
Navy departments which will gladden
the hearts of the several hundred men
who are unable to pay their way home.
Those aboard the Excelsior to-night re
ported that the gunboat Wheeling and
another Government ship in northern
waters were to receive orders to carry
the stranded gold hunters back to Pu
get Sound. The Wheeling is now in
Cooks Inlet. About twenty "refu
gees" are in Captain Abercrombie's
camp, mostly old men. Several men
at Valdez have recently escaped hang
ing by a very narrow margin.
Some letters, dated at Valdez, have
appeared in various Eastern newspa
pers during the last summer, booming
the Copper River country, on which no
more than a color of gold has ever
been found. One of these was charged
up against a man named Holman, who
keeps a store at Valdez, and is buying
up all the provisions and other neces
saries at cut-throat prices for the pur
pose of future trade with the Indians.
Cool heads and a small detachment of
soldiers saved Holman from the gib
bet at the eleventh hour. No further
particulars are to be had here at this
time. About 500 men out of the 3500
who have landed at Valdez will spend
the winter in the Copper River Valley
beyond the glacier. Clutina City has
a population of about 300. All the
creeks, the returning gold seekers say,
to the head of Copper River have been
prospected and no more than a few
colors found anywhere, though holes
have been sunk from five to twenty
feet. But there are many colors, and
the question is asked, whence do they
come? Doubtless from somewhere,
but where no pick or spade has dis
covered. Mrs. J. O. Dodge of Los An
geles, Cal., is one of the few ladies
who have seen the Copper River. She
wrote the following to-night aboard the
Excelsior for The Call:
"The Copper River is no place for a
woman, although I am improved in
health and like the climate. We left
Los Angeles last February. We were
seventy-five days on the glacier and it
was perfectly awful. Wood for fires
must be taken along. Our wood soon
gave out. I have stayed in bed seven
days in order to keep warm. I was
also suffering from snow blindness.
Many is the time I would have given
$50 for a few minutes with a gasoline
or kerosene stove. The great trouble
has been that the people started for
Copper River without knowing what
they needed to get along with. We
found colors of gold in the ground
panned out under our tent in several
places, but that was all there was of it
anywhere. The wind is terrible. It
makes balloons of tents. I think some
poor men have fallen down the cre
vasses and will never be heard of
again. We should have known more
about the country we were going to
before we started. I shall be glad to
get back to Los Angeles again, and \
do not want to hunt for gold any more,
My husband feels the same way."

THE DOUBLE
LIFE LED BY
MICHAEL GOSS
A Wife in Malta and
Another Here.
CHILDREN IN EACH PLACE
A CONTEST NOW ON FOB HIS
CALIFORNIA ESTATE.
Wife Number One Proposes to En
force Her Bights â Goss Left
Quite a Valuable
Property.
Citation has just been issued concern
ing- the administration of the estate of
Michael Goss, deceased. Goss lived in
San Francisco for thirty years, during
which time he was engaged in the com
mission business. He accumulated a
comfortable estate, notwithstanding that
all these years he had been supporting
two families, one In San Francisco and
one in Malta. Not till his death did
either family know of the existence of
the other.
Gobs married Rosa Baldachlno, a
wealthy widow of Malta, in 1851. Nine
years later he came to America, intending
when he had found a place to make a
home to return and brin" out his wife
and three children. The civil war broke
out soon after his arrival and Goss en
tered the navy and fought to the end of
the war.
Up to this time Goss hau been known
by his proper name of Michael Cassar,
but on going to enlist, the recruiting of
ficer's Knwledge of Maltese exceeded
Goss' knowledge of English, so they com
promised on a name that both could
spell and Michael Cassar became Michael
Goss. He had, In this country, always
kept this name, while in Malta he was
known by the old name of Michael Cas-
sar.
Goss was wounded at the capture of
Fort Donelson and sent to New York to
recuperate. While there he became ac
quainted with the woman who for thirty
three years has been his recognized wife
and is the mother of his five children. At
the death of Goss she took out letters of
auministratlon on his estate.
Through her attorneys the Messrs.
Cormac, Donohoe & baum, the Maltese
wife now asks to have the letters of ad
ministration set aside and her attorneys
appointed instead. She has waited year
after year in Malta and wondered why
she was not allowed to join her husband
here, and during his last illness wrote to
the British Consul, being under
the control of Great Britain.
Then for the first time she learned how
things were out here. Her son. Guiseppe,
however, had been in San Francisco and
he says that Mrs. Goss of San Francisco
knew of the Maltese wife and knew
there had never been a divorce. Guis
eppe, however, was not introduced as the
son, but as the nephew of Michael Goss.
"Friends and this son from Malta
often came to our home, but how could I
know what they talked of? They always
spoke in Maltese and I do not know Malt
ese?" said Mrs. Goss No. 2 yesterday.
Goss always sent a regular remittance
to the wife In Malta ana seems to have
kept his own counsel, leaving every one
in ignorance of his double life. He was
well known cat the British Consulate,
where he was employed as interpreter,
speaking well all the languages of the
Mediterranean countries.
The property at present is about equally
divided between his estate and that in his
San Francisco wife's name. As the
Malta wife has the prior rtcht phe can
take the property which was in her hus
band's name. The fight will be made
over that remaining In the name of the
American wife.
The contested nronprty consists of two
houses at 2S and 30 Hartford street, in one
of which the family has lived for years.
Three of the children were born there and
still live with their mother.
The youngest daughter, a girl of xb, with

Gives More Employment.
The plant of the Standard Oil Company
has been entirely removed from Fifth and
King streets Into its new buildings be
yond the Seventh-street bridge. The new
quarters embrace a half dozen brick and
concrete structures covering an area of
about six acres. The capacity for making
cans and filling them Is about five times
greater than before and hence employ
ment is given to five times as many men
and boys as formerly. The institution is
now running full handed. Another large
brick storeshouse is in course of construc
tion.

UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA
IS HONORED
Enters the Circle of
Eastern Colleges.
ITS STANDING RECOGNIZED
RECEIVES A CHARTER FROM
PHI BETA KAPPA.
The Honorary Fraternity Which
Represents the Highest Schol
arships Comes at Last to
the Pacific Coast.
BERKELEY, Sept. 19.â News was re
ceived to-day at the University of Cali
fornia that the honorary fraternity of Phi
Beta Kappa had granted a charter where
by a local chapter of that society can be
organized among the college men at
Berkeley. The news is regarded as the
most important that has affected the in
terests of the university for some time
past, because all that has ever tended to
keep the college from being recognized aa
in every way the equal of any Eastern
university will now be a thing of the
past.
Phi Beta Kappa is an honorary frater
nity of Eastern college men, the oldest
organization of its kind in the United
States. It was founded In 1776 as a
secret order, but has since cast aside that
phase of its constitution and now consists
of the graduates of such universities as
Yale, Harvard, Cornell and Princeton,
who have attained eminent distinction in
scholarship during their student career.
The policy of the society has been marked
by a rigid conservatism since Its origin.
Its membership comprises the most dis
tinguished college graduates of the coun
try, and its presence in any university
places that institution at once in the fore
most ranks. For several years Its direc
tors have declined to entertain the no
tion of having a chapter on the Pacific
Coast, but they have yielded at last and
now Berkeley students will be able to en
ter the classic circles of Eastern scholar
ship as in every way the equals of their
brothers on the other side of the con
tinent.
The telegram bringing this announce
ment this afternoon was received with
much satisfaction by the members of the
Berkeley faculty who are Phi Beta
Kappa men. Among their number are:
President Martin J. Kellogg and Pro
fessors Irving J. Stringham, K. C. Bab
cock, Wlllard B. Rising, Mellen W. Has
kell, Carl C. Plehn, J. C. Rockwell, W.
A. Setchell and Herbert C. Nutting. They
have made uersistent efforts to bring
their order to^he coast.
The organization of a local chapter will
be effected as soon as a meeting: of the
faculty members can be called. This will
probably be done within the next two
weeks. They will draft a constitution for
the guidance of their order in the Uni
versity of California.
Dr. Kendrick C. Babcock, who has been
largely instrumental in forwarding the
movement, said to-day that membership
in the fraternity would depend altogether
upon distinction in scholarship. This
means that a certain percentage of the
graduating class of each year will be
elected to membership. Just what that
percentage is to be will be determined
later, but it is expected that not more
than ten or twelve will be initiated an
nuauy. The first election will be held
from among the members of the present
senior class, but the names of the for
tunate ones will not bÂ«\ announced till
commencement day at the close of the
year. The honor of election will then be
considered as one of the highest which
the university can offer, ana it is safe to
say that it will be made the subject of a
very keen competition among the stu
dents.
Saved a Drowning -Boy.
Willie Walters, who said he lived on
Harrison street, near Twelfth, fell into
the dirty waters of Islais Creek yester
day, near the foot of Eighth street, and
came very near losing his life. John Sim
mons, a deckhand of the hay schooner
West Shore, saved him by Jumping in
the schooner's small boat and pulling the
lad in. The boy. who Is 10 ypars old, was
throwing sticks into the water for his dog
to retrieve.

JORDAN ASKED
TO WEAR THE
BLUE AND GOLD
He Has Been Offered the Presi
dency of the Berkeley
College.
Palo Alto Suits Him Just Now, He Says,
and He Does Not Feel Like
Leaving It.
Can President Jordan be persuaded to
forsake Palo Alto for Berkeley Is the
most prominent question now agitating
academic circles. The place has been of
tered to him, he will not say by whom,
but it is rumored It was at the Instance
of Repent Wallace, and there are many
regents who believe the Stanford man
could have the place did he wish to take
it. Dr. Jordan denies that he applied
for the place or tnat he wants It. He
was Interviewed last night and spoke
freely, not only of his own reported can
didacy, but also of other candlates who
had appeared in the lield.
"There has been no official suggestion
of any kind." he said, "it was simply a
tentative talk. 1 appreciate the impor
tance of the position, but I preier the one
I now hold to any other that is possible.
"The best work that is possible can be
done fight bere. Last year I declined to
receive the position that I thought the
most attractive In this country, the direc
torship of the National Museum. That
declination empnasized my doterrr.ina
tion ;u st;ty wiih tiianford University as
long as 1 was worth anything to the in
stitution. We have had a hard strug
gle here, but now that the struggle is about
over, it emphasises the idea of my .stav
ing. We are practically through our
serious difficulties.
"1 think the gift of Miss Flood was a
generous gift indeed, and I hope it will
be the beginning of many such gifts to
both institutions. The State and private
gifts have made both institutions great,
but it remains to private generosity to
bring them both to a higher point. Every
aid given to either university is an aid
that counts for the future development
of California more than a dollar spent in
any other way.
"No Institution is ever so rich or so
strong that it could not be made better
with more money. And so both univer
sities must always welcome such gener
ous gifts as that of Miss Flood, and even
smaller gifts will help in their degree.
"The rich people of California for the
most part have not realized tho pleasure
of giving to universities. I recognize the
vital importance to the State of bringing
the right man to Berkeley, and we of
Stanford are scarcely less interested in
seeing thfÂ» right man elected than the
outside public can be.
"Our relations with President Kellogg
have been all these seven years most j
friendly, and we have learned to value
his sterling good sense and devoted life.
There Is in the faculty at Berkeley more
than one man who would do honor aa
president to any institution in the coun
try, and some of the Eastern men whose
names have been mentioned in this con
nection would certainly be of srreat addi
ti < 'ii to thf intellectual strength of tht
coast. Roosevelt could probably not be
drawn away from his political oppor- I
tunlties. I know him personally as a man
oi charming character, tremendous en
ergy, and the habit of making everything
be touches move. If he agreed to take
up work of this kind he would not makfe
a failure of it. for even his mistakes art
those of enthusiasm and vigor, and some
how turn out to be successes in the end.
"Dr. Albert Shaw, editor of the Re
view of Reviews, is perhaps our highest
authority on municipal government, and
is a man of delightful character, fine
scholarship and great practical experi
ence. While his career has been largely
that of an editor he is also a student
and has large familiarity with university
methods and affairs. He is a man of
the kind that California needs.
"Dr. Edward J. James of Chicago Uni
versity is a singularly energetic and vig
orous man, a hustler in educational mat
ters. His executive ability is remarkable
and he is one of our highest authorities
on economics, especially of those of prac
tical administration.
"Dr. John H. Finley, president of Knox
College at Galesburg, 111., is one of the
most successful of the college presidents
He is a brilliant scholar, particularly
strong In social and economic lines with
a fine literary gift and has the peculiarly
valuable quality of a lovable personality
This has made him the ideal of the stu
dent and alumni of Knox College and
would be a valuable quality in a president
of a large institution.
"Something the same may be said of Dr.
William D. Hyde, president of Bowdoin
College. He is one of the youngest col
lege presidents and one of the most suc
cessful. He has the reputation of being
one of Harvard's brilliant scholars along
the line of philosophical and social ques
tions.
"I see reference to the possible candi
dacy of Professor William James of Har
vard. He 1b personally a most delightful
man, a charming writer and one of our
best authorities on philosophical ques
tions. I have never thought of him In
connection with executive work, but he is
the kind of man who would not fall in
what he might undertake. His character
istics of mind and heart would make him
ADVERTISEMENTS.

in this connection. He is one of the ablest

direct honesty and great executive abil

FORTNI&HTLYB
WILL DJLNCE
Mrs. Gordon Blanding and Mrs. Monroe
Salisbury, patronesses of the popular
dancing class, the Friday Fortnightly,
have made all preparations for the dances
to be given this season. Invitations will
shortly be issued for the meetings, which
will be eight In number. As during the
past successful season, the club will meet
at Lunt'fl Hall on Polk street, and the pa
tronesses will welcome their guests, as
sisted by a committee of representative
ladies.
Last year a place on this committee was
an honor much sought for, and among the
ladles so distinguished were Mrs. A. Borel,
Mrs. E. W. Hopkins, Mrs. Josselyn, Mrs.
H. L. Dodge and Mrs. L. L. Baker. The
Ilrst dance of the Fortnightlys, which will
lie the initial one of the season, will be
held on Friday evening, November 4.
Nothing as yet has been done looking to
the revival of rhe Monday Night dancing
class, nor the Cinderella class, though It
is more than probable that both classes
will he reorganized for the winter season.
The patronesses of the Monday Nights
are Mesdames William Gwin Jr., George
Pope, Osgood Hooker, W. E. Lester,
Southard Hoffman. T. C. Van Ness,
Thomas Breeze, Paul Jarboe and Sidney
Smith.
Mesdames Charles de Gulgne, E. E.
Eyre. Gordon Blanding. Percy Moore,
Robert T. Coleman. A. E. Head. Charles
Josselyn. Charles Page, Austin C. Tubbs,
Joseph A. Donohoe and C. A. Baldwin
hold the destiny of the Cinderella class
In their keeping.
The Debutantes, which was organized
last year by Mesdnme? Keeney and
Blakeman, will in all likelihood not be
reorganized this season.
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Page and family
are guests at the Bella Vista and will re
main there until their handsome new resi
dence on Pacific avenue is completed and
ready for occupancy.
Miss Ethel Keeney will spend the winter
in the East.
Mr. and Mrs. W. D. O'Kane are at the
Richelieu for the winter.
Dr. and Mrs. Louis Bazet are spending
a few days in Sacramento.
GAY LOTHARIO IS
FORCED TO MARRY
Tony Del Monte, 19 years of age, who
has risen from blacking boots at his un
cle's stand tojthe dignity of a barber's
apprentice at $G a week, is a Lothario of
no mean degree, if all reports concerning
him be true. Although engaged during
the day in lathering incipient beards and
musta-chios in the barber shop at 803
Kearny street, he has contrived to find
timo to pay devoted courtship to at least
five pretty lassies in this city and In Oak
land.
In July last he met. In some way, pretty
little Ella Desmond, who resided at the
time with her parents at 22 Scott place.
She was young, barely 15, and guileless,
and before the month was out she yielded
herself to Tony's blandishments.
A few weeks ago, as the girl became
conscious of the fact that her trust in
Tony would eventually lead to her dis
grace, she confided her condition to her
mother. The latter at once caused her
daughter's betrayer to be arrested. Con
fronted with the prospect of a term in
San Quentin, he agreed to make all the
reparation that lay in his power. Des
mond pere's gentle hint that he would
"blow the daylight" out of Tony's body
possibly accelerated the offer.
E. L. Wadham of the Eureka Society
arranged the preliminaries for the prin
cipals, and on Wednesday of last week
escorted them to Cupid Danforth's office,
where a marriage license was procured
As the couple were both under age, their
mothers' consent was first obtained. Jus
tice of the Peace Barry then performed
the ceremony.
LIVELY BLAZE IN A
BOAT-BUILDER'S SHOP
A lively blaze In the boat-building es
tablishment of George W. Kneass, at 718
Third street, shortly after 8 o'clock last
evening, for a time threatened the entire
block, Including the Southern Pacific sta
tion at Third and Townsend; but quick
work by the Fire Department resulted In
the confinement of the flames to the boat
shop.
The fire was first seen by Special Officer
Cunningham In the boiler-room on King
street, and he turned In an alarm from
box No. 63, which was immediately fol
lowed by a second alarm from the same
box. The flames ate their way rapidly
from tho boiler-room into the work shop
and thence to the salesroom and ware
house on Third street.
Two horses and a mule stabled In the
rear of th* factory were taken out by
Officer Beamer shortly after the fire was
discovered. The Arizona warehouse ad
joining the work shop sustained slight
damage from water and it Js believed
that some of the canned goods stored
there may have been Injured by the heat.
The damage to Mr. Kneas'" establish
ment, including that to the buildings
which are owned by him, is estimated
by Captain Comstock to be $7000. Sparks
from the engine are assigned as the cause
of the fire.
LECTURED ON HELLAS.
Walter Miller, professor of classified

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., TUESDAT, SEPTEMBER 20, 1898.
SUPERVISORS FIX THE
TAX LEVY AT $1,318
Dr. Clinton and A. S.
Baldwin Come
to Blows.
Last night, shortly after 10 o'clock,
while the Supervisors were considering
the question of the tax levy, A. S. Bald
win of the real-estate firm of Baldwin &
Howell called at the commute chamber
and sent in his card to Mayor Phelatv
The latter immediately left the room and
joined Mr. Baldwin in the hall outside,
where the two gentlemen chatted together
for a while.
In a few minutes Dr. Clinton strolled
out, and, catching sight of Mr. Baldwin
and the Mayor conversing, joined them.
For a brief apace of time there was ap
parent harmony and then Mr. Baldwin
was heard to take Dr. Clinton to task
for having denounced the Mission Zoo
project. He spoke in a rather loud voice,
and Mayor Phelan endeavored to pacify
him.
Dr. Clinton replied that he had no in
tention of reflecting on his auditor per
sonally. "But speaking collectively, he
said, "I still believe that it is a job and a
steal, and I base my own opinion on the
opinion of several reputable and capable
real estate men, who nave plac.-d a value
on the tract in question of from $85,000 to
$110,000 only."
He said further, speaking calmly and
quietly, that at the time of the appraisals
he had mentioned the five-acre gum-tree
tract was included. "Hence," pursued
Dr. Clinton, "I consider the property
worth only about $75,000. And when the
people of the Mission have much-needed
school facilities, and their other pressing
necessities have been provided for, I shall
then, and then only, vote $75,000 for the
Mission Zoo."
He then said, in substance, that in his
opinion if the city paid a single dollar
above that figure there would be a steal.
At this Juncture Mr. Baldwin interrupt-
HE SLAPPED BALDWIN'S FACE.
A Prominent Real Estate Agent Calls Supervisor
Clinton a Liar and Receives a Blow
in Return.
Ed Dr. Clinton by shouting angrily, "If
you say that that is a job I say you are
a liar." No sooner had the last word
left his lips than Dr. Clinton's open hand
sounded on his cheek. There was a rush
to the spot from all sides. Mayor Phe
lan grasped Dr. Clinton firmly, and Ser
geant at Arms Oiaplnnl seised Mr. Bald
win's uplifted arm just as he was about
to strike at the Supervisor with tho heavy
cane he carried.
"Let me go!" the men cried in unison;
but they were held apart until Mr. Bald
win was called before the board to pre
sent a demand for action on the Zoo
proposition. Ten min-utes later, when he
passed from the committee room, he
again encountered Dr. Clinton.
"Let me speak to you a moment," he
said to the doctor, and the latter, al
though it was sought to restrain him, at
once confronted him.
"You can see me at any time, Mr. Bald
win," he exclaimed. "Here is my card."
"I know where to find you," said the
real estate agent, "and I don't need your
card. But, as I am going out of town to
morrow morning and shall not return un
til Wednesday, J inform you now that I
will have satisfaction then," With this
he left.
Dr. Clinton afterward expressed the
keenest regret at the Incident, and said
that so far as he/was concerned the mat
ter was closed, and Mayor Phelan, who
all along had striven to play the peace
maker, spoke in behalf of Mr. Baldwin to
the same effect.
JIM CORBETT WANTS
VERY BIG MONEY
John Hammersmith, the leader of the
Olympic Club, received a dispatch yes
terday from James J. Corbett, the ex
champion heavy-weight pugilist, statins
that he (Corbett) would fight "Kid" Mc-
Coy twenty-rounds in this city under the
club's auspices any evening In the first
two weeks of November for a purse,
which must not be less than $20,000, and in
case McCoy refuse the offer that he would
"take on" Jim Jeffries, the Los Angeles
heavy-weight. The new directors discussed
the proposition at length and decided that
a $10,000 purse should prove an excellent
Inducement to a defeated champion, now
especially that a contest of this mammoth
kind will not be tolerated In the city of
New York. Corbett will be notified to
day by wire of the club's offer, and It is
certain that he will refuse on a bluff.
At a meeting of the newly Installed offi
cers of the Olympic Club, held last even
ing the following committees were ap
pointed for the ensuing year:
Membership committeeâ J. W. Mullen,
F. P McLennan, and J. 08. Gunn.
Social committeeâ O. B- Burns, E. F.
Preston, and F. G. O'Kane.
Finance committeeâ E. F. Preston, J.
08. Gunn. and H. B. Rubs.
House committeeâ F. P. McLennan, O.
B. Burns, H. V. Ramsdell.
Indoor Athletic committeeâ J. A. Ham
mersmith, H. V. Ramsdell, and J. W.
Mullen.
Outdoor Athletic committee â G. James,
F. G. O'Kane, and O. B. Burns.
The following notice was posted yester
day on the club's bulletin board:
"The Olympic Club in conjunction with
other societies will give an entertainment
for the benefit of the family of the late
Captain R. Richter, First California In
fantry, United States Volunteers, at Me
chanics' Pavilion, on Saturday evening,
September 24, 3898."
A Prominent Forester Returns.
Ben I. Salomon, court room clerk of
Department 6 of the Superior Court, and
chief of the district deputies of the Inde
pendent Order of Foresters for San Fran
cisco, has returned from the session of
the Supreme Court, held at Toronto, Can
ada. To-night he will be present In Court
Yerba Buena, where he will tell of the
doings of the supreme body to all For
esters who may wish to learn about re
i cent legislation.
Appropriations for the
Various City De
partments.
The Board of Supervisors have deter
mined upon a $1,313 tax levy for city and
county purposes. Added to the State
tax of 48.8 cents the total assessment
against property-owners for the next fis
cal year willl be $1,806.
The levy, as fixed, was the result of an
all-day session yesterday of the Super
visors, sitting as committee of the
whole. The meetings were held in the
committee room of the board and were
closed to the general public, only report
ers and invited officials being present.
From the very outset of the proceed
ings it was evident that the majority of
the Supervisors were determined to keep
the levy down to as low a figure as pos
sible. At times there was a disposition
manifested by the minority to increase
expenditures on certain items, as com
pared with last year, but with few ex
ceptions these manifestations were
promptly suppressed. The ostensible
champions of a low tax were Dr. Clin
ton, Dr. Dodge, Dr. Rottanzi, Mr. Smith,
Mr. Morton and Mr. Lackmann, in tho
order named. Clinton was the most pro
nounced opponent to each and every ap
propriation proposed, seldom falling to
move that it be cut down much below the
Auditor's estimate. He wanted the levy
kept to the dollar limit, or failing in that,
to the $1 15 mark.
The proceedings of the Supervisors
while in committee of the whole were, In
detail, as follows:
The board resolved itself into a com
mittee of the whole at 10:45 a_ m., the
statement being^nade at the beginning of
the session that any votes taken on the
subject of the various appropriations
would be subject to change. if, when sum
ming up at the close, the total would
make the tax levy, too high to suit the
Ideas of the majority.
Chairman Roitanssl, - for the Finance
Committee, reported, that it could not
agree on all the items, but would submit
a report upon such as were not in con
troversy, and leave the â¢ Supervisors ,as
a whole to deal with the others. There
was some Wrangling : over this ' proposi
tion, and it was finally determined to
take up the various appropriations as
they came on the Auditor's list, â¢_ without
regard to the report of the committee.
-1 he advertising bills of city and bounty
officers were the. first subjects for discus
slon. It was found that the cost of ad
vertising under this head during 1597-9S
S > %Â°Â°- The Supervisors concluded
that - there was â¢no â  chance to use the
pruning knife here and a similar amount
was allowed for 1893-99.
The Assessor's office next came into
view on the appropriation schedule, and
the knives were drawn. Dr. Clinton head
ed the charge against the serried ranks?
of the Assessor's employes. "There are
â¢â¢s O rJ^ aI Y â¦Â»? lerk | there ,i" he exclaimed.

.Like lions aroused by the smell of blood,
the Supervisors next . gathered .In menac
ing mien about - the attorney, his coun
selors and clerks. This group was well
protected, however, by a hedge of statu
tory enactments; and Dr.^Clinton aÂ«er
several vain attempts, only succeeded In

Supervisors came to the County clerk" l

w^Â» d fffrent "I move that we cut to

too much like drawing life blood to â¢he
for $76 000 erV S> and they fl na"y voted

then engrossed attention. Chairman T Britt.
in the role of economist, said : : "Super

nn M^ -4t 'at least ' m -" remarked
Dodge. Those poor people need it." ThiS
figure was accepted.
, Then the Board iof Health was offered
as a fit subject for dissection and Its ap
propriatlon as ; well. \ Doctors | Rottanzi and
Clinton were t particularly" severe.---, "It's
the worst mismanaged department of the
municipal government," was Clinton's ar
raignment. â¢',"-%â ,-;';â .â¢ .--â â -â  â  .:.-â >â¢ â V!.i-;~.~::%*ri

â  , '"Tut, tut, â , man," interposed Dodge,
"let's act to reason." , . Â°
So the appropriation was cut from the
$90,000 figure of 1897-98 to $70,000 for IS9B-99.
'â¢That will compel the Health Board to
discharge a few dozen useless inspectors,"
was the final comment of Clinton.
The fire department was reduced $25.000
and brought down to the $fioo,ooo basis.
The appropriation for lighting public
buildings went up from $30,000 in 1897-98 to
$40,000 for 1898-99.
The police department remained un
touched at $777,548. The library fund was
increased from $53,000 last year to 166,520.
The school fund passed under the scrutiny
of the Supervisors, and despite a 1 w
kicks it was increased from $1,200,000 in
1597-98 to $1,232,1-10. The street lighting
fund was put at $350,000, an Increase of
$50,000 over last year. For the Hall of
Justice furnishings $40,000 was appropriat
ed. An apropriation of $17,000 for the
opening of a street on the east side of the
Presidio was made. The Street Depart
ment got what it wanted, $535,000, or rath
er, all that it expected to get. This is tho
same sum that was given to the depart
ment last year.
Supervisor Rivers brought up the Mis
sion Zoo scheme and moved that $22.1,000
be given for its purchase. He also
wanted $75,000 for St. Mary's Park. No
objection was raised to the $75,000 award,
but the Mission Zoo was roasted, if it be
possible to roast a zoo.
"It's a job and a fraud on the taxpay
ers," said Dr. Clinton. "The price asked
I is four times what the property is worth.
I I took competent real estate men out
there and they told me the tract was
not worth a cent over $75,000. why, then,
should the city pay over $200,000? It Is
an outrage to suggest such a thing."
I Again came an unexpected break on the
part of Supervisor Britt. "I must vote
! against the Mission Zoo," he said.
Rivers, who sat next to him, leaned
over and said a few emphatic things, sub
rosa, but apparently without effect.
"They could not pass it because I
I would not let them," whispered one of the
Supervisors near the reporters' table.
After some hot wrangling, in which
1 Sheehan, Devany, Delany and Haskins
| sided with Rivers, the Zoo projeot was
| dropped.
During the afternoon the committee of
the whole adjourned from the committee
room to the chamber of the Supervisors
and resolved Itself into a board, with
Mayor Phelan In the chair, to receive
bids on the plans for a new City and
County Hospital and transact other busi
ness. There were eighteen architects
who offered plans and the side of the
room was cumbered with big boxes con
taining the same. Following the pre
sentation of tho plans, which remained
unopened, the opinion of the City and
County Attorney on the illegality of the
proceedings was read.
Some discussion followed as to how the
architects were to be compensated for
their waste of time, if the hospital could
not be built. It seems that the board
offered three prizes of $1000, $750 and $500
for the best set of plans. No decision
as to what should be done about the re
wards was reached.
Following the board meeting the Su
pervisors returned to the committee room
and resumed the consideration of thÂ» tax
levy. The various items were finally put
together and before recess was taken Ex
pert Cyril Williams stated that tne to
tal city and county levy, on the basis of
the appropriations passed, would be
$1,298, or practically $1 30. Adding the
State tax would bring the total up to
about $1 79.
The Supervisors reconvened at 8:30 p. m.
as a committee of the whole, and after
several matters relevant to street Im
provements had been disposed of, Super
visor Rottanzl moved that the considera
tion of the Mission Zoo be postponed in
definitely in order that the tax levy
might be taken up. Before this could
be done, however, it was suggested that
the resolution to purchase 'the Miranda
Tract, a strip of land adjoining the Pre
siuio, be adopted. Supervisor Rottanzi
explained Its provisions :it length, and
Mayor Phelan stated that the identJcal
resolution had been repeatedly passed by
the board. He did not favor its passage
unless the Supervisors would pledge
themselves to make use of the money af
ter it had been appropriated, and 'with
this understanding it was immediately
adopted.
Dr. Rottanzi then asked that a sum
should be segregated from tne school
fund with which to erect and maintain an
addition to the Polytechnic School. This
was also reserved for future considera
tion. Supervisor Haskins thf>n an
nounced that the Finance I ommittee had
prepared an estimate for the tax levy
which an'Toximated $1 29. but upon Dr.
Clinton's query ns to whether or <not It
included the $75,000 for the St. Mary's
Park, he remained silent. "We will put
it in," said Dr. Rottanzi. But Dr. Clin
ton spiritedly replied that he Insisted
upon knowing why it had been left out.
Mr. Haskins appeased him. however, and
Dr. Rottanzi moved that all proceedings
seeking to condemn land for the Mission
Zoo be at once dismissed. Supervisor
Rivers offered an amendment to the ef
fect that the <~Mty and County Attorney
be instructed to this end, and the motion
was unanimously carried.
At this point the board's proceedings
were Interrupted by an occurrence which
was not on the programme, and though it
took place just outside the committee
room the noise and disorder which on
sued were sufficient to bring all business
to an end for several minutes. The par
ticulars of the incident, in which Super
visor Clinton and A. S. Baldwin, the real
estate apent. wore the central figures arÂ«
set forth in another column. Shortly be
fore 10 o'clock the committee adjourned
sine die, and five minutes later met in
th" board room as the board proper.
The committee of the whole then pre
sented _lts estimate, fixing the tax levy
at ll.Slu. and it was about to be sub
mitted to a vote when Mr. Haskins. at
the Instance of the Auditor, moved thnt
the figure be fixed at $1,318. His motion
was seconded by Supervisor Morten, and
a vote had. AH the Supervisors voted
aye except Clinton. Liackmann, Rottanzi
and Dodge, these four voting In the neg
ative. Supervisor Devany then moved
that the board adjourn until next Monday
at 2 o'clock, nnd his motion was unani
mously adopted. It was exactly seven
minutes past 11 o'clock when the board
ceased its labors.

MUST RETURN THE MONEY.
Judge Seawell handed down eight judg
ments against the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company yesterday. They were for
various amounts, ranging from the hun
dreds into the thousands.
About thirteen years ago the Southern
Pacific Company, through its land agent
Jerome Madden, entered into contracts
with many well-known people of this
State, by which the company agreed to
turn over lands in the southern part of
the State for certain stipulate^ prices to
be paid on installments. Tne lands which
the company wished to dispose of were
claimed under certain acts of Congress
but the company had not, at tnat time'
secured perfect patents. It was agreed
by the company that in event the patents
to the land were not forthcoming the
moneys paid in would be returned to
those who proposed to purchase in ac
cordance with the contracts. In 1593 ten
years after the making of the contracts, j
eight of the parties being dissatisfied at j
the delay, demanded a return of the I
moneys they had placed in the hands of
the company. It was not forthcoming I
and suit was instituted. The Court held I
that by reason of the delay on the part
of the company the plaintiffs were entitled
to recover and judgments in favor of the
following litigant* and against the com
pany were handel down: Mary Schwartz.
Ji'll4 40; A. C. freeman, $1216; Philip
Scheld, $652 SO; Flndlay R. Dray, $947 20;
James O. Coleman, $1305 60; H. H "Wilson,
8P47 20; T. M. Lindley, $1036 80. and M. A.
Lindley, $857 60.

visited police headijuarters yesterday af
ternoon and invoked the aid of Chief Lees
in finding a young woman named Marno
I-oeber.
Zawadill believes that she has been
foully dealt -with. About a month ago the
woman left this city intending to seek
employment in the interior.
On August 27 Zawadill received the fol
lowing letter from her, dated Sacramento:
Dear Mr. Zawadill: I have got as far as
Sacramento. I found out that the Lincoln
Company was going to keep back my fare
that they had advanced to get me there with,
out of next week's salary-
Tuesday w.is pay day and I collected what
little waa coming to me, and without my fel
lmv-u..rkprs being aware, I took an early train
for Sacramento. The reason I advised you not
to wite was because I Intended to get away
before they had a chance to abuse me. . I did
nut want you to know that I was in Sacra
mento, as I felt that you would write to me,
and Ifeared that the tleter would fall Into,
their hnnds.
I want to return home by next week. I went
to work Thursday in the cannery in Sacra
mento, but as business '- dull, we work only
two or three hour? a day. I make only thirty
cents a day, and I am compelled to live like a
do;?. Try to assist me in 'retting home.
My health is n.t good, and the heat has
made me sick. When I reach home I will ba
in a bad fix, aÂ» I owe some six weeks' room
rent. When I left there I promised to send
them some money in a couple of weeks. I had
none to Fend, and my heart Is heavy, knowing
that I cannot explain matters to them. Direct
your reply to this letter to Sacramento, and I
will get it at the Postoffice. Tell Mrs. Dough
erty I have got this far. I know she will bh
sorry for me. I know you are too. My life,
God knows, has become a failure. Send me a
dollar if you can spare It, as I am anxious to
get back home, if you cannot, write any-
way. I want to get home as soon as possible.
I have been in bed all day aa I am sick. Re
spectfully. MARNO.
"Since I received the above letter I have
not heard from the poor girl," remarked
Zawadill, when telling his story to Chief
Lees. "I know something has happened
to her or she -would have answered my '
reply to her letter. I am satisfied that
she has met with foul play and I Intend
to at once teltprraph to the Sacramento
police, with a view of ascertaining wheth
er or not she is dead."
