LINARES MAY APPLY THE
TORCH TO THE DOOMED CITY
THREATENS
TO DESTROY
SANTIAGO
Says He Prefers to Burn
the City Rather Than
Surrender.
Refugees Declare the Span
ish Soldiers Are Dis
heartened and Ready
to Give Up.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 5.
General Linares, in command of
the Spanish forces in Santiago.
will not surrender to General
Sliafter, according to statements
made by refugees who arrived
here from Santiago to-day.
"] shall burn the city to the
ground first," they quote General
Linares as having declared.
Since the effects of the fierce Ameri
can attack bec;.me known in the city
the residents and nearly all the soldiers
have lieon strongly in favor of surren
dering before the Americans can be
gin a bombardment.
Blxty-three refugees were brought
from Santiago on the British men-of
war Alert and Pallas, and seventy
Others on the Austrian warship Maria
Teresa. The Â» â¢ :if> fat the wharf vhen
the refugees wcro landing was graphic,
many persons having gathered to learn
trK' latost news from the beleaguered
city.
When the refugees left Santiago the
American troops were within 300 yards
of the barbed wire fences, just outside
of the city lines, and the Archbishop of
Santiago had appealed to the comman
rii-r to surrender rather than be sub
jected to bombardment. General Li
nares, although In great pain. from the
injury to his arm, and compelled to
depend for support upon General Taral,
absolutely refused, to comply with the
Archbishop's request. He emphasized
his refusal, I am told by several of
to-day's arrivals from Santiago, by de
claring that he would burn the city be
fore he would permit.it to fall into the
hands of Americans. The Spanish
troops had been greatly reduced in
numbers just prior to the arrival of
General Pando's reinforcements.
The refugees declare that Linares
had only 4000 regulars and 200 volun
teers left with which to defend the
city. Several thousand of his men had
been killed or wounded, and Admiral
Orvera was no longer aiding with his
fleet. The enemy's troops were much
depressed over these conditions, and
their spirits were further lowered by
the wounding of General Linares, and
the death of General Vara del Rey,
Who succeeded General Linares in com
mand of the troops at the front.
If the Spanish troops could have their
â¢way, I am told, they would surrender
to General Shafter forthwith. The ref
ugees generally agreed that the city
would be surrendered, but the Spanish
leaders showed' no. lnclination to adopt
that course. General Pando's arrival
with 7000 additional troops, by the lat
est information here, places the total
strength of the Spanish In Santiago at
only a little more than 11,000.
Only two houses in the city of San
tiago had been destroyed by the Ameri
can fire up to the time the refugees left
for Kingston, but .the Spanish ship
Trafalgar, Which was lying in the har
bor, had been sunk by a shell. Two
men were killed and five wounded. One
woman was kilfed. by the firing on the
city. The refugees, left Santiago in
l>'>ats, being allowed to take no bag
gage. CrAwds surrounded the con
sulates *n the beleaguered city, praying
for permits to leave.
Flour is ri.ot obtainable in Santiago,
beef costs $1 40 a pound, rice 50 cents
a pound and lard $1 a bottle. Refugees
pay they paw many persons lying on
tlif plaza of Santiago dying of starva
tion. â ' â¢
It was announced officially in Santi
ago during the American attack on
Saturday that Admiral Camara's fleet
had bombarded Key. West.

CREDIT IS DUE
TO BOTH SCHLEY
AND SAMPSON
How It Should Be Divided Between
Them Official Reports Will
Determine.
NEW YORK, July 5. â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Until Rear Admiral Sampson's official report of the batiLg of Santiago
has been received if will be in.j" rmine In .v the credit for
the admirable work done by the American fleet in destroying Admiral
('ervera's ships should be divided between the admiral and the second
in command. Commodore Sehley.
Unfortunately for ,Admiral Sampson he happened to be absent from
the fleet to attend a conference with Major General Shafter at the
time when the Spanish ships left Santiago harbor, and he did not get
back in time to take charge of the first part of the fight, which was, con
sequently, conducted under ordors of Commodore Schley.
This being the case, some persons who have been impatient with
Rear Admiral Sampson for some time because he did not run his fleet
into Santiago harbor in the face of the land batteries and Cervera's
fleet and through the mined channel have hastened to give Commodore
Schley all the credit for the victory.
The Secretary and officials of the Navy Department are confident
that when Admiral Sampson submits his official report he will give
Commodore Schley full credit for his prompt work in getting the ships
of the fleet into action against the Spaniards. He will also give due
credit to all the officers and men who especiallydistinguished themselves
in the fight. Incidentally this report will indicate the part Admiral
Sampson personally took In the fight.
Upon one point all are agreed. That is that Commodore Schley and
the commanding officers of the several ships handled the fleet and its
individual fighting units in a manner that could not have been im
proved upon, and that they are entitled to all the praise that Admiral
Sampson will doubtless give them in his report and to such recognition
as Congress may see fit to bestow upon them.
the harbor as actually was made he
had, soon after his arrival, mapped out
a careful plan to meet it. In this plan
the part that was to be played by each
ship In every contingency that could
be foreseen was laid down and each
commanding officer was given instruc
tions as to what he was expected to do.
When the contingency which Admiral
Sampson had foreseen arrived there
was little time for Commodore Schley
to give orders, but he and the captains
of the ships promptly realized the sit
uation and carried out the plans of the
admiral with such changes as the ac
tions of the Spanish ships made neces
sary.

As a matter of fact, there is no war

ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: There is a possibility that be
fore the Spanish sailors are sent north
something will be done looking to the
exchange of Hobson and the men un
der his command for some of the ' Off
icers who were on board the Spanish
warships. Assistant Naval Construc
tor Hobson has the rank of lieutenant
of the junior grade, and under the rules
of civilized warfare he should be ex

The department, however, is willing to
waive the 'question of rank, and will
give an officer of . the grade of com

obtain an exchange of the American
heroes.
It is not believed the Spanish will
surrender Hobson and. the., men with
him at this time on account of the
knowledge they have of Santiago's de

the Spanish Government, several week*

CONSULS DEMAND THAT
THE CITY SURRENDER

KINGSTON, Jamaica. July s.â News
has reached here that after General
Taral, the Spanish commander at San
tiago, had refused to comply with Gen
eral Shafter's second demand for the
surrender of the city the foreign con
suls in Santiago united in a demand
that there be a cessation of hostilities
until the 30,000 foreigners in the city
could be removed from danger. It was
their intention to take these people out
p.nd put them under tlie protection of
the United States. The American com
mander declined to comply with this
demand, and told the consuls that they
should insist on the surrender of the
city. The consuls had another confer
ence and decided to act on this advice.
A formal demand has now been served
by the consuls and they are waiting
the reply of the Spaniards.

ON BOARD THE CAIL-HERALD DISPATCH-BOAT SOMMERS
N. SMITH, WITH THE FLEET, July 4, via Kingston, Jamaica, July
5. â I have just had an interview with Admiral Cervera, who received
me very courteously. He said:
"I wish to present my compliments to The Call and Herald. I do
not wish to- make a statement at present, although I am deeply sen
sible of the generous treatment accorded to myself and to my men by
the American sailors, from the rear admiral down to the officers of his
fleet.
"I received orders twice from Madrid to leave Santiago harbor and
go to Havana, and fully realized the difficulties that beset my path,
but the honor of the Spanish navy demanded of me that the move
ment be made and I gave the order for my fleet to dash forth to al
most certain destruction."
Lieutenant Juan Aruar, third officer of the cruiser Infanta Maria
Teresa, dictated the following statement:
"We staked all on the chance of catching the American fleet nap
ping and we have lost. Our fleet has been wiped out and Spain's naval
power is suddenly shattered. That is the situation which Spain must
face. The war eanoot be continued with any hope of success. We
have done our best, but we have been overcome by a superior force.
"Admiral Cervera decided last Wednesday to ieave Santiago in
obedience to instructions received from Madrid, which ordered him to
proceed to Havana in order to assist in the defense of that city. The
fleet accordingly coaled and provisioned and the men ashore were re
called."

After Admiral Cervera's fleet had
been destroyed the body of a handsome
Spanish officer drifted between the aux
iliary gunboat Gloucester and the
shore. It was lashed to a spar and the
face was upturned. The Cubans on
shore fired at it, whereupon Lieutenant
Commander Richard Wainwright of
the Gloucester, who had so gallantly
fought the whole of Cervera's fleet the
day before, fired blank shots in their
direction. Then he shouted through
the megaphone '"I will use six pounders
on you if you do not stop firing on that
body." The Cubans fled through the
bushes.
When I asked Captain Robley D.
Evans of the lowa what he thought of
Sunday's battle, he said: "God and

GRACEFUL COURTESY

WASHINGTON, July 5.â A graceful
courtesy was to-day extended to the
captured Spanish admiral, Cervera, by
the President. Through General Gree
ley, chief signal officer, permission was
sent to Cervera to communicate with
his family in Spain by cable. Permis
sion was also granted to other cap
tured Spanish officers to use the cable
to transmit personal messages to
friends in Spain. The messages will be,
of course< carefully censored and noth
ing will be allowed to pass that would
be of assistance in any manner to the

OUR SHIPS
WILL ENTER
THE HARBOR
Sampson and Shatter to'
Join in Bombarding
Santiago.
Plans of tile Attack Left
Entirely to the Decision
of the Two Com- ;^
manders.
WASHINGTON, July s.â As a result (
of the Cabinet meeting: to-day instruc
tions-were sent by the President tn Ad
miral Sampson and General Shaffer to
confer together concerning: a,.- joint plan
of attack upon the city. Upon the out
come of this conference depends the
line of action for the immediate future. v
For the present the land bombardment
by General Shafter's forces has been
deferred, as the situation is so com
pletely changed by the annihilation of
the Spanish fleet that is is manifestly
the part of -wisdom for this land bom
bardment to await the co-operation
and support of a bombardment from
Admiral Sampson's fleet.
General Shafter's demand for ihe sur
render of Santiago, on pain of bom
bardment, was made at 8:30 Sunday .
morning. An hour later Admiral (er
vera made his suicidal dash from the
harbor, resulting in a complet? trans
formation o f the naval anl military
conditions. Instead of a menacing ..
Spanish fleet within the harbor, * In
way has been cleared, save for the
fhrre batteries, for the entrance of the
Americas fleet up to the very wharves
of the city With this matenal chÂ£<ng,e
wrought it was obvious to the autr.o; i
ties bore that the blow first intend*'! to
be delivered by General Shaftor aJcne
woulu be duubly effective and decisive â¢â 
If the two iorces could be brought tr.
gether and strike simultaneously from .
land and sea.
â  It is for this reason that the confer- .
ence between the American general and
the admiral was called. Up to the close
of office hours to-day no word had come
either to the War or Navy Department;
so far as was disclosed, as to what de
termination had been reached at the
conference. At the same time it Is the
expectation of the authorities that the
conference will result in' a determina
tion by the admiral to take his fleet
through the narrow neck of the harbor, .
making his way past the shore bat
teries and fortifications, and take posi
tion before the city for bombardment.
There is reason to believe that the in
structions sent to Admiral Sampson at
least conveyed the desire, if not the
order, that he enter the harbor. But
it is said that the admiral and the gen r
eral continue to be the supreme officials
in authority, and that, being on the : .
scene, fully alive to all the conditions,
their judgment will be taken as filial in
the course to be adopted.
There is said to be no obstacle, so far
as navigation is concerned, to the. en- .
trance of the harbor by the American
fleet. The Cristobal Colon, which
cleared the Merrimae and got out of. .
the harbor on Sunday, drew 23 feet 3
inches, which is within seven inches of
the draft of the battle-ships lowa, In
diana, Massachusetts and Oregon, and
is greater than the draft of the battle
ship Texas. Moreover, the Navy De
partment has known for the last ten
days that the neck of the channel was"
open, despite the sinking of the Merri- ;
mac, and that there was a clear seaway
of seven fathoms, through which any'
ship in our navy could sail. This re
moves all difficulty, except from sub-'.
marine mines, or from the shore bat
teries.
As to the mines, little account Is
taken of them, since the Spanish fleet
passed over them. The Spaniards are
in the habit of using contact mines, so
that there is little likelihood of there
being mines operated by electric con
nection with the shore. .
The forts and batteries have been
badly weakened by the constant fire
of the fleet for many weeks past, an*
while still a factor, they are greatlj>
disabled.
Once up to the city the fleet :.nd army
could combine in a terrific double fire.
No less than 292 heavy Runs would be
trained from the American warships on
the city and at the same time the big
siege guns, which, it is expected, have
been brought to the front of Shatter's
line, would rain down a torrent of steel
from that quarter. The siege guns
throw shells of 135 pounds. Aside from
them there are four modern howitzers,
with guns of a smaller caliber. These
are in the heavy artillery, while the
light artillery embraces a great number
of guns of .2 caliber. Combined this
fire from land and sea would be "terrific
in its effect.
The action of the foreign represents- .
tives at Santiago has been an additional
reason for deferring the bombardment.
It was made known late to-day that
one of General^ Shafter's dispatches
stated that these represeatatives ha.42
Joined In a request to him to put off
the shelling of the city for another brief
period, until their respective colonies
could be removed. This accounts for
the departure of the foreign warships
from Santiago harbor, as they are bear-
Ing away the foreign residents in the
period before the bombardment begins.
The activity of the Consuls at Santiago
has led to no diplomatic complication
which has reached the State Depart
ment thus far and the authorities here
believe that nothing will develop.
The State Department to-day took
occasion to dispel some of the Spanish
illiiM";is over the escape of Admiral
Cervera'a fleet It seems that Madrid
is not alone in the belief that the fleet
made a handsome sortie from Santiago
and left the American ships far in the
rear.
To-day a cablegram came from
United States Minister Lunis, at Cara
cas, saying the Spanish residents there
were glorifying the naval victory. The
Minister was informed briefly that Cer
vera's fleet had been destroyed, the
admiral made a prisoner, and that Gen
eral Bhafter had demanded the surren
der of the city.
Th" definite official report which
reached here to-day that the Spanish
fleet had entered the Suez canal made
no change in the plans of the Navy De
partment as to sending Commodore
Watson's squadron to the coast of
Spain. Secretary Long said it would
start at the earliest possible moment,
but he did not care to give the day of
departure.
The annihilation of the Spanish fleet
continues to be an absorbing topic
among naval officials, and th ;. in -â  v-
Ing most generous praise to Commodore
y for the dashing manner in
which he destroyed the lleet, when the
immediate command fell to his lot. The
commodore's friends have long pre
dicted that if he got an opportunity he
would render a good account of the
fighting ability of the American navy,
and they are glad the opportunity was
finally reached.
It is perhaps the greatest achieve
ment in a long line with which Commo
dore Schley's name has been associated,
others Including the relief of the Gree
ly Arctic expeditioil, and the com
mand of the Baltimore at Valparaiso
result of a mob attack on the
lean bluejackets.
The Navy Department has no addi
tional details of the annihilation of the
Spanish fleet, and it was said that the
dispatches from Sampson and Watson
giving the essential facts were not like
ly to be followed by more minute de
tails except through the mail. Admiral
Sampson was not present when the en
f,.iK-nient began, and Commodore Wat
son's dispatch of last night indicates
that he had reached Santiago after the
light.
In the absence of both Sampson and
Watson, the direction of the fight
would have fallen to Commodore
Schley, and, being in the heat of the en
gagement on the ilagship Brooklyn, it
seems probable that he gave the sig
nala by which the American ships
uvered and selected their various
points of attack. The department offi
cials feel the same sentiments of grati
tude for all the officers participating in
the great battle, as it is felt that each
of them contributed to the utmost ac
cording to the circumstances of his po
sition.
The disposition of Admiral Cervera
and the 1500 prisoners is receiving the
attention of naval officers to-day, but
no exact determination has yet been
reached. Admiral Cervera will be
treated with the consideration due his
rank, and the department officials ex
a sense of gratification that Lieu
tenant Commander Walhwright show
ed the gallantry characteristic of the
American navy when he received the
defeated admiral on board the cruiser
Gloucester and tendered him the use of
his cabin.
SECOND BRIGADE
LEAVES CAMP ALGER
WASHINGTON, July s.â The Second
Brigade of the First Division of the
Second Army Corps broke camp at
Camp Alger this afternoon and started
on their journey to Santiago to rein
force General Shafter's army. The Sec
ond Brigade is composed of the Eighth
Ohio. Sixth Illinois and Sixth Massa
chusetts, General Garretson command-
Ing. The Sixth Massachusetts was the
first to get away, going aboard the cars
at Dunloring and leaving for Charles
ton, S. C, shortly after 10 o'clock. The
other regiments will depart before day
break;
The Ohio regiment left for New York,
where it will embark on the St. Paul,
while the Illinois troops go to Charles
ton. S. C, and with the Massachusetts
m<-n -will be transported upon the Har
vard and Tale. All superfluous bag
gage was left behind and everything
that could be spared was discarded, it
being the desire to move the regiments
with all possible haste. Only six horses
were allowed to a regiment, all other
Animals belonging to the brigade be
ing retained here, whence they will be
shipped as soon as possible to Tampa,
â¢ under charge of an officer, and from
there they will be sent later to Santi
\ago. The brigade is in fine condition,
and the men left t-nthusiastlc and eager
to- reach the seat of war before the end
of the Santiago campaign.
It is expected to have the troops off
Santiago by Sunday. When the sol
diers left Camp Alger they were given
a royal send-off by the men who were
left behind.
REINFORCEMENTS FOR
SHAFTER TO BE RUSHED
â¢WASHINGTON, July s.â General
Shafter, in a dispatch received last
night, confirmed the report that Gen
eral Pando. with about 60?0 Spaniards,
had arrived" in the city, and that the!
reinforcements were already distributed
among the fortifications. This makes !
the Spanish forces defending the city
froir 16,000 to 18.000. The very great
advantage of being entrenched adds :
materially to their strength, and in the ;
oninion i f military men makes their i
effective fighting force from - third to
a half greater than our own.
Orders were given looking to the im
mediate dispatch of troop ships from
Tampa with reinforcements for Shafter j
and others now at Santiago will be â 
brought here at the earliest moment to
fdd in the transportation of reinforce
ments. It is probable that at least 15,
000 will be sent forward as rapidly as
transportation can be provided. Thus
nugmented there seems to be no doubt i
â  that the forces under General Shafter |
â will be able to Ptorm and take the city I
' -without delay. These are the views en
tertained by members of the Cabinet,
who talk freely on the subject. Never
theless the order under which both!
army and navy are now operating gives
(he comma ndf-rs wide discretion, and it
is not doubted that, should changed
circumstances seem to warrant it an
aggressive movement will be begun.

CAMARA ON
THE WAY TO
PHILIPPINES
Watson Will Be Sent to
Pursue and Destroy
the Fleet.
Three Torpedo-Boat Destroyers
Return to Protect the Home
Ports of Spain.
NEW YORK. July s.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Admiral Caraara, with
one battle-ship, one armored cruiser,
four troopships, one ammunition-ship
and colliers, entered the Suez canal
this morning on his way to the Philip
pines. Three torpedo-boat destroyers,
which accompanied his fleet to Port
Said, left that port to-day to return to
Spain, the first stop being announced
as Messina, Italy. This official infor
mation was received at the State De
partment this afternoon from its agents
at Port Said.
Furthermore, it was learned that Ad
miral Camara had succeeded in procur
ing what is considered in naval circles
a small supply of coal for the number
of ships with him. The detachment
of the torpedo-boat destroyers is cred
ited by the department officials, first, to
the destruction of the Spanish fleet un
der Cervera and to the desire of the
Madrid Government to have at home a
fleet which will be useful for offensive
purposes against the American squad
ron intended to operate against the
Spanish coast; and, second, the diffi
culty these vessels would experience in
making the voyage through the Red
Sea and Indian Ocean.
By the detachment of the three de
stroyers Spain has considerably weak
ened Camara's fleet. The troopships,
colliers and ammunition ships.
though armed with Hontoria guns, will
be of little value in case of a conflict
with the American fleet under com
mand of Rear Admiral Dewey. It is
evident to the officials that Admiral
Camara's squadron is too weak to at
tempt to enter Manila harbor, and that
he will proceed to some other point,
where he will establish a base and
make plans for desperate resistance
against American attack, and which
will justify Spain in laying claim to
the islands upon the conclusion of the
war.
It will be especially for the purpose
of preventing a successful consumma
tion of this plan that Commodore Wat
son will be sent to the far East to giv
battle to Camara and to destroy his
fleet.
It is presumed in official circles that
Commodore Watson is making final
arrangements with Rear Admiral
Sampson for the formation of the East
ern squadron, and it is expected that
by the latter part of this or early dur
ing the coming week the vessels as
signed to his command will be on their
way to the Mediterranean in pursuit of
Camara.

TOO LIBERAL
IN HIS VIEWS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, July s.â Trouble is
brewing in the church circles of thi3
city. As a result of a controversy
which came to a climax at the meeting
of the board and members of the First
Christian Church to-night it is prob
able that a new congregation may be
organized shortly, and at its head. will
be Jay William Hudson, for the past
year and a half in charge of the organ
ization which at to-night's meeting de
decided to dispense with his services.
Since his arrival here Mr. Hudson
has been recognized as a speaker gifted
with rare eloquence, a worker of much
energy and ambition and an organizer
of skill. But his creed was evidently
too liberal for some of the more con
servative members of his flock, and at
the meeting to-night out of 158 present
80 voted to dispense with his services,
while 78 were against the proposition.
Professor A. 0. McMeans read the re
port of the board, giving the replies
made by Mr. Hudson to a series of
questions propounded a few days ago.
Then the pastor made a speech in
which he said:
"On the principle of liberty of thought
I stand to-night, and if I am again
called to the pulpit of this church I
want it to be on this principle on which
my country is founded and which
should be the only creed of the church
universal. If you cannot give me the
liberty of my individual conscience I
ask you to extend to me no call, for
I can give to the world no less grand
principles."
The First Christian Church is the ]
largest in point of membership in this
city, and if, as Mr. Hudson said to
night was under serious discussion, it
is decided to form a new organization
with Mr. Hudson at its head, the body
over whose destinies the reverend gen
tleman has lately presided will un
doubtedly feel the effect.
Scarcity of Water.
WOODLAND. July 5.â The light rainfall
for tho season seems to have affected the
â¢water supply all over the valley. In this
city the mills which furnish the public
supply are failing, and it is necessary to
enforce rigid economy in the use of water
In order to avert a famine. This scarcity
will remain prevalent until the fall rains.

LARGE LIST
OF WOUNDED
Copyrighted, IS9B, by the Associated Press.
BEFORE SANTIAGO. July 3 (per
Associated Press dispatch boat Dandy
to Port Antonio, Jamaica, July 4, via
Kingston, Jamaica, July 4. â The fight
ing during the last two days has cost
the American army 1700 men. This es
timate is made by the surgeons at di
vision headquarters after careful fig
uring by the surgeons at the hospitals.
The list of wounded, as made up at
the division headquarters, Is very large
in proportion to the list of those killed
outright.
Probably less than one hundred, all
told, of the number of wounded, havo
died, making the total number of
deaths in the neighborhood of 150. The
remainder of the wounded will probably
recover. Considering the fact that not
over 12,000 men were engaged on our
side and that not all of those were ac
tually under fire the percentage of loss
is very heavy. The slaughter was
brought about mainly by the gallantry
with which our troops advanced into
the open ground in the face of a heavy
fire from the Spanish intrenchments
and rifle pits.
Our men generally had an opinion
that the Spaniards could not shoot and
many, it must be confessed, thought
they would not fight. Both impressions
were erroneous, particularly the latter.
The Spanish have fought with great
determination and bravery. The re
turns show that a number of regiments
suffered very heavily, the Seventy-first
New York being the worst cut up of the
volunteer regiments, and the Thirteenth
and Sixth regular infantry among the
regulars, with the Seventh and Six
teenth Infantry close in the race for
glory.
In some companies of the Thirteenth
Regiment, one-third of the men are
pone, and there are companies in that
regiment now entirely without officers.
In the Sixth Infantry more than one
third of the officers are gone, only one
field officer. Major Minor, being left.
The following is the Hat of non-com
missioned officers and privates killed in
the Seventy-first of New York:

FELL AT THE STORMING OF SAN JUAN HEIGHTS.
Lieutenant Jules Garesche Ord, who was killed at the storming of San
Juan Heights last Friday, was one of the promising young officers of the
army. Although born in Michigan, a good part of his life was passed
in California. He was the youngest son of the late Major General E. O.
C. Ord, one of the great corps commanders on the Union side in the War
of the Rebellion. He entered the service at Angel Island, enlisting as priv
ate In the First Infantry, In 1887; he was soon made quartermaster ser
geant and three years later was commissioned second lieutenant and as
signed for duty to the Eighteenth Infantry. Last year he was promoted
to first lieutenant and transferred to the Sixth Infantry. He was a most
lovable character and extremely popular with both officers and men. At
the time of his death he was serving as aid to Brigadier General Haw
kins.
WILL NOT
SEEK PEACE
AT PRESENT
MADRID, July s.â The Cabinet Coun
cil to-night, after a short session, de
cided not to open negotiations for
peace, but to continue the war with all
risks while a single soldier remains in
Cuba.
The Government has no news as to a
bombardment of Santiago and has ca
bled Governor General Blanco for de
tails of the naval battle.
LONDON, July 6.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standard says: The
public is still in favor of prolonged re
sistance, but excitement is increasing
among all classes and strong precau
tions are being taken in all the large
towns where the garrisons are con
fined to the barracks.
The Daily Chronicle this morning
says: We learn from a sure source
that the Spanish Government thinks it
impossible to make peace now, because
to make peace at present would throw
the balance of power in Spain into the
hands of the Carlists.
The Rome correspondent of the Dally
Chronicle says: The Pope, it is rum
ored, has telegraphed the Queen Re
gent, begging her not to compromise
FUSION TICKET
WINS THE DAY
The Fusion party took the Populist
plum last night at the first meeting of the
county convention, and their ticket of
delegates to the People's Party State Con
vention and the State Central Committee
â were elected.
Early in the evening the County Com
mittee of the Populists resolved itself in
to a county convention for the nomina
tion of delegates to the State convention
at Sacramento next week. E. A. Street,
nominated by T. V. Cator, was elected
chairman. A. L. Holder was elected sec
retary over George A. Clough by a vote
of 43 to 32. Then the business of the
evening -began, which seemed unending.
Cator moved that a committee of seven
on resolutions and a committee of three
on order of business be appointed, and
that no business be done during the ab
sence of the committee, except nomina
tion of delegates. The motion was carried
and the committees appointed are as fol
lows:
Committee on resolutionsâ T. V. Cator,
T. L. Porter, Dr. Grlswold, J. A. Johnson,
Dr. Cleveland, J. C. Gore and J. D.
Thompson.
Committee on order of business â W. J.
Greer, R. H. O'Hea and William Christie.
T. V. Cator read a list of platform reso
lutions, the work of the committee on re
solutions, which should guide the actions
df the delegates elected to" the. State con
vention. He recited the principles of Pop
ulism and urged all not to swerve a jot
from them in the work of the conven
tion at Sacramento. Fusion was depre
cated, and it was suggested that a pledge
be given to each delegate who is to at
tend the State convention. The resolu
tions were unanimously passed.
It was then moved by Cator that each
ticket be placed in nomination. This was
carried. Cator and George D. Gillespie
were allowed to appoint tellers. Cator se
lected W. J. Greer and C. Johnson, Gil
lespie appointed G. A. Clough and E.
Kinne.
The prosaic routine of the convention
received a severe electric shock when a
young boy with blushing cheek came to
the ballot-box to cast a vote when the
name of E. D. Vorath was called. He was
just in the act of dropping the ballot into
the box when B. G. Haskell arose and in
a frenzied and withering outburst charged
the culprit with the heinous crime of im
personation for the purpose of colossal
stuffing. Haskell openly arraigned a Mr.
Ryfkogel, one of the members of the con
vention, as being the moving cause of this
attempt to swell the ballots in his sec
tion of the party. A move was made to
discover what ticket the bold, bad boy
had in his hand, but Cator, with a wave
of his hand and a fine dignity disparaged
such action. The boy was ignominiously
ejected and a serene harmony restored.
Nothing was done to Ryfkogel, though
the altitude of Haskell's voice was ter-
rible.
The two tickets were balloted on and
I the future of the monarchy by refus
ing to treat for peace "which after the
heroism displayed by the Spanish navy,
could not be other than honorable."
At the same time, the Pope cabled
President McKinley â so it is rumored â
appealing to American generosity
toward "an unfortunate but chivalrous
enemy." The Italian Foreign Office,
however, discredits such rumors and
denies that the powers have taken any
action.
ROME, July 5. â There have been sev
eral conferences during the past few
days between Cardinal Rampolla, the
Papal becretary of State, and Monsig
nor Merry del Val, Spanish Embassa
dor to the Vatican. The Italia assumes
that Spain may again intend to ask the
Pope to intervene in behalf of peace.
PARIS, July s.â The Temps this
afternoon publishes an article headed
"Peace Is Necessary," in the course of
which it says: "Perhaps the only serv
ice which Senor Sagasta can now ren
der to Spain, his party, liberalism and
himself, is to open negotiations for
peace. There has been enough blood
shed and destruction of ships, forts and
lives. If the Spanish honor is not now
satisfied when, in the name of Heaven
will it be?"
the five receiving the most ballots were
elected as delegates to the State Central
Committee. They were: George D. Gilles
pie, A. B. Kinne, George A. Clough, Hen
ry Huppert. J. W. Reay.
The following fusion ticket won by a
vote of 41 to 39 and the twenty-nine dele
p.ites to the convention now are: George

eenth biennial convention. The hall was
elaborately decorated in the colors of the

Kaiser's empire.
This organization has a membership of
nearly 4000. Its motto is, "A Strong Mind
and a Strong Body," and in pursuance of
this it trains the child both physically and
mentally until the child becomes a man.
Many important questions will be taken
up at .this convention, chief among which
will be the remodeling of the constitution
The old one has been declared ambiguous
and has been the cause of many bittpr
controversies. uw.er
The forenoon session was chiefly de
voted to organization. Speaker Henry
Brusan called the convention to order and
urged the members to get down to busi
ness as soon as possible. Delegate Wort
mann of Pittsburg was elected temporary
chairman and H. J. Hortlich temporary
secretary. The chairman then appointed
a committee on credentials.
At tho opening of the afternoon session
the following officers were elected- First

entirely in German.
In the evening the delegates were the
guests of the Elntracht Verein at its hall
on Twelfth street. The main hall was lav
ishly decorated with American and Ger
man flags. Adolph Becker, president of
the Eintracht Verein, welcomed the vis
itors, after which the night's fun began.
The first thing on the programme was the
well-known pantomime, "The White
Statue," which was rendered in good style
by members of the Verein. This was fol
lowed by dancing, after which all ad
journed to a bountiful cold collation in
the gymnasium rooms. Dancing was then
resumed and continued until daylight be
gan to stream in through the windows.
REQUEST
OF CONSULS
IS REFUSED
Th>e United States Cannot
- Protect Foreigners at
Santiago. !
Linares Has Not Yet Replied to
Sl)after's Second Demand for
the Surrender of the City^ â 
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
IN THE ADVANCE OF THE
AMERICAN LINES, SEVEN MILES
SOUTH OF SANTIAGO, July 4 (via
Port Antonio, Jamaica, July 5, per the
Associated Press dispatch boat Cynthia
11, via Kingston, Jamaica, July s).â At
noon yesterday, acting under instruc
tions from Washington, Major General
Shafter, commander of the troops, sent
a letter to General Linares, in com
mand of the Spanish forces defending
Santiago, demanding the surrender of
the city. The message was delivered
by Colonel Dorst. Three hours elapsed
before the firing could be . stopped.
General Linares responded promptly
with an absolute refusal to surrender.
General Shafter at noon to-day re
peated his demand for the surrender of
the city and notified General Linares
that unless Santiago surrendered hos
tilities would be resumed at noon on
Tuesday. Up to this evening General
Linares has not replied to the second
request for the surrender of the city.
Conferences with Consuls of the for
eign powers have been conducted near
General Wheeler's headquarters. The
Consuls said there were 31,000 men,
women and children, foreign subjects,
in the city, and they requested a ces
sation of hostilities in order to enable
them to be removed outside Santiago
and to be placed under the protection
of the United States. This was defi
nitely refused by the American com
mander, who declined to accept any
such responsibility. The Consuls were
told that it rested with them to insist
upon General Linares' surrender.
The conference was resumed at 9
o'clock this morning, when the Con
suls expressed grave doubts as to Gen
eral Lhiares surrendering, on account
of the false telegrams in regard to
Spanish victories and yellow fever
among the American troops sent daily
to Madrid, which caused the Spaniards
to think they dare not surrender and
return to Spain.
However, the foreign Consuls will de
mand the surrender of the city, but it
is doubtful whether they will prevail.
All the negotiations are submitted di
rect to Washington, thus causing some
delay. General Wheeler telephones to
General Shafter and the latter, over
the military line from his tent to the
cable station at Guantanamo Bay, com
municates direct with Washington.
A courier of the Associated Press at
4 this afternoon said no conclusions
had been reached.
General Shafter denies the existence
of a general armistice under the white
flap, and it is believed hostilities will
commence on Tuesday at 12 o'clock,
before which time the exodus of the
31,000 foreigners will be accomplished.
The British warships Pallas and Alert
and the Austrian warship Maria Teresa
have been allowed by Rear Admiral
Sampson to enter the harbor of Santi
ago and remove foreign subjects. One
British vessel has already cleared for
Kingston, Jamaica.
The Spanish armored cruiser Cristo
bal Colon has listed on her beam ends
on the rocks, and it is now practically
impossible to save her.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, July s.â The
British warships Pallas and Alert have
left here for Santiago de Cuba in
order to bring away British subjects
who are desirous of leaving that city.
NEW YORK, July s.â The central ca
ble office of the Western Union Tele
graph Company at 11:30 this morning
issued a notice to the effect that its
cable operators at Santiago de Cuba
have gone on board the British gun
boat.

plans agreed upon by General Shatter
and the Cuban commander several
days ago. It was feared by both gen
erals that the Cubans under Garcia
would be unable to prevent General
Par.do forcing his way into the city,
owing to superior numbers. But Gen
eral Shatter believed Garcia would be
able to hold Pando in check long
enough to enable the American forces
to the east of the city to gain material
advantages.
From the news brought here by tne
refugees I am unable as yet to give
particulars of the fight at Dob Palmas
between the Cubans and Pando'a men.
All that Is known is that Garcia's band,
although outnumbered two to one,
made a bold stand against the advanc
ing Spaniards and contested the way
for a considerable distance. The Span
iards finally broke through the Cuban
lines, however, and pressed on toward
Santiago, effecting an entrance to the
city from the west.
General Pando was at the head of
hi* troops in the fight with the Cubans.
He passed along the line often, seek
ing to encourage the men at those
points where the fighting was fiercest.
His men were discouraged when he fell
to the ground, suffering from a wound
In hla arm. but they quickly rallied
and forced their way through the Cu
ban columns.
General Pando is the third conspic
uous Spanish leader to fall in battle
since the attack upon Santiago began.

DISEMBARKING THE TROOPS FROM THE PEKING, AUSTRALIA AND SYDNEY IN MANILA BAY. THE LANDING WAS MADE NEAR THE OLD

BATTLE FOUGHT
NEAR MANILA
Augusti Ventures From
the City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 5.â A special from
Manila dated July 2 says Captain Gen
' eral Augusti made a sortie for the pur
j pose of repairing the aqueduct which
j supplies the walled city and in an en
| deavor to communicate with General
Monet. The insurgents concentrated
' thtir troops and opposed the sortie,
forcing the Spanish commander to re
! turn to Manila. The insurgents are
said to have suffered severe losses and
the Spaniards are reported to have had
50 men killed and 150 wounded.
MADRID, July s.â The Spanish Con
', sul at Singapore wires the following
message from General Augusti, cap
tain general of the Philippines:
"The situation is unchanged. My fam
ily has succeeded in miraculously es
! caplng from Maeabora in a boat, and,
! having passed through the American
: vessels, all arrived safely at Manila.
"General Monet's column is besieged
and attacked at Maeabora."
There is much comment here over the
news of the departure of the foreign
warships from Manila at the moment
of the arrival there of the American
reinforcements. Only two German, two
French and four British warships now
remain, and people are asking if inter
national politics have undergone a
change, and if the Americans are to
be given a free hand In the Philippine
Islands.
The news received here that the Brit
ish Consul at Hongkong has sent a dis
patch-boat to Manila for the purpose
of informing Rear Admiral Dewey of
the fact that Admiral Camara's squad
i run has traversed the Suez Canal is
1 much commented upon, and the news
j papers assert that the Egyptian and
English authorities purposely placed
obstacles in the way of Admiral Ca
mara's departure in order to delay his
arrival at Manila as long as possible,
adding that the British have more
scruples in maintaining 1 the neutrality
of the Suez Canal than they had when
j they allowed a steamer to leave Hong
i kong leaded with arms for Manila in
: surgents.
WASHINGTON, July s.â As yet the
i State Department has received no con
1 firmation of the statement which
I reaches here from London, that upon
; the arrival at Manila of the American
i land forces, several warships of Ger
many and other European powers
which had been there for some time,
left immediately for other ports. In
official circles, however, the announce
ment is regarded as authentic.
It is pointed out that the only possi
ble pretext under which forces from
foreign men-of-war could have been
landed in Manila would have been the
protection of the lives or interests of
their own countrymen resident there.
State Department officials say that
with the arrival of the American re
inforcements for Admiral Dewey the
1 danger that foreigners In Manila would
i suffer was eliminated from the situation
and that a large number of warships
probably left, merely because their
presence was no longer necessary.
NAVASSA HELD
BY INVADERS
Haytian Band Lowers
Our Flag.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BALTIMORE, July 5.â A special cable
dispatch to the Sun to-day from Kings
ton. Jamaica, says: "The captain of
the schooner Eastern Queen, six days
out from Inagua, reports having called
at Navassa Island to take off the tools
and stores of the American company
which owns the property. He found
the island occupied by a band of Hay
tians who prevented his landing by
threatening to shoot any person setting
foot ashore. They said the island had
been deserted by Americans and was
now in their possession.
"John S. Fowler, president of the
phosphate company which owns the
island, said to-day:
" 'We have not abandoned Navassa,
and when we had to withdraw our
workmen we left the United States flag
flying. All the property on the island
belongs to us. We have notified the
State Department of the reported oc
cupany of the island. Our agent in the
West Indies, who is located at Port au
Prince, Hayti, had arranged with the
administration of the Ha-tian navy to
remove our property. The Haytlans
claimed this island once before, but the
ruling of the State Department, when
Lewis Cass was at its head, decided
their claim out of order and respect has
since been accorded our claim to pos
session.
'" 'We hold the United States Govern
ment responsible for loss, if any may
occur to our property, as the island is
under the United States fiag and only
United States laws apply to its gov
ernment and the discipline ot our em
ployes.
" 'We would continue working the de
posits if we could get ships to load
there. Only this has stopped the busi
ness of exporting and consequently en
tails a loss upon us.' "
PANIC AND
STARVATION
Terrible Situation at
Santiago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 5.â A message
received from General Shafter indi
cates that the situation of the people
of Santiago is terrible. They are not
only panic stricken over the fear of
bombardment, but they are suffering
from lack of the actual necessities of
life. In one of the cable messages.
General Shafter says:
"The town (Santiago) is In a terrible
condition as to food. The people are
starving. Rice is practically the only
staple article of food they have."
Further alunÃ in the same dispatch
Shafter says that the growing food
crops in the vicinity of the city have
already been utilized by the residents
of the city, and that the only growing
articles of food left are a few man
groves.
Speaking of the troops under his
command, General Shatter says:
"The men are in good spirits and re
markably well."
In the course of another dispatch
General Shafter, referring to the con
dition of those injured, says:
"All the wounded are doing singular
ly well, only one death having oc
curred since the battle."
A private telegram from General
Sumner, formerly colonel of the Sixth
Cavalry, stationed at Fort Meyer, Va.,
near this city, says:
"All Fort Meyer officers are safe and
well."
The glad tidings received from both
General Shafter and General Sumner
concerning the condition of the troops,
and particularly the wounded; will be
received with joy in all parts of the
country.
General Shatter's statement of the
situation at Santiago is borne out by
the condition of the men captured by
the American fleet from the vessels of
Cervera's squadron. They had been on
half rations so long that many of them
were nearly famished, and if they had
not been taught that capture by the
Americans meant death, they would
have welcomed it, because it insured
them good food and plenty of it.
It is learned authoritatively that tre
mendous pressure is being brought to
bear upon the Spanish commander of
Santiago by the foreign Consuls resi
dent in the city to induce him, in the
interests of humanity, to surrender to
the inevitable. The Consuls have com
municated with their Governments
and it is believed here that representa
tions will be made by them to Spain to
induce her to permit the city to sur
render, thereby preventing further loss
of life and property. What the result
of these negotiations may be cannot be
foretold. The opinion is that the Span
iards will fight to the last, and capitu
late only when they are forced to do
so. For that reason any delay of of
fensive action against the city is not
regarded in army circles with favor.
MANY MURDERS AND
DISASTERS AT ST. LOUIS
Fearful Becord of the Glorious Founh. !
as Made in Missouri's
Metropolis.
ST. LOUIS. July o.â Three murders, a I
probably fatal shooting and a death by
burning Is the record for July 4 in St.
Louis. Fred Loos, a huckster, was stab- j
bed to death, and a companion, named â 
Coombs, so seriously cut he cannot live.
A party of men were shooting clay
pigeons on Loos 1 farm near the city yes
terday. Loos returned home from cele
brating, accompanied by Coombs, and re
monstrated with the sportsmen. A light
ensued, resulting in Loos' death.
S. W. Mann, a street car conductor, was
shot and killed while on his car by an
unknown negro, who escaped.
Prank T. Sassc, a bicycle rider, was
shot through the heart and killed in
stantly while wheeling on Locust street.
The man who fired the shot escaped.
Fannie Hittler. a little girl, set fire to
her dress while exploding firecrackers and
was burned to death.
Ed Mlddleton, a negro, was shot in the
neck and will die. The shooting was the
result of an old grudge.
SPANISH SHIPS
TO BE RAISED
BY WRECKERS
Sampson Reports Tfyat Several
of the Enemy's Vessels Can
Be Recovered.
NEW YORK, July 5.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
"I think it may be practicable to raise the Cristobal Colon and pos
sibly one or two other ships." This is the reply made by Rear Ad
miral Sampson to Secretary Long's cablegram of yesterday inquiring if
it would be possible to float any of the wrecked Spanish men-of-war
and add them to the American navy. Immediately upon its receipt As
sistant Secretary Allen gave consideration to the employment of wreck
ing companies to proceed at once to Santiago and take charge c-f the
work of raising the ships and of removing from them all valuable
equipment.
After a consultation with Judge Advocate General Lemly, Mr. Allen
sent a telegram to Mr. Chapman of the Chapman & Merritt Wrecking
Company of New York, requesting him to come to Washington this
evening and confer with him regarding the raising of the Spanish
men-of-war. Mr. Chapman failed to put in an appearance to-night and
the conference will probably be held to-morrow morning.
Secretary Long and Assistant Secretary Allen propose to exhaust
every effort to recover the Spanish ships. The Cristobal Colon, which
probably can be saved, according to Rear Admiral Sampson, was not
greatly damaged by the gun fire of the American ships. I understand
Rear Admiral Sampson made this statement in his dispatch. He failed
to mention the names c-f the other ships which he thought could be
recovered, but the authorities have no hesitation in stating that the
vessels he refers to cannot be the torpedo-boat destroyers.
Chief Naval Constructor Hiehborn said to me to-day that he thought
there was a probability of raising the Cristobal Colon and all the equip
ment of the other ships.

PROFESSOR SMITH OUSTED

IGNOBED.
Office Held by Mrs. Clement Abol

Opposition to t*Â»*
Gang.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July s.â The City Board
of Education carried out "Boss" Rea's
programme nt the meeting to-night and
formally dismissed Professor Leigh R.
Smith from the vice principalship of
the High School and abolished the of
fice of Deputy Superintendent of
. Schools, held by Mrs. A. B. Clement.
The meeting was largely attended by
those interested in school matters, but
the board never faltered in the work
i cut out for it by the "boss." in spite of
i the strong condemnation that has been
aroused by the board's recent action.
At a meeting of the old board, before
â¢ the new members took their seats, reso-
l utions were read from the Good Gov
! ernment League of Santa Clara County
denouncing the dismissal of Professor
Smith as political trickery. It was
stated the "teachers should be selected
I solely for their fitness and efficiency
I and not as a reward for political fa
1 vors, and, when faithful, should not be
! removed to make place for political fa
'â¢ vorites or as punishment for refusing
to obey the orders of political bosses
and rings."
Resolutions from the Woman's Club
and the Pastors' Union also, asking the
board to reinstate Professor Smith,
were read.
The new board then organized with
E H Wemple as chairman. Trustees

Trustee Graham presented the report
of the classification committee, recom
mending that Professor Leigh Smith be
dropped from the faculty of the High
School and that Charles B. Gleason be
elected in his stead. The report rather
monogrammatically stated that "Prof.

AFRAID OF A

ANXIETY INCREASED BY RUMOR
OF CAMARA'S RETURN.
Now There Is a Pretense of Strength

CADIZ, July 5. â The people are great
ly alarmed at the prospects of bom

who are able to afford it are leaving
town.
This anxiety was particularly notice
able when the news transpired that the
Campana Transatlantic Company re

was afraid to let them go, preferring to
utilize them for coast defenses. The
anxiety of the population and the au
thorities is really serious.
The San Felipe battery Is Just getting
an extension. One hundred meters
have been completed. It has now been
decided to run it out another 100 meters,
placing therein another row of ordi-
nary guns.
The Isla de Luzon is mounting guns
for coast defense and will Join the
coasting gquadron, which Is to be
formed of the converted trans-Atlantic
vessels, the Alfonso XIII, Cludad de
Cadiz and Aletero. Daily practice goes
on with heavy land guns.
Dupuy de Lome has left for Madrid.
He is very reserved and unwilling to
talk, but evidently is seriously appre
hensive, even his ordinary remarks be
ing tinged with no hopefulness. He
held long conferences with Senor Na
jera of a serious character, which was
kept impenetrably secret.

SPANIARDS SPEAK
OF HEAVY LOSSES
AMONG AMERICANS
Special cable to The Call and the Now York
Herald. Copyrighted. IS9B, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MDRID, July 6.â Spaniards to
whom I have spoken say that after all
Santiago is not very important, and
that it is not yet captured. Further they
say the - difficulties of Americans by no
means " have ended, but on the con
trary have only Just commenced; that
Americans have up to now not met any
big force of Spaniards, and that taking
Sanxiago by no means ends the war,
but merely Is a severe blow. The losses
of Americans, both by Spanish bullets
and more still by the Cuban climate,
Is widely commented upon. It Is esti
mated that if the Americans lose 2000
men in taking Santiago, they will lose
five times that number in an attempt
to capture Havana.
First New York Comes* West.
NEW YORK, July s.â Deputy Quar
termaster Colonel Kimball, at the
Army building this morning, received
a telegram from Adjutant General Cor
bin, at Washington, canceling the or

Death of William Carlisle.
NEW YORK, July s.â William Carlisle
died to-day at Vhe home of his father
John G. Carlisle, ex-Secretary of the
Treasury.
Naval Constructor William J. Baxter, IT. S. N., is at present in
charge of the construction and repair department of the United
States Navy Yard at Mare Island, Cal. There is a little more than
ordinary interest attached to this officer of the navy at the present
time in view of the fact that he either repaired or superintended the
fitting out of every ship which now composes Admiral Dewey's fleet
at Manila. He had been on duty at two of the largest navy yards in the
United States before coming to this coast â New York and Norfolk, Va.
At the latter yard he was senior assistant in the building of the Ra
leigh, now in command of Captain Joseph B. Coghlan at Manila. Ho
is one of the brightest and brainiest men in the naval constructor
corps, is only 38 years of age, stands number eleven on the list of
naval constructors, and has about 1000 men under bis immediate su
pervision.
DEBATE ON
ANNEXATION
Hoar Against Territorial
Expansion.
BUT FAVORS TAKiNG HAWAII
HIS SPEECH STYLED BY LIND.
SAY A POETICAL APOLOGY.
Then the Kentuckian Argues Against
the Taking of the SaDdwich
Islands, on Constitutional
Grounds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July s.â The debate
on the Hawaiian resolutions continued
to-day in the Senate. Three speeches
were made. Hoar of Massachusetts
in advocating annexation made a not
able appeal against any policy of gen
eral territorial expansion as a sequence
to the war. Lindsay of Kentucky op
posed the resolutions, directing his at
tack principally against their consti
tutionality. White of California re
sumed his Bpeech In opposition.
Hoar said the sole question so far as it
â was vital was simply whether the United
States would admit into Immediate rela
tionship territory and people already in
a situation that made them a part or the
Union. By a long established policy Ha
waii could not be taken with or with
out the will of the Islanders by any other
power The United States already had
Pearl Harbor and the pending proposi
tion only proposed to make that posses
sion more secure and extend to the peo
ple of Hawaii blessings which we ex
pressly declared they should not secure
from any other great power. He contend
ed annexation would extend the domain
Â° "iijelleve," said Hoar, "that if we come
out of this war without entering on the
fatal folly of retaining far distant posses
sions the world will be so impressed with
our strength that no nation will attack
us for a hundred years."
Hoar was proceeding to discuss the
danger of making the war one of con
ouest and was sounding a warning against
it He spoke of the war being the act of
a great nation, bearing relief to an op
creWd people, in accord with the spirit
of a great nation that was actuated by a
broader humanity than that which re
g^As said Pettus of Ala
bama "does the Senator from Massachu
setts believe this country can take Cuba
a! its own, or does the Senator not think
that the United States is bound in honor
t0 "Tne IJnHed' States." replied Hoar "can
not take Cuba unless it ceases to be the
U He e said t H t would be a crime of the coun
try in the present war to go farther than
the annexation of the Sandwich Islandsâ
a matter Bubstantially decided upon by
the people of the United States long be
fore the war was thought remotely prob
"ThÂ«* starry emblem is no emblem of do
minion." he cried. "In time of peace let
it not fly over conquered territory. It is
the emblem of peace and freedom.'
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky spoke when
Hoar concluded. He complimented the
latter's speech, Paying the country was
well repaid for the prolongation of the
debate to a point where the Massachu
setts Senator spoke. "It was in the nature
of a poetical apology for an act about to
be taken, which, if not unconstitutional,
is certainly extra-constitutional," said
Lindsay, "a"nd it was also a patriotic pro
test against a policy of colonial expan-
Lindsay then proceeded In opposition to
the resolutions. He said that in refue
lng to recognize the Cuban republic and
taking upon ourselves the authority to es
tablish a government in the island, we
would make the Government dependent
upon its creator and ready to turn the
island over to the United States, as it
was now proposed to do with Hawaii.
His argument was directed against the
annexation resolutions on constitutional
grounds.
Lindsay's argument aroused more than
usual interest. At its conclusion White
(D.) of California resumed his speech,
begun many days ago, in opposition to
annexation. He defended the opposition
to annexation against charges of being
unpatriotic, enming from individuals and
the press. White yielded shortly befora
X o'clock, and Davis moved an executive
session.
At 5:14 p. m. the Senate adjourned.

DUNSMUIR, July s.â Fire starting at
2 o'clock this morning in the rear of S.
H. Smith's lodging house destroyed two
entire blocks, crossing th-> street and
burning the railway library building
and section house. The fir* was uncon
trollable, owing to a heavy north wind.
The stationary engine at the machine
shop had no steam up, and the three
water systems were inadequate to sub
due the flames, ""his is the third time
within six months that fire has started
in the same place.
Twenty-five buildings were destroy
ed. Back of the main street the resi
dence portion wa: threatened, but the
wind changed and saved it. The large
carshop building was saved through
the vigilant work of Master Car Builder
Charles Gill, vho had Just arrived from
clearing the wreck near Kennet.
There was an explosion of volatile
material in the drugstore and grocery
store, where were stored tanks of oil
and gasoline. The explosion caused
consternation among the fire fighters
and those trying to escape. Mrs. S. H.
Smith was injured, being badly burned
about the head and arms.
The loss is estimated between $50,000
and $60,000. W. J. Branstetter, the
Dunsmuir Herald, L. Van Fossen,
drugstore, and L. Boylan, dry goods,
are the heaviest losers. The entire loss
Is covered by only $6000 insurance.

REFUNDING
AMENDMENT
Left Hanging- to the
Deficiency Bill.
HOUSE VOTES UPON IT TO-DAY
MINORITY FIGHTS FOR AN EX-
TENDED DEBATE.
Maguire Reads Telegrams From Cali
fornia Protesting Against Delay
in Collecting From Pacific
Roads.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July s.â At the
opening of the House Chaplain Couden
made a feeling reference to the events
at Santiago.
Payne (R.) of New Tork presided In
the absence of Speaker Reed, who was
detained In New Tork.
A bill was passed providing for local
inspection of mates, engineers and pi
lots of ail steam vessels and all barges
in tow of steam vessels, on the great
lakes, and the masters and chief mates
of sail vessels of over 700 tons, and the
bill was amended to permit inspection
of all sail vessels carrying passengers
on application.
The Senate amendments to the bill
for the pay of the army from enroll
ment to the muste.'ng in were con
curred in and the bill now goes to the
President.
The partial conference report on the
general deficiency bill, leaving only the
Pacific Railroad refunding amendment
open, was adopted.
The minority fought for an extended
debate on the excepted amendment.
Maguire (D.) of California asked for
three days, but agreement was reached
for a vote at 4 o'clock to-morrow.
After passing a bill to print 75,000 addi
tional copies of the bankruptcy law, Can
non, chairman of the appropriations com
mittee, opened the debate on the Pacific
railroads. Cannon spoke of the wisdom or
the Senate amendment, and said it wns
the duty now of Congress to secure the
collection of the great amount of indebt
edness due the treasury of the country.
He denied that these roads had. not paid
anything for thirty years. He was not
ready to say whether or not there should
have been better legislation to develop
that great country west of the Missouri
"But " he added, "we find here to-day
this great indebtedness of $r.9.000,000 to the
Government, with $25,000,000 ahead of It as
a first lion on the property, covering a
railroad without terminals."
The atrrpomfnt contemplated in the
amendment, he pointed out. would be
marie under the white light of public criti
cism and there should, therefore, be no
apprehensions as to result*.
Maguire followed in opposition. He said
he favored the existing law against these
companies, and believed there was no rea
son for legislation to complicate the rela
tions existing between the Government
and these Pacific railroads. He asserted
It was proposed to prevent the Govern
ment from dealing with the men who
want to operate it, to prevent the Govern
ment from opening the matter of purchase
to all bidders and confine the Government
through the proposed commission to dick
ering " and negotiations with men who
want to buy it to prrvent competition.
Maguire concluded by reading numerous
telegrams from California protesting
against any extension or delay of the pay-
Barham (TO of California had read an
amendment he will offer to-morrow pro
viding that unless the settlement author
ized is perfected within one year after the
passage of the act the President shall "at
onco proceed to foreclose all liens and se
curities now held by the Govemmc:'
against the companies and to collect that
indebtedness.
Powers *R.> of Vermont, chairman of
the House committee on Pacific railroads,
spoke of the results of the construction of
the lines and paid a tribute to their pro
moters.
The House at 4:57 p. m. adjourned until
to-morrow. _^_______^__ â ..
MANILA TWINE IS
VERY SCARCE AND DEAR
Blockade of the Philippines Threat-
ens to Create a Cordage Dearth
Throughout the World.
NEW YORK, July s.â The World says:
Admiral Dewey's blockade of the Philip
pines threatens to create a cordage dearth
throughout the civilized world. It has
doubled the price of Manila rope and
twine in this country, and by doubling tne
price of Manila hemp has made fortunes
for manufacturers who had large stocks
In reserve.
John Goode, of cordage fame, discussed
the situation at the machine works on
Park and Washington avenues, Brooklyn.
"It will require/ he said, "about luU,
000,000 pounds of Manila twine to bind this
year's wheat crop in the United States.
From the closest estimates we can make
! we find that the present supply of Ma
nila hemp outside of the Philippine
Islands will be exhausted in three months.
"In that event the great Western wheat
farms would soon have no binding ma
terial to use in their reapers and might
have to go back to the old-fashioned
method of binding their sheaves with
straw. This would be a tremendous task
in the fields, which cover miles upon
miles of territory, and might result In the
loss of much of the grain through ex
posure to the weather. Sisal twine, tho
material for which comes from Mexico,
might be substituted In the reapers for
the Manila, but the supply of that is
limited, and would certainly not be suffi
cient to meet the demand. You may gain
some idea of the immensity of the de
mand when I tell you the 150,000,000 pounds
of twine required this year by the farm
ers would cost them about $15,000,000. Since
the war began the price of Manila hemp
has run up from 4 to 8% cents a pound.

BRIGADIER GENERAL. MAR
CUB P. MILLKH, a soldier with
record of gallant service in bat
tle and an artillery officer of ac-
knowledged ability, will probably
command the troops of the fourth ex
pedition to the Philippines. No offi
cial order assigning General Miller to
the command has been promulgated,
but a decision to that effect has been
reached and may be announced in a
day or two.
Definite intelligence was received at
the Presidio yesterday that six troops
of the Fourth United States Cavalry
â¢would be ordered to Join the expedi
tion. The troopers will go whether or
not a ship can be secured to take the
horses. Cavalry soldiers have already
taken a conspicuous part in the fight
ing of the present war. The list of
casualties wired from Santiago con
proof that the dismounted
troopers of General Shafter's army sus
tained heavy losses. The hardest fight
ing is generally done by the regiments
suffering the greatest losses in battle,
and when official reports are in it will
be found that the organizations which
are mentioned in such glowing terms
by the press correspondents have not
sustained losses in battle equal to those
endured by the regiments which had
no newspaper correspondents with
them to record their achievements on
the field.
The st-amers Teru and City of Pu
<pbla will be dispatched from this port
next Monday for Manila. The two
phlps will accommodate 2000 troops and
It was settled yesterday that regulars
would constitute the major part of the
expedition.
Orders Issued from State headquar
ters yesterday announce that Colonel
- Park Henshaw. having been appointed
colonel of the Kiphth California United
States Volunteer Infantry, Is relieved
from duty as Inspector general of rifle
practice to enable him to accept his
commission, and that Lieutenant Col
onel John F. Burgin, A. D. C. on the
staff of Governor Budd, commander-ln

FIT TO BE MUSTERED IN.
Ten Companies of the Eighth
California Prepared and
Qualified to Serve.
CAMP BARRETT, Fruitvale. July 5.â
The routine duties <if camp were resumed
this morning after the two days' com
parative freedom, and were it not for the
feeling of apprehension that has grown
out of the Governor's delay in appoint
ing the line officers of the regiment there
would be nothing- whatever to interfere
with the advancement of the men. But
somehow there is a feeling abroad that
many of the old officers are to be dis
placed by new men, and in consequence
â¢ lerable dissatisfaction exists. In
one, or two companies it is openly assert
ed that if the regular officers are "turned
down" the men will refuse to enter the
volunteer service.
The mustering officer is anxious to com
plete his work, and to-night hv tele
graphed to the War Department that ten
anies were ready to be mustered irj,
and that the other two would undoubted
ly' have men enough by to-morrow to
bring th'-m up to the maximum. He set
forth that the officers had not been ap
pointed yet, and asked if the companies
could I*.- .mustered in without the officers.
If he receives a favorable reply he will
ed with the work to-morrow. This
is likely, however, to create some con
fusion, for the m>n would \>p in the Unit
ed States service, and, therefore, not sub
ject to the orders of thf present offic --rs.
The lirst sergeants would be in command
of the companies and Adjutant Smith ana
Quartermaster Heller, the only two com
missioned officers in the regiment, for
none of the field officers have been mus
ttr*-d in yet.
It is probable, though, that the appoint
ments will all be made to-morrow, thus
avoiding this confusion, for it is under
tnat Governor Hudd has the list
of fortunate ones all made out.
Surgeons Shields, Dudley and Yost did

a big day's work to-day, examining
tne. three remaining companies. All that
remains for them to do now is to inspect
a few men necessary to bring some of
tne companies up to the maximum.
â¢ This will be finished by noon and all
that will remain will be for Captain.
-Murray to administer the oath of alle
jfianrr. and li!! out the rolls. Three hun
dred and forty-four men wÂ«r<- examined
to-day, of whom forty-two were rejected.
Of these Company H of Redding lost
seven out of 113; Company I, Grass Val
ley, seventeen out of 118, and Company
I C, Petaluma, seventeen out of 98 exam
; ined. Captain Barnes' company is way
below the minimum, but Barnes says he
i will have enough more men to-morrow to
i lM i,, the company to the maximum.
! The monotony of camp life was broken
; this evening by a tire which destroyed
tn<- residence of Pearl Lund, the actress.
.Miss Lund lived with her mother at tha
; corner of Putnam street and Wheeler
, avenue, hardly a block from camp. The
I actress accidentally upset a lamp, and in
stantly the house was in a blaze. The
boys rushed over from camp, and long be
fore the Fire Department reached the scene
had succeeded in saving most of the fur
i nlture. They formed a cordon around the
place and guarded the effects from Irre
sponsible parties. They worked djee
beavers, but owing to lack of apparatus
they were unable to save tne building. A
trunk belonging to the actress' mother,
, containing $;!00 and som.Â» valuable clothes,
I could not be passed through a window,
i and the boys were compelled to abandon
it to the flames.
Private John Riley of Company D is in
I the hospital with a badly Bwollen arm,
caused by a spider bite last night. This
morning Riley felt a stinging sensation
j in his right hand when he arose, but
paid no attention to it. Ills hand soon be
| gan to swell, and now his entire arm is
! affected. It is exceedingly painful, and
the surgeons fear that blood poisoning
, will set in. Several large field spiders
have been found in the tents, and Surgeon
Shields says their bite is quite venomous.
The condition of Private Evans, who
i waa injured Saturday by striking hi-;
I head while diving, has shown no Impi'ovp
. merit to-day, and the surgeons are some
. what worried. They can find no trace of
: fracture, but the paralysis of thÂ» body

There is a milkman out here who is
preparing for a violent death at the hands
of the soldiers unless he mends his ways.
He has procured a bugle, and at 1 o'clock
this morning drove around the borders of
the camp hounding the reveille. The
boys were more than disgusted wh'jntlity

lieutenant Colonel Carr'.ngron is mak
ing rapid progress with the organization
iof the regimental band. Nearly all the
i musicians have been enlisted and esti
n.ans have been received of the cost of
j instruments. Several towns which sent
i companies to the regiment have signified
I a willingness to subscribe liberally toward
purchasing th*Â» instruments, and in a few
1 clays Colonel Carrington will have the
l;ti.o completed and in active lehearsal.
Colonel Henshaw has not yet selected
a regimental chaplain, which appoint
ment' Governor Budd inconsiderately left
in his hands, and he is beseiged by appli
cants for the position of every denomina-
I tion. The chances are that the Eighth
will not have a chaplain until the regi
\ ment is completely organized.
TROOPS TO SAIL MONDAY.
The Transport Steamers City of
Puebla end Peru Nearly
Ready to Depart.
Owing to a shortage of steamers at
present the next Manilla expedition will
consist of only two ships, instead of six,
as was first contemplated. These steam
ers the City of Puebla and the Peru,
which will sail on Monday or Tuesday of
next week. They are both nearly ready
for the reception of troops and by Satur
day Colonel P.aldwin will have all the
commissary stores on board.
Major General Otis was engaged yes
terday for some time in figuring out what
troops can best be sent to Manila on this
expedition. It is generally understood
; that among those that are to go are six
troops of thr Fourth United States Cay
; alry, the independent troop of Nevada
; cavalry, and two batteries of the Sixth
I United States Artillery, which recently
arrived from the East and are at Camp
Miller. The commanders of these cavalry
and artillery battalions have been in
structed to have their men In readiness
for the next expedition and are expecting
a formal order any day.
Owing to the limited capacity of the
ships it Is doubtful whether any full regi
mental organization will be taken. The
rest of this expedition will very likely be
made up of battalions of the Fourteenth
Eighteenth and Twenty-third regiments
of , regulars remaining at Camp Merritt
and Major Weisenberger's battalion of
four companies of the Washington volun
teers at the Presidio, of whom the regular
army officers apeak in the highest terms.
The Pennsylvania, the sister ship of the
Indiana has been inspected and recom
menced for charter, and she will undoubt
edly be accepted as a transport. The Rio
Janeiro has also been recommended, and
will probably be accepted. A reply to
these recommendations, which have been
forwarded to the War Department is ex
pected at any ho VF , from Washington.

and found suitable for the transportation

SINGULAR STATEMENT.
Prom Mrs. Rank to Mrs. Pinkham.
The following letter to Mrs. Pink-
ham from Mrs. M. Kaxk, No. 2.354
East Susquehanna Aye., Philadelphia,
Pa., is a remarkable statement of re-
lief from utter discouragement. She
says:
" I never can find vrords with which
to thank you for what Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has done
for me.
" Some years ago I had womb trouble
and doctored for a long time, not see-
ing any improvement. At times I
would feel well enough, and other
times was miserable. So it went on
until last October, I felt something
terrible creeping over me, I knew not
what, but kept getting worse. I can
hardly explain my feelings at that
time. I was so depressed in spirits
that I did not wish to live, although I
had everything to live for. Had hys-
teria, was very nervous; could not
6leep and was not safe to be left
alone.
" Indeed, I thought I would lose my
mind. No one knows what I endured.
" 1 continued this way until the last
of February, when I saw in a paper a
testimonial of a lady whose ease was
similar to mine, and who had been
cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta-
ble Compound. I determined to try it,
and felt better after the first dose. I
continued taking it, and to-day am a.
well woman, and can say from my
heart, ' l^iank God for such a medi-
cine.'"
Mrs. Pinkham invites all suffering
Women to write to her at Lvnn, Mass

THE KING-PIN CORRESPONDENT.
THERE is an old saying that the king can do
no wrong. Yet kings have been known to err.
On the same principle, an "editor-in-chief is
theoretically above the danger of sinning, especially
when he owns the papers in which his unexpurgated
effusions appear. Notwithstanding this, when the
editor becomes correspondent, rushes to the battle
front, where, in the manner of "da monk," he paints
himself yellow, and climbs a conspicuous pole, there
are those who consider him subject to criticism, pos
sibly not all of a commendatory sort.
It is but fair to say that Hearst Is sending extra
ordinary stuff from Cuba. That some of it is inco
herent is not surprising. When an editor-in-chief
has not only the responsibility for a pair of freak
journals, but must also direct the movements of the
army and navy, it is natural to assume that he is
pressed for time. A recent letter of his portrays
with an apparent awe the characteristics of one Lame,
who, when not engaged in bathing in warm Spanish
blood, is on the staff of Hearst.
Lame had been telling Hearst how he had cap
tured forty Spaniards. So far as made clear, he had
done this unaided save by the power of hypnotism.
"His eye flashed," adds Hearst. Possibly it was "in
his eye" that he performed the capture.
"What did you do with them?" Hearst asked, nat
urally feeling an interest. Then he "sniffed con
temptuously," Lame did, and replied: "We cut their
heads off, of course." Lame spoke modestly in the
plural. The pronoun may have been used in the
editorial sense, or perhaps referred to himself and his
little machete. Then Hearst explains that behind
this "armor of vengeance" Lame is "tender and gen
tle." yet admits that Lame is lost "in almost savage
enjoyment" of the situation. Well, perhaps savage
is too strong a term. Let us regard the sanguinary
Lame as unkind, also a liar, and let it go at that.
Hearst ought not to tear up the country this way.
The picture of his staff associates cutting off the
heads of Spanish prisoners at space rates gives a
new and distressing idea as to the duties of a corre
spondent. By getting under the influence of Lame
perhaps Hearst himself will in time learn to slaughter
Spanish and sniff contemptuously when the trifling
affair happens to be mentioned. Up to date, how
ever, he has satisfied himself by reveling in the slaugh
ter of English as she is wrote.
ThjE PARIS EXPOSITION.
DESPITE the war and its glorious victories, the
attention of the people and of Congress has not
been turned wholly away from the enterprises
of peace. The splendid proportions reached by our
export trade during the year have aroused the in
dustrial and commercial instincts of the people almost
as strongly as the fighting spirit has been aroused by
battle, and as a consequence everything that can in
any way affect and promote our growing trade is
receiving consideration from all classes.
One of the movements which has been quickened
into a stronger vitality by the commercial success
of the year is the proposed display of the products
of the United States at Paris in 1900. The Con
gressional conference committee reported in favor
of an appropriation of $600,000 for the enterprise, and
the only objection thus far made to the report is that
the sum is not sufficient. It is pointed out that
France devoted $750,000 for her display at Chicago
and the argument is made that as we are richer and
larger than France and have more to display we
ought to exceed her appropriation rather than fall
below it.
Thomas W. Cridlcr, Assistant Secretary of State,
who, since the death of Moses P. Handy, has been
acting as special commissioner and attending to our
interests at the exposition, recently reported that the
space allotted by the exposition authorities to the
United States includes: In the Hall of General Man
ufactures and Household Furnishing, 24,390 square
feet: in the Mines and Metallurgy, 7690 square feet;
in Threads, Textiles and Wearing Apparel, 13,003
square feet: in Agricultural and Fruit Products, 18,
Â£lB square feet; in Education and Liberal Arts, 11,471
square feet, and in Chemical Industry, 5160 square
feet.
This is not an extensrve space when the vast re
sources of the United States are considered. Cali
fornia'alone could fill the area allotted for mines and
metallurgy and for fruit products. If we are to ob
tain more, however, we must get in and work for it.
The whole world is pressing for space and nothing
Bill, be granted us for sentiment alone.
The article by Mrs. Alice Rix, entitled "The Curse
of the Camp," which was advertised to appear in
The Call last Sunday, was at the last moment held
out .because the evil to which it was designed to call
attention was found to have been eliminated from the
camp. The object of the article was to bring about
a reform, and as the proper officials have now taken
steps to accomplish that reform the publication of
the story was no longer necessary.
N6body can blame the Spanish for blowing up
their ships. The enemy seems to be doing well
enough to be able to get along without being pre
sented with a fleet.
Even Spanish skill in mendacity can hardly lend to
recent events at Santiago that sad but "glorious"
aspect the Castilian has a faculty for discerning.
There is an Admiral Dewey in the Philippines who
has done a few things himself, but who will be among
the first to send congratulations to Sampson.
Now, as to exchanging Hobson, there is plenty of
material on hand to justify entering upon a dicker;
THE SLAUGHTER OF OFFICERS.
ONE of the'most notable features of the reports
of the fighting around Santiago is the large
proportion of officers whose names appear in
the lists of killed or wounded. The number is alto
gether out of proportion to the ratio of officers and
privates engaged in the conflicts, and to the casual
ties usual in battle. The fact is a striking one, and
cannot have failed to impress every one who read the
lists with careful attention.
The first conclusion drawn from a consideration of
the subject will be that this large proportion of cas
ualties among the officers is an evidence of the cour
age and valor of the company and regimental leaders
of our armies. This conclusion, however, does not
accord with all the facts in the case. It is true the
officers are brave and that they led their men into
action with daring gallantry, but it is equally true
the privates are brave, and that they did not have
to be urged on by their leaders. The men with
muskets went to the front as swiftly as the men with
swords and shoulder straps. They penetrated the
thickets, scaled the heights and entered the intrench
ments of the foe as soon as their officers; and, there
fore, so far as courage is concerned the proportion
of death and wounds among them should have been
e^ual to that among the officers.
The truer explanation seems to be that the Spanish
sharpshooters selected the officers to fire at and aimed
to kill as many of them as possible. Such tactics
have been adopted by sharpshooters in all wars, and
if in the present one their success has been more
marked than in former conflicts it is probably due to
the superiority of the modern rifle. War is, in fact,
becoming a matter of scientific accutacy in the fight
ing- line, as well as in the councils of the generals.
With the arms of to-day the rifleman who keeps cool
in action has a very good chance to hit the man he
aims at. There is less indiscriminate firing and more
straight shooting than there was.
If this view of the case be correct, it is evident the
line officers in future battles are not going to hold
very enviable positions. For years past there has
been a tendency among military nations to diminish
the number of officers in a regiment as compared
with the number of men. After every great war
there has been something like a reorganization of
armies and with each change the comparative number
of officers has decreased. The tendency is due to
considerations of economy and of life. There is
no use paying a larger number of officers than the
service of modern war requires, and there is no use
making a man conspicuous on the battle-field simply
to provide a target for sharpshooters.
REVENUE LAW PROBLEMS.
ACCORDING to the tone of the discussion that
has followed the enactment of the war revenue
bill the measure will require considerable ex
planation and interpretation by the courts or the
treasury authorities before it is fully understood in
its application to the complex business of the coun
try. Some interesting problems have already arisen
in connection with it, and others will doubtless come
up in a comparatively short time.
A manufacturing company in the East, which oc
casionally loans on collateral security the cash re
served for the payment of its dividends, applied to
the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue for a rul
ing as to whether under such circumstances it would
be subject to the bank tax. The Commissioner de
cided that all companies doing such business must
pay special taxes as banks. The conclusion of the
ruling is thus given by the Chicago Record:
"The amount of the special tax to be paid is re
quired to be estimated upon the amount of capital
used in the business. The fact that any manufacturer,
manufacturing company or firm makes use of its sur
plus and is doing a banking business does not involve
it in special-tax liability estimated upon the entire
amount of its capital used by it in its manufacturing
business. It is held, therefore, that it is not this
amount, but simply the amount of the surplus on
hand for the purpose of making loans, that is to be
taken as a basis for estimating the amount of the
special tax. It is not the average amount loaned
within the year, but the entire amount of surplus on
hand out of which loans may be made."
The question of the incidence of taxation on the
sale of stock and shares has received a good deal of
consideration in the exchanges where such sales
amount to vast sums every business rtay of the year.
The New York Stock Exchange is reported to have
settled for that city who is not to pay the $2 on the
sale of every 100 shares of stock, by declaring that
the payment of the tax by the broker will be regarded
as a violation of the constitution of the stock ex
change. Other exchanges, it is said, will follow this
rule. It may be taken as determined, therefore, that
whatever may have been the intent of the law makers
this is not going to be a tax on brokers or a reve
nue raised out of their profits.
The tax of 1 cent on each $100 of value on the
sales of products or merchandise has created a con
siderable agitation among the wheat and cotton
brokers, and they will have several problems for the
Commissioner to settle. It is held by certain Chi
cago lawyers that the law does not cover grain op
tions: that the tax will not be imposed on sales of
grain for future delivery. The lawyer who gave this
opinion, however, is an attorney for the Chicago
Board of Trade, and his view may not find favor at
Washington.
Counsel for New York clearing houses is reported
to have advised that the tax on promissory notes can
be avoided by the policy pursued during the Civil
War. It appears that during the existence of the
former war tax banks made loans from day to day,
with securities or commodities as collateral, withoitt
the use of a note or contract upon which a stamp
was necessary. These advances were not considered
of the same nature as ordinary loans on promissory
notes.
Frnm these illustrations it will be seen that the
new revenue law is goinc? to give rise to a good many
interrstinp questions. Most of them, perhaps, can be
decided off hand by the Commissioner, but some
of them will certainly find their way to the courts.
Whatever may be its effect on other trades and pro
fessions the tax is not going to diminish the profits
of lawyers.
When the crew of a gunboat surrendered to Dewey
he offered to parole them, and they declined. All
of them were near starvation. They had held out
long after there was any hope for them. Yet they
dared not accept parole, knowing the ungrateful
country for which they fought would have killed them
as traitors. Soldiers and sailors cannot love such a
country. No wonder the yellow emblem of Spain
is tumbling to dust.
Attorney Hogan of Judge Conlan's court seems to
be under the necessity of making an explanation.
His letter to a man for whose arrest a warrant had
been asked has the disagreeable aspect of being an
attempt to promote something not justice.
Americans delight to honor Sampson, but they are
not overlooking a gentleman named Schley, and a
number of captains and fighting crews. There is
honor enough to go around.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 6, 1898.
THE CHIVALRY OF WAR TIME.
AS there is in the thunder of guns and the crash
of battle something to stir the rugged emo
tions, there is another side to war, appealing
to the tenderly human instincts.
That Cervera made a desperate fight neither friend
nor foe will question. He went imo the open to
court death and destruction rather than wait for it to
come to him. Perhaps the thought was in his mind
that there was a possibility of escape. At least there
was the chance to go down with colors flying and the
cannon speaking defiance to the last.
The struggle was hopeless, suicidal. Yet the spec
tacle of the old man fighting his ships heroically,
charging through a force in every way superior, was
a glorious one, and in defeat there was no disgrace.
It is his privilege to hold up his head among men.
He had kept his fleet long afloat ahead of a baffled
pursuer, and when it went down its guns were hot.
The surrender of Cervera was a touching incident.
When he came aboard an American ship he came as
a prisoner, wounded in body and spirit. An Ameri
can officer met him with extended hand, and said:
"I congratulate you, sir, on having made as gallant
a fight as ever man made on sea." Here was chiv
alry. Between these men no personal enmity ex
isted. True courage ever recognizes the same qual
ity in another. One moment they had sought to
kill each other, the next they stood with clasped
hands; and if in the heart of the old man there was
the sore bitterness of defeat, he knew he had done
his best, that the world would give him credit for it.
The soldier fights the soldier; the man recognizes
the man, and so in victor}' is a s generous as in con
flict he is daring.
AN AMERICAN SISTERHOOD.
\A UCH has been said of the practical good ac
/ \ complished by the women of the Red Cross.
* * Much remains to say.
The women have done one thing of which they
did not dream in the beginning. They have spread
to every State and Territory a knowledge of the hos
pitality which California, with themselves as its hon
ored agents, dispenses willingly and gladly to the sol
dier faring within her gates. He may be of the
North, South, East or West, but once here he is an
American, and they minister to him.
A practical result has been the creation of a humane
sisterhood as wide as the land. People at a distance
have caught the inspiration and seek to aid. Women
in far-away States send to express their gratitude
for what has been done for their loved ones so
journing here, where they thought to find strangers
and found friends. Minnesota and Pennsylvania send
fervent thanks. Colorado and Tennessee say to these
women, "God bless you."
The war is welding this great people Into a unity
it never knew. The impulse stirring the nation
meets even-where a response. But when peace shall
come to abide, the student of events will remember
the benign mission of thc?e unselfish women, and
say of them that in the stronger fraternal relations
established, quietly, sweetly and unknowing, they
wrought well, and the strongest fibers in the tie to
bind all sections into one are of their handiwork.
A GOOD CITIZENS' LEAGUE.
r\ CIRCULAR has been issued announcing that
f~\ the second annual convention of the National
* * Good Citizens' League will assemble at Nash
ville July ii. The manifesto of the league declares
"the time has come in the history of our country when
all good citizens should unite to rescue the municipal
ity, the State and the nation from present evils and im
pending disaster and ruin." It further asserts that
while "there are some good men in office, every
department of our life â whether economic, industrial,
social or religiousâ has felt the blighting influences,
the evil effects of unwise and unrighteous civil gov
ernment; incompetency and demagogism on the
one hand, infidelity and corruption on the other."
The language of the manifesto is exaggerated. Evils
exist, but there is certainly no such thing as ruin im
pending over this country. Nor was it wise on the
part of those who issued the call to mix up religion
with politics. It does not appear that religion is to
be affected by misgovernment in either the municipal
ity, the State or the nation; nor is there anything in
the present condition of our people to justify the as
sociation of infidelity and corruption in politics.
There are a good many infidels who are not cor
rupt politicians, and there are a good many corrupt
politicians who are not infidels.
The style of the call, however, is a minor matter.
The essential point is that a league has been organized
for the purpose of inducing good citizens to take a
more active interest in politics. The object of the
league is commendable. Anything which tends to im
press upon all classes of citizens the importance of at
tending to their political duties is of value to the com
munity. It is unquestionably true that much of the
extravagance and corruption in our administration
of public affairs is directly traceable to the neglect
of citizens to take a proper interest in public affairs.
The Good Citizens' League announces itself as a
"non-partisan, non-sectarian body," and all organ
izations interested in political and administrative re
form are requested to send delegates to the conven
tion. The method by which the league proposes to
perform its work is that of arousing the patriotic con
science of the people, so that the individual will feel
it a part of his duty to assist in the eradication of ex
isting evils in every way possible. To effect that it
is designed to organize local leagues, one for each
political party, at all voting precincts.
While the scheme will not appear feasible to many
citizens, it nevertheless will have the sympathies of
all who have noted the indifference of the great mass
of business men to their civic responsibilities. If the
league by its organization or by its influence can in
duce all citizens to be more earnest in the performance
of their political duties we shall have better men nom
inated for office, better men elected and a better ad
ministration of the affairs of the city, the State and
the nation. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the
Nashville convention will be well attended and that
it may exert a widespread influence in the country.
The Spanish in the Ladrones behaved in a gentle
manly way, even refraining from replying to the
American fire. The circumstance that they had no
ammunition also contributed to make the occasion
one marked by forbearance.
Dewey is safe. One of the patent, brass
bound, copper-riveted persons known to yellow jour-
nalism as "special commissioner" has reached him.
Let the fanfare of the battle rend the heavens now.
It is not easy to understand why Captain Glass
should have opened fire when he arrived at the La
drones. Perhaps he was using blank charges so as
to be impressive and yet not unduly violent.
If Cervera shows good judgment he will no more
return to Spain. Perhaps in time he would learn to
be a good American citizen.
Probably Cervera as a prisoner will be surprised to
find himself treated as a gentleman.
HEARST WRITES, BUT
FAILS TO THINK
He Sends a Lot of Idiotic Balderdash
and Has Sufficient Influence to
Get It Printed.
There is a statement so ancient that It commands the respect due old
age: "Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad." Evidently the
gods have put up a job on W. R. Hearst.
Since the opening of the war much misinformation has been sent out of
Cuba, many correspondents have wired ridiculous tales, there have been re
ports so palpably idiotic that they have won only the tribute of a derisive
smile. But from the first to the present nothing so senseless, so reeking
with malign stupidity, so serious an affront to the intelligence of the public,
so pernicious, so babblingly imbecile has been forwarded to this country as
Hearst is himself sending over his own signature. Some day the man will be
accused of being a fool, and the files of his own vile papers will convict him.
The latest Hearst effusion appeared yesterday morning. It is more than
a gem. It is a string of gems radiant with such scintillation as can be
flashed by a mind not diseased, perhaps, but minus the faculty of thought.
Judged by the letter, Hearst ought to be in restraint. An analysis of it is
hardly possible. When a man cumbered by a strait-jacket raves at the
padded wall, the incoherency of his remarks is baffling. Yet the remarks are
fully as lucid as those of Hearst. Maybe the Cuban heat has poached the
brain of the editor-in-chief. Has he no friends loyal enough to kick over his
Inkpot and counsel him not to be an ass?
The letter In question is a rhapsodical exaltation of one Honore Lame,
a Cuban scoundrel, who, according to the facts on -which Hearst bases ex
uberant praise, is a murderer, a robber of the dead, a sneak, and a mon
strosity of perversion. From such a character as Hearst paints yellow,
any man of decent instincts would shrink as from a leper. Yet Hearst ad
mires, slobbers over him, calls him "tender and gentle," makes a fetich of
the villain and a holy show of himself. As a matter of fact, discernible
to any observer of moderate perception, Lame is simply a liar having fun
with an unsophisticated boss.
It was with this precious specimen of moral degeneracy that Hearst
had "hurried to the fort," where he found that James Creelman had been
wounded. Alas! that this should have happened to Truthful Jeems. Upon
his brow had been placed the stinkweed wreath of achievement as the
most stupendous faker who ever uttered and passed a forged statement
as fact. And Hearst, just at the time his sympathy should have been
touched, snatches the wreath away, dividing it between himself and this
Lame.
Hearst tells in a sentence how Lame pitched into the firing line at Ca
ney. Indeed, the inference is fair, that Lame was the firing line. "To
night he returned here," quoth Hearst, "with his handsome face aglow with
enthusiasm." The suspicion is natural, after reading further, that the
glow was due to something else. But why the glow, casting aside, of
course, the unworthy theory that Honore's tank was full? Hearst pro
ceeds to explain:
Among the dead and wounded on the b'attlefleld he had found, by the
Index finger of a Spanish prisoner, the body of the general who had com
manded the forces of the enemy about Caney on the day before.
Amid the tall weeds and wire grass Lame had found the dead bodies of
General Vera del Rey and his brother, and near by, desperately wounded,
two of his three aids, and two other officers dead beside him, and even their
horses and mules killed In the same deadly hail. They were close to a high
cactus fence, behind which they were evidently seeking shelter when caught
by the volley from the American line.
"Abandoned on the field!" cried Lame, triumphantly. "Deserted by his
men of his crack battalion!" he added with fine scorn.
Lame was unaffectedly happy as he held up to our gaze the papers
which he had taken from the pockets of the Spanish commanasr. They
told of Spanish affairs, troops and plans, and were turned over to Gen
eral Garcia. The originals will be saved for the Journal.
Lame beamed with Joy that he felt as he tapped his camera and ex
claimed:"
"I have here a photograph of him Just as the vultures were flying from
his body." Lame is a daring correspondent, always alert to the demands
of his newspaper, but before that â before every other consideration â he is a
Cuban soldier. Of massive frame and classical face, he is a type to com
mand admiration everywhere, but in saddle girth with the trappings of a
trooper he seems to have but ridden directly from the pages of Scott or
Stevens.
Now here is a fine specimen of depravity over which to rave, a truly no
ble hyena ravening on dead men's bones, filching from the pockets of
corpses, rejoicing with the carrion vulture. "A type to command admiration
everywhere." Oh, Willie, Willie, why be a blithering dotard? If your man
rode from the pages of Scott or Stevens let him ride back again, and then
destroy the book.
In portraying a person to admire Hearst has drawn an inhuman wretch
from whom every decent instinct turns with loathing; a bloody, bestial
knave without conscience, principle or heart, a creature for assassinations,
for foul plots, with nowhere in him a redeeming trait. "A type to com
mand admiration!"
But there is a climax still to reach in the Hearstonian drivel. The edi
torial correspondent seems to concentrate his waning intelligence in an ef
fort to reach the climax of lunacy. Continuing about this precious Lame he
says: "Lame has done nothing else but make war for so many months so
that it is his normal existence. He revels in its barbarity. When next he
spoke his eyes lighted with intense interest." Then Hearst continues:
"In the blockhouse where I was with you yesterday," he said, "we found
this morning a few Spaniards. They were popping away, doing some dam
age and giving much trouble. I found a Spanish prisoner and told him to
go to the blockhouse and tell those inside that the Americans were about to
fire a dynamite gun at them and they had better surrender. Forty of them
came out, and the Americans kindly turned them over to me for the Cu
bans."
His eyes flashed.
"And what did you do with them?
""We cut their heads off, of course.**
He sniffed contemptuously.
And yet behind this amour of vengeance, bred in the bone by a century
of suffering, the Cuban is tender and gentle. One seldom finds a man of
more generous and gracious impulses than this same Lame. His hour has
come and he is lost in the almost savage enjoyment of it.
Pardon is asked of readers for quoting so much slaver. It must be
remembered that it was written by the editor-in-chief of two papers. Aside
from the fact that to people who think it can be considered only as the
sign of a disordered mentality, the fact must not be overlooked that such
stuff is dangerous as well as absurd. The rumor printed in sheets ad
mitted to the mails might receive credence among the Spanish. Suppos
ing that this immeasurable liar, Lame, had been instrumental in captur
ing prisoners of war, and had slaughtered them, as he claims to have done.
The natural and proper result would be reprisals. A brave man named
Hobson is now a prisoner of the Spanish. If the Cubans are conducting
themselves as Hearst says they are; if they are butchering prisoners of
war, the most ordinary self-respect would force the Spanish to kill Hob
son and all his associates. They could not be blamed for doing it. Hearst
seems to be trying to force them to this extreme. A tale so weird would
never for a moment deceive anybody familiar with the ways of ocher jour
nalism. It might deceive the enemy.
Hearst appears to be a freak. Not content with running two sheets,
a dual disgrace to the country, he must himself contribute to their unclean
columns a mess of rot so prurient that to offer it to any publisher on earth
but one would be to meet with refusal and rebuke. He cannot, perhaps,
be accused of deliberate malice. The lunatic is not called to strict ac
count. But for the welfare of the nations there should be some
method of protection against the drooling nincompoop who projects himself
into a serious situation, and by his pestiferous presence adds to its difficul
ties. Hearst has written himself a scoundrel, which is bad, or a clown in
motley, which is not to be commended. He is in either case a
dishonor to the craft, and with one accord members of the craft disown
him.
If there were no danger that the Hearst and the Lame would be mis
understood; If there were a pleasing certainty that they would be taken
at their face value, a pair of fatuous dullards, no reason for commenting
on the Joint product of their non-intelligence would exist. As It is, these
prating jobbernowls constitute a danger. It is a pity some method of check
ing them cannot be devised. But when Honore returns from cut ing off
heads, and his handsome face is aglow with pleasure, and Willie bowa
down to worship, and then describes his emotions, there seems no way to
prevent it. The ways of Providence are strange. Good men, in no de
gree addle-pated, are being killed every day.
MERBIMAC AN ILLEGAL OB
STRUCTION.
The other day In a debate in the Cor
tes at Madrid a deputy, who is describes
as of high dignity and repute, solemnly
asked the Duke of Almodovar de Rio, the
Minister of Foreien Affairs, whether it
was regarded in International law as
proper to use such expedients in block
ading a port as to sink ships in the chan
nel or to plant mines. The worthy noble
man as solemnly replied that the authori
ties were agreed that such actions were
Indubitably improper. This is a serious
discovery, but it is difficult to see how
the fault can now be remedied. Of course,
i t J le ,, l iÂ£ lted J? tates has unwittingly of
fended the ethics of warfare in bottling
Admiral Cervera in Santiago harbor it is
greatly to be regretted. The Spanish mil

I GARCIA AND DIETZ EXPLAIN,
SAN FRANCISCO, July 3, IS9B,
City Editor Callâ Dear Sir: In an ar
ticle on page 16 of the Sunday Call, anent
the support given the Red Cross fund
by the retail liquor dealers, an injustice
Is done to the undersigned, and we sin
cerely hope you will correct it. It ia
stated that the committeeman who left
the blanks at the different saloons met
with a chilling reception at Frank Gar
cia's saloon on Montgomery street. That
is untrue. The . saloon referred to Is
owned by Messrs. Frank Garcia ana
Frank Dietz. Both gentleman were out
when the committeeman called. The bar
tender, however, received the blank and
every effort was made by the proprietors
of the saloon and their employes to sw.-ll
the relief fund of the Red- Cross. Botn,
proprietors also subscribed to the fund,
and when the lists were collected. Messrs.
Garcia and Dietz turned over several dol
lars to the committeeman.
The Matt Storn incident is also untruo,
Mr. Storn was in. our saloon when a rep-Â»
resentative of the Salvation Army or
some kindred organization came in and
asked r'6r money. The request was re
fused. Mr. Storn evidently misunder
stood the situation and thought a Red
Cross representative was turned down.
We have subs Tibed to several funds for
the relief of tl- man,
wearing the uniform oT the United State*
army has ever come into uur place but
he received free drinks and lunch. Wq
feel aggrieved that our names should ap
pear in an unfavorable light before the
public, when there is no 'Cause for it, and
we trust that, in a spirit of fairness, y i
will make a correction in the. columns of
your paper. .
The committee of the retail liquor deal
ers who had charge of this matter will
verify the above statement, &s will
'Tesse Marks, who also took an active
part in the movement to help along, the
good cause. Very truly yours,
GARCTA & DIETZ.

Royal is a cream of

SUSPECTED OF ROBBERY.
Peter Georgeault at Present Detained
on a Charge of Vagrancy.
Peter Georgeault was booked at the
City Prison on a charge of vagrancy, but
the police hope to be able to place a
charge of robbery against him.
Early Monday morning Policeman Ca
ples, while on Kearny and Bush streets.
saw three men running down Bush
toward Kearny, and the rear one was
yelling that he had been robbed. They
turned north on Kearny and Caples
chased one of them, while the man robbed
continued in pursuit of the other. Caples
overtook his man, who proved to bo
Georgeault, at Pine street, and after a
r"iiÂ£^i and tumble fight, in which the
officer's left knee was Injured, the hand
cuffs were placed on Georgeault.
The victim caught up with the other
robber and they had a fight, the robber
getting the better of his antagonist, and
making his escape. Caples was too much
interested In his own fight to attend to
the other, and when he had subdued
Georgeault the victim had gone. Now
the police want him to make him.~'-ii
known, and meantime the charge of va
grancy has been entered against George
ault.
Purchasing Soldiers' Shoes.
Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber
! of Commerce, has received a letter from â '

tlon from M. I. Luddington, the quarter
1 master general of the United States army, j
j relative to purchasing the shoes for the [
! first expedition that w^nt to Manila. It
will be remembered that several weeks ;
! ago the large commercial bodies of this j
i city sent a letter to the Pacific Coast
representatives at Washington, in which !
the complaint was made that the price ;
j paid for shoes in the East was greater ;
! than the same kind of goods could be >
I bought for in thiÃ city; that therf- was
d:si rimination against Western dealers, 'â 
! and that the price paid to Wanamaker
was $2 S4 per pair and thy could be ob
tained here for $2 25. Mr. Luddington i
states that there was a mistake, the price '
paid being $2 51 to $2 64 per pair. The j
shoes bought were up to the standard I
requirements and had to be rushed, as
; there was no time for the Pacific manu- .
facturers to make up a sufficient stock.
He disclaimed the implication that there :
has been any dificriminaflon against the
manufacturers of this coast.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 6, 1898.
THAT ELUSIVE
TERRA COTTA
It Still Holds Back the
Hall of Justice.
THE CONTRACTOR EVASIVE
HE IS TROUBLED WITH A VERY
DEFECTIVE MEMORY.
I Supervisors Postpone Action on Sev
eral Franchises Asked For
by the Southern
Pacific.
The Hall of Justice building 1 , on the site
of the old City Hall, will not be ready
for occupancy for many months, or per-
i haps years, unless Bateman Bros., the
: contractors, and the Supervisors, who
awarded them the contract to erect It, are
I made to understand that the Grand
i Jury does not intend countenancing any
further shameful and needless delay. At
a meeting of the Supervisors, held a week
ago, the contractors "believed" thai
"they might" have the building com
) pleied by October 1, and not require any
further extension of time. On that oc
:. it was represented that the delay
ny months was due to the fact that
the contractors could not procure the
necessary terra cotta work. A promise
was made that a contract would be en
tered into within a few days for the
cotta, and that the building would
>eedily completed. How well the
promise of speed has bee-n lived up to
me apparent yesterday at the regu
lar weekly meeting of the Supervisors.
After the reading of the report of the
Committee on Buildings, Mayor Phelan
asked if there bod been any further in
formation from the contractors as to
|wh< n they would complete arrangements
â cure terra cotta.
:-Judjre Sullivan, representing Con
tor Bateman, stated that his client
concluded a contract with Gladding,
lean & Co. to furnish Buch material,
that it would be several weeks be
fore they could begin to deliver the stock.
Contractor Batoman was then called
on for further explanations, but was very
hazy as to dates and agreements, being
confident only of the fact that he Wanted
Extension of time.
Mr. Bateman," said the Mayor,
y propor that you should forthe
' the public and the board make
statement of what you propose
the matter of completing this
building."
Bateman replied that Gladding & Me-
Bean were under heavy bonds to de
liver the terra cotta in a given time, but
would not state the period. He dodged
the question by stating that the delivery
of the material would begin shortly and
that he was doing all he could to push
the work along.
The Mayor was evidently in no pleasant
frame of mind, for he gave Bateman a
rude shock and placed him in a position
where he was obliged to be explicit.
"I have just come from Gladding & Mc-
Bean's," said Mayor Phelan, "and they
infnrmed me that they could not begin
to furnish the terra cotta in le?s than two
months, and that under their contract to
you they were not bound to complete the
delivery until the expiration of five
months. Now is that the case, Mr. Bate
man?"
Bateman finally acknowledged that
such was the contract. After many ex
planations as to the previous delays,
brought out by sharp questioning, he
stated that he thought the Hall of Jus
tice could be completed by the end of this
year.
"Will you guarantee that the building
will be ready by January 1, 1599?" asked
the Mayor.
"No, I could not well do that." stam
mered Bateman, "but we are doing the
best we can and hope to have It done by
that time."
Supervisor Britt stated that the com
mittee had made a thorough investigation
of the facilities for producing the terra
cotta, but were unable to understand just
why there should have been any such de
lay as had occurred.
As a precaution the Mayor ordered Con
tractor Bateman's statement regarding
the completion of the building entered on
the records.
There ends another chapter in the story
of the almost criminal delay in the erec
tion of the Hall of Justice building.
In order that the municipal expenses
Incurred between now and the third Mon
day of September, when the new tax levy
will be made, will be insured the Auditor
and Treasurer were instructed to figure
payments out on a basis of the assess
ment levied last year for the several
funds.
A resolution was passed to print author
izing the Treasurer to pay from the urg
ent necessity fund the claim of Joseph
1 nib. for painting the street corner signs
intended for the accommodation of strang
ers. -
The matter of granting franchises to the
Market street Railway Company to ex
tend certain of its lines so as to reach the
proposed Zoological Garden and the Af
filiated Colleges was laid over for one
week. If street cars are to be run on the
streets included In the franchises asked
for, a provision will be made compelling
the holder to carry policemen, letter car
riers, denntv hoalth officers, deputy street
superintendents and firemen free of
charge when they are in the discharge of
their duties. The franchises will be let
to the highest bidder, but inasmuch as the
lines sought to be traversed would only
benefit the Market Street Railway Com
pany there will not be any other bidders.
The petition of the San Francisco and
SanMateo Railway Company asking for
a franchise along one block on Howard
street and thence along East street to
the new ferry depot was favorably
passed. â¢."â¢â¢"
Mayor Phelan was empowered to sell
the dilapidated â  Cogswell fountain re
moved from the corner of Market and
Drumm streets, and turn the proceeds
Into the treasury for the benefit of the
street fund.
The Mission Athletic. National and
"Western Athletic clubs were granted li
censes to; hold sparring exhibitions next
month on the payment of | the ' necessary
license fee. The Excelsior Club was
granted similar privileges for a contest
this month. The free permits heretofore
granted to the Olympic. Jefferson, West
ern Addition, Alpine, , California, Excel- â ,
sior and Merchants' Athletic clubs were
revoked.
William M. Hinton Jr. was awarded the
contract for printing 2500 copies of tho
municipal reports.
The contract for paving Market street
from Fifth to Taylor street? was award
ed to Flinn & Treacey, on the bid or
$7100 for the work.
An ordinance introduced by Supervisor
Devany, granting the Southern Pacific
Company the right to maintain
and operate a double track on the road
bed now traversed by them from tno
Townsend street depot to the county lint),
was laid over one week for consideraÂ»
tion.
Similar disposal was made of an ordi
nance imposing a quarterly license of $3
on nickel-in-the-slot machines.

ing higher than the prices of spot goods, and
hence an entire absence of inducement to

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July Wall street to-day
offered one of Its most confusing markets to the
outside observer or Inexperienced speculator. |
Tel the opening burst of animation and
strength, the subsequent reaction and the
final conflicting tendency of Individual stocks j
all had their rational motives. At first view
there â ..is every reason to expect a strong and I
well sustained market throughout the day on
account of the glorious achievement of the
United States navy and the Imminence of
capitulation by the Spanish forces in Santiago.
There was a rush to buy at the opening and
bears who had the temerity to remain short
of stocks over the triple holiday scrambled to j
cover. London also bought quite eagerly.
Stocks which had recently been under bear
pressure, notably People's Gas and Sugar and i
the Internationals, showed the sharpest ad- '
vances. But the fact was equally obvious that i
quite a number of stocks which have been
pushed up in face of the recent lethargy were
Buffering from profit taking. After the urgent
demand from the shorts had been satisfied the
profit taking sales dominated largely, reduc
ing all th" earlier advances, and In many cases
carrying prices well below last Friday's close.
The chief sufferers were Brooklyn Transit,
Rock Island and Burlington. Sugar also do
veloped marked weakness before the close. It
Is a measure of great confidence which has
been felt in Admiral Sampson and his fleet
that the actual demolition of the Spanish
Fquadron should have been met with selling
of stocks as an event that had been thoroughly
discounted. It is quite possible that the later
weakness represented in some degree a dampen- j
ing of enthusiasm caused by reports that the j
projected bombardment and reduction of Pan
ttagO were to be postponed. There was I
significance in the fact that the opening of th? '
new fiscal year and the usual large release of
funds were not reflected In any marked degree
for speculation or investment In the stock
market.
This Is Indicative of the continued doubt as '
to the exact effect of the money market which ,
will result from the taking up of. the Govern
ment loan on July 14.
Bonds reflected a more steady demand than
in the stocks and prices were more generally
firm. Total sales, $2.5' 1 0.000.
Closing quotations of Government bonds were
uncharged from Friday.
The total sale* of stocks to-day were 255,400
shares, including: Atchlson. 3220: Atchi'-on Pr<"- i

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, July The Evening Post's
j London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here had a firm opening to-day, but
they became dull later and the rise which had
occurred in Americans was replaced by a fall,
the selling being attributed to New York.
i Interest here now centers more especially in
Kaffirs, and if the public responds to the bait
which Is offered them by the professional wire
pullers Americans may lag behind. At the
same time there is no Inclination to minimize
! the Importance of the American victories.
1 Consols were lower, as also many other
high-class investments, owing to the Issue of
an Indian loan for Â£6,000.000 bearing 2Vi per

The Bank of England to-day sold Â£202,000 in

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July s.â Wheat started weak and
remained in that condition until the end of the
session. Improved crop reports and fine
weather where harvesting is In progress ;
brought out a large line by people who bought
in short last week and were anxious to get out
again. The weakness of Continental Europe
also had some effect. The pressure here came
mainly from local professionals and fit. Louis.
There was a slight rally from bottom prices
near the close on the steady advance at Liv
erpool, which showed an advance of l%Â®4d
over the previous close. Statistics were bull
ish. Exports since Friday were liberal, 1,160, â¢
COO bushels. July closed with a loss of 2c and

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there have been the fol
lowing arrivals of coal: From Washington,
five vessels, with 15,300 tons; six from British
Columbia, 16,134 tons; one from Oregon, 475
tons; three from Australia, 9364; tqns; total,
46,517 tons. The fuel deliveries are fully keep
ing pace with the demand, and stocks in yard
are nut diminishing, although the coaling of
the transport steamers has called freely upon
our surplus during the month of June. There
are thirteen vessels now en route from New
castle and Sydney with about 33,000 tons of
coal, which should arrive this month. If, as is
reported, there will be two more expeditions
forwarded to Manila, this will necessitate the
engagement of seven more transports; when
these shall be coaled there will have been
drawn off our coast nineteen steamers in all.
that will rmiain away two or three months
without using any more of our local fuel. This
in the aggregate means a large amount of coal,
so there are no reasons why there should be
any scarcity for the next few months; at the
same time there Is no likelihood of any de
cline in quotations, as coal freights from all
European ports and from our northern section
are high, wtlh no prospects of any material
softening. With only a one-third crop of
wheat for shipment, we cannot reasonably ex
pect coal carriers to head this way from Aus
tralia and Ergland unless they are well paid
for the service."

PROTEST OF SHIP-OWNERS
OPPOSED TO TWO BRIDGES THAT
ALMOST TOUCH.
The Matter Will Be Fully Laid Ee
fore the War Department Au
thorities Through Major
Heuer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 5.
Ship-owners declare that navigation on
the estuary will be seriously obstructed
should the War Department giVe Alamp<iÂ«
County the privilege of constructine a
bridge on the site of the present con
demned structure at the foot of Webster
street.
The Southern Pacific Company, when j
the subject of bridges was brought for- j
ward Imperatively by the War Depart- j
ment, was first in the field, and while the
county was figuring on tunnels and other
schemes the railroad had its plans accept
ed for a structure at the foot of Harrison
street. The company lost no time in get
ting to work and now its bridge is almost
completed.
The county has sent it? plans to Wash
ington for a new Webster-street bridge,
and it is now discovered that should these
plans be approved, there will be only
about twenty feet between the two draws
when both are open. This condition will
SPANNING THE OAKLAND ESTUARY.
Diagram Showing Open Bridges at Webster and Harrison Streets, When Both Draws Are Open at Once. Each Bridge Is 353 Feet
Long in the Draw, and When Both Are Open They Almost Touch. It is Proposed to Destroy the Present Webster-Street
Bridge and to Establish the County Highway as Far East as Fallon Street. These Questions Will Be Submitted to Major
Heuer, United States Engineers, To-day. The Diagram is Drawn to Scale From the Plan Accompanying the Protest of the
Shipowners.
absolutely prevent sailing vessels from
tacking through the bridges. As a large .
portion of the trade of the estuary con- j
s;sts of achoonerfl, s;rui:g protests have ,
been prepared to the War Department,
giving reasons why the bridges should be j
kept farther apart.
To-morrow morning Major Heuer, the ;
engineer in charge of this district, will
hear protests in this matter at his office
across the bay.
It will be proposed that plans bo submit
ted to the Government for a bridge to
cross the estuary east of Adams wharves,
r.hich will bring the structure to Fallon ,
etreet. As nearly all of the commerce of
the estuary ia transacted west of Lake
Merrltt, the building of a street bridge at >
Fallon street would leave but one bridgeâ j

existence for a long time. Two years ago
his parents separated. His father went
East, and some time later his mother no
tified her husband that flhe had put the
boy on a train to go to his father. De
Pue heard no more of the boy, and as he
did not arrive at his Eastern destination
he came to Oakland and began a search
for the boy. Upon his arrival he was told
that the boy must be lost, and on the
theory that his son had disappeared De
Pue set to work. He was not long in dis
covering that the boy was nover far
away from his mother, and when he had
proved this fact to his own satisfaction
he instituted a suit for divorce and also
tried to recover the lad.
A week ago Judge Ogden decided that
there was some informality in the pro
ceedings to recover the boy, and stated
that he could not interfere pending the
trial of the divorce suit. This evidently
did not suit the father, for he has sworn
out another writ, made returnable to
morrow.
SIX YEARS FOR RODGERS.
Sentence Imposed for the Killing of
E. E. Halsey, by Judge
Ellsworth..
OAKLAND, July s.â Judge Ellsworth
sentenced Stacy Rodgers to San Quentin
for six years this morning for killing E.
E. Halsey in Berkeley on the night of
March 29 last. The Judge stated that he
made the sentence as light as possible, as
he believed that there were certain miti
gating circumstances.
Mr. Rodgers was accompanied by his
brother Leo, who has stood by him man
fully through his trial, his aunt and hl3
attorney, Judge E. M. Gibson When thÂ«
sentence was pronounced Rodgers dropped
his head, his aunt kissed him and the
scene was over. Rodgers and his attor
ney are satisfied with the sentence, be
lieving It a light one, and the prisoner is
anxious to begin his term, although he
will not leave here till Saturday.
FREEHOLDERS' ELECTION.
Oakland's Council Defeats the Effort
to Prevent It.
OAKLAND, July s.â An. attempt to
abandon the proposed Freeholders' elec
tion was frustrated in the City Council
to-night by a vote of 5 to 4. with two ab
sentees. The ordinance licensing beer
bottling works doing a retail business of
$100 annually, Instead of quarterly, as
now, was postponed Indefinitely by the
same vote.
Poundmaster H. L. TVeltzers resigna
tion was accepted, and the selection of his
successor laid over a week. J. E. Greeny
was recommended by the Society for Pre
vention of cruelty to Animals. E. M.
Railton and J. B. Powers were the other
nominees, the latter having the support
of five of the nine Councilmen present.
The protest against the opening of
Commerce street was continued until Au
gust 1, and referred to the City Attorney
for an opinion as to the legality of the
steps thus far taken. The bills for decora
tion and other Fourth of July prepara
tions incurred were ratified and ordered
paid. The ordinance creating two officers
as assistant inspectors, at $100 per month,
was defeated.
Kelly's Bail Was Reduced.
OAKLAND, July 5.â The preliminary
examination of James P. Kelly, charged
with an assault to murder upon Captain
J. P. Anderson on the local train some j
time ago, was partially heard in the Po- !
lice Court this morning, and then contin- j
ued until Friday. Kelly's bail was re
duced from $3000 to $2000. Anderson tes- j
tified that he was attacked from the rear
by Kelly one night, when the latter held i
a big revolver and threatened to shoot !
him. Anderson grappled with his assail- j
nnt and forced him into a seat. Later
Kelly declared that he did not know why
he had made the attack; that he had lost
all of his money betting at Sausalito and
wanted to kill some one. The men had
never had any trouble before. He waa
substantiated In detail by several wlt
nesses,
Kinard Files More Objections.
OAKLAND, July 6.â C. E. Kinard filed
tlona to a large portion of the i
Claims of Constable G. A. Koch for the
month of June before the Board of Super
visors to-day. Also to those of Constable j
J. F. Cronin of Oakland Township. The |
former, he declares, are not legal charges I
against the county and the latter are not '
legally made out, as they do not show j
where the arrests were made or whether |
the Constable had Jurisdiction. Super
visor Church, in reply, said:
"This matter belongs to the Grand Jury.
I am sick and tired of having these ob
jections filed every month. If there is j
fraud, then let the Grand Jury deal with |
it."
Mr. Kinard denied that he charged
fraud, but Bimply claimed Illegalities.
After some discussion the matter was re
ferred to the Finance Committee, who
will hear Mr. Kinard.
Insane for Fifteen Years.
OAKLAND, July s.â Mrs. Meta Ditt
man of Haywards was committed to

known that for fifteen years he had de
votedly cared for an insane woman and
kept it from the public. To-day Henry
Eggert applied for her commitment. He
is her brother. Drs. Milton and Fisher
examined her and recommended the ac

DEPUTY AVERTS A TRAGEDY
JOEL J. HURT SECURES THE AR

Blood Likely to How Before the
Hurt-Schaefer Feud Over
Children Is Finally
Settled.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 5.
Alphonse Schaefer, the sheep herder
who married the divorced wife of Joel
J. Hurt, the wealthy Wyoming cattle
rancher, Is now in the County Jail
charged with assault to murder. This
evening Deputy Sheriff Charles White is
congratulating himself that he is not in
a coffin and Joel J. Hurt shares the same
feeling.
As Mr. Hurt was in the Sheriff's of
fice this afternoon talking to Under Sher
iff Harlow. Alphonse Sch*Â«fer was sneak
ing behind the door in the corridor.
Charley White passed from the office into
the corridor, leaving Hurt talking to
Harlow inside. As soon as White ap
peared Schaefer confronted him with a
big pistol. He evidently thought that I
Hurt was coming out and he dropped his
hand as soon as he saw the Deputy
Sheriff. A moment later, realizing his
mistake, he pointed the gun at Hurt's
abdomen and but for the lively work of
Charley White would have fired. The
Deputy Sheriff grappled with him, took
away his gun and marched Schaefer to
the O.unty Jail.
A little later Mr. Hurt went before the
District Attorney and swore to a war
ran; charging Schaefer with an assault to
commit murder.
Eye witnesses to the affair declare that
Schaefer followed Hurt into the Sheriffs
office and lay in wait outside, evidently
expecting trouble. He had no particular
business at the office, and no one knows
what took him there. After his arrest he
stated that he thought Hurt had his hand
on his hip pocket, and knowing him to
have a record as a fighter hie simply pre
pared to defend himself.
To-morrow morning the writ of habeas
corpus sworn out by the father whose
long hunt for his children has been al
ready published will be heard before
Judge Ogden. The three little ones are
still at the Chabot home in care of their
mother, and this latest escapade of their
stepfather will undoubtedly have some ef
fect on the disposition of the children.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

The annual row between the County'
Assessor and the Supervisors sitting as
a Board of Equalization had its formal
beginning this morning. Assessor Dal
ton completed the rolls to-day and turned
them over to the Supervisors. The foot
ings show that the exact reduction from
the roll of last year is $9,895,725. This is
made up as follows:

The difference in Oakland Township for
the two years is caused by the recent an
nexation of much of the township by the
city of Oakland.
For three years the political feature of
the summer has been tho contest over
the assessment of certain personal and
railroad properties in this county. Mr.
Dalton has always placed upon the rolls
the West Oakland switches, the mole, the
Seventh-street local and the tracks, and
each year they have been taken off by
the County Board of Equalization upon
the advice of Mr. Morehouse, me mem
ber of the State Board of Equalization
from this district. E. Black Ryan
knows Just what to expect each July, and
he comes over prepared with all kinds of
documents to prove that his company ia
being cinched.
Each July Mr. Dalton prepares to up
hold his assessments, and generally for
about two weeks there is a battle royal
before the Board of Equalization. So far
it has always ended in favor of the
Southern Pacific Company, and this year
there is some speculation as to what will
be the result. In speaking of the matter
to-day Mr. Dalton said:
"I have placed the railroad properties
on the rolls again, as I believe they ought
to be there. The County Board has taken
them off for the last three years and I
have no idea what they will do this year.
The portion of the water front which the
Supreme Court says must be awarded to
the Water Front Company has been as
sessed to it at a valuation that I consid
er very fair.
"This year's assessment roll Is an en
tirely new one. All the figures have been
arrived at without regard for former as
sessments. Everybody knows that land
is not worth as much this year as it was
last year. This county has been assessed
too high, and the depreciation in value
has made a reduction of the assessment
roll imperative. In the interior of the
county, especially, land has greatly de
creased in value and the same is true of
many parts of this city, particularly West
Oakland. All the field deputies were in
structed to absolutely ignore precedent
and to assess land for what it is actually
worth and no more. I have employed
much expert assistance in compiling the
roll and although it shows a big reduc
tion. I believe it to be the correct value
of this county for assessment purposes."
The Supervisors met as a Board of
Equalization to-day and Issued a notice
that they are now ready to pass on the
reduction and rating of assessments and
to consider all applications concerning tho
roll toming from taxpayers.
MYSTERY OF A DEATH.
The Man Killed by the Local on Mon
day Identified as Daniel Black.
OAKLAND, July s.â Ben F. Calhoun, of
2514 Telegraph avenue, Berkeley, identi
fied the remains of the unknown man
killed by the local train on First and
Broadway last night as Daniel Black, of
Addison and Mary streets, Berkeley. He
said Black left home yesterday morn
ing in good health and expected to re
turn, so far as known.
Considerable mystery surrounds the af
fair. No one has yet been found who
saw him either on the train or track prior
to his death. Foul play is hinted at, as
the deceased was Quite well-to-do. No
reason can be given for hla going to that
portion of the city unless he was decoyed
there or led prisoner. As nothing of any
value was found on his person it may
be that robbery was the motive for his
death, but nothing definite could be
learned to-night. An Inquest will be held
to-morrow evening.
Mr. Black was a native of Boston,
Mass.. aged 45, and a bachelor, living a
retired life with two sisters and a
brother. He was formerly in charge of
the Clark ranch, near Melrose, and was
of a quiet disposition.
Virginia Goodsell Going East.
OAKLAND, July s.â This city Is to sup
ply the Eastern stage with another of her
beautiful and talented daughters. She
leaves about the middle of the month
for New York, where she has se% - eral flat
tering offers awaiting her. It is Miss "Vir
ginia Goodsell, the sister of Miss
Dorothy, the talented musician, who has
appeared in local theaters and achieved
considerable fame in dramatic roles. En
route she will visit the exposition at
Omaha and officiate as maid of honor at
the wedding of her cousin, Miss Catherine
Goodsell.
Compton Back From Montana.
OAKLAND, July s.â Deputy Sheriff Al
White has returned from Montana with
Beverly C. Compton, who is charged with
embezzling the three-year-old running
horse, Mayboy. He is now in jail, but
claims his arrest Is the rankest kind of
injustice. He made no resistance to being
brought here and came without requisi
tion papers. The affair is so complicated
that only through a jury trial can the
truth be known.
To Box in Berkeley.
BERKELEY, July s.â Joseph Lavigne,
of the Beacon Athletic Club, and Charles
Tye, of the Oakland Reliance Club, havn

The fight will decided the lightweight
championship for the coast.
Charged With Neglect.
Secretary Wadham of the Eureka So
ciety for the Protection of Children yes
terday morning arrested Mrs. Âellie Mil
ler of 10 Clara street for neglecting her
children. Her husband is a hard-working
man, employed in Wells-Fargo's Express

customed to leave her home at night after
her husband has gone to bed and not re
turn until daylight.

Murray of Fleasanton Appears Be

Old â Entries for
To-Day
The excellence of the sport provided by
the Breeders' Association at the Oakland
track Is perhaps no better exemplified
than by the good marks horses without
records are dally giving themselves.
Yesterday, for example, Mabel McKln
ney, another of the get of that reliable
sire, McKlnney, trotted a mile in 2:17 flat,
and Inferno, a son of the great Diablo,
driven by the owner of that sterling
horse, paced his first heat in 2:15. Alto
gether, since the meeting opened, some
sixty heats and races have been brought
off, and only one has shown worse than
2:25. One has c"ly to take up the East
ern papers with accounts of their races
there to appreciate what a great showing
that is.
The punctuality that governed the
judge's stand on Monday prevailed yes
terday, and the programme was through
by 5 o'clock, a state of things which suits
the average race-goer to a dot.
Charles L. Griffith's bay gelding, J.o Al
bert, who made such an impression on his
first start last Wednesday, when he won
in the 2:27 class in 2:17y 2 , was the favorite
for the first race. W. G. Durfee's Mamie
Riley, quoted at 3 to 1, and W. L. Spoor' 3
Mabel McKinney, who was third to Jib
Albert on the previous occasion, had few
supporters at 10 to 1. Going to the quar
ter in :33*i, the half in 1:08% and the
three-quarters in 1:42, with Dexter D and
Silver Queen next behind him, it looked
like a victory for the favorite, but Mabel,
who had broken early in the race, had
steadied down, came through at the pole
at the three-quarters and won hand
somely in 2:17.
The second race, 2:15 pacing, was not
much more than a work out for Little
Thorn, who, as good as even money, beat
Arthur W, 3 to 2, and Beachwood, 2, in
2:14.
Dr. F. W. Knowles' nomination, Infer
no, was a 4 to 5 favorite in the heat race
for 3-year-olds, in which there were only
two other starters, Dictatress and I Di
rect. Ho won the first easily in 2:15, with
I Direct Just second, but tiring so that
Dictatress was made second choice for
the second heat. Inferno won the second
heat Just as easily, and Dictatress, se
curing the place, divided second and
third money with I Direct.
C. A. Hug's good looking but self-willed
Mojave, at 3 to 1, after delaying the start
for a few scores, finally got away, and
settling down like a good game horse,
trotted around his field and won from
Silver Ring and Clay S in 2:15^.
Billy Donathan added another victory
to his credit by driving Myrtle Thorn
home a winner in the last event on the
card, a special for named horses, in whicii
Mabel McKinney, the winner of the first
race, was favorite at 4 to 5. Daymont
was a good second.

HE THOUGHT
HE WAS THE
WHOLE WORKS
School Director Burns Sharply
Disciplined by His Col
leagues.
He Gave Out Contracts for Repairs at Will.
Drucker Quickly Resigns From the
Building Committee.
I have shown enough to
call attention to the rank ex
travagance that prevails and
to the further fact that the
chairman of the Building
Committee, Director Burns, is
proccHiing in an entirely ille
gal manner, and that he has
grossly mismanaged the af
fairs of his committee. I be
lieve he should b3 requested to
resign. â [From the report of
Chairman E. J. liallagher of
the Finance Committee of the
Board of Education.]
Thero was another upheaval in the
Board of Education at a special meeting
last evening, called by that body to con
sider the charges of gross mismanage
ment brought against^, the committee on
buildings and grounds by Chairman E. J.
Gallagher of the finance committee.
While the meeting -was very quiet, and
no harsh language used, it terminated In
a Bhocking rebuke to Chairman Burns of
the accused committee and his fellow
members thereof, which bro-ight not a
word of denial or protest from Mr. Burns,
but so excited Director Druoker that he
not only averred that he had boen made
a victim of misplaced confidence in sanc
tioning the work of Chairman Burns, but
he promptly handed in his resignation as
a member of the troublesome committee.
A BOARD UNTO HIMSELF.
School Director Thomas A. Burns Accused by His Colleagues of
Unofficial Conduct.
This leaves Mr. Burns alone in the em
barrassing position.
Mr. Drucker, in defense of his attitude,
stated: "There has never been a meet
ing of the committee on buildings ana
grounds since I have been in office ex
cept that held last week."
He had signed bills and contracts
brought to him by Inspector J. J. O'Brien
on the statement that they were, "all
right." Now that he had found that
these acts were not only improper, bui
Illegal, he desired to disconnect himself
from the disagreeable combination.
The reading of Director Gallagher's hot
report was listened to very attentively.
It was as follows:
To the Hon. Board of Educationâ Gentlemen:
At the last regular meeting I submitted a re
port upon the work being performed by the
building commutes. The board decided at that
time to take the matter up at a special meet
ing to be held to-day to hear a report from
the building commit on the work now being
done and me building committee was In
structed not to begin any new work.
At the last meeting of the board the chair
man of the building committee stated that the
work mentioned in my report was being done
by day's labor, by men sent him by different
members of the board. I took the trouble to
Investigate and found that this statement Is
not entirely true. The laborer! employed by
the committee are working at the Winfleld
Scott School, but the work at the Agassis and
Polytechnic schools Is being performed by per
sons who have no connection with the depart
ment. They have not been authorized by the
board or any committee of the board to do
this work. I say this advisedly because both
Mr. Drucker and- Mr. Carew, members of the
building committee, assure me that they have
not at any time been consulted by the chair
man of the committee and they have never
given their consent to the work now being
f done. During the week I visited the Park
Primary. Extensive alterations are being made
there and they are ill-advised in the extreme
These alterations are not being made by any
one connected with the department. The peo
ple of Richmond are crying loudly for addi
tional school accommodations, but they want
something substantialâ not makeshifts. I also
visited the Clement grammar. The men em
ployed by the building committee have torn
down the closets and some one else 1b engaged
In rebui.uing them.
There are no contracts on file either with the
secretary of the board or at the office of the
inspector of bu.â.ngs for any of the work I
have mentioned. The only contracts I could
lind on record are ten agreements with L G
Young for cleaning vaults. I also found a
contract for building a bow window on the
principal's office at thÂ» Humboldt School as
per specifications, for Â»193, contract dated June
12, 18a8; also contract with same party to build
a school 16x30 as per present shed, take down
back, plank yard, fix forty feet of side fence
amount $169; contract dated June 3, 1898 i
copied these contracts June 29. As the work
mentioned in these contracts Is unnecessary I
would recommend that the contracts be can
celed.
Further investigation revealed the fact that
the committee intends to whiten or tint the
following schools: Grant, Le Conte, Richmond
Sutro, Buena Vista, West End and Mission
Grammar. The first-named school was fin
ished June 29, 1898. The action taken by the
Building Commute at the last meeting: was, I
presume, sufficient to have the commute hold
U>Â« others In abeyance. There are no con
tracts on file anywhere for â whitening or tint
ing the above schools, anÂ«l I would recom
mend that this work be stopped.
I have not the time to all the attention of
the board to every particular piece of work
being performed by the Building Committee,
but I have shown enough to call attention to
the rark extrs.vaea.nce thnt prevails and to
the further fact that the chairman of the Uulld
| ing Committee la proceeding in an entirely ille
gal manner and that he has grossly misman
aged the affairs of his committee, and 1 be
lieve he Bhould be requested to resign.
E. J. (iALLAOHER.
The reading of the foregoing was fol
lowed by the report of Chairman Burns
of the unhappy committee. Then Direc
tors Gallagher, Derham, Armor, Waller
and Drucker proceeded to dissect the
document. It set forth work accom
plished, but not paid for; work in prog
ress and work contracted for.
"I know nothing about these matters."
said Mr. Drucker, hotly, after running
through the report. "I did not know it
was ordered, and never signed or saw a
contract for it. These things have never
come before the board, and I will not
stand responsible for any such actions.
I therefore now tender my resignation
from that committee. Why, look at it!
There are acts of the chairman of the
Building Committee in which he has con
tracted for over $150,000 worth of work,
and in no instance ha 3he either called a
committee meeting or consulted me re
garding the business passing through the
hands of that committee. This won't
do."
The investigation throughout showed
that Director Burns had instructed In
spector O'Brien to write the contracts, j
and Burns signed them. Of the work fin
ished, in course of completion and neces
sary to be finished at the earliest possible
moment before the opening of the schools
there was Borne $14,000 worth, of which
over $4000 was for vault work. Director
Gallagher said much of this $14,000 worth
of work was entirely unnecessary, and
there was no excuse for doing it. except
to spend money. He moved that these
contracts be canceled and that the board
order the completion of the work being
done at Starr King, Clement. WinfMd
Scott, Park Primary and Washington
Grammar schools. This motion was
adopted, and after further examination of
the peculiar methods of Chairman Burns
in which the board failed to get any in
formation whatever from that gentleman
Director Drucker called particular atten
tion to the fact that Director Burns had
Ignored the orders of the board of the
last mooting and proceeded on the same
old policy. Â«
This brought about more protests from
those members who took an active part
in the expose of the building committee
in v,hioh Chairman Gallagher offered to
prove- that be could get some of the work
ordered by Burns done for about half the
iin'cunt that gentleman was proposing to
pay. There was no denial of this allega
tion.
During the proceedings Mr. Galiagher
by questioning the inspector brought out
the fact that these invisible contracts
were kept in a "private receptacle" in >he
office of that official, and that was why
Chairman Gallagher had been refu i:id
the right to examine them. However, he
was now welcome to do so.
After a prolonged and painful session
Director Derham moved that all the
other contracts and orders embodied in
Chairman Burns' report be canceled; that
the work be advertised In the legal wav:
that future contracts and propositions
pass through the board, and that in fu
ture the building committee be held to
observe the law, which requires that such
committee shall not Incur an expense ex
ceeding $50 without the order of the
board. This was carried without a dis
senting vote, Mr. Burns not voting.
Director Drucker's resignation from the
committee was held to be acted upon at
the next regular meeting of the board. It
was rumored that Burns, having been
Bborn of all hie arbitrary powers, mignt
follow Drucker's example.
What redress the contractors will have
to secure pay for work performed und n r
contracts with Director Burns remains to
be seen.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 6, 1898.
REWARDED FOR FAITHFUL SERVICE.
Herbert P. Thrall Now Superintendent of the
Eighth Division, Railway Mail Service.
Herbert P. Thrall, the well-known postoffice inspector, has received the
appointment of superintendent of the eighth division railway mall service,
with headquarters in this city, to succeed Samuel Flint, and he will as
sume the duties of his new position on Thursday, the 7th inst. The eighth
division of the railway mail service, embracing California, Nevada, Oregon,
Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Utah and Washington, is one of the largest and
most important in the United States. The mileage, both in railroads and
star routes, has greatly increased of late years, and the necessity of a
larger force to supervise the work of the division has long been apparent.
The appointment of Mr. Thrall simply shows the desire of the Postofllce
Department to inject new blood and energy into the service, and its confi
dence in and good will for Mr. Flint have been shown in his appointment
to the position of assistant superintendent, assigned to the responsible duty
of inspecting the star route service.
On July 1 the new four-year contracts to carry mail over the most of
the star routes in this division went into effect, and the work of super
vising this branch of the service, properly adjusting the schedules ajid se
curing 1 the best possible results is a very Important one.
Superintendent Thrall entered the postal service as a clerk In the railway
mail service in May, 18S3. His principal runs were on the Overland be
tween this city and Ogden, and to Los Angeles. In August, 1890, he was
offered and accepted an appointment as postoffice inspector, which he has
since iilled most creditably. He is an active, energetic and conscientious
worker in whatever he undertakes, and success in his new position la a fore
gone conclusion. With two exceptions, all of the branch postofflces In San
Francisco, Including Station D in the new ferry building, were fitted up
under the supervision of Mr. Thrall.
WOULD FORCE
OUT A WIDOW
Seeking Possession of a
Coursing Park.
COURTS MUST NOW DECIDE
EFFORTS TO DISPLACE MRS.
DALTON AT INGLESIDE.
Her Late Husband Placed the Leash
man's Sport on the High Plane
Which It Occupies at
This Time.
Unless an angel of peace appears on the
scene forthwith and reconciles the va
rious parties at interest contending for
mastery in the matter of the possession of
the lngleside coursing park the Kates of
that institution will be closed temporarily.
It is affirmed by the friends of Mrs. John
P. Dalton that a number of men are en
deavoring to force her out of the park di
rectorate.
"Jack" Dalton started the Ingleslde
park two years since. At that time there
I was a park at Ocean View, but the sup-
I port was on a low plane owing to the
scandals regarding the "fixing" of dogs
and complaints as to the judging. Dal
ton had been one of the most prominent
of the dog men in the country for years
! and enjoyed a reputation for honesty and
' for being a thorough sportsman.
From the day on which he opened the
gates at Inglesido the park attracted the
best class of leashmen, and with them the
best dogs. It was soon evident that Dal
ton would conduct the sport on the high
est plane. Old coursing men who had re
tired in disgust were again attracted to
the sport and commenced to import the
best dogs of the East and England. The
crowds increased at every meeting, and
there was not a suspicion of crookedness
in the sport. DalUm had the entire man
agement and no subordinates were given
authority to dictate as to the handling of
the sport. All this time M. J. Donovan
whs a silent partner. Matters went on
smoothly until the death of Dalton. when
trouble began for the widow. Donovan
assumed the management at this time.
"Should Mr. Donovan and Mr. Grace
retire from the management of Ingleside
Coursing Park." said Harry Brennan,
when discussing the situation yesterday,
"the business will not be permitted to
suffer." Mr. Brennan is Mrs. Dalton's
brother. "Two prominent horse racing
and coursing men stand ready to go on
with the park, making material changes
that will render It one of the finest places
of its character In the world. It has the
natural advantage of location, being
easy of access, and with a perfect field
for the coursing. It would then be con
ducted on the original lines as laid down
by Mr. Dalton.
"Mr. Grace, the judge, has tendered his
resignation, claiming that Mrs. Dalton
has made statements against him, the
substance of which, however, he will not
disclose to her. This, when taken in con
junction with the statement of some dog
men that they will not co-operate with
the widow of Mr. Dalton as a stockholder
in the park, gives the. resignation an ugly
look. On the surface it looks as though
he was playing a part for them. I will
present either Mr. Grace or his informers
with a $500 check if they can prove that
Mrs. Dalton ever made any statements
derogatory of Mr. Grace's character.
"The resignation of Mr. Grace will not
affect the park. There is a man in this
city now who is fully competent to take
up the work of Judging whenever he lays
It down. This man is Mr. Jerome, the
noted Australian judge, who comes here
with an international reputation for abil
ity and fairness.
"The end must come soon In the contro
versy over the park and my sister, Mrs.
Dalton, will make a firm stand for her
rights in the matter. The old and stanch
friends of her late husband have proved
themselves loyal to her in this matter.
People who have left the park because
of past troubles have proffered her their
support. The persons who started Union
Park and divided the coursing men were
â¢friends of 'Jack' Dalton, and have al
ways been friends of his widow. They
did not withdraw their support from In
gleside through any acts of either Mr. or
Mrs. Dalton, and are still loyal to the
lady. They speak well of her business
ability and of her rightful claim to the
business and sport that was built up
through the energy and ability of her late
husband. I am sorry I cannot say the
same for the Ingleside people, who owe
all their success to her husband. If mat
ters are not settled soon the gates of the
park will be closed tightly until a settle
ment is reached. I will make a fighting
stand for my sister's interests and am
barked in the struggle by the right peo
ple."
Dalton's estate is in course of probate
in Judge Coffey's court, and it is under
stood that the widow's plans are to force
a settlement with her business associates
through those proceedings. She will
probably call for the appointment of a
receiver.
CAPTAIN ROTTANZI'S WOES.
Thrilling Description of Hardships
at the Powder Mills.
Captain-Doctor-Supervisor Rottanzi,
handsome and debonair, marched into
the office of the clerk of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday afternoon, garbed
in the natty fatigue suit of a captain of
the army, brown as a San Joaquin farmer
and delighted to be absent from his dan
gerous post.
"I tell you, my friends," said he, "it
Is a great relief to get away from that
confounded Santa Cruz powder mill.
Why, I am just beginning to take long
breaths again. It is a fact that I don't
dare sneeze down there without putting
my head in a blanket.
"If the military authorities want to
keep Captain 'Billy' Barnes from out
growing himself, they should send him
to my post for about six weeks. He
would, if he survived the mental strain,
come back here a mere phantom and
could have his clothes made over and get
two suits out of one.
"Talk about mentul anguish. Why, my
tent is only forty paces from a silent hor
ror in the shape of fifteen tons of pow
der; a short distance away is another
sleeping volcano, and up the hill a little
further is a nightman- that haunts my
sleeping and waking hours worse than
a guilty consr-ience. It is only a little
matter of 200,000 pounds of concentrated
death. Woo! It is horrible to think whai
would happen to me if that stuff should
conclude to expand without giving due
notice.
"The Coroner might find only an as
sorted lot of fingers as a result, and my
friends might mourn over and bury the
digits of Corporal Casey or Mr. Schultze,
thinking it was my beloved remains.
"Tht> other day I got some left-hand
encouragement from an old employe at
the works.
" 'How long have you been here?' I
asked. 'Twinty-wan years,' he replied.
'So long and not killed yet?' 'Sure, there's
no danger. Ay coorse we had a little
cxploshin' a few wakes ago. It was only
six tons ay powther, though, and it made
a swape here as clane as a pace ay paper
There was three harses over there a short
ways and it was very funny, sure. The
powther blowed thim inside out and we
niver found a hair ay them left.'
" 'How did you escape?' 'Oh! that was
aisy. I hid in the wather trough and only
got wet. Now be aisy, captain; ate and
schlape well, for I've been here, as I tould
you, twinty-wan years and never was
killed. There's no danger.'
" 'You say six tons blew the whole place
clean as paper and there is no danger
with fifteen tons of powder under my noss
and a train-load a fewVods away?'
" 'To be sure, sor; bekase that axplo
shin was jlst an accident!' "

HOW MR. CURTIS
KNEW THE PRICE
Cross-Examlned by the
Attorney General.
BOOKS AIDED HIS MEMORY
MADE A TEIP OVER THE ROADS
FOR EVIDENCE.
Progress of the Investigation Into
the Cost of the Property of the
Railroad Company la
This State.
The cross-examination of Engineer
Curtis of the Southern Pacific Com
pany was resumed yesterday afternoon
before United States Commissioner
Heacock. Attorney General Fitzgerald
and Robert Y. Hayne appeared on be
half of the State and William F. Her
rin, head of the Southern Pacific law
department, took care of the interests
of the company. Railroad Commission
ers La Rue and Hinton attended as
spectators.
The cross-examination was conducted
by Attorney General Fitzgerald, re
lieved at times by Mr. Hayne. Its ob
ject appeared to be to break the force
of the testimony on the direct examina
tion by showing that Mr. Curtis did not
rely altogether upon his memory cf
facts and that if he did he was not in
a position to know absolutely the things
of which he spoke. The following sam
ple questions and answers will give a
fair idea of the scope of the examina
tion and the net results of the panning
out of Engineer Curtis:
"Can you give us the names of the
railroad officials from whom you ob
tained the information which you gave
on the direct examination?" asked the
Attorney General.
"It was furnished by the subordi
nates under my direction to a consider
able extent," answered Curtis.
"Then if this data was derived as
you say your testimony was not based
upon your personal knowledge but from
the records of the company?"
"It was based on my personal knowl
edge because' I know that those things
are there. But for the purpose of mak
ing myself certain I made a special trip
of inspection over the road for the pur
pose of making this estimate. The trip
was made entirely by daylight so that
I could see everything. The trip was
made at the instance and direction of
the Southern Pacific Company in ac
cordance with an understanding with
Mr. Herrin that my testimony was
wanted in this matter."
"If you had personal knowledge,"
asked the Attorney General, "where
was the necessit" for your obtaining
this data from the books and records
of the company?"
"It is a pretty large property," replied
Mr. Curtis. "Some men may be able to
retain all those things in their minds
without the aid of the books, but I
cannot. I wanted to make sure of the
data. I felt that it would be safer and
surer to check my personal knowledge
with the records."
"It is true, Is it not, that you never
found any prices marked on the prop
erty?"
"No. There were a good many sign
boards, but the cost of the signboards
did not appear. I got my information
from the books and the bills. The bills
for the material purchased pass
through my office and through my
hands constantly and I knew from
those original bills what those things
cost. My answer appertains to current
prices."
"Then you have no personal knowl
edge of the purchase price of the ma
terial used In the construction of the
San Joaquin Valley road?"
"I saw the original bills for the ma
terial."
"If the road was built by the Con
struction Company the original bills or
Invoices must have been made to the
Construction Company and not to the
railroad company. How then did you
come to see them?"
"I saw them in the office of the en
gineer of construction in the office of
the company at Sacramento. They were
all for ties and rails. The other bills
were largely of materials made in the
company's shops in Sacramento."
"Is it not the fact that the bills from
the shops covered a profit over the
actual cost?"
"The bills from the shops are made to
show cost without profit, with a line
below 'add for superintendence and
tools, 10 per cent.' The intention is not
to make a profit out of those things.
The shops at Sacramento belong to the
Central Pacific Railroad Company. I
think they sent their bills to the Con
struction Company at actual cost after
taking this lO ner cent."
"If that be the fact the railroad com
pany must have done this work for the
Construction Company for actual cost?"
"Undoubtedly."
The remainder of the cross-examina
tion was devoted to an explanation of
the duties performed by Engineer Cur
tis while acting as superintendent of
construction of various roads. The
cross-examination will be resumed at
2 o'clock this afternoon.
A Butchertown Joke.
Robert Fernandez, an engineer in the
employ of Miller & Lux in South San
Francisco, received a severe powder burn
in the breast as the result of a practical
joke. He was dozing in a chair in the
engine room on Monday, when some
friends, disguised as burglars, entered
the room and, placing a pistol loaded
with blank cartridges at his breast,
awakened him, expecting to see the
sleepy engineer scared almost to death.
Fernandez, however, did not scare and
to carry on the joke the pistol was dis
charged. The powder burned through his
clothing and scorched a good-sized patch
of skin on his chest. Fernandez saw the
joke after the Receiving Hospital physi
cians applied balms to his wounds and
eased the pain, and laughingly told the
police that it would not be manly to pros
ecute his friends for the fun they had en
joyed.
For the Boys in Manila.
A special meeting of the Native Daugh
ters' Red Cross Aid was held in Portola
Hall, Native Sons' building, last night,
to arrange for an entertainment to raise
funds to provide luxuries and comforts
for the California soldiers now in Manila.
Miss Ida Kervan was chosen chairman,
Mrs. Theodore Lunstedt secretary and
Miss Mary B. Wilkins treasurer. About
100 ladies were present. It wasÂ» decided
to invite the co-operation of the Native
Sons.
The Native Daughters have been work
ing most industriously with the ladies of
the Red Cross Society, but it was consid
ered by them that some token of their re
gard should be got up for their big broth
ers now in Manila. More mature plans
will be arrived at when the society meets
again, on next Tuesday evening.
Hit by Flying Iron.
John Haley, a laborer employed at the

to the City and County Hospital.

cllned ladies who wear the badge of the
society hear of the prospective arrival of
troops and the caterer engaged for the

diately notified that he must prepare food

have had many misunderstandings, which
the former charges to a superabundance
of zeal on the part of the latter, and the
latter to a slowness of intellect on thu
! part of the former. The time for the ar
rival of trains is the rock on which they
most often wreck. Misled by the notifica

! mined to take a little authority unto him-
I self, and he has made special arrange-
I ments with one high in authority In the

news concerning the incoming of troops.
And all this news is transmitted over the
telephone. The other night the man who
looks after the stomachic salvation of the

official and inquired about the trains. The
usual formula was gone through, but one
question the caterer forgot to ask, and
that was the number of soldiers on board.
Before this information could be imparted
to him he hung up the telephone and was
disconnected. A large dinner was pre

The auditing department of the South
ern Pacific Company has issued the
financial report of the fiscal year. An in
crease of $4,000,000 in the profits of last
year shows the flourishing condition of
the company. This is the biggest year
in the history of the corporation, the
gain in earnings being the result of the
operation of the Pacific system. Increases
in profits have been made in nearly every
road in the system, though in some few
cases there has been a falling off in travel
and consequent losses to the company.
