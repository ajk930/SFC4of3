SALISBURY'S SURRENDER
TO THE RUSSIANS IN CHINA
ANGERS THE ENGLISH

TAKU FORTS Which Guard the Mouth of the Peiho River, the Waterway to Tientsin and Peking, With the
Russian War Vessels in the Foreground.
BERLIN, Feb. 2.â An article
in the Bt. Petersburg Novae
Vremya, which has attracted
the attention of Europe, de
clares that France and Germany
supported Russia's determina
tion and opposed England's
with reference to Talien Wan,
and hence Lord Salisbury, it is
claimed, is obliged to consult
with his colleagues before the
meeting of Parliament as to the
best way to beat a retreat if
Great Britain wishes to avoid
an open conflict with Russia.
LONDON*, Feb. 3.â The Times' Talien
Wan announcement has created much
surprise and excitement among poli
ticians, and was eagerly discussed at
the clubs. The Liberals vigorously de
nounced the reported backdown of the
British Government, while the Con
servative members of the House of
Commons did not conceal their bitter
disappointment. Many declined to
credit the report until it should be of
ficially confirmed, and a prominent
Conservative offered a Liberal oppo
s nent to pay a substantial sum to a
public charity if the reported back
down should be confirmed. The Liber
als declare it would be a humiliating
surrender to Russia and a severe blow
to British interests and prestige. '!â â¢'
The members of the iate Cabinet are
already communicating with each
other with the view of using the mat
ter as a point of attack upon the Gov
ernment during the debate upon the
Queen's speech upon the reassembling
of Parliament.
A wave of indignation has swept
over the press throughout the country
at Lord Salisbury's alleged backdown
at Talien Wan. Conservatives, no less
than Liberals, bewail the supposed re
treat from an unassailable position on
the ground that Great Britain, sup
ported by the United States and Japan,
might have safely defied Russia. It is
angry with the Times for revealing
the position.
The Standard this morning, in the
course of an editorial expressing its
regret, assumes that "since there is
no official information to the contrary,
the Times' version of the situation is
correct." It thinks "this will be pain
fully felt in the course of the pending
bye-elections, especially as the story
suggests suspicions of a larger and
wider surrender." .
The editorial concludes by advising
the Government to let the country
know as speedily as possible exactly
where it stands.
The afternoon papers yesterday com-
in the most severe terms upon
:he matter. Some of them refused to
credit the report.
The GJobe said: "No wonder If the
opponents of the ministry regard It as a
national humiliation when its support
ers are unable to find a reasonable ex
cuse for it. The public was led to be
lieve that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach and
other Cabinet Ministers meant what
they said, so the Ministers have only
themselves to thank if they lose pres
tige at home and abroad through the
withdrawal of the Talien Wan demand.
England, with her strength and enor
mous resources, has the game in her
own hands if the Ministers will only
play it with the necessary spirit."
An official statement on the subject.
Just issued, is as follows: "No com
munication can at present be published
concerning the Times' Talien Wan re
port of the negotiations as a whole.
The negotiations thus far are abso
lutely confidential. Many telegrams
from China contain statements not
merely going far beyond the Govern
ment's information, but in some in
stances are quite at variance with
known facts."
The Peking correspondent of the
Times telegraphing says: Colonel Wor
cmoeff. the Russian military adviser to j
China, has commenced his duties and
the German military instructors have
been notified of the non-renewal of I
their contracts.
FROZEN TO DEATH IN
A NEVADA BLIZZARD.

terday a short distance from his cabin
in the Silver Hill range of mountains In
that county. The old gentleman had been
doing prospecting work on a claim and
started home, but was overtaken by a
snowstorm and presumably lost his â way,
and he was frozen stiff when found.
Mr. Kellog built the first quartz mill

INJURED BY HEAVY SEAS.
Mishap to Captain Whitney of the
Schooner Jessie Minor.
ET'REKA. Keb. 2.â Captain Whitney
of the schooner Jessie Minor met with
a painful accident yesterday. While
crossing in over the bar at the entrance
to the bay the vessel shipped two heavy
seas, jamming the captain against the
wheel with great force, loosening throe
of his ribs from the breastbone, and then
throwing him against the cabin housing
which obstruction saved him from being
washed overboard.

SAX FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1898.
BLANCO FAILS
TO ALLURE THE
REBEL LEADERS
Cuban Generals Refuse to Be
Drawn Into the Snare Cun=
ningly Set by the Span
ish Commander.
FRANCE COVETS PANAMA.
PARIS, Feb. 2. â The Echo de Paris publishes a lengthy communi
cation from its Madrid correspondent which, after describing the Cu
ban situation as being none too gloomy despite the "awkward" pres
ence of the Maine at Havana, goes on to say that, besides the success
of Cuban autonomy, we may expect diplomatic action to be taken by
Europe with a view of securing the freedom of any canal route
through the Isthmus of Panama or Central America.
Europe is convinced that it is no longer of any use to devote all
her attention to Egypt, where England is trying to close the route to
the Indies, but to the Gulf of Mexico, where the United States has so
much Interest in controlling the road to China through Nicaragua or
Panama that it may well be thought they are seeking to attain this
object by the possession of Cuba.
Frequent conferences have taken place In Madrid of late between
the French Embassador and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of
the Colonies. We shall be happy to think something was said at these
conferences regarding the situation which affects all Europe, and
France as much as any other state, for the route through Panama or
Nicaragua to Asia would be one to be. followed by our vessels toward
Tonquin at present, and hereafter toward that fragment of China
which sooner or later must come into our hands.
HAVANA, Feb. 2.â General Blanco is
on his way back to Havana. He left
Santiago de Cuba on a special steamer
yesterday. His mission in Oriente has
been, it is said, fruitless so far as
checking the rebellion is concerned.
When General Blanco started out on
his trip to Oriente much was expected
from him. He was to make a personal
attempt to secure the surrender of
several important rebel chiefs. It was
said by palace officials that General
Blanco had cause to feel confident of
securing the surrender of General Rabi
and possibly of General Calixto Garcia.
This was not accomplished, and reports
say that the rebel forces under General
Garcia inflicted a severe blow on the
Spanish under General Linares and
General Luque, killing several officers,
including a son of General Luque. Of
ficial reports say that eighty-five were
killed or wounded.
Failing in securing the surrender,
Spaniards here expected General Blan
co to take the field and conduct a vig
orous campaign against the rebels. He
publicly announced that Â»uch was his
intention, but for some reason his
plans miscarried and now he is com
ing home without having struck a de
cisive blow.
The volunteers are making threats
again and the authorities, in order to
be fully prepared, have deemed it nec
essary to take precautions against a
demonstration. Guards have been
placed about the public buildings and
the residences of members of the au
tonomist Cabinet and American con
sulate. About the cigar factory of the
Rabel Company, which supports au
tonomy, is gathered 200 cavalry.
The new government is worried over
the threatened resignation of several
members of the autonomist Cabinet.
The official statements which will be
published are to the effect that the rea
son General Blanco was not successful
in securing General Rabi's surrender
was that General Rabi had been ar
rested by General Garcia and stripped
of his rank because it was feared he
would surrender. General Rabi's
brother, it is reported, has been shot by
order of General Garcia for the same
reason.
One of the most important engage
ments of the present campaign in Ori
ente was fought on January 21, near
Caiman between the forces under Gen
eral Luque and the rebels under Gen
eral Garcia. The Spanish, it is re
ported, had 150 killed and a large num
ber wounded. From accounts received
the fight was a veritable slaughter, tho
Spaniards being boxed up in a ravine.
General Luque sent to Cauto, where the
main body of Spanish truops was sta
tioned, for assistance, and commenced
to retreat toward Holguln. He
reached Holguln on January 27 and on
i the same evening General Linares, who
had been sent to his assistance, was
chased into the town by another rebel
force. The rebels employed their light
field guns with great effect.
Reports received from the Cauto
River state that the troops there are In
a deplorable condition. General Pando
is lending every energy in his attempt
to make the river navigable, so as to
send supplies. Several email towns
have been entered and raided by rebels
and in Santa Clara several estates have
been attacked and destroyed. In the
western provinces the rebels are show
ing unusual activity and some com
bined movement is expected daily
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.-R is said at
the Navy Department that the Mont
gomery, after leaving Santiago, will
stop at some other ports on the coast
of Cuba and then proceed southward
to the coast of South America, per
haps extending the cruise as far south
as Rio, where she may join the South
Atlantic squadron. Other cruisers and
gunboats will probably follow the
course of the Montgomery- generally
from time to time so that the United
States flag will be seen oftener in' the
future in the waters south of the Unit
ed States than it has been for many
years.
FRANCE TO GREATLY
ENLARGE HER NAVY.
Estimates Involving Many New
Warships Submitted to the
Chamber of Deputies.
PARIS, Feb. 2.â During the discussion
of the naval estimates in the Chamber of
Deputies to-day M. J. Dkerjeu (Rep.), re
porter of the committee, replying to the
criticisms of the navy, contended that the
French ships were quite equal to those of
foreign navies.
The committee proposes that an iron
clad, three cruisers and eleven torpedo
boats be begun thlÃ year.
Vlce-Admfral Besnard, the Minister of
Marine, sa4d the Government's naval pro
gramme had made the Mediterranean a
French gulf. It was intended now to
build Ironclads for extra European
waters, with an extensive sphere of ac
tion, and a larger number. of small ar
mored cruisers. The Government, he
added, was actively pursuing experiments
with submarine boats and the Improve
ments in the initial velocity of the artil
lery were making it the best in the world.
Meanwhile the fortifications at Blzerla
were actively proceeding in . construction.
The Minister admitted that accidents to
French boilers were more frequent than
in other navies.
THE SHELLS
EIPLODE
TOO SOON
Light Artillery Sup
plied With Poor
Ammunition.
Sensation Created by the
Discovery of a Lot of
Flimsy Shrapnel.
Firing Tests at the Presidio Con
ducted by Lieut. Babbitt of
the Ordnance Corps.
THE HARBOR DEFENSES.
Orders From the War Department to
Hasten the Work of Mounting
the Now Guns.
A genuine sensation was created in
army circles of thla department yester
day. Testa of shrapnel shells were
made by Lieutenant E. B. Babbitt of
Benicla Arsenal.Twenty-Bix shells were
flred and fifty per cent of the ammuni
tion was found to be wholly worthless.
The flimsy shrapnel was supplied by
the American Ordnance Company of
Washington and must have been ac
cepted by some one of the gilt-edged
society men on staff duty at the na
tional capital.
The first definite intelligence that
some of the ammunition supplied to
troops of this department was defec
tive came to the knowledge of General
Shafter last November and was report
ed by the officers of the light batteries
of the Third Artillery. The firing tests
at Redwood City revealed the exist
ence of defective shrapnel. One of the
shells fired during the Redwood prac
tice burst in the bore of the field gun.
The fragment, nearly half the size of
the wnole projectile, was sent to Gen
eral Shafter. He reported the facts
to the chief of ordnance at Washing
ton, D. Cm and urged investigation.
A few days ago orders were issued
directing that Lieutenant Babbitt of
Benicia Arsenal proceed to the Pre
sidio and there test the shrapnel. In
obedience to orders Lieutenant Bab
bitt arrived at the Presidio yesterday
and proceeded to the testing. He
placed one of the field pieces â a three
inch rifled gun of Captain Potts' Light
Battery F â near the water's edge, a
short distance from the Presidio wharf.
Twenty-six rounds of ammunition were
taken from the ordinary supply.
The first three shells fired seemed to
be all right. The explosion In each In
stance took place at the proper dis
tance from the gun and the fragments,
scattering, splashed the water at the
points desired.
The fourth shell was defective and
so was the fifth and the sixth.
When the twenty-six rounds were
| discharged It was readily calculated
that 50 per cent of the shrapnel ammu
nition was worthless.
The defective shells burst near the
muzzle of the gun and scattered the
inclosed bullets and fragments in the
water a few yards from the shore line.
It was found that the chief cause of
the premature explosion was tiie thin
ness of the wall of the shell. The wall
was made thin in order to give room
Inside for a heavy charge of explosive
material. It was clear to the minds of
i officers who saw the experiments that
the wall of the shell was not of suffi
cient thickness to resist the force of
the propelling charge of powder. The
shell was practically shattered before
it left the bore of the cannon.
The report had been circulated in
I Washington or elsewhere among
friends of the company supplying the
ammunition that the defects existed
only in electrically welded shrapnel.
To make the test certain all the. shells
fused by electricity- were excluded from
the twenty-six rounds selected by
Lieutenant Babbitt.
Yesterday Colonel Charles R. Suter,
chief engineer of the Pacific division,
received instructions from General J.
M. Wilson, chief of engineers, Wash
ington, D. C, to hasten the work of
mounting the modern guns for the de
fense of this harbor. In accordance
with instructions the force of workmen
on the fortifications will be enlarged.
Word was received by wire yesterday
from the chief of ordnance that two
additional ten-inch rifled guns, to be
mounted on disappearing carriages,
had been shipped from the proving
grounds to San Francisco. Each gun
weighs thirty-eight tons and will come
through on a car contsructed specially
for hauling heavy ordnance. Twelve
carriages for the new mortar battery
have arrived from the East. The re
maining four will be along In a few
days.
Something has happened to suggest
activity in defensive work. Army and
navy officers do not exactly know what
is In the wind, but they know that some
reason exists for recent preparations.
The modern ordnance known as the
high-power guns now mounted and in
position for immediate use to defend
the harbor of San Francisco consists
of five twelve-inch rifled guns on the
hill near Fort Point, three ten-Inch
guns on disappearing carriages, three
dynamite guns and sixteen mortars. At
Lime Point, on the other side of the
channel, there are three twelve-inch
rifles. Thirty high-power guns are,
therefore, In place and ready for imme
diate use. At the Presidio, Alcatraz and
Lime Point there are eighteen 15-lnch
muzzle-loading guns of the old styles,
which are effective at a ranee of one
mile. _, M
LYNCHED
FOR TAKING
TWO LIVES
"Doc" Tanner's Punish*
ment at the Hands
of Miners.
Tried, Convicted and Executed at
a Copper River Camp for -
Avenging an Alleged
Wrong.
Out of the rush to the north has
come one more of the tales of horror
to which men become accustomed
when the lure of gold draws the
reckless and unscrupulous in crowds
from the restraints of civilization.
Because he believed that he had been
defrauded by his companions "Doc"
TanneT, a Kentuckian, opened fire
upon a party of gold-seekers camped
near the mouth of Copper Biver.
He had overheard a conference in
which it was about decided that be
cause of his complaining he was to
be turned adrift by the men he had
accompanied to the north. Tanner
was a dead shot and at his fire two
miners fell dead. The extinguishing
of the light in their tent saved the
other. Tanner surrendered to the
miners of the camp and was at once
tried before a jury of thirty-eight
men. They found him guilty and
sentenced him to death. Tanner
pleaded his own case, but scorned to
ask for mercy. He was taken to a
point near the camp and hanged.
SEATTLE, Feb. 2.â The steamship
Alliance arrived in port this afternoon
from Orca, near the mouth of the Cop
per River in Alaska. She brought
news of the killing of two men and the
lynching of the murderer. Tire tragedy
and subsequent sensational episode oc
curred on January 2 and 3 at Valdez,
Prince William Sound.
Millard Fillmore Tanner, familiarly
known as "Doc" Tanner, of Lexington,
Ky., fired the fatal shots that almost
instantly ended the existence of two
of his comrades. They were W. A.
Lee of Lowell, Mass., and N. Call of
Worthington, Minn. B. F. Haines of
Salem, Mass., narrowly escaped a bul
let that was sent in his direction.
Within a few hours after the double
murder Tanner's lifeless body was
dangling from the limb of a tree, an
indication that quick justice had been
meted out.
The killing was the result of a long
series of quarrels between various
members of the party and the pecula
i tions of Haines and Hogue. When
first formed the party included J. J.
I Murphy, B. Carlin, B. F. Haines, W.
| A. Lee, Andrew Scott, John Scott, H.
| Bent, James Pierce and a. Mr. Hil
dreth.all of Massachusetts, and a Mr.
| Hogue of Newsburgh, N. Y. They were
i under the management of Haines, who
1 guaranteed to land each man at Orca,
j Prince William Sound, with six
months' supply of food, clothing and
prospectors' tools for the sum of $250
, each.
The party arrived in Seattle the last
GENERAL W. R, SH AFTER.
PRICE : FIVE CEI^S.;
of October. Here they met Tanner and
Call, who were added to their number.
1 Tanner represented himself as a prac
j tical miner and prospector and an all
round mountaineer and plainsman. Ha
! was short $70 of the required $250, but
j the amount was made up by the other
! members of the party. In addition to
j a contribution of $10 Call presented
; Tanner with a 44-caliber Colt's re
! volver, which was afterward used in
I the murder of the donor and Lee.
The party set sail from Seattle for
I Orca and reached there without any
particular incident. After a few days
spent there they finally decided to go
by the Valdez Glacier, which was rep
resented by the employes of the Pa
cific Steam Whaling Company to be the
only way by which they might hope to
I reach the upper waters of the Copper
River. This company has located two
i townsites on Port Valdez in expecta
tion of a spring 1 rush into this district, . ;
which it is booming and which It is
believed may cause many a poor miner
to curse his fate should he be unfortu- .:
nate enough to come to the country Â£..â¢
under its direction. Odiak, via Orca
and Algauk, is the only practicable â 
route, as many have already learned. : . j'.'
After the goods of the party had been
unloaded it was seen that there was -v '::
| only a sufficient quantity to give each V
man of the party a three months' sup- â  Â:
ply instead of the six months' supply
they had paid for. Hogue had been in: .
constant company with Haines from
i the very inception of the party's .or>' â '.-â ',
j ganlzation, and he. with Haines, wasâ â '.
j held to be responsible for this condi-
I tion of affairs. This incident was the
, beginning. of all the trouble which fol
lowed after reaching Valdez. Tanner
! took it harder than the balance of the
I party and before leaving Orea he en:
i deavored to force Haines arid Hogue :
! to give an itemized account of their ex
! penditures, but without success. . . v
At Orca and after arriving at Valdez,
it is said, Tanner made himself par
ticularly offensive to the rest, of the
i party by reason of his swaggering airs
and dictatorial policy. He did not,
i however, shirk his part of the work.
| At Valdez there was six feet of snow
! cm the level, so it was decided to build
i a cabin. The roof was covered with
clay, which was procured two miles
distant. While hauling it on sleda
| several serious controversies occurred, v
I with the result that the feeling was
embittered against Tanner. That night
i the trouble culminated in the death of â ':
three men.
C. G. Hubbard, who was on the scene
I of the murders the day following, sent
; the following particulars to The Call: . -V ;â '. :
That night after supper Tanner
' went out from the cabin to an adjoin
â  ing tent, where he had been sleeping. .
During his absence Call. Lee and /!
Haines discussed his unruly disposir
j tion and suggested that the best way
I to keep peace in the party was to give
! Tanner his share of the supplies and
let him go on his own resources. s.-
While this talk was going on the Sub

. â¢ taking his belt and revolver from his

'â¢â¢ â  Call Vent on to say that believed
:.â¢â¢ it best to divide the provisions and

â¢â¢' ing: "''.: '"â â '-_ ff?9Â§

.one asked Tanner if he had done the
shooting. He answered:
;â ' '.'Yes. boys, I did the deed. I suppose
you'll hang me, but I had good cause
; ; , f or doing it.". .
Tanner was placed in charge of Me
â  Intyre and W. B. Martin and put into
_ one of the cabins under their guard.
As soon as it was discovered that
'/:';' some of the men were shot. Dr. Press
ley was brought to the scene of the
.; tragedy, but before he could arrive
Lee, who had lingered about ten min
utes after being found, was dead. Call
' had apparently been instantly killed,
having been shot an inch above the
right nipple, the ball â  ranging down
. ward along the spine and passing out
.-above the hip. This ball was found
: In the tent by a man named Hall. Lee
' :: was shot within, an inch of .the same
:. place, the ball not being found... The
third .bullet passed through the back
of the tent and at the .height of a
man' 3 head when sitting down. This
was die one fired at Haines, and the.
hole is just to the left of the rip. made
by him in escaping from the tent.
ThY bodies Ot the murdered men
werjs laid put in the tent -and at 'J
o'clock a summons was sent through
out the camp to notify everyone of the
murder and of the trial which would
be held that same night. At 11 o'clock
every man in The camp was in the
largest cabin, which had been arranged
as a court room.; All but one, who was
i" act as the prosecuting attorney,
.acted as jurors, of which there were
thirty-eight, . : ; .â '"â â¢'â 
Tanner was brought, from the cabin
where he had been placed and wafc put
on trial for his life, a lawyer from
Texas, H. C. King, acted as .attorney
for the people, Tanner desiring to de
fend himself. He was allowed to do so.
After tire prosecution had stated to
all present what had occurred. Tanner
was told t<Â» state his. case and defend
himself, He began: by saying:
"Gentlemen, I am an honorable and
honest man. I .am no train-robber or
horsethief. While I was still a child
of only a few years I was left an or
phan. I have always had to make my
own way through life. I ha^ no
friends and no relations, no one cares
for me and I; care for no one. I met
these men in Seattle and joined their
party, spending all the money I had
in coming here. This man (pointing at
Haines) was to buy us six months'
supply of food each. Ke only bought
enough- for three months. I heard
them talking of putting me out of the
party and planning to kill me. I de
termined to protect myself. I did not
intend to allow, them to bring me up
here and then abandon me. I went
into the : tent and you know what fol
lowed." â  â = '..;â â¢:;
A vote was then taken by the jury.
All declared Tanner guilty; twenty
nine were for hanging at once and nine
voted to send Tanner to Sitka. As the
majority of the Jurors had voted to
hang him at the camp it was so de
cided. Tanner was given till 10:30 a. m.
to make his peace and do any writing
that he might wlah to, Tanner was
agajn placed in charse of Mclntyre
and Martin. and; taken to his cabin
jail. From the time of killing up to
the time. of his conviction. Tanner made
no attempt to make a demonstration
or a fight. He gave up his. revolver
without a word of ..dissent. He was.
not. searched at any time. .
At the commencement of. the trial
and when Tanner was being ushered
into the courtroom Haihes, seeing him
loose, sprang from his chair and cried
to .Tanner's guards to tie Tanner's
arms, as he was dangerous. Nor
would Haines approach Tanner during
the trial, but kept a close watch upon
him, as if fearing some bodily harm.
At the conclusion of the trial Haines
requested the jurors to allow him one
privilege â to place the noose on Tan
ner's neck. They promised to grant
him this favor.
The following morning, tho 3d of Jan
uary, the trial having lasted from 9
p. m. to 4 a. m.. everything was put
into readiness for the execution of
Tanner. The miners formed in line at
10 'a. m., and Tanner was taken from
his temporary jail, his arms bound be
hind his body. He was then placed in
the center of the committee and
marched a half mile to the edge of
some cottonwood timber, where a few
scattering spruce and hemlock grew.
The committee having selected a dead
hemlock with a long projecting limb
which stood on the border of the grove.
Tanner was marched up to it, a rope
was thrown over the limb of the tree
and Haines was then requested to
place the noose on Tanner's neck. He
replied:
"Boys, I cannot do it unless you
cover his head with a cap. I don't
want Doc to see me."
Tanner said: "Gentlemen, I would
like to put it on myself."
This, however, was not allowed, but
a gentleman who is well known in the
vicinity of San Francisco and who is
an ex-county official of San Mateo, of
fered his services, and the rope was
soon in place. Tanner was then asked
if he had anything to say or if he had
any messages to leave. He replied:
"I have no messages to leave, as I
have no relatives or friends. I would
like to know how you are going to hang
me. Do you intend to pull me up and
down or are y<ju going to just pull me
up?"
He was told that for mercy's sake
they would only pull him up and tie
the rope. Tanner said, "All right."
The cap now being placed over his
head he was pulled up about three feet
above the snow and the rope tied to the
trunk of the tree. The only move
ments in his body which were noticed
after its being raised was the drawing
of his shoulders up toward the neck
and a sudden throwing forward of the
head. When he had been hanging five
minutes or so he raised his legs upward
and then straightened out, and was
not seen to move again.
The executioners then marched back
to the camp and buried Call and Lee.
Each of them had been rolled in his
blankets, and they were interred in the
same grave. A rough but imposing
ceremony was had, and mother earth
closed on them forever.
Returning to where Tanner had been
hanged, after an interval, of two hours
and a half, he was cut down, placed on
a sled and hauled off into the snow flats
and buried face downward under eigh
teen inches of sand, no ceremony being
held at his grave.
Tanner was light eomplexioned, 45 ;
years of age, weighed 190 pounds and i
was six feet in height. His hair was
slightly red, he was partly bald, his
teeth were large and noticeably long,
his chin projecting and shifting eyes, 1
which were deep set, peered out over a I
long, straight nose. He was large
boned and very muscul?ir; in fact, his
was a face and figure any one woufd
remember, once having seen them. He j
was of a very nervous temperament. |
His party endeavored several times
while in Seattle to have him have bis 'â 
photograph taken in a group with ;
them, but he always stoutly refused,
giving some trivial excuse. Tobacco j
he never used and he was never seen I
to use any kind of liquor. He was not
an unusually profane man, but was j
given to boasting, remarking to one of !
the party on the way here that he |
could draw a gun as quickly as any
man in America.
The effects of Call, Lee and Tanner j
will be sold at auction and the pro- I
ceeds pent to the families of Call and ;
Lee. Call leaves a widow and grown â 
daughter. He owns property in Minne- :
sota, from which he receives $1200 rent ;
a year. Lee's wife said as she kissed
him good-by at Boston that she would
never see him again. He leaves a i
daughter twelve years of age.
FOR REVENGE
SHE CONFESSES
Mrs. Gordon Implicates the Con
federates of Her Convict
Husband.
Recalls the Selling oT a Gold Brick
to Banker Little of
Dixon.
Special D!Â«ratrh to Tha Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2.â A morning paper
pays: Mrs. Edna Gordon, queen of con
fidence women, who Is well known In San
Francisco, has made a confession, in
which she says that Frank Aldridge,
William Raymond and James Leak have
deserted her and her husband, Charles
Gordon, who is now serving 1 a term in
San Quentin penitentiary, and for that
reason she betrays them. She says:
"In 1593, Aldridge, Raymond and Leak
played a trick on Banker Little of Dixon,
Cal. My husband, Charles Gordon, was
not mixed with this work. My husband
was in New York at the time. The gang
shortly met in New York, and a dispute
arose, which resulted in a split. Ray
mond, Leak and my husband formed a
new gang, and Aldridge went with two
crooks named Ray and Smith. Aldridge
had succeeded in getting Smith out of
prison in the South. Gordon, Raymond
and Leak went back to California in
1896 and caught a man named Hostetter
for $10,000. While trying to work another
trick, Gordon, Raymond and Leak were
caught. Banker Little heard or their cap
ture and was present at the trial.
"As it happens, my husband and Al
dridge are as alike as twins. Raymond
and Leak were not identified, but Banker
Little swore that my husband was the
same person who had swindled him. He
identified Charlie positively. My husband
at the time of the little trick was with
me at Nineteenth street and Amsterdam
avenue. He got ten years.
"Now. Frank Aldridge promised me
that he would furnish means of letting
me go to California to establish an alibi,
but he prevented my going. It was a
principle with the crowd that they would
never desert each other. My husband is
now in San Quentin. He has consump
tion. They have known that my daugh
ter, now 20 years of age, a sickly girl,
unable to make her own living, was on
my hands. They have refused to help
me.
"My daughter is now grown. I do not
wish her to be a crook, but my spirit !
and my heart are broken, and I want
her to lead an honest life. I shall be an
honest woman henceforth. I shall aid in
bringing to justice the men who have
ruined my life and betrayed my hus
band."

TRYING TO
FOOL THE
PEOPLE
Syndicated Press of
Los Angeles in a
Corner.
It Sees the Fight for the
Water Company Is
Already Lost.
Would Cloud the Issue Now
by Abuse of all True
Men.
FIGHT ON THE MAYOR.
This Line of Warfare Will Fail, for
Popular Sentiment Has Been
Aroused.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2.â The water
company press of this city, the Times,
Herald and Express, are making a
combined effort to divert public atten
tion from the water question and at
tract it to the other matters of less
vital importance to the people. As
long as the people are as thoroughly
on guard as they are right now no
move can be made by the tools of the
water company in the City Council in
the interest of the corporation. The
idea is, therefore, to divert the public
mind from the consideration of the
great issue to other matters which do
not involve interests which the syndi
cated press are seeking to protect.
The Times and Express have opened
up a bitter campaign on Mayor M. P.
Snyder. This official has made a rec
ord on the water question that is abso
lutely above reproach. He has been
bold and outspoken in his condemna
tion of the policy of the syndicated
press in doing the bidding of the water
company. Almost to a man the vo
ters of the city indorse nis position. So
the syndicated press has started â¢ out,,
by a policy of misrepresentation to
weaken Mayor Snyder before the peo
ple. The Herald is an alleged Demo
cratic paper, but it has been repudi
ated by the Democratic city commit
tee. It has not only openly misrepre
sented Snyder, but covertly it has
stabbed him in the back.
The people have had their eyes open
ed by the revelations given them in
The Call as to the local newspaper
combination. All three of the papers
are now absolutely without influence.
They are simply looked upon as water
company organs, seeking to protect all
tools of the corporation in public office
and endeavoring to ruin and besmirch
any public officer who takes the side of
the people in the water contest.
The evidence that the water company
If not sincere in its claim that it is will
ing to dispose of its plant to the city
continues to accumulate. It is also evi
dent that certain members of the City
Council are conversant with the scheme
by which the corporation proposes to
hold on to the city plant after the ex
piration of the lease, and operate it.
These Councilmen are lending their aid
to cover up the water company's
tracks, but the foot prints are already
discernible.
The policy of the corporation 13 to
state that it will insist upon every
right guaranteed under the contract.
If that were all the company could
have it without any difficulty what
ever. The people are perfectly willing
and would in fact be overjoyed to give
the company every right the contract
calls for, and even more, but the cor
poration is seeking to get either two
million dollars more than it is entitled
to, ot secure a fifty-year renewal of its
lease.
The company is going ahead and
making improvements which are not In
any way in conformity with the plans
for a municipal water plant on file in
the City Engineer's office. When told
of the fact that the additions being
made are not in accordance with the
city's p.lans, the officers of the water
company insolently say they are in the
water business in this city and do not
propose to get out until they are good
and ready. This certainly does not look
very much as though the corporation
proposed to retire on the 22d of next
July.
So far the people have been rendered
powerless to do anything by the two
thirds majority in the Council, which
has voted against all measures tending
to deal with the water question in a
manly and businesslike way. These
seven Councilmen have permitted the
corporation to treat the city and its
authorities with contemptuous indif
ference. And this policy has been in
dorsed and approved by the combined
water .company press. Members of the
Council have claimed on the streets
that they intended to keep their
pledges as to municipal ownership, and
then have gone into the council cham
ber and voted with the water com
pany. For this they have been ap
plauded by the Times, Herald and Ex
press, anfr they are foolish enough to
think their constituents have been de
ceived.
Councilman F. M. Nickell is one of
these pretenders who has been called
down. The storm around Nlckell's
head has only just commenced to
gather. A proposition is now on foot
to call a meeting of the Democratic
and Populist City Central committees
and officially declare him a traitor to
the people and a man who has proved
himself false to the pledge upon which
he was elected.
The water company forces In the
Council are led and manipulated by
Councilman C. H. Toll from the bon
ton ward of the city. Toll is very
shrewd and makes but few false moves,
but his position is thoroughly under
stood by the people. If he had his say
there would not be another move taken
in the matter of municipal ownership.
There is one member of the Council
whom nobody can count â either the
people or the water company. That is
Councilman Z. D. Mathus of the
Third Ward. He says he is with the
people, but he has thus far voted with
the water company. There is no tell
ing where he is between votes. It
keeps the water company lieutenants
busy keeping him in line. The pres
sure is getting very strong. Mathus
is hearing from his constituents, and
it is possible he will any day be found
on the side of the people in the contest.
â  City Engineer Dockweiler has gone
into the contest in deadly earnest, and
he is giving aid and advice to the
Councilmen and other officials who are
struggling to get a victory for the peo
ple. The fact that the prospects are
decidedly improved for those who de
sire municipal ownership is the rea
son why the syndicated press is so de
sirous of diverting attention from the
great issue.
LIKE A NORTH
POLE CAVE WAS
HIS RESIDENCE
Bursting of Mains in an Unoccu
pied Dwelling Causes a
Transformation.
MOUNT VERNON, N. V., Feb. 2.â This State lays claim to the
oddest accident caused by the storm and cold snap. The mishap
ruined the interior of the handsomely furnished home of E. T. Paul, a
composer of music, the damage amounting to $5000.
Paul is a Southerner, not yet acclimated to the Northern cold, so
early this winter he and his family went South. H. M. Downing, a
real estate dealer, was left in charge of the property. Instructions to
shut off the water supply were, it appears, neglected by Paul. Down-
Ing thought of that this morning and visited the Paul house to see if
all was well. He got a big surprise the moment he opened the door.
A freezing blast, colder even than the wind outside, struck him. Then
he saw that the hallway looked like a miniature Chilcoot pass. Walls
were glazed, thick ice covered the carpet on the floor and immense
icicles were suspended from chandeliers. A bronze warrior holding a
lamp at the head of the stairway was frozen at his post.
Downing then p*ushed open the parlor door and brought a shower
of icicles upon his head. The apartment resembled an Arctic bower.
The portieres were frozen stiff in their folds, the piano was an ice
berg, and Jack Frost had touched all frames of pictures with icy pend-.
ants.
Paul's study, adjoining, might have been the den of Jack Frost
himself. Even the ink was frozen solid. The upper floors looked like
caverns of polar bears. Beds, bureaus, pictures and chairs were en
cased In ice. As for the cellar, it was a skating rink. There Is a floor
of ice a foot and a half thick therein.
This transformation of a Mt. Vernon dwelling into â % North Pole
cavern was caused by the freezing of water, which caused the pipes to
burst in all parts of the house. The force of the water in the mains
dislodged the ice and the water gushed and flooded the place from
cellar to garret. To-morrow men will be employed removing the ice.
SOME EVILS
OF ATHLETICS
Dr. Eliot Mentions the
Effect of Excessive
Training.
Says the Baseball and Rowing
Teams Were Clearly
Overworked.
Unlikely That Students Devoted to
Sports Can Win Standing as
Scholars.
Special Diapttcll to The Call.
BOSTON. Feb. 2.â The following are
the most striking sentences In that part
of the annual report of President
Charles W. Eliot, just issued, which
deals with athletics:
It is very unlikely that a student who
takes an active part In athletic sports
â¢â  can win good standing as a scholar, but,
on the other hand, a smaller proportion
of the athletes get put on probation in
Harvard College than any of the other
students. This remark is not true of
scientific students. The evil of excessive
training has not been cured.
The baseball team of last spring was
distinctly overworked and half the row
ins crew gave out in the four-mile race.
In all probability the nervou- strain
' resulting from prolonged training for
â  many exciting contests and an anxious
, sense of responsibility has not been tfuf
, noiently considered.
The use of Holmes field for games at
! tended by throngs of spectators was per
i mitted by the corporation for the last
i time in the spring- of 1897. Two long
i banks of seats with steel frames were
! erected temporarily on Holmes field, but
i were removed In the summer to Soldiers
â¢ field. One of these banks, situated on the
| south side of the track, caused a ter
n porary variation in the Intensity of the
; magnetic field in the Jefferson physical
laboratory, which was so disturbing that
it would not have been possible, with due
regard to the proper work of the labora
tory, to keep such a steel bank on
Holmes field.
The committee on the regulation of ath
letic sports gave much attention during
the year to the revision and publication
I of the rules governing athletics. Al
| most every one of these regulations has
been discussed and fought over for years.
And almost every one was at first re
sisted to the utmost by the main body
of the graduates. They have gradually
been adopted, at least on paper, by lead
ing Eastern colleges and universities, and
at present they commend themselves
very generally to the well-informed
friends of intercollegiate athletics.

THE PALO ALTO
DIAMOND FIELD
Unusual Interest in the
National Game This
Season.
Captain Jeffs' Injury Causes
His Retirement From the
Varsity Nine.
Class Games Arranged to Give the
Players Practice and Bring
Out New Men.
Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb.
2. â The Varsity baseball captaincy, left
vacant by the resignation of Captain !
Jeffs, whose knee, injured in last I
Thanksgiving football game, has made
his appearance on the diamond this
semester extremely doubtful, was filled
to-day, when the players unanimously
selected Bert Lougheed for the place.
There was some talk of Young, the
reliable first base man, allowine his
name to be presented, although Loug
heed had easily a -majority of the eieht
players entitled to vote.
Ex-Captain Jeffs was much affected
when, before the balloting took place,
he spoke to his men of the hard luck
which had forced him to resign. His
heart is in baseball and the for
tunes of the Stanford team. If his in
juries keep him off the field the whole
Beason the Varsity will suffer greatly,
for his place cannot be entirely sup
plied.
Bert Lougheed. the newly elected
captain, is a sophomore and the first
under-clasaman ever honored with the
captaincy. His position la at short
stop, where his great strength is in
the extent of ground that he covers.
Before coming to college he played
shortstop for the Tufts-Lyons aggre
gation. He is an English student and
hails from Los Angeles.
There is a lively spirit in baseball
this year and everything is being done
to keep up t,he interest. Class games
have been arranged to give the players
additional practice and bring out new
men. The freshmen will play the
Juniors on Monday, and the sopho
mores, last year's champions, will cross
bats with the seniors on "Wednesday.
The winners will decide the class head
ship the following week.
The faculty baseball nine, which has
already gone into training for its an
nual game with the senior class team,
crossed bats to-day with the Zeta Psi
fraternity nine. The game went
against the instructors by a score of
14 to 8. The faculty can console itself
with the fact that it was not repre
sented by its strongest team, and when
the match for which so much practic
ing is being done comes off the batting
strength of the professors will be in
creased by the addition of Dr. Jordan,
who is a heavy hitter.
In the practice game to-day Angel
and Richardson made up the battery
for the faculty. They have played to
gether several seasons and understand
each other well. Starbuck, McFarland,
Marx, Green, Fish and Murray played
the other positions. For the Zetas,
Bussy-and Smith did the battery work.
On this team were three promising
candidates for the 'varsityâ Wight,
Murphy and Rood.
Games will be arranged between the
other fraternity nines and the faculty
aggregation, so that when the try-out
with the seniors shall come the in
structors will have gained proper form.
The games will be played on the fac
ulty athletic grounds, which are beau
tifully located and in excellent shape.

Washington, Feb. 2.
The House, after three days spent on
the. District of Columbia appropriation
bill, mostly in political discussion,
passed the measure to-day and then
took up the bill to provide fortifications
and coast defenses for the country.
Several of the Democrats, notably Mc-
Clellan of New York, criticized the
measure because it cut down appro
priations for these works below what
has been appropriated in recent years.
At the opening of the session Grow (R.)
of Pennsylvania asked unanimous con
sent for the consideration of the resolu
tion directing the Secretary of War to
issue medals to 530 Pennsylvania soldiers
who belonged to the command which
passed through the mob at Baltimore,
April 19, IS6I, and who received the thanks
of Congress July 22, 1861. Hull, chairman
of the Military Affairs Committee, ob
jected. Several other requests for unani
mous consent met a similar fate.
The District bill was completed and
passed shortly after 3 o'clock, after which
the House took up the fortifications bill.
Hemenway (R.) of Indiana, in charge
of the bill, explained its provisions. The
estimate of the department for fortifica
tions and other works of defense, arma
ment, etc., were $13,378,571. while the
amount carried by the bill was but
$4,144,912. In discussing the harbor de
fense works erected under this policy
Hemenway stated that the defense of
New York harbor was complete. He quot
ed the chief of ordnance as having said
to him that not enough war vessels could
now enter the harbor in the face of the
present defense system to materially
damage the city. It was arranged that
the genera! debate should close to-morrow
at 3 o'clock.
Ferguson, delegate from New Mexico,
got the floor and under the latitude al
lowed for debate argued the injustice of
denying- statehood to New Mexico. He
said that if statehood were delayed all
the valuable land lately restored to the
public domain which could be selected by
the Territory, were she a State, for
school purposes would be gone. He ap
pealed for the passage of a bill allowing
the Territory to select the lands now.
Underwood (D.) of Alabama criticized the
fortifications bill because it ditl not pro
vide for the inauguration of defense
works at the harbors along the coast of
the Gulf of Mexico. Mobile harbor would
be the first harbor entered by the Spanish
fleet if we should become Involved in
war with Spain. McGlellan (D.) of New
York also criticized the bill.
At 5 p. m. the House adjourned.

HERE'S A RARE
RACING "STAR"
How Bookmaker Rosenberg
Scintillates in the Crook's
Heaven.
Offers the "Call" Money to Cut Down
Closing Odds on Little Cripple.
His Answer.
Joe Rosenberg is what is known as a
bookmaker on the races and does busi
ness in Oakland in conjunction with a
man named "Watson. In his own partic
ular little heaven Rosenberg scintillates
as a rival to Jupiter in the starry domo
above when it comes to warning an oft
gulled public that the proper cap^r in this
degenerate age is to stay away from thf>
poolrooms. It if a fact pretty commonly
admitted that the bookmakers have the
best of it at all times by long odds, but
here is a man who furnishes proof posi
tive that even when the tide goes against
them these ' peculiar-minded personages
have various ways of helping themselves
out of a hole.
Yesterday Little Cripple breasted the
wire at Ingleside a winner despite thÂ«
facts that the odds opened at 20 to 1 and
closed at 60 to 1 against him. Rosenberg
and his partner had $5 on the horse and ac
cordingly found themselves about to lose
$300. That is, they would lose that amount
in case nothing were done. But that is
just where the Rosenberg intellect shone
in all its pristine vigor. It is the custom
with all the bookmakers to pay according
to the closing odds published in The Call.
Rosenberg thought that if he could cor
rupt the racing writer all would b.e well.
Accordingly, he loft his saloon and cigar
stand on Broadway, Oakland, in care of
another person last evening and sought
The Call editorial rooms. He asked for a
private interview with the racing report
er and when it was granted sought a
secluded spot and spoke in this strain:
"Now. if The Call published thÂ« closinfr
odds as 60 I am in the hole just ?WO. Sup
pose a little typographical error creeps in
and the odds close at 30 that will save
me $150. Tf you will manage it I will
give you $25 and see that many of these
'snaps' fall into your hands."
Rosenberg was informed that the r^- %
porter would: see what could be done f> r -
him. When his eye roams over this com
position, unless one of those "little typo
graphical errors" has crept in, he will
sf>e thf> very best that could be done â for
the public, anyway.

The Secretary has â  also issued regu
lations concerning the navigation of the

a river or sea-going vessel from a
port in the United States, except. an
other port in Alaska, or from any for

TO DAWSON FROM
PUGET SOUND IN
JUST ONE WEEK
Construction of the Railway to
Teslin Will Make the Trip
an Easy One.
NEW YORK, Feb. Iâ An Ottawa, Ont.. special to the Herald says: The
Canadian Parliament, which meets to-morrow, will he asked to nanctlon
without delay tho Government bill for the oonntructlon of a railway from
Glenora. or Telegraph Crock, on Stlckeen River, to Tealln Lake, a distance
of ISS miles. The road, which le to be completed by November, will be the
first railway maklnK for the Klondike. It will, when completed, form part
of on International route that will be opened as soon as navigation is pos
sible In the Stlckeen. Ocean steamers will sail every two or three days
from Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia, to Fort Wrangel, in Alas
ka, and transfer passengers and freight to river steamers running from
Wrangel up Stlckeen River to Telegraph Creek, 125 miles from "Wran
gel. This route has been selected by the Canadian Government as the
shortest and best route to the gold fields.
The total distance from Vancouver to Dawson by this route 1b 1550
miles. It Is an all-water route except for 135 miles of wagon road between
Glenora and Teslin Lake.
When the railroad over that section Is finished it will be possible to
reach Dawson from Vancouver or Victoria in a week with no greater
amount of discomfort than Is experienced on a voyage across the Atlan
tic. On this route, which Is in Canadian territory, Canadian duties, which
average 30 per cent, will be levied under the supervision of mounted police
on all goods bought outside of Canada. Rates on the railway will be regu
lated by the Dominion Government and will be reduced 25 per cent at the
end of three years.
The Canadian Parliament will not grant a charter to any competitive
railway from any point on the International boundary for a period of five
years; The contract provides that the contractors shall keep the exlÃting
wagon road in good repair until such time as the railway shall be run
ning and afford ever}' facility for transportation of passengers and freight.
Mr. Sifton, the Canadian Minister of the Interior, spent some weeks
last year in the Northwest Territory and selected the route via Wrangel,
Glenora and Teslin because, in his judgment.lt Is the easiest of the lot, and
also because from Teslin Lake, and even from Glenora, it traverses a coun
try known to be full of rich placer diggings.
ALASKAN RATE
WAR PROBABLE
Western Roads Ignored
by the Canadian
Pacific.
May Sever All of Their Traffic
Agreements With That
Company.
Other Transcontinental Tariffs Likely
to Be Affected by the
Competition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Feb. 2.â Unless the Can
adian Pacific alters the attitude it has
assumed toward the western roads in
the matter of Alaska rates it is possi
ble that there will be a concerted
movement among all the American
roads to ignore it entirely and tq re
fuse to have any further dealings with
it in passenger traffic. It has steadily
refused to meet with the American
roads to discuss matters, and simply
relterates its determination to pre
serve Its differentials on Alaska busi
ness.
The meeting of the Western roads,
after a short session to-day, sent a
message to the Canadian Pacific say
ing that if 1t was Inconvenient for a
representative of the Canadian Pacific
to come to Chicago at the present time
they would be glad to have the Cana
dian Pacific name a date on which its
representative could meet a committee
of the Western roads either in Mon
treal or New York. To this a reply
was received to-day after the adjourn
ment of the meeting to the effect that
it would not be convenient for the
Canadian Pacific to meet the commit
tee of the Western roads.
After the adjournment of the meet
ing to-day representatives of the West
ern roads said that they felt that they
had done all that lay in their power to
come to an understanding with the
Canadian Pacific, but if that road
would not consent to meet and discuss
matters with them there was nothing
to do but sever all traffic relations with
it. They said that they were not think
ing of doing this in a belligerent spirit,
but simply to protect themselves.
The meeting to-morrow will take up
the matter and decide what is best to
be done. As matters now stand there
seems to be very little chance of avoid
ing a war in Alaskan rau-s. and if this
is once begun there is every probabil
ity: that it will spread to the other
.transcontinental rates as well.
The committees appointed to consid
er th^ question of reduced rates for the
North American Turners' convention,
to be held at Sun Francisco on July 6.
the tenth triennial council of Congre
gational churches, to be held at Port
land. Or., on July 7-13, and the Nation
al convention'of the Women's Christian
Temperance Union, to be held at Los
Angeles in November, have recom
mended that, while it is the general
desire to be in a position to make suit
able excursion rates for these occa
sions, consideration thereof be post
poned pending action on the antl-scalp
tng bill now before Congress, the pass
age of which should make it possible
to simplify ticketing arrangements and
permit of the granting of other conces
sions in the way of dates of sale, limits,
stopovers, etc., which, under existing
conditions, are impracticable.
The officials of the Wisconsin Cen
tral deny that that road has made any
arrangement with the Canadian Paci
fic regarding the interchange of pas
rencrer traffic at St. Paul. They de
flare that the deal has never been con
templated, and that It has been set In
circulation by competitors of the road
with the hope of destroying the eor
diaJ relations existing between the Wls
( orpin Central and the Great Northern
and the Northern Pacific.

THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1898.
CANADA WILL
LEVY TRIBUTE
A Klondike Complication
That May Lead to
Trouble.
Disputed Territory Between
Lakes Linderman and
Bennett.
Protest of a Seattle Merchant to Be
Laid Before the Secretary
of the Treasury.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 2.â The action of the
Canadian Government in placing cus
toms officers on disputed territory en
route to the Klondike gold fields gives
promise of causing early complications.
An international controversy will no
doubt result In consequence of inform
ation that now comes from Lakes Ben
nett and Linderman.
In a letter from A. C. Vandoren to the
Seattle Chamber of Commerce he calls
attention to the fact that there are
parties occupying the land between
Lake Linderman and Lake Bennett â
Messrs. McLeod and Sullivan â who
claim to have a grant from the Cana
dian Government of all the land lying
between these two lakes. The writer
then goes on to state:
"The distance between the lakes Is
about three-quarters of a mile. On
the west bank of the creek the land is
mountainous. On the east bank it is
comparatively level for a mile or more,
and it is here that they make their
claims to the land. There are station
ed here four officers or the Canadian
customs service, and it is rumored that
it is their intention to collect duty at
this point. Now the Americans claim
that the boundary line crosses Lake
Bennett four miles north of this point,
commonly spoken of as the head of the
lake or the portage, and I write par
ticularly for advice whether you think
it advisable to resist the payment of
duty here. There are a number of
Americans going 1 into business, and we
do not feel disposed to pay duty on dis
puted territory. I am establishing a
trading post, where I will carry a large
line of general merchandise, aggre
gating probably $30 000 or $40,000, and
the question of duty is a matter of
serious importance. '
Mr. Vandoren further states that as
th<Â» business men of the "Portage,"
with scarcely an exception, will be citi
zen? of the United States, they are ex
ceedingly desirous of having the ter
ritory referred to declared American
8011. Mr. Vandoren also asks for an
opinion as to the advisability of resist
ing the payment of duty. The matter
will at once be laid before' Secretary
Gage.
GERMAN PEOPLE DO
NOT LIKE THE DECREE.
Poor Customers Deprived of Apples
That Are Both Cheap and
Good.
LONDON. Feb. 3.â The Berlin cor
respondents of the morning papers are
all skeptical as to the alleged reason
for the exclusion of American fresh
fruit. They doubt that the cause is the
discovery of a bug in a box of apples
in South Germany. The exclusion is
attributed rather to the agrarian de
mand for reprisals against the Ameri
can tariff. The decision has caused the
greatest surprise and considerable dis
satisfaction, for American apples had
rapidly taken the German markets by
storm owing to their cheapness and
fine quality, and the poor consumers
cannot afford to buy fine French or
Italian fruit. Furthermore, it will be
a severe blow to commerce and ship
ping. The decree permits importation
only r,n condition that the fruit is ex
ported to England.
The Berlin National Zeitung defends
the prohibition, if danger such as phyl
loxera exists. It declares, nevertheless,
that promises to the agricultural pop
ulation of all manner of blessings from
the legal and administrative enhance
ment of the prices of provisions are
not calculated to Induce them to make
the efforts which will be equally useful
to consumers and agriculturists alike.
The opposition German papers con
sider that the proposed Brussels sugar
conference will be futile under such
conditions.

United States Embassador
White Sends a Strong
Remonstrance.
CAUSE OF THE DECREE.
The Pretext Given Is That Vermin
Infests the Product of Califor
nia's Orchards.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Feb. 2.â The Prus
sian Minister of Finance, Dr.
Miguel, issued a decree yester
day, which goes into effect im
mediately, prohibiting the impor
tation of every kind of American
fresh fruit. The decision has
been sent to all the German
ports and frontier stations,
excepting those in Bavaria, Sax
ony and Wurtemberg. The
United States Embassy was not
previously warned, and the
United States Embassador, Mr.
White, sent a formal letter to
the Foreign Office to-day, in
quiring upon what authority
this inimical step was taken.
The United States Consul at
Hamburg, Dr. Hugh Pitcalrn,
telegraphs that 16,000 barrels of
American apples have been for
bidden to be unloaded, and that
two trains full of American
fruit have also been forbidden
to cross the frontier at Emer
ich, which, aside from Ham
burg, Is the principal place of
entry for American fruit.
On receipt of this news, Mr.
White sfnt a second and
stronger remonstrance to the
Foreign Office, calling attention
to the evident violation of the
treaty.
At the Foreign Office it was
learned that the Prussian Gov
ernment prohibits the entry of
American fruit on sanitary
grounds, claiming that Califor
nia vermin threatens German
trees and fruit.
â¦ â¦
Call Office, .Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 2
The officials of the Agricultural De
partment have as yet received no infor
mation on the subject. They are dis
posed to believe the explanation that
Importations of fresh fruit will be pro
hibited because of danger from vermin
is not a sincere one, but that Germany,
having In mind the recent legislation
of the American Government imposing
a duty on bounty paid sugar, has taken
this action as a sort of retaliation. G.
B. Brackett, chief of the pomological
division of the department, in discuss
ing the dispatch, said:
"It is surprising that any charge
should be made that California fruit is
infested with pests. The fruit from
that State is the freest from vermin of
any in the whole world. She has strin
gent laws against the introduction, of
insect pests and diseases,' and has a
corps of inspectors who examine all
nursery stock before it is permitted to
be imported. There is little or no
ground for the assertion that American
fruit shipped abroad is unsanitary. The
pests from which American apples suf
fer are the larvae of the codlin moth,
which is believed to pass into a worm,
and also apple maggots.
"The possibility of any harm from
these pests in apples shipped abroad is,
however, very remote. Especially is
this the case with Germany, because
very few of our apples, which have
been shipped to Europe for the past
twenty-five years, go to that country.
Our fruit is not inspected before it is
exported, though thf natural assump
tion is that dealers pick out the
choicest before sending it away, in or
der that the reputation may be'kept up.
"Apples are the only fresh fruits
which are shipped to Europe at this
time of the year. Peaches and oranges
have been sent mostly as an experi
ment, and they go mainly to England.
The growth of the shipment of apples
abroad has been enormous in the last
sixteen years. In 1880-81 the shipments
amounted to 1,328.800 barrels, while in
1897-98 they aggregated 2,919.840 bar
rels. Of this aggregate 111,090 barrels,
valued at 5213,482, were shipped to
Hamburg, the remaining number,
with the exception of, approximately,
100.000 barrels, going to English ports.
Of course, it is likely that some of the
fruit which Is sent to England reaches
Germany indirectly, though there are
no statistics on hand to give the
amount. On the\basls of the indicated
shipments to Hamburg, it is evident
that the loss to America by the prohi
bition of the importation, as stated,
wnuld not be as great as if this prohi
bition should apply to all Europe.
"The fact of this whole matter is
that we are the ones who should be
protected, for nearly all the insects in
our fruits have been imported from
foreign countries."
NOTHING MORE THAN A
RETALIATORY MEASURE.
Congressmen Say Germany's Pre
text as to California Fruit
Is Bidiculous.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â The Berlin
cable announcing that Germany has
closed her ports against American
fruits attracted much attention among
members of the House of Representa
tives. Mr. Hitt. chairman of the Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs, expressed
surprise at the step taken, particularly
because it was not preceded by a no
tice to our representative at Berlin.
Without discussing the motives of the
movement Hltt said it was evident
Germany based her course on sanitary
grounds, which would exclude the idea
that the move was of a political and
proscriptive character. Hltt felt that
our authorities would take steps to
learn whether any sanitary evil could
be attributed to the condition of the
fruit crop in California, and, if this
was established in cne negative, he
had no doubt a courteous but firm
representation would be made to the
German Government with a view to
showing that its action had been taken
without a sufficient inquiry into the
facts. He expressed hope that this
was not a step in Germany's retalia
tory policy which had been referred to
in recent utterances by distinguished
German officials.
Others members of the House For
eign Affairs Committee expressed the
view that this was a part of Ger
many's retaliatory attitude toward the
United States. Representative Alden
Smith of Michigan, a member of the
committee, said:
"The attempted exclusion of Ameri
can fruit from the German markets at
Emmerich is not the first act of hos
tility displayed by Germany. Under the
Cleveland administration, when our
markets were open to German exports,
they dealt very unfairly with this
country, excluding our beef from the
markets of Germany on the false pre
text that it was unwholesome, when
they knew our inspection laws were
rigid and that Great Britain's law was
equally so; and yet we exported large
quantities of beef to England without
the slightest objection on the part of
that Government. Their present course
is unfair and unjustifiable from any
standpoint and should be rebuked."
Representative Barlow, who repre
sents the Sixth California District, one
of the great fruit districts of the State,
said that so far as California fruit was
concerned, the German decree prohibit
ing the importation of American fruit
was a mere pretext.
"California fruits," he said, "are sin
gularly free from vermin or disease of
any kind. So jealous are our people In
their desire to keep our fruits free from
disease that the delegation from the
State is now advocating the passage of
a bill which was introduced in the
House by Mr. Castle some time ago,
providing for an inspection of all fruits,
plants, cuttings, shrubs, etc., imported
into this country. I look upon the j
ground given for Dr. Miguel's decree
aa a mere subterfuge. No doubt exists
in my mind that it is purely a retalia
tory measure."
"The reason advanced by the German
Foreign Office," said Representative Hil
born of California, "is the thinnest kind
of a pretext. Nowhere in the world is
fruit so free from disease as in Cali
fornia and nowhere is there more care
taken to keep it free from disease of all
kinds. We do not even allow fruit to |
come into the State from other States
without inspection."
Other members of the California dele
gation expressed similar views.
Chairman Dingley looked over the
Berlin cable and said: "This is evi
dently a device to prohibit the impor
tation of American fruits on alleged
sanitary grounds, in line with the simi
lar prohibition of American pork. The
importation seems to be prohibited on
sanitary grounds, in order to evade the
provisions of commercial treaties with
Germany which give to imports from
the United States equal privileges with
imports from other countries. There is
not the slightest ground fuT the allega
tion that California fruits are affected
as charged; indeed, the evidence is con
clusive that they are especially free
from parasites. The United States
would have much more ground for pro
hibiting the importation of German
wines on alleged sanitary grounds than
Germany has to pro-hibit the importa
tion of American fruit or American
pork on such grounds.
"We have no objection to Germany
putting whatever duty it sees fit on
imports of any kind. That is her own
business. But when that Government j
undertakes to prohibit the importation
of American products on sanitary
grounds which do not exist in fact, it
violates the spirit of our commercial
treaties with that country. The Presi
df-nt, under the act of 1890. has author
ity to meet just such discrimination as
this."
Dingley called attention to the fol
lowing provision now in force and ap
plicable to the present case:
Section 5. That whenever the President
shall be satisfied that unjust discrimina
tions are made by or under the authority
of any foreign state against the importa
tion to or sale in such foreign state of
any product of the United States he may
direct that such products of such foreign
states discriminating against any prod
uct of the United States as he may deem
proper shall be excluded from importa
tion to the United States. In such case
he shall make proclamation of his direc
tion in the premises and therein name the
time when such direction against impor
tation shall take effect, and after such
date the importation of the articles
named in such proclamation shall be un
lawful. The President may at any time
revoke, modify, terminate or' renew any
such direction as in his opinion the public
interests may require.
Senator Mills of Texas expressed the
opinion that Germany's action was the
logical sequence of our high tariff sys
tem.
"I should not like to see American in
terests suffer," he said, "but we cannot
expect anything else under the circum
stances."
Senator Bacon of Georgia also
thought the prohibition one of tlie re
sults of our tariff system.
"They have the power," he said, "and
I see nothing we can do to prevent
their exercising it."
Senator Elkins said: "We may just
as well have it out with Germany now
as at any other time. There is no de
nying that we are In a commercial
war, and we should fight it out on the
lines they have laid down. I should go
back at them on their own terms. I
should prohibit the importation of their
sugar."
Senator Hawley pronounced the
news very surprising and disagreeable,
but Vie was opposed to harsh measures
on the part of this country.
"We could retllate by prohibiting the
importation of German cutlery," he
said.
Senator Hansbrough also opposed re
taliation, saying Germany would think
better of her course hereafter. Sena
tor Gear expressed the opinion that
Germany's action was due to fear of
the San Jose scale, which is, he said,
coming to be considered very danger
ous. Senator McÃride of Oregon says
he is confident that the discrimination
of Germany is not occasioned by the
condition of Oregon fruit, for it has
always he-Id a high place. He says that
methods of retliation can 'easily be
found if desired by the United States.
Bepresentaive Maguire of California
late in the afternoon lntrouduced in the
House a resolution calling upon the
State Department for all information
or correspondence between this Gov
ernment and Prussia relative to the
decree forbidding the importation of
American fruit, as follows:
Whereas. It is reported that the Prus
sian Government has peremptorily pro
hibited the importation of all kinds of
American fresh fruits; and, whereas,
it is vitally important to the fruit-grow
ing industry of the United States that the
cause of this embargo be ascertained,
and, if possible, speedily removed: there
fore, be it
Resolved. That the Secretary of State
be and is hereby requested, if consistent
with the public interests, to furnish the
House of Representatives all correspond
ence between the Government of the
United States and the Government of
Prussia on the subject of the exclusion of
American fresh fruits from the ports and
from the territory of Prussia.
Mr. Magulre says: "The Prussian
edict excluding American fresh fruits
is undoubtedly a measure of commer
cial retaliation. There is no foundation
for It in the condition of California or
other American fruits. Our tariff legis
lation has been distinctly and purpose
ly hostile to German interests in our
commerce with that country. They
naturally feel that it is just to meet
our embargo on their trade by similar
embarrassments of our producers in
tradine with the x>eoole of Prussia."
LOANED MONEY
TO SWINDLERS
Cashier of the Chemical
National Bank Vic
timized.
Nearly a Half Million Dollars
Lost by the New York
Concern.
The Official Believed to Have Been
Mentally Irresponsible for
Months.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2.â William J.
Quinlan Jr., cashier of the Chemical
National Bank, has resigned his posi
tion. He asknowledged in a letter to
the directors that he ha.d loaned $393,
000 of the bank's money without con
sulting the president, and knowing the
directors would not approve of the ac
tion. He denies that he profited by the
loans.
The loans made by Mr. Quinlan were
on Western securities of various kinds
and were negotiated by Francis Grable,
a promoter of land, mining and irri
gation schemes, and John S. Silver,
who is connected with the New York
Carbon Company.
"In my opinion," said President Will
iams, of the Chemical National, "Mr.
Quinlan has been the victim of clever
schemers. I believe that he has been
mentally irresponsible for many
months, though there was nothing ap
parent in his actions to betray this to
us.
"Mr. Quinlan had known- Mr. Grable
for some time, and six weeks ago,
when the latter asked for a loan of
$5000 to help along some scheme of his,
Mr. Quinlan gave it to him. Then
came another loan of $5000, which was
also granted. Next Silver was brought
into the deal. Then, to save the loan
first made, Mr. Quinlan made another
loan of an equal amount, and to save
that he gave them another.
"I was simply dumfounded.- I had
never before had the slightest sus
picion but that Mr. Quinlan was all
right mentally. Then I realized some
thing must be wrong or he would never
have loaned money to Grable & Silver
or have advanced even the most trivial
sums on the security they had given
him. I examined it and decided It was
almost worthless and made up my mind
that* the bank would lose every cent it
had advanced.
"Mr. Quinlan combated this Idea.
He still insisted that the security was
good and would fully cover the amount
he had loaned. I was not ab>e to per
suade him otherwise and at last told
him he must resign and do this at once
in a letter to the directors. He was
fearfully broken up by my decision,
but did as I to-ld him. The letter was
written Monday and briefly states the
cause. Then, when It had been given
to the directors, Mr. Quinlan left the
bank for his home in Brooklyn. I sup
pose he is there now."
Mr. Williams added: "We have
charged off nearly the whole of the
loans to our profit and loss although
we are satisfied that we shall recover a
large part of the money eventually."

FORT WRANGEL, Alaska, Jan. 29
(via Seattle, Wash., Feb. 2.â Tha
steamer Oregon of the Portland-Alask*
line, on her way to Alaska, anchored
off Lewis Island yesterday and rescued
the passengers of the wrecked Corona,
who were not taken off by the Al-Ki
last Thursday. The sea was choppy
and a fresh breeze was blowing from
the direction of Dixons Entrance, but
the transfer of men, women, children
and personal baggage was made with
expedition. One ship's boat, which was
in charge of the second officer of tha
Oregon, drifted about four miles down
the straits and was not picked up fop
five hours. The occupants, several
men and Mrs. Ed Foster and her babe,
suffered considerably from the cold.
They were well nigh exhausted.
About fifty of the Corona's passen
gers . were left on the island. They
would not go on the Oregon unless Cap
tain Stephens would agree to take all
their baggage, outfits and animal*.
They had about 25 tons, of supplies on
the beach. As it would take several
days to take all the stun" aboard Cap
tain Stephens would not comply with
the request. The people left on the
island are well supplied with provis
ions, tents and bedding. They will
probably stay there until some boat
comes along and picks them up.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.âSena
tor White of California continued
his speech in opposition to the
Hawaiian annexation treaty in
the executive session of the Sen
ate to-day, amid many interrup
tions and much cross-fire. In the
main his speech was a continua
tion of the argument on consti
tutional lines, which was begun
yrsterday, but he also took up
questions of the practical pur
port in to-day's speech and un
dertook to show that for reasons
of commerce and defense the ac
quisition of the islands would be
unwise.
Call Office. RlÃgs House. ;
Washington. Feb. 2.
Previous to Mr. White's speech the ;
Senate, in executive session, spent
about three-quarters of an hour in |
legislative session, with the doors j
closed, trying to decide whether Sena- :
tor Pettigrew's resolution concerning |
the acquisition of territory which;
would require a navy to defend should ',
be discussed in open executive see- â 
sion. When the vote was taken the ]
majority was found to be against the
proposition for open sessions.
When Senator White resumed the .
floor he continued his citation of au- ,
thoritles to show that the policy of this
country in the past has really .been j
against the annexation of the Ha- i
waiian Islands. He reviewed most of
the documents quoted by Senator Mor- j
. gan as favorable to annexation of the '
Islands for the purpose of showing that j
they were all favorable to Hawaiian In
dependence, but not to Hawaiian an
nexation.
Senator White then took up the con
tention that the control of Honolulu)
was necessary to the defense of the j
Nicaraguan canal and asserted that j
there was no foundation to support it, j
and gave figures to show that in case j
a defense of the canal became necfis- j
sary by this country it would be de
fended from either San Diego or San
Francisco, and not from Honolulu. He
said no enemy could use Honolulu as
a base of supplier in case of war with j
the United States, because the modern j
war vessel does not carry enough coal
to make the round trip and to delay for
hostile purposes. He quoted Ad
miral Belknap to the effect that Hono
lulu could be fortified effectually and {
General Schofield to the effect that it
could not be fortified at all by land
defense, which shows that the authori
ties differ. He contended that if one of
the islands should be fortified all of
them should be, and that it would re
quire an Immense navy to remain
there permanently, while the acquisi
tion of this teritory would not diminish
the expense to fortifications and main
taining a navy at home. The Senator
challenged any one to produce proof of
hostile intentions on the part of Eng- j
land. Japan, Germany or any other
power, and cited the declaration of
various statesmen from each country |
denying any desire to interfere in any
manner with the United States.
"The whole scheme for the annexa
tion of Hawaii," he said, "is baaed i
on sentimentality and sugar," and, '
continuing this line of presentation, he ,
Bald that the sugar people who were |
netting eight or nine millions a year ;
under the reciprocity treaty were back !
of the annexation project, with the
hope of making the benefits now de
rived from reciprocity perpetual. If it
were not, he said, for this condition |
of affairs the treaty would never have I
been heard 01. and hence he charged '
that "the patriotism of Senators was J
being imposed upon to consummate a
most disgraceful proposition."

White were Hoar. Teller, Morgan,
Hale, Chandler, Wolcott and Tillman.
Senator Hoar's interruption brought
on a prolonged debate, in which seve
ral Senators participated and which
for a time threatened to divert the dis
cussion from the lines which Senator
White evidently desired . to pursue.
The Massachusetts Senator's questions
related to the Japanese on the inlands
and the complication growing out of
their presence there.
To this White replied that the pres
ent Hawaiian Government was im
porting contract laborers under a pro
vision which goes to the extent of per
mitting their imprisonment. He as
serted that since the trouble occurred,
a few months since, which resulted in
refusing permission to 700 Japanese to
land on the islands, over 2000 had been
brought in under contract. This prac
. tice he denounced as hypocritical.
Senator Tillman of South Carolina
â  came into the debate, making some as
sertions which created a breezy stir
for a few minutes. The South Caro
lina Senator referred to the recent
Hawaiian revolution and to what he
termed the effort of the Republican
; party to establish a Government in
' the interest of the white people of the
; islands, when they numbered only
one out of thirty inhabitants, and in
' this connection referred to the reor
ganization of party lines in the South
after the war.
"We were then," he said, "in South
j Carolina attempting to establish a
white man's government. The Repub- I
j Mean party interfered with us then, or
; attempted to do so, professing to hold
! opinions about the sacred rights of the |
j majority to rule. I should like to know j
whether the .Republican party has !
changed its opinion on this subject of |
the right of the white man to rule, for j
if it has and will extend it to the i
Southern States I will vote for the
I treaty."
"The distinguished Senator from
! South Carolina evidently know 3 all I
j about the effort to re-establish the
! white man's party in the South after >
! the war and could doubtless give us j
1 much interesting information on that j
point." said Senator Chandler.
"I do know, something about it," re- I
sponded Mr. Tillman, "and I know that
there was some cheating and some
i shooting in those times, as there prob
ably was in Hawaii."
"The Senator from South Carolina
would, I hardly think," Interrupted
Senator Hoar, "say in open session
what he has here said."
"I am willing to say it anywhere,"
! said Mr. Tillman.
"I want the same policy all along the
j line. Throw open the doors and I will
say what I have said before the entire
world."
Probably the most significant occur
rence of the day was 'the fact that Sen
ator Morrlll, who has, during his en
tire career, been exceedingly conserva
tive on the question of executive ses
sions of the Senate, took a position in
favor of open sessions on the Pettigrew
resolution. He gave as Tiis reason the
fact that the speeches for and against
the treaty were liable to be unevenly
reported with the press excluded from
the session. ,
Mr. White did not conclude and will
I continue his speech to-morrow.

Seeks to Dodge a Requisition
Coming From the Lone
Star State.
Secures His Release, but Is Rearreated
and Will Be Turned Over
if Possible.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 2.â Fred Vernon
Graham Is making the fight of his life
to regain his liberty before Sheriff A.
E. Hughes of Grayson County, Texas,
can reach here and take him into cus
tody. Graham Is wanted at Sherman,
Texas, for what are said to be exten
sive forgeries. He came here three
months ago, giving the name of Ver
non, by which he was known until his
arrest last night. He rented a house
on Yakima avenue, furnished it ele
gantly and has spent money lavishly,
though having no regular employment.
His whereabouts was probably dis
closed through letters written by
Graham himself, for the Texas author
ities notified Sheriff Mills of even his
house address here.
Graham was arrested at home last
evening after being completely identi
fied by the Texas description. Thifc
was easily done by reason of a scar
three inches long on his neck, under
the right ear. Graham claims it is a
case of mistaken identity, but the offi
cers' certainty that they have the
right man is strengthened by Mrs.
Graham's remark when he was arrest
ed that "We'll have to go back to
Texas now."
This afternoon Graham secured his
release in the Superior Court on a
writ of habeas corpus. He was imme
diately rearrested on a warrant sworn
out of the Justices' Court, on which he
can be detained two days. He will
fight this warrant, but If necessary
still another warrant will be secured.
To make certain of keeping him Sheriff
Hughes, who left Texas for Tacoma
last night, has been requested to wire
his warrant here to-night. On request
of the Texas authorities Governor
Rogers to-day directed Sheriff Mills to
hold hts prisoner if possible until the
requisition from Texas can get here.
That Graham's criminal opreations
in Texas were extensive Is indicated by
the fact that the Merchants' and Plant
ers' Bank and prominent citizens of
Sherman are pushing their efforts to
capture him. Thomas Randolph, presi
dent of the bank, writes that Graham
should have several thousand dollars
about him, and that If the officers can
recover any of it they will be rewarded.
Graham is 37 years old, of dark com
plexion and wears a mustache and
whiskers. He formerly lived at Green
ville, Texas, going from there to Sher
man, where he was deputy county clerk
for one year. Letters from Texas state
that while holding this position his rep
utation for honesty was unblemished.
Somewhat later came his trouble and
hasty departure. He is an abstractor
by profession, but is said to have prac
ticed law in Kansas. He was brought
up in Quincy, 111., and lived subse
quently In Missouri, Kansas and In
dian Territory. Three years ago in In
dian Territory he was married to Miss
Lulu Pyeatt, a beautiful brunette, and
they have a baby sixteen months old.
Mrs. Graham was greatly discom
fited by her husband's arre6t, and
pleaded with the officers not to put him
in Jail, but despite her entreaties he
was led away. The Texas letters state
that Graham gambles, but inqiry dis
closes that he spent most of his time
here at home. Sheriff Hughes should
arrive in San Francisco to-morrow and
here Saturday night Every effort wfll
be made to keep Graham in custody till
then.

Insolvency.
In Debt $10,000 Deep,

Has Up to Date Trodden a Path
Not Thickly Strewn With
Rose Leaves.
TWICE ASKS DIVORCE.
Her Second Marriage and the Trouble
It Made for Her Among Her
Relatives.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARTINEZ, Feb. 2.â The name of
Clemishlre is not an unfamiliar one. It
has been in the papers before now.
Many will remember Jack Clemishire,
known as one who spent his money
freely, was an elegant dresser, got
horsewhipped at Pleasanton and was in
1896 sued for divorce on bo many
grounds that specification here need
not be attempted.
Now, after a comfortable absence
from the papers for months, the name
appears again. This time Clemlshire
himself is vaguely in the background,
and the central figure is Rosalie L.
Clemishlre, who is in financial troubles.
Some of her creditors axe mentioned as
having a lively prospect of experien
cing similar troubles. She has filed a
petition in insolvency. As to assets she
has wearing apparel upon which is
placed the modest estimate of $26, while
her. liabilities are $10,000. To the First
National Bank of Oakland she owes
$8500 on a deficiency judgment on a
mortgage foreclosure, to Philip Kolf
of Pleasanton $750, to the Garden City
Bank of San Jose, on a note indorsed
by'her sister Augusta Younger of San
Jose, $500; to Elisha Harlan of San Ra
mon $250.
The path of Rosalie has not exactly
been strewn with roÃes. Several years
ago she was married at San Jose to a
dentist named Jenkins. For a time all
went well and then nothing went well.
The divorce court was sought, she al
leging cruelty and getting her decree.
It was an interesting trial and accounts
of it occupied considerable space. She
then took up her abode at the home of
her brother and sister, where she re
mained for some time. When away on
a pleasure trip she met Jack Clemishtre
and afterward was married to him. Her
brother, Ed Younger, objected to the
union, but to no avail, arid this caused
a breach between brother and sfster.
Afterward Rosalie went to the home
place near San Jose to get some of her
belongings. Ed objected to her coming
on account of this marriage to Cleml
shire, and ordered her away. Trouble
of a startling nature ensued, terminat
ing in a general fight. Rosalie swore
out a complaint in the Police Court
charging her brother with battery. Aft
erward Rosalie and her husband went
away and nothing more had been heart!
of them locally until the petition of
insolvency was filed, although they
have had misunderstandings which
took them into the courts of other
counties, and led to her application for
a second divorce.
The number of students who were en
gaged during the year in the various
sports for which a physical examination
is required was approximately 479, ex
cluding the sport of lawn tennis. It Is
impossible to etate with any degree of
accuracy the number of students actu
ally taking a serious part in the sports.
There were at one time 365 men under
Lathrop's charge practicing for track
athletics, not including bicycling, but the
number examined for that sport, includ
ing bicycling, was 18& There were at one
time at least 195 men playing baseball,
but the number examined was only 93.
It is probable that from 600 to 700 men
took part in the out-of-door sports
named, and it is certain that many oth
ers played tennis often.
Attorney J. R. Aitken, legal adviser
to Mrs. Rosalie Cleminshire, gave his
opinion as to the cause of her insol
vency in the following words:
"The principal reason why my client
has applied for papers of insolvency,"
said Aitken, "is that she has been har
assed by the Bank of Oakland and
numerous other creditors for money
that she Is entirely unable to pay at
present, and in view of this fact she
has applied to the courts for an appli
cation which will declare her insolvent
and satisfy those who at present hold
claims against her that she is not pos
sessed of a single penny or Its equiva
lent valuation in worldly goods."
Mr. Aitken emphatically denies that
he knows anything of Mrs. Clemln
shlre's past history or the vast inherit
ance which was left to her at the death
of her father, Colonel Younger of San
Jose.
He said he neither knew the woman
nor heard of her until she called at his
office on a professional visit, and pleads
ignorance of the face that she publicly
horsewhipped a former lover of hers,
which brought her name before the
public in a series of newspaper articles
which were published at the time.
"All that I can say regarding the
financial resources of my client," said
Aitken, "is that she is at present with
out a penny in the world and haa ap
plied for insolvency papers that she
might clear herself of the $10,000 of de
ficiency debts held against her by the
Bank of Oakland, a banking firm at
San Jose and two other firms located
at Pleasanton, and start afresh in the
world by trying to recuperate her lost
fortune by raising chickens at Marti
nez."
Although the attorney said this with
a degree of positiveness he refused to
permit his assertion to be quoted as a
truth emanating from him and merely
said that it was nothing &ut an Im
pression formed by him from the con
versation that took place between him
self and his client when she was In
this city.
Another Impression which reflects
upon the present condition of Mrs.
Cleminshire's affairs is that Mr. Aitken
was in doubt as to whether Colonel
Younger was dead or alive and as to
whether Mrs. Clemlnshire had ever re
ceived her share of the estate at San
Jose.
He pleads ignorance to everything
concerning Mrs. Cleminshire's insol
vency except the fact that he received
h's fee for filing the necessary applica
tion papers in the Martinez courts.

SANTA ROSA, Feb. 2.â The
inquest over the body of the late
Thomas L. Thompson, whose
suicide at his home in this city
yesterday spread sorrow and re
gret throughout the State, was
held this afternoon, and from the
evidence produced there oan be
no question that the distin
guished diplomat for several
days prior to Viis death was a
victim of insanity.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 2.â When Coro
ner Tom Young of Healdsburg arrived
at the courthouse to-day and prepared
to begin the Thompson inquest there
was an air of melancholy and sorrow
in the very atmosphere that surround
ed the noble pile, and as the sad de
tails of the untimely and deeply re
gretted death of the ex-Congressman
were told to the jury many an eye
was wet and more than one lip quiver
ed at the thought that the harrowing
facts related to one who had often
shown his friendship and proved â¢ his
worth in no uncertain manner.
The first witness . was Robert A.
Thompson, brother of the suicide, who
said substantially:
"After my brother had gone up the
stairs I stepped into the parlor to await
hiH return. I do not believe that I
waited in that room more than two or
three minutes when I heard one of the
girls say: 'Papa is vomiting and must
be sick at the stomach.' Rushing up
the stairs as fast as I could I burst
into the bathroom, from which the
sounds came, and saw my brother
standing over the bath tub, blood
spurting from the awful gash In his
throat and with the knife with which
the deed had been committed still !
clasped in his right hand. Mrs. Thomp- j
son (his wife) and I gently lowered him
to the floor and calling for a pillow
placed it under his head. He may have
lived five minutes or a little more, but
he did not speak."
The witness further testified that on
last Friday, while in San Francisco, hÂ«
received a telegram from his brother,
now deceased, asking him to meet
him at the Tiburon ferry. The witness
did so, whereupon his brother at once
took him aside and in a mysterious
manner informed him that the most
serious misfortune of his life had just
befallen him. When asked to what
he referred he replied that while at
tending the funeral of the late Major
Tuttle a few days previous he had com
mitted an act of gross impropriety,
and as a result all the Odd Fellows had
sworn vengeance upon him, the Masons
had decided to assist them, and the two
organizations had together enlisted the
newspapers of this city on their side
and were ready and just about to make
a fierce assault upon him.
"I was astonished beoynd measure at
the way he talked," the witness con
tinued, "and asked what act of impro
priety he had committed, but could get
no intelligent reply."
Mr. Thompson said that at the time
his brother visited him in San Fran
cisco the latter was suffering very
acutely from the trouble with his ear
and he took him to a specialist in the
Young Men's Christian Association
building. While the physician was ex
amining him he arose and calling the
witness into another room repeated
what he had said at the ferry concern
ing the Masons and Odd Fellows.
Believing that home would be the
best place for his afflicted brother, the
witness advised him to return to this
city, telling him that he would attend
to certain business matters for him
and write to him the result. When he
(the witness) came up to Santa Rosa
his brother accused him of not having
given the matter his attention and
claimed that the letter was a forgery.
Dr. J. F. Boyce testified that he had
been the physician of the Thompson
family for thirty-five years. A week ar o
last Wednesday Mr. Thompson can.3
to his office and complained of suffer
ing from insomnia. He prescribed for
him. In a subsequent visit Mr. Thomp
son told him that he thought he (the
doctor) had made light of his trouble.
He appeared much agitated. Afterward
this agitation subsided.
Muoh evidence of a similar charac
ter was introduced, and, after hearing
the testimony, the jury brought in a
verdict that Mr. Thompson's death was
due to a knife wound, self-inflicted,
while he was mentally deranged, and
that the derangement was occasioned
by natural causes.
The funeral will be held to-morrow
afternoon at 1:30 o'clock and will be
under the auspices of the Masonic and
Odd Fellows organizations of this city.
The Typographical Union will attend
in a body, and as a mark of respect to
the deceased friend and neighbor the
proprietors of the Press-Democrat
have ordered the office closed during
the afternoon that all the employes
may have an opportunity to be pres
ent at the obsequies.

BOSTON, Feb. 2.â A score of persons
were drowned and two million dollars'
loss Inflicted by the storm that swept
Eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Isl
and last night and this morning. Four
unidentified bodies He in the Coroner's
office in Gloucester. Five more are in
Lynn, brought over from Little Na
hant, where the schooner Charles H.
Briggs was wrecked. Twelve unidenti
fied corpses are reported to be at Ba
kers Island in Salem Harbor. They,
too, must have manned some of the
schooners which were lost in Glouces
ter Harbor.
That there are others in the waters
of the bay seems almost certain.
Wreckage is strewn up and down the
coast from Cape Ann to Cape Cod.
Thirty schooners were wrecked in Mas
sachusetts Bay. On land the loss by
the storm seems to have been confined
entirely to property.
Twenty-four hours elapsed before di
rect telegraphic communication was
restored between Boston and the rest
of the world. The electric car service
in the vicinity was restored by noon,
but in most of the smaller towns the
trolley lines are still crippled.
The cost of the storm in this city is
estimated as follows: Boston Elevated
Railway Company, $224,000; city of
Boston, $75,000; Western Union Tele
graph Company, $20,000; Postal Tele
graph Company, $10,000; Long: Distance

damage to property and loss to in
come, $125,000; loss to shipping:, about
$250,000; loss to Boston's business is at
least $600,000. Total, $1,428,000.
LONDON, Feb. 2.â Storms are pre

MARTINEZ, Feb. 2.â Many creditors in
San Franrlsco will no doubt be surprised
to learn of the failure of W. B. Hellings
of San Pablo, a well-known speculator in
mines. His petition shows liabilities of
$80,000 and assets nil. The two largest
creditors are the Hibernia Bank. $25,000.

amounts due on unsecured notes. Other

was largely interested in mining enter

:; : Why no more Indictments were
\: found in connection with the School
Board scandal is explained in that part
of the Grand Jury's report which
treats of the School Board Investiga
tion. This is as follows:
â  ': We have consumed much .'.time and ex-
: amined many witnesses.- looking into the
abuses lying in and around the Board of

'early developed that there' was a sys

â . â â ; to bring the : guilty parties ..'. to justice.
â -â¢. We found; however, our way blocked in
: .,: almost every direction by the law, which
'.-:. appears to be peculiarly adapted to shield
'â ^wrongdoers' in this ; department.. The ac
:' :â¢â  ceptance of ' a. bribe by a â¢ public . officer

ptlng members of the Boards of Edu
."cation and placing of offenses- of. the
above nature by - the above officials in
the category of misdemeanors, thus re
moving them from the jurisdiction of the
â  Grand Jury. The punishment for a mis
': demeanor Is bo slight that a corrupt
: school director would have no hesitancy
v ln extorting. money from teachers or Â«m
ployes under his charge, especially when
: "the salaries are made so attractive that
teachers and employes can be found who
'â -.'â 'â  -.are willing to pay for such positions.
:i: : Also, by reason of the above-mentioned
â¢-'â  amendment, several persons â  who made

1 :: ' confessed miEstatements of . facts in re
lation - to these offenses were, relieved
from a charge of perjury. In the first
case of this kind we found an indictment.
Â»V- but it was not presented, because we
were advised that by reason of our hav
ing no right to conduct -investigation
the evidence given was not material, and
therefore the indictment would fail.
: We also started: an inquiry, into the
â  purchase of supplies- by- the Board of
Education, but this was â .stopped by pur
: being advised that -."while the law evi
dently contemplated, that purchases shall
be made from the lowest bidder, no pen
alty was attached in case they are not
â  bo "made, and should the â  Board of Edu

*â ': â â â  from our public' schools. " The importance
which the community . attaches to the
education of our children may be meas
ured by the amount of money we expend
v in that direction,- almost one-half of.the
' "entire expenditures "of the county being
.for the support of the public schools. The
qualifications, required .of the teachers are
. high and the salaries liberal. But a few
:. short years are allowed a child to equip
'himself: for. his battle in life, and he is
entitled to every facility for so doing.
â  v^he Is put in charge of an: incompetent
â¢ teacher, ne is â¢â â handicapped in the begln

. riot Infinitely prefer that money should
" â¢ be abstracted from his pocket rather than
â  that- his child should be : filched of his
â¢ opportunities" to make his way in the
â¢ world, â  'â  â¢ â¢ . '
'. What. then, shall we say of a man who
â¢ under the guise o-f a patriotic and gratuit
â¢ ous service, to the community, a depart-
ment that Is closest to us all, barters the
futures of our children for a few paltry
dollars or some trifling; advantage to him
self. We utterly reject the theory that a
necessity exists for a combination in our
Board of Education. No such combina
tion Is contemplated by law, neither is it
necessary ior the proper conduct of the
public business. It deprives useful mem
bers of the board of a voice in its af
fairs, and begets grave suspicions in
the public mind as to the motives which
hold the majority in continued compacts.
In its report the Grand Jury speaks
its condemnation of combinations in
the Grand Jury. That there is one in
the Board of Education, as it is now
organized, there can be no question,
in view of developments of the past few
days.
Webb, in his signed statement pub
lised In The Call, wrote that one reason
why he was prosecuted by W. B. Cline
and E. E. Gibbon was because of his
having refused to consent to the re
eJectlon of Miss Mac Owen as a teach
er. She was one of a number of teach
ers who were dropped from the teach
ers' list owing to a poor rating. At the
first meeting held in January the Board
of Education was reorganized so as to
give control to the League for Better
City Government, and all the commit
tees were newly selceted. At the meet
ing of the board on Monday last the
teachers' committee submitted a report
recommending the election of Miss Mac
Owen and Miss Gertrude Hogan. The
report was adopted by the votes of Da
vis, Conrey, Braly, Kubach and Mc-
Inerney. The latter was induced to
vote for the election of Miss Owen by
the committee agreeing to the election
of Miss Hogan, who was a protege of
Mclnerney.
Thus did Gibbon and Cline work out
their will with the board. But Webb
is not yet through. At the next meet
ing of the board, which has been called
for February S, he will introduce a res
olution for the re-election of all the
teachers who had similar markings to
Miss Mac Owen. Davis, Braly and Con
rey are all members of the fake league
for better city government, and so are
Gibbon and Cline. Miss Mac Owen is a
particular friend of Cline. and Gibbon
is one of the attorneys for Cline, in both
business and private matters. Braly,
! it may be incidentally stated, was in
; dorsed by the league at the last muni
j cipal election as the result of a fraud
practiced by some of the members of
the board of directors of the fake or
j ganization.
How dastardly and unscrupulous are
the methods resorted to by the indlvid
' ual members of the League for Better
city Government is exemplified In the
i case of School Director Poor, who has
! stood by Webb through all the recent
proceedings, simply from a sense of
right and Justice. For fifteen years
; past Poor has been engaged In the
work of record-searching. During the
past year he has been in the employ of
I the Title Insurance and Trust Com
j pany. On Monday last he was notified
! that his services would no longer be
I required. When he charged that his
i dismissal was due to the stand he had
; taken in the School Board lnvestiga
j tlon no attempt was made to deny it.
Among the directors of the Title In
surance and Trust Company are Frank
A. Gibson, treasurer of the League for
Better City Government; O. P. Clark.
La director of this league; H. W. O'Mel
i veney. one of the organizers and a for-
I mor director of the league, and James
H. Shankland, one of the partners of
1 O'Mflveney in the law business. Whom
i the league cannot rule it ruins. It is
j the political organization of the local
allied corporations.

While Seal Hunting Near
St. Johns.
ST. JOHNS. N. F.. Feb. 2.â Sixteen men
belonging' to Trinity Bay were driven off

ANTI-QUAY MOVEMENT
GIVEN AN IMPETUS.
Representative Pennsylvania Repub
licans Urge the Senator's
Defeat.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 2-Tha anti-
Quay movement in the Republican party
received an impetus here to-day at a con
ference at which there were present about
400 representative party men from ail sec
tions of the State. The conference was
heid under the auspices of the Business
Men's League.
After a lengthy discussion a resolution
was adopted urging John Wanamaker to
permit the use of his name "for the office
of Governor at the approaching Repub
lican primary election and at the Repub
lican State Convention."
The present senior United States Sena
tor, the platform says, is understood to
desire re-election, and he, more than any
other man. It says, is responsible for the
present corrupt condition of State poli
tics. His defeat for re-election is urged
upon the voters.

Believes This Government Should
Stop the Importation of Ger-
man Wines.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2.â Referring edi
torially to Germany's exclusion of i
American fruit the Journal of Com- j
merce to-morrow will say:
We certainly have the right to object !
strongly to this sort of attack upon our
products. This paper does not regard
retaliation with much favor, but U Is
time to consider whether we ought not
in self-protection, to exclude German
wines and many other things on the
ground that they are adulterated or un
wholesome. There is plenty of German
testimony to the sophistication of Rhine
wines, and both France and Germany I
have been doing all they can to damage
the reputation of our food products and
It Is about time we resorted to some new
measures of defense.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAT, FEBRUARY 3, 1898.
MAYOR KOCH
FILES A VETO
Would Protect San Jose
From Street Sweep
ing Jobbery.
Evidence of a Combination to
Rob the City Out of
$12,000.
Councilman Attempt to Let thÂ« Con
tract Regardless of the Low
est Bidder.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Feb. 2.â The attempt on
the part of the City Council to mulct
the city to the sum of about $12,000
during the next three years by means
of a street sweeping contract, has been
balked, temporarily at least, by Mayor
Koch's veto, which was filed late yes
terday afternoon. In vetoing the res
olution awarding the contract to Nash
& McÃeynolds the Mayor says he is
convinced that the bid is not the low
est and best.
Councilmen Fay, Krleg, Noltlng and
Dittus were unanimous In awarding
the contract to Nash & McÃeynolds,
although it was over a third higher
than L. Hewlett's bid, and in all prob
ability they win pass the matter over
the Mayor's veto.
The letting of the street sweeping
FOR THE YUKON AND KOTZEBUE SOUND.
The steamer Albion has been fitted out by the Alaska-Yukon Transportation Company and will leave Satur
day crowded with passengers. Tickets by the bark Alaska for Kotzebue Sound have been oversold, so the bark
Northern Light has been purchased and will be put on the route, and the steamer Eureka is to be brought out of re
tirement and used on the Dyea route.
contract looks very much like a Job,
and as if money had been used where
it would do the most good. When bids
were called for the work five were re
ceived. Of these Nash & McÃeynolds'
was the highest and L. Hewlett's the
lowest. The two bids speak for them
selves:
Nash & McÃeynoldsâ .oos2B2 cents per
square yard per month, six times a week
for two-year contract; .002641 three times
a week. Two per cent discount for a con
tract for three years.
L. Hewlettâ .oo397s cents per square
yard per month, six times a week, two
year contract: one-half of the above
amount for three times a weok. Two per
cent off for three-year contract.
Instead of awarding the work to L.
Hewlett, the lowest bidder, the Coun
cil deliberately gave the contract to
Nash & McÃeynolds, whose bid was
over one-third higher than that of
Hewlett. At present the city pays $595
per month for street sweeping, but if
the contract stands that was given to
Nash & McÃeynolds the city will pay
about $4000 a year more than they are
now paying for the same work.
Three years ago Hewlett was given
the contract for sweeping the streets,
and he Immediately sold it to Nash &
McÃeynolds for $75 per month, and the
latter' firm made a good profit out of
the work.
How the Council could openly award
the, street sweeping 1 contract to the
highest bidder, and thus wantonly vote
away the people's money, is being se
riously discussed by the taxpayers,
and charges of corruption are heard on
all sides. Should the contract be
awarded over the Mayor's veto the
people will be thoroughly aroused, and,
although the "thrifty four" have but
two months to serve, steps may be
taken looking to their removal from
office. The present Council is the most
extravagant one the city has ever
been afflicted with.
OPERATIONS OF A GANG
OF AMERICAN CROOKS.
Many Persons Induced to Invest in
Non-Existent Mexican
Property.
CITY OF MEXICO, Feb. 2.â Frederick
Pollock, formerly a railroad contractor,
was arrested this afternoon for concealing
stolen property in connection with the
operations of an American gang of
crooks. Frederic P. Graham, claiming to
be an Englishman, who recently swindled
New York and New Jersey capitalists out
of $21,000 in a sale of a non-existent phos
phate mine in the State of Oaxaca, has
left the country, and there is g-ood rea
son to believe he has gone to Alaska,
whither detectives will follow him. as he
employed names of high Mexican officials
in entrapping his victims. Colonel Dewltt
Foster, an American officer in the Mexi
can army, has lent efficient aid toward
unearthing the gang of crooks which has
been fleecing Americans.
The discovery of faro tables ingeniously
devised to cheat people, forms an import
ant link In the chain of testimony against
the crooks, who are now in Belem.
Mayor Justice Baranda has cut short
his vacation in Yucatan, and Is hurrying
back to the capital to give direction to
the prosecution of the prisoners, whose
operations are now known to have been
of great magnitude and likely to throw
discredit on all legitimate Investments.
The Government is determined to root
out the gang, and has the hearty support
of the American residents.

Suicide of Captain John Leo, Late

The rush to the gold fields of the
Yukon has brought joy to the hearts
of shipowners. Two years ago steam
ers, steam schooners, ships, barks,
barkentlnes and schooners by the dozen
were tied up In Oakland Creek waiting
for something to turn up, now there Is
not an unchartered or unused craft in
the bay. All have come out of retire
ment and in handling the rush to the
Klondike are turning gold into the de
pleted treasuries of their owners.
The steamer Eureka is to be again
put In commission. She was built in
1864 and some time ago Goodall, Per
kins & Co. decided it was time she went
into retirement. When her license ran
out she was not a candidate for new
papers, but now that the company is
short a vessel, owing to the wreck of
the Corona, the old vessel will proba
bly go to work again. She has been
stripped and examined and found to
be almost as sound as when she was
launched.
Captain B. Cogan has placed another
vessel on the Kotzebue Sound route.
There is not accommodations enough
on the bark Alaska for all who want to
reach the sound so yesterday he pur
chased the bark Northern Light from
James McKenna, and she will be fitted
out for the trip at once.
Captain Whltesides, late master of
the whaler Navarch, will go as master
of the Northern Light, and Captain
Cogan will command the expedition
and also the bark Alaska. The latter
vessel will leave here April 25 and the
Northern Light May 10. The Alaska
will take the river boat to St. Law
rence Island, and it will be ready for
use by the time the Northern Light
reaches the Sound.
For Dyea and Skaguay the Alaska-
Yukon Transportation Company's Al
bion will leave on Saturday with a
ful list of passengers.
Some of the Gifford party are taking
five mules and twenty-five tons of
freight, and the others are well pro
vided with dogs and provisions.
The same company's steamer Na
tional City will leave next week.
The steamer State of California got
away yesterday for Portland. She had
a number of people for Dyea aboard,
which she will transfer to the steamer
Oregon. There was the usual crowd
of sightseers down to see the vessel
off.
The rumor that the Pacific Mall is
going to place the San Bias. San Juan,
Colon and Acapulco on the Alaskan
route is hardly credited, as the coffee
season has just -opened and the com
pany cannot handle all the business
offering. If Mr. Huntington should de
cide to make the change the English
steamers now on their way out from
Liverpool will he secured and placed
In the Central American trade.
Captain John Lee, late of the C. D.
Bryant. Sonoma and half a dozen
other vessels, made a successful at
tempt at suicide yesterday. Tuesday
night he had a fight with Captain
Dollard of the wrecker Whitelaw and
Captain Sullivan of the schooner Mary
Gilbert. Yesterday morning he got a
room In the Alpha house on the corner
of Eiist and Market streets and there
took a dose of morphine. He was
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital, where he died at 9:30 last evening.
Once before Lee attempted to end his
life by the gas route, but failed. He
is known from one end of the world to
the other, and one time was one of the
most successful masters in the Cali
fornia trade. Once, however, he was
arrested in Honolulu for smuggling,
and his vessel was seized. He got out
of that trouble, but was arrested here
for trying to land four Chinese. For
that he lost his ship, and has been
working around the front ever since.
He is the son of Professor John Lee of
Gourouk College, Glasgow, Scotland.

SETTLES ALL
OF HER BILLS
Mrs. Blythe - Hinckley
Mortgages the Market-
Street Property.
Twenty-Five Instruments Are
â  Now Placed on
Record.
0
Lawyers, Money-Lendei-s and Others
â  Receive Security for Their
Claims.
Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinckley, heir
ess of the millions of the late .Thomas
Blythe, settled her Indebtedness to the
butcher, the baker, the candlestick
maker, the lawyers, the doctors and
even the money-lenders, by executing
more than a score of mortgages on her
Market-street holdings yesterday.
Before the courts gave Mrs. Blythe-
Hlnckley the decree that placed her In
possession of the vast estate, money
was not too plentiful with the young
heiress, and she borrowed and went
into debt in all directions. Since that
time Simpson & Millar, the searchers
of records, have been looking into the
deeds of the property, and it was on
their report that the mortgages were
arranged.
Among those who took part in the
recording of the Instruments were
Judge Cotton, H. I. Kowalsky, R. J.
Wilson, General Dickinson, L. P. Drex
ler, Kate C. Byrne, James D. Byrne and
Van R. Paterson, representing a num
ber of creditors.
All of the mortgages are on the prop
erty in the block bounded by Geary
and Market etreets and Grant avenue,
and are as follows:
John H. Dickinson. $23,031: same. $10,236:
Ida J. Phillips, $15,000; Cecelia A. Levy,
$5000: J. M. Kowalsky. $4000; Willard C.
Doane, $2000; John T. Porter. $5000; L. P.
Drexler, $12,753; William B. Waldron.
$7652; John T. Porter, $17,500; City of Paris
Dry Goods Company. $9665; L. P. Drexler
$7035 Willard C. Doane, $500; Isaac
Strassburger.: $3202; Kate C. Byrne, $21.
184; same, $50,000; Russell J. Wilson and
Mountford J. Wilson, $20,000; Hepburn
Wilkins, $10,000: Maximilian Herzog, $3663;
Robert Srott, administrator. $2002; Rich
ard Kinsilla and Robert W. Johnson,
$1102 75: Michael Cochrane. $770; S. A.
Pacheoo and E. J. Rake, $933; William
Sale. $6<o 75.
The mortgages were given to secure
promissory notes payable in eighteen
months, with interest at 5 per cent for
the first year and 6 per cent thereafter
until redeemed. It is not thought that
the interest on this indebtedness will
embarrass Mrs. Blythe-Hlnckley, as
the income of the property is very
large. Several of the suits against the
heiress were settled only yesterday on
the execution of the mortgages. The
total amount for which she pledges her
estate is $232,991.

SAN QUENTIN JUTE SACKS.
Prison Directors Fix the Price for
the Season at $5.30 Per
Hundred.
The Board of State Prison Directors
held a special meeting at the office of
Daniel E. Hayes on First street Tuesday
for the purpose of fixing the price on
grain bags for the season. With the ex
ception of Robert T. Devlin there was
present a full board.
The directors responding to their names
were Robert Fitzgerald. James H. Wil
kins, Daniel E. Hayes and Donald Rey,
the new director, who has taken tf he seat
left vacant by the retirement or Edgar
J. De Pue.
The chairman explained that the pur
pose of the meeting was solely to con
sider the fixing of a price on the grain
bags manufactured at the San Quentin
jutemill. After some consideration $5 30
per hundred was agreed upon. This price
is slightly under the cost of production
plus 1 cent.
The directors further made an order
that no sale exceeding 5000 bags should
be made to a single party. This the di
rectors believe is a strict construction of
the Ostrum act. which they intend to
abide by. The receipt of orders for grain
bags is not so large as usual, owing to
the crop prospects.

THE SCIENCE OF FORGETTING.
\A EMORY has been reduced to a science. If a
/ \ man has: a knowledge that his recollection of
-,*â¢â¢'â  names is bad he can overcome the detect.
For instance, if the name of a person to whom he is
introduced is Snow, and he is certain that he could
not engrave this on his mental tablets, he has only
to make a note that the name signifies something
â¢which is white and cold and piles up in drifts. This
is very simple and there can be no danger that in
quiry will have to be made when next they meet. By
an impulse which quickly comes to be second nature
he will extend his hand and say, "Delighted to see
you, Mr. Snow." Such is the science of memory.
The science of forgetting is something different.
There are no rules for it. It is a matter of instinct.
Mr. Colnon seems to be a master in the ability to
forget, to do it judiciously, modestly, effectually, for
getting only that which if he had a choice in the mat
ter he would rather not remember. This may be for
tunate for him. To the world outside the Harboi
Commission it may appear somewhat in the nature of
a calamity. If there has been crookedness in that
body, which heaven forbid, people would like to
know about it. By a natural impulse they turn to
Colnon, and are met by the assertion that he cannot
remember. Well, if he cannot, to refresh his mind is
a simple duty, and this The Call has for several days
been trying to do â not, it must be confessed, with the
approbation of Colnon or the other members of the
board. We venture the prediction that if they will
carefully read the information printed in the local
columns it will stimulate thought until fading recol
lection shall revive and the whole picture of the
transactions in which the board has been concerned
will stand out like a masterpiece of bas-relief. Then,
glancing at the picture, Colnon will be able to de
scribe it in terms the most explicit.
Often when a man disappears with money belong
ing to some other man he turns up later broke, tell
ing a story of having forgotten all about his act of
going away, of spending the money, or of getting
back. The cruel world has a habit then of railing at
him, advising him to spin his yarns to the marines
and otherwise of making light of his sorrows. Let
the Colnon case be a lesson to the world. Here is a
ni2n in a responsible position who can forget as fast
and accurately as the victim of the circumstances de
tailed above.
LURING THE BOYS TO RUIN.
IT is a startling fact that boys who should as yet
have little knowledge of the world are engaged in
gambling. It is an atrocious thing that men
should be helping them along a path the course of
which is downward. It is beyond comprehension
that a Grand Jury supposed to ferret out crime, to
act without fear or favor, should ignore the existence
of poolrooms not only illegal in themselves but
doubly illegal in that they cater to lads who are
hardly beyond the stage of short pantaloons.
Pupils of the public schools play the races. They
have learned not only to do this, but they have been
corrupted by the vernacular of the track. They talk,
not of youthful pleasures, but of "tips." They dis
cuss the qualities of various horses as shrewdly as a
lot of jockeys. The slang of the tout is at the ends
of their tongues. Upon the outcome of a race they
freely bet their money.
That this course must lead them to neglect their
work as students does not need saying. That the in
fluence is bad in all respects is too plain to be con
troverted. That it will lead many into actual crime
there can be no question. Some boys do not have
money to waste on races. Nothing can be clearer
than that these boys will in some instances be led into
obtaining the necessary money regardless of conse
quences. As no man can serve two masters, no boy
can attend to the important duties of boyhood â the
preparation for manhood â and at the same time give
himself in any degree to the passion for gaming, a
mad passion which has brought many a promising
career to a somber close.
Why do not the police shut the iniquitous places
where the money is taken from boys? Why do they
permit poolrooms to defy the law and be a trap for
children? If they do not know these things they will
appreciate this information. If they are not able to
find the offensive institutions The Call will point
them the way. The boys need protection. They
have a right to be guarded against the tempter. The
community owes this much to them and their
parents.
The man who says he can produce Mrs. Leutgert
in court will probably never be able to claim the
reward, but at any time he may wish to join a liars'
club he will find nothing barring his way.
Telegraphic advices are that Chile and Argentina
will "keep the peace." Why they should want to
keep anything for which they have so little use is not
explained in the dispatch.
VICTORY IN SIGHT.
VICTORY is in sight for the people in the battle
against the fenderless street cars. Public sen
timent, roused at last to the point of determined
insistence, has had its effect. As was announced yes
terday by The Call exclusively, the directors of the
Market Street Company have resolved to wait no
longer for action by the Board of Supervisors, but
will at once equip their cars with safeguards for the
piotection of the public.
William F. Herrin, in speaking of the conclusion
reached by the directors of the Market street system,
said to a representative of The Call: "We propose
to exercise our best judgment in applying a device to
save human life and will equip our cars with fenders.
Should the Board of Supervisors hereafter pass an
ordinance requiring our company to put on some
ether fender or device we will go into court and fight
the proposition on its merits. The Supervisors will
be compelled to prove they have found something
better than we introduced."
There can be no question that the decision reached
by the Market Street Company is fully justified by
the delay of the Supervisors. As was pointed out by
Mr. Vining in his statement to The Call, the com
pany has been waiting for action by the Supervisors
ever since 1805. During the period that has elapsed
the company has made tests of thirty safety devices,
but has never been able to get the Supervisors to
approve of any of them. Patience under these cir
cumstances has ceased to be a virtue. It is time to
act. The Supervisors are waiting too long. There
have been too many deaths.
The announcement of this decision of the Market
Street Company was the most important item of local
news published yesterday. It was received with grat
ification by the public, but not with entire satisfac
tion. There remains the question: Since the com
pany is to act at last without the sanction of the Su
pervisors, why has it waited so long before doing so?
Why did not the corporation act promptly in the
public interests without waiting until repeated
maimings and killings had roused public indignation
almost to the verge of a popular outbreak?
The long delay of nearly three years in the settle
ment of an issue so comparatively simple as that of
equipping cars with safety appliances similar to those
in use in other cities is a matter of grave public con
cern. It remains an issue demanding investigation
even after the railway company has decided to adopt
fenders without further waiting. It is a common
rumor on the streets that a majority of the Super
visors refused to select any particular device because
some of them demanded $500 each as the price of
their approval. They have held out all these years
it is said in order to get that much coin.
Common rumor is not good authority, but in this
case all the circumstantial evidence tends to justify
the report that the delay in the adoption of fenders
was a campaign of rascally inactivity for the sake
of boodle. Recent disclosures in connection with
the management of the pound and the issue of per
mits for prize fights confirm it. Did the railroad
companies know that the Supervisors were holding
out for money? That is a question the Grand Jury
would do well to ask and investigate.
Victory is in sight for the people, but it will not be
a complete victory unless the men who are respon
sible for the deaths by trolley accidents in the last
three years are exposed. To have gained the desired !
safety appliances on the cars is good, but the battle |
should be kept up until not one guilty rascal es- j
capes unwhipped of justice.
THE FARMERS' STAKE IN ANNEXATION
THE mission of President Dole seems to be a
failure. His presence in Washington has
brought no strength to the annexation treaty,
and he is about to leave for a tour through the South
and will sail for home in a few weeks.
The wisdom of the makers of the constitution in
requiring concurrence of two-thirds of the Senate to
ratify a treaty is again illustrated as it was in the
San Domingo affair. The annexationists boasted in
November of one vote too many and gave notice
that the treaty would go through early in December.
The Call at that time denied their strength and de
clared that the treaty would not be ratified in De
cember, nor at all. Our position was proved to be
correct by the proposition to annex by joint resolu
tion. We have shown the unconstitutionally ot such
method. Congress may "admit States" by such reso
lution or by a bill, but it cannot annex alien terri
tory in any other way than by treaty.
While the friends of the treaty are laboring to hold
what strength they have in Congress the antagonism
in the country is consolidating and increasing. The
farmers in the reliable Republican States of the
Upper Mississippi Valley are asserting themselves in
a way that admonishes the Republican party. The
Congressional elections this year are of the gravest
importance. The Republican party cannot afford to
alienate the rural communities which were its staff
and stay in 1896. The farmers want for themselves
our domestic sugar market of $100,000,01,01 00,000,01,0 a year.
They have the land, the white labor and the disposi
tion to take that market and hold it.
The tinplate market annually was a small fraction
of that sum, but the tinplate manufacturers deter
mined to have it for themselves. Under the stimulus,
afforded by the McKinley bill, American ingenuity
took that trade. It adapted devices in manufacture,
cheapened production and bettered the product, un
til now American meats, oil, fruits, vegetables and
even plum puddings go all over the world cased in
American tin.
What was done for tinplate and for steel rails, for
benefit of the American manufacturers, can be done
in a far greater degree for the American farmers by
letting them conquer the home sugar market with
their beet product. Cane sugar has to be produced
by some form of cheap labor. It is a tropical product
and white labor has never been domesticated in trop
ical plantations and never will be. Beet sugar, on
the other hand, is a product of the temperate zone.
It is produced by white labor, paid and living on the
scale of temperate zone civilization. Thirty millions
of people get their living in this country from its
farms. They can add to the profits of. their present
crops and add to that the profit of a new crop, if
they are permitted to supply to American consumers
the $100,000,000 worth of sugar they use every year.
The new crop used in rotation will benefit the soil
and will increase by at least one-fourth the farm value
of the crop with which it rotates.
All of these facts are known to the American farm
ers. They are watching the politicians and it will
go hard with any political party that snatches this
prize from their grasp by annexing distant fields of
competition in the far tropics.
The treaty being dead, it is best to let it stay dead.
Domestic problems crowd Congress for solution.
Let them occupy the legislative mind.
People who are rushing to the Klondike for, the
purpose of starving to death might accomplish* the
same end by remaining at home and have here the
advantage of being comfortably buried.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1898.
THE INSOLENCE OF BOODLE.
S \BSERVING persons can scarcely have failed
I Jto notice that what the bard of Avon called
the "insolence of power" looms up conspicu
ously in all the boodle exposures now running. At
Los Angeles, where a newspaper and political ring
has been unearthed working to take from the city a
valuable water right, the cohorts of reform have
been met with counter charges, abuse and refalsifica
tion. At San Jose, where "gang politics" has
smirched the judicial ermine and brought reproach
upon the government, a cry for an investigation has
been met with an insolent swagger and a demand to
know what the people are going to do about it. At
Oakland, where two water corporations have formed
a combination to loot the public, an exposure is met
with sullen silence. In this city â but here language
fails and deduction grows sick at heart. The atti
tude of our boodlers can be described with but one
word â defiance.
A story illustrative of the spirit which animates the
political corruptionists now being exposed to view
is told of the late Boss Tweed. Soon after stealing
himself rich Tweed ordered a magnificent residence.
Desiring something that would "lay over" the resi
dences of the plebeians who had acquired their
j money honestly, he employed a famous European
J artist to decorate his house. Strolling through his
palatial corridors one day with this gentleman, he
espied in a niche a fine statue of Mercury. '"Who's
that?" he asked. The artist gave him the name of
the mythological god and briefly narrated the story
of his birth and life. "Yes," said Tweed, "I under
stand; but what did he do? Why is he entitled to a
statue?" "Mercury," replied the artist, with some
hesitation, "represents the predatory idea; he was
the god of thieves." "Thunder and lightning,"
roared the famous boss, "you've got him in the
wrong place. Take him down from there and put
him over the main entrance to the building."
Yet history records that society finally swept this
rascal to prison and kept him there until he died.
The insolent defiance with which the charges pre
ferred against certain members of the Board of Su
pervisors of this city have been met can be likened
only to the celebrated remark of Tweed's â "So long
as we count the votes, what are you going to do
about it?" Is it possible that the people of San
Francisco are not going to do anything about the
disclosures made with reference to the public pound,
the sale of boxing permits, the street car fenders and
the other charges of rank corruption in the Board of
Supervisors? There seems to be no question of the
guilt of the parties charged. Is the insolence of
power â the defiance of boodle â to bowl down the
moral storm that must be brewing?
The Call does not share the popular distrust of the
capacity of the law to bring all classes of criminals to
the dock. But it must be admitted that those pro
cesses are slow and the results in political cases quite
unsatisfactory. Burglars, footpads and petty lar
cenists are arraigned, convicted and sentenced with
certainty and dispatch. But political highwaymen
and official garroters are treated with singular ten
derness and regard. Cannot somebody put some
fire into the law at this time? It is quite evident that
if official corruption is to be brought to an end in this
State the people must land some of the rascals now
in public life in prison. All scalawags dread the bas
tile, and vote selling and buying will cease only when
an example is made of some of those who seek office
for the purpose of making money. As things are
going it will not be long before Mercury will be the
reigning god at every city or county building in the
State.
THERE are some things in connection with the
new navy which must ever be a puzzle to the
landsman. One of these is the immediate ne
cessity for repairs which springs into existence with
the launching of each ship, excepting, of course, and
gladly, the Californian product. It would seem as
if a ship was hardly more than a skeleton on which
to hang an elongated series of repairs. If the de
partment decides to dispatch a brand-new vessel to
some foreign port, there to be impressive, there is
always a preliminary delay while repairs are made.
Is it possible that the young ladies who break bot
tles over the prow of each ship added to the navy
use too much force in the process? Perhaps it would
be safer not to break the bottle, but to uncork it
quietly and let the contents escape without subject
ing the craft to violence. Recently the Brooklyn col
lided with a zephyr and a dash of spray and was
ready for the drydock. Not long before that the
Texas had stubbed her nimble toe in trying to prance
overland. We confess to lack of sympathy with the
Texas. It should have stayed out in the wet. Now
the Indiana's boilers have been leaking. No particu
lars have been received, and specifications of the
right of the Indiana's boilers to spring a leak have not
been received. We assume, however, the expectation
that a ship costing millions shall be equipped with
boilers more robust than inspire the cough of the
donkey engine which acclaims along the water front
as it hoists coal from the hold is not unreasonable.
Since a seven-year-old girl of Santa Monica has
died of hydrophobia caused by the bite of a dog, the
opportunity is again here for science to declare that
there is no such malady. Science seldom neglects
a chance to do this, and to chide in convincing tech
nical terms the careless people who die of it. Of
course the claim will be made again that hydrophobia
is imagination, but a little child with an imagination
developed to the fatal point must indeed have pos
sessed an active mind.
Justice Richardson of Los Angeles County has
either been sadly misrepresented or he is the most
vacuous ass who ever misconstrued law. It was he
who would have turned loose two men who accord
ing to the evidence thus far made public were guilty
of wanton and peculiarly cruel murder. If Richard
son has an excuse for his conduc* the people would
be glad to hear it, and in the absence of excuse they
would be delighted to hear of his resignation.
Yesterday afternoon the Examiner bulletined as
news considerable information which readers of The
Call had had the privilege of seeing in the morning.
However much such enterprise is to be admired, we
feel that common journalistic courtesy would have
prompted the yellow sheet to give us credit.
Explanation is made that the original of Sherlock
Holmes was a Scotland Yard detective. It is im
possible to accept this without a feeling of disap
pointment. It had been hoped that the original was
simply a composite San Francisco sleuth.
If the wife of young Hanna succeed in leaving the
family, as is her ambition, she will stamp herself as a
bright woman. It is seldom that the Hanna family
gets left.
There are criminals for whom hanging is too good,
and one of these is the scoundrel who is literally
snatching Chicago schoolgirls baldheaded.
VAGARIES OF THE NAVY.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
If Alexander Guilmant, the great French
organist, decides to visit San Francisco
it will be interesting: to see whether he
will down the encore fiend and crush the
enthusiast who breaks in with untimely
applause before the last notes of the ac
companiment are sounded, as he has
done in New York. In New York the
encore fiend reaches the ne plus ultra of
his development, but Guilmant has
downed him; and as for accompaniments,
they have been listened to at his recitals
with as much respect as if they were
solos. It is difficult to say where the
Guilmant audiences have come from, be
cause they have been different from all
other New York .audiences this winter.
Perhaps Henry Wolfson has had them
educated to order, for every one knows
that Wolfson is the most obliging of im
presarios. The probability is, though, that
organists, choirmasters and earnest devo
tees of church music have made up the
ALEXANDER GUILMANT, THE GREATEST LIVING ORGANIST,
sum total of Guilmant's New York ad
mirers. And what audiences! At the
concert where Emma Juch emerged
from the obscurity of married life to elng
for Guilmant the final high notes at the
end of her most florid song did not elicit
one single rustle from the audience till
William Carl had sounded the last chord
of the accompaniment, and deafening as
was the applause given Guilmant he only
bestowed two encores in the whole re
cital, and those more by token of good
nature than because the audience de
manded Its pound of flesh. Guilmant is
more than the greatest of living organists
â he is a musician who can make a whol*
assemblage of people act as if they them
selves were artists.
Victor Capoul has astonished the Pa
risians by his prompt and what they call
"Yankee" methods of applying for a po
sition. For a number of years the fa-
mous singer has been teaching in New
York. When he read in the Herald of the
death of Carvalho, director of the Opera
Comlque, it struck Capoul that he would
like to shine as director over the stage
where he had formerly won renown as an
artist. He immediately rushed to a tele
graph office and put in an application by
cablegram. In answer to his anxious in
quiries he was told that he must have a
guarantee, whereupon he at once cabled
the sum of 1,000,000 francs to the Minister
of Fine Arts, in whose hands the appoint
ment lay. Capoul left for France by the
next steamer, accompanied to the wharf
by a string of his pupils and the good
wishes of all his New York friends. The
day of his arrival in Paris Capoul saw
the Minister of Fine Arts, to whom ha
confided his ardent desire to direct the
fortunes of the Opera Coniique. Fortune
favored a rival, however, for Albert
Carre received the appointment. Without
waiting an hour Capoul began to repack
his valise to return by the next steamer,
when a servant came up to tell him that
a messenger desired to see him. "Not at
home," cried the sjnger. "But it's a
message from the Minister of Fine Arts,"
said the servant. "Ah! that is another
matter," cried Capoul, stirred by the
hope that perhaps Carre had declined the
appointment. The messenger was ad
mitted and Capoul smiled grimly at his
own disappointment when he was hnnded
a draft for the 1,000,000 francs that he had
sent by telegraph. In the excitement of
hustling for the position he had forgotten
all about the money.
The failure of the recent series of Sun
day night concerts at the Metropolitan
Opera House, New York, was due to a
combination of causes, the chief one being
a new application of the star system. It
was announced first that l'saye, Pugno,
Plancon and Gerardy would appear at all
these concerts. There was a great rush
the first night and the receipts probably
covered expenses, but it was found that
a packed house was necessary every time
to make it pay. The management tried
reducing the number of stars.^ and then
the public would not go. The concerts
in which Mmes. Sembrich and Nordica
appeared were the only ones which were
profitable. R. E. Johnson, who was the
principal agent in bringing out these stars,
has been attacked by very serious illness
and has had to retire from managing the
company.
An Italian Journal remarks on the musi
cal aptitude of many of the officers of
the Italian army, among whom, it says,
is found united the worship of Mars and
Euterpe (old style). Thus it names a
major, M. Robandi, author of that "Stella
confldente," which has had a universal
success. Then the tinder-Secretary of
State, now the Minister of War, General
Afandi Rivera, who is a great amateur
singer, possessing a fine tenor voice, and
lastly a young lieutenant, M. Saverio
Rasalli-Rocca, who has just published
quite a series of piano pieces which re
veal rare talents as a genial and inspired
composer.
M. Lorenzo Parodi, composer, and music
critic on one of the most important jour
nals of Genoa, gave a most interesting
concert, in the hall of the Institution for
the Blind, on the occasion of the centen
ary of Donizetti. M. Parodi wrote and
produced at this concert with great suc
cess, a cantata, "A Gaetano Donizetti,"
for mezzo-soprano, with accompaniment
for strings, flutes, hautbois, harp and
organ. The verses of this cantata were
due to M. Ciro a Caversazzi, and it was
sung by Mile. Emilia Gautier, who shared
the success with the composer.
The new Italian Minister of Public In
struction, M. Gallo, has entered into ne
gotiations for the purchase of an auto
graph score of one of Bellini's operas,
"Beatrlna di Tenda." The price will be.
it is said, 25,000 francs. In recording this
news the Mondo Artistlco cries out, "A
Minister of the Kingdom with artistic
proclivities? One must see it to believe
it."
M. and Mme. Massenet left Paris last
weok, according to custom, to seek more
Bunny lands. M. Massenet will not re
turn to Paris till the end of February,
when he will give all his attent!on to the
final studies of the reproduction of
"Thais'" at the Opera, with new scenes
composed by himself.
Genoa has never forgotten that It is the
city where Paganini was born, and it has
Just proved it once more. On Christmas
day, at the Paganini Theater, a new drop
scene was mounted, representing "The
Triumph of Paganini." This curtain is
the work of a talented young painter
named G. Grlfo.
No time Is lost at Berlin. The first
volume of "The Biography of Johannes
Brahms," by M. Heinrich Relmann, has
just been published, and is said to be a
very interesting work.
Sinco the Ist of January, in the orches
tra of the Imperial Opera, Vienna, a
musician has been engaged to play the
viola d'amour when occasion requires. It
is M. de Steiner, first alto of the ImÂ«
perial Chapel.
It Is announced at Berlin that a special
military music journal will shortly be
published. Die Militar Musik. The foun
ders of the paper are several chiefs of
army and navy bands.
Victor Maurel, the barytone who plays
the role of Don Juan, both on and off the
stage, was one of the unsucccessful can
didates for the post of director of the
Paris Opera Comique.
At the Paris Grand Opera the five hun
dredth performance of Gounod's "Romeo

The Certificate Presented to McCarthy and Expected to Lure Others Into a Klondike
Mining Scheme.
claim forms one of the main features
of the story. Eugene McGrath is the
mining engineer.
"Captain," declared McCarthy in an
excited tone, as he walked into Bohen's
office yesterday, "I have been offered a
gold brick by a supposed Klondike
company and I want to show them fel
lows up." He was told to g o ahead,
and related his story as follows:
"A few days ago, as I was return
ing here from Los Gatos, I met a man
named J. Withey, who says he is gen
eral agent for this Alaska Electric Ex
ploration and Mining Company. He
seemed to be a pretty nice man, and
when he learned that I contemplated
going to the Klondike he said I was the
very man he had been looking for.
opened up his heart, gave me his card
and expounded a regular gold brick tale
of the company he Is connected wfth.
Of course, I didn't know that at the
time. I told him I would see some of
my friends who Intended to go as well
as I did. This was on January 7.
"I saw the boya and told them what
I had learned and they told me to go
down to the office and see Withey.
There were nine of them, Daniel Deni
hey, Mr. Elson, Dr. Donnelly, Thomas
Crowell, Mr. Maloney of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, Pat McCue, a brother
of Xeill Johnson, the blacksmith, and
two others my nephew, Mr. Crowell,
had brought In. So I went down to the
office and found these men all fitted up
in fine style, a big safe In the room and
a lot of other things to take the eye.
I had a ta'k with them and learned
that I would get J25 a day working at
my trade and that the other men would
also get paid well for whatever they
did.
"Wlthey said we would each have to
pay $500, and that they would have
probably sixty-five men In the whcrle
party They were going to have a
deep-water steamer and a boat to go
up the Yukon, a dredger to swoop gold
out of the water with and a lot of other
things, as well as running several
stores and letting the steamer stay In
the Ice In winter and be fitted up for
lodgers at the rate of $5 a day. When
I heard all this, says Ito myself: 'Mc-
Carthy, you've struck a bonanza, but
you want to go slow just the same.'
"You see, I didn't notice then, but It
comes to my mind now, that every time
I went down there was a whispering
and one man would always go o*t and
then In a little while a lot of men
would drop In and want to go In on
the scheme. Then they would talk of
the arrangements they were making for
a vessel In the East and that two hun
dred men, all paid up, were coming out
with It.
"Well, the first thing I does Is to go
down to the bank and there I found
that the men had no account there and

that it was probably a scheme. They
said they had inquiries from all over
the country about the company. Now
Withey had told me they had $10,000 in
the First National Bank and that
thirty-six men had paid up, but last
Sunday when I was talking to Lodge
alone he told me they had only JIOW in
the bank. So I pretended to Withey
that the others would not come in un
less they saw something substantial
done. Then I wrote him a letter and
sent It down by a boy saying that if
he would let me have my t\\o hundred
shares the others could probably be in
duced to come in. Here Is the reply I
get," and McCarthy exhibited a letter
reading as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. I, IS9B.
Dear Friend Mack: Your note received
and will do as 1 said I would. This is
between you and I, of course. It is no
one's biz how you get it. Now, Mack,
do your best, and you will always find
me your true friend. Yours very truly,
HARRY J. WITHEY,
General Agent.
Accompanying this letter was a cer
tificate for 500 shares in the company,
which McCarthy says he was expected
to show the others In order to get
them to "plank down the dough."
McCarthy then wanted to have
everybody connected with the com
pany arrested, but upon the advice of
an attorney that nothing could be done
unless it could be proved that some
body had actually paid money Jn, this
was considered premature and a detec
tive was detailed on the case.
James K. Lynch, cashier of the First
National Bank, asserts that the in
stitution has never been notified of
being elected treasurer for the Alaska
Electric Exploration and Mining Com
pany and has no account with them.
He knew one or two of the men by
reputation only and had always con
sidered them good citizens.
"We have received two or three In
quiries from local residents about
them," he said, "and one came from
Montana. They have no right to use
our name on their billheads without
first getting our consent. It appears
to me to be done for the purpose of
backing up their comapny with the
name of a reputable concern."
McCarthy, the complainant and
amateur detective, Is a brother of the
famous "White Hat" McCarthy, and is
engaged in blacksmithing at 22 Golden
Gate avenue. He asserts that he had
a "tough job" to keep Denihey from
Joining without any investigation, and
that if Denihey had not confidence In
his friend on account of the fact that
he had been elected to the Assembly
in 18S8 from the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict he would surely have lost his
money.
BALLOT COUNTING
TO BEGIN EARLY.
Another Innovation in the Proposed
Charter Favored by Freeholders.
The Eoard of Freeholders met last
evening in the Mills building and con
tinued Its consideration of the subject of
precinct registration. Sections 6 to 8 in
clusive of the report were adopted with
little debate. They provide generally for
the qualifications of an elector. The num
ber of registration officers In each pre
cinct Is left to the judgment of the
Board of Election Commissioners.
All sections of the report dealing with
the boards of precinct registration were
adopted with slight verbal amendments,
as were those relating to precinct regis
ters.
Isidor Gutte caused a long debate
when the clauses treating of elections
and the canvass of votes came up for
consideration, he proposing to amend sec
tion 10 by adding a provision that the
counting of ballots begin as soon as
forty votes were cast. The section was
finally referred back to the committee
with a recommendation that the clause
be Incorporated.
Will Breed Fine Horses.
Articles of Incorporation were filed yes
terday by the Ruinart Stock Farm, an
organization composed of several promi
nent young attorneys of this city. For
an object of Incorporation the company
has In view the development of a modern
stock farm, at which fine blooded horses
will be raised. The directors are H H
McPlke, Edward L. Rhodes, George B.
Keane, William L. Ashe and R. Porter
ABhe. The Bell ranch at Beltalne, Sono
ma County, has been leased for a term of
years. A racetrack and paddocks will be
constructed. The famous horse Ruinart
has been purchased and a number of
mares will be purchased during the sum
mer for breeding- purposes.
The Mercantile Library.
The recent election for officers for the
Mercantile Library at which there was a
tie vote for the office of president and a
very close vote for a few of the directors
has been set aside and a new election
ordered to take place on the 24th lnst.
The cause which led up to this action
grew out of the fact that a good many
votes were cast by proxy which were
considered as being illegal; also, that a
greater number or votes were counted
than the tally list showed had been voted
by the voters.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Ellen Bachmann has commenced suit
for divorce against Fred W. Bachmann
on the ground of desertion.
Lorela M. Johnson has applied for a

DESERTED BY
THEIR WIVES
Two Husbands Ask the
Assistance of the
Police.
H. A. Mayor, a Butcher of Los
Angeles, in a Sad Pre
dicament.
Fred Pries, a Wool Sorter on Harriot
Street, Also Mourns the I_oea
of His Children.
Cases of wives deserted by their hus
bands are nut infrequent in the police
courts, but the reverse side of the pic
ture Is seldom heard of, for the reason,
perhaps, that men do not care to make
their domestic troubles public property.
Two cases of such desertion came to
light yesterday and the assistance of
the police has been asked in each case
to find the erring wives and bring them
back to their husbands.
H. A. Mayor, a butcher in Los Ange
les, was Seserted by his wife about two
weeks ago. He learned that she had
come to this city with Grade, her 7
year-old daughter. He arrived in the
city Monday and discovered that his
wife had been living in the same house
with a man named Rooney and the lit
tle girl had been boarding at the house
of Miss Cunningham on Minna street,
near Fourth. He went there and de
manded the custody of the girl, but
Miss Cunningham refused to deliver
her up without the consent of Mrs.
Mayor.
Mayor went to his â wife and begged
her for the sake of their three children
to return with him tv Los Angeles. She
pretended to consent, but that night
she packed her trunk during her hus
band's temporary absence and disap
peared. Mayor has been unable to find
her whereabouts and yesterday after
noon he called at police headquarters
and asked the assistance of the police
in tracing his wife. He also stated that
Miss Cunningham refused to give up
possession of his little girl and he was
determined to have her. The mother
had deserted the other two children,
one older and one younger than Grade.
He was advised to co-nsult one of the
prosecuting attorneys as to obtaining
possession of the girl and also as to
what action he should take in regard
to his wife. The police will meantime
use every effort to trace the wife.
The other case was that of Fred
Pries, a wool sorter, living at 372 Har
riet street. He had been confined to
bed for a month with pleurisy and last
Friday was the first time he had been
able to leave the house for a short
walk. When he returned he found that
his wife had deserted him, taking with
her their two young children. She left
a note that she was tired of the life
she had been living with htm and he
need not trouble looking for her or the
children.
Pries, sick as he was, started on a
hunt for his wife and Saturday night
he found her in a saloon on Sixth street
with Frank Malley, a bartender. He
tried to get her to come with him, but
Malley Interfered and knocked him
down. He had Malley arrested for bat
tery and the case was called in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday and was
continued until to-morrow. Meantime
Pries has asked the police to find his
wife and two children.

Will Get the Limit.
The case of James Horrigan, the drunk
en shoemaker on Silver Heights, who
drove his -wife and three children from
home Monday night, was heard by Judge
Low yesterday. Mrs. Horrigan testified
that Horrigan, when drunk, used to knock
her down and kick her and beat the chil
dren. He had also threatened to kill
her and she believed he would carry out
his threat. The children corroborated
their mother's testimony, and Horrigan
was convicted and ordered to appear for
sentence this morning.

LURING BOYS
TO BLIGHT
THEIR LIVES
Pupils of the Public
Schools Betting on
the Races.

Their Conversation Tinged With

POLICE DO NOT .'ARE.
Lads Who Boast of Their Winnings
or Lament ghe "Tips" Which.
Made Them Losa.
Here are a startling series of facts.
Boys of San Francisco not only have
the privilege of betting on races, but
they are encouraged to do so. Men
who must be devoid of all conscience
accept the money of the youngsters and
make returns sufficient to keep the
gambling spirit alive among children.
Lads wager their money freely. No
matter how they obtain it, they have
no right to thus waste It, and they
should be protected even against .the
knowledge which enables them to in
vest in chance.
Probably the information will come
with a shock to parents and cause them
to wonder why such a state of affairs
is permitted. There can be no answer
unless that the police are blind.
There is no question but it should be
stopped at once. Any man who re
ceives the money of a boy In this way
is a criminal, a menace to the com
munity, debaucher of morals, a crea
tor of thieves, in a word, a dangerous
character. Yet the unholy system is
not interfered with although there is a
police force supposed to regulate such
matters and even now a Grand Jury
in session.
"Say, fellers, I've got to be put next
or I blow the whole show. You chumps
haven't been touting me worth a cent,
and last week I quit $6 out. It don't
go. You fellers got on the inside and
you are jingling dough by the flst full
and I am broke."
Nearly a dozen boys ranging in ages
from fourteen to eighteen years were
talking in the yard of the Adams Cos
mopolitan School on Eddy street yes
terday telling of their luck with the
race horses the week before, and one
of them was lamenting his losses.
"I told you to get down good and
hard on O'Connell," one of the group
replied, "but you thought you knew it
all. You don't deserve to travel in our
set if you can't take a hint without
having a house fall on you. Next time
just watch us and you will wear dia
monds."
"I am not kicking about that, but
you told me to play Buck Massie. All
you fellers said he was a hot favorite
and sure to win, and I dropped another
dollar on that tip. Then you gave me
Lucky Dog for a good thing, but he blew
up in the stretch and where did I get
off? There is no Jingle In that pocket
now. I will go It alone after this and
see what luck I will have. I would
rather take Cohen's tips than yours.
When I played them I always had
some dough."
Cohen conducts a poolroom in a room
of the lodging-house at 36V& Geary
street. Boys are his particular patrons
and a crowd of the pupils of the Adams
Cosmopolitan School are frequent vis
itors of the place.
According to reports of many of the
pupils of the school playing the races
Is a common pastime among a number
of the scholars. It is reported that last
week Ed Conroy won $35. Bert Spring
also made a good winning, but how
much he is too well versed in the
practices of the track to tell.
Arthur Allen came out of the week's
betting $"> ahead, and Fred Benson
also claims to be a winner. Paul Fitz
morris lost a small sum and then quit
for the week. Harold Spring, It is re
ported by the pupils, also made a win
ning. A number of other boys, it is
claimed, join these lads in their ven
tures making pools of a few nickels
each and placing their money on fa
vorites picked by those who- claim to
be better posted on the ways of the
horses.
Most of the money, the boys say, is
handled by Cohen, who keeps a com
mission place at 86^ Geary street.

IMMESHING
THE HARBOR
COMMISSION
Slade Says That Stratton
Advised H ir D to
Compromise.
New and Important Evidence as
to the Slade-Dundon Prof
its oq Lumber.
Judicial inquiry into the Harbor
Commissioners* methods of doing busi
ness, especially the lumber business, is
(bringing to light some very interesting
' facts, particularly In the way of en
lightening the people how the State's
money is squandered. Also how cer
tain dealers are favored and how oth
ers are arbitrarily shut out from hav
ing any of the patronage for furnish
ing supplies and materials.
According to the books of the com
mission thousands of dollars were paid
out for lumber between the dates of
March, 1897, and January of this year. !
Those who have implicit confidence in j
the integrity of all State officials, in- j
eluding the Harbor Commissioners, no i
doubt believed that the best of mate- i
rial was purchased at the most reason- (
able prices. How far they were correct
may be Judged from several peculiar
transactions recently brought to light.
As_flgures speak louder than words the i
annexed will no doubt open the eyes j
of the people to the fact that the Com- !
missioners during the past year have
paid more for the lumber than the !
market prices, notwithstanding the
contract they had with S. E. Slade, '.
who represented the firm of Darby :
Laydon & Co. This is the way the j
Commissioners audited and paid the :
bills that run from March, 1597, to the
first of the year:

At the time these figures were being '
paid for lumber the market prices were ,
much lower, as shown by the following ;
figures, which are the cargo prices for
ordinary or standard sizes, delivered
in this city:

December 12 oo in 00
Some idea of the significance of these
figures may be had from the explana
tion of J. F. Clark of the firm of Byx
bee & Clark, who showed that the
State paid out from $2 50 to $4 per
thousand feet more than the lumber
could have been bought in the open
market. In the first place there i 3 a
material difference between No. 1. and
No. 2 lumber. The first is the best
Douglas fir or Oregon pine, clear and
free from blemishes of all kinds. The
second is more or less full of seams,
knots and pitch seams and possibly
rot. Therefore if the State pays for
No. 1 grade and gets No. 2 grade the
profit to some one must be large at the
end of twelve months. From what the
dealers say the bulk of the lumber
furnished to the Harbor Commission
ers has been of the latter kind, and the
figures show that the best quality was
bargained for. In fact, nearly every
one who put In a bid did so Intending
to fill orders with No. 2 material. Some
of these facts were learned from Mr.
Clark, whose firm put in a bid for the
contract on last March.
According to the story William
Inglls. whose father was on Commis
sioner Colnon's bond, and offered to
get the contract for the firm with the
understanding that he was to have a
fair commlsnlon for the favor. Inglls
explained that by virtue of the rela
tionship between his father and Col
non he wan able to secure the Influ
ence of the Commissioner In Byxbee's
fÂ«vor. There were many Interesting
! conversations between these gentle
men, and Mr. Clark was Informed that
while the call for bids was under
stood to mean No. 1 lumber, still No. 2
of fair quality was generally delivered
. and accepted. Upon this basis Mr.
Clark put in his bid for $7 40 per 1000
feet. As soon as the bids were opened
Inglis saw that he had been "thrown"
by his friend.
Mr. Clark, In speaking of the delay,
said he was sure that the Commis
sioners had decided to give the con
tract to Slade, but he was determined
to put in another bid, and to this end
he wrote the following letter to the
Commissioners:
SAN FRANCISCO, -March 9, IS9B.
To the Hon. State Board of Harbor
', Commissioners, San FranclÃco, Cal. â
' Gentlemen: Our bid under date of
March 2, to furnish you with lumber, not
having been accepted by you, we hereby
i withdraw the same. As new bids have
been called for, we desire to make you a
new offer, and hereby agree to furnish
1 you with pine lumber such aB you have
been using for repairs on your wharves
; along the city front for $S per 1000 feet,
i board measurement, delivered.
Hoping to be favored with your busi
' ness, we remain, dear sirs,
Very truly yours, BYXBEE & CLARK.
This letter was in line of the propo
sition to work in No. 2 lumber, for
the writer stated that he would furnish
"such as you have been using for re
pairs on your wharves along the city
front." Byxbee & Clark's last bid was
an offer of $8, and the other bids
ranged down to $7 40 per thousand,
excepting Slade's, which was "at the
market price." The latter was accept
ed. Upon this Mr. Clark said: "It is
well understood that while the con
tract calls for the best lumber, the
quality known as No. 2 is furnished.
So you see by taking second-class
lumber and paying more than first
class prices there was a loss to the
State of from $2 50 to $4 per thousand
feet. Even first-class lumber at the
prices showed by the Commissioners'
bills would make the amounts paid for
lumber more than the market prices,
as contracted for in Slade's bid. It
was our first bid that set the price on
lumber for the first four months, and
then the Commissioners began to pay
more and more for what they got."
It will be noted in the table of mar
' ket prices given that prices took a Jump
between September and October. This
was caused by the lumber combine
agreeing on fixed prices on October 23,
but at no time since the beginning of
last year have the market prices been
more than $12 for No. 1 and $10 and
$11 for No. 2. Still the State has been
excessively paying several dollars per
thousand for lumber that the dealers
say is rated as No. 2.
Mr. Laldlaw of the Bibbs Lumber
Company declares that the contract en
tered Into with Slade is no contract at
all. He says that the law requires the
price of the article offered to be given,
or for a stated time or for a fixed
amount of material. He said: "By this
slipshod contract, If it can even be
called such, the State has been filched
out of thousands of dollars. There are
plenty of dealers who would have fur
nished the best of lumber at the ruling
prices of the market and still the State
would have been better off In a finan
cial way. It is a belief that many
thousands of feet of lumber have un
necessarily been purchased, for new
lumber Is called for every time a lit
tle patching is necessary. The ques
tion is what becomes of the old lumber
which comes from the sheds and fences
that are being torn down all of the
time?"
SLADE ON THE STAND.
Admits Having Compromised With
the Pacific Company.
It Is a good deal like pulling an ele
phant's tusk with a cotton thread to
place the facts of the rottenness and
culpability of the Harbor Commission
on the records of Judge Belcher's
court.
Just the same, link by link has been
â¢welded the proof of the manipulation
by the Dundon-Slade jobbers of a
robbery contract system, which never
could have been established or fostered
without connivance and collusion.
It Is worth while recording that with
the notable excepti6n, which will be
cited in full, and a few briefly worded
outbursts, Mr. Stratton yesterday
took his battery of objections in out of
the wet.
S. E. Slade, the side partner of P. F.
Dundon, was on the witness-stand the
larger part of the day, without show-
Ing any indication of recovery from
the stroke of Colnoncitis which at
tacked him yesterday Immediately af
ter he had taken oath to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the
truth. He "didn't know," he "could
guess," he did know a few things, but
they were "secondary and hearsay";
he was "not a good witness, " and alto
gether the playful aptitude of his fail
ure of memory and want of knowledge
was interestingly in contrast with the
more morbid dumbness and dullness
displayed by other witnesses who are
in the harbor contract "push."
Slade set out by startling the court
and the attorneys of the Paraffine
Company by explaining that he had
found one of the missing books. For
a moment it was thought that the wit
ness had decided to remember and to
know something, but his examination
had scarcely begun before the expecta
tion vanished. He stated that the so
called firm of S. E. Slade & Co. began
some years ago as an incorporation.
It was merged into the incorporation of
Wood, Slade & Thayer, which was
succeeded by the Incorporation, S. E.
Slade & Co. When asked why he did not
remember about the Wood, Slade &
Thayer incorporation while on the
stand Tuesday, as soon as he could
swallow the lump that Jumped into his
throat he said he did not recall that
he had denied Its existence.
"The year of 1894" was as nearas Slade
could fix the date at which the Wood,
Slade & Thpyer Co. ceased to exist, or
THE SAy FKAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1898.
the date of the last meeting of Its di
rectors.
"Were you not the vice-president?"
asked Judge Belcher.
"Yes, sir." ' "~" 1 'IWÂ»W|
"When did the directors hold their
last meeting?"
"Some time in 1894," replied Slade,
Bmiling benignly on the court.
Judge Belcher nodded his head and
looked off into space reflectively.
Slade thought somebody ought to be
questioned who' had better knowledge
of the subject than he had. He had
testified with refreshing posttiveness
and unhesitation that he was the only
member of the firm of S. E.
Slade & Co., but had not discip
lined himself to think and speak
of the firm's business as his personal
affair throughout the affair. This un
conscious declaration led him unguard
edly and constantly into speaking of
Stratton Seriously Objects.
"our business," and otherwise referring
to the firm as a plurality.
"You say you are S. E. Slade & Co.
yourself; what do you mean by 'we'
and 'our?' " asked Judge Cope.
The witness thought it sounded bet
ter. For the same euphcmious reason
he had adopted the title of S. E. Slade
& Co.
Counsel for the Parafnne Company
then called Slade off the stand to at
tend an examination of the books. The
latter were almost under the hand of
G. F. Wright, Slade's attorney, who
rose to his feet at the corner of the Jury
box nearest the witness. When Mr.
Sullivan started to turn the leaves of
the first book he took up filade, acting
under the advice of Mr. Wright,
stopped him. The following legal cross
fire resulted:
Mr. Sullivan: Is there anything In that j
book you won't let me looK at on this
page? I was looking at a page and he
covered It up.
George T. Wrightâ Tf your Honor
please, it might be appropriate to sug
gest at this stage of the examination of
the witness that I appear here to repre
sent Mr. Slade. The witness is summoned
here and, of course, he occupies a dual
capacity. First, there is the duty he
owes to the court to tell such facts as
may be pertinent and material to this
inquiry; second, there is the right which
is due* and owing to him to preserve his
business secrets from the prying eye 3of
a business rival. So that Mr. Slade's po
sition in this matter may not be misunder
stood in any direction, I will say that
Mr. Slade is here and is perfectly willing
that your Honor shall look over every
page of the books which he has produced
here in evidence. Not only that, but he
Is willing to submit to you any scrap of
paper or any document which he has in
his office, whether it is correspondence of
a business nature or of a private or fam
ily nature. But he certainly insists upon
his right here in the production of his
books, to his claim to consider inviolate
his transactions with other people than
the Board of State Harbor Commission
ers. He is perfectly willing to exhibit to
counsel any scrap of those books which
throws any light on the dealings with
the Board of State Harbor Commission
ers, but he insists that counsel here have
not the right of an inquisitorial nature,
under the mask of a subpena duces te
cum, to go into his private accounts and
reveal his private business transactions.
If your Honor will indulge a few refer
ences
The courtâ There is no doubt about that.
It is not necessary to cite any authorities.
But this is not a production of books for
examination by a business rival; this is
a production of books for the counsel on
one side of the case to examine with re
spect to matters under inquiry. This in
quiry is not intended to be and cannot be, j
in fact, an exposure of the business secrets
of Mr. Slade to business rivals. Mr. Slade
has submitted to the court his books; he
is here in obedience to a subpena, and the
books under his charge are being examined
by counsel, and not by a business rival.
There is no risk of exposure of business
secrets. The counsel will not be permitted
to inquire or examine into business se
crets that are not relevant to the inquiry
here, but merely as touching the facts
that do relate to this inquiry. If it is
necessary to make any exclusion from the
courtroom, you can have that exclusion.
If you are afraid that the secrets of his
books will be exposed to ears that are
hostile. But there is no intention so far
revealed on the part of counsel for the
plaintiff to examine further than the
issues of this case may fairly warrant,
and certainly none will be granted.
Mr. Wrightâ lf your Honor please, I
have a case here that seems to throw some
light upon the question. I must confess
that I found considerable embarrassment
in finding so little in the law on the rights
of a witness under a subpena duces
tecum.
Mr. Sullivanâ Before counsel proceeds
to any argument. I suggest that it is a
very unusual proceeding for a witness
subpenaed in a case, to appear in court
with an attorney to represent the witness.
That is certainly an anomalous proceed
ing. Witnesses are not entitled to appear
in court and state their objections
through counsel. The only counsel in this j
case authorized to speak under the law
are the counsel for the plaintiff and th*>
counsel for the defendants. If during the
course of the examination of the witness
Improper questions are asked it is the
duty of counsel representing the defend
ants to make the proper objections. Those
objections may be made by counsel rep
resenting the defendant, and by none
other. It is our duty then to answer
those objections. If your Honor would
allow one witness to appear in court ac
companied by an attorney every witness
In a case can come in here with an attor
ney.
The Courtâ l think the statement of
Mr. Wright Is sufficient. I am entirely
satisfied that It was made in the proper
spirit; but I cannot listen to his argu
ment.
Mr. Wrightâ No extended argument. I
simply want to call your Honor's atten
tion
Mr. Sullivanâ Counsel has no standing
here at all.
Mr. Wrightâ l have no standing except
that which courtesy of counsel and the
discretion of the court will give me.
The courtâ Hand me the book and I will
examine it.
The book Is handed to the court, after
which counsel and the counsel in the
case confer at the bench.
Mr. Wrightâ lf your Honor please, Mr.
Slade is perfectly willing to submit to
your Honor's suggestions in the matter
and allow counspl In the case the fullest
latitude in the examination of the books,
under their promise, of course.
Mr. Strattonâ lf your Honor please, I
would like to have It appear on the rec
ord that which was suggested by the
court, which, with permission of counsel.
I might state. That is this: In so far as
any objections have been made to the
inspection of the books. It has not been
made upon other than legal grounds by
the Board of State Harbor Commipssion
ers, which of course I will formulate in
a proper objection hereafter. But the ob
jection was altogether by counsel for Mr.
Slade as to the inspection of his business
secrets, and he stated to the court in my
presence that if counsel would give their
word that which they saw there which
did not relate to this' case would not be
divulged, he was perfectly willing he
should take those books and make a
thorough examination of them. I would
like the record to show that, in order that
it might not be inferred indirectly or
otherwise that the Harbor Commlsssion
eres were objecting or were In any way
a party to the refusal or the objection of
the witness to produce those books.
Mr. Copeâ We would like to know If
Mr. Stratton does or does not object to
the introduction of this testimony.
Mr. Strattonâ l will make a legal objec
tion that anything that Is in the book, or
any entries in the books, not made by the
board or with their knowledge and con
sent, is not binding upon them. That, of
course, I have a right to make, for the
reason that I would not be here in the
capacity of attorney and permit incompe
tent and secondary evidence, as I take it,
subject, of course, to the views of the
court, and upon that predicate a find
ing by the court as to fraud or collusion,
when the acts as to which that proof
related were without the knowledge alto
gether of the defendants in the case.
That is the position I have taken all
along in the case.
Mr. Copeâ lf your Honor please, of
course this little speech of Mr. Stratton
is very neat in its way, but it seems to
us it comes with very bad grace after his
making objections to "the inspection of the
books heretofore when the court ruled
that we had a right to inspect them.
If he wants to make an objection it is
his privilege. He has a right to make
any objection that he desires to make.
We expect the court to rule according
to legal principles, and we suppose that
all his objections are legal objections, or
what he regards as legal objections. If
he has any to make we would like to
have him make them before we go Into
the matter.
Mr. Stratton â The time has not com<
now. There Is another time.
Mr. Copeâ Then I don't sco that
Stratton Tamely Objects.
time had come for Mr. Stratton to make
a speech.
Mr. Strattonâ lt was proper, because
the court and ourselves have reached an
agreement which was not In the record.
Mr. Copeâ We say Mr. Stratton had
nothing: to do with the agreement that
was made.
It was finally directed by the court
that the attorneys in the case, together
with Slade, should examine the books
during the recess hours.
Slade deliberated quite a -while on the
stand before he answered "Yes" to the
inquiry as to whether P. F. Dundon
was a member of the firm of Darby
Laydon & Co.
"Why do you hesitate?" asked Judge
Cope.
"Because," was the complacent reply,
"because I only know from hearsay."
He admitted that Dundem was his
partner in the San Francisco Timber
Preserving Company. He did not know
whether articles of co-partnership had
been filed. Each owned half. The
right to the patented process they use
was bought from Curtis & Isaacs for
$500. He could not positively say as to
the amount of business they transacted
with the board.
Slade's knowledge of the business 1
i of the "San Francisco Company" part
nership and of the creosoting process
! which he manages was also pretty
much from "hearsay." He knew some
thing in a general way about the pro
cess, but he was not an expert.
While Slade was testifying that the
"company's" expert was the foreman;
that he didn't know his name; that he
didn't know the man; that he didn't
know why he knew the foreman was
a creosoting expert, Judge Belcher,
with eyes riveted on the facial move
ments of the witness, was a study in
the physiology of attention.
After the testimony of Granville M.
Stewart of the Pacific Pine Company,
showing that the four suits of the lat
ter company against the Harbor Com
mission to restrain them from paying
the exorbitant lumber bills of S. E.
Slade & Co. were dismissed as
the result of a compromise in
tended to allow the Slade com
bine to continue their extortions.
Slade could not dodge corroboration of
the evidence. He admitted that th*
"Pacific Pine Company permitted us
to receive our pay from the Harbor
Commission. By receiving a portion
of the "he continued, and. re
gathering himself, "By our buying a
portion of the lumber from themâone
half the lumber we used, the cases
were dismissed." He knew nothing
about the Darby Laydon terms of the
compromise, although he admitted
having made the arrangement on the
part of the Slade Lumber Company.
Mr. Stratton was acting as the at
torney for the S. E. Slade Company
while its interests were involved In the
litigation of the Pacific Pine Lumber
Company against the Board of Harbor
Commissioners.
Slade testified that Stratton's advice
to him was that his right to collect
from the State was very doubtful for j
the reason that he (Slade) had fur
nished lumber in quantities, for which
the price exceeded $3000, and it was by
reason of that advice of Stratton's
that Slade made the compromise with
the Pacific Pine Lumber Company, by
which it was agreed that the Slade
Lumber Company should purchase
half of all the lumber it should fur
nish to the Board of State Harbor
Commissioners from the Pacific Pine
Lumber Company, and that the Pa
cific Pine Lumber Company would dis
miss its suits against the board and
make no opposition to the payment of
Slade's bills, which amounted to over
$10,000.
Howard C. Holmes, chief engineer for
the board, proved to be a very
straightforward and intelligent wit
ness. It would seem that counsel for
the Parafflne Company overlooked an
Important point Mr. Holmes might
have determined. He affirmed that the
ten pounds of creosote to the square
foot of piling, which Is the quantity
used under the San Francisco Com
pany's contracts, is an experiment,
though the fourteen pound, sixteen
pound and eighteen pound injections
have proved successful, according to
quoted experience and his own observ
ations.
It is fairly well known that the San
Francisco ten pound creosote piles on
the water front are a failure so far as
successful resistance to the linmoria
and teredo are concerned.
In reply to direct questions Mr.
Holmes stated that 10 per cent of the
San Francisco creosotlng had proved
vulnerable and was a failure. It
was not shown, however, whether
the estimate of the percentage of
destruction represents a relative
part of all the piles placed dur
ing the comparatively brief period
the San Francisco Company has en
joyed the especial favor of the board
in the matter of experimentation, or a
relative part of the first batch driven.
That Is to say, the success or failure
of the San Francisco ten pound creo
sote piles can only be fully determined
by ascertaining the percentage of loss
discovered in the first batch of piles
placed since they are of longest period
of trial. This is the esssentlal element
in deciding the question, and if the 10
Stratton Silently Objects.
per cent destruction of all the piles
placed Is discovered to be confined
largely to the piles first placed it
throws a different light on the value
of percentage testimony in this in
stance.
This is asserted to have been the last
of several devices to shut out the Par
affine Paint Company, though they of
fered the lowest bids on all the classes
of the specifications; and to give not
only the contract for the Green street
wharf supply, but the pile supply, for
a year to the Dundon-Slade Company.
The Parafflne Paint Company had the
right of a creosoting process, but no
plant, though they had provided for
the purchase of one at an outlay of
$25,000, to be removed to San Francisco
in the event they secured the contract.
It would require two weeks or longer
to re-establish the plant. Their inten
tions and the adverse conditions they
had to contend with, not to mention

the Investment required were well
known. They could not offer proposals
under this penalty clause for two mani
fest reasons. First of all, they could
not deliver creosoted logs In the ten
days specified, though they could per
form the Green street contract In forty
days.
Mr. Holmes testified in substance
that the multifarious charges in the
specifications, which plaintiff avers
were repeatedly made to favor the San
Francisco Timber Preserving Com
pany, were inserted in obedience to
instructions from Chairman Colnon,
who is executive head of the commis
sion. The injection of the new and ob
noxious clause in the third set of speci
cations, described as a penalty clause,
was also ordered by Chairman Colnon
and framed by Attorney Stratton.
In this lurked a large-sized nigger.
Bond was required in the amount of
$10,000 for the faithful performance of
contract. The successful bidder was
required to furnish piles at the rate of
twenty a day after notification for de
livery, and forty days were allowed for
the completion of the Green street
wharf work. A penalty of $50 a day
was to be paid for every day of failure
to deliver piles, beginning with ten
days after notification. It was further
provided that the board reserved the
right to annul the contract after the
first day of delay, and that any pend
ing suit against the contractor would
not interfere with the right of the
board to terminate the contract.
It was openly threatened that if they
secured the contract the Dundon com
bination would institute a re-straining
action, hanging up the performance of
the contract indefinitely.
Then the board could come in with
its penalty of $50 a day, and the very
i first day past the ten within which it
would be impossible for the Paraffine
company to begin delivery annul their
contract.
As stated. Mr. Holmes put this
clause, proposed by Mr. Stratton, at
torney for Mr. Slade, a half-owner in
the San Francisco Company, in the
specifications, on the order of Chair
man Colnon.
Mr. Holmes further testified that the
I building contractors always supplied
â  piles before Mr. Colnon became a mem
ber of the board. The board had two
inspectors, supposed to test the San
Francisco Company piles who never
had had any experience with manufac
tured or creosoted piles. Occasionally
as engineer for the board Mr. Holmes
had tested piles by Boring, and fouria"
a few not sufficiently creosoted. Once
in sawing several long piles it was dis
covered in the cross sections that they
were not adequately treated and they
were sent back to the company for re
treatment. ______________
WILL NOT ATTEMPT
TO COMPETE
Southern Pacific to Take
No Part in the Promised
Rate War.
The Gain on Alaska Would Not Com
pensate for Loss on the
Local Traffic.
General Passenger Agent Goodman, of
the Southern Pacific, arrived in the city
Tuesday evening from Chicago, where he
has been attending a general meeting of
the different traffic managers, called for
the purpose of coming to some agree
ment regarding through travel from the
East to Alaska.
Mr. Goodman, when seen yesterday In
his office, had nothing to say concerning
the matter that has not already been
published in The Call, further than to
state that the Southern Pacific would not
reduce its rates any more than is neces
sary to absorb the extra steamer charges
from San Francisco to Puget Sound ports.
"The northern lines have started the
ball rolling," said Mr. Goodman, "and
tickets have been sold, second-class, from
Chicago to Seattle and Vancouver for $25,
the regular rate being $51 50.
"Of course this is directly against the
agreement entered into by the different
lines; but if they break their compact I
know of nothing that can restrain them,
unless it be the interstate law, which for
bids discrimination, and that can do noth
ing with the Canadian Pacific, which runs
on British territory.
"Of course, we could cut rates also if
we wished, but it would not pay us. With
the cut and the absorption of the steam
ship rates, we would lose more on our
regular business to the coast than we
could possibly make through any ex
pected travel northward."
Unless some definite agreement is Boon
arrived at between the different trans
continental lines, it looks very much as
if the bulk of the travel will roll over
the northern lines, which will force one
another to carry passengers for practically
nothing if they once start slashing.

charge of burglary. The complaining
witness is TV. W. Funge Jr., a traveler
for an Eastern house, who is a guest at
the hotel. On Monday Fung-e went to
take a bath, leaving the door of his room
unlocked. He noticed Wall outside his
door, and when he returned $28 had been
stolen from his purse, which he had left
in the room. Wall confessed to taking the
money, and begged Funge not to prose

Dragged and Kicked.
James Tracey, a boy 12 years of age,
met with a serious accident yesterday
afternoon. He was exercising a horse be
longing to his father in a vacant lot on
Harrison street, near Eighth, when he
fell off. His foot caught in the stirrup,
and he was dragged along .the ground
for about fifty yards before he was re
leased. The horse's hoofs struck him on
the jaw and back of the head. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, wherÂ«
Dr. Thompson, after an examination,
thought that his skull had been frac
tured, at the base. His parents live at

PÂ»elflc DepÂ»rtmÂ«nt, No. 422 CtUfomU 6t, 9. J.OAKLAND WATER
COMPANIES GIVE
UP THE FIGHT
The Expose Made by The Call Has Saved the People
From the Imposition of an Increase
in Their Schedule.
President Dingee Shows by His 111 Temper That the Publica
tions in This Paper Have Brought About
the Desired Results.
The danger to Oakland from an in
crease of water rates is passed. Offi
cials of botfi water companies say that
they will not ask for an increase of I
rater, as the present schedule, so far as ]
the regular rates are concerned, is sat- j
isfactory.
The officials of both companies pay
that nil that will be done -will be to
request the Council to adjust certain
Irregularities which work a hardship ;
l, both <>n the water companies and the
* people who use water.
The officials of the Contra Costa
Water Company accept the inevitable
with smiling countenances, but not so |
those connected with the Oakland
Water Company. The latter have seen
their hopes dashed to earth by the ex- \
pose made by The Call and as a result \
visit upon this paper their wrath and
condemnation. They know that the
people have been warned and that ;
there is no possibi'ty now of their re- j
cuping Themselves for their lassos in- j
curred during the recent fight, and are i
not able to conceal their chagrin. They
resent what they term the interference
of The Call and attribute to the ex
pose all their misfortunes.
"While The Call deprecates the anger
of the Oakland Water Company offi- j
cials it feels that it will survive the \
shock of the Oakland Water Company's
displeasure knowing that it has saved :
the people of Oakland fro-m being bur- â¢;
dened with an excessive water rate.
The officials of the Contra Costa Com- j
pany have been too long before the j
public to make the mistake of acting
as their erstwhile enemy and now
friend is daing. The Contra Costa offi- '
cials smile as pleasantly as ever and
go on record cheerfully that they never â 
contemplated a raise in rates. In fact
what they want the Council to do is
to bo adjust the rates that water will
be cheaper than ever to the poor peo
ple.
President Dingee of the Oakland
Water Company has lost his pleasant
smile and his politic manner. In fact
he is rfght down mad and does not care
who \knows it.
He is so angry that he says he will '
never speak to The Call again. It is ;
all because of that little story about
the waterbacks and the pumping epi- j
c -ode. When seen by a Call reporter j
f .egterday Mr. Dingee said that there
was not a word of truth in the whole
article and that it was false from be
ginning to end. It is well that the pub
lic should know what President Dingee
saya about it, but if the waterback
story is false it is queer that President
Dingee should have "O.Ked" a bill for
a new waterback in a stove yesterday
after the article appeared. That is
what he did, and the waterback had
been in the stove for two years at that.
And about that little pumping in
cident down at Alvarado. Surely Mr.
Dingee does not say that it never oc
rurred, for that is a matter of local
history in those parts.
But President Dingee refused to
specify wherein the article was false,
â eferred to deal in glittering gen
eralities, and would not even discuss
matter. In the language of the
sporting world, he dealt a solar plexus
blow to the whole story and settled it
at once. Then, in order to stop all
controversy, he turned his face to the j
wailâ or, rather, to his desk, and de
clined to hold further converse
with anybody connected with The Call. ]
But if President Dingee will not talk !
to The Call, there are others connected
with his company who will, and
through themâ their names are with
held at their requestâ it was learned
that the Oakland Water Company
would not ask the City Council of Oak- {
land for an increase of water rates. |
All that will be asked will be a little
adjustment of irregularities.
The officials of the Contra Costa j
Water Company are modest gentlemen
and dislike very much to see their
names in print, consequently when ap
proached for their opinion regarding
the rate question they declined to talk
mless the promise were given that
v#*hey would not be quoted. As a
'result of this modesty it is
necessary' to print what may be j
termed a composite interview, which j
will embody the ideas of President j
Pierce and Superintendent Watkinson. j
ell as all the other officials and a
few large stockholders in the company.
This composite interview is as follows: j
"We do not intend going before the
City CounciL to ask for a raise in the
existing rates. We think that the
present schedule is satisfactory with
the exception of certain irregularities
which any business man can see are
wrong. We shall ask the council to
change these points, and in doing so
they will not increase the rate, but j
will; in fact, reduce the cost of water
to the poor man, while the rich man,
the man who has a large lawn and his
hous<> furnished with all the modern
sanitary conveniences, will pay for his
luxuries. As the matter now stands,
the man who has two or three bath
rooms and closets in his house pays
no more than the man with but one.
The large hotels with all modern con
veniences pay the same rate as the
cheap boarding-house's which have but
one bathroom. This is unjust and
works a hardship to the poor man,
while it deprives the company of reve
nue that rightfully belongs to it.
"All that we shall ask is justice, and
we believe that in getting it we shall
lower, rather than raise, the rates to
the general public. We desire a
Bchedule that we can send back East
to other companies for comparison
without being ashamed of it. The pres
ent schedule is of .such a nature that
this cannot be done without bringing
zidicule upon the city of Oakland.
"In water rates, as In taxes, every
* dy believes that.it is an imposition,
;io matter how low the price. We be
lieve that the present schedule is a
good one and a fair one, but when
the City Council made the changes a
few years ago and forbade us charging
for extra bathrooms or closets it did
an injustice which should be rectified.
That is all we ask or â¢ shall ask now,
and we believe the business men of the
city will see that in asking this we
I are not making a demand for anything
! but what is our due. : ; ..;
"We do not believe there will be any
I Â§ffort made to change the schedule ex
j cept on the lines of readjustment. So
| far as the Contra Costa Company is
concerned we are sure there will be no
: move that will increase the burden of
j the people. We have entered into no
i combination with the other company
; regarding any such move, nor shall
we do so. We have been indulging in
a rate war for several years and have
i entered into an agreement to stop it.
That is all there is to our 'combina
tion.' "
It will be seen from the statement of
â  both companies that they consider ex
isting rates sufficient for all purposes of
1 revenue. The officials not only deny
any intention of having the rates
changed except to regulate certain in
: equalities, but they go further and de
i clare that the existing schedule is sat
! isfactory.
In the face of this there is but one
1 course for the City Council and that is
â¢ to avoid anything like rate changing
unless it be to correct a manifest injus
'â  tice. That the water companies have
experienced a change of heart recently
is evidenced from the fact that before
; The Call exposed the danger the
friends of the companiesâ the "bluf
' â were at work among the Coun
cllmen telling them what to do in the
matter of fixing water rates.
The Call congratulates the people of
; Oakland on the fact that it has suc
j ceeded in bringing about this condi
j tion. It has had no fight to make on
either water company, but has endeav
1 ored to present a fair exposition of ex
| isting conditions and threatening dan
gers in order to prevent the consum
mation of any scheme that had for its
object the increase of rates for water.
' The workings of both companies are
matters of current history in Oakland,
and in recalling incidents and events
; the endeavor was simply to bring the
present situation more forcibly before
1 the people.

FIXING THE RATE.
First Meeting of the Water Com-
mittee â One Report.
OAKLAND, Feb. 2.â The water com
mittee of the City Council held its first
meeting to-night to fix the water rate
for the next fiscal year.
The committee consists of Council
men Henneberry (chairman), Cuvellier,
Rowe, Pringle and Earl. The report of
the Contra Costa Company was taken
up item by item, and the regular ex-
penses of construction and operation
were thought to be very reasonable.
The sum of $94,000 for interest on bonds
was a subject for discussion, and
Messrs. Rowe and Cuvellier said that,
as the original cost of the plant had to
be considered by the Council in fixing
the rates, it looked like paying twice by
giving interest on the mortgage too.
The point was referred to the City At
torney.
J. H. T. Watkinson, general secre
tary of the company, was closely ex
amined regarding the report and at its
close he took occasion to denounce the
schedule fixed for last year by the last
Council. Earl asked if Mr. Watkinson
considered there is now a legal rate,
arid he said no. Earl agreed with him.
"The schedule under which we are
supposed to be working," said Mr. Wat
kinson, "is a monstrosity. It was ar
ranged by men who knew nothing
about the business and who did not go
to people who did for their informa
tion. Apart from whether it is too
high or too low, to which subject I
do not wish to make any reference, it
is impracticable. I have been asked by
Eastern engineers to send copies of it
and I have not done so because I have
been ashamed of it. The principle on
which it is based is wrong, and it is
crude and ragged. The best schedule
we ever had was that of ISSI, which
continued in force till 1895. It was prac
ticable and could be understood. Last

year there was no examination made,
as the law requires, and the schedule
was clearly illegal."
In answer to questions Mr. Watkinson
stated that about one-half of the cus
tomers paid full rates and the other
half less, but he could not tell what the
income would have been had they col
lected all the schedule calls for. He
stated that the taxes on the income
they did receive amounted to a little
over 14 per cent.
The schedule under which the rates
were collected in 1894 produced an in
come to the company, which was then
without opposition, of $404,000, which
one of the Councilmen remarked is over
20 per cent on a two-million dollar
plant.
At Friday night's meeting the Oak
land Water Company's report will be
taken up and W. J. Dingee will be
questioned regarding his plant.
The Boiler Exploded.
William F. Golden and Charles F. Capp
have commenced suit for damages, the
former for $10,000, and the latter for $5000,
against Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson and
J. J. & W. F. Dugan for alleged negli
gence in constructing a steam heating ap
paratus, which was sold to and placed
in the plaintiffs' premises 3 Golden Gate
avenue. A short time after the appar
atus was placed in position it exploded
and Injured the plaintiffs. They allege
that the explosion was due to the negli
gence of defendants, and they sue to
recover.
DAVIS KNOWN
IN SALINAS
The Supposed Crook Iden
tified by the Sheriff of
Monterey.
Wanted in the Southern Part
of the State for Passing
Bogus Checks.
By the arrest of W. A. Davis the po
lice believe that they have the man
who has been passing worthless checks
with alarming frequency. Last night
the Sheriff of Salinas visited the City
Prison and positively identified him as
the "Eastern tourist" who had passed
a number of bogus checks while so
journing in that portion of the State.
By representing himself as an Eastern
capitalist in search of "pleasure and
recreation" Davis had little trouble in
getting rid of the worthless paper.
Shortly after 5 o'clock last evening
a well dressed, handsome young
woman visited police headquarters and
asked permission to see Davis. She
claimed that she was his wife, having
married him about eight years ago.
"I know he is innocent of any wrong
doing," she remarked. "I am sure he
will be able to satisfy everybody con
nected with the police department of
his innocence."
Mrs. Davis was subsequently al
lowed to enter the prison, where she
had a long conversation with her hus
band.
Detective Sullivan, who has been
specially detailed to find out some
thing about the career of Davis, has re
ported to Captain Bohen that he has
already obtained sufficient evidence
showing that the prisoner is a clever
crook. The description fits that of a
man who some time ago visited Los
Angeles and succeeded in passing a
number of bogus checks.
At that time he claimed he was an
Insurance agent. Captain Bohen has
written to the police of Los Angeles
asking them for the criminal record
of Davis while he was in that city.
The detectives have also learned that
while Davis was stopping at the Lick
House he changed his clothes several
times a day. He always appeared fas
tidiously dressed except at irregular
intervals, when he would leave the ho
tel dressed as a "hoosier." To-day he
will be formally charged.

BOXES MADE
IN A HURRY
This Time Girls Amuse
the Crowds at the
Mining Fair.
Cooking in the Klondike Illus
trated by Miss Edna
Davies.
All the Arrangements for the Klondike
Wedding Have Been
Completed.
Large crowds visited the Mining Fair
and Klondike Exposition yesterday and
last night and the numerous and varied
exhibits that fill the Mechanics' Pavil
ion were again objects of interest. The
chief feature of last night's programme
was the paper-boxmaking contest be
tween seven girls in the employ of the
Schmid-t Label and Lithograph Com
pany. The terms of the contest were
for the folding of fifty paper boxes.
There were four prizes and the first
was easily won by Minnie Althausen, in
6^ minutes; Maggie Dinne, second, 7
minutes; Minnie Koopraan, third, 8
minutes, and Julia Baliste, fourth, 8%
minutes.
Professor James Hillock gave a most
interesting exhibition of the rescuing
and resuscitation of the Klondike min
ers from the dangers of the Yukon
River and the mountain passes of
Alaska.
Miss Edna Davies. a graduate of Mrs.
Rorer's cooking school of Philadelphia,
who daily delivers two lectures upon
the methods of cooking in the Klondike,
is proving one of the most interesting
as well as instructive attractions of the
Mining Fair. The hours of her lectures
are 2:30 p. m. and 8:30 p. m. Large
audiences have been in attendance
upon the lectures for the purpose of ob
taining information as to- how a course
or table d'hote dinner may be served in
the region of ice and snow.
Miss Davies talks in a most forcible
manner. "I have to do it," she said. "I
am up against the band and its awfully
hard work. You see I have to yell or
my audience wouldn't hear me for the
music.
"How do I cook a meal over a camp
fire?
"It's simple enough. First you build
the fire and get a bed of hot coals, then
with a few simple utensils, such as a
frying pan and a pot to boil water in,
it's an easy matter to get up a good
meal.
"No, I am not representing or using
any particular firm's goods. I am em
ployed by the management of the fair
to teach the people the best methods of
cooking the best kinds of food, such as
are used and cooked by all the Klon
dike miners.
"In cooking beans you first boll them
and then allow them to bake slowly
in a Dutch oven.
"Vegetables are readily carried In a
miner's outfit, and are very easy to
cook. They are either desiccated or
evaporated. The former are partly
cooked and then drie<l, while the latter
are prepared entirely by a process of
drying. They are-first soaked in water
and then cooked by boiling. Soup I
make by boiling compressed soup
cakes in water and adding a sufficient
quantity of evaporated cream."
There are many other minor points
Miss DRvies illustrates in her lectures,
and after all of them she gives much
time to the answering of questions that
any person may desire to ask.
Among the features for this after
noon is the Klondike dog show.
Prizes will be awarded to all kennel
dogs that compete. There will also be
a candy batch swinging contest.
All the arrangements for the Klon
dike wedding have been completed, and
it will take place next Tuesday. The
names of the couple are Henry Miller
of Elizabeth, N. J., and Miss Fannie
Turner of 512 Eddy street of this city.
They will be presented with a huge
wedding cake weighing over three hun-
dred pounds. . .
The school children of the city will
be the especial guests of the manage
ment on Saturday.

A Health Preserver
jR'PANS TABULES]
The Tabules are a compact, convenient accurate form of a prescription
universally used by physicians in treating digestive troubles. The exact
formula from which Ripans Tabules are made is in daily use in the great-
est hospitals in the world, where the highest medical skill recognizes it as
the best preparation ever devised for derangements of the stomach, liver
and bowels. If these organs can be kept healthy and active there is little
danger of serious sickness. Almost every illness is traceable directly to
indigestion and its accompanying disorders. Ripans Tabules stimulate
the stomach, stop fermentation and make digestion easy and rapid They
stir up the liver and help it to perform its functions. They cure constipa-
tion and strengthen and invigorate the bowels so that their natural action
is restored. One Tabule is a dose. The frequency of- the dose is regu-
lated by the apparent need.

In reserves shown by the last bank statement
are evidence of the growing accumulation of
funds seeking employment at this center.
These bank fieures, however, only partially
express the real extent of the plethora. It is
necessary to take into account also what we
are lending to Europe. In my advices of last
week reference was made to the large amount
to which New York is under advances to
Europe. Those loans have since been in
creased, and it appears doubtful whether $50,- |
000,000 -would now cover the total. Other home i
centers have made like transactions. I have |
direct knowledge of two loans of $2,000,000 \
each to large German banks made by a Chi- 1
cago banking institution at 4 to 44 per cent. |
and other like transactions are said to have j
been made at Chicaxro to an amount approxi
mating $10,000,000. Advances to European
"banks have also been made by Boston banks !
and capitalists: to what extent I have no >
positive, knowledge, but estimates of the total
range between $2Â«\000.f>00 and $25,iW,0<W. Put
ting these facts together. It would appear that
this ' country is now lending to Europe $S>'.- j
OfNVMO to ??>0,000,000. This is significant, not only j
as showing the extraordinary accumulations of j
capital at our home financial centers, but also i
as r3emr.r.stratinc that we have become full j
participant* in the credit operations between 1
the world's financial centers. ab!e to lend upon ';
a larre scale as well as to borrow when our ;
convenience calls for it. The local financial !
institutions are quite disposed to encourage ,
these operations, as the only means of pre- |
venting a glut of gold which we do not need ;
and averting a still lower rate of interest.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 2.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet and Irregular to-day,
politics being the prime factor. You may dis
trust all the rumored details of the Chinese
loan, but look for a speedy arrangement of the
matter.
Americans were irregular. Ontario and
Western was naturally the feature. Central
Pacifies were bid here at the close. Interest
in Americans is spreading and the feeling here
as to the course of the market is very confi
dent.
Spanish and Turkish stocks were good, the
Paris Bourse being buoyant in tone, with fur
ther eager buying of Tlntos and Debeers. The
allotment of Indian council bills excites com
ment, telegraphic tranfers being sold not un
der 16c, but below exchange of the day. A
very small supply of American bills Is arriv
ing. It is believed that New York Is holding
them back.

weak during the afternoon.- Prices had. in the'

may be mentioned California loose raisins. Ab
sence' of demand or c some ; time past. It Is
reported, has had depressing Influence on mar
ket values both here and on the although
jas yet there has. been no quotable change In
j prices. On the other hand, it is said prime
stock has beÂ«n closely cleaned up and that
! eoods that come up to the standard will com-
I mand full i prices. Seeded raisins are rather
easy, as a result of sharp . competition, and
the fact that buyers' are -well supplied, but
there has been no further change In quotations.
j Seedless Muscatels are firm, but quiet.
Telegrams sent to . the coast offering prices
i a shade under those demanded here for . four
sizes of prunes seem to meet with little at
| tention. . We understand that bids have been
1 submitted for some ten or fifteen cars for ship
ment from California, none, of which, so far as
we can learn, has been accepted..

-d^ p lrcular from Australia says: "A total of
0918 tons from Australia In thirty days, means
short stocks en hand here now. but this will
be. relieved this month, as we have thirteen
vessels with 32.000 tons of Australian j coal due
here before March. The loading list at New
o?^i and Sydney has been increased about
000 . tons since last - mail : left . (January 6):
in A^, PcP c Ported coal engagements footed up
â  0,000 tons capacity. , now 86,000 tons. Of the
tnirty-nlne vessels chartered, only sixteen have
bo tar been loaded. Freight rates on coal from
Newcastle are reported, firm, 15 shillings be
ing freely ; paid for 'future loading, and the
pveserit . outlook â¢ for a brisk demand a few
months hence is 'most encouraging. Our rain
ran to date Is most unpropitlous for our far
mers, and the prospects for a bounteous har
vest are most discouraging. This will lead
to extreme rates of freight being paid on all
loreign coal cargoes bound herÂ», as grain ex
porters are making no engagements for trans
porting next season's crop. >
"High prices must assuredly rule the balance
or this year, for all characters of fuel, as our
northern mines will be strained to supply us
locally, in addition to the calls which will be
made on tham to coal all the steamers that
will be engaged in the Alaska trade. Jobbers
have marked up all grades of domestic fuel,
as this character of coal Is very scarce. Steam
grades so far are not affected."

DR. JOHN HALL.
The resignation, of Dr. John Hall, so
long the pastor of "the Fifth Avenue
-Presbyterian -^-Church; in New York, an
nounced on January 9, -excites interest
that reaches far beyond the . boundaries
of Manhattan Island. Thirty, years ago
he came from Dublin to take charge' of a
church known as "the richest- Presbyte
rian â -. church In America." Under Dr.
Hall that church . has been known not
only as 'the richest,: but as one of the
most religious churches in the country.
There has never been any- question as to
the influence or the primary purposes of
that church under Dr. Hall, or as to the
sort of gospel that has been preached
there, or as to its. efficiency as a Chris
tian body. From every point of view
whereof the public - has any knowledge
Dr. Hall's, pastorate has been : superla
tively successful. No reason is given for
his retirement, except: that in his own
opinion it was time to shift his labors
and responsibilities upon younger shoul
ders. â¢ '-.'.' â¢ ': ' . "
Dr. Hall is of Scotch descent, and was
born in Armagh, Ireland, in 1529. He was
educated in Belfast College, and licensed.
to preach in 1549. He preached in Ar
magh, and afterward in Dublin, and
came to New. York in .1867. During his
pastorate his church moved, from Nine
teenth street up to its present site, on
the corner of Fifty-fifth street and Fifth
avenue, where the present church edifice
and parsonage were . built ;at a cost of
more than a million dollars. For ten
years, * from 18S2 fto 1592, Dr. Hall was
chancellor of , the University of New
York. He has also, been a â  trustee, of
Princeton and Wellesley- colleges, and
chairman of the Presbyterian Board of
Home Missions.â Harper's Weekly.

THE PAPER MORRIS USED.
Mr. Morris was no advocate for
thick paper, but he had long before
found out that machine-made paper of
wood pulp and clay was useless for
permanent results, to say nothing of
the uninteresting quality of its sur
face. The latter failing as a factor by
no means unimportant in the beauty of
a bonk. Much of our shiny, calen
dered paper is, besides, trying to the
eyes. He was forced to resort to the
plain, honest way of the old-time pa
perrhakers. Unbi^arh^d linen rags
were used, and molds whose were
not woven with absolute mechanical
accuracy, thus obtaining a sort of va
riety in the surface.
This paper was made expressly for
him by Mr. Batchelor at Little Chart,
near AshfoTd. and "resembles the pa
per of the early printers in all its best
qualities." Three water marks were
designed by him for paper of different
sinesâ "the apple, the daisy and the
p^rch with a spray in its mouth; each
of these devices beine: accompanied by
the initials W. M."â From The Pratt
Institute Monthly.

Oakland Merchants
Anxious to Rival
Los Angeles.
Open a Campaign to Unite
the Three Bay
; '. Cities*
Board of Trade and the Mer
chants' Exchange in
Harmony.
LINES ALREADY DRAWN.
Conference to BÂ« HÂ«ld Next Week of
the Delegates From All Over
the Territory.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 2.
It was determined to-day to make an
attempt In the next Legislature to
form the city and county of Oakland.
For a long time this movement has
been talked, about, but until recently
nothing definite was done. Now it has
been settled that the same procedure
ehall.be adopted as that which resulted
in separating Tulare and Kings counties
and the campaign will begin at once.
This Important move will bring forth
all kinds of support and opposition
from the cities and to^ns interested.
Undoubtedly so far as Oakland is con
cerned .the consolidation will be ac
ceptable. It is one of the few proposi
tions on which both the Board of Trade
and the Merchants' Exchange are a
unit. A few days ago the Board of
Trade passed a resolution pledging its
co-operation to work for the proposed
city and county of Oakland.
Last night the Merchants' Exchange
took even a more radical stand. It
passed a resolution practically declar
ing that it would be useless to under
take any permanent improvements in
this city until such time as a consoli
dated government is an accomplished
fact. This action was taken after a
discussion regarding the selling of the
City Hall site, the members concurring
in the opinion that until the consolida
tion was accomplished the exchange
will look with disfavor upon any prop
osition looking to the disposal of city
property.
In a few days' time a conference will
be held between representatives of
Oakland, Alameda, Berkeley and
Fruitvale upon the subject of uniting
all under one government. Secretary.
Shappe of the Board of Trade was one
of the organizers of the campaign that
resulted in the establishment of Kings
County, and he is working along the
same lines here as were successful in
the south.
An attempt will be made to secure
the pledged support of all members of
the Assembly from this county in fa
vor of a bill creating a city and county
of Oakland and a county of Alameda.
It will be in the power of the Legisla
ture to attach to such bill any pro
vision they may see fit; for instance,
the Legislature may pass a bill mak
ing the consolidation a fact right away,
or it may attach a clause ordering the
matter referred to the people, and
Etating whether a majority or a two
thirds vote shall be considered neces
sary for its passage.
The lines of the new city and county
as at present proposed will include the
three bay cities and the territory in
cluded in a line from the eastern end
of Bay Farm Island to Temescal Creek,
along Temescal Creek to the boundary
line of Berkeley. This territory will
include a population larger than the
city of Los Angeles and a much great
er assessed valuation. It would make
Oakland the second city on the coast,
and would at once obviate many of
the difficulties of local legislation now
existing.
There will, however, be some oppo
sition. Colonel John P. Irish, who is
a member of the Board of Trade, is
not in favor of the movement. When
asked for his. objections to-day he
â aid: ".It we are to take San Fran
cisco as a specimen of a consolidated
government I cannot see where there
lfl anything to encwurage us moving in j
the same direction. If we are to be- j
lieve what we hear and read, San \
Francisco's administration is and has
been a hotbed of corruption and every- j
thing that is detrimental to public in- i
terests, and we certainly do not want
to follow such an example. Oakland
needs to Improve herself and show ;
what she can do before wanting to '
swell out and cover a whole lot of ter- :
ritory- If an y one c &n convince me i
that a city and county of Oakland will
be any better than our present con
dition then I shall be prepared to ad
vocate it. But it will take a good deal !
to convert me,"

CUNNING GYPSIES.
Woman Robbed of a Lot of Silver
ware and a Valuable Shawl.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 2.â Yesterday after
noon two gypsies who have been telling
fortunes called at the residence of E. *iÂ».
Bolton on Tregloan place and offered to
forecast Mrs. Bolton's future. After some
parley at the door they were allowed to
enter the house, when they proceeded to
make themselves very much at home, and
prophesied a most marvelous career for
the lady. In the meantime, they hail
been sizing up the place, and chanced to
notice some old silverware in a cupboard.
At once they were filled with the deepest
solicitude. "They assured Mrs. Bolton
that upon the sl.ver rested a deep, dark
curse which they had not noticed while
they were portraying the bright future
for her but whirh was destined, if not
removed, to fill her life with woe unutter
able. Some one had put a hoodoo on the
silver, which was "bound to be fatal to the
happiness of its present owner so long as
it remained in her possession.
Mrs. Bolton is an invalid, and the dire
forebodings of the gypsies filled her with
fear What could she do to ward off the
doom? That was easy, said the gypsies.
All she had to do was to let them have
the silver and never more should hoodoo
trouble the former owner. She was only
too glad to get rid of such an awful
thing, and turned the silver, worth about
$75 over at once to the crones.
But this did not suffice. In some way
they became aware that Mrs. Bolton had
a valuable cashmere shawl, worth some
$150 and this. too. they wheedled the
owner Into giving them, after which they
departed. When Mr. Bolton reached home
in the evening his wife told him how for
tunate she had been in getting rid of the
bewitched valuables; but he did not see
things in that light, and at once started
out to find the gypsies and recover his
property. He had not succeeded up to
this afternoon.
HIS ARREST
A MISTAKE
Prominent Society Man
Suspected of a
Burglary.
Young English Spends a Day
and a Night in the
City Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 2.
For a night and a day the younger
| son of John English was missing and
: yesterday he was found at the City
Prison, where he was detained on sus
picion of being the burglar who took
a gun from a room in the Merritt House
about a week ago.
The whole affair seems to have been
a great mistake and when everything
j was explained young English was at
' once released from the jail. Tnere is
; a possibility that a suit Tor false im
prisonment may yet be brought, as
; there does not appear to have been any
! foundation for the arrest.
A little before midnight on Tuesday
night a student named E. Doncrhue was
i taken to the prison and was charged
| with drunkenness. He had not been
: long in the cell before young English
came to visit him. As soon as he ap
: peared at the booking counter Sergeant
! Peterson thought he recognized him as
\ a young man who was wanted fcrr
! stealing a gun at the Hotel Merritt.
; The officer's information had been eb
: tamed from a roomer at the house
i named Wesley Barnes, who saw the
j burglar coming down the stairs, and
i the young man who wanted to see
â . Donahue so closely resembled the de
scription that he was promptly arrested
; and kept in prison.
English protested his Innocence, but
| his story was not believed and yester
1 day his family was notified. Explana
! tions were made all round, and without
! being taken before a Judge English
: was released by Chief Lloyd, who was
convinced that his officers had made a
serious mistake.
It now appears that Mr. English
I bears a most striking resemblance to
i some one not so honest, and this like
; ness led to the arrest. The two youths
; must be very much alike, for when
| Wesley Barnes saw English he was not
i prepared to swear that he was not the
i burglar, although English had not the
' least difficulty in satisfying the police
i of his entire innocence.
The landlord of the Hotel Merritt
said to-night that he had never seen
: young English at the hotel. The inci
dent has created great interest, as the
; Englishes are one of the best known
: families in the county.
CURRY HAS THE POWER.
The County Clerk Controls the Print-
ing of Transcripts on Appeal.
City and County Attorney Creswell ren
dered an opinion ypsterday a3 to the right
of the Board of Supervisors to regulate
the printing of transcripts on appeal by
the County Clerk.
He holds that the County Clerk alone
has power in the matter, under section
1246 of the Penal Code, which regulates
the manner of taking appeals In all the
counties of the State. Mr. Creswell's
opinion is, in the main, as follows:
"The section as amended is a general
law. If in conflict with section fiO of the
consolidation art it repeals it by Impli
cation to the extent of the conflict. It
regulates the manner of taking appeals
in every county of the State. It is not
the city and county printing, although
it Is a county charge. The Clerk is the
custodian of the ifoords mentioned in
this section of th* Penal Code, and Is the
officer who by law Is burdened with the
duty to transmit a printed copy of them
to the clerk of the Appellate Court with
in the time therein specified after the
filing by him of the notlre of apppeal
Nowhere Is the Board of Supervisors
mentioned in the section. Nowhere is
there a reference to any pre-existing
statute which gives a Board of Super
visors supervision over this matter
"I am, therefore, of the opinion that
the Clerk, with whom notices of appeal
In criminal cases are filed, has the right
and It is his duty to give out the printing
of transcripts on appeal."

All the Car Companies

If Opposed by Supervisors They

A WARNING WELL HEEDED
Hereafter Klght Miles an Hour Will
Be the Limit on the Mission-
Street Line.
A meeting of representative* of the
Market Street and San Francisco and
San Mateo Street Railway companies
was held yesterday, at which a fender
was adopted for use on their cars.
The device is one used in several of
I the largest cities of the Union.
The fenders will be attached as rap
i idly as possible, and if any opposition
! is made by the Supervisors the com
panies will appeal to the courts for Jus
tice and protection.
The letter of warning sent by Mayor
Phelan on Tuesday to E. P. Vining, man
ager of the Market-street Railway Com
pany, has already borne fruit. Mayor
Phelan called attention to the fact that
the law was being disregarded by the
i company, particularly on the Mission
i street electric line, where the cars have
j been traveling at the rate of twelve miles
an hour, whereas the legal limit is eight
miles an hour. The company was notified
by the Mayor that unless the schedule
] was so modified that the cars would bo
; run within the legal limit proceedings
would be at once commenced to compel
it to do so.
A few hours after the receipt of the
Mayor's letter a new schedule was pre
pared and the announcement made that
any violation of it would mean discharge
to the offender. Under the new schedule
the motormen are not allowed to attain
speed greater than eight miles an hour,
i and under no circumstances will they be
excused for attempting, by violation of
the law. "to make up time."
The new rule went into effect yesterday,
and It is said that it will be kept in op
eration after the dilatory Supervisors pro
vide fenders to give some slight protec
tion to the traveling public.
The following letter is self-explanatory:
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 2, 1898.
Hon. James P. Pbelan. Mayor City and
j County of San Francisco â Dear Sir: Your let
i ter pf yesterday reached me this morning. In
. reply thereto. I would respectfully state that
â¢ every effort has been made to adjust our time
j tables so as not to conflict with the State law,
! and at the pame time to rive the public as
! efficient a service as practicable. The aver
â¢ age speed of some of our electric lines Is as
low as Plx miles per hour, fifty-two minutes
i being: allowed on the Third and Kearny street
i line for maklnc a run of 5 18-100 miles. On
. other lines the average speed varies according
' to the usual number of stops, the liability of
' delays and blockades, etc., but It does not In
! any cape exceed seven miles and a fraction
I per hour.
The time" allowed on the Mlsslon-streeet line.
i to which reference is especially made, has
npver been less than the time allowed upon
j the Valencia-street cable line, which Is prac
: tlc&lly of the same length. Our motormen and
j conductors have been specially cautioned that
I they must not in any case or under and clr
i cumstances exceed the statute rate of eight
i miles per hour, and we have a special force
1 of officers known as timers, whose duty It is
I to patrol our various lines, watch the cars
i and report any Infractions. In case of any re
port of excessive speed, the employes at fault
i are cautioned, reprimanded or suspended, as
I the facts In the case may seem to call for.
; while no case has ever occurred In which an
' employe has been In any way punished for fall
inc to make the schedule time.
We have fully recognized the binding obll
: gatlons of the law and have been governed by
| It. notwithstanding the fact that the law was
! adopted at a time when horse cars were the
i customary means of conveyance, and when a
] speed of eight miles per hour was the cus
tomary speed at which horses were permitted
' to travel. The Introduction of electricity as
AN EXAMINER,
MISREPRESENTATION.
The following bulletin was
flared in the window of the Ex
aminer's business office yester
day for the ostensible purpose of
deceiving its readers:
"At a conference between Her
rin and Yining to-day It was
agreed to place fenders on cars."
A report of the meeting of the
street railway officials that was
held on Tuesday when such ac
tion was taken was published in
yesterday's Call.
a motive power has. In most sections of the
country, been hailed as a means of enabling:
the speed to be increased beyond the ordinary
speod of horses, and thus giving to the public
a more efficient and satisfactory service. In
most cities of the country the legal rate of
speed has therefore been made from twelve to
' fifteen miles per hour, and In the suburbs a
speed of sixteen, eighteen or twenty miles per
hour is frequently allowed. In scarcely a city
in the country is there a lower limit than ten
miles per hour for the most crowded portions
of the city.
Karly In the year 1595 the Legislature of the
State of California passed an act raising the
speed to ten miles per hour. The act failed
I to receive the Governor's signature, and thus
! railed to become a law, yet the Governor's ob
i je<-tlons related wholly to other portions of the
act, and If the provision regarding speod had
stood by Itself It undoubtedly would have re
ceived the approval of the Governor, as well
las of the members of the legislature. Thft
! people of the State of California, by their rep
! resentatlves, have therefore expressed their
I disapproval of continuing In the present day.
I and applying to electric cars tht limitations
i which in a former generation were prescribed
for horse cars. Nevertheless, the law has not
; been changed, and it is both our duty and In
; tentlon to comply with it. I mention the fore
| going facts merely as explanatory of the rea-
I son 3 why we have thought It for the best
' interest of nil concerned to run aa close as
' possible to the time limit of eight miles per
i hour, without over-running It.
While we believe that no legitimate ground
I for complaint has existed In regard to our
i past action, we understand that the Super
1 visors of the city, by their resolution, No.
612. request a lower rate of speed for electric
cars, and that your honor, as Mayor of the
city," concurs therein. We are anxtoue to give
the people of the city a satisfactory service,
and if a reduction of the rate of speed is more
' satisfactory to them than the present eon
; ditlons, we shall glndly be governed by their
wish We are therefore preparing a new time
table, â¢whl'-h will allow twelve minutes more
for a round trip from the Mission street car
house to the ferry and return than has here
tofore been allowed, and which will make a
trip via the Mission street electric line cor
i respondlngly slower than a trip via the Va
! lencia .street cable line. This time table will
be put in effect as soon as practicable, not
later than next Monday, and corresponding
changes will be made as rapidly as practicable
upon other electric lines.
In this connection It may not be Improper
i to call attention to the fact that fully ion,
i 000 people In San Francisco take the street
i cars in the morning from their homes to
! places of business, to return again by the
j street cars In the afternoon. Five mlnutas
extra upon each trip Is equal to the entire
time of 2000 men working eight hours per day.
[ which, at the *verage r%te of $2 50 per day,
!s equal to a loss of $5000 per day experienced
by the citizen* of San Francisco by an un
necessary detention of five minutes each
morning, and another five minutes each af
ternoon.
The ground upon which a reduction of speed
!s requested Is that of safety; yet I see no
reason to believe that Hny speed can ever
be adopted which will make it safe for parents
to permit little children to play alone In the
crowded streets, or for people, who from dis
ease. Infirmity or Intoxication are unable tc
take proper care of themselves, to step sud
denly in front of either a locomotive or an
electric car In motion. As a matter of fact,
a number of the mest serious accidents have
been occasioned by children and others run
ning suddenly In front of a car that was
moving at a speed of not more than three or
four miles per hour.
The Btreet railway lines have made It pos-
Flble for citizens In moderate circumstances tc
dwell with their families in the outlying dis
tricts. Instead of crowding Into tenement
houses In the business section of the city.
and any reduction In speed limits the districts
which can be occupied for residence purposes,
and thus forces an additional number to look
for homes In the basements and garrets along
the crowded business streets.
In your letter you state that our cars are
without proper brakes and fenders.
I know that the multifarious duties of your
honorable office must make It almost Impossl-
We to rive any preat length of time to any
one of the tens of thousands of subjects call-
Ins for your attention, but with your per
mission. I will take the liberty of explaining
the farts In reerard to brakes and fenders, go-
InK Into the subject somewhat fully, but mak
inK my letters as brief as Is consistent with
properly covering the facts In the case. Each
of these two matters will require a letter of
6ome length, which I cannot find time to pre
pare tn-day, but which I will forward to you
as early as possible, before the close of the
For the present. I will merely state that we
know of no better brakes In use anywhere
than those used upon our cars: and that the
so-called fenders which are In use In the va
rious cities of the country have proven them
selves to be not only useless, but so dangerous
that they have KTeatly added to the number
of accidents and fatalities. Yours very re
spectfully, E. P. VOTING.

ure were discussed and very little oppo
sition to the progressive step was mani
fested. Many of the large clubs of East
ern cities have found it desirable to pro
vide restaurant service for the wives and
sisters of members, and the University
Club of this city has derived much of its
popularity by reason of its maintenance
of an annex for ladles.
The meeting at the Pacific Union last
night authorized the directors to go
ahead with the needful preparations for
the accommodation of the ladles.
AUSTRALIA VS.
CALIFORNIA
International Boxing Bouts at
the Olympic Club This
Evening.
ThÂ« Ryan and Choynski FJght
May Not Taka Place,
After All.
This evening the Olympic Club will
hold a professional boxing tournament in
its gymnasium on Post street, and Griffo,
the clever Australian fighter, will 'meet I
F. McConnell of the San Francisco Ath- ;
letic Club in a fifteen-round bout, and
"Cocker" Tweedie, also of Australia, will
meet J. Lawlor of this city in a ten
round contest. The first event will be
called at 8:30 o'clock. Owing to the heavy
expense attending these contests, a |
charge of XI will be made for members, j
Tickets admitting non-members will be i
sold at the office of the club at $2 50 each.
In all probability Phil Wand will be se
lected to referee the contests.
The betting at Crowley & Raggett's i
poolrooms last evening was $10 to 58 on ;
Tweedie whipping Lawlor and $10 to $7 on |
Griffo getting a decision over McConnell. |
The general opinion is that the Austra- '
Hans will have a walk-over. At any rate, ,
the gamblers who bet on prizefights are !
playing the two invaders and the sports
Who favor home talent are putting their j
coin on Lawlor and McConnell.
A report was circulated yesterday that
the Australians were not in condition, and |
that they would come out on the short i
end, but a visit to the training quarters !
of thÂ« men proved beyond any doubt that I
the foreigners were in tolerably good
condition, and that they were sanguine
of pulling down the long end of the
purses.
Unless the managers of the Empire Club '
agree on a disputed point to-day It is !
extremely doubtful if the Ryan and
Choynski fight will take place on the
evening of the 10th inst. Ryan has lost j
heart over the report concerning his im
promptu scrap with Lansing, and as a
consequence he feels rather upset and
may throw up the sponge to-day. The I
managers of the Empire Club will meet
this afternoon and decide whether the
match will be held according to an
nouncement or be declared off, according
to the wishes of those who had hereto
fore taken a very active interest In the
club's welfare.
Peter Jackson and Jim Jeffries started
to train for their twenty-round contest
to-day at Oakland and Alameda respect
ively.

Henderson A. Boyakln. otherwise
knowji as "Henry Boyd" and "Henson
Boyakin," seems to be possessed of
the mantle of invisibility which proved
to be of priceless service to Its wearer
in one of the most charming of fairy
tales. More than that, the mantle not
only seems to render him invisible, but
also to cast a glamour over the senses
of those who seek him for the purpose
of doing him evlL
Mr. Boyakin is a wood and coal
dealer at 3612 Nineteenth street in this
city. His name, occupation and ad
dress appear in the City Directory
regularly every year, and one would
therefore naturally suppose that his
place of business would be easy to
find. Yet a Deputy United States
Marshal searched for him with a war
rant for his arrest for nine months,
and returned the warrant unserved,
with the explanation that he could not
be found.
Boyakin was indicted by the United
States Grand Jury on April 2, 1896, as
"Henry Boyd, alias Henson Boyakin,"
for procuring false affidavits concern
ing his claim for a pension. A bench
warrant was issued on the same 'day,
and it was placed in the hands of the
United States Marshal. It was re
turned on January 7, 1896, as unserved,
the deputies having been unable to
find him. On the warrant the true
name was given as Henry Boyd. while
on the back of the warrant the sup
posed alias was spelled "Boynakin."
Boyakin would have remained In
visible to the eye of the law, and the
indictment against him might have
moldered away with the lapse of years
had it not been for his mother's love
of money. She had been a witness
before the Grand Jury in the matter,
and late in September, 1897, she called
at the office of the clerk of the United
States District Court for her witness
fee for one day. In response to ques
tions by Deputy Clerk Fonga she said
her son was living near her and keep
ing a coalyard on Nineteenth street,
where he had been continuously in
business for the past seven years.
On the following morning Boyakin,
having learned from The Call that he
was wanted by the Federal authorities,
walked into the United States Mar
shal's office, having left his cloak of
invisibility at home, and surrendered
himself. He furnished bonds in the
sum of $2500 and went his way.
That was on September 24, 1897. More
than four months have rolled by since
then, and Boyakin has never been ar
raigned in court to respond to the
question as to whether he is innocent
or guilty. The glamour of forgetful
ness seems to have settled down upon
the big Federal building, so far as the
lucky Boyakin. is concerned, and it
would not surprise any one should he
walk into court one of these mornings
and demand that his plea of "not
guilty" be received and placed on rec
ord.
Deputy United States Attorney Bert
Schlesinger was asked by a Call re
porter yesterday why Boyakin had
never been arraigned. He replied that
he did not know, except for the reason
that there was no pension agent here to
try the case; that Notary Public Poole,
the principal witness for the prosecu
tion, had died and that it would be
very difficult to convict Boyakin on
that account.
Mr. Schlesinger added that Pension
Agent Anthcny would arrive in a short
time, and that Mr. Boyakin's case
would then be taken up.
It is expected that the case will be
called in court about the time of the
completion of the long proposed and
long deferred Hall of Justice.
ALL GUILTY OF MISCONDUCT.
Benewal of Hostilities in the Suit of
Parrott vs. Leszinsky Imminent.
Vituperation is beginning to bubble In
the trial of the action of Abby M. Par
rott against Attorney George Leszlnsky
for unlawful detainer, and before it is
ended as many interesting episodes as
came to pass in the first trial of the case
are expected. Yesterday the first signs
of a personal feeling cropped out. P. J.
Sullivan, agent of the Parrott building.
was on the stand, and, in answer to a
question put by Lepzinsky, he made ex
planation regarding a certain conversa
tion th.it took place between Leszinsky
and the witness after the Emporium
Company had dissolved. The answer did
not satisfy Lezlnsky. and he drew the
record of the first trial and made an
endeavor to prove a variance in Sulli
van's testimony.
Robert Y. Hayne at this bounded to his
feet, and in stentorian tones objected to
the action of Leszlnsky in producing the
record. He said the court should "call
him down" for his act. Leszlnsky con
sidered Hayne's interruption* misconduct,
and asked that such be noted on the
record.
Attorney Dunne then tossed in a few
sarcastic remarks, and Leszlnsky re
taliated that his remarks be noted on the
record as misconduct. Judge Dainger
field here Interrupted, and Leszlnsky at
tempted to admonish the court for not
holding opposing counsel in contempt.
"The court should be careful," said At
torney Dunne," or Attorney Leszinsky
will adjudge him guilty of misconduct.
All present smiled at the remark, and
hostilities for trie time ceased. The case
will go on to-tlay, and whether or not
peace will reign cannot be foretold.
Awards to Local Merchants.
Carlton H. Clark, commissioner to the
Exposlcion Centro - Americano recently
held in the city of Guatemala, has just
received official advices from President
Yrigoyen of the exposition giving a list
of premiums which -were awarded to ex

hibitors from this State. The State of
California receives honorable mention for
school laws of the State and laws and
statistics of the State Normal School. A
great number of the local merchants re
ceive gold medals and honorable men
tion.
The following diplomas of honor were
awarded by the grand Jury: His Excel
lency, James H. Buod. Governor of the
State of California; Hon. Carlton H.
Clark, commissioner of the State of Cali
fornia; Hon. Carlos Periera, delegate
from the Chamber of Commerce, San
Francisco: General Jose Salazar, sec
retary of the California commission, and
the following gentlemen composing the
special committee of San Francisco ex

dent; Hon. E. R. Lilierivnal, treasurer;
Hon. N. F. Walter, secretary; Hon. Mau
rice F. Lowenstein. Hon. Percy T. Mor
gan. Hon. James Hogg, Hon. Frank L.
Brown.
Commissioner Clark states that there
has been a notable increase in the con
sumption of California products which
were exhibited in this exposition, and pre
dicts that the trade throughout Central
America will be materially augmented in
the future through the advertising which
the State has received. Unfortunately
the low price of coffee, combined with
the temporary financial and commercial
depression, is proving an obstacle just
now. California should feel proud of the
recognition which she has received in this
exposition, which speaks well for 1 the
State, as well as the individual exhibitors.
For Opening Letters.

the United States Grand Jury for taking
a letter from the San Jose postofflce ad

Judge de Haven, where he pleaded not
guilty and was released on $500 bonds.
His trial was set for March.
ILLNESS OF A
RAILROAD MAN
John Sedgwick, the Freight
Agent, in a Precarious
Condition.
He la Extremely Popular Among the
Business Men of This
City.
John Sedgwick, who for a number of
years has been freight aeent for the
Southern Pacific In this city, is In a very
precarious condition, having caught a
very severe cold several days ago, and is
now very ill at the St. Nicholas Hotel.
Mr. Sedgwick is the father of Mrs.
"Fred" Merritt, Mrs. T. T. Dargie and
Miss Flora Sedgwick of Oakland, his
youngc-st daughter Flora, since the de
cease of Mrs. Sedgwick a number of years
ago, residing with her sister, Mrs. Dargie.
Mr. Sedgwick, since his wife's death,
has been at the St. Nicholas Hotel, at
which place he is at present so ill.
The sick man is over 65 years old and
is one of the most popular men in the
Southern Pacific employ, besides being a
most trustworthy man in his position.
His daughters are now stopping at the
hotel during their father's illness, and
while as yet the doctors say that there
Is no immediate danger, owing to the
man's age it is thought better that the
daughters be with their father.
DRIVEN FROM THE RUSH
BY ILL TREATMENT.
Story of Four Men Who Took French
Leave of the Revenue Cutter
at Sausalito.
SAUSALITO, Feb. 2.â Four men de
serted from the United States revenue
cutter Rush last night, and if their stor
ies are true, they have been treated
shamefully. They asserted last night
when they left the ship under cover of
darkness that Lieutenant Hall had abused
them.
It seems that two of the men were
ashore yesterday on liberty and should
have returned to the ship by 8 o'clock
in the morning, but they failed to turn
up. The small boat pulled off for them
from the cutter and landed at the wharf,
and then the coxswain deserted also. This
made three, and the trio got together and
agreed to take French leave, but before
going they put up a job to get back their
belongings, which were in their rooms on
the Rush.
Arrangements were made with the man
on watch, and at 9:30 o'clock last night
the trio visited the cutter and secured
their clothes and other belongings. A
fourth man, who had seen the actions of
the deserters, asked to be allowed to go
along with the party also, and he was
granted the privilege. Two of the men
are McAull and David, one is a Swede,
and the name of the fourth man could
not be learned. He is the coxswain. They
left Sausalito last night In a launch for
San Francisco.
CREATES A SCENE IN
COMMITTEE ROOMS.
Representative Henry IT. Johnson
Denounces the Policy of the
President.
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â Representative
Henry U. Johnson created a scene in the
Banking and Currency Committtee of the
House to-day. The meeting was secret,
and the members are reticent concerning
the incident, but it is learned from a
trustworthy source that the Congressman
made a speech; denunciatory of Chairman
Walker and of the President. Chairman
Walker resented it, and told Mr. Johnson
he would not permit the further use of
such language. It was personal to him
self, and he would appeal for protection
in his position as the head of the com
mittee.
The trouble arose over the attempt of
Mr. Walker and other members of the
committee to report a bill embodying
only the President's recommendations for
currency reform, the extension of banking
privileges and the decrease of tax and
the authorization of banks of small cap
ital. Mr. Johnson declared this bill would
not meet the country's expectation for
currency reform and that it was proposed
to sidetrack the Monetary Convention's
plan. Mr. Johnson accused the President
of a half-hearted financial policy, and
said he was more interested in Hawaiian
annexation than in currency reform. He
declared he would denounce the Presi
dent's policy on the floor of the House.
QUITE A POLITICAL STIR.

apnointment has caused quite a stir in
political circles, because if future nomi
nees fall of confirmation Ash will con
tinue to fill the position.

WANTS THE BOARD OF
MANAGERS RESTRAINED.
Judge Lorlgan Listens to the Griev-
ance of Steward Young of
Agnews Asylum.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 2.â Judge Lorigan toi
day gave a hearing to the writ of pro
hibition sued out by F. C. Young, stew
ard at the California Hospital for tha
Chronic Insane at Agnews, to restrain
the board of managers from hearing thei
charges preferred against him . by tha .
medical superintendent. Dr. Sponogle;..
The latter, who is a Democrat, discharged
Young, who Is a Republican and a Union
veteran, on September 7. and the charges
were presented at a making of the board
on the following day. The writ was sued
out on the ground that Young would not ;
get a fair trial, as a caucus, bo It was
alleged, had been held at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco some time in Au
gust, at which it was determined to oust
him and put in a brother-in-law of Isaacs
UphaiiKone of the trustees.
At tifb hearing to-day the managers
were represented by Henry S. Carter,
Assistant Attorney - General Nicholas
Bowdeh appearing for the petitioner. An
attempt was made by Bowden to intro
duce evidence relating to the Palace Hotel
caucus and to Young's efficiency, but the
court ruled It out, holding that the only
question at issue was whether or not the
board had Jurisdiction to hear the charges
and act upon them. Testimony was given
showing that Young had been served with
a copy of the charges, which set forth
that he had neglected his duty in various
ways and that the board was proceeding
to hear them when the notice of the writ
was served. Argument will be heard to
morrow.

: Some days ago Bookmaker John

at the end with Don Clarencio beat
that horse out a head in 2:,1%. Willie
Martin dropped the 2 to 6 favorite, The
Bachelor, in a close third. Forty yards
from the wire. Spencer thinking lie had
the race won with the Don, slackened
h!s rein or he would havt^ been re
turned the winner.
As usual "ladies' day" was marked
by one or two curious performances,
though the favorites more than held
their own by capturing four events.
Thorpe, consistent as ever, was past
the wire first on two occasions.
The most startling acrobatic feat of
the afternoon was that performed by
the two-year-old Santello, racing in the
colors of TV. J. Spiers, the owner of the
crack Eprinter O'Connell. In his pre
vious races the youngster gave promise
of making a very useful animal for the

street-car service. Yesterday, with
Charley Maclin up, he was played
from Â£0 and 40 down to 8 and, getting
away first to a straggling start, led
Milt Young, the favorite, out a length.
For this sudden improvement the sta
ble was suspended from racing for
sixty days.
The second race at seven furlongs
went to the favorite Kamsin, ridden
by Thorpe. Running second to Mori
nel to the stretch, the bald face there
took the lead and won easily from the
second choice Plan.
The original third race was declared
off and a mile selling affair substituted.
It proved to be a gift for the Corrigan
entry, George Lee. The gelding was a
1 to 2 favorite and won galloping from
Polish, a 9to 1 chance. Miss Ross had
early speed, but tired i^ the stretch,
finishing third.
The steeplechase over the short
course was the best yet seen at the
track, there being some semblance of
contest. All five of the starters fenced
well; and in a hard drive Mestor, rid
den to excellent advantage by Peters,
led Governor Budd over the line two
lengths. While making rapid strides
to the front, Silverado, ridden by Stan
ford, which, with Mestor, ruled equal
choices in the betting, fell. Stanford
escaped with a shaking up.
The final seven-furlong run was only
a walk for the good colt Maxello. He
was an 11 to 20 choice in the betting,
and. assuming the lead before the turn
for home was reached, passed the stand
eased up a couple of lengths In front of
Prince Tyrant. Ed Gartland had speed,
but quit in the stretch.

Fifteen Hundred From Vera Cruz
â¢ on the Santa Rosa.
The seizure of 4000 smuggled Mexican
cigars on board the steamer Orizaba last
Tuesday was followed yesterday by the
seizure of 1506 Mexican cigars smuggled in
on the coast steamer Santa Rosa.
The Santa Rosa was docked opposite
the Orizaba and a watch was kept on
both vessels, the former having stopped
at San Diego after the latter had made a
brief stay there on her way up from
Mexico Yesterday morning two police
men on the dock reported to the customs
Inspectors that two waiters had taken
two valises from the Santa Rosa, and
had placed them In the baggage room on
the dock. The inspectors found in the
valises 1500 choice Mexican cigars from
Vera Cruz, and confiscated them.
On receipt of this intelligence Collector
Jackson gave orders that the Orizaba be
searched from stem to stern for smug
gled goods.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1898.
ANOTHER BAR
TO CHINESE
Far-Reaching Decision by
United States Judge
de Haven.
Action of the Collector of the
Port to Have Nc
Weight.
Recommendations of Referee Heacock
Set Aside and His Report
Disaffirmed.
United States District Judge de Haven
rendered an opinion yesterday which
will have the effect of erecting another
strong barrier against the landing of
Chinese laborers and criminals. The
opinion is to the effect that the action
of the Collector of the Port is not even
prima facie evidence of the right of a
Chinese to land, and that it should not
have any weight in the minds of Com
missioners and Judges when fraud has
been shown.
Judge de Haven "disaffirmed" the
report and recommendation of Com
missioner Heacock in the case of Lav
Sun Ho, a Chinese woman, admitted
to this country in December, 1898, by
the Collector of the Port on her state-
ment and the testimony of witnesses
that she was a native of California.
Seven months ago Ho became dissatis
fied with the life of a chattel slave and
went to the mission on Washington
street. She told the women at the
mission that she was a native of China
and that her statements made to the
Collector of the Port were false.
The evidence Introduced before Com
missioner Heacock was not at all vol
uminous or convincing except as to
the declaration made by Miss Ho at
the mission.
This is the first time that Judge
Heacock's report in a Chinese case has
been disaffirmed.
Judge de Haven quotes the follow
ing from the report of United States
Commissioner Heacock:
The only material evidence submitted
for my consideration is the order of the
Collector of Customs of said port permit
ting her to land, and the testimony of
Mrs. Hull, who understands the Chinese
language, of the Methodist Mission,
where the defendant has been for the
last seven months, and of' Look Gum, a
female Chinese interpreter there, to the
effect that the defendant told them sev
eral times in the Chinese language since
she has been at said mission that she
was born in China, outside of vanton,
that she had been deceived in coming
here and that she wanted to be returned
to her mother in China, and, further,
that she had been taken by them to said
mission from a house of ill-fame in Ross
alley, in this city.
Had there been no previous investiga
tion and decision by an officer having full
jurisdiction to hear and determine the
right of the defendant to enter the Unit
ed States, I should have no hesitation in
finding that she was born in China and
a subject of the Chinese Empire, for she
arrived at said port from China, she
speaks only the Chinese language: In
dress, features and general appearance
she resembles Chinese females, and her
own statements given In evidence are
i that she was born in China.
Upon what evidence the Collector de
cided that the defendant was entitled to
enter the United States and to remain
; therein I am not advised, but 1 must as
! sume. and I have no doubt that the cvi
i dence was ample to warrant his deris
ion. Such decision having been duly
made, the burden of proof is upon the
Government to clearly establish that it
was obtained by means of false and
: fraudulent representations. I find that
the foregoing evidence is insufficient to
sustain the allegations of such false and
! fraudulent representations or to set aside,
'. cancel or annul the decision of the Col
[ lector that she is entitled to land and to
! be and remain in the United States.
Judge de Haven's opinion then goes
on to say that no exceptions had been
taken to the findings or recommenda
tion of the special referee.
But," continued the court, "the ac
tion of a Collector of Customs in per
mitting a Chinese alien to land in this
country is not, in any sense, judicial,
and does not fall within the rule appli
cable to decisions of special tribunals
of the character of those which have
been referred to. The law does not give
to such order or permission the effect
of a judgment that such person is en
titled to land in the United States.
â¢ * * The order of the Collector is
not even prima facie evidence of his
right to remain in the United States."
The court thereupon ordered Lav
Sun Ho deported.
Commissioner Heacock, in an inter
view on the subject, said: "During the
progress of the case I called the atten
tion of counsel to the fact that in a
former case in whicb Mr. Tuska ap
peared for the defendant all the evi
dence taken before the Collector was
introduced. In this present case Mr.
Riordan for the defendant asked for
the evidence that was taken by the
Collector. The whole record was
brought down from the Chinese bu
reau, but none of it was introduced by
the prosecution except the order made
by the Collector permitting the woman
to land. So that even now I don't know
what evidence was taken by the Col
lector."
The prosecution was conducted by
United States District Attorney Foote
in person.

TERPSICHOREAN
CLASS MEETS
Second Meeting of the Fashionable
and Popular
Club.
The Terpsichoreans, one of the most
fashionable and popular of the dancing
classes, held their second meeting of the
season last evening at Native Sons' Hall,
more than 200 invited guests attending.
The affair-^ was rather more elaborate
than the usual meeting of the classes.
The hall was handsomely decorated in
pink and white bunting, and potted
palms, ferns and cordons of greenery lent
an artistic finish to a delightful ensemble.
The hours of the dance were from &
till 12. During the entire evening a buffet
supper was served.
The patronesses of the Terpsichoreanâ
Mesdames Theodore Blakeman, Joseph
Sadoe. Tobin, Crittenden Thornton, Robert
Bruce, Richard T. Carroll, C. M. Keeney,
Patton and S. G. Buckbeeâ acted as a re
ception committee.
The Terpsichoreans had intended to
give a previous dance, but their date
clashing with that of the Tevis ball, de
cided to postpone the affair until Easter
week.
Mrs. H. Slnshimer held a reception last
evening at her home, 1808 Pine street

asked the jury to investigate the man
agement of the pound during the past
year. That will make public the rea
sons why the Board of Supervisors
ousted, the society from the manage
ment of the Institution in May last
and placed Osborn in charge, and also
why In November last the conduct of
the place was taken from Osborn and
given to the society again, and also
why Osborn was again made pound
master by the Board of Supervisors at
their meeting on Monday last
It will be shown that while Osborn
and the Board of Supervisors were in
charge of the institution that the
pound was used as a political machine
whereby the friends of the Supervisors
benefited while others who were not so
fortunate as to have a Supervisor for
a friend were compelled to pay a rev
enue to the political friends of the City
Fathers. The city's streets were over
run with mangy curs and worthless
animals, while good and valuable dogs
and other animals were taken to the

who were unfortunate enough, not to
have a pull with the Supervisors were
compelled to pay dearly for their re
lease. The revenue for dog licenses
fell off to almost nothing, and the city
lost many hundreds of dollars. Mat
ters became so flagrant that a long pe
tition was presented to the board ask
ing that the management of the pound
be again placed with the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
and on November 29 last Secretary
Holbrook was again in charge of it.
He was not there a week before he
made himself unpopular with several of
the Supervisors, of whom Delany was
the leader. Holbrook refused to recog
nize the requests of a number of the In
dividual Supervisors asking for the re
lease of the impounded animals of their
friends without the payment of the cus
tomary charges that are provided by
A SUPERVISES METHOD OF SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1898.
A .
the ordinance establishing the pound.
Hardly a day passed after Holbrook
was in charge for the second time that
some person whc-se dog had been
caught on which no license had been
paid would not call at the Animal's
Home, as the pound is named, with a
written request from Supervisor De
lany asking that the dogs of some of
his friends be released without the col
lection of the prescribed fee. Holbrook
refused to honor them and Delany'a
Ire was roused.
J. J. Flanagan reported to the direct
ore of the Humane Society that in con
versation with Delany about ten days
ago the "wrathful Supervisor remarked
that "no crowd of psalm sing
ers 6hould run any institution" he, as
Supervisor, had anything to do with.
"We will oust that crowd from the
management of the pound."
To Director Seymour of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals Delany remarked that Holbrook
was an A. P. A. and he used most dis
respectful terms in alluding to him as
such.
John Sheehan, who was apparently
with Delany in his attack on Hol
brook, went to Frank Kane, the secre
tary of the Society for the Prevention
of Vice, and asked if Holbrook was not
a member of the A. P. A. society. Kane
replied that Holbrook had long been
connected with the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children and
during his connection with that or
ganization he had placed many of the
children who appealed to the society
for protection In Catholic institutions
and that the directors and managers
of those institutions always had the
kindliest feelings toward Holbrook.
A few years ago a Grand Jury com
menced an investigation of the actions
of the then members of the Board of
Supervisors, who were particularly
free in giving orders on the Pound
master for the release of captured ani
mals on which no license had been
paid. It was known then the city was
being defrauded out of considerable of
Its revenue, and the Supervisors who
had been most flagrant in the abuse
had a request to the Poundmaster
printed. It was so worded as to give
an impression that it came as an .order
of the whole board, and inserted in
the clause asking for the release of
the animal were the words: "With
out cost to the city." Those words
served to defeat any charges being
brought against any of the Super
visors, but if the Poundmaster let the
animal go without collecting the fee
on such requests he was liable. The
Poundmaster at that time was usually
an irresponsible person, and, as he was
beneath the notice of the Grand Jury,
no action was taken against him when
he accepted the orders and so defraud
ed the city.
When the Society for the Protection
of Cruelty to Animals was In charge
of the Pound such request or requests
of any kind were refused unless the fee
was paid and the city's fund increased.
When Osbnrn, under the care of
the Board of Supervisors, was In charge
of the Pound â a period of time from
early In May last to November 29 â the
owners of dogs In the city took out
only 124 dog licenses. Mangy curs
filled the streets, and citizens were
continually complaining of the nuis
ance. Then the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals took charge
of the Pound.
Secretary Holbrook was placed In
charge of It, and during the two
months up to the present time the
mangy dogs have been cleared off the
streets. Nearly 2500 licenses for dogs
have been Issued, making a revenue to
the city of $2500. The expenses of the
Pound have been during those two
months about $400.
Among the dogs captured In those
two months was one owned by Super
visor Haskins. A few hours after it
was landed at the Pound the Super
visor appeared at the office of the in
stitution and demanded the animal. He
was asked to pay the usual fee of $2 50
before it would be delivered to him.
Holbrook quoted the ordinance that
previous Boards of Supervisors framed
for the conduct of the Pound, and in
formed Haskins that no distinction
would or could be made in persons.
Haskins was not satisfied and went to
John Partridge, one of the directors of
the society that conducted the Pound.
A few hours later Haskins was back
at the animals' home with a note from
Partridge asking Holbrook to give the
Supervisor his dog, and if he would not
pay the fee to charge the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
with It. Haskins got his dog, but the
money the city received for the unli
censed animal was paid out of the
funds of the Humane Society.
In the Investigation it will also be
shown that Supervisor Morton sent
word to Secretary Holbrook a few days
ago to the effect that if he would not
fix the organization he was an officer
of so that the requests of the Super
visors to release impounded animals
should be granted they would be oust
ed from the Pound.
Will Investigate the Hall.
The Grand Jury evidently intends go
ing into the matter of the delay in the
completion of the Hall of Justice. At
the request of W. H. Thornley, chair
man of the Committee on Supervisors,
Clerk Russell of the board has trans
mitted him the reports of the com
mittee on public buildings and also the

and Attorneys Goodfellow and Coogan
after a long conference arrived at a
decision and the result of their delib
erations and agreements was presented
to the president of the association in
the form of a letter.
This letter of agreement dealt with
the fixing of rates of insurance, cc-m
missions to brokers, rebates to those
taking out policies, penalties, etc. It
remained unanswered until yesterday
and the long silence led the Commis
sioner to believe that the underwriters
had decided to disregard the agreement
made with him, especially as the com
panies began an action in injunction in
the Federal courts restraining him
from revoking their licenses. Although
late President Haven made reply yes
terday in the following letter:
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 2. 1898.
Hon. A. J. Clunle. Insurance Commis
sioner, San Franolsi i>. Â«'al.
Dear Sir: Tour letter hearing date Jan
uary 22, addressed to myself as president
of the Board of Fire Underwriters, was
not received by mf- until the 25th ull.,
owing to intervening holidays. A reply
to your letter was drafted and almost
ready for transmission to you, when you
took* action relative to the bonds given
by the agents of the several fire insur
ance companies.
P.ut for such action the letter yould
have been forwarded to you on Monday
last, and I am told that our attorneys
so informed you last week. Your action,
as above stated, I find has induced some
change of opinion as to what reply
should be made to your letter. For this
reason I have concluded to call a meet
ing of the ho.ird to consider the matter,
and after such meeting has been had I
will address you further. Yours very truly,
CHARLES D. HAVEN,
President.
Mr. Haven's letter was taken as an
open "defy" and the Commissioner
acted accordingly. Without loss of
time he jumped into the ring, threw
down the glove and declared himself
out for a fight to a finish. In his
answer Commissioner Clunie says:
Charles D. Haven, President Board of
Fire Underwriter;? of the Pacificâ Dear
Sir: Yours of the 2d Inst., by way of an
swer to mine of the 22d ult., duly received
and contents noted. I hasten to reply In
order that you may avoid the necessity
of calling any further meeting of your
association to consider the matters reÂ»
ferred to in my letter. The attitude of
yourself and associates in repudiating the
agreement entered into between your at
torneys and myself relieves me from a
moÃt embarrassing situation, and while I
regret exceedingly that I should have
been deceived and misled by your mem
bers as to their intentions, I feel highly
elated to know that all affiliations be
tween us are at an end and that I now
stand free and unconnected with this
odious monopoly of which you are presi
dent and at liberty to exert the entire
power of this department to throttle and
drive out of existence this trust and ille
gal combination, formed as it Is niostly
of foreign corporations, the only object
of which in the transaction of business
in this State is to filch from our people
exorbitant rates of premium for insur
ance, the payment of which they are un
able to avoid, and which on every occa
sion invoke every possible technicality of
the law to avoid compliance with the laws
of the State, and repeatedly refuse to
contribute to the support of our gov
ernment, whose protection they are
always eager to invoke, the small pit
tance prescribed by its laws as their pro
rata of taxation.
As you must know, my feelings have
always been against any temporizing with
this monster, and that It was only by
means of repeated Intercessions by the
agents of companies interested and the
constant efforts of its attorneys, "VV. S.
Goodfellow Esq., and T. C. Coogan Esq.,
my personal friends, that I was induced
to act at all in conjunction with it, and
only then upon the granting of certain
concessions to the people of the State and
the promise of large reductions In rates
of premiums, as set forth in my letter.
Moreover, at the time of these negotia
tions I had no actual proof of the work-
Ings of the compact, but recently a com
pilation of figures showing the business
done by the Insurance companies in this
State and the premiums received thereon
during the year 1897 has been made. I
hereby give you the figures, compared
with those of 1896, when there was no
compact, in existence, to wit:
Amount written in 1898, $336,334,238; in 1897,
J334.254.126: excess of amount written in
1596 over 1897, $12,630,112.
Premiums received In 1596, $3,317,210 16;
in 1897, $4,757,019 22; excess of premiums
received In 1897 over 1596. $249,703 10.
It will thus be' seen that though the
amount written In 1897 was $18,060,112 less
than the amount written in 1896, the pre
miums received In 1897 exceed those of 1896
by $949,703 19. In considering these figures,
it is important to note that the compact
did not commence business until the
month of June, 1897, and its results for
this short period have been the immense
increase of premiums' above shown.
Inasmuch, as yotfr association has seen
fit to repudiate the acts of its attorneys,
whom I believe have acted in the best
of faith with me in the matter, and fur
ther consideration and developments hav
,ing satisfied me that my first Impressions
concerning this association were correct,
I deem that I am Justified in withdraw
ing all suggestions or agreements look
ing toward any joint action between this
department and your bog.rd, and I now do
so. Accordingly It will be wholly unneces
sary for you to cull any meeting of your
board, as suggested by you, to consider
any matters mentioned In my previous
letter. And in order that you, and all
other of its members, may not be taken
unawares, I desire to now notify you that
I consider that every company belonging
to the so-called Board of Fire Under
writers of the Pacific is a member of an
organization opposed to the laws and the
policy o* this State, and that each of

FATE OF A BAD
BOLD BURGLAR
Only Escaped by the Chance
of Not Being There to
Be Caught.
The Alarm Which Roused Henry
Street and Scared Four Women
to a State of Panic.
There are many people who do not
know that there is a Henry street in this
city, but there is, and Henry street hav
ing had a burglar scare, comes forward
for a general recognition. Not that there
was a burglar; to enjoy a really first
class burglar scare does not require the
presence of a burglar, and an affair of
this sort Is really rounded out to com
pletion more satisfactorily when the burg
lar will stay away. The actual presence
of a burglar Is distasteful to persons of
refinement, however much they might ap
preciate and revel in the thrills of a
scare.
On the street mentioned, at No. 71.
lives Mrs. Bamburg. She once had a visit
from a burglar, and ever since has been
timid. To her the footfall of a passer-by-
Is a menace, and in the rattling of a loosf
shingle she discerns the distressing cer
tainty of being robbed. Mrs. Bamburg
lives downstairs. On the floor above re
side Mrs. Garrison and her daughter
Alma. Mrs. Bamburg also has a daugh
ter, whose title is Blrdfe. Tuesday night
Mrs. Bamburpr and Birdie went out and
so did the lodgers upstairs. In a little
while the first pair returned and soon
Birdie was asleep. The mother, with
customary caution, lay awake and lis
tened for the footfall of the burglar. She
thought she heard it. This is the reason
Henry street turned out In a body to
slay the Interloper, tore pickets " from
the fence wherewith to brain him. and to
the Bamburg shouts of "fire, murder,
police," added a sounding volume and an
Impressive emphasis.
No burglar venturing to come forth and
be killed, a young man said he would go to
the back porch and there make such a
racket that the burglar would be forced
to flee, and would of necessity flee into
the arms of \he waiting community. The
young man went and raised a racket
which lived up to the terms of the con
tract; but the burglar was coy. Not being
there he could not rush out to be cap
tured. The burglar must be held blame
less for this apparent dereliction. But
somebody did come. The lodgers put their
heads from the upper windows and later
themselves from the door, and did what
they could to augment the loud alarum.
But Mrs. Garrison, being both deaf and
blind, however, could not readily com
prehend the situation.
The Garrisons were to blame. They had
come home without the Bamburgs know
ing it, and it was the innocent tread of
the pair which had sent the Bamburgs
Into a panic so pronounced as to infect
the whole neighborhood. Yet none would
snatch a laurel from the young man. To
make so much noise as to scare a deaf
woman Is no small feat.
The patrol wagon came thundering up.
Then it went thundering away again.
Henry street went to bed. as is there con
sidered meet, and the stone-deaf lady did
not hear another sound. But everybody
concedes that there might have been a
burglar there.
Requested an Autopsy.
Charles Koch, a baker, 52 years of age.
who has been residing with his family at
2125 Mason street, died suddenly last
evening from causes unknown. At the
request of Mrs. Koch, the body was re
moved to the Morgue for the purpose of
holding an autopsy, as Mrs. Koch is not
satisfied that her husband died from nat
ural causes.

or without removal. J. Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission.
A Horse Killed Him.
Arthur McDevitt, a teamster, ,42 years
of age, who was kicked by a horse on
January 31, died last evening at his resi
dence, 16 Godeus street. The Morgue was
notified of the death, but an Inquest was
waived, as Dr. Clinton, the attending
physician, testified as to the Injuries and
the fatal result.

NO REBATE FOR
MAYOR PHELAN
Judgment Rendered Against
Him in the Supreme
Court.
Interesting Case Which Grew Out of
the Widening of Dupont
Street.
The suit of Mayor James D. Phelan to
recover a rebate on taxes paid by him
under protest was yesterday decided
against him in the Supreme Court. The
caÃe is of long standing and grew out of
the widening of Dupont street some years
ago.
Under an act of the Legislature passed
in 1576 the authorities of the city and
county of San Francisco were given
power to make improvement on Dupont
streetâ principally that of widening the
street. A commission was appointed to
estimate the benefits and damages, and
It was found that the damages amounted
to $914,941. To meet this expense, bonds
were issued, payable In twenty years, and
the property benefited by the widening
was assessed to pay the bonds and inter
est. James D. Phelan refused to pay
the tax upon the Phelan -block, corner of
Market ani O'Farrell streets, and the
Tax Collector threatened to sell the
premises to pay the taxesâ s69,92l 18. Mr.
Phelan protested against the payment,
and brought suit for rebate, alleging that
bonds should have been issued in tin*
amount of not over $915,000, the amount
of the damage, and that, therefore, there
was an overissuance 0f585,000. He further
claimed the illegality of the act on ac
count of the Tax Collector neglecting to
levy upon all of the benefited property.
The Superior Court decideil against him
and in fa\or of the city and county. The
Supreme Court has affirmed that judg
ment. It says:
It was expressly held In Easterbrook vs. San
Francisco, 44 Pacific Reporter. 800, and again
In Davis vs. San Francisco, 115 Cal., 6S, that
the city and county of San Francisco cannot
be compelled by .virtue of the provisions of sec
tion 3819 of the Political Code to refund any
of the taxes paid under protest for the Im
provement of Dupont street.
If one pays an illegal demand with full
knowledge of Its Illegality his protest does not
take from the payment Its voluntary character,
unless the payment is necessary In order to
protect his person or property. The payment
of a tax to prevent a threatened snle of real
estate Is not compulsory, unless the convey
ance by the officer will have the effect to de
prive the owner of some defense to the tax or
throw upon him the burden of showing its Ille
gality.
The plaintiff's obligation to pay the tax is
not affected by the omission of the Tax Col
lector to enforce Its collection against other
property. If the tax against that property is
not collected the bondholder? may have some
reason to complain, but the burden upon the
land of the plaintiff la neither Increased nor
diminished by reason of such omission.
