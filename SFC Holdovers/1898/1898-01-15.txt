NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â A spe
cial cable to the Sun from Ha
vana, via Key West, says: The
situation continues very grave,
with a great deal more fighting
than yesterday, and with ser
ious results. Since last night the
rioters, better armed, have given
haul \vrk to the troops of Gen
eral Ar.-ias, Military Commander
of Havana. In spite of the pres
ence of troops, the rioters,
strongly armed, gathered in
great numbers in prado in
front of the building of the Cen
tro Gallego, or Gallician Club,
and also at Campo de Marte, not
far from there, which is the
largest park in the city. About
midnight they became so threat
ening that General Arolas sent
twocavalry detachments against
th m. The Government forces
charged, and the rioters after
some resistance dispersed.
This evening rioters got to
Central Park again, notwith
standing the heavy forces there,
where several of th*>m took pns
â¢>f a large one-story
a r.J-n <â > uj.;es ,i whole
block, called Manzana Gomez.
From the top of it they firea
sral shots into Central Park,
lally at the office of
Diario de la Marina, wounding
b. A fierce attack
was made by the tro, , ps on Man
zana Goniez, and the rioters
finally wore dislodged. The
wounded in this sffray were
treattd at the police sanitary
stntion.
Martial law is practically in
force. Th" condition of public
disorder and the tremendous ex
citement continues. Rioters pa
rade the streets in defiance of
the troops, arms in hand and
shouting generally: "Long Live
Weyler!"

"2 "Our latest advices from Con
â¢2 sul-Gent-ral Lee are to the effect
** that all is quiet in Havana.
22 Should there be any further out
*. break dangerous to American
% interests a naval vessel will be
â¢2 dispatched to Havana to afford
c* them protection."
This statement made to-day by As
sistant Secretary of State Day con
tains the latest information received by
the State Department regarding tho
situation in Havana, the attitude of the
administration on this rfew phase of th^
Cuban question and the naval precau
tions which have been taken to m<*r>t
any possible emergency. It may be said
that th^ President will not fe^l easy
until a sufficient length of time has
elapsed to show there is no likelihood
of a repetition in a more aggravated
form of thr- riots of Wednesday. While
hopeful that the Spanish authorities
may be correct in stating that the dan
ger is past, they are fearful that the
recent riots may be more significant
than the Madrid officials are willing to
admit. They are apprehensive that
It may be a death blow to autonomy.
While having no intention whatever of
putting any obstacle in the way of a
tuance of the present Spanish
Cuban policy, th^ administration is
making preparation to meet any con
tingency which may result from the
now situation on the island. As a re
sult of cable dispatches received r-arly
this morning fn m Consul-General Lee
and deliberated upon at the Cabinet
meeting the authorities have been very
"active to-day in perfecting arrange
ments for affording immediate relief for
Americans and their interests in Ha
vana in case they should be seriously
endangered. To show the concern of
th<? President and his anxiety to be
fully prepared for all possible events
it is only necessary to mention that
Commander F. W. Dickens, acting
chief 'of the Bureau of Navigation, ap
peared before the Cabinet to-day and
gave the President and his official fam
ily information in regard to the pres
ent positions of various vessels of the
North Atlantic squadron. As a pre
cautionary measure the President
wants to be assured that the navy is
In condition to meet any new develop
ments that may occur.
The President sincerely hopes that
it will not be necessary for the Maine
to sail for Havana, but. recognizing
the possibilities of the situation, he de-
Elres that there shall be no delay in af
fording protection to American inter
The San Francisco Call
ests, and not only the Maine will be
sent, but other vessels will be ordered
to Cuba should circumstances require
It.
As an indication that the administra
tion does not believe that the Cuban
situation will involve the Tnited States
in war. naval officers point to orders
just issued assigning the Nashville to
the European station. Department offi
cials say if there wore any danger of
trouble every available ship would be
retained on the home station. It is also
understood the Nashville will carry to
Europe a draft of long-time men for
the cruiser San Francisco. This shows
the intention of the administration to
retain the San Francisco as the flag
ship of the European squadron. The
Nashville will take the place of the
cruiser Raleigh, now on her way to the
Asiatic station. The Raleigh will ar
rive at Colombo in a few days, and it
is expected that Commodore Dewey will
direct her to report to him at Naga
saki. There ha? boen no move on the
part of the authorities. BO far as can
be learned, to order any vessels home
from foreign stations.
The North Atlantic squadron, which
has been gathering at Hampton Roads,
is to sail southward to-morrow. Lest
there should be a misunderstanding of
the purpose of the cruise, which has al
ready been described In the orders as
one of evolution and drill, planned
many month? ago. the orders under
which the vessels will proceed have
been made public, and. taken in con
nection with the department's order to
Admiral Pieard. the Navy Department
says, sh<>w that the squadron's move
ments have no reference to Cuba.
These orders are made by Admiral
Blcard, and are issued in identical fcrm
to the commanders of the various ships
making 1 up the squadron. They are
dated at Fort Monroe. January 11, on
board the flagship New York, and be
gin as follows:
Sir: The squadron Is to be prepared to

contingent circumstances permitting, with
steam for ten knots, at 10 a. m.. on Sat

NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â The
Times Washington special says:
Hawaiian annexation would be
beaten if a vote were to be taken
at once on the treaty now before
the Senate. This is the opinion
of Senators on both sides. While
the treaty* is under consideration
no Senate r can talk about it for
publication without subjecting
himself to 6evere penalties, so
that It is impossible to induce
any Senator to be quoted about
the situation, but ascertained
facts show plainly that the
treaty cannot be ratified by the
votes of the men who are now
for it.
Several canvasses have been
made to show the probable di
vision of the Senate on the
treaty. Most of these canvasses
seem to have been influenced by
the supporters of the treaty, for
none has been without a doubt
ful list, and a list of doubtful
men inclined to vote for annexa
tion. As a matter of fact, it is
asserted that a correct doubtful
iist wnuid be madft up of i.ames
now carried in the list of those
said to be for the treaty, while
those mentioned in the several
canvasses as doubtful are cer
tain to vote against ratification.
Call Office. Riggrs House,
"Washington, Jan. 14.
The announcement from Honolulu
that President Dole Is coming to Wash
ington did not create any surprise at
the State Department, and It Is evi
dent his trip was expected. "While Mr.
Dole comes in favor of the treaty and
will lend his Influence to that end, it Is
understood here In official circles that
his visit means something more. It is
said he comes clothed with extraordi
nary powers from the Hawaiian Gov
ernment to act for it In accepting any
amendment or change that may be
made in the treaty.
It is understood that the Turpie
amendment now pending, which puts
certain restrictions upon the admission
of Hawaii as a State, will probably be
adopted. If this or any other change
is made In the treaty it will have to be
again ratified by the Hawaiian Gov
ernment.
To prevent this delay, â¢which may
mean a great deal for Hawaii, thfÂ» Gov
ernment at Honolulu has considered it
best to sor.d President Dole to Wash
ington with power to accept any change
c>r amendment he may consider proper
or admissible. It is also understood
hero that no objection Is raised to the
Turpie amendment as long as the is
lands are annexed.
Mr. Lorin A. Thurston, formerly Ha
waiian Minister to the United States
and at present in this city as the island
republic's representative In behalf of
annexation, to-day made the following
statement relative to President Dole's
mission to the United States:
"The Hawaiian Legislature meets In
regular session In February. If annexa
tion is to take place, there will neces
sarily be some legislation to adapt the
laws to the changed conditions. If it is
not to take place the refunding of the
bonded debt will probably be taken up,
which would not be done if annexation
occurs. The present bonds draw r> ppr
cent interest, and can be taken up at
any time. The entire debt can be re
funded at from 4 to 4% per cent by the
present Government. There being no
cable communication, and the mails be
ing so slow and wr> far apart, advices
being at present very unsatisfactory.
President Dole determined to come to
"Washington and observe the condition
for himself in order to guide him In
making recommendations to the Legis
lature."
Friends of the Hawaiian annexation ;
programme are now addressing them- j
selves particularly toward neutralizing
the effect of the allegation that the in
corporation of the Hawaiian Islands
within our tariff limits would be a
blow at the beet-sugar interests. It Is
being urged that the entire sugar pro
duction of Hawaii, which has about
reached its maximum. Is only 200,000
tons, or less than one-tenth of the
quantity of sugar imported into this
country annually. This quantity, it is '
contended, is not sufficient seriously to i
cut into the American beet-sugar in- !
terests. The persona promoting that
particular industry are nt the opinion
that within a very few years the United
States will be raising beets enough for
the entire home consumption of sugar.

Bpec*l Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, Jan. 14
Almost the entire four hours of the
executive session of the Senate to-day
were devoted to the Indirect considera
tion of the nomination of Hon. Joseph
McKenna, now Attorney-General, to be
Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. The discussion was the result
of an effort on the part of Senator
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska to secure a
postponement for two weeks. In the
end a compromise was reached, de
ferring consideration until a week
from to-day, on the condition that the
Nebraska Senator should agree to al
low a vote to k- t;iken on that date.
The Hawaiian treaty was not touched
upon during the session.
The debate upon Mr. MrKenna's
nomination was precipitated by Sena
tor Hoar, chairman of the Committee
on Judiciary, who called up the nom
ination in accordance with his notice
of yesterday and asked for immediate
action. In doing thi^ Hoar spoke brief
ly of the opirfistti.ni to Mr. McKenna,
saying that the Judiciary Committee
had investigated most of the charges
made and had reached tho conclusion
that they were without foundation.
He said that the greater number of
charges had been made for the mem
bers of the American Protective Asso
ciation, and as they had been founded
solely upon the fact that Mr. McKenna
was a Catholic in religion they had not
been deemed worthy of serious consid
eration. Hoar dwelt at Fome length
upon this point, excoriating any man
who would attempt to inject a ques
tion of religion into a controversy
over a man's fitness for office. He said
that such an effort was entirely un-
American and unpatriotic and should
not for a moment receive the consider
ation of fair minded men.
Senator White of <\ilif<>rnia also
spoke of the effort of the A. P. A. to
interfere with the course of the Sen
ate in giving proper attention to a
question the determination of which
should depend upon considerations of
fitness and justice as between man and
man rather than upon an appeal to
bigotry, prejudice and a false claim of
patriotism. He spoke of the A. P. A.'s
as fools, who could not be properly
characterized in the Senate. He had
no patience, he said, with men who
held the opinion that Catholics must
necessarily consult the Pope or some
other high functionary of the Catholic
church in every important transaction
of their lives, and added that he was
convinced that the Senate would not
be influenced for a moment by such
representations as an order of the
character of the A. P. A. would make.
Mr. McKenna's confirmation should
depend entirely upon different consid
erations. As for himself, while he did
not contend that Mr. McKenna was a
giant in his legal attainments, still
he believed him to be an honorable
man, a competent lawyer an( j a j ust
jurist, and he would support his con
firmation.
It was here that Allen Interposed an
abjection to immediate action. When
his request for two weeks' delay was
met with refusal he took the floor and
proceeded to give his reasons for the
request, which were in the main that
he wanted, and be thought the Senate
should have, more time for considera
tion than had been given to it. lie
called attention to the imptrrtance of
the office to which Mr. McKenna had
been named, saying It was a place
which he would occupy probably dur
ing the remainder of his life, and that
the Senate and the American public
had a right to demand that the charges
should be sifted to the bottom. He
said as far as the opposition of the A.
P. A. was concerned, it did not influ
ence him in the least, and he agreed
with all that had been said as to- the
impropriety of any interference in a
matter of this character on account of
the religious prejudices or predilections.
There were still other charges which
were, to his mind, far more serious, and
to prove that such was the case, he
read at length from letters and news
papers attacking Mr. McKenna's record
as an attorney and jurist on the ground
of want of legal attainments.
The greater part of Allen's speech
was devoted to reading those docu
ments. He called special attention to
an attack made by the bar of the Pa
cific Coast which, he said, was deserv
ing of more scrutiny than had been
given it. He also stated that he had
understood that the charge had been
made that large corporations had been
instrumental in securing McKenna's
nomination. He thought this matter
should be looked into more thoroughly
than the Senate had had opportunity
to do. Allen disclaimed any intention
to father any of the charges made, but
asserted that his sole purpose was to
secure time for their proper investiga
tion. He added that he might himself
vote for Mr. McKenna's confirmation,
but said that before doing so he desir
ed to be convinced that the assertions
made derogatory to Mr. McKenna's
character as a jurist were without
foundatio-n.
Senator Perkins followed Senator Al
len. He eulogized the nominee as a
conscientious and upright man. Born
in Philadelphia he removed to Callfor
: n!a at 12 years of age. At the age of
I 22 he was elected District Attorney of
i Solano County, served in the Legisla
! ture of California, was four times elect
ed to the United States Congress;
served on the Ways and Means Com
mittee in that body, and was then ele
| vated to the United States Circuit
; Court bench by President Harrison.
; This was done, notwithstanding the
fact that President Harrison was fa
| vorably inclined toward Judge Spencer
|of San Jose, but the bench and bar of
California Indorsed Mr. McKenna.
Then, after serving ably and honora
bly, the President of the United States,
I William McKinley, selected him as one
of his advisers, and made him Attor
ney-General. He had been intimately
acquainted with him while he served
on the Ways and Means Committee, of
which he was chairman and the latter
had learned to appreciate his worth.
"When McKenna wan appointed,"
said Senator Perkins, "the bench and
bar gave him a banquet fn San Fran
cisco at which many felicitous and con
gratulatory addresses were made. Af
terward he visited Sacramento, the
capital of California, and the Legisla
ture gave him a reception at which the
Governor of the State presided."
Senator Perkins said that the very
first requisite for a jurist was honesty,
and eulogized McKenna's character as
a man, lawyer and judge. He said that
no man was learned in all branches of
the law. Clifford of Maine and Mil
ler of lowa were not better qualified
than McKenna when they were ap
pointed on the Supreme bench, but
were afterward regarded as among the
ablest members of that body. Sena
tor Perkins said that perhaps the dis
tinguished Senator from Nebraska
(Allen) was not versed in all the dif
ferent branches of the science."
The only Senator besides Allen who
manifested any opposition to the con
firmation was Morgan of Alabama, who
Just before the executive session closed
said that while he was in California
recently he had heard McKenna spoken
of among lawyers as a corporation at
torney and unfit for this high judicial
position.
The Senate then, upon request of
Senator Allen, agreed to lay the matter
over one week and to take it up again
for consideration on next Friday.
There is no doubt whatever that the
nomination will be confirmed, and not
more than four or five votes will be
cast against it, in the opinion of Sena
tors White and Perkins.

San Francisco, March 8, 1897.
Mr. W. E. Hale, Warden California State Prison, San Quentin, Cal.â
Dear Sir: lam in receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., advising that
you have reserved 100,000 grain bags for us at 5 cents. We have sent
affidavits into the country to be signed by our customers, and as soon as
we receive them will forward them to you, together with the necessary
deposit. Thanking you, I remain, yours very truly. G. W. McNEAR.
OVER THE LIMIT.
San Francisco, Feb. 19, 1897.
Mr. R. Lichtenberg, San Francisco, Cal.âDear Sir: I beg to ac
knowledge receipt of your favor of even date, with order of Mr.
George McDaniel for 50,000 bags and check for $237 50 to cover deposit
on same. Bill for same showing balance due, please find inclosed. I
have booked this order, although it exceeds the 2,000,000 limit, and have
wired to the Board of Directors, who meet at Folsom to-morrow, for in
structions as to the 100,000 you placed in Los Angeles. The limit being
reached, all orders at 4% cents will be refused hereafter until we hear
from the directors. Tours truly, W. E. HALE, Warden.
It is now determined beyond ques
tion that the grain bag product of the
San Quentin jute mill is largely con
trolled by speculators and middlemen
in violation, of the Ostrom law, and to
the detriment of the small wheat rais
ers of the State. If any doubt were en
tertained as to the intimate relations
subsisting between certain middlemen
and the board, it will be dissipated by
the revelations The Call makes this
morning.
While the board and Warden Hale
have striven to maintain the appear
ance of conformity with the law, it is
plain from the nature of the facts now
brought to light that they disregarded
PRICE FIVE CE^TS.
their duty much more seriously than
was at first supposed.
In the case of Marshall Diggs, the
Woodland middleman, it has been
shown already that he dealt in more
than 150,000 sacks, Detween the pur
chase price of $4 75 and $5 per hun
dred, and the $5 40 rate fixed by the
board before the sacks came into use;
and that, furthermore, he procured 68,
000 bags by telegraph, without affida
vit and without deposit, the day before
the price was raised by the board from
$4 75 to $5.
It would now seem that the Digga
transaction was the lesser one of a
number in which dealers, not actual2
consumers, were privately advised as
to how they might get in on the ground
floor.
Mr. McNear of San Francisco, a very
successful operator in commissions and
margins, had 100,000 sacks set aside for
him without presenting at the time
either affidavit or deposit. In fact, he
did not have an affidavit covering ap
plication for so much as a single sack,
but, like Mr. Dlggs, he agreed to send
out into the country to procure them.
This deal, admittedly made as the re
sult of a private conversation between
Mr. McNear and Warden Hale, left
only 150,000 surplus sacks to be dispos
ed of at the prison clearing house. Evi
dently Mr. McNear, like others, was
keeping a pretty close tab on the San
Quentin stock, and figuring on the rise
to $.') 40 which the board made on
March 20, when they had nothing but
th-- sale of the output to consider.
With Mr. R. Lichtenberg, the Ran
Francisco dealer, similar transactions
in larger quantities are recorded. He
speaks plainly in his communications
of "placing" the San Quentin sacks.
Mr. Lichtenberg deals in big numbersâ
60,000 and 100,000 at a turn. With ref
erence to the sack situation he has a
private consultation with Mr. Ellis.
He is kepi closely posted on the condi
tion of the San Quentin supply, and
insists on having all the "culls" or so
called Imperfect sacks saved for him.
His telegraphic orders are regularly
booked, affidavit and deposit to follow.
The Warden even goes to the length
of settins; 50,000 sa<>ks aside for him in
th<- State warehouse at $4 75 future de
li v.-ry. after the 2.000,000 surplus sacks
covered by the board resolutions had
been disposed of. Notice to this effect
was served on Mr. Lichtenberg Febru
ary 19â the day before the board met
and raised the price to $5.
Mr. Fitzgerald, present chairman of
the Board of State Prison Directors,
and Mr. De Pue, the recently retired
member, visited The Call office last
evening. Both gentlemen asserted that
they were unaware of any violation of
the Ostrom law, and that the affairs of
the Jute mill have been managed to
th^> very best interest of the State.
While mistakes may have been made,
from a business point of view, Mr. De
Pue stated that the board had acted
ever with the object in view of making
the mill successful and self-support
ing; that any intimations of collusion
with middlemen or violation of the law,
to the injury of the farmer, was an out
rage if the truth, and that their trans
actions are preserved in the records,
where any one who chooses may read
them. When his attention was called
to the fact that goods had been sold
in violation of Sec. 3 of the law he ad
mitted having labored under a misun
derstanding as to that clause, and
th' 'light it related merely to jute bags.
Mr. De Pue explained the difficulties
experienced by the board in selling
Facks direct to farmers when the latter
were without the means with which to
make the legal payments, and thought
any business man would approve the
course pursued in disposing of the sur
plus product to replenish the revolv
ing fund.
Both gentlemen were indignant at the
intimation of wrongdoing expressed by
Senator Optrom, and resented It as
wholly undeserve.d and unjust.
CONNIVANCE
WITH THE BIG
MIDDLEMEN.
An Insight Into the Manipu
lation of the Surplus.
* Sack Sale.
It was impossible for the prison di
rectors to favor the manipulators of the '
grain-bag business without leaving a
few kangaroo tracks in the sand. In
an investigation of the letter records
of San Quentin enough proof may be '
obtained to substantiate the charges |
made by The Call that the Ostrom law
â¢was juggled desperately in the. interest i
of middlemen purchasers and specu
lators.
Take for example the brief corre
spondence between Warden Hale and
G. W. McNear of San Francisco, which
establishes the fact that 100,000 sacks
were reserved at 15 per hundred, as the j

SENATOR DOTY
TALKS TO THE
PRISON BOARD.
He Says They Are Violat
ing the Ostrom Law and
Defeating Its Ends.
ELK GROVE, Jan. 14.â The stand
taken by The Call on the side of the
farmers of the State and against the
manipulation carried on by the Prison
Board has become a subject of general
discussion throughout Sacramento
County. Senator Gillls Doty, who is
recognized as the most dauntless cham
pion the farmefs of California have
ever had in the State Legislature, in
speaking of the expose made by The
Call, said to The Call correspondent
to-day:
"In general with the farmers of the
State I have always felt that the true
purposes and design of the Ostrom bill
have been defeated. The only motive
which lay at the bottom of that act of
1893 consisted in a desire to benefit the
farmers of the State and thereby, in a
measure, atone for the employment of
convict labor in the manufacture of
grain bags. But wherein have the
farmers profited from It?
"If the recent publications of The
rail be true, I am sure Instead of there
being a profit or advantage to the
farmers, there has been a distinct loss
inflicted on them, besides a very serious
disadvantage. I have not given the
matter much thought since Robert T.
Devlin, the Prison Director, ran for Su
perior Judge in this county some few
years ago. I remember then that his
record on the Jute bag proposition was
very thoroughly discussed among the
farmers, and, if their vote on his can
didacy Is any Indication, I am sure the
Sacramento farmers were very emphat
ic in condemning the course of the
Prison Board.
"The purpose of the Ostrom law was
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUABY 15, 1898.
to restrict speculation in one of the
principal commodities used by the
farmer. The low price of his grain,
coupled with his very small margin for
profit, led the Legislature to believe
that as long as the convicts had to do
something it would be well to effect
their employment by directly benefiting
the farmer.
"Now. when by one means and an
other, the directors ran the price up to
the point it reached last year, they are
certainly violating the law and defeat
ing the purpose of the measure. I sup
pose when their side is heard they will
be able to prove that they were acting
in accord with strict commercial prac
tices; but while that may be true they
made profit at the expense of the farm
er, and the Legislature never intended
that they should manufacture bags for
the purpose of speculation. They should
never have permitted such a surplus
of stock to have accumulated.
"If their price governs the market I
do not see why they found it necessary
to unload thousands upon thousands of
sacks at a price very much lower than
the farmer was compelled to pay later
on, when it became necessary for him
to buy. I do not know where this
518,000 profit which The Tall speaks of
went, but you may depend upon it no
small grain producer in the State of
California received a cent of it.
"Now I suppose the claim will be
made that the cost of production in
San Quentin necessitates this high
price charged by the board. My rem
edy for this would be to establish the
jute plant at Folsom, where they have
power to throw away, and where they
could manufacture jute bags at a
greatly reduced rate. In that event
even I presume some way would be
found to benefit these whom the law
never intended to benefit.
"As to the practice spoken of in The
Call on the part of merchants who ob
tain control of a large stock of grain
baps through affidavits made by in
different, ignorant or unscrupulous
men, I am proud to say that I have
never heard of such a violation of the
law in my locality. At the same time
I know that the fueling of the farmers
in this section is wry strong against
the practices of the Prison Hoard, and
while before The Call's expose we had
no authentic information on the man
ipulations carried on we have all felt
that something was radically wrong,
and we sincerely hope that The Call
may bring the relief the people desire.
"I am not speaking from any peraon
al experience, and ran only say per
sonally that. If the affair should come
up for solution at the next session of
the Legislature, I shall take hold of it
as I do of all other matters, and try to
protect the farmers of the State from
any further disadvantage by so
amending the law as to remove temp
tation and opportunity from those who
have failed to carry out the spirit and
intent of the act as it now stands."
MR. WILKINS
DEFENDS THE
PRISON BOARD.
He Disclaims Any Knowl
edge of the Operations
of Middlemen.
RAX RAFAEL, Jan. 14â James H.
Wilkins. one of the members <>f the
Board of State Prison Director*, was
seen to-day in regard to the jute bag
trouble. Said he:
"I took my office as a member of the
board in April. 1^96, and at that time
we had a large supply of bags on hand,
but though the season was advancing
we were getting no orders for them.
We sent out circulars and posters
broadcast, but they failed to have the
slightest effect. We thÂ»-n reaorted to
an expedient never before attempted.
Four drummers were sent throughout
the State, one in the Northern Sacra
mento Valley, one about Stockton, one
about Tulare and Bakersfield ond one
In the Salinas and Santa Clara Val
leys.
"They sold, all told, as nearly as I
can say about 1,000,000 bags, and I
think it is safe to say that they inter
viewed one-half to two-thirds of the
farmers who raised wheat in commer
cial quantities in the State of Califor
nia. Many of the farmers could not
take the bags, as they were unable to
raise the necessary 10 per cent cash
payment, and in a number of Instances
the middlemen came to their rescue by
putting up the amount.
"Well, we reached the end of the fis
cal year 1896, barely managing to get
through and keep things on a level
keel. We couldn't sell the bags. All
the working capital was tied up in the
bags â about HSO.OOO.
"It took about $6000 a month to run
the jute mill, and this sum must be
realized from sales of sacks, for the
general appropriation was only suffi
cient to pay the salaries and subsist
ence charges. The appropriation for
that year was $147,000, but we could
only draw one-twelfth of that amount
a month, or a little over J12.000, which
barely paid the salaries and the sub
sistence charges. We had no money
for the running of the Jute mill, and
the Board of Examiners allowed us to
overdraw the one-twenty-fourth act,
we overdrawing a little over $5000 a
month for several months in the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1897.
"Shortly after we relieved the situ
ation, securing orders to manufacture
1,600,000 sugar bags and received cash
for them. This eased up the state of
affairs existing, yet we were away
short on the one-twenty-fourth act.
However, we had relieved the embar
rassing situation. Otherwise the mill
must have closed shortly after the fis
cal year began.
"On the close of the 1896 calendar
year we almopt determined to close
down the Jute mill, for the sugar bag
business was exhausted and we
couldn't see our way clear Co make
both ends meet, yet we determined to
run along In the hopes that something
would turn up, and it did. In January,
1897, the boom began, and it purely
arose over the scare among the farm
ers about the McKinley bill. A com
mittee had formulated a tariff bill and
the tariff on bags was run up to 2%
cents, and this meant that the price of
bags would reach at least 6 cents.
There was a rush to get the San Quen
tin bags, as there were no Calcutta
bags on the market at all.
"Inquiries for our bags came in thick
and fast and we fixed the price at $4 75.
Of course we were anxious to straight
en out our affairs, and we desired to
put the jute mill again on a business
basis.
"We directed the sale of a milii.
bags, as we had the right to do, a:
regarded the sale aa a perfect godsen
relieving us, as it did, from a mÂ«.
embarrassing position.

would know the men applying for the

about supplying them. We are not

services of a detective bureau larger
than any on earth.
"I would not have sanctioned the sale
Of bags in large quantities had it not
been necessary for us to relieve the
pressing situation. Our affairs were
in a terrible condition, and in common
with other directors I was very unwill
ing to go before the public with a rec
ord of a heavy deficiency, which most
people woulJ have ascribed to incom
petency or worse. But the sale of the
bags carried us over handsomely, and
I think any business man would have
done the same under like conditions.
"I didn't understand that the mid
dlemen were buying the sacks. I
haven't seen an affidavit that didn't
comply with the law. There may have
been cases of rien in mercantile pur
suits applying for sacks, but as we
knew that they used them for farms of
their own \vÂ» supplied their demands.
"I- believ-' that now the situation is
relieved and the affairs of the jute mill
are on a satisfactory basis, that the
Oatrom it t wfll be complied with in
the strictest sense of the law.
"The orders for sacks for this year's
crop will Roon come in; at the next
meeting orders will be received, I be
lieve, and we will supply them. If
ever the law has been violated except
by persons presenting false affidavits
I do not know of it personally."

A Good Medicine
This is the verdict of the people in
regard to Hood's Sarsaparilla. Wher-
ever it is given a fair trial it demon-
strates its absolute intrinsic merit.
It makes friends easy because it
makes people well.
Â»
As its sales are rapidly Increasing,
its volume of praise grows greater day
by day. It is now generally recog-
nized as America's Greatest Medicine.
Its use is prescribed by physicians,
druggists, and even the great influen-
tial newspapers advise correspondents
suffering from impure blood to "take
Hood's Sarsaparilla."
It has cured the worst cases of scrof-
ula, ealt rheum, sores, ulcers, boils,
etc., simply and solely because it
thoroughly purifies the blood.
It cures catarrh and the pains and
aches of rheumatism, neuralgia, mala-
ria, because it neutralizes acidity, ex-
Hood's Sarsaparilla
chased earlier in the season he could
have done much better.
Mr. Manor argues that the prison di
rectors forced the prison bags on the
market early in the season, and later
raised the price to a p<Â»fhi above that
asked for Calcutta bags.
PETALUMA, Jan. 14.â Owing to the
fa< t that Petaluma and vicinity abound
principally in poultry and dairy farms
the farmers are not greatly inconven
ienced in the purchase of their grain
sacks. The fact of the requirements
of the Board of Directors at San Quen
tin of payment in advance and the
usual red tape deters the mills or small
farmers from patronizing prison-made
sacks.
It is estimated that not more than
20,000 sacks are purchased here in a
year, the farmers using their old bags
as long as possible. The Golden Eagle
Mining Company state that they have
never handled any of the San Quentin
bags. In the first place the law pro
hibits any but actual consumers pur
chasing bags from the prison, and sec
ondly, firms here have been able so far
to purchase the Calcutta bags with less
difficulty and sell them in this market
as low as llwc of San Quentin make
were quoted.
The difference in quality la but little,
and as long as Calcuttas answer the
farmers' purpose they will not pay
more for the San Quentin convict-made
sacks; especially as in several notable
instances they have had cause to com
plain of unfair treatment, where they
should only have received the fair deal
ing they expected.
HOLLTSTEU. Jan. 14.â San Quentin
sacks are used exclusively in this coun
ty. The large farmers deal direct with
the prison. The small farmers are fur
nished the sacks at the prison price,
. phis cost of freight. The farmers here
! have no complaint concerning middle
' men, but naturally suffer from the flue
! tuation in prices of the San Quentin
i product.
VISALIA. Jan. 14.â The publications
in The Call regarding the jobbery in
grain sacks have elicited much interest
here, both among dealers and farmers.
It seems to be the prevailing opinion
that the grain sack business of the
State has not greatly redounded to the
benefit of the average farmer.
A good many San Quentin grain bags
have been purchased in Tulare County
by the wheat growers, but far more of
the Calcutta product have found their
way to this part of the valley. There
are reasons for this, one is that the
San Quentin bags have been slightly
smaller than the others. Again, the law
required that 10 per cent of the price of
the bags accompany the order, and
many of the smaller wheat growers es
pels the germs of disease, and gives the
blood vitality and strength.
It relieves dyspepsia, indigestion, bil-
iousness, torpid liver and kidneys, by
virtue of its qualities as a true stom-
ach tonic, appetizer and aid to diges-
tion.
It cures nervousness, nervous dyspep-
sia, that tired feeling, weariness of
mind and body, because it feeds the
; nerves, muscles and tissues upon pure
j blood, and thus gives them the tone
and strength they imperatively need.
It prevents fevers, the grip, colds,
â  etc., because It fortifies and strengthens
I the system to resist these attacks and
i the unfavorable effects of changeable.
damp, stormy weather.
This is simply what Hood's Sarsa-
parilla has done for others, and what,
if you are in need, it will do for you. In
your necessity give Hood's Sarsaparilla
the opportunity to do you good. Fairly
tried, you will find it a faithful friend.

pecially have been unable to have that
amount on hand at the time they need
ed the bags. Hence it has been the rule
for the farmers here to depend on a few
of thÂ« largest dealers in grain bags for
what they wanted in that line, knowing
that the dealers would advance the
sacks until the grain was sold.
I have been assured that not more
than one out of ten farmers in this part
of the county makes it a custom to or
der grain bags from San Quentin.
It has been whispered that a large lot
of grain bags was secured last summer
from the San Quentln mills by a few
dealers who expected to do an immense
business in that line on account of the
nattering prospects for wheat. How
they obtained the sacks is not exactly
known. It is said that a good many
bales are being carried over.
Prices of sacks have varied here from
as low as 5 cents to as high as 8 or 9
c^nts In the past four years. Most
farmers agree that either the law or
the management of the State product
has not been entirely satisfactory.
SONOMA, Jan. 14.â Some of the grain
farmers here purchase their supply of
sacks from San Francisco commission
merchants, while others place their or
ders with the home merchants. Owing
to the relatively small amount of
wheat raised there is no business house
which keeps sacks on hand or makes a
specialty of them. The price paid by
the farmer fo-r the prison-made sack,
which is supposed to be 1 cent above
cost, is the same as they pay for the
imported Calcutta sack. No orders are
sent direct to San Quentin Prison, as
it was intended they should be when
the Ostrom law was passed in 1893, and
it appears as though the wholesaler is
reaping the benefit instead of the farm
er. The business men of Sonoma said
t>>-day that the sack business did no-t
justify them bothering with it. F. T.
Duhring, the largest dealer here, hand
led but 2000 sacks last year.
Mr. Joseph Tate, who is connected
with his father, Mr. F. Tate, on one of
the largest ranches in this valley, when
speaking about the purchase of sacks,
said that there was no difference in the
prioe of prison sacks and those im
ported from Calcutta, Last year they
purchased their supply in San Francis
co, and the price for the two makes
was the same.
By the passage of the Ostrom law it
was intended to protect the farmer
against the high price of the imported
Calcutta goods, and also give the pris
oner a chance to earn his living, but
when goods, upon which there is a tar
iff, and in the manufacture of which
labor has to be paid, is offered for sale
at the same price as the prison-made
article, where the labor is not paid, it
is evident that the laws are not carried
"My little boy was taken with in-
flammatory rheumatism when he was 2
years old. He was in a serious condi-
tion. We did not know what it was for

MARYSVILLE. Jan. 14. âTo the
charge of harboring unscrupulous mid
dlemen or bankers who are in league
with the directors of the San Quentin
Prison in the violation of the Ostrom
act, Marysville is one city that can
plead not guilty. This for the reason
that the dealers here have nfver taken
kindly to nor admired the red tape fea
tures of the purchase or jute bags fror.r
the prison. They are modest in iheir
confession that they never have yield
ed to the temptation to make false af
fidavit "that the amount of goods in
the order were for individual and per
sonal use of the applicant."
Instead they have been and are now
handling the Calcutta sacks, supply
ing for the most part the farmers of
Yuba and Sutter counties, whom they
carry on their books from year to
year. One of these merchants said to
your correspondent that he knows of
scarcely any San Quentin bags having
been used by the ranchers hereabouts
last season. When the San' Quentin
bag war? from an eighth to a quarter
cheaper than the Calcutta article a
few of the farmers found themselves
financially able to purchase the prison
bags. But as the prison directors re
quire cash down for the goods few
farmers in this section neve been in
position to deal with them in three sea
sons past. Hence the sway of the Cal
cutta bag. which is this season quoted
lower than the San Quentin article.
NAPA, Jan. 14.â During the year 1897
very few prison made sacks were pur
chased by our farmers, though in 1894
95-96 the quantity was quite large. A.
Hatt, one of the largest grain men
here, says:
"Tho reason that last season Calcut
ta Packs were almost exclusively
bought in this county was that they
were cheaper than those made at the
prison. I think, too, that they were
better and stronger, for the prison
sacks brought here the year before
were miserable quality, breaking
often in the seams.
"The Ostrom law was' supposed to
have been enacted in the Interest of
the farmers, to enable them to get at
a minimum cost bags made at an In
stitution which they help to keep up,
but the good obtained from It amounts
to near nothing. At least such would
seem the case when farmers cannot
afford the extortionate prices at the
prison and must buy for a trifle less,
but still high, of a private corporation.
"I don't charge the Prison Directors
with corruption. I know nothing of the
allegations, and have given the matter
no attention, but I do know It does not
appear that the jute department of San
Quentin Prison is run much in the in
terest of the farmers of California.
The prices of Calcutta are high yet
they are lower than San Quentin. Why
Is it?"
F. E. Johnston, one of Napa's most
prominent attorneys and owner of one
of the largest farms in the county,
thinks much as does Mr. Hatt. Since
the passage of the Ostrom law in 1893
Mr. Johnston has purchased only one
season's sacks at the prison. That was
In 1894, when he paid 5V4 cents for five
thousand sacks. The following year
he bought none, but in 1896 preferred
Calcuttas. Also in 1897. In 1896 a
thousand Calcuttas cost him 4 1-5
and in 1897 two thousand 5 cents each.
This was better than he could do at
San Quentin. The Call's profrfng of
this matter is attracting much atten
tion in Napa.

MYSTERY OF THE
RIVERSIDE MURDER
FINALLY CLEARED
The Victim W. F. Shrode of Elsi
nore, Who Was Probably
Slain for the Cash He
Carried.
RIVERSIDE JÂ«UL 14 w nroflf ' is the name of the man who was
found dead near thia â  Ity on December B last. All these weeks the ques
tion of Identity remained unsolved until to-day the wife of the mur
dered man came to the city from Blsinore, where the family owns a
ranch, and, as soon as she was shown the picture of the dead man, she
said it was that of her husband.
Mrs. Shrode pays that her husband left on December 3, while in a
fit of ancrr, with the Intention of not returning. He intended to po to
Los Angeles on foot, and the dead man was found ripht on the road he
would most likely have traveled in polng there. When he left he took
$â¢â 'oo but no money waa found on his body, showing that robbery was
added to the crime of murder by those who took the life of Shrode. In
describing her missing husband, Mrs. Shrode mentioned all the marks
and scars found on the d^ad man's body.
There can 1"' no mistake .about the identity. Thf> theory of the officers
in regard to the murder is that Bhrode was followed from home by
some one who knew he had money, and who killed him for it. Shrode
was well known In the country and the wonder is that he was not iden
tified when the body was first found, for thousands viewed the corpse.
BACON WROTE
"DON QUIXOTE"
That Is the Latest Dis
covery of Ignatius
Donnelly.
Says It Has Taken Him Ten
Years to Find It
Out.
Along With Some Things Going to
Confirm His Shakespearean
Cryptogram Theory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 14.â Ignatius
P'.nnelly is at work upon a new Ba
conian cryptogram which he expects
to place in the hands of his publishers
in a few weeks. He will take even
wider grounds than he did in his lirst
book. He says he has discovered a
new rule governing ciphers and will
assert that Bacon not only wrote the
plays and sonnets of Shakespeare but
that he was possibly responsible for
"Don Quixote." For this he expects
another castigatlon at the hands of
critics.
Mr. Donnelly gave to-day the first
authentic outline of what the book
will be. He said: "I can scarcely ex
pect the public will accept unquali
fiedly my statements as to what 1 ex
pect the book will establish. I think
everything which is Bet forth in my
first book, the "Great Cryptogram,"
was true, but in an incomplete form.
"I had found the cipher numbers up
on which the inner story of the Shak--
Bpearean plays were based, and I had
worked out in an imperfect v.
good deal of the narrative, l had not
discovered th>- rule on which the nar
rative proceeds, so that, rinding one
word of the story, 1 could tell just
where to look for the next. All my
spare time for ten years has been de
voted to the elaboration of the new
rule, and I now have no doubt my
book will establish the truth that the
cipher Btory really exists in Shake
speare's plays, and that they are held
together by a rule as inflexible and
s(if-apparent as the multiplication
table.
"But the new book will go beyond
this in some respects. There was orig
inally over Shakespeare's grave a stone
containing this Inscription:
â¢ lonil friend. Cor Jesus' sake forbear
T'i dig the dust enclosed here.
Blest be the man who spares these stones
And curst be he who moves my bones.
"This was given in what the biog
raphers of an â¬-arly period called a
Ftrange mixture of large and small let
ters distributed without rhyme or
reason. Francis Bacon, In one Of his
philosophical works, "De Augn:eiitis,"
set forth what he called a 'bi-i;
or two letter cipher, whereby anything
could be expressed by two different
kinds of alphabets of different sixes.
I will show that the odd Inscription on
Shakespeare's gravestone, when the
Bacon bl-literal cipher is applied,
works out by regular and consecutive
rule these words: "Francis Bacon
wrote the Green, Marlowe and Shake
speare plays.'
"The book will then proceed to prove,
not by arithmetical rule, but by strik
ing evidences and illustrations, that
there is a cipher of the events of the
times in which the plays were written.
They describe the religion of th" per
iod, the establishment of the lust
newspaper, the discoveries of <lalileo
and other striking and remarkable
matters. The name of Francis Bacon,
the words, 'Francis Bacon,' and 'Ba
con' occur repeatedly in Jonson's
plays, and the name of Ben Jonson
Itself is found in the text of these
plays.
"There are, startling and incredible
as it may seem, allusions t<> tho treat
Spanish work, 'Don Quixote,' the au
tli'-r of which died in the same year as
Shakespeare. These create a suspi
cion that this book, too, was from the
brain of the same Ã¼biquitous and uni
versal genius, Francis Baron."

lightning flashed. Winters called for help,
but before she could be taken home she
had expired. A physician said the woman
had come to her death by the breaking
of a blood vessel of the heart, caused by
extreme excitement. Mrs. Winters was

Counterfeiter Taken by
Officers Near
Auburn.
Had an Outfit Remarkably
Complete in Every
Detail.
Product of His Mint Hard to Distin

Sum's Coin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Jan. 14.â One of the most
important captures in the history of
counterfeiters of United States coin
was made near Auburn last night.
About six weeks ago Detective Henry
Alter of Sacramento ascertained that a
certain person was having portions of
a steel press and plates made at the
Union Iron Works in Sacramento. Al
ter concluded that the fellow was pre
paring to set up a counterfeiting plant.
He notified United States Secret Agent
Harris and began shadowing the man.
The officers finally located him in Pla
cer County, and, aided by information
received by Harris from Sheriff Conroy
about a year ago, came to Auburn and
found him here. He was J. \Y. Rich
ardson, and was captured in a cabin
about two miles from town.
<>n rearing the cabin the officers
could hear the press running, and, ac
cording to th<'ir count, dollars were b-
ing manufactured at the rate of one a
minute. The man tried to br<-ak away,
but the officers were too much for him.
In his cabin besides the counterfeiting
outfit were found a breech-loading
shotgun and a quantity of loaded
Bhells, arid it is believed the fellow
would havÂ»' shown li^ht had he been
given th*- opportunity.
The outfit captured is described by
Aer*nt Harris and Detective Alter as
the mi's* complete they have ever seen.
No <o.,imon plaster of parts molds
were used, but in their stead were ele
gantly engraved steel dies. The press
used was a work of genius, the lever
containing seventeen threads to thr
inch. It is estimated that one man with
little effort could command a pressure
of 100 tons. The di.-s are perfect and
i the coins could not be detected from
the real, as they are made from pure
silver.
When captured the counterfeiter re
marked to the officers that he had
never passed any <>f the spurious coins,
but if let alone for â  few days he would
have greatly benefited the people of
Auburn by placing more mcofy in cir
culation. He is about 60 years of age.
of polite demeanor and has worked
around* Auburn for several years at
carpentering and mining.

VICTORIA. Jan. 14.â Collector Milne
has been advised of trouble near Lake
Bennett, caused by the action of cer
tain United Statt-s citizens in raising
the Bag of (heir country over what
has hitherto bei D regarded as Cana
dian territory. The news conies in a
letter from William Murray to George
F. Stelly of this city, in which he says:
"Word has just reached here from
Lake Bennett that Inited States Com
missioner Smith at Skaguay, acting for
both Skaguay and Dyea, claims three
miles down from the head of Lake
Bennett, taking in McLeods police sta
tion and my lot. The Commissioner has
ordered all locations made on this
land to be recorded with him. A party
of Americana just below the police sta
tion, where tlv Union Jack is tl.-ating,
recently hoisted t'ae Stars and Stripes.
The police Immediately went down and
demanded an explanation, and after
some parleying the American flag was
low. red and an apology tendered.
"There will ultimately be serious
trouble, the boundary dispute being
made an excuse by the lawless element
to Jump th<j land. For that reason I
am anxious to t my cabin up and oc
cupled, and 1 1 â¢ â¢ - 1 1 we will hold the fort.
Twenty or thirty men tried to jump a

Moore armed a j arty of men, and after
the free use of guns drove the jumpers

time the raid v . ;is attempted it sound

"Other men .Canadians) here are
having trouble with the United States
customs. One party has decided that
it is bfrter to t i â  the inspector at $6
a day than to paj duty."
The contents of Mr. Murray's letter
caused no little ronmtirt In official cir
cles here, and it was decided to take
immediate action. Commissioner Rant

RELIEF EXPEDITION IS
TEMPORARILY ABANDONED.
Departure Postponed Owing to Reports Tha
Dawson Is in No Danger of
Famine.
PORTLAND. Jan. 14.â General Her
riam. commanding the Department of the
Columbia, this morning received a tele
pram from the War Department Instruct
ing him to postpone the departure of the
relief expedition to Alaska. Accordingly
the contract to ship the expedition from
this port on the steamship Oregon Janu
ary 23 has been withdrawn. The pack
train Is still held at Fort Vancouver, and
the drilling of the guard tor it will go on.
The orders effect a temporary abandon
ment of the expedition and it is under
stood they were based on the recent re
ports that there will be no starvation or
suffering in the Yukon country that the
Government relief expedition could re
lieve. Agent Poston of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company states that his com
i.any is glad to be relieved of the con
tract to transport the Government pack
train to Alaska, as It has already more
business offered than it is possible to
handle.
The report of Major L. H. Ruckor
Fourth Cavalry, who was sent to Dyea
by the department to ascertain the con
dition of affairs in the Yukon, was re
ceived by General Merriam to-day. From
his Interviews with those who have come
out from Dawson recently, and from his
observations of the Chilkoot and White
passes. Major Rucker concludes:
Firstâ That While there is a shortage of
â tore* in the Yukon basin, a state of famine
does not nt present exist, nor is it likely to
exist in the immediate future.
Secondâ That a large expedition with quan
tities of supplies hauled on sledges by horses
or reindeer could Dot proceed down the Yukon
further than the foot of Lake La Barge, 400
mlliis from DaWMML
Thirdâ That reindeer on such an expedition
are no more service-able than mules or
horses.
Fourthâ If Government assistance Is,
conspicuously needed in the Yukon it will be
when the stores now in the hands of the peo
ple are. exhausted, which is not llkolv. from nil
he can learn, to be earlier than April or May.
Ho. therefore, recommend* that if the
Snow Locomotive Company, wh<"h has
a < "ntraet with the Government, does not
convey the relief Into the Yukon during
February. <"â¢" Government park trains,
with Bledjges, anoula carry thorn across
f'hilkoot paaa and down the l:ik.s and
rivers to the foot of Lake I_a 8.-iri?'- dur
ing the month of March, ami then- await
Hi.' breaking up of the ice in the Yukon
The supplies could then be taken to Daw
sun In boats.
Tho Chicago Snow and Ice Transporta
tion Company, which has a contract with
the Government to haul the relief expe
dition BUPpUea from Dyeu to Daw>on,
notified General Mernaaa to-day th;it It
would be unable to start its snow train
Into the interior earlier than the middle
Âi February- The contract which the
ompany has with the Government allows
that length of time in which to start the
expedition. General aferrlam has there
fore extended the time of starting the ex
pedition some time in February.

GENERAL CLAY'S
WIFE DRIVEN
OUT OF DOORS
With Other Members of the
Household, Dora Flees From
a Brother's Wrath.
NEW YORK. Jan. 14.â A Herald special from Valley View, Ky.,
says: Clell Richardson to-day drove his sister, Mrs. l>ora Clay, away
from his house, where she had been staying ever since she left her
husband. General Cassius M. Clay, In November. There has been trou
ble in the Richardson family because Clell allowed his brother-in-law,
William Bryant, to remain at his house while Dora was there. Several
weeks ago William Richardson tried to kill Clell, and shot at him five
times. Saturday John Richardson tried to kill Bryant with a scantling.
Clell has always defended Bryant from the charges of his brothers that
he had been talking about Dora, but several days ago Clell became ill
and has been confined to his house ever since. During this time he
has watched Dora and his brother-in-law, and to-day he took Dora to
task for allowing Bryant to show her so much attention. His mother
in-law, Mrs. John Bryant, was present. She took the part of Dora and
her son and a three-cornered family quarrel ensued. It resulted in
Clell driving them from the house. After Mrs. Clay and Mrs. Bryant

TWO RAILWAYS
TO THE YUKON
Rival Companies Will
Race in the Building
of Lines.
Projects Involving the Expen
diture of Sixteen Million
Dollars.
Eucrt Road to Run From Pyramid
Harbor to Points on Lewis
River.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Jan. 14.â A railroad build
ing race involving the expenditure of
$16,000,000 has been commenced by two
wealthy corporations, each of which de
sires to own the first railroad into the
Yukon country. Each road -will be
about 400 miles long, running from
Pyramid Harbor, near the head of
Lynn Canal, to points on Lewis River,
below Five Finger Rapids.
The companies back of the railroad
pmjccts are the London Exploration
Company, which means the Roths
childs, and the Yukon Company, organ
ized last summer by Andrew F. Bur
leigh, the principal stockholders of
which are Philadelphia and New York
men. Both corporations have engineers
and surveyors at work between Pyra
mid Harbor and the Lewis River.
Their efforts at present are confined
chiefly to- the first sixty miles, which
will take the roads over the summit of
ChilkOOt Pass and down into tt* valley
beyond. This will be the most expen
-iv. part <>f the road to build, costing
from $25,iXK> to $40,000 a mile. The pro
jectors of both n/ads figure on an aver
age cost of over $20,000 a mile, requir
ing an outlay of over $5,000,000 for each
road. The equipment for each will cost
about $1,000,000 more.
Both companies are actively prepar
ing to send forward materials, and at
the same time working to secure the
sanction of Congress to their building
through American territory. Rights of
way from Canada have been obtained.
General Manager Dickinson of the Yu
kon Company said to-day:
"Yes; there is room on the Dalton
trail for two railways, and I believe
they will both be built. Mr. Bratnober
and the London Exploration Company
undoubtedly mean business, and I am
sure we do. I believe there will be two
towns on Pyramid Hnrbor. The Chil
koot Pass is very suitable for a rail
road, the ascent being gradual instead
of short and Fteep, as on other passes.
W" shall strike the Lewis River below
Five Finger Rapids, thus getting be
low all impediments to navigation. We
have twelve river steamers and a large
number of barges building. After the
road is finished these steamers will be
operated between Its river terminus
and points down the river, including
Dawaon and Circle- city.
"The development of Alaska has com
menced, and will progress from
now on on a large scale. The placer
gold production will be enormous for
five years or more, until the quartz
mines begin producing. Then they will
leave the placers far behind in produc
tion. I have no doubt that the mother
lode of the Klondike has been discov
ered. Its location was pretty well es
tablished by Surveyor Ogilvie of the
Dominion Government, and later evi
dence confirms the reports made to and
by him. Development of quartz mines
will determine where the permanent
supply centers will be on the Yukon
River, and after that, I have no doubt,
railroad! will be extended into the
heart of the country."
The building of roads will require all
of this year. By the summer of 1599
Manager Dickinson expects to carry
passengers from Sound cities to Daw
son In five days.

the Party.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, Jan. 14.â 1t is now a mat
ter of general belief in Genoa that the
coils of evidence are tightening about
those engaged in the lynching of Ãber.
Witnesses were being examined all
day, but owing to the rule adopted by
the jury no witness nor juryman is al
lowed to talk of the proceedings in the
jury room. It is impossible, however,
to prevent some knowledge of what is
going on getting out.
Henry Johnson, the first witness
called to-day, testified to having been
asked by a man to help hang Ãber, and
he gave the man's name. Alexander
Miller was approached by two men and
when he refused he was roundly cursed
for declining to join the party.
Mr. Blackweil, a ranch foreman, tes
tified to having been approached by the
same men.
S. P. Swartz identified a scarfpin and
a cuff-button picked up the morning
after the lynching near the tree where
Ãber swung.
Mrs. Peter Anderson, the sister-in
law of the man killed by Ãber, has
been subpenaed and will be asked If
she made the masks used by the lynch
ers.
It was said yesterday that Mason
Crummish, a blacksmith of Gardner
ville, would turn State's evidence, but
ho was called before the jury and, it Is
said, refused to testify.
The impression is that the jury will
indict several persons, as It is making
an exhaustive investigation and leav
ing nothing undone to bring out the
truth. To-day subpenas were issued
for two witnesses who are supposed
to be the most important of all, but
they will not be examined before next
week. Most of the jurors are farmers
and they have adjourned to meet next
Monday at 10 o'clock.
It was supposed. that the relatives of
Ãber in the East would sue Douglas
County, but his sister writes to Alf
Chartz, the attorney for Ãber, that she
does not want money for his death,
but says that his relatives, who are
very religious people, forgive all of the
lynehers and leave them to the Al
mighty.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 15.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily Chronicle, In a
startling Statement this morning, quotes
largely from an article in Civilta Catollca,
which he declares is directly inspired by
the Vatican and the Pope, advocating, as
to the solution of the etrrnal questions
between the Vatican and th.> (julrinal,
the establishment an Italian republic.
The article, which is based on the
Pope's Christmas allocution, declares that
the thing which stands opposed to Papal
independence is not Italian unity, but
"the special and contrite form in which
[ that unity is maintained, with results
j much more disastrous to the state than
! to the Holy See."
. It proceeds to assert that the coexist
ence of the Vatican and the Italian mon
archy is impossible, and that one or the
other must go. It then suggests the
constitutions of Switzerland and America
as an example of "admirable and glori
ous constitutions; true union of nation
and state, differing from that of Italy,
which has produced nothing but weak
ness, misery and starvation."
The article concludes: "Without the aid
of foreign bayonets, the true Italy will
i find for itself its own way and will rise
j again, iet us hope, from the ignominy in
I which it now lies prostrate to true great
ness."
The Daily Chronicle's correspondent as
serts that this is "an intentional revela
tion to the outer world of the policy ac
tuating the inner mind of Cardinal Ram
polla (Papal secretary of state). He
adds:
"Probably there would no truth in the
supposition that either Cardinal Rampolla
or the Pope has any idea of even a tem
porary alliance with the republican party,
but yet they believe, while peace with
the King is impossible, it might be possi
ble with a repuhlie. The reason for the
appearance of this astounding pronounce
ment at the present moment is the belief
trfat not only the ministry but tho dynas
ty itself is menaced more seriously than
usual."

Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 14.
It was the intention of the House
managers to proceed with the diplo
matic and consular appropriation bill
to-day, hut owing to the excited con
dition (>f affairs in Havana and the
wildly exaggerated reports afloat they
decided to avoid the possibility of open
ing up a Cuban debate by relinquish
ing the day to the Committee on Claims
in charge of bills on the private calen
dar. Before this order was entered
upon, the agriculture bill was passed.
Most of the day was consumed in a
filibuster against a bill to pay the pub
lishing house of the Methodist E]
pal Church. South, at Nashville, Term.,
1238,000 on account of Beixure and use
of the property of that corporation dur
ing the war. This took up the time
until 5 o'clock when the House ad
journed.
Until the House adjourned last night
the amendment to the agricultural ap
propriation bill, providing for the pub
lication of another edition of the
"Horse Book." was pending. To-day
the frit nds of the amendment compro
mised with the Appropriations Cum

75,000. A- . . â¢ Lmendment
was adopted and the bill was passed.

Cannon, chairman of th-- Appropria
- ;id that he thought
the exposition question in Congress was
running wild. We had domestic ex
positions at Philadelphia, Chicago, Cin
cinnati. New Orleans, Atlanta and
Nashville, and we were now about to
have one at < .-maha. Abroad we had
participated in the expositions at Vi
enna, Paris. Berlin and Brussels. The
anxiety ..f would-be commissioners to
have the honor and glory of our coun
try represented at these fureign expo
sitions was agonizing. Now, here came
this exposition at Bergen. Twenty
thousand dollar? to he appropriated
now. If this resolution passed Congress
would be called on to foot th-- bill for
a deficiency of $20,000. He gave it as
his deliberate judgment that the inter
â ' the United States did not re
quire our participation in this exposi
tion. If we did our duty by the Paris
Exposition that would be enough.
The resolution was adopted.
Another resolution was adopted on
motion of Perkins (It.) of lowa, direct
ing the director of the Geological Survey
to prepare and have printed 40,000 cop
ies of a map of Alaska, showing the
m<rst feasible routes to the gold fields.
The House then went into committee
of the whole for the consideration of
bills on the private calendar.
A bill for the payment of $77,000 to
"William S. Grant of Cardiner, Me., for
supplies designed for the United States,
but confiscated by the Confederate
Government at the o-pening of the re
bellion, was favorably acted upon.
The Senate bill to refer to the Court
of Claims the claim of the corporation
of the book agents of the Methodist
Church, South, was next taken up.
Cooper CD.) of Texas, in charge of the
bill, moved as a substitute an appro
priation of $23*.00n for the full settle
ment of this claim.
The property of the corporation,
which was 'located at Nashville.-, Term..
â was s'-ized and held by thÂ» United
States from 1862 to 1566, when it was
turned over to the owners. Cooper re
ferred to the fact that the profits of the
concern were applied to the support of
superannuated ministers. Thousands
r.f ]>"litions from religious bodies, he
said, had been received, urging the pas
sage of the bill. Dalz^ll (R.) of Penn
sylvania inaugurated a filibuster
against the measure by demanding th<Â»
reading of the report of the bill, which
consisted of about fifty pages, the read-
Ing of which would consume several
hours.
At the conclusion of an hour, when
Dalzell's time expired, the friends of
the bill attempted to secure an agree
ment for closing the debate, but all re
quests looking to this end were ob
jected to.
Richardson (D.) of Tennessee appeal
ed to the other side to allow a vote on
the bill. Savers (D.) of Texas said this
was as just a claim as had ever been
presented to Congress. The amount
asked by the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, in this bill. he said was
not SO per cent of the amount which
had been recommended in the Court of
Claims. Lending bishops and divines
North and South had indorsed it. Com
mon justice, not charity, demanded its
passage.
Grosvenor fR.I of Ohio made a ten
minute speech in support of the bill
He said he knew personally enough
about the claim to say that $238,000 was
a very low estimate of the damage sus
tained by the corporation. After fur
ther discussion and before disposing of
the bill the House adjourned.

The committee on common schools
and public institutions considered
the measure to-day, and mem

number of letters from principals of fe
male schools which advocated the pas
sage of the measure, and attached so
much importance to it as to cause those

bill to declare that they would vote to
make it a law. The bill has for its ob
tec} the protection of school girls from
objectionable young men who loiter
around the schools. In this city there
are several large female schools and the
need of such a law is felt. When the
Legislature two years ago declined to

WEAK ALIBI
FOR WINTERS
EvideVtce Taken in De
fense of the Baden
Murder Suspect.
Seeks to Prove He Was in San
Francisco When Andrews
Was Slain.
Case Will Probably Be in the Hands
of the Jury by Noon
To -Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. Jan. 14.â The evi
dence for the people in the Baden mur
der case has been taken, and the de
fense this afternoon commenced the
introduction of testimony. Attorney
Nagle made an attempt to prove an
alibi for his client Winters. The
taking: of testimony -will probably be
completed by to-morrow noon, and a
verdict may be expected by night.
Patrick Ferriters brother John to
day corroborated in every particular
the testimony of Patrick Ferriter and
James McNamara as to what took
place in the Grand Hotel on the morn
ing of November IT. He had grot a good
look at the face of the robber, and he
identified Winters as the man. Ferri
ter was asked to look at the defendant
and see if he positively identified him.
He replied, "He's the man."
Constable Fred Desirello said he saw
Winters in company with Raymond
about 9 o'clock on the evening of the
16th of November, in front of the Ar
cade Hotel in South Pan Francisco.
He followed them as they moved about
;;n<l saw them go in the direction of the
Grand Hotel. Thomas Riley, a labor
er at the packing house, saw Winters
and Raymond about h.ilf way from
the packing house to Haden, the dis
tance being p. bout a mile between the
two points. This was on the afternoon
of the 16th of November, the day be
fore the murder, and between L':3o and
3:30 o'clock. He Identified Winters,
and. upon the production of Raymond
in court, recognized him as the other
man.
Richard Connolly, the man who was
shot that night. Identified Winters as
the man captured in the hall of the ho
tel.
Mr. Kagle, counsel for defendant,
presented an affidavit of defendant
asking for a continuance to procure
the attendance of Mr. Hammond of
the Weather Bureau for the purpose
of showing at what time the moon rose
and set on the night in question. The
court denied the motion, remarking
that he would take Judicial notice of
that matter and instruct the jury ac
cordingly.
Attorney Nagle then made his open
ing statement to the jury. He said he
would prove an alibi, and that Win
iiii not own the pistol introduced
in evidence against him. He then
made an offer of the Grand Hotel in
Baden in evidence for the defendant,
which caused considerable mirth in the
courtroom. Nagle asked that the jury
be taken there to view the premises.
The court denied the motion.
In support of his alibi the defendant
called Charles George, who testified
that he saw Winters in San Francisco
about the 16th or 17th of November
last, but was n<>t sure o-f the date. An
other witness about as satisfactory, in
th" person Of '"harles Pleigle. testified
that he saw Winters a couple of months
ago in San Francisco, but could not
remember the date.
The defendant then took the stand
in his own behalf, and had just com
pleted his direct examination when
court adjmirn.d. He testified that on
the 16th of November he left San Fran
cisco and went to Baden looking for
work. He went out to the packing
house. ]>ut was unsuccessful in getting
employment. There was another man
with him whom he met in Baden, and
who went with him to the packing
house â a stranger to- him. He never
saw Raymond in Baden. On his way
back to the town he met a man driv
ing a grocery wagon and asked for a
ride, which he received as far as Ba
den. From there he started for Pan
Francisco. When he got to the Orand
Hotel hf> stopped and got a glass of
beer and some crackers. Having fin
ished his repast, he started on again
for Pan Francisco. That night he met
rharles fleorge. They knocked about
from saloon to saloon until about 11
o'clock, nt which time he went to the
Salvation Army quarters, on New-
Montgomery street, and slept in a five
cent bed all nicht.

WHITTIER'S
EARLY LOVE
A Boyhood Romance of
the Great Quaker
Poet.
An Interesting Story Revealed
on His Ninetieth
Birthday.
Admired a Beautiful Girl, but Soon
Realized That His Suit Was
Hopeless.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
BOSTON, Jan. 14.â 1t is of special in
terest that following John Greenleaf
"Whittier's ninetieth birthday, there
should be published for the first time
& full and absolutely authentic story
of the Quaker poet's boy love. It will
be remembered that Whittier, by his
Will, left $10,000 to the Amesbury Home
for Aged Women. In connection with
this comes the story of romantic inter
est.
Two years after the death of Whit
tier an old lady made application for
admission on the ground that in her
youth she was a schoolmate and friend
of the poet. She would no doubt have
been received if she had not died soon
after making the application. She was
Mrs. Evelyna Bray Downey. Evelyna
Bray was born at Marblehead, Mass.,
October 10, 1810. Evelyna is described
as a tall and strikingly beautiful bru
nette, with remarkable richness of col
oring. The house at which she boarded
was directly opposite that at which
"Whittier boarded. He was then nine
teen years old, and she was seventeen.
Whittier paid a visit to the home of
his schoolmate. She could not invite
him in, but instead suggested a stroll.
The young couple, after a discussion of
the situation, saw the hopelessness of
securing the needed consent of their
parents and whatever dreams they
may have cherished were from this
hour abandoned and they parted with
this understanding.
For more than fifty years they met
but once again. Miss Bray married a
St. Louis Episcopal clergyman. Rev.
"William S. Downey, an Englishman,
claiming to be of noble birth. He left
the Episcopal church and became a
Baptist evangelist, preaching in the
streets and distributing tracts of his
own composition. They came to New
York, where he continued to write and
distribute tracts. His wife had never
told him of her early acquaintance with
Whittier, but he found it out by a sin
gular chance, and wrote Whittier that
he was her husband and begged for as
sistance in his work of preaching the
gospel.
Whittier feared his old friend might
be in destitute circumstances, and for
her sake he made a liberal remittance.
The husband kept all this from his
wife, who, he knew, would at once re
turn the money. But she came upon
the fact by finding a letter of Whittier
in his pocket. She was indignant, but
her letter to Whittier returning the
money was written in the most delicate
terms and gave nothing of the misery
of her life. She was in occasional cor
respondence with him until the year of
his death. Their only meeting "was at
the Haverhill Academy reunion of 1885
fifty-eight years after the love episode
of their school days. He took her apart
from the other schoolmates and they
exchanged souvenirs.

Special PlFpatch to The Call.
LOS XNGELES, Jan. 14.â School Di
rector Webb's prosecutors had their in
ning tojrnight before the Board of Ed
ucation. They introduced testimony
which they claimed was in rebuttal,
though no one, but perhaps themselves,
: Bee when utted any tes
timony of the defense. W. A. Cheney,
the leadine: counsel for the prosecu
tion, on behalf of the League for Bet
ter City Government, had promised
thing very Interesting, but so far
as implicating the accused in anything
blameworthy the rebuttal was a fizzle;
in fact it was a veritable boomerang
the prosecution, for every witness
nony only to the good char
fairness and integrity of Walter
L. Webb
Whon the proceedings opened Secre
sald he had tried to sub-
J. F. Adams, but the latter had
left town and would not return for ten
days. It was finally agreed that the

Adams' testimony given In the Su
perior Court during the trial of Webb,
and that this be put In us part of the
cape for the defense.
Ex-Chairman Mathid and Directors
Conrey and Bartlett were put on by
the defense, and testified to their hav
ing been warned against Adams by
various persons, and that Webb had
expressed himself as being suspicious
of Adams' honesty, and had gone so
far in one instance as to suggest to
p r Mathis, who was then chairman of
the board, to put two strong members
the committees to which he ap
â¢ ! Adams. Conrey, who was
chairman of the teachers' committee, of
which Webb was a member, stated that
Webb had a" him very
kindly and that he had not been dom
: Â% Wi bb. so far as he kn-w.
He added that there had never been
â¢ii the members of
the teachers' committee, and that he
and Webb were always on friendly
terms. Their only difference of opin
ion was over th- cases of Miss Mac
Owen and Miss Harden, two of the
who were dropped from the
LSt June.
Deputy Superintendent of Schools
Ennis was the first witness put on
in rebuttal.
He t^tified that he had marked Miss
Mac Owen on one occasion "fair," and
on another "poor to fair." In giving
her marking to the teachers' commit

f Miss Owen was one of five or six
teachers, similarly rat^d. who had
been dropped. Her case was not ex

number of her friends had called on

Then came one of the witnesses who
was evidently expected to develop

Is a solicitor for the firm of Fuller
Company, dealers in oils. He testi
fied that he knew Adams. AxtÂ»ll and

- m^ months ago Mr. Edwards, an
other eoliciti r for Fuller & Co.. came
to me and said Mr. Adams said there
would have to be something in it for
him or we would lope the trade of th<*
prhoo] department. I wr-nt to Mr.
Adams. T .\ h" told me h<~- had authority

ing until I saw Mr. Webb. I reported
the result of my interview with Axtell
to Edwards, and asked him to P<-e
Webb. Adams never came to see why
he pot no rake-off."
Under the cross-examination of E. A.
Meserve, attorney for the defense,
Gauchnaur testified further as fol
lows:
"Edwards went to "Webb, and "Webb
Raid he wanted nothing but good
prices, and that he was not in that
Idnd of business."
Edwards was called by the prosecu
tion, and he proved one of the best
witnesses for the defense that has ta-

George M. Trowbridge testified to
having had nothing to dr. with the
â writing of the anonymous note sent to
\Vebb. reading as follows:

What this was in rebuttal of was not
made plain, though one of the attor

ONE IDECENT MORNING PAPER.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
I want to express my good feeling to
ward you for the way in which you
have handled the account of Durrant's
execution in this morning's issue. It
is a new departure for a morning paper
to publish euch sensational matter in
such a business-like shape, with noth
ing repulsive to the general reader â
mo unnecessary cuts and detail. I
! thank you for showing us that we have
i a morning paper which can be decent,
and hope you will continue in this di
' rectlon. Very truly yours,

NOT MINISTERING TO MORBIDITY-
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
I wish to thank The Call most sincere
ly for the wisÂ» nn<l patriotic manner in
which it subordinated its business in
terests to the higher interests of the
community in presenting the facts of
the Durrant execution without accom
panying illustrations, which, at best,
would have buf ministered to depraved
and morbid cravings. Yours truly,
WK. H. O'BRYAN.

MERITS PUBLIC APPROVAL.
In its report of the Durrant execution The Call inaugurated a new
departure is as sensible as it is refreshing. It gave a plain,
straightforward account of the gruesome affair, but did not have a sin
gle illustration. The other papers, the afternoon ones in particular, vied
with each other in Beeing how horrible and beastly they could be in
the pictorial line, and it was refreshing to turn to The Call and find a
page unmarred with hatchet-made cuts, but typographically as neat as
good taste could make it. This new move on the part of The Call is
an evidence that the picture craze for daily papers has about reached
its height. We shall be greatly mistaken if the public does not bestow
warm approval upon this new and needed departure.
ness took occasion to remark that he
thought it was a cowardly thinÂ£ for
Webb to have insinuated in his sicned
statement that witness was concerned
in the writing of the anonymous letter.
"Do you think it half as cowardly,"
demanded Mr. Meserve, "as the attacks
on Mr. Webb? I ask you as a man:
Was it half as cowardly as the attacks
of the Times on Mr. Webb, when Mr.
Webb had no newspaper at the back of
him?"
This question was repeated twice, but
the silence of the witness was the only
answer.
Xo other witnesses of importance
were examined, and it was decided to
have the further hearinp of rebuttal
testimony and the beginning of argu
ments go over until the evening of Jan
uary 27.

BURN PLANTATIONS.
Ranks of the Rebels Being Swelled, While
General Gomez Declares That Blanco
Can Never Pacify Cuba.
Copyright, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Jan. 14.â Insurgents de
stroyed 1,000,000 tobacco plants growing
under the protection of the forts at
Camajuanl, Santa Clara province, on
the night of January 5. They also de
stroyed 25,000 plants within sight of
the forts of Sitlo Grande.
The Herald correspondent has made
a Journey from Havana to Sagua la
Grande. He reports that not one fiupar
mill is grinding. The estate Isabel
near Media Luna, coast of Santiago de
Cuba, which Is strongly fortified, was
attacked by rebels under General Sal
vador Rios. The rebels had field
pieces and were doing great damage
to the buildings and forts when a
Spanish column from Manzanillo ap
peared. After a brief fight the rebels
retreated, but were not pursued.
Reports from Santiago de Tuba
province state that many persons are
leaving town to join th*Â» rebels. Two
filibustering expeditions have re
cently landed, one near Mayar Abjo
and the other near Sancto Spirltus.
Both were met by rebels and escorted
Inland.
The commander In chief of the rebel
army has ordered the following per
sons, whenever caught, to be court
martialed for murder: Benlto Carre
ras, Alejandro Oloarrieta, Eugenio
Layo, Pedro Mora Ledon, Gabriel la
Torre, Francisco Garcia, Manuel Can
ada, Pedro Robau, Felix Cuevillas, Hi
lario Alvarez, Ramon Menendez and
Domingo Roldan. The last named is
a naturalized citizen of the United
States.
In a letter to a friend in Havana
General Maximo Gomez says: "Let !
Blanco come to this district and he !
will have plenty to do. It seems to me
that the task of pacifying Cuba with
so many combatants to subdue is Im
possible of realization. Two hundn-d
thousand men under the general who ,
did not spare even animals have been j
unable to accomplish it; much less .
THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALI,, SATURDAY, JANUARY 15, 1898.
APPROVED BY PRESS AND PEOPLE.
THE manner in which The Call reported the execution of Durrant has found prompt approval from the
intelligence of the people and the press. This is made evident by the host of letters which have come
to us, and from the commendation given by many of the leading papers of the State. Some of these we
publiph this morning in order to make known the extent to which popular sentiment revolts against the
morbid sensationalism so often shown in cases of this kind, and the degree of satisfaction with which
it notes in The Call the proper treatment of such subjects.
The Call told the story of the execution of Durrant as a matter of news, without straining to make the
horror more horrible still by ghastly pictures of the gallows and of other incidents or accessories of the ex
ecution. It recognized that in this case from the first day of the arrest of Durrant degenerate journalism
had overdone itself in Its vicious, foul and demoralizing efforts to make this crime a source of profit to itself
by pandering to all perverted tastes and the morbid craving for sensationalism among the lowest classes of
the people.
To mark out a clear and unmistakable distinction between legitimate Journalism and that of the un
speakable yellow. The Call published no picture of the execution. It set before the public a contrast with sen
sationalism and left it to the people to Judge for themselves which is best.
The people have noted the contrast and have given Judgment. The Call has been commended by all
whose commendation is worth having. Public sentiment has repudiated decadent journalism. It has shown
that it does not share the morbid tastes of criminal perverts, nor approve of the shrieking panders of the
press who disgrace decency in order to profit by that taste.
The Call is gratified by the prompt approval which has come to it, not so much because of the praise
given to itself as because of the unmistakable proof it gives that the tone of our people is higher than de
graded journalism would have tfte world believe.

VAN GEISTE SAYS
THE INSURGENTS WILL
SOON WIN FREEDOM.
DeJa. r. 7V,.i Riots at Havana Would Lead
Up fr xhe Salvation of the
Cuban Cause.
ONTARIO, Cal., Jan. 14.â Julius Van
Geiste. a recent arrival from Cuba and
an agent of the Cuban Government, ar
rived here to-night on his way to San
Francisco-, there to proceed, per orders
of the Cuban Junta, to his post of duty.
Three months ago he obtained a fur
lough from the Cuban army on account
of ill-health, and that furlough has ex
pired.
When shown the dispatches to-night
r warding the riots in Havana, Van
â â â  laughed, and with great glee
said: "It would be the salvation of the
Cuban cause."
Two yt-ars ago, December 15, 1595,
Van Geiste, at the head of 368 volun
teers, left St. Louis. They proceeded In
squads to New Orleans. From there
they shipped to Del Rio province and
Joined the insurgents. Arriving in Cu
ba. Van Geiste was engaged as a con
fidential agent of Antonio Maceo, thÂ»
late Cuban general, with whom he had
been engaged in business in Honduras
for a number "f years. In this work
he was engaged until his- health be
came such that h<> was compelled to
come t" this country f>r medical :
ment, passing through Havana and
shipping at that point to Galveston.
While in Havana Van Geiste was ar
rested, and, as h-- Bays, he would have
been in jail since had he claimed Amer
ican citizenship, but in this case he
claimed French citizenship. As it was,
he was released and went to Arizona,
staying at Wllcox for four months.
Van Geiste is confident that the in
surgents will win out in the long run.
He declares that the fear of dynamite
in the hands of the insurgents causes
the Spanish sÂ»oldiÂ«rs to stay very close
to Havana. Further, he declares that
If the Cubans were to concentrate their
forces they could take Havana without
trouble any day, "but what would be
the good." says he. "The Spanish
would retire to their ships and shell the
town. We will not again be trapped.
The death of Maceo has taught us a
lesson. I was within three miles of his
headquarters when he was lured to his
death by Dr. Zertucha. and a more de
spised individual there is not to be
found on the island than he to-day.
"Maceo." continued Van Geiste. "was
a serious loss to the cause, but Gomez
Is as uncompromising as he was. and
Cuban independence is not far away."

DESERVES CREDIT FOR THE DEPARTURE
':"."â¢ â "'â "â  Oakland Enquirer.
"It Is by design, and after mature de
liberation, that The Call prints the sto
ry of the Dun-ant execution without
any illustrations, and with no attempt
at embellishment of the plain facts."
So says The Call of this morning, and
it deserves credit for its departure from
the usual custom. Whatever one's calm
judgment of the merit of capital pun
ishment may be, whenever he sees In a
newspaper a picture of a man on a
scaffold with a rope nround his neck,
he feels like saying with the poetâ
"The nil- wÂ« tree!
Breath of Christian charity.
Blow and sweep it from the earth!"
MANLY AND HUMANE REPORT.
Solano County Courier.
The Call is to be commended for its de
cent, manly and humane report of tho
execution of Durrant. Its columns were
not contaminated with disgraceful pic
tures which are calculated to make crime
famous and cause red-handed murderers
to pose as the heroes of the period. We
hope to see The Call continue to hold up
the banner of common decency.
YELLOW JOURNALISM REBUKED.
Pan Bernardino Free Press.
The San Francisco Call did not publish
a single illustration of the execution of
Durrant. This was a relief to its readers
and a strong rebuke to yellow journal

Captain Warner of the steamer Alice
Blanchard will be glad to hear that his
vessel is not to remain very long on the
Portland route. The Marshal at As
toria wants to see him on urgent busi
ness, but Captain Warner refuses to be
seen. In fact, so anxious Is he to
avoid the Interview that he passed As
toria on his homeward voyage, al
though there was freight awaiting him
there.
Two trips ago, when the vessel ar
rived at Astoria, Captain Warner en
gaged eight stevedores to discharge the
cargo. When it came to settling up
he paid off four of them at the usual
rate of 30 cents an hour and 40 cents
an hour for overtime. The other four
stevedores refused to accept their pay,
saying they were entitled to 40 cents
an hour and 50 cents for overtime. A
row followed and the stevedores threat
ened to thrash the captain of the
Blanchard. The latter went below and
getting his Winchester drove the men
ashore. He then sent one of the sail
ors ashore to cast off the steamer's
lines, but the stevedores assaulted him
and the sailor was glad to get back on
the steamer with his life. Captain
Warner then ordered First Mate Knea
ly ashore to throw off the lines and at
the same time covered the fighting
stevedores \viÂ£h his rille. The mate
cast the lines off and the vessel got to
sea.
When the Alice Blanchard got to As
toria the last time the constable was
waiting for Captain Warner with a
warrant for his arrest on a charge of
threats to kill. The steamer, however,
j got away before the warrant was
served, and on the way back from Port
land Captain Warner again avoided
the constable hy putting to sea without
calling at Astoria.
The Blanchard is to be withdrawn
from the Portland trade on the com pie
j tion of her next trip. She will then
! go to Los Angeles and will carry min
ers from that point to Copper River.

Sir: I cannot refrain from writing a line to you fa. express my thanks

and through them to the world in your Saturday edition of The Call.
For some time I have noticed and favorably commented upon the ab
sence of all vulgar sensationalism in your paper, but I was particu
larly pleased on Saturday with the absence of illustrations of the Dur
rant execution.
I thank you for thus proving that San Francisco can and does pro

filth to its customers. Hoping that you will receive the support you
deserve, believe me yours faithfully, WILLIAM D. KIDD,

PIONEER IN f*N IMPORTANT MOVEMENT
Berkeley Evening World.
The action of the San Francisco Call
In publishing no pictures illustrating its
account of the Durrant execution may
be the beginning of new methods in re
gard to such affairs. The paper may
prove to have been the pioneer in a very
important movement.
Illustrations in a daily newspaper are
of value only in two cases: when they
present something in the nature of a map,
diagram or view aiding the description
of inanimate things. and when they show,
from photographs, the features of a char
acter in whom the public is Interested,
no matter why. All other pictures are
useless because they are as likely as not
to be entirely imaginaryâ many of them
are drawn before the event they repre
sent took place. As this is becoming
more and more generally known the pub
lic is less and less interested in such pic
tures. â¢
LET THE GOOD BE PICTURED.
Hanforfl Sentinel.
The Call did a very satisfactory tarn
in journalism when. In giving a full ac
count of the Durrant hanging, it re
frained from illustrating the scene with
those terrible pictures such as other San
Francisco papers printed. Now let The
Call keep on in the good work. Certain
pictures of certain events are all right,
but keep those of crime and meanness
out of sight. Picture the good.
ft PRAISEWORTHY EXCEPTION.
"Watsonvllle Pajaronlan.
The Call was the only one of the San
Francisco papers which reported the ex
ecution of Durrant without the use of
pictures and large scare heads. It gave
a complete account of the execution with
out padding, and the absence of the pic
tures of the drop, etc.. was one of thf>
most commendable departures made by
the San Francisco press.

Is the Use of a Swab
Necessary or
Injurious ?
Dr. Mahoney to Test the Con
stitutionality of the Ordi
nance.
HÂ© Is Charged With Not Applying to
the Board of Health for
a Swab,
Dr Thomas L.. Mahoney Intends to
test the constitutionality of the recent
ordinance of the Board of Health mak
ing it compulsory in suspected cases of
diphtheria for the attending physician,
to procure from the health office a swab
to be placed in the patient's throat and
sent to the office for bacteriological ex
amination.
Dr. Mahoney attended a case of diph
theria and reported it to the health of
fice, but did not apply to the office for a
swab, as he considered it unnecessary.
He was arrested for violating the ordi
nance and the case was called in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday. He was de
fended by Colonel Smith, and Garret
McEnerney appeared for the prosecu
tion.
Handel H. Zobel, assistant secretary
of the Board of Health, was called and
testified that Dr. Mahoney had report
ed a case of diphtheria but did not ap
ply for a swab for bacteriological ex
amination.
Dr. Buckley was then called for the
defense and was asked, "How is diph
theria diagnosed?" This was promptly
objected to by McEnerney, and an ar
gument followed. Smith contending
that he was entitled to introduce evi
dence to show that the introduction of
a swab into the throat of a patient was
a detriment and caused the disease to
spread. The disease could be diagnosed
without a swab, which was simply done
by the Board of Health for scientific
research.
On the other hand, McEnerney con
tended that the unreasonableness of
the ordinance could not be impeached
by evidence, but must be determined
upon the evidence itself. The judge
overruled the objection, and Dr. Buck
ley answered the question that the only
way to diagnose the disease was by the
eyesight. He would not use a swab un
der any circumstances, because it ag
gravates the disease and leads often to
the death of the patient.
Drs. Kuhlman, Perry and O'Connell
testified practically to the same effect.
Dr. Kuhlman said that in New York in
1894 out of 6511 cases of diphtheria
treated bacteriologically in only 50 per
cent was bacillus found.
The defendant testified that he had
long since abolished the swab and used
a spray Instead. The introduction of a
swab might jeopardize the life of a
child. For that reason he did not send
to the health office for a swab. It took
him about three minutes to diagnose
the case.
For the prosecution Dr. Spencer, bac
teriologist for the Board of Health, tes
tified that nearly all the advanced phy
sicians of the present day used the
swab for a diagnosis of the case. The
object was to primarily and fundamen
tally check the spread of the disease
He differed with the doctors for the de
fense as to the injurious effect of using
the swab. Dr. O'Brien, Health Officer.
Dr. J. M. Rosenau and Dr. Clarke cor
roborated Dr. Spencer.
It was decided to argue the case on
Tuesday and it was continued till then.

MAKE IT TWENTY THOUSAND.
/~* CONTRIBUTIONS to the fund for the Golden
I Jubilee are reported to be coming in with in-
creased liberality. The finance committee con
sioers that about $16,000 of sure muney is in sight.
This encourages the hope that the full sum required
to carry out the festival according to the programme
designed will be forthcoming.
The amount needed is $20,000. It would be gratify
ing if the amount lacking in the contributions couM
be raised to-day so that on Monday the committee in
charge could set about the week's work with free
hands. The amount necessary to complete the fund
is now comparatively small. Contrasted with the
greatness of San Francisco and the dignity of the
occasion to be celebrated it is virtually a trifle. It
ought to be raised in half a day.
San Francisco has invited the whole country to par
ticipate in the jubilee, and thousands of visitors from
distant States will be here to witness it. Bands of
pioneers who have been living in the East for years
will make this an occasion for returning to the golden
land where they worked in their youth. These will
influence other? to come. Moreover, the Californian
tourist season is now at its height. The host of
Americans who seek sunny lands every winter will
find in the jubilee and the mining fair additional in
ducements to visit San Francisco.
With all of these visitors to look on it will not do
for us to fail in any particular. The American people
are becoming critical of pageants. They have seen a
great many of them, and the time has passed when
anything in the way of a procession would be ac
cepted with approval. Only really artistic achieve
ments win praise in these day?, and such get much
more than mere praise. The festivals at New Orleans,
St. Louis and other cities where true artistic parades
are given are profitable from the standpoint of busi
rc-s as well as of pleasure.
All arguments are on the side of liberality. We
have undertaken the enterpri-e. We have raised
enough money to assure a notable pageant. More is
needed to accomplish a true artistic triumph. Help
the fund at once. Make it $20,000 by sundown.
GOLD IN THE EAST.
A CONVINCING evidence of the return of pub
lic confidence in the monetary affairs of the
country is afforded by reports in the Eastern
pr.pers of the reappearance of gold as a circulating
medium in that section of the Union. So long as
there was any fear of the triumph of the free silver
agitators many persons hoarded gold, and in the East
it went out of circulation altogether. Now that sound
money has achieved a complete triumph and return
ing prosperity on the gold basis has put an end to the
cafeer of the calamity howlers these hoards are beirir
released and the long hidden money is returned to the
channels of trade.
As a result of the reappearance of gold in business
uses it is noted that it has become so plentiful the
New York Clearing-house has been settling balances
in gold coin, and not long ago the treasury declined
to pay the freight on one million of dollars of gold
coin that certain San Francisco banks wished to ex
change for greenbacks. The hoarding of gold is vir
tually a thing of the past. It has gone with the panic
that caused it.
This condition of affairs is exactly what was pre
dicted by the sound money men during the campaign.
It was well known to all in a position to watch in
telligently the movements of money that during the
free silver scare many timid capitalists and cautious
owners of small savings withdrew their gold from the
banks and locked it up in safe deposit boxes or in
secure places around their homes so as to be safe if
the silver party should come into power. Knowing
this, the intelligent student of events was able to pre
dict with confidence that as soon as the scare was
over the gold would be put into circulation again.
That which was foreseen has happened. The East
does not use gold to any great extent, but all that it
needs it has. and there is no longer a gold scarcity in
any part of the country.
One of the best results of the return of gold to
easy circulation in the East will be the strengthening
of the movement for complete monetary reform. It
is better to make the changes necessary to adapt our
financial system to the needs of business at this time
when confidence is well assured and industry is
prosperous than to put it off to some future day. The
time to repair a roof is when the sun shines. We may
not always have good times, and any attempt at mon
etary legislation in bad times would be sure to bring
to the front a new set of agitators as pestiferous as
those that disturbed the country during the Bryanittf
campaign.
It is not clear at first glance why a collector, of
good reputation, claiming to have been robbed by a
pair of footpads, should be at once accused by the
police of having made up the tale. If the police think
there are no footpads in town they certainly ought
to read the papers.
THE PASSING OF DOLE.
THE Hawaiian oligarchy is reported to intend
sending its chief, the Shah Doie, to Washington
to lobby lor annexation, for coolie labor, for
separate laws not to be operative outside the islands,
for the payment of the debts of his oligarchy, amount
ing to $4,000,000, by the American taxpayers, for $19
a ton protection on raw sugar which will transfer
nearly $6,000,000 a year from the pockets of Ameri
can taxpayers to those of the island planters who hire
coolie labor and pay Dole's expenses.
It is expected in Honolulu that the Shah's appear
ance here will light the welkin with the coruscations
of enthusiasm which mil follow his progress to the
Potomac on his errand to instruct the Congress of
the United States in its duty. It is given out that he
comes for the good of this country, which reminds us
of the royal procession which followed the landing in
London of George I. That princely Brunswicker
could not speak English. In his train were a number
of adipose Duchesses of uncertain relations to the
court, one of whom was accomplished to the extent of
a few words of the language of the country. At sight
of the foreign looking outfit London temper broke
out in the form of various remarks uncomplimentary
to the new royalty. The accomplished Duchess at
tempted to set matters right by crying out:
"Shentlemens, don't pc so mat. We come for all
your goods."
"Yes, and for our chattels, too, you," was
yelled back from the mob. ,
Shah Dole seems to be out for chattels, and the
American taxpayer and wage earner is not just now
enthusiastic over a promoter of higher taxes and
lower wages.
He comes as President of the Hawaiian republic,
we are told. When was he elected? How many votes
did he get? Were there other candidates? Will he
explain the method of electing Presidents in his re
public? Did the people elect a majority of the Con
stitutional Convention of Hawaii? Why has the num
ber of electors decreased from 14.000 to 2800? Does
a man in order to vote have to swear alle
giance to the constitution? Does not the
constitution provide for annexation to the
United States, and therefore does not every man who
swears to support it take an oath to support annexa
tion? Does not this prove that out of a population of
more than 100.000 there are only 2800 in favor of an
nexation, for only that number take the constitutional
oath?
Is Hawaii, then, a republic, resting on the consent
of the governed, or is it an oligarchy, sustained by an
armed force and maintained by the presence of an
American man-of-war?
This farcical Dole is no more President of a repub
lic than is Mir Mahmud of Beloochistan or his many
wived Excellency, Sidi Ali of Tunis.
Mr. Dole is not a promoter of republican institu
tions. He i^ out for "the stuff."' He goes to Wash
ington as a Colonel Mazuma, and his appearance here
on such an errand is a scandal that should be re
sented. Members of his oligarchy have preceded him
and have worked for months unsuccessfully to rob
American taxpayers of their money and the Hawaii*
ans of their country. Their presence here on such an
tiir.nd has been an insult to our people, and self
icspecting members of Congress i-hould resent it.
HOSPITAL AND ZOO.
IT is reported that at the meeting of the Board of
Supervisors on Monday Dr. Rottanzi will intro
duce a resolution providing for the construction
of a new County Hospital upon the Almshonse tract.
The resolution, according to the synopsis which has
beep given to the public, may be said to kill two birds
with one stone. It puts a quietus upon the Mission
zoo job by proposing to convert the present hospital
tract into a park and at the same time provides for
the erection, as already stated, of a new County Hos
pital â an improvement that has long been needed.
The tract at Twenty-sixth street comprises about
ten acres. It is not very well situated for a park, but
for a monkey garden it possesses distinct merit. It is
located at the foot of a bluff and is bounded on three
sides by civilization. With proper improvements,
therefore, the smell inseparable from a zoo could prob
abiy be confined during any but very warm weather.
The tract possesses another merit. It can be turned
into a zoo or a park without much expense. The
Supervisors may close the cross streets r.r.d the land
thus acquired will cost nothing. This, of course,
would cause dissatisfaction among the real estate men
who have Mission park sites for sale, but their in
terests need not be considered by the Supervisors.
The project of constructing a new County Hospital
upon the Almshouse tract is one that ought to be en
couraged. The present hospital has been a disgrace
to the city for over ten years. At tly; time it was con
ceived there was no intention that it should be any
thing more than a temporary affair. Its builders an
ticipated that long ere this it would be a thing of the
past. But from year to year it has been sustained
with repairs until it is now in very much the same
situation as the one-horse shay was said to have been
shortly before its collapse. It will be remembered
that that famous vehicle ran until the last moment.
Then its mainspring broke and it fell into a thousand
pieces.
It has been said that the sick poor of San Francisco
are treated worse at the County Hospital than the
city's prisoners are treated at the county jails. This
is a hard thing to say, but it is probably true. Even
tl the doctors at the Twenty-sixth street institution
were not political doctors, and even if the nurses and
attendants were not politicians, it would be impos
sible to get anything in the shape of decent service
out of the building. That structure never was much
more than a barn. It is now saturated with disease
germs and is a disgrace to the city. We think the Su
pervisors should give Dr. Rottanzi's resolution the
most serious attention.
CafTery opposes the immigration bill now before
the Senate. The gentleman hails from the State in
which eleven foreigners were lynched one night with
in the memory of living children. Would not the re
strictive plan of regulating the character of the popu
lation be better than that of letting everybody in and
.then killing the undesirable? Or perhaps Senator
Caffery wants his constituents to have a little diver
tisement occasionally, although it is really more fun
to hunt possums than aliens who may have to be paid
for.
France may put Zola in jail, but even there he
wouid go right on constructing novel*. On the whole
not much would be gained. And. anyhow, there are
other people over there who seem more adapted, by
moral qualities, to prison life.
Perhaps the new primary law is not perfect, hut
there is said to be something about it rendering diffi
cult the O'Donnell feat of climbing on the ticket So
to a certain extent the people are sure to rise up and
call the law blessed.
THE SAN rKAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 15, 1898.
IZIjOR several days The Call has had something to
say concerning the jutebag business as con
ducted by the Prison Directors, and has, as
must have been evident to the reader, not fully co
incided with the views of that body. There is a law
supposed to govern the transactions of the directors,
and the calmness with which they habitually ignored
it demanded a protest. This law was designed to
protect the farmer. Its evident purpose was to pre
vent the middleman from speculation in the products
of the mill at San Quentin. Yet the Prison Direct
ors have been systematically playing into the hands
of the middlemen. They have fixed the price so as
to accommodate the middleman, the money-loaner,
and to keep the farmer from participating in the
benefits. Of course they appear to be indignant.
They have been caught.
There can be no defense of the practice of ar
bitrarily fixing the price of grainbags when the
statutory provision is that this price shall be a cer
tain sum in addition to the absolute cost. There cer
tainly can be no defense of the way members of the
board had of letting friends kno*' when the price
was about to be raised so as to enable them "to get
in on the ground floor." If De Pue and his asso
ciates choose to be aggrieved these columns are
open to any explanation they may wish to make.
The method has been particularly unfair to the
farmer. It has forced him to make affidavits not
strictly in accord with facts. When the farmer
needed, say, iooo bags and had not the money to se
cure them he has been obliged to go to the middle
man. From the middleman he got the necessary
financial assistance. All he had to <Jo was to swear
that he needed 5000 or 10.000 baps. Then out of the
goodness of his heart the middleman would make
an advance sufficient to secure the amount asked.
He would keep all but the small supply the farmer
really needed, make the farmer pay freight on the
entire lot. and then sell the balance at an advanced
price, this being made possible by the board, who
never failed to keep the middleman posted as to the
extent to which the price was to jump and the time
of jumping. For the great orders received from
speculators there is absolutely no warrant in law.
In fact, the method used in ordering made a mock
ery of the statutory provision supposed to cover the
matter, and, honestly administered, entirely com
petent to cover it. The fact seems to be" that the
Prison Directors have made no effort to abide by
the law, that they have favored their friends, sold in
large quantities to speculators who had no right to
purchase, and have, in a word, set aside all legal re
strictions tending to govern their acts. Against the
mass of evidence they can hardly present more than
an apo'ogy and a declaration of intent to throw
themselves upon the mercy of the public. They do
not seem to have been guilty of wanton corruption,
but they have been careless. Perhaps without mean
ing to do so they have assumed a position superior
to the law, and the time has arrived for them to
come down.
THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION.
DEBATE in the Senate on the Immigration re
striction bill progresses with a degree of de
liberation which threatens to postpone a vote
to a date so far distant that thousands of unworthy
immigrants may obtain acce>< to the country before
the desired educational rest i is imposed.
On Tuesday Senator Fairhild made a speech in
favor of the measure, and after he closed the Senate
turned to other business. On Thursday Senator Caf
fery obtained recognition to speak against the bill
and then once more the Senate turned to other busi
ness. The measure, in fact, is being treated as a sort
of sandwich to other measures and is brought out
only on occasions when there is an idle hour or so
in the Senate chamber.
Beneficial as the proposed restriction will be to all
parts of the Union and universally popular as it is, it
vv ill not be passed without the employment of con
siderable vigor on the part of its advocates. There is
a strong opposition to } >c overcome. Senator Caf
u-ry does not stand alone in his fight against the bill.
He will have plenty of allies to assist in defeating it
if possible, and he and they will leave no parliament
ary stone unturned in their efforts to accomplish that
object.
The source of the opposition is to be found in the
great steamship companies which make large profits
out of the immigrant traffic. These companies are
not going to lose the lucrative trade of importing im
migrants if they can help it. and are actively engaged
in the task of bringing pressure to bear upon Con
gress in their intercut.
It will be remembered that last winter it was made
known that foreign steamship companies were "per
niciously active" in their efforts to defeat the bill.
H. Claussenius & Co., general Western agents of the
North German Lloyd Steamship Company, sent a
telegram to F. W. A. Pope of Milbank, South Da
kota, as follows: "Immigration bill comes up in the
House Wednesday; wire your Congressman, our ex
pense, protesting against proposed exclusion and re
questing bill be defeated, informing him that vote in
favor means defeat at next election."
In an interview with the Chicago Times-Herald Mr.
Claussenius stated he had sent similar telegrams to
over 200 persons. This open interference of foreign
companies with American legislation aroused indigna
tion at the time and helped to defeat the object it was
intended to serve.
No such telegrams will be sent out this winter, nor
will there be any other public manifestation of foreign
interest in the affair. Nevertheless, the foreign oppo
sition will find a way to make itself felt. It is, there
fore, timely to recall the Clatisscnius telegram. The
people should be on guard. Demands for a speedy
passage of the bill should be sent to Congress from
all parts of the country. The new restrictive meas
ure should be enacted in time to head off the rush of
illiterate immigrants this summer.
The slayer of Actor Terriss is now in prison, to re
nir.in "at the Queen's pleasure." The prisoner is in
for life and he might as well make up his mind to it.
1 o be kept from hanging by the plea of insanity in
England does not mean the privilege of roaming un
trammeled and occasionally killing a man just to
show that the insanity is in good working order.
Not a day passes without the record of at least one
man swindled out of all his money by some game so
old, so overworked and so familiar as to make the
possibility of using it a marvel. How the victims re
frain from blowing out the gas long enough to give
the bunko man a chance is a source of constant won
der.
The Victoria (B. C.) Times gives scant evidence of
being a newspaper, but it fairly bulges with informa
tion as to how other papers should be conducted.
It is as well to be frank. The congratulations sent
by Forakcr to Hanna were hollower than a drum.
THE COT OUT OF THE BAG.
PLAGIARISM IN THE POLICE COURTS.
"I am very clad," said Judge Campbell, thoughtfully stroking his eel 2
brated beard, "that the newspapers are taking this matter up. It's posi
tively the IwMoit. crudest piece of work I ever saw. If a man hasn't mere
of originality than to deliberately copy so well known a style as mine, he's
not fit to preside over a police court. That's all there Is to it.
"If the copy was a good one, now, or even fairly correct, I wouldn't mind
so much. But the sort of facetiae that Low and Joachimsen are getting off
these days is enough to make even a Judge swear. I'm toldâ mind. I don't
know how true it isâ that these two Police Judges, disguised as reporters,
have spent day after day in my court studying closely my manner, my style
of repartee and the various degrees of wit that fit different occasion;). If
this is true, it only shows the stupidity of my facetious rivals, for their
efforts are enough to disgust one forever with police court wit.
"That's the worst of this sort of thing. Whenever an artist originates
anything there will always be a horde of imitators. They not only Jail in
their efforts in duplicating the style of the genius; they also spoil the
public's taste for the real articleâ andâ and then 'where am I at?' "
"The unfortunate thing is that a style of witticism is so intamjible a
thing that it's hard to get it patented," said the sympathetic interviswer.
"That's exactly it." exclaimed the Judge. "But the injury's not intan
gible, I assure you. Suppose Low or Joachimsen is starred by the news
paper that's fighting me. Of course, you and I know that neither of 'em can
say a funny thing, no matter how hard they try, but the inartistic masses
are likely to take these two frauds on the paper's say so, and the conse
quences are that my courtroom will be deserted. A pretty country school
ma'am comes to town for entertainment. Where does she go? Naturally to
Low or Joachimsen. Reporters in search of stories '11 move further down
the corridor. My reputation us chief jester will suffer, and the cro .yds who
laugh now at my jokes will question whether there's anything funny in
them. I know," continued the Judge, his voice trembling with sincere emo
tion, "that there will always be a select circle to appreciate true merit, but
the masses laugh because they have been told things are funny, not because
they appreciate real humor. And, incidentally, it isn't the select circle that
elects Police Judges.
"Look at this, now." The Judge drew out a morning paper folded so as
to show an article on Judges Low and Joachimsen.
"Just glance over this jeu desprit of Lows about the Chinaman who went
to the Klondike. Did you ever read anything so bad? Here's the patrol
man's own joke about its being as easy to wash gold as clothes, and Low
hasn't any more originality than to follow up with that weak old chestnut
about the story being unlike the client. It won't wash!" repeated Judge
Campbell with fine disgust. "There's wit for you! There's brilliancy!
there's genius!
"Why, Low told a friend of mine that he learned his style when he was
police reporter and used to haunt my court. If that isn't adding insult to
injury! It's enough to make a man go to law. I wonder if I couldn't ask
for ;in injunction forbidding Low to Joke; or if that couldn't be done, for
bidding him from lowering the standard of my court by his pretense of
having a diploma from me?
"And this thing of Joaehimsen's! Why. any clown could tell him that
the obvious joke about Sousa and a march was to be avoided. Why, do you
know I actually contemplated when I read that changing my style alto
gether. If this thing goes on I'll be driven to a wholly different role. To be
classed with those two funereal jesters is more than a man with my reputa
tion can bear.
"Say. 11l tell you something in confidence. Mind, it's not for publication.
Wfll. all right. Now, it's a fact that Low has copies of everything that was
ever printed about me, and he pores over the things that I have said, study
ing them over and over again till he knows them by rote. Well," the Judge
laughed scornfully, "now, as to Joachimsen. Graham told me"â here the
Judge's voice sank to a shocked whisperâ "his own prosecuting attorney told
me that Joachimsen insists upon Graham's learning a sort of prearranged
dialogue, so that his cues may lead up to Joachimsen's opportunity. It's a
fact! I got it straight! Now, what do you think of that for a man who pre
tends to run his court as a spontaneous sideshow?
"However, as I said. I'm glad the newspapers are taking this thing up.
Tf those spurious Campbells, those police court pretenders are not ashamed
to continue their flagrant plagiarism in the face of public disapproval, why
I've got to do one of two thingsâ out-Campbell thtm or reform and in my
old age become dull and respectable."
His Honor mounted the bench, spat with elegance and precision into the
very center of the nearest cuspidor, rapped upon his desk, and the curtain
rose upon the only bona-fide police court farce in town.

they were engaged In religious work, and
assuring him that any favor granted
them would be duly remembered by the

to their home in one of the little towns of

They were both green enough to do for
a St. Patrick's day banner; but while the
man was modest and unassuming, the

Mr. Hamilton told them that as he

to proceed.
"The richest man In the railroad busi

advise you to go to him. as he recently
sustained heavy losses through his pas

"Go down to the Central Pacific, and
there you will find my friend Billy Vice,
who is a leader in local church work, and
I am sure your modest request will be at
once complied with."
The couple went to see Vice, and ac
quainted him with their desire, telling
him who sent them.
"There is a strict law against giving
away passes," said Mr. Vice, "but if you
will let me sell you the tickets I will
make you a present of a dozen cabinet
photos taken by this camera (pointing to
the phone), which I have for this par

The couple sat down, while Billy turned
the bell crank, and, after giving him the

THE YOUNG PRIEST THOMAS J, O'CONNELL
Thomas J. O'ConrK- 1 .!. a ynung and rorcni graduate of thÂ« Catholic Seminary at
Baltimore, was ordnined priest of the Roman Catholic Church yesterday morning at
Bt. Mary's Cathedral.
Surrounded by wmtirs of his family, hfl early teaohf-rs. and representatives
cf the different Catholic churches throughout the city, young O'Connell prostrated
himself before the tabernacle of his God and took up the cross of the Savior.
The usual ordination ceremony was performed and the church was crowded with
friends of the young priest and outsiders rager to witness the services.
The most Impressive moment of the entire ceremony wns just after the epistle,
when the archdeacon summoned the young priest to the throne of the archbishop.
Young O'Connell advanced, clad In the nmire, alb, stole and maniplo of the secu
lar priest, holding a folded chaslble over the left arm and carrying a candle and
two pieces of linen cloth in the right hand.
As the young priest approached, the archdeacon, aa Is the custom In the cere
mony, solicited his ordination from the archbishop.
At the singing of the Veni Creator the archbishop anointed the palm of each
hand with sacred oil. This being done he tied the hands together with the linen
bands to remind the young priest of the moment recorded In the Acts of the Apos
tles, when Agabus, figuratively speaking, bound his hands with Paul's girdle.
After receiving the vestments, the sacred vessels were next handed to him, the
rhalice being filled with wine and water and the first vessel put :n the hands of the
new priest.
At the conclusion of the mass the archbishop extended both hands over the
head of the newly ordaini d priest, uttering his blessing as ho did so, and concluding
â with the following words:
"Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven
them; and -whose pins you shall retain, they fire retained."
After taking a vow of obedience and reverence to the archbishop and after
making a promise of fidelity to the church in all that pertains to the ecclesiastical
ministry, the young priest entered the ranks of the clergy and became an ordained
priest of the church.
The Rev. J. )i. Hannlpan acted ns master of ceremonieÃ to the new priest during
the mass. Those who I the archbishop were the Rev. Fathers Byrne and
Mulligan of the Cathedral Parish.
A representative from nearly every church in the city attended the services, but
the most prominent were Rc-v. John Cottle, pastor of Kt. Brigld'fl parish; Rev. Henry
"Wyman, pastor of the Paulist Community; Father Hickey. from the Jesuit College;
Father Clancy, from the Dominican Church; int.- Rer, Arthur Hamra and Father
Dempsey, from the C nd Father <'ovle, from the Star of the Sea Church.
Thirty altar boys-, robed in purple cassocks and white surplices, attended mass
In the sanctuary. The acolytes who assisted the archbishop in the celebration of
mass were Thomas Bellew and John Curesy.
The entire high altar was decorated with golden colored flowers and rare ferns,
which with their glistening leaves stood out In bold relief against the dull white
background of the marble and affording a brilliant sight.
The decoration was arranged by Pedro Gome*, who had control of the entire ar
rangement of the preliminaries.
Thomas O'Connell was born twenty-eight years ago and since his birth has re-
Bided in this city most of his y,- ar s. It was while attending the Brothers' School
that he first expressed the desire to become a priest of the Catholic church and
a member of its clergy. At an early age he left the Bacred Heart College, where
he had been attending for three years, and matriculated at the Santa Clara college,
where he remained for several years. Upon the completion of his studies at Santa
Clara he was sent to Baltimore to complete his education and take a degree for tho
priesthood. His progress here was hindered by his continued Illness, and a rest and
cessation from hard study were declared necessary. Owing to his weak physical
condition he was delaj'ed two years in the taking of his degree.
Father O'Connell will say his first mass next Sunday morning at the Paullst
Church on California street. The privilege to celebrate the first mass at this church
has long been an expressed wish of the young priest, as to It cling many happy
recollections of his younger dayÃ. The mass will be Bald at 10:30 o'clock and in
character will be solemn high. The pennon of the mass will be preached by the
â Â»Â«v^ Peter Yorke on the appropriate subject of "The Young I'riesthood of To-day."
and note for $1000; to Geraldine Fitz
gerald, $5000; to McCoy and Sidney

ald of Eureka the residue.
The will was filed for probate by
Fitzgerald on July 1 of last year, but
on the 14th of the same month a con
test was filed by thÂ« stepdaughters of
the decedent, who had been practical
ly disinherited. On the same day the
contestants tiled another will bearing
date of March 13. 1897, and under its
I'll. visions they were named as the
principal legatees. The second will pro
vided for the distribution of the estate
as follows: Loretta Manion and Ray
mond Kearney, |3000 e-râ i: to all other
relations, except the stepdaughters, $1
each, and the bulk of the estate was
bequeathed to th> stepdaughters.
The original contest went to trial
several weeks ago. A vast amount of
ence was submitted to prove the
mental condition of the testator <it the
timr> h<> executed the last will, and also
ttablish his relationship with A. 1..
Fitzgerald. It was hinted at during the
trial that the d.cd. tit had been mur
:. and the famify skeleton of the
Capron family was well aired.
Joseph C. Campbell, chief counsel for
the contestants, 'â 'â  >sed the argument in
the i terday afternoon* -n>l it
was submitted. Judge Coffey instruct

only took thirty-five minutes to reach
a verdict, which was placed on n

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 15, 1898.
SCHOOL BOARD
LOSES A SUIT
G. O. Mitchell Was Ille
gally Removed From
His Position.
Judge Hunt Ru les That He Is
Vice-Principal of the Girls'
High School.
Writ of Mandate Issued to Compel the
Board of Education to Re
instate Him.
It was decided by Judpe Hunt yes
terday that George O. Mitchell was il
legally transferred from the Girls'
High School as its vice-principal to the
Polytechnic School, and he ordered
that a writ of mandate issue compell
ing the Board of Education to restore
him to his old position. This action
on the part of the court will to a cer
tain extent upset the little political
manipulation of the board, at least as
far as the appointment of Madison
Babcock to nil the position made va
cant by the transfer of Mite hell is con
cerned. In fact, it is hinted that it may
act as though a star was yanked out
of the solar system and result in a
startling- disorganisation of the plans
and fondest hopes of Director Ragan,
according to the theory of Director
Head, as published in Friday's Call.
Mitchell took his position as viee
principal of the Girls' High School on
the Ist of January, 1895. In July of last
) ear a resolution was passed by the
board transferring him from hia po-
D in the Girls' High School to one
of less honor and monthly remunera
tion in the Polytechnic School. He im
mediately demurred at the action of
the board and some time ago applied
to the courts for a writ of mandate
to compel the board to readmit him
to the vtee-piincipalshlp of the Girls'
High School and to allow him to again
assume the labors incumbent upon that
position. In his application for the
writ he contended that he held a high
1 certillcate as required and as
he had been duly appointed to the po
sition he should be allowed to hold It
as originally intended. The board con
tested his application and set up in de
fense that it had a right to transfer as
it saw lit.
The stand taken by the board Is er
roneous, it Is held by Judge Hunt. In
his interpretation of the law Judge
Hunt decided that after one is appoint
ed to a position in the School Depart
â¢ he cannot be transferred if the
transfer results In a decrease of salary

but for a material cause such as in
ability or offense, which in justice
should result in dismissal. In conse
quence. It was held that the conten
tion of Mltohell that he had been ille
gally removed was a Just one and the
writ of mandate was ordered issued.
The fight is not yet over, ho<Vever, as
th<' board will appeal to the Supreme
Court in ordc-r that its power in the
line of the caM at issue may be for
ever determined. Th-- attorney who

DESERTION TALE DENIED.
Henry hfart Says His Stepfather Is
iO Seattle on Business.
Friends of Henry Hart, the race track
bookmaker, have frequently made the
assertion of late that Jnhn R. Hart of
Alameda, formerly In the sailor boar.l-
lng-house business with William Mc-
Carthy, had not left home on account of
any trouble with his wife at all, but that
his Intention In fleeing was to avoid set
tling up finances with the stepson ac
wording to the terms of the wife's will.
This story is denied by the Interested
man. He also states that his stepfather
is now in Seattle, and will return home
in a few days.
"I expect a letter from him to-mor
row," be HfUd yesterday- "He went to
Seattle at my request, and I gave him
i>tt<rs of introduction to merchants of
Seattle and Victoria. The story that my
stepfather and myself have not got
along well 1b untrue. "We are both Inter
in a Klondike prlicmc, and the re
ci-nt salo of the property left us free to
act in the matter at one.:;.
"It is true, 1 suppose, that Mr. Hart
had some words with his wife, and that
may be the reason why he did not tell
her ho was going away. This is one of
the cases where a man has good cause to
call on heaven to deliver him out of the
hands of his friends."
LATER NEWS BETTER NEWS.
Damage to the Citrus Crop par
Less Than First Reported.
The southern citrus belt has come In
for a deal of commiseration recently,
anent the reports of heavy damage
wrought by the rude hand of Jack Frost
among the orange and lemon groves,
which are th 9 particular pride of that
section. There was a wide variance In
the report as to the extent of damage ef-
I, some rumors placing the damage
as high as 00 or GO per rent.
Later and more reliable advices go to
show that the worst afflicted localities
not suffered which win
amount to more than '-â¢> per rent of the
crop, and it is probable that when all rÂ«~
ports are lii ami carefully canvassed It
will be found that the general average of
damage will not be over 10 per cent.
The recent "cold snap" was the tm
verest known In ten years, and the won
der Is that It did no more damage than
it didâ in the citrus belts and elsewhere

ED STEVENS AS A HYPNOTIST.
One wouldn't expect a star comic opera singer to be c remamable hypnotist, to
have s-t range occult powers and to go about putting up his hand to heal the suffer
ing when he hail earned his salary by making a houÃefu* laugh, but San Francisco
has one.
Few who enjoy the tuneful mirth of Edwin Stevens at the Tlvoli know or would
suspect that ho was that Bort of a remarkable man, but he is. A host of the
friends and acquaintances he has made while pursuing his profession all over the
land know It. but Stevens' business is to sing and his strange power over others
has always been a private matter.
There is frequent fun back of the scenes at the Tivoli. when the girls say. "Oh.
Mr. Stevens! Pee If you can hypnotize us." and when after a word and a touch
they obey his orders for monkey shines, and flap their arms for angels' wings. But
Stevens doesn't do very much of the funny business that always goes with the
show hypnotist. Off the stage the fellow Is worked to death by acquaintances and
their friends who know of his remarkable power for banishing pain and healing
diseases. He now has about twenty cases in hand in this city wnlch he is treating
by "psyrho-therapeutics." some prominent local physicians are studying his powers
and methods and the pressure on his off hours is so great that he is seriously con
sidering the advice of one of his medical friends to open an office and be a profes
sional hypnotist by day and a singer by night.
There is much that is interesting about Stevens from the standpoint of occult
things and there are remarkable things that he does. This Jolly man of the world
has an eye that is strangely piercing when he concentrates his glance upon you,
and he has peculiar hands. The palms of his soft and shapely hands have an odd
redness about them, concentrated in spots and in the wrinkles, which are lines of
deep vermilion, and tho ends of all his fingers have a deep, â warm redness that is
always there. It is further peculiar that when he hypnotizes any one, a little b>
of perspiration always appears on a particular spot on each of the third and fourth
fingers of his l-:'t hand, and often his hands puff up as he sends a friend into som
nambulistic oblivion.
He discovered his latent hypnotic power when he was about 17 years old, and
shortly after his interest In it was deepened by reading Bulwer's "A Strange Story."
Since then ho has constantly practiced and developed it privately, and during the
years since be l"ft San Francisco, to return a successful star, it has grown with the
constant practice that has been forced upon him dally.
It sounds peculiar to hear Stevens can cure any ordinary headache in from one
to ten seconds by a touch or two of his soft, mysterious hand, but his friends tes
tify to the fact overwhelmingly. When an acquaintance has the frightful pains of
neuralgia or brings a friend who has he can generally get away with the neuralgia,
and toothaches flee from his fingers' ends.
This is not hypnotism, it is explained. This is simply the result of his mag
netism. He reserves his hypnotic treatments for more serious cases. Not long ago,
it is related, he went with a lady friend to a dentist's to save her the pains of
teeth-filling. "When she was rendered unconscious of pain after a few passes the
dentist put that horrible buzzing drill to work in a mf>lar. "Now you ure crossing a
bridge In Chicago," he said, "lla! Ha!" she laughed, delightedly.
Many of his friends have the same advantages when they get their teeth pulled
and bad cases of insomnia which give way to sweet and normal Bleep after a few'
trials of hypnotic suggestion are but among a long list of ner%-oua and functional
diseases that :ire credited to his occult mastery.
Mr. Stevens says little about his occult abilities and eschews the very word
"hypnotism" fur â¢'psycho-therapeutics," for his power to relieve suffering is some
thing he takes very seriously and conscientiously, and he thinks that charlatans
have made the . >rd "hypnotist" odious. So this popular and successful fellow goes
on making thous nds laugh from the comic stage and seriously brushing away pain
with that strange hand when the curtain Is down.
AN UNWILLING
TRIP HOMEWARD
Passengers Forcibly Taken
Away From the Land
of Gold.
The Steamship President Broke Her
Machinery end Could Not
Land at I'nnlakUk.
The steamship President, now lying In
San Francisco hmrbor, was attached yes
terday by a suit brought In the United
States District Court by eight passen
gers, who allege that they have been
damaged and Injured to the extent of
$2000 each by the action of the skipper.
Captain Nelson, In taking them from St.
Michael to San Francisco against their
will.
The llbeiants are Benjamin F. Gray,
Herbert Kendall, Anderson W. Meadows,
Augustus C Cube!, H^nry Peters. Krnest
Nuessler, Mrs. Jgna Nuessler (his wife)
and Arthur Paul. They tell a hard story
In their complaint and one which. If
true, places Skipper Nelson in a very un
favorable light.
They allege that on October I*.. ISCC,
while they were at the port of St. Mi
chael awaiting the opening of the sea
son for the transportation of themselves
and their stores to the Klondike mines
the steamship President was lying In the
harbor of St. Michael, seeking assistance
in order to enable her to discharge her
cargo. There was no available labor to
be hired at that place, and there was
therefore danger that the ship would be
frozen In during the winter. In this
emergency the complainants, being de
sirous of reaching certain gold diggings
near T'lialaklik, some forty miles to the
northward of St. Michael, agreed with
Skipper Nelson that they would dis
charge his vessel provided that lie would
give them passage thereon to Inalaklik,
they also to pay *!"> each In cash.
< in arriving at T'nalakllk six of the pas
sengers went on shore and made ar
rnngements to procure, a whaleboat to as
sist in transferring their stores to the
shore. After their return to the ship
that evening ar.d after a small quantity
of their stores had been landed by JnÂ»
dlans In skin boats. Skipper Nelson
hoisted his anchor and went a mile or
two out to sea, telling his passengers
that he would run in again In the morn
ing and land them and their stores. But
when morning came the skipper refused
to land his passengers and proceeded on
his way to San Francisco. He met all
their protests with profane and intem
perate language.
The complainants allege further that
owing to the crowded condition of the
st< unship and lack of preparation for
the voyage they were not given proper
aroomriii'dati'Mi and food, and they suf
fered great inconvenience on their en
forced voyage.
The captain's defense will be that the
machinery of the steamer broke so that
It was not possible for the vessel to re
main where she was without risk of
great damage, if not loss.

Fell Down a Hatchway.
John Buchanan, a negro pailor, fell
down the hatchway of the schooner
Henry B. Hyde at the Folaom-street
wharf last evening and was quite seri
ously, though not fatally injured. Ho wag
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
where he was attended by Dr. Deas, who
found that thr-e ribs were broken, the
scalp lacerated and internal injuries.
Buchanan was loading lumber onto the
schooner, and he fell about twenty feet.
COULDN'T SAVE
HER BROTHER
Henry Harris Cut His Throat
in the Presence of His
Devoted Sister.
He Had Lost a Leg and Preferred
Death to Being Crippled
for Life.
A horrible suicide of a brother In the
presence of his devoted sister took place
at IJIO Buchanan street yesterday after
noon.
The unfortunate man was Henry Har
ris, who recently worked as a porter In
the hat factory of P. Berwin In this city.
Owing to the loss of a leg in a railroad
accident and the consequent illness Har
ris became very despondent and frequent
ly threatened to commit suicide. For this
reason his mother and his sister. Minnie,
who have been taking care of him, have
kept a close watch upon his movements.
Shortly after noon yesterday Miss Min
nie returned to her brother's room from
another part of the house, and when she
entered the apartment she was terror
stricken on beholding her brother with a
razor In his hand and In the act of draw
ing it across his throat.
With B wild shriek of horror she rushed
forward to wrest the weapon from the
suicide's grasp, but before she could
reach him he had cut a fearful gash in
his throat. She seized the razor and
struggled desperately with him for the
p. iss.-ssion of the weapon, and received
several severe cuts in the hand. But the
devoted girl was too late. The struggle
was brief and at the end of a few agoniz
ing seconds, when she had gained pos
session of the razor, her brother died.
The remains were taken to the Morgue,
and an Inquest will be held.
Harris was a native of this State and
34 years old. About the first of last De
cember he was thrown off a train of cars
near San Rafael and was run over. He
was taken to the German Hospital In
this city and one of his legs was ampu
tated. During the consequent sickness,
although tenderly cared for by his mother
and sister, he became very despondent
over the prospect of being a cripple for
life, and frequently threatened to make
away with himself.

HIBERNIAN CONVENTION TO-DAY
The "Board of Erir/* Will Probably
Be Allowed to Die.
At Vallejo to-day will be held a special
State convention of the A. O. EL Board
of Erin. The main object of the meeting
will t.c t<> consider the report of a com
mittee appointed to formulate a plan for
amalgamation of the organization with
the A. O. H. <-f America,
The Ancient Order of Hibernians'
Board of Erin, as the order Is styled, is
open for membership only to people born
in Ireland, and it goes without saying
that in time it would naturally "die out"
anyway. Furthermore, there is a grow
ing feeling In the membership that the
order is un-American and it is thought
i" be time for its discontinuance.
The plan of amalgamation above re
ferred to is the suggestion of Bishop
Mi S.n-.l of Trenton, N. J.. to whom the
ization appealed for ailviie in its
:.try. It is thought that the propo
sition will be readily accepted by the
<i< legates to all the State conventions of
the order and that the union with the
larger and more powerful organization
will be effected without serious opposi
tion.

of first revolving no less than $123. â

CYCLING CLUB
MEN ARE
BASEBALL FANS.
The bringing together of the cycling
and baseball sports has aroused intense
interest in wheeling circles. Such old
stand-by wheel enthusiasts as Judge Ker
rigan, Charley Adams, Plummer, Sheldon,
Stratton, Hadenfeldt. Wetmore. Wynne,
Swain. Coffroth, Egan and many others
prominent in the C. A. C. C, have devel
oped into baseball fanatics of the pro
nounced type. They have not missed a
game of the cycle series so far, and de
clare they never will.
The second series of games under the
Cycle Baseball League will be played
to-morrow, the following teams being
scheduled to play: Reliance Club Wheel
men vs. Olympic Club Wheelmen; Turn
Verein Cyclers vs. Bay City Wheelmen;
Olympic Cyclers vs. Acme Club Wheel
men.
The Bay Citys and Turn Vereins will
play at Centerville. The latter club will
come up from San Jose, and the Bay
Citys will go down on the S:3O a. m. broad
gauge boat, Captain Larkin having called
a club run for the occasion, thus carry
ing out the spirit of the league, which
is to foster interest in country runs. The
Bay City ball team will go to Newark on
the 8:16 narrow gauge boat, and wheel
from there to Centerville.
The Reliance-Olympic Wheelmen and
Acme-Olympic Cyclers games will be
played at the Velodrome grounds, the
former at 2:30 p. m.. and the latter at
12 o'clock noon. Both are expected to
attract a large crowd of "rooters." as
there is considerable club rivalry between
the teams.

Three Gallant Boys Thrashed tho

Three messenger boys who work In
the Western Unton Telegraph office on

performed a gallant act a few nights
ago, when they drubbed a ruffian who
had insulted a lady at the crossing op
posite the office.
The victim of the insult is herself a
Western Union operator, and was on
her way to take the last Valencia street
car when accosted by the man. Fear
ins for her safety she went to the office
opposite Montgomery street, and asked
the service of a messenger to escort her
to her car.
After she had left the office with the
boy the other attaches learned of the
difficulty, and three of the youngsters.
none over M years of age. started out
to investigate. They found the loafer
standing on the ec-rner. and promptly
attacked him. Finding himself out
numbered, the fellow took to his heels
and ran down Second street to Mission,
where he was overtaken by the three
messengers and hammered into a state
of complete subjection.
The boys modestly decline to tell any
thing of their adventure as knight er
rants, except by significant winks, and
the fair c-perator has not been bothered
since.

teresting issue. The Rev. Edwards Davis
is the individual discussed in the "Plain

raignment of that ministerial gentleman
is caustic in the extreme. A leading
article on the lack of proper coast de

music, financial, personalities, theatrical,

ordinarily cleverly written. The cai
features are good, particularly the one
suggesting a triumphal arch to "be erected

in fact any oneâ will find much entertain

February.
Sharkey and Jeffries Will Not
Meet and George Green
Is Matchless,
Chinese May Bury Their Dead in the
City Cemetery Until the First
of April.
Tho Health and Folice Committee of
the Board of Supervisors had a lively
time yesterday with boxing and burial
permits. Several clubs that have ar
ranged fights for the near future were
applicants for permission, but all were
refused to hold their entertainments
during the present month and the next.
The National Club had arranged for
a match between Bharkey, the pride of
the navy, and Jeffries, the Los An
geles giant, for a date during this
month, and had a representative at
the meeting of the committee.
It was decided, however, to shut off
all permits for January, and i
quently the two knights of the fistic
art will not meet In the roped arena.
The tal Clv)) was also an ap
plicant for a permit, having arranged to

The Chinese, who have been unable
so far to secure a burial ground out
side the city limits, induced the com
mittee yesterday to extend the prohi
bition against burials in the City Cem
etery until April 1.
It was represented to the committee
tt would be unjust to compel the
-â â¢cure n burial
ground at short notice, and t!
â â¢ere allowed time they would be
willing to forego any further burials
within the city limits.
The committee took the ground that
It would be unwise and unjust to
force the matter arbitrarily, and 11
finally decided to grant the request of
extension.
It is expected that a vigorous pro
test will be filed by the Richmond res
idents when the matter comes I
the full board, and that Mayor Phelan
w-ill veto the measure if it comes with
in his province to do so.

A CONVICT VERBALLY ASSAILS A JURIST.
"Thanks' Once a man; twice a child.
You're a child. It's a pity you could
not have given judgment of death. How
I would like to hit that old !"
These words, uttered with Vicious em
phasis by William Clayton, a convicted
robber, and directed to Judge Wallace,
who was seated on the bench in his
courtroom, followed a minute later by
a d< -operate attempt on the part of the
prisoner to hurl a pair of heavy steel
handcuffs at the venerable head of the
jurist, caused several minutes of wild
excitement yesterday morning. Clay
ton was up before Judge Wallace for
sentence, and the court had just con
cluded bis words which will place the
robber in Fotoona prison for life, when
he dramatically hurled a slur at the
gray hairs of the Judge and attempted
to follow it with the handcuffs.
The prisoner was arrested in August
of last year for having, in company
with William Price, robbed L. J-
Knight, who resides at 707 Mission
street, of a watch and chain. It was at
9:30 in the morning wh^n the robbery
took place. Knight was in his bed
asleep when he was awakened by loud
rapping on his door. He asked who
was there, but before he could rise and
open the door it was broken open and
three men rushed in. One of them
every resident in tho vicinity, irrespec
tive of property holding, was admitted.
This condition of representation was
found to be unwieldy and unprofitable so
far as the Polk street club was con
cerned, hence It was decided to change
from a representative membership to
one of purely business, or in other words,
merchants will be the only constituents.
By this means it is considered by those
getting the club up on the new basis
that the members will have the co-oper
ation of the Merchants' Association be
hind them in pushing any movement ad
vocated for the betterment of that sec
tion of the city.
Since Van Ness avenue has been de
clared a boulevard the business on Polk
street is bo hemmed in that the traffic
from the western part of the city as also
the northern Bide is circumscribed by
metes and bounds not. as they consider,
In keeping with the spirit of progress.
To remedy this condition it is proposed
to cut the hogsback on Polk street and
thereby give a direct outlet to the north
ern part of the city and more directly
to the wholesale part of the city front.
Since Bay street has been graded and
paved from Jones to Van Ness avenue
a direct and short route is made prac
ticable from Polk street to water front
as soon as the cut Is made. Litigation
in the Fair estate has kept the work
behind up to the present time, but a.s
soon as the Merchants' Club gets fairly
started the contractor for cutting day
light through Polk street will be noti
fied to proc< ed
The club which is about to ha rpvived
on this new basis is one of the first of
its kind started in this city, and from
it all the other improvement clubs took
their cue in Illuminating the streets by
electric lamps swung over the center of
the street.
A SOLDIER'S WIFE
PASSES AWAY
Mrs. Brigadier-General Shafter
Died Yesterday at
Fort Mason.
Stricken With Paralysis a Few Days
Ago While Attending a Cen
tury Club Meeting-
Mrs. W. R. Shatter, wife of Brigadler
â  â  a Shatter, commander of the De
partment of California, died yesterday at
her home at Fort Mason. Tho cause of
death was paralysis. The decease/! was
taken ill on Wednesday on lea\ I
ng of the Century Club, of which
she was a member, and she gradually
sank until death came.
About two years ago Mrs. Shaftor was
taken 111 with the B Be and for
a time her life was despaired of, but she
slowly recovered, and it was thought all
danger from the <lrÂ«;ul disease had
passed. She enjoyed the i>'-st of health
for months afterward ami the c >n.l at
tack came on suddenly and unexpectedly.
She fell to the sidewalk a moment after
she left the meeting of the club and did
not regain consciousness. Mrs. 8 i
was the mother of Mrs. AY. H. McKlt
tri k of rtakersfield.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
afternoon a.t 2 o'clock. The services will

bins, D.D., and Chaplain Macondray of
Angel Island. The interment will be in
the National Cemetery at the Presidio.

hurled him back on the bed and pre
vented him from shouting, while the
others went through his clothes and
relieved him of his property. The rob
bers then made their escape.
Subsequently Price and Clayton were
arrested for the crime, and as the case
against them was strong, Price, rather
than stand trial, pleaded guilty to a
charge of grand larceny. He was later
sentenced to ten years in prison. Clay
ton, however, refused to plead guilty,
and went to trial. On his arraignment
Clayton admitted a prior conviction on
a charge of petty larceny, which was a
very rash step, as this assured him
life imprisonment in event of his con
viction on the charge of robbery
against him, and then he realized the
seriousness of his mistake in admitting
a prior conviction. When he appeared
for sentence yesterday morning his at
torney asked the court to allow the
prisoner to withdraw his admission of
a prior offense. Judge Wallace denied
the request. Then the trembling pris
oner, in hopes the court would recon
sider his request, stated that no wea
pon was used in the commission of the
robbery.
"I cannot help how the crime was
committed," said the court. "The crime
is one of robbery, and as there is a

GUNS WILL GREET
THE JUBILEE SUN.
The boom of heavy guns will herald
i the rising of the Jubilee sun. From
I every fort and battery around the bay
: of San Francisco the roar and smoke
: of cannon will greet the opening of the
! great day. Orders have been issued
; that a national salute of twenty-one
guns must come from every military
post about the harbor, and the red
i beams cutting the sky over the Oak
i land hills will be welcomed with such
! a medley of fire, smoke and thunder as
I has not been heard on the peaceful wa
itrs of the bay for many years. The
salute has been ordered for sunrise, and
right martially will it usher in the fes
tal day.
It was and still Is the intention to
have an exhibition of heavy artillery
! practice, but it will depend on the
amourtt of money cm hand, and at pres
ent the prospects for such an event are
not brilliant. It is twenty-one years
I since a public exhibition of what the
harbor defense guns are capable of do
ing was given, and the plan to put the
big batteries in play will not be drop
ped unless under compulsion. The nec
essary permission from the War De
partment has been obtained, and the
lack of funds is the only difficulty.
The day will close with a grand ball
given by the Native Sons of Pacific
Parlor In Native Sons' Hall. Tho grand
march will be ordered for a quarter to
? o'clock, and when it will end is a
question only to be solved by those
who have to leave. All the grand offi
cers of the order will be present, and
the whole affair will be one of the most
; brilliant events of the Jubilee week.
| The Governor, too. has given notice
that this morning the proclamation de
claring January 24 a legal holiday will
be issued, and with that assured the
success of the day is made certain.
For the first time in the history of
the State The regulars and the miii
i tia men will meet in friendly rivalry,
ii"t on the parade ground, but on the
athletic field. There has been a grow
ing interest taken in the athletic con
tests at the Presidio, and for an event
of the week of festivities it has been
: decided to bring the amateur and the
professional soldier together for honor
and glory and incidentally some prizes
of considerable value. The events in
which the citizen soldiery will take part
I will include football and baseball
mutches and a tug-of-war. Teams for
these are already in active practice;
they will also enter the runs and
sprints, the military events whenever
possible and the militia troopers may
! even enter against their hardened ad
versaries of the yellow strip, s and
plumes and risk life and limb In their
endeavor to demonstrate their own pro
ficiency.
The flower show, too, Is now almost
assured. Yesterday afternoon the
- in whose charge the affair had
been lefi appeared before the
Floral Society and asked for the sap
port of the individual members. It was
freely granted and before the meeting
adjourned the flower society was near
ly as enthusiastic over the project as
the California Club.
The ladies stated that the hardesi
part of the undertaking had been ac
complished inasmuch as they had se
cured the permission of the Supervi
sors to use Union Square and Mayor
prior conviction against you I have no
alternative but to order that you be
imprisoned in the State Prison at Fol-
BOm for the term of your natural life."
The convict lowered his brows and
grasped the rail of the dock, for an In
stant unnerved. Then with delibera
tion, his voice ringing in anger, he
said:
"Thanks! Once a man; twice a
child. You're a child. It's a pity you
could not have given judgment of
death. How I would like to hit that
old 's head:"
Judge Wallace made no answer, and
Bailiff Curtis ordered the prisoner
within the dock. Clayton turned and
saw the handcuffs. Quick as a flash
he grasped them, but before he could
hurl them at the object of his hatred
he was seized by CurtiÃ and disarmed.
"You can't do that here," paid the
bailiff, as he forcibly placed the hand
cuffs on the wrists of the prisoner.
As he was led from the room the
criminal turned to Curtis and said
"lf it hadn't been for you I'd have laid
him out sure."
This closed the exciting episode and
the courtroom frequenters who haunt
the criminal departments in morbid
curiosity felt that they had been re
warded for the time expended within
the walls of the criminal courtroom.
Phelan promised them that the booths
should be covered over with canvas in
sections 100 by 225 feet.
They intended to invite all the florists
to take part. No rent will be charged
for the space and no commission asked;
all the florists will have to do is to
bring their flowers and sell them and
any money realized In this manner will
go to the florists themselves.
Three prizes will also be offered to
the florist or florists who have the larg
est exhibit. The first will be $50, the
second $30 and the fourth $20; diplomas
may also be given.
The Native Daughters met in the
headquarters last night and discussed
plans for the Native Daughters' ban
quet, which will be held on Native
Daughters' Day. It was decided that
the tables would be spread in the ban
quet room of the Native Sons' Hall and
the reception would be held in the main
hall.
The Pan Francisco Scheutzen Verein
also held a meeting, and appointed H.
M. Wreden and E. Algeltinger aids to
the grand marshal: W. Gams Jr. and
John Lankenau were appointed special
aids of the division. The Verein will
turn out 160 strong, and all will b* in
the distinctive uniform of the organ
isation. As the Verein is the oldest
German society in the city, it will have
the head of the division of German or

of Lieutenant G F. Seitz as an escort

The Master Plumbers have announc

the design of which is as yet shrouded
in mystery.
The Associated Veterans of the Mexi

A Promising Commonwealth.
Rabbi Voorsanger, in his I- -ture last
night. ref.-rred to I â¢â¢ Jubil. â¢â¢ and t"
dfie of the causes Which has made it
blfc The city and State, he said,
is approaching a season of celebration
Â«rf which it may well be proud, and
then, in analyzing the growth of the
city and State to its present position,
where such a celebration may be plan
ned and executed, he cited as the pri
mary factor the tide of immigration
which had swep4 westward to the
shores of the Pacific.
Immigration, he said, is governed
first by the law of necessity, and then
by the search for gain, and then with
this as his theme he described the mi
grations of the tril â¢ i \^i a in the
Biblical ages, and of the nations of Eu
rope and Northern Africa describing
the effect on civilisation of each and
telling: the causes which drove them to
wander.
The great tide of immigration to this
country began in IS4R. he said and
from then to the present the march of
civilization here had been as great as
that of Europe had been in centuries
The search for new fields was one rea
son for this, he continue.], and thtÂ» dia
cover? of gold was another. These had
brought to these shores a tide of popu
lation which had made this "one of the
most promising commonwealths it has
pleased God to call into existence."

Robert D. Hagerty of the Golden Gate
Villa, Ocean Beach, swore to a complaint
in Judge Conlan's court yesterday for the
arrest of Frederick S. Adams Jr. of Oak
land on a charge of defrauding an Inn
keeper.
Hagerty declares that Adams stopped kt
his resort for several weeks, during which
he ran up a bill amounting to $470. It in
cluded wine for his laay visitors and him
self, borrowed money and the feed and
care for his horses. Adams gave Hagerty
some diamonds as collateral security, and
on December 6, when he left the resort,
he got back his diamonds and gave Hag
erty instead a check for $470 on the Tal
lant Bank. The tueck was presented at
the bank, but was dishonored, as Adams
had no account there, and since then
Hagerty has been trying to get Adams to
pay him the amount.
Hagerty stated that he will swear to
another complaint to-day charging
Adams with passing a fictitious check.
Adams about two years ;iro came into
a fortune of STiO.OOO, on the death of his
father, and since, then he has been going

and had to pay the divorcee $5000.
NELLIE McHENRY
IN A NEW ROLE
Sings in the Streets of New Or
leans, Cleveland and
Denver.
Stopped the Cotton Market and Goj
Ten Dollars From
Hanna.
Nellie McHenry, the popular burlesque
and farce comedienne, has a new role in
her already extensive repertoire. She has
tried it in New Orleans, Cleveland and
Denver with unusual success, and hopes
to again play it in any city, town or
hamh-t that may need her assistance.
It is an original and novel role, and
although the work of no famous play
wright, it has attracted immense audi
ences. Miss McHenry has not only cre
sted but is responsible for the existence
of the new character. The part requires
no elaborate mlse-en-Bcenes, just a
streetâ a real, live streetâ a sympathetic
gathering, a hat and the actress herself,
singing merry. Jolly songs as only she can
sing them, and a deserving charity to
relieve her of the proceeds.
Miss McHonry first tried her new role
in the Cotton Exchange at New Orleans.
She sang "Isabella" with such chic that
the brokers neglected the business in
hand, the market was stopped anu the
city's poor were richer by a round (1000.
In Cleveland Miss McHenry repeated the
role with equal success and scored the
greatest triumph by gathering in her
ample hat a crisp $10 from the great
Hanna. On New Year's eve Miss Mc-
Henry repeated the successful undertak
ing in Denver and reaped a harvest oÂ£
MOO.
of all the roles she has played. Miss
McHenry declares she has come to line
this one the best.
"It was a novel and altogether delight
ful experience.' 1 she said, "and the j>u.,r
have profited by it. So have I. I nave
learned new ways to conduct such a show.
and hope the next time 1 give the part
to gain more than the largest receipts
any -house has ever held."
Miss McHenry's limited engagement in
this city has prevented her appearing In
the fetching role here and coaxlni
dollars from the pot kets of the rich for
the benefit of the poor. But it Hpr i
ble that she will find opportunities for a
production In some other California city.

Blood Poisoned.
FEARFUL RESULT OF IMPROPERLY
TREATING AN ABSCESS.

fully Afflicted From a Complica

markable Fortitude.
From the Chieftain, PoeMo, Col.
The hurry and hustle of the. housewife
is extremely wearing upon the delicate
organism of womanhood. Her intense
earnestness in whatever she undertake*
tempts her constantly to go beyond her
strength.
Read the story of a Colorado woman as
told to our reporter: "Eight years ago,"
said she, "my husband died and I was
left with three children to care for and
educate. About two years ago I was very
sick with blood poisoning, caused by an
abscess that had not received proper
treatment. The disease for a time set
tled in my throat, causing me intense ag
ony. Then inflammatory rheumatism set
in. For four months and a half I was a
prisoner in my room. Most of the time
confined to my bed. My hands were swol
len so that I could not feed myself, and
the swelling in my feot nnd ankles would
have made walking impossible if I had
been strong enough.
"One day, after considerable treat
ment, my physician brought me a box of
pills.
" "You need a tonic,' he said, 'and
something that will act at once, and
this is the best medicine I know of for
that purpose.'
" 'Pills,' I exclaimed in surprise as he
opened the box and showed me the little
pink globes. 'These are Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills for Pale People.'
" 'YeÃ,' he replied, 'but you ru>ed not
be alarmed, they are not physic, and my
word for it, they'll do you good.'
"Before I had been taking them a week
I noticed a great improvement in my
condition. Soon my rheumatism was
poiie I grf.w stronger each day, and now
am In th> best of health."
The lady was Mrs. L. E. Browning of
115* East Fourth street. Pueblo, Colo.
"1 consider Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
Pale People," she continued, "the best
tonic I have ever known.
"A friend not long ago was telling me
of her mother, who is at a critical period
in her life. She had been subject to ter
rible fainting spells, and the whole fami
ly would work over her. l>r. Williams'
Pink Pills have not only stopped the
fainting spells, but given her so much
strength that she Is able to take up life's
duties again.
"I recommended the pills also to a
young lady, whose pale face made one
pity her. She looked as if there wasn't
a drop of blood in her body. She was t i
weak that she was not able to attend
school, but after taking Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills for a while she has gone back
to school, and. with her rosy cheeks and
bright eyes, she looks like another :<iri.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 14.â The course of to
day's stock market was decidedly irregular and
somewhat perplexing so far as a perception of
the general tone of speculation was concerned.
As the day progressed the lack of sustaining
power in the strength of special stocks which
has been the marked characteristic of the mar
ket for several days past came to be more and
more felt. The disposition to watch closely for
pigns of a reaction became more marked and
the final hour saw a very general throwing
over of holdings by professional trader*. There
was no special news to account for the break,
and it was probably due for the most part to
technical conditions. Stocks which have been
recently prominent for strength were con
spicuous in to-day's break by reason of profit
taking. ' There was a feeling of more or less
uneasiness also over the tone of the news from
Havana in regard to what is expected rather
than what has happened. The fear that the
Spanish Government's scheme of reform is on
the point of breaking down is coupled with the
apprehension that the time is imminent when
intervention by the United States to save the
Island from anarchy will be imperative. The
persistence of Sugar, a more or less dominant,
factor by reason of the volume of trading In It.
also helped to break the market. There was a
good foreign demand and commission house
orders, especially for investment demand In the
gilt-edged railroad stocks. The Vanderbilts,
â¢ Union Pacific anil the Northern Pacific stocks
were not lacking in continued strength, but
the profit taking invited by the advances In
special cases only served to Increase the late
weakness of stocks which had failed to benefit
from the early strength. Covering by shorts
served to relieve part of the decline, but net
losses of a point or over are frequent all
' through the list. Money tried to become some
.â what easier. to-day without any actual change
made in the posted rates for call loans. There
was a brisk demand, however, for commercial
paper, which drove the rates down to a ran^e
of 3 to 4 per cent for the choice grades. To
morrow's bank statement will show . a large
Increase in the holdings.
. The bond market was active early In the day,
but became less active and reacted slightly
In the later dealings. Union Pacific and con
necting lines issues were strong. Seattle, Lake
Shore and Eastern firsts trust receipts rose
VA per cent, but lost part of that. Other ac
tive issues showed gains. Total sales, $4,260.

LONDON MARKETS. .
i NEW YORK. Jan. 14.â Evening Port's
London financial cablegram: After a quiet
and dull opening, the stock markets were gen
j erally good to-day, a flllp being given by the
collapse of the engineering strike and the
declaration of a good dividend by a leading
English railway company. A feature continues
to be Argentines, which are booming. Kaffirs
were dull after a period of firmness. The pub
lic still refrain from dealing In American Sugar
and the outlook here In that depart
ment is distinctly favorable. There are signs
that on realizations old holding* are steadily
decreasing, while the professional buying is of
a strong kind. New York Centrals were es
pecially good. Bonds are steadily absorbed.
. The supply Is scarce and if the New York sup-
I port continues an actual boom is not Improb
able.
Grand -Trunks and Canadian Pacifies again
rose sharply.
The new Indian currency measure will be
come operative on the 21st lnst. It will con
tinue for six months.
Gold is In good demand. ! Over Â£1.000,000
is on the way here, but It will all go to the
Continent.
Discount houses have lowered th.Mr deposit
rates to-day M per cent. The excessive ease
in money, however, was much In evidence.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 14.â 1n Wheat the Liverpool |
market showed an opening Hd decline, but be
tore business commenced here It showed i^d
'. advance over yesterday's price. That started
j prices here at an advance of VI to %d, and
as later cablegrams, reported continued firmness
i at Liverpool the price here kept creeping up i
| by small fractions during the first hour and a
, half. News from Argentine was not so bear- ;
ish as yesterday and the lessening of that j
i pressure was of course felt. Private cable- I
grams from Liverpool Bald that Argentine of- !
' ferings were decreasing and that market was
firmer. The market had a good deal of en- '
couragement from the liberal exports and ruled ,
strong until the receipt of the closing cables, i
after which time an easier feeling prevailed.
Liverpool maintained Its early strength, but
Paris noteO a decline In Wheat equal to lÂ»ic
i per bushel for January and Antwerp reported
2c per bushel decline In both red winter and
Walla Walla. Letter brokers sold Wheat
when "call" price was reached, which Ftarted
â  liquidation from other sources, and in the laM
ten minutes of the session the market was very
weak. May finally sold down to 90VÂ»c, and was
\ at that price at the close. It was reported
after the close that vessel room had been char
! tered for a million bushels of Wheat Cor Lclter.
Trad? In the Corn pit was very light. The
Close was unchanged.
Oats were quiet. May closing unchanged.
Provisions were, enlivened by enormous sell
: Ing, supposed to be for a Cleveland plunger.
The market, however, absorbed the offerings
with ease, and though prices yielded some for

covered. At the close May Pork wits 2Â»4'??50

provisions being shown both for December and
the cai'-ndar year.
The recent foiling off In wheat exports prove,,
I as was indlca'ed last week in Bradatreet'S, to
have been due to the usual holiday quiet and
not to any falling off of demand from abroad.
The total exports of wheat iflour ir,
from the United States and I'anada for this
â¢reek amounted to 5,135.160 bushels, against
1,481 006 lushels last week and 5.M8.000 bushels

FINANCIAL ItEVIEW.
NTW YORK. Jan. 14.â Rradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Roth speru
lation and investments have h.-en active dur
ing the past week. The best feature of the
market has been the very heavy dealings In
bonds at generally higher prices, both for the
hlph grade and new and more speculative
Maaaes. Transactions, rising as they have to
$34,000,000 or $35,000,000 of bonds on the Stock
Kxchange, with the trading distributed amnns
an unusually large number of different issues.
would indicate a large demand for Investments
and the growth Of ennfidence in regard tr. the
position and future of the market. The stock
list a!so displayed a marked Increase in the
volume of dealings, with an advancing ten
dency. There has been considerable specula
tive manipulation, hut the. purchasing of stocks
by commission botMMS was a feature, and
though London has shown a disposition to sell,
buying by Germaxi Interests In this market
was considerable. Professionals have realized
from time to time in expectation ut a reduc
tion. lÂ«ut were to some extent constrained to
g'-t back stocks at high figures. The first
serious interruption to the bullish tendencies
was on Thursday, when reports Indicating that
trouble with Spain mipht result from a riot In
Havana caused selling of long stock, though
the market rallied when such fears were
shown to be unfoun leil
The strength of the list generally was ma
terially affected by the decline tn American
Supar Refining, due to the announcement male
at its annual meeting that the company's sur
plus wuuld not be distributer] as extra dlvl
dends. The Industrial stocks were in part
neglected and the bullish demonstrations and
activity centered In railroad shnrrs, the Tn
ciflc croup, the local traction shares and the
Vanderhilts taking the most prominent place.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NKW YORK. Jan. 14.â R. O. Dun & Cn â â
Weekly Review of Trade will say In its issue
f.-morrow: The year opened with very satis
factory prospects. It Is all the better that
there Is no wild excitement In the speculative
markets nml while storks advance a little,
praln yields a little. The payments through
principal clearing houses, notwithstanding a
decrease at New York, owing to less activity
in blocks, are 2.6 per cent larger than In IMS.
and 10. 1 per cent larger outside {few York.
Earnings of all railroads in the t'nlted States
reporting for December. $48,364,279, Indicate
substantially the same rate of increase, ex
ceedlng last year's by 10 I per cent, and the
earnings of lÂ£t! f or the same roads by 1.3 per

prosperous year thus far. comparisons indi
cate, notwithstanding the lowest prices ever
known, that the volume of buslenss le larger
and. in spite of some cutting of rates, the
earnings of railroads arÂ« larger than In the
best year of past history
The wheat market has been curiously lansruid,
yielding V;c, alth>u B !i Atlantic exports amount
ed to 6,066,788 b ishels for th-Â» two weeks of
January, against 3 SSfl 317 last year, and Pa
cific exports for th. weak have been 1
bushels. Western receipts continue ho heavy
that with the greatest accumulation of wheat
at i'h!rago ever known, there is little encour
agement for speculation Receipts were
2KO bushels for the two weeks, against 3.095.-
M bushels lost year.
The Iron furnaces during the current month
report an output of 226 Â£0S tons weekly, against
226.024 weekly December i with an increase of
12.481 tons in the unsold' stocks held by fur
naces. The Pennsylvania road has ordered
100,000 tons of steel rails and a new railroad in
Maine 12.000 tons, and othT orders for cars,
railroad supplies, plates, bars and structural
material are unusually large lor the season.
The woolen manufacturers have been buying
w... 1 largely, an i for reasons not publicly ex
plained. It is evident that large orders have
been taken by the leading mills at prices which
they find satisfactory and the rush of small
mills to buy wool has ma I" most ol the market
ilurlnc the past week, although sales have de
clined al...ut M ):-r oent compared with the pre
vious w.-.-k. Hut there Is decidedly better de
mand for men's wear goods and the makers
look f.-rwar.i t. h good demand soon. The
cotton manufacturers have been overloading by
excessive production and find no Increase In
demand and no gain in prices.
Failures for the past week have been 34? In
the United States against 45f, last year, and
45 In Canada against 71 last yrar.

DEMAND FOR CALIFORNIA PRUNES.
NEW YORK. Jan. 14.â The San Francisco
Journal of Commerce says: Among dried
fruits prunes 5 ... n) to be In an Interesting con
dition. "While the output of the season of 1597
was larger, according to report, than in any
previous year Flnce the California product t*>
came a fnctnr In home and foreign markets,
the demand seems to have Increased in even
greater ratio. With the best season of con
sumption In domestic markets still ahead, an 1
with a steadily Increasing export outlet, the
holders' views are hardening. I*rlc*s are on
the average Â»;?<Kc higher than at the end of
December. Th* demand from both home and
export buyers runs chiefly to sizes of M to the
pound ami above, and as there Is very little
fruit of this sire obtainable, either here or
on the coast, holders have no difficulty In ob
taining full prices or slight advance over
previous figures. There is also a scarcity of
sizes from <â¢<.â * to 110"s. and as there is a de
mpnd for these the feeling Is firmer. Since
the beginning of the week. It Is reported, some
ten or twelve sirs, spot and to arrive, have
been parch by local Jobbers, but particu
lars have not been mode public.

Since writing the last letter from Pon

the Buk missionaries were left on shore

After leaving Jaluit we sailed to the

of last month. From there we \\-nt t<>
Namarik, then on to Ailiang-lapalajs. At
this | i over Sunday. We
arrived at Wattho on Monday morning at
9:30. This island is the most north. rnly
station in the work and has only about
fifty adults and very few children. The
next evening we left for Ujae.
At this place we were invited to at
a "big fish." so after BUpper four
or five of us went ashore. As soon as
the moon was up they ithe natives who
to draw the net) went out on the
to a point whrr.- a school of lish
had been found and then began to let
out the net. which consisted simply of
leaves rpalm) tied together. The fish were
soon surrounded and then the net and
all was dragged to a shallow spot and
the fun began for the natives. I shall
not attempt to describe this event until
I reach h<>me. will only say that it was
intensely interesting for us as on-look

You may not believe me. yet it is the
simple truth when I say thai

FROM THE RIVALS' CAMP.
Washington Parties Come to This
City to Outfit for Klondike-
Secretary Carman is expected back to
the city -within a few days, and the work
at the rooms of the Alaska Trade Com
mittee will be pushed to the utmost,
Preparations are being made to thor
oughly bill and post ail the
mining towns. as the letters and
inquiries received every day con
vince the committee that it is very im
portant that this should be done, i,arge
quantities are being sent daily through
the mail, but it is found inadequate, and
the committee proposes to reach every
person who intends going, WAetac-r >... -
ing for information or nut.
Parties called yesterday who represented
others who are about tO leave for Alaska
from Alabama. North Carolina, New Jer
sey, Connecticut, Massachusetts. New
Hampshire. Illinois, lowa and Missouri.
A visitor, representing a party of ten from
Pennsylvania, said that the men of whom
he was the forerunner would arrive in
San Francisco next month and would
purchase their entire outfits here. It is
their present plan to sail from here so as
to reach Southern Alaska about March L
One party of fifteen which has decided
to go to the Klondike has written to the
Alaska Trade Committee that it intends
outfitting from San Francisco and taking
steamer here. Strange as it may seem,
this party hails from an Inland town in
the State of Washington, but it Intimates
that it will find it very much to Its ad
vantage to come to this city to make its
purchase of supplies and to take passage
for the north.
The executive committee of the Alaska
trade committee will hold an important
meeting this morning at 10 o'clock at
the Ferry building.
It has been suggested that the commit
tee should keep standing advertisements
in a number of the large papers of the
East and South, setting forth in full the
character of the work the committee has
undertaken, so as to direct inquiries of
Klondike travelers to , the central office
of the committee in this city. Up to the
present time nothing of tins sort baa been
done and the only outside advertisement
which the Alaska Trade Uureau has had
has been through the news columns of the
newspapers and the sending of the special
ar with an exhibit to Chicago. In this
way tens of thousands of copies of maps
and advertising circulars have been dis
tributed by mall and hundreds of copies
every day handed to visitors over the
counter of the bureau. It is thought that
â >â .â  keeping standing advertisements in
Eastern papers a large number of per
sons would be informed of the work
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JAXFAEY 15, 189 S.
which is being done to put before the
world the resource* of San Francisco as
an outfitting and shipping point for
Alaska travelers, and the preater part
of these would be persons who had not
heard, except in an indirect way, of the
advantages of coming to this city on their
way to Alaska. TO undertake this ad
vertising the committee will probably
need additional funds, but it feela th;i"t
the result will be bo satisfactory that
the Investment will pay many times over.
The crowds at the bureau seem to be
paining in numbers from day to day and
the inquiries received by mail are con
stantly increasing. A large party, which
is preparing to leave for Alaska, has
written from Wyoming that it will come
this way. Another party has been heard
from in Washington, and scores of in
dividuals and small organizations are
writing every day to get the latest in
formation about the dates of tho depart
ure of vessels and the cost of outfits.
WILL COME BY THOUSANDS.
No Limit to KlondiÃers Wh.o Will
Pass Through Tbis City.
The Alaska trade committee held a
business meeting yesterday morning.
President Sherwood stated that the pur
pose of the meeting was to consider fur
ther means of advertising In Eastern
cities. He laid before the committee a
proposition to advertise in the columns
of Eastern papers, where as low rates as
possible would be secured, for the pur
pose of making known the advantages of
San Francisco as an outfitting point.
Tho following resolution was adopted
by the committee: "Resolved, That the
funds hereafter collected by the commit
tee, otuside of present contracts, be used
only for the purpose of newspaper ad
vertising."
\Y. S. Scammell. who was one of the
party who went East in the special car,
explained the condition of affairs in the
Bast, and outlined the work that has
been done and is now under way. Presi
dent Sherwood also read communications
from Governor Sheakley and D. M. Car
man regarding the work in Chicago. Then
followed a discussion about the collec
tion of funds for the. committee's work,
and the city, as districted by the presi
dent, was read, and each member "i ihc
committee was given a certain distric: to
canvass f<>r subscriptions for the purpose
of advertising, as outlined in the resolu
tion.
An unusual number of inquiries by mail
were received yesterday, and a lame
number of letters in answer to the quan
:' literature was forwarded to the
addresses of the writi rs.
A letter was received from a represen
tative of â  parts Â°f tit t y men in Peoria,
111., who says that his party will leave
for Alaska early in the sprinp. and pre
fers to Kn by way of San Francisco. He
asks for all the literature at tl
Of tho Alaska Ruroau. Another was from
a party of twenty-five from the state of
Maine, and others from Nova Scotia. Vir
ginia and Georgia, besides the usual num
ber of Inquiries from Individuals and par
tlea In the .Mi. idle West and South, pre
paring to leave for Alaska as MX
possil representative of a party
of twenty-five from the South cailt'l ai
the bureau yesterday fi-r prices on out
fits He stated that each member of bis
party had subscribed (2000 to a k
fund". This amount of money the party
is prepared t.i Bpend for outfits and pro
visions sufficient to last for two years.
A circular letter has l><-.>n Issued by the
committee to the business men and prop
erty owners of the , i t > calling "ii them
to make further BUbscriptiona to the fund
of th< Trade Bureau. It repre
ss nts that ;;futers will -
. fifty million dollars on the I
. and that no matter what the ef
forts of the other coast cities to handle
surh an army of travelers, San Frai
can and will outfit them cheap*
ter. It is also urged that San Francisco
should ii. the outfitting, which In turn
will mean the Inflating when tl

the fruits of their hard-earned labor.

ADOPTS HIS

Baron Knapp's Device to

She Will by This Means be One

Children.
Petition Filed to Comply With the
Requirements of German
Laws.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
906 Broadway, Jan. li.
Baron Yon Knapp filed a petition in the
Superior Court this evening to be per
mitted to legally adopt his own daugh
ter that she may inherit her individual
fortune from her recently deceased
grandfather and also her title of Count
ess.
Baron Yon Knapp. as was stated ex
clusively in The Call, recently inherited
a fortune from his father in Germany.
In his earlier life he was married to a
California girl and some time later they
were divorced A little girl, the issue of
the union, was awarded to her mother,
and this is the young lady whose father
is anxious to adopt her. In the will of the
elder Yon Knapp there is an apportion
ment of 90.000 marks for "all future chil
dren" of William Yon Knapp of Califor
nia. In ord.r to acquire this money for
his child, the Baron has been advised by
the German Consul that to comply with
German law he must adopt the child by
which proceeding she will become one of
his 'â¢future ( hildren under the terms of
his father's will.
The petition of Yon Knapp recites these
details, and as it appears that the child's
mother offers no objection to the pro
cedure, it is not likely that his petition
will be denied. By his father's will the
Baron Inherited nearly half a million
marks, and he has recently received the
first installment.

ANTON SCMOTT IN CONCERT.
fin Evcrjing's EQtcrtaiomeQt With
Educational Sorjg Recitals.
The auditorium in the Young Men's
Christian Association building was com
fortably tilled last night by those of San
Francisco's music loving citizens who
went to hear the celebrated German sing
â¢r. Anton Schott. The evening's enter
tainment was catalogued with Schott as
the leading magnet, assisted by Miss Gor
don and Miss Voltz in what was pro
grammed as "Educational Song Recit
al.-." set to Wagner music and operaed
by TannhauÃer ' ' and "Lohengrin."
The entertainment opened with Schott
singing Wolfram'a prise song In act H ol
"Tannhauser." Tins portion of the sing
er's great ability bo plÂ«\ts.-d the audience
that an encore loud and long- brought him
to the front, where he cheerfully respond
cd.
Miss Gordon in a light but sweet voice
sang the balcony scene from ".Lohen
grin's" Elsa.
Schott responds and sings Wolfram's
song, to the accompaniment of his harp,
of his love for Elizabeth, calling upon the
beautiful star of eve to light her upon her
way when she should leave earth's sor
rows and go to the stars' own realms.
Miss Voltz, in the character of Eliza
beth, who has been anxiously watching
the return of the pilgrims in the vain
hope that Tannhauser may be among
them, now falls on her knees A sings her
beautiful prayer to the Virgin, begging to
be released from the sorrows of the earth
and pleading her intercession for the soul
of Tannhauser.
The scene continues with the trio al
ternating to the end, when the love duo
pictures the drawing of their love and the
discovery that they are brother and sis
ter.
Five more Friday evenings are on the
programme in the same place for a con
tinuation of Mr. Bchott'a appearance.
CHARGED WITH FRAUD.
Leonard Carver Arrested for Failing
to Pay H's Board Bill.
A â¢well-dressed, middle-aged man giv
ing his name as Leonard Carver was ar
rested yesterday afternoon on a warrant
from Police Court 4, charging him with
defrauding an inn-keeper.
The complaining witness Is Mrs. Ben
son, who conducts a private lodging
house.
th veral weeks ago Carver took a room
in her house. He claimed he was a
stranger In this city, and that he was ex
ig a draft from the Bast. Palling
to pay his rent, Mrs. IJonson repeatedly
asked him to sÂ»-ttu- with ht-r. or vacate
the room. According to her story, when
ever she asked him for the rent he â 
rush to the telephone, and pretend to
communicate with some rich relative.
Tired of waiting for the money which
tue her, Mrs. Benson informed Car
ver that she int.-nded to have him arrest
ed unless he settled with her.
That night he skipped out, taking his
property with him. Yesterday afternoon
Mrs. Benson saw Carver on Third -
and pointed him out to Policeman Sand
mans. He was then placed under arrest
and taken to the City Prison.
It is claimed that the prisoner has
worked a similar scheme on several oth
er lodging house keepers.
MIMIC CLOUDS
ARE GATHERING
Theatrical Managers Speak Not
as They Pass by and Peo
ple Wonder.
Belnsco Has Gone East to Gather Up
Talent for a Road Stock
Company.
It is rumored that a theatrical war is
about to break out in this city. For
some time past an ill feeling has exist
ed between the managements of the
Alcazar and Columbia theaters, and it
now looks as though a climax is about
to he reached. Reports are current that
Friedlander & Gottlob had made up
their minds to no longer support Fraw
ley, but that Harry Corson Clarke was
to be the idol of the patrons of the Co
lumbia, California and Baldwin thea
ters, and that Frederick Belasco was t>>
secure Frawlcy with the new organiza
tion now being arranged, but the
rumor io denied by both managements.
The idea is supposed to have started
from the fact that Clarke will open his
tour at the California Theater, but
whether or not Frawley will return
during the next season before an ap
preciative public is still rather left in
gloom. However, Belasco left for
Chicago last week on his way to
New York and possibly London,
for the purpose of gathering together
talent with which he expects to arouse
a furor among the patrons of his thea
ter. "Within a few weeks the Alcazar
management will have a stock com
pany in the theater, as well as a strong
organization on the road. The prices
on the road and in the theater will be
the same as that charged for the past
year.
Parties who have "watched the play
houses with interest during the present
misunderstanding are of the opinion
that Belasco will, while East, endeavor
to secure Frawley, and present the
company throughout the Western
towns, but there seems to be no ground
for the opinion. The stand the theatri
cal managements have taken against
one another is even more bitter than
it has been during the trouble which
started over a contract held with
Clarke supposedly by both houses. The
Columbia management does not recog
nize the Alcazar players. Miss Foster
of th? Alcazar called at the California
Theater with an Alcazar ticket, but
was refused any courtesies by the pro
prietors, and without doubt the ac
tions will be returned if any member
of the California should be thoughtless
enough to call at the Alcazar.
The full extent of the present move
ments will not be fully realized until
the return of Belasco, but without
doubt he will import good talent.
whether old or new. The movement is
watched with interest by all v parties
concerned.
Church of the Advent.
To-moxrow evening being 1 the regular
monthly choir night there will be special

A GREAT
INDUSTRY
MENACED
Farmers of Ventura
Send a Petition to
Congress.
Annexation Will Vastly
Reduce the Profits of
Beet Culture.
Clear Object Lesson in the Form
of Recently Signed Con
tracts.
THE MEMORIAL SIGNERS.
American Farmers Would Be Great
Losers by the Introduction of
Degrading Competition.
It Is obvious to the beet growers of
California that their present profit in
the cultivation of sugar beets would be
greatly diminished should the Hawai
ian Islands be annexed to the United
States. This is not a mere conjecture
upon the part of the farmers engaged
in this industry, but it is a deliberate
conclusion formed after careful study
of the competition, which the low grade
of labor at the islands threatens to in
troduce.
The beet sugar industry, now so rap
idly extending in this State and giv
ing promise of adding vast riches to
the community, is seriously menaced.
The product of vineyards, grain fields
and orchards added largely to the
wealth of California, and gave the
means of livelihood to a vast popula
tion long after the mining excitement
subsided. This new industry â the cul
tivation of the beet â promises, if pro
tected from unfair and degrading com
petition, to add more to the wealth of
the State than all the vines, orchards
and mines have yielded.
The effect of annexation is so well un
derstood by the beet growers them
selves that they are making contracts,
with agreement to accept lower prices
in case the islands should be annexed.
A petition signed by 100 farmers of
Ventura County has been forwarded to
Washington. Here is the memorial of
the Ventura farmers who have their
money invested in beet culture:
To the Congress of the United States:
\\ c. the undersigned residents and elec
tors of Ventura County, California, re
spectfully represent that we are farmers
and land owners in said County of Ven
tura, and that we have recently entered
into contracts and leases whereby we
agree to grow sugar beets for the beet
sugar factory now being established in
our county during- beet season for the
next five years, and for an additional two
years thereafter, at the option of the
owners of said sugar beet factory; that
the price which we shall receive for our
beets Is fixed and agreed upon in said
contracts: that it is further provided in
said contracts that in case the Hawaiian
Islands should at any time during the
existence of said contracts become an
nexed to the United States, then the price
which we shall receive for our beets
thereafter under said contracts will be
reduced 25 cents per ton: and, further,
that should the said Hawaiian Islands
become annexed to the United States at
any time during the next five years not
only would your petitioners suffer loss of
more than a half million dollars by rea
son of the reduction in the price they
would receive for their beets under said
contracts, but also all other beet grow
ers would suffer permanent loss and dis
advantage by reason of such annexation.
Wherefore, your petitioners pray that
your honorable body will refuse to annex
the Hawaiian Islands to the United
States.

The greatest minds on the track ad
mit that the game here is a very hard
one to beat this winter and this asser
tion was well borne out by results at

picking was difficult, but followers of
the turf are always hopeful and look
for a change for the better. It seems
destined never to come. The sport
was absolutely smeared with long-shots
beginning with the win of Brambella
a 25 to 1 chance. The only favorite
to score was O'Fleeta, ridden byf'aarley
Thorpe.
The track was sticky as on the pre
ceding day and no doubt this had much
to do with confusing form players, in
termingled with one or two very breezy
saddle exhibitions.
The general public thought Abina the
best of the seven starters in the open
ing six-furlong sprint, making her fa
vorite. She was just as much at home
in the going as a farmer would be lead
ing the minuet, finishing behind every
thing. Brambella with Morse up, pulled
out of the bunch, the last part win
ning easily from The Dipper, third
choice in the betting.
It looked as though Walter J was
gh to take the seven-furlong
si-I'.ing run next decided, but he
parc-ntly had an injection of embalm
ing fluid before going to the pest and
was fortunate to get the show. Thorpe
took the lead into the stretch with
O'Fleeta and, hard ridden, beat Jack
Martin out half a length.
The first two-year-old rare of the
n attracted a field of eleven "ba
bies" to the post. Barns & Water
house furnished the favorites in Boni
bel and Malay, which pair coupled
were held at evens throughout th
ting. Strong tips were out on The
Miller, Clarando, Anchored and Buena
Ventura. Following h!s custom of the
past two years, Louis Ezell had Buena
Ventura well seasoned, and backed
down from 8 to 4 and with Conley In
the saddle, the daughter of Luke Black
burn and Tommie Bell took the dash in
a big gallop, tripping off the three fur
longs in "7 S 4 . Clarando, a good-look
ing fllly by Clarendon, carrying the
colors of Caesar Young, came from be
hind like a good one. leading out An
chored for the place. Bonfbel was nerv
ous, but should do better next time
out. for she has doi st work.
The sturdy looking Polish seemed a
most Ukely cai Lidal for the mile sell
ing run and though heavily played by
both the stable and public remained
a stationary 8 to 5 choice in the ring.
Ous Wilson managed to get him cut off,
picked out the worst spots In thÂ» track,
and very artistically landed him just
beyond the money. Hazard, a 15 to 1
shot, ridden with good judgment by
little Gray, led throughout, and with
little to spare downed Nonchalance less
than a length.
A straggling start contributed to the
defeat of Kamsin, th^ first cholci
the second furling run. Torsion with
Ppencer in the saddle and 10 to 1 in the
bettinc slipped away in the lead and
was never headed, winninc: with some

SISTER JULIA ILL.
She Is Now at St. LuKes Hospita
but R'.'ars Her Sufferings
Nobly.
Sister Julia, who for many years
has been Identified with charitable work
in this city, is at present very ill at St.
Luke's Hospital.
For many years Sister Julia has been
known among the charitably inclined
people of this city as a woman who had
consecrated her life to the alleviation of
the sufferings of the poor and wretched
in this city, and particularly to looking
after children whose parents were too
poor to give them that care which every
child born In this world is expected to
have, or were unwilling to give it to
them for some other reason. With no
prospects whatever of earthly reward,
she has labored among the poor and
downtrodden in almost every phase of
life, and wherever suffering or disease
held sway her bright face, cheerful
smile and words of encouragement and
comfort have been known and welcomed.
Her indefatigable efforts toward the
alleviation of the miseries of the wretch
ed have at last told upon her system and
about two weeks ago she was brought to
the hospital for treatmnt; and although
her sufferings are intense she bears them
with a Christian fortitude and is eagerly
looking forward to the day when she will
again be able to go out and resume her
work. Although her chances of recovery
are but slight, her physicians have hopes
that her strong will power Will eventu
ally triumph over the trying ordeal
through which she is now passing, and
that she will be again able to minister
unto the sick and needy.
Her work In this city has been con
nected with and principally supported by
the Protestant Episcopal churches, and
the Sheltering Arms Mission, on Harri
son street, was founded almost by her
unaided efforts.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 15, IS9B.
DEFECTS OF CITY
MANAGEMENT
Professor Jordan Says
They Are Due to Lax
Methods.
He Disapproves of .the Gov
ernment of Santa Clara
County.
San Francisco in His Opinion Is Also
Managed on Too Extrava
gant Plans.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of
Leland Stanford Jr. University, de
livered a lecture at Metropolitan Hall
last night on the subject, "Manage
ment of Cities." After going at length
into the primary causes leading to the
mismanagement of municipal affairs.
Professor Jordan astonished the audi
ence by his very candid expression of
the way public affairs are conducted in
Santa Clara County.
"I am not thoroughly conversant,"
said he, "with the municipal system
of San Francisco. 1 am told, how
ever, that it is too extravagant and
that a half dozen merchants could, if
given the contract, conduct the public
affairs here for one-half or probably
one-third what it now costs the tux
payers. I have been Informed that
within the last seven years the cost >>f
municipal government has been raised
aboul BO per cent In San Francisco
without any corresponding advance in
property or wages. 1 know a little
more, however, about Santa Clara
County. The management there is Ir
responsible I think the county Is
prettier named than any other county
in the State, but it seems to me the
name of Santa Clara Is a su-nch when
it comes to municipal government."
Professor Jordan said that he was of
the opinion that municipal extrava
gance was due to the present lax po
litical system. "Good men go Into of
fice/ saiil he, "and then th- y have to
nut only stand the pressure of their
nieces and nephews who want places,
but they have to look out fdr their po
litical backers. Their political obli
gations have to be ]>ail and they are
paidâ out of the public pocketbook.
These are visible costs, but the Invisible
cost? fir* far greater. In Europe the
have to support and look out for
their Kings and Princes, but the X
and Princes are not near as costly a.s
the local political bops. Office is not
generally sought for the honor, but for
the money that is in it.
â¢We have a port of government by
poo-smv. If a Republican President
doesn't suit all the Republicans, the
dissatisfied ones vote with the Demo
crats at the next election, and out goes
the Republican President. If prosper
ity doesn't come with his four-year
term, the dissatisfied Democrats go
over to the Republican party, and out
goes Mr. Democrat. So it is that we
have a see-saw government. And the
President i*:i't the only one who goes
out. Tip- people seem to think that if
the President is changed, bo 'shall all
the municipal officers of bis particular
political faith, and the slaughter
on. For this reason. I believe, we '
should have municipal elections sepa
rate from national elections. Th>n
there is our primary system. It is nrt
ten from one end to the other. While
I do not know just what would be the
â¢ â¢".â¢-ans to remedy our municipal
troubles, I think that if more power
was vested in one man and be was held
directly responsible t" the i pl<
would experience a change for rh>- b.-t
ter. As it Is, the offleehold* r
seem to be responsible to any one, and
around him has grown up the spoils
systemâ a system of extravagance."

dan last night was the r â¢ series

CUT A SWATH
ON FANCIED CASH
Henry Bechtel Was a Bright
Star in the Tenderloin a
Few Brief Hours.
He Lefts Retinue Who Volunteered
to Help Spend His Boasted
Wealth.
Henry Bechtel. who claimed to some
that ho came from Oroville and to others
that he was a resident of Newman, mil- â¢]
into the tenderloin a few nights ago and
boasted that he had thousands to spend
In having a good time. i!.' soon had â 
retinue who looked upon him as a gool
thins, and they at once prepared plans
to assist him in spending his allege']
fabulous wealth. Now many are wonder
ing how and why they Joined the throng
that promised to be merry. Bechtel
claimed that he was â  nephew of George
Bechtel of Staten Island, the owner of
one of the largest breweries in America.
To some of his followers he said he
owned a cattle range in Butte County
that comprised 73.000 acres of good fertile
land, and to others he confided that in
addition to owning Butte County he was
possessed of a large tract of land In
Duranpo. Mexico, that was officially
recorded as containing 54,000 acres. On the
two ranges ho said there were 53,000 head
of cattle that were the finest In the
world.
This wonderful rattle kins wore a dingy
red sweater and threadbare trousers with
a torn cap sel Jauntily on the side of his
head. He had a fondness for good din
ners and most of these tales were "old ; i
waiters while ho gorged himself
fancy wines and ordered hot birds with
out stint. A J2O meal wns poor far- for
him. He would start off by giving the
waiter a tip of a dollar and insist that
i.'i the hilf dozen friends ho htd
picked up durinp the day should have
the very best of service and promised to
pay handsomely for it. Then his at
Â«.f wealth would dazzle the minion of th.>
chef. Before he would pet throuph the
cattle ki;:p would discover some quality
in the waiter that would make him a lit
man for i mployment on one Â«,f his won
derful ranches, and before the black cof
fee would he served the waiter would be
engaged at n salary that never f-!l abort
of $500 a month, and to begin at once
The diner was. of course, always shor; of
ready cash when the meal was finished
but he never had much difficulty in get
ting credit until the banks would open
next day when the little hill would be
settled. The waiters suffered the most
but there were many who formed his
retinue who are a few dollars out. The
famous cattle king when he was short a
little ready money had. of course, to bur
row â  fv w dollars, and the friends he
made were appealed to. It took several
days for thfjn t<> realise who the dupes
r> -ally were, and by that time Bechtel had
gone.

Receiving Many Appli
cations for the Place.
Appointment Will Not Be Made
Before the Expiration of
Ten Days-
GOLDEN JUBILEE HOLID^pf.
Cleveland Letters Invoking Executive
Clemency for Worden Receive
Special Attention.
Governor Budd will not take up the
various applications f"r the position of
Raiiroad Commisioner until next Wed
nesday, and the appointment will not
be announced until at least ten days
thereafter. Speaking on this topic he
said:
"I shall take time to consider all the
recommendations and if I desire to see
any parties in regard to the subject will
send for them. I can only say now that
the man selected will be capable, a
Democrat and resident of this district,
which includes the counties of San
Francisco, San Mateo and Marin. I re
gret thru Mr. Pond declined the place,
as I regard him as possessing special
abilities in the line of duty required of
a commissioner."
The Governor was asked if the South
ern Pacific had indicated any choice
among the applicants. In reply he re
marked: "I have not received as much
as a communication from any one con
: â¢; with the railroad company.
They have expressed no choice so far
as 1 am inforn.
There are other applicants for the po
sition aside from Judge Lawlor, J. T.
Burke, Alex Vogelsang and J. H. Bar
ry. The Governor could not state yes
terday how many there were, as he had
not had time during the past few days
to look over all the papers on the sub
ject.
The letters written by ex-President
and invoking clemency in behalf
of Worden have received the attention
of the Governor. "Mr. Cleveland
vouches for the men who have given
Information concerning the mental con
dition of Worden Bince the prisoner's
boyhood," observed the Governor. "The
question turns on Warden's mentality.
The date for the execution of the sen
tence is a month hence, so I shall have
time to look into all the facts In the
case and examine all the recommenda
tions presented. The judge who tried
the case has given me his opinion of
Worden's mental attitude during the
tria!. I have recived many letters and
statements from people who have
known Worden since his childhood.
"'I expect to make a thorough inves
tigation of this case to ascertain if good
cause exists for the â¢ .v xecu- â¢
tive clemency. No; I cannot say that
Mr. Cleveland's position as President of
the United States gave him opportuni
ty to gain other knowledge of the case
than was present) it at the trial or any
information that may have been ex
cluded at the trial. As I understand it,
the guilt of Worden is not disputed, but
that the question raised pertains to the
mental responsibility of the convicted
man. Mr. Cleveland has taken time to
investigate for himself as to the char
acter, judgment and standing of the
men who write to me that they have
known Worden since his infancy. The
letter from Mr. Cleveland attests their
standing, and invites my confidence in
their judgment."
To-day Governor Budd will proclaim
Monday, January 24, a legal holiday.
"The proclamation," said the Grrvernor,
"was prepared some days ago. and I
expected that it would be issued last
Wednesday, but I left it at my office in
Stockton. It will be published to-mor
row. Yes; there is ample time for the
notice to reach the most distant and re
mote parts of the State. In fact, the
announcement was made on my au
thority some wef-ks ago that the open
ing day of the Golden Jubilee celebra
tion would be a legal holiday, so th^ in
convenience, if any. will be* slight."
The Governor has been very busy this
week. Wednesday afternoon he was at
the Attorney General's office attending
a prolonged session of the State Board
of Examiners. A large volume of ac
cumulated business was disposed of.
The extra work in this department of
duty following so closely on other offi
cial demands caused a return of rheu
matic troubles, and he was obllp^d to
seek absolute seclusion from visitors
for two days. He expects to attend the
session of the Regents of the Univer
sity to-day.

HEARD THE INVENTORS.
Car Fenders Were Considered by
the Supervisoreâ No Ac-
tion Yet.
ThÂ« Committee on Brakes and Fenders
of the Board of Supervisors held an ex
tended session yesterday, listening to the
arguments of a number of inventors who
desired to have their devices adopted on
the street railroads of thH city.
Models that would tax the brain of the
most expert mechanic to understand -were
spread before the committee for inspec
tion, and the Supervisors ended by taking
the various claims under consideration
and adjourning to the call of the chair.
There are yet a number of inventors to
be heard from, and another meeting: for
that purpose will probably be held on
Friday next.

Breon Sr. was a prominent Knight
his work with ?nmÂ» assurance that he
will not be molested. For months past
he has been practically under a guard,
for hÂ»- believed that there was a plan to
make away with him; that some day
he would be found â¢i â¢ - ri . l . a letter tell
ing of his suicide In his pocket and an
other confessing his guili of thÂ«- belfry
murders. That his fears were not
without foundation was not wanting
confirmation. H-- was constantly be
illed for by people who would give
no name, t<> travel to all parts of the
city and at all hours of the night and
day. He was at one tlmÂ»- called on to
perform a wedding in the churcb by a
mr, n who wished to be married with
out witnesses and late at nic;ht. The
man would Kiv-> no name nor would he
tell th>- name of the bride to be. He
told the pastor hp wan; mar
ried quietly and he wanted none but
the minister and his bride and himself
present: he was t<>M he must have
witnesses, and that there would he a
meetinc of th" young people in the par
lors of the rhurrh thnt nipht and one
of tht-m could come up to the big audi
torium and be a witness. This se I
t" m- t-t th.' disfavor of the insistent
swain and he said he would think of it.
The result of his thoughts was never
known by the pastor, for the man and
his bride were seen no more.
The attitude of the pastor during the
notoriety of the case was not a clear
nor a comfortable one. He has been
referred to as the enemy of the Pur
rants throughout the whole trial and
all that has followed it, hut he claims
that the first assault was made upon
him by the prisoner and his friends
and that after such a show of antag
onism he could not offer to assist th^m,
knowing: that hÂ» himself waa consider
ed by them as their greatest enemy.
The first Idea he received of the un
der current against him was when he
was sh'Â»un â  telegram from Lob An
geles telling the Chief of Police to "ar
rest the pastor at once; will follow la
ter with facts." Right or wrong, the
pastor attributes this telegram to the
emissaries of the defense, who were
working every means to stay the tide
of public opinion which was turning
so fast against Durrant. There was
no name signed to the telegram, and
there was no Indication as to who sent
it, hut the evident purpose was to
bring the pastor within the grasp of
the police and divert attention from
the real culprit.
Chief Crowley paid no heed to the
telegram and the fact of its existenc â 
was never known to more than the
â¢ i's most intimate friends, but to
that circumstance was due the pas
tors desire to hold aloof from the Dur
rants and their defense and the law
yers defending, it was also such Inci
dents that prompted his remark about
Deuprey making him a friend instead
of an enemy. He has explained it by
saying he meant that had Deuprey
come to him and the officers and prom
inent members of the church and ask
ed them to help, instead of vilifying
them and trying to Include them in
the general suspicion, h>> would have
had a better chance to clear his client
and he would have had people willing
to assist where he had only people who
were anxious to let the whole dis
graceful affair sink out of sight.
Trustee Taber represents the feeling
of the church people when he says:
"I think I voice the S'-ntiments of
most of the people who make Emmanuel
T:;<l't'*t Church their church home
when I say that we COBSider.lt unwise
for us, as well as the public at large,
to agitate or talk any more of thÂ« un
happy experiences which we have pass
ed through the past two and a half
years."
Continuing about the plan of the
church people, he said: "As one of the
trustees, I cannot say now what we will
do in regard to closing down the tÂ«rw
er. We probably would do so if we had
the money. At present we are bending
all our energies toward reducing the
debt; this we find very hard to do in
these times of general depression in
business. The congregations are large,
but many of the number are strangers
or visitors who contribute very little to
ward the support of the church.
"We all like Mr. Gibson; he is by far
the best preacher the church has had
for many years. We deprecate
uncalled-for remarks made by some
people, especially by Mr. Cress j, a for
mer pastor, who has never Been Mr.
Gibson. Mr. Cressy feels a bitterness
toward our people because they <li,l not
want him and would not retain him.
Surely. Mr. Gibson was not to biame.
"You ask me to explain Mr. Gibson's
remarks about Mr. Deuprey having him
for a friend. Well, from the conversa
tion I had with him about it he felt, as
we all have, that it would have been
much better for the defense if it had
Templar. Immediately at the foot of
the guardian angel of heaven, and
under its protecting influence, is rep
resented in life-size figures a group of
the Breon family. This represents
three children in a playground, and the
parents standing by, looking on. The
son is represented with his bicycle, in
the act of taking a spin through the
park, as was his custom in life.
The central figure on each one of the
n robes, also the shields and the eagle,
will be made of bronze.
The arch will cost $30,000. The money
has been set aside and work on the
arch will be begun in the fall of the
year.
come to him and us and said: 'This
man was one of your members : you
say he bore a po"od name among you:
give us a friendly hand as far a
can.' Had they done this instead of
casting suspicion on him and others, I
believe, as well as Mr. Gibson, that the
moral effect would have been of s
benefit to them. Now. this is th
that I understand that Mr. Gibson in
tended or wished to convey.
"In conclusion, let me say' that I hope
the press will let the matter drop. I
think the public is tired of It."

A masked robber, armed with two re
volvers, entered the saloon and grocery
of John Jess at the northeast corner of
First and Folsom streets last Thursday
evening, and commanding the proprietor
and two patrons to stand against the
wall, he emptied the cash register, secur
ing 30 cents. lie then run from the saloon
and disappeared down Folsom street.
Jess was standing behind the bar when
the robber entered. Drawing two revol
vers he covered Jess with one of them
and trained the other on Charles Thomp
son and Tom Harris, who were in the sa
toon a.t the time. He commanded them
not to make an outcry on the penalty of
being riddled with bullets. He then or
dered Jess to open the cash drawer and
give him the contents. Realizing that he
was in the hands of a desperate man,
lid as requested. The robber then
backed oui of the saloon and disappeared.
Immediately after the robbery word
sent to the police headquarters and
tlvea Ryan and ODea were detailed
on the case. They visit- it the saloon, and
hi aring Jess' story, started after
the robber. From the description given
of him they are convinced that he is the
man who some time ago held up a saloon
keeper at Sunnyside ana got away with
$16.
He is described as being about 6 feet 8
- in height, well built, wore a dark
slouch hm. which was pulled down over
his eyes, and a brown suit of clothes. The
<l. scriptioii given of him corresponds with
that of the Sunnyside robber. In telling
the story of the robbery last night Jess
said :
"] was hehind the counter wiping some
glasses when a masked stranger entered.
Thompson and Harris w.:-re standing
against the bar engaged in conversation.
As he opened the dour he produced two
revolvers, and pointing one at me said-
Throw up your hands or I will kill you."
He then covered Thompson and Harris
with â¢' revolver, and with an oath
declared that he Would send them to the
Morgue it' they made any resistance. HÂ»
then coolly ordered me to give him the
contents of the till.
â¢T reluctantly complied, as I did not
know whether or not he would resort to
bloodshed to *rain his end. After secur
ing the money, he backed out of t !
toon, tn the meantime stil! coveriniT ua
with his revolvers. On reaching the door
he suddenly closed it and dashed down
Folsom street. I immediately telephoned
to the police, but they wore unable to get
any trace of him. From the cool r:.
in which he did his work T am con

He wore a black sHk handkerchief about
