SACRAMENTO, Jan. 18.â At 5 o'clock
this afternoon the forward engine of
the westbound overland train, due in
this city at 5:40 p. m., Jumped the
track one mile east of Colfax, and,
leaving the roadbed, turned down over
a low embankment. The second engine
followed its leader off the track, but
luckily turned over and remained on
the roadbed Instead of plumping upon
the engine down the embankment, or
thp fatality list might have been longer.
The acclileut occurred lust below one
of the most dangerous places on this
or any other railroad. At Cape Horn
the angle Is about 45 degrees, and there
is no obstruction between it and the
abyss thousands of feet below.
Engineer C. C. Brown and Fireman
Edward Lightner were on the forward
engine, and, as the great machine
lurched and went over, both men went
down with it. Engineer Brown es
caped with a few superficial bruises,
and an hour later was walking around,
but Lightner was somewhere under
neath his engine and presumably dead,
as up to a late hour to-night he had not
been found.
Engineer D. Z. Hackett and Fireman
C; F. Brown, both of this city, were on
the second engine, and the accident, oc
curring as it did without warning,
pave neither of them a chance to jump.
Engineer Hackett was badly scalded
about the head and face, besides being
Injured internally, and at 7 o'clock two
hours after he went over with his en
gine, he breathed his last. C. F. Brown,
Hackett's fireman, sustained several
contusions about the body, but was not
seriously injured.
The mail car, the baggage and ex
press car, the day coach and the smok
ing car also loft the rails, but did not
leave the roadbed, and beyond a gen
eral shaking up none of the passengers
were injured.
Mail Clerk Stevens was flung against
the end of his car with extreme violence
and his back is injured, though how
severely could not be ascf-rtained. Ex
press Messenger Burke wap also shaken
up, but received no contusions, and at
latest accounts was 6aid to be all
right.

NEW YORK. Jan. l<vâ A special ca

as this dispatch is sent by special cou
rier to Key West Havana is Jn a tre
mendous excitement caused by the
news of a formidable conspiracy among
the volunteers to overthrow General
Blanco. The conspiracy was discovered
yesterday morning by the Chief of Po
lice. Colonel Paglieri.
The plotters intended to start an
armed revolt by the 20.000 volunteers
now in Havana and to compel General
Blanco to leave the island, as they did
Captain-General Domingo Dulce in 1869.
A simultaneous assault was to he made
on the forts surrounding Havana, es
pecially on La Cabana, and the troops
now stationed at strategical points of
the city were to be overpowered and
compelled to surrender. The success
of the conspiracy was nearly assured
by the complicity of many officers of
the army, the sympathy of the Span
ish regular infantry and of the military
police with th'> volunteers and rioters of
the past week.
As soon as th<* news reached the pal

General Blanco summoned to his pal

WASHINGTON. Jan. 18.â The
Washington Post thinks that
a vote on th*Â» Hawaiian treaty
will not be reached in the Sen
ate for three ir four weeks yet.
Senator Carter, the chairman
of the Census Committee, gave
notice to the Senate on Monday
that he intended to insist upon
the disposition of the bill pro
viding for the appointment of a
director and thirty-one other
employes of the twelfth census.
In response to an inquiry from
Mr. White of California, Mr.
Carter said he had no desire to
displace the Hawaiian treaty,
but thought the census measure
could be passed promptly.
Senator Davis was quoted yes
terday as saying he did not be
lieve the vote on the treaty
would be tak^n for a month.
NEW YORK, Jan. IS.â There is no
surprise here over the fact that C. P.
Huntington is ii- fxror of annexation.
His attitude In the matter is usually
attributed to his well known love for
Chinese labor. The gentleman was
seen at 10 o'clock to-night and asked
concerning his views on Hawaii. He
was not inclined to talk at length, but
in what he said he was entirely frank.
"While annexation might affect cer
tain local Interests," he responded to
a direct question, "still as an American
citizen I believe we should control the
islands." The cat has escaped the bag.
Perhaps it is worth while to examine
the "local interests" in regard to which
Mr. Huntington feels concern. While
on his latest visit t<> San Francisco he
gave a dinner to certain of his subor
dinates there. On this occasion, which
was in May of last year, the principal
event was an address from Huntington
himself. This address was printed in
full in The Call, a copy of which is at
hand. After eulogizing his guests and
reciting the progress of the country
Huntington said: '"If you could have
had the cheap labor of Asia with which
to do a portion of the work, the ind-us
tries created would have given employ
ment to two Americans for every Mon
golian, but the Americans lost the
work for the lack of the industries
which would have sprung up in the

LOS ANGELES TO
CONTROL HER OWN
WATER SUPPLY
PEOPLE INDORSE THE CALL'S POSITION.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 18.â A meeting of the Republican City Central
Committee is to be called at an early day to indorse the position The
Call has taken in regard to the city water contest.
Chairman Telfair Creighton has already called a meeting of the Demo
cratic City Committee to consider a resolution of indorsement. The Silver
Republican Club and the Jeffersonian Society will take action on the
matter through its board of directors. This evening the Populist City
Central Committee met and by a unanimous vote adopted the follow
ing resolution:
"We, the People's party City Central Committee, assembled in
session this 18th day of January, 1898, do declare that inasmuch as the
San Francisco Call has enthusiastically taken up the water supply
question in Los Angeles City and has taken the side of the people in
this momentous matter; therefore be it
"Resolved, That we, as representatives of a party that declared In its
platform of recent date for mountain or other pure water to be dis
tributed, controlled and owned by the people themselves, do hereby
tender our sincere thanks to The Call and assure its editor of our
hearty co-operation in his great fight for the people of this city."
The resolution was offered by Milton Carlson, an instructor in the
Los Angeles High School and the chairman of the committee. After
it was presented it was adopted amid great enthusiasm and a copy was
ordered engrossed and sent to John D. Spreckels as editor of the Call.
this could only be done by workmen
whose average price was not above the
rate paid by other manufacturing
countries of the world. â¢ â¢ â¢ No in
telligent man questions the general ben
efit of labor-saving machines, which
have added so much to the prospects
and progress of our country, yet we
might as well rule them out as to turn
away the labor of the Chinese."
Such were the Huntingdon senti
ments in May of last year, and no
change of heart on his part has been
reported. No wonder he wants to take
in Hawaii with its thousands of his
rhown people. Now the Chinese are
obliged to sneak in, and the inconve
nience to which they are put must be
trying to their friend.
But there is another "local matter"
well understood here whether the peo
ple of the coast appreciate it or not,
and this is the Huntington desire to
have certain ships of English manufac
ture given an American register. It
is stated here that Huntington is anx
ious to have the China, the Aztec and
Baracouda fly the American flag. They
are Rnglish bottoms and not entitled
to the privilege. It is openly said here
that Huntington has made a deal with
the annexatlonists whereby these ves
sels were to be given register. Then
there would be no way of preventing
them having American registry if fly
ing the flag of Hawaii at the time the
Islands were taken in. This is thought
here to be the milk in the cocoanut. It
is even stated that some of these ships
have already received the boon Hunt
ington has been seeking, and now fly
the Hawaiian flag. Among those who
know Huntington the opinion prevails
that this is in accordance with the spe
cific terms of a bargain. Huntington
had agreed, they think and say, that
in the event of receiving the registry
asked for, he would do all he could to
help annexation, and he is doing it.
Among the opponents of annexation
this fact is a source of delight. They
contend that nothing could injure the
Dole scheme quite so much as the sup
port of it by Huntington. That he
comes to it 3 support, they argue, is the
best showing possible that it Is per
nicious and directly against the com
THIS IS Wt-iAT ANNEXATION MEANS.
mon interests. Indeed, the fact that
Huntington is fighting them is one of
the strongest assurances that they are
in the right, and that they will
triumph. They feel that this fight is
not one to be won with Southern Pa
cific money.
SENATOR MORGAN
MAKES A TALK
FOR ANNEXATION.
Claims That the Nation Which Controls the
Hawaiian Islands Will Control the
Commerce of the Pacific.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â Senator
Morgan occupied the attention of the
Senate during the entire time of the
executive session to-day in the presen
tation of his views on the subject of
annexation of the Hawaiian Islands.
This was the second installment of the
Senator's speech, and when he conclud
ed, a few minutes after 5 o'clock, he
had not then reached the end. He
spoke for about three teours to-day, and
his speech was a general presentation
of the importance of the islands to the
T'nitfd States. He dwelt especially up
on the military importance of the is
lands, quoting General Schofield and
Captain Mahan at length in support of
his position that the islands were a
natural outpost for the United States
and necessary to the protection of our
western coast and of our general com
merce in case of war.
Mr. Morgan predicted that if the
United States did not take advantage
of the present opportunity to acquire
the islands there would be war between
this country and some other power
within ten years. It was not, he said,
within the bounds of possibility, in
view of the present European compe
tition for territory in Asia, that the
Hawaiian Islands should be allowed to
remain independent for any length of
time after the United States should an
nounce a determination not to make
them a part of American territory.

mean to say," interrupted Senator Pet

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 18.â The second
result of the publication by The Call
of the people's side of the case in the
great battle that is on between the
city of Los Angeles and the Los An
geles City Water Company, in which
the magnificent sum of over a million
and a half of money of the taxpayers
is at stake, can be recorded. The sec
ond result is one that will be a sur
prise to the people of Los Angeles, and
which will be another boomerang to
the syndicated daily press, which in
this all-important contest has present
ed only such facts as the water com
pany desired the pubiic to have. City
Attorney William E. Dunn goes on
record as stating that the proposition
and contention of Mayor M. P. Snyder
that at the expiration of its lease from
the cJty the plant now in the posses
sion of the water company reverts to
the city and that the city can take pos
session of it on July 22 next is correct
and sound from a legal standpoint.
This Is the most Important state
ment that has ever come from City At
torney Dunn in regard to this matter
of municipal operation of a watei dis
tributing plant. Mr. Dunn goes fur
ther. He says that the counsel en
gaged and paid for by the city to con
fer with him in regard to all water
litigation â Messrs. Lee and Scott
agree with him that all the city has
to do is to take possession of the plant
of the water company on the expira
tion of Its lease. Then the company
will be forced to go into the courts to

air. Dunn adds that, in company with
Messrs. Lee and Scott, he had for some
months been procuring and brieiing au- ;
thorities which support his contention,
and that he had found them and fully :
â¢satisfied himself and his associates that
It was a proper move for the city to
make on the 22d day of next July. :
When The Call of Monday reached
here this morning and as soon as it be
came circulated among the people, the
greatest interest was manifested in the
paper's expose of the condition of the
â water fight. Citizens gathered in knots
about the streets and talked the matter
over. In the clubs and in the public
offices at the City Hall and the Court
house it was the Bole topic of discus- j
Bion. The fact that most impressed cv- j
erybody was the idea that the people ,
of Los Angeles were compelled to go to
San Francisco to find a daily newspa
per that would protect them from a |
cold-blooded, clean-cut, deliberately I
planned scheme that was being put up
and gradually being carried to a sue- j
cessful consummation to mulct them -
in the sum of almost $2,000,000. if mv- ;
nieipal ownership was obtained, or to
defeat the proposition altogether. The
Times, Herald and Express wore round
ly denounced on Jill sides, and the po
sition taken by The Call was every
where the subject of favorable com- :
ment.
The men in bnth private and public
life, who have either openly m* covert
ly aided in the carrying out of the wa
ter company's skillfully arranged plans
Mere dismayed. In the past they have
been Becure, and have imagined that
they were protected from censure for
betraying the people's interest. They
have known that the syndicated three
daily papers would never hold them np
to public scorn for any official act they
might be guilty of which would
strengthen the clutch of the water com
pany upon the people of this city.
They knew that do cftlaen would bo
given access to the Times. Herald or
Express for the purpose of. exposing
their betrayal of their trust.
Therefore when The Call came into
the field with a presentation of the
people's Bide of this vital contest it
caused an awakening among those who
knew their own guilt. They went about
and when asked what they thought
of the matter as presented by The Call
they shook their beads. They made
no attempt to deny the facts as pre
sented, for they could not. The facts
were absolutely -unassailable In point
of truth or logic. So these persons
simply dismissed the subject as beat
they could and proceeded to private of
fices, where they conferred among
themselves.
A representative of The Call called
upon s. H. Mr.tt, the secretary of the
LoS Angeles City Water Company, to
day and requested a statement "from
him as the representative of the OOT
poration. Mr. ICott was Informed
that the paper desired to Rive the
company's side of the case fairly, and
would do so over his sitcnature as sec
retary. He said that he had no au
thority to give any staromenl and the
matter was one in which he rould not
not without the consent of the board
of directors and under its instruction.
Herman Silver, the president of the
City Council, was seen. Mr. Silver was
not desirous of making any statement,
but he did Rive to The ("all the follow
ing Signed communication:
My views on the water question have
time and apaln been made public through
my utterances on the floor of the Council
chamber and by my official acts and votes
as Councilman. By them I am willing to
be Judged.
I was elected as a Councilman upon â¢ a
platform favoring municipal ownership
of the water pFant. All of my acts In an
official and private capacity have been
aimed and directed to bring about that
result upon a basis of equity and Justice
to all parties concerned.
HERMAN SILVER.
Further than this statement Mr. Sil
ver declined to go, on the ground that
he had no desire to enter into any con
troversy.
William E. Dunn, City Attorney, was
Interviewed. Mr. Dunn wished It to
be distinctly understood that in the
battle that was now on he desired to
be at all times recorded as being on the
Bide of the people, whose interests he
had sworn to faithfully represent and
protect as the legal adviser of the mu
nicipality. Asked as to his opinion of
the Mayor's contention that on the 22d
of July next the city could again take
possession of its plant, the City Attor
ney said:
"The Mayor, in announcing that fact
in his annual message placed the water
company in possession of information
which may defeat the accomplishment
of anything of the kind. Messrs. Lee
and Scott and myself had fully deter
mined upon advising that very course
of procedure at the proper time. We
have gone into the matter exhaustively
and become convinced that it was legal,
but not until next July should this have
been given out. The water company
can now go into the courts and claim
that it is threatened with being forci
bly dispossessed of its property and ask
that the city be enjoined from taking
the step.
"If the Mayor had not made the pub
lication we could have quietly gone on
the expiration of the lease and taken
possession of the plant. Then the water
company could have done the litigat
ing."
"Mr. Dunn, you are perhaps aware
that in certain quarters it has been al
leged that you, as legal adviser of the
city, have contributed your mite to
procure for the company the much de
sired delay in bringing negotiations for
the acquirement of the plant by the
city to a head?"
"No man can truthfully allege any
thing of the kind. Whatever I may
have done in the past no one can as
sert that I have done other than my
duty as City Attorney, and more par
ticularly does this apply to the water
matter. I am a young man and upon
my conduct of the water negotiations
I am willing to stake my future. On
the 24th of next month a suit will be
tried in the Superior court of tremen
dous importance to the city. It is to
determine the ownership of the source
of water supply of the Crystal Springs
Land and Water Company. We claim
that the water comes from the river
and that it belongs to the city. The
water company claims it by right of
development. I tell you that I am go
ing to win this case for the city. s
"T wish to say that my record is open
and I challenge any one to demonstrate
where and how by any specific act of
mine I have betrayed the people and
shown any undue friendship for the
water company."
The Express, the special pleader for
the water company in the evening
journalistic field, has frequently re
ferred to the fact that the water com
pany is a heavy tax-payer. The truth,
of the matter is the water company has
not yet paid its city taxes. It is by
litigation seeking to evade payment.
The water company contends that the
assessment made by the City Assessor
is not equitable. Its city taxes amount
to $11,726 96. It refuses to pay them,
but tendered $10,006 30 on a valuation
fixed by its own directors. The City
Tax Collector declines to accept the
money. So the water company has paid
no city taxes because it is not satisfied
with an assessment approved by its
own counsel.
Exclusive of the sum .above men
tioned it paid taxes to the county in
the sum of $16,514 24 for the -year.

Better Government League Too
Busy Hounding Walter
L. Webb.
Shows No Disposition to Cause Self-
Confessed Bribe-Takers to Be
Punished.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 18.â In view of
the recent disclosures made in The Call
as to the composition of the League for
Better City Government, its manage
ment, its personnel and its objects, peo
ple are discussing from a new stand
point its connection with the prosecu
tion of Walter L. Webb.
In this case the league figures as the
prosecutor through its attorneys; as
Judge it is represented by Charles Cas
sat Davis, chairman of the Board of
Kriucation, who is a league member and
who was elected a School Director on
the ticket of the league. The league
also sits as Jury in this case, as it ap
parently controls a majority of the mem
bers of the board. Judging from the
election of Chairman Davis as presiding
officer of that body.
With the league acting as prosecu
te r, judge and jury, people are now
wondering how Webb can expect jus
tice to be done him.
Attention has also been drawn to the
persistency and energy with which
Webb had been pursued, and the utter
neglect to prosecute all others who have
been shown t<> be implicated more or
less directly in the School Board scan
dals. There are no less than nine per
sons who have been* shown to be guilty
of criminal acts in this connection by
th-ir own confessions, by the uncontra
dicted testimony of others, or by docu
mentary evidence.
C. H. Axt.il, Superintendent of Build
ings and Janitors, approached various
school employe* f'Â»r the purpose of t-x
torting money from them, and actually
received money from a number of them.
He also swore falsely before the School
Hoard, before the Grand Jury and be
fore the Superior Court in connection
with the Webb case.
J. F. Adams, who resigned from the
, School Board as the result of the pres
ent investigations, committed the same
offenses charged against Axtell, with
the possible exception that he did not
lay himself liable to a charge of per
jury while testifying in the Superior
Court.
J. S. Pitman, the minister who was a
member of the preceding Board of Ed
ucation, acted as go-between in a mat
ter of bribery for E. E. Cooper and Ax
tell.
J. H. Braly, a member of the Board
of Education, has confessed to having
indulged in the practice of "shaving"
teachers' warrants through the South
ern California Savings Bank, of which
he is president. In doing this Mr.
Braly violated two separate and dis
tinct laws, laying himself liable to
prosecution for a felony, and his bank
Breedings to forfeit its franchise.
2. Cooper, a janitor in one of the
: schools, boujrht his position
Axtell through the agency of the
r. H. Pitman.
W. H. Morris, the janitor of the High
School, bought his position and testiiied
falsely before the Grand Jury.
Miss Clara Sehroeter, a teacher in
one of the schools, procured her posi
tion by purchase from Adams. She
claims that her mother transacted all
the business connected with the matter
without her knowledge.

tigrew, "that the Hawaiian Govern
ment would voluntarily seek the pro
tection of some other power and thus
forego the great advantage those is
lands now enjoy in their reciprocity ar
rangements with the United States
which results in our remitting to them
annually not less than $6,000,000?"
To this question Senator Morgan re
plied that the reciprocity treaty had
been negotiated for the purpose of giv
ing this country cheap sugar. He said
it had been of greater benefit to the
United States than it had been to Ha
waii, because it had accomplished its
purpose of making cheaper one of the
great commodities and one of the ne
cessities of every household. We want.
he said, not only the sugar from Ha
waii, but cheaper coffee as well, and
that and many other necessary articles
could be grown on those islands.
The Senators displayed a number of
large maps, from which he contended
that the islands were in the roadway
of commerce between our western
roast and the Orient, and said that all
ships, whether laden with the articles
of commerce ot munitions of war must
necessarily pass them in going from
and to this country and the Asiatic
coast, and thus, he said, the nation
which controls Hawaii will control the
commerce of the East. In closing, he
said that failure to annex the islands
meant inevitable bloodshed, and the re
sponsibility for that bloodshed would
rest upon the Senate of the Unjted
States for its failure to perform its
duty at this critical hour in the history
of the two countries.

Cotton-Mill Strikers Are
Preparing for a
Siege.
Non-Union Men Who Are Out
May Not Receive Suffi
cient Support.
All the Operatives in New England
Watching the Outcome of
the Struggle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 18.â Grim determina
tion on the part of both sides, coupled
with a defined issue between employer
and employe, as well as practically an
absence of any sign of demonstration,
were the features of the second day in
the great strike in the cotton industry.
As yesterday interest centered almost
entirely in the strike at New Bedford,
where the disturbances led to the belief
that a similar demonstration might be
attempted to-day. Nothing of the kind
occurred and the strikers strength
ened their cause by making the ques
tion- of fines a definite issue with the
millowners. It is just possible that an
agreement in this question may lead to
some satisfactory ending of the whole
matter in that city.
The matter of financial support to the
strikers was generally discussed, not
only in New Bedford, but in Biddeford,
Baco and Lewiston, and while the union
strikers seem to have no anxiety re
garding the next three months, non
union men who are out fear they may
not receive sufficient support.
In Fall River the superintendent of
the King Mill, where there is a strike,
went so far as agreeing to remedy
union grievances, but other than this
there appears no break in the line of
manufacturers during the day.
The 100.000 operatives in all six of
the New England States are watching
the contest in New Bedford, Saco and
Biddeford very clusely.
BIDDEFORD. Me.. Jan. 18.â The
strike situation here is unchanged from
yesterday. The Pepperell. Laconia and
York mills remain shut down, and th- r->
is every indication of a long struggle.
A committee of York operatives will
call on Agent Page to-day and endeav
or to secure an adjustment of their
grievances on account of the reduction.
USWIBTON, Me.. Jan. IK.â Every
thing was quiet at the Lewiston cotton
mills to-day. At the Androseoggin, the
only mill where trouble exists, a crowd

CONSPIRACY
DISCOVERED

orable uniform of the Spanish army"
desired to raise disturbances against
the Government of Spain at a most
critical period for the Spanish cause
in Cuba. Up also threatened them, as
a representative of the cnrwn and com
mander-in-chief of the army, with se
vere punishment for the crime of
treason.
The Governor General's words great
ly impressed the colonels. The Count
of Diana, a well-known Spanish irre
concilable and the oldest among: the
colonels, was selected by them to re
ply. He said that the loyalist Span
iards in Cuba, who had devoted their
whole lives to preserve the sovereignty
of Spain in the island, were not satis
fied with the new regime.
Here Blanco interrupted him in a
thunderous voice, saying that Jie WOUM
not permit the least reflection cm the
Government by colonels under his com
mand and subject to military discipline.
The Count of Diana then yielded, and
protested against what he said was a
calumny on the volunteers. He avow
ed that the volunteers are most loyal
to their Queen and their flap.
Blanco made all the other colonels
one by one ratify these final words of
the Count of Diana.
It is officially declared to-day that "a
spontaneous declaration of loyalty was
made by the volunteers to the Gov
ernor General, who is entirely satis
fied."
An officer from the palace went this
morning foy order of General Blanco to
Lieutenant Colonel Calderon's house,
and commanded him to immediately
present his resignation from the Fifth
Battalion of volunteers. He did so,
and it la just announced that Calder
on's resignation has "been accepted."
No further riots have occurred in
Havana, but the city is still under mil
itary control of General Arolas, and
presents the same warlike aspect.
The opinion of all persons here who
know the Spaniards is that the situa
tion is very grave. If the conspiracy
of the volunteers has been averted by
General Blanco's opportune interfer
ence, it is not less certain that their
feeling of hatred against autonomy is
growing more and more every day. and
as the regular army is in a state of
great discontent and demoralization, a
serious military outbreak is to be ex
pected at any moment.
NEW YORK, Jan. IS.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The Democrats will advocate immedi
ate action on the Cuban matter by
Congress, while the Republicans will
express their conviction that the ad
ministration will not long delay, and
that action by Congress would only
complicate matters. " As all amend
ments are out of order, the talk will
amount to nothing more than to give
members of the House an opportunity
to fill the Congressional Record with
belligerent speeches for home con
sumption in their districts. The
speeches, however, give emphasis to
the pressure that is being exerted by
Cuban sympathizers throughout the
country in favor of intervention. There
is a growing belief on the Republican
side of the House that some executive
action will be taken.
A Republican member of the Com
mittee on foreign affairs told me this
afternoon that he believed the Presi
dent was about to serve notice upon
Spain that unless peace and order
should be restored wftnln sixty or
ninety days, the T'nited States would
intervene to establish, peace.
SANTA FE MAY
HAVE A RIVAL
Indications That Another
Railway Will Enter
San Diego.
Committee Which Obtained a
Franchise Is Moving in
Secret.
Believed to Have Strong Assurance
That Its Plans Will Be
Successful.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PAX DIEGO, Jan. l<vâ Citizens of
San Diego are much interested in the
mysterious moves being made by a
committee appointed by the Chamber
of Commerce, looking toward the con
struction of a railroad from this city
to the Colorado River, as a competitor
of the Santa Fe. This committee con
sists of U. S. Grant, Captain ML Sher
man, W. N. King. ML A. Luce, A. E.
Nutt and C. L. Josselyn. The City
Council last night granted a franchise
to this committee, giving it terminals,
depot grounds and rights of way
through the city on a line parallel w ith
the bay.
The committee has been at work for
some weeks, keeping its doings entirely
t. and not even announcing its
time or place of meeting. The Council,
in granting the franchise, asked the
committee for information as to its
purpose, desiring to know whether oth
er railroad corporations or private capi
tal had been induced to favorably con
sider the enterprise. But the gentle
men declined to make anything pub
lic, telling the Councilmen that they
would have to grant the franchise on
faith alone and on confidence in the in
tegrity of th^ committee. The Council
I ted this statement, and gave the
franchise, which is a good indication
of the strong desire <.'f this city for a
direct Eastern outlet.
The personnel of this committee Is
very high. Everybody knows v. S.
Grant, by name at least. Captain Sher
man is ex-Mayor <>f the city; M. A.
Lure, an ex-Judge, is one <>f the most
highly respected men In the city and
prospective Postmaster; "W. X. King, a
well known capitalist, has been promi
nent in working tor San Diego's inter
ests as has also <\ 1,. Josselyn. A. E.
Nutt is a prominent lawyer and Alder
man. Being a city official, his name
floes 'not appear as one <>f the holders
of th<> franchise from the city.
Speculation in the absence of known
f;i<ts is of course rife as to the real
moves going <>n under the surface.
Some citizens have openly declared it
somewhat more than a coincidence that
th>- railroad scheme was launched sim
ultaneously, almost, with Mr. Grant's
Senatorial hot m. Whil" this may have
been, and probably was. entirely a co
incidence, it is nevertheless a fact that
the leader of a succesfal movement to
secure a direct Eastern railroad from
San DiegO, can have the Senatorshiv or
anything else hÂ» likes, so far as San
Diego can pi\o it to him. Mr. Grant,
who is personally of a retiring dispo
sition, has become very well known to
his townsmen through his connection
with this railroad project, and if it suc
ceeds, he will be beyond question im
mensely popular.
Captain M. Sherman, chairman of the
committee, told the Council last night
that the committee was hard at work
gathering statistics, and. with the fran
chise, in hand, would be able to deal
with outside railroad corporations. Hut.
so far .is can be learned, no actual ne
gotlationa an- yot in progress. The
committee, at least, conveys this idea.
T'nder the terms of the franchise tho
road must be located through the city
by January 1, 1599, and the work com
pleted by another year. Th^ right of
way is similar in terms to tho Santa Fe
right of way. hut the Santa Fe has the
advantage over the new proposition in
having had lands of a present value of
at least 13.000,006 granted as an induce
ment to come to San Diego.

ABOUT RAYMOND
Strong Testimony Against the
Second Baden Murder
Suspect.
Witnesses Who Convicted Winters
Repeat Their Stories in This
Trial.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD (ITV. Jan. IR.-The trial
Of C. H. Raymond for murder was con
tinued to-day, and will probably bo ended
by to-morrow night. The testimony is
iout the same at that given in the
Winters case. The story of the attempted
robbery of Robert Ferritcr in the Grand
Hotel at Had. n by Harry Winters and
the shooting of C. A. Andrews by C. H.
Raymond at the fame time Is being told
by the name witnesses. Winters was to
day produced in court, and was identified
l>y a number r.f witnesses who saw him
in company with Raymond, who w,as also
identified on the day preceding the
murder.
Patrick Forriter and James McNamara
t..-d;iy described the crime a-s it took
place in the Grand Hotel on November
17. John Gallagher, who conducted the
autopsy on th<; body of C. A. Andrews,
described the result. C. P. Richardson,
a motorman and conductor on the elec
tric line from Holy Cross Cemetery to
Baden station, identified Raymond and
Winters as two men he saw on the after
noon of the 16th of November on the
road kmlii X toward South San Francisco.
John Munroe testified to having seen the
defendant at the Arcade Hotel in Baden
on the 16th. Rachael Tennabaum and her
son told how they exchanged two cheap
revolvers for a Smith & Wesson hammer
less with Winters in October last, and
Identified the weapon recovered from
Raymond as one or them.
Attorney Kirkbride did not question the
witnesses to any extent, as it only had a
tendencey to make them more positive.
He did, however, question Patrick Per
riter as to the amount of light shed by
a candle such as Andrews held on the
fatal night, and lighted a candle for com
parison. The witness could not compare
them, as one was used at night and the
other by day.

LED A DOUBLE
LIFE FOR YEARS
The Late James L. Clark
of Santa Rosa Was a
Bigamist.
Deserted Wife and Son in On
tario to Flee With Another
Woman.
Steps Being Taken to Transfer His
Property to the Rightful
Heirs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 18.â Thirty years
aero, when Santa Rosa was hardly dis
cernible on the map, James L. Clark
and his wife arrived here and settled
in this city. They came from Anna-
P^e, Ontario. As Mr. Clark was suc
cessful in business and led an exem
plary life, it was not long before the
couple enjoyed the confidence and re
spect of the entire community. About
two years ago Mrs. Clark died. Last
fall Mr. Clark also passed away, and
in settling up his estate it was discov
ered that the woman with whom he
had lived all these years was not his
legal wife.
From Attorney W. S. Williams of
Berkeley, who visited this city this
afternoon, the facts in the case were
learned as follows: Thirty years ago
Clark was a well known resident of
Annapee. He was engaged in business
in that city and had an estimable wife
and one son. He suddenly disappeared,
abandoning his family, and with him
he took a woman who had been for
some months residing at that place.
She became the second Mrs. Clark. No
trace of the missing man was ever
found, although a determined search
was made for him for years.
When Clark died he left a considera
ble estate, which he left to his nieces,
Earla Terrell. Harriett Gill and Edna
Terrell of Ferndale, Humboldt County.
In some manner Clark's executors
heard of the true state of affairs and
an investigation was begun, with the
result that Attorney Williams visited
this city this afternoon and began the
preliminary work of securing an- order
to set aside the property for the bene
fit of Clark's first wife and his son,
who Is now about 35 years of age.
The affair has caused a great deal
of comment here, where Mr. Clark and
the woman who was supposed to be his
wife were well known. About ten
years ago Attorney Williams, who was
formerly Mayor of Annapee and knew
Clark well while he lived there, hap
pened to meet him on the streets of
this city. Recognizing him at once he
questioned Clark as to his actions since
leaving home, whereupon Clark broke
down and cried like a child.
WORK OF NICARAGUA
CANAL COMMISSION
Surveys Will Take More Time
Than Those Made in
1893.
Eleven Parties in the FiÂ«Â«ld and
Work Proceeding at Various
Points Along tVie Pacific.
Copyright, 1598, by James Gordon Bennett.
GERRITOWN, Nicaragua , Jan. IS.â A
heavy norther and rainfall is delaying
the work of the Nicaraguan Canal Com
mission. The Newport, with a cargo of
laborers from Port Limon. was obliged to
put to pea three days ago from her an
chorage outside the bar for safety. She
is now lying at Monkey Point, thirty miles
up the coast, but is expected hack daily.
When she comes the commission will go
to the interior, distributing laborers
among parties working along the San
Junn River and in that vicinity.
The work will take much longer than
that of the commission of UK, and the
new commission will have a vast amount
Of data, much of it new. to examine in
making its report. Eleven parties are
now in the field, 200 men in all. The men
are working at various points all along
to the Pacilic. Work up to the present
has been chiefly in clearing the line of
the canal and making observations- of the
rainfall and evaporation and the gaug
ing of streams. The officers of the New
port will make an exhaustive survey of
the harbor and coast soundings. The re
sult of tho work on the harbor may cause
a suggestion for a change of the entrance
to the canal, though it is not probable
that the suggestion would be as radical
as that of the 1S!O commission. Sixty
men are working in the vicinity of Ochoa,
near the location selected for placing a
dam across the river, which was so se-
verely criticized by the commission of
1895. Bearings are being made and other
observations made looking to the rinding
of the best site, but some other way than
the proposed dam may be found for solv
ing that particular part of the canal
problem. The commission is favorable
to the project, but purposes making a
complete examination of all its features
and conditions before making a report.
KANSAS CITY. Jan. IS.â During to
day's session of the Nicaragua canal con
vention resolutions were adopted urging
on Congress the necessity of legislation
to secure the permanent construction of
the canal. The resolutions recite that
the opening of such a water way would '
jsrently increase the nation's commerce,
wouldstimulate activity in shipyards and
would double the effective value of the
United States navy. A committee was ap
polntod to visit Washington and person
ally urge the necessary legislation. The
committee appointed includes S. C. Cobb,
Florida; Senator E. B. Watson, Nebras
ka; H. M. Moore, Iowa; and P. A. Buel,
California.
Another committee, with C. W. Paul of
Nebraska as chairman, was appointed to
arrange for a meeting at Omaha next
fall.
A permanent executive committee was
appointed, with ex-Governor Fishback of
Arkansas as chairman.
To-night the delegations departed for
Port Arthur as the guests of the Kansas
City, Plttsburg and Gulf railroad.

Senatorship to Be

Now There Is a Prospect of a
Deadlock in the Legis

Eleven Republicans, Backed by the
Democrats, May Prevent a
Decisive Ballot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANXAPOLIS, Md.. Jan. 13.â The first
ballot in the Maryland Legislature for
a successor to Arthur P. Gorman in the
United States Senate was taken to
day, each branch balloting separately,
with the following result: McComas 34,
Shaw 11. Shyrock 3, Findlay 2, Parran
6, Mulliken 1. Barber 6, Urner 1, Gor
man 43, Lowndes 1, Page 1; total 109.
Absent â Republicans 2, Democrats 3;
necessary to choice 55.
The candidates are Judge Louis E.
McComas of Washington County, Ma
jor Alexander Shaw, General Thomas
J. Shyrock, ex-Congressman John V.
L. Findlay all of Baltimore City;
Thomas Parran, Colonel J. C. Mulliken,
Isaac A. Barber and Milton G. Urner.
But one ballot was taken, and this
leaves the situation as much involved
in uncertainty as it was before the
voting began.
The preliminary skirmishing has
been attended with great bitterness
and dissension in the ranks of the Re
publicans, who have a considerable
majority in both houses. These dis
sensions have rendered it impossible to
bring about a Republican caucus and
there seems to be little probability that
this method of settling the dispute will
be resorted to in the near future.
The first break in the Republican
ranks came two weeks ago. when
eleven members of the House of Dele
gates from Baltimore City refused to
caucus on the speakership. and by ef
fecting a coalition with the Democrats

elected one of their own number to
that office. Numerous attempts have
since been made to get the seceders
back in line, but they remain firm in
their position. Without at least two
of their number the Republicans are
powerless to elect any one, and with
the aid of the Democratic vote the
"faithful eleven," as they have been
nicknamed, may at any time elect a
man of their own choosing or cause a
deadlock until the end of the session.
With this possibility in view the Dem
ocrats are using every possible means
to foment the discord.
Such a situation naturally gives rise
to all manner of conjectures and specu
lation, and there are many who believe
that it may yet be possible for Senator
Gorman to succeed himself, if he can
carry the next legislative election in
November, 1890. This possibility is,
however, admitted by the Democratic
leaders to be a very remote one.
Mayor Malster of Baltimore, while
not an avowed candidate, it is certain
that he would not be averse to wear
ing the toga, and there is much talk
here to-night concerning the possibil
ity of another coalition between the
Democrats and the "Malsterites" and
"faithful eleven." for the purpose of
electing the leader of the anti-organi
zation wing of the Republican party.
That such a thing is possible there is
no doubt, and it is freely asserted that
Senator Gorman and his lieutenants
will try their best to bring about such
a result whenever it is demonstrated
that a deadlock is no longer practica
ble.
To-morrow at noon balloting will be
resumed, this time in joint session, and
will be continued until a result is
reached. It is generally conceded that
there is no reason to expect an elec
tion this week, as Judge McComas, the
leading candidate, is believed to have
polled very nearly his full strength.
McKENNA'S CONFIRMATION
TO OCCUR ON FRIDAY,
When Action Is Taken by the Senate He
Will Be Promptly Sworn in by the
Chief Justice.
WASHINGTON. Jan. IS.â It appears
now that there will not be more than
four or five votes against MeKenna's
confirmation when it is taken up again
next Friday. Allen of Nebraska is th<;
only Senator who is making any fight
against it, although Senators Pettis and
Pettigrew may vote against confirmation.
Allen has received long telegrams from
the Pacific Coast. One of the telegrams
is from A. L. Rhodes of California, who
was at one time a candidate for <^hief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Califor
nia and who was defeated, although the
Republican candidate for Governor was
elected by B,ttX) majority. The opposi
tion of Rhodes is not likely to cut much
of a ligure when this becomes known to
the Senators. There is not the slightest
doubt of Judge MeKenna's confirmation
on Friday. He will be immediately sworn
into office by the Chief Justice.NICOLINI,

denly to-night to hasten to the bedside
of her dying husband. As it has hap
pened, she will arrive to find him dead.
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â The late Sig
nor Ernest Nicolini married Mme. Patti
In 1896. She had been divorced from
M. Louis Sebastian Henri de Roger de
Cahuzac, Marquis de Caux. Nicolini's
health began to fail him in the early
paw. of last year, and it was reported
that he was suffering from a cancerous
affection and from a complication of
other disorders.
He went to Brighton, England, from
Craig y Nos, Mme. Patti's residence In
Wales, and then to Langland's Bay,
where his health showed some signs of
Improvement and gave his friends
ground to hope for his recovery. For
several months, however, he had been
slowly growing worse. He finally be
came terribly emaciated and was con
fined altogether to his rooms.
At his removal to Pau his malady
soon developed more serious symptoms.
Both he and Mme. Patti were now
aware of the fatal nature of his illness,
and the friends who saw them together
described the absolute devotion of the
two as touching in the extreme. Nico
lini could scarcely bear to have her out
of his sight for a moment. He did not
care to be read to, or sung to, or talked
to; but simply to lie listlessly with his
eyes following her about the room.
Mme. Patti of late has rarely left
him, except for flying trips to fill a few
peremptory concert engagements.
Although Nicolini was at one time a
lycic tenor of fair rank, and made a
favorable impression In Italy and
France in a dozen operas, his title to
fame or notoriety for the past decade
has been the fact that W was the hus
band of Patti. Soon after the diva's
divorce from the Marquis de Caux she
accepted an offer of marriage from Nic
olini. It is said that he had a few
weeks before sung in opera with her,
and his strug-gle to sustain himself in
the higher notes and his disastrous
failure excited Patti's sympathy, and
this was followed by an affection that
was said to be sincere, even if platonic,
Pigrnor Xieolini had luxurious apart
ments at the castle at Cralg-y-Nos, and
allowed his wife to have her own sweet
way in everything. Patti was not sat
isfied with her marriage to the Marquis
d? Caux, and so when she wedded Nic
olini sh<j had the marriage ceremony
performed four times â a civil one, Ro
man Catholic, Greek Church and Angli
can or Protestant Episcopal.
Nicolini was born In Italy about fif
ty-two years ago, but lived for a long
time in Paris. There he met. wooed and
won his first wife, who died just at the
nick of time so that he could marry
the greatest cantatrice of the century.
By his first wife he had three children,
two boys and a girl, and it is to the
credit of Patti that she adopted Miss
Nicolini and aided the two boys to en
ter a military school and so secure their
present rank of captain and lieutenant
In the French army.

to Take Part in the
Proceedings.
Several Witnesses Who Are
Called on Refuse to Give
Testimony.
ANTI-HAN N A MAN SCORED.
Burke Declared â¢ Traitor to the Party
and Unfit to Serve Among
Investigators.
Special Dispatch to The Ceil.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 18.â The Sen
ate Committee to-night began Its In
vestigation Into the charges of bribery
made by Representative Otis during
the recent Senatorial contest. The
members of the House Committee ap
pointed to investigate the same charges
were invited to be present, but they
did not participate officially and there
will be two separate investigations. J.
J. Sullivan, H. M. Daugherty and Cy
rus Hullng were present to represent
Senator Hanna, Major Dick and oth
ers, but the committee voted 4 to 1
against allowing any counsel to par
ticipate.
The committee in executive session
decided not to hear any attorneys, and
adopted other rules of procedure. It
! was decided to hold executive sessions
j for business and to take the testlmony
iln public. The committee went from
j the committee rooms to the Senate
! chamber when it was ready to hear
witnesses and a crowd awaited them.
The committee consists of Senators
Robertson, Finck and Long, Demo
j crats, and Senators Burke and Gar
; field, Republicans. Senator Burke was
j one of the leaders of the opposition to
j Senator Hanna. Senator Garfield is
! the only member of the committee who
voted for Hanna, and the votes taken
were 4 to 1.
Senator Burke presided and Judge
; Robertson examined the witnesses. In
â  the executive session Judge Robertson
was appointed prosecutor. All mem
bers of the committee answered ques
tions except Senator Garfield. There
j were four witnesses examined to-night
ias follows: Samuel Pentland, pro
| prletor of the Neil House, where Sena
: tor Hanna had his headquarters;
Shepherd M. Dunlap, manager of the
Western Union Telegraph Company;
\V. K. Truesdale, manager of the Pos
< tal Telegraph Company; Frank Ross,
manager of the Tel. phone Company.
Nothing new was developed during
! the session of four hours. The wit
nesses refused to answer some ques
j tions and to produce their books and
; copies of messages. Mr. Pentland re
, fused to produce his books to show
who paid for rooms at the Neil House
| and for other expenses and was given
until to-morrow night to do so.
Manager Ross wanted to consult his
superior officers before telling who was
connected with the private telephone
; in the Neil House by their long dis
tance lines, and he was given more
time until to-morrow night.
Managers Dunlap and Truesdale
| were given until to- morrow night to
. produce copies of telegraph messages
i sent by the managers of the Hanna
i campaign.
In the Senate to-day there was a
! sensational and somewhat unexpected
I outcropping of the bitterness engen
! dered by the Senatorial fight. When
the standing committees were report -
| ed Senator Alexander presented a for
] mal protest against the placing of
i the name of Senator Burke of Cuya
hoga County, the only Republican
i member o ' the Senate who did not vote
i for Hanna, on the committee. In his
! protest Senator Alexander among
i other things said:
"I hereby desire to record my earnest
protest against the placing of the
name of Vernon H. Burke upon com-
I mlttees of this Senate upon which
I honorable gentlemen ' have been se
i lected to serve. To force by the ma
. Jority votes of this body the associa
tion of this betrayer of party trusts
with those whose honor and sense of
duty would shrink from such conduct
is to offer a reward for treason to
party, to principle and to American
| manhood. I protest against the viola
tion of party and personal pledges, and
I hereby declare it my duty to hold the
; party who voluntarily placed his
i pledges before the people In securing
: their votes as fully responsible to them
'. as he Is morally responsible to his
Maker. And for these and many other
reasons dear to American citizenship
| I here and now enter this protest
i against the enforcing of this political
, traitor into the presence and company
! of honorable men."
DEMONS TRA TIONS CONTINUE

PARIS, Jan. 18.â There were renewed
attempts at a student demonstration in
front of the newspaper offices and the
Military Club, but the police dispelled the
crowd.
There was much agitation in the Latin
| quarter, but the police barred the bridges
and all attempted demonstrations were
suppressed.
The organizing committee of yester
day's meeting at the Tlvoli VauxhaU has
decided to hold another meeting on Sat
urday next and a public demonstration on
Sunday afternoon In the Place de la Con

M. Clemenceau's paper, the Aurore, was
publicly burned in front of the Military
Club at Bordeaux. The poiice were
roughly handled and th*> guards finally
charged the mob. Thirty-two arrests
have been made.
Telegrams from most of the large towns
show that the antl-Jewlsh crusade is as
suming most menacing proportions. The
Government is seriously alarmed. An
other attempt, it is said, will be made in
the Chamber of Deputies on Saturday to
overthrow the Cabinet.
LYONS, Jan. 18.â To-day the students
made a riotous demonstration in front of
the synagogue and the Jewish shops,
breaking shop windows and raising men
acing shouts. The police had great diffi
culty in dispersing them. Hand to hand
encounters were frequent and there were
many arrests.

LIVERPOOL, Jan. 18.â The Liver
pool Chamber of Commerce pave a
banquet to-night to Right Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain. Lord Strathcona and
Mount Royal were also present. Mr.
Chamberlain was greeted with an ova
tion and a special cheer was given for
Mrs. Chamberlain, who was with him.
Mr. Chamberlain In the course of a
vigorous and Important speech re
ferred to the great changes In com
merce during the last twenty years.
He Bald: "Since the great powers wore
bitten with the megalomania with
which the Germans are accustomed to
taunt us, as If It were our exclusive
peculiarity, the German empire has In
creased six fold and the French four
fold, while England has only added a
modest third to her colonial empire."
Answering the argument that It Is
useless to colonize barren wastes he
pointed to the magnificent enterprise
of the Canadian Pacific Railway that
had opened up a vast country of the
greatest wheat fields, and was about
to open what was, perhaps, the gold
fields In the world.
"Looking to the certainty," he said,
"that we are likely to be excluded by
hostile tariffs from any country where
the British flag does not float, our
present policy Is to take a very firm
attitude and to maintain free mar
kets. What the foresight of our ances
tors has done for us In building a
great empire, we must continue to do
for ourselves. This is not the policy
of aggression nor lawlessness. We have
a three fold duty: First, to keep what
rightly belongs to us; second. In Lord
Rosebery's admirable words, 'to peg
out claims for posterity,' and, third.
If any one tries to rush those claims,
gently to prevent them." LLaughter
and cheers.]
Referring to the fact, "our sacrifice
of territory and our general forbear
ance and deference to the sensibilities
of our allies have only resulted in our
being told that we are the best hated
nation in Europe," he repeated Lord
Salisbury's warning, "there is a limit
to this forbearance."
After a repetition of the old Zollver
ein operations, which ha described as
"less absurd than some have supposed."
Mr. Chamberlain said: "We must seek
in our own family the strength and
support we shall never find from for
eign nations, and with this in view we
must be ready to respond to any Colo
nial overtures, without seeking pecu
niary recompense, but looking to the
wider interests of the futurV
Then came the weightiest portion of
the speech. Mr. Chamberlain reviewed
at length the West Indian question and
the report of the Royal Commission
thereon, and emphasized the "great in
jury of the bounty system which, while
ruining the West Indies, brings a gain
estimated at two million pounds yearly
to Great Britain."
The Government, he said, believed the
country "generous and Just enough to
remedy thiÃ crying injustice." He was
glad that Belgium had anticipated
Great Britain In calling a conference
on the subject and hoped this might
succeed better than former conferences.
There were many objections, he con
tinued, to countervailing duties, which
would "involve us in commercial treaty
differences with foreign nations," but
the main objection was that while the
trade they wished to save amounted to
260,000 tons, Grat Britain's own sugar
Imports amounted to 1,500,000 tons. It
seemed unscientific to benefit the
former by injuring the latter.
"Therefore," he said, "the Govern
ment has decided to exhaust every al
ternative before having recourse to
such drastic measures, and feeling that
the recommendations of the commis
sioners, though good, would not work
quickly enough, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer has consented to propose to
Parliament a very large grant in aid to
the West Indies. The grant will not be
so large as the incidental gain Great
Britain derived from the bounty sys
tem, but it will be large enough to en
able the industry and the population
to tide over a crisis, until Continental
nations recognize the impolicy of the
bounty system."
Mr. Chamberlain expressed his con
viction that the immediate relief meas
ures to be proposed in addition, which
he said he could not as yet explain in
detail, would "stimulate the sugar in
dustry and enable all well-managed es
tates to hold their own, while tending
to the ultimate prosperity of the col
ony."

NEW YORK. Jan. 18.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Official an-
nouncement has at last been made that
the controversy between China and
Germany has been settled. The an-
nouncement was received to-day by
Minister Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese
diplomatic representative in Washing
ton, in a cablegram from the Tsung Li
Yamen, dated yesterday at Peking. A
statement given out by the Minister in
regard to its contents reads:
"A settlement of the difficulty with
Germany has been effected. Kiaochau
Bay is to be leased, a belt surrounding
the bay extending 100 11 (about thirty
miles) to be the boundary. AH the
German troops outside the prescribed
limits are to be withdrawn. Two of the
culprits charged with the murder of
missionaries are to be punished with
death and the rest with imprisonment.
Permission will be granted for the
building of churches in the cities of Tsi
Ng, Tsao Chow Fu and Chu Teh, and
dwelling houses for missionaries in
seven places in the districts of Tsao
Hien and Shan Hien will be erected, for
which purpose the sum of 225,000 taels
will be allc/weu. This amount is to be
taken also as a compensation for the
killing of missionaries. The sanction
of the throne has been obtained to the
above mode of settlement."
Minister Wu declines to discuss the
terms upon which China has settled
her trouble with Germany, but it is
generally believed that he has felt all
i along that the Berlin Government,
i while ostensibly s^.-king redress fur
outrages perpetrated upon her mlssion
! Aries, was really after a port on the
| Pacific. In official circles the indemni
ty which China has been compelled to
, pay Germany is regarded as excessive.
The distribution of missionaries
throughout the province of Shan Tung
shows conclusively, it Is believed, that
Germany proposes to fly her flag over
the entire province in the course of
time. At present she is restricted to "a
belt surrounding Kiaochau Bay. ex
tending about thirty miles." Where
this belt shall be measured from and
what steps have been taken by China
to prevent encroachment by the Berlin
Government are questions that are be
ing asked by officials and attaches of
the Chinese legation. It is said at the
Chinese legation now that if Germany
has formal possession of Kiaochau, she
will be the one to make the necessary
regulations for the government of the
port, and it must be to her that the
United States must make any repre
sentations it may desire looking to the
free access of its commerce to that
port.
LONDON, Jan. 18.â A special dis
patch from Peking Bays: China is
ready to open three new treaty ports
and to agree to an extension of rail
way into Hun Xan province, but de
clines to agree to the exclusion of other
powers than England from the Tang
Tse Kiang valley. The Peking corre
spondent of the Times says: "The Rus
sian charge d'affaires, M. Pavloff, pro
tests strongly against the opening of
Talien Wan, but China is apparently
anxious to obtain British financial as-
Bistance and will give ample security
for the repayment of a loan. She will
also permit the extension of steam
communication on inland waters and
will grant Increased trade facilities at
all open ports."

PALO ALTO, Jan. 18.â The arrest
of Professor Dudley at Santa Cruz on
the 6th of this month on a charge of
passing counterfeit money was made
the occasion for lectures to-night on
the laws of California, which make un
just arrests and prolonged detentions
of this description possible. The speak
ers were Dr. Jordan, Professor Abbott,
head of the law department, and Pro
fessor Brun, until recently attached to
the French department, but now an at
torney of San Francisco.
The title of the lecture was "Lettres
de Cachet in California. Better Known
as the John Doe Warrant. "Which Al
lows a Constable to Make Arrests at
Pleasure," or, as Dr. Jordan expressed
it, "a writ used in California which
enables constables to reap fees."
Dr. Jordan first gave the circum
stances of the arrest and detention,
and commented on the disgrace and In
justice of the entire proceedings.
"The noticeable point of it all," said
Dr. Jordan, "is that a man within forty
miles of his home could be legally ar
rested without any suspicious circum
stances and detained not only a few
hours, but days. This thing is going
on continually. A man would as soon
kf !i eld up by a foot Pad as a consta-
The president spoke of the efforts
made by a certain constable to steer
the professor into the hands of a Santa
Cruz lawyer, who would defend him
'These alliances." he said, "are ex
tremely detrimental."
Professor Brun first reviewed the
provisions of the county government
act. especially those sections of the fee
system which dealt with the salary of
Justices and constables and which gave
the latter officers mileage, lie showed
the expenstveneos of the system and
said thÂ»re was no redress for false im
prisonment except by knocking' down
the constable as Phileas Fogg did the
detective. "The courts," he asserted,
stand by the officers of the law "
Professor Abbott first spoke on the
expense of this part of the fee system
and asserted that it would be cheaper
for Santa Clara County, for instance
to pay the transportation of all vag
rants coming within its bounds than
to^ arrest and rearrest them.
"It is not the constables and Jus
tives," he said, "who deserve criticism
but the system."
He thought the only way to remedy
the matter would first be to repeal the
vagrant law and put the Justices of the
Peace on a proper and sufficient sal
nry, for they are very necessary of
ficers. He would leave the constables
as they are. The nature of their du
ties, he believed, was such that they
would not be so efficient on a fixed sal
ary. With this change he thought the
expense would be decreased and many
vagrants saved from becoming crimi
nals through contact with convicts.

preceding maternity a woman takes proper
care of the organs upon which the perpetu-
ation of the race depends, she insures the

this. The proper medicine is at hand.
Over 90,000 women have testified in writ-

of the " Favorite Prescription " than of all
other similar medicines combined.
" I am anxious to add my testimonial to tout
'Favorite Prescription,' "writes Mrs. C. G. Bran-
don, of Fort Grant, Graham Co., Ariz. "I had
been using the ' Prescription ' for several months
previous to my confinement, and I am sure I

during confinement I hud not the least symptoms

AN EXCITING
CONTEST IN

in a Parliamen

Amendments Made to the
Consular Bill in Behalf
of Cuba.
De Armond's Struggle to Bring
Up the Resolution Recog

IS RULED OUT OF ORDER.
Appeals of Lenders Cause the Repub

6pÂ«ela! Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 18.
Cuba had a hearing In the House to- !
day, and for a time it looked as if par
liamentary precedents would be set !
aside and the Senate resolution rec- j
ognizing the insurgents as belligerents j
would be attached as a rider to thÂ»Â» dip
lomatic and consular appropriation bill.
De Armond, a Missouri Democrat, pre
cipitated the issue by offering the reso- j
lution as an amendment, but a point !
of order against it was sustained. De
Armond appealed. He urged the Re- j
publicans who had professed friendship !
for the struggling Cubans to override \
the decision o-f the chair as the only
chance of securing action on the propo
sition. Bailey, the leader of the minor
ity, and other Democrats joined in the
appeal. The excitement became in- j
tense, but the appeals of Dingley, the i
floor leader of the majority, as well as j
other Republican leaders to their asso- >
ciates not to join in the programme i
succeeded.
Colson (R.) of Kentucky warned his ;
side that unless he was soon given an ;
opportunity to vote his sentiments on
the <"Ã¼b;m question he would co-oper
ate In any revolutionary method to se- j
cure action. The Republican tactics ;
kept to the front the point that the mi- j
nority were seeking to override the
rules of the House, and they got every I
Republican vote, sustaining the chair j
by the vote of 152 to 114. A Democrat, j
Fleming of Georgia, voted with thorn,
on the ground that he could not vio
late his oath by voting against the
rules. During the debate Bailey chal
lenged Hitt to give the House any ns
suranoes that an opportunity would be |
offered to vote on the resolution passed
by thÂ« Senate at the last session, but
he received no reply. Before the diplo
matic bill came up the army bill was
passed.
Hitt. chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations, called up the diplo
matic and consular appropriation bill.
Bailey objected to any limitation on the
general debate. The Mil carried $1,729,
008, an Increase of $33,700 over tho law
for the current year.
As soon as the enacting clause had been j
read De Armond (D.) of Missouri offered '
an amendment to recognize the Cuban in
surgents as belligerents. Hitt raised the
point of order that the amendment was
new legislation and obnoxious to the
rules of the House.
De Armond, speaking to the point of
order, said he fully understood the rules
of the House, which were designed to
suppress, when desired, the will of the
House. The chairman of the Foreign Af- ;
fairs Committee might, he said, feel con
strained to raise this pojjit of order, but
he reminded the House that there still
resided in its Judgment the power at any I
time, at any place, on any bill, to place \
what the House believed should be there, j
For months, he declared, those in control i
of the House had declined to allow the I
House to consider what the people of the
country, without regard to party, de
sires, namely, thÃt Congress consider and
act upon this question of recognizing
the belligerency of the struggling patriots
In Cuba. When the people of the coun
try felt as they did It was the duty of the
members to override these petty little
rules which had been used to suppress
action.
The newspapers wore filled daily with
harrowing tales of starvation and
' cruelty in Cuba. Should we emulate the
example of Nero, who fiddled while Rome
burned, and supinely and indifferently
stand by when men almost within sight
of our shores were fighting valorously
for principles as holy as patriots ever
espoused or heroes ever defended? He
taunted the Republicans with being sub
servient to those who desired to prevent
action on this question. Futher inaction.
he insisted, was a disgrace to American
â  manhood.
The autonomy offered by Spain, he de
clared, was a revolting mockery, a sham
and a delusion. He warned the other
Bide that the queston could not bo evad
ed or dodged. With this opportunity be
fore them they could not go back to
their constituents and plead the rules as
an excuse for non-action. He was pro
ceeding to denounce the administration
for following the example of its prede
cessor In sending out the United States
navy to hunt down the sympathizers
with struggling Cubans.
Steele (R.) of Indiana and Hitt both
called the attention of the chair to the
fact that De Armond was not discussing
the point of order.
De Armond said he well understood
this, but he would not flinch from his
purpose. He would say no more. But if
the point of order was sustained he de
clared that it was his purpose to appeal
from the decision of the chair and give
the House the opportunity to determine
this question for itself. He felt con
strained to do this, he said, out of a
sense of public duty.
Bailey, the Democratic leader, re-en
forced the views of De Armond, nrgulng
that a proposition to recognize a state
of war in Cuba was certainly germane to
this bill. It had been his purpose, he
said, to have offered the same Cuban
belligerency resolution as an amend
ment. The climax of his speech came
when he offered to withdraw the amend
ment if Hitt. the chairman of the For
eign Affairs Committee, would give as
surances that the Senate resolution would
receive consideration within a reasonable
time. The Democrats applauded this
challenge. He paused to await Hitt' a
answer, but Hitt did not rise.
"The gentleman" (Hitt), added Bailey,
"is as silent as the Republican party on
his question." Again the member*
cheered end the gallery also applauded.
Then Hitt arose, but Instead of reply-
Ing to Bailey's challenge he called thÂ©
attention of the chair to the fact that
Bailey was not discussing the point of
order.
"It is an attempt to have two general
debates," said he. The Democrats jeered
this statement. Hepburn, in the chair,
then sustained the point of order, where
upon De Armond, in order to get the
question before the House in a better
form, offered the Senate Cuban resolution
as an amendment, and when It was over
ruled, made his appeal from the decision
of the chair.
By this time the greatest excitement ex
isted In the House. The galleries had fill- j
Ed to overflowing:, messengers had been I
sent scurrying i<> all quarters of the Capi
tol to summon Republicans who were, ab
sent from the hull. It was evident that
there was foar on the part of the House
managers that the House might be car
ried off its feet on this first occasion of a
test of the sentiment toward Cuba.
The House manajiprs made their fight
for regularity of proceeding. The Speaker,
who was in the lobby, came Into the hall
ami helped to rally his followers. Ding
ley, the floor leader of the majority, took
the floor. He characterized Da Armond's
appeal from the decision of the chair as
a most extraordinary proposition. It was
a proposition to overrule the rules and
establish a new mode of procedure, he
said, and to destroy the orderly transac
tion of business.
"Many a time."' he was saying. "I might
have been tempted for partisan pur
poses "
"Then the gentleman concedes that this
is a partisan question." shouted Terry
(D.) of Arkansas, "that the Democrats
are on one side and the Republicans on
the other?"
l>inKley waved Terry aside and paid no
attention to the interruption, which the
Democrats had applauded. Dlngley ap- j
pealed to his side of the House to sus- i
tain the rules of the House. The Repub- j
licans indicated their support by warm !
manifestations of approval.
De Armond pot the floor again, and in
reply urged members of both sides of the
House to vote # 'to free this House for
one hour from a dominion so absolute
that it is impossible to get consideration
for any matter, no matter how important
or urgent, without the consent of those in i
authority in the Hniisp."
"It peems," be added ironically, "to be
OUT loftiest duty to observe the petty i
shifting rules of the House, no matter :
where they lend or what the exigencies |
of the time demand."
Again at this point Hltt protested that
the debate was not on the question be
fore the House, and again the minority
Jeered.
"I am sticking afl close to my text."
Shouted He Armond. "as the gentleman
from Maine (Dinaiey) did." *
De Armond declared that no code of
rules should violate the plain dictates of
humanity and decency.
Simpson (Pop.) of Kansas interrupted
to state that the Speaker himself had
Violated rule 10 by not appointing the
committees fn>m the House.
ll'Miderson <K.t of lowa, a member of j
the Rules Committee, answered with
spirit and much evidence of feeling. He !
salil the Missouri member (De Armond) !
was npain lecturing the House. He was
interrupted by De Armond. and the .-..!
loquy was fast as to alleged promises '
that the new cede of rules would be pre
, When at one point De Armond .
got a round of applause, and Henderson
exclaimed, "It is your political buncombe
that you are applauding. ThÂ«-re is no
committee in this House so mighty as to ;
ad or retard action unless the House is ,
behind it. And there is no man bo
mighty as to retard action unless a ma
jority of the House is behind him."
The confusion redoubled as the debate
proceeded, many members contending for ;
the floor, while the area in front of the |
Bpeslter's desk was crowded.
Henderson gave a parting shot by de
claring that if a majortly of the House
desired action on the Cuban resolution
It \\"Uld find means for action.
"But if a majority is against action on
that resolution. " ho added, defiantly,
"thi n that action will not be taken, de
spite the tine play of the gentleman from
Missouri."
A brief clash occurred between Bailey
and Dingley over the procedure in the
l>r- sent case.
Lewis (D.) of Washington gave a
breathing spell by making a long speech
on precedents favorable to the Cuban
amendment. The Cuban theme tempor- j
arily disappeared, and Cannon <R.) of Il
linois and others discussed the parlia- I
mentary status.
"If the Cuban amendment is not in
order," asked Bland <.L>. > of Missouri, of j
Cannon, "how can the question bo J
brought before the House so that we
can vote on it?"
"I am not required to answer how you
must proceed." answered Cannon, amid j
derisive laughter from the Democratic j
side.
"Do you yourself believe this amend
ment is" in order?"
â¢V<s, I do." responded Bland, "because
this is the only way we can get at it. It
I is a law of necessity just now."
Again the debate drifted on to' a prolix
contest between Bailey and Dingley over
parliamentary procedure.
Lacey .(R.) of lowa argued that the
minority could ill afford to counsel the
defiance of the rules of the House. The
rules were for the protection of the ml-
nority.
Fleming (D.> of Georgia declared thnt
while he was in favor of aeknowl.
the Independence O- Cuba, he had sworn
to support the rules of the House, and
he could not bring himself to overthrow
them. These remarks earned for him
several rounds of applause from the Re
publican side.
Immediately a break occurred in the !
Republican ranks when Colson (R.) of
Kentucky denounced the inaction of the
House on the Cuban resolution, and the
applause was transferred trÂ» the Demo
cratic side. This was shortlived, though.
as Colson concluded his remarks t>y
declaring that he should vote to uphold
the decision of the chair. "But I warn
my Republican friends." he added, "that
we have delayed too long the recognition
of the Insurgents. If we do not we will
be swept out of power, and If we are not
given the opportunity to act I, for one,
will .loin any revolutionary tactics in or
der to cast my vote for Cuba Independ
ently." | Applause. l
After some remarks by Grow CR.) of
Pennsylvania, there were cries of "Vote,"
"Vote/ 1 from the Republican side, but the
debate proceeded for some time.
"When Hitt moved to close debate on the
pending paragraph. Bailey attempted to
make the point of order that the ques
tion was on the appeal and not on the
paragraph, and that Hitt's motion was
not in order, but Hepburn, who was In
the chair, held that Bailey's point of or
der came too lnte. This announcement
was greeted with Democratic Jeers.
"I would appeal from that decision."
said Bailey, "were It not that two ap
peals are riot in order at the same time."
There was no break in party lines on
this motion, which was sustained â 151 to
118. Speaker Reed marched through the
tellers with the majority. The question
then recurred on the appeal from the de
cision of the chair. A soMtary Democrat,
Fleming of Georgia, voted with the Re
publicans to sustain the chair. No Re
publicans voted with the minority. The
chair was sustainedâ ls2 to 114.
No applause marked the announcement.
The clerk proceeded with the reading, but
at the next paragraph, appropriating $175.
000 for Embassadors to Great Britain.
Oermany and France, Williams (D.) of
Mississippi moved an amendment to ap
propriate $.Vino for an Envoy Extraordi
nary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the
Republic of Cuba. The Democrats cheer
ed.
Hitt raised the point of order that the
amendment was also a change of exist
ing law.
Williams argued that as there wa* no
law on this subject, this could not be a
change of existing law.
On this amendment also De Armond
urged the Democrats to assert themselves
and overrule the rules. If the Repub
licans did not. be said, they must ac
cept the responsibility. Professedly for
Cuba, now was the time.
"In the presence of your master, ruler
and leader." he shouted. "In whose pres
ence you scarcely dare to think. T ask you
to give freedom and liberty to Cuba." or
meet your outraged constituency. Let Up
nee which course you will follow. (Up
ro.-irious Democratic applause.)
The chair then sustained the point of
order, and. on motion of Hitt. the com
mittee rose. Tho Indian appropriation
bill was presented, and at 5:10 the House
adjourned.

To-day's open session o-f the Senate
was brief. Practically, the only busi
ness accomplished aside from the
routine proceedings was the passing of
the urgent deficiency appropriation bill.
The measure, as finally passed by the
Senate, carries $1,913,810. The Teller
resolution providing that bonds of the
United Statr-8 may be paid in standard
silver dollars was favorably reported
by a majority of the finance commit
tee, and notice was given that it will
be called up ct an early date. An ef
fort was made to fix a time for the
final vote on the pending census bill,
but was abandoned until to-morrow.
(lalllnger of the Committee on Public
Health and National Quarantine rep
favorably a bill providing for an investi
gation of the subject of leprosy, and it
whs placed on the calendar.
Vest of Missouri, for the Finance Com
mittee, reported the Teller resolution,
which was adopted by that committee
to-day, and gave notice that he would
call it up at an early date.
Platt of Connecticut and Morrill of Ver
mont desired it to be understood that the
report of the committee was not unan
imous.
Daniel of Virginia secured the adoption
of a resolution directing the Secretary of
State to supply the Senate with any in
formation the. Department of State has
respecting the killing of Frank Eppp. a
sailor of the United States ship Olympia,
by Japanese subjects in tho harbor of
Nagasaki, Japan, In December, 1K97, and
to inform the Senate if any steps have
been taken looking to exacting repara
tion.
The resolution presented to the Senate
yesterday calling upon the Secretary of
the Treasury for the reason why the item
of $11,000,000 Interest due the United States
fron the Pacific railroads had been
dropped from his statement, which went
over under objection, was agreed to.
Allen of Nebraska called up liis resolu
tion providing for an Investigation by tho
Pension Committee as to the authority
of the Commissioner of Pensions to pro
mulgate an order that no consideration r>e
given to applications for Increase of pen
sions within twelve months after the
last application had been made.
Gallinger, chairman of the Pension
Committee, announced that he believed
the resolution to be entirely proper, and
It was agreed to.
In accordance with nntire previously
given. Hale of Maine called up the virgent
deficiency bill. The measure, as It passed
tho House, carried 51.741.543: as it was
reported to the Senate it carried $1,891,923,
an increase of 5150.050.
The bill carrying $l,913.Â«10 was passed
after a few amendments were made.
Foraker of the Pacific Railroads Com
mittee asked for consideration of the bill
reported yesterday, conferring upon the
President authority to bid in the Kansas
Pacific branch of the Union Pacific road
at the forthcoming sale.
Thurston of Nebraska announced that
he would earnestly press an amendment
to the measure conferring authority upon
the President to sell the road, in case it
should be purchased by the Government,
and would oppose any authority to pur
chase unless his amendment was agreed
to.
It being evident that the bill would pro
voke considerable discussion, Foraker
withdrew his request lor Immediate con
sideration.
Davis moved that the Senate go Into
executive session.
Carter, chairman of the Census Com
mittee, said he desired to call attention
to the notice he had given yesterday that
be would call up for consideration the
pending census bill. The committee, he
Hald, regarded this bill as of great Im
portance and felt that it should be passed
promptly.
"From published statements made by
members of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee." said Carter, "it appears that tho
Senate maybe engaged for perhaps thirty
j days In the consideration of the Hawaiian
: annexation treaty. The census bill ought
: not to be delayed so long as that. Tho
necessity for effecting the prellminarv
arrangements for taking the census is
| evident to all Senators. The Census Com
: mlttee cannot look with equanimity upon
i a possible delay of thirty days. My opin
ion is thnt we shall make progress with
I the treaty by promptly disposing of the
, census bill, the consideration of which
will require only a few hours."
Davis, however, insisted upon his mo
tion.
Carter then wanted a time fixed for
' voting on the census bill, but at the re
quest of Senator Faulkner, who spoke for
i the Democrats, agreed to postpone his
request until to-morrow.
The Senate then, at 1:10 p. m., went
Into executive session.
At 4:45 p. m. the Senate adjourned.

The Heavy-Weights Will
Fight Before the Em
pire Club.
Solly Smith and George Dixon
Are Also Matched to
Do Battle.
ThÂ© "Spider" Kelly and Spanjer
Contest May Be Declared
Off.
Tho Empire Athletic Club, managed
by Messrs. Lanigan, Lynch and El
linghouse, has secured a permit from
the Roard of Supervisors to hold a fistic
entertainment in February.
Lynch had an idea for some time that
the Kmpire Club, which was formerly
the Knickerbocker Club, would be
looked upon favorably by the City
Fathers when it applied for permission
to give a pugilistic contest.
He guessed right, for at the last
meeting of the Health and Police Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors the
City Fathers, who had so strongly op
posed professional boxing contests a
w r-.-k or so as", grow suddenly good
of heart and discovered just when the
Empires applied for a permit that a
scrap Viet ween two hard punchers
trma not bo very horrid after all and
they granted the request.
A match was immediately consum
mated between "Tut" Ryan, the Au
stralian, and Joe Choynskl. to take
place on the evening of February 5
at Mechanics 1 Pavilion. Tom Lansing
and Henry Raker, heavy-weights, were
also matched to fl^ht ten rounds on the
same evening*. This will be a prelimi
nary to the big event. Choynskl has
been notified and will leave the
East for this city right away.
Although the Empires were refused a
second permit for a second contest In
February, they nevertheless are san
guine of getting it when the proper
time comes. At any rate, the director
general of the ciub notified Solly Smith
that everything would be O. X., and
that he could prepare for a twenty
round "go" with Sammy Kelly of New
York or George Dixon, the colored
wonder, to take place in the latter part
of February or early in the month of
March. Smith left the city yesterday
with his trainer. Tim MoOrath, for
Hagerty's training quarters near the
Cliff House, where he will remain until
further orders.
The National and Occidpntal Athletic
Clubs will apply for permits to give ex
hibitions in February or March, and
should the Supervisors refuse them
recognition, it la expected that there
will be a hot time in boxing circles, as
the managers contend that "the powers
that be" should not discriminate be
tween clubs, as they are all outâ Just
for the love of the sport.
It was stated last evening by a
sport who is pretty close to one or two
of the City Fathers who are blessed
with powerful arms that the National
Club need not expect to pull off its
lonp pending match between Tom
Sharkey and Jim Jeffries. When asked
fur an explanation the sport said that
the Bailor pugilist was on the black
books of Danny Lynch simply because
Thomas gave Lynch "the cold shake."
and a? a consequence the turfman
won't stand for Sharkey. Lynch has a
bit of a pull with "Colonel" Lanigan,
and when the last named gentleman
nays "no" the negative goes every
time with those who are in a position
to rule the destinies of pugilism in
Fris.
Therefore the bold sailor boy may
have to look to some other city where
less opposition will be shown by the
powers to his prowess as a knocker
out of pugilists.
But Jeffrie* will be taken rare of.
If the National or Occidental club Is fo
fortunate as to secure a permit from
the Supervisors Jeffries may be pitted
against Peter Jackson, the colored
heavy weight champion, who is at
present In training at Croll's garden
in Alameda. Jackson Is getting along
splendidly, and he has numerous
friends In this city who will back him
FtrnnKly against any man In the world,
not barring Bob Fitzsimmons, the
champion of champions.
Frank Burns of the Empire Club of
Vallejo has announced that the Casey
and Ptelzner fight will take place in
Vallejo on the evening of February 1.
Casey will back himself to the tune of
$500, and Stelzner is now looking up a
backer. Burns also states that In case
anything should happen that may
cause a postponement of the contest,
coupons will be Issued to each person
who purchases a ticket and by pre
senting them to him, the admission
money will be returned.
"Spider" Kelly was seen last even
ing relative to his proposed match in
Sacramento with Spanjer. He said that
he had written to the secretary of the
Sacramento Club that unless the club
guaranteed him a purse he would not
meet Spanjer.
"I rlo not go much on this percent
age business." said Kelly. "You know
that if the house should happen to be
smaTl there would not be anything
coming to me and if the club is so pos
itive that good money will be taken
in, why don't they offer a purse? They
can stand a loss better than I can:
don't you think I'm right?"
A dispatch from the secretary of the
club which was received here last even-
Ing stated that the Secramento club
members are disgusted with "the Spi
der's" ways of doing business, and that
they Mrongly believe Kelly is afraid to
meet Spanjer, and now seeks a loop
hole to crawl out of the match. It will
match McConnell to fight Spanjer In
case ii favorable reply is not received
from Kelly to-day.

proceeded to tell the Judge what he

a string of expletives that, even in that

the bailiff of the court, said, 'Bill, are

hit the prisoner with a pair of handcuffs

the Judge, 'See if you can collect the
fine.' The bailiff accordingly went
through the prisoner and succeeded in
bringing to light $100. which he laid on
the desk of the court. 'Prisoner,' said
that august personage, 'I have already

MARIE DRESSIER
A MAGNETIC HIT
She and a Good Company Lend
Fun to "Courted Into
Court."
The f'iece Is of the Usual McNally
Order, but Cleverly
Played.
The fun of "Courted Into Court." like
that of any other McNally farce-comedy,
depends entirely on everybody who is
mixed up In the piece save the author.
To me McNally is the severest possible
test to which faYce-cnmedy players can
subject their skill. It may be for this j
reason that the best of these people
choose to be funny through the medium
of McNally. Certainly success in such
circumstances is precious and unchal
lengeable. Perhaps the sweetest bou
quet we San Franciscans can offer Miss
Marie Dressier, who comes a stranger, is
to acknowledge her triumph in a piece
that could have been made to succeed by
but one other woman under the sun, and
that is May Irwin. In "Courted Into
Court" there is, of course, no plot; and
the absence of this Is not compensated
for by any unusual array of specialties,
nor any noticeable number of good gags,
nor any situations that are, by them
selves, especially comical.
The whole piece, with the exception of
such parts of it as are devoted to song,
depends for life on the sheer personalities
of the players. Miss Dressier is blessed
with a bounding temperament, a heroic
physique, a seasoned sense of humor,
and an air of good-fellowship: she is in
formal without being familiar, and she
sings with jovial vigor an i keen de
scription. . The burden of the entertain
ing falls on her, and she carries it with
happy distinction.
The company is a capital one and In
cludes John G. Sparks, who Is Rtill the
funniest Irishman on the stag*?; fames

sive drunken character, and John C

spite of his epicene antics. 8.

tTcurTnervous dyspepsia.
To Gain Flesh, to Sleep Well, to Know
What Appetite and Good Digestion
Mean, Make a Test of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Interesting Experience of an Indianapolis
Gentleman.
No trouble is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People having it think that their nerves
are to blame and are surprised that
they are not cured by nerve medicine
and spring remedies; the real seat of
the mischief is lost sight of; the stom-
ach is the organ to be looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of the usual symptoms of
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspep-
sia shows itself not in the stomach so
much as in nearly every other organ;
in some cases the heart palpitates and
is irregular; in others the kidneys are
affected; in others the bowels are con-
stipated, with headaches; still others
are troubled with loss of flesh and ap-
petite, with accumulation of gas, sour
ridings and heartburn.
Mr. A. W. Sharper of No. 61 Prospect
street, Indianapolis, Ind., writes as fol-
lows: "A motive of pure gratitude
prompts me to write these few lines
regarding the new and valuable medU
cine, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I
have been a sufferer from nervous dys-
pepsia for the last four years; have
used various patent medicines and oth-
er remedies without any favorable re-
sult. They sometimes gave temporary
relief until the effects of the medicine
wore c.-ff. I attributed this to my sed-
entary habits, being a bookkeeper with
little physical exercise, but I am glad
to state that the tablets have over-
come all these obstacles, for I hayÂ»
gained In flesh, sleep better and am
better in every way. The above is writ-
ten not for notoriety, but is based on
actual fact. Respectfully yours,
"A. W. SHARPER,
"61 Prospect street, Indianapolis, Ind."
It is safe to say that Stuart's Dys-
pepÂ»U Tablets will cure any stomach
i weakness or disease except cancer of

FOR THE YUKON
Sailing of the First Steamer
lor Dyea and Way
Ports.
The Rush Has Now Fairly Be
gun and Will Keep On
Increasing.
All Classes of Men Have the Gold
Fever and Are Destined for
the Klondike.
The rush to the gold fields has fairly
begun. From one end of the water
front to the other nothing can be heard
but "Klondike." From the shipowner
to the wharf rat it Is the word to swear
by, and the ship builders and engine
builders are wrapped up In the sub
ject. In the shipyards the hammers
seem to ring out the word and In the
foundries the furnaces proclaim it to
the winds. The fever is in men's blood,
and whether they go forth to face the
perils of the road or whether they re
main behind content with smaller prof-
Its and fewer risks they all alike dream
of the riches to be found on the Klon
dike.
The steamer Excelsior of the Pacific
Steam "Whaling Company's line got
away yesterday afternoon with a full
passenger list. She was only allowed
71 passengers from this port, and of
that number 70 went away on her. H.
FOR THE KLONDIKE TRADE.
Out of eleven river steamers now being completed in the various ship-
, yards here for trade on the Yukon the above two will be very much alike
when at work. The one under steam is built of steel throughout and will
go to St. Mlohael In sections. The other one is built of wood and will have
a schooner rig and a false keel In order to sail to St. Michael where her
machinery will be put In . All the others will be typical river boats of the
type of the T. a Walker and J. D. Peters on the Stockton route.
Marco wag the odd one, and It was not
his fault that he did not get away on
the steamer. At the last moment he
was taken from the vessel by a Sher
iff's deputy on a charge of attempting
to leave the State without paying his
debts. Marco Is one of a party of seven
Russians who are bound for the
Klondike in search of a fortune. When
he was taken off the Excelsior his com
rades rallied to his assistance, and for
a time it looked as though there would
be a free fight. Marco, however, said
he was willing to face the music, say
ing his arrest was due to spite work,
and that he could easily clear himself.
He promised his companions to leave
on to-day's train and be waiting for
them in Seattle when the Excelsior
gets there. When the s' earner pulled
out into the stream he waved farewell
to his friends and went uptown with
the Sheriff.
There Is space reserved on the Ex
celsior for about 80 other passengers,
who will join the vessel at Seattle
also. Of the total number 27 are going
to Dawson City via the Copper River
country, and the others will make for
the same place via Dyea and Skaguay.
A party from Sacramento headed by
H. Henshaw took ten dogs along with
them, and they expect the animals to
be of great assistance to them in pack-
Ing their outfits over the Cnilcoot
Pass. Miss Ida Brown has changed
her mind about facing the pass this
winter, but Miss dates will press on
and expects to join her brother in
Dawson City next month. There was
almost as big a crowd down to see the

steamer off as there was last year,
when she started on her memorable
voyage to St. Michael.
At the Rlsdon Iron Works they are
working night and day to fill Klondike
orders. Two steel Bteamers for use on
the Yukon are almost ready, and will
be shipped north In sections next
month. They will be fifty feet long,
ten feet broad and will draw fifteen
Inches of water loaded. They will
make an average speed of ten knots,
and will be used simply as passenger
boats. They are built on exactly the
same lines as were the steamers used
in the British military expedition up
the river Nile. They will accommo
date forty passengers and their bag
gage, and are guaranteed to maintain
their speed in spite of the current of
the Yukon. The iron works will send
men to- St. Michael to put the vessels
together when the various sections
reach there.
A party of nine, headed by H. C.
Tabrett. marine superintendent of the
Risdon Iron Works, and Robert Mc-
Elroy. agent of the Phelan building, are
interested in a novel scheme. The San
Francisco Launch Company is building
a boat 90 feet long, 20 feet broad and to
draw 3 feet of water loaded, and with
her they expect to make millions. She
is equipped with powerful engines and
a dredging plant, and it is the intention
o-f the experts to dredge all the creeks
in the vicinity of Dawson.
It was the intentions of Mr. Tabrett
to superintend operations on the Yu
kon himself, but he has changed his
mind, and a mining engineer will go
Instead. Tabrett had his outfit pur
chased, and was ready to start at a
moment's notice when the snow came.
He determined to have a foretaste of
what he would have to encounter In
1 Alaska, nnd getting his outfit together
crossed the bay and spent a night in
the Berkeley hills. It took him all of
next day to thaw out, and now there
is a Klondike outfit for sale, and Mr.
Tabrett is going to stay at home. It
was rumored yesterday that Chief En
gineer Little of the A lamed a was about
' to purchase the outfit . and take It to
[ Australia a^ a sample of what a man
, who does not want to go to the Klon
dike requires.
The Talrett-McElroy party will be
outfitted for a two years' stay in the
: frozen north. The crew will work on
\ shares and the vessel will be their home
' until San Francisco is reached again.
| The vessel will be sailed from here to
St. Michael and at that point her ma-
I chinery will be put in and the ascent
' of the Yukon begun.
The steel steamers being built at the
Risdon and the wooden vessel being put
together at the Launch Company's
yards are very much alike. Both are
almost fiat-bottomed, but tho wooden
vessel will have a false keel put on and
will ho schooner-rigged in order to
reach St. Michael. On arriving at that
point the masts and false keÂ«] will be
â discarded and when tho engines and
smokestack are in position she will look
very much like her Steel sister.
At the Fulton Iron Works four majr
nificent river steamers are being huilt
I for the Alaska-Yukon Transportation
Company. Whitelaw is .building four
river steamers on Spear street for thÂ«>
; North American Transportation Cnm
i pany, the Tnion Tron Works are com
pleting a steamer, th^ Senator, for the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company and
the St. Paul for the Alaska Commercial
Company, while the Fulton will be
called upon in a week or so to put the
engines In the Dirigo, the fine new ves
sel now being 1 completed for Kimball
& Co. These latter vessels are for the
St. Michael trade and all of them will
be ready for business next March.
All the river boats will be sent In sec
â¢ tions to either St. Michael or Dutch
Harbor. The North American Trans
portation Company's fleet will go on a
sailing vessel rind the chances are that
the latter will be towed to Dutch Har
bor, where the steamers are to be put
together. They will then proceed to St.
Michael under th^ir own steam. Many
of Hi*- river steamers are to be fitted
j with tho Baboock & WUco* water
tube boilers, one of which is now on
Fi'lsom-strept wharf awaiting thf ar
rival of the Diri^ro. It came from the
Kast and is the first of its kind to be
| put into a steamer on this coast. The |
Rtedon is building â  number of them I
â  on the TTr-ine plnn and wh^n completed \
1 they will bo shipped to St. Michael, j
The new boilers are much lighter thnn j

THE SAX FEAXCTSCO CALT,, WEDXESDAY, JAXrARY 19, 1898.
UPHOLDS THE
GOLD STANDARD
P. W. Murphy Defeats
the Trustees of San
Luis Obispo.
The Supreme Court's Import
ant Decision on Payment
of Bonds.
The Law as Laid Down by the
Highest Tribunal Affects All
Municipalities.
The Supreme Court rendered a deci
sion yesterday of no small Importance
to the voters of the municipalities of
the State. It deals In no uncertain note
upon the kind of money that shall be
paid in the redemption of municipal
bonds. The principal question In the
caae was whether certain bonds should
be paid In gold coin only or In gold coin
or lawful money of the United States.
The other matter was relative to the
powers of/trustees of cities to specify
; the conditions under which elections
I should be held.
The Board of Trustees of the city of
San Luis Obispo having advertised for
the sale of certain bonds of the city i
for the purpose of paying the cost of \
certain municipal Improvements au
thorized by the voters under the provi
sions of the act of March 19, 18S9. P. W.
Murphy, a taxpayer of that city,
brought this action to enjoin the sale of
the bonds and the levy and collection j
of any taxes for their payment, upon j
the ground that their issuance was ille
gal.
The Superior Court rendered judg
ment against him and for the city and
Murphy appealed.
The appellant presented three
grounds upon which he contended !
that the Issuance of the bonds was ille- I
gal, viz., first, that the bonds were ;
made payable in gold coin of the United
States, Instead of being made "payable
in gold coin or lawful money of the
United States;" second, that at the
election upon the question of their is
suance the votes were not cast in ac- I
cordance with the terms of the ordi- j
nance by which the question was sub- j
mitted; third, that the question wheth
er the interest on the bonds should be
paid annually or seml-annually was not
submitted to the voters.
In the matter of the kind of money
that shall be paid in the redemption
of the bonds the court says:
This section (section 6 of the act of
March 19. ISS9) was amended in 1893. mak
ing the first sentence to read as follows:
"All municipal bonds for public Improve
ments issued under the provisions of this
act. shall be of the character of bonds
] known as serials, and shall be payable
in gold coin or lawful money of the Unit
ed States. In the manner following"; â¢ â¢ â¢
The notice under the ordinance calling
the special election for the purpose of
authorizing the issuance of the bonds in
question stated: "The character of said !
bonds will be what Is known as serial I
and will be payable In gold coin of the |
United States In the manner following
(providing for distributing their payment
over a period of forty years). The rate
of interest to be paid on said bonds will
be 6 per cent per annum."
Continuing, the court calls attention
to the fact that experience taught that
if bonds are payable in currency of a
fluctuating value they are less nego
tiable than if the lender or investor
knows of the precise kind of money
In which he will be paid. The strong
est point presented is in the following
language:
In the absence of any limitation upon the
mode of payment they would be payable
in any lawful money of the United States
and as provision in the bonds giving to
the municipality the alternative of pav
ing them in gold coin or in lawful money
of the United States would create no
obligation upon it to make the payment
in gold coin, it follows that the "lawful
money" in which they would bo Mid
would be that kind which the municipali
ty would elect at their maturity, and con
sequently the kind which at that date
would have the least value. It cannot
be held that the words "Shall be paya
ble in gold coin or lawful money of the
United States were Inserted in the
statute merely for the purpose of declar
ing that the municipality should have the
option at the maturity of the bonds to
pay them in gold coin, or in lawful
money, since it needed no legislative dec
laration to give it that option â¢ â¢ â¢
â¦ v. Th requirement in the statute that
the bonds shall be sold "at not less than
their face value in gold coin of the
United States" would prevent the sale
of a single bond whose payment at ma
turity could be made at the option of
the maker in such currency as it might
then elect, and thus the very object of
the statute would be destroyed Th..
recognized standard of value in this
State is gold coin, and this Is the only
kind of money which the Legislature
has authorized to be received upon a
sale of the bonds.
The second proposition ate the
validity of the election, and the Su
preme Court comes to the support of
the city ordinance in the following
strong language first quoting the cap
tion at the head of the tickets:
Bach voter shall indicate his wish by
writing. or causing to be written or
printed. -"yea" or "no" on the right hand
margin of his ticket, opposite th/proposi
tion on which he may desire to vote in
the absence of any direction, the manner
In which the voter is to Indicate his wish
may be Immaterial, so long as his wish
can be ascertained; but when the mode
of its indication has been prescribed by
authority of law the form becomes a
matter of substance, and courts are not
authorized to say that It may be disregarded
i and that the wish of the voter may be
determined by conjecture. Whatever the
statute requires the form to be is man
datory. â¢ â¢ â¢ The , notice which was
printed upon the tickets that were used
by the voters "to vote for or against a
: proposition, stamp an X in the square
at the right, was authorized, an cave
the voter no right to disregard the man

Upoa the third proposition the court
holds that it in not necessary that this
matter should b>Â» submitted to the vot

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Hard Luck of a Man Who
Sought Work for Weeks.
C. B. Clayton arrived here from
Greencastle. Pa., three weeks ago and
i ever since has been diligently seeking
work. Yesterday morning he got his
, first Job on the steamer T. C. Walker
, and had not been at work ten minutes
! before the gang-plank fell on him and
broke his leg. He was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital and thence
\ to the City and County Hospital.
Peter Olsen. bettf-r known along the
front as "Scow Pete," was drowned
from Howard-street wharf yesterday
morning. He had been working for a
week discharging the coal from the Ca
manche int-> the Marion, and last Sun
day came dow n from Vallejo to spend
his pay. While under the influence of
liquor he fell overboard.
The schooner King Cyrus, owned by
W. O. Hull of San Francisco, has been
compelled to put into Sydney harbor
leaking. She was on her way from
Newcastle. Australia, to Honolulu and
sprang a leak below the water line. She
had to be run ashore to prevent her
from sinking.

Chamber of Conjroerce Meeting.
There was an annual meeting of the
directors and members of the Chamber of
Commerce yesterday afternoon. Owing to
the fact that the officers for the year were
elected some days ago and that the presi
dent's report had already been published
the business of the session was quite brief
and routine. The secretary's report show
ed the same membership as last year,
while the report of the librarian showed
that 100 volumes had been added to the
shelves during the year. During the year
there have been forty-two candidates for
officers of vessels and five for masters.
The committee extolled the work of the
late secretary. Captain W. L. Merry, and
passed resolutions of regret concerning
the death of the late A. E. Hecht.

A REAL LITTLE DEVIL.
DOUBTLESS the Indiana pastor who
preached last Sunda} r on "His Satanic Ma
jesty had a perfect right to do so. If his
congregation had a desire to feel fearsome thrills
chasing up and down their spines, the good man
was aware of it. and conscientiously trying to earn
his salary. That he portrayed in vivid color the
unpleasant personality he had chosen as a subject
there can be no question. He must be blessed with
the gift of imagination, for since the staid and re
liable Luther threw an ink-bottle at the devil, visits
of the prince of darkness have been rare, so rare
that doubts as to the length of his horns have
arisen, and led to profitable controversy. But the
Indiana pastor set him forth as a thing of terror
roaming up and down impelled by no laudable in
tention. The hearers approached a condition of
ecstatic hysteria.
Just at this point a seeming devil rushed up the
aisle breathing fire and a-lashing of his tail. Im
mediately panic arose. The people were willing
to listen to a description of the devil, and to lay
plans how to*dodge him, but they did not want to
see h?m. Sure they beheld the genuine article,
they did not grasp the opportunity to knock him
out. They simply climbed over each other and got
away from there. They left behind a prostrate
stove which set the building on fire, strengthening
a logical belief that the caller had come direct from
the pit and brought a brand with him.
But the truth was that the pastor's son, being un
regenerate, had conceived a plot whereby to have
some fun and he had it. Whether he shared his
father's right to demonstrate in a practical fashion
his idea of the theme selected by the maturer judg
ment of the sire, is a question to be adjudicated be
tween them. While adjudication is in progress
human sympathy will naturally go out to the boy.
He will find that even if being the devil is sport,
part of the ministerial duty is to beat the devil.
The Vallejo woman who came to the city to add
$850 to a $1600 deposit already in bank here, and
was found wandering penniless in the street, is now
met with the accusation that her story of being
drugged was false. There are always those ready
to insult the injured. With the town full of con
fidence men, and people being robbed right along
by them, there is no particular reason for surprise
that a woman should be chosen victim. The
woman's husband has the gallantry to believe her
story, and the dyspeptic outsider can at least afford
to refrain from casting aspersions upon her. It's
none of his business anyhow.
There seems to be little prospect that the lynch
ers of Ãber will ever be punished. One reason for
taking this view is that the men have apparently
been known from the first, and nobody shows any
inclination to do aught to disturb their tranquillity
of mind. The conscience of a lyncher is not be
lieved to be racked by uncomplimentary remarks,
nor his fears aroused by what is technically known
as a "bluff."
Uncle Sam probably knows his own business, but
he can't expect everybody to think so when it takes
the direction of cutting down mint salaries and re
ducing the force of mail carriers. Mint employes
have never been noticed to indulge much in purple
and fine linen, and the chances of the carrier to loaf
are not what makes him seek the job.
"Lucky" Baldwin has been dreaming out the lo
cation of the Klondike mother lode. His belief
that this reaches to the north pole and beyond will
be interesting to science as well as to miners. All
that science will have to do will be to follow the line
of claim stakes, and it will find itself where it has so
long vainly tried to get.
It is a good thing that Zola is to be prosecuted
for his charges against the officers who sent Drey
fus to shameful exile. If Dreyfus is iVinocent, the
fact will be apt to be brought out, and if Zola is
right he will be able to declare it In no uncertain
tone and have the whole world for his audience.
When one Supervisor thinks another is a liar he
ought to refrain from saying so in such manner
that his opinion becomes a matter of record. There
are some things too sacred to be thrust upon the
confidence of the public.
Several of the police courts are suspected of be
ing unconstitutional. If the prospect of being out
of a job renders the Police Judge so glum that he
shall jest no more heaven can be thanked for the
rumor even though it be groundless.
Spain has been told again to "hold aloof." Spain
must be getting accustomed to this admonitron, and
probably if it finds her this time in a humor to hold
aloof, she will do it.
THE REAL ANNEXATION LEADER.
AN evening organ of annexation in this city
has confided to the public the information
that C. P. Huntington, and of course the
Southern Pacific Railroad, is in favor of the an
nexation of Hawaii.
While the frankness of this announcement may
cause surprise, the fact itself excites none. Mr.
Huntington, whose powerful and very comprehen
sive faculties have always been used to his personal
advantage in the direction of his great enterprises,
has always frankly expressed views opposed to
those held by a great majority of the people of Cal
ifornia. Especially has he always openly declared
himself against any restriction of Chinese labor
here. lie used it in his great constructive enter
prises to the exclusion of white labor to an extent
scarcely less than its use on the Panama railroad.
He has on the occasion of nearly every recent visit
to San Francisco improved the opportunity given
by public interviews in the press to insist that our
ports should be opened to coolie labor as a factor
necessary in the progress and prosperity of Cali
fornia. Hence it is in line with his view of public
policy that we should annex Hawaii, where only
some form of Asiatic servile labor can endure the
physical conditions and where low wages make
high profits to the planter and employer.
We have no doubt that if he were asked whether
the annexation treaty holds any guarantee that the
coolie labor now in the islands is to be excluded
from the rest of the country he would scout at the
idea, for few men not professors of public and interna
tional law have a keener knowledge and a sounder
judgment upon such a subject, and none has more
courage in expressing it and taking the conse
quences.
His interest in many ways will be served by an
nexation. He is the owner of Pacific liners. Many
of these ships were built by cheap labor in England
and have been sailed upon a British register and
the English flag only. Only recently he trans
ferred the China to a Hawaiian registry and sails
her now under the island flag, as Tie does the
Aztec and Barracouta. If Hawaii is annexed,
then ships take at once an American register. Wei!
paid labor in the United States did not have the
profit of their construction. That went to the em
ployers of cheap labor in England. The trade be
tween Hawaii and our present American ports will
come under the laws regulating our coasting ma
rine. Ships under foreign flags will be excluded
from it and American ship-builders will get no ben
efit from building American bottoms to supply the
demand; for Mr. Huntington's foreign-built fleet
is all ready to run up the American flag and take
the business.
So, it appears that, look at it in any light, Mr.
Huntington's word for annexation, like that of all
the powerful and selfish interests on that side, has its
motive in the desire to profit by the decadence of
the character of labor and the lowering of wages.
From their point of view, the selfish point en
tirely, this is justified, but is it justified when in
vestigated in the light of public interest?
Have the people of California anr profit ahead
in aiding Mr. Huntington to get an American reg
ister on his British-built fleet, and in letting it com
pete in our coasting trade with the fleets built by
well-paid labor at home? Have the people of this
State any prospective profit in helping Mr. Hunt
ington succeed in his policy of adding to the ranks
of coolie labor in destructive competition with our
white wage-earners?
If they believe that Mr. Huntington has been
right all the time and they wrong all the time, on
their issues, they have a chance now to confess their
errors and aid him. But, if they are firm in the
belief that he is wrong, and that they have been
right, they should see to it that Wasnington is not
startled by their surrender.
We have no impatient or harsh criticism of Mr.
Huntington for thinking, doing or speaking as he
does. It is his right. But against that it is the
right of the people to see and say that his interests
are not theirs.
SAN MATEO ENTERPRISE.
\A OST encouraging from every point of view
/ \ are the prospects for road improvement in
* * San Mateo. The extent of the work pro
posed is commensurate with the immediate needs
of the county, the plans adopted provide for dura
bility of construction with economy of cost, and
the means devised for raising money will enable
the taxpayers to obtain the desired road improve
ments with hardly an appreciable increase of tax
ation over the present rates.
By the plans advanced San Mateo will enter upon
virtually two distinct enterprises of road work. The
first of these will be the opening of a boulevard
from the San Francisco line through the county to
the Santa Clara line. The second will cross the
mountains which separate the county into two parts
and will open up the rich and attractive section of
western San Mateo to easy access from San Fran
cisco and all the flourishing towns in the eastern por
tion of the county.
Surveys made by the county surveyor and a close
investigation on the part of the State Highway
Commission show that these improvements are ur
gently needed and can be easily supplied. The
county abounds with good material for road con
struction, and much of this lies directly along the
routes of the proposed highways, so that the cost
of material and transportation will be comparatively
slight. By reason of this advantage it is estimated
that the ninety-five miles of good road designed can
be constructed at a cost which will entail a bond is
sue of only $3r0,000.
From each of the proposed roads large benefits
will accrue to the community. The boulevard from
the San Francisco line to that of Santa Clara will
really be of State importance. It will form a por
tion of a grand boulevard which will eventually cir
cle the southern end of the bay and form a drive
way from San Francisco to Oakland. When com
pleted such a boulevard will be one of the greatest
roads in America, and will probably surpass even
the grand avenue which is now being constructed
along the shores of Lake Michigan from Chicago
to Milwaukee.
The other road which is to run from a point on
the San Francisco County line southwesterly across
the San Pedro Mountains through Spanishtown,
PeFcadero and Pigeon Point to the Santa Cruz line
will not be so great a thoroughfare, but it will open
one of the most picturesque sections of country
around this picturesque peninsula. It will benefit
the eastern portions of the county by bringing the
people of the western section into closer relations
with Menlo Park, Belmont, Redwood and San
Mateo. thus increasing the trade of those centers.
The chief benefits, however, will come from the de
velopment of the mountain sections. This is cer
tain to follow rapidly, for there are few localities
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1898.
near San Francisco where country homes can be so
romantically placed or so delightfully situated as in
the region through which the road is to run.
When San Mateo begins these works of improve
ment the adjoining counties will be virtually forced
to follow her enterprising lead. San Francisco will
have to extend her boulevard system to connect with
that of her progressive neighbor. Santa Cruz and
Santa Clara will have to do likewise. The move
ment therefore is one in which all this section of
the State is interested. There will no doubt be op
position from the sluggish and wasteful who would
rather spend $2 to patch up a bad road than to pay
$3 for a good one, but this we trust will be over
come without difficulty. The progressive element
won the Folsom-boulevard contest in Sacramento
and we expect it to win an equal victory in San
Mateo.
NEW DEPARTURE IN LICENSES.
THE license ordinance recently passed to print
by the Board of Supervisors, now that its pro
visions have been made public, should be con
sidered without reference to its character as a rev
enue-producing measure. The theory upon which
license laws are enacted is not revenue, but regu
lation and protection. They are framed, not to
add to the incomes of municipalicies, whose treas
uries may at any time be replenished by direct tax
ation, but to regulate the conduct of and afford
the people protection against dishonest tradesmen,
swindling hackmen, hotel runners nnd expressmen.
Among other things license laws are designed to
prevent is an unhealthy increase in certain trades and
occupations.
The ordinance passed to print by the Board of
Supervisors is evidently a revenue-producing meas
ure. Placing a tax of from $20 to $50 a quarter
upon sidewalk cellars in certain portions of the
city cannot be defended on the ground that it is de
sired to regulate such areas; nor can a license upon
projecting steps and show windows be founded
upon anything except a determination to make it
uncomfortable for property owners by getting as
deeply into their pockets as possible. Licensing
signs is more reasonable. Such contrivances are
nuisances generally and their reasonable regulation
by the license device might not be objectionable â
though it must be said that a quarterly tax of from
$4 to $6 is rather a heavy imposition apon their
owners.
We think, upon reflection, the Board of Super
visors will reconsider its determination to pass
this ordinance. License taxation is in a general
way always objectionable. In the first place it is
discriminative. Unlike levies upon real and per
sonal property, no attempt is made to make it uni
foim. It is. in fact, a burden upon business â the
tribute its victims pay for the privilege of making
a living. Every dollar of it comes out of the con
sumers, for licenses are just as much a part of a
business man's calculations as his other taxes, in
surance and store expenses. License taxation
should never be enlarged except it becomes neces
sary to protect or regulate somebody or something.
Whoever devised the ordinance under considera
tion evidently did not comprehend the nature of his
task. In proposing to license sidewalk cellars and
projecting steps and show windows he is plainly in
vading the domain of the Assessor and Tax Collec
tor. Moreover it is probable that neither the com-
mittee which recommended the ordinance nor the
board which has passed it to print understands the
character of the work it hn.s undertaken. An ordi
nance so palpably designed to raise revenue is un
doubtedly unconstitutional.
We have discussed this matter from a legal stand
point. The property n.vners anrt business men
who are to be made the victims of the ordinance
may safely be left to consider its practical features.
Unles? we are mistaken the Supervisors will hear
from them the moment they discover what is up.
1~) ECAUSE of the competition of the cotton
K\ mills in the Southern States, the manufactur-
e rsâ ' ers of cotton goods in New England have or
dered a sweeping reduction of 10 per cent in the
wages of their operatives, and the operatives in re
sistance have struck. The mill owners being
united are irresistible and the workers being united
are immovable. The two have come into contact
and the result is universal smash.
Nearly the whole cotton industry of New Eng
land is involved in the contest. The reduction in
wages extends from Rhode Island to Maine. The
combination includes upward of 150 large mills
and it is said 127,000 persons are affected by the re
duction in wages. The operatives have not under
taken a general strike. New Bedford has been
selected as the scene of battle. All the mills have
been closed there, but in other places it seems to
have been agreed that the work shall go on so that
the unions may have money enough to make a long
and a winning fight at the point they have chosen
for battle.
It is by no means certain, however, that the con
test will long be confined to a single point. More
or less disturbance has been noted in all the cot
ton-mill towns from Woonsocket l,i Rhode Island
10 Lewiston in Maine. The operatives who have
accepted the lower rate of wages have done so un
willingly. Their sympathies and their aid are with
the New Bedford strikers and there may be a strike
along the whole line before the week closes.
The situation is not unexpected. When the re
duction of wages was first discussed the mill own
ers were informed that a strike would follow. All
attempts at arbitration failed. Even that famous
Massachusetts Court of Arbitration of which we
have heard so much of late was as powerless and
as futile in its efforts to stop the advancing crisis as
any volunteer arbitrator who thought he had a rem
edy for all the problems of labor and capital and
rose out of obscurity to announce it.
Of course the parties to the strike on both sides
know their own business better than others. Never
theless it is difficult to see how either the owners
or the operatives can expect to gain advantage over
their Southern rivals by the course they have pur
sued. Reducing wages is a game that two can play
at, and Southern mill men can play it much more
safely than their New England rivals. The reduc
tion of wages seems therefore to have been a foolish
move at the outset, and the operatives have made
the blunder more costly to the industry by forcing
the closing down of mills.
The New England industry is destroying itself
by the course it is pursuing. The Southern mills
will be quick to get the trade the Northern mills
formerly possessed. All business lost by the strike
will go South: and when the strike is over the New
Englanders will have a harder ta<k than ever to hold
their own. There may be some causes that are
advanced by strikes, but the improvement of busi
ness is not one of them.
THE NEW ENGLAND STRIKE.
THE CONQUEROR OF THE KLONDIKE.
This time the Klondike is doomed to
defeat. Waterloo is on tne way. And
Bhe's a woman.
Mrs. Alice Rollins Crane leaves San
Francisco to-night, bound for the a\u.s
kan gold fields. She is also "bound to
win" she says.
What?
Why, money, fame and any other of the
golden nuggets of fortune that may be lying
around waiting for this intrepid woman
to pick them up. Other people approach '
the cruel Klondike with fear, with awe. ! I
even though they may be determinea. But '
*Irs. Alice Rollins Crane is not to be de
terred by such slight things as possible
starvation, frozen thermometers, Chilkoot
passes or the like. She starts on her
way like a conqueror. She's so sure of
success, so full of well-founded faith in
; her own ability that it wouldn't surprise
[ me to hear that the awful pass itself had
; unbent from its right-angled rigidity and
j thawed under the gracious influence of
Mrs. Crane of Los Angeles.
Mrs. Crane was ushering a newspaper
man out of a friend's apartment when
j I entered. She included his leavetaking <
j and my welcome in a word to us both.
"What makes me feel at home with you
( people," she said, "is that I've worked
on the press. They sent for me to come
from New York to Chicago to nurse the
j wounded in the Haymarket riot. I went
into the hospital as a nurseâ a sort of de- j
tectlve, you understand .'âand every day I
; I'd go and make my verbal report to a '
; representative of the paper. Then they'd |
: go and interview the doctors, and they j
couldn't for the life of them tell where j
| the paper'd got its Information. I tell I
I you. it was hard, though. I had to dress j
' wounds and look wise. There were days '
when I couldn't get out to get a bite to |
eat. And they'd told me not to eat at !
the hospital."
MRS. CRANE AND HER KLONDIKE OUTFIT.
"Why not."
"Because, how would It look to have
them say afterward that a reporter of the
paper had been fed by the county?"
I suppose I looked as though such an
argument didn't appeal to me, for she
went on:
"And, anyway, I didn't question any
thing I was told to do. I just went and
did it."
Which is good, soldierly discipline, no
doul.t.
"Well, I won't talk you to death," she
said, as the reporter left; and then, turn
ing toward me, she very considerately
wont over the story which must grow
wearisome with such continual repetition.
But Mrs. Crane does not give to the
reporters a hackneyed, note-learned ac
count of her remarkable self. Her voice
had a slightly raised pitch, due to ex
citement, when she spoke to me. But
she talks fluently, simply; she is thor
oughly good natured, not at all reticent,
and extremely interesting.
"My expenses are paid hy a small syn
dicate of five magazines, to which I shall
send matter. Then I am commissioned j
by the ethnological bureau of the Smith
sonian Institution to gather data regard- j
ing Indian folk lore and all the details to l
be got by living intimately with them."
"Really living with thorn?" I repeated, j
with uncomfortable recollections of Piute
wiikiups and Piute ladies and gentle
men.
"Oh. yes. Why, I've lived with a dozen
different tribes of Indiansâ the Apaches.
etc" She checked the Indians' names
off on her large, strong fingers.
'Why. I'm the only white woman that
ever lived with the Apaches in any other
way than as a captive. I used to think
they let me stay with them 'cause th.-v
liked mo so much. But after a long while
the old chief told me he thought I was
crazy!"
Mrs. Crane chats along, punctuating
her interesting story with many a
laugh She is rather a tall woman, with
quantities of golden hair, which she
keeps brushing back from her white
forehead. She has a fair, florid skin and
a broad, open face; her eyes are small
and keen and blue-gray. Her manner is
altogether unconstrained. She sat and
talked to a circle of women yesterday
afternoon, giving details of her history
and that of her familyâ a most excellent
familyâ in an easy and a very interesting
way. Mrs. Crane must be nearly 40 years
old, and she weighs 170 pounds, so she
told us.
"But when I get to Dyea." she said,
apropos of this, "111 go into trainingâ
with my dogs. " she laughed. "I've got
two dogsâ a beautiful pure Newfound
land and one that's half Great Dane and
the other half Russian bloodhound.
They'll be trained there, and so will I.
And I'm going to lose forty pounds, too.
Why, once in an Indian village I
trained down to ninety-eight pounds, and
I felt fine; could Jump on a horse and
enjey life."
"And your purpose in going to the
Klondike, then, is to study the habits of
the Indians there?"
"That's one purpose. To write Is an
other. And the third is to go as the trus
tee of a syndicate of Los Angeles women,
for whom I shall Invest their money and
benefit by half the profits."
And to provide against the emergency
of their Klondike property becoming
valuable, when it might also become tax
able, these Los Angeles women have in
trusted t" >frs. Crane a very unusual
power. But that wouldn't surprise you if
you saw Mrs. Crane. Conlidence natur
ally clings about such a woman. She

than any dozen men I know. And, be

sides, she possesses "that peculiar charm"
which would make It easy to describe her
as a good fellow if she were a man.
"Will you tell me when you first be
came â a new woman?"
"Oh, don't call me a new woman!"
"You wouldn't want to be called an
old woman?"
"I don't care as long as these old bones
of mine'll get me to Klondike. Why, I
was crazy to go last August. I love to be
out; to rough it. Why, lor two years my
son and I never slept indoors, nor with a
covering, other than brush, over us.
"It's ten years now stnee I came out to
Arizona and began to study the Indians.
I By the way, I'm to have an article in the
: next Arena attacking the Government for
its treatment of the wards of the nation.
, Isn't that funny? But it was written be
fore I knew they were going to commis
sion me to go up there."
"In what way will you Invest the money
I of these Los Angeles women?"
"Oh, buy and sell mines, speculate In
various ways." she said, largely.
"Have you had any experience In mm
I ing?" I asked.
I know very well that that isn't a rea-
I sonable question to ask a woman, but or
' dlnary rules don't hold with such a wo
! man as Mrs. Crane.
"Oh, yes." she answered quietly, as
other women might answer if they were
asked whether they play a musical in
strument. "I owned shares In an Ari
zona mine. The company was East,
though, and when I came out to Arizona
I wrote back asking if I could operate the
mineâ it was closed on account of the de
pression of silverâ if I'd hire my own
workmen. They wrote back yes. And I
could just read between the lines their
scorn of a woman's attempting it. But I
did. I wont to a thirty-second degree Ma
sonâl always go to the Masons; my hus
luiiil and my father were thirty-second
degree Masonsâ and I told him I wanted
him to direct me to a dozen of the best
old forty-niners he knew. He did, and I
tell you they worked for me. They were
all old bachelors, and I was a widow, you
know, and I was boss, and the thing
paid."
Now, whaffc the Klondike going to do
â¢with a woman like that? She's cheery;
she's courageous; she's experienced. She
has the army for her friendâ both her
first and her second husbands were mili
tary men; she has letters from the Cath
olic Archbishops recommending her to the
: merciful care of the Sisters and the mis
i sionaries, should she be ill. She has Uncle
Sam at her back, being his representative.
She has various kinds of newspapers and
magazines behind her. Her best friends
! are a family at Forty-Mile worth half a
i million in Klondike claims, whose hos
â¢ pitable home she expects to reach about
! May 1. She has been toughened and
strengthened by a life of hardship and ad
venture, and she's as full of hope as her
sheeps-wool-llned sleeping bag will be of
her when she lies calmly down to sleep,
without thought of the morrow's dangers
or difficulties.
"And you'll wear " I began.
Mrs. Crane pulled up her skirt and
showed us women the full bloomers and
the high, double-soled boots made spec
j ially for her in New York, that are to go
with various colored sweaters.
"You must have a small foot to bear
such a boot as that," said Mrs. Crane's
hostess.
"I wear twos." the commissioner from
the Smithsonian Institution answered
modestly.
But these tiny feet and the stout dec
laration that she's still a rebel are all
the inheritance Mrs. Crane has from her
Virginian ancestors.
And Mr. Crane?
There Is a Mr. Crane.
"Mr. Crane"s dyspeptic, you know,"
said his versatile wife. "He can't eat
bacon and hardtack."
"Poor Mr. Crane!" I said with sincerest
sympathy. "It's unfortunate that he
can't go with you."
"Oh. I need him at this end," answered
Mr. Crane's wife. "There's a lot for him
to do here. He'll have to send on sup
plies to me, forward my matter, attend
to my business and finish up a book -I
was writing about the Los Angeles
schools, when I left there. Oh, he's recon
ciled to my going now. But if they have
a real good scrap over In China a pub
lisher wants me to go over there as war
correspondent. And Mr. Crane don't want
me to accept.
"He's really the bravest of the two."
she went on, "to let me go. I never saw
him cry before, except when my son
died. If my son hadn't died I never
should have married him."
Which is decidedly flattering to Mr.
Crane. Yet Mrs. Crane is aware of and
admires her husband's many good quali
ties.
"But my son was my companion, my
friend. He worked with me. Illustrated
my matter, lived with me in the desert
and the brush. And then when I went to
Los Angeles, thinking: he needed a couple
of years' schooling, he took cold. Think
of it, after lying out nights and sleeping
in the rain as we'd done, he took cold
from a draughty window fn the school
house and died of la grippe three years
ago. He would have been nineteen if he
had lived. For the first year I couldn't
get reconciled to it,* but now I under
stand," she added gently, "that he's only
gone ahead. We're believers In evolu
tion, he and I."
But not in woman suffrage.
"Politics is so corrupt; getting worse
and worse every day. I say let the women
keep out of it. It'll go clean down to the
bottom soon, and then women can take
hold and buiid it up."
Which is unnecessarily cruel and illogi
cal, it seems to mo.
You see Mrs. Crane is all kinds of
woman. And that's what makes her
puzzling- as well as interesting. She has
all a man'a readiness to take the world
liberally; she is naturally gregarious,
she is not too fine-trained for association
with ail kinds of people; she is what
commonplace persons call good company;
and. as I said before, she's just the fe
male Wellington to bid fortune stand
and deliver. I dare the Klondike to de
feat her.

Business Men Oppose the Tax

Space.
A Measure Before the Board of Su
pervisors That Is Generally
Condemned.
-
. The business men of the city are full
of the wrath born of righteous indigna
tion regarding the new ordinance pro
viding for the licensing of space used
by them under the sidewalks.
To say that the proposed measure has
moused the Ire of the business men
around town would be to put the mat
ter very mildly. As a matter of fact,
it has called forth hot protest from
, leading citizens in all walks of business
('" '. and professional life. Indeed, there
J has seldom been such unanimity" of
) opinion regarding any act of municipal
legislation. On all sides is to be heard
a vigorous denunciation of the ordi
nance in question.
( Colonel John C. Kirkpatrlck, mana
â¢ ger of the Sharon Estate Company, de
clared yesterday that the ordinance
would work an injustice to the store
keeper, whose rent would be raised by
his landlord, in order to cover the ex
pense of the license, and that the li
cense carried an injustice in the way of
. discrimination â ct lack of It. For in
stance, a stationery store, requiring a
great amount of room for the storage
of cheap but bulky goods, such as en
velopes and the like, would have to pay
as much as a hardware establishment
which would store in a similar space
goods worth ten times as much.
Mr. Weister of the firm of Weister &
Go., New Montgomery street, declared
that this ordinance was -very unjust,
and that it would unquestionably work
great injury to the business interests
of the city if it became a law. He said
that the Supervisors might as well and
as reasonably tax a man for using his
back yard.
William Doxey averred that the
adoption of such a measure would se
riously affect all the retail dealers, and j
that, indirectly, the consumer would i
eventually have to pay the license.
A. S. Baldwin declared the proposi
tion one of great danger to the busi
ness interests of the city, and ex- I
pressed the opinion that it would meet i
with a very vigorous opposition on the
part of property owners. :
Mr. Milles of the Owl Drug Company
protested that the merchants would
not tolerate such an ordinance, and
that the citizens would rise up in
wrath against the unrighteous proposi
.. tion.
C. H. Crocker r?f the H. P. Crork^r
my declared the ordinance unjust
for the reason that the building per
mits given by the city practically con
fer the right to use the space under
consideration.
Charles Lynn, 721 Market street, was
loud in his denunciation of the ordi
nance, which he characterized as ab
surd and ridiculous. He thought that
the citizens should rise up in a body
an>l oppose the enactment of such an

A YOUTHFUL VIOLINIST.
Favorite Pupil of Ysaje Shortlu to Make His
Debut In TMs Cltu.
PIETRO MARINO.
Pietro Marino Is a young violinist who will make his American debut In this
city some time next month. He may wÂ»!l br> said t<> be a production of San Fran
cisco, for although he was born in Italy just nineteen years v.go, he cameherewhen
a lad of tender age. and it was here that the seeds of his musical career were
first sown, and they have now developed into full fruition. When be was 16
years old he came under the notice of Nathan Landsberger, who heard him
play at a local concert, and that patron of young and struggling artists, with
quick discernment, recognized the brilliant promise of the youthful violinist
and advised him to go to Europe to perfect his musical education.
Marino accordingly went to Brussels, in 1895, and was Immediately admitted
as a pupil in the Royal Conservatory, where he soon, by his ability and evi
dent desire to attain proficiency, attracted the attention of no less a personage
than Ysaye, who forthwith took him under his protecting wing. The young man
was made a mem!>>r of the Grand Orchestra of the conservatory In the- first
year of his entry to that institution, and he returns with tho remarkable record
of having graduated with the highest honors In the unusually short tlmÂ«"> of two
> ears and a half, and he is now a full-fledged an.l capable violinist. He has won
three first prizes in violin competition- one for harmony, in 1816, another for
technique, in lS9t'>, ami still another for violin study, in INO7. He is possessed of
an attractive presence and great personal magnetism, and has th*Â» added dis
tinction of having been a favorite pupil of Ysaye, in itself no small recommen
dation.
The music-loving public Is awaitintr with Interest the advent of this youth
ful and phenomenal violin virtuoso, and he himself is more Than anxious to
make his first appearance in this city, to which he is fondly attached and which
he has ever regarded as hi.s home.

) Judge Ooffey then interrupted and said that tie could not allow any one to t
throw stones at the genius of the State of Nevada, and requested that the ]
practice be discontinued. The argument then continued, and in a short time
* counsel concluded and the case was submitted. Judge Coffey promptly de- *
> nied the motion to set aside the verdict of the jury, but granted twenty days <
> to the attorneys representing Fitzgerald in which to file a notice
Â« of appeal. Attorney Durst then moved the court to set a day for t
tho hearing of the applications of the stepdaughters of Capron to
admit a will, bearing date prior to that offered by Fitzgerald, to pro- *
* bate. The court was inclined to deny the motion at first, as in event the ver-
> diet of the jury was reversed in the SupTeme Court and the prior will was <
) admitted to probate by the lower tribunal a startling legal complication (
Â» might arise. The court finally decided to hear the application without preju- /
dice to either side on the 4th of February and counsel from Nevada and San

THE DEMANDS
WERE UNSIGNED
Warrants in Favor of the
Teachers' Annuity Fund
Refused.
The Auditor Claims They Were
Issued Under an Uncon
stitutional Act.
The Law Providing fop the Fund In
terpreted as Being Special
Legislation.
Auditor Broderlck has refused to
sign the demands made against the
school fund In favor of A. C. Wldber,
the treasurer of the teachers' annuity
fund, and designated as being one
half money deducted from the teach
ers" salaries. The warrants amounted
to $903 96. and were for the months of
August, September and October of last
year. They were allowed by the School
Board. The Auditor, in returning the
demands to the Board of Education
unsigned, says:
These demands reached this office
some time in December. I have been in
formed that others are in reserve and
have not been allowed by the Board of
Educationâ presumably for April, May,
June, July and November.
The reasons for returning the above
will apply to the others and I desire that
my refusal to draw warrants upon the
school fund in satisfaction of the above
may be considered as applying also to
those not yet presented.
These demands are presented to me for
audit, and my warrant upon the treasury
for their payment, demanded under the
provisions of section 1". subdivision 3. of
"An act to amend an act approved March
26, IM*5. entitled 'An act to create and ad
minister a public school teachers' annuity
and retirement fund in the several coun
ties and cities and counties in the
State.' "
Section 10 of said act provides for the
crÂ«-iuion of the annuity fund as follows:
"(1) Twelve dollars per year from day
school teachers, to be deducted from
their salaries by the Treasurer; (2) all
moneys received by gifts, bequests and
devises; (3i all money, pay, compensation
of salary forfeited, deducted or withheld
from the warrant or demand for salary
of any teacher or teachers for or on ac
count of absence from duty from any
cause, which the Board of Education of
every incorporated city or town, or the
Board of Trustees of every school district
outside of such city or town, may appro
priate and Pet apart (Of the aforesaid
fund; and said Board of Education or
Boards of Trustees are hereby empow
ered to appropriate such moneys, or any
part thereof for such fund; provided that
in consolidated cities and counties after
the establishment of an annuity fund
therein, it is hereby .made the duty of
Boards of Education to appropriate
monthly at least one-half of such moneys
for such fund."
This section Is in my judgment discrim
inating and altogether open* to the charge
of not being: uniform in its application to
counties, cities <>r tnwn or school dis
tricts of the State, and therefore subject
to being considered special legislation.
The act Is in many other particulars spe
cial: notably in sectloil 12. wherein It is
provided that all present teachers may of
their own volition or option assume "the
burden of the act or avoid the same, but
In subdivision 2 of section !l' it provides
aa follows: "In consolidated cities and
c.,ui\ttes it shall be binding upon all
teachers elected or appointed to teach in
the public schools of such consolidated
cities and counties after the passage of
this act."
The act iÂ« not one that applies to all
teachers, but only to those who desire to
provide for an annuity on retirement from
school teaching. It Is In no way connect
ed in a governmental sense with the
school department of San Francisco. The
Board of Education has no voice in its
affairs. The Supervisors or the Auditor
have no authority over its funds, as was
the case under the act of 1R95, and I can
find no reason why the government of
San Francisco should tax Its people to
build this exclusively private fund by ap
propriating from the school fund for that
purpose. On the contrary, I tind some
reason for not doing so in language con
tained in section v Of "An act for the
â nment and support of the school de
partment and to establish the powers of
the Hoard of Education, approved April
27, ISO," wherein it refers to the school
fund, to wit: "\Yhi<*h fund shall be kept
separate and distinct from all other
moneys and shnll only be used for school
purposes.** I am obliged to look upon the
terms of section 10 of the act of iy>7, un
der which I was asked to draw warrants
upon the school fund of San Francisco, as
special legislation, the effect of which
would be the appropriation of public
funds to private uses, aijd In direct con
tempt of Supreme Court decisions on the
subject.
It seems to me that an net wherein
Boards of Education of counties or of
cities, or Hoards of Trustees of school
districts, are permitted in their own dis
cretion as to the appropriation of, or any
part of deducted school teachers' salaries
to â  private fund, and that the Board of
Education of San Francisco, the only
consolidated city and county, are directed
to appropriate monthly at least one-half
Of such deductions, "Is wide open" to the
challenge of being special legislation, nnd
T therefore return the demands and will
keep the "old consolidation act" combina
tion on the lock of the treasury contain
ing the school fund until better advised
as to the power of the Board of Educa
tion to bo appropriate the school moneys.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow files v.-ith the wind. The top fig
ures at Ftati-in indicate maximum temperature
fen the days; those underneath It, if any. the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in inches
and hur.irpith? .luring the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or t nne^t points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
bun. metric pressure an'i is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
-â¢â ssure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. IS âPrices were slaught
ered in the afternoon trading on the Stock
Exchange to-day, especially those properties
Including local traction lines, which were most
benefited by the market's buoyancy yesterday.
Prices opened with fractional appreciations in
sympathy with London, which traded moder
ately both ways, but buying slightly more than
they Bold.
Large operators were not very active in
the local market until the late trading. There
appeared to be a general undertone of strength
in the parly transactions, but the temper grad
ually changed and rumor-mongers were not
idle. Among other efforts to depress the mar
ket there was Circulated an unfounded Btory
th.-v the United BtAtM Minister to Spain had
Bought the protection of the British embassy
at Madrid. Realizations of profits by large
interests aided the bear raid, uncovering stop
loes orders, and the market closed at or near
the lowest and very weak.
The Senate Finance Committee's approval of
the decision drclarlng for the payment of Gov
ernment bonds in either gold or silver was used
by trader? an a bear card. The resolution pre
sented in the House in the form of an amend
ment for the recognition of Cuban belligerency
wbs not known until near the closing hour.
In the general list the decline from the high
point ranged from one to two points, but the
net losses in moxt cases were fractional. Easy
money and fa\ arable statements of railway
earnings had little Influence on prices.
Tho bond market was well held, despite the
heavy liquidations in the stock market. The
Isfuos which have been conspicuous In the
dealings of late continued to vibrate very vio
lently. Total sales $3,840,000.
Government bonds showed some hesitancy,

LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK. Jan. 18.â The Evening Post's '
London financial cablegram says:
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach's speech at Swan
sea last night, declaring that England would
I have her rights in China even at the cost of
â  war. although approved here, had some effect
: In checking market activity, and except for
Grand Trunks and Americans prices for all
' stocks, Including consols, were generally lower.
The markets, especially mines, were, also ad
versely affected by the Paris flatness. Ameri
cans, after a period of firmness, closed duller.
Germany again bought Northern Pacific, but
sold Canadian Pacific. New York absorbed
NÂ»w York Central. Grand Trunks were boom
ing on largely Increased business. I under-
Btand that Illinois Central hinds have gone
well. The Paris Bourse was flat on the anti-
Semite riots. The Berlin market was steady.
I have reason to believe that the Bank of Ger
many may lower the rate to-morrow to 2 per
cent. I believe that the financial position In
I Vienna, is far from satisfactory. There was â 
, released from the bank to-day Â£250,000 Japan
i ese money.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 18.â Wheat got a good send
off from the early cable news. May was
wanted at from 91%@91Hc at the opening,
against 90 7 4fi91c at the close the previous day.
The Liverpool quotations were advanced %id
per cental overnight, and the reason given for
it comprised several items of considerable im
portance. The poorer crop prospects in India
were mentioned as the chief item. Heavy
rains In Argentina were reported to be unfa
vorable for Wheat and the Continent was said
to be taking the arrived cargoes off coast In
the United Kingdom. London quoted cargoes
on passage and offered S'JMd higher. Paris re
ported uO centimes reduction In the price of
Flour and 10 centimes in Wheat. Minneapolis
and Duluth receipts were 360 cars, against 37S
the week before and 268 the similar day of 1897.
Chicago got 63 cars, two of which were con
tract. Advices from the Northwest were to the
effect that, with splendid roads, farmers were
delivering very little and country elevators
were being gradually emptied by the Induce
ments being offered In the way ofj>remlums
for cash Wheat over futures. â¢*
Considerable activity was Imparted to the
dealings in the July option by the buying of
that future by Allen Grier against sales for
May. The operation was supposed to represent
the taking In of spreads for a group of St.
Louis speculators. July opened at 81c and was
advanced to S2'Â»c by the undoing of the St.
Louis spread, and May, which did not get
above 91SÂ®94c, dropped back to 91V' while
July was making the rise. Bradstreet's rei>ort
of the world's visible supply made a decrease
of 1.631,000 bushels east of the Rockies and
SCO. OOO bushels decrease in and afloat for Eu
rope. The reduction on the corresponding week
of last year was 4,000,000 bushels. The market
weakened on that showing of some reduction
in Europe, notwithstanding the diminish in the
world's shipment during the last few weeks.
The Liverpool market closed with some of its
early advance wiped out. and that also helped
to undo the bullish sentiment that had ruled

the proceedings up to 12 o'clock. Primary
market receipts were 346.550 bushels, against
205.3K3 the year before. Atlantic seaboard clear
ances of Wheat and Flour were equal to 127.
000 bushels. July sold at 82V4c at the close,
and May, after dropping to 91"4 c, rallied and
closed at 91%Â«914c. Â»
Corn was dull and prices late in the day
were inclined to drag. May ranged from 2849
25Â«4 and closed at 28*,.
Oats kept within a narrow range. The mar
ket was firm early, but reacted later. May

THE ORIGIN OF THE TALLY-HO.
As quaint a mixture of words and
interjectlonal cries as I have met with
is in an old French cyclopedia of 1763,
which gives a minute description of the
hunter's craft and prescribes exactly
what is to be cried to the hounds under
all possible contingencies of the chase.
If the creatures understood grammar
and syntax the language could not be ;
more accurately arranged for their :
ears. Sometimes we have what seems
pure interjectlonal cries. Thus, to en- |
courage the hc-unds to work, the hunts- j
man Is to call to them "Ha halle, halle,
halle!" while to bring them up before
they are uncoupled It is prescribed that
he shall call "Hau, hau!" or "Hau, ta- ;
haut!" and when they are uncoupled
he is to change his cry to "Haul la y la
tayau!" a call which suggests the Nor
man original of the English tally-ho. â 'â 
Primitive Culture.

WAS HEARD
Growing Belief That a
Murder Has Been
Committed.
Evidence Is Now Piling Up in
the Case of Joseph
Raeside.
The State and the Knights May Offer
a Liberal Reward for
Evidence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 18.
The Idea that Joseph Raeside's death
whs the result of suicide or acci
dent is daily growing less acceptable
to the authorities as the evidence piles
up. Governor Budd has expressed his
willingness to offer a reward, and the
Knights Templar may also hold out an
Inducement to any one who has infor
mation to come forward and give It to
the police.
Additional evidence has been obtain
ed, and Coroner Baldwin is more cer
tain than ever that Raesid" came to
his death at the hands of others. De- i
tectlve Denny Holland found a man at
Shell Mound last evening who is posi
tive that he heard a scream on the
track about twenty minutes before the
train passed that killed Raeside or
that passed over him after he had be^n
killed by others. This evidence
strengthens th* theory that Raeside
was sandbagged and robbed before be
ing placed on the track.
One of the main reasons for believ
ing that Raepide was robbed is that no
money was found on him. whereas it
is known that on the day preceding his
death he made a good winning at the
races and was well supplied with
money. Coroner Baldwin is certain
that Raeside was murdered and is anx
fous to see a substantial reward of
fered
Public Administrator Knight filed a
petition to-day to be appointed ad
ministrator of the estate of Joseph
Raeside.

BOOTH FORCES
ARE ON NETTLES
Ballington and His Father
Have Not Buried the
Hatchet.
There May Be a Renewal of
the War Between Father
and Son.
Volunteers Fear That thÂ« General's
Friends Are Circulating Evil
Reports.
That there is trouble ahead between
i General Booth and the Ballington
Booth factions of that form of relig
ion of which the general is said to be
the founder, there is no longeranyques
tion In the minds of those who know
the situation.
Mutterings of the coming storm may
already be heard by those whose ears
are net dull. There are many signs
Which have a meaning to those who
know the meaning of signs. The air
is full of rumors, and while there is no
open warfare there are muttertngn that
cannot be mistaken. There may be a
rupture by the time General Booth
reaches San Francisco, in two weeks.
In the ranks of the friends of Bal
lington Booth there are thr>se of strong
fot'linss who rnnnot rpsist the tempta
tlon to do a little talking out of school.
Thesi' shake their heads, as much as to
Indicate thut they misnt say something
if th^Â»y dared. And snme of them do
gay that the old general's schemes for
colonizing the poor were sipnal fail
ures in India. It is also said that he
had financial swamps which were hard
to swim in the United Kingdom, where
his stock is not sellinp at the same
premium it was in the pioneer days.
It is now feared that the friends of
General Booth, though this fear is ex
pressed in the most guarded manner,
will say something or do something by
reason of his coming which will caus-
hard feelings. Fearing that there may
be BOtnething said which will put It in
a bad light, the Ballington Ronth fac
tion of the great religious movement
has taken steps to counteract any dam
aging statements that may be made.
A circular was distributed through
out the city yesterday, bearing the sig
natures of Maud and Ballington Booth,
which' sets forth at length the causes
that led them to leave the army. This
circular states that some of the friends
of General Booth have circulated one
sided reports of the trouble, and that
thppe put the Ballington Booth people
in a bad light.
"If there should be any severe state
ments made by the general's friends,"
said a strong leader of the other faction
yesterday, "'there will of necessity be
many counter statements, and th-=>
whole discussion will be reopened, all
of which we would greatly regret."
FACTORY DISTRICT
VISITED BY FIRE
Miller & Hamilton's Establish
ment Completely Gutted
by Flames.
Adjoining Properties Also Damaged.
Estimated That $13,000 Will
Cover the Loss.
Miller & Hamilton's door and sash fac
tory, 413-4ir> Mission street, and adjoin
ing properties were damaged by fire last
evening to the extent of $15.CÂ»w. The
flames broke out through the roof of the
factory abuut 6:40 o'clock. The glare of
the blaze against thÂ«- sky warned Officer
Hurry ODea, and he turned in an alarm
from box 201. When the department ar
rived the factory, which was a flimsy
frame building, was a seething furnace of
flame and a second alarm was ordered
turned in.
Within a very few minutes after thrÂ«
first alarm was pounded the water tower
was placed near the burning building and
water was about to be turned on tho
flames, when an accident occurred which
delayed matters a few minutes and
whereby several men narrowly escaped
serious injury. A telephone wire snap
ped from the h^at find fell across a trol
ley wire and communicated the current
to the iron tower. As the wire fell across
the trolley it struck Daniel Donovari, one
of the tower operators, on the neck and
knocked him down. His injuries were not
serious, however, and he soon r-jgain^ii
his feet. Beveial other firemen were
shocked and for a time nothing could
be done. Finally Charles Remsche] re
moved the charged wire and the tower
was put in operation.
By this time (he flames hafl communi
cated to <"arl F. Haas' wood and ivory
workn. 417 Mission street, and that build
ins was Boon burning briskly. Henry
Sanders & i'o.'s cooperage establish
ment afljoinine also caupht, but tho
flames were extinguished before it had
been damaged to any >?reat extent. Water
from the tower and several hand nozzles
was kf'jjt playing on tho flames for half
an hour before they showed any signs
Of its effects. In about an hour, however,
the blaze was under control and soon died
out.
The only thin*? that saved the entire
block from destruction was a fire wall
between the door and sash factory and
the Mechanics' mill, which is owned by
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1898.
Wells, Russell Co. The Mechanics' mill
Is a frame building 1 , dry as a tinder ami
filled with extremely inflammable timber,
and had it caught water would have been
of little avail. Chief Sullivan saw such
to be a fact, and he reserved a exeat por
tion of his water to prevent the flames
spreading in that direction, and owing t<>
his Judgment the tiro was confined to a
very s^mall area, considering the nature
of the material of which the buildings
were construe! ed.
It is estimated that HUM will cover
the entire loss. Miller & Hamilton's fac
tory was completely putted, and all the
machinery is a loss. The building, which
was. as were the other damaged build
ings, owned by the Samuel Mover estate,
is ail but a mass of charred timbers and
will not admit of reconstruction. So far
aa known the only insurance on tho dam
aged property is $1000, which is held by
Miller & Hamilton. Insurance com
panies charged 9 per cent for insurance
on property in tho neighborhood of the
fire, and owing to the high rate but few
took out policies, and in consequence the
loss to the owners is almost complete.
Henry Sanders, owner of the damaged
cooperage establishment, died a few days
ago and will be buried to-night. The fire
added greatly to the sorrow of his. rela
tives, but they accepted it stoically and
as a matter of fate.

NOW COMES
THE DIVORCE
Troubles of the Bacons to
Be Brought Up in
Court.
Many Years of Married Life
Have Been Passed in
Quarreling.
The Future Welfare of Six Children
Is Also to Be Legally
Arranged.
Oakland Office San Francisco Can,
908 Broadway. Jan. 18.
Mrs. Mamie C. Bacon has determined
to force matters in the family lltlgra
tlon. She has asked to be divorced
from her husband, Frank P. Bacon,
and charges him wtih desertion and
failure to provide.
The Bacon family troubles have been
In the courts for a long: time, and
clearly show that the various members
of the family were unfitted to dwell to
gether in marital unanimity. The first
time Mr. and Mrs. Bacon went into
court was because of a fight between
them as to how much it should cost to
run the family household. The case
was bitterly contested and all the de
tails nf butcher's bills and candy bills
and all other trifles were aired before
the court and the task was imposed on
the judge of finding out how much a
mother and six children should devour
with normal appetites. During this
trial it was shown that almost from
the wedding day the house had har
bored two people of belligerent natures
rather than a couple dwelling together
in unity.
About five years ago H. D. Bacon, the
father of Frank P., died and left an
estate valued at nearly a million dol
lars. The heirs were his widow, Mrs.
Frank Soule. 'Miss Ella Bacon and the
man now defendant In a divorce suit.
Soon after Bacon's death Frank P. and
his wife separated and she was given
separate maintenance, but little by lit
tle her husband reduÂ«w<l the amount
until she went into court and again the
needs of the wife and her family were
all aired before Judge Ellsworth.
About this time Mrs. Bacon executed
a peculiar movement. Without Inform
ing her husband she dismantled the
Bacon homestead and moved to other
quarters, and when he went to the
house he found It deserted and even
the furnishings and fittings had gone.
Mrs. Bacon declared at the time that
It was necessary for her to rent a
smaller house and try to Increase her
income by leasing the larger one. Up
on her showing In court Bacon was
ordered to pay her $2f)o a month. He
defaulted in this and week after week
orders of examination and similar pro
ceedings added to the family scandal
and the affidavit mill was set to work
until all the secrets of the Bacon
troubles were made putttlc.
Now that a divorce suit is filed some
definite distribution of property must
be decided upon, and should Frank P.
Bacon file a cross complaint the family
difficulties will be delved into more
deeply. _______^^___

THE BOOKS IN
CLOVER AGAIN
Stepabout and Buck Mas
sie the Only Winning
Choices.
Lucky Dog Was Well Backed
but a Collision Ruined
His Chance.
Dolore Given a Close Decisionâ Any
Kind of Going Suits
May W.
A somewhat speckled sort of a card
drew but a small crowd to the races at
Oakland yesterday. Two favorites man
aged to win, but as very little confi
dence was reposed In them the talent
did not benefit to any great extent by
tholr successes. The track was deep
and holding and It took speed and stay-
Ing powers to win purses.
The muchly touted St. George filly
Stepabout came out in the opening five
and a half furlong scramble, and get
ting away from the barrier among the
tail-enders made a big field of fourteen
look like "yaller dogs." She was exten
sively supported at odds of 8 to 1, and
showing first before the stretch was
reached, won eased up to a walk in
front of Flandes. Moringa finished in
the show.
Conloy. astride the 7 to 5 favorite
Judge Btouffer, succeeded In finishing
In the show in the six and a half fur
long sprint following. Dolore was sent
away in the lead to a straggling start
and after being passed by both Ricardo
and Silver State, came again and was
given the decision, although it looked
as though Sliver State won by a nose.
The cowardJy Lucky Dog was played
to beat the fast filly May W in the six
furlong dash, third on the card. He
stumbled soon after the barrier waa
released, and the filly won all the way.
The "Dog" gave up badly the last fur
long, and despite the urging of "Skeets"
Martin, Morinel came along, downing
him for the place. Eight to five was
obtainable about the winner.
With Rubicon out of the way, there
was nothing left in the fourth event
fast enough to make Buck Maasle gal
lop, and at odds of 1 to 4 he won In a
big gallop, several lengths ahead of
Gallant, which horse secured the place
as easily from Flashlight.
Charley Thorpe had but one mount
all day and that was astride O'Fleeta.
the entry of "Plunger" McManus In the
Beconrl clx and a half furlong run. The
geldln? was a 12 to 1 shot in the ring
and through good riding Thorpe got
him to the wire first, less than a length
In advance in front of Aquinas, the sec
ond choice. Polish ran into show.
"Skeets" Martin rode the favorite
about as well as som? ship's apprentice.
A cheap lot of platers lined up In the
concluding sprint on the card. The
winner turned up in Dr. Bernays, an
8 to 1 chance ridden by Johnny Woods.
The favorite Milesio looking a winner
up to the paddock, finished second in
front of Himera.
TRACK ITEMS.
The herpes of J. Xagloe. Burke have
been singularly fortunate In getting close
decisions. To those In close proximity
to the wire it looked as though Silver
State beat Dolore a nose, but the mare
failed to get the verdict.
Shaw was indefinitely suspended for a
dilatory ride astride Flashlight, and the
horse's owners. Farrar and Tuberville,
were warned that in future they must put
up competent riders or remove their horses
from the track.
Sam Hildreth reports that Captl%'e is
hopelessly broken down, and in all proba
bility will never face the starter again.
As the barrier was released "Skeets"
Martin started with a rush nstride Lucky
Dog, and, just after passing the starter.

NO TRUMBO
DIVORCE SUIT
The Matter Not Beyond
the Stage of Rumor
Yet.
An Evening Paper's Silly Story
Marked by an Absence
of Facts.
Colonel Trumbo Never â  Mormon
and His Career in Utah That of
a BunlneÂ«Â« Man.
According to an evening paper, which
seldom permits Itself to be hampered
:by 'facts. Colonel Isaac Trumbo has
been sued for divorce at Salt Lake
City. About this circumstance, which,
by the way, never existed, there has
been woven a romantic story. The
story naturally lacks verity as well as
grammar and the pleasing coherency
possible In a story not largely Imagin
ary. The whole matter Is that C'oJonel
and Mrs. Trumbo agree only on the
] one point that they are happier apart.
There has been no suit filed. They
have simply separated and any suit
' must be a matter of the future. It
would not come as a surprise to either
Trumbo or his friends. The evening
fairy tale had Trumbo not only a de
, fendant, but a Mormon. It had him
, Invested wth great powfr In the church,
and had him living in the Mormon cap
; Ital in all the splendor of a potentate.
But he never was a Mormon. HÂ« was
i born in the Episcopal church and â till
adheres to It. The i>alaoe in which he
] lived in Utah was rented from the
: Federal receiver who had taken posses-
I sion of some of the Mormon church
I property. If there were anything else
; in the evening paper story it might be
! correct, but there is nothing else in it.
Bishop Clawson of Salt .Lake happens
I to be In San Francisco and- to have
I noticed the rumors. As an official of
'â  the Mormon church he feels some in
j terefit In the charge that Trumbo has
j belonged to the same organization. "I
have known Colonel Trumbo for many
â¢ years," said the Bishop last night.
I "He has never been a Mormon. lie did.
In the dark days of the church, conduct
| some business for us, and for the skll!
j with which he did so he is gratefully
i remembered. He Is a self-made man,
much of his fortune having been ac
1 quired in California and elsewhere In
mining. He never squandered the
; money of the church, and bo far as I
know and believe nev^r squandered
his own. I cannot accept the story
published In an evening paper. The
! charges it makes are malicious and in
my judgment untrue. So far as relates
to his public career I am certain about
this."
A dispatch from Salt Lake last night
stated that Mrs. Isaac Trumbo was
arranging for a suit for divorce. Al
though the rumor has been current
for months it has been persistently de
nied. Up to date, however, the suit
has not been filed. Pome time ago a
cloud appeared on the Trumbo horizon,
in the shape of the revocation of a
power of attorney given by Mrs. Trum
bo to Mr. Trumbo. This was then ex
plained by the statement that the pa
per had merely been given to further
a certain sale, and the object having
been attained, the necessity for its ex
istence was at an end.
Judge Powers of Salt Lake, Mrs.
Trumbo's attorney, was asked by wire
as to the truth of the evening paper's
story. He promptly responded that
there was no truth in it. It is under
stood in circles where Colonel and Mrs.
Trumbo moved that the caao will be
Bettled out of court, a statement that
â was virtually confirms! by a brother
of Mrs. Trumbo last night. There is
said to bja an understanding between
the couple tha* if Trumbo can again
gain a fortune his troubles will be at
an end. ,

The skeleton In the closet of the fam
ily of Mrs. Herman P. Rulffs, corner
of Hayes and Laguna streets, haa come
to light through the action of the
mother tn swearing to a warrant before
Judge Low last Saturday for the arrest
of Frederick Winkelman. her son, on
a charge of threats against lifÂ«.
Although the warrant was issued on
Saturday, no effort has been made to
arrest the young man and yesterday af
ternoon, accompanied by his attorney,
lie appeared before Judge Low to sur
render himself, thinking that the Judge
would release him on his own recogni
zance after hearing the circumstances.
The Judge refused to do so and Win
kelman and his attorney left to secure
bonds before surrendering himself. The
Judge's refusal was based upon the
ease of William McLeod, -who was re
leased by him on his own recognizance
on a similar charge and went home and
choked his wife to death.
"Winkelman's father, it appears, died
about five years ago, leaving an estate
consisting of real property on Hayes
and Laguna streets valued at about
$20,000. The widow afterward obtained
an order from the Probate Court to
homestead tho property, having placed
its value at only $:<ioo. The family lived
together in peace and harmony until
about eighteen months ago, when the
widow, apainst the hitter opposition of
her children, married Herman P. Rulffs,
a youner man, and started him in a gro
cery business in a store on the prop
erty.
The Introduction into the family of
the young stepfather has been followed
by acrimony and unplensantness, and
the children are anxious t~ have the
property relieved from the homestead
order, which compels them to live with
the mother, and divided among them.
A petition will be presented to that
effect to the Probate Court probably
to-day, and meantime Fred will insist
upon the case against him for threats
against life being prosecuted, as he
wants the real facts to be known. It is
understood that Mrs. Rulffs has re
gTetted her action in obtaining the war
rant and is anxious to have it with
drawn. _____
Had Lost Jurisdiction.
ThÂ« Superior Court received a setback
at the hands of the Supreme Court yester
day In the case of Rosa Quelrolo, who
asked to be released from the custody of
Sheriff Whelan on a writ of habeas cor
pus. The woman was divorced from her
husband, Frank, and the minor children
were awarded to her. Later the court
modified the decree and gave the chil
dren to the father. She appealed from the
decree, but refused to give un the chil
dren in accordance with the Judge's order.
For this she was placed In custody for
contempt. The Supreme Court held that
the appeal stayed all proceedings and
suspended the power of the Superior
Court, which, by the very nature of the
appeal, took The case out of Its Jurisdic
tion. The woman was released.

OPPOSED TO
THE MONKEY
PARK SCHEME
Dr. Clinton's Course
Approved by Mis
sion Taxpayers.
They Decide toCall aMass
Meeting of Property-
Holders.
How the Appeal Was Made to
Dr. Clinton to Take Charge
of the Job.
SUPERVISORS TO GO SLOW.
Interviews Indicating That They Will
Not Dare to Fly in thÂ« Face
of Public Opinion.
Supervisor CHntrm is strongly sup
ported in his resolute resistance to the
Mission Park and Zoo scheme. Late
Monday evening:, after having return
ed from the exciting scenes in the
board, of "which he was the central fig
ure, a delegation of leading citizens and
large property holders of the district
called at his residence to approve the
course he is pursuing, and to offer ev
ery assistance in their power to defeat
what he publicly and boldly denounced
as in effect a Job fathered by an offi
cial ring.
Yesterday the commendation of Dr.
Clinton's actions took the form of a
primary organization which is to bring
about a mass meeting at an early day
Cor the purpose of protesting against
the apparently reckless determination
of a majority of the Supervisors. The
citizens at the head of the movement
are heavy taxpayers, whose public spir
it and local interests are beyond ques
tion. They do not regard with disfa
vor the proposal as to a Mission Park
and Zoological Garden, but deem the
100 acres now owned by the city and
not more than 1000 yards distant from
the so-called gum tree tract ample for
the purpose after the more urgent ne
cessities of the district have been pro
vided for. What they object to and
will fight to the end is described by
them as a palpable plot to dump on the
yers a tract of land worth not to
exceed one-third the amount of money
asked for it, when a few crafty schem
ers are to be the immediate beneflci
and when the sum required to
satisfy their greed might be appropri
ate to purposes especially gratifying
t<t the Mission district and useful i<
the whole municipality.
aking to this point yesterday Dr.
' 'linton said :
"In the property holders' point of
view I should be as much Interested
in this proposition as the next man,
for I have $75,000 invested in the Mis
sion district. But as I informed the
Supervisors' meeting, I am big enough,
I hope, to rise above my personal in
terests and affirm that the proposal is a
Job I will fight to a finish. Most of
the larger modern cities I have visited
and studied, and I am satisfied that
least of all of them does San Francisco
need expensive parks, or airing places.
Why, we are here like the sailors on
an Immense ship, with a superabund
ance of fresh air blowing over us to
and fro. San Francisco may be
termed justly a great wholesome park
during all seasons of the year. How
ever, I don't wish to be understood as
opposing a Mission park, but why
should the city buy for that purpose
land I know to be worth not more than
one-third the price asked, when it has
a thousand yards away a hundred-acre
tract suitable and ample for a park and
200?
"Other necessities are more press
ing." continued the doctor. "Every
one knows how sorely we are in need
of a public hospital. Our ramshackle
imitation of one is a disgrace. Almost
every day in the year some afflicted
applicant for the shelter and care a
humane government should give is
turned away fur want of accommoda
tions. Those who secure admission
are not decently provided for. We
need a pesthouse. How much has been
said and written on this subject with
out awakening the conscience of those
who should act.
"Is it true that you were approached
by one of your colleagues in the mat
ter of the Mission park and zoo?" was
asked.
"I was misquoted in that particu
lar," replied the doctor. "It was a per
son outside the board who is Interested
in the sale of the property. He wrote
to me saying: that as Supervisor of the
district I was the logical leader of the
movement; that if I would take that
leadership upon myself I would gain
the appreciation of the people; that
I would be rewarded with political
honors and emoluments, and that
doubtless the proposed park would be
named in honor of me. Because I re
fused to be cajoled or coerced into do
ing something I did not deem to be
rightâ that is what I remember hav
ing said â my character was aspersed.
"What hurt those fellows." added the
Supervisor, "was my remarks about
these violated pledges, with which the
people are familiar. They don't like
to be reminded that in the Spring Val
ley Company and Market Street Com
pany assessments they deliberately
presented the corporations with -half a
million of dollars which- should have
gone into the city treasury to relieve
the taxpayers."
SUPERVISOR MORTONâ I voted to
have the tract surveyed. There was noth
ing wrong in that as far as It went It
will give the people an opportunity to as
certain what outside property is worth
and what the owners of this" tract want
for it. But this action on my part does
rot bind me by any means to vote for its
purchase. I never will consent to buy
this piece of land for a park and zoo tin
til I am thoroughly satisfied that a major
ity of the people of San Francisco want
It for that purpose. I could not be in
duced to vote away the public money for
n park when there is a greater necessity
for providing hospitals for the city's sick
and other institutions which we as Super
visors we bound to provide. But if
it should be demonstrated to my mind be
yond any guess work that the people who
will have to pay for this additional pleas
ure-ground really want it. why, then I
shall most assuredly vote for Its pur
chase. .â  i
SUPERVISOR LACKMANN-My opin
ion Is unchanged on this proposition.
I have stated to The Call heretofore that I
was opposed to paying more than twice
the value of this or any other property
that any man or body of men might try to
palm over on the city with a hurrah boom
behind it. If the people must have a
park and zoo in the mission district at
the expense of the taxpayers of the en
tire city, it Is no more than right and
proper that these taxpayers should so sig
nify their wish in the matter. When they
do this, or a majority of them, then will
John Lackmann vote to bring court pro
ceedings to have the tract condemned, but
not before. In any case, nothing could
be done before next November. Accord-
Ing to law the money must be in the
treasury to pay for this land inside of
NOTABLE CHURCH WEDDING.
A Prominent Merchant and His Fair Fiancee Who Will Join Hearts
and Hands.
MISS MAh BAXTER MILLER.
This evening at St. Luke's Mnrshal Hale and Miss Mac Baxter Miller will be married, Rev. Mr. Moreland pronouncing
the words that will make the happy young couple one.
Mr. Hale Is one <>f the most popular of the younger business men of this State and Is a member of the well-known
dry goods firm of Hale Bros. Miss Miller is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Randolph C. Miller. She Is a native of Memphis,
Term., and possesses all the rare charms and exiiuisitf beauty of the typical Southern girl.
Elaborate preparations are being made for the wedding. The church is to be handsomely decorated for the occasion,
pink and white tones prevailing. The bride will he attt tided by Miss Jeanette Conroy, who will officiate as maid of honor,
and Miss Lillian Schroder. Miss Mavbelle Wast of San Jose, Miss Clara Hale, a niece of the. groom, ami Miss Leah Young,
who are to act as bridesmaids. Prentis C. Hale, brother of the groom, will be best man, and Dr. E. R. Bryant. Dr. T. J.
Fraser, Glenn C. Barnhart and Edward G. West, ushers. Little Leland Boruck. nephew of the bride, will be the ring
bearer.
After the ceremony there Is to be a reception at the home of the bride's parents, 1920 Baker street, for which Invita
tions have been limited to the relatives and intimate friends only of both the high contracting parties.
THE MONEY BAGS
ARE FILLING.
THE fifteen thousand mark has
been reached and passed by the
finance committee, and now sums
that at first seemed far and away
above every effort are begin
; ning to bo looked at as possibilities.
I The sixteen thousand that Mr. Coleman
i spoke po feelingly of a few nights ago is
now almost Tn hand, and as the sum
[ grows new prospects of more brilliant
events for the great celebration are un
folding themselves.
The parade will be the feature of the
! day. There will be more troops in line,
; both regular and miniia, than have
| tramped the rough cobbles in many a
year, and the pageant which will follow
the military column will call out nearly
every able-bodied and patriotic citizen of
the cJty.
There will be ten companies of the First
United States Infantry, eight batteries
of the Third United States Artillery, four
troops of the Fourth United States Cav
alry, the brigade and regimental staffs
and the two regimental bands. Following
these will come two regiments of militia
and as many divisions of the Naval ' Mil
itia as can be brought together. The un
usually large line of minila will be as
sured, as a result of the action of the
parade committee in appropriating $1000
to defray the expenses of me out-of-town
companies. A half-rate has been secured
from the railroad for uniiormed men, and
the money will be devoted to the trans
portation of the men.
It has also been decided that the plan
to start the parade at 10:30 o'clock means
pretty nearly all the words imply. The
column shall start at that time, say the
members of the parade committee, and
those organizations which are not In line
at the proper time will have to fall In at
the end of it all. Th.s rule is laid down
thirty days after the Judgment is ren
dered. The rates are not fixed until Sep
tember, and the taxes are not collected
until November, hence there need be no
alarm of the Supervisors jumping at the
zoo bait right away. While I voted for
the surveying of the land, I gave notice
that I would move to amend that portion
which said that the Supervisors had in
tended to instruct the City and County
Attorney to commence condemnatory pro
ceedings. This final clause I objected to
then, and object to still. It entails ex
pense to commence court proceedings,
and, moreover, we have no money to pay
for the land to-morrow even If we agreed
on the price. I say, go slow about heap
ing additional burdens on the people. We
have other and greater necessities de
manding attention at the present time.
Our hospitals are in a very bad condition,
and this comes before the care-taking of
monkeys and polar bears.
SUPERVISOR DELANYâ I stand now
as I have heretofore on the proposition.
I am not in favor of buying tnis, or any
other land, for a park, simply because
some men who may have a piece of prop
erty for sale want to sell it to the city
at their fancy price. When I am satis
fied that the people â the taxpayers out
of whose pocket the money comes â de
sires this or any other property for pub
lic "use, then, and only then, shall I vote
to purchase it. At the best the office of
a Supervisor Is an unthankful one. No
matter which way you vote you are sure
to offend some one, and that one will cry
"boodle." I now say. and am ready to
swear, that I have yet to receive the first
dollar by reason of my position as a Su
pervisor, other than my salary of $100 a
month. If there be a Job In this park
business I know it not. and if I should
find out that there be one I will oppose
it and vote against the proposition

as absolute.
The Chinese division will be tinder the
leadership of Robert L. Park, a well-edu
cated Chinese, who Is Instructor of Eng
lish In a Chinese school In this city and a
ttudent at the State University. He
ppeaks English perfectly and with little
or no accent, and he Is most enthusiastic
over the part his countrymen will take
in the celebration. He has selected as
his aids Leong Poon and Lee Chin. Ah
Chung and Leonard Leon have been ap
pointed aids to the grand marshal. The
Chinese expect to have at least 100 m<"ii
on foot In the parade, besides those who
will be on the big float.
A novel float, representative of Cala
veras County, Is contemplated for the
parade by the miners of Angels ('amp.
Since the Spanish word "Calaveras" sig
nifies "skull," the float will be a represen
tation of a skull, large enough In size to
correspond with the total output of gold
from the county.
Pacific Parlor's Jubilee ball on January
24, at Native Sons' Hail, will be an af
fair of exceptional brilliancy.
The committee of arrangements con

kins. William H. Hazel and Frank Smith.
The committee from the Native Daugh
ters in charpe of the feminine portion of
the celebration met in profoundest se
crecy last night and decided to add to the
costume already selected for the young
ladies who are to ride In the purad* a
white velvet cloak lined with gold, to be
worn loosely over the shoulders of each
fair equestrienne.
The place the ladies are to have in the
parade is giving them some concern. It
is generally understood that they will be
escorted by the Native Sons, but that was
not definite enough for them, and it was
finally decided that they should hold the
place between the Exempt Firemen and
the Veterans. Their float, too, although
it had been already decided upon, was ;l
matter for considerable discussion. They
promise that It will be the gem of the
parade.
P. J. Healy of the Miners' Fair commit
tee called during the meeting with a re
quest from the miners' committee that
the ladies set a day during the fair which
could be devoted to the Native Daugh
ters. A committee consisting of Mrs. C.
J. Rader, Buena Vista Parlor, Mrs. A. E.
Barblch of La Estrella and Mrs. Day of
Golden Gate was appointed to take the
matter in charge.
a survey Vas because 2000 property
owners in the Mission had signed a peti
tion favoring this site for a park. Now,
I think when '2000 property-owners send
in a petition to their representatives in
the Board of Supervisors on this or any
other question it is the duty of the Su
pervisors to at least pay respectful at
tention to it. This is all we have done so
far, a.nd my offering this resolution call
ing for a survey does not in any manner
bind me to vote for its purchase. The
manner in which the board proposes to
dispose of this entire subject by having
it decided in a court of equity before a
jury precludes any possible chance for
Jobbery on the part of the Supervisors
So much for that phase of the question.
As for a change of front on my part,
there Is none. I am undecided now as
to whether I should vote for the pur
chase or not; that comes later when I
find out whether the people, or a suffi
cient number of the taxpayers, want It
or not. If they do they shall have it and
if they do not we will not force It on
them.
SUPERVISOR BRITTâ I have not Bald
that I would vote to buy this property at
present or in the near or distant future
I am undecided as to that, but when a
respectable number of citizens and tax
payers tome with a petition respectfully
wnrdiHl asking for anything in the gift
of the Board of Supervisors which belong
to the general public, as does this. It is
our duty to give the petitioners a re
spectful hearing. The only way that we
as Supervisors, can ascertain whether
the citizens want this tract of land for
a public park and zoo is to give them an
opportunity to so express it. This we will
do before submitting the matter to a
â¢ â¢nurt for condemnation. As for any Job
being in it, I have failed to 6ee it crop
out. There may be a job in it for the
people who want to sell their land to the
city at a fancy price. But it is for the
MARSHAL HALE.
The 'Vltlr Union met and made final
arrangi m< atl for their section of the
line. It is probable that there will be over
1000 m< n from tlio various organizations
forming thf> union. Each man will wear
the distinctive badge of his society. Their
float Will carry thirty-two little girls,
<lr^Â«=sp<i in white and representing Urn
Udrty-two (â â¢ ut.tlc-s of Ireland. There
will also be Jour men to represent the
four provinces and the float will be es
corted by twelve men in armor.
The Pioneen have all been notified that
they will each be given a number, which
will entitle the holder to a seat in a cer
tain hack, and to avoid confusion the
harkmen will be ordered to take no one
who has nut The proper card. As such a
large attendance la expected at the re
ception to be held on the evening of the
24th. hut one ticket, entitling the holder
and two ladies to enter, will be allowed
each member.
The Supervisors of Contra Costa County
have appointed F. L. Glass and T. 1,. Mc-
Mahon aids to the grand marshal from
that county.
Mr. Healy Is busy inspecting dancers
and dancing In order that he may be
properly qualified to select for the com
ing fair. He spent all day at It yester
day, and what pretty dancers he did not
see then he will see on some other occa
sion. He doesn't object to the work, and
says he will have the best If every pretty
foot in the city must kick for his own
Individual delectation.

WOMAN ROBBED
IN HER HOUSE
Cowardly Attack Made
Upon Mrs. Eugenic
J. Goss.
Besides Having Her Pocket
Rifled She Was Thrown
Joseph Gibson, the Robber, Captursd,
Alter an Exciting Chase, by
Policeman Flinn.
Mrs. Eugenic J. Goss, the landlady of
the Tremont House, 523 Keaxny street,
was the victim of a cowardly attack
at an early hour yesterday morning at
the hands of one of her lodgers.
About two weeks ago Joseph Gibson,
hired a room In the house and when
the first week was up she asked him
for the rent, but he put her off with an
excuse that he was Just then out of
funds. The second week expired Mon
day night and after he left she locked
up his room as he had not paid her any
money.
Mrs. Goss officiates as her own night
clerk and about 4 o'clock yesterday
morning she received a visit from Gib
son. He wanted to know why she had
locked up his room and she told .him
that he could not stay there any longer
unless he paid the rent due. Gibson
said he had money in his room and if
she would go with him he would pay
her.
They started to go upstairs, Mrs.
Goss leading. She wore a shawl round
her shoulders and when they were half
way up the stairs Gibson seized the
shawl and threw it over her head and
face, holding it tight with one hand to
prevent her screaming. With the other
hand he took 54 from her pocket and
threw her down stairs. He then ran
down stairs and out of the house. Mrs.
Goss picked herself up and staggered
into the street, screaming for help.
Policeman T. R. Flinn was on Sac
ramento street near Kearny and heard
her screams. At the same time he saw
a man running up Sacramento street
toward Dupont. He gave chase and
succeeded in capturing Gibson, who
had taken refuge between two houses
on California street.
Gibson surrendered without a strug
gle and Flinn took him back to the
Tremont House, where Mrs. Goss iden
tified him and preferred a charge of
robbery against him. He was taken to
the City Prison and booked on the
charge.
Although the police say that Gibson
la a worthless character there is no
record of any serious crime against
him uitd it (a supposed he had com
mitted the robbery in a moment of des
peration. The caso has been assigned
to Jmige Jnarhunsen'a our*.
CROOKS TO BE
WELL WATCHED
Capt. Bohen Making Arrange
ments for Certain Visitors
to the Jubilee.
Bunko Men and Pickpockets Will Be
Arrested as Soon as They Land
and Kept in Prison.
Tn view of the approaching Golden Ju
bilee, when a large number of pickpock
ets and bunko men may be expected from
other centers. Captain Bohen has in
structed his detectives to arrest every
one on sight and lock them up until
stranp^rs visiting for that occasion have
left. The same action will also be taken
in regard to local pickpockets and sure
thing men.
"I don't believe," said the captain yes
terday, "that there is a single bunko man
in this city at the present time. John E.
Gagus, the king of them all. and three of
his followers, Thomas Bailey. Â«'harles
Morgan and Samuel Whitney, who were
arrested last week for trying a trick on a
visiting miner and were charged with va
grancy, were the last of the gang.
"Gagus faithfully promised me that he
would never try a bunko trick again and
was willing to be known as a reformed
gambler. I believed his words and as the
other three agreed to leave the city I had
the charges of vagrancy withdrawn.
"When the Bryan party came to this
State during the beginning of last July,
Joe Green, a notorious bunko man from
the East, and his gang accompanied them
everywhere, but when Bryan came to
this city they were afraid to follow. Two
of them came as far as Oakland, and I
sent two of my men over and got them
to return home. During the Christian
Endeavor convention the city was freer
of pickpockets and bunko men than on
any other former occasion, and only a
few trifling losses were reported.
"I want to say that there has been less
stealing since I became captain of detec
tives than for years, and in one night
when I was a detective I have seen more
stolen than during the whole of the past
seven or eight months. It should not be
forgotten that this is a seaport town and
criminals of all classes arrive here from
all parts of the world."
