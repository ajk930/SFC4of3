SEVEN DEAD IN
THE STUPENDOUS
MELROSE TRAGEDY
Five Gallant Officers Lay Down
Their Lives in the Heroic
Prosecution of Duty.
KILLED.
Deputy Sheriffs Charles White and
J. J. Lerri of Oakland, D. C. Cameron \
of Alyarado, George C. Woodsum !
of Berkeley, Constable Gus Koch, of
Melrose. Mrs. Sadie Hill of San Fran
cisco and Dong Ng Chang.
WOUNDED.
Deputy Sheriffs Edward White and
Frederick Sherrott of Oakland, Perry
Wilson and George Gibblin of Mel
rose and Mrs. E. E. McLean of Fru.it
vaJe.
With a Lerrific roar, shaking
the eastward hills, an acre of
flame shot upward to the sky,
bearing away on its fiery wings
the souls of seven human beings
crashing into splinters the
quiet suburban hamlet of fair
Melr >se.
This terror, which startled peo
ple from their beds at yesterday's
dawn and lashed with sorrow the
hearts of loving wives and chil
dren, fathers and mothers, broth
.nd sisters, this most desper
ate deed of a hundred years, was
the work of a Chinese murderer,
. seeing the n<ose dangling
before his eyes for a most cruel
crime, took refuge in a powder
magazine and hurled himself and
his would-be captors into eter
nity.
In San Francisco, more than
eleven miles away, with six miles
of water to be traversed, the re
port was heard and the sharp
shock and tremor of the earth
wns felt by thousands of persons
awakened suddenly f)ut of a
sound sleep. In San Jose, more
than forty miles distant, the
shock was so palpable that the
impression became general that
there had been an earthquake.
The little brick magazine in
which the murderer held the offi
cers of the law at bay for a whole
night, contained 5000 pounds of
black powder. Dong Kg Chang
had been employed for many
years by the Western Fuse and
Explosive Company, and his par
ticular duty had been to take care
r.f the building which held locked
within its thin brick walls the fet
tered power of a volcano. He
knew where he was going when
he fled to it. He knew that once j
under its roof he could hold an j
army at. bay. Having resolved
not to be captured alive, he was
ready for the inevitable and did
not shrink from his hellish task
nor falter when the time for ac
tion arrived.
Every house within a radius of
roo yards was shattered as
though with shot and shell.
Shingle roofs, broken and bent,
THE CALL FIRST
WITH THE NEWS.
Eti When the shock of tbe explosion which startled the people of
' San Francisco yesterday morning reached The Call office the con
clusion was at once arrived at that the Chinese murderer near
â¢J Frnitvale had carried out his threat, and within ten minutes a re-
porter was on his way to the scene, and before 7 o'clock printers
were setting the type on the story which was first presented to the
E people of this city through The Call extra issued at 7:3oâ just two
Â£ hours after the
1 The promptness with which this news was handled and the
rapidity with which it was gathered and placed before the read-
X ing public is only possible in those newspaper offices which are
thoroughly up to date in all respects, and for this reason The Call
was the only paper which was able to give the news yesterday
â  morning.

hung over the splintered walls.
Small dwellings were razed and
what was left of their timbers was
consumed by the whirlwind of
flame that burst forth with the
explosion.
Within a radius of 200 yards
windows were blown in and the
glass driven into the plaster like
hail. Chimneys fell to pieces and
rolled noisily down the pitch
roofs; plastering fell in sections
a yard in diameter. There were
many pretty cottage homes
around Melrose on Monday with
pleasant garden patches odorous
with flowers, but Tuesday's sun
shone upon heaps of broken
wood and black ashes where once
sweet roses bloomed.
The Melrose public school, the
pride of the village, stood ioo

yards from the magazine and was
damaged almost beyond repair.
The plaster lay in chalky heaps
on the floor and the walls were
skeletons with ribs of lath. A
throng of little children stood
around the building yesterday
and gazed upon the wreck with
tearful eyes.
Camp Barrett, distant 250
yards, was convulsed with the
shock. Sentries were thrown off
their feet and tents were broken
down with a shower of bricks,
splinters and bits of corrugated
iron sheeting. But fortune fa
vored the village of white tents,
for no one was hurt.
Oriental fatalism is responsible
indirectly for the destruction
wrought upon property and for
the wanton killing of six persons
and the suicide of the criminal.
As the lighting of a match to a
train of powder, so was the cause
of the bloody deed in its appar
ent triviality. The match was a
25-cent lottery ticket, the train of
powder was the evil passion and
blind rage of one who had been
bred in the hopeless fatalism of
the Orient.
Chang had purchased the tic
ket from Hong Hi Sing, a butch
!er doing business in the neigh
borhood. He conceived the idea
;that the ticket had won $100 in
i the drawing, and he demanded
ithe money. Sing assured him
: that the ticket had not drawn a
i prize, but Chang, whose suspi
icions had been stimulated by
greed, refused to believe him.
His rage grew until it overpow
ered him, and would not be ap
peased save by a blood offering,
and Chang, after hacking his vic
i tim with a hatchet, shot him in
â  the abdomen with a bullet from a
! bulldog pistol.
The tragedy took place outside
the door of Chang's cabin, about
twenty yards from the magazine.
Leaving his victim writhing on
the ground, the murderer took
I matches and his pistol with him
(and in the heat of his madness re
solved that he would not allow
himself to fall into the hands of
the law officers. The details of
the melancholy affair show that
his first intention was to escape
during the night, but finding
himself so closely guarded as to
make that design impossible of
accomplishment, he made up his
mind to die.
Like all other fatalists, he re
flected that a man can die but
once. He knew that if he were
captured he would be hanged or
imprisoned for life, either of
which punishment he was deter
mined not to undergo. As the
night grew apace, with the hope
of escape dwindling away before
the increased vigilance of his
guards, he saw that he was fated.
Fated for what? To keep his word
that if an attempt should be made
to capture him he would blow up
the magazine. He was there and
he could not get out. It was
evident that his course was run.
Beyond this assumed fact his nar
row' mind could not go. There
was no room in his breast for the
innocent who would suffer for his
act, the women who would be
widowed, the children who would
be made fatherless. It was de
creed, so he reasoned, that the
officers of the law should die with
him, and when he had lured them
closer to the ambushed demon he
turned the monster loose and
tore them and himself into atoms.
There can be no question that
the officers were over-confident
and imprudent. Had they not
kept so close a , guard, had they
gone out of sight and allowed the
murderer to have escaped from
the building and from the
grounds there would have been
no mourning hearts in Alameda
County to-day.
But the strangest chapter in
the story is that when Chang
asked for a drink of water in the
night Charles White, one of his
victims, would not listen to the
proposition to drug the water
with morphine. His misplaced
idea of humanity cost him and his
brave companions their lives.
FATAL NIGHT WATCH.
With the Dawn the Officers
Became Imprudent and
Lo^-t Their Lives.
"When Alameda County was rudely
awakened shortly after 5 o'clock yes
terday morning by a tremendous ex
plosion every one acquainted with the
facts of last Monday night's murder
knew that the assassir must have car
ried out his threat and blown up the
powder house in which he was taking
refuge from the officers of the law.
No one, however, was prepared for
the tragic news that quickly succeeded
the report of the explosion. Rather
than submit to arrest Gung Chang
fired 5000 pounds of black powder, in
stantly killing Deputy Sheriff Charles
White, Constable Cus Koch, Deputy
Sheriff George C. Woodsum of Berke
ley, Deputy Sheriff D. C. Cameron of
Alvarado, Deputy Sheriff J. J. Lerri

UNPARALLELED ACT
OF A REVENGEFUL
CHINESE DEMON
After Murdering a Countryman He
Hid in a Magazine and Blew
It Up to Avoid Capture
ters' Home, who was visiting a friend
at Sather. The murderer of course was
a victim of his own act : nd with the
exception of his queue not a particle of
his remains has been found.
All of R^pnday night the deputy sher
iffs in charge of Al White, who was
succeeded at 2 o'clock this morning by
his brother Charley, kept watch around
the powder house in which Chang had
barricaded himself with cases of
powder. At intervals one of the Chi
nese employes was Rent to the maga
zine to ask if- Chang: would surrender,
and each time the answer was the same
âhe would blow up the magazine be
fore submitting: to arrest.
About midnight the opportunity came
to have taken the prisoner without
bloodshed, but through the humanity
of Charley White the opportunity was
lost. The murderer was thirsty. He
asked that a drink be sent him. A
Chinaman was detailed to carry him a
cup of water. One of the deputies,
Will Moffitt, suggested that a teaspoon
ful of morphine in the water would
render it perfectly safe for the deputies
to follow in a lew minutes and carry
out their prisoner. Deputy White dep
recated this method of making the ar
rest and forbade the use of drugs.
The deputies lodged in the superin
tendent's office throughout the dark
hours about twenty yards from the
magazine. At daybreak this morning
the murderer opened the door and
shouted that he would submit to arrest.
"All right, Chang," said Charley
White, "if you come out we will not
hurt you." The Chinaman replied "all
right," and walked a few steps outside
the door. White and some others ap

proached the magazine with White In
the lead. When about ten f^et from
the door the Chinaman ran back Into
the magazine, slammed the door and
the next Instant the explosion occurred.
Whether the murderer shot a pistol Into
the powder, whether he struck a match
and exploded it, or whether he lit a
fuse of which there was plenty around,
before telling: the officers he would sur
render, calculating on the explosion
just about the time they would reach
him, must ever remain a mystery. The
truth could only be known to the mur
derer, Charley White, Constable Koch
or Deputy Lerri, who were the closest
to the magazine door, and their lips are
forever sealed.
Immediately after the explosion
Deputy Sheriff Ed White and Fred
Sherrott looked around for their com
panions. They found none. With the
exception of Will Moffatt the haJf dozen
men who had guarded the magazine all
night had disappeared. Some time later
human remains were found many hun
dreds of yards from the place where
the magazine had stood. One of the
bodies, nearly intact, was recognized
as that of Constable Koch, another ono
but a little disfigured was that of D.
C. Cameron. Of the other three, Char
ley White, J. J. Lerri and George C.
Woodsum, the remains are scant and
so disfigured that positive identifica
tion is impossible. The widows of
two of them believe that they can re
cognize the remains of their hu.Â«b4n<ls
by small bits of clothing, but every
thing Is so charred and torn that the
clothing is but a slight clew.
Mrs. Sadie Hill was asleep at the
time of the explosion in a house about
two hundred feet from the magazine.
The house was demolished and two
hours later her lifeless body was dis
covered in the ruins.
Deputy Sheriffs Ed White and Fred
Sherrott had marvelous escapes. They
were following the deputies who were
going to make the arrest and were
about seventy feet behind them when
the magazine was fired. They were lift
ed off their feet and carried a long dis
tance, their faces were somewhat dis
figured by flying debris, and their
clothes were badly torn. Sherrott has
sustained Internal injuries. Ed White
tells the following story:
"Last night my brother Al. Gus Koch,
H. S. Smith, J. J. Lerrl, my father and
myself went out to the magazine and
remained until midnight; then my
brother Charles, Cameron and Wood
sum also came out and we were later
Joined by Fred Sherrott. After mid
night Smith and my father went home,
but all the rest remained. About half
past 4 this morning we went into the
residence of Constable Stephenson,
which was across the street, to get
breakfast. After breakfast we returned
to the magazine and all but Sherrott
and I went inside the fence near the
magazine. Chang saw Charley and
spoke to him. Charley asked him if he
were hungry, and he said he was. He
said also that he would not come out of
the magazine for a couple of days, and
when my brother suggested that it
would be a good idea to come out right
away the Chinaman replied, "All right,
I'll come out right away.'
"As soon as we heard this we ran
around to the gate to get Inside the
yard, and while doing so the explosion
took place. We were knocked to the
ground after being carried some dis
tance, and Sherrott was injured in the
groin. When I got up everything
around me was In flames. Cameron
and Koch's remafns were In th- 1 fuse
house, and all that I could find of my
brother Charles was a piece of the coat
he wore.
"Last night we ordered all the people
in the neighborhood to move away on
account of the murderer's threat to
blow up the magazine, and most of
them did so."
Fred Sherrott of West Oakland, who
is severely injured internally by the
force with which he was blown over the
ground, gives the following account of
the tragedy:
"I went out there last night with
Charlie White, as we were great
friends and I frequently went with him
in the discharge of his duties. With the
other deputy sheriff we kept as close
to the powder house as we thought ad
visable. Occasionally one of us would
go toward the door and assure the Chi
nese that we would not hurt him if he
came out. The fellow would invaria
bly reply that he would blow up the
place if we attempted to take him.
Late last night he repeated his threat
so often that the people around there
believed he would do it, and many of
them moved out of their homes. Had
they not done so they would now be
dead, for their homes are scattered
over many acres.
"Before midnight the Chinese shouted
to one of his countrymen who was near
us for a drink of water. I did not ap
prove of his being given anything, but
Charley White permitted a Chinese to
carry him a glass of water.
"Billy Moffatt, who was also out there,
proposed that the water be doped as the2
easiest way to effect the arrest Charily
did not approve of this and said that he
did not believe it would be long before
the fellow would surrender. We hung
around all night, and just at daybreak
Charley White sent a Chinese to tell the
fellow to come out. He would not do
so, but shortly after 5 o'clock he told
â vttt he would walk out and give us no
more trouble.
" 'Come out, Charley, and we will not
hurt yon,' said White to the Chinese,
and the fellow said he would do so.
"As soon as the fellow made his ap
pearance at the door of the place Char
ley Whit<- and Qua Koch walked to
ward him to make the arrest. Ed WhitÂ«
and I foll-.w"! th^m about eighty feet
behind. They were almost at the door
when '"hung closed it with a bang.
"Less than a second later I was being
earr-led with a cloud of debris and earth
swiftly over the ground. My face was
cut and my clothes torn and I cannot
understand how it happened that I and
TA White were not killed, as some of J
those killed were fai ther away than WtÂ»
were.
"I have no doubt that as soon as the ,
d r closed Chang fired his pistol into j
the powder. This fact, however, must
forever remain in doubt, as I did not |
hear a pistol shut prior to the explo- !
Pion. This is not surprising, however. |
Cor there would not be much of an in
terv::! after th<- shot was fired. When
I picked myself up and looked around
everything was on fire. I at once '
Ftnrt"d to search for the remains of '
thosi who I knew must have been sac- |
1, and thp first thing I found was
an arm of poor <"harlie. This was !
fully 200 feet from where he was stand
ing when the explosion occurred.
"Little by little we found other frag
ments, but undoubtedly much of the re
mains were consumed by fire.
"Five minutes after the explosion j
everything was on fire, including a
train of box cars. It will be weeks !
t,r.fr, r r> i shall recover from the fright
ful shock I received."
A few minutes after the explosion
all the buildings connected with the
fuse company's works were on fire. A
train of box cars that was on the track ;
north of the fuse works was set on fire
three of the cars entirely con
sumed, as there was no water to fight j
the flames. Two engines were sent out
from Oakland, but there was no water
available, and they could do nothing. !
As soon as the explosion occurred two '
companies of soldiers were sent to the ,
from Camp Barrett, which is less
than a block away, and a guard was !
established around the burning wreck- ]
Some of the soldiers pushed sev
en box cars to a place of safety; others
assisted In confining the largest sec
tlon that was on fire by rearing around
it a wall of the sheet iron that had pre
viously formed the roof. Other tol
diers sought among the ruins and as- .
â¢ ring the remains.
Much dissatisfaction is expressed by
who have suffered from the ex
plosion, as they believe that the com
pany had far more powder on the I
premises than the law allows.
An investigation will be demanded
by the residents living in the vicinity ,
of thÂ« works, for it is now reported on
all sides, and seemingly with much re
liability, that the quantity of powder
stored in the magazine was very great.
It is stated to-niprht that four carloads [
have been unloaded at the works this
week.
The Melrose schoolhouse is less than
a block from the site of the works and
is attended by 100 children. It is bad- [
ly 'Inmaged, but the trustees say they i
will have it ready to open by next Mon
day.
THE DESTRUCTIVE AREA.
The Effects More General and
Far-Reaching Than Other
Powder Explosions in
the County.
The effect of the explosion was more
general and far-reaching than any
other explosion that has taken place
in Alameda County. The periodical
catastrophes at the powder works along
the shore north of Berkeley are never
so severe In their destructive power as
th<> explosion of this morning:. At Pi
nole and other places near it the works
a ro so distributed and placed between
hills that the damage is generally con
llnci to the building in which the ex
ploston takes place. At Sather the
neighborhood is a perfectly flat plateau,
and the force of the explosive was
curbed by nothing.
Wh^re the magazine stood there is a
larpe hole in the ground, sprinkled lib
erally with pulverized brick. The
buildings immediately surrounding the
magazine are gone, and only a portion
of the fuse house remains. A few
cartloads of lumber and some rent
sheets of galvanized iron mark the
place where the storehouse was located.
On going to the scene along any of
the roads leadir^ from Oakland the
damage to windows is very noticeable.
After passing Thirteenth avenue some
large holes are noticeable in the panes
and the number gradually increases till
Twenty-third avenue is passed, and
from there to Pllttsvllle a whole win- j
dow is a novelty. Anywhere within 500 j
yards of the scene of the tragedy not J
a piece of glass is in si^ht. On nearing
the works roofs are split, doors are
shaken off and walls are collapsing.
As far as San Leandro hundreds of
windows were broken and some stores
were wrecked, and all along the county
road there was considerable damage
done.
In addition to the complete demoli
tion of the fuse works the following
houses were wrecked:
CLARK STREET.
Cottage of Harry Wilson, shattered
and torn.
Home of Mrs. Julia Sullivan, twisted
out of shape.
Cottage of Mrs. Mescana, broken roof
and sides.
Home of Charles Stephenson, burned

Fuse and Explosive Company says the
damage has reached $50,000 and the
works will be at once rebuilt.
DAMAGE AT FRUITVALE
Mrs. E. E. McLean Struck in the
Neck by a Piece of
Glass.
A thunderous report followed by fall
ing glass and pjaster awakened resi
dents of Fruitvale from sound slum
bers. Narrow escapes from death were
many, and after the news of the ter
rible deed of the maniacal Chinaman
was noised about, the unsuspecting suf
ferers of this act began to examine the
damage done their homes. Windows
in every room were demolished, and
cracked walls denoted the force of the
concussion. Among those who escaped
with slight injury was Mrs. E. E.McLean,
a well known hair doctor of this city.
The lady was asleep at the time of the
disaster and a piece of flying glass
struck her in the neck, inflicting a pain
ful wound. Mrs. McLean's first thought
was that the Spaniards were about her
house and when she viewed her room
she found glass strewn in every direc
tion. Her brother, Harry Came, had
a miraculous escape from death. A
piece of heavy plate glass of the win
dow in his room flew a distance of ten
feet and struck the head of his bed and
fell to the floor shattered. Had it struck
a few inches lower he would certainly
have been decapitated. As it was his
escape was by a narrow margin.
Quong Tan's Funeral.
ALAMEDA, July 19.â The correct
name of the Chinaman who was mur
dered yesterday afternoon by a fellow
countryman, who afterward blew up
the powder magazine at Melrose, is
Quong Tan. and he belongs to the firm
of Quong Chong & Co., who have a
store on Railroad avenue, near Park
street, in this city.
Deceased had lived here many years,
and was well known among the citizens
of Alameda, with whom he stood high
as a man of his word and in every way
reliable. His copartners In the store say
that the murder grew out of a dispute
over a balance of 10 cents, which the
powder magazine Mongolian claimed
Tan owed him. Great preparations are
being made for Tan's funeral, and his
store is dressed in mourning for the
occasion.
Evidence of Another Death.
OAKLAND, July 19.â Dr. Porter of
the Receiving Hospital made a discov
ery to-night that adds a mystery to the
tragedy of to-day. Dr. Porter declares
that he has indisputable evidence that
seven white people were destroyed by
the explosion. He has carefully exam
ined all the remains and he stated to
night that there is a right ear for which
no account has been rendered.
t'l know it is a very significant cir-
cumstance," said Dr. Porter to-night,
"but I have been very careful in my
examination and no mistake has been
made. There is an ear yet to be ac
counted for and it is very plain to see
by the hair that it is that of a white
man. It is certainly not that of a Chi
naman."
So far no man is reported as missing,
but as Dr. Porter is not likely to make
public such a statement unless he had
absolutely verified it, the mystery is yet
to be explained.

FRENCH GENEROSITY.
_
Their Fete Contributes Over $1800 to
the Bed Cross.
The French committee appointed to or
ganize the 14th of July fete in celebration
of the fall of the Bastile held its final
meeting, yesterday. It appears that the
fete, thanks to the assistance of the Red
Cross Society, has been even more suc
cessful than in previous years. Last year
the receipts, distributed among various
charities, amounted to only $1100. This
year, when the whole of the profits. were
given to the Red Cross Society, the total
rose to $1844. The receipts from the fete,
which was very largely attended,
amounted to $3048 10, made up as follows:
Tickets sold, $2678 10; receipts from the
Chutes, $250; Market-street Railway Com
pany, $100. The chief items of expenditure
were: Advertisements, $263 72; fireworks.,
$349; decorations, $187. As usual on these
occasions $50 was also given to the police
widows and orphans' fund. Various minor
items brought the total outlay up to
$1204, leaving the net profit in favor of the

EMEBIC WILL CONTEST.
A. C. Freese Granted Special Letters
of Administration Upon the
Estate.
A. C. Freese, Public Administrator, was
granted special letters of administration
upon the estate of Eugenic Emeric by
Judge Troutt yesterday. The Public Ad
ministrator applied for special letters
upon the ground of unavoidable delay in
the granting of general letters, because
of an opposition to the probate to the will
of the deceased. Miss Louisa Myrtle
Barbier, a sister of Mrs. Emeric, also ap
plied for special letters of administration,
but the court held that owing to the se
rious conflict of interest between the sur
viving husband of decedent, Harry F.
Emeric, and Mrs. Barbier, an impartial
person should be appointed, and Adminis
trator Freese was granted the power of
administrator.

DISLOCATED HIS JAW.
Joseph Nuhxn, a Teamster, Opened
His Mouth Too Wide to Pick
His Teeth.
Joseph Nuhm, a driver for Morton's de
livery, walkfed into the Receiving Hospi
tal yesterday afternoon with his mouth
wide open. Dr. Bunnell asked him what
was wrong. He could only roll his eyes
and point to his Jaw. He was taken into
the operating room and after considerable
difficulty the doctor succeeded in putting
his dislocated jaw in position again.
When he recovered his speech he said
he was picking hlB back teeth and heard
something snap. He could not close his
mouth, so he hurried to the hospital. He
waited while Chief Steward Bucher made
the entry in the register showing that he
had been treated for "bilateral anterior
luxation of inferior maxilla."
"Say." remarked Nuhm, "write that
down and I will get a week off. I didn't
know I was hurt so bad."
BUN OVEE BY A TRUCK.
Clyde W. Morris, a Bright Boy, Se
riously if Not Fatally
Injured.
Clyde William Morris, a bright little
boy five years of age, living with his wid
owed mother at 17 Lewis street, met with
a serious accident yesterday afternoon ou
Second and Brannan streets.
He jumped on an empty truck that waÂ»
being driven along Brannan street. He
slipped and his foot got caught. He fell
and one of the hind wheels passed over
his hips. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Fitzgibbon founu
that he was suffering from internal inju
ries that might prove fatal.
The driver of the truck, F. Kamlade St.,
surrendered himself to the police and waÂ»
released on his own recognizance. No
blame is attached to him. Ho is em
ployed by McNab & Smith.
The boy's mother came to the city re
cently thinking that the change would
be beneficial to her young family. A gin.
younger than the injured boy, has been
treated for some time for spinal troubles
and the mother herself is sick. It la
feared that the injury to her favorite boy
will result in serious consequences to her.
Chamber of Commerce.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday the subject of reciproci

up for discussion, but the dealers in
wines, groceries, sugar and leather were
not ready to report ana the entire mat
ter was left in the hands of a committee
for Investigation. The selection of Hen

was confirmed, as was the election of
Commodore Dewey as an honorary mem

of the late Rear Admiral Aramen was
passed.
Hurt Between Two Cars.
Mrs. Hattle Conley, a well-dressed and
prepossessing lady, narrowly escaped
death last evening while attempting to
cross O'Farrell street at the intersection
of Powell. She was struck by an out
ward bound O'Farrell-street car and
thrown to the ground, suffering two seri
ous scalp wounds and other bodily
bruises. She explained she had stood
between two tracks, believing the cars
passing on either side would not touch
her. Somehow she miscalculated dis
tances.
Charged With Embezzlement.
Bert Lithgow, manager of the San
Francisco Commission Company, 20
Leidesdorff street, was arrested yester
day afternoon on a warrant charging him
with embezzlement. He gave $500 cash
bail. He is accused of keeping $200 which
came into his possession. Lithgow says
that he kept the money, as the company
was indebted to him for that amount for
back salary. The members of the com
pany are Joseph Harvey, Charlea L. Ash
er and John Malowansky.
Putrid Meat Seized.
Market Inspector Ben Davis yesterday
seized nine cases containing 1350 pounds

LEFT-HANDED
PATRIOTISM
REBUKED
Well, Fargo & Co., and
War Tax.
SUITS FOR DAMAGES FILED
IT. S. DISTRICT ATTORNEY FLINT
ON THE WARPATH.
The Merchants of Los Anp-eles Pro
pose to Punish the Unpatriotic
Corporation â Plenty of
Trouble Ahead.
The astonishing plcayunish and unpa
triotic attitude of Wells, Farpo & Co. in
refusing to pay the small war tax oh their
receipts for packages accepted lest their
usual fat dividend be affected is arousing
the antagonism of the merchants and
Bhippers not only of San Francisco but of
the whole coast.
The law plainly states that the stamp
shall be placed on each document of the
kind by the public carrier, the same as
stamps are required from private indi
viduals who draw checks. It has remained
for the opulent corporation of Wells,
Fargo & Co. to defy the Government in
the trying times of war and endeavor to
find some loophole by which they can
shirk their burden and place it on the
shoulders of their patrons, who are bear
ing their share of the tax In many other
ways.
The sole plea of the great corporation
is that It is joined in a compact with sev
eral Eastern companies which are actu
ated by the same brand of patriotism,
and which are anxious that other cor
porations and the masses carefully do
their duty to the Government and leave
the company alone to grind out profits
at the same old rate.
Los Angeles, which owes its present
proud place among the cities of the na
tion to the enterprise and liberality of its
citizens, has taken up the cudgel against
the obstreperous corporation and is
swinging the same in a very energetic
manner.
They do not complain of the small extra
burden caused by the tax, but they are
hotly indignant at the corporation on ac
count of the small principle it Is parading
to the world. It Is stated that the three
big commercial bodies of that city â the
Board of Trade, Chamber of Commerce
and Merchants' and Manufacturers' As-
sociation â will take the matter up and
express their opinions of the company In
very emphatic language.
Frank P. Flint, United States District
Attorney of Los Angeles, has undertaken
to convince Wells, Fargo & Co. that they
are amenable to the law as well as other
corporations, and to that end has insti
tuted suits In the United States Court to
compel the payment of the tax and the
penalty imposed.
Mr. Flint Is now in San FranoiÃco and

ord, and In each case the company has
refused to attach the stamp to the regu
lar receipt. I have filed suits against the
officers of the company for $50 penalty
for each infraction of the law, and will
at the same time prosecute them crimi
nally, the punishment being a fine of $500
to $1000, imprisonment for six months, or
both, in the discretion of the court.
"The company's representatives tell me
that they are bound by a compact with
other express companies in the East not
to pay the tax, and that if they should
attach the stamps they would place their
fellow patriots in the express trust in an
embarrassing position by setting a bad
precedent. I told them l"should prosecute
them, but they did not seem to be im
pressed with the idea that they had to
obey the laws of their country the same
as other citizens. Our people "are feeling
very bitter over thÂ« miserly, unpatriotic
spirit of this corporation, to whose wealth
they have contributed for nearly a half
century, and will, if possible, force it to
do its duty.
"I consider the position of Wells, Fargo
& Co. utterly indefensible. There is no
right or reason in it. There will doubt
less be a large number of suits brought
against the company, ana it will not only
be put to a great expense but will make
itself very unpopular throughout the
country, losing a large amount of busi
ness thereby.
The leading men of L,os Angeles are be
hind this movement to discipline the au
tocratic corporation and I am confident
they will have the satisfaction of con
vincing the combination that they are
not above the national law and cannot
pursue their present course. The ac
tions will cost the company many times
the expense of the tax, and if they are
completed there will be a big hole "made
in the precious dividends they are now
so desperately guarding. I notified the
company that I would file every comp
laint the merchants would swear to and
keep on piling them up until the corpora
tions agreed to comply with the law.
These are not the times to show such
a spirit, as the big corporation will find
to its cost."

in accordance with his advice. Wells,
Fargo & Co. have as capable a board of
directors as any corporation, and if they
believed that the law requires them to
pay for the stamp they would do so. Of
course, it would be expecting a good deal,
for it would amount to considerable.

share of the war revenue.
It is, moreover, learned, on whs,t is

they are* not exempt and will have to obey
the" law. It Is, therefore, quite evident
that the company is acting under the ad

LOS ANGELES AROUSED.
The Law and Big Commercial
Bodies Propose to Punish
Wells, Fargo & Co.
LOS July 19.â The mer
chants and business men of Los Angeles
have never before had an occasion to
complain or or nnd fault with the gen
eral policy pursued by the Wells-Fargo
Express Company until now.
At this juncture, however, they are
making up for lost time, and at a very
lively rate. The fact that the express
company is compelling its patrons to pay
the expense of placing war tax stamps
on bills of lading has caused a howl to
go up which seems practically universal.
Merchants here are complaining not
particularly because of the trifling addi
tional burden the express company Is
placing on its patrons, but because of the
principle involved.
The fact that the company is endeavor
ing to escape its just share of the war
taxation is what causes the feeling to be
bo pronounced. It is stated this evening
on the authority of three prominent busi
ness men that the attitude of the express
company in this matter will be presented
to three commercial bodies of the city â
the Board of Trade. Chamber of Com
merce and Merchants' and Manufactur
ers' Association. _ Â,
It is expected that these bodies will
adopt resolutions expressive of the sen
timent of the business men of this com
munity in reference to the matter.

UNANIMOUSLY AGREES
TO SUE FOR PEACE
The Madrid Cabinet Said to Have

End the War.
NEW YORK, July 19.â A cao.egram
to the Sun from Madrid, dated July 20,
2 a. m., says: The council has unani
mously agreed to seek peace. The re
sponsibility for capitulation is left to
Captain General Blanco and General
Toral solely. It is significant that the
censorship raised no obpectlon to the
dispatch announcing that the Cabinet
had decided to seek peace.

of a court-martial of General Toral will
be submitted.

opinion, for Spain to sue now for peace
would be an avowal that she is van

NO MADRID TELEGRAMS
IN LONDON PAPERS
Severity of Censorship at the Spanish
Capital Is Felt in All
Directions.
LONDON, July 20.â Owing to the se
verity of the censorship at Madrid the
Ix>ndon morning newspapers to-day are
quite without Madrid dispatches, ex
cept brief messages sent by way of
France. The Madrid papers themselves
are without dispatches from Paris,
London or Havana. Even the Spanish
provincial papers get nothing from the
capital.
The Madrilines, it is reported, suspect
that the protracted negotiations at
Santiago de Cuba conceal some sort of
jugglery and it is also said that the
Government wields only a nominal con
trol over Captain-General Blanco, his
attitude and that of his army being the
chief obstacles to peace.
The Washington correspondence of
the Daily Telegraph asserts that Presi
dent McKlnley yesterday (Tuesday)
declared that he expected no peace pro
posals from Spain until Havana had
been taken.
The morning papers comment upon
the peculiar and interesting situation
developed by the antagonism between
the Americans and Cubans at Santiago.
The Daily Chronicle expresses the
hope that Commodore Schley has been
falsely represented as talking about a
change in European frontiers. It adds:
"If the T'nited Stntes really intends to
permit the incalculable error of send
ing a fleet to Spain, the less it says
about changes of frontier the better for
us all."

that the most powerful warship of
Spain has been damaged.
LONDON, July 20.â The Vienna cor

SCENE OF THE BATTLEFIELD NEAR EL CANEY.
CUBAN SOLDIERS
NOT PERMITTED TO
ENTER SANTIAGO
Keen Disappointment Among Gar
cia's Men Who Evidently Ex
pected to Loot the City.
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO, July 18, via Kingston,
July 19. â A fact which is impressed
more and more every day upon the
American officers and men is the in
creasing evidence of strained relations
between the Americans and General
Garcia's Cuban soldiers. Indeed, the
situation has now reached a point
where there is practically no commun
ication between the armies, and their
relations border on those of hostiles
rather than such as one would sup
pose should exist between allies.
After General Shafter announced his
decision not to let the Cuban Junta en
ter the city of Santiago deep mutter
ings were heard among General Gar
cia's men. It was evident the Cubans
were greatly disappointed at the step
taken by the American commander, for
they had confidently counted upon hav
ing Santiago turned over to loot and
plunder, as they had in succession
sacked Balqulri, Siboney and El Caney.
Consequently their disappointment was
keen when they ascertained that they
were not to be permitted to take pos
session of the city upon General To
ral's surrender. On Friday last, Cas
tillo, a brother of Demares Castillo,
went to General Shafter's headquar
ters in order to ascertain the cause of
this, to the Cubans, inexplicable or
der.
"Why is Santiago to remain in the
hands of our enemies?" he asked.
"The Spaniards are not our enemies,"
replied General Shafter. "We are
fighting the soldiers of Spain, but we
have no desire to despoil her citizens.
No Cuban will be allowed to enter the
city, nor will any American. The gov
ernment of the city is for the people to
decide. When the army leaves it I
presume it will be turned over to you,
but not until then."
Castillo, who came direct from Gen
eral Garcia's camp, did not attempt to
conceal his chagrin. The Cuban sol
diers now fully realize that there is a
rising sentiment against them in the
army. They hear nothing but words
of scorn from our men, as they pass
onward, lugging tiieir bacon and hard
tack into the woods. Even our officers
no longer conceal their disgust for their
allies, and it is understood that the
warm friendship displayed toward them
at first has turned into contempt, for
the Cubans have ne.Hher fought nor
worked.
The correspondpnt of the Associated
Press who sends this dispatch saw a
group of Cubans refuse point-blank to
aid in building roads, and during the
two days of heavy fighting, while they
were loitering in the roar, our surgeons
sought In vain to secure assistance
from them even to cut poles for im
provised litters for our wounded.
Hundreds of such instances are being
told around the camp fires, until the
name of Cuban is usually wreathed
with camp profanity and very rarely
is a kind word spoken of them. In
fact in some quarters there is a dis
position to prophesy an early collision
between our men and the Cubans.
General Shafter yesterday morning
sent an invitation to General Garcia to
attend the ceremony of raising the
American flag over Santiago, but the
Cuban general showed Ws resentment
by sending a reply which amply con
firmed the course which he and his
ragged and ignorant soldiers have fol
lowed during the weeks of hard fight
ing and campaigning which have re
sulted in the fall of Santiago. He de
clined the invitation saying he hated
the Spaniards and added that he did
not want to be where they were.
Since that time the Cubans have re
mained in their camp, eating American

BATTLING AGAINST
THE YELLOW SCOURGE
Every Precaution for the Protection
of American Troops Around
Santiago.
SANTIAGO, July 18. via Kingston,
July 19. â Strenuous efforts to prevent
the spread of infectious diseases among
the American troops In front of San
tiago de Cuba were made as soon as
the city surrendered, and for the past
thirty-six hours our soldiers have been
sent as rapidly as possible to the hills
to the north of the city, where new
camps have been established.
Everything possible is being done to
improve the sanitary conditions of the
camps, especially in the case of the
troops which are expected to take part
in the expedition to Porto Rico. Of the
regiments here only those which are not
in the slightest degree infected will be
allowed to pro to Porto Rico. The others
will remain here for the present, en
camped on the high ground north of
Santiago. Two immune regiments from
New Orleans and Mobile are expected
here daily, and upon their arrival they
will be sent to the city, forming the
only American garrison which will re
main there.
The physical condition of our troops
is not considered serious, now that the
number of cases of fever is growing
less all the time, and it is believed that
the disease will disappear with the re
moval of the soldiers to healthier local
ities and the extra precautions which
are being taken.
General Wheeler's cavalry division Is
practically free from sickness and
probably will be allowed to go to Porto
Rico to take part in the campaign.

o o
O NEW YORK, July 19. â The Washington correspondent of the Â©
O Herald telegraphs: Among officials at the War Department indig- O
O nation was expressed this morning at the attack upon General O
O Shafter by Sylvester Scovel, correspondent of the New York World. O
O One of these officials, high in authority, said that it was not simply O
Â© an attack upon a citizen, but upoi the head of an army, and as Â©
Â© such was an affront to every American citizen. This official said O
Â© that an example should have been made of Scovel in such a way Q

Â© ders touching the case had gone from the department, and the O
O whole management of it would be left to General Shafter. I was Â©
Â© told by one accurately informed that the probable disposition of the O
Â© matter would be that General Shafter would have Scovel put aboard O
O ship and sent back to the United States with an order prohibiting O
O him from again accompanying the army. Judge Advocate Gen- O

Â© such a case as this, where the assaliant was not a soldier, but as Q
Â© Santiago was now under martial law, Scovel could have undobt- O

PLANS FOR
CAPTURE OF
PORTO RICO
Miles' Departure Briefly
Delayed by Failure to
Get Orders.
Owing to Complications With the
Cubans All of Shatter's Army
Is Needed at Santiago.
WASHINGTON, July 19â Because of ' I
a failure on the part of General Miles :
to receive the orders the President pre- '
pared late yesterday to take command j
of the military expedition against Porto .
Rico that officer did not depart as was :
expected from Siboney. The mistake i
was corrected this morning, and as a <
result of some short telegraphic corre- j (
spondence that followed during the day .
it was gathered at the department that '
the Tale would start to-night. Contrary
to the first intention, and probably I
without General Miles* seeking, the I
Tale is to be convoyed by a naval yes- j
sel that Admiral Sampson has been In- ,
structed to select from among the yes- '
pels of his fleet. This may result In de- :
laying General Miles* programme some- i
what, as none of the â  vessels with I
Sampson are able to keep pace with ;
the Tale. Nevertheless, there Is no (
doubt that the general will reach Porto
Rico before the detachment of troops
from Charleston.
War Department officials feel that
they are fully justified in their decision
to retain practically all of Shatter's
army at Santiago by the press reports
that reached them to-day, indicating
the growth of serious friction between
the American forces and the Cuban
troops, growing out of the latter's ex
clusion from Santiago by General Shaf
ter's orders. It is felt now that the
garrison originally proposed, two im
mune regiments, would have been quite
insufficient to meet an outside Spanish
force that might come from Holquin
or Manzanillo and also to restrain the j
rapacity of the Cubans. It is realized !
that the present situation is full of dim- ;
culty and the future is dark, owing to i
the disposition evidenced by the Cubans
to ignore or refuse to be bound by the
amenities of modern warfare. This
first symptom of friction has suggested
to the officials innumerable - nculties
that will arise in the future. Of course j
it would seem to be only politic now to
avoid an open rupture with the Cubans,
provided that they can be kept in leash
and not involve the United States D the
disgrace that would follow the sacking
of helpless communities, but it begins
to appear that for some time to come.
and even afte^. the wnquest of Cuba is :
complete, the United States must main
tain there a military government in
order to meet the responsibilities which
it has assumed to the civilized world.
The personnel of the Porto Rican ex
pedition had been left In a large meas
ure in the hands of General Brooke; it
is not possible yet to give an acurate
roster of the organizations that will
enter into it.
The President announced privately
to-day that while no date of departure
of the troops to be sent from Chicka- â 
mauga to Porto Rico had been fixed,
he expected they would leave about one .
week from to-morrow. He is awaiting
a detailed report from General Brooke,
recommending what troops and sup
plies should be sent from Chickamauga. :
The present plan Is stated to be to em
bark them at Newport News or Nor- j
folk, and those at Tampa either there
or at Key West.
Admiral Sampson has received final '
orders from the Navy Department as
to the part the American fleet is to take
in the campaign against Porto Rico.
They are based on the view that the
campaign is essentially an army move
ment, the duties of the navy being to
lend every support and assistance to
the land operations. The admiral is
Instructed to aid the army movements !
by dispatching convoys when required i
and by covering the landing of troops.
As there is no Spanish fleet in San i
Juan harbor or other Porto Rican
ports, the navy has a limited field of
operation. The reduction of the harbor
fortifications will be the main work,
but this and all other operations of the
fleet will be supplementary to the main
operations conducted by the army. The
strategist?, military and naval, are
agreed that the taking of Porto Rico is
primarily a military undertaking, and
Admiral Sampson's orders are on these
lines.
The Navy Department Is rapidly
moving the large fleet of auxiliary
craft, made up of merchant ships,
large ocean-going yachts, tugs, etc.,
from Atlantic coast points to Cuban
waters, where they will be placed on
blockade duty, thus releasing the
larger ships for more active duty at
Porto Rico, and the coast of Spain.
Three of these smaller craft were sent
couth to-day, and most aH of them will
be on the way within a week, stopping
only long 'enough at Norfolk to have
their batteries strengthened.
When the war broke out a large
INTERIOR GARRISONS
WILL NOW SURRENDER
WASHINGTON, July 19.â General Shatter, in a dis
patch to the War Department, says he will send officers and
men to receive the surrender of garrisons in the interior, es
timated to be about 2000 soldiers. He will also send forces
to receive the surrender of the coast towns of Baracoa, Guan
tanamo and Sagua de Tanamo. Ten thousand stands oi
arms, he said, were taken at Santiago. Following is Shaf
ter's dispatch:
Playa. 9:30 a. m. â Headquarters near Santiago. July
19- â Adjutant General. Washington: My ordnance officer
reports over 10.000 rifles sent in and 10.000,000 rounds of
ammunition. Will send officers and troops to-morrow to re
ceive the surrender of the interior garrisons. There are about
2000 troops at these places. Will send officers to receive the
surrender of the coast garrisons at Guantanamo, Baracoa
and Sagua de Tanamo.
"W. R. SHAFTER, Major General."
number of these auxiliary craft were
purchased. They have been distrib
uted along the coast from Maine to
Florida, at some forty or more points,
making an effective coast patrol. There
is felt to be no further need of this
patrol, so that, with the exception of
a few important points, the auxiliary
craft will be withdrawn for service in
Cuba.
Bids will be opened to-morrow in
New York in the presence of Colonel
Hecker, chief of the Transportation
Bureau of the War Department, for
the conveyance home to Spain of the
Spanish army captured by General
Shafter. Meanwhile, In advance of
the opening, a bid has come to the de
partment from one of the big: foreign
lines, proposing: to carry IS, OOO men
from Santiago to Cadiz for the lump
sum ol Â£125,000. Any increase or di
munition in the number will be
charged for In the same proportion.
This bid Is being held up subject to
the formal opening to-morrow.
MILES PROBABLY
AWAITS CONVOYS
WASHINGTON, July 19.â It Is re
garded as certain by the officers of the
War Department that General Miles i
and the first contingent of the Porto
Rican expedition are now en route from
Santiago to the point in Porto Rico
where a landing is to be effected. Sec
retary Alger said this evening that he
hoped and expected that General Miles,
with his forces from Cuba, would get :
away to-night.
At S o'clock to-night General Miles j
was still in Cuban waters, but so far i
a? the war officials here are informed, '
the vanguard of the Porto Rican ex- '
pedition was finally prepared to leave, j
The War Department exchanged sev
era! cable messages with General Miles :
during the late afternoon and early
evening; regarding the details of the ex- '
pedition, but in none of his dispatches
did the general indicate the precise
hour of his departure. The impression
conveyed is that he was awaiting the
naval vessels which are to act as con-
\ ; -
It is stated definitely that General
Miles has no intention to await the ar
rival of the several parts of the expe
dition from the United States before
:.g upon Porto Rico. It is. in fact,
I - ] :: ; Be, with such troops as he now
has, to breaÂ». ground on the island for
the forces that will arrive later from
this country. His landing will be ef
fected, if necessary, under the guns of
the vessels of the navy. It is not an
ticipated that serious resistance will
be encountered, as the Spanish force
on the entire island is only slightly
larger than the force which accom
panies General Miles.
Arrangements for the departure of
th troops from this country, which are
to comprise the erreater part of the ex
pedition, are being pressed with the ut
most vigor. Difficulty is being experi
enced in securing pro-er transports,
but that in a measure has been over
come. Within a day or two. 10.000 men,
it Is expected, wi'.l be afloat for Porto
Rico, and the remainder of the expedi
tion will be sent forward as rapidly as
possible.
This afternoon and evening the com
missary department of the army was
engaged in making preparations for the
subsistence of the Porto Rican expe
dition. It is an enormous task, and
General Egan. the commissary general,
is still busily engaged in perfecting his
plans. Practically all the necessary
supplies, except fresh beef, have been
provided for.
NO REPAIR SHIP FOR
THE PACIFIC COAST
Belief That the War Will Be Over
Before the Vessel Could Start

NEW YORK, July 19.â A "Washing

â  cept the recommendations made by En
i gineer-in-Chief Melville for the pur
chase of a steamer on the Pacific Coast
to be fitted up as an engineer repair

due to the Secretary's belief that by
the time the ship is ready to start for
Manila the war will be ended. I un
' derstand the Secretary feels that if
any of the ships should sustain dam

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TVEDXESDAY, JULY 20, 1898.
NATIVES
MAY MAKE
TROUBLE
Insurgents Feared More
Than Germans in the
Philippines.
Washington and Berlin Govern
ments Said to Have an Amica
ble Understanding.
NEW YORK, July 19.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Officials of the administra
tion are now in greater fear of trouble
in the Philippines from the insurgents
than from Germans. Germany has so
strongly impressed her sincerity and
friendship upon the administration that
the President and his Cabinet have no
longer any reason to doubt the presence
of her warships In the Philippines is
simply due to her desire to adequately
protect German citizens and German
Interests.
On the authority of a high official I
am able to say that through official
channels this Government has been In
formed that the acts of German officers
attached to warships in Manila are un
authorized and are deprecated by the
Berlin Government. These assurances
have had their effect upon the officials.
They frankly declare there Is no longer
any fear of Germany interfering in any
way with American operations in the
Philippines, but that the insurgents are
likely to seriously annoy und embar
rass Major General Merrltt and the
troops under his command.
When I asked Secretary Long to-day
if he had received dispatches of any
nature from Rear Admiral Dewey he
positively stated that he had not heard
from that officer, thus denying the re
port that news had reached Washing
ton.
It is said by international lawyers
that Rear Admiral Dewey has a right
to prohibit German men-of-war from
eontinuatty passing in and out of the
harbor, and credence is placed in the
report that the McCulloeh overhauled
the German warship Irene. Before
passing upon the correctness of Rear
Admiral Dewey's action the authori
ties are waiting t<i hear from him. The
Secretary's instructions state "men-of
war of neutral powers should as a mat
ter of courtesy be allowed passage from
and to a blockaded port," and in view
of the instruction the authorities ap
preciate Rear Admiral Dewey had
some excellent reason for dispatching
the McCulloeh to overhaul the Irene.
In sending the McCuT.och the author
ities see an act of courtesy, designed
probably to impress the German offi
cers -with the idea that Rear Admiral
Dewey had no intention of using force
in requesting them to observe tn<? laws
md customs prevailing in blockaded
ports.
In the Herald's announcement this
morning that Agrulnaldo would not at
tack Manila until a sufficient force of

notwithstanding innumerable intrigues
which he doubtless has set on toot, and
concerning some of which tW authori
ties have been addressed, well appre
ciates that Rear Admiral Dewey is
master of the situation and will comply
with his -wishes. These wishes, as com
municated to Aguinaldo, are that noth
ing shall be done looking to the reduc
tion of the city until Major General
Merritt with the third army expedition
reaches Cavite, early in August.
It is the desire of the administration
to have a sufficient force of Americans
at hand to obviate the necessity of for
eign men-of-war landing marines for
the protection of the interests of their
respective governments. As soon as
Manila has capitulated, Major-General
Merritt will issue his proclamation de
claring the Philippines a military-pos
session of the "Cnited States, and here
will undoubtedly come a clash with
Aguinaldo, if it comes at all. Like the
Cubans, he and the men under his com
mand, desire the possession of Manila
and the control of the islands under a
government republic of which he pro
; claimed himself President. Any inter

international law that it is the right

against any person or persons resisting

ADMIT THAT THERE
ARE DIFFERENCES
BERLIN, July 19.â A1l official infor
mation as to the incident in which the
German cruiser Irene figured at Subig
Bay, Philippine Islands, in regard to
the shot fired across her bows by the
United States auxiliary cruiser Mc-
Culloch and regarding Admiral yon
Diederich's interview with Captain
Chichester of the B-itish warship Im
mortalite as to what the latter would
do if the Germans interfered with the
bombardment of Manila, Captain Chi
chester replying that only Admiral
Dewey and himself knew that, is re
fused here. The oerman officials will
only admit that differences of opinion
between Admiral Dewey and Admiral
yon Diedorichs as to the right of
searching warships, have occurred, and
the Germans add Admiral yon uieder
ichs refused to allow German warships
to be searched.
VEERING OF THE
GERMAN PRESS
BERLIN, July 19.â The Vossische
Zeitung in a much discussed article,
prefaced by the statement that some
rectification is needed of the errors re
garding German feeling toward Amer
lea. asserts that the unfriendly senti
ments are fostered by the Interested
English press.
It proceeds to declare that Germany
has always stood by America, and re
minds the Americans of Germany's
friendly attitude during the civil war.
On the other hand, it says Germany has
suffered many petty annoyances from
Spain, still she cannot help her ad
miration of Spanish valor. The article
reflects the general veering of the press
in favor of thÂ» United States,

Story of Three Spanish Deserters
Picked Up off Havana Harbor
by the Terror.
FROM THE CALL-HERALD SPEC
IAL CORRESPONDENT, on board
the United States monitor Terror, off
Havana, July 14.
While cruising off the entrance to
Havana harbor at daybreak this morn
ing the Terror pitted up a small boat
in which were three deserters from the
Spanish gunboat Aguila which is in
side the harbor. They rowed out to us
under the cover of darkness and dur
ing a heavy rain. They were Jose Fer
nandez, Antonio Gonzales and Antonio
Capellastegin. They brought with
them their arms and considerable am
munition and told us many interest
ing things about the effect of the block
ade.
According to their story the price of
rice in Havana now is 20 cents a pound,
and there is only one sho^ where it Is
sold. The supnly will be gone in a week.
There are no potatoes in the city, and
other vegetables are very scarce and
very dear. Beans cannot be had at any
price. Meat is 30 cents a pound. Bread
in small quantities is sold at a price be
yond the reach of common people; a
loaf which is issued to soldiers, weigh
ing less than a pound, can be bought
in some places for 50 cents. There are
no crackers in the city. Fowl are in the
reach of the wealthy at $4 each.
The three deserters told me that Car
denas, Matanzas and Cienfuegas are
starving and cannot hold out more than
a week.
These are the warships that are ac
tually in Havana harbor: First-class
cruiser Alfonso XII. second-class cruis
ers Marques de la Ensenada, Conde de
Venadito and the Infanta Isabel; tor
pedo boats Marques de Molins, Martin
Alonso Pinsos, Vicenta Yanez, Pinzon
and Xeuva Espana; gunboats Aguila
and Flecha, The transport boat Le
gaspi, the merchant ships Vivina and
Madrileno. belonging to a company of
Serra. from Bilboa. the Julia Cosme
Herrera, Avlles. Rita and several sail
ing vessels are also there.
About the fortifications the deserters
told a long story, but the officers of the
fleet do not think they have told all
about the defenses. The entrance to
Havana, they said, is fortified on both
sides, on El Chivo with two cannon of
30.5 centimeters, two of 57 millimeters.
Nordenfeld style, and some old cannon
of smaller calibre. In Morro are two
cannon of 12 centimeters, two rapid-fire
guns, two of 24 centimeters, old style,
and others of smaller calibre. At La
Punta there are two cannon of 40 centi
meters, Xordenfeld style, and many
others of older style. Besides the bat
tery of La Reina, which is very
strongly fortified, there is that of Santa
Clara, with two cannon of 32 centi
meters, and that of La Chorrera. At
the entrance to El Morro thirteen tor
pedoes have been placed.
MINE OPERATORS TALK
OF IMPORTING NEGROES
Strikers in the Penwell Coal District
Seem to Be Masters of the
Situation.
PAN'A, HI.. July 19.â An attempt to-day
to resume operations at the Penwell coal
mine failed. A force of armed deputies
and police were on hand, but the plan of
conveying the miners in carriages to the
mine to work was abandoned by the op
erators for the reason that no miner
could be induced to return, almost all the
non-union miners hsrving joined the union.
It is said that the next move of the op
erators will be to try to import negroes
to operate the mines.

ROANOKE BRINGS
KLONDIKE GOLD
Arrives at Seattle With Over Two
Million Dollars in Dust ar)d
Drafts.
SEATTLE, July 19.â The treasure
ship Roanoke arrived in port this after
noon from St. Michael with $1,536,000 in
Klondike gold, about $500,000 in drafts
and 240 passengers. It is the lirst im
portant golden message from the Yukon
mining district to reach Seattle this
spring.
On this one vessel are four tons of
g"M and the shipment would have been
larger had it not l>ten abridged by the
caution of miners in the interior. Fears
of marine disaster or piratical attack
have led heavy gold owners in Dawson
to Intrust their ergs to many baskets.
The bulk of the gold, 70.000 ounces,
has be^n stored during the trip down in
eevon boxes in a double cabin forward.
Five boxes, containing 50,000 ounces, or
' 00, are in the name of the Cana
dian Bank of Commerce; the <-ther two,
containing 20,( ) ounces, or $320,000, rep
resent the wealth of private individuals
shipped through the North American
Trading and Transportation Company.
Desire to evade the royalty and gen
eral mistrust have withheld a number
of large owners from turning their
money over to either bank or company
for safe keer>i~g. Such men have had
their wealth stored in their cabins and
have guarded it vigilantly. In many
instances four or five miners pooled and
guards were appointed for the down
trip.
The arrival of the Roanoke in Seat
tle was the signal for intense excite
ment, and scenes which attended the
coming: down of treasure ships last
fall were re-enacted. Vague rumors
of mishap had been stated because of
the delay of the steamer's arrival. Time
was lost in the run down by coaling at
Dutch Harbor, and by reason of re-
I speed through a fog later en
countered. It is true there have been
among the more timid passen
f pirates and nearly all aboard
i firearms. At St. Michael the
Kunboat Wheeling and the revenue cut
â u-ar were anchored within easy
nee of the Roanoke and St. Paul
and just prior to the departure of the
treasure ships the Wheeling sailed for
Harbor and waited until both
had passed that point in safety.
There were rumors of shady charac
â  i board the Roanoke and fear of
them was aggravated by a robbery
which took place on the steamer P. B
Weare. on its trip down the river.
Judge McGulre of tho Civil and
Criminal courts in the STukon District

ity. who was one of the regular
guards >â :" the treasure on the Weare.
'>n reaching St. Michael Patten was
unable to return the money, claiming
that it had been stolen from his room.
A passenger of note is Captain Con-
Ftantine, who has been at the head of
the police of the Northwest Territory
for some years. He is on a two months'
leave of absence, but it is understood
that he is disgusted with the manner
In which some of the Canadian officials
at Dawson have been extorting money
from the miners, and unless the evil is
remedied he will not likely return to
that country.
Charles P. Burnett, The Call's special
rorrespondent at St. Michael, reports
that a great rush of prospectors is set-
Ting in from all directions to the Koyu
kuk River, which Joins the Yukon six
hundred miles from Its mouth on the
northern side. The Koyukuk is a
mighty river, fed by seven branches,
each branch taking substance in turn
from countless creeks and smaller
streams.
The whole country drained hy thp
Ffvon branches is laced with running
water in intricate design and many in
dications point to the existence in these
divergent and widespread headwaters
of vast mineral wealth. Many are head-
Ing to the new fields in small boats and
Bteamers or over the land trail from
Fort Hamlin.
Seven steamers owned by private ex
pfditions are being prepared back of
St. Michael Island tn run exploring
parties up the Koyukuk this spring.
Two other steamers whose destination
is the same are almost completed at
Dutch Harbor. Passengers could be
readily obtained at the mouth of the
Yukon by any steamer scheduled to
make regular trips to the new district,
but such enterprise is checked by the
fact that the companies at St. Michael
and Fort Get There refuse to soil sup
plies to such steamers at any K-.5.-> than
retail prices. Failing to obtain steamer
passage many will go up the river in
small boats, and the district soon will
bÂ» alive with prospectors.

that on Tramway Bar are staked 12

SHAFTER CLAIMS SHIPS
AS PRIZES OF THE ARMY
Copyrighted, IBSS, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO, July 18 (via Kingston, July 19). The
question has arisen between the army and navy officials as to
the disposition to be made of the half a dozen large Spanish
merchant steamers which were in the harbor of Santiago at
time of the surrender.
Rear Admiral Sampson arrived in the city to-day on the
Vixen and claimed the steamers were prizes of the navy. He
is desirous of putting prize crews on them. General Shafter
refused to recognize Admiral Sampson's claims. He claimed
the steamers, with everything else in Santiago, had surren
dered to him. The question apparently is undecided, but,
at any rate, the admiral returned to his flagship without hav
ing distributed prize crews among the merchantmen, and
the latter are still in possession of the army.

THIRTY-SIX.MINERS
ARRIVE ON THE SAMOA
SEATTLE. July 19. â The steam
schooner Samoa arrived in port last
night from St. Michael. She brought
down thirty-six passengers. Captain
Johnson is responsible for the informa
tion that there was nearly $300,000 in
gold dust and drafts aboard.
The Samoa brings the news that the
river steamer Weare, on her way down
the Yukon from Dawson to St. Michael,
ran upon a sand bar and broke her
back. She was towed into St. Michael
by the steamer Hamilton.
The steamer Roanoke was to have
sailed for Seattle on July 9 with a large
number of passengers" and a large
amount of gold, estimated by the Sa
moa's passengers at all the way from
$5,000,000 to $10,000,000.
One misfortune after another seems
to have befallen the craft which have
Btaxted in tow for St. Michael and up
to the time of departure of the Samoa
not one of the numerous river craft had
arrived except those taken by the
steamer New England.
The steamer Conemaugh, which left
Seattle early in June with a river
steamer and barge in tow, when more
than half way on her voyage encoun
ter.-.1 a heavy gale and lost both the
river steamer and the barge and came
n--ar going to the bottom of the sea
herself. She was thrown on her beam
end and in this condition she wallowed
in the heavy sea for forty-eight hours.
Her crew and passengers had about
given up in despair. When the storm
abated she righted and succeeded in
reaching port in a battered and dilap-
Idated condition.
Thp steamship National City, with the
river steamer Jane Eyre in tow, also
experienced heavy weather, and not
withstanding hfroic efforts on the part
of her captain and crew to keep the
tow afloat, they were compelled to see
her broak to pieces.
The British stf-anipr Garrone, which
i loft Victoria with a barge in tow, and
a cargo in bond, lost the barge and
i will now have to return without hav
ing been able to land her cargo, owing
I to some hitch in the customs regula
i tions.

TRAGIC SEQUEL
TO A STORY OF
YUKON HARDSHIP
Chicago Man fJrrested at St.
Michael for the Murder of
Victor F- Maidhof.
t3T. MICHAEL,, July 9, via steamship
I Roanoke to Seattle, July 19. â A story
of Alaskan hardship in winter, with a
: tragic sequel, is causing intense cx
i citement here. Victor F. Maidhof of
1 New York, who was reputed to have
had considerable money on his person,
now lies buried In a tent forty-five
miles from Unalkleet, and H. M. Mor
; gan of Chicago is held at St. Ml
j chael under suspicion of having com
mitted murder and robbery. He is
j now under surveillance and cannot
leave the island.
Maidhof and Morgan together left St.
Michael on January 7 for Minook. Upon
Morgan's return to the former place he
reported that his companion had died
in camp from sickness, caused by the
I cold and lack of food. The story of
( their journey was a thrilling one, but
j the conflicting statements made by
i Morgan led to the suspicion that Maid
! hof had met with foul play and the
j arrest of Morgan followed. The ac
cused protested his innocence.
Morgan was found by Indian guides
! on February 7, on the Nulato portage,
; almost dead from starvation and ex
posure. He was taken by them to
j Unalkleet, there nursed back to life and
several weeks later was removed to St.
] Michael, where he wholly recovered.
: He was given a preliminary hearing
' before Colonel Randall, in command of
; the United States soldiers at St. Mi
; chael, and at that time told substan
j tially the following story:
Maidhof reached St. Michael last De
; cember, and on January 4 was intro
j duced to Morgan by Colonel Randall.
Being desirous of going to Minook.
1 Maidhoff arranged to pay Morgan $30
jto pack his baggage to that point. Two
j days later they started on their jour
j ney and arrived at Alokuk on Janu
', ary 21. They were there joined by
: guides, but these deserted on January
j 28, and the two men were left to pur
j sue their trip alone. They had been
on the road from Alokuk but three
I days when the dog meat gave out and
| their own provisions became so scarce
that they had to put themselves on ra
tions.
The food supply was entirely ex
j haustcd on February 8, and, driven to
j extremes by the pangs of hunger, they
; were compelled to kill one of their
I dogs. Maidhof refused to eat the meat
! and in three days was so weak from
exhaustion and exposure that he was
unable to continue the journey further.
By this time they had reached what
i they thought to be the Yukon. It
! turned out to be merely a sluice. After
crossing a hill they reached a valley
: and followed it for a considerable dis
tance. Finally, becoming discouraged,
they decided to turn back.
Camp was made In the valley for the
night and the following morning every
thing was in readiness for the start,
when Maidhof declared that the hun
gry dogs had chewed up his shoes. Af
ter Morgan had, with some difficulty,
made a rough foot-covering of dog
skin for his companion, Maidhof com
plained of being so fatigued that he
could no longer guide the sled. It was
SANTIAGO IS
A PEST HOLE
Ripe With Filth for an
Epidemic.
WHAT AN INSPECTION SHOWS
NO SEWERS AND ONLY SURFACE
DRAINAGE.
Overpowering Odors in the Breeding
Centers of Malaria, Typhoid
and Other Low
Fevers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO, July 18, via Kingston,
Jamaica, July 19.â General Shafter has
had a thorough examination made of
the sanitary condition of Santiago. The
â work was done by Dr. Goodfellow of
the general's staff and by a civilian
physician, Dr. Orlando Dwiker. They
find that although there are at present
but six cases of yellow fever in the city
in addition to two suspects the town
is ripe for an epidemic. Santiago and
Rio Janeiro are c nsidered the greatest
fever-breeding centers in the world.
This town lacks every sanitary feature
at its best, and now, after two months'
siege, leaving it dirty and repellant, it
is a veritable pesthole. The awful
stenches that arise from the streets
stagger and choke one. Ino cordial in
Santiago has the power to wash out
this odor from one's throat.
The city of Santiago is a typical trop
ical place, with narro**- crooked streets
and low, one-storied dwellings and
stores. Many of the houses are stuc
coed and painted with startling colors,
sky-blue and vivid shades of green pre
dominating. These, with the red tiles
of the roofs and the quaint verandas,
show evidences of past picturesqueness,
but everything is now in a state of
dilapidation and decay and the city is
but a shadow of its former self. The
majority of the houses are absolute
ruins and the once beautiful public
squares are now utterly neglected.
There is no sewage system. The city
drainage is all from the surface into
the harbor, and through the lower part
of the city much of the drainage runs,
especially from the poor quarter,
around the bull-ring to the northwest
of the city, which is the breeding center
of malaria, typhoid and other low fev
ers. There are four hospitals in the
c jty_the Civil Hospital, presided over
by the Sisters of Charity, and the Mili
tary, Mercedes and Conchas hospitals.
In these four hospitals there are 1,747
patients, which is a comparatively
small number, considering the lack of
food and the long siege, but it must be
remembered that the reconcentrados
were never admitted to the hospitals
and when the notification of the pro
posed bombardment by our batteries
was received every patient who could
stagger out was driven into the streets.
Twenty lepers who were in the Civil
Hospital were turned into the streets
agreed that he should go ahead and
I break the trail.
Maidhof started on, but had taken
only a few steps when his motions be
came erratic and he began to talk de
liriously. Morgan attempted to reach
him, but the man was too far gone, and
in a moment had fallen to the ground
unconscious.
This was on February 11, and Maid-
I hof remained in that condition until
j the time of his death, at 1 o'clock in the
j morning, February 14. Morgan's first
I idea was to load the body on his sled
I and take it back to St. Michael, but,
finding this impracticable, he decided
to bury it on the spot. He camped
there three days, moving his camp fire
| slightly each day, and joined the three
I holes thus made in the frozen ground
j into a grave. He wrapped his tent
i about Maidhof's remains, and, saying
I the Lord's prayer as he committed
| them to their chilly resting place, pro
j ceeded on his journey back to St. Mi
chael.
Morgan was now reduced to the ut
most extremity. He had only a razor
and a pair of scissors and with these
novel utensils prepared his daily diet
of dog meat. He would cut up a dog
with the razor, and clipping off the hair
with the scissors would devour the raw
flesh. On March 4 he struck the main
trail and there a new misfortune be
fell him. He was stricken with snow
blindness. Blind, half-starved and
alone in a wide, frozen waste, he re
mained in camp for days nursing his
eyes. But one dog was left. He made
from this a gallon of broth and greed
ily devoured the unsavory mess at one
meal. By March 7he had recovered his
sight sufficiently to proceed, but had
made but little distance when he was
again overcome by the dazzle of the
snow.
Morgan had resigned himself to his
I fate and laid down in the snow to die
when he became conscious of the ap
proach of human beings. He raised his
voice in a shout and it was answered
by a band of Indians who were travel
ing near. The natives fed and warmed
the half-dead white man and took him
to Unalakleet. There he remained sev
eral days to recover life in his frozen
j feet and hands and then left for St.
j Michael.
The Indians there told of having
found Morgan on the trail and gave out
the fact that he had attempted to trade
a watch with them. From the descrip
tion of the timepiece given by the In
dians it was recognized as having been
the one formerly carried by Maidhof.
Suspicion was at once directed toward
Morgan that he had not dealt fairly
with his companion, and a charge of
murder and robbery was lodged against
him. He asserted his innocence in most
positive terms and offered to conduct
a party of white men to the grave if
they cared to exhume the body and ex
amine into the cause of death.
In April a party of four started
with the accused man for the valley in
which Maidhof was alleged to have
been buried, but had gone only forty
miles when the snow was found too
soft for travel and they were forced to
return.
Morgan will be taken to Sltka for
trial. Opinion in St. Michael is divided
as to his guilt. H. G. STEELE.
and they have been roaming in the
streets ever since. The largest number
of patients is in the Military Hospital,
where are 27 wounded Spanish officers
and 431 wounded Spanish sailors and
soldiers. In addition there are hundreds
of cases of malaria and dysentery and
six cases of yellow fever.
GOVERNMENT PAPERS
EXEMPT FROM TAX
Federal Officials Not Bequired to
Affix Stamps to Official
Documents.
WASHINGTON. July 19.â The Com
missioner of Internal Revenue has
made the following ruling, which has
been approved by the Department of
Justice:
"That papers and instruments exe
cuted, mad- or isued by officers of the
Government of the United States in the
discharge of official functions pertain
ing to the operation of the governmen
tal machinery and for the use or bene
fit of the United States are exempt
from tax. In line with this ruling it
is held that all checks or drafts made
and issued by the disbursing officers of
the United States upon Goverment
funds or deposits, in payment of Gov
ernment obligations or duties, are ex
empt, and all certificates of officers of
the United States given in the dis
charge of official functions necessary in
carrying on the machinery of the Gov
ernment also are exempt. The same
principle would extend to instruments
and papers of whatever character
(otherwise subject to tax) executed,
made, or issued by officers of the
United States Government for govern
mental purposes. Where, however, cer
tificates or other Instruments are issued
by any department or officer of the
Government at the request of private
persons, solely for private use. a stamp
should be affixed."

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 18, via
Kingston, Jamaica, July 19. â The
Spanish soldiers were encamped be
tween the lines on the reverse slope of
the hill, on which are our intrench
ments. Many of them believed, as they
have been told so, that the United
States has purchased the island of Cuba
and that our Government would pay
them their arrears of pay and return
them to Spain. They repudiate the
idea that they have surrendered.

SYLVESTER SCOVEL, NUISANCE.
OXE of the most obnoxious features of the war
in Cuba from the first has been a fellow named
Sylvester Scovel, now of the New York World.
He lias sent much so-called news concerning the in
surgents, and most of it has been wholly unreliable.
He has prowled around the scenes of conflict with
all the persistence of a hyena and many ad-
ditional characteristics of that unclean beast Among
other things, he has been charged with violating a
Ikg of truce. If memory serves us, he has been in

'ue there yet.
During the transfer of Santiago from Spanish to
American rule Scovel pushed himself into a promi
nent place in the ceremony, where he had no right
er. He was properly pulled from his perch by
soldiers. Later he showed his resentment by slapping
the face of the commanding general. Had he been
an enlisted man instead of an interloper this would
have been a capital offense. There will be a feeling of
regret that he does not stand on the plane of the mili
tary offender just long enough to be backed against
a wall in front of a firing squad. He ought to have
been killed on the spot Any officer running him
through, or any private knocking the addled brains
out of him with the butt of a rifle would have been
applauded, and deserved the distinction. That slap
was administered to the whole American people. To
this nation, represented on this august occasion by
General Shafter, it was an insult unspeakable.
Scovel, known as a knave, emphasized the traits
which, from Cuba to Alaska and back again, have
made him a creature despised.
Yellow journalists have had too much to do with
the war, and when one of the most unsavory of the
lot tries to make his superfluous self a central figure
in an episode of world-wide interest he earns richly
the rebuke of a prod from a bayonet. But when
he adds to this, in sight of officers and troops, an
assault on the commanding general, he merits more
than condemnation, more than Imprisonment. It is
a mistaken pity which permitted him to live longer
to cumber the earth.
LET ONE BE CALIFORNIA.
f^ ONTRACTS will soon be let for the building
of three battle-ships. Let one of these be
named California, In the name itself there is a
listinctive charm, and there are practical reasons why
the State should be thus honored.
As good warships as float have been made here.
The Oregon has stood the test of such a journey as
no vessel of her class ever essayed before, and at the
end of a 15.000 mile run was ready for the conflict
There was speedy call /or her services, and in fight,
as in voyaging, she covered her builders with glory,
and the people of this city particularly, but all along
our vast coastline, felt a thrill of pride in her achieve
ments.
Dewey's flagship at the head of his squadron
when it won a fame which shall last as long as his
toty was the Olympia. San Francisco builders
wrought it, and in all the severe trials of peace, and
when guns were thundering from her and at her, she
bowed no sign of imperfection. Again was the State
proud of the handiwork of its craftsmen. And among
all the vessels turned out here there hai been none to
bring reproach upon the Pacific. The world acknowl
edge? that ships made here are as good as the best
Furthermore, this State contributes freely to the per
sonnel of the navy. Many of the brave boys with
Dewey. and many who made the unprecedented trip
unner Captain Clark, were born and grew up on the
shores of the bay into which the Olympia and Oregon
glided on the day of their launching.
So one of the mightiest of States in area, in re
source, peopled by patriots, in touch with naval af
fairs, wants a battle-ship to bear its name â Califor
nia â and the flag of the common country to distant
seas, to sustain the nation in calm or in strife. And
who doubts that the artisans who in the Oregon made
so splendid a record would strive with all the cunning
of their skill to turn over to Uncle Sam a ship even
better than the one now in West Indian waters, the
peerless and magnificent Oregon? Give us a Cali
fornia.
According to esteemed contemporaries, Cuban ter
ritory surrendered by Toral embraces 50,000 square
miles, this being by several thousand miles more land
than the entire island contains. Toral must have
thrown in some water lots for good measure.
There are some glimmers of light In the dark shad
ows of war. Not a word has been heard from Truth
ful Jeems Creelman since in front of Santiago he drew
his fountain pen and shot himself to the extent of half
a column.
The report that some of the Cubans do not want
independence would tend to indicate a queer state of
feeling in the island, save that as the report comes by
way of Madrid it does not tend to indicate anything.
According to Hearstling sheets, the fake of the

voutly wish that it might "close."
BY WAY OF REMINDER.
THAT the Wells- Fargo Express Company it
trying to evade the payment of its just share of
war taxes has been related. To the story needs
only to be added that there is much indignation over
this flagrant act of unpatriotism. People were slow
to believe that a vast corporation, protected by the
Government, making additional profits by reason of
the war, would refuse to pay its share of the ex
penses, while citizens in every walk of life are pay
ing and making no protest and asking no questions.
But it is even so. Wells- Fargo, rich and growing
richer, declines to contribute. Is there a law greater
than Wells-Fargo? Is there a statute superior to
the will of J. J. Valentine?
Records show that 90 per cent of the profits of
the Wells-Fargo concern comes from California pa
trons, and that most of the stock is held in the Â£ast.
While the matter is national, rather than sectional, it
is an irritating circumstance that an institution de
pending largely upon this State for its income should
demean itself in a manner so small and contemptible.
In a way, its course is a reflection upon the State,
and yet in responding to every demand made by its
country for men and money, California has been
prompt and willing. It touches the popular pride
that a concern so thoroughly Californian should be
derelict. It is fair to say that the blame for this
attitude of greed rests upon President Valentine.
Some of his associates recognize the fact that he is
wrong in principle, and that the law is directly
against him, but tHey are helpless.
There should be no difficulty in putting the mat
ter to a test. The express company contends that
patrons must pay the tax which Congress declared
the company must pay. Let somebody offer a
package for carriage and refuse to pay for the reve
nue stamp. Then, if the company decline to comply
with the regulations of Congress, complaint can be
made, and the question brought to a speedy issue.
Of course the company is wrong, and of course it
is aware of this fact, but to have it rebuked, to have
the prescribed penalty imposed, wou/d tend to expel
it from the path of error, and at the same time afford
a lesson to others prone to sneak out of responsi
bility. Wells-Fargo has not so much as the back
ing of a technicality. Its position is notoriously
contrary to the letter and spirit of the war revenue
bill. It simply defies the law, because none has had
the. courage to bring it to terms. The courts are
open, and the first to have the company haled to the
bar will be doing his country a service. And when
the corporation has been ordered to bear its portion
of the common load, there will remain to it the duty
of refunding the sums illegally taken from the people
who have patronized it.
But ingratitude, as well as a lack of patriotism, can
be charged against Wells-Fargo. It has enjoyed
special privileges and has not seemed to appreciate
them. It is within the province ot tne Legislature
to exact from it a license. In some States this
license is 5 per cent of the profits. Nothing of the
kind has been done here, but the attitude of the
company is such as to invite unfriendly legislation.
A percentage of profits would be no small figure.
The Wells-Fargo Company was organized with a cap
ital of $6,000,000, and upon this sum paid dividends
of 8 per cent until 1894, although only $500,000 had
been paid in. At that time the capital stock was
arbitrarily raised to $8,000,000, and since then 6 per
cent has been the annual return to stockholders. Be
sides this, it has accumulated a reserve fund of
$8,000,000. Yet it does not want to help swell the
war fund. Ingratitude most unreasoning and
foolish!
To such selfish procedure is due the hatred of cor
porations, the howl of the anarchist, the Coxey army.
Yet Wells-Fargo had been held in high esteem. It
wantonly sacrifices its reputation. Already, in
Southern California, steps have been taken to pros
ecute it criminally and civilly, and, so radical has
been the change of a feeling the company would
have done well to cultivate everybody in California
will be glad to see it fined for sharp practice and
branded as a public offender.
DELAYED MfllLS FOR DAWSON.
REPORTS just received from St. Michael are to
the effect that ex-Mayor Wood of Seattle, who
has a contract for carrying six tons of mail to
Dawson, instead of going straight to St. Michael and
hastening to forward the mail, stopped with his
6team schooner, the Alliance, at Dutch Harbor and
lay there for some time waiting for the construction
of a river boat which he proposed to take in tow.
While the Alliance was wailing the steamers St.
Paul, Roanoke, Grace Dollar and Bertha all stopped
at Dutch Harbor and offered to carry the mail on at
once, but their offers were declined. The result of
the delay will probably be that the mail will not
reach Dawson at all this season, for according to re
ports the river is now 6O low that no boats starting
after the St Paul left St Michael will be able to as
cend it
Under these circumstances it is not to be wondered
that the Klondike miners who at the time were stop
ing at St. Michael were indignant Nor is it alto
gether surprising that their indignation was so strong
that but for the presence of the soldiers at the fort
there would have been something like summary pun
ishment meted out to the men responsible for holding
the mails back.
There is a show of excuse for the offenders. The
contract required them to deliver the mail at Daw
son, and St Michael is only a half-way station to that
place. Moreover, while waiting at Dutch Harbor the
contractor could not have known that the Yukon is
so low at this season, and in all reason he could ex
pect to be able to get hU river boat ready in time to
make the complete trip. This excuse, however, does
not help the Dawson people who are expecting letters
from their friends. The mail has been delayed, and
according to reports the delay seems to be irreparable
this summer.
That this mishap is going to be the cause of much
anxiety is beyond question. At Dawson and along
the Yukon many men and not a few women have
been waiting all winter to get news from their friends.
Some of the thousands of letters that make up this
six tons of mail are no doubt communications of
prime importance both to their writers and to those
for whom they were written. Much positive loss as
well as much anxiety may therefore result from the
foolish obstinacy of the mail contractor, who, having
the mail in his possession, held it at Dutch Harbor
instead of speeding it forward as rapidly as possible.
There may be no remedy for the injury done in this
case, but it should serve as a sufficient warning to pre
vent further mistakes of the kind in future. Govern
ment contracts for delivering mails should require
their speedy delivery- It should not be left to the
contractor to hold the mails while he gets a boat
put together. It would be just as sensible to give let
ters for distribution to a letter earner and permit him
to postpone their delivery until he gets a new pair of
shoes made to order.
Perhaps the policeman who arrested a boy of 6
years was trying to avoid the possibility of having a
charge of cowardice brought against him. It may be
the prisoner showed signs of defiance.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 1898.
r\ LARGE portion of the American Economist of
/ \ last week is devoted to an account of the pro
ceedings attending the presentation of a com
plimentary memorial to Secretary Bliss on the occa
sion of his retirement from the presidency of the
American Protective Tariff League, alter a contin
uous terra of five years. The occasion was notable,
the services of the retiring president were eminent,
the memorial was handsome and the address of pre
sentation was eloquent They well deserved the
space the Economist gave them. Nevertheless, there
was something lacking, and the very fullness with
which the achievements of the Protective Tariff
League were enumerated served but to make more
impressive the lacking element
Summing up the results of the work of the league,
and pointing out what has been realized for American
industry while Mr. Bliss was president of the league,
the orator of the occasion said: "Our people live in
American built homes, held together by American
made nails, covered with American made tin, painted
with American made paints; they look through
American made glass, tread upon American made
carpets, rest upon American made furniture, cook in
American made pottery, upon American made stoves,
eat American made food from American made china,
wear American made garments from American goods,
read American books, gather around the family altars
to read American printed Bibles, and with thankful
hearts lift prayers to the Great Giver of every good
and perfect gift, for having placed us in this 'land
flowing with milk and honey. 1 "
All this is excellent as far as it goes, but what refer
ence is in it to the great industry of shipping? Our
American exports and our American imports are car
ried across the seas almost wholly in vessels built in
foreign shipyards, manned by foreign sailors, "owned
by foreign companies, flying foreign flags and earn
ing money for foreign countries. We have accom
plished much in the way of upbuilding home indus
tries, but we still pay a heavy tribute on our com
merce, and as that commerce is now rapidly expand
ing the amount of the annual tribute will largely in
crease unless something is done to prevent it.
The lack of any accomplished good for our mer
chant marine and our ship-building industry consti
tutes the blemish upon the record of the Protective
Tariff League. It was right and proper that Secre
tary Bliss should receive a memorial for his work as
president of the league, for that work has been highly
beneficial, but when the league has occasion to com
memorate another five years of its history it is to be
hoped it will be able to point out that it has helped
to fulfill the pledge of the party of protection to so
foster our ship-building industry that "American ships
â the product of American labor employed in Ameri
can shipyards, sailing under the stars and stripes, and
manned, officered and owned by Americans â may re
gain the carrying of our foreign commerce."
THE SLAUGHTER OF OFFICERS.
WHEN the reports came of the killed and
wounded among our troops engaged in the
fighting around Santiago it was noted that the
casualties among the officers in proportion to those
among men of the rank and file were extremely high.
The fact was regarded at the time as an evidence of
the valor of the men who are leading our boys to
battle, and the statement was frequently made this
heroism of leadership was one of the many superiori
ties of the American over the Spanish army.
Now that Santiago has been surrendered and the
Spanish side of the battles is becoming known, this
belief in the superior courage of our officers will have
to be dismissed, or at least based upon some other
foundation than that of the death rate in the battles.
The losses among Spanish officers of high rank were
even greater than our own, and it is evident they must
have exposed themselves under fire with conspicuous
courage from the first skirmish to the end of the
fighting.
General Toral, the Spanish commander, in talking
with our commissioners after the surrender of his
army, is reported to have said: "I would not desire
to see my worst enemy play with the cards I held.
Every one of my generals was killed or wounded. I
have not a single colonel left and am surrounded by
a powerful enemy."
Such a slaughtering of officers as that report re
veals has rarely been equaled in any war. It is an
evidence that our sharpshooters are even more skill
ful than those of the Spaniards in picking off from
the enemy's force the men on horseback or with
shoulder straps. The rifle record was in fact of an
extremely high order for a battle, and in its way is
equal to what was done in the sea fights by our crack
gunners.
In the meantime it must be noted again that our
own officers suffered heavily. Nearly every regiment
on our side that was present during the fighting lost
one or more of its field officers. Among the killed
were a colonel, a lieutenant colonel and a major.
Among the wounded were nine lieutenant colonels
and five majors. The losses of captains and lieuten
ants were extremely heavy. Altogether we had
twenty-three officers killed and eighty wounded, in a
series of conflicts which in our Civil War would
hardly have been accounted as sharp skirmishes.^.
An Eastern man having won a verdict of $300,00x5
against C. P. Huntington went straightway and com
mitted suicide. The motive will be conjectured va
riously. It may be the victor could not bear the
thought that Huntington was to be deprived of any
of the gold so industriously earned and so dearly
cherished. More likely, however, he was fatally
pained by contemplation of the difference between
getting a verdict against Huntington and getting his
hand on the cash named therein.
It is a pleasure to agree with the Post in its estimate
of the persons who have been selling Red Cross stores
to the soldiers, patriotic citizens having provided
these stores for the benefit of the boys. Speculators
of this stamp deserve to be hanged at the yard arm.
Shafter and Sampson seem in doubt as to which is
entitled to the ships captured with Santiago, but so
long as the ships have been captured people in gen
eral will not bother about such details.
For a time the Spanish declared they would not
consider peace until they had humbled American
pride. They are drifting toward the conclusion that
they have nothing to do this with.
Bids have not yet been received by the Government
for the transport of prisoners to Spain, but there is
already evidence tending to show the contractors will
charge all the traffic will bear.
Hungry and discouraged miners may give the ad
vice to keep away from the Klondike, but the really
effective talking will be done by the nuggets the lucky
ones bring back.
It is impossible to blame the Spanish soldiers
harshly for having looted the pantries of Santiago.
Their appetites did not surrender.
Perhaps a good dose of seasickness will relieve
Colonel Kessler of that bilious feeling,
AN INCOMPLETE WORK-
CONQUEST AND THE CONSTITUTION-IMPERIAL
ISM IS TREASON,
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: The dissent of your con
tributor, Henry James, from my corner anication in relation to the war and
the project of conquest which Is being so industriously pressed, Is tersely
and courteously expressed in your issue of Sunday last. It invites a few
comments, which I present with entire respect. Mr. James complains of
the "narrow lines" within which my strictures on the strategic conquest
of Hawaii and the proposed forcible conquest of Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines are confined. I make no pretensions to a wide intellectual range,
and, Indeed, my chief objection to the views of Mr. James and of those
who sympathize with them, is that they are outside of American lines. The
limits to which I have endeavored to adhere are those of the corstitution
of my country, under which the Union was established, and which, in a
political sense, represents the net results of the Revolutionary War, the
War of 1812, the Mexican War and the Civil War. I observe that Mr.
James does not refer to the constitution. I have read much declamation
and assertion, but no argument, In favor of the annexation of Hawaii or
of the policy of conquest which he espouses on the sole ground, so far as I
can discover, that, to translate an old Latin epigram, "the times are
changed and we must change with them." I have frequently heard simi
lar observations In reference to the Ten Commandments, even when
compressed Into the Golden Rule, but the great body of thelsts throughout
the world, and millions of those who substitute scientific abstractions or'
themselves, which is pretty much the same thing, for the personal God of
our ancestors, still admit the operative force of the fundamental moral
law. This same proposition which deals with organic law as if it were iden
tical with accumulating and diversified facts, destroyed the Republic of
Rome. That, In Its day, though, like the present Republic of France, bear-
Ing a very incomplete resemblance to our system, was the best government
on earth, and "Civis Romanus sum" was as proud a boast in Rome as "I
am an American citizen" is in the United States. But the Romans deter
mined by force to extend the blessings of their republic to distant and
alien populations. They acquired an enormous extent of territory. They
appointed Military Governors. They established and administered prov
inces. They constructed, for that epoch, a powerful and a vast navy. They
organized and supported mercenary armies, In which the aristocratic ele
ment was the Roman citizen, who held the command and dominated the
servile masses collected from barbarians who were incapable of Roman cit
izenship. And, when Caesar came, Rome was prepared.
Now, after this rapid summary, which, notwithstanding our pride and
our newly awakened thirst for military glory, speaks to the American
people in the deep and warning tones of history and through the undeviat
lng traits of human nature, rude or cultivated, there are a few pertinent
questions which perhaps Mr. James and the school of thinkers he repre
sents can definitely answer. If they can answer them in such a manner
as to justify the new departure, that is an end of the argument, and we
must all acquiesce in the conclusion But evasion or mere generalities will
not be sufficient.
Now the questions I propound are these:
1. Is it not true that the American Union, cemented by the Civil War,
rests upon the constitution?
2. Is it not true that the constitution Is the supreme law of the land?
3. Is it not true that every public officer, military and civil, and every
naturalized citizen expressly, and every native born citizen by Implication,
has sworn to obey the constitution?
4. It is conceded that the United States, in the same manner that it
owns custom houses, postofflces, arsenals, forts, naval depots and other
property, real and personal, essential to the performance of all governmental
functions, may constitutionally acquire and hold as a proprietor, naval and
coaling stations, or hout:3S for its Embassadors and Ministers in every part
of the globe: but in what clause of the constitution, expressly or by implica
tion, is the authority found to annex, conquer, hold and govern territory
which cannot be converted into States, and more especially without the
consent or against the will manifested through the forms of American citi
zenship of the native inhabitants? On its face such a clause would contra
dict nearly every sentence of the Declaration of Independence. If it exists
it has been or can be found. Where is it? In the discussions with which the
press for months has reeked, so far as my observation extends It has not
been quoted.
5. If it be true, apart from its admitted physical strength, that this
United States has no constitutional right to annex or take by conquest for
eign territory, with non-consenting populations, ineligible to citizenship,
then, in specific reference to the definition of treason, what is the attitude of
every legislative, executive and political officer, and of every citizen, within
or without the military and naval service, who would consciously and delib
erately violate the constitution and push the nation backward toward Impe
rialism?
6. Is It "narrow" to intimate that, If the constitution or our political
system, as a whole or in any of its parts, as established by the fathers, and
as It now legally exists, has outlived its usefulness and fails to respond to
the wild demands which fill the air as the twentieth century approaches,
and the war with Spain furnishes a convenient pretext, it should be abol
ished or amended through constitutional methods, and not by mere usur
pation?
7. No educated Jurist or citizen will deny the right of our Government to
compel the payment of an indemnity by Spain and to exact temporary se
curity for that purpose. This matter stands on its own footing. But sup
pose we undertook to hold and administer the Philippines with nine millions
of inhabitants as a colonial possession or as an integral part of the United
States, how would our Government derive its "just powers from the con
sent of the governed," and In what particular would these specific complalnt3
against King George In the Doclatatlon of Independence be Inapplicable to
ourf-elves?
" He has created a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms
of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance."
â¢â¢ He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without
the consent of our Legislatures."
" He has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction for
eign to our constitution and unacknowledged, by our laws."
" Forquartering large bodies of armed troops among us."
â¢' For imposing taxes on us without our consent."
These are a few illustrations of the consequences of the revolutionary
Ideas which are now prevailing, and to which I regret to see that Mr.
James gives his practical indorsement. I hold that the broadest and
deepest intellectuality should lead the American people to the enthusias
tic support of their Government exactly as it is. with the constitution and
the Union preserved In all their integrity. This is the true conception of
the ultimate form of government among men. This is the theory which
fits Into the mightiest progress that the world has ever seen or ever will
see. This is the only enduring basis of a Continental republic, which will
confront Europe and Asia with the steady light of liberty, entrenched in
law and inspired by intelligent fraternity. This is the sole conceivable
protection of a national home, In which teeming millions can be baptized
into the civilization of the future, educated and trained to the fulfillment of
manifest destiny In the only sense In which it is not a mirage, and pre
pared for that moral, intellectual and material development, which will
transcend all the imperialism of the past and pour its crowning glories upon
the waters of the Pacific.
The objection that these views are incompatible with our national ad
vancement is untenable, and the illustrations by which Mr. James seeks to
enforce the objection, in my opinion, are. unfortunate. Stern resistance to
Imperial colonization, whether after the Roman model or the more liberal
and progressive methods of Great Britain, is an essential condition not
only to our national advancement, but to our national existence. Conquest
and the military occupation of foreign dependencies are not within the let
ter or the spirit of our institutions, and are condemned also by the prac
tical and successful administration of our Government, on the level of the
constitution, for more than a hundred years. An Asiatic republic would
not be an American republic, and the empire of thp United States might
rupture the heart of freedom. In trade, in commerce, in science, in art,
in literature, there are basic principles, without strict adherence to which
progress is impossible, and. in all these lines of human energy, it is the
neglect or infraction of these principles that has kept the world back.
This is equally the case among individuals. The man who is true to him
self, that is, to his own nature an"d to the laws which affect it, grows, de
velops and achieves, Lut the man who violates his own constitution falls
into decay and ruin. If this nation remains faithful to itself, that is, to
its own theory, constitutionality expressed and implied, its expansion, its
intelligence, its wealth and its influence, will dominate the earth. If it
basely deserts itself and plunges into reactionary extravagances, lta fall
will mark the most desolate spot in history.
But Mr. James suggests that it is expedient to drop our constitutional
shackles, as I suppose the imperialists may term them, and reach out for
Asia, Africa or any other inviting place, in order to avert revolution at
home, because the country "belongs to corporations and money loaners,"
and because there are among us "threatening murmurs" and "an energy
that finds no outlet." I admit the "threatening murmurs," but I deny
that this country belongs to corporations and money loaners, and I sug
gest that there is room enough and that there are opportunities enough
in the United States for our existing population multiplied by four. If
the facts were as Mr. James assumes, still the remedy would not be found
by destroying the Government and conquering the East. The remedy for
Internal trouble is absolutely in our own hands. In the Scriptures It Is
frequently said In Bubstance that a man who cannot control himself is un
fit to control others, and this elementary truth Is applied to nations. If
our people are not fit and able to govern themselves at home, they are not
fit and able to govern aliens or themselves abroad. No man can hon
estly deny the underlying evil to which Mr. James alludes, in the sense
that we are not what we ought to be and have not reached the conception
of citizenship which our Government requires. But the complete and final
answer to the use which is sought to be made of this fact as an excuse
for treasonable revolution, followed by emigration, is that the power to ex
tirpate this evil Is and always has been In the people themselves, without
seizing the Philippines or in any other way imitating the decadent con
tortions of ancient Rome, or doing more than dropping an honest ballot at
each election. The attacks upon corporations and trusts have , largely
failed, sometimes because they ought to fall, but more frequently be
cause their assailants were cranks or corruptionists, without dignity,
power, or solid backing. After much observation and some experience, I
have been driven to the conclusion that, In our country as elsewhere,
"judgment must begin at the house of God," and that, when our citizens
practice and enforce Individual integrity among themselves, in their sev
eral occupations and at the polls, corporations will be at once protected In
their legal rights and divested of all illegitimate power and Influence and
corruption will cease to be a dominating quantity in American politics.
Americans have no manacles on their limbs and one of the evidences of
our freedom is that they can travel and settle where they please, but they
find no part of the earth better than their own, and they may wander, but
they almost universally return. Their main difficulty is not so much to take
care of themselves, as to prevent the Intrusion of Inferior races, to whom
scanty bread and poor shelter are the sole objects In life.
If we have not already reached, we have approached dangerously
near, the abandonment of the Monroe doctrine. I believe that the revo
lutionary wave should now be stayed. I am an American in heart and
in soul, and my faith concentrates upon the American Republic, which
shall never, with my consent or without my protest, be used as a mask for
imperial colonization or sink to the level of Asia on the one side or of
Europe on the other. We must lift humanity up to our Ideas and not
drown ourselves in a glittering sea of barbarism, irradiated by the false
sun of military glory. PUBLIC OLA.

BOARD BATTLE SHIP OREGON,
LYING OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA,
f.-Dear Mother: 1 received a lettet
â  OU mid was very glad to hear from
â¢.,1 to know that all were well at
We are having some very exciting
times with the Spaniards. Some of the
mam features 1 Will try to describe to
[though you may have already read
gn In the newspapers.
1 will try to tell you ot the bombard
ment and of the battle that followed, as i
Biiw it with my own eyes.
Early morning, Julj I, the flagship r^ew
York signaled us to take our position off
the bat i to i>e ready to bombard
â  t at 5 O'clock (which we did). There
Borne hitch in the movement of the
army on shore we only throw a few shells
into the town and then retreated. On the
July wi I" mbarded the forts with a.
. silencing all of the batterie*
aslng the dagoes away from them,
being the closest in and doln&
Bt \v..rk as usual.
: July, Sunday, everything was
ip and we had on our clean
s for Sunday inspection, never sus-
I g that anything wouid happen. It
.- a. m. when our signal
quartermaster told the officer of the deck
that the Spanish fleet was coming out.
I at him, but sure
enough there they came, big and stately,
one <â : the grandest sights that a man
tooked upon. The first one to come
out was the big cruiser, the Vlzcaya, with
sh admiral's ting flying. Fol
lowing her in quick succession came the
.. the new< si and latest
ship Spain had; then the Maria Teresa
tn< Almirante Ucjuendo, and last, but
not least, three hip torpedo boat destroy
ers. We were In for it.
The ships that took part in the battla
on our side were the Oregon, lowa, in
ooklyn and Texas, the rest o:
linwn to the coaling sta
,n-ntly wasn't in it. We
ETie llrst shot and the last at the
â 
nish fleet, after getting clear of
the entrance of the harbor, let gp a broao
and the shells were going over
us like hail, but none of thorn struck v*.
and then they started up the coast, going
in the direction of Havana. Their object
Was to get away, and three of them at
: <\ have succeeded had It not
\ â¢ en for us <the Oregon), there being only
one ship, the Brooklyn, besides ourselves
â¢ â  â¢ . teh them. The first ships t>>
â¢ doom were the torpedo boats,
one of which we sunk, and the other went
[â moke and flames. We were fast
drawing ahead of our own fleet and catch
the rear Spaniard, the Almi-
YVe let go a broadsiti>- at
a 13-Inch shell weighing \vy>
Is tore through her quarterdeck,
tearing her to pieces and setting her
ai'.re. Then . she turned tail and headed
for the beach. We did not stop.
The Spaniard right ahead of us was
turning her broadside to us to give us a
raking fire. She did not succeed, for w?
Ip a regular fire at her and she being
only 400 yards away from us we literally
Fhot her to pieces. She was soon afire
fore and aft and starting for the beach.
That was the last of the Maria Terc:-a.
The next one ahead of us doing the best
Bhe could to get away was the Vizcaya,
with Admiral Cervera aboard. By this
time we were away out of signal dis
tance of the rest of our ships. Thf only
which kept up with us was thÂ«.
Brooklyn, and she was practically doing
no tiring. We were directly oft the Y!:,
caya before we fired a phot at her, and
v.-hfiii we turned loose the shock mu.-t
have been terrific to her, for a 13-lnch
went into h< r stern and came oui
her bow, and God knows how many
cmaller ones struck her.
struck her colors, headed for thÂ«
beach and blew up shortly after.
There was still one ship ahead of us, the
Cristobal Colon, the crack ship of Spain,
nmi she gave us a long chase. The Brook
lyn could have caught her. but she seemed
cfraid to tackle nor. She gave us a three
hours' chase before we came within any
kind of shooting distance. When we did
BO we let go our forward 13-inch turret
funs. One struck on each side of her, and
guess must have scared the dagoes to
di -h.
< >ur captain gave orders to let go the 8-
Ir.ch, which we did, and one of them
struck her aft and went clean through
!'*r. Shortly after she struck her dolors
and headed for the beach.
When we came up to her the
Brooklyn sent a boat over to her and
Commodore Schley said to the Span
ish captain, "Well, we have got you
at last."
"Oh, no," said the Spanish cap
tain, as he pointed at our Captain
Clark; "there is the man who sunk
the Spanish navy and captured me."
Wo were busy transferring prisoners
till late in the night. The Colon turned
<'ver on her side during the night, and we
left her In the mSrning.
There were 400 Spaniards killed in the
flght and 1500 prisoners taken. The prize
money I get will pay for the lot in Berke
ley.
This Ip all I have tn say. except that 1

THE PRESIDIO CAMP.
First New York, to Garrison
Honolulu â General Miller
Visits the Reservation.
As stated exclusively In The Call sev
eral days ago, the programme now is for
the First New York to do garrison duty
at Honolulu. This has been definitely
decided upon by General Merrlam. Fes
terdajr Lieutenant Colonel Stacpole was
summoned into conference with General
Merriam. The general informed him thr.t
his regiment would go to Honolulu, prob
ably the last of this month, and that It
would do garrison duty there. The regi
ment is to superintend the building 1 cf
Government barracks, and much of the
material is to be sent from here for that
purpose. Colonel Stacpole said that this
was official, but he added that, as he un
derstood it, the regiment was to hay a
chance to go to the Philippines, if alicr
they were sent to Honolulu it was found
necessary to have more troops go to Ma
nila.
Colonel Barber still remains too Indis
posed to assume command of the regi
ment. The regiment will go to the Sutro
Baths on Monday morning for a swim, the
entire bath house having been placed at
their disposal. All the men in the .res*
.ment were vaccinated yesterday by Sur
geon Major Davis and his assistants.
The officers of the Wyoming (Alger)
Light Battery are hopeful that their
command will be sent to Honolulu along
with the First New York. The battery
v.ill have its new guns and all equipments
in a few days, and orders have been is
sued that these be furnished the battery
as rapidly as possible. No official. orders
have yet been issued for . the battery to
go, but the general impression is that
it will accompany the New York Regi
ment.
r.ripadier General Miller was at the
Presidio this morning, looking over the
ground with a view of finding the best
possible location for the troops at Camp
Merritt that are to be moved. No definite
selections were made' by General Miller,
but it is understood that some of the
troops will camp on the Blope to the south
of the New York's camp, and the others
will be scattered over the most advanta
geous places in the reservation. No or
ders, as far as can be learned, have yet
been issued for the troops to move from
Camp Merritt to the Presidio. Those
troops that are to leave camp in the next
two weeks will hardly be moved to the
Presidio.
The Utah Cavalry will leave for Se
quoia Park on August 5 and go into camp
there for the summer. There are 97 men
in the command, of whom 79 are mounted.
The eighteen unmounted men will act as
packers and teamsters. The distance is
about 315 miles, and it will be covered In
aboiit two weeks.
Sergeant Henry Blum, Battery A, Third
Artillery, has been relieved as overseer of
prisoners at Alcatraz Island, and will be
returned to the station of his battery.
Sergeant John Jardine of Battery I has
been detailed In his place.
EIGHTH REGIMENT.
Day of Excitement and Changes
Among the Men at Camp
Barrett.
CAMP BARRETT, BATHER STA
TION, July 19.â The monotony of camp
life was all broken up from the moment
of the first bugle sound this morning, for
the members of the Eighth Regiment.
The men were just awakening when the
powder magazine, less than a quarter of
a mile away, blew up. For a moment it
was thought to be an earthquake, but
the cloud of sand, dirt, brick and frag
ments of timber, clothing and human
flesh that went up into the air and soon
began to rain down throughout the camp
made all realize the terrible tragedy
which had been enacted. A moment later
a horseman came racinginto camp calling
for assistance to succor the killed and
wounded and fight the flames, which gave
evidence of completing the havoc
wrought by the explosion.
Captain W. H. Simpson, Company G, of
Alameda, seemed to be the first to -realize
what had taken place and in less time
than it takes to write it he had his com
mand going out of camp in double quick
time toward the scene of the disaster. The
surgeons, Lieutenants Dudley and Yost,
called Hospital Steward Taggart to bring
the stretcher and necessary supplies,
which he did in quicker time than the
corps has ever turned out since going into
the volunteer service. On their arrival,
however, it was seen that but little aid
could be extended to the wounded. Medi
cal attention was given Deputy Sheriffs
Lerri and Cameron and Mrs. Hall. The
former died almost on the arrival of the
physicans, while Mrs. Hall lingered only
about a quarter of an hour. The regi
mental hospital was placed at the dis
posal of the officers, but it was thought
best to take Cameron into Oakland.
The usual morning hour duties kept the
men busy until noon, but the work of the
regimental officers showed that there
was something in the wind. Immediately
after dinner the order was given to
strike tents and the afternoon was devot
ed to moving to the new site along High
street, across the California Railway.
The companies moved to-day, while
the regimental quarters and kitchens
will be moved in the morning.
The guardhouse furnished sufficient
help to clean up the old grounds
and burn the rubbish, after which the
prisoners worked until supper time rak
ing up all the rubbish In the new quar
ters.
The new camp is not laid out In mili
tary fashion owing to the shape of the
site occupied. Regimental quarters are
the same, but the company streets run
diagonally to the regiment street, the of
ficers 1 tents being along High street.
The kitchens, instead of being at the foot
of the company tents, will have to all
be along the south side of the camp di
agonal to the company streets. The Ar
my Christian Commission, Catholic Truth
Society, Rtd Cross and hospital tents
will be at the foot of the company streets.
The officers are located east of their com
panies and will get all the dust blown
Into their quarters.
Three officers were mustered into the
service to-day. Assistant Surgeon Lieu
tenant YV. P. Dudley, who was recently
promoted to regimental surgeon, was
mustered In as a major, while C. D. Mc-
Geuigan was mustered in as the junior
ant to fill the vacancy. The latter
ranks as a lieutenant. Chaplain Oliver ( .
Miller was mastered in as a captain and
hereafter the regiment will have a spir
itual leader. Chaplain Miller is an eo^or
as well as a minister. He has published
the Pentecost for some time past. He
secured have of absence until Saturday
to allow him time to close up his affairs
with his church and his publication.
Major and Surgeon W. F. Dudley is in
re< â¢ ipt of a very handsome sword and
belt with gold and silver mountings, the
gift of the Nurses' Training School in
San Francisco. Dr. Dudley is a graduate
of the old McClure's Military Academy,
and has been connected with the Na
tional Guard for eight years, having
served in the Fifth, Sixth and First reg
iments, organized the signal corps of the
Third Brigade and served as an aide-camp
on the staff of Brigadier Geiural Milier.
The past three years and a half he has
been resident physician of the San Fran
cisco City and County Hospital. It was
in the latter capacity that he came in
contact with the donors of the sword. He
appreciates the gift very highly.
Lieutenant McGettigan, tne new assist
ant surgeon, is a graduate of St. Mary's
College, Oakland, and the medical de
partment of the University of California.
He served two and a half years in St.
Mary's Hospital, San Francisco, and for
some time has been the resident physi
cian at the Sisters' Hospital in Sacra-
mento.
The patriotic citizens of Oakland will
present the regiment with a stand of col
ors to-morrow (Wednesday) afternoon at
4:30. The presentation address will be made
by Hon. R. M. Fitzgerald, while J. H.
Mar-donald and P. B. Bowles v.-ill deliver
the colors. Colonel Park Henshaw will
respond to the presentation with a few
words expressive of the appreciation of
the men for the gift. A special car will
be run out from Thirteenth and Franklin
streets for the accommodation of the sub
scribers to the fund for the purchase of
the colors. The ceremony attending a flag
presentation is very pretty and there is
sure to be a very large Attendance of vis
itors.
Captain George B. Baldwin, Company
M. San Jose, appeared in camp to-day
with one of the new brown canvas ser
vice uniforms. The change was startling
and emphasized his size to perfection. As
a consequence there was a constant
stream of "Where did you get that uni
form?" The question came from brother
officers, non-coms and privates, while
the ordinary civilian stood in awe ana
asked it under his breath of his next door
neighbor. The result was more than hu
man nature could endure and before night
Captain Baldwin was in anything but an
amiable state of mind. As he took his
company out to dress parade a young fel
low lying in the grass after a full survey
of the big captain from front and rear re
marked: "Where did you get that uni-
This was the straw which broke the
camel's back. Quick as a flash the cap
tain, now thoroughly angered, turned on
the questioner and began kicking him.
"Get out of here, you hobo," he shouted.
"Get out of here, I say. We don't want
any tramps on these grounds."
The guard detail to-night consisted of
Captain William S. Barnes, Company C,
Petaluma. officer of the day; Lieutenant
F. S. Drady, Company L, Marysville, of
ficer of the guard, and Lieutenant Yar-

Montana Regiment and
the First California.
The departure of the steamer Pennsyl
vania with the First Montana Regiment
and 300 recruits for the First California
yesterday morning at 10:30 o'clock for
Manila was witnessed by a large num

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
War Department Requested to
Immediately Develop tho
Presidio Reservation.
The members of the Chamber of Com
merce are determined that Camp Merritt
shall be abolished and that the troops
now quartered there shall be removed to
the Presidio, where they belong. They
argue that the location of Camp Merritt
Is wholly unfit for the purpose to which
it is now being put, and that if it is con
tinued as a camp much longer the health
of the city will be impaired. A few days
ago the president, Hugh Craig, sent a
dispatch to President McKinley request
ing that he use his best endeavors to have
the soldiers removed to the regular mili
tary post at the Presidio. This action
was indorsed at the meeting of the
Chamber yesterday and the following
resolution will be forwarded to the War
Department at once:
Whereas, The conquest of the Philippine Isl
ands and the annexation of the' Hawaiian Isl
ands have caused the government to concen
trate thousands of soldlera in this city, thereby
making this city a grand military rendezvous;
Whereas, In any event. In order to recruit
our military forces In the Philippine ana Ha
waiian Islands, It will be necessary to perman
ently maintain a large force of soldiers In this
C Whereas, The dlSMtroui result* of the ex
perimental station known as Camp Merritt
have proved most conclusively that tnÂ« great
Presidio military reservation of 1,486 acres Is
the only proper place for the militÂ»>ry rendez
vous on this peninsula; -. â <â
Resolved, That we respectfully aak the War
Department of the United States to Immedi
ately develop the Presidio military reservation
by sewering the tract, by providing an ade
quate water supply for the entire tract and by
grading sufficient areas for drill grounds and
erecting barracks for the accommodation of
not less than 25,000 men. In times past the
city government and private citizens of this
city have cordially co-operated with the War
Department In every movement looking to the
development of the Presidio, and on many oc
casions private citizens have, at great expense,
opened graded and bltumlniÂ«ed streets at the
reauest of officers stationed at the Presidio;
and now that the military neoesslty and com
mercial interest demand prompt action on the
part of the Government the Chamber of Com

ONE WING OF THE DEMOCRACY
RULED WITH HEAVY HAND
An Assessment Levied to Provide
Grease for the Machine Nearly
Stampeded the County
Committee.
The Buckley-Magulre-Gallagher Demo
cratic County Committee met in Native
Sons' Hall last night and ran through the
programme arranged at a caucus held
Monday evening. Buckley did not attend
the meeting last night, but Dick Creigh
ton, Alec Greggains and "Billy" Bell werÂ«
present to see that no number on the pro
gramme was changed.
After the meeting had been called to
order J. Placehunter Dunn, chairman of
the committee, announced that reports of
committees were in order, the Maguireite
having previously determined to dispense
with the reading of the minutes of the
previous meeting.
The first committee report came close
to doing worse work than a dynamite
bomb. It provided that each member of
the committee, appointed by the "sinless
nine" of the State Central. Committee, be
assessed $2 BO to defray the expenses of
keeping the Buckley-Magulre-Gallagher
machine running. The motion prevailed
and there was a wild rushâ but not In the
direction of the treasurer's desk. A ma
jority of the committeemen had Important
business to transact downfown, and a
panic was only averted by the timely ac
tion of one of Buckley's old and tried
lambs. He closed the door and thus pre
vented the committeemen stampeding and
trampling one another to death in the
hallway in their mad haste to reach the
elevator, Colonel Blenfleld, aid-de-camp
to Max Popper, was one of the coolest
men in the hall. "What are you running
away for?" said he to the excited commit
teemen. "Walt till Sammy Braunhart
chips in the pot. Then we," he concluded
with lofty airs, "will come up to the cap
tain's office." His words had a reassuring
effect and the crisis was over.
Max Popper, who doesn t tell all he
knows, especially when called as a wit
ness before the Grand Jury, next claimed
the floor to offer the following resolution's:
Whereas. C. P. Huntingdon haa, by securing
recent legislation by Congress through which
he hopes to evade the payment of the Central
Pacific Railroad Company's debt of sixty mil
lion dollar*! to the Government of the United
States made the question of railroad domina
tion In this State the paramount Issue In ths
ensuing campaign.
Whereas. Said Huntingdon and his associates
have fnr the past thirty years debauched and
corrupted the politics of this State, dictating
the nomination and election of Judges of the
Supreme and Superior Courts, of members of
the Legislature, of the Railroad Commission,
of the Board of Equalization and of the Com
mon Councils and Boards of Supervisors
throughout the State.
And whereas, the Democratic County Com
mittee of San Francisco, as at present consti
tuted Is earnestly opposed to the domination
of State politics by C. P. Huntlngton and his
corrupt tools and purchased servitors and is
resolutely determined that this portion of our
fair Btate shall no longer be treated as the
plantation of a greedy, corrupt and tyrannical
usurper, whose sole object seems to be to
hinder and obstruct the growth and prosperity
of thii community.
Resolved, That the future progress and pros
perity of this city can only be Insured by free
ing It from the strangling grip of C. P. Hunt
lngton and securing to Its people the benefit of
free competition in the business of the trans
WILL HURRY THE REMOVAL
Steps Have Already Been Taken for
the Transfer of Troops From
Camp Merritt to the
Presidio.
Major-General Merriam has received positive orders to hare all the
troops at Camp Merritt moved with all possible haste to the Presidio reser
vation, and in less than ten minutes after these Instructions cams from the
War Department the Initial steps for the removal were taken.
It has all along been the desire of General Merriam to have this move
made, but up to the departure of Major General Otis he had no voice what
ever in the matter. It is upon the suggestion of General Merriam that this
sanitary movement has been ordered.
Contracts are now being let for laying water pipes and constructing a
sewer system at the Presidio. This work will be done In a very few days.
At those points where it will be too Inconvenient to put in water pipes or re
quire too much time to put them down, the water will be supplied In carts.
The sloping ground just west of the east boundary of the reservation and
â outh of the car tracks will afford room for quite a large number of troops,
as will also the golf ground.
Brigadier General Miller yesterday called on General Merriam and held
quite an extended conference with him in regard to these matters, and it Is
said that General Merriam expressed the belief that Camp Merritt could be
entirely abandoned within a week or ten days.
Already certain work Is being done at Camp Merritt with a view ot an
early removal.
A telegram reached Brigadier General Miller's headquarters yesterday
from the Secretary of War directing that all commanding officers of regi
ments at Camp Merritt report to General Merriam for further equipment
and instructions as to drill.
The telegram also stated that Camp Merrltt had been condemned and
that all troops will be immediately moved to the Presidio.
The first order to this effect was issued yesterday to Major "W. O. Owen,
directing him to move the Field Hospital to tha barracks at the Presidio
by Thursday.
mere*, representing the business Interests of
the city, feels that It has a riprht to call the
attention of the "War Department to Presidio
needs, and in so doing- is simply performing 1
a public duty, especially as the improvements
suÃfreisted by this chamber have on several
occ&jtlons been earnestly recommended by army
officer*.
Unhealthy Habitations.
A special meeting of the Board of
Health will be held this morning to take
action on the matter of removing the vol
unteer soldiers now stationed at Camp
Merritt to the Presidio. The sanitary con
dition of the camp is daily proving worse,
and unless speedy action is taken there is
every possibility of a spread of infectious
diseases.
The board will also declare a building
on Francisco street, between Kearny
and Montgomery, as unfit for habitation.
Daniel Eaper and wife are Hying there
under circumstances that indicate that
unless the building is soon vacated and
torn down there will be plenty of work
for physicians living in the locality. The
attention of the board was called to the
house several days ago by Police Ser
geant Esola.
SAN DIEGO BAY.
Notice to Mariners in Regard
to the Submarine Mines.
Captain George "W. Coffln, inspector of
the Twelfth Lighthouse District, has is
sued a notice by order of the Lighthouse
Board that the submarine mines will be
continued in position In connection with
the defenses of San Diego Bay, but the
following changes have been made in the
regulations for the safe navigation of
the entrance:
"Vessels will be allowed to pass through
the channel entrance at any time of day
or night, but must pass between the
buoys marking- the channel to the south
ward of Ballast Point. The light on Bal
last Point and the harbor lights will be

are known to be unalterably opposed to the
domination of our State politics by C. P. Hunt

Resolved, That we commend and approve the
action of the representatives in Congress from
this State who courageously fought the
stealthy attempt of C. P. Huntlngton to evade
the payment of the just debt due from the

the paaswre of the rider to an appropriation
bill by which this nefarious object has been
attained. .
Resolved, That we specially commend our
faithful representative from the Fourth Dis

Barna McKinne was opposed to the
adoption of any resolutions Indorsing
Congressman Magtiire or any other can
didate. Such a proceeding, he argued
â¢would be un-Democratic, intemperate ana
unauthorized. - Â« __. v Â»i.
A lengthy discussion followed, but Mo-

the Maguire indorsement proposition.
ExJudge Bridgford next found fault
with the section referring to the Hunting

Judges of the Supreme and Superior

resolution in that respect to the effect
that Huntington only dictated at times.

Sacramento and cannot reasonably be ex

Thirty-first District, but he was on the
slate and remained there.
The several district committees were
authorized to suggest names for per

The Whittier Machine Shop.
The trustees of the Whittier Reform
School have begun an action in the Su
preme Court to compel Controller Colgan
to draw his warrant on a demand pre
sented by them for $4000. The trustees
condemned one of the machinery build
ings of the school as unsafe and adver
tised for plans for another building, offer
ing a premium of $4000 for the plans that
should be accepted. Small premiums were
also offered for the second and third best
planÃ. The Contrdller refused to draw his
warrant for these claims, stating that thÂ«
Whittier school fund does not provide for
such expenses. The trustees found that i
No vessel will be allowed to anclior with

WAR SIGNS GROW
MORE OMINOUS IN
THE FAR EAST
England and Russia Preparing for
the Struggle That Will Involve
All Europe.
VICTORIA. July IP.â On board the
Empress of India, which arrived from
the Orient to-day were several British
officers, bound home on furlough. From
them and from sevr-ral merchants who
â were fellow passengers it was learned
that the prevailing topic of conversa
tion In the far Bast at present is the
prospect of war with Rus:i:i.
Preparations, which are very slgmn
cant, are being made on all sides. At
Hongkong the navy depot presents a
busy scene, as large stocks of coal and
munitions of war are arriving con
tinually to be stored there. The as
e^mbling of all the small gunboats at
Hongkong points to a state of prepara
tions, as in the event of war these ves
fpls would be laid up, and their crews
drafted to the lighting ships.
"Russia's aggressions have just
about gone to the limit," said one of
the naval men, whose name at his re
quest is withheld. "The Russians are
now making strenuous efforts to pre
vent concessions or contracts being
given the British in North China, and
on June 20 last, the Russian Minister
ut Peking publicly objected to China
borrowing money from England for the
construction of the New Chang Rail
way At the request of the Russians
and French, the treaty was signed on
July 1 for the i^eklng-Mankau Railway,
the construction of which is under
taken by Belgians. Great Britain will
not be silent on this move."
That EngUu-d is preparing to resist
the Russian aggressions is shown by
the fart that the work of improving the
Chinese army and navy under British
.'flicers, as in Egypt, has begun. This
will give Britain a lighting force in the
East that will obviate the necessity of
employing the full force of the British
army.
The situation apparently Is serious,
for every week the Russian sphere of
influence as well as that of France and
other countries inimical to the British,
has increased. I,i Hung Chang, now re
turned to power, no longer favors Great
Britain. He is a friend of Russia. It
was he who brought about the dismis
sal of Minister Weng at the instance of
Russia because that official dilated on
the danger of Russian advances. His
friendliness to the countries inimical to
Groat Britain is shown also by his vio
lent altercation with Sir Claude Mac-
Donald, the British Eniba-ssador at Pe
king, over the new concessions near
Hongkong.
The Japanese papers are still discuss
ing the desirability of forming an An
glo-Japanese alliance in view of the
fears entertained of Russian aggres
sion in China. The tone of the Chinese
and Japanese papers is indicative of
growing belief in the possibility of an
ultimate outbreak of hostilities be
tween Great Britain and Russia.
AN ENTIRE COLONY
DIES OF STARVATION
VICTORIA, July 19.â The Empress of
India reports that gTeat damage was
done by floods in Central Japan June
25. Several towns and villages were
flooded. No loss of life is reported.
On June 23 a Chinese junk with its
cargo of liquor was burned at Taku.
Twenty -eight persons were burned and
drowned.
The Hillyer & Co.'s tea gardens at
Kobe were damaged by fire recently to
the extent of $50,000.
A horrible tale comes from Chinlpori
Island, off the coast of Hokkaido. A
Chinese contractor engaged a number
of men to work a silver mine on the is
land. He kept up no communication
with them and when a steamer calk-d
there for a load of ore it was found that
the whole colony had died of starvation.
It Is reported from Shanghai that
Belgians have made an offer to take a
large number of coolies to work under
contract in the Congo, supplying in ex
change an equal number ut negroes to
he trained Into an armed force.
The black flag rebellion in the Quong
provinces of China is increased. The
standard of revolt has been raised at
four points and danger is feared at the
various missionary stations.
The United States Consul at Canton
formulated a heavy claim for indemnity
damages for the wanton destruction of
the American mission school at Hoi
pine. He demands that the school be
rebuilt and that $10 000 in Mexican
money be paid. The German Minister
at Beoul requested the Korean Minister
of Foreign Affairs to wait upon him at
the legation. Upon the latter's arrival
the German Minister administered to
him a severe thrashing on account of
his refusal to grant certain mining
privileges to German subjects in the
district of Kiojgu. The Korean Gov
ernment Is greatly incensed.
Chinese pirates attempted to gain
possession of the Indo-China steamer
Yupng-Wo when it was leaving Hau-
Kow. A number of Chinese came
aboard with heavy bags. Passengers
who were suspicious insisted upon a
search being made with the result that
arms were found concealed.
PERSONNEL OF THE
JAPANESE CABINET
VICTORIA, July 19.â NÂ»ws comes by
th* Empress of India that following the
resignation of Marquis Ito, Prime Minis
ter of Japan, and his Cabinet, a new Cab- \
lnÂ«t lias been formed by Counts Okuma â 
and Hagaki. and the leading members of '
the constitutional party. The personnel I
of the new Cabinet is as follows:
Count Okuma Shigenobu. Minister Pres- i
!<!mt and Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Count Itagakl Tafsuke, Minister for
Home Affairs.
Mntsuda. Masah'sa, Minister of Fi- j
nance.
Ohlpashi Gitotpu, Minister of Justice.
Hayashi Yuzo, Minister of Comrnunlca- ,
tions.
Olshi Masnmi, Minister of Agriculture !
and Cornm* ne.
Olaki Yukio. Minister of Education.
Katsura Taro. Minister of War.
Count Saigo Judo, Minister for the '
Navy.
The resignation of Marquis Ito came
upon the Japanese us a thunderbolt from !
a clear sky. The recent formation of the
powerful Constitutional party, from the
United ranks of the Liberals and Progres- ;
slonlPts. doubtless Led observers of Japa- j
nese politics to come to the conclusion i
thai at the forthcoming general elections
the Government would be badly worsted, j
but Tt would scarcely have been expected
that Marquis Ito would "throw up tha
sponge" before the struggle commenced. )
It was given out that the Premier was |
forming a Government party in opposition
to the new Constitutional alliance. From i
what has since occurred it set-ms that the |
Marquis has found this to be a hopeless
task.
AGUIMALDC KILLS A
SPANIARD IN DUEL
VICTORIA, July 19.â The steamer Em-
prpss of India which arrived from Hong
kong to-day had among her passengers
Captain D. Hodgson, who commanded
the revenue cutter McCulloch during the
; tattle of Manila. Captain Hodgson Is on
I his way to San Francisco.
According to the iiongkong papers Ad
miral Dlederiehs, commander of the Ger
man Beet at Manila, is credited with the
statement that he will prevent Admiral
I >ewey from bombarding Munlla or any
'â  port.
It is reported also that a Spanish regi
ment met a force led by Agulnaldo, and
the Spanish captain challenged Agui
naldo to mortal combat before the battle
; began. The offer was accepted and the
â . duel resulted In the fatal wounding of
the Spanish officer.
The Spanish Governor at Tulu Straits
settlement fears an American Invasion.
He stops on a snmll grunboat and is ready
: for a hurried flight. The colony is mak
ing preparations to resist attack by or
ganizing volunteer forces. The Govern
i or's difficulties are increased by a threat
i ened rebellion.

tary Montgomery was present and

the attempt to besmirch his character
and blackmail him was S. N. Weltman,
brother of his former wife. Weitman,
who is now a student at the California
Medical College at Oakland, had
charged him with having poisoned Mrs.
Sponogle, but two physicians who at
tended his wife would prove the accu
sation untrue. Now Weitman and
Frost had leagued themselves together
to ruin him.
Of the charge that he caused the ruin
of a Fresno young woman he claimed
he had already been cleared.
Dr. Sponogle admitted he had a
brother with a bad reputation. He ex
pressed a desire for a speedy investiga
tion, as he felt confident of clearing
himself of the charges. He has en
gaged Attorney Bowden to defend him
at the investigation. While the mem
bers would not talk of the matter they
hinted that Frost was weakening and
"falling down," and that he would
never appear to press the charges
against Sponogle.
CZAR GOULD CARES
NAUGHT FOR LAW
I Gives Positions to His Proteges, De
spite the Results of Competi
tive Examinations.
SAN JOSE, July 19.â According to
Frank H. Gould, the czar of Agnews.
all men and women are liars who utter
words of criticism of him or his pets
at the asylum. It will be Interesting
to have him explain some peculiar
things that appear in the records of the
institution that he has endeavored
faithfully and persistently to turn into
a personal political machine. Now,
while men and women may be addicted
to departing from the truth, it gener
ally is conceded that official public
records, like figures, do not indulge in
prevarication.
It has been Intimated that Director
Gould has been using every influence
that he can command to secure the po
; sltion of matron at the asylum for Miss
Louise Bambauer, one of his pets who
j was imported from Merced. As a pre
liminary to this vacancy had to be cre
ated, and this was accomplished by
driving the former incumbent. Miss
Ella Royce, to such a point of distrac
tion and indignation that she found it
desirable to purchase peace of mind
and the retention of self respect by re
signing. Not the least factor in the
I system of petty persecutions to which
Mins Koyce was subjected was Miss
B-:nbauer, who carried things with as
high a hand among the employes of the
institution as did Mr. Gould among the
directors and more important officials
of the asylum. Miss Bambauer made
little concealment of the fact that she
herself exempt from the rules and reg
ulations, and for the reason, as she
boasted, that she had Mr. Gould be
hind her.
Miss Bambauer also has T^rlded < her
self that she was to have the position
of matron, and it v ould appear from
recent developments that her ambi
tion is likely to be gratified, despite
laws, rules, regulations and instruc
tions from a higher authority than the
board of managers of the institution.
These have all been set aside up to
the present time, and Gould, czarllke,
haa constituted himself laws, rules,
regulations and instructions unto him
self. If his programme is carried out
Miss Bambauer will be the matron,
though the legal obstacles to her hold
ing this position would be Insurmount
able to the Individual not endowed with
the gigantic pall of Gould.
On the minutes of the institution un
der date of October 13. 1897. appears the
following communication from the
State Board of Lunacy.
At a meeting of the State Commission
in Lunacy, held in San Francisco on Fri-
I day, September 24, the following resolu
| tio'n was adopted:
Resolved, That when there are any va
cancies to be filled among the officers or
employes of any State hospital, other
than those of medical superintendent and
assistant physicians and internes, the
medical superintendent of the hospital
where such vacancies have occurred or
are about to occur shall send to the State
Commission in Lunacy a copy of such
questions as '.n his opinion should be
asked candidates for the position or posi
tions in question, Informing the commis
sion at the same time on what day he de
sires to hold the examination of said can
didates.
The commission shall carefully revise
such list of questions and shall select one
of its members to represent it at such
examination, which representative shall
take with him the questions to be asked
candidate?, as revised by the commission.
The examination shall be made by the
medical superintendent and the repre- '
sentative of the board of managers In
the presence of the representative of the
commission, and no person shall in future
be appointed to any position In any Stuta
hospital except in accord with this reso
lution, which is Intended to enforce para
graph EL subdivision b of section 6, article
II of the new State Lunacy Law, ap
proved March 31. 1807.
It is further suggested by the commis
sion that these examinations shall take
place as far as possible at regular Inter
vals from time to time, and that all ap
plications for positions shall be placed on
the eligible list in the order of their
merit. This will enable superintendents
to fill vacancies immediately when they
occur, without the necessity of having \
additional and special examinations. If
possible the commission would like to
have these examinations not more fre
quently than once in each quarter. Yours
truly, JOHN P. CARRIERE,
Secretary State Commission in Lunacy.
The part of the lunacy law referred
to in the foregoing provides for a civil
sen-ice examination of applicants for
appointments in State hospitals.
It will be seen by the Instructions
Issued by the State Board of Lunacy
that appointments must be made from
the list of those who passed the civil
service examination in the order of
merit.
On June 7 last the examinations were
held fur matron to fill the vacancy cre
ated by the resignation of Miss Royce.
The following is the list of applicants
with the percentages they obtained:
L. M. Holmes 94
L. J. Watkins 90
Olivia B. Williams 90
Louise Bambauer SS^fc
Aduline Fitzgerald 88
Alice B. Adorns 86
Alicia P. Fogarty 77
Miss Louise Bambauer, though
fourth In the order of merit. Is now
acting matron, having been placed in
that position by Medical Superintend
ent Sponogle on the order of Mr. Gould,
and the programme is to appoint her to
the position of matron at the August
meeting of the board. Gould wants
her there, and that is enough for Di
rectors Hale and Curnow, who, with
Gould, constitute a majority of the
board.
When the record of the civil service
examination was called to the atten
tion of Chairman Curnow, and he was
asked why Miss Bambauer was se
lected for preferment, he made this ex
planation:
"Miss Holmes was not given the po
sition of matron because she has poor
sight. She knows a great deal about
the work of the position, it is true, as
she had some years experience at the
Stockton asylum, but her optical afflic
tion stands in her way.
"Mrs. Watklns was considered too
old for the position.
"Mrs. Ollva B. Williams was not con
sidered eligible. She had made serious
charges against Mr. Tourtillott that
she had not proved, and she practically
had been discharged."
It should be stated that all applicants
for positions in the asylum before being
permitted to take the civil service ex
amination must undergo a physical ex
amination, and no exception was made
in this instance. The physical examin
ations were made by Dr. J. F. Christal
and Dr. Leonard Stocking, both assist
ant physicians at the hospital.
It remains to be seen if â¢ the State
Board of Lunacy will permit this wan
ton overriding of the law and its spe
cific Instructions.
YELLOW FEVER
OF MILD TYPE
All the Surgeon General
Will Say.
HIS SILENCE SIGNIFICANT
SITUATION LESS HOPEFUL AT
SANTIAGO.
Process of Separating the Men Goes
Constantly On â Bed Cross
Nurses for Government
Hospitals.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 19.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: All General
Sternberg would say to-day touching
the epidemic at Santiago was that he
had reason to believe the fever was of
a mild type, but the general has stated
to me that it is genuine yellow fever,
and to-day when I asked him if he
would say whether there had been an
increase in the number of deaths or
number of cases in the last twenty
four hours he replied that he could not
give anything for publication. This
statement taken in connection with
others to-day does not seem so hopeful
as the returns which have been given
out during the last few days, but as
many cases are probably now ap
proaching their worst stages, this may
account for the significant silence of
the surgeon general. He seems grati
fied, however, that the hospital relief
vessel Resolute had left New York this
afternon with Immune nurses and doc
tors, a full supply of medical stores
and hospital tents. Moreover, a second
expedition will leave Tampa just as
soon as there is a vessel to take them.
A report is in circulation that Gen
eral Steinberg has accepted the Red
Cross nurses in the Government hos
pitals at Santiago. He said, however,
that on the recommendation of Mrs.
Whitelaw Reid he had accepted twenty
Red Cross nurses, ten for the hospital
at Camp Thomas and ten for the hos
pital at Fortress Monroe. The process
of separating the men at Santiago goes
constantly on, and it is felt now that
notwithstanding reports which must
vary from day to day, the situation
under the experienced hand of General
Sternberg will be under control at an
early day.

Being Afraid of Losing the Eagle's

Destroys the Steamer.
Special dispatch to The Call ana the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor

KEY WEST, Fla., July 19.â From an
officer of the Nashville, which arrived
here to-day from the blockading squad
ron, off the coast of Cuba, I bave ob
tained the following additional details
regarding the destruction of the Span
ish steamer Santo Domingo, while she
was endeavoring to break the blockade
off the south side of the island on July
12. The auxiliary cruiser Eagle, Lieu
tenant W. EL 11. Sgutherland, com
manding, chased the Santo Domingo,
an armed merchant steamer, off Cape
Frances on the south coast of Cuba.
In attempting to go through the nar
row, crooked channel the Santo Do
mingo went hard aground.
A boat with an officer wr.3 sent to the
Santo Domingo, which was found to be
armed with two 6-inch Hontoria guns,
fifty Mauser rifles and revolvers. The
guns were loaded. No attempt at re
sistance was made, although the Santo
Domingo in speed and armament and
number of crew was much superior to
the Eagle, which is armed with slx
pounder guns only.
From the papers found on the Santo
Domingo it was discovered that aboard
her were several military personages

SPLENDID MARINE PAGEANT
A STRANGE TRANSFORMATION
SCENE,
Daily Incidents in and Around the
Quaint Old City Since the
American Flag Was
Hoisted.
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO HARBOR, July 18 (via
Kingston, July 19). â Santiago is now a
city of silence. The American flag
waves over the military headquarters
and on Morro's flagstaff, and Red Cross
emblems are as plentiful as church
spires.
Almost the entire population this aft
ernoon Is gathered about the wharves,
where the Spanish shipping, now prizes
of the United States,- will soon be aug
mented by a large fleet of transports
flying the American colors.
Some stores, mostly Intended for the
Bale of liquor or drugs, are open, but
their patrons are few. Beggars are In
evidence of the same importunate sort
which make Havana unpleasant for
foreigners. Now and then a man or
woman of the better class begs the cor
respondents for "milk for my little one,
in the name of God."
i At the dock, where the Red Cross
steamer State of Texas is unloading
and preparing for a long stay, a guard
from the Ninth Infantry has been
mounted, but the soldiers have had lit
tle trouble except from the Inroads of
bad boys.
There is no evidence of gloom on the
faces of the Spanish men and women.
These mercurial people are already
laughing and are pleased at the mili
tary and naval show, and at the pros
pect of getting food other than rice and
salt meats.
Nearly all the better class of houses
are closed. The residents evidently
have not yet returned from El Caney
and other suburban places to which
they lied on threat of bombardment by
the land and sea forces of the United
States. Filth is noticeable everywhere,
and, strange to say, the city is healthy
in spite of it. But if Santiago is to
continue healthy much sanitary work
Is necessary. Arrangements, therefore,
are now under way to remove the most
dangerous features and to improve
those which tend to purify the city.
The harbor of Santiago de Cuba is a
very beautiful place, with its high
ramparts of mountains, groves of cocoa
palms, banana trees and flowering
shrubs pushing down to th ! very brink
of the bay. The channel is tortuous
and marked by bright blue and white
buoys, or more clearly denned in places
by long booms of logs marking the en
trance of shallow bays and inlets. Old
churches, forts and bastions share the
promontories with light wooden houses,
which are the summer residences of the
upper classes.
The harbor was the scene of a beau
tiful marine pageant this afternoon. A
Bcore or more of American transports,
the way being pointed out by the Su
wanee, glided majestically to the quiet
anchorage, something they had not en
joyed for week 3, being compelled In
stead to stand out to sea at night, to
be tossed about by the waves, or to use
the precarious holding grounds off Bai
quiri. They are fine boats, many of
them being among the largest speci
mens of the American merchant ma
rine.
Nearly all bedecked with flags, they
steamed in proudly, making a goodly
show extending over a mile of water.
A dispatch boat of the 'Associated
Press, on its way out to sea, saluted
each of the transports with blasts from
the siren of the Almirante Oquendo,
taken from that Bhin some days ago
and put in place by the enthusiastic
crew of the dispatch boat. The salutes
were returned not only from the trans
ports but by the cheers of the men on
board them, who had long looked for
ward to this feature of the campaign
How soon the Spanish troops Mill be
loaded on these transports for ship
ment to their homes man" of them
have not seen for three years or more
cannot be announced at present. But
it is understood the delay will be as
short as possible.
The big Government tug Potomac ar
rived here to-day from New Orleans
She is provided with modern appli
ances for wrecking and, with the other
vessels sent here for the same purpose,
will secure all it is possible to save
from the ships which formed Admiral
Cervera's squadron.
The long bridge at Aguadores. on the
Juragua Railroad, connecting Slboney
with Santiago, has been replaced in a
and passengers. The Eagle began pre
parations to float the Santo Domingo
when several steamers were sighted
coming from toward Batabano.
Lieutenant Southerland immediately
decided to burn and destroy the Santo
Domingo, lest by any chance she
should be recaptured and the enemy
should gain the valuable cargo, which
consisted of fifty head of cattle, large
quantities of provisions, clothing and
supplies, and corn and grain in bulk.
Most valuable, however, were her
two 12-inch guns intended doubtless to
strengthen the fortifications of Ha
vana. The steamer was accordingly
burned to the water's edge, nothing but
the hull remaining. The guns were
ruined. The steamers sighted coming
from Batabano, seeing the Santo Do
mingo afire, put back.
The Santo Domingo was of 2800 tons,
fourteen and a half knots speed, and
was one of the first steamers furnished
the Spanish Government by the Com
panies Transatlantique of Barcelona
for use In the present war.
The Eagle wil be remembered as the
little vessel that fought the Spanish gun
boat Galicla at Cienfuegos in May last
until the Galicla was driven back by
the Marblehead. The Eagle was the
yacht Almy of New York, formerly
owned by Frederick Gallatin, and was
one of the first yachts purchased and
converted Into an auxiliary man-of
war by the Government.
temporary fashion by American sol
diers. The work was completed to
day, and as soon as possible the mili
tary authorities will use the railroad to
transport from the seaboard the stores,
horseH, munitions, etc., which were un
loaded at Siboney before the surrender
of Santiago.

Following is the circular "explaining" the "chain" Idea-
The actual horrors of war will soon begin. Our boys in blue go forth
to the battlefield to sustain the right and honor of our homes and country
Their sufferings and privations will necessarily be gTeat and are too well
known to need d< BcripUon. Is it not our bounden duty to help alleviate these
to as great an extent as lies within one's power?
The American Soldiers* Relief Society has devised a plan for aiding the
above cause in a way which will prove financially material, if the following
requests are carefully executed:
Firstâ lnclose 10 cents in silver or stamps addressed to the American
Soldiers' Relief Society, 105 O'FarreU street, San Francisco.
Secondâ Make and send an exa.-t copy of this letter to three of your
friends, who will do the same, thereuy forming a continuous chain. All
copies word for word from X to X inclusive.
Thirdâ Number all three of your letters alike, progressing one number
above the number of the letter received by you. Number 20 completes the
chain and persons receiving that number will write no further. A failure
to send these copies as requested will break the chain. As a personal favor
I trust you will give this a kind and immediate attention.

The American Soldiers' Relief Society
has instituted a "chain" of letters which
should it remain unbroken would bankrupt
the world long 1 before it could bo carried
to the point its instigators have set for
a finish. The money to be derived
in this manner the officers of the society
claim .they are to turn, over to the Red
Cross, and the president and secretary
stated yesterday that they had already
donated a small amount to the cause.
Prominent officers of the Red Cross deny
that any money has been received from
the Relief Society, and they further state
it is their belief that the organization is
a fraud.
The "chain" letter from the Relief So
which is given in another place,
has been sent all over the city and State,
yet it is claimed by Dr. W. G. Sylvester

letters Inclosing the 10 cents have been re

A little figuring on the amount to becol

has made Sfiss Schenk acquainted with
the enormity of her scheme and it is said
she wants some one to help her let go of
the undertaking.

ON THE BIG CANAL
Congressman de Vries Predict 3 One
Important Result of the War
"Vv'th Spain.
SACRAMENTO, July IS.â Marlon de
Vries, Congressman from the Second Dis
trict, has returned from Washington. He
was Interviewed by a Bee reporter, and,
in answer to a question as to what
seemed to be the sentiment in Congress
regarding the Philippine Islands, he said:
"The prevailing sentiment is not to en
ter upon a decisive policy until the close
of thr war, unless ft is made necessary by
an earlier development. The reason for
this is that the attitude assumed by the
I'nitod States toward the Philippines will
be determined by our final treaty with
Spain. The position of every man in Con
gress on this question will undoubtedly
be influenced to a very great extent by
the strong feeling in the country reflect
ed by the press and through Congressmen
who reflect more or less of the views of
their constituents. There is a sentiment
among the American people that where
the American flag is once raised it should
never come down."
When ask^d if th*Â» war would hasten
the building of the Nicaragua canal Con
gressman de Vries replied:
"It undoubtedly will. I look for the
preliminary work on this matter during
the short session. The construction of
the canal will be entered upon during the
fifty-sixth session undoubtedly."
"What will be the effect of the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty?" was asked.
"Oh. the general impression is that that
offers no obstacle â none that is insur
mountable, at least. The truth is that I
have not heard that discussed much in
ectlon with the canal. England
!. I feel certain, be very glad to see
.;!<! the canal, and we would never
want to close it to her unless at war with
which I trust will never be. Eng
land's attitude toward us during our war
with Spain has been such that we cannot
help but feel friendly toward her."
OBTAINED COUNTY COIN
ON ILLEGAL CLAIMS
School Superintendent Chipman in
Trouble With Santa Clara
Supervisors.
SAN* JOSE, July 18.â The members of
the County Board of Education were be
fore the Board of Supervisors this after
noon upon citations issued to give testi
mony in regard to alleged irregularities
discovered in the bills of County Superin
tendent of Schools L. J. Chipman. The
bills in question are one of May 26, for
$o4 70 on expense account in visiting
county schools, and another presented on
June 30 for $120 for services as secretary
of the County Board of Education.
The Finance Committee of the Super
visors, in going over the claims, discov
ered that Superintendent Chipman had
charged for services as secretary on the
name day that he had presented charges
for livery hire in visiting the country
schools. By this means, it was alleged,
some $45 had been overcharged.
Superintendent Chipman, H. M. Bland
and Cornelia M. Farley, members of the
Board of Education, were examined.
Superintendent Chipman said that now
that his attention had been called to the
fact he fpâ that he had erroneously
charged the board for services, but that It
was his ignorance of the law that misled
mm. He could not tell whether he had
been present at all the meetings of the
board, as in many cases the members
checked over the pupils' examination pa
pers at their homes. Miss Farley and
Mr. Bland could not remember just what
meetings Chipman had been present at
and confirmed what he had said about
papers being examined at home.
Mr. Chipman offered to correct his bills
to conform to the law as he now under
stood it. but the Supervisors deferred ac
tion and appointed an expert to examine
all the books of the superintendent.
Superintendent Chipman's salary was
attached to-day by David Walsh to en
force the payment on a note for $482
Chipiftan made some years ago.
VOTERS SLOW TO REGISTER.
Backward in Paving the Way to the
Sacramento Ballot Box.
SACRAMENTO, July 18.â The political
pot is simmering quietly at the capital,
but is apt to reach a boiling point very
soon. The Republican County Commit
tee held a meeting yesterday and decided
to take active steps toward securing reg
istration. For some unaccountable and
inexplicable reason the voters are back
ward In registering, and the necessity of
urging them to that important duty is
apparent. The committee decided to ask
the County Clerk for a greater number
of registration clerks and the request will
no doubt be granted.
During the last month a dozen or more
Republican clubs have been organized
throughout the city, and all of them are
in a healthy condition. The prospects foi
a sweeping Republican victory in Sacra
mento County were never brighter.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 1898.
NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
MAJOR GENERAL DICKINSON
WILL REPORT THIS WEEK.
The State Will Probably Make a
Demand on the War Depart
ment for Money i)ue It.
Major General Dickinson -will return to
this city on Wednesday, and he will then
present to the board of location the re
sult of his observations in the limits of
the First Brigade. Upon that report will
be arranged the plan of reorganizing the
several companies in that territory.
He will also present a partial report of
the condition of affairs in that portion of
the Third Brigade which he could visit on
his way from the south. The limits of
the Third Brigade embrace the greatest
number of counties, namely: Alpine, Ara
ador. Butte, Colusa, Calaveras, El Dora
do, Fresno, Glenn, Inyo, Kern, Kings,
Lassen, Mariposa, Merced, Madera, Mo
doc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San
Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Shasta, Siski
you. Sierra, Sacramento, Solano, Tuo
lumne, Tulare, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo and
Yuba. In this territory there were the
Second and Sixth regiments of infantry,
each having eight companies. The com
panies of the Second were located as fol
lows: A at Chlco; B, Colusa; C, Nevada
City; D, Marysville; E, Sacramento; F,
Woodland; G, Sacramento; H, Redding;
and I, Grass Valley. Sixth Regiment: A,
Stockton; B, Stockton; C, Fresno; D, Mo
desto; E, Visalia; G, Bakersfield; and H,
Merced.
The Government of the United States
is Indebted to the State of California
something in excess of $100,000, for what
the State furnished the National Guards
men when they were mustered into the
volunteer service. It is probable that be
fore the reorganization is effected the
State will make a demand for this sum in
order to have funds with which to equip
the new organization.
What provision will be made to en
able National Guardsmen of California
to return to the several commands to
which they formerly belonged has created
some talk among men who still take an
interest in such matters. The prevailing
opinion Is that those who have gone to
the front, and particularly those of the
Sixth and Seventh Infantry who have
not yet been sent to the front, will, by the
time they have been mustered out, have
had all the soldiering they want, and that
they will be glad to resign their places to
ambitious men, willing to wear the uni
form of the State. The only serious fea
ture that there is in the matter of organ
izing a new guard is that of officers.
There is a desire to give those who are
now in the service an opportunity to re
turn to their former commands, should
they so wish, but if new officers are com
missioned, there will not be any opening
for the old ones upon their return. It has
been suggested as a way out of the diffi
culty that officers on the retired list be
detailed for active duty. If that is done
these can be relieved at any time to make
room for those who shall return, and
should they, or any of them, refuse to re
turn to their respective commands, then
new officers can be commissioned.
Colonel Dolphes EU- Fairbanks of the
Fifth Regiment of Infantry, who was not
commissioned when his regiment and
part of the Second Infantry were merged
into the Eighth California Volunteers,
has filed an application to be placed on
the retired list. The colonel was a cadet
at the California Academy from 1872 to
1^74; captain at that academy in 1874;
with the University of California Cadets
from 1^74 to lSi.; was commissioned cap
tain of the University of California
Cadets May 16, 1ST"; captain of Company
C. Fifth Infantry, October 10, ISS2; major
of the Fifth, February 8, 18S8; lieutenant
colonel, October 20, 1889, and colonel of
the regiment, April 26, 1890.
Shortly before the call for volunteers
J. W. F. Diss, then major on the staff
of Brigadier General Last and inspector
of the First Brigade, held the annual in
spection, but the returns were not trans
mitted to him until last week. He re
ceived them at his new station at Fort
Point, where he is now a lieutenant of
heavy artillery. United States Volunteers.
Of the five men from the Second Brig
ade Signal Corps who were mustered into
the volunteer signal corps, three have up
to date been promoted from first-class
privates to sergeants. These are Thorn
hill Carmany, H. F. Juts and P. C.
Knapp. When the Indiana sailed there
were five sets of chevrons for non
commissioned officers placed on board
and these were to be distributed before
the vessel reaches Manila. Up to the
time that the vessel reached Honolulu
but two seta had been awarded. Car
many, who remained in this city at Camp
Merritt. will probably sail with the next
expedition.
What there is left in this city of the
naval militia still reports at headquarters
on the Marion. At the meeting last Tues
day night there were about thirty-five
men. who were drilled by Lieutenant W.
E. Elliott.
Lieutenant Commander T. A. Nerney
is, in the absence of Captain Turner,
now in command of the scouting vessel
Iroquois, in command of the militia.
Lieutenant C. C. Dennis is the executive
officer of the Marion.
Lieutenant C. V. Otto, commanding the
Fifth Division of the militia, located at
Eureka, Humboldt County, was in this
city last week and he stated that the
men of his command are very much dis
appointed because they have not been
called into the service.
COMES DIRECT FROM
THE CAMP OF GOMEZ
WASHINGTON, July 18.â Lieutenant
Ahem brought to Secretary Alger to
day a report of the expedition which
carried supplies to General Gomez in
the Florida and Fanita. The expedi
tion was under the command of Lieu
tenant Johnson, Tenth Cavalry, who
has remained in charge to see that the
arms and supplies are distributed ac
cording to the wishes of the United
States Government.
Lieutenant Ahem comes direct from
the Cuban general, whose headquarters
is near Sancti Spiritus, in the province
of Santa Clara, and brings important
reports from General Gomez to Secre
tary Alger. General Gomez was found
to have about 5000 men poorly armed
and equipped, and with very little in
the way of supplies. The supplies sent
by the United States will enable Go
mez to fully equip his troops and make
it possible for them to be of some use
in expelling the Spanish from the isl
and.
Further supplies will be sent to Go
mez, so as to enable him to maintain
his army in the interior of Cuba. Lieu
tenant Johnson will remain in com
mand of the troops of United States
soldiers at Gomez's camp, and will con
tinue to represent the United States
Government.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 19.â Midsummer dullness
was the characteristic of the stock market to
day. These who have money to buy stocks on
a large seal.' and those who have large holding.-)
to sell seemed to have gone off for a holiday
outing. I'be bear element among the small
room traders took advantage of the dullness to
hammer at the list here and there. They sold
down Metropolitan Street Railway" with some
confidence. They had in their favor a rumor of !
yellow fever among the troops at Tampa and
the weak traffic statement of St. Paul for the
second week in July, showing that the decrease
In earnings compared with last year of nearly
$47,000 helped them.

to 13 points higher than they were a year ago, I
but 111 the meantime dividend rat's' have In
many cases been Increased and extra dividends
disbursed. The world's available supply of
breadstufls is not materially greater than It
was a year ago, but this country is assured of i
the largest crop in its history, and the crop
of the world cannot yet be reliably estimated.
The price of wheat is In consequence held back
and farmers are not bringing the new crop
forward, thus keeping down the earnings of the
grain-carrying roads.
Bonds were featureless, except that Denver
and Gulf firsts advanced 2 points, with a sub
sequent reaction. Total sales. $2,540,000.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, July 19.â Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were stagnant to-day, except for
Grand Trunk, which was steadily sold by weak
i bulls and by some bears. It is believed that
' when the present weak holders are cleared out
! a sharp reaction may follow.
t 1 At present the weakness In Grand Trunk Is
assisted by the dullness In Americans.^ which
: were absolutely neglected to-day. The weak
ness In Grand Trunk Is not surprising consid
ering the falling off in traffic returns and the
â  continuance of the rate war.
! The' New York demand for bonds continues.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 19.â The urgency of the de
mand for the cash article and the early
strength developed by Corn started Wheat firm.
First trades for September delivery were at
from G7*,c to 67\c. whereas it closed yesterday
at 67VÂ»Â©67V4c. Calls for the day were at from
67*0 to 67%e. so that the sellers yesterday
afternoon of those privileges were at once made
anxious. Another encouraging feature was tile
fact that while the receipts of new \\ neat
were on the Increase there was a sufficient
demand to absorb It all. Bradstreets reported
a decrease of 6.745.000 bushels in the world s
visible. 4,526,000 bushels decrease last year, and
that was supposed to be the cause for a con
siderable rise in prices that started about the
middle of the session. Later, however, it was
found that those who by the heaviness of their
purchases contributed chiefly to the advance
were influenced by the reported damage by
heat to spring Wheat in the Northwest. As a
result of these reports September \\ heat that
had been listless and fearfully dull all fore
noon at about 67Va67Â»^c became strong and ;
active and rose to sT%Â©67%c. Prices sagged a
trifle near the close on pr nt taking. Septem
ber closed iv 4c4 c higher at 6SH@6!>VaC. December
gained IVÂ»C. closing at 68 Vic.
Corn had two phases, a bull one early on
i high temperature and a dry weather map and
, a bear one later on predictions of general
t showers. The opening was at %@VÂ»e advance .
on good covering by belated shorts who had
staved out until their position assumed a very
dismal outlook. The market did not get be
yond the opening quotations, however, as heavy
realizing by scattered holders cnecked the up
ward tendency. Prices ruled steadily at the
advance until thunderstorms and cooler
weather were predicted and the crowd lost no
time ' In getting out short lines. September
broke sharply and left oft VÂ»@V4c lower on the
a A. good cash demand held Oats steady de
spite the slump in Corn. The close was un-

demand and higher hop prices. Packers were
liberal sellers and loaded the market every time
a buyer showed himself. Yellow fever rumors

Captain James Johnson
Passes Away.
MILLIONAIRE SHIP OWNER
CARRIED MATERIAL FOR THE
RAILROAD.
Died After Three Months of Suf
fering, Surrounded by His
Large Family of
Children.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July IS.
James Johnson, the millionaire ship
owner and commission merchant of San
Francisco, died at his home on Claremont
avenue, Temesca.l, last night, after a
three months' illness. He leaves a widow
and eleven children to mourn his depar
ture. Death has been anticipated for the
past week, and all of the children have
been at home, doing all that could be sug
ested to ease his declining hours. Death
was due to heart trouble.
Captain Johnson was a native of Den
mark, aged 62 years. He early entered
upon a seaman's life, and served as quar
termaster upon vessels plying between his
native land and Central and South Ameri
can ports. In 1v",2 he came to California
and began running schooners upon the
Sacramento River. This was before the
Central Pacific Railroad was constructed,
lit- was engaged for eighteen months in
delivering railroad material at Sacra
mento.
In 1870 he moved to Rio Vista and form
ed a partnership with the man with whom
he has ever since been associated,
Mr Emigh. Besides owning four schoon
ers, th<\v opened a warehouse and lumber
business. whl<~h they conducted until ISB9.

PROSPEROUS
Annual Reports to the
Directors.
SAME OFFICERS RE-ELECTED
810 IMPROVEMENTS . MADE
: DUEING THE YEAR.
An Active, Progressive Policy Will
Be Continued by the Managing
Board â Some Interesting
Facts.
The annual meeting of the trustees and
directors of the Valley road was held yes
terday by the former for the purpose of
electing officers for the ensuing year, and
by the latter to receive the annual re
ports of Chief Engineer Storey and Sec
retary Mackte.
The trustees re-elected the present
board Jn its entirety to hold office for an
other year. The affairs of the Valley
road will again be under the control of
the following: President, Claus Spreck
els; first vice president, Robert Watt;
second vice president. Captain A. H.
Payson; secretary, Alexander Mackie;
counsel. E. F. Preston. The remaining
directors are: John D. Spreck<*ls, J. B.
Stetson, Charles Holbrook, Leon Sloss.
Alvinza Hayward, Isaac Upham, Thomas
Magee and James A. Hooper.
The financial report shows that the
road Is In a very flourishing condition.
It is two years since the Valley road has
been in operation and the profits of this
year's management show a large increase
over the net gains of last year. The ex
penses have been great, owing to the
vast amount of construction under way;
yet. with all the difficulties which the
road has met In its manipulation,- the
financial sheets show a considerable net
profit.
The report of Chief Engineer Storey for
the year shows the extensive improve
ments made and the present status of tho
road in regard to constructions along the
different lines. During the year the final
selection for the road between Point
Richmond and Stockton was made. This
runs west from Stockton across the tule
marshes to the uplands on the west side,
then northwest, passing through a strip
of producing country to Antioch, where
It passes along the water front from that
point parallel to Bay Point. It then runs
south of that line to Pacheco, landing
at the head of the Pacheco Slough, from
which point it climbs the grade to Frank
lin tunnel, back of Martinez. From that
point it descends along Rodeo Creek,
crossing Pinole Creek, and then
runs parallel to the Southern Pacific
lino at a distance of about one-quarter
mile east to San Pablo station. Crossing
the Southern Pacific road at that point it
runs to Point Richmond.
In the San Joaquin Valley all rights
of way have been secured. On the line
from Stockton to Point Richmond a large
number of the rights of way have been
obtained, more particularly where the
heavy work of the road is being carried
out. Negotiations have been pending for
the balance.
During the year the line was complete!
to Visalia and Bakersfleld, and the heavy
grading from Visalia through Tulare to
a Junction with the line south from Han
ford is very nearly completed. Nearly
all the necessary buildings on the line as
far south as Hanford and on the line to
Visalia are finished. Work is progressing
on the line from Hanford to Bakersfleld.
A great amount of ballasting has been
done between Stockton and Fresno, over
forty-eight miles of this work having
been completed .during the year.
On the line from Stockton to Point
Richmond the heavy portions of the work
have been covered, especially on the
Franklin tunnel. On this work the ap
proaches have been taken out and con
tracts let for tunneling. Satisfactory
progress has been made on both ends of
the Franklin bore. Contracts have been
let or road i WO <K. six mile* on each end
of the tunnel, with the purpose of having
all work outside the tunneling completed
when that Is finished. Work has also
been started on the unreclaimed tule
land west of Stockton. Three largo dredir-

Extensions on the road southward will
be followed as fast as possible by opening
the line for business. On September iff

EXCUSED FROM JURY DUTY.
Judge Greene Delivers Quite a Poro

The clerk explained that a mistake had

plied the court, "and now let me make
it so plain that I can be understood,

Hundred Thousand Dollar Estate.
OAKLAND, July 19.-Frank F. Titus,
son of Daniel Titus, the pioneer San Fran
cisco attorney, who died at his home in
this city last week, has filed a petition
for the probate of his father's will. The
estate is valued at $100,000, of which $2S -
660 Is in real estate, the balance being
cash in hand and stocks of various kinds.
The deceased declares all of his property
to be community property, to which his
widow is entitled to half. The petitioner

In the way of equipment 100 box cars
nave been added and four locomotives. In
the near future the rolling stock of the
company will be Increased by two loco

An active and progressive policy has
been adopted by the present officers of
the road, and this will be continued. The
reports were received by the directors
with great satisfaction, and everything
points to another successful year." Tlie
drought militated very strongly against a
large freight traffic business, which the
road would have had this year had the
crops been abundant.
According to tue financial report there
is sufficient money on hand to build the
road from Stockton to Point Richmond
and to begin on various contemplated
improvements.
The building of two steel ferryboats will
be an undertaking begun In the near fu
ture. When the line is completed to Oak
land connections with transcontinental
lines will receive serious attention by the
Valley Road officials.
Steamers to Stockton.
The new river steamer H. J. Corcoran
is to make her initial trip from tockton
to San Francisco to-night. She Is one of
the best equipped river steamers in the
Vnited States, and is expected to de
velop a speed of 20 knots an hour when
her machinery has worked down to its
bearings. The Corcoran Is to run in con
nection with the Valley road, and will
leave here every morning In the week at
8 o'clock. She will leave Stockton every
night at 6 o'clock and will land her pas
sengers at the ferries in time for them to
catch at least the last car uptown. With
the advent of the new steamer the boat
that used to leave here every Sunday
night will be discontinued.
The H. J. Corcoran was named after
tho able and indefatigable manager of the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company, who has done so much toward
putting the concern in the front rank of
transportation companies. She will be
commanded by Captain McMurtry of the
J. D. Peters, while Captain Holdsworth
will assume command of the Peters.
Henry Ryan, the jolly assistant engin
eer of the Harbor Commission, has Tost
some faith in his Judgment when string
ers are under consideration. He and Dave
Reese, foreman for Healy. i lbbitts & Co.,
were on Lombard-street wharf yesterday,
â¢wh<^n Reese remarked, "There's a rotten
stringer, Henry. It ought to be replaced."
"Hal ha!" laughed jovial Henry; "that
i stringer rotten? Why, look here," and
Mr. Ryan's 220 pounds avordupois began
to jump up and down on the beam. The
stringer was rotten. There was a crack
and then Mr. Ryan was out of sight.
He had plunged feet foremost Into the
, bay, and when he came up he had not
wind enough left to yell for help. Reese
threw him a rope and he held on until a
; boat came along and rescued him.
There was an interesting battle In the
Wharfinger's office on Main-street wharf
yesterday. The combatants were two
fair young creatures who make a living
by peddling soap and selling lottery tick

ley Pratt was (much against his will)
referee. One of the young ladles is a
handsome brunette, and her flashing
black eyes have made many a conquest
on the water front. The other is a blonde
and equally good looking In her way, and
both thought they had captivated the
handsome Mr. Pratt. Unluckily, while
( harley was whispering soft nothings to
the fair one yesterday his dark-eyed
beauty walked Into the Wharfinger's of
fice. Then there was music In the air,
and in a few seconds handfuls of hair
strewed the floor. It was scratch as
scratch can for a few minutes, and then
the dark one, finding she was getting the
I worst of it, grabbed an ink bottle and
, threw it at her rival. As much of the
fluid went over the one as the other, and
now both of them are mourning spoilt

BOARD OF TRUSTEES.
Bids Rejected Because They Had No
Revenue Stamps on Them.
ALAMEDA, July 19.â At the meeting of
the Board of Trustees last night bids
were opened for the improvement of En
cinal avenue. Several parties submitted
propositions, but upon examination it was
found that only two had the necessary
revenue stamps affixed. They were ac
cordingly thrown out, much to the sur
prise of the bidders, who had evidently
forgotten all about the new revenue law.
The Alice-street bridge matter came up
again, and there was a discussion as to

Alfred Gilder Missing.
ALAMEDA, July 19.â The friends of
Alfred Gilder, formerly of Bay Farm Isl

him. He had worked for ten years for
Amos McCartney, but about two months
ago had words with him and quit. He
went to Sonoma County to look after a
place belonging to him, but soon returned
and called on a friend here and made an
appointment for the next evening. He did
not keep the engagement, however, and
has not since been seen. His friends are
greatly worried, and some of them are
inclined to think he has committed sui
cide.

At the meeting of the executive boards
of the local and State society yesterday
Judge Sheldon made his initial appear
ance. After expressing his surprise at
the wonderful work the State organiza
tion had accomplished and congratulating
them on their endeavors the Judge clear
ly stated the standing of the Red Cross
Society. He said it was a legal organiza
tion and therefore had the support of the
President and the highest court in the
United States.
"The first principle to keep In mind,"
he said, "is not to be in the way In time
of war, but to always be on hand when
needed." He stated that without excep
tion the California society was one of the
best organized In the world and he could
therefore offer no advice. He was pleased
to see how the financial accounts were
kept and suggested that It would be a
good plan to send weekly reports to New
York. He told of the society having four
hospital ships In Cuban waters and ex
plained how the work was carried on by
the executive committee. In concluding
the Judge stated that although the
nurses were paid Clara Barton never re
ceived a cent; that whenever she was
not on duty she was the guest of the As

was listened to with interest and was
generously applauded.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 19.
Miss Adeline Wellendorf, a talented
young music teacher of Berkeley, accept
ed the bantering invitation of C. C. Clay
Sunday evening to walk from Mendenhall
Springs to Livermore, and by doing the
feat yesterday won a wager by the terms
of which Mr. Clay was to walk from Liv
ermore to Oakland alone. After she saw
Mr. Clay well on his way in the hot sun
she took a stage and returned to the
Springs to await a letter telling her of
the accomplishing of the trip. But the
chivalry ln Mr. Clay's Southern blood
failed him for once and he betrayed the
confidence that Miss Wellendorf had
placed in his honor and took a train from
Pleasanton for home.
Mr. Clay, who is quite popular with the
young ladies of this county, has been on
a summer vacation at the Springs. He
spent many pleasant hours with Miss
Wallendorf with a shady tree and a ham
mock thrown in. As the time drew near
for him to return to his duties he dread
ed the parting more and more. In an evil
hour he suggested Sunday evening that
she accompany him as far as Llvermore
for a walk. The distance is only twelve
miles, and as the young couple had often
walked that far on moonlight evenings
the young lady accepted the invitation.
Mr. Clay is nothing if not chivalrous, and
he pledged his word that if Mies Wellen

MOTHER
Marie Baldwin's Suit
for a Legacy.
SAYS SHE WAS IMPOSED UPON
TRANSFERRED STOCK VALUED
AT OVER $43,000.
She Did So Hoping to Reconcile Her
Mother, Who Is Bitterly Op
posed to Her Young
Husband.
Several years ago, when Mamie V.
Baird left her home to become the wife
of Barry Baldwin Jr., she left a sorrow
ing mother behind her.
The young woman's mothe*, Mrs. Ve
ronica C. Baird, was opposed to the hand
some son of the well-known United States
Marshal, Barry Baldwin. Why, no one
knew but her daughter, and she cared
naught for her mother's whims, defied
parental wrath and became a bride.
Now the differences of mother and
daughter have been carried Into the
courts and the chasm between .hem
broadens with each passing day. Yester
day a complaint was filed entitled "Marie
V. Baldwin against Veronica C. Baird,"
and heralded the Inauguration of a bit
ter legal contest over Interests In two
local corporations valued at over J43,000,
which, Mrs. Baldwin alleges, her mother
On April 1, 1896, states the complaint,
Mrs. Baldwin was the owner of a sepa
rate estate, consisting of 225 shares of the
capital stock of the California Powder
Works and 203 shares of the capital stock
of the Sausalito Land and Ferry Com
pany. All this stock was in the maiden
name of the plaintiff, but was in the
hands of her mother, Mrs. Baird, who
held It as guardian of her daughter dur
ing her minority. On April 21, the com
plaint continues, Mrs. Baird caused the
stock to be transferred into the married
name of her daughter. Mrs. Baird then
took the stock to Mrs. Baldwin and told
her that It was necessary for her to In
dorse. Mrs. Baldwin, who, at that time,
was unlearned and inexperienced, in
dorsed the stock without hesitation and
delivered it to her mother.
Mrs. Baird did not delay, but on the
same day had the stock transferred on
the books of the two corporations into
her own name. Mrs. Baldwin states that
she received no consideration for the val
uable stock, and simply transferred it in
trust to her mother under the following
circumstances: Mrs. Baldwin was ex
pecting to become a mother. She had mar
ric-d against the wishes of Mrs. Baird,
who still entertains an intense prejudice
against young Baldwin. Mrs. Baird,
states Mrs. Baldwin, reminded her of the
danger of her condition, and advised her
to transfer or dispose of the stock, so
that in the event of her death, her child,
or In event of the child's death also, her
brothers and her mother would be as
sured of the income from the property.
In hopes of reconciling her mother to her
marriage, and also fearful of what the
near future might have in store for her,
the daughter transferred the stock.
Months passed by, and on September 26
1898. a child was born to Mrs. Baldwin.'
"When she regained her health the
daughter visited her mother and asked
that her property be returned to her. This
Mrs. Baird refused to do, telling her
daughter, so the complainant stages, that
she would retain the stock forever unless
her daughter cast off and abandoned her
husband. This declaration proved a shock
to the young wife, but she would not give
up her husband. No wealth could atone
for lost affection, and no money could
lead her feet from the path of duty, so
she left her mother and spurned her oiler.
Now the suit has been filed, and the
rest of the story will be told to the world
in open court. The little fortune was a
portion of the inheritance of Mrs. Bald
win from the estate of her father, the late
John H. Baird, and, although it break her
heart she is determined that the law shall
wrest that which her dead father gave
her from her unforgiving mother's hands.
Trotting Stock Under the Hammer.
Messrs. Kllllp & Co. sold yesterday at
their salesyard at Van Ness avenue and
Market street some thirty head of trot
ting bred mares and geldings belonging
dorf accomplished the feat he would walk
home from Livermore.
The terms were accepted, and at 9
o'clock Monday morning the couple left
the springs. Mr. Clay soon found that he
was not taking a moonlight stroll. Miss
Wellendorf started out to win, and win
she did, for at half-past 12 the pair en
tered the Livermore Hotel. Dinner was
served and an hour spent in the shade of
the veranda. Then came the start for
Oakland. Mr. Clay would not show the
white feather, and out in the scorching
sun he started. She watched him until the
bend of the road took him out of sight.
She took the stage and returned well sat
isfied with her trip.
But not so with Mr. Clay. He soon
found it uncomfortable, and long before
Pleasanton was reached he wished for a
rest. A wagon came by and he sought a
lift to Pleasanton. There he took the
train for home.
When seen to-day he said, "Oh, I had a
delightful time. Yes, we walked Into
Livermore together. Who said I walked
home? Yes, I think I did make some such
rash agreement, but I know Miss Wel
lendorf never thought I would do it. Well,
I did walk home after I reached Oakland.
Now don't say anything about this will
you?" _______________

M'CAUSLAND MUST
EXPLAIN HIS ACTIONS
Athletic Association Officials Demand
a Reason for His Not Rowing
at El Campo.
The fiasco at El Campo rowing regatta
last Sunday week, when the principal
match of the day, that between William
McCausland and Alexander Pape, fell
through, was discussed by the regatta
committee last night-
After an extended hearing It was de
termined to refer the matter to the board
of governors. Pacific Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union, for action. It is
the consensus of opinion that McCaus
land, who refused to row, will be sus
pended from competition for an extended
period.
The time for the closing of entries to
the regatta of next Sunday was extended
until to-morrow night. The competition
is restricted to barge races and some live
ly contests are expected. The Alameda
Club is said to have an invincible senior
crew. The members are anxious to pit
themselves against the redoubtable South
End "Midgets." The latter crew is not
in training, so the men from across the
bay expect to score a victory over what
ever crew they meet.
There will be five crews in the Junior
race, representing the Alameda, South
End, Dolphin, Ariel and Pioneer clubs.
The Dolphins and Pioneers will fight it
out in the Junior race and the Alamedas
and South Ends in the senior competition.
Those present at the meeting were: A.
P. Rothkopf, rowing commissioner; S. J.
Pembroke, secretary; J. R. Bockman, J.
D. Mahoney, William Espy and Emmet
Hayden. __________
IMPORTANT CONCESSION
ON THE WAR TARIFF
COLLECTOB LYNCH MAKES A
RULING.
He Makes Glad the Hearts of Dealers
in Mining Stock and Has Lifted
an Incubus Off the
Market.
The following correspondence will be of
Interest to mining brokers and others, as
it has resulted in an important conces
sion to them by Internal Revenue Collec
tor Lynch:
John C. Lynch, Esq., Collector United States
Internal Revenue, San Francisco, Col. â Dear
Sir: It is proposed to re-organize the capi
tal stock of certain corporations formed for
the purpose of mining now having a capital
stock divided into BhareÃ of the par value of
$100 each, so that as reorganized the par value
will be $3 or $5 per share. Necessary steps,
Buch aa resolutions to the proper effect, etc.,
have been or will be immediately adopted by
the boards of directors of the several com
panies involved, and the reorganizations com
pleted upon expiration of the period required
by law for the publishing notice. Pending such
period it is desired to trade in the reorganized
stocks of such mining companies by memoran
hum of sale, providing for delivery upon issue
of such new stock. May this be done by pay
ing revenue tax upon par value of stock for
which note or memorandum sale is issued?
Tours respectfully, J. T. BURKE,
Special Attorney for Comstock Mining Com
pany.
J. T. Burke. 327 Pine street, Cityâ Sir: Re
plying to your letter of even date, I beg- leave
to reply, that I have carefully considered the
questions propounded, and In the absence of
instructions from the honorable Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, I will rule aa follows:
"That when a corporation with a capital
stock has passed a resolution to change the
par value of the shares of its capital stock, an
agreement to ppII the said stock to be delivered
at a date subsequent to the date of reorganiza
tion will be subject to a tax of two cents (2c)
on $100 of the par value of the utock issued
under the reorganization. In other words, any
contract for future delivery of stock will
have to pay a tax at the rate of two cents
on $'.10. par value of the stock, at the date of
delivery.
This opinion is concurred in Revenue Agent
ThomaÂ». Respectfully.
JOHN C. LYNCH. Collector.

KNOTTY QUESTIONS SOLVED.
Judge Sheldon Outlines the Proper
Work of the Red Cross
Society.
OAKLAND, July 19.â Judge Sheldon,
one of the five members of the executive
board of the National Red Cross Society,
of Washington, D. C, addressed the Red
Cross Society this morning.
The speaker solved a number of knotty
problems for the ladies. "A hospital ship
should go at once to the Philippines," he
said, "and it should be furnished, not by
the patriotic West, but by the United
States Government. As regards other
work, I believe that your societies here
and in San Francisco should have fed,
as you did, the incoming soldiers, though
they had not as yet been mustered into
service. You were morally certain that
they would be. As to medicines, the Gov
ernment should furnish them. If you
have spent money for medicines you
should ask the Government to return it
to you, for you can send it elsewhere."
He also defined Red Cross work very
plainly. "It is giving aid to the sick and
wouMtd. It is preventing sickness. So,
under these things, your procuring food
and medicines for the soldiers is right in
line and correct."
Honored the Dead Officer.
OAKLAND, July 19.â When the case of
Margaret Schwall, which was set for trial
this morning in Judge Cliffs court, was
called. Deputy District Attorney A. A,
Moore Jr. moved that the court adjourn,
out of respect to the memory of Gus
Koch, who had been a constable of this
court. The case was continued for one
week, with the consent of the defendant's
attorney. In granting- the continuance
Judge Clift expressed his satisfaction at
the action of the attorneys, saying that
he was entirely unnerved and would be
quite unable to proceed with the case. He
paid a high tribute to the dea.d officer, in,
a voice choked oy tears, and his grief was
shared by the attorneys and others in
Case of Mistaken Identity.
OAKLAND, July 19.â When the case of
Gus Lindeman, the Temescal capitalist,
was called in the Police Court this morn
ing it was passed until the 25th for exam
ination. He is charged with burglary,
when, in fact, he entered the house upon
hearing cries of "Help! Help! Murder:"
and the like and saw the children run
ning around In their nlghtclothes. His
friends believe it a case of mistaken
identity.
Charley White Was a Witness.
OAKLAND, July 19.â The preliminary
hearing of Alonzo Schaefer, charged
with assault to murder J. J. Hurt, was
postponed in the Police Court to-day, ow
ing to the absence of the principal wit
ness, Charles White, the Deputy Sheriff
killed this morning. It Is barely possible
that the case will fail owing to Mr.
White's death.

SPANISH SOLDIERS
STARVING AT HAVANA
Pinched Faces Stamped With Hunger
Seen at the Cub .in
Capital.
Special correspondence of The Call ami the
New York HeraM. Copyrighted. IS9S, by
James Gordon Bennett.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 9.âStar
vation and death are working dire ha
voc with Blanco's soldiers in Havana.
Refugees from Havana arriving to-day
by the British cruiser Talbot reiterate
and confirm the tale of suffering. Food
for the poorer people is scarcely ob
tainable, deaths from starvation occur
ring daily, while the Spanish soldiers
stalk famished through the streets, go
ing from house to house of the wealth
ier classes to beg for food.
In an interview with Albert Hender
son, an Englishman and late clerk at
the English consulate in Havana, he
said: "The condition of the lower
classes is simply fearful. Starving,
pinched faces, stamped with hunger
and despair, are seen on every side.
Human skeletons with their clothes
hanging loosely around them prowl
about the markets and wharves, gath
ering odds and ends from the rubbish
heaps to serve as food. The soldiers
themselves are in little better plight.
The majority are in rags, without
boots, unpaid and hungry. I have seen
many come to the English consulate,
begging a peseta in order to buy food.
They are on half rations and expect
to soon be put on quarter rations. A
good deal of fever and dysentery exist
at present, and living as they are, on
bad and insufficient food, much sick
nesfl must soon prevail. They are ut
terly disheartened and any light they
make will not be from courage, but de
spair.
"I saw the bodies of several unfor
tunate men in their ragged regimentals
dragged out by ropes to an adjacent
common and left there without burial
for the buzzards to feed on. That is
the manner in which Spain looks after
her dead soldiers. I know it has been
denied that actual starvation exists in
Havana, and the British Consul Gen
eral has stated such reports to be ex
aggerated. Before I left Havana I s- 'v
an official return in the office of the
British consulate, showing the average
death rate of seven per day from actual
starvation."
CAPTAIN JOHN RUURDS
DYING AT MONTEREY
Helped to Raise the Stars and Stripes
Over the Old Custom House
in Early Days.
MONTEREY. July 19.â One of the oldest
pioneers of Monterey County, if not of the
State, lies at the point of death in the
building over which he helped to raise
Old Glory nearly three generations ago.
For several days past Captain John
Ruurds has be.-n seriously 111. and this
aftprnoon an hope of recovery was re
linquished. The oW man is in bis eighty
first year, and has been a notary public
and conveyancer for many years back.
He is a native of Belgium and was one
of the American army of invasion during
the Mexican War, comiiiK to California
In 1845. When the- flag was hoisted over
the old custom house here he was pres
ent, and he was tht-n, and has since been,
permitted to occupy quarters in thf build
ing, where, surrounded by feline friends,
his days have passed happily.
Captain Ruurds was quite a linguist,
speaking French. German, Spanish,
Italian. English and oth.T languages. He
was, unill prostrated by his present ill
ness, sprightly and vigorous for one of
his extreme age. and could often be seen
on tho streets of the old capital.
Although a native of Belgium, the cap
tnin loner since became a citizen of the
i I'nlted States, having taken out his full
papers in July. 1858, in the Third Judicial
District Court of Monterey County.
BOTH COMPANIES AND
AGENTS RESPONSIBLE
Penalties for Bringing Into This
Country Aliens Afflicted With
Loathsome Diseases.
WASHINGTON, July 19.â S.>me days
ago the Treasury- Deportment f-Ã¼bmitted
to the Attorney General a copy of section
6 of the immigration act of ISOI for an
opinion as to whether the repeated en
deavor on the part of the transportation
companies to bring Into the United States
aliens afflicted with a disease pronounced
to be "loathsome or dangerously contagi
ous" was within the meaning of paid sec
tion, so as to make suoh companies liable
to the penalties prescribed thereby, whlcsi
is a fine not to exceed $1000 or imprison
ment not exceeding one year or both. Iti
an extended opinion Attorney General
Grlg-ps concludes as follows:
"That corporation officers or servants
responsible for or p.rtually engaged in
breach of the immigration laws under thÂ«
act of l*!U are liable to the fine and Im
prisonment impoHr-d by section 6, and the
corporation in itself is liable to a fine In
the case of any and each alien brougr-t
into or landed in the United States by
vessel or otherwise who is not entitled tÂ»<
enter, is embraced within the meaning of
section 6 of the act of March ?,, 1891, so as
to make companies liable in the way hero
indicated to the penalties prescribed
thereby."

Mexico, on the opposite bank of the river,
is now partially inundated and the stream
continues to rise.

MAD RUSH OF
THE STARVING
Supply Ship Unloads at
Santiago.
PEOPLE FIGHT LIKE DEMONS
TROOPS STOP THE RAVENOUS
ONSLAUGHT.
Entire Cargo Is Finally Distributed.
Water Supply of the City About
to Be Turned On
Again.
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 18, via
Kingston, Jamaica, Tuesday, July 19. â
The Red Cross Society's steamer State
of Texas arrived yesterday at 6 o'clock
In the afternoon and this morning at
daybreak Dr.Elwell, who was in charge
of the work of unloading, secured eight
stores in the heart of the city and one
large shed on the dock, engaged eighty
stevedores and began to unload the
steamer about 6 o'clock. She had 1400
tons of provisions on board.
The distribution began at 3 o'clock,
allowing a pound and a half of rations
to each citizen. When the unloading
began crowds of half-starved citizens
rushed to the dock, fighting, trampling
one another under foot, breaking open
the cases and stealing the supplies.
Finally a picket c-f troops was placed
on the wharf, refusing admittance to
any one. The entire cargo had been
landed before the distribution began.
Each applicant was furnished with a
ration ticket, supplied by the local com
missioners, with General McKibben's
indorsement.
The water supply of the city which
was cut off on July 3 above El Caney
by General Garcia's troops, leaving the
town without water, will be turned on
again to-night. The ice factory re
sumed work to-day, using the rain
water supply in the cisterns.
All the liquor stores, wholesale and
retail, are closed under General Shat
ter's orders, but the Spanish soldiers
have a large stock of rum on hand,
which they are exchanging for our
hardtack and corned beef.
Last night the city was very quiet,
and there were no disturbances, the
distribution of the supplies from the
State of Texas being anxiously awaited,
as there was literally nothing in the
city to eat.
Before the refugees left for El Caney
flour was selling at $150 per barrel,
beans at $90 per hundred pounds, con
densed milk at $5 a tin and hardtack
at $1 apiece.
At El Caney the prices were still
higher â $25 for a tin of condensed milk
and $5 for a piece of hardtack. The
ruin and want in the city are almost
inconceivable.
Twenty-five Cubans, political prison
ers, are still in the local jail, but a re
port has been submitted on the subject
by Cuban residents to General McKib
ben, the temporary Military governor,
and their release is expected.
Admiral Sampson, accompanied by
Commodore Schley and the marine
staff, landed at 9 o'clock this morning
from the Vixen and met the municipal
officers of Santiaeo.

LINES DRAWING
CLOSELY ABOUT
JOE LOCHNER
No Positive Clew as Yet to the
Fiend Who Strangled Mrs.
Carpenter,
Her Husband Threatened to Kill Herâ He Is
Still Missingâ Alibis for Carsten
and Soso.
Incompetent Isaiah, Chief of Police of
Ban Francisco, yesterday took charge of
the Carpenter murder mystery. It is
needless to report that the Police Depart
mi :it achieved no great results in con-
Bequence of Lee's personal direction of
their work.
Through the efforts of the newspaper j
men of the city the chase for the strang
ler Is now concentrated on Henry Car
penter, husband of the victim. Not a
clew has been found, however, which
might lead to the discovery of his where
abouts, or whether he has been in the ]
city lately. All that Is known about him j
Is that he was here six weeks ago and J
Baw his wife. He then dropped com- j
pletely out of eight.
Mrs. Anderson, mother of the dead
woman, believes thai Carpenter had j
Fomething to do with the violent death i
of her daughter. One point Is certainâ j
he has not made his appearance at police |
headquarters, as Chief Lees and his mm- j
lons confidently expected nim to do. If
Carpenter is innocent and has read of the j
crime it is very strange that he has not
communicated with the police.
In the meantime, while an abortive
. is being made by the healthy ,
Hawkshaws ot the upper office of the I
Police Department, the lines seem to be |
drawing somewhat closely about Joe
Lochner, who has been under detention
at the City Prison since the morning of
the tragedy.
On the theory of "opportuni<y of cir
cumstances," he appears to be the only
person who could have committed the
dastardly crime, unless, perhaps, "Span
ish" Lizzie Riiey did. The police scout the
1' the laitor being In any way con
nected with the case, any further than
that she heard Mrs. Carpenter's dying
struggles, and then gave the alarm.
From statements made by two or three
persons who were quite intimately ac
quainjed with Lochner and Mrs. Carpen
ter. If would seem that ho is afflicted with
a form of psychopathy, that dread disease
with whi( h Durrant and other infamous
â¢ afflicted.
â¢ w in circulation In the
circles In which Lochner and Mrs. Car
pentor were known that their relations
were more man friendly, and that they
frequently indulged in bitter quarrels. It
positively known that he had free
access to her room through the door con
l: his room with hers, and that the
nto h'-r chamber at all hours of the
day or night. He knew enough of her
affairs to give the names of half a dozen
men who were visitors to her room. He
bJs â  familiar with all her domestic
affairsâ knew where she kept her money,
v.ho her correspondents were and what
they were doing. All this, he says, is
merely Incidental to their warm friend
s-hip.
Lochner Is fuming and fretting In the
cell at the Central station, and is impor
tuning Chief Lees and Captain Seymour
Mm at liberty.
For pome re;u=on Chief Lees and his In
competent sleuths failed to take advan
tage of a remark dropped by Lochner on
the night of the murder, which perhaps
might have some bearing on the case.
When the prisoner was questioned by
the police he nervously remarked that
Mrs. Carpenter had threatened to go to
Monterey and would not see him again.
"I advised her not to go," he tremu
lously declared in the presence of the po
lice, "as I feared she would not return."
Following their usual blundering meth
or.Â«. th<Â» Bleuths of the upper office failed
to question him as to the reason for de
siring the woman to remain In this city.
To a reportc-r last night Lochner per-
Blstently denied that he attempted to
ide Mrs. Carpenter from taking the
intended trip to Monterey.
"If the police say I made use of such a
remark they lie," he indignantly declared.
"As they 'have failed to catch the real j
murderer they are now vainly attempting i
to fasten the crime on me."
Notwithstanding Lochner's denial, there
are several policemen who are willing to
swear that he used the remark. They as- j
Bert that after ihey reached the scone of
the murder Lochner, who was laboring !
under great mental excitement, passion- â¢
ately kissed the colorless lips of the dead j
woman, and, turning to the officers, spoke
of her threatened trip to Monterey, and !
his attempt to dissuade her from going.
Lochner has told the police that he is
Inclined to believe that the husband of j
the murdered woman is the guilty party.
"About six weeks ago," he said last ;
night. "Sadie told me that Carpenter hac I
visited her and given her some money. I
He wanted her to go with him, but she
refused. Three weeks later he again vis
ited her. but I did not see him. My opin
ion is that he remained in the city await
ing a favorable opportunity to do her up."
As Lochner has all along declared thai
he had never seen Carpenter his state
ment last night seems strange, to say the
least.
When asked when Mrs. Carpenter spoke
of her intended trip to Monterey, Lochner
Bald that it was a few weeks ago.
"She wanted me to go with her," he re
marked, "but as I was without money I
told her she would have to make the trip
alone.
"Why should I murder the woman when !
she has always been my friend? God only
knows that I would be delighted to see
the strangler brought to justice. Captain
Seymour is satisfied that I am Innocent
of 'the horrible crimo, as he Informed me
to-day that T would be released to-mor
row. The police know I didn't strangle
Sadie, but somebody had to be arrested
and I was unfortunate enough to be the
unlucky one.
"This afternoon I saw Mrs. Anderson,
mother of poor Sadie, in Chief Lees' of
fice, and she warmly shook my hand. If
she had the l^ast suspicion that T was her
daughter's murderer do you think she
would greet me in a friendly manner? I
have always been a friend of the family,
and Mrs. Anderson knows it.
"When I get out I will do all In my
power to assist the police in running
down the strangler."
Captain Seymou;- does not Intend to re
lease Lochner to-day as the latter
claimed. He Intends to keep him in Jail
until the mystery Is cleared up and fhe
identity of the murderer revealed.
It was established beyond a doubt yes
terday that Fred Carsten.the soldier out
at Fort Point, and William Soso, who is
referred to in one of the dead woman's
letters to Sergeant Gilligan at Camp
Chickamauga, had nothing to do with the
murder. Carsten's tentmates were
brought in from camp and interviewed
by Captain Seymour. They satisfied
the Captain of Detectives that Carsten
slept in his tent and was not down town
at ftny time between dark and daylight.
A message received from Centerville
stated that Soso was at that place Sat
urday night and all day Sunday. Soso
wÂ»nt there about two weeks ago.
Mrs. Anderson and her adopted daugh
ter, Lulu Moss, spent a couple of hours
at the Chief's office discussing the affairs
of the deceased. They were not able to
shed a particle of light on the mystery.
While they were consulting with Chief
Leea and Captain Seymour Fred Carsten
came in with Officer Dillon. He was
greeted warmly by the bereaved mother.
Soon after Joe Lochner was brought up
from the tanks. Mrs. Anderson shook
hands with him and tearfully assured
him that she was convinced he was in no
manner connected with the murder of
her daughter. â¢
Lochner and Carsten. who have been
close friends for a long time, shook hands
heartily and each assured the other of
his belief that he was innocent of any
wrong-doing.
While the party was in the office Chief
Lees took another statement from Cars
ten and Lochner. They had nothing new
to say, except to give the names of a
couple of men whom they know visited
MrÃ. Carpenter in her room at the Hub-,
bard House. These men were afterward
seen by newspaper men, but they knew
nothing of the tragedy except what had
appeared in the newspapers.
t'oroner Hawkins returned from Lake
Tahoe yesterday. He said the inquest in
the Carpenter case would be delayed for
several days until the police had an op
portunity to gather further facts.
An undertaker took charge of Mrs. Car
penter's remains yesterday and prepared
them for shipment to Monterey. Mrs.
Anderson, the children and Miss Moss
will accompany the body to Monterey to
day. The funeral will be held as soon as
they arrive home.
That Mrs. Carpenter apprehended a
violent death at the hands of her hus
band as long ago as last December was
discovered yesterday. In the bottom of
her trunk, which was taken to police
headquarters, was a little square, sealed
envelope, addressed to her two children.
When Mrs. Anderson was present Cap
tain Seymour broke the seal. In her fear
of a sudden and violent death the moth
er wrote the letter and In it she made
what is in effect her will. She says she
wants all her money to go to her two
children. The letter is as follows:
315 Tenth street. Oakland, Cal., Dec 8,
1597, 3 p. m., Friday.
"Of all sad words of tongue or pen the
saddest are these It might have been."

and that he hardly knew which one to |

she would not sue him. This he is afraid \
of. He said he would not have felt very i

he had no one else. Also that he wanted j
a woman with no money, but before he

He said he wished he had waited until
spring. Afterward he said if he had
waited he would have married the other
woman. Now as God is my witness I be
lieve he repents his choice since I refuse
him the money. I believe it was for my
money he chose me. He said when she

and I told him I had prayed for him and
for me, but he only seemed t6 think of
the woman he wronged. She wrote him
a long letter telling him how he wronged
her, and he says that has affected him
until he is unlit for work. He went away
out' on Broadâ looking for rooms, I think,
to keep away from the shop and her. She
is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist. He
became angry about the money and said
he won't take care of me and my chil
dren: said he won't give me a cent when
he gets his money in the spring'; said I
am picking at him. I offered to go to
work at my trade to help make a living,
but he said no. I found in papers to-day
he has only rented machine $75, paid
110 in July and $3 per month and rent and
house rent due. He told me at last he
borrowed money and wants to repay it.
I said I won't pay your debts before I
married you. He jumped up and left
the room without a good-by. He has
spent $60 for me and no more. Has said
I am in the habit of leaving people, but
don't leave me. I think the money
trouble will grow worse. A man (Case)
was here to dinner yesterday. â¢*â¢'! think it
is him Henry owes money to. Mi. Brown
says Case is a sharper, and I think so too.
Henry says he was going to the city to
try to get work to get away from that
woman. He went to pec a rpal estate

of talking suicide, I long for my dear
children, norae ajid mother. Oh, how can
I bear this torture and suspense and

Oakland.
Address on envelope: Pearl and Maedell
Simpson, Monterey, Cal.
James Shillock of 3 Taylor street yes
terday made a statement to the police
in which he said he had known Sadie
Simpson prior to her marriage to Car
penter: that she called on him frequent
ly after her marriage and told him that
Carpenter wanted to get money from her
and that because she would not gtve it
to him he left her. She also told him that
she met her husband several times on the
street and asked him for money, but
never got any. The last time she met
him (which time is not definitely known)
he asked her for money with "which to
start in business. Mrs. Carpenter also
told Shillock that Carpenter was en
gaged to marry a girl in Oakland before
he married her.
William Soso, who has been mentioned
in connection with the death of Mrs. Car
penter, particularly In letters from Ser
geant Gilligan at Camp Chickamauga, is
at Centerville, Alameda County. Last
evening a Call correspondent saw him,
and he talked frankly and freely of the
case. He said he had known Sadie Car
penter since last January, and had been
very friendly with her. He was not sur
prised that his name became connected
with the case, but declared emphatically
that he had never been jealous of the
woman. She asked him to enlist in the
army and he complied with her request
by going to the recruiting officer and
passing the medical examination. Then
she begged him not to take the oath, and
dissuaded him from going to war. The last
time he saw her was July 3. Last Satur
day and Sunday Soso was in Centerville,
and could not have been in any way in
volved in the murder.
Chief Lees received a dispatch from
Sergeant Gilligan yesterday, In reply to
a message asking him about his refer
ences to Soso, in which he said he would
send all the information he had by mail.
Lochner was brought down yesterday
afternoon by an officer in citizen's
clothes. He wanted to see the remains
of Carpenter before they were taken
to Monterey for interment.
Business Is Brisker.
The annual report of the Surveyor of
the Port shows a marked increase both in
imports and exports during the past fiscal
year. In the year ending June, 1897, there
were 813,602 tons of dutiable goods im
ported, while In 1898 there were 977,868. Trie
increase in exports is still larger, as in
1857 there were but 11,824 tons of dutiable
goods against 54,964 in 1898.

DISASTROUS
START ON A
LONG VOYAGE
The Moran Fleet That Left Seat
tle Last Month Is in Hard
Luck.
Steam Pipes Burst, Hog Chains Snapped,
Steamers Wrecked and Two Captains
Refuse to Go On.
Disaster after disaster seems to follow the Moran fleet of steamers
that left Seattle for St. Michael on June 2. Steam pipes burst, hog
chains snapped, one captain discharged for cause, two other captains got
"cold feet" and refused to continue the journey, one steamer a total
wreck, another damaged almost past repair and two barges laden with
coal lost, was the record up to June 28, when the vessels were in Katmai
Bay.
The Moran Bros.' fleet of steamers
that left Seattle for St. Michael on June
2 last and which waÃ given up as lost
has been heard from. A fortnight ago
the majority of them were in Katmai
Bay on the mainland of Alaska, bat
tered and strained, but "still in the
ring." The sternwheel steamer Western
Star and two barges laden with coal
were a total loss, the Pilgrim was badly
strained and damaged and had to be
patched up before she could proceed,
and the others lost their anchors and
chains and had to be beached to save
them from total destruction.
When the fleet left Seattle it. was
composed as follows: Sternwheel
steamersâ J. H. Light, Pilgrim, D. R.
Campbell, F. K. Gustin. St. Michael,
Seattle, Victoria, Oil City, Robert Kerr,
Western Star, Tacoma and Mary E.
Graff, tugs Resolute and Richard Hol
yoke and steam schooner South Coast.
The flagship was the Pilgrim, on
which was Robert Moran and Captain
J. E. Lennon. The latter was chief
pilot and directed the course of the
fleet. The other vessels were to veport
to her by means of flags and signal
whistles. The Resolute had no tow
and acted as a messenger between the
Pilgrim and the remainder of the fleet.
The Holyoke had five big river barges
in tow on which were 150 tons of coal
each. The South Coast was also loaded
with coal.
The news of the fleet was brought
down by the schooner Kodlak from Ko
diak Island. The river boats and their
consorts met) disaster in the Shelakoff
Straits, and the news of the disaster
was brought to Kodiak by the steamer
South Coast. Katmai Bay is an open
roadstead on the mainland opposite Ko
diak Island. Among the passengers who
came down on the schooner was Cap
tain Norman Hodgson of the wrecked
steamer Western Star. He was very re
ticent about the matter, but between
him, Captain Thomas and Mate Malan
der of the Kodiak the following inter
esting facts were elicited:
When the fleet left Seattle it was the
intention to take the inside passage
to False Pass, through which the ves
sels were to steam into Bering Sea.
After leaving Port Muller the first stop
In Bering Sea, the fleet would make for
Cape Amacaya, then to Nuniwak Isl
and, to Hoopers Bay, to St. Michael.
The fleet had a fair weather passage
to Shelakoff Straits and the captains
were figuring on a safe and speedy pas
sage. On June 28 it began to blow, and
the vessels ran into Katmai Bay and
anchored. At 4 p. m. the entire fleet
broke away from the anchorage and
began to drift about. All had steam up
and a vain attempt was made to keep
head on to the wind, which at 7 p. m.
had increased to a strong gale from the
northeast.
About this time the river steamers
began to go ashore. The Robert Kerr
and Western Star drifted across the
bay. The Kerr was light and she luck
ily went over a reef and into smooth
water. The Western Star's machinery
broke down and Captain Hodgson sig
naled for assistance, but the Resolute
and Holyoke were busy with the St.
Michael and Tacoma, while the South
Coast was saving the Mary E. Graff
from going on the rocks. The barges
left to themselves dirfted on the beach.
Those that were coal laden went to
pieces, while the lumber laden were got
off little the worse for the accident.
The Western Star went over one
ledge of rocks, and while she was in
comparatively smooth water an at
tempt was made to repair her machin
ery. While this was being done a big
sea carried her onto another reef and
she went to pieces.
In the meantime all the other vessels
were being buffeted about in a terrible
manner, and in order to save them
from total destruction they had to be
beached under a bluff on the north
side of the bay. Later, when the gale
had somewhat abated, the St. Michael
F. K. Gustin, D. R. Campbell, Mary E.
Graff, Victoria, Pilgrim and Seattle
were grot into the Katmai River, while
the J. H. Light, Tacoma, Victoria and
Oil City were able to proceed to a safe
anchorage in Coal Bay.
When the disabled steamers were
safely In Katmai River the South
Coast proceeded to Kodiak. There she
secured all the anchors and chains that
were to spare in the place â extra sup
plies, as the stocks on board were run
ning low â and lumber to repair the
battered steamers. On July 2 the re
pairs had been made, preventers had
been put on the strained hog chains
and tightened up, the machinery over
hauled and everything was ready for
another start when the Kodiak sailed.
The following extracts are from a
diary kept by C. E. Cahill, chief stew
ard of the Empire Line steamer Seat
tle (one of the Moran fleet), and sent
via Kodiak to The Call. After de
scribing the wooding and coaling of the
fleet at Everett and Comax, Mr. Cahill
goes on to say: "We left Point Ru
pert at 4a. m., June 7. Crossing Queen
Charlotte Sound there was a heavy
ground swell and the steamers worked
considerably in consequence. The Ta
coma broke her steam pipe and we had
to tow her into Alexander Bay, where
repairs were made. Left Alexander
Bay on June 9, and next day passed a
stranded stern-wheel steamer. She was
well up on the beach and abandoned.
She did not belong to pur fleet, but was
evidently bound for the Yukon. We
could not make out hor name. June 11
arrived at Mary Island, where Captain
P. Neilson of the Pilgrim was paid off
and put ashore.
"June 16 â Took on water from a
mountain stream at Port Orford. All
the fleet getting ready, as the real work
is now about to begin. We are going
outside to face the music. From my
experience at sea I don't think we'll
make St. Michael unless wo have re
markably fine weather.
"June 19 â The Seattle broke her hog
chain and we had to put into Yakatat
for repairs. Captain Gilmore of the
Victoria and Captain E. E. Stanford of
the Mary E. Graff quit and went
ashore. The mates, whose names I
could not ascertain, took their places.
I asked our fleet officer why Captains
Gilmore and Stanford left, and he said,
'I guess they've got cold feet.'
"June 28 â Passing through Shelakoff
Straits. Fresh breeze in the morning
gradually increasing to a gaje. Put
into a half-sheltered bay (Katmai)
about thirty miles this side of Coal
Harbor. At Ip. m., anchored up close
to the beach. Wind increased to a
hurricane. The F. K. Gustin dragged
her anchor and fouled the Seattle. The
two steamers drifted down on the D.
R. Campbell, the latter's bow cutting
through the Seattle's guard and smash

"WTLL BE DEPORTED.
Sity Chinese "Traders" Must Go
Back to the Rice Fields.
The fate* of sixty Chinamen who have
been held in custody for the past six
weeks was decided yesterday, and they
will be deported on the next steamer for
China.
JThe men all bore Canton certificates, de
scribing them as traders, but Collector
Jackson refused to admit them. as. to far
as his information went, the laws made
no provision for the admission of traders.
The examination showed that they had
been merchants in China, but as they
were described throughout the certificates
as traders they were refused a landing-,
and Collector Jackson asked the opinion
of the Attorney General on the matter.
He received a telegTam from Washington
yesterday to the effect that Chinese trad
ers are not entitled to admission, as they
are neither exempted by the law nor pro
vided for in the treaty.
Not a Hardship.
It Is surprising how. little hardship
the tax on tea (which it was supposed
would be the most unpopular one)
seems to be causing â i. c., at any rate
on this coast.
People don't seem to mind paying 10
cents a pound more on tea. It seems to
be regarded as a sort of contribution
which it is the pleasure of every Amer
ican citizen to make toward the sup
port of our fighting soldiers.
When the soldiers are marching down
to the transports it is a very hard
headed and harder hearted man who
can remain seated at his desk. The
American people respond very readily
to the call for troops, Government loan
and to war tax, so it seems that there
is very little suffering among tea
drinkers in this respect. Those who will
suffer from the war duty upon tea are
those grocers who have to sell the new
teas (with 10 cents a pound duty) in
competition with other grocers who
have on hand a stock of old stale tea,
which they can well afford to sell at
the old price.

though it calls for an -extremely lengthy
and expensive cast. All the principals
of the popular organization will appear,
and in addition roles will be intrust
ed to people specially engaged for them.
Not the least important engagement is
that of the well-known actor, Harry
Malnhall for the role of Captain Bradley
Adams, U. S. A., and It will be equally
pleasant to note that Thomas C. Leary
will appear as Corporal McCar.n. The
stage of the Columbia Theater savors of
the appearance of a miniature Union Iron
Works, for here and there are scattered
incomplete war vessels to be utilized,
when finished, for the attack upon Rich
mond, which is followed by the capitu
lation of the Confederates. The last
scene of the play shows the surrender of
General Lee to General Grant.
