Coast and Captures Her.
KEY WEST, Fla., April 23.-An incoming
tug reports that the New York has captured
a Spanish passenger steamer plying between
Havana and Porto Rico. The torpedo flotilla
is coming in. It is believed here that the prize
captured by the flagship New York is the
Alfonso XII, the mail steamer due at Havana
to-day (not the warship of that name). The
Spanish ship tried to run away, but the New
York gave chase, firing shot after shot until
the Spaniards hove to and surrendered.
On Board the Herald-Call Dispatch Boat (via Key West), April 22.â
The morning sun shone on the first capture of war. Its declining rays lit
another, the second made by this fleet to-day. The chase and capture took
place late this afternoon and almost within gunshot of the shores of Cuba,
The prize is a Spanish merchant steamship of apparently about 2000 tons.
As time was pressing I could not wait to ascertain the vessel's name. The
chase as seen from the decks of the Herald-Call dispatch boat was one of
the most Inspiring spectacles of the day of events.
The fleet was standing toward Havana, the Mayflower acting as a scout
a mile or so in advance of the flagship New York. The Mayflower sud
denly swung sharply to the westward and a moment later a string of but
terfly flags went fluttering to hpr masthead. While all were wondering
what the maneuver meant the New York was seen to fline her answering
pennant to the breeze, and making another signal to the fleet, which -Â»rob
ahh- meant "Stay where you are until I get back," -nun" her bow to the
westward ami went racing for the game that the Mayflower had sighted.
I got a maTilflrnnt view of the splendid cruiser as she rushed pa-t our boat
with smoke trailing in dense masses from each of her three big funnels, a
hill of f'>;>m around her bow and her wake was like a tidal wave.
She set a clipping pace from the start, and a magnificent sight she
presented as she dash'd through the choppy seas, with never an undula-
Hon of her long graceful hull. The loom of land lay on her starboard bow
and boom, and although I climbed on top of the pilot house of the Smith
and swept the horizon ahead I could distinguish nothing excppt the white
crests of running seas. All were puzzled to know what the New York was
about. Some said ahe was steaming in Havana alone to give formal notice
of the impending bombardment, so as to give non-combatants warning to
leave. Some one else was about to advance another theory when there came
a puff of smoke from the bow of the cruiser and a dull report came boom-
Ing over the water.
Thf matter was clear enough then. The vigilant scout had espied a sail
inshore ami the fleet cruiser whs In hot pursuit. We of the dispatch boat
supposed it to b<j a Spanish torpedo boat, and as there came another flash
and report nnd another and another the men of the Smith became certain
that the fugitive was none other than a "hornet," obstinately trying to
escape.
"Soak it to him, New York," yelled one enthusiast, as there came an
other jet of flame from the cruiser's bow.
The pursuer up to this time had been using one of her small rapn -fire
guns, and the Spanish ship, evidently believing that she carried nothing
larger, was apparently trying to make her escape by running until night
fall hid her movements. The rapid- fire gun ceased its chatter, there was a
moment of silence and the entire bow of the cruiser was hid In a swirl of
white smoke as a main battery gun uttered its peremptory monosyllable.
The message erf the whizzing shell told plainly that there was to be no
more fooling and the fugitive was not slow in reading it.
The missile had hardly flung up its column of spray before the Spaniard
was seen to round to and change her engines. The New York ranged near
hnd was lowering a boat to take possession of the prize when the Smith hav
ing then no time to spare in reaching the Key West wire swung around and
headed back to port. As I passed '" fleet at sunset . l noticed that the ships
had taken blockade form. lion. The battleships and the Amphitrite were in
the outward or seaward column, the cruisers and gunboats strung out in an
other line between the armor-elaJs and the land, with the torpedo boats and
the torpedo boat destroyer Mayflower hovering between ;he inner line and
the shore.

THE FLEET IS
SIGHTED FROM
HAVANA HILLS
Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Aprn 22. â From the hills of Gm.najay I saw the United
States warships this afternoon. They are advancing on Havana from
the westward. The news has reached Morro Castle. There all is alert,
but fear i" in the hearts of the city's defenders. Havana's weak point lies
dead ahead of the American fleet. The courss of the ships is in direct
accordance with the plan of war which the Herald-Call first published.
It means â and everybody here admits it â the bombardmen. of Havana
unless the city surrenders in sight of the superior force.
General Blanco, in full uniform, which he has worn about two days
in the last two months, is at Santa Clara battery, the strongest of the
city's defenses. With him are all the officers of his staff and the chief
officers ot all the regular and volunteer regiments. Orderlies are rush
ing through the city, shouting the call to arms and carrying orders to the
batteries and reports to the Captain General.
The situation is ominous. Everybody grants that fact, and every
body is rushing out of the city or to its fortifications. The number who
have sought the latter places to Sght is enormous.
The United States ships could not possibly select a better place for
landing men than they can find in the neighborhood to which they are
pointing. Blanco realizes the danger, and his rushed large bodies of
troops to Santa Clara battery. He has sent others in a hurry by railroad
to Vedado and Carmelo. The garrisons are weak there and even with
reinforcements could not last long, because the defenses .re not strong.
TroopÃ could be landed there with little more than a skirmish, and
it Is thought this will be the first place at which Americans will strike.
Then, too, Blanco is fearful lest the first of the invaders come up
the little river Almendarez, where they coula make an undisputed land
ing a few miles to tLe westwarc of the city. The armament thera is in
significant. The chief defense is the old Castle de Alares. Several regi
ments have been sent to Playa de Mariano, where there is an important
but undefended landing place. From that point a railroad runs to Ha
vana.
Arolas, military governor, is acting with Blanco, and both went out
and made a reconnoissance in the direction of Mariano. The two, after
leaving Santa Clara, went to the Reina battery. All the guns at the
fortifications are manned. The men have orders to stand by them all
night. An attack is expected at daybreak.

THE BLOCKADE
OF CUBA'S COAST
NOW IN FORCE
WASHINGTON, April 22. â The following proclamation, announcing
the blockade of the Cuban ports, was issued to-day ;
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESâ A PROCLAMATION.
WHEREAS, By a joint resolution passed by the Congress and ap
proved April 20, 1898, and communicated to the Government of Spain,
it was demanded that said Government at once relinquish its authority
j and gove-rnment in the island of Cuba and withdraw its naval forces
from Cuba and Cuban waters, and the President of the United States
was directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of
the United States and to call into the actual service of the United States
the militia of the several States to such extent as might be necessary
to carry said resolution into effect; and
Whereas, In carrying into effect such resolution the President of
the United States deems it necessary to set on foot and maintain a
blockade of the north coast of Cuba, including ail ports of said coast
between Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and the port of Cienfuegos on tho
south coast of Cuba;
Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States,
in order to enforce the said resolution, do hereby dec/are and proclaim
that the United States of America has instituted and will maintain a
blockade of the north coast of Cuba, including ports on said coast be
tween Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and the port of Cienfuegos on the
south coast of Cuba, aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United
States and the laws of nations applicable to such cases. An efficient
force will be posted, so as to prevent the entrance and exit of vessels
, from the ports aforesaid. Any neutral vessel approaching said ports and
; attempting to leave the same without notice or know/edge of the estab
lishment of such blockade will be duly warned by the commander of
the blockading forces, who will indorse on her register the fact and
the date of such warning and where such indorsement was made, and
if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter any blockaded port she
will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port for such pro
: ceedings against her and her cargo as prize as may be deemed advisable.
Neutral vessels lying in any of the said ports at the time of the
establishment of such blockade will be a/lowed thirty days to issue
therefrom.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal
of the United States to be affixed.

A MUTINY ON
THE SPANISH
TORPEDO FLEET
GALVESTOX. April 22.â Captain Barnett of the British steamer
Ashoun, just arrived from the Canary Islands, reports that the reason
that the Spanish torpedo fleet has not sailed from the Cape Verde Isl
ands is that all their crews mutinied. The mutiny broke out, he said,
immediately after the torpedo fleet received orders to proceed from the.
Canaries to the American Bide of the Atlantic.
"We learned," the captain added, "that the men did not relish the
idea of -making the trip across the Atlantic. The torpedo-boats had
stood the sea voyage to Las Pal mag pretty well, but when they got or
ders to proceed, the engineers, by concerted move, disabled the machin
ery.
Thnt is the real reason why the flotilla did not proceed direct to
Cuba as ordered. Every eiYort was made to placate the officers and men.
The officials finally pot the crews of the torpedo-boats into some sort of
subjection and the damage to the machinery was repaired.
"On April 2 the flotilla left. The destination was supposed to be se
cret, but the understanding was that it would not get further than St.
Vincent, in the Cape Verde Islands. "

PEOPLE OF CUBA.
rhtc<l. IS9S. hy JamM Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, April 22. â The colonial cabinet has published a manifesto
addressed to the country as the genuine represent* ye of the people of
Cuba. It says it is necessary to make before the world the most sol
emn protest against the iniquitous attack and unjust aggression of the
United States. It calls i n the inhabitants of the island, relying on
their patriotism, self-denial and enthusiasm for the sake of nationality
and right, to defend the future of their children by answering the call
of Captain General Blanco for taking up arms and going tn tho field.
A committee of the Lonja Viveres, or Grocers' Association, headed
by the president of that institution, called on General Blanco this
morning, tendering articles necessary for the army for all defending
the country and for those wanting food the most. The committee
said the association would forbid prices being raised under penalty of
violators being dismissed from membership in th-? corporation.

It was at first proposes to delay ,
making this declaration until the first I
shot had been fired. The President,
after consultation with his Cabinet offi
cers and others of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, however, decided to- i

only for th,e purpose of putting the
United States on a prop- r status with
other nations, but in order to legalize
any and every act that he may take in
regard to the use of the naval and land
forces of the United States.
It is the present intention of the
President to send a message to Con
gress to-morrow asking for a. formal
declaration of war.
The day has been a busy and active
j one for the Chief Executive, his ad
i visers and all branches of the Govern
| ment. While all hands have been busily
engaged in perfecting all the necessary
; machinery for carrying on the war.
they have also been waiting for news
from our naval commanders engaged, in
' the hazardous work of blockading: the
: Cuban ports.
Word was received early in the day
of the capture of the Spanish ship Buena
! Ventura by the cruiser Nashville. Al
! though two shots were fired to stop this
vessel before she was captured, the au
: thorities do not consider that the act
, of the commander of the Nashville was
; necessarily an act of war. and there is
still a chance of making Spain fire the

first shot.
Other cablegrams were received by
the Xavy Department announcing that
Rear Admiral Samnson had instituted a
blockade of the northern ports of Cuba
and on the strength of this a formal
proclamation wa> issued tÂ»v the Presi
dent notifying thr powers that an ef
fectual blockade existed.
Officially, the authorities will make no
statements concerning the operations of
Admiral Sampson's fleet, but it is
known that iv addition to a blockade of
Havana and other Cuban ports, steps
have been taken to blockade San Juan,
Porto Rico, and withia the next few
days an official announcement to' this
effect will be made.
Sensational news is expected at
any time from Rear Admiral Samp
son's fleet. Actual hostilities may
be in progress at any moment, for,
although the blockade has been in
augurated for the purpose of ending
the war in Cuba, the instructions to
Admiral Sampson are of such nature
as to warrant his sinking any Span
ish ships that may interfere with the
purpose of tne blockade.
While the authorities are nervously
awaiting tidings from Admiral Sampson
they are not neglecting other points of
deep interest just now. A night force
of telegraph operators has been placed
on duty in the State Department, War
Department and Navy Department.
They are now engaged, together with
the clerks, in receiving and translating
cipher dispatches from every ouarte'r
having any connection with the move
ment of vessels and other matters relat
ing to the Hispano-American war.
The military and naval strategic
boards are also at work practicalh
night and day and there is little rest for
any one here in Washington in these
exciting times.
The President has delayed his call for
volunteers in accordance with the act
of Congress passed to-day on account
of the legal questions involved relating
to the number of men to be called out
and to the .distinction made between
volunteers and militia. The matter has
been referred to the Attorney General,
who is expected to render a decision in
time for the President to act in the
matter.
A special session of the House has
been called for 10 o'clock to-morrow for
the purpose of passing the army reor
ganization bill in time for final action
on that measure by the Senate when it
meets at noon.
The Secretary of the Navy has asked
Congress for authority to enlist p na\'ai
auxiliary force to man the torpedo fleet
intended for coast defense purposes.
There is a difference of opinion be
tween Secretary Alger and General
Miles as to the time of movement of
necessary troops and fleets into Cuban
territory. Secretary Algcr, carrying out
the wishes of General Lee. it is under
stood, wants the troops to go Jihead
without waiting for the call for volun
teers. General Miles, on the other hand,
thinks it dangerous to send less than
50.000 troops into Cuba, and deems it
advisable to wait until this number has
been organized and drilled before an
attempt is mat!.' to occupy the island.
President McKinley's first caller of
significance was Senator Davis, of Min
nesota, chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations. The frequent visits
of the Minnesota Senator to the Exe
cutive Mansion at all hours of the day
and evening strengthen the report that
he may be selected as premier of the
administration should Secretary Sher
man voluntarily resign from the Cab
inet.

LONDON, Ar-ril 22.â Great Britain's

scarcely a public man or imnortant
newspaper that d s not wwilye â ily sup- !
port the United States. At the same
time, in private conversation, there is
much criticism of the United States, j
and indorsement of Spain is '--^ard.
' is much head shaking over the
result of the naval battle, am", the feel-
Ing even finds its way into print.
The Daily Graphic to-day printed a
long letter from a naval oflV - who :
says both Porto Rico and Havana
ought to Le able to hold their c
against an attack unsupported by |
ships. The United States will be forced
to blockade both of these islands, and ;
this, the author of the letter th.nks,
will occupy that nation's entire fleet,
thus leaving the Spaniards free to bom- |
bard the, coast of the United States. I
Again, the letter says Spain is strong
enough to defeat either of the '. lockad-
Ing fleets which th' United States is
able to assemble about Cuta and Porto
Rico. In conclusion the writer thinks
that the ships of the Indiana class are
BO prodigiously overgunned that they
are likely to sink themselves.
An editorial article in the Chronicle
to-day expresses the opinion that the
United States fleet was throwing away
an excellent strategic opportunity by :
going to Cuba instead of intercepting
the Spanish fleet.
The Daily Mail, whose proprietor,
Alfred Harmsworth, is really a warm
sympathizer with the United States, is
doing much to arouse sentiment by the
daily publication of articles bearing
upon the atrocitfes perpetrated by
Spaniards, accompanied by pictures of
the starving reconcentrados, under the ;
heading, " \Vhy Amercia Is Interven- ;
inj in Cuba," with the Kipling parody.
"If Blood Be the Price of Liberty. Lord
God. We Have Paid the Bill." At the
same time the Daily Mail to-day dis
plays a New York dispatch with the
headline, "Scare in America. New
York Merchants Closing Their Shops."
The dispatch says that many wealthy .
New Yorkers are fleeing, fearing lest i
the fleet of the United States will be
vanquished and the city bombarded.
Continental Europe steadfastly re
fuse* to believe that the United States
la embarking in war for any other ob
ject than conquest. Being prone to
judge American motives by standards
other than appear to actuate their own
national policies the continental papers j
predict with the greatest jealousy that
the United States will retain all the ,
Spanish colonies, which it will inevita- â 
b!y capture, and that the United States
will then become one of the strongest
rivals in the scramble for the few re
maining unoccupied portions of the
'arth. All opinions and interviews con
tained in the press of continental Eu
rope, read between the lines, convey
'his view.
The first effect of the war was felt
in Great Britain in the rise in wheat
which has been the means of inducing
the bakers to discuss an advance in
the price of the four-pound loaf. Many
English farmers are holding under
heir sheds wheat; hopeful that the
prolonged hostilities may send grain
jj> to the Franco-Prussian war prices.
Liverpool and Manchester trade with
the West Indies has been knocked on
the head by the notification that no
more boats will sail for Cuba and Porto
Rico. Two ships which were billed to
sail from Liverpool or. Saturday have
canceled their departure in anticipation
of the blockade of Cuba. Shippers find
solace in the prospect that the war will
result in ending the strongly differen
tial tariffs in favor of Barcelona, which
have been forced in all Spanish colo
nies.

DYNAMITE
CAR WRECKED
AT MENDOTA
FRESNO, April 22.â The southbound overland freight wns wrecked
at Mendota to-day. Two engines and seventeen cars piled up, a mass of
debris. The train was a double-header, two engines being used to haul
a heavy string of forty or fifty cars. Engineers and firemen of both
engines jumped and saved their lives.
There was a peculiar and almost miraculous feature of the accident.
One of the most badly wrecked cars contained dynamite en route to
New Orleans for the Government, to be used in the war with Spain.
Trainmen are at a loss to account for the fact that the dynamite did
not explode, causing loss of life and great damage.
It is believed that two hobos are buried in the wreck. They were
seen riding on the brakes at Firebaugh and were not observed to leave
the scene of the wreck. One tramp riding in a refrigerator car emerged
after the wreck and coolly inquired what was the matter.
The train was coming into Mendota at 12:30 o'clock and running at
a speed of about fifteen miles an hour, when the rails gave way and
spread under the heavy pressure of the engines. This was at a point
about 300 yards north of the station. The engines had just pulled over
the switch when they jumped the track. Engineer Pat McGrough and
Fireman George Drake were on the first engine. When they leaped from
the train they called to Engineer Thomas and the fireman of the other
engine to jump for their lives. The men in the second engine were only
r moment behind those of the first in leaving their engine.
The engines proceeded over the track for a short distance, and then
tumbled over the side of the track, a mass of bent and twisted iron and
steel. Seventeen freight cars were piled upon each other, making a
big heap of wreckage. Most of the cars were completely demolished.
Twenty-five or thirty remained on the track and wire uninjured. The
wood of the wrecked cars is splintered and the iron bent-
At a late hour to-night the wreck had not yet been cleared.

NEW YORK, April 22.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: With
the prospect of transporting a large
army for the invasion and occupation
of Cuba within the next few weeks
Secretary Alger has issued instructions
! to the proper officials to make special
i preparations for prevention of disease
; among the troops and for the care of
sick and wounded. The officers to whom
; these instructions apply with particular
! force are the surgeon general, quarter
' master general and commissary gen
i err ".. Surgeon General Sternberg, who
I is a yellow fever expert, has issued par
ticular instructions to the medical corps
â  for the prevention of contraction of the
1 dreaded disease by the men who may
!be sent into Cuba. These instructions
j deal particularly with the quantity and
\ quality of rations which should be Is-
I sued; a matter which chiefly concerns
I the commissary department.
Especial stress is placed upon the
necessity of enforcing a perfect system
of sanitation and drainage in camps
and headquarters. The necessity of ab
stinence from the use of alcohol and
excessive use of tobacco is dwelt upon
and the advisability of issuing quanti
ties of effervescent drinks is men
tioned.
A large hospital is to be established
near Atlanta in the post building at
Fort McPherson. just vacated by the
departure of the Fifth Infantry f.,-r

SYMPATHIZE
WITH SPAIN
Copyrighted, ISS'. by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, April 22.â "11 ny d'Europe,"
cries the Gaulois plaintively, recording
the fact that none f the great powers
I intended going to war with the United
States in behalf of Spain. This paper
has come out fiat-footed for Spain,
more so than most of the Paris contem
poraries. But even the Gaulois goes
no further than to lament the "indiffer
ence of Europe, which gazes with arms
â¢ cr-ossed at the unequal duel."
"Doubtless," it continues, "platonic
sympathy is expressed for Spain;
doubtless her heroic tenacity i.s ;iii

plauded, but no one dreams of goin<
to her aid. There is no Europe sine-*
France condemned herself to relire

! which forms one of the best fon

The Journal dcs Debats says that
whatever may be the sympathy nÂ£ th?
French people for Spain, they have nu\v
only to observe a strict neutrality.
The Figaro says that the -war means

The Petit Journal speaks of "the

The number of troops in the camp to
day was increased by about 3000. Fif
teen trainloads of infantry, cavalry and
artillery arrived during the day. and
were conveyed as rapidly as possible to
the park. The troops are now arriv
ing so fast that the railroads are ex
periencing some difficulty in handling
them promptly.
Nearly all of the Fort Sheridan
troops wore flowers which had been
pinned on their coats between Nash
ville and Chattanooga by admiring
ladies, but they were minus many brass
buttons, taken in return.
To-morrow Major-General Brooke
will make his headquarters on the field,
the location being on the east slope of
Lytle Hill, and not far distant from
where General Wilder of the Federal
forces was killed during the battle
which gives the nark its name. Quar
master-General Lee, it is probable, will
also make l.!s headquarters at the
grounds to-morrow.
The increased strength of the artil
lery companies from four to six pieces,
which has been ordered, has rendered
necessary the purchase of about 500
horses, and this fact is giving General
Lee a deal of trouble. He spent a great
deal of time to-day in an unavailing ef
fort to find suitable animals.
Sunday promises to be a gala day at

FOREIGN CREDITS
CANCELED BY THE
BANK OF SPAIN
Patriotic Stand of the People Temporarily Pre=
vents a Crash in Financial Circles, but a
Panic in the Bourses Is Certain.
MADRID, April 22.â There has been a slight run on the Bank of Spain, but the bank paid cash on all de
mands, and public confidence has been restored. During the day the bank.'*, stock rose ?* points. In spite of the
serious rise .i exchange unfavorable to Spain, thÂ«, Bourse took a patriotic view of the situation. Interiors rose
one point and Cubans three points. At the close- of the Bourse there was a patriotic demonstration, with the ob
ject of covering the American shield in the American dealers' room with the Spanish flag. As I write bands and
demonstrators pass the window everyfew minutes, almost furious in their enthusiasm. In the center of each
waves a Spanish- flag. In the Puerto del Sol I witnessed a strange scene this afternoon.
The procession passed one of men carrying the national flag. Across it was written "Viva ipana." As it
passed the people recerently uncovered. There is a. growing fire among the people, a sure indication the flame is
ready to burst forth on the news of action. It is visible everywhere even in bands of school children, who are
rushing about in hundreds crying "Viva Espana," and "Viva the army and navy."
VALENCIA, April 22.â A financial panic is reigning here, produced by the unprecedented rise in exchange and
the alarming depreciation of Spanish bonds and in the national credit. There was a rush to-day on the Bank of
Spain to change paper money for silver.
There was a hastily summoned meeting of bankers and merchants, who proposed to take at their full face
value all the ban", notes presented, which momentarily allayed the excitement, but did not restore confidence.
Foreign credits have been canceled. Business is paralyzed. A monster open-air meeting has been convened for Sun
day to raise war funds. The rumored intention of the Government to expel from Spanish territory all corre
spondents of American Journals has been universally applauded by the public and the press urges the Government
to maintain its right of search of ships flying neutral fin-?!, the avowed object being to mortify England, against
whom feeling is most bitter, owing to her undisguised American sympathy.
ONE ENGLISH
PAPER HOSTILE
St. James Gazette Fears
America's Growing
Power.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 22.â The St. James
Gazette this afternoon, discussing the
interests of spectators of the coming
hostilities, says:
"Taking for granted President Mc-
Kinley's sincerity in saying that the
United States does not desire conquest
or territory, the fact remains that tho.
United States, which call themselves
America, are engaged in endeavoring
to expel a European power fro-m her
foothold in the New World. This can
hardly happen without giving increased
force to the sentiment which Mr. Olney
expressed in such crude terms in his
letter to the Marquis of Salisbury, and
the war can hardly end without affect
ing the general position of European
powers profoundly, be its course what
it may."
Referring to the possible action of
the United States, the St. James Ga
zette says:
"Spain has done something to put
herself right with public opinion in Eu
rope, and no doubt she, to some ex
tent, is fighting in a common cause.
If she gains success and proves herself
capable of making headway against
the United States at sea, thus indicat
ing the presence of a weakness in the
American navy not hitherto suspected,
the disposition of the powers to inter
vene will be greatly strengthened.
"There is a great deal of billing and
cooing among emotional Anglo-Saxons
at present. In the United States there
is a certain amount of gush, probably
as sincere as the hysterical emotion ex
cited by Bryan's flashy "cross of gold'
metaphor. Here there are always peo
ple who gush when America is con
cerned, but these waves of emotion
come and go. Deep rooted feelings of
dislike and substantial interests don't."
ORDERS TO INTERCEPT
TWO SPANISH SHIPS.
NEW ORLEANS, April 22.â Orders
have been issued to intercept and seize
the Catalina and Miguel Joves, the
Spanish ships which left here last
night. The Louisiana naval reserves
will be put in service to-morrow, part
going to Mobile and the main body to
the mouth of the river.

DELAYS CALL
FOR VOLUNTEERS
President McKinley Is in
Doubt as to His
Authority.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 22.â A Herald
Washington correspondent telegraphs: j
Whether President McKinley issues his
proclamation to-morrow calling for
300,000 volunteers depends upon the de
cision which will be rendered in the
morning by Attorney-General Griggs.
The issuing of the proclamation may
still further be delayed should the
President decide that a formal decla
ration of war by Congress is advisable
in advance of a call for troops.
With a preamble to cover the pres
ent situation, a proclamation calling
for 100,000 volunteers, couched essen
tially in the lanrruage of Abraham Lin
cuin: s first call for troops, was prepared
at the War Department and taken to
the President shortly after he had sign
ed the volunteer army act. In the dis
cussion of the issue of the proclama
tion, the President himself called at
tention to the fact that Congress has
authorized no limit to the number of
troops that may bo called out. The
volunteer army act provides the Presi
dent shall issue his proclamation stat
ing the number of men desired within
such limits as may be fixed by law.
In the House on Wednesday Repre
sentative March of Illinois argued that
the resolution empowering the Presi
dent to use the entire land and naval
forces of- the United States to inter
vene in Cuba, in itself authorized the
President to call out any number of
troops he saw fit, and that this legis
lation was sufficient to cover the pres
ent emergency. With this general
understanding the bill was passed by
both houses and agreed to to-day.
President McKinley, however, is viot
satisfied that his authority under law
to call out men is yet sufficient, with
out express authorization by Congress
of a stated limit. On account of this
uncertainty Attorney General Griggs
was requested to give a decision.
It is understood that the Attorney
General will hold that the language of
law is explicit in requiring a stated
limit to be tlxed by Conerress, and that
Congress will be asked to pass a reso
lution, probably to be affixed to a for
mal declaration of war, which is ex
pected to be made to-morrow. This
will give the necessary authority for
a call for 100,000 volunteers and should
the resolution pass early in the day it
is probable that the proclamation may
be issued to-morrow evening.
NEUTRALITY
OF NATIONS
How the United States
Proposes to Treat Ships
of Friendly Powers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 22.â Following
up the formalities beginning with the
blockade proclamation, the State De
partment this afternoon addressed an
identical note to all of the representa
tives of the foreign nations accredited to
Washington, notifying them of the pol
icy to be pursued by this Government in
the matter of privateering and neutral
ity. This was followed by the sending of
cable messages to all American em
bassies and legations abroad contain
ing the same information in a little
more succinct form for presentation to
the Governments to which they are ac
credited. The statement was precisely
similar in terms to that telegraphed
last Wednesday, and its formal adop-
tion by the Government as the line of
policy to be pursued was not prevented
by the criticism passed upon it in the
Senate yesterday by Money of Missis
sippi.
In brief, it declares that our Govern
ment will not resort to privateering:;
that enemies' goods on neutral bottoms,
save contraband, are exempt from seiz
ure; that neutral goods not contra
band under enemies' flag are exempt
from seizure, and that blockades, to be
binding, must be effective. In sub
stance, these are the principles laid
down in the agreement of Paris in 1856.
The officials are not disturbed at the
semi-official notice from Madrid that
Spain will refuse to be bound by the
same principles and forbid privateer
ing, for they are satisfied that the great
commercial powers will not tolerate the
practice of privateering under the
Spanish flag. Inasmuch as there ex
ists a great amount of misapprehen
sion, not only among foreign countries,

BLOCKADE
OF CUBAN
SEAPORTS.
How Sampson's Fleet
Will Shut Out Sup=
plies From Havana.
While the Blockade Is Being Ex
tended to Porto Rico Fly
ing Squadron Will Battle
With Enemy's Ships.
NEW YORK, April 22.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Appre
ciating that Havana is the key to the
military situation in Cuba, Rear Ad
miral Sampson, commander-in-onie* of
the North Atlantic squadron, has con
fin* d the blockade he instituted to poris
connecting by railroal with that city.
Sampson has also taken measures to
blockade the port of San Juan, Porto
Rico, and within the next few days an
official announcement of this blockade
will be made. Naturally the officials
will not say that Rear Admiral Samp
son has moved against Porto Rico, but
there is reason to believe that some of
the ships have been sent to San Juan
and the American flying squadron has
been held in reserve for the difficult
work of placing hors de combat Spain's
fleet now at Cape Verde Islands.
Secretary Long was in conference to
day with the naval war board discuss
ing the next move this Government
should make. This was the first time.
Secretary Long has been present at the
meeting of the board. He listened at
tentively to the discussion of â¢Â»â  â * ex
perts and entered into it with a decision
and judgment that was well anore
ciated by the officers with whom he
conferred. As soon as war is formally
declared by Congress, it is confident
ly expected that orders will be sent to
the flying squadron to proceed to sea
for the purpose of giving bat +l - to
Spain's squadron now at St. Vincent.
Before the battle takes place, how
ever Commodore Schley's fleet â**' be
reinforced. The efforts of the vessels
of the North Atlantic squadron, now in
Cuban waters, will be confined to pre
venting any supplies reaching Spain's
force in the city of Havana. An offi
cial with whom I talked pointed out
that Havana is the terminus of a net
work of railways, which connect with
Cardenas and Matanzas on the
east, and Bahia Honda, Port
Cabanas and Muriel on' the
west. Cienfuegos is also a railroad ter
minus, and if the blockade runners
could get supplies in that port, 'they
could be sent to Havana. It will be
the duty of American vessels to warn
neutral vessels away from these ports,
and should they then attempt to vio
late the blockade, they will be seized
and condemned as blockade runners
and will be taken before a prize court,
which will be held at Key West, and
will undoubtedly be condemned by that
judicial body.
"I can appreciate why no attempt is
being made by the department to block
ade the entire coast of Cuba," said a
well-known naval officer to me to-day.
"Rear-Admiral Sampson has not suf
ficient vessels to make such a blockade
effective, and it would do no good to
blockade a great many ports which are
held by small Spanish garrisons and
which cannot communicate with Ha
vana except by road. Sampson's plan
is to prevent supplies from reaching
the Spanish force in Havana, co as to
starve it into submission, or at least
into such a state that it will not be
able to give any great resistance to
the military expedition which will be
organized next week. The Insurgents
are expected to prevent any supplies
reaching Havana by interior communi
cation. I have no doubt that the in
surgents are actively engaged at this
moment in destroying every means of
communication between the interior
and Havana that it is possible to do."
Immediate with the issuance of the
President's proclamation declaring a
blockade of Cuban ports instructions
went to diplomatic representatives of
the United States, directing them to in
form the governments to which they
are accredited of the action taken by
the Government and the chnrncter of
the proclamation issued. This noti
fication to governments of the institu
tion of the blockade will be considered
as a notification to citizens and to any
neutral vessels leaving port after to
day for blockaded ports that such ves
sels will be liable to capture by Ameri
can men-of-war engaged in patrol
work.

ever that the gunboats and torpedo

ers, have been left in Cuban waters,
while the larger men-of-war have gona
to San- Juan, and by to-morrow even

President signed his proclamation, that
ail ports on the north coast of Cuba

General Blanco to Make
Stubborn Resistance
at Havana.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
TAMPA, April 22.â 1 am informed by
an intelligent Englishman who left
Havana yesterday that Captain-Gen
eral Blanco and the Spanish authori
ties have since the departure of Con
sul-General Lee regarded war as inev
itable and have been bending extraor
dinary energy' to the concentration of
troops and supplies in Havana. Nearly
a hundred thousand troops have been
assembled, of whom 40,000 are regulars
and the rest volunteers. This disposi
tion leaves Havana Province practi
cally at the mercy of insurgents, who
scorning the sham armistice, are re
ported unusually active. Several small
engagements have occurred within the
last week in which the Spanish say
they hava been successful.
General Blanco has openly announced
his intention to defend Havana against
the American fleet or army, or both.
Another enrollment of volunteers has
been made which includes nearly all
able-bodied men in the city and prov
ince and 30,000 have been distributed.
The new recruits are being constantly
drilled at night, and as a consequence
the city constantly resounds with war
like sounds. Residents of Havana ex
hibit enthusiasm and determination.
Many of the wealthy classes are clos
i ing their houses and moving to the in
j terior, anticipating a siege or bom
bardment.
Provisions are hoarded and prices
have risen enormous! 1 -. So far there
has been no lack of food, except among
the extremely poor -who will doutless
loot the city if General Blanco is de
feated and forced to evacuate It.
Spanish engineer officers have laid
out a plan for land defenses, and many
laborers are at work constructing: for
tifications. The Englishman, whose
name is not given, because he expects
to return, got away on a small
schooner.

Civil Governor of Madrid Rallies the
Superstitious Crowd by Putting
His Foot on the Emblem
of Liberty,
Copyrighted, ISPS, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID. April 22.â A wave of red
hot enthusiasm swept over this place
with the departure of the American
Minister. The demonstration upon the
station platform yesterday was the
first of a series that lasted well Into
the small hours of the morning. Ev
ery time a dozen or more people form
Into a group some one is sure to give
the signal, and "Viva Espana!" is
cried until all are hoarse.
An incident happened that has unfa
vorably troubled these people, so su
perstitions are all the races with
Latin blood in their veins. The hand
some building of the New York Equit
able Life Assurance Company stands
at tho corner of Calle de Alcala and
Calle de Sevilla. High upon the facade
and just below the dome stood last
night an immense eagle keeping guard
with outstretched wings over the
Btarred and striped shield of the United
States. Underneath, fastened to the
balcony, was a flagstaff, where on fes
tivals and holidays the American flag
is usually floated. Last night an an
gry crowd ns^i n:!>!ed there before the
building, howling for the American es
cutcheon to be turn down. As the
hours went by Ihe crowd became
denser. A Spanish flag was run out on
a pole and was greeted w.th wild
cheers.
Finally two men climbed up to theob
noxious t'jigii.' and shield and succeed
ed at last in tearing down the em
blem. This they Hung to the crowd be
low, which was waiting with frantic
Impatience t<Â» tear it to pieces. Hut in
Its fall the eagle with starry shield tore
away th>> Spanish tlag. and both fell
to the ground together. There was a
hush of dismay tor a moment. Then
some one caught up the flag and waved
it aloft, while tin 1 crowd swept around
It with shouts and even subs of en
thusiasm.
When the eagle fell the civil gov
ernor of the town, Senor Aquiilor.
who makes his functions popular by
his leading and controlling crowds,
put his foot upon the offending bird
and began a patriotic speech, which
was highly applauded.
Senor Kosilio, director of the Equit
nhl" agency, made a speech from the
balcony, stating that all employes in
the building were Spanish and that the
institution was mortgaged upon the
lives of Spanish subjects. The building
was now bright with Spanish flags.
Meanwhile the authorities had sent to
the ofii'-c-s of the New York Life In
surance Company, asking Director

SPAIN MAY
HEED ADVICE
Still a Chance That There
Will Be No Privateer
ing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 22.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald Fays:
"The President remains commenda
bly pacific to the utmost limit," said a
prominent diplomat to me to-night.
"Eve i in beginning the war he only
inaugurates a blockade and hesitates to
fire the first shot. As commendable as
this is in view of the great pressure
brought to bear upon him. it must be
particularly irritating to Spain. It is
treating her just as the pcwerfl treated
Greece last year in blockading Crete.
And it would not be surprising if in
dignation did not force the Spaniards
to bring on actual hostilities either by
attacking our fleet with the small boats
In Cuban harbors or in forcing an pn
page:/ient with their fleet now supposed
to be headed westward."
This may be taken as the typical view
of diplomatists ir Washington. All i*f
the members of the diplomatic corps
with whom I have talked seem to ex
pect nothing further than strict neu
trality on the part of their respective
Government?. The idea of underhand
assistance for Spain they wholly dis
credit, except such private aid as may
come from those interested in Spanish
securities.
There will not be any necessity for
proclamations of neutrality, although
they may be given out. None was is
sued at the outbreak of hostilities last
spring in Thessaly. Once diplomatic
relations between two countries are
Revered and war is declared, neutrality
and the granting of rights of belliger
ency follow as a matter of course.
The most positive part to be taken by
foreign powers in trouble may
result in Spain's refusal to
abide by the treaty of Paris
in regard to privateering. It is thought
that the positive position taken by the
great powers against it, and the loss of
sympathy if she persists In ignoring the
trpaty, will finally cause Spain to give
the treaty reluctant recognition. The
knowledge that British sympathy and
sentiment are already against her and
that British commerce will be most
Injured if privateering prevails, may
Induce the Spanish Government to fol
low this old-time chief resource of
Spanish naval warfare,
the sign ia large and of Iron â was com
pleted as the day was dawning.
The prevailing idea of the moment is
to obliterate everything American,
however trifling, and it has even come
<:.>wn to the sign of an American dent
ist. Dr. Tinker, which was wrenched
away. There was a rumor on the
Bourse to-day that Austria had offered
four warships to Spain, the latter, to
pay when convenient. The Correspon
dencia suggests to the Government the
expulsion of all correspondents writing
for American papers on the plea that
they know too much.
Senor Sagasta is evidently going to
remain in power, his object in offer
ing to the Government the reins of
power being merely to strengthen his
hand.
During General Woodford's journey
from Spain there have been many dis
orderly scenes at stations where the
train stopped. General Woodford knew
nothing of the disturbances until he
reached Tolosa. There a sergeant of
the civil guard, accompanied by a priv
ate, boarded the train and demanded
that Mr. Joaquiri Moreno disembark
from the car. James, the general's
valet, thereupon awakened the general,
who hurriedly dresssd while matters
were being explained to him.
The general then formally protested,
through the medium of a correspond
ent, against the attempted interference
with his suite, declaring that Mr. Mo
reno was his private secretary and a
British subject. The Spaniards claimed
that he was a Spanish subject, but the
general refused to give him up to the
police and placed himself In the door
way of the compartment in which Mr.
Moreno was traveling, declaring he
would only surrender the latter if
forced to do so.
The Minister then asked the corres
pondent to explain to the Spaniards
that he placed Mr. Moreno under the
protection of the British flag and that
if they took him It would only be by
using personal violence to the United
States Minister, who proposed to pro
tect Mr. Moreno until the frontier was
crossed.
If an artist had been present at that
moment, ho could have secured material
for a striking picture of the gallant
general blocking the doorway against
the dons and the smiling encourage
ment of his friends, who were quite j
handy and realy to protect him if any
attempt had been made to touch the
Minister. The picture might have been
completed by a reproduction of the I
grinning features of James, delighted
at the prospect of a brush with the
Spaniards. General Woodford whis
pered to the correspondent, who after
ward drew the Spaniards into a cor
ner and explained to them the serious
nature of their action, pointing out that
it might lead to complications with i
Great Britain. This argument prevail- i
od, and the troublesome visitors with
drew. When the train reached San Se
bastian Mr. Moreno and General Wood
ford felt considerably relieved.
SPAIN FAVORS
PIRATICAL WAR
El Epoca Intimates Mad
rid Will Issue Letters
of Marque.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID, April 22.â El Epoca (Con
servative) discusses the question of
privateers, and expresses a doubt of
the truth of the report that the United
States has renounced this option, "in
asmuch as America and Spain were
the only nations that maintained the
option at the Congress of Paris in 1856."
The paper insists that "all the argu
ments then adduced by the United
States for upholding the option now
are in favor of Spain, who will not re
nounce it."
El Epoca says also that "Spain does
not consider fair the declaration of the
neutral powers as to contraband of
war, thus favoring one of the belliger
ents, namely, America," and it cites the
case of England in 1885, who opposd
stoutly the action of France in the
Tonquin war in declaring rice contra
band.
"All that England then alleged in
favor or Uriusn subjects," says El
: Epoch, "can be urged by Spain respect
j ing coal, which is the bread of life of
â  industry, without which modern war
fare is impossible."
Respecting the blockade of Cuba, El
I Epoca calls to mind and invites the at
! tention of Europe to the fact that
| "both America and Spain accepted
: clause four in the declaration of Paris.
I providing that 'a blockade must be ef
fective and not on paper.' "
El Epoca declares that twice the
present American fleet would not be
adequate to establish an effective
i blockade of Cuba. Moreover, under the
| established rules, a blockade requires
! previous notification to the authorities
: of Cuba and the powers, allowing all
i shipping a definite term to clear out of

Interests of the Pacific Coast in the

Copyright, 1898, by George Grantham Bain.
NEW HAVEN, April 22.â Edward J.
Phelps, ex-Minister to England, is an
authority on international law and in
ternational relations. While our repre
sentative at the court of St. James it
was his privilege to enjoy a wealth of
opportunity along the lines of studying
the real attitude of the Englishman
toward the American poeple. Keenly
alive to the facts Mr. Phelps has since
his return to this country made a study
of comparisons and it is doubtful if any
man is better fitted to speak of the
actual attitude of each nation toward
the other than he.
When he was asked to say exactly
what, in his opinion, the facts were re
garding our situation at home and
abroadâ the facts that would form the
basis of dispassionate consideration of
the wisdom of an alliance â he said:
The wisdom of an jilHanee between the
I'nlted States and England depends upon
the terms proposed. Anything that will
strengthen the brotherly feeling between
the people of the two nations should be
fostered. There Is an element in our
own country which would oppose any al
liance, but in England nothing of the
sort exists. I know that we are regarded
by Englishmen with fraternal kindness.
For defensive reasons we need no as
sistance from any one. We can take care
of ourselves under any circumstances
which seem possible. The Chinese ques
tion has, however, assumed an import
ance that under all circumstances makes
It necessary for us to look seriously upon
the suggestion of an alliance with Eng
land. I am not prepared to say that we
should or should not form an alliance so
far as individual questions are concerned.
The only point of view from which we
can now consider the matter Is on the
basis of the broad principle itself, on the
broad ground of general advisability.
What do you consider the leading rea
sons in favor of an alliance?
It seems to me there are several rea-
Bons, the first important being one which
I fancy may not meet altogether with the
approval of the massesâ the benefit Eng
land would be to us under such circum
stances. She is a far older nation and
therefore more experienced, possessing
the calm wisdom that comes with age
and the power to Judge dispassionately.
We should be to her like the young part
ner to the old one, and, as in the case of
such a partnership, the younger always
gains through the ripe knowledge of his
elder. The calm, firm, wise policy of
England results in the, settlement of diffi
culty, where often the ephemeral pas
sages of our diplomacy accomplish little
or nothing.
Another reason which might weigh in
favor of an alliance is the presence of our
great neighbor to the north that stretches
from sea to seaâ Canada, But for the
presence of Canada nothing would con
front us at home which would make it
possible that we might have serious diffi
culty with England. But no man can
foresee what will happen. There are
difficulties between nations under such
circumstances Just as there are between
landowners or In business life. Therefore
I say that just so long as Canada exists,
so long is there a possibility of difficulty
whit h an alliance would be very apt to
remove.
Again, there is the moral strength that
we should enjoy through an alliance with
England. I mean the moral strength re
sulting from the effect of such an alli
ance upon other nations. It is not to be
supposed for a moment that any power
would attack the United States and Eng
land if those two nations presented a
solid front. For that reason an alliance
might be advantageous.
Then there is another reason that we
should by no means forget in considering
this question of alliance. This is that it
would still further cement the fraternal
feeling which now exists. The people of
Great Britain are favorably disposed to
ward the people of the United States.
Map of Cuba and the Adjacent Waters, Showing the Scope of the Blockade Instituted
by Rear Admiral Sampson's Fleet on the Order of the President.
The blockade of Cuban ports ordc ed by the President will be far mere effective than it promises to be at first glance. Bahla Honda. Cabanas and
Mariel on the west and Matanzas and Cardenas on the east, with Clenfuegos on the southern coast, include all the seaport termini of the several sys
tems of railroads connecting with Havana that are in operation in the western half of the island. With General Gomez and his army near Santa Clara,
shutting off communications by land, the western half and most important half of the island is entirely isolated. The large extent of the Cuban coast
line, over 2100 miles, precludes any possibility of an effectual blockade of the whole with the comparatively small number of ships at Captain Sampson's
disposal. With sixty-four armed vesselQ watching the coasts Spain has been unable to keep out the filibustering expeditions with supplies for the insur
gents.
They admire our pluck our energy, ouf
strength. You know we are all English
when it comes' to a matter <> f '"'
or at kast the majority of us are. Henct
tnere is the consanguinity wmvl) -
ever exist between two nations allied by
the closest of all tiesâ a common blood.
Still another fact we must consider
when surveying the field of reason
opened by the question of an Anglo-
American alliance is the effect upon com
merce. We are not a nation of seamen;
England is. Our marine is not developed.
Hers has gained with every year. If is
as a sea power that she holds her nigh
position. Were it otherwise she would
never be able to maintain her dignity and
power in all parts of the world. On the
sen an alliance would be of unquestioned
advantage to us.
Is it not possible for us to place our
selves on an equality with Great Britain?
Can we not build all the ships we need?
Unquestionably we can build ships. We
have as good shipwrights and as good
facilities for constructing vessels as 'could
be desired. But how can we man these
ships? We have more vessels now than
we have experienced crews for. You can
educate a man in the principles of mili
tary duty in a comparatively short space
of time, but seamen must be bred. Eng
land has been breeding them for cen
turies. Her mariners are to the manner
born. Your true seaman is never a lands
man. For this reason the sails of Eng
land's fleets are on every sea and her
ships are manned by men whose home is
the sea. who are more capable of deeds
of greatness on water than on land. Eng
land is infinitely superior on the ocean. It
would take js more than a hundred years
to bring our marine, our navy, up to her
standard.
Then you consider that an alliance with
England would, because of England's
powerful navy, be of advantage to us In
whatever position we might assume re
garding the settlement of the Chinese
question?
I would not say that. As I said before.
I do not think that the matter of an
alliance can now be intelligently and dis
passionately discussed on the basis of an
individual case. It Is a question of prin
ciple, of advisability, and. therefore, to
say we should rush into an alliance of
any sort because of one reason or an
other is unwise. It is possible that Eng
land's support would be of aid to us in
the Chinese matter. Certainly the United
States cannot assume an attitude of In
difference, for her commercial interests
that are Involved are altogether too Im
portant. We are prone to forget that we
have a Pacific Coast. We are inclined to
look at China as from New York, when
in reality New York has nothing to do
with the matter. Our commerce, our
traffic with the Eastern countries is a
possession of San Francisco and the Pa
cific Coast. We must recognize that fact.
The day is coming when all that section
of the United States will be filled with
people just as it Is east of the Mississippi.
Considering this fact, the necessity of ac
tion by our Government in the Chinese
matter is clearly apparent.
SPANISH SHIPS MAY
INTERCEPT THE PARIS.
SOUTHAMPTON, Eng;., April 22.â
The steamer Paris of the American
line, chartered by the Tnited States
Government, sailed at 2:15 p. m. for
New York, though her regular sailing
day is Saturday. She had 150 passen
gers, and her cargo included a quan
tity of guns and ammunition. There
was great enthusiasm among the
crowds on the docks, and the band of
the Union Steamship Company's
steamer Britain played "Yankee Doo
dle" as the Paris steamed seaward. The
Paris passed Hurst Castle at 3:35 p. m.
LONDON, April 23.â The Daily Mail
says: The Spanish embassy notified
the Madrid Government of the depart
ure of the Paris, and it is believed that
fast cruisers from Cadiz and Corunna
will try to intercept her.
The Liverpool correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph says: Surprise was
expressed here to-day (Friday) that
the Paris should have sailed unescort
ed, especially as there were rumors in
the Mersey that Spanish war vessels
were waiting to intercept her off the
south coast of Ireland. Yet the pas
sengers of the Paris were assured of
their perfect safety.
The Chronicle publishes a rumor that
the American liner Paris had already
been captured by Sranish warships.

VOYAGE OF

Naval Officers No Longer
Worry About Their
Safety.
The Vessels Will Take on Coal at
Rio de Janeiro and Then
Convoy the Nichtheroy
to Key West.
Copyrighted. IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
NEW YORK, April 22.â
Charles R. Flint & Co. an
nounced to-night that they had
received a cable from their
agents in Buenos Ayres, which
said that the Spanish torpedo
gun vessel Temerario was pre
paring to go to sea. The mes
sage further said it was report
ed that the Temerario was short
of ammunition, and that she was
trying to secure some from the
Argentine Republic.
BUENOS AYRES, April 22.â A1l the
coal available here and at Rio de Jan
eiro has been purchased by English and
American agents at the latter town.
The Oregon and Marietta will take the
Nictheroy to the United States. A bat
talion of Spanish volunteers has been
organized and equipped to go to Cuba.
NEW YORK, April 22.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
says: Learning that the Spanish tor
pedo gun vessel \iemerario is still at
Montevideo, naval officers heaved a
sigh of relief ar.d have ceased to worry
about the safety of the battle-ship Ore
gon and the gunboat Marietta. The
Oregon left Callao, Peru, April 5, and
it is believed that during the seven
teen days which have since elapsed she
has covered a distance of 4300 miles,
which would place her at this time in
about the vicinity of Montevideo.
There is reason to believe the Oregon
and the Marietta when next heard from
will be reported at Rio de Janiero. Min
ister Bryan, the American representa
tive to Brazil, has made arrangements
for coaling the ships immediately upon
their arrival. Brazil cannot refuse to
permit the vessels to purchase sufficient
coal to carry them to Key West, her
neutrality obligations only requiring
that she shall not permit her ports to
be used as a base of operations by one
power against another. After leaving
Rio de Janeiro the Oregon and the
Marietta will steam at once to Key
West, where they will coal. They will
then join the North Atlantic squadron.
I was told at the Navy Department
to-day that the Nichtheroy had not
sailed from Rio Janeiro, and the of
ficials state now that as war is now on
between the United States and Spain
the former Brazilian cruiser will be
held at her present anchorage until
the arrival of the Oregon and the
Marietta, which will convoy her to the
United States. It has developed that
Brazil declined to sell the Nichtheroy
with her battery, so that when she
starts for this country she will have
no guns aboard. There is no doubt in
the minds of the officials of the ability
of the Oregon and M.arietta to stand
off any of the vessels of the Spanish
navy in the West Indies which may
attempt to interfere with their voyagÂ«
to Key West.
Dolan Charged With Perjury.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April 22.â The latest phase of
the Nevills-Azhderian case, which is at
tracting much interest in this city, oc
curredthis evening, when M. H. Az.hderian
swore to a warrant for the arrest ot
Thomas Dolan on a charge of perjury.
John Azhderian and Myron, his brother,
have suits for $25,000 and JT-O.noo respec
tively against Nevills for alleged impris
onment in the Palace Hotel at San Fran
cisco, and Captain Nevills does not hesi
tate to say that there is a conspiracy to
blackmail him. An effort is being made
to probe the matter to the bottom, and a
number of arrests have been made, the
purpose of which Is generally believed to
ne to get a chance to question witnesses
under oath and elicit from them facts
concerning the conspiracy.
Dolan was arrested fcr disturbing the
peace of Azhderian and pleaded guilty, the
influence was brought to bear and the
case was tried and resulted in sensational
testimony of a plot to assassinate Cap
tain Nevills being brought out. lÂ»olan
told under oath that Azhderian had a: -
1 proached him and made a proposition to
: murder Nevills. Dolan's testimony in
volved Myron Azhderian and Mrs. "Wil
liams, who were employed at Nevills'
Paragon vineyard. Azhderian denied the
: story, declaring it all a fabrication, and
i has charged Dolan with perjury for testi
! fying to it.
Dolan, it is understood, will receive the
support of Captain Nevills, while Azhde
. rian will have the benefit of Mrs. Wil
liams' testimony. She will swear the
story is not true.

â¢ U HAILED FREE-THE MILITIA CALLED OUT
The field duty which National Guardsmen of California have been so caper to perform is at hand. The long period of inactivity and suspense is about over. To-day Major General
Dickinson, division commander of the National Guard of the State, will, by direction of Governor Budd, commander-in-chief of the military and naval forces of California, call the entire guard
into service.
Governor Budd, Adjutant General Dickinson and Brigadier General Warfield were busy at headquarters in the California Hotel yesterday. It was thought early in the day that the
command to place the division on waiting orders would go out before the day closed. Later on it was decided to defer the promulgation of the order until this morning. It transpires that the
order is already prepared by the adjutant general and only awaits the signature of the Governor. The effect of calling out the troops will be to place officers and enlisted men on the State payroll.
The Naval Reserve, as an organization of the National Guard, is included in the order.
The Senate amendment to the volunteer bill, which Senator White presented at the suggestion of Governor Budd, authorized the acceptance of a compact division of State troops.
The Governor had planned to tender the entire division of California troops to the President and go into the field himself. Later in the evening the text of the bill was received by The Call
from Washington, wherein it appears that Senator White's amendment was modified. The modification makes a regiment the largest single organization that can be accepted from any State.
Governor Budd inclines to the belief that two regiments will be California's quota under the call for 100.000 troops. He said last night "If I receive the call .to-morrow for
2000 men from this State I shall immediately inform the President by wire that two regiments of iooo men each will rendezvous without delay at places to be designated. I am not prepared to
say to-ni^ht what organizations of the National Guard will be called out to serve in the volunteer army. It is probable that companies will be selected from each of the existing organized brigades.
I cannot tell now whether we will be expected to furnish only infantry, or infantry, cavalry and artillery. If the division is called out the Naval Reserve will of course be included and the
men responding to duty will receive the State pay of $2 a day in addition to the amount paid by the United States. This allowance of $2 a day is regarded as payment for the time that mem
bers of the Guard have served in making themselves familiar with military duties."
The opinion was expressed by officers of the National Guard last night that the Governor would take the field with the State troops, leaving to Lieutenant Governor Jeter the duty of di
recting the .-itlairs of the State.
The members of the Guard will receive a complete equipment of new uniforms next Monday. The clothing was purchased by money appropriated by the Legislature at the last ses
sion. Doubtless the men will go into the United States' service wearing the uniforms provided by the State. This is a great point in favor of immediate response under the call.
One regiment of California troops may be ordered for duty at the Presidio. The Governor may get intelligence from Washington to-day which will indicate the particular field of
service to which the California troops will be assigned.

promulgate orders directing Battery
G, Third Artillery, comprising the
garrison at the isiand, to proceed to
the Presidio next Monday. The order
also directs that Colonel M. P. Miller,

lead to the appointment of Colonel
Miller as commander of the post at
the Presidio.
It is believed that Lieutenant Col

ignited from ihe heat of the residue in
the gun unless the chamber is thor

before reloading. He recommends that
in continuous firing with aeacoast guns
using brown prismatic powder the pow

Yesterday General Merriam ascer
tained the quantity of clothing in the
depot quartermaster's stores. He re
marked after the inspection that the

STATE TROOPS.
Animated Scenes at Head
quarters of the National
Guard of California.
Bright and early yesterday morning
Adjutant-General Barrett was on duty
at his temporary headquarters at the
California Hotel. He spent the early
hours of the morning in writing and
dispatching orders, which are sup
posed to have been of an official nature.
Early in the day Colonel Bergen re
ported at headquarters, ready for ser
vice. He remained throughout the day
in constant attendance upon the adju
tant-general.
Captain F. de L. Carrington, U. S.
A., of the First Infantry, arrived at
headquarters shortly after 10 o'clock.
Captain Carrington, who has beer,
on detail duty with the National
Guard, as soon as the relations
between this country and Spain
assumed their present gravity, wired
the adjutant-general of the United
States army asking to be relieved from
duty in order that he might accompany
his regiment East. The request has
been so far ignored, and Captain Car
rington will remain here for the pres
ent.
When the National Guard, under the
volunteer bill, is called upon for its pro
rata of men. Captain Carrington will
doubtless muster them into service.
During the entire day many of the
ex-members of the National Guard
called at headquarters to tender their
services. Members of the Governor's
staff also reported at headquarters.
All official news regarding the move
ments of the National Guard will come
through the adjutant-general's office.
Major-General Dickinson was ordered
yesterday to instruct all subordinate
officers to give out no news to the
press. This precaution is taken to pre
vent conflicting reports from being cir
culated.
The arrival of Governor Budd at
headquarters was the signal for in
creased excitement and activity among
the officers. His Excellency, as soon as
he had held a consultation, sent the
following very important telegram to
Washington:

The Governor was highly pleased over
the proviso In section 4 of the army
volunteer bill as passed by Congress
providing that existing organizations
of the State militia may at their discre
tion be turned into service for a term
of one year.
This inserted proviso was the result
of Governor Budd's telegram to Sena
tor White requesting that the National
Guard as an organization should be
given first opportunity to volunteer in
all cases. Senator White was requested

dently successfully done as is testiiied
by the framing of the bill.
Colonel James F. Smith, commanding
the First Infantry, reported at head
quarters about 3 o'clock in the after
noon. He stated that the First was in
excellent shape and was ready to 50
to the front.
Among the Governor's staff who were
at headquarters during the afternoon
were Lieutenant Colonels Bush, San
born, Howell and Young, and in addi
tion to these Lieutenant Colonel Geary,
retired, and Major Harney, ex-assistant
adjutant general and present Harbor
Commissioner, also called upon th'Â± ad- |
lutar.t general to see if their services j
might be needed.
The Governor was closeted through
out the afternoon with many of the
officers who called, but these confer
ences were entirely private.
'FIRST INFANTRY,
PASS IN REVIEW."
Mimic Warfare for Two
Hours at Mechanics'
Pavilion.
It was mimic war at the Pavilion for
two hours last evening, for the First
Infantry, N. G. C, was giving a drill
for the benefit of its new ride range,
or, if it be called out, to help equip the
men.
The First was there will full ranks
and nearly nine hundred strong; the
signal corps, the cavalry troop, the
sanitary corps and two guns from the
Naval Militia. To stirring music the
column moved past the reviewing
stand, where Governor Budd, Major-
General Dickinson and Brigadier-Gen
eral "YVarfield were seated in front. On
the reviewing stand were also the
staffs of the Governor, the division, the
brigade, several of the officers of the
Naval Militia and Colonel Sullivan of
the League of the Cross and his staff
and line officers.
The First was dressed in campaign
uniform, with canteens and haversacks.
The signal corps was similarly dressed.
The cavalry was in full dress and the
boys of the Naval Militia were in white
suits and leggins.
Following the review there was a
guard mount by a squad from Com
: pany F, under Captain John F. Mil
' ler, and then came a gun drill by the
Naval Militia, Lieutenant Dennis in
command of the platoon and Sub-Ldeu
tenant Emanueland Ensign Kammerrer
j in command of the guns. During thedrlll
the signal corps established a station
i at each end of the hall and sent torch
! signals back and forth with a dexterity
! born o-f long praeti<f. Following that
was a physical exercise drill by Com
i pany X, Captain Cunningham com
1 manding, and then came the feature of
the evening, the building of a bridge
I by Company B, Captain Filmer, an at
! tack upon Company I, Captain Hichter,
j and its defense by Company M, Oap
. tain O'Xeil, while the sanitary under
| Major McCarthy took care of the
j wounded.
The building of the bridge was the
most interesting thing, from a military
standpoint, that the guard has done in
this city for a long time. It was built
across a stretch of canvas representing
a river over twenty feet wide. A squad
of sixteen men formed on each sklÂ«
of the river, and stripping themselves
to the shirt the men went at it. First
the truss was put together, two up
rights with a cross piece bound across
the top; then four piers, one at each
water and the loading of those long
polished guns; then she is ready.
The Monadnock has been treated to
a coat of the same dark color and has

out through the straits yesterday al
most unobserved, for in the haze that
was hanging over the north basin she
looked like a moving cloud, and not a
very distinct one either. Like the Mon

to the top of her military mast.
The painting of the monitors has not
been the only preparation in the naval
arm of defense. The keepers at Alca-

corner, to lay the floor of the bridge
upon. These were formed of three
timbers bound together at the top to
form a tripod, and then stayed with
cross pieces at the bottom. Then the
two trusses were raised and the ends
allowed to interlock over the middle of
the mimic river and then a cross tim
ber was placed between the two piers j
and the stringers of the bridge were !
laid on that. In the meantime two
men had climbed to the top of the
truss, and after placing another cros>
piece in the crotch of the truss they
hung two loops down to the stringers
and putting cross pieces above and be
low the stringers and through the
loops, they twisted the loops with a.
bar until the truss and the stringers
were firm, as if grown together. Then
a constant stream of men from each
side and each with a board laid the
floor, and then the two squads got in
the middle of the completed structurt
and danced until there was no doubt 01
its strength. The whole thing had not
occupied more than fifteen minutes.
While the bridge was being com
pleted the attacking force opened fire
and then the defenders came up and
for a while the Pavilion was full of
smoko and noise and tongues of flam 6.
Then the troops were drawn back, and
to the merry strains of the band the
entire regiment marched across the
bridge in triumph. It was a gooa
practical piece of work and an excellent
drill.
After the passing of the regiment
the boys got at their bridge agnin ami
in half the time it took to put it up
they had it down and stowed away all
along the sides of the hall. Then the
floor was cleared for dancing and thÂ«
audience enjoyed itself for two hours
more.
The drills were all well applauded
and the martial spirit was rife. Each
particular company had its friends who
looked out that it did not lack appre
ciation, but when the flag came by it
was everybody's and the cheers shook
the roof.
A new rifle range has been a sore
need for the regiment, and it was
hoped that the entertainment would
bring it within reach, but if the regi

FOR THE WAR.
Forming a Regiment of
Volunteer Fire-
men.
Con Mooney, an old veteran of the
Volunteer Fire Department, has got
the war fever and got it bad. For some
time past, or perhaps even since the
war scare originated, he has been
working ardently among his friend 3nt
the Volunteers to fire their hearts with
some of his own true patriotism.
Mr. Mooney proposes to raise a regi
ment wholly from the ranKs of local
Volunteer firemen who are willing to
offer their services to Uncle Sam in the
field.

BEGAINED HEALTH.
Gratifying Letters to Mrs. Pink-
ham From Happy Women.
"I Owe You My Ufe."
Mrs. E. Woolhiser,
Mills, Neb., writes:
â¢' Dear Mns. Phtkham : â I owe my
life to your Vegetable Compound. The
doctors said I had consumption and
nothing could be done for me. My
menstruation had stopped and they
said my blood was turning to water. I i
had several doctors. They all said I
could not live. I began the use of Lydia
E. I'inkham's Vegetable Compound, j
and it helped me rig-ht away; menses
returned and I havo gained in weight.
I have better health than I have had for
years. It is wonderful what your Com-
pound has done forme."
"I Feel Like a New Person."
Mrs. Geo. Leach,
IGO9 Belle St., Alton, 111. . writes: \
" Before I began to take your Vege-
table Compound I was a great sufferer
from womb troubie. Menses would ap-
pear two and tfcree times in a month,
causing me to be so weak I could not
stand. I could neither sleep nor eat, and
looked so badly my friends hardly
knew me.
" I took doctor's medicine but did not
derive much benetit from it. My drug-
gist gave me one of your little books,
and after reading it I decided to try
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound. I feel like a new person. I
would not give your Compound for all
the doctors' medicine in the world. I
can not praise it enough."

STATUS OF THE GAS BONKS.
THE admission of Mr. Barrett, cashier of the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company, that
his concern has no right to demand a deposit
as a condition of furnishing meters to consumers
ought to do the soul of the corporation good â if it
h.'vc any such thing as a soul. Both it and its
twin, the Pacific Gas Improvement Company, as
well as their predecessors, the San Francisco Gas
Light and Central Gas companies, have lor years
been demanding deposits before they would supply
meters. The two former are supposed even now to
have as deposits many thousands of dollars obtained
from consumers upon which no interest is paid.
Cashier Barrett, who, according to the report of
his testimony in the suit brought by Henry James
to recover a $5 deposit, appears to be a good-natured
and accommodating gentleman, frankly told Justice
Barry that his company did not claim the right to
exact deposits for meters. When a man applied for
gas, he said, he got a deposit out of him if possible
"as a matter ot business." This, we presume, is ac
complished by telling him that he cannot get a
meter unless he pays the money. After the deposit
is made it is called a "voluntary contribution" to the
capital of the gas company, a contribution which
each consumer generously makes as a guarantee that
he will pay his bill.
Mr. Barrett was, however, kind enough to tell the
court how to avoid making these voluntary contri
butions. He said that all a consumer need do when
he applies for gas is to serve the company with a
written demand for a meter, whereupon, in accord
ance with section 629 of the Civil Code, it will sup
ply r meter at once. He suggested that possibly the
corporation might bluff a little even after this de
mand had been served, but it the consumer had suffi
cient sense to stick to his position he said it would
finally, like Colonel Crockett's coon, come down.
Now that gas meter deposits have been placed
upon a "voluntary contribution" basis, it will no
longer be necessary for gas consumers to make them
unless their benevolence and generosity impel;, them
to do so. Persons who have already "voluntarily"
contributed to the capital of the two gas companies
may obtain their deposits by applying for their
money. If its return is refused they need not bring
Bttit, as was done by Mr. James, but they should pay
their bill and order out the meter. As soon as that
elusive instrument is out they can have it replaced
simply by serving a written notice on the company.
Of course this will not be necessary. The moment
Cashier Barrett anTl his fellow diplomat of the Pa
cific Company see that their voluntary contributor
knows the law, they will relinquish the "voluntary
contribution" in their hands. Thus Mr. James' suit
has settled a great question of gas economy. Gas
consumers may abolish the carbon monoxide banks
at any time by simply withdrawing their deposits.
There is one thing upon which America can de
pend, and upon which Spain cannot. This is the in
tegrity of naval and military officers. Weyler stole
himself rich long ago, and richer in, Cuba. The
limited quantity of supplies in the island now proves
that the successors of the Weyler bandits are either
corrupt or that they have no idea of how to prepare
for war.
If the Oregon is in such peril as some people seem
to think because of the presence of a hostile torpedo
boat in South American waters, the modern battle
ship must be a rather serious joke. Let it still be
hoped that the torpedo boat is also exposed to a
degree of peril while in the vicinity of the Oregon.
It is a matter for congratulation that there has
been no sign of hostility manifested toward Spanish
residents of this city, and that there is no danger
that such feeling will be shown. San Francisco adds
to its strong patriotism the advantage of being civil
ized.
President Patton of Princeton has written some
thing about the "pigmy poets" of the present. Doubt
less it is interesting stuff. But has not Mr. Patton
taken a rather mean advantage of the absence of
Joaquin Miller? Â«
There is a growing belief that Chief Lees occa
sionally gets his own identity. mixed with that of > the
Czar.
The conclusion cannot be avoided tha 1 the Spanish
had a little diplomatic fun with Minister Woodford.
Doubtless there are members of the Cabinet who
would be less missed just now than Roosevelt.
fTTTENTION! FORWARD, MARCH!
TENACITY and courage are the often proved
characteristics of Americans. In three foreign
wars of magnitude our arms have been vic
torious. Xo other people have made such a record
of military success or shown greater self-denial and
sacrifice. Americans are bred and trained in per
sonal independence. During the Civil War it hap
pened time and again in action that when all the
commissioned officers of a formation had fallen a
private would spring from the ranks and give the
order for another charge.
Walking in the ways of peace for a generation, our
people suddenly put on war harness, and, when iheir
fighting blood is up, tactics occur to them spon
taneously and they subject themselves to military
discipline and acquire the art of war. so that they
seem to be seasoned soldiers before their faces are
bronzed by marches and battles.
The military enterprise at whose beginning the
country stands, sternly at "attention," is of such a
nature as to make it prospectively the greatest in his
tory, as its purpose is the most unselfish. Refusing
to acquire territory by conquest or to recoup our
selves by any reprisal whatsoever, we are entering a
struggle to vindicate the principle that when a na
tion ceases to govern well it shall cease to govern at
all, and shall withdraw its flag, fleets, forces and
jurisdiction, and leave the people to form their own
government, with freedom to enjoy man's inalienable
right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Our fleets are on the sea and the land thunders to
the tread of our armies, to enforce in the world an
enlarged view of the rights and responsibilities of
nations. If we win, as we. will, we will have written
into history something that will never die. The
principle that government, whether it derive its just
power from the consent of the governed or not,
must found it at least in the happiness of its people
will have been established, and along with it the right
of a strong people, governing themselves, to strike
down a flag that represents the misgovernment of
others, without absorbing them itself.
This is the first purely altruistic military enterprise
the world has seen. We are not going to the help of
a people who can help us, or whose help we will ever
need. We are not raising up an ally against a future
in which our own strength will need supplementing.
We don't want an inch of territory nor a dollar of
indemnity. Our high purpose is to emancipate man
from evil government. We do not even say he shall
be clothed with our right of self-government, but
that, under whatever form, he is entitled to good
government.
This stupendous enterprise has the solid backing
of our people, as the providential mission of this
republic. What prophet standing by our cradle six
score and two years ago would have dared foretell
what now is? Out of the stubborn courage and
silent suffering of our Revolutionary sires has come
this evolution of the right to compel justice among
the nations, but how vast the change from that time
when
"In their ragged regimentals
Stood the old Continentals,
Yielding not,"
to this, when out of their steadfast tracks rise ten
millions of fighting men to vindicate the right of
man to good government!
Compelling forces which none can resist have out
lined the cause in which we take up arms. Our re
sources are vast, but the struggle may consume them.
If so, the sacrifice will not be in vain, for we can
not fail. In our failure would be the retrogression
of government in every land on earth. While our
columns march to rendezvous and our fleets walk the
waters in this high cause men bend to their tasks
under the banners of the nations in every zone. Pre
scriptive right claims the fruit of their toil. For ter
ritorial aggrandizement or dynastic expansion they
are played as pawns in the gory game of war, and if
their bones are not left to bleach unhonored they
may go to their huts and turn their faces to the
ground again, with no profit in conquest and no view
of the glories they have created.
The crusades were undertaken to recapture for the
Christian world the custody of the holy sepulcher.
This enterprise of ours is to gain for man the right
to himself. The republic salutes its high mission
and ten millions of men drop plow and plane, look
to the flag and follow where it leads.
EVILS OF RACING.
THERE are circumstances under which horse
racing may be beneficial. It stimulates the
breeding of good horses, it affords an outing
where the fresh air is healthful, and from it there
comes to the occasional spectator a thrill of inno
cent pleasure, as the fleet runners strive to win. The
blood is stirred as it must have been of old when the
Roman charioteers lashed their steeds along the
arena. The climate of California is naturally adapted
to the production of the fast horse. Here he thrives,
the very atmosphere being congenial to his best de
velopment. About this there would be nothing to
regret, indeed it would be a commercial advantage,
if racing could have been followed to a reasonable
extent, and not permitted to degenerate, as it has
done, into a prolonged and desperate gambling
game.
Racing as carried on here is a most potent influence
for. corruption. Inspiring men with a futile hope of
gain, it has led them to dishonesty, to moral death,
to self-destruction. It has caused them to bet money
they could not afford to lose, has driven them to
steal the money to bet. It has caused them to neglect
their duty to family and employer. It has dragged
honored names in the dust of shame. Love of racing
for the sake of the chance it gives the gambling in
stinct is a disease. Its victims are enmeshed by
bonds as strong as tie the opium fiend to his drug.
The remedy is to limit the racing; remove the temp
tation which has degraded a noble' sport and made
men criminals. The local races, so far as their value
as speed contests are concerned, are fraudulent. They
are nothing but excuses for the gambler.
If one could observe the set, eager faces of the
race-goers, their jubilation at the rare winning, their
despair when luck goes against them, he could
readily understand these statements to be mild.
Perhaps the records of. the courts will tend to
strengthen the contention. Figel habitually played
the races. Now he is out on bonds with many
charges hanging over him. Welburn played the
races. He is an exile, a reward offered for his cap
ture. His cashier played the races. He rests in a
suicide's grave. Widber played the races. He is
in jail, known as a vulgar thief. Yet he never saw the
races. He simply wagered money on them, first
stealing the money. It may be said these are ex
treme cases. Tbey are fair examples. Every day
some collector, some clerk, some petty cashier, goes
wrong; always the races are given as the reason.
Closing poolrooms will not check the mischief.
There has grown up a custom among employes Â»f a

commissioner, who is sent to the track. Employers,
with good cause, are growing distrustful.
There is another phase of the evil even more dis
tressing. It is the woman gambler. Women
when once they catch the craze are worse than men,
more reckless. And many times they, too, spend
money to which they have no right. More than one
family has been severed because of this weakness on
the part of the wife. More than one family is now
near disgrace because the mania for gaming has
seized the wife and she is giving to the bookmaker
funds which ought to go to household expenses.
These are the reasons why racing should be
checked. It is a chronic temptation. . Under the
present system it must be a detriment to public
morals, debasing, yet exercising a sort of fascination.
A little of it might do no harm: an unrestricted
quantity of it has been proved distinctly harmful,
baleful, demoralizing.
TREASURER WIDBER'S DOWNFALL.
UPON the practical features of the defalcations
of Treasurer Widber there is but one comment
to be made. Either the officials whose duty it is
at intervals to count the money in his hands and
check up his books have been asleep, or they have
been singularly unmindful of their duties and respon
sibilities.
According to all accounts Widber has been going
the pace that kills for over a year. He began by
taking from the Treasury a small sum of money to
make good a deficit which he had created in the
funds of his father's estate. The success which at
tended this operation apparently emboldened him to
make further demands upon the taxpayers. His own
confession shows that he has been stealing exten
sively for months. The testimony of his deputies
and associates shows that during that period his dis
solute habits were well known to habitues of the City
Hall and frequenters of the tenderloin. He has been
known to be a race-track gambler and an associate
of bad characters, both male and female, a heavy in
vestor in real estate, an owner of fast horses, and a
speculator in mines. Yet it has never occurred to
anybody to question his financial standing nor to in
quire into the source from which he has obtained the
money to plunge so desperately.
During the period of which we speak one of his
deputies has turned up a defaulter. This individual
was saved from prosecution by Widber himself, who
made good the amount of his stealings. Notwith
standing all these suspicious circumstances, calcu
lated to put the most careless man upon inquiry, the
fact appears to be that the Mayor, Auditor and Su
perior Judge, upon whom the law imposes the duty
of examining the Treasurer's accounts once a month,
have passed his bags of money as true to label and
have skipped over his accounts as perfect balances.
Nothing quite so remarkable as this has ever oc
curred in municipal history. Tax Collector Austin
stole $250,000, but the money consisted of protested
taxes, which had been on deposit at the local bank
in his own name. Deputy Treasurer Cassebohm
stole $20,000, but he was caught within two or
three months after the money had been abstracted, j
Widber, according to his own confession, has been j
stealing for more than a year.
Section 94 of the consolidation act makes it the
duty of the Mayor, Auditor and County Judge to
examine the books of the Treasurer once a month,
and to "see and count over all the moneys remain
ing in the hands of such Treasurer." It is quite evi
dent that this duty has not been performed. No at
tempt has been made to "see" the money in the
hands of the Treasurer. On the contrary, the
Mayor, 1 Auditor and Judge have accepted
the labels on His money-bags in lieu of the evidence
of their own eyes. It is not difficult, therefore, to
locate the blame for the defalcation. If the surety
bond given by \?idber does not yield a .sufficient
sum to make good his shortage, the officials respon
sible for this gross negligence should be forced to
disgorge. The taxpayers ought not to lose a cent.
Nor, if the law is enforced, can the taxpayers lose,
even should the surety company discover some ex
cuse for refusing to pay. Section 41 17 of the Poli
tical Code says: "Whenever, except in criminal
prosecutions, any special penalty, forfeiture or lia
bility is imposed on any officer for non-performance
or mal-performance of official duty, the liability
therefor attaches to the official bond of such officer,
and to the principal and sureties thereon."
J\A OST gratifying in every respect is the decision
/ \ of the managers of the Free Library to open
* *to the public direct access to upward of
10,000 volumes. The general reader is not always
desirous of some particular book. IIo:ts of people
of literary tastes like to look over volume after
volume before settling down to read or study. In
fact, when looking for some especial subject the
average man and woman does not always know what
work treats it in the way that bests suits the
object engaged upon at the time, and- accordingly
the freedom to wander at will over so large an array
of books and examine them before selecting is a
privilege of no mean value.
The gratification over the decision of the man
agers is increased by the fact that it has been well
deserved by the habitual patrons and beneficiaries of
the library. Experience has shown that the reading
public of the city can be trusted with the books.
Something more than two years ago a test was made
by placing upward of 5000 juvenile books in a posi
tion where children could look over them and make
selections direct from the shelves. During twenty
one months of this time there were circulated 118.000
juvenile books, and of that large number only thirty
six volumes were lost.
Other tests were made in opening the shelves in the
branch libraries to the public, as well as those of the
reference and periodical rooms in the general library,
and here again experience has shown that no loss
follows this privilege granted to the public. The
class of people who make use of the library are evi
dently neither destructive to books nor dishonest, and
fully deserve the larger and freer use of the rich stores
of literature and learning which the riew rnle will
open to them.
Every movement which leads to an enlarged use
of public libraries is not only beneficial, but is a step
in the direction of giving to the people that which
belongs to them. They pay for the support of the
libraries by taxation and have a right to as free use
of them as is compatible with the safekeeping of the
books. It is for that reason The Call has repeatedly
urged the adoption of the traveling library system by
the State library. Books are of no use to the public
when kept inaccessible to the people. The Free Li
brary managers have done well in planning for an
enlarged use of the volume; on its shelves, and the
State library trustees will, we hope, find also some way
to give the public an enlarged use of the books in
that institution.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
In New York there have long been two
rival camps, the Seidlites and the Dam
roscians. They have been carrying on
war for years while art has been sitting
oft on one side. Lately it began to look
as if Walter Damrosch, having given his
attention to opera management, would
leave a clear field to Seidl to accept the
management of a permanent orchestra.
Seidl died, however, and now Walter
Damrosch has startled his admirers by
declaring that he is going to devote his
entire time to the work of composing
music. He has insisted on resigning
from the active leadership of the Sym
phony Society and the Oratorio Society
and declares that he Intends to retain only
a email interest in the Ellls-Damroseh
operatic venture next season. Thus are
two leaders removed, by one fell swoop
bo to speak, for the Seidlites declare that

it was Seidl's death which routed Walter
DamrOÃCh. According to thorn. It was
the excitement following the death of the
great Wagnerian conductor that showed
Walter Damrosch where he really stdod.
Not In a single newspaper was his name
suggested as a possible successor to
Seidl, and this so wounded 1 >a.mro?ch's
amour propre, say his enemies, that It
drove him from the New York field. It
is believed that an effort will be made
to put Frank Damrosch into his brother
Walter's shoes, at leasi to the extent of
installing him as conductor of the Sym

fortunately a much weaker vessel than

ment for Fannie Francesco, the San
Francisco girl who made a sensation at

icism. The French press is unanimous in
its praise of the singers, players, com

ordinary warblers "King like the night

composers, who may perchance be de
spised elsewhere, develop abnormal genius
as soon as they reach the world's biggest
gambling hell; in fact, the Parisian news
papers serin tii keep a special supply of
hysterical expressions of admiration in
order to apply to the musical feats per
formed at Monte Carlo. The secret of it
is that Monte Carlo pays princely sub
sidies to the French press, In order to
keep out everything unpleasant and get
in everything commendatory, and the
French press is not above pocketing the
backfiheesh. On this account fulsome
criticisms that come from Monte Carlo
should be taken with a number of grains
of salt.
A journalist from Warsaw, who re

The Musical Courier is responsible for
the following: The Melba Opera Com
pany, now giving what are satirically
termed operas in the West. Is a mere
makeshift intended as a frame for the cen
tral picture, which, of course. Is Melba.
This great singer is out in the "wild and
woolly" for the purpose of educating the
ignorant American in the operatic art. It
is not so much a question of money as of
education. Sooner or later the Westorn
ers beyond the Mississippi were bound to
learn what "Lucia," "Bohemian Girl "
"Martha," "Rigoletto" and other old
[tallan operas really meant, even if trav
estied, as they must be, when given with
small temporary orchestras, small ill
balanced choruses and surroundings that
give the performance the air of a shoddy
variety show. The artistic protest is sub
dued under the overwhelming- desire,
prompted by foreign love of America, to
educate the dear people who never heard
the old operas.
Massenet, who discovered Sibyl Sander
son, has found a new rara avis. This
time the lady does more than sing; she
delights the eye by her dancing as much
as she dors the ear by her warbling. Her
name is Mile. Mendes, and all Paris is
talking about her. Mile. Menrles was a
member of the corps de ballet at the
Paris Grand Opera, and no one connected
with the theater suspected her of having
a voice. One day Massenet was told by
a mutual friend that the lady could sing,
he heard her and was perfectly delighted
with her clear, rich voice. To give Mile.
Mendea an opportunity of displaying her
dual talent Massenet wrote a new ballet
to his opera "Thais." a work originally
writ tin f,ir Miss Sanderson, and gave
the leading dancer in the ballet a singing
role. "Thais," with its new baJlet, was
produced aa the Baster attraction at the
Grand Opera, and all Paris is talking
about the gifted Mile. Mendes.
Mme. Gemma Belllncioni seems to have
constituted herself the sponsor of Isidore
de Lara's opera, "Molna." After cod
dling the somewhat weird work at Monte
Carlo, and throwing into it all the fire of
her genius, she is about to take it to
the Grand Theater of Triest. Of all pop
ular prima donnas Bellincioni seems the
most willing to give a heping hand to the
aspirations of struggling composers. De
Lara is popular enough as a song writer,
but as an operatic composer he is still
very much in the ranks of the struggling.
The composer of the hour in Paris is
still the young Venezuelan, Reynaldo
Hahn, who wrote the music of "l'lle dv
Rove." One reason for Hahn's standing
with the French critics seems to be that
they can speak of his music as "exot
ique," and in the whole range of adjec
tives there does not appear to be one
that appeals so directly to the French
writer as this word "exotic." To a Par
isian Venezuela is one of the earth's
jumping-off places, so there is a direct
geographical signifieaiton in calling
Hahn's music "exotic."
An incident, rare enough in real life but
pretty frequent in romances, happened

was appearing before Emperor William

the first act of the opera news was
brought her of the sudden death of her
father. Without breaking down in any
way, she sang to the end of the perform
ance, and then sank down, prostrnud
with grief. That is what one might call
theatrical heroism.
Albert Carre of the Opera Comique has
ordered an opera in three acts of the
young and brilliant composer of "lAn
Mil" and "La Xuit de Noel," which
aroused 30 much interest in Paris at the
Colonne concerts and the opera concerts.

THE WORK AFIELD.
Rabbi Voorsanger on the
Necessity for the Red
Cross.
Rabbi Voorsanger lectured last night
at Temple Emmanu-EI on the "Doctrine
of the Sanctity of Human Life." In
touching upon the war issues the Rabbi
spoke of the necessity of sanitary com
missions in the following words:
"Our women have already bestirred
themselves to noble action. They be
lieve in the sanctity of human life. I
touched upon that phase of the ques
tion last week and I did not realize
that my words would be heeded so
soon. Upon woman rests the duty of
minimizing the consequences of war.
Woman is man's strongest support in
all the exigencies of life. Her moral
strength, her patriotism, and endurance
are greater than ours. If man's
strength, her patriotism and endurance
rent, woman's represents the patience
of the dripping stream that in time
cleaves the rock. Nowadays she goes
to the wars as much as the man. The

rel of spirits has made room for medi
caments. The rough speech and ribald
jegt of the camp follower have passed
out of existence and the gentle voice
of the nurse makes better harmony.
The soft hand, the tender touch, the
prompt assistance, the careful nursing
of women, make even grim war less
grim, and though its terrors shall not
cease until the word shall be removed
from the vocabulary of human speech,
we owe it to our women that its con
sequences are less fatal and dangerous.
"The Red Cross service is one of the
most magnificent evidences of the hu
manity of the nineteenth century.
That service will be supplemented here
after by voluntary organizations, com
posed of women, and all men who have
hearts and hands. These organizations,
established all over the country, will
have a two-fold object. The Irst na
turally will be the rendering of active
assistance to the humane service in
the field
"It is absolutely necessary to assist
the Government by the private contri
bution of all articles that will help
to improve the sanitary condition of
camp life and to render, prompt service
to the wounded or to prisoners. Such
humane service, to be sure, has already
an interesting history. Its beginnings
lie in the patriotism, the loyalty and
humanity of women. The century has
seen its growth. Comparatively brief
as is the time that separates us from
Waterloo, yet we have learned differ
ently than to go to balls and parties on
the eve of battle. Since '61 our women
work. They qualify themselves for hos
pital and field service, and those at
home are to provide comforts that fall
nut within the scope of a war depart
ment. That comes first; and next the
absolute necessity of strengthening the
sanitary defenses at home.

of battle. From the camp and the field
of carnage came an enemy that rav
aged the cities of Europe and convert
ed entire communities into graveyards.
That enemy was the chole'a, twin sis
ter to that dreadful scourge of the
South, yellow fever. During the four
years that preceded the Franco-Ger
man war Europe had. learned to pro
tect itself acainst another attack from
that insidious enemy. If we believe in
the sanctity of human life let us benefit
by the experience. At this time and
fur the next few months we will be re
quired to exercise the utmost caution
lest our country be invaded by an ene
j my. disease. We need to build for
! tresses of health on the borders of our
country. We need to put our sanitary
homes in order. I will be among those
who will Issue a call in this direction.
We, who are not required to actively
engage in the coming campaign must,
nevartheless, be imbued with the sense
of ou- responsibility toward our coun
try. We must help it and stand by it.
We can do it most efficiently in the or
ganization of these sanitary commis
sions. It would be an apt illustration
of cur own belief in the sanctity of
nun. an life."
ORGANIZE AT ONCE.
Dr. John Gallwey, an En
thusiastic Champion
of the Red Cross.
Dr. John Gallwey, brigade surgeon of
the sanitary corps of the National
Guard, is enthusiastic about the forma
tion of the Sanitary Commission and a
, Red Cross Society. "It is a grand and
a most humane movement," he said.
"It on the field will relieve war of many
; of its horrors and give great relief to
; many an anxious heart at home. By
all means let it be organized, and the
stronger it is the bettor. Skilled nurses
and many of them will d~ wanted in the
coming battles. I believe the war we
now have upon us will not be ;v matter
of a few weeks, but of months, and it
is well to be prepared. Even it" the war

; proposed Sanitary Commission aro not
I needed no harm will be done. But on
Clara Barton defines the
purposes of the great Red
Cross Society as follows:
"It seeks to do away with
all the barbarities of war in
the treatment of the sick and
wounded, whom it renders
neutral, and not subject to
imprisonment.
"It renders neutral all per
sons on the field and in hos
pitals who attend upon the
sick and wounded. They shall
not be captured.
"Soldiers so badly wound
ed as to be unable to fight
again are returned to their
own lines or to their friends,
and all surgeons and bearers
of the red cross in attendance
upon the wounded on a cap
tured field shall be safely con
ducted bacK to the lines and
given up to their own army.
"The Red Cross requires
that all inhabitants in the vi
cinity where a battle is about
to take place shall be notified
by the generals command
ing both armies, and full pro
tection offered to any house
which will take in wounded
men on either side to be cared
for, thus converting every
house near the scene into a
furnished hospital."
DR. JOHN GALLWEY.
the contrary great good will be accom
plished. If any great amount of money
should be raised that will not be used
in alleviating suffering on the field of
battle there are many hospitals in this
State where it can be used to a good
advantage. By all means organize the
society and let it forever remain in ex
istence, to be ready to be called upon
should there be future need for its
strength."
A STATE SOCIETY.
Every City and Town In
California to Have a Red
Cross League.
A Red Cross society in California is
an assured fact. Governor Budd has
said so, and the surgeons of the Sani
tary Corps of the National Guard have
given their assurances that it is ur
gently needed in view of the impend
ing call of the citizen soldiers to arms.
Every city, town and village in the
State should now prepare to organize
a branch of the movement. Scores of
trained nurses have volunteered their
services and should they go to the front
they will have to be supported. Money
and clothing will be needed for them
and for supplies for the sick, and
wounded. Of course, the army takes
care of its wounded and sick, but the
medical supplies only provide what is
absolutely needed. It does not give the
many delicacies that the sick and in
jured crave. It does not supply the
many comforts that can only come
from the loving ones they left at the
homes they went to the front to fight
for. The Red Cross Society is to sup
ply all that and the organization can
not be too great. As soon as the com
mittee that Governor Budd will call
together agrees on a plan and what
Will be required those interested in the
work will be notified through these col
umns. In the meantime let organiza
tions in every part Â«/f the State be
formed and be ready to respond at the
first call for assistance.
Governor Budd will issue a call for
the meeting of the committee to-day,
and the ladies and gentlemen who have
signified their intention to him to act
will in all probability be called together
on Monday to organize the commission
and a Red Cross society. Surgeon Gen
eral Hopkins of the California Nation
al Guard will have a conference with
the Governor to-day and draft an out
line of what will be urgently needed
by the medical departments of the mi
litia organization in case it is called to
the field, and it will be the first object
of the proposed organization to supply
it. The National Guard as it is now
has the best equipped sanitary corps
of any militia organization in the Uni
ted States; still, it is deficient in many
respects. Colonel Hopkins says twelve
ambulances are required. As many
field surgical cases are needed and a
like number of cases for hospital work
are wanted and wanted badly if the
call to the front comes. Then there will
be needed a quantity of bandages and
surgical dressings, as well as a large
supply of drugs. All that the citizen
soldiers want the surgeon general es
timates will cost about $10,000 to put
them in first-class condition for emer
gencies should they be sent into an ac- i
tion.
Members of the National Guard and
volunteers to defend the flag will come \
from all parts of the State and it is the j
intention of the organizing committee i
to call for organizations in every city, !
town and hamlet in the State for the ;
common cause. Leaders are wanted to j
start the organizations. It is to be a
State affair and if possible a national
one, with the object of co-operating â 
with the medical department of the !
United States army and of placing the '
whole organization under the leader
ship of Miss Clara Barton, who Is fore
most in the work of the Red Cross in j
America.
The people of Benicia stand ready
to assist in the State organization. The
following letter gives a hint of what
the people of that little city are willing ;
to do:
BENICIA, Cal., April 22, 189 S.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
The earnest work of The Call toward the
establishment of sanitary commissions
and Red Cross societies has inspired the
w..men of Benicia until they, too, want
to organize and contribute their help in
alleviating the sufferings of our soldiers,
which will be so terrible if the war, which
=c* ms inevitable, comes upon us.
Will you kindly direct me to the proper
person "to give us instructions as to the
manner of organizing and something of
an outline of the work necessary to be
done Very respectfully
done. Â»Â«n ADD IE M. BILLINGS.
PRAISE THE WORK.
Military Surgeons Busy
Perfecting Plans for
Work in the Field.
Surgeon General W. *E. Hopkins of
the National Guard and Dr. P. J. H.
Farrell of the Sanitary Corps have been
very busy for several days arranging
the details of the field work of the Na
tional Guard Sanitary Corps. They
will have a consultation with the Gov
ernor to-day relative to perfecting ar
rangements. â¢
Dr. Farrell, whose official position
now is that of a captain in the Sanitary
Corps, is an old army surgeon, having
served with the British in the Soudan.
He is familiar with the work of the
Red Cross and is enthusiastic in his
commendation of the work being done
in the matter by The Call. In reference
; to the work of volunteers and the Red
! Cross the doctor said:
"It is impossible to overpraise this
i faithful band of workers. They do a
' service that is inestimable to surgeons
in the field. The ereatest part of their
labor is in the first dressings, which
save a great number of lives and en
j able a number of soldiers to go in th*
i field who would otherwise be lost en
j tirely or greatly disabled.
"Trained nurses are very valuable,
for they can do as well in many cases
as the surgeons. Even the most ordi
nary untrained volunteers can be in
structed in two or three days how to
stop hemorrhages and bandage wounds
in such a way that a number of the
wounded are able to go ahead and fight
without much delay or gTeat incon
venience."
Dr. Farrell says the sanitary and
hospital corps is in pretty good shape
now, and it will be placed on a much
better footing as soon as affairs are
shaped up with the Governor.
A NOBLE FIELD.
Ex-Collector John H. Wise is an en
thusiastic friend of the red cross
movement. Speaking of the subject
yesterday he said:
"I have always admired the work of
those angels of mercy that appear in
places where the aid of the strong and
brave is needed. It is the province of
this society, as I understand its noble
work, to relieve the wounded on the
battle-fields and in the hospitals. The
A Gleam of Humanity Amid the Battle's Slaughter.
DR. OSCAR J. MAYER ON RED CROSS
The French Hospital Surgeon Admires the Societu
and Will Aid the Local Work,
One of the best informed physicians in the city on the work of the Red
Cross is Dr. Oscar J. Mayer of the French Hospital, who wears a badge of
the German branch which he joined at Munich in 1892. Dr. Mayer feels
a keen interest in the work of the society and would gladly close up his
office here and devote his services to the volunteer work until the end of tho
war if he could make proper arrangements. Speaking of The Call's enter
prise yesterday. Dr. Mayer said:
"I have often been asked what my badge means, though it is known tho
world over that a red cross on a flag is the badge of mercy honored by tho
nations of the world ever since the treaty of Geneva. I am delighted to see
The Call take up the work, and I hope its efforts will be crowned with the
greatest success.
"I stand ready to deliver lectures and do all in my p#wer to instruct vol
unteers in the emergency work, so they will know how to carry the wounded
from the field and minister to their wants until complete hospital facilities
are at hand.
"The beautiful feature of the work of the society is that it treats friend
and foe alike, being on the field for the purpose of aiding suffering humanity
regardless of creed or race. In Germany, and some other Governments of
Europe, the funds for this work are raised by lotteries, though lotteries are
prohibited by law except for some such charitable purpose. The movement
here ought to be encouraged in every way possible, so that a well organ
ized band of trained laymen might be of great use to the hospital corps of
the army. The organization of the society reminds me that its founder.
Henri Dunant, who is in needy circumstances, was recently rewarded by tho
Russian Government, which gave him a prize of 5000 rubles.
"You may put me down as willing to do all in my power to aid tho
deserving work of the Red Cross. I think the society should become thor
oughly established here, as in Europe, so everybody would at once know
the meaning of the badge. The society does not limit its work to war alone,
but it aids people in floods and disasters that leave large bodies of people
wounded and destitute."
treaty of Geneva generously allows
them to be exempt from all liability to
harm. It also provides that the houses
and property used by them shall be
free from molestation. I think there is
not anywhere a nobler field for the
patriotic young women of our State
than to show what they will do for
their brothers in the hour of disaster.
The Call deserves the thanks of the
community for what it is doing in this
direction."
A CREDIT TO THE STATE
Dr. W. 1.. Berry, formerly of the Re
ceiving Hospital, is a great friend of
the Red Cross Society, and heartily ap
proves of the work undertaken by The
Call. He will do all in his power to aid
the work of the local society. In refer
ence to the organization he said yester
day:
"Nobody can better understand than
a doctor the value of train?* nurses in
the field. It is a fact th->t laymen can
be taught enough in a few weeks to
render them very vkiUuti.<: on me aeiu.
This -teac^iner rÂ° ri f' Â»Â»â â¢â  th^m ablf to
carry otf the wounded and to minister
to I'hem while they are on the way to
the Dase hospitald. | There is something
in learning how to treat the wounded
at the very start. If the order gets a
good start here it will be a credit to
the State."
WILL DO MUCH GOOD.
Harry N. Morse, the veteran detec
tive, said: "It is a sign of a high civil
ization to minister to the dying and to
help the wounded who fall fighting for
what they believe to be right. It can
not be that any one would object to the
purposes of the great organization
known as the Red Cross Society. You
may say that I am for it and that I
consider that the organization of a
strong corps in this State would reflect
glory on the name of the Golden West
all over the world. Let the good work
go on without interruption. There are
plenty of brave women who will join
the order when they know its benign
purposes and that they are sure to do
a vast amount of good and reflect glory
on themselves and their posterity by
the work."
APPROVES OF A COM
MISSION.
BERKELEY, April 22.â Rev. John
Coyle, pastor of Trinity Methodist Church
of Berkeley, is working to form in Berke
les' an organization similar to the Sani
tary Commission. Next Monday he will
address the students of the Berkeley High
School on the subject, and a meeting of
Berkeley citizens will be called to perfect
such an organization. "There ought to be
such an organization in every prominent
town in the State," he declared, "and
Berkeley ought to be the first to re
spond."
DOCTORS' DAUGHTERS
READY.
SAN FRANCISCO, April 22, 1898.
Editor The Call: The Doctors'
Daughters want a part in the pro*
gramme about to be made for the alle
viation of the sufferings of the soldiers
who have gone to the front.
They place themselves at the dis
posal of the auxiliary to the Red Cross,
trusting that what experience they
have gained and what training they
have had will make them helpful asso
ciates.
The ambulance belonging to the so
cietyâwhich was bought by members
of the Doctors' Daughters, Mrs. Her
man Oeirichs and Miss Virginia Fair
is at present in use at the Receiving
Hospital, otherwise we'd gladly turn it
over to the Sanitary Commission.
For anything that remains in our
power to do we ask that you call upoa

RUSHING OUT GELA
TINE.
Orders for High Explosives
for Coast Mines and
Torpedoes.
There will be plenty of high explo
sives for the mines that will help pro
tect the harbors of the Pacific Coast
and for the big dynamite guns out
near the Golden Gate. Yesterday the
Giant Powder Company began work at
its plant across the bay on a large rush
order for "gelatine" just received from
the Government.
The material is a preparation of
nitro-glycerine of extremely high ex
plosive power, and when prepared for
shipment is in cubes from two to sev
eral inches each way and is packed in
pasteboard boxes. As the stuff is sup
posed to just go- off all at once and rii>
everything in reach when a button ia
pressed for a submarine mine or a tor
pedo, or a dynamite shell strikes the
enemy, it doesn't have to be prepared
with the extreme skill that is required
for smokeless or brown powders for
heavy guns. It is simply a raw high
explosive prepared for heat tests, and
as prepared it can be handled quits
safely. One can safely drive nails in
the tough gelatine chunks. The out
put will be rapidly distributed by the
army officers about the various points
along the coast where mines may be
laid or torpedoes used, and will re
enforce the supply already in the mag
azines. Some of it will doubtless go
into the underground magazines for the
dynamite guns.

Checks.
His Friends Declare That He
Is on the Verge of Senile

FAVORITE AT THE CHUTES.
Several Charges of Felony Likely
to Be Recorded Against Him
To-Day.
James Haley, the "plain comedian." as
the managrr3 of the Chutes, where he was
engaged, designated him, is locked up in
the tanks In the City Prison. He was
arrested last night by Detectives Whit
taker and Reynolds on suspicion of hav
ing passed several forged checks.
Several weeks ago Haley, who is well
known in the East, was engaged to per
form at the Chutes at a princely salary-
He made a decided hit, and was looked
upon as a star attraction.
Recently, it is claimed, he has acted
strangely and his friends, fearing that he
was losing his mind, seriously thought of
having him committed to the Insane
Asylum.
Last night he visited a drug store on
Market and Powell streets, and after in
tr. â duced himself as the "King of Come
dians," a-sked the proprietor to cash a
check for J250.
"I've got money to burn," he remarked,
"'"ash the check and I'll show you that I
am a game sport."
Suspecting that the man was crazy the
druggist refused to have anything to do
with him. A short time afterward he
visited the Columbia Theater and en
deavored to induce Sam Friedlander. who
was In charge at the time, to cash the
check. Friedlander refused to have any
thing to do with him and ordered him to
leave the theater. Subsequently he vis
ited the Orpheum and vainly" tried to
realize on the worthless paper. He claim
ed that he owned real estate on Tchama
street and was worth at least ?.
In the meantime Detectives Whittaker
end Reynolds, who had been apprised of
his actions, were scouring the city for
him. They claim that he hud Imposed
upon several business mfn by inducing
them to cash worthless checks, aftfr r-p
resenting that he had considerable money
In bank. After considerable trouble the
detectives located Haley on Ellis street
and took him into custody.
It is said that several charges of pass-
Ing fictitious checks will be placed against
him to-day.

AGAIN FELL TO
JOE ULLMAN
Second Time the Corrigan
Horse Dumped the
Talent.
Beaten Out Cleverly in the
Mile Event by Ostler
Joe.
Tcrsida Too Fast for Fonsovannah
Potentate Finally Took a
Purse.
Earlier in the meeting. Joe Ullman, the
RUcy gelding in the Corrigan stable, was
supposed to be tramping around in plas
ter of paris casts to hold his bowed ten
dons in place, electric bandages and such
paraphernalia. Of recent date he looms
up as a handicap horse. Yesterday in â¢
the mile purse run at Ingleside, the Cor- j
rigan horse was played down to 7 to 10 '
favoritism to beat Ostler Joe, News
gatherer and Flashlight. He did down [
Xewsgatherer, for that uncertain factor j
covered four furlongs and gracefully re- I
tired. Clayton on I'llman hit the stretch 'â 
in front with confidence sticking out of ;
them both on all corners. Hennessy went i
to work on Ostler Joe, and in a drive j
reached the wire a length before the fav
orite in 1:41%. It was a costly affair to
followers of the green with white sash. :
Favorites again made an even break of
it, taking three purses. Hennessy carried
away the riding honors by piloting two
winners.
After behaving very unladylike at the
post. Sardonic, the favorite for the first
event, got away with a rush, and racing
San Antonio to a standstill the first half
mile, won easing up, covering the seven
furlongs in 1:29 U. Rio Frio, a 150 to 1
chance, was third, five lengths behind San
Antonio.
Shields & Co. furnished the favorite for
the rive and a half furlong sp'nnt which
followed in Potentate. The bay horse
was not in great demand at that, reced
ing in the betting from 6 to 5 to twos.
He overhauled Plumeria in the stretch,
and ridden out at the wire, won by less
than a length from the 20 tj i shot Sten
tor. Plumeria stopped to nothing.
The finish to the five furlong scramble
for 2-year-olds was a very close oue.
Milt Young, the favorite, getting the de
cision from Primavera by a scant mar
gin. Lonnie Clayton rode the winner and
had slightly the best of Ames when it
came to a drive. Mossbrae, the second
choice, with Plggott up, was a good third.
The mile run. fourth on the card, was
declared off ;ir.d a cheap affair at five
and a half furlongs for maidens substi
tuted. When the odds were posted
Tempse was quickly played down from
fours to even money, but later receded
to 3 to 1. Joe Levy went to the post a
mild 13 to 5 favorite. In a drive Piggott
landed Tempse first, hnlf a length .ahead
of Texarkana. with the favorite third.
"Daggie" Smith's good mare Torsida
opened favorite for the final six furlong
run, but the crowd preferred Fonsovan
nah, and she receded to 2 to l. The lat
ter was first as the head of the stretch
was reached, but at this point Thorpe
shook Torsida up. and assuming the lead,
the mare won easily. In a drive Fon
sovannah beat Glorian a neck for the
place.

this end two entertainments will bo
given, one on Tuesday, May 3, and one on

Theater.
The entertainment of May 3 will con
sist of patriotic songs and "drills by the
children of the parish Sunday-schools
where the C. L. A. S. branches are lo
cated. This entertainment is under the
direction and management of Miss Char
lotte E. Johnston, a very earnest worker
in the work of the society. The entertain
ment of May 4 consists of a dramatic
performance under the management and
direction of Leo Cooper and will cer
tainly provide a pleasant and enjoyable
evening's entertainment. Tickets are for
sale at the rooms of the society, 75 Maze
building, and by the members of the so
ciety.

FIGHTERS ARE
LEAVING TOWN
Are Not Enlisting but Are
Looking for Fistic
Engagements.
Billy Otts and Jack Granfield
Matched by the Excelsior
Athletic Club.
Report of the Lavigne-Daly Six-
Round Go by Rounds â O.her
Gossip.
With the exception of the Jeffries-Shar
key bout, there is very little doing in
pugilistic circles these days. This may
account for the many desertions to the
East of exponents of the manly art. Fol
lowing In the wake of Choynski, Dal
Hawkins left for New York last week in
the hope of taking on some of the lead
ers in his class, and on Monday next
George Green, the clever welterweight,
will go north. Young; Jimmy Lawler has
also become imbued v.ith a desire to
travel, and has declared his purpose of
going East if he succeeds in defeating
Conway.
Green, in company with Frank Foster,
the clever all-round athlete, will visit
faeattle, where a fistic exhibition is be
ing arranged for the former's benefit.
Green will then journey to Vancouver,
meeting all comers, and will, within a
few months, cross to England, where he
expects to be matched with Ted Pritch
ard. As the National and Birmingham
clubs have already spoken for the en
pajj..ment, there is no doubt it will take
place. In the event of its falling through,
Green is confident he will be matched
against some leading man there, as he
has a strong friend in Manager John S.
Barries of the Birmingham Club.
Paddy Smith, the hard-hitting brother
of '-Denver" Ed, who defeated Green in
Chicago some years ago. with Billy
Shannon of this city, reached town the
first of the week looking for engage
ments. He is not averse to meeting
'Spider" Kelly, and as the latter is
'willin' " there Is a likelihood they may
be matched.
Kelly is willing to fight Lon Agnew any
number of rounds for a side bet of $iou<i.
Agnew stated last week that Sharkey
gave him the worst of the deal in their
last go, and he believed himself capable
of putting the "Spider" hors dv combat.
Manager Groom of the National Club
scouts the story that Sharkey injured his
back while fooling with a bale of hay.
He says there might be .some truth in
his swallowing the balf. as from reports
the Sailor is working like a Trojan and
eating his head off.
A championship featherweight tourna
ment is the next event to be pulled off
by the popular San Francisco Athletic
Club. It will be held on the evenine of
May 3, and the following clever young
sters are already in training for the
tournament: William Quinn, William
Murnane, James D. Ellis, James Kenny,
J. P. Tiret, James McCarthy, Dick Con
don, John Dean, George Savage, Jack
Grantield, John Owens, Charles Dixon,
Frank Schuler and John McMahon.
Billy Otts, the clever little representa
tive of the Excelsior Athletic Club, will
take on Jack Granfield, the pride of the
San Francisco Athletic Club, on Friday
evening, April 29. The Excelsior Athletic
Club has arranged the bout and will have
other specialties on the evening of the
go. Granville and Otts are both two
handed fighters, with science enough to
please the most seasoned ring-goer. The
boys will weigh in at 130 pounds, and will
compete for a valuable trophy.
As very meager telegraphic reports
were received in this citj* of the Daly-
Lavigne battle last week, The Call pub
lishes a report of the fight by rounds.
Although the laws of Philadelphia do not
permit a decision being given, the opin
ions of those who witnessed the exciting
contest were divided as to who had the
best of it. The main question to be de
cided was, whether the Kid's body blows
or Daly's constant tattoo on Lavigne's
face did the most execution. Following
is the report of the fight by rounds:
First roundâ Xo time was lost sparring for
an opening. Both men led. landed lefts, ami
then clinched. Lavigne again used his left
hard. Then Daly got in his work In the shape
of a right-hand uppercut, almost flooring La
vigne. Lavigne stopped an uppercut. A mx
up followed, both exchanging rights and lefts.
Lavlgne led with left and Daly countered wth
the left on Jaw, followed it up with another In
the same place. Lavigne got in two left-hand
leads as they brokf away.
Second roundâ Daly opened with a light left
on face and then put a left on jaw. Just be
fore a clinch Daly got in a right-hand upper
<ut. Now ensued a -groat deal of one arm
punching In a clinch, which had been agreed
upon by the iru-n. Daly sent his left to the
jaw and Lavigne returned on the body. Daly
poked another on the Kid's jaw and Lavigne
put a hard one on the kidneys. Daly return
ed light, and then came a rapid exchange.
Lavigne got in a tremendous body blow and
Daly winced. The Kid followed this up with
a blow on the neck.
Third roundâ Daly opened with a blow on the
face, Lavigne returned on the neck, and then
placed the right on the jaw. Lavigne landed
left on the body and Daly returned with the
right, following it up with a terrific right
and left on the jaw, staggering Lavigne. The
latter was very wild. Lavigne landed on the
wind, and Daly got in two right-hand swings
on the head. Lavigne placed a heavy left on
the neck.
Fourth roundâ Lavigne looked wicked as he
came up. and before the round was finished
almost had the Wilmington delegate on the
road to defeat. After a clinch, and after both
had landed blows on the neck. Lavigne put a
hard right on the face and left on the jaw.
He followed this up with a left body blow.
The Kid again got in a terrific body punch, so
hard that he almost fell from the effort. Both
men exchanged blows, but Daly had the better
of it. Both landed on the jaw as the round
closed.
Fifth roundâ This round was without feature
and slightly in Daly's favor.
Sixth roundâ Daly opened with the left on
the face and a mix-up ensued, both men being
very wild. Daly planted right and left swings
on the face and right and left In clinch. LÂ»a
vigne appeared very tired. Daly followed his
man up and landed two face blows. Then he
uppercut the Kid, and It seemed as though the
latter would surely be knocked out. Daly fol
lowed this up with right and left. Then La
vlgne sÂ°t in a very hard jab on the neck.
Daly got home a hard one on the jaw as they
clinched. Daly fell short in a wild swing,
and the Kid landed at about half speed on
Jack's chest, when the gong sounded.

OLYMPIC MEMBERS
FOOLED AGAIN
Mexican. Pete Surprised Only
Those Who Did Not
Know.
Jeffries Had a Nice Picnic and Referee
Wand Saved a
Life.
The Call was not far off the mark -when
it said that Mexican Pete, the "cham
pion" of Montana, was a "dub" of the
worst kind imaginable, and that the
Olympic Club showed very rank judg
ment when it matched him against Jeff
riesâa powerful man who has already
proven his ability as a prize-fighter.
But this is not the first time the club
has disappointed its members, who last
evening left the big gymnasium thor
oughly disgusted with the show and the
men who are selected by themselves as
the club's fighting match-makers.
Poor old Peter Jackson should never
have been signed to fight Jeffries. There
is not another club in Amcita that would
have been guilty of making such a stapid
blunder.
But tae Olympic's able-bodied match
makers, not satisfied with the ridicule
they had been subjected to after the Jack
son-Jeffries farce, actually fell into an
other mud hole when they signed Jeffries
and Mexican Pete for a twenty-round
hippodrome. (How thankful Jeffries must
be. too.)
The match-makers had seen Pete "tried
out" bofore he was booked for the big
game, and they expressed an opinion that
he was a "coming man" and would give
his big opponent "a hard argument."
Well, he did in a way, but not just ex
actly as the men who paid $3 had ex
pected.
The man from Montana gave up all hope
of life when he had a good look at his op
ponent in fighting rig.
An account of the fight cannot be given
for the very good reason that there was
no fight to report.
Pete sheltered his dark-skinned face
with his gloves each time Jeffries made
an attempt to land, and although spun
about like a top from cuffs and pushes
the Mfxican kept hia face and neck al
ways guarded.
In the third round Jeffries determined
to knook the spots out of Pete's guard
under instructions from Captain Delanoy
and a couple of stiff punches on r
arms soon lowered the members. Then
one or two cuffs under the ear Bent the
alleged fighter from the chilly north to
the carpet. , .
Pete managed to get up in an awkward
way. and as Jeffries had settled blmuell
to deliver a knockout blow the humane
referee. Phil Wand, stepped bet we. -v the
pugilist and the dub and ordered the con
testants to their respective corners, mi --r
which good act he awarded the bloody
tattle to Jeffries. . , , .
The members and the very few misled !
people who paid $3 to witness the club s
fistic "treat" withdrew from' the gym
nasium, disgusted and vowing that it
would be the last "fight" they would
witness under the present administration
of pugilistic matchmakers.
The preliminaries were fairly good.
"Kid" McFadden. a bright-haired lad j
from the San Francisco Athletic Club, put
up a good stiff light against Fred May
nard, but the latter was the cleverer ;
hitter and boxer. Referee Joe Reay called
the ten-round bout a draw. Jimmy Law
lor had lots of fun punching Charles Con
way, the "Wooden Man," for ten rounds,
and although Conway stood a good gruel- ,
ling, he was unable to return punishment,
and Referee Wand gave the match to ,
Lawlor. which was a good decision. But
the members of the Olympic Club will
have occasion to remember for many
moons the Jackson-Jeffries and the Mexi
can Pete-Jeffries peek-a-boo fights.
SHARKEY STILL SUFFERS.
His Physicians Will Not Be
Able to Give a Definite Opin
ion Until Monday.
Tommy McDonald. Sharkey's manager,
arrived from Vallejo last evening and
stated that Sharkey is still suffering from
the severe strain received while attempt
ing to lift a bale of hay a few days ago.
Drs. Anderson and Hogan, who are at
tending the fighter, will not be able to
give a definite opinion as to whetner or
not their patient will be able to go
ahead with his match on May 6 until next
Monday, as he seems to be recovering
slcwlv
It Tom has recovered sufficiently to go
on with his training by that time he will
finish his work at the Seal Rock House,
where two extra trainers, F. McGraith
and Joe Kennedy, will assist Jim Casey
and Henry Baker. If the fight is nut
pulled off at the date formerly fixed it is
probable it will be postponed for some
time, as the pavilion has been rented for
weeks to come.

The resignation of Treasurer Widher
â was presented to the Board of Supervi
sors yesterday, and was accepted by that
body. The position thus made vacant
EX-CITY TREASURER CHRISTIAN REIS
k{ a Meeting of the Board of Supervisors Called for
This Morning Mr. Reis Will Probably Be Elected
to Fill the Vacancy Caused by the Resignation
of Treasurer A, C, Widber,
will probably be filled this morning by
the appointment of Christian Reis to
fcerve for the unexpired term.
Widber's resignation was the result of
a suggestion made to him that he could,
by voluntarily surrendering his author
ity, save the city and the authorities
much inconvenience and unnecessary
tmuble and delay. Under the provisions
of the consolidation act It becomes the
duty of the Mayor, Auditor and one Su
perior Court Judge, when for any reason
the Treasurer shall nave been charged
with a violation of the law. to immediate
ly name a temporary Treasurer, who
Bhall perform the duties of the office un
til such a time as the charges against
the Treasurer are disposed of in a proper
court of justice. The act further pro
- that the temporary Treasurer shall
provide a good and sufficient bond for the
proper discharge of his duties.
In view of the fact that Widber had
confessed his crime and thereby left no
doubt as to the outcome of the criminal
proceedings that have been begun against
him, the appointment of a temporary
Treasurer, which would inevitably be fol
lowed by the naming of a permanent
Treasurer, appeared to be an unnecessary
formality, particularly as it would in
volve a double delay in the preparation of
bonds. To overcome this difficulty it was
decided to present the matter to Widber
and suggest that he solve the difficulty
by handing in his resignation. Widber's
resignation would leave the office vacant
and thus permit the Board of Supervisors
to achieve the ultimate at once by ap
pointing his sucer:?sor.
When the matter was presented to
Widber he expressed a willingness to sim
plify by any means within his power the
tangle into which he had thrown the
city's finances. At noon his resignation
â was filed with the clerk of the Board of
Supervisors.
Mayor Pholan called a special meeting
of the board for 4 o'clock. At that hour
tho Mayor called the board to order, after
making a brief address, in which he out
lined the object of the meeting nnd the
circumstances that made immediate ac
tion necessary. There were present Su
pervisors Devany, , Haskins, Sheehan,
Lackman, Rottanzi, Morton, Britt, Smith
and Rivers.
Smith moved that the matter of accept
ing Wldber'B resignation be laid over un-
II the next meeting for the reason that
there hail been, so ho believed, contribu
tory nc-giigence on the part of others be-
Bldes widber, and he would like to see
the whole subject Investigated. Britt con
tended that the resignation should be ac
cepted at once, as the city's business was
fcolr.g blocked by the enforced closing of
the Treasurer's office. The motion to de
fer action was lost. The question of the
acceptance of the resignation was then
put and was carried, there being but one
dissenting vote. Nominations being in or
der Britt took thÂ« floor and presented the
name of Christian Reis. He dwelt briefly
on the fact that Reis. having served two
terms as Treasurer, not only had the con
fidence of the people but was prepared by
past experience to take up the duties cf
tho office at a moment's notice. The nom
ination was seconded by Haskins and
Rottanzi. Smith, on behalf of the Repub
lican minority, nominated Henry S. Mar
tin. The roll was then called. Lackman,
Morton, and Smith voting for Martin,
and Devany. Haskins. Sheehan, Rottanzi,
Britt and Rivers casting their ballots for
Reis. As it requires a majority vote of
the entire board to elect, and as there
was no prospect of securing the attend
ance of the absentees, an adjournment
was taken until 10 o'clock this morning.
As the three remaining members of the
board are Democrats there is no doubt
that their votes will be cast for Reis.
The work of counting the money in the
treasury vaults was continued all day
yesterday, and will probably be completed
to-day. Yesterday's count disclosed no
further shortages, and it Is now believed
that the full amount of Widber's steal
ings is represented by the sum named
Bday. $114,199 so.
Roth the Surety Company and the city
euthorities are leaving no stone unturned
to protect themselves against loss by rea
son of the Treasurer's defalcation. Yes
terday the city fled an attachment for
>IC.OOO against Widber's ten-acre fruit
farm at Mountain View. At the same
time the Surety Company placed a keeper
on Widber's l-aneh at Walnut Creek and
filed an attachment against all of his per
sonal property In that county. The ranch
is mortgaged "for $5000 in favor of Timothy
A. Spaulding.
Widber now occupies a cell at the Coun
ty Jail. Yesterday morning he was booked
at the City Prison on a charge of felony
embezzlement and was then turned over
to Sheriff "Whelan. He was taken at once
to the County Jail, where he will be kept
pending the result of his trial. No time
has yet been fixed for his preliminary ar
raignment, as the District Attorney has
not vet assigned the case. It is under
stood that the trial will be had before
Superior Judge Cook.
WHERE WOMEN BET.
Property Owners Combine Against
the Gambling Evil.
The Merchants' Association, which has
set about to rid Sun Francisco of the
pool-selling evil, is meeting with every
encouragement from the owners of houses
where these parasites have fastened their
fangs upon the community.
An example of the demoralizing effects
can be daily scon on Mason street, be
tween Eddy and Turk, where a poolroom
is located. Here the "mudhens," that at
one time became a nuisance about the
stock boards, are daily seen sitting on
the doorsteps of the adjoining buildings
waiting for the "shop" to open, into
which they dump their dollars and cents.
To enter the filthy rooms is too much
for them, consequently they squat on the
doorsteps and in hallways, sending their
money in to be placed on their favorite
mustang. Fleel footed scouts carry the
results of the winners and losers out to
the old cronies, when a consultation is
had upon the next possible winner. This
Can I" 1 witni ssed every afternoon
on The block mentioned.
The assurance given the Merchants'
Association is in the following language,
and speaks well fur the association's co
operation with the better element of our
citizens:
The Merchants' Association Is daily receiving
from property-owners nn.l agents assur
ing their supp r! of the movement to rid the
: and conveying the Inf
tlon that they have or will at \ such
tenants of their building* to close their pool
or vacate the premises. As was sup
. the great majority of property-owners
were not aware that their property was beins
used for such purposes, and upon learning the
fart promptly notified their agents to close
the rooms.
If the poolrooms move to other localities they
will be followed up and the property-owners
requested to elope them. The real estate
agfnts are heartily in favor of the movement,
and if they will all aexrc, when renting prop
erty, tc make it a condition of the lease that
no portion of it la to be used for selling pools
on races the poolroom? Brill soon be closed.

CAMPING RESORTS EN

The First of a Series of Popular Ex
cursions Under the Auspices of
the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
A DELIGHTFUL DAY'S OUTING
AT VERY LITTLE COST.
Several years agro the Southern Pa
cific Company inaugurated a series of
cheap excursion trips into the heart of
the Santa Cruz Mountains which were
extensively patronized and probably
did more to bring into public notice
the beauties and attractions of that
romantic region than any other agency
ever employed.
The result has been that numerous
delightful camping: resorts have been
established, notably those at Wrights,
Glenwood, Zuyante, Felton, Ben Lomond
and Boulder Creek, where people of
moderate means congregate by the
hundreds and enjoy to their hearts'
content the delightful surroundings af
forded by this mountain region, at a
minimum cost for travel and expense
at living, where the climatic conditions
are unsurpassed and the finest of fish
ing, hunting and boating can be en
joyed.
We are advised by the general pas
senger department of the Southern Pa
cific Company that the date fixed for
the first campers' excursion train of
the present season is Saturday, the 30th
Inst., and that the rate for the round
trip from San Francisco to Boulder
Creek or any of the intermediate
camping resorts has been placed at the
very low figure of $1 25.
A first-class train service will be pro
vided and excursionists will be com
fortably seated in upholstered cars.
This and subsequent excursions will
be personally co-pducted and under
the immediate charge of Colonel Wil
liam H. Menton, the popular excursion
passenger agent of the company, who
has been identified and favorably
known in connection with this charac
ter of business for many years. Ex
cursionists can therefore depend upon
being well cared for.

THE ANNUAL FIELD MEET,
Intercollegiate CliampionsliiD Games at tlie Olympic
Grounds To-Day.
THERE are two days which to the students of California universities stand out pre-eminent above all others-
Thanksgiving dayâ when brawn and strength engage in muscular battle on the gridiron, and a late day in APj" 11 '
when the representatives of both California and Stanford meet on the cinder track for championship honors. This
afternoon at the 01-mpic Club grounds the annual championship field day will draw the students from Palo Alto
and their friends, all flaunting the color that makes bulls mad, and the adherents to the cause of the Blue and Gold
colored and bedecked with the insignia that know no defeat- on the cinder path and no victory on the football field.
Five times have Stanford and California tested their mettle on the athletic field. Out of all these annual con
flicts Stanford's banners are not graced with a single victory. Two years ago when California was bathing in a balm
of anticipated and assured superiority the cardinal heaved out of the deep and the score was tied. This is the only
unction that Stanford has ever laid to its soul in this branch of athletics. There is hope, to-day that the cardinal
may flaunt its terrifying badge over the dead bodies of Its ancient rivals, but it is a hope born of despair and un
alloyed determination. Too much self-assurance and a noli me tangere belief in one's own ability have been the cause
of the undoing of many men and many things. Stanford has worked quietly and unassumingly, shirking nothing and
utilizing every moment to develop a team which will at least satisfy its followers, should it fall to glorify the stand
ards which they bear. There is always a certain air of mystery about the athletic conditions at Palo Alto, and sur
prises often occur for the very reason that people foreign to the university axe very often in a cloud when judging
of the athletic strength of any Stanford ..earn.
On Monday night the composite Berkeley student Jaw dropped several, lnches, but since then it has been raised to
its normal level by the use of a derrick of supreme confidence. Ben Bakewell, the hurdler and high Jumper, in the
last practice of the year, was unfortunate enough to twist his ankle, and now it is very doubtful if he will enter
In any of his events. Bakewell is a remarkable hurdler. At the last annual championship games of the University of
California Bakewell covered the high sticks in sixteen seconds, a phenomenal performance, considering the slowness
of the Berkeley track. He Is also a high jumper of rare ability. In the 120-yard hurdles he was to meet Morgan,
and on this event college students have been rather free with their money, unconscious of that unforeseen power of
chance and accident, and the results of their operation on the genus homo. A whole year of waiting has been en
dured by both Morgan and Bakewell and now there may be no meeting after all. If Bakewell is sufficiently strong
to enter he will do so, but it is not likely that he will run at his best under any circumstances.
Stanford has suffered also, and that by the illness of Dole, foremost among the all-round athletes of the coast.
Dole, pole-vaulter. broad-Jumper, hurdler and high-Jumper, has been seriously handicapped in his training. Contradic
tory stories concerning Dole emanate from the Palo Alto quarters. 5 According to some reports Dole is not himself,
that he is in no shape to undergo the severe trials of an intercollegiate contest: but others will have it that the lugub
rious Dole is physically perfection itself, that he will run the low hurdles fast enough to take the breath away from
the blue and gold men. and that he will skim the bar at six feet in the high jump. To-day will tell the tale.
The following is the order of the events: First and. second heats of the 100-yard dash, mile run. first and second
heats of the 120-yard hurdles, final of the 100-yard dash, mile walk, final of the 120-yard hurdles 220-yard dash
half mile run. first and second heats of the 220-yard hurdles, 440-yard dash, final of the 220-yard hurdles. Field
events- High Jump, shot put, pole vault, broad Jump and hammer throw. The bicycle race has been decided already,
California scoring five points to Stanford's four. The scoring will be five points for first place, three for second and
The resultant noise of Juvenile altercation will be heard In town Saturday morning when the respective merits
of Drum and Brunton are argued. Drum did force Brunton to swallow a series of bitter pills in the three sprints
last year. The question is now will he do it again. Brunton may not be trained to the edge as he was obliged to
quit college for a few weeks in' the heart of the season, but he is certainly out for keeps at present. He may not enter
the 440 but he is very likely to do so. The 100-yard race is what the Stanford men are gambling on. Brunton has no
better 'record in this event than Drum, and he does not possess the stamina of the Berkeleyan. In all the races Drum
has ever run heJias shown the biggest amount of heart. His finishing is his strongest point, and If he is pushed
hard the most hotly contested sprint race ever seen on this coast may be expected this afternoon at the Olympic
Club grounds. The 100 belongs either to Drum or Brunton. but in the 220 and 440 Drum has a shade the better of it.
For third places in these races California will run Woolsey, and Stanford. Birch.
The long distance events will show some pretty work of the crafty kind. The mile run comes before the half-mile,
and this may induce Carrol of California to husband his strength for the latter event, since his particular forte lies
in that distance. Stanford has a man in this event who may give Carrol, with his record of two minutes a disjoint
ing jostle and upset calculation. Walker has covered the distance in 2:03. In actual contest and .with a moving
mark as an index for greater development of speed he may cut some of this down. The mile without Carrol will He
between Smith of Stanford and Tolman of California, unless Jackson surprises the talent. This should also be a
hotly contested event wlthout Bake well will lose a great portion of interest. Should he not run in the high sticks.
Morgan will undoubtedly score five points for the red. Second and third places will be fought out by Dawson of Cali
fornia and Culver of Stanford, with the chances in favor of the blue and gold. The 220 hurdles were a toss between
Dole and Bakewell Again, counting Bakewell out. second and third places will lie between Woolsey and Morgan.
In this case "Woolsey of California will stay out of the 440 to run the hurdles. , . ; â¢ '. .
The last field event the mile walk, offers some good guessing. Walsh of California with some of the best records
made by Western college men has been wrestling with a virulent malaria, and Is not in the best shape. He should
win however despite the assaults of sickness. Lousley, Stanford's new walker, is an unknown Quantity, and just
such a. one as knocks calculations about the heads of the wise ones. WesUrfeld of California, who last year tied
Adams of Stanford for first place, having walked five laps without a shoe and the cinders buried In his foot, is out
for a place. On the other side, to prevent him from doing so, are Lousley and Adams.
Two of the field events look a little as if they were wrapped around with a cardinal blanket. The high Jump
and the pole vault will probably go to the redoubtable Dole, with second In both events for California. Dozier will
enter the high lump, and with Hoffman will tussle for second and third places. The broad jump should go to
Brouehton California- Dole Stanford, second; Brunton. Stanford, or Dozier, California, third. The weights present an
other question. Wool'sey. Gulberson and Fickert promise to come Inside the money In the shot-put. In the hammer
throw Fickert, Guiberson and Greisberg should be the winners.

STRUGGLE FOR
A LITTLE GIRL
The McCalveys Each Have
Great Love for a
Daughter.
Miss Nettie Meyers Wants to Meet
the Politician's
Wife.
Mrs. McCalvey. wife of â  George . McCal
vey the politician, anticipates a lively
fight over the posse of their four
year-old girl. For several days she has
not taken it out of the house and at
times she has been informed of circum
stances which she considered justified her
in having an officer guard the approach
to the house where she is now living, all
Through her attorney Mrs. McCalvey
has received several notes requesting a
meeting from Miss Nettie Meyers of San
Francisco. Miss Meyers is the woAan
named in Mrs. McCalvey's complaint as
being partly responsible for the estrange
ment between her and her husband.
When the first of these notes was re
ceived Mrs. McCalvey took it to her at
torney and was advised to reply to tin.
effect that she would meet Miss Meyers
at her attorney's office. Miss Meyers de
clined this offer, saying that their meet
ing must be distinctly private, with no
third party present.
More recently a note was received re
questing Mrs. McCalvey to meet Miss
Meyers in the City Hall Park between
noon and 2p. m. Mrs. McCalvey was
advised not to go to the park, but a de
tective who was sent there reported that
Miss Meyers was on time and remained
there till the time set had expired. Mis.
McCalvey and her attorney. Ben Wool
ner are entirely at a loss to conceive
what Miss Meyers can have to ssty at
the desired meeting that could not be
said in the presence of Mrs. McCalvey's
A few nights ago it waa reported to
Mf McCalvey that her husband and
Mi=s Meyers were in this city and that
they would attempt to get possession of
the little girl. Mrs. McCalvey says that
for several hours that evening a hack
stood near Jefferson Park, in the vi
cinity of which she Is now residing, and
she was convinced that it was to be
used for conveying' away the little girl
should the opportunity be presented.
There is no doubt that Mr. McCalvey
has a very pronounced affection for his
child and "will leave no stone unturned
to obtain possession of her. He has
stated that he Is prepared to look afteÂ»
the little one's best interests, and there
is not any reason to doubt that in this
respect he will keep his word. The little
girl is a beautiful child about five years
old. and were it not for her the divorce
proceeding's would certainly be speedlly
rushed through. At the present time the
little girl is kept confined in the house,
her mother being afraid to take her on
the street.
CLANCY TOOK THEM IN.
A Joke That Was Turned on the
Perpetrators.
Some one evidently put up a job on T.
L. Clancy of 137 Ninth street yesterday,
and as a result the gentleman is well
nigh overworked by answering questions
and attending to business at the same
time. Mr. Clancy is the popular secretary
of Division No. 2, A. O. H. Some of his
friends who like a joke spread among the
members of the order the news that he
was organizing an Irish regiment to go
to the front in the present crisis.
The first that Clancy knew of the mat
ter was when a squad of eight stalwart
Hibernians applied and demanded enroll
ment. He thought It a josh until a score
of others had rolled in by 10 o'clock, and
I then, in self-defense, he put out a roll,
and by 6 o'clock in the evening there were
295 names registered.
The subject of the joke belonged to
Company F of the First Regiment, N. G.
I C.. when the railroad strikes were on a
few years ago. He was court-martialed
for killing an innocent pig while he (not
the pig) was on guard duty. The judge
advocate pronounced the accused guilty
as charged, and there waa no appeal.
Sent to Prison for Life.
Kamikichi Tauchi, the Japanese who
shot and killed Mary Costillia on Decem
ber 26 last and was found guilty of mur
der in the second degree by a lenient
jury, was sentenced by Judge Wallace
yesterday to life Imprisonment in the
State penitentiary at Folsom. Tauchi,
who had been llvingr with the woman,
killed her while in a jealous mood.
Died on the Ferry.
Minnie Joe, an Indian girl 14 years old,
died suddenly yesterday on the ferry
steamer Uklah while on the way from
Salem, Or., to the Round "Valley Indian
Reservation in Mendoclno County. The
girl was far gone in consumption and
was in charge of Mrs. Adair, a nurse.
The body was taken to the Morgue in
this city, but the Coroner has waived an
Inquest.
WOMAN'S FATE.
From the Record, Bushneil, 111.
No woman is better able to speak to
others regarding "woman's fate" than
Mrs. Jacob Weaver of Bushnell, 111., wife
of ex-City Marshal Weaver. She has en
tirely recovered from the Illness which
kept her bedfast much of the time for
five or six years past, and says her re
covery is due to that well-known remedy.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.
Mrs. Weaver Is 56 years old and has
lived In Bushnell nearly thirty years.
She Is of unquestioned veracity and un
blemished reputation. The story of her
recovery is Interesting. She says:
"I suffered for five or six years with
the trouble that comes to women at this
time of my life: I was much weakened,
was unable much of the time to do my
own work, and suffered beyond my power
to describe. I was downhearted and
melancholy.
"I took many different medicines. In
fact I took medicine all the time, but
nothing seemed to do me any good.
"I read about Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
for Pnle People, and some of my friends
recommended them highly. I made up
my mind to try
them. I bought
ie first box In
March. 1897, and
as benefited from
he start.
"A box and a
alf cured me
ompletely, and I
am now rugged
nd strong. I have
ot been bothered
!th my troubles
nee I began tak
ng the pills.
"I have recom
mended the pills to many women who
are suffering as I suffered. They are the
only thing that helped me in the trial
that comes to so many women at my
age."' MRS. J. H. WEAVER.
Subscribed and sworn to before me
this 23d day of October, A. D. 1897.
O. C. HICKS, Notary Public.
When woman is passing beyond the age
of motherhood it is a crisis in her life.
Then, if ever, proper attention to hygiene
should be exercised. The attendant suffer
ings will disappear and buoyant health
will follow if Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are
used. â¢.;
These pills exert a powerful Influence
In restoring the system to its proper con
dition. They contain In a condensed form
all the elements necessary to give new
life and richness to the blood.

orated with flags while daylight lasts, and

7:50 p. m.. and from Sausalito at mid
night. On Sunday there will be boat racea
and BWimmlng races, after which the
yachts of the San Francisco fleet will get
under way to escort visiting yachts home
ward. Invitations to be present at the
opening festivities have been issued to all
the yacht clubs on the bay, and it is ex
pected that there will be many visitors.
The Pacific Yacht Club will open the
season at the clubhouse and grounds,
SausaJito, on Saturday, May 7. All yacht
owners are expected to dress their craft,
anchor them off the club grounds and be
prepared to receive guests on board.

lito or the president, commodore or secre
tary in San- Francisco not iui.tr than iviay

will leave the Mission-street wharf at i
p. m. and will return to the city at 11
p. m. Officers and members of all the
yacht clubs on the bay will be welcomed
at the clubhouse on May 7, and will be ad
mitted during the- afternoon and evening
on presentation of their membership
cards.
The Corinthians are busily engaged in
getting ready for their opÂ«.-. <>-
30. The yacht-owners are scraping, paint
ing, varnishing and putting their craft
into readiness for the coming season.
While some of the yachts are ready,
many will not be in sailing trim until the
end of the month. The Thetis and K. It.
l'Hommedieu's Phoenicia came over to
Tlburon last Sunday from Oakland Creek,
where they lay during the winter. The
Phoenicia will remain at Tiburon during
the season, and has taken her old moor-
Ing there. Commodore Carl Westerfeld's
Aeolus baa come off Stone's ways at Tib
uron, and will attend the opening of the
San Francisco Yacht Club, as. also will
the Elia, Frank Bartlett's Queen and pos
eibly the Freda. Ex-Commodore J. W.
Pew's Truant is on Stone's ways, the
Nixie having come off. P. W. Hurndall
has been elected a member of the Corin
thian Yacht Club. Engelbrecht is having
a new boat, about twenty-rive feet over
all, with a weighted keel, built for him !
by the San Francisco Launch Company.
The jinks committee is working hard
to make the opening entertainment on
opening night successful. A rehearsal of
the singers was held on Monday, and of !
the farce on Thursday. For the cruise in i
squadron on May 1 it is proposed to dec- â 
orate the yachts with flags, according .to :
a practice common among British yachts- !
men. Secretary E. B. Lathrop, after an
absence of a month from sickness, has j
returned to business.
The Encinal Yacht Club, at its opening i
night on May 14. will give a vaudeville i
entertainment for members of the club
and their families. Some first-class ama
teur talent, both vocal and instrumental,
has been secured. Some stereopticon
views will also be shown. Yankes or
chestra has been engaged, and proceed- j
ings will probably be wound up with a j
dance. Next day there will be a cruise i
in squadron. General invitations have
been Issued to the commodore and owners '
of the other yacht clubs to be present at j
the opening and join in the cruise.
The club is on a prosperous footing and
expects to get many new members. The 'â 
directors are active, and the clubhouse
is well attended, the bowling-alley and 'â¢
billiard-tables being much used. Though i
not many of the yachts are yet in com- !
mission, it is expected that all will be \
ready for the opening cruise on May 15.

tinuous demands of Empire Gun Club members
for more practice shooting has necessitated the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 23, 1898.
OUTCURVES AND
SHOOTS
FROM THE TRACK.
Nothing Is heard nowadays of the
Horsemen's Protective Association. It
caused a big hubbub for a day or so, but
now no granite shaft murks Its resting
place, and on Decoration day kind hands
strewing flowers will forget that it ever
had a real existence. It was the cher
ished scheme of a disgruntled Eastern
trainer, who thought to throttle the
pens of criticizing scribes. It blossomed
In the morn, and nightfall witnessed Us
decease. But it was strange that out in
this far Western country how certain
horsemen became instantly infatuated
with its bylaws and issues. It must not
be construed by this that all who signed
its membership roll wereâ but some.
When spoken to in regard to the inside
working's of the organization the press
was always mentioned prominently as
something that ought to be attended to,
as it were. Horses are not pieces of ma
chinery. This every one knows. The
honest owner, always out for the long
end of the purse, is never criticized, even
though his horses do train off. A bunch
of losing pool tickets are mute testimo
nials to this fact. One day a stake horse
and another day a "dog." though, will
bring down the wrath of the populace in
any country.
What a pity it is California is not pos
sessed of" a racing institution with the
standing and caliber of the Washington
Park Association of Chicago. When it
was recently announced through the col
umns of the press that there would be a
period of racing at Washington Park this
coming summer the face of every visit
ing horseman, bookmaker, jockey, tout,
hustler, roustabout and hobo was
wreathed in smiles. It is the mecca of
all Western turfmen. There the juice is
not squeezed from the orange and the
peel tossed to the ownersâ they derive all
the benefit. Eight hundred dollar purses
and $1000 handicaps are what make Wash
ington Park popular. Triere is where you
get a run for your money, turf followers
say. On the conditions of the races can
be read "a fair field and no favor," some
thing that cannot be said of our own
game, where the "magnates" of either
track head the list of winning owners.
It is quite evident that every now and
then officials in the stand overlook the
fact that the public are entitled to some
protection, as well as private individuals,
whether they are race track owners or
not. On Wednesday of the present week
Henry Shields, with leg up on the pro
nounced favorite, Olinthus, a brother to
Diggs, won the Schrelber stake at Ingle
side for two-year-olds. Any sane indi
vidual with eyes not HlTlicted with astig
matism could see that a well defined ef
fort was made to defea.t the favorite by
shutting him off. Taking a desperate
chance, Shields got through next the
rail, and at the finish won easily. In
making his aggressive move Shields was
compelled to tap one rider lightly with
his whip, when hanging half over the
fence. Of course this does not make
pretty racing, but when one's life is in
danger he should protect himself with
the most available means. For this
breach of turf etiquette the rider of
Olinthus was suspended for the balance
of the week. No attention was paid to the
rowdy tactics of the other riders, calling
to one another, "There he comes on the
inside," "Shut him off," and such like.
"Oh, no," they were qldlng for good peo
ple. And this sort of thing will even
tually work the ruin of California racing.
If racing is a rich man's game, it should
be so advertised. If all are welcome to
participate, then all should be treated
alike. Surely the wealthy do not pay
their dollar at the gate. For the most
part, people in possession of money and
position pass through the gates on com
plimentary badges. The middle and
poorer classes support the sport, and for
that reason the poor owner with two
horses should have an equal say with the
owner of a string of twenty. If a firm

year, when stale and over-trained, he was
defeated by Dr. C. C. Dennis, but he has
now a good rest, has gone up in weight

Two crews have been, made ups.to try
conclusions with the Turn Verein crew.
Last Sunday they had a trial spin with
the senior crew and held their -own.
Though comparatively new men, they are
thorough athletes and quick at learning.
An: order for a new racing barge will
probably be given about May 1, but the
boat will not be completed for three or
four months, . bo that it will not be in
time for the regattas early in the season.

it is no more to them than the man with
! meager capital putting his all in the busi-
I ness. "Why should not both take a chance
I alike? If the horses of the former turn
out badly he can buy more; if the latter
loses his stable through mishap he is
"broke." But the sport is not conducted
on that scale, nevertheless.
The former admirers of the crack col
ored rider Lonnle Clayton are disappoint
ed. They cay Lonnie rides with a rein
that was entirely foreign during his
palmy days, displays a lack of vigor in
his finishes, and, it wonikl seem, displeases I
them altogether. The colored chap and i
the master of Hawthorne will hardly get
along well if this be the case.
Jack Reilly of "Jack Tips" fame, it may
surprise many to know, was in his youth
a very handy exercise lad, though he
never sported silk in an actual race. All
old-timers will remember the mare
Monita Hardy, which carried away many i
a purse for "Jim" Brown of Texas, the
turfman killed in Chicago in the eighties.
Jack broke and galloped the mare.
Jockey Spencer came out of the recent
turf Investigation with a laundried shirt
on .and a red necktie, and is now on his \
way East to ride for the Thompsons and
Jimmy Rowe. Spencer is a promising
rider, and if he eats plenty of Tobasco

Johnson and Jones. Possibly Spencer oc- I
cupied the sliding seat Fro:n all ac- i
counts. Spencer told no funny stories
about the bookmakers, but through some, i
hook or crook was reinstated. Although i
no absolute proof was produced that !
Jones pulled horses, he appears deeper In \
the mire than ever. Johnson, if he careVi,
could furnish the public with a chapter of i
very newsy reading regarding bookmak
ers and others, but he prefers to preserve
silence. Perhaps it is better that he does, j
A glance at the steeplechase record at
Ingleeide will show that California
Jumpers did not fare very well, for out of j
about seventeen hurdle and steeplechase
affairs horses owned by Eastern owners ;
topped off eleven of them. There are no
good jumpers in this section of the coun
try, and asking boys to ride the "Uppers" j
we have is only requesting them to take :
a chance on losing their lives. The course
at the local track is a severe one. and
horses of the "crab" species will not do.
Now that some of the selling events j
have a soft aspect, native owners with
any sort of a fair horse are afraid to
make an entry. If a good plater does :
show up it is dollars to a red apple that |
one of the visiting Eastern owners about i
getting ready to depart will gobble him j
up. Eastern owners come out here and j
expect they are entitled to everything '<
In sight, and the managers of the' track i
appear to take the same view. So do the
judges. If a California owner goes to
one of the Middle Western tracks and
grows too talkative he is thrown out of
the gate. That is just the difference.

COURSING DOGS
ARE AFTER
GOLDEN STAKES.
The coursing at both parks to-day and
to-morrow embraces the largest number
of candidates ever run at one time in the
history of the sport on this coast.
The stakes are identical as to class, an
all-age, open event and a sapling feature
being scheduled at both Ingleside and
Union parks. At Union Park sixty-eight
performers will contest for the coin and
at Ingleside the aggregation of long- tails
includes no less than seventy-two of the
clean-limbed flyers. There will be hot
sport among the leashmen before the last
flag goes up to-morrow night. The run
ning at both parks commences at the
usual hour, with the sapling stake in the
slips.
Many improvements have been made at
Ingleside during the week that will add I
to the sport appreciably. The field has ;
been thoroughly raked and softened. The j
slight knoll at the easterly end has been
leveled down, and the dogs will hereafter I
be slipped from the southeasterly corner.
The running will be thus brought almost \
directly in front of the grand stand.
There will be several performers from 'â¢
Sacramento at Union Park to-day. It
may be that they will land within the
money line, but they will hardly reach
the top.
The all-age stake at Ingleside to-day
embraces some of the best stock that
ever flew over grass. The Initial course '
is between the great Mialmo and Sinaloa.
Connemara is also in the game; so is Pa- I
tria, Mystic Maid, Susie. Log Boy, Glad- !
iator, Firenzl, Seminole, Glenroy and i
many other top notchers.
Mountain Beauty and White Chief
should do some good work at Union Park
this week. None of the Santa Clara
<racks is in this week and the stake I
practically belongs to almost any per
former.
The seventy-two dogs at Ingleside this
week means an unusual amount of
sport. The all-age event with fifty-two
candidates will include two byes and the
sapling event a like number.
The candidates best liked at Ingleside
to-day are as follows: All-age stake â
Mialmo, Lady Blanche, Koolawn, Lady
Hopp, Pet Kirby. Myrtle, Mystic Maid.
Fireball, Glenchloe, Firenzi, Patria, Move
On, Gladiator, Bend Along, Seminole,
Connemara, Nelly B, vigilant, Forget,
Lurllne, Susie, Signal, Log Boy, Her
cules, Right Bower and Senorita.
Sapling stakeâ Heather Dell, Steam B,
Liberty, Rathbone, Thad Stevens, Match
less, Morning Glory, Marietta, Revolver
and Young America.
The winners at I'nion Park this after
noon should be as follows: All-age stake
âMetallic, Pretender, Eclipse, Sylvia
Van Nida, Firm Friend, St. Alecia, "Mys
tery, Little Dottie, Decorator, Royal
Buck, Jimmy Hope, Rocklin Belle, Ca
milla, Flying Buck, I Wonder, Grazer,
Black Patti, Miramonte, Alma, Hattie
M, Douglass, Tod Sloan, Mountain
Beauty. White Chief, Joy Bells, Obediah
and Terrona. â¢
Sapling stakeâ Rest Assured, Motto,
Petronius, Lalla Rookh, Royal Flush
and Flush.
The Call was very successful in its se
lections last Saturday and Sunday at
both of the parks, and those who played
the tips returned home happy.
Of course there will always be an oc
casional course which will destroy the
best laid plans of mice or men. Some
times a very poor hare will be liberated
in front of a brace of dogs, and by a poor
slip or through some unfortunate occur
rence the better dog in all respects is
thrown out. But with good hares, good
slipping and good judging, the fanciers
who keep a good line on the dogs can al
ways count upon success in betting.
Coursing is an honest and decidedly
pleasant pastime when it is conducted in
a straightforward manner, and The Call
takes pleasure In being able to state that
there is ample room for two coursing
parks within easy distance of the city
so long as the managers of the demesnes
will continue as they are now doing to
keep the sport from pollution and above
the finger of suspicion.
crew of the Alameda Boat Club, and Paul
Sturdevant of the Olympic Club visited
the South End club house on Sunday and
were given seats in one of the barge
crews. Dan Connelly, Tom Barry and
Emil Somps visited the club house and
were much pleased with the improve
ments.
The delegates of the Alameda Boat Club
to the Pacific Amateur Athletic Associa
tion are S. J. Pembroke, W. B. Hinchman

The Alameda Boat Club will hold its
club regatta on Sunday. April 24. There
will be scrub races and a straightaway
race against time in the new barge, also
a race in outrigged skiffs for club uni
forms.
The preliminary heats already held by
the Dolphin Swimming and Boating Club
for the A. B. Treadwell medal for junior
skiffs have been declared off, C. M. Far
rell having refused to claim victory in a
race in which his opponent's chance was
extinguished by his boat being capsized.
The medal will be contested for on May
BABY TROUT
OF THE
PAPER MILL.
There certainly should be a State law
against the capture of baby trout. This
season the streams are so low and clear
that many anglers who whip flies as a
means of capturing trout are depleting
the creeks of their little fishes.
Last Saturday and Sunday, and in fact
during the past week, hundreds of baby
trout were taken from Paper-mill Creek.
One man who could not understand Eng
lish was seen near Tocaloma with half
a basket of trout the largest of which
did not measure five inches; in fact, the
greater number of fishes he had in his
possession were under four inches in !
length.
It is not any wonder, then, that coast
streams are quickly depleted of the j
finny inhabitants when so-called anglers
are allowed by law to take and kill trout
that are not even fit for table use; but ]
until an anglers' club is formed the de
struction of baby fishes will continue and
the sport will become annually worse.
Last Friday week the men who are in
charge of the Olema hatchery drew a
net through the White House pool at
Point Reyes, thereby destroying the sport
which anglers enjoyed up to that time.
The netters failed to capture any large
steelheads, as the big fellows which were
recuperating in the deep pool had taken
their departure for the ocean during the
warm wave which visited us a few weeks
ago. But the net alarmed the small trout,
many of which immediately departed for
the ocean.
The hatchery men should at least show
some respect for the angling fraternity
and leave network for trout alone after
the angling season opened. There is,
however, tairly good fishing to be had
at the Point for those who understand
the art of fly-casting, but the bait fish
ermen might just as well remain at home
until next winter.
Mr. Monroe of Fortirha is on a visit
to this city. He states that anglers are
having gala sport on Eel River catching
small steelheads by means of fly-cast
ing.
W. E. Brooks, the dentist, has hit upon
a new idea in the way of arranging a
spinner, which he guarantees will prove
death to large trout. Anglers who have
whipped the Brook spinner contend that
it is all that the maker claims for it.
Harry McMurchy and Phil Beckart re
cently returned from the north fork of
Eoi River. Among the large numbers of
small trout the sportsmen brought to
creel during their stay on the river, they
state positively that they had a 37-inch
"cutthroat" that weighed 14Vz pounds; a
32-inch steelhead that weighed 9^i pounds;
a 31-inch "Eastern brook" trout that
weighed IOV2 pounds, and a "California
brook" trout that scaled 7*u pounds.
The fact of the matter is that all of the
fishes caught were steelheads. It is
doubtful if the gentlemen can tell the
difference between a cutthroat trout and
a rainbow trout, notwithstanding that
they may be experts at the trap.
An excursion under the management of
J. E. Locke will run on Sunday from this
city to Cazadero and return; $1 50 for the
rouml trip. The train will meet the 8
o'clock a. m. boat at Sausalito.

A reader of The Call sends in the fol
lowing interesting communication to thi3
column regarding the trip to Spanishtown
as given in a local paper last Sunday:
CITY, April 21, 18a8.
To the Cycling Editor of The Callâ Dear Sfr:
One of your contemporaries started a pretty
good idea last Sunday, stating that it had es
tablished a touring department, to give par
ticulars' of rides around San Francisco, with
maps, etc. "The mafis will be more accurato
than any in existence," says your contempor
ary, and then publishes its first map, which
in plac*^ is so inaccurate that a stranger would
be hopelessly lost if he tried to follow it. This
map was evidently drawn irom some old map,
and could never have been very correct. Thera
is no excuse for this, as an up-to-date and cor
rect map of most of the ground covered can
now be had for a cents from the United State*
Geological Survey. In the newspaper map en
closed the number and positions of the Spring
Valley lakes are all wronn, as you will see
from a rough tracing of the United States map
also enclosed.
I would also make the following criticisms
on the description of the trip to Spanishtown:
Firstâ The place mentioned as Baden is gen
erally known as South San Francisco.
Secondâ A large part of the road from Six-
Mile Hill to San Mateo is not excellent going
at present, being nearly impassable between
San Bruno and Millbrae. owing to the laying
of new pipes, and at all times it is indifferent.
Thirdâ At Uncle Tom's you keep straight on.
the main road, aa the road to San Andreas
turns out at right angles.
Fourthâ For the dam across Lake San An
dreas, five miles away, read: "Causeway acroeÂ»

A. C. MCHOLS $ CO.DID PRESIDENT DOLE
PAY NEWSPAPER MEN
HERE FOR HIS BOOM?
(From Honolulu Independent, April 13.) /
President Ooi? was sent to Washington by the Council of State to further the scheme of annexation. The coun- J
cil violated its authority by appropriating $10,000 for the trip. The opposition to the republic and to annexation said <
nothing, knowing that the appearance of Mr. Dole in Washington at that moment would materially help in the efforts (
of defeating the annexation scheme. . (

cidentals, J227C Â«{: total. M 762 75, leaving a balance which has been placed to the credit of the Government.
More than $2000 was paid for Incidentals. As a matter of fact, are not expenditures included in this amount, <â¢
which would nÂ« ver be tolerated by the taxpayers? Is it not true that Mr. Dole paid $500 to certain newspapers in (
Ban Francisco to "boom" him. Walter G. Smith of the San Francisco Chronicle probably knows more about that (
dial than the legislators who simply say "yes and amen" to everything Mr. Dole does. The taxpayers who have to (
pay $7000 for Mr. Dole's trip want to see every voucher for every expenditure of the President during his junketing
lition. The people have become somewhat suspicious. They did not intend to pay for the trip of the wife of (
Mr. Dole, nor did they authorize him to give a donation on their behalf to the Maine sufferers and allow him to take <
the credit for the irift. c

al ('"rrospondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, April 14.â The evening
military annexation organ Btartled the
town for an hour nr two this afternoon
with the announcement that the Ameri
can flap was to be hoisted over Hawaii
trow morning, and gave as its in
mt "apparently highest authority."
lurse there was not the slightest
lation of truth in the Btatement. The
.! correspondent Immediately inter-
I President Dole, and also ascer
tained from Minister Sewall that no such
â  a contemplated, nor was it
contemplated except the Instructions and
conditions to be received on the lath re
quired forcible annexation. They both
regarded the announcement as absurd
and mischievous.
All who have the pleasure of the ac
of Admiral Miller know how
vi ry discreet a naval commander he is
â  :.i he is in the expres
sion of an opinton relative to the deli
tiited States to
.:i. Imagine, then, the surprise of
the community when an evening journal,
accredited with being the semi-official au
tomaton of the administration here, pub
lished the following:
Admiral Miller said yesterday afternoon that
he was in Honolulu for the purpose of annex
ing the islands to the United States. The re
mark was made voluntarily and without re
bt-rv to a Government official. At his town
residence the Admiral was asked what he
thought of the Cuban situation. This he de
clined to discuss, but a moment later added:
â¢My. chief concern Is right here. I am here
to annex the Sandwich Islands, and will not
leave until that Is acomjiHened."
The annexationists were jubilant and
expected to see the stars and stripes
raised at once, but the "antis" regarded
the statement as a hoax. The admiral
declined to take any notice of the pub
lication locally, except to emphatically
deny its truth to a personal friend who
desired him to make a public statement.
To The Call correspondent, when shown
the article, the admiral said: "You may,
if you will, say that Admiral Miller an
solutely declined to speak on that sud
ject. "He wilt not even deny its truth.
He will discuss with you on any other
topic you may please, but on this and
his otiicial duties here he will remain
silent. To that extent and no further
please state that."
When it was suggested to him that the
absence of an emphatic denial, such as
It was understood he had made to an in
fluential friend, might give an opportun
ity to those who were not aware of his
habitual caution in conversation on Ha
waiian matters, to exert a prejudicial ef
fect, he pleasantly replied: "1 must take
that risk; 1 cannot discuss the matter."
The Call correspondent is Informed that
the basis for the alleged statement of
the admiral was a conversation in which
he is alleged to have eald that the clim
ate of Honolulu did not suit him as well
as that of other places, it being too hot,
but that he was here to annex Hawaii
when the circumstances justified it, and
he was ordered to do so, and the sooner
that was done the better be would feel
pleased, personally, so that he could go
to a cooler place. And yet the admiral's
most intimate friends, even over the hos
pitable board, fail to remember even thÂ«,
approachment to such Indiscretion.
Another sensational incident occurred
yesterday in the Legislature, when the
Minister of Finance presented the fol
lowing statement of expenses incurred in
President Dole's lobbying journey to
Washington. It will be seen that $0763 15
were expended out of the Council of
State's appropriation of $10,000.

Hotel bills Sl6 66
Entertainment 847 20
Maine relief fund &00 00
Incidentals 2,276 &0
. ' 16,763 15
One item in that account has brought
deep humiliation on the community and
has given rise to angry and unpleasant
comment. It has been generally accepted
by all here, as well as probably in the
United States, that the donation of $500
was a personal gift from President Dole
to the Maine disaster relief fund. The
discovery that this was really an unau
thorized and plcayunish Rift from the
taxpayers of Hawaii, under an uninten
tional semblance of false pretenses, while
there was a balance of over $3000 unex
pended, hurts our pride and afflicts our
sympathies. Had the President given $2500
in our name we would have indorsed his
action right heartily. As it is, friend and
foe alike are belaboring him with cudgels
of contumely. A demand for details of
the expense* has been made.
There was still another incident in the
Senate yesterday which may lead to an
other conflict With the administration. It
arose out of the registry of vessels bill.
Senator Waterhouse presented the follow- j
ing resolution, which was adopted:
Resolved, That the Minister of Foreign Af
fairs be requested to furnUh for the use of the
Senate copies of any and all correspondence
had between the covernniPntH of the United
States and Hawaii on the subject of the regis
tration of foreign vessels under the Hawaiian
flag.
A brief explanation is necessary to un
derstand the motive of this resolution. In
the very high-handed and dictatorial
manner in which Minister Cooper has
sought to thrust his bill down the throats
or the legislators "In ten days" he has
Invariably claimed that he is merely fol

A very serious charge of malfeasance
by neglect has been brought against the ]
administration of the republic, and one
rwhieh may lead to very costly litigation
through the executive's neglect. Genera]
Alfred S. Hartwell, the attorney for the I
Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Com
pany, has brought the matter to the no
tice of the Government in the case of the i
extension of the landing in Kahului har
bor. One of the acts of tne Monarchical
Legislature of ISS2 was to pass a very im
portant bill, which had been discussed for
some years, requiring the Minister of the '
Interior "to prepare a schedule of all
landings in the kinngdom and to ascertain
the title 01 the Government to the same
and the easements and rights of way
therein vested in the public," and further
as soon ns the schedule of landings in
which the rights of the public are not
disputed is reaay, the said . minister shall
publish such schedule in the English and
Hawaiian languages; and shall, from time
to time, publish the names of the land
ings and easements which shall have
been determined by the courts to be vest
ed in the public."
Owing to the Government being too
much Interested in annexation, revolu
tions, establishing an armed force in the j
time of peace and administering strong ;

Ignored, and as Is customary in such
cases tho people and not individuals or
corporations will be the losers.
John I,ota Kaulokou, the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, has been at
death's door with pneumonia, and is even
now in a somewhat critical condition.
Many Hawaiians regard it as a curious
coincidence of fatality that he should
have been struck down with an almost
fatal illness immediately after his ex
traordinary vote against the measure in- |
creasing the number of representatives.
The I ntted States ship Mohican has had
n severe spell of measles on board, but
there have been no casualties, and condi
tions have improved. As this is a very
deadly disease among Hawaiians the
greatest precautions of quarantine were
takt-n to prevent i.ie disease being
lr.u;ght ashore, and no land cases have
been reported.

BANDIT BOOTY
NOT RECOVERED
Vain Search for the Mail That
Was Stolen at Oro
Grande.
Report at San Eernardino That Train-
Robber Jones' Wound Has
Proved Fatal.
Special Dlppatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, April 22.â Dis- I
trict Attorney Daley is on the desert
looking up evidence against the Oro
Grande train-robbers. Although about \
forty-five registered parcels were car- I
ried off by the robber who fled when
Jones was killed, and who is believed
to be Bennington, not even a scrap of
paper has been recovered. Circum
stances indicate that the robber re
ceived outside aid. When the posse
made a blind by starting for Victor, as |
though giving up the search in Oro |
Grande, it was absent only a short j
time, but when it returned Benningrton
had been home, changed his clothes
and gone to town, two and a half mi'.es j
away, and given himself up to a friend, i
in order that the friend might get a '
reward. The general belief is that oth- |
ers implicated had him in hiding; hence!
the arrest of Chilson and Casner, the j
latter owning the saloon in which Ben- !
nington was found.
A telegram from Oro Grande this
evening says that both of the horses
and Jones' clothes were found oppo
site the scene of the hold-up and two
miles from town. One horse was tied.
Near by, hidden in the brush, was
found Jones' every-day clo-thes. hen
shot he had on a shirt, blue overalls,
a black, coat and a hat as a disguise.
Both men had evidently thus disguised
their clothes, as trainmen said after
seeing Bennington in Jail that he an
swered their recollection of the ap
pearance of the second robber except
a* to apparel.
After changing: clothes the robbers
rode to the place where they expected
to hold up the train, and then walked
to Oro Grande and boarded the over
land. When Jones was shot, Benning
ton got the horses, went to the hiding
place, got his clothes, and tied Jones'
horse and turned his own loose, it be
ing found in a pasture five miles away.
Where he spent the day and secreted
the registered mail is yet a mystery.
It is now probable that the examina
tion of the robbers will not be held
here. The recent escape of a Federal
prisoner â A. M. Williams, the black
mailerâfrom the county jail prejudices
the authorities against the officers
here, and Commissioner Cnle will
transfer the cases to Los Angeles. That
is the reason all the suspects were tak
en to Los Angeles last night. Chilson,
Casner and Bennington claim they can
prove an alibi and exonerate them
selves when the time comes. No other
warrants have been issued to-day.
It is reported here to-night that Jones
has died from the effects of his wounds.

FLOCKING IN
Over Eleven Hundred Are
Landed in Hawaii by-
One Steamer.
Facts to Show Annexation
Will Not Remedy the
Labor Problem.
President Dole Believes That the
Islands Must Be Uncle Sam's
Ally During the War.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, April 14.â Eleven hun
dred and seventy-six Japanese entered
the port of. Honolulu yesterday to work
as contract laborers on plantations.
Surely that As rather a startling num
ber for Hawaii to receive in one day.
Of this number 576 were brought by the
steamer Braemar and 600 by the Rio
Janeiro. They equal in number just
double Hawaii's civil and military
forces, and out of this horde only one
tifth are women. And still they are
coming, but the white laborers are not
in spite of the contract of the planta
tion managers to import a certain per
centage of white labor In proportion to
the coolies brought here.
Moreover, the penal contract labor law,
which was introduced merely to eatcli
annexation votes In Congress, is practi
cally pigeonholed In the Legislature, for
it has llie strenuous opposition of wealth
and influence, both social and political,
and is doomed.
In the face of the untruthful statements
of the subsidized annexation press, The
Call Is doing excellent service In calling
the attention of America's workingmen
to these Tacts. Let them remember that
annexation will not remedy the labor
problem in Hawaii. It will only remove
the responsibilities, with their opportuni
tleafot indirectly and illegitimately amass
ing wealth, from the Dole Government to
that constructed by Congress, and to be
compostd, probably, of strangers to the
necessities and conditions of the country,
and of men who will eventually be guided
very materially by plantation influence.
The news of imminent or impending war
Is received here with intense interest,
and there are two factions, even in the
cabinet, in the consideration of the duty
of the Hawaiian Government in the
event of war being declared. It Is gen
erally understood that President Dole
holds that as the Hawaiian Senate has
practically ceded Hawaii to the United
States he must be guided by the advice
of the United States Government, through
Its resident Minister, in his actions, and
that he must not issue the customary
neutrality proclamation. He appears to
consider that we have, in our dealings
â with the United States, become her ally
offensive and defensive, and lost our sov
ereign rights as an independent State
This is probably Lorrin A. Thurston's
mandatory advice.
They who demand, in the event of war
the issuing of a proclamation of neutral
ity, pointed out how defenseless we are
even at the present moment, with only
the U. S. S. Bennington and Mohican *ih
port, in the event of an inimical fleet
attacking us. We have no fortifications
and only a few hundred of armed men
but worse than all we are not a food pro
ducing country. Our supplies are almost
entirely drawn from abroad. An effective
blockade would practically starve us out
within six or eight months. The horrors
of war would be supplemented, as in
Cuba, by the ravages of starvation. Of
course, we all feel until the war bi^ins
that the god of battle would never per
mit the American forces to meet with
even a temporary reverse, and that -with
the rapidity of the lightning's flash the
Hawaiian Islands would be promptly sur
rounded (on paper) by an invincible
I.nited States naval force and springing
up mysteriously like Cadmean teeth"
As the Cabinet has not decided upon
any action, and is waiting for news we
also must await their decision.
The coaling of the United States war
vessels at this port Is an interesting
question. It is noticed that seriously ex
aggerated statements have appeared in
the American newspapers as to the quan
tity on hand. There Is enough for a
few months to supply the wants of our
local inter-island marine and our trans
pacific steamers, and a small quantity
belonging to the United States Govern
ment, but no one can correctly say that
there is a large surplus over our require
ments. The Call's correspondent has heen
furnished with an estimate which is ap
proximate, but not quite accurate. That
gives the figure at 12,000 tons, all told
in the country. There are three vessels
on the way with about 3500 tons, but they
may not reach here. It Is secretly under
stood thaf at least one large firm has
entered into a conditional contract to
supply the United States all that it con
trolsâabout 3000 tonsâ but even that
amount, in conjunction with the quanti
ties disposable of by others, will not be
sufficient to make this a reliable coaling
depot for a fleet In active service until
the supply is greatly increased.
BURIED UNDER TONS
OF CAVING EARTH.
Death of a Workman Employed on
the Fortifications at Lime
Point.
SAUSALTTO, April 22.â Michael Morri-
Bey, a workman employed on the forti
fications at Lime Point, met an awful
death at about 11 a. m. to-day, being
buried under ten tons of earth. The
workmen were all engaged in making an
excavation for a powder magazine when
tha accident occurred, and Morrlsey stood
near the side of the excavation, which at
that time was about twelve feet in depth.
The whole wall fell on him. With all
possible dispatch his associates shoveled
the earth away and reached the lifeless
body in about thirty minutes. It was
removed to Sausallto and in the after
noon an autopsy was held by Deputy
Coroner Pryor. The Jury returned a
verdict of accidental death. Dr. H. J.
Crumpton made an examination of the
body and discovered that death was in
stantaneous, the spinal, column having
been broken and internal Injuries re
ceived.
Morrisey was a native of Irci tnd, aged
25 years, and lived at 917 Broadway, Oak
land.

by Cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usuaity
flr^t aj-pÂ»nr on t v .p Washington -oast. When
the pressure is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north

probable. With a "hish" in the vic.nlty of

opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April When New York
operators In securities got down to Wall street
this morning they found cable reports ir,m
London indicating a somewhat feverish ac
tivity in the speculation In Americans, with a
tendency to rebound from yesterday's depres
sion. Cable inquiries from the other side In
dicated an eager anxiety there to know what
tack Wall street would take. This was suffi
cient to admonish the bears who sold In yes
terday afternoon's slump to cover their con
tracts. The covering of the shorts was coupled
with some buying for London account. The re
sult was very sharp advances all around. This
advance was almost lost at one time during
the morning, but in the late afternoon the
buying was renewed, carrying prices to the
highest of the day, wth only a slight reaction
at the close. The net result shows rather more
than half of yesterday's losses retrieved. . The
market was highly speculative all day, and
the favorite stocks wore the highly volatile
specialties, such as Tobacco, which was exceed
ingly erratic all day, and very active, and
Sugar. In the railroad list the grangers and
the Internationals led In the trading. "
The conditions In the world's money markets
nad a salient effect on the security market. The
mainspring of the money market's action' was
th.* increased demand of banks in the interior
for funds, Chicago exchange on New York
rising to par. This had the effect of relax
ing the New York demand on London for gold
and l^lon consequence no gold . was engaged
There was a curious story current in Wall
street that some of the operators in Am.Ti-
Â» a nn J tocks h .T' b " en buying Spanish O3nd<4 as
a hedge on the theory that if Americans went
down the Spanish bonds would go up. as In
the case of a Spanish naval victory. It the
.exacted event of early American suocess. ib^.
profit on Americans, It was argued, would
more than wipe out the loss on the Spanish
bonds.
The bond market was not as active as that

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. . Til 22â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here opened flat to-day on war con
ditions, and then recovered on coverine by th*
boars and a certain amount of genuine buy
ing here and from Paris. Spanish fours and
Americans led in the recovery, but both closed
ur â¢' -â â  the best. As Indicated in previous dis
patches the condition of the London markets
favors stagnation rather than heavy selling,
as a result of the war. but on the other hand
no Immediate material recovery Ib now ex
pected, but instead a gradual dwindling of
prices.
Gold is in leÂ«s demand for New York at 77s
10\d, but eagles left the Bank of England to
da--. The Paris "*-urse was distinctly better
on the London lead, but the financial outlook
there is gloomy. Whether France will assist
Slain financially Is much discussed.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 22.-An excited Liverpool
wheat market, with the May future there up
equal to about 4Vie a bushel, started this
market to-day on a momentary rampage.' The
actual. inauguration of warlike measures look
ing to the reduction of Havana was the im
pelling cause of the excitement at Liverpool
and the opening burst of buying enthusiasm
here. The elements of an excited bulge in
Chicago were lacking, however; the heavy lo
cal short sellers had covered on the previous
day's advance and on the opening advance of
%Â«J%c In July they were ready to put out fresh
shorts. The first trades in July were over a
range of from S9%c to 90c, most of the tradÂ»
at the lower figures, and only a very few
succeeded In getting Me. The decline that fol
lowed carried the price down to K*<c but that
proved the rallying point for a fresh advance

side the night before accepted. The demand
from country millers for No. "northern
spring wheat was urgent at 2c over the price
raid here yesterday, but Lelter's broker in

wheat at Liverpool closed 2d higher for Cali

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, April 22.â G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The war is no longer to be avoided, and busi
ness is somewhat contracted by bankers' ap
prehensions. There Is no excuse except nerv
ousness for declines in railway stocks when
earnings have â  been â  14.3 per ; cent . larger than
last year for the first half of April and 4.8
per cent larger than 1892, with railway ton
nage ' east ' bound ? rcm â  Chicago about 10 per
_cent larger than â¢ lb.a Neither ore clearing- ,
house transactions gloomy. The -week's pay
ments were 33.6 per cent larger than lust year,
and 6.3 per cent larger than 1892.'
In no aspect can the wheat market be con
sidered without flndlnc . just occasion for a
material advance In prices, which has been
7.26 per cent for the week. The exports from
the Atlantic Coast ports have been 3.104.309
bushels (Hour Included), against 1,190,392 last
year, and from Pacific Coast points 436,086
bushels, ngainst 63,230 last ' year, making for
the three weeks of April 5.35y,432 bushels from
Atlantic ports, against 3,588,170 bushels last
year, and from Pacific ports 2,529,628 bushels,
against 712, for the same weeks last year.
The exports of corn during the same three
weeks have been 11,340,188 bushels, against 10,
221,161 bushel* last year, which is strong evi
dence that the demand for wheat Is in no
sense fictitious. With 40,000 tor.s Bessemer
Iron sold at Pittsburg for $10 40, and with deal
ings in gray forge unchanged, and sales of 30,
000 tons to car wheel makers alone at Chicago
and 10,000 tons at Eastern works of Pennsyl
vania, with some at the South for pipe manu
facturers, the enormous production does not
diminish and the demand for finished products
Includes contracts for 3000 tons in the build
ing of two merchant ships, with many rthercon
tracts In sight to replace vessels bought by the
Government: for two new piers at Key west,
5000 tons; for the Chicago Postoffice, 9000 tons;
for the Harrisburg capitol, 2800 tons: for car
building, including one of 3000 tons at Pitts
burg; one for a Government building at Port
land. Or.. 1000 tons; for track elevation at
Chicago. 2700 tons; for plates at Chicago, in
cluding one for 2000 tons; for 40.000 tons rails
to the Maryland Steel Company, 30,i.vK) to be
shipped to Siberia and 10,000 to the Orient,
and for 7000 tons to a Pittsburg concern for
Quito, with many structural and Implement
contracts of minor importance. No decrease In
prices appears and the production continues
practically unchanged at the highest point
ever known, although in Eastern markets the
output is considered somewhat, In excess of
supply. Copper Is stronger, with heavy de
mand for consumption. In woolens the heavy
cancellations . recently reported prove to be
in large measure requests for deferred deliv
eries, but a better demand has been seen dur
ing the past week In some quarters, on account
of large Government orders.
Failures for the week have been 204 In the
United States, against 218 last year, and 29 In
Canada, against 21 last year.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, April 22.~Bradstreet\s to-mor
row will say: General trade and speculation
this week have exhibited most of the charac
teristics which have become popularly asso
ciated with the near approach of hostilities.
While there Is reported a further quieting of
dlPtrlbutlve trade In some lines at the East
and South, traceable almost directly to antici
pated warlike conditions, there Is a lack of
regularity, even In the reports from those cen
ters which serve to show that, now that the
uncertainty so long prevailing has been dis
pelled, trnde conditions are being shaped to
the new order of things. There is consequent
ly greater Increased activity In many special
lines at the seaboard, accompanied by excited
markets a:id heavy price advances. While
trade In the Interior sympathizes to a certain
extent with this price movement, there Is still
a perceptibly pood trade reported entirely out
(>lde of this, which serves to prove that the
prospect of wu.r has not had nearly as much
rffp.-t Inland ag it had on the coast.
In commercial lines this week much interest
and activity baa he.. n manifested In the specu
lative and actual demand for leading staples,
such as wheat, corn, oats. Hour, coffee, sugar,
most pork products and cotton. A reflection
of this active demand, which had its rise, M>
far as wheat and cotton are roncemed, among
foreign buyers, who wish to anticipate any
possible tnterruptlon of supplies Is found In
the movement of pries, which for the first
time for many weeks past shows a general up
ward tendency.
The advance in coffee, susar and rice are di
rectly traceable to war Influences, marking,
as they do, either a desire on the part of the
domestic buyers to protect themselves against
any possible Interruption of supplies or the
anticipated levy of taxes to meet the in
creased outlays of the Government. Careful
search among the quotations for staple pro
ducts falls to reveal any Important declines in
prices outside of a fractional marking down
of steel billets at some markets.
The check to export trade at some ports,
notably at the South. Is reflected In tem
porarily smaller shipments of wheat, corn
and flour. The total shipments of wheat (flour
Included) this week aggregate 3.223,106 bush
els, against 4, 525, 302 bushels last week; 1,654,-
C$S bushels In this week a year affo; 1 2^o 006
bushels in 1S?6: 2.431.000 bushels In ISM, and' 2,
717,000 bushels In 1594.
There were 224 business failures in the
I'nited States this week, against HS last week:
216 in this week a year ago; 240 in 1596, and 22!
in 1895.
nusinr>ss failures In Canada for the week
number IS against 27 last week; 22 In this
week a year ago; 37 In 1896, and 32 in 1895.
FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, April 22.â Bradstreefs Re
view to-morrow will say: Hradatreet's has
for some time past not hesitated to point
out the unfavorable effects of the prevailing
uncertainty as -to our foreign relations upon
the general business of the country. There haa
been some disposition apparent of late, how
ever, to attribute considerable more of the fear
of impending hostilities than seems proper. Re
ports have been given in the press of a large
volume of cancellations in different lines of
trade, all due, it Is claimed, to the fear of
strained relations. Special and widespread in
quiry fails to show anything like the reported
volume of cancellations in different kinds of
trade at various cities, with the s"le exception
of the woolen goods industry. And even here
the cause of the depression, while primarily
given ah disturbed condition of our foreign re
lations, hns been by some observers attributed,
and we believe to some extent properly, to the
natural reaction following the activity which
was a feature of woolen manufacturing a year
ago. These cancellations were reported as said
to have come ci. -fly from wholesale clothing
manufacturers, and the percentage given or
canceled orders has beei placed as high as 50
to 76 per cent. A number of mills, however.
are naid to have phut down, and the evil of
overstocking Is thought to have been largely
averted. Careful Inquiry while showing a
considerable portion of the cancellations to
have been due to the prospect of war. would
indicate that fully 50 per cent of them have
been due to clothing houses giving larger orders
than they really required In the hope that the
market would continue to advance. As the
market, however, has disappointed them the
orders have been simply canceled and the
above reasons have been assigned.
BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. April 22.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
On the whole the speculative world has re
ceived the serious developments of the present
week with calmness. The long preparation
through which the stock market here has
passed in the last two months and the fact
that weak bull accounts have been reduced
to a minimum by the preceding liquidation, ac
count in a large measure for this fact.
The trading contingent here, who took entire
charge of the market in the complete absence
of any public interest, seemed very nervous
and they were very prompt contractors on any
rumors indicating that Spain would withdraw
from her position or that the course of action
mapped r.ut by Congress might be delayed.
The market, In spite of the very belligerent as
pect 01 aiiuirs, uaii several such rauxes. m.n
gled with its waiting and dullness in the early
days of the week, and London's free offer
ings seemed to be well absorbed. It might be
noted, however, that railroad bonds, In which
there has been no speculation and no short
interest, were relatively higher than the stock
market, the course of which was influenced by
those circumstances.

KING IS ATTACKED AGAIN.
The Captain Smith Estate Is to Be a
Bone of Contention.
OAKLAND, April 22.-Sadie E. Thomp

tioned Judge Ellsworth to remove C. K.
King as administrator of the estate of
John W. Smith, deceased. King has been
cited to appear at 10 a. m. Monday, May
3, to appear and show cause why
the letters should not be revoked. He
Is charged with incompetency, misman
agement, waste and party to fraud upon
the estate. A similar complaint was made
last year, but withdrawn before it went
to trial. C. H. Smith of Denver, a son
of the deceased, caused King to be ap
pointed and is a bondsman.
The plaintiffs charge that King paid
$1274 on September 23, 1896, to Charles H.
Smith on a claim not chargeable to the
t-s-tate, J2ll 40 being taxes on property re
corded in his name, and $ST7 3S assess

WANT JUSTICE
FOR DONELLY
His Accusers Proved to
Be Men of the Worst
Type.
Probable That the Claim of
a Plot Had Some
Foundation.
Ex-Officer Banks and Charles Pipen
berg Gave the Testimony That
Convicted Him.
pakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 22.
An effort will soon be made to secure
the release of John Donelly from San
Quentin. Donelly is serving a fifteen-year
term for burglary in the first degree, but
there are so many suspicious circum
stances connected with the evidence un
der which he was convicted that there !s
now a substantial doubt as to whether
he was guilty or not.
Donelly was tried under a complaint I
sworn to by Charles L. Banks, then a
police officer, now a fugitive from Oak
land. At his trial Donelly asserted that
be was the victim of a plot on the part of
! Banks and one Charles Pipenberg, now a
' convict, who had determined on getting:
I him out of the way. Donelly's story was
to the effect that Pipenberg told h^n he
â  had some goods in a certain place and
that if they went together they could pro
cure them. In order to gain an entrance
into the house, Pipenberg, it was stated,
left the entrances open, and with Donelly
went in at nighttime. Banks was near by,
and had no difficulty in arresting Donelly
and charging him with burglary. Banks
. also, to make his case more solid, had a
prior charge of petty larceny included in
the complaint.
; Just how much of Donelly's story is true
will perhaps never be known; but Banks
and Pipenberg, the witnesses for the
prosecution, have since been proved to be
thoroughly worthless and unreliable as
well as criminal, and there is a feeling
among those who believe in fair play
that Donelly was not convicted on reiia
1 ble testimony.
Officer Banks mysteriously disappeared
â  from this city about two years ago, just
at the time when an important bribery
case centered around Chinese lotteries
. was about to come to trial. Banks ar
ranged the meeting at his house with
some Chinese gamblers, and ar'ter he had
; secreted witnesses he induced the Chinese
j to tell him of various times and places
at which they had given hush money to
ChWef of Police Shafer. There was ill
'â  feeling between Shafer and Banks, and
; no credence was placed in Banks' plot to
compass the Chief's disgrace. A little
later the question arose as to whether
Banks had not committed perjury regard
ing his citizenship when taking the oath
of a police officer. Other matters were
; brought up, and Banks discovered that
he was facing criminal proceedings i
sides. One night he went out on his beat
, as usual on Broadway, and noi
ever been seen of him since. It was then
discovered that he had sold his waxrant
in advance, and the bolder of it Â«
: to prosecute him, but he could not be
found. This is the man upon whose testi
mony largely Donelly was convicted.
Charles Pipenberg. the other witness
; for the prosecution, has a criminal record
ias long as any man in the county. He
- has done time for all sorts of crimes, be
; sides being addicted to the use of opium.
; Now that the true character of the lead
ing witnesses against Donelly has come
: out it is thought that the man in San
Quentin should have a "show." Unlike
wealthy prisoners, he was unablo to se
, cure a few years' continuance, but w; â 
speedily tried and convicted. -The infor
, mation against him was filed in the Su
â  perior Court February 19, 1391. Thirteen
days later he was found guilty. Judg
, ment was postponed for a week, when a
rr. ->tlon in arrest of judgment was denied;
another for a motion for a new trial was
as promptly denied, and on March 16
Donelly was sentenced to sixteen years,
largely on account of the prior conviction
of petty larceny, which Banks had ma
i liciously placed against him. It is not
j argued by his friends that Donelly Is a
| model young man. but it is said that he
lat least deserves justice, and having
| served over seven years it is thought to
be reasonable, considering all the clrcum
' stances, that he should now be regarded
| as being worthy of release on parole if
not of an absolute pardon.

AFTER THE WAR
Ex-Judge Gibson Holds a
Unique Court in His
Office.
Judge Carroll Cook Figures
in a Bit of Ancient
Litigation.
Is a Judgment Debtor Because He
Once Was Accommodating .>.-.
Uj a Friend.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 22.
One of the most unique courts ever con
vened In California met last night in the !
office of ex-Judge Gibson to complete a
legal paper over which nine years have .
already been spent.
The case involved Judge Carroll Cook ;
of San Francisco, who now finds himself j
in the unpleasant position of a judgment '
debtor merely because he was accommo
dating enough to go on a note about
twelve years ago in behalf of an estate
which was thought to be solvent. It de- j
veloped later, however, that the estate j
v.as of no value, and in course of time ;
suit was brought and a judgment en
tered against the estate and Mr. Cook.
When Judge Gibson was sitting on the
Superior bench of this county the case
of Gage vs. Cook et a!, was tried. Gage
held a claim against the estate and when
he found it could not be liquidated he
brought suit against Mr. Cook, who had
been induced to sijn the note on behalf
of a friend. The case was tried and
judgment was entered against Conk et a]
and later, in another phase of litigation,
against Cook alone.
It was decided by Mr. Cook ten years
ago to appeal the case to the Supreme
Court. Soon after tnis decision was
reached Judge Gibson went out of office
and Mr. Cook went to San Francisco,
where he became prominent in law and
politics. The affair lagged for a few
years, but Gage became .* o anxious to
collect his judgment that he forced mat
ters to an issue. Attorney Cook then
proceeded to draw up his bill of excep
tions. It is this bill that has been so
many years In process of construction.
Mr. Cook, now Superior Judge Cook, can
not afford much of his time to come to
this county to help draw up the bill
which must be dont\ unless good cause
can be. shown for the contrary by the
Judge before whom the case was tried.
Attorney Shaw, representing Mr. Gage,
is more anxious than ever for a settle
ment, and so at Intervals of about six
months the court convenes in Judge Gib
son's ofhee at nighttime and proceeds
slowly.
At last night's session Judge Gibson In
troduced a novel element into the pro
ceedings. He stated that should It be
necessary he â¢would again offer his ser
vices to the country, as he did in the
early sixties, and consequently he pleaa
ed with the attorney to allow the mat
ter of settling the bill of exceptions to
co over until after the war. The court
adjourned with the understanding that
the motion to continue "'until after the
war" shall be considered as being under
advisement.
Rolled Beneath a Train.
OAKLAND, April 22.â Henry Davis,
chief engineer of the river steamer Mon
ticello. had both legs amputated above
th" knr-es at the Receiving Hospital this
afternoon. He was on his way from San
Francisco on the 7:15 boat this morning,
when he attempted to aught from the
narrow gauge train at Hay & Wrights
ship yard. lie fell am. rolled in such a
way that his legs went under the train.
He was picked up and brou~nt to Seventh
street by the train hands, where he was
taken off in an express wagon. When
told that his feet must come off he said:
"Well, if that is the case let me die right
here. I don't want to live if I have to
lose both legs."
Be Careful of Water.
OAKLAND, April 22.â The Contra Costa
Water Company has Issued the following
request:
This Reason is the dryeÂ«t known In the his

THE KEEFE MATTER.
Police Place No Credence in Eddie's
Story Accusing His Father of
Murdering His Mother.
ALAMEDA. April 22â The Alameda
police take no stock In the story told by
Eddie Keefe as to the alleged murder of
his mother by his father on the morning
of the oth of July last. They are so skep
tical that they say they will do nothing
in the premises unless something more
than Eddie's wild yarn shall transpire to
convince them that a crime has been com
mitted.
Keefe himself is Indignant at this latest
tale of his son, and declares that he
wants nothing so much as an investiga
tion. As stated, however, the police say
there Is nothing to investigate, and the
District Attorney's office made the same
statement to-day in response to a query
if it Intended to move in the matter.
A short time since Keefe created quite
a scene when a young lady reporter for
one of the city papers called on him and
began to ask him about the disappear
ance of his wife. He pretendod to be so
shocked that he apparently fell to the
ground in a fit. But a young phvsiclan
who was there saw at a glance that he
was fakinp. and brusquely told Keefe to
quit his nonsense, at the same time stir
rir.p him up somewhat vigorously, where
upon he arose to his fo-et and, with a
sheepish look, threw off in an instant all
symptoms of illness.
VOLUNTEERS CALLED FOR.
Trying to Bring Company Q of Ala
meda Up to the Full Complement.
ALAMEDA, April 22.â Company G of
the Fifth Regiment, which belongs in this

These were posted about town and the
response was almost immediate. Many
inquiries were received at once, and it is
expected that the entire number of re
cruits desired will be quickly obtained.
Pursuant to orders from brigade head
quarters, an election was held by Com
pany G at its armory last evening for a
second lieutenant to take the place of
Lieutenant Claude Shafer, removed.
There were two candidates, Sergeant E.
R. McDonald and Charles Fletter. The
former recived a majority of the votes
and was declared elected. It was under
stood last evening that there was a prob
ability that the company would be called
on for active service, and there was great
enthusiasm among the members in con
sequence.

Agricultural Report Is Out.
BERKELEY, April 22.â The "partial re
port of work of the agricultural experi
ment stations of the University of Cali
fornia for the years lisHC-Dti and 1596-97"
appeared to-day. The delay in the pub
lication of the report for 1895-96 was
caused by the fire which destroyed the
old agricultural building ci y<-ar ago, at
tbe sarm* time destroying many records
and "copy" for the report.
The closing of the State printing office
and the Farmers' Institute work, which
took up much of the time of the depart
ment staff, also caused delay in the pub
lication of the book. The report for the
two years has been condensed into 455
pages, and is typographically the neatest
that the department has ever published.
The work on the book was .lone by the
university printer, J. W. Flinn.

quartet, rendered classical selections to
the great delight of the Knights assem

ON THEIR WAY
TO KLONDIKE
Arrival of a Steamer and
Schooner From East
ern Ports.
The Roanoke From Baltimore
and the Nettie Coieman
From Boston.
On Her Arrival To-Day the Tug Fear
less Will Be Turned Over to
the Government.
The new Klondike steamer Roanoke ar
rived fronj Baltimore yesterday after a
s-mart japtage of flfty-ono clays. The
ac-tua! frtf-amlng time was only forty-nine
days, as Captain Kldston maile thre.e an
clii'iagca ir. the Straits of Magellan. '->n
the Sth list, the battle-sfrio Oregon was
sighted ir latitude 14.15 soutn, longitude
11. 2^ wes. trcing south.
The n^anoke comes here for the North
American Trading and Transportation
Company and will go on the ran between
h<sre and St. Michael. She w.u built in |
1882 and was for a time on the great
lakes. For years she raji bfttwean New
York and Virginia In the Old Dominion
line and was always a favorite. She is
a well-appointed steamer, but her pas-
senger accommodation will be largely in
creased before she goes on the Alaska
route. Captain Kidston, who brought the
Roanoke out. was formerly the master
of the steamer Portland, now owned by
the Alaska Commercial Company. He Is
accompanied by his wife and child.
The Mail Company's steamer Rio de
Janeiro and the Occidental and Oriental
Steamship Company's chartered steamer
Venus both went to the Mail dock yes
terday. In the case of the Venus Dr.
Rosenau and Captain McGregor patched
up their differences and the vessel was
admitted to pratique. Two tugs brought
her over from the Angel Island quaran
tine station and the work of discharging
her began at once. The Rio arrived
Thursday night and as she came in with
a clean bill of health she was allowed
to dock the first thing yesterday morn
ing. She brought over fifty-four cabin
and fifteen European steerage passengers
and 316 Chinese and Japanese.
Owing to the falling off in the pas
senger trade to Dyea and Skaguay tner*
is barely enough business to keep the
regular steamers going, and in conse
quence the sailing vessels that werÂ»
towed up and down t..e Sound have been
laid up. The charterers have therefore
nothing for the tug Monarch of the "Red
Stack" line to do, and she is coming
back to San Francisco. She has beten
secured by the "Black Stack" Company
and will take the place made vacant by
the sale of the Vigilant to the Govern
ment. The "Red Stack" Company's en
gineers will remain with the Monarch,
but the chances are that Captain Clem
Randall of the big tug Fearless will take
command of her as soon as he turns his
vessel over to Uncle SaVn.
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
appointed W. M. Gibson Jr. of the Stock
ton assistant captain of dredger is'o. l.
He succeeds William Douglas, whose
term of office has expired.
The German ship H. F. Glade, which
arrived on March 14 in England from
San Francisco, has gone to Bremen to
load merchandise and emigrants for Ha
waii.
The stout American siiip Charmer 1s
ready for sea and will sail for New York
in a few days. Captain Holmes is not
madly in love with the prospects since
war has been declared. He has among
his cargo over 3CKW casks of wine and a
very large consignment of beans, so his
vessel would be a godsend to the hun
gry and thirsty men on some Spanish
cruiser.
The steamer City of Puebla, which ar
rived from Puget Sound ports yesterday,
brought down the remains of two of trie
victims of the snowslide at Sheep Camp
The passage down was a very quick one
and the steamer had to be slowed down
so as not to get In ahead of time. Whiio
docking at New Whau om the Puebla
took four fingers off the hand of a boy
i named Wilson. The lad had his hand
I over the top of a fender pile and was
looking down into the water. He was
not aware of his danger until after the
crush came. At Anacortes the wharf
caught fire and the boys on the steamer
had to organize a bucket brigade in or
! der to save the structure.
The new river steamer H. J. Corcoran
was launched from the yards of the Cal
ifornia Navigation and Improvement
Company last Wednesday. She is 210
feet long. 38 feet broad and is to make
twenty-two knots an hour. The new
boat was modeled by H. J. Corcoran, su
perintendent of the company, and W De
1 lany. She was built by T. M. Barker
: and G. L. Hendrickson and Master Jolnor
Otto Peterson. She will have her trial
, trip about July 1. and after that will run
between Stockton and San Francisco in
connection with the Valley road.
The schooner Nettie Coleman arrived
from Boston yesterday with a party of
Klondikers aboard. The original inten
tion was to go to Puget Sound, but tha
gold hunters decided to put In here ana
see what the outlook was before goins
any fartbex.

SICK SHRIMPS
IN THE BAY
Dr.E.S. Pilllsbury Has Dis
covered That Toxine
Is the Cause.
At First Thought to Be Micro
organisms Lying as Para
sites in the Creeper.
A Report Hns Been Forwarded to the
Board of Health and Some Action
Will Be Taken.
There Is probably no little "animal" In
the world with as many titles of magni
tude as the California shrimp, and from
recent Investigations made by Dr. E. S.
Pillsbury, instructor in bacteriology at
the Cooper Medical College, they are im
pregnated or stuffed with different siÂ».
stances, chemical and germs, which tuso
carry immense names with them.
According to the doctor and his inves
tigations the shrimps are a poisonous
food to a certain extent, and the fact that
this was not disco v % -ed before was
that Investigations merely took In a
search for micro-organisms living as par
asites in the shrimp, while now it is dis
covered that the fault lay with toxlne.
an aJkaloid, which in aJI probability was
produced by bacteria of decomposition
found in the refuse from slaughter houses
on which the shrimps fed.
The shrimps which are so peculiarly
diseased have been residing near "Butch
ertown," and were seen to be in a flabby
and appparently unhealthy condition. The
articles published exclusively in The Call
early in January last failed the atten
tion of the Board of Health to the sick
nesa of the creepers, and Or. Spencer
v,.,:- ordered to make a bacteriological ex
amination for the purpose Â»>i" discovering
what caused the paleness of the shrimps.
He found, as did Dr. Pillsbury, thai there
were none of the so-called pathogenic
bacteria existing, but they did not ex
amine as is now done in largo East
ern cities for toxic products, ptomaines.
of these non-pathogenic bacteria. It is
now discovered by l>r. Pillsbury that
these products are responsible for the
sickness and death in all unhealthy flesh
foods, rather than the bacteria them
selves, which are all killed in the process
of cooking. The following report has
been submitted to the Hoard of Health by
Dr. Pillsbury:
A bacteriological examination of shrimps
caught off Butchertown, San Fran. -is.-,. Hay,
gave negative results as far a> finding patho

media, to which Parlettfs solution of car
bolic acid 1. led, but nine proved to
be the well known pat] terta.
A chemical analysis was then made to de
termine If these shrimps contained any poison
ous alkaloids. The first method used was that
ordinarily used to obtain the alkaloids fruin
opium, and the result from this method was a
i :i<- wlm b in verj dilute .â - >iuiiuii ha.J a
decid- n on a rabbit.
Two rabbits Â«tre tak< n which "ere alike in
nil rps|*ri^ Lbbit No. 1 was Injected
subcutaneously a solution of ptomaines from
the San Pablo Bay shrimps which were us> d
as a control in all my analyses. Then into rab
bit No. 2 was injected BubCUtaneously a like
quantity of solution of ptomaines from Butch
ertown shrimps. Immediately alter this Injec
tion into rabbit No. 2 this rabbit began to
scream most painfully, - :it â  â  an ex
tremely Irritable condition with twitchlngs of
legs and ear.- and a decided increase in heart
and respiration rate.
With rabbit No. 1 (San Pablo Bay shrimps)
there was apparently no change except a slight
increase In heart and respiration rate.
Time of Injections !i p. m. 'â 
The following morning rabbit No. 1 seemed
brighter than usual, showing benefit rather
than 111-effects from Its injection. Rabbit No.
2 was sluggish and feverisu, had passed bloody
urine uur.n^ the nislit ana during; tne day loi
lowing larjte 'Â..â  I tips' of bloody urine.
Now while neither rabbit died, the effect of
this small amount of the ptomaine extract
(only twenty-four live and apparently healthy
Butchertown shrimps were used) the experi
ment shows that these ehrimpa cannot be suit
able for food, and jour honorable board should
order their sale stopped.
The result has L<~â more than confirmed by
later experiments. From 200 grammes of live
Butchertown shrimps I extracted, by the meth
od of Brieger, the Qon-volatiie aiKaloids and
found that even in a minute dose they were
fatal to a healthy rabbit. A sample of these
alkaloidal extracts was furnished to your City
Bacteriologist, Dr. Spencer.
Still further, from the muscle alone, as
shelled out of shrimps cooked by myself to In
sure freshness, I have obtained as strong; aikal
oldal reactions t,y the methods already men
tioned and as well by Sonnenschein'a method
for confirmatory evidence, and from its rf-;ir
tlons have every reason to believe it would be
as fataj obtained in this way aa by BrW
method, which Is the one in vogue In Eastern
cities, and aa al â -â â¢ â  toxine which
was fatal for my mbbit.
In view of the results of these experiments.
nhowing with ut doubt I I hrimps con
tain a substance which is Fatally poisonous In
sufficient doses and d>-ci(iedly injurious in
LINEMAN ELECTROCUTED.
(small dose*, and proving further that this sub
stance is not removed by cooking, but con
tained within the cocked muscle of the shrimp,
I most respectfully request that your honorable
â  I Hear.!! >p|-<.ii-i iluii the Mle vi tuÂ«-!"i*
Butohertown shrimps be stopped. Respectfully
submitted. K. S. PILL.SBURY, M. I).

HOW CLANCY
WENT BROKE
We started out. and were doing first rate,
when that explosion that wrecked the
Maine occurred. Well, it wrecked us as
well. We were playing in a small in
terior town i..c night the news was re
celved, and when the audience heard of it
they wanted to mob the entire outfit on
the stage, and the only way we saved our
lives was by playing the 'Star-Spangled
Banner. 1 while the leader, washing the
stain from his face, advanced to the front
of the stage and recited a war poem in
Yankee dialect.
"This prevented us from being hanged
outright, but the show was a dead one.
We were forced to spent the entire re
ceipts of the box office in treating the
town while it drank patriotic toasts, and
when we went broke were given two
hours to tret out of town, and had to
have on a train of flatcars. I am. now en
2 :._'â¢â¢'] in getting up a company of Scan
dinavian volunteers, and if you will let
me have a quarter to help swell the com
missary department's exchequer I will see
that your name is placed on the company
roll of honor."
He got the money.

CHARGES FROID, a lineman In the
employment of the Pacific Telephone

by an electric shock while at work on
torj of a pole at the southeast corner of
Eddy and Taylor streets yesterday after
noon. A live electric light wire had been
broken and one of the broken ends fell
across the wire on which Froid was
working. The shock threw him back
ward fuid he lay supported by the string
of wires. Three other linemen, James
Fulton, James MoGinley and James Lori
mer, were at work on other poles, and
they heard the cry that Froid was in
jured. Fulton was the first to reach the
pole on which Froid lay limp and help
less, and he was quickly beside him. A
rope was procured and handed to Fulton
and he tied it round Froid's body. He
had considerable difficulty in Retting; him
treed from the network of wires, and
with the assistance of McGlnley and Lori
mer, Froid was lowered to the platform
about the center of the pole. By this time
several policemen and an immense crowd
of people had gathered and willing hands
helped in lowering Froid from the plat
form to the ground. Between fifteen and
twenty minutes were occupied In remov
ing I'roid from the wires and lowering
mm to the ground. Meantime the patrol
wagon had been summoned from the Cen
tral I olice station and Froid was driven
as rapidly as possible to the Receiving
Hospital where Dr. Fitzgibbon pro
nounced life extinct. The body was re
moved to the Morgue. Froid was a mar
ui, J man - and live(i with his wife and two
children at 119 Silver street.

PATRIOTISM
WITH SONG
AND PRAYER
First Day's Session of Epworth
League Convention Marked
a Success.
Able Speakers Praise God and Ridicule the
Present System of City Government and
Political Ambitions.
Success has marked the first attempt
to bring together the workers of the
Er^orth I,eatjue from all portions of the
State. The convention concert, which
marked the opening of tho exorcises ar
ranged for. has apparently paved the way
for socia.l and Interesting meetings, and
without an exception the members have
entered the work with all the spirit of
which they are possessed.
Karly yesterday morning the first im
portant gathering in the beautifully deco
rated Howard-street Church was held.
There was a large attendance and the
day's work and pleasure was opened with
Bong led by Robert Husband, followed by
a prayer service by Key. M. C. Alexander.
The church has been turned Into a ver
itable color booth, as the league colors,
scarlet and white, are draped in pro
fuÃion, and here and there the national
colors lend beauty to the scene.
The platform In the church has been
built forward into the auditorium for the
purpose of better accommodating the
large chorus of voices which will lend
their assistance in making- the gathering
a success not soon to be forgotten. The
ladies and gentlemen of the reception
committee have received praise from all
sides for the interest taken in flic work,
and they graciously act as guides, bureaus
of information, messengers and have as
â well taken It upon themselves to meet
every incoming train on which any visit-
Ing delegates were expected.
At 9 o'clock, eight-minute reports con- j
cerning the features of this year's work
In the league were submitted by the dis
trict presidents. Miss Man.- L. IMckson of
Napa. W. 11. Young of Oakland, George
D. Kellogg of Sacramento and Professor
R. D. Hunt of San Francisco. It was re
marked by the president of the San Fran
cisco district that for each month during
the past year a wedding had taken place
among the members ot the Santa Cruz
branch, and the speaker seemed to be of
the opinion that many other branches of
\\'' organization should stir their mem
bers up to the wedding pitch.
The interest that has been taken by
the Chinese in this city in the work was
demonstrated by a large gathering of
Chinese members. who attentively listened
to words of praise delivered by their
leader. Rev. Chan Hun Fau. The Chinese
members have taken large parties
through their quarters free of charge,
and it has been decided to carry on the
excursions nightly. The young 1 people
t resent were congratulated by Rev. K. P.
lennett. president of the California Con
ference League, upon the good work done |
throughout the State during the past
year. The improvement of the organiza
tion was shown to be due to the united
efforts of the members to improve the
organization.
Miss E. J. Dornin of Grace M. E.
church read an interesting paper en
titled "Preparation for Leading a Devo
tional Meeting." and among other things
stated that the devotional meeting of the
league was the source whence the
real spiritual life of the league is de
rived, and that better work was accom
plished where prayer was heard. Where
much is to be accomplished the accom
plishment of the object in view is made
easier by prayer in proportion to the
magnitude of the undertaking.
L. L. Dennett, a popular attorney from
Modesto, spoke on "Harmonizing With
and Helping the Other Church Ser
vices." It was remarked by the speaker
that the league has many fields, but the
one point to be undertaken should be to
bring souls to the Lord Jesus Christ.
Loyalty tr> Methodism," he said, "was
no more antagonizing to other denomina
tions than a soldier to his regiment was
antagonistic to any other regiment In the
same army, fighting the same enemy "
At times during the meeting the speak
ers referred to thÂ«Â» soldiers and govern
ment, and patriotism was shown by loud
and continued applause. Rev. H. \V
Peck gave his views concerning "The
League and Revivals." Among other
things he said: "From Its very birth
Methodism has been characterized by
energy, spiritual fire and a determination
to evangelize the world. Our church Is
peculiarly adapted to the spiritual needs
of our people, and under God it has been
the means, and is largely the result of
the world's greatest revivals."
The speaker, after reviewing the splen
did work accomplished by both the
church and auxiliary organizations step
ped from the platform and the work en
titled "The Spiritual Department" had
been completed. Sectional conferences
followed, and the gathering separated to
hear the words of the speakers who held
the exercises in separate rooms In the
church.
Mlrs F. E. Johnston. M. S.. was in
charge of the literary department, and
Bpoke of Bible study, reading courses
lectures and classes. Rolla V. "Watt re
viewed the financial work and spoke of
proportional and liberal giving, but C. W.
Coyle, who Hi>oke on the "Pen and
Press," was the attraction for the greater
portion of the members. The presidents
of various districts, the presidents of con
ventions and the presiding elders met to
listen to his words. In a brief but in
teresting way he reviewed progress from
many points, and the learning and energy
which has seemed to follow in hÂ«*r wake
The afternoon session commenced at 2
O'clock, opening with a song service led
by Professor W. C. Stadtfeld, which was
followed by devotional exercises con
ducted by L. J. Norton, a member of
the Board of Control of the United
States.
"Relation to Christian Experience and
Evangelism" was reviewed by Rev. Bar
ton W. Berry, followed by a paper on
"Missionary Situation and Its Lesson to
Leaguers," read by Rev. F. J. Masters,
and Rev. A. J. Hanson contributed somo
Ideas on "Practical Measures for Con
serving," followed by Rev. John A. B.
"Wilson on "Missionary Information and
Interest."
The afternoon's work concluded with a
Junior rally, conducted by Mrs. M. D
Buck. Yesterday afternoon a reception
was held at the Chinese mission, 916
Washington street, where, refreshments

The evening session was opened with
prayer and song. The church was crowd
: ed to its utmost capacity to listen to the
'â  words of T. li. Hutchinson Esq. and Rev.
E. R. Dille, D. D. During the entire
evening the audj^nce was at a high pitch
and any reference to soldiers, the star
spangled banner or war orought forth a
storm of applause, which drowned the \
speaker's voice. "My County, 'T'ls of
Thee" was sung and but again kindled
1 the enthusiasm. The church was bright
â¢ ly lighted and the decorations showed to
the best advantage.
T. B. Hutchinson was the first speaker. |
He had chosen "What Constitutes a Good
Citizen" as his subject, and in well-chosen
words held the audience seemingly spell
bound. In part he said: "We have all
become enthused with the proper spirit. |
If a call to arms should come we are
ready and even anxious to avenge the j
Spanish insult which threw an entire na
tion into mourning at the loss of hun- i
dreds of brave men." At times the I
speaker referred to the flag and then ;
touched upon the Government of the
country and the politics, which were j
j stated to be corrupt, received a portion
I of the attention of the speaker.
I He was followed by Rev. E. R. Dille on
"Municipal Problems and Our Young i
People." As the speaker stepped to the I
platform he was greeted with cheers, I
waving banners and hand claps and for a '
time seemed to be overcome with the '
reception accorded him. After the burst j
of applause had died away the subject i
was taken up. Among other things he
said: "As a rule any large city is wholly
governed by the most ignorant of her I
citizens. In consequence the rising gen- \
eration is met with a difficulty hard to
overcome and gradually growing in many '
places until it would seem that the cor
rupt classes would never be put down
The cities are growing to an alarming ex- !
tent, and as they grow corruption in- i
creases. To have a successful man we !
must have good government and have it
remain so. At the present time the
white marble of the City Hall is stained
with corruption, and our hard earned
taxes support a race course. Oakland is
also corrupt. I have a friend who de
clares that he never drinks water as it
has tasted of sinners since the flood, and
the water across the bay also tastes of
the sinners who sold the city to th*
water company but a short while ag
ue have borne almost all that any onÂ«
is capable of bearing and yet there seems
to be no slackening of the pressure.
"We have had men whose names will
always live in the minds of the people for
their honored and patriotic acts and
praises should be delivered to the Al
mighty for that fact."
There will be no exercises this after
noon, as the members of the league will
visit places of interest in a body
Across the Bay.
In California, as nowhere else, a
short trip brings an almost complete
change of climatic conditions. El
Campo, the inviting resort established
by the Donahue road, is an example nt
this.
A half hour from the city on the big
steamer Ukiah and one is landed on
a shore of the bay entirely protected
from harsh winds and lying in perpet
ual sunshine. Plenty of room and plen
ty of warmth and all outdoors to enjoy
oneself.
Thousands go every Sunday, but a
crowd of almost any dimensions dwin
dles away in the big grounds at El

HUNTINGTON'S REQUEST.
At a Meeting Yesterday the Railroad
Commission Fixed an Early Date
for His Examination.
At a special meeting of the Roard of
Railroad Commissioners yesterday after
noon it was decided to grant the "petition
of Coilis P. Huntington to have the time
for the examination into the financial
condition of the Southern Pacific Com
pany set as soon as possible in order to
allow him to attend to his business mat
ters in the East and elsewhere.
Commissioners Hinton and La Rue
were the only ones present, as Commis
sioner Clark is confimd by illness to his
house and consequently was unalile to at
tend A letter from Mr. Clark was read
in which he gave favorable consideration
to the Huntington request. It was there
fore ordered that a sunj.ena be issued to
C. P Huntington to appear before the
board on Monday. May 2. at 1 p. m. pre
pared to answer such questions concern
ing the financial affairs of his road as
the board shall desire to put to him
that being the earliest date the board
could grant for his request.
A resolution appointing I. H. Polk spe

United States marines when ashore.
There are besides a number of attractive
cartoons of celebrities in social and the
atrical circles and much that is of in
terest in the way of reading matter. The
editorials are timely and vigorous and
the various departments show careful
preparation. Altogether this week's
Wasp is a number that is deserving of
special praise. 8

THE BAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 23, 1898.
SAVED BY A FENDER.
Little Arthur Rusk's Narrow Escape From
Death on Mission Street,
THE SYSTEM PRACTICALLY TESTED,
i
Arthur Rusk, a six-year-old boy, was struck, knocked down and
dragged several yards by a Mission street car, picked himself up, ran away â 
and completed the errand his mother had started him out on.
A few weeks ago, before the Introduction of a fender of any kind, this
statement would have seemed extraordinary or bordering on the impos- â¢
Bible, but to-day it stands a fact, and in one family at least the fender is â 
looked upon as a godsend. . â¢ â¢
Arthur lives at 2501 Mission street. Yesterday morning at about 9 o'clock â¢
his mother wished some trifling errand done and sent the little fellow â 
out, warning him to be careful in crossing the street. The child, how- â 
ever, was perhaps more impressed with the responsibility of being sent out â 
on an errand than in obeying his mother's injunction, and in his hurry â 
to do the errand and do it well, lie rushed- across the street in front of â¢
an approaching car. The motorman for a brief moment saw the half- â 
dazed child hesitating in the track of his car, then, with the skill of a â¢
practiced hand, pulled the brake. It was too late, however, to avoid an â¢
accident, which without the fender would certainly have been fatal. The â¢
front end of the car struck the little fellow, bearing him down right In â¢
front of those grinding wheels which would crush out the life in a half -
turn. But the little bars of iron Interposed. As the car slid along with â 
brakes firmly set the boy was rolled round and round in front of the â 
wheels mercifully balked of their prey. With a few groans and squeaks â 
the wheels stopped in obedience to the brakes. The boy was picked upâ â¢
semi-conscious, it is true, but practically unhurt, and saying that he must â 
transact "Mamma's errand" ran away. The fender had won the victory â 
and the morbid crowd which follows an accident like a flock of vultures -
soon dispersed.
ROBINSON
HAS NOT
RETURNED
The City Prison Captain Still in the
East and May Not Come
Back.
Writes a Letter to His Temporary Successor,
Reuben Wolfâ Says He Is Tired of
Police Business.
It Is more than likely that Captain
Robinson of the City Prison will not
return. At the meeting of the Police
Commissioners on March 7 he was
granted a leave of absence for four
teen days on the plea that his father
had died in the East and his presence
would be necessary in order to settle
up the estate left by the deceased. Just
before leaving this city Robinson in
formed a friend that he did not intend
to return, and announced his deteririi-
nation to permanently locate in the
East, where he had spent his boyhood
days. Hla leave of absence was up
Thursday, but despite this fact Robin
son is still enjoying himself in the
East.
Yesterday Acting: Captain Wolf re
ceived a letter from Robinson in which
he advised him to keep a sharp look
out for the storeroom.
"Be extremely cautious," he wrote.
"The contractors will do you up If they
see the least chance."
Last night Wolf visited the office of
Chief Lees and showed him the letter.
After reading it the head of the Po
lice Department told him to continue aa
captain of the prison.
When seen a short time afterward
the Chief said that he could not un
derstand why Robinson had not re
turned.
"He is certainly overdue," he remark
ed. "His leave of absence was up yes
terday. Whether or not be intends to
return I do not know."
When asked if Robinson had been
granted an extension of time, the Chief
emphatically answered "No."
Among his few intimate friends their
opinion is that Robiiiison will not come
back to the city. In his letter to Act
ing Captain Wolf he wrote that he
had been granted an extension of time
by the Commissioners, and that he
would return in a short time. The
Commissioners emphatically deny that
the astute captain ever applied for an
extension of time and threaten to de
capitate him at their next meeting. If
they take such action Wolf will in all
probability be made captain of the
prison. He has a host of friends who
would like to see him promoted to the
position of captain.
The Labor Council.
There was very little business out of
the routine transacted at last night's
meeting of the Labor Council, but a dele
gation from the Allied Printing Trades
Council was present and much time was
given up to the discussion of the status
of the printers' strike. C. E. Hawkes,
president of the Typographical Union,
again reiterated the list of grievances
which led up to the strike and thanked
the unions affiliated with toe council fo?
the speedy and substantial manner with
which the requests for llnancial assist
ance had been met. He also reported
that the local office of the American
I ress Association had adopted the label
and willingly conformed with the chapel
regulations of the International Typo
graphical Union. The Young Ladies' In
stitute has also forwarded a letter to the
strike, committee expressing the sym
pathy of that organization with "the
strikers and a copy of a resolution to
the effect that all printing .lone for the
institute in the future will bear the union
].-l>' '. A committee from the Labor
t ouncil was appointed to co-nperate with
the strike committee in turning work
away from the offices opposed to the
union.
THE VALLEY ROAD BOOMING.
All Along the I/me the Work Is Pro-
gressing With Gratifying
Alacrity.
Chief Kngineer Storey of the Valley
Road returned yesterday from a tour of
inspection he has been making over the
entire line. He reports that the road is
now entirely completed to within three
miles of Bakerstlold, and that the great
steel bridge over the Kern River has been
pushed ahead with such expedition that
it Is expected by the first of the month
the track over it will have been laid.
The terminal facilities that havo been
secured at Bakersfleld are In every way
all that can bo desired. There Is yard
room covering a space of seven blocks In
length by one block In width and work
is now goinsr forward on a brick combi
nation stationâ that is, a station combin
ing baggage room and passenger rooms
under one roof, the walls of which are
already beginning to climb well upward.
The grading on the link from Visalia
to Waukena Junction has commenced
from the Junction end and about one mile
of grading has b(!en completed.
Mr. Storey says he expects the road to
do considerable business this year in
shipping cattle. The section of the coun
try that it taps is well watered and the
feed is abundant, consequently the dry
conditions that prevail in other parts of
the State will not be felt there.
The approaches to the Franklin tunnel
are about cleared away, and portals are
being erected at either end. It is ex
pected that in about a week or ten days
the actual boring will commence.
THE WILLIAMS TRIAL.
The proceedings yesterday in the Uni
ted States District Court in the case of
the Government against Dick Williams,
former inspector, consisted of attempts
on the part of the defense to show that
the reputation of Wong Sam in the mat
ter of the landing of Chinese was bad.
Among the witnesses were William G.
Hates and L. J. Prince, who swore that
they would not believe Wonpr Sam under
oath. Bates pave his occupation as be
ing Interested in a gold quartz mine in
Southern Oregon since last November.
The ease will be submitted to the jury
next Monday morning at 10 o'clock.
THE CITY
ROBBED OF
THOUSANDS
Outrageous Frauds in Furnishing
Supplies for the
Schools.
Grand Jury Unearths a Mass of Corruption
That Will Implicate
Many.
The School Committee of the Grand
Jury has begun an Investigation into
the School Department that promises
to disclose a state of corruption of such
magnitude that the defalcation at
Treasurer Widber will sink into insig
nificance by comparison.
Enough has been exposed by the first
day's investigation, which was made
yesterday, to show that the city has
been robbed of thousands of dollars,
and that some of the heads of the de
partment must at least have had
some knowledge of what was going on.
Whether the Directors themselves will
be able to clear their skirts remains to
be seen.
Yesterday's developments would
seem to indicate that aside from P.
Bwlft, the contractor far furnishing
lumber to the department, the most
culpable party is Director Racan's
brother-in- law, John O'Brien, Inspec
tor of School Buildings, while Chair
man Gallagher of the Finance Commit
tee and Burns of the Buildings and
Grounds Committee will be called upon
to explain why they audited and recom
mended the payment of bills that on
the very face look suspicious, O'Brien
is the same familiar John The Call had
occasion to refer to less than six weeks
ago. John draws a salary of $150 a
month from the department and is sup
posed to give his entire attention to
the city, but it was shown that he had
found ample time to engage in the con
tracting business and to superintend
his private work. One Job in particu- |
lar was referred toâ that of putting in
a foundation under a building at 725 ;
Mission street. O'Brien was not
charged with using city material in his
outside jobs because it was not known j
where he obtained his supplies, but
yesterday's investigation fully estab
lished the fact that the city has paid
for thousands of dollars' worth of lum
ber it has never received, and that
Kagan's brother-in-law must have had
some knowledge of it.
When The Call informed President
Barrington of O'Brien's private con
tracts that gentleman expressed his as
tonishment, and promised to look into
it, but if he has he has done it so quiet
ly that the public has never learned
of it.
For several weeks the Grand Jury
has been investigating- the financial ac
counts of the School Board, to the won
der of those who knew what was going
on, for it was regarded as one of the
regular cursory investigations that
every Grand Jury undertakes. Mem
bers of the board were summoned be
fore the Grand Jury session after ses
sion, and they seemed to regard the
whole affair as a bore â a waste of time
and talk.
But the Grand Jury was accumulat
ing data to enable it to begin an inves
tigation on lines widely divergent from
those usually pursued, and when every- i
thing was in readiness the work was
begun. The first move of the Com
mittee on School Department was to
invite A. B. Truman, a member of the
inquisitorial body, to co-operate with
it. This was done because of Mr. Tru
man's large experience in such matters.
The committee consisted of Emil Bauer.
H. A. Hedger and W. J. Bryan, and at
their request Mr. Truman, with the as
sistance of the jury's expert, began a
quiet investigation into the affairs of
the supplies department.
The result of this inquiry led Tru
man to request the committee to pro
cure the services of experts in lumber
and carefully inspect the repairs that
have been made recently. The com
mittee already had in its possession
the bills for lumber and shingles sup
plied â or rather chargedâ to the depart
ment for the six months beginning June
1, 1597, and ending December 31, last.
The heads of the California Lumber
Association were called upon and they
promptly recommended George B.
Campbell and E. J. Holt as the two
most reliable and expert lumbermen in
the State. Their services were readily
secured, and with Expert W. H. Rick
ard, the jury's expert, the committee
and Truman met at Bauer's office at 9
o'clock yesterday morning and began
to probe into the unsavory mass of cor-
ruption.
Enough had previously been learned
about Contractor Swift and his ar
rangement with the board to prepare
the party for almost anything that
might turn up in the way of crooked
work. For instance, Swift's contract
calls for two grades of shingles, com
mon and fancy. The first are the or
dinary roof coverings; the latter are of
a uniform width of six inches with
trimmed ends and are used for decora
tion purposes. The contract price for
the common shingles is 99 cents per
thousand. The regular price, wholesale,
is $1 70 a thousand. For the fancy
shingles Swift's bid of $1 91 per thou
sand was accepted, and no wonder, for
the regular price is $2 70 per thousand.
In view of these cuts on the regular
prices the investigators did not look
for any waste of fancy shingles.
They didn't. In fact they did not find
where a single fancy shingle had been
used during the period named, although
the city had been charged $1 91, the
contract price for the better grade, for
all the shingles used.
The first place visited by the Grand
Jurymen was the Clement Grammar
School, on Geary street, near Jones.
Their method of procedure was the
same at all the buildings visited. En
tering the yard they summoned the
principal and asked him to point out all
the repairs that had been made during
the six months prior to January 1. He
did so and the jurors then put the ex
perts to work to measure the shingles
and lumber used.
The records of the school department
showed that the city had been charged
for 19,000 fancy shingles at $1 91 per
thousand. The experts' measurements
showed that only 10,000 common shin
gles had been used. In other words
the city had paid $36,290 for 10,000 com
mon shingles, the cost of which, under
the contract, would be $9900; a differ
ence of $26,300 on that one lot of shin
gles.
The jurymen next visited the Hamil
ton Grammar School on Geary street,
near Scott. For repairing that building
the city had been charged for 17.000
shinglesâ fancy of courseâ at $1 91. and
61,350 feet of No. 1 two-inch Oregon

pine at the contract price of $7 74. The
experts' measurements showed that
only 7500 common shingles and 30,000
feet of No. 3 Oregon pine had been used,
a difference of 9500 shingles and 31,350
feet of pine. Less than half the quan
tity charged for had been used, while
the highest price had been charged for
inferior material.
At the Golden Gate Primary on Gol
den Gate avenue, between Scott and
Pierce, the department's records show
' ed that 14,000 fancy shingles, at $1 91
: per thousand: 4425 feet of Ix 6 No. 1
tongue and grooved redwood at $19 05
per "thousand, and 5376 feet of No. 1 Ixlo
rustic at $16 45 per thousand had been
used. The experts could only find 5500
common shingles, 2854 feet of No. 2 red
wood, and 1900 feet of rustic, half of
which was No. 1, and the other half
No. 2.
A visit to the John Swett Grammar [
School on McAllister street, near |
Gough, showed that Inspector O'Brien
had been unable to find any use for
shingles during the six months, but he
did manage to get in a bill for the con
tractor for repairing a stairway. The
bill as paid calls for 2288 feet of step
ping at $24 per thousand, yet the ex
perts could only find where 867 feet had
been used, and the principal was posi
tive they had been shown all the re
pairs that had been made.
The Everett school on Sanchez, near
Sixteenth, panned out better, from the
contractor's standpoint, and no doubt I
Ragan's brother-in-law was satisfied, j
Besides the usual deficiency in, ana
overcharge for, lumber, the investiga- !
tion disclosed a little job performed by 1
Inspector O'Brien that, when it be- j
comes known, is not likely to add to
his reputation as a private contractor. I
Some more shingling had been done j
here, for which the city paid, as usual, I
81 91 per thousand for common shingles !
it ought to have been charged 99 cents
a thousand for. There were 44,000 shin- j
gles charged in the bill, but the ex- i
pert's measurement could only un- \
earth 27,000. Then there was a charge :
for 315 feet of 2-inch Oregon pine, at
$7 74 per M., which dwindled to 90 feet i
under the experts' rules.
During Truman's preliminary inves- j
tigation he had heard much of a mys- i
terious boiler and furnace, buried some- |
where on the grounds of the Everett I
School, and Mrs. Banning, the princi
pal, was questioned yesterday as to
what she knew about it. She pointed
to a little shed in the yard that is used [
by the teachers as a lunch room, and '
said the boiler was buried under that.
Inquiry brought out the fact that the
boiler and furnace had formerly been
used to heat the school with steam, but
had been abandoned. They were placed
in a pit which had become filled with
stagnant water, a constant menace to
the health of the children. Complaint
was made to the directors and O'Brien
w;is ordered to remove boiler and fur
nace and fill in the pit. Instead of d,o
in"g so, he had a little dirt thrown on j
top of the boiler, leaving a great cavity j
underneath the surface, which remain- j
ed filled with the disease breeding I
water. Then, to cover up his work â
or lack of work â and to use up some
more shingles and lumber, he built the
shed over the quagmire, for which the
only use that has been found is to give
the teachers a place to prepare their
midday lunch.
Only five schools were visited yester
day, but those five bore evidence of the
city having been robbed of many thou
sands of dollars, and all within a period
of six months. What the other schools
will show can hardly be guessed at,
but the committee of the Grand Jury,
with the experts, will visit them all.
At present the investigation will be
confined to the lumber contract. When
the full extent of that job has been
revealed light will be thrown on the
other supplies furnished the depart
ment.
DIED IN A DEN
OF BAD REPUTE
Probability That Conrad Mase
mann Was Drugged to
Death.
Police Engaged in Working on a
Case That Is Involved in
Mystery.
On the 16th of the present month Con
red H. Maseman. a stranger in this city,
was found dead in bed in a room in the
White House at 414 Jackson street, a
place not of good repute.
In his vest pocket were found two pow
ders, supposed at the time to be mor
phine, and on various scraps of paper
there were writings In pencil purporting
to have been signed by the deceased an
nouncing that he had ended his life be
cause some woman had robbed him of
every cent he had.
An inquest on the remains was held
by Coroner Hawkins yesterday morning
and it was developed that the man had
died from morphine poisoning, and that
the powders found on his person were
not morphine but anti-febrine. a compar
atively harmless preparation for the cure
of headache.
The authorities, because of this fact
and the further fact that the house was
the resort of lewd women of the lowest
class and of thieves and vagrants, sus
pected foul play, and Detective Silveywas
detailed to work upon the case. Mr. Sil-
Vey .testified yesterday that the manager
of the lodging- house threw obstacles In
the way ot a thorough Investigation, and
was very surly about it. The house had
a bad reputation, he said.
Officer Mi-Mahon said that the White
House was a resort 'of "bums," thieves
and toughs, and that not long ago an
ex-convict had been shot by a woman in
the house.
Rudelle told the same story already
published In The Call to the effect that
the deceased came in at 2 in the morning
with a strange woman and paid 50 cents
for a room. He did not see the woman
leave the house and did not see the de
ceased again until he broke open the door
on the following day and found him dead
in bed.
J. Schroeder. the bedmaker, told about
having knocked at the door of the room
occupied by Mnsemann, and having found
It locked. On the next forenoon he and
Rudelle broke open the door and saw the
dead body.
The jury found the following verdict:
"We, the Jury, do find that Conrad H.
Masemann, age about 50 years, nativity
Germany, occupation butcher, married,
residence New iork. came to his death
April 16. ISPS, at 414 Jackson street, city
and county of San Francisco, from mor
phine poisoning, and we further find that
he came to his d^ath by morphine p imin
istered by a party or parties unknown
to the jury. The character of the house
being bad" the police should Investigate
and the license be revoked if possible." M
