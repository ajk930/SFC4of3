The rebels continue to harass the
.; Spaniards in the forts around
Manila. Several sharp skirmishes
..'' have taken place, but only a few
men were killed' on either side.
â  General Merritt arrived on the
. steamer Newport at noon on the
; 25th, exchanging calls with Ad
, miral Dewey and receiving a sa
lute of guns from the flagship.
:. The boys of the Astor Battery
-. report that the trip was devoid of
'V incident. All are well and anx
ious to disembark. The camp
â equipage went ashore early this
morning.
A recent, incident shows the
present status of the situation.
The McCrlloch being ordered to
the north side of the bay, started
on her course, which would have
taken her close in front of the
city batteries. Admiral Dewey,
who was entertaining the Belgian
Consul aboard the flagship, told
the flag lieutenant to make a sig
nal for the McCulloch's recall,
saying he would not allow her to
go so close to the Spanish guns
as to appear like bravado and
thus possibly cause the Spaniards
to attack her. The admiral said
General Augusti had kept his
promise not to open fire on our
ships and he would not permit
our vessels to disturb the status
quo.
The Belgian Consul asked
whether he was at liberty to men
. tion Dewey's remarks to Augusti
when he returned to Manila.
Having told August], the Consul
. returned aboard the Olympia the
next day and informed the ad
miral that the captain general
said he regarded him as a gallant
officer and a man of honor, whom
he would like to meet. Now that
the Monterey is so near here the
captain general will probably
soon have his wish gratified.

The remaining transports are expect
ed to arrive to-morrow. The fleet saw
nothing of the monitor Monterey and
t'.ie collier Brutus, and it is supposed
that the monitor is coaling at Guam
Island.
The troops encamped at Paranajo
have not yet made a move, the con
dition of the country between the camp
and the outskirts of Manila being such,
on account of the heavy rains that
have fallen, as to make It impossible
to advance. The insurgents are still
active, but are accomplishing nothing.
SPANISH PRIDE NO
LONGER RAMPANT
MANILA, July 25, via Hongkong,
July 30.â The Spaniards are gradually
realizing that Spain has not been vic
torious; that the expected reinforce
ments are not coming, and that the
contest is utterly hopeless. The insur
gents are in overwhelming numbers
and the Spaniards can only obtain the
bare necessities of life.
Only a fortnight ago SpanLsh na
tional pride was rampant, but it is
now merging into indignation at
Spain's feebleness and regret that they
were born Spaniards. While they will
never surrender without a fight, the
Spanish officers will jump at the first
honorable opportunity to surrender.
Thpy fear national disgrace too much
to give in without a fight.
The fighting in the suburbs is desul
tory and the Americans are idle. This
has given rise to a report that they
had determined to suspend operations
until September, and by that time
p^ace will probably be concluded. Then,
it is asserted here, the Americans may
permanently annex the Caroline Is
lands and the Ladrones, and possibly
abandon the Philippines with the ex
ception of keeping a coaling station
here.
Although the insurgents have redou
bled their efforts they have hitherto
been unable to capture the citadel. On
the other hand, the Spaniards are not
able to re-establish their suzerainty.
Under the circumstances it seems evi
dent that somebody must Interfere in
the name of humanity. Some insur
gent shells have been thrown into the
citadel, but they do not appear to have
done much damage. The natives are
reported to be starving by thousands
and the Europeans are also hard
pressed for food.
. MANILA. July 22. via Hongkong,
July :30.: 30.â Conversation with a consid
erable number of natives failed to dis
close the existence of any perceptible
anti-American feeling among the Phil
lppinans. These people are apparently
satisfied to accept annexation to the
United States. Their principal desire is
for a peaceful existence with the min
imum of * trouble. They, however,
earnestly wish the abolition of oppres
sion incident to Spanish otticial rapac
ity and the tyranny of the religious
bodies. The natives have no objection
to the church apart from the orders of
friars. They are scarcely interested in
any particular form of government, but
only desire to be left alone.

PRINCE OTTO YON BISMARCK
BISMARCK'S
MORTAL LIFE
HAS CLOSED
The End of the Iron Chancellor
Came After Several Hours
of Unconsciousness.
BERLIN, July 30.â Prince Bismarck
died shortly before 11 o'clock to-night.
Details of the death of Prince Bis
marck are obtained with difficulty, be
cause of the lateness of the hour, the
isolation of the castle and the stren
uous endeavors of the attendants of the
family to prevent publicity being given
to what they consider private details.
The death of the ex-Chancellor comes
as a surprise to all Europe.
Despite the family's denials, there
was an undercurrent of apprehension
when the sinking of the Prince was
first announced, inspired more by what
the family left unpublished than by
any information given. But when the
daily bulletins chronicled improve
ments in the Prince's condition, detail
ed his extensive bills of fare and his
devotion to his pipe, the public ac
cepted Dr. Schweninger's assertion that
there was no reason why Bismarck
should not reach the age of 90.
The reports were deemed to be a
repetition of the alarm that Prince
Bismarck was in extremis, which had
been oft repeated in the past. All of
the Saturday papers in Europe dis
missed Bismarck with a paragraph,
while his condition was completely
overshadowed in the English papers by
the Prince of Wales' condition.
It appears that the ex-Chancellor's
death was not precipitated by sudden
complications, but was rather the cul
mination of chronic disease â neuralgia
of the face and inflammation of the
veinsâ which kept him In constanc
pain, and which was borne with the
iron fortitude which might have been
expected. . ' : â  -''â â -â 
The beginning of the end dates from
July 20, when the Prince was confined
to his bed. He had â  been several days
prostrated \ before an , Inkling of t his de
cline reached the world. /; ; T-\
On Friday Dr. Schweninger said:
"For the past nine, days I have ; hardly
changed . my clothes, m having traveled
nearly all the time i between Berlin and
Friedrichsruhe, ;as â , you c may notice ">â  by
my shabby velvet Jacket." 7
He then declared that ; his ; patient's
lung stomach and kidneys were sound,
in fact, that his whole gigantic frame
was sound. "As yet," said Dr. Schwen
inger, "there is no calcification of the
blood vessels, but the pains in his face
and legs worry him and shorten hir>
sleep."
Dr. Schweninger added this verdict:
"With his extraordinary robust nature,
he may, excluding complications, reach
ninety."
During Dr. Schwenlnger's brief ab
sence from Friedriehsruhe, Dr. Chry
sander was in ' constant attendance
upon the patient.
Although Prince Bismarck was ex
tremely low on "Wednesday, he so ral
lied on Thursday that he was wheeled
to the dinner table to celebrate with his
assembled family the fifty-first anni
versary of his wedding. He never for
a moment believed himself in danger
until the last day. On Monday he or
dered some new pipes and smoked one
on Thursday, then conversed brilliantly
on the topics of the day, discussing the
trial and sentence of M. Zola and the
peace negotiations between Spain and
United States.
Count yon Rantzau, the Prince's son
in-law, read to him from a newspaper
an obituary notice of himself at which
he was. greatly amused. He perused
the papers daily, and this was one rea
son why the family deprecated the
alarming reports as to his health.
The French press showed unabated
enmity when discussing his possible
death. The Temps compared his end
with that of Gladstone, remarking that,
though the British statesman had
failed in his policy and had compro
mised his party, he died resrretted by
a.ll on account of the grandeur of his
moral influence; whereas. Prince Bis
marck, whose life had been successful,
would perish execrated by many, even
in Germany, and Inquired grimly:
"What sort of a funeral will be given
him by the millions of socialists who
have been hatched by his tyrannical
laws?"
The Lokal Anzelger publishes a dis
patch from Friedriehsruhe saying that
Dr. Schwenlnger was present when
Prince Bismarck died, having arrived
from Berlin at 10:30 o'clock.
The Prince was unconscious for sev
[ era! hours before tbe end came and his
breath almost failed repeatedly. He
died without a struggle.
SKILLED IN DIPLOMACY
AND A MILITARY GENIUS
History of Prince Bismarck's Life a
Record of Continuous
Successes.
Prince Bismarck came of an old and
distinguished family, many of whose
members attained prominence in mili
tary and political life. He was born
on April 1, 1815, at Schonhausen, in
Brandenburg. His father's family be
longed to the lower nobility, and his
mother was the daughter of Ludwlg
Menken, Privy Counselor of Frederick
the Great and a very liberal minded
man.
At the early age of six years Otto
Edward Leopold Bismarck-Schonhau
sen â for such was the full name of the
future unifier and ruler of the destinies
of the German empireâ was placed In
a boarding-school in Berlin, and at
twelve he entered a gymnasium, where
his character, thoughts and methods
of life were molded to a great extent by
Dr. Provost and Dr. Bonnell, who took
more than ordinary interest in the
lad. He made wonderful advances in
history, his favorite study, and rapidly
acquired a practical knowledge of Eng
lish and French, surprising in later
years both Lord Beaconsfield and
Napoleon 111 with the fluency with
which he used those languages.
While pursuing his studies with
great avidity he did not neglect his
physical development. He was an ar>
dent devotee of all manly sports, in
many of which he acquired a wonder
ful degree of proficiency. This was
particularly true in regard to swords
manship. At the age of 17 he entered
the law department of the University
of Gottingen, where he had a supera
bundance of practice as a swordsman.

IT REMAINS FOR
MADRID CABINET
TO END THE WAR
As Plenipotentiary for the Cas
tilians the French Diplo
mat Acts.
After Prolonged Argument With the Pres
ident, All the Conditions Imposed
! Are Agreed To.
WASHINGTON, July 30.â Events of a mos!
momentous character occurred at the confer
ence at the White House this afternoon between
the President, Embassador Cambon of France
and Secretary Day, carrying the peace negotia
tions far beyond the mere submission or term*
of peace by the United States and reaching the
point of a preliminary basis of peace betweer
the Government of Spain and the Government
of the United States, needing only the ratifica
tion of the Madrid Cabinet in what was done to
day to bring the war to an end.
This was accomplished on the part of Spain when Embas
sador Cambon presented to the President credentials he had re
ceived from the Spanish Government appointing him envoy ex
traordinary and minister plenipotentiary with complete instruc
tions as to the manner of acting upon every one of the peace
conditions presented by the United States, including the dispo
sition of Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, the Ladrones, in
demnity, armistice and all other questions likely to arise in the
course of the negotiations.
With these credentials authorizing him to speak as pleni
potentiary for the Government of Spain, and with full instruc
tions on ever>- point at issue, Embassador Cambon, in behalf of
Spain, not only received the peace conditions laid down by the
American Cabinet earlier in the day, but thereupon entered
upon their discussion with a view to reaching a final and
complete agreement. After strong argument, the President
and Secretary Day consented to a modification of the American
tern>3 in one particular â what that modification relates to is not
disclosed, but it is believed not to apply to the condition for
the absolute independence of Cuba, the cession of Porto Rico
or the granting of adequate coaling stations to the United
States in the Pacific or to diminish in any vital particular the
terms on which peace will be restored. The modification
brought about practical unanimity between the President and
Embassador Cambon as plenipotentiary for Spain, and the lat
ter has now transmitted the results of the conference to Ma
drid for approval, which, if given, will end the war.
The profoundly important results developed to-day came
about most unexpectedly. Embassador Cambon's call was set
for 2 o'clock, and it was expected to last but a few minutes,
while the answer of the United States was being handed to
him. But since the original proposition of Spain was presented
last Tuesday M. Cambon has prepared himself to speak with
authority on the questions which were to arise. The President
has preferred this course, although outside of himself and the
Embassador few were aware that the latter came ready to treat
as the envoy of Spain. The first instructions to M. Cambon
made him merely a medium of communicating Spain's first
note; now he appeared with all the attributes of a direct diplo
matic officer of Spain, empowered to act for the Government
within his very complete instructions.
The meeting was held in the President's library, and both
in the subjects discussed and in the impressive manner in which
the argument proceeded it was a conference destined to be
come memorable. After M. Cambon had presented his creden
tials as plenipotentiary and they had been examined and his
status recognized as the envoy of Spain, the first business was
the presentation of the terms laid down by the United States.
Secretary Day read the terms, pausing at the end of each sen
tence to allow M. Thiebault, first secretary of the French Em
bassy, to interpret it into French, as the Embassador's knowl
edge of English is limited. This reading by Secretary Day and
interpreting by M. Thiebault took but fifteen minutes.
Then began the discussion, point by point. The President
and the Embassador addressed each other directly with the
greatest freedom and frankness, each stoutly maintaining the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.2
justice of his position on the several points involved. When, at
last, after an eloquent plea by the Embassador, it was agreed
to modify the conditions in one particular, Secretary Day
withdrew for half an hour and attended to drafting the modifi
cation. This accomplished, the Embassador addressed himself
to the President, not so much as the advocate of Spain, but
personally, having with the President, man for man, a like in
terest in humanity. M. Cambon is a man of fervid eloquence,
and he spoke with an intensity of feeling which made a deep
impression on the President and the others present. He spoke
yin French, each sentence being caught up and interpreted by
M. Thiebault with rapidity, so that the earnestness of the Em
bassador's expression lost little by this indirect method of com
munication. The President spoke with equal frankness and in
the lengthy discussion there was scarcely a point in the whole
range of the war which was not met and freely considered.
What the modification is that has been agreed upon can
only be conjectured, -but there is reason to believe that it relates
either to the time when actual hostilities will be suspended, or
else to the extent of our interest in the Philippines, leaving un
changed the condition that Spain shall withdraw from Cuba and
Porto Rico, grant the United States coaling stations in the
Pacific and make important concessions in the Philippines.
It is now for the Madrid Government to give final ap
proval to what was partially accomplished to-day. It is even
possible that this approval may come very speedily, within a
day or two, for there is no need of extending conferences or
correspondence. All that was accomplished to-day, when M.
Cambon acted as plenipotentiary. From the fact that he acted
under instructions, the prospect would seem to be hopeful for
Spain's ratifying what has been done. But it is for Spain
herself to determine between the issue of peace or war as now
presented.
CONDITIONS OF PEACE
AGREED TO BY CAMBON AS
SPAIN'S REPRESENTATIVE
They Include the Freedom of Cuba, the Cession
of a Ladrone Island and Porto Rico,
With the Philippines Held in
Abeyance.
WASHINGTON, July 30.â After a day of anxious deliberation and Im
portant consultations, the reply of the United States Government to the
Spanish overture for peace was at last this afternoon placed in the hands
of M. Cambon, the French Embassador, to be by him transmitted to the
Government of Spain. It was half past 4 o'clock before the Minister re
ceived the answer, and as it makes about 1100 words in all, and must be re
duced to the diplomatic cipher and then transmitted by cable, the Madrid
authorities probably will not receive it until some time to-morrow, Sunday.
At half-past 10 o'clock this morning-, in accordance with the agree
ment reached yesterday, the members of the Cabinet began to
assemble at the White House, but it was nearly 11 o'clock be
fore they were all present and r^ady to resume their discussion at
the point where it was interrupted by adjournment. Secretary Day had
prepared a draft of the answer on the expressions of his colleagues in the
Cabinet yesterday, and it was hoped that only a short time would be con
sumed in going over this and giving It formal approval. It turned out other
wise, however. Probably over night new factors had suggested themselves,
or fresh influences had been brought to bear, for the Cabinet was soon en
gaged in an animated discussion of the Philippine Islands settlement.
On the other points of the answer there was no disagreement, and
these propositions were ratified as they stood yesterday, namely:
Cuba to be freed.
Porto Rico to be ceded to the United States.
One of the Ladrone Islands (.probably Guam) to be ceded to the
United States as a coaling station.
All Spanish military forces in the West Indies to be immediately
withdrawn, with the formal relinquishment by Spain of her sovereignty
over any possessions among those islands.
As to the Philippines the Cabinet agreed upon the following
points: That Manila Bay, with the city and surrounding territory,
should be retained in the possession of the United States, at least for
such a length of time as is necessary to devise and put in. operation
some plan for the future government of the group.
After that point, the main divergence of opinion began, and all sorts
of propositions were put forward and urged by individual members as the
best means of dealing with the future of the islands. In the very midst
of the discussion the element that had strongly urged the necessity of pro
tecting Aguinaldo in any settlement we should arrange received a severe
check through the receipt of a cablegram from Admiral Dewey, stating
that the insurgent chief had assumed a defiant attitude and expressing the
opinion that the United States would be obliged to make war upon the in
surgents, necessitating the presence of 150,000 troops to subdue the
islands. While this did not bring about a complete dismissal of the propo
sition to take the insurgents into account in settling the terms of peace, It
did have the effect to cause an agreement upon the proposition to defer ac
tion upon the question as to the disposition of the islands until the other
phases of the peace negotiations have been satisfactorily adjusted, mean-
Ing by that that the matter goes over until the last Spanish flag has disap
peared from the western hemisphere, and the American flag is hoisted to
stay over the coaling stations we require in Micronesia.
The discussion lasted two hours and a quarter before the Cabinet hit
upon the best course for the United States to adopt. It was finally decided
that what we desired could best be done by the appointment of a joint com
mission, limited in its representation to the Government of the United
States and Spain, which commission is to endeavor to settle the details of
the government of the Philippines and determine what treatment shall be
accorded the insurgents, the United States army and navy meanwhile oc
cupying Manila and Manila Bay, and thus retaining a position to force
speedily the verdict that shall be finally reached by the commission.
After the Cabinet meeting adjourned the members went off to their
luncheons "with a pleasant consciousness that they had succeeded In dis
posing properly of the very difficult problem.
Assistant Secretary John Moore, who had been called Into the meeting
at the last moment, went hastily to the State Department to put the
views of the President and Cabinet in the proper diplomatic form, and while
this was doing, notice was sent to the French Embassador that the Presi
dent would be pleased to hand him personally the reply of the United States
Government at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon. It was expected that this cere
mony would occupy only a few minutes and that the Embassador would
take the note and immediately hurry with It to his cipher clerks and then to
the telegraph office. In this expectation Assistant Secretary Moore went
out of town on an afternoon train, and Secretary Day, as he went to the
White House to meet the Embassador, took his gripsack into his carriage
In the firm expectation of being able to catch the 3:30 train for Atlantic
City to .meet his wife. The Embassador came on- time, accompanied by his
secretary, but as the minutes ran along into hours without the reappear
ance of M. Cambon, it was immediately surmised that something had hap
pened to disarrange the original plans for this meeting. It was after a stay
of two hours and a quarter that the French Embassador terminated his
visit.
While It continued, Secretary Long and Admiral Slcard of the Naval
War Board and Assistant Secretary Adee of the State Department were
â¢ailed into consultation. The newspapers had been led by promises made
Â«arlier in the day by members of the Cabinet to expect that a statement
would be given out, explaining the nature of the answer to Spain, but to the
disappointment of their representatives it was announced by Secretary Day
that this had been abandoned for the reason that to make any statement
at this point would Involve a serious breach of diplomatic etiquette that
might embarrass the future negotiations.
The extended stay of the Embassador with the President opened up a
wide field of conjecture, but in all official quarters thei3 was reticence as to
the nature of the discussion. From reliable quarters, however, it was
learned that the conference did not result In any change in the condi
tion already laid down, but that it was devoted to an explanation of them
In detail. It was said that no new condition of affairs had arisen by reason
of the Embassador's call and that there would be no need of another Cab
inet meeting to consider new factors. The case remained. It was said, as
fixed by the Cabinet early in the day, and the next move was to transmit
these terms to Spain and await her reply.
Immediately following the long conference the French Embassador and
M. Thlebault returned to the French Embassy and then began the hard work
of reducing to cipher the American peace conditions, together with the re
sults of the conference, and transmitting the same to Madrid. The Embas
sador was smiling and apparently well pleased with the result of the con
ference. All the staff of the Embassy were engaged on the cipher work as
It was a long and intricate process. Allowing the difference for the time
between Washington and Madrid, the terms could not reach the Spanish
capital before midnight to-night and would not get before the Spanish
Ministry before noon to-morrow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 81, 1898.
AMERICAN GUNS
MAY BE TURNED
ON AGUINALDO
Dewey Reports Tfyat the losur
gent Chief Is Becomiog
Defiant.
NEW YORK, July 30.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: From present dispatches received Aguinaldo and
his insurgent government in the Philippines may give Admiral Dewey
more trouble than the Spanish Governor General and his forces.
When the Cabinet was in session to-day considering an answer to
Spanish peace proposals a cablegram was received from Admiral
Dewey which was more disquieting than any that had previously
come from him. It indicated that Aguinaldo had assumed an atti
tude of defiance toward the American forces which might make it
necessary to fight him as well as the Spaniards if the Philippines
were to be taken.
In view of General Merritt's dispatch saying he would need all the
troops that had been assigned to him, and of Admiral Dewey's dis
patch telling of Aguinaldo's attitude and saying that the situation
was critical, it is probable that 4000 troops under orders for the Phil
ippines, who are still in this country, will be hurried forward as rap
idly as possible.
Aguinaldo was under promise to Admiral P^wey not to attack the
city of Manila before the Americans were reauy to occupy It. Offi
cials of tlie administration believe he will now attempt to take it. It
is not believed that General Merritt and Admiral Dewey will permit
this, and it may be necessary to turn the guns of the fleet upon the
insurgents.
STATESMEN DISCUSS
CONDITIONS OF PEACE
CLEVELAND, July 30.â Senator M.
A. Hanna, in response to an inquiry to
day as to what, in his judgment, should
be done with the Philippines, said:
"That is a big question and we must
go slowly. We at least want a footing
on those islands. Although there may
be a sentiment against keeping them,
there is a bigger sentiment against giv
ing them back to Spain. We are con
fronted with new conditions to-day and
v. c intend to work out the problems in
the manner which will be for the best
of the country."
Senator Hanna and his family leave
In a few days for a trip up the lakes
and to the Yellowstone Park.
CARSON, New, July 30.â Senator
William M. Stewart, in reference to the
teims of peace now being considered at
Washington, says:
"The terms of peace should be the
withdrawal of all Spanish troops from
Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines and
all other Spanish islands in the Pacific
and the absolute relinquishment by
Spain of all right or claim of sovereign
ty in such islands. What disposition is
to be made of these provinces must be
determined by the United States un
trammeled in a treaty of peace. The
United States should dictate, not nego
tiate, the terms of peace, the same as
Germany did to France. If Spain would
absolutely withdraw all claim to the
islands within the influence of our pres
ent military operations, I would expect
no further indemnity, but if s she contin
ues the war, our claims, as fcompensa
tion. must be enlarged for the expense
which the United States would suffer
from her folly."
LINWOOD, Kans., July 30.â 0n the
question of the terms of peace between
the United States and Spain Senator
W. A. Harris says: "The favorite
game of the Spaniard is diplomatic
quibbling. We can tolerate no tem
porizing policy. We must have free
Cuba recognized, with no load of debt
or obligations for Spanish bonds;
Porto Rico for our own, and an ab
solutely free hand In the Philippines.
I would be generous as to Avar indem
nity if an immediate and prompt ac
ceptance of these demands is conceded.
I would not have the Philippines as
American territory on any terms if it
can be avoided. I would afford them
an opportunity to govern themselves,
or we might consider some guaranteed
form of autonomy und^r Spanish sov
ereignty for a final settlement with an
adequate naval station for ourselves;
but there should not be a moment's
halt in the forward movement till the
acceptance of these terms."
DES MOINES, lowa, July 30.âCon
gressman Hull, chairman of the House
Committee on Military Affairs, is 'n
town. He has just returned from the
Republican Congressional Convention
at Knoxville, by which he was renom
inated for another term. In regard to
the disposal of the Philippine Islands
he said it appeared probable that they
would be returned to Spain.
"It will be hard to do this," he add-
Ed, "when It is remembered that tl\e
Philippine insurgents, In marked dis
tinction to the Cuban insurgents, have
proved themselves fighters and have
assisted Dewey in every possible way.
Personally, I would favor retaining all
the territory ye have captured, and I
know there is a large and growing ele
ment in our country which holds to the
same belief."
SAGASTA'S CONFIDENCE
IN SECURING PEACE
NEW YORK, July 30.â A World spe
cial from Madrid under date of July 29
says: Premier Sagasta is very confi
dent of securine peace because of Pres
ident McKlnley's conciliatory disposi
tion. He declared explicitly that he
has received telegrams stating that the
President has consented virtually to
negotiations on the basis proposed by
Spain.
That means that hostilities are to be
suspended In Cuba, the Philippines and
Porto Rico in order to negotiate a peace
treaty, starting from the vantage
ground that the chief, If not the only
object of the war, was a recognition of
Cuban independence.
ASKED TO RETAIN
THE PHILIPPINES
SEATTLE, July 30.â At a largely at
tended mass-meeting held by the citi
zens of Seattle and Walla Walla to-day
resolutions were adopted and forwarded
to President McKlnley praying" that the
Philippines be retained as a part of the
United States^
Of Interest to the Coast.

AMERICAN TROOPS WITHIN
AN HOUR OF MANILA
HONGKONG, July 30.â Letters re
ceived here from Cavite under date of
July 26 state that the insurgents have
done nothing since their second re
pulse at Malate, when the American
troops were held under arms through
fear of an attack by the Spaniards.
There are now 4800 American soldiers
within an hour of Manila, near Malate.
Their is protected by trenches
and guns and is covered by the guns
of the cruiser Boston and the Callao
from the sea.
The American transports, it is said,
will start on their return to San Fran
cisco in a few days. There is no sick
ness among the troops.
It Is believed that Governor General
Augustl will surrender, owing to the
fact that Admiral Camara's squadron
has returned to Spain, but the army
officers desire to resist to the last, and
there is a prospect that peace will be
concluded prior to the capture of Ma
nila by the Americans.
CONQUEST OF PORTO
RICO HAS BEGUN
VERY AUSPICIOUSLY

Consul Hanna Urges the Spanish Commander
in Chief to Yield in the Name
of Humanity.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Thursday, July
28 (via St. Thomas, D. W. L, July 29).â
The conquest of Porto Rico has begun
auspiciously. The Spanish have aban
doned Ponce, the principal port on the
southern coast of the island and in
many respects its most progressive city.
Among the prizes found in the harbor
were seventy lighters used in loading
sugar ships, and these were used in
stead of cutters to convey the troops
ashore, during which operation not a
man or animal was injured.
The scene when the soldiers reached
the p.'borves along the water front was
remarkable. Thousands of residents of
the city, men, women and children,
lined the water front and shouts of joy
and cries of "Viva los Americanos!"
"Buenos Dias!" "Puerto Rico Libre!"
greeted them. The soldiers were re
ceived like liberators, rather than in
truders. The red-shirted firemen came
down to the wharf in a body and
cheered lustily. Captain Lyons, with
Company X of the Sixteenth Regiment,
immediately marched to the city and
established a provisional guard in the
municipal building, the soldiers being
billeted in the frescoed and gold deco
rated loom of the Alcalde.
On every hand the greatest satisfac
tion was evidenced. Women adorned
themselves in their brightest gowns
and waved their hands and smiled as
the troops marched through the
streets. Public vehicles did a thriving
business in conveying the curious to the
harbor to view the American ships. The
doors of the merchant houses were
opened and the whole city presented
the appearance of a fete. The poor are
especially rejoiced.
The City of Ponce is romantic and
p.cturesque with buildings of ola Moor
ish and Spanish architecture. Its broad
plaza and blue, pink and green tinted
hues present a pleasing appearance,
and its streets are clean and well paved.
The inhabitants are mostly native
Porto Ricans, a well-defined race, re
BISMARCK'S
MORTAL LIFE
HAS CLOSED
Continued from First Page.
fighting twenty-eight duels in the
course of three semesters, or eighteen
months. In all of these encounters he
drew blood from his opponents, and
was himself only once wounded. The
mark of that wound he ever after car
ried. It was on his left cheek.
Entering the University of Berlin in
1533, Bismarck soon after passed the
requisite examination for professional
life. However, he did not take up the
practice of law, but retired to his es
tates in Pomerania, and there remained
quietly for several years, occupying
himself in guarding the family prop
erty interests.
It was not until 1547 that Bismarck
began to attract some public attention.
He was elected to the Prussian House
of Burgesses, taking his stand as an
ultra-loyalist. In ISSI he was chosen a
representative of the new German diet
of Frankfort. This was the actual.be
ginning of his renowned public career.
At once displaying the most remarka
ble mental activity and manifesting a
wonderful grasp of affairs of state, he
clearly stated his views and distinctly
set forth the chief characteristics of
his most important political doctrines.
He made a most marked impression,
and the result was that he at once be
gan exercising a strong influence
among his colleagues. He mapped out
a policy, which he ever afterward con
sistently and closely followed. He
boldly opposed all revolutionary meas
ures and ever having in view the best
interests of Prussia, he boldly demand
ed that that country should have the
same right in the Diet as had Austria.
Recalled from the Diet in 1859, Bis
marck was sent as Minister to Russia.
At the court of St. Petersburg he soon
became an adept in the art of diplo
macy. His ability as a diplomat was
recognized, and in order to give him a
thorough insight into French politics
he was transferred to Paris in the
spring of 1862. In the fall of that year
he was recalled and given the portfolio
of foreign affairs, and was made pres
ident of the Cabinet.
The reorganization of the army was a
measure that caused a great deal of
turbulence in the Parliament, which
time and again refused to pass the
needed appropriations. Bismarck re
peatedly dissolved the Parliament, and
finally to bring matters to a decided
issue he notified that body that the
Government would proceed to reorgan
ize the army without its sanction.
Bismarck carried his point. The army
was reorganized, although during four
sessions the Parliament declined to
vote its sanction, and upon each occa
sion was dissolved.
Upon the death of the King of Den
mark, Bismarck seized the opportunity
to aggrandize Prussia by claiming the
Schleswig-Holstein Duchies for the
Duke of Augustinburg, the idea being
to incorporate them with Germany. The
occupation of these duchies brought on
the war between Prussia and Austria,
and at the battle of Koniggratz, in
1866, Austria was overwhelmingly de
feated. Prussia, under the skillful
guidance of Bismarck, now assumed
the leadership of the North German
confederation, from which Austria was
excluded.
The success of this strategic move
ment made Bismarck the most popular
man in Germany. He had been univer
sally disliked up to the culmination of
the war with Austria. He was given
full credit for all that resulted from
that conflict. Prussia's sudden ad
vancement to the front rank as a mili
tary nation was not only offensive but
alarming to the French, who seized
upon the first slight pretext for declar
ing war.
The war of 1870-71 intensified the na
tional feeling among the Germans, and
Bismarck, taking advantage of the
situation, carried out his ideas of uni
fication, the result being the new Ger
man empire. It was Bismarck who dic
tated the terms of peace with France,
recovering to Germany Alsace-Lor
raine and an indemnity of one billion
dollars.
Bismarck, who had been made a
suiting from a blending of Sranish and
original Caribs, with a sprinkling of
foreigners, mostly French and Ger
mans, and a few English and Ameri
cans.
All the approaches to the rity are
carefully guarded to-night. General
Henry will effect a juncture with Gen
eral Wilson here as soon as possible,
and our troops will await the arrival
of other troops now on the way. The
military road to San Juan is broad and
well beaten, and will offer no difficulty
to the passage of artillery and supply
trains, as did the soprgy and almost un
broken trails of Cuba to the advance of
General Shafter.
General Miles and General Wilson,
with their staffs, accompanied by the
British, French, German and Danish
Consuls, called upon the Alcalde this
afternoon. The latter gave them a
gracious welcome and asked to be ad
vised as to General Miles' desires with
regard to the government of the city.
General Miles informed him that it was
not his purpose to interfere in any way
with the local government and advised
tho Alcalde to conduct his administra
tion as usual. He said, however, that
all persons having arms given by the
Spanish must give them up or be
treated as enemies. The Alcalde said
that this should be done.
At the conclusion of the conference,
which was brief, the American officers
stepped to the balcony of the munici
pal building overlooking the plaza,
where several thousand people, includ
ing the Fire Department and a number
of bands, were assembled. The crowd
cheered General Miles and the Ameri
can Ajands played national airs.
Surgeon Greenleaf said to-day that
there was no yellow fever in Ponce or
its vicinity, but that there are a few
cases of smallpox.
United States Consul Hanna, -who is
a personal friend of Captain General !
Macias, telegraphed to the latter to- I
day, advising him to wire the Madrid
government to surrender in the name
of humanity, as the Americans are
certain of victory.
Count in 1866, was now created Prince
and Chancellor of the German empire.
The Chancellor's aim now -was to se
cure for the empire a long term of
peace and prosperity. Here again he
showed himself a master of diplomacy. !
He succeeded in isolating France and
formed strong alliances between Ger
many and other powers. He united Ger
many, Austria and Italy in a triple
alliance â a combination that even a I
union between France and Russia '
would not be able tp overcome. He !
entered upon a long and bitter con- j
filet with the Vatican, whose power he
believed to- be dangerous to the Gov- I
eminent, but he was finally obliged to i
somewhat modify his policy toward the
Church of Rome.
In inaugurating the career of Ger
many as a colonizing power in 1884,
Bismarck brought himself into brief
conflict with Gladstone, who was then j
the English Premier. Bismarck never '
forgot to keep France isolated. That
waa the main object of his foreign pol- !
icy. He also kept Europe in a peaceful !
state by combining the central powers
into a peace league. This was to coun
teract any aggressiveness on the part
of Russia and France, either singly or
combined.
Early in 1890 the "Iron Chancellor"
retired from public life, owing to differ
ences of opinion between Emperor
William II and himself. In 1894, how
ever, they became reconciled, and upon
the occasion of Bismarck's eightieth
birthday, in 1895, the Emperor visited
the famous statesman and cordially
participated in the celebration of the ;
event.
The German soldiers and officers fair
ly worshiped Bismarck, who never sev
ered his connection with the army. He
took more pride in being a soldier than
in all the honors and decorations that
were showered upon him by the poten
tates of the world.
Bismarck very seldom appeared in
public without uniform and sword. He
was rarely seen in citizen's dress. The
students saw in him the German rep
resentative, and endeavored to imitate
him.
In September, 1897, The Call published
an interesting article on Bismarck,
written by William Lodtman, and a
copy of the paper was sent to the writ
er's mother in Hamburg, who forward
ed it to the Prince of Friedrichsruhe.
The following reply was received:
"Esteemed Mrs. Major: His High
ness received your kind letter, with
copy of San Francisco Call, and has
authorized me to convey his thanks to
you.
"His Highness has read the article
written by your son with great ijiter
est. and is touched and gratified that
whatever a kind Providence has per
mitted him to contribute to the welfare
of our common fatherland is so feel
ingly expressed in a Journal printed in
the English language on the far-off Pa
cific Coast.
."His Highness begs that his grate
ful acknowledgments be transmitted
to the writer and to the journal. I
am, Mrs. Major, your obedient serv
ant, V. BOHLEN,

LONDON, July 30.â The Marquis of
Lome in reply to a request that he
write a few words upon the subject of
an Anglo-American rapprochement sent
me the following note. B.'th on ac
count of the Marquis' personal rank
and his position as the Queen's son-in
law, and also his knowledge of trans-
Atlantic affairs, due to his residence in
Canada as Governor General from 1878
to ISS3, this note is peculiarly interest
ing. The Marquis of Lome says:
"I always have worked for a thor
ough understanding t\ith the United
1 hope to do so during the
rest of my days. There are great com
mon interests to unite us, and nothing
that rises above the level of compara
tive trifles to divide us. In China, for
Instance, at the present moment, we
have mutual interests and we should
pu?h along together there and else
where."
I have with a certain measure of suc
cesa obtained the views of the English
y.l â :.- pate on Angle-American rap
tement. Am mg the most impor
tant communications is one from Right
Rev. Mandell Crelghton, D. D., Bishop
of London, considered by many the
rr. Bt eminent divine in the British
Episcopate and looked upon as the fu
"ture Archbishop of Canterbury. His
lordship's note strikes a note of new
>ls. and Is as follows:
"The future will not be so much con
cerned with nations as with the civiliz
ing influences which they contribute to
the world's progress. The question for
v? Is, what will be the future civilizing
Ideas which are common to the Eng
lish-speaking people? Local forms and
modifications are of little moment. The
Important thing is the value of ideas
themselves. The future of the world
depend? upon the good understanding
between England and the United States.
If they cannot teach each other how
are they to teach other peoples?"
Right Rev. K. C. Kyle, D. D..
Biatiop vC Liverpool, Is also a
member of the Anglo - American
League. He wrote as follows to the
request for a few words of personal
opinion upon the movement:
I thank you for your letter. I have
been much gratified by the rist and
continued progress, good feeling and
friendship between England and the
United States of America. I trust It
Will grow and ir.crease. Reading the
Bame Pible and speaking the same lan
guage, we ought always to be friend
ly-"
The Bishop of Ripon's answer was
as follows:
"I am rejoiced at the signs of better
feeling between the United States of
America anil this country. I trust the
cordial feeing? â which now exist may
be strengthened and extended as the
yoar? move on. I can foresee much
and lasting good from such friendship,
and believe all th<-'fie seeking to pro
it ar" working toward an end
vhich will bring good to mankind, and
t-i all who are engaged in this work
I â¢ lid Bay, 'Go on, in the name of

Th^ Bishop of Exeter wrote:

American Temper Yet

BERLIN, July 30. â The newspapers
here continue to misunderstand or mis
interpret the temper of the Americans.
ThejV assert that the latter are ready
for peace on almost any terms, pro
viding Cuba is granted independence,
and that the war is most unpopular,
especially in business circles; and in
spite of the phenomenal successes the
Americans have already secured, the
military editors continue To assert that
the United States will find it more and
more difficult to achieve an "ultimate
military success, especially in Cuba."
As a reason for the delay in pressing
the German merchants' claims for
damages which are alleged to have
arisen through the war in the Philip
pines, it is explained that the German
Government considers that to push the
claims now "while the Americans are
more or less incensed against Ger
many" would prejudice a favorable
settlement of the claims.
It is now certain that the Govern
ment will make a determined effort in
the coming Reichstag tv amend the
constitution in the direction of abridg
ing the franchise in beveral important
particulars, especially in raising the
age limit from 25 to 30 years. Not only
is the Conservative and reactionary
press vigorously advocating this as a
necessary step in fighting the increas
ing spread of socialism, but the Gov
ernment press has joined in the hue and
cry.
It is also certain that at the next
session of the Diet and Reichstag the
agrarians will vigorously assault Amer
ican agricultural products. The agrar
ians are now collecting a mass of evi
dence tending to show the injury which
has been caused to the home market
by the continued imputation of Amer
ican products. Among their arguments
they allege that 50 per cent of the
trichinosis in Germany is due to Amer
ican pork, although tht- .atter is omy
one-fortieth of the total German con
sumption. They also claim tha 1 : Amer
ican rork contains more trichinosis
than the German, a .d they allege thai
in spite of the fact that American pork
is officially testified to be free from
trichinae the Hamburg authorities have
officially reported 173 cases of American
trichinosis pork during the last six
months.
The Agrarians also assert that Amer
ican flour is arriving in a more and
more frequently grossly adulterated
condition, adding that the prevailing
medium of adulteration are mineral
ines, which, they assert, are openly ad
vertised in American trade papers.
Finally the Agrarians say that an
increasingly large percentage of Amer
ican canned and preserved meat of
every description is arriving in a state
unfit for human food. The Agrarians
claim to have abundant proof of their
allegations and will ask the Govern
ment to totally exclude from Germany
all the products mentioned.
The leading organ of the Agrarians,
the Deutsche Tages Zeitung, asks
whether, "in view of the fact tha:
America means to refuse Germany the
rights of the most favored nation, after
concluding a new tarhi. bargain with
France, the Government does not think
it time to open a spirited tariff war,"
pointing out, for one thing, the "Amer
ican bicycles ought to be taxed to a
prohibitory duty."
The recent general prohibition of
rnt-a-t imports has caused a rise in
prices and 150 butchers of Hamburg
and vicinity acknowledge their inabil
ity to sell meat except at 10 to 20 per
cent increase in price. A similar in
crease has already become effective in
Berlin.
The sensational suicide of General
yon Pechmann, the commander of the
Fifth Bavarian Cavalry Brigade, at
Dieuze, Lorraine, is much commented
upon. It is understood that his act is
due to depression, caused by the ma
levolence of a very high personage,
who has repeatedly defeated his ad
vancement to a higher rank.
All the principal comic papers in
Germany were confiscated this week on
account, of their publication of cartoons
ridiculing the Emperor and the police.
Some of these papers will be prose
cuted on the charge of lese majeste.
Herr Lleber, the Centrist leader, has
started for the United States.
While the quarrel between Emperor
William and the regent of Lippe-Det
mold Is only a storm in a teacup, over
a miserable question of court etiquette,
it has occupied the press to the exclu
sion of almost everything else.
A high official of the Ministry of the
Interior has briefly outlined the facts
in the case to the correspondent of the
Associated Press. They are as fol
lows:
The regent was already offended on
account of various alleged slights, for
which he blamed the Emperor, when
the general commanding the troops in
the principality ordered his soldiers
henceforth not to make the salute pre
scribed in the case of ruling sovereigns
or to show the customary marks of re
spect to the regent's family. The
regent, thereupon, deeming his rights
under the military convention of 1878
to have been slighted, appealed to the
Emperor in a personal letter for re
dress. This letter contained several pas
sages which were construed by his
Majesty to be purposely offensive,
â whereupon he sent the regent a tele
gram which traversed a dozen hands
and thence reached the newspapers
substantially verbatim. Th<*n followed
the deeply offended regent's appeal to
the sovereigns nf Germany and to the
Bundesrath. The rmitter Is expected to
remain In statu quo for some time.
The correspondent of tho Associated
Press learns from another source that
Emperor William's anger was particu
larly aroused by certain references In
the regent's letter to the Empress and
her family, a parallel being drawn on
the question of rank in both cases, and
his Majesty's !re was increased by the
fact that the Legislature of Llpne-Det

PARIS, July 30.â There is a strong
desire in French official circles to bring
about a complete resumption of the
pleasant relations with the United
States which existed previous to the
trouble between Spain and America,
and which were disturbed by French
newspaper utterances. It is pointed
out that the nearer the Spanish-Ameri
can war comes to a close the clearer it
is to sober-minded Frenchmen that
pu' Me opinion in America has been
mistaken in regard to the real opinion
and feeling of France toward the
United States. It is added that in
spite of what was written in the news
papers here or discussed in official cir
cles when the war began no doubt was
entertained anywhere in France as to
the result of hostilities. The weakness
and inferiority of Spain were so evi
dent that, it is claimed here, it would
be unfair now to assert that the Ameri
can victories have caused a change of
public opinion in France, and that the
French newspapers to-day think it
time to favor the conqueror.
In explanation of the tone of the
French press toward the United
States, it is said that the language used
by the newspapers at present is in sub
stance the same as was used three
months ago, and that the reason the
AmeiH-an people have been under the
impresFk.n that the French newspapers
were hosMle to the United States and
favorable to Spain is that only the l_'ss
sensible part of the French press was
quoted in the cable dispatches, while
such papers as the Journal de Debats,
the Figaro and the Temps and souie
others have not favored either side in
the v.ar antl have furnished their read
ers with honest accounts of the differ
ent features of the hostilities.
Continuing, it is argued that some of
the leading members of the French
press avm interviewed during the war,
and iheir statements leave no room for
doubt that they entertained a cordial
feeling toward the United States, while
French bi tiness men who were similar -
lv intsrvitwed were even more em
phatic in their expressions of friend
ship toward America.
Finally, the Frenchmen say that the
recent celebrati-m <>f the Fourth of
July here was the occasion of bringing
forth additional proof of the cordial
feeling entertained among Americans.
At the banquet of the American Cham
ber of Commerce there were many
prominent Frenchmen present, includ
ing some of the highesr\ state officials,
and It Marujoule, the Minister of
Commerce, speaking for the French
Government, said:
"We have been told that far away
on the other side of the Atlantic there
are those who have listened to calumni
ators In France who asserted that
France was forgetful of her duty and
that we have become not only adver
saries, but, according to some reports,
even discourteous toward America, I
protest against such an impression.
My word is sufficient to dispel such a
ridiculous idea, and I hope that the
echo of what I say will be carried from
this banquet hall to the other side of
the Atlantic as an indignant protest
against the false report as to the Eenti
ments of France toward America,
"But If this is not sufficient, let me as
sure your countrymen that not a day,
not an hour, not a minute has elapsed
during which the harmony which ex
ists between us has ever run the risk
of being broken. France has aJways
been for you a second country, and no
one knows better than your Embassa
dor and a Minister of the French Cab
inet the degree of cordiality manifested
in connection with our reciprocal rela
tions."
This rtatement of the French MiniJ
ter of Commerce is reproduced here, as
it is being freely used by Frenchmen
in their arguments tending to prove
that France has not been unfriendly
toward the United States in the war
with Spain.
They also argue that there Is no rea
son why France should side with Spain,
as during the past century there has
"been no common ideal" between the
two countries, and the Frenchmen of
to-day are not led by clerical consid
erations nor by the theory of so-called
Latin races, which, <t is further as
serted, is no longer taken seriously by
any sensible man. From a semi-of
ficial source the following statement
was made:
"From, a commercial standpoint,
France is as much interested in Amer
ican as in Spanish trade, and conse
quently she has no reason to jeopard
ize her friendly relations with the
United States. Still she feels sym
pathy for her unfortunate neighbor
and rejoices heartily at the fact that
peace is to be arranged and that the
French Embassador, M. Cambon. had
been the messenger of peace.
"As to the terms upon which peace
will be arranged, the French Govern
ment and public opinion in France are
perfectly aware that the United States
will no longer be satisfied with the
mere independence of Cuba, consider
ing that the war has cost her consid
erable. Consequently, the French
press, and especially the Journal dcs
Debats and Temps are already taking
into account that important element in
the settlement of peace. They only
hope that America will not claim too
much. Not that France feels envious
fn view of the Increasing power of the
United States, but simply because too
onerous conditions on the part of
America would make peace difficult.
In fact, it deserves to be pointed out
that France does not make any objec
tion to the United States increasing
either Its strength or its dominions.
The reason for the quiet feeling of
France In this matter Is that she Is
convinced that if such an Increase in
any way threatens European power
she is not that power.
"Even the annexation of Hawaii,
which gives* to the United States an
important possession In the Pacific, has
not disturbed France in the slightest
degree, her possessions In America he
ing small and unimportant, consisting:
of some little islands and French
Guiana. Therefore, she feels sure that

the following from Admiral
Sampson:
"PLAYA, July 29.â The In
fanta Maria Teresa, upon which
the wreckers are now engaged,
will be floated and brought to
Guantarvamo as soon as a small
leak Is located. It is somewhere
In the bow of the ship. Whether
this leak Is due to a small valve
being left open or to a hole
which may have been made in
the bow is not yet known. Her

the Americans, whom she considers to
be a practical people, will never think
of having trouble with a great Euro
pean power for such a trifling object.
"As to the Philippines, if those islands
are to be lost to Spain. France as the
ruler of Indo-China would probably
prefer having the Americans as next
door neighbors Instead of any Euro
pean or Asiatic power. Consequently
what France wants, so far as the
United States are concerned, is only a
proper consideration of her commercial
interests. In that respect 3he haa been
thoroughly reassured by the willing
ness the American Government dls
p'ayed on the occasion of the last com
mercial agreement, so she Is fall of con

Great Damage in Santa

TWO LARGE CONFLAGRATIONS
STAKDINO TIMBER AND CORD
WOOD DESTROYED.
Shingle Mill at Zyante Burned and
the Sunnyside Schooihouse
Threatened for a
Time.
Special DlÃpatch to ThÂ« Call.
SANTA CRUZ, July 30.â Two im
mense forest fires In this county are
doing tremendous damages. For two
weeks a fire has been burning about
eighteen miles from here in the Tim
othy Hopkins timber at the outer
edge of the Big Basin at Sunnyside.
Hundred of acres of the finest timber
land In the county has burned over, in
cluding tanbark, which has never been
cut from the trees.
The fire at times threatened the Sun
nyside schoolhouse, and only by hard
righting was the building saved. A
large gang of men has been fighting the
fire and in a measure has kept it from
spreading, but great damage has been
done. Beside the standing timber,
much corded wood has been destroyed.
The second conflagration Is about sb:
teen miles from here and is along the
Zyante. During the day clouds of
smoke can be seen issuing from the
canyons, while at night the flames can
be seen from this city. This forest fire
has covered about fifteen miles of ter
ritory along the Zyante. The sawmill
and shingle mill near Zyante were de
stroyed.
RED BLUFF, July 30.â Forest fires
are raging in the vicinity of Bee Gum,
Shasta County, and tho whole Sacra
mento Valley is shrouded by smoke.
These conflaf-ations occur almost
every year and are the result of set
ting fires to clear the land for farming
purposes. They soon become unman
ageable, with the result that thousands
of dollars' worth of valuable property
In timber and feed is destroyed. During
the past two days several thousand
acres have been burned over.
SALINAS. July 30.â The fire which
started In Chualar Canyon last
Wednesday was finally overcome this
morning. The loss will be very heavy
to stockraisers, as feed was totally de
stroyed on several ranches. The heav
iest losers are C. R. Esterbrook on 700,
J. H. Hebbron on 300, and Assessor Mc-
Phall of San Benito on 250 acres.
Everything in the pathway of the
flames was consumed.
HIGHLAND SPRINGS. July 30.â
Forest fires have been raging in the
vicinity of Highland Springs for sev
eral days, approaching dangerously
near. A large body of men turned out
to fight the destructive element, and
it is now practically under control. The
fire cau3ed trepidation among the
guests at the hotel, and many made
preparations to flee to a place of safety.
Many are departing In fear of a fresh
outbreak of the flames.
STOCKTON, July 30.â A chaparral
fire, terribly destructive, swept over
the foothills around Valley Springs
yesterday afternoon, the hungry flames
licking up every bit of vegetation in an
area estimated at fifteen miles square.
A heavy wind was blowing and the
flames moved over the parched ground
like an angry wave, leaving it black
and charredâ so barren, in fact, that a
crow cannot find sustenance there to
day.
Just where the fire started is not
known. The flames moved so rapidly
that the people had no time to prepare
to make a systematic fight. The people
found all they could do was to save
property by back firing, it being use
less to try to stay the line of fire, which
licked up barns, outhouses, fences, and
several dwellings.
The fire ran to within a half mile of
Valley Springs in several places and
but for the back firing would probably
have reached the settlement.
After nightfall the sight from Valley
Springs was one of awful grandeur.
Flam?s seemed to leap to the sky, run
ning hither and thither, wherever there
was a bit of fuel to be seized upon.
They would disappear down a ravine
and sweep up a hilltop a minute later
fiercer, ht-avier than ever. The coun
try- was as bright as day.
The officials have been investigating,
and are sure the fire was started by
prospectors with criminal disregard for
life and property. It is, of course. Im
possible to prospect chaparral land un
til it is cleared. The officers have a
clew tending to show that certain per
sons fired the country for this purpose.
If the clew proves correct It will go
hard with the men when they are ar
rested.
LOS ANGELES, July 30.â Forest
fires are now surging over the moun
tains west of Mount Lowe, in the vi
cinity of Millard Canyon.
Two representatives of the United
States Forestry Commission have gone
Into the mountains with a number of
men to fight the flames. Receiver Tor
rance of the Mount Lowe Railroad has
sent a force of men. The latest report
from the burning mountains says the
absence of wind has allowed the fire to
smolder and burn less fiercely.
GUESTS OF A REDDING
HOTEL ENDANGERED
Spontaneous Combustion Results in
a Conflagration in the Temple
House.
REDDING, July 30.â Fire was discov
ered on the second floor of the four-story
Temple Hotel at 4 o'clock this morning,
and but for the prompt action of Night
Clerk Ludwig in arousing the guests and
the admirable work of the Redding Fire
Department in checking the flames, many
lives would have been lost and the big
building destroyed. The fire started
through spontaneous combustion in a
pmall wood room on the second floor, orig-
I lnating in a barrel containing some refuse.
| including cotton batting saturated with
' oil. It got in Between the plastering and
the walls and spread along between the
I floors and the ceiling, making it difficult
â  for the department to cope with it. Two
! streams of water were poured into the
i building, doing much damage, but bring
i Ing the flames under control.
When the guests were awakened by the
cry of "Fire'" they rushed out into the
hallways !n their night clothes. Two men
went down the fire escape at the back of
the building.
The damage to the structure is esti
i mated at from $1000 to $1500. The build

WASHINGTON. July 30.â The Navy
Department has taken official notice of
the splendid achievements of the battle
ship Oregon. The ship's unequaled rec
ord of sustained speed on the long voy
age from San Francisco to Santiago
and the unsurpassed fighting qualities
displayed in the successful encounter
Aith Cervera'a fleet have elicited a let
from Secretary of the Navy Long to
l'nion Iron Works of San Fran-
The Secretary's tetter was written
shortly after the official accounts of the
â¢ â¢struction of Admiral Cervera's fleet
v/ere filed. The document mentions the
long cruise of the Oregon from Puget
Sound on the Pacific to Key West on
the Atlantic, and dwells with special
emphasis on the fact that no repairs
were needed at the finish of the unex
ampled run.
Not only does the letter compliment
the builders for the remarkable and
long sustained speed displayed on the
voyage of 14,000 miles, but especial
recognition is given the splendid abili
ties of the ship as shown in the swift
pursuit and successful engagement of
the formidable cruisers of the Spanish
navy that were seeking to escape from
Santiago.
The letter states that the department
for the first time writes to a ship-
building establishment commending the
work of construction, but considers
â that the notable results accomplished
by the Oregon Justify the special ac
knowledgment on the part of the Navy
Department of the United States.

to turn out warships equal to the best
and superior to the majority of foreign
ships. The Oregon's record reflects
credit to the nation; the Pacific Coast
Is Justly proud of its product; the con
structors are Jubilant over their suc
cess, and the builders, embracing the
mechanical experts, mechanics and
every man and boy whose brain work
or conscientious manual labor produced
this magnificent ship, are, also, proud of
their work.
The three battleshipsâ the Indiana
Massachusetts and Oregonâ were au
thorized to be built by act of Congress
on June 30, 1890. While the bill was
before Congress the Navy Department
was preparing the plans for the ships;
the designers of the hull being Assist
ant Naval Constructors Lewis Nixon
and David W. Taylor, while the ma
chinery plans were made in the Bu
reau of Steam Engineering under En
gineer-In-Chief George W. Melvlllo.
On the day following the passage of
the act the plans were ready and bids
invited, and November 18-I'J following
the contracts for their construction
were signed. The Crumps built the In
diana and Massachusetts and the Union
Iron Works got the Oregon. Owing to
delay In- supplying the armor and ord
nance the completion of the ships was
greatly protracted, the Oregon natur
ally suffering the most because of the
3000 milts' distance from the base of
supplies. The ships were identical as
to lines of hull, machinery and general
fiirangement and their contract speed
was fifteen knots. The builders had
the- privilege of making changes in the
details of the motive power of the ships
which would result in attaining a
higher speed and greater efficiency,
subject to the approval of the Navy
Department, and, also Bubject to the
limitations of weight. That the ex
perts at the Union Iron Works exer
cised this right of making changes with
good effect is proved by the fact that
the Oregon made 16.79 knots during her
trlal of four hourg under forced
draught, while the Indiana and Massa
chusetts, built by Cramp, made 15.48
and 16.21 knots respectively. The horse
po-wer of the three ships was 11,111 for
the Oregon. 973S for the Indiana and
10,403 for the Massachusetts.
In the building of these three ships
there was a contest of brains and me
chanical skill between an old-estab
lished firm with the experience gained
through the building of upward of two
hundred vessels and the practically un
tried capacity of another firm which
had hitherto built chiefly mining ma
chinery and only half a dozen vessels,
three of which were for the navy. In
this contest there is one man to whose
wondrous mechanical skill â a skill ap
proaching genius â the success of the
Oregon is largely due. This is George
W. Dickie, manager of the Union Iron
Works. He gave to the construction
and equipment of the 'ship through
many months the best of his thought
and labor, and when she left the dock
on her trial trip she was as perfectly
fitted a machine as ever floated.
Among other improvements made by
Mr. Dickie was the change in propell
ers by which the slip was reduced to
14.33 per cent, against 22.64 in the Mas
sachusetts and 24.85 per cent in the
Indiana.
W. R. Eckart, consulting engineer, a
former engineer in the navy, of high
scientific attainments and rare practi
cal ability, contributed his share to
ward the final success.
Robert Forsyth, an eminently prac
tical man with vast experience in get
ting the most work out of the en
gines and boilers in a ship, also did
good work on the Oregon. He worked
the engines up to their full capacity
with due regard to the fact that every
thing was new and untried, and the
subsequent career of the ship shows
that he was within the margin of
safety.
The performance at her trial demon
strated her superiority in speed over
her competitors, and the run of about
14,000 miles without stopping to over
haul any part of the complicated and
delicate machinery is as fine a testi
monial to the honest work of San Fran
cisco mechanics as could be desired and
any one of them in the future may well
be proud that he was one of the build
ers of the Oregon.
The good snip left San TVanciseo
March 19 for the East, with her bunkers
full, drawing about 26 feet of water.
She averaged 10.96 knots, on her run of
4112 knots to ('allao, thence 2550 knots
at 11.9 knots an hour, and from Sandy
Point made a spurt of 14.6 knots an
hour during nine consecutive hours
without resorting to forced draught.
Arriving at Ju^fter Inlet, Florida, May
23, she had accomplished the long voy
age at the average rate of 11*4 knots
an hour, and what is still more remark
able, no part of the ship was in need
of repairs. On the contrary. Captain
Clark at once Joined our fleet at San
tiago, where, on July 3, the ship ren
dered such signal service in the de
struction of Cervera's fleet. The story
of the events of that day are too re
cent to need recital, and stories of the
work of the Oregon are daily coming
in. but there is one lesson to be deduced
from the results of the battle off San
tiago which should not be ignored, and
it is this:
When Cervera's fleet ran out the
Brooklyn, rated at 21.91 knots, was
nearest to the enemy, and the Ore
gon further away. In the chase of
the flying enemy the Oregon, rated at
16.79 knots spoed, gained on both the
Brooklyn and upon the Cristobal Co
lon, credited with 20 knot^.speed. This
would indicate that while the Oregon
was doing her level best the Brooklyn
was either unprepared for the dash or
unable because of foulness of bottom
to make the same speed as the Oce
gon, and finally that the Spanish ship
was overrated as to speed. Foreign
navies abound in ships with phenome
nal speeds on paper, and it woulu seem
that we have sonic also In our navy,
but that trip of 14,000 mileg, culminat
ing in a dash of speed exceeding those
rated several knots higher, goes to
show that the Oregon has done more
than her duty and that the ships
turned out by the Union Iron Works
are the peers of any in the world.
HE IS A GREAT
SHIP-BUILDER
Brief Sketch of the Career of George
W. Dickie of the Union
Iron Works.
The following biographical sketch of
Mr. Dickie has Just boen prepared by
John W, Richards, one of the contrib
utors of Cassler's Magazine, and Is to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 31, 1898.
GEORGE W. DICKIE,
Manager of the Union Iron WorKs, to Whose Wonderful Mechanical SltHl the Success of
the Battleship Oregon Is Largely Due.
be published in the forthcoming num
ber of that periodical:
George W. Dickie was born at ,Ard
roth, Scotland, sixty years ago. He
first trained in his father's shipyard
at Ardroth, and afterward moved to
Dundee. After this tr> served an ap
prenticeship with a North British
railroad, and was then trained in con
struction of textile machinery and hy
draulic machines and apparatus, and
then became qualified for the multifar
ious duties which he has been called
upon to discharge in San Francisco.
He is a personal friend and is closely
connected In a political sense with
Commodore George W. Melville, Chief
of the Bureau of Steam Engineering
of the United States Navy. They have
extended reciprocal aid to each other.
His present position as a ship-builder
is as well established in other countries
as at home.
The use and progress of deep water
shipbuilding on the Pacific Coast has
been due in a great measure to the per
sonal acts of Mr. Dickie, who holds the
position of chief engineer of the Union
Iron Works. Shipbuilding may be said
to be congenital in the Dickie family.
who for more than 200 years have all
been shipbuilders. When he came to
the coast, more than twenty years ago,
he came with the object of establishing
shipbuilding here. At that time iron
shipbuilding had not been commenced
in the United States, but the change
from wood to metal was evident and
people hesitated to engage in an indus
try which had apparently so
little permanence as wooden ship-
Mr Dickie became chief construct ing
engineer for the Risdon Iron Works
after first building the San Francisco
Gas Works, and a little later on for the
famous Comstock lode at Virginia City
engineering works of a novel character.
Tn the meantime he had induced his
brothers to follow him to this coast-
James Dickie, now shipbuilder for the
Union Iron Works, and John Dickie,
who occupies the same position in the
Fulton Iron Works. They established
the firm of Dickie Bros., which, how
ever, did not include the personal ser
vices of George Dickie.
About 1884 he prepared elaborate
ROBERT FORSYTH, SUPERINTENDING ENGINEER UNION IRON
WORKS.
and complete drawings for what is
called composite vessels, with the in
tention of establishing a line between
San Francisco and New York via the
Straits of Magellan, which enterprise
tailed owing to the non-investment
of capital.
In 18Â»5 he attempted an organization
in San Francisco composed of a num
ber of our most prominent citizens to
absorb the business of Dickie Bros.,
and to founl a manufactory for the
building of iron steamships. About the
same time the Union Iron Works con
, \ed a similar scheme which, under
...t- direction of Irving M. Scott, took
form in the acquirement of land at the
Potrero, and the removal of the works
to that place. As there was not room
for the two kindred enterprises, Mr.
Dickie was induced to become a mem
ber of the Union Iron Works, repre
senting the shipbuilding branch of
their industry as chief engineer. The
building of Government vessels by the
Union Iron Works was commenced
after a visit of Irving M. Scott to the
Navy Department and other executive
branches of the Government at Wash-
ington.
The history of subsequent contracts
for the Government has culminated in
the construction of the battleship Ore
gon, the first being the Charleston. The
Oregon speaks for itself, for Mr. Dickie
and for the Union Iron Works, and is
perhaps the best vessel of its class in
the world. The immense labor of draw
ing plans and making computations
devolved entirely upon Mr. Dixie,
who, in one case, was in his office al
most all the time for six months.
One thing in connection with â¢ Mr.
Dickie's recent visit to Japan is not gen
erally known. He went there after Mr.
Scott had returned to find that Eng
land had sent the war vessel Edgar
there for the same purpose, namely, to
secure contracts for building Japanese
warships. He went on board the Ed
gar, introduced himself to the captain,
and told his purpose. The English of
ficer acted manfully and introduced
him to the Japanese naval officials.
In company with Lord and Lady
Spencer and a number of other distin
guished guests he was taken on an ex
cursion in the Edgar around he Sea of
Japan. The fair treatment accorded
by the Britishers gave this country an
equal show in competition, and Mr.
Dickie received contracts for two Jap
anese war vessels. This incident Is
very pleasing, taken in connection with
the friendly relations now existing be
tween England and America.

tionalist, Mr. Dickie is withal so mod-

that the troops now there shall be trans
ferred immediately to Jacksonville. On
account of the necessarily inadequate fa

CLANCY TELLS OFTHE DEBATE
PROGRESS ON THE LOCAL GOV-
ERNMENT BILL.
One Point Is Clear, and That Is the
Irish Landlords Will Not Be
Aided by Their Euglish
â¢Triends."
BY J. J. CLANCY.
LONDON, July 16.â We have had an
other "Irish week" at Westminsterâ
the last -Irish" week of the session,
which will, for all purposes, come to a
close the first or early in the second
week of August. The principal busi
ness, of course, has been the considera
tion of the Irish local government bill
"on report." The "report" stage is
really the committee stage over again.
Mith the exceptio.i that the Speaker
(instead of the chairman of conimit
tees) occupies the chair and that each
person can speak on each motion only
once, and not as often as he likes.
Things got on smoothly enough the
first and second days of the week, and
it was fully expected that the bill
â would be finally disposed of by Thurs
day night and that ample time would
be found within the limit for the dis
cussion of the two or three important
questions that remained to be debated.
But we a!l counted without our host.
Late on Tuesday night there was a sud
den stop to our gallop, caused by the
Intervention of an obstructive band of
b Liberals.
i : the principal proposals in the
bill la 'â¢ the Irish landlords for
the future of their liability to the poor
rate. That is the only local rate in Ire
lo which they are or have been
liable, and th< y are and have been lia
ble for only half of that impost. To re
them of the burden will cost about
- year out of the annual grant
of three-quarters of a million pounds,
â which it is proposed to make out of the
imperial treasury in aid of Irish local
rates. This payment or relief to the
landlords, of course, was not liked by
the Irish popular representatives, but
. it was made an essential condition of
'â¢once.scion of local self-govern
ment, and they had, therefore, no
â  but to u^rrpe to it. One would
imagine that, when those most con
i accepted the situation and re-
: t" make the best of it, British
home-rulers at least would not have,
:â -.'. .leJt bound to demur. Just, however, as
: tj Catholics who are more i
,: Catholic lhan the Pope, so some British
:â¢â /â¢' Liberals are, it appears, more bent on
Qfifre on the Irish landlords
their past n ban the repre
ntatives of the lush tenants them
. â  g would do the British'
Liberals but to object on the first read-
Ing t the bill, to debate the matter
â¢ Be â :'.'! reading and to de
it once more on two subsequent
- in committee. At least all
efforts might be thought enough
â¢. - tisfy '--yen British Liberal honor;
hut no. Late on Tuesday night, when
: ;he clauses dealing with
the agricultural grant to Ir.-land was
t>a. hed. a small band of British home
rulors commenced a campaign of ob
truction to further progress with the
bin, and did not leave off till late on the
. . i i d j xt night.
.; Th4s band did not contain among its
n..Tnbvrs any of the Liberal leaders â
eo-caUed. They were either ashamed
â â¢â¢'.or afraid to give even the countenance
-.'..{â¢.of. their presence to the proceedings of
â¢ ;.;. their "Irregulars." Whether they se
sretly encouraged them is not a point
â¢:. ; . 6o easily determined. The irregulars
Vere led for the occasion by Mr. Lloyd-
V: â¢ :; Seorge, a Welsh member. He is a
.'â¢â . Small, insignificant looking fellow,
who, however, is rather clever and a
fairly good speaker. He poses as one
â  : . of the leading exponents of "the Non
conformist Conscience," and there can
y be no doubt that his great aim is of
fice for â Mr. Lloyd-George. His idea,
apparently, is that one of the best ways
to get to office is to copy the ways of
Parnell in the old days of Irish Â»b-
Btruction and generally to get himself
talked about; and this idea of his is
shared by Mr. George Lambert, a
. young West of England member of far
less brains and much less glib with his
tongue, but equally ambitious. Those
were the leaders of the Liberal incur-
Bion. and they had attached to their
rhariot wheels four or five rather mud
dleheaded, middle aged representatives
of British Liberal opinion who could
not, of course, have waged the battle
an hour by their own unaided efforts.
The proceedings of the little band were
as simple as possible, and entirely
lacked the skill that marked the old
obstruction campaigns of Parnell,
whoso methods they strove to follow.
For the most part, they merely kept
insisting on a "division" on every pos
â¢ Bible occasion, and as each "division"
: in the British House of Commons occu
â¢pfes something between a quarter of an
hour and twenty minutes, it is easy to

on those nights of years ago not five
minutes papsed without angry scenes
culminating ofton in the temporary ex
pulsion of some Irish member. It was
e;;sy enough to keep awake during
those nights of strenuous fighting; it
was difficult to refrain from falling
asleep between midnight and & a. m.
yosterday. But we finished the
bill, and that Is the main point. But
there was very little real discussion
during those last hours of the report
stage, and thus one or two Questions,
such as the exclusion of the clergy
from the new local bodies, were most
Inadequately debated. This was all
that the Liberal obstructives secured,
except notoriety for themselves, which,
a^ter all, may do them more harm
than good.
Last night the Irish estimates came
on for discussion, and the most impor
tant subject debated was the report of
the last royal commission on the work
ing of the Irish land acts. The debate
was a fatal one for the Irish landlords.
The commission in question known as
the Fry Commission, was appointed by
the present Government at the special
request of the Irish landlords to de

verse. Not only was the commission
appointed at the instance of the land
lords, but it did not contain upon it
even one representative of the Irish
tenants, while it did contain at least
one of the most prominent members of
the landlord class in all Ireland.
The report of this body has been
boasted of as a vindication of the land
lord position, because it contains some
criticisms on the working of the Irish
Lard Courts; and, accordingly, Irish
landlords in the House of Commons
commenced last night a discussion upon
it with a view to inducing the Govern
ment to propose another land bill â one,
I suppose, in their interest. But they
were hoisted with their own petard, for
Mr. Balfour, the Chief Secretary for
Ireland, at once picked out the weak
point in the landlord case by citing the
main finding in the Fry Commission re
portânamely, that though mistakes
might occasionally have been made, no
Injustice on the whole had been done
to the landlords. This declaration had
been given a wide berth by the land
lord speakers, and accordingly when it
was read out by the Chief Secretary
every one felt that the landlord game
was up and that nothing further was
to be hoped for from an agitation by
the landlords against the working of
the Irish land code. This was the only
conclusion to be drawn, moreover, from
THE EMPOBIUM.
the speech of the Chief Secretary. The
political results are likely to be not
unimportant. It is just possible at
least that when the Irish landlords see
(as they must now see) that they are
absolutely deserted by their English
"friends" they may come to the con
clusion that they might do worse than
go in for home rule for their own coun
try and thus give a new and perhaps
formidable turn to the Irish movement.
With this debate on the Irish land
question the session may be said to
have come to an end, so far as Ireland
is concerned.

points west of Colorado, the National
Livestock Association took up the mat
ter of adjusting these rates with West
ern lines. As a result the Union Pa
cific to-day issued an order making
Denver the terminus for all Western
shipments of stock instead of Ogden,
Utah.
Heretofore a shipper was compelled,
on reaching Ogden, to elect his route
to the Eastern markets. If he selected
the Union Pacific for Omaha or Kan
sas City he was not allowed to try
the Denver market without paying the
local freight rate from Cheyenne, Wyo.,
to Denver and return, a distance of 210
miles. Under the new ruling a ship
per can have his stock billed to any
Eastern market via Denver without
extra charge, thus giving him the ad
vantage of two markets instead of one,
without extra freight rates which made
shipments from many points in the
West to this market prohibitory.
It is Bald that other Western roads
terminating or running through here
will take similar action at an early
date.

MURDER OF THE
MARQUIS DE MORES
Prisoners Have Confessed That They
Shot the Adventurous French
man in Tripoli.
LONDON, July 30.â Advices have
been received here from Tunis to the
effect that three natives have been ar
rested in connection with the murder
of Marquis de Mores, who was reported
on June 17, 1896, to have been assassi
nated south of Tripoli. The advices add
that the prisoners have confessed to the
murder of the Marquis.
The Marquis de Mores left Eloutia, a
Tripolitan village, on June 8 for Gha
damas with eight companions and an
escort of Touargos and Schambels, who
were armed with carbines. He was at
tacked by the Touargo escort, who shot
him and left him lying in the road.
The Marquis de Mores was well
known in America. He was the son of
the Duke of Vallambrosa and married
a daughter of Louis yon Hoffman, a
banker of New York City, In 1882, corn

EXPULSION OF ZOLA.
Promises to Create Serious Division
in the Legion of Honor.
PARIS. July 30.â The expulsion of M.
Emile Zola from the Legion of Honor
promises to create a serious division in
the organization. The well-known au
thor, M. Jules Barbier, resigned yester
day on account of M. Zola's expulsion
and this morning M. de Pressenz, the ed
itor of the Temps, took a similar courso,
saying It is "repugnant to wear a dec

A PERSONAL INQUIRY.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Evening Post,
having read and digested an editorial in this
paper devoted to discussing "yellow dog"
gubernatorial candidates, calls in imperious tones for
the name of the man whom we desire nominated by
the Republican convention. Of course it was impos
sible for the Post to award us the credit of sincerity.
It could see nothing in our "historical inquiries" ex
cept a desire to kill off all other candidates and place
before the convention an aspirant of our own choice.
However, we do not complain of the Post's mental
obliquity. Having been retained by "Lou" Brown,
it is quite natural that it should get red in the face
when "yellow dogs" are mentioned.
â¢â¢.:â¢ But notwithstanding the ungenerous construction
which it places upon The Call's motives, we are not
vtinwilling to take our esteemed contemporary into our
confidence. At the same time, however, we shall in
.vite the confidence of the 150,000 Californians who
' every two years yearn for a chance to vote the Repub
lican ticket, and who do vote it when permitted by the
political bosses.
The Call has no candidate for Governor. We do
not intend to have a candidate. We design devoting
: ourselves in thi* campaign to the success of the Re
publican party. We believe that when the govern
ment is administered by self-respecting, independent
Republicans it is administered better, more cheaply
and more honestly than when administered by dema
gogue Democrats, rattle-pated Populists and hungry
office-seekers. We are, therefore, anxious to see the
.Republican party succeed at the coming election, and
all. bur "historical inquiries"* have been and will be
devoted to directing the minds of its leaders into chan
nels which promise success.
History is fruitful of lessons. The man who does
npt study it with profit is a fool. Having lost three
out of four campaigns by nominating weak candi
dates, what sense is there in the Republican party try
ing another experiment of that character?
The Call is a Republican newspaper, and whoever
is nominated for Governor by the convention which
meets at Sacramento on the 23d of August it will sup
port him. Even if our loyalty to Republican prin
ciples did not compel this course, even if we did not
think that any Republican in the gubernatorial office
woiiid give us better government than we could get
out of a Democrat, the presence in the contest of
Judge Maguire at the head of a Democratic-Populist
gang would force us to fight the battle, no matter how
hopeless it might be. But The Call, although a Re
publican newspaper, bound in any event to join the
obedient ranks and shoot in the direction of the
enemy, has a right, and it is its duty, to advocate a
policy which will produce success.
We know the Republican people of California will
no longer elect "yellow dog" candidates. We have
cited history to prove that they have refused to do
so in the past. Why, then, should we not tell those
who are making the gubernatorial "fights" of the
factionists, country politicians and railroad hacks that
they are leading the party to defeat? If there were a
law to forbid this proceeding would it not be our
duty to violate it?
What we say, and what we shall continue
to say, regardless of any construction that may
be placed upon our words by the boss-ridden
corporation press, is this: The Republican
party can no longer carry elections in Cali
fornia with "yellow dogs" at the head of its
tickets. In the voting booths, alone with their bal
lots, their rubber stamps and their consciences, the
people are uncontrolled and uncontrollable. They
must be given candidates in whom they have confi
dence or they will trample party labels under their
feet and bury party organizations in a grave of ballots.
â¢ This is the truth, and it is mighty. If all the bosses of
all the parties were to cough simultaneously they
could not cough it down.
An Illinois regiment is in danger of being mus
tered out of the service because of the row it is mak
ing over not being sent to the front. The men in that
regiment. have their fir^t lesson in military duty to
learn. Soldiers camped in San Francisco for many
weeks have been just as eager to be sent, but all the
time they have realized that they were soldiers.
When Lochner shall bring his suit for false im
prisonment he ought to direct it against Chief Lees
rather than against the city. The Chief is monarch
of the Tanks and Lord of the Small Book. How
ever, Lochner would be foolish to court more no
toriety. He is at his best in seclusion.
. While schemes are being organized for direct lines
between this country and the Philippines of course
no shrewd capitalist overlooks the fact that San Fran
cisco is the natural home port.
- Camara's fleet seems to consist of a few old boats
and a desire to keep out of sight.
THE TERMS OF PEACE.
THE assertion of the right of conquest and
colonial expansion go together.
The western world has reached with greedy
hand for the prize of Oriental commerce. It made
the commercial center of Europe in the city of Wisby
nearly a thousand years ago. It built Venice on the
marshes and gilded her palaces. It made the Neth
erlands rich enough to be a prize to Spain. It
has poured a Pactolus stream into England since
Give and Hastings turned a commercial settlement
into political empire and the scepter of the Moguls
was broken.
Between that Oriental and tropical commerce
there is but little difference. They originate in great
natural resources wrought upon by a teeming popu
lation.
The Spanish war has brought within our reach the
richest of the tropical islands. They are peopled by
races ill fitted to govern themselves and not amiable
to any form of government, and most orderly under
military restraint.
It is proposed to hold these possessions perma
nently as colonies. The case should be stated fairly.
We spent blood and treasure in a war against the
misgovernment of these colonies by Spain. They
have fallen from her weak hand.
Shall we keep them? If we do, their affairs must
be administered; they must have government. The
extension of our commerce to them will require that
person and property must be sternly protected. The
administration will of necessity be largely military.
Our army, now consisting of 280,000 men, will be
maintained at that figure. The navy will be in
creased to about 700 fighting ships of the model and
armament proved by our recent trials to be the best
suited to offense and defense. The military and naval
career open to our young men will be greatly ex
panded. West Point and Annapolis will be occupied
with their full quota of cadets, and each graduate will
immediately take his station. The profession of
arms will offer prizes that have heretofore been
sought in law and medicine. In the palmy days of
Rome's policy of conquest law and the army offered
the prizes of ambition. It will be so here, if we enter
upon expansion, because the army and politics will
absorb the interest and monopolize the attention of
our people.
The government of our colonies will increase the
power of the executive. The issues in the Philip
pines alone will for years call for constant adjustment
and readjustment. They will be entirely novel and
cannot be settled by Congress. Their treatment must
be executive. The rebellion there has not been
against the exactions of the civil power of Spain, but
! against the primacy and the cost of the ecclesiastical
1 establishment, which is the largest owner ot realty in
the islands, and has administered not only internal
I affairs, but has controlled external commerce as well,
i The treatment of this ecclesiastical establishment will
i produce important changes in our domestic politics
i and raise questions at home which will divide our own
j peopie on a fresh partisan alignment and give an
j impetus to politics as a profession.
Th* building of ships and equipment and mainte
1 nance c; a large army will impart a profitable ac
[ tivity to many lines of construction and manufac
! ture. The fortifying of these islands will call for a
t large expenditure profitable to American contractors.
I As their possession puts us in direct rivalry to all
other nations, the causes of quarrel with them are
tnarvelously multiplied, so that the country may not
lock for long periods of peace. The much talked of
British alliance is brought into focus by this policy.
Great Britain wants a neighborly neighbor in the
I Asiatic tropics. Manila is within 600 miles of Hong
i kong, the seat of her power in China. As our colo
nisl policy will be an exact copy of hers, the two na
j tions will pull together, and English aspirations in
! Egypt and Africa will be put nearer to realization.
j The whole bent and tendency of the American mind
! will be changed. The very education of our people
I will be affected. Its purpose will be shifted. Our
; ptople will find their highest aspiration to be the
j contemplation of physical power. Our policy will be
I military and the civilian will be subordinate in re
spect and influence to the military man. Our Na
tional Government will acquire that virility which
comes of the concentration of power that is insepar
able from militarism. The people will see that
j greater promptness in Federal action that is possible
: only when freed from the peculiar restraints provided
in the constitution. Domestic disorders will be
i more promptly quelled, and the rights of property
I will feel greater security.
These may be fairly put among what is to come, if
1 the terms of peace include our permanent acquisition
of the colonies of Spain.
BfIRRY GROWS AMBITIOUS.
NATURALLY the desire of Congressman Ma
guire to be Governor is of some importance.
It creates a vacancy in the House of Repre
sentatives. Toward the prospective vacancy patriots
are swarming, and at the head of the lot is James H.
Barry. He is known as editor of the Star, a
paper which derives a large part of its income through,
furnishing a place of concealment for the class of ad
vertising the advertisers wish to keep from publicity.
Barry has also become known by previous efforts
toward the same goal. He tried to be" Congressman
from the Fifth, the district in which he resides, but
not having the ghost of a show has decided that he
wil' represent another district, a procedure somewhat
out of the common and unlikely to strike favorably
the aspirants whose territory he intends to invade.
In considering the chances of Barry, the character
of the man naturally must be weighed. It will be re
merr.bered that he advocated the killing of the Penn
sylvania troops because they responded to the call of
the executive when murderous rioters were abroad
with rifle and torch. He wanted them slain like
vipers. Later these same troops came here on their
way to the Philippines. Why was he not consistent
to the extent of slaughtering at least a few of them?
There are matters about which he is consistent
enough. He steadily refuses to pay taxes, his theory
being of the Wells-Fargo variety, that the other fel
low must do the paying. He now owes $568 in taxes.
Us course is directly contrary to the statute. In
fact, he is a law-breaker, and glories in it. His prop
osition to become a lawmaker, as an instance of
cheek, is almost unique even among politicians, who
are not usually hampered by modesty.
Once a man met Barry and spat in his face. The
individual doing this was a bully and a gun-fighter,
and yet the tendency to resent an indignity so gross
wculd have awakened in any one but Barry a spirit
of active resentment. Barry wiped his face, and the
incident was closed. The unfortunate affair earned
for him the title of "Cuspidore," which would not be
a happy thing to carry to Congress, nor even into a
futile campaign.
Still, if the Democrats choose to nominate Barry,
that is their funeral, and as it would also be Barry's
the scheme has elements commending it to the judg
ment. Barry has been Maguire's mouthpiece, but Ma
guire has brains, albeit perhaps muddled at times.
A rr outhpiece in action, with no brains behind it, is

BISMARCK AND H'S WORK-
AFTER lingering for years in retirement, a dis
carded but not a superfluous veteran on the
stage, Prince Bismarck is dead. The man who
during the last generation filled the largest space in
the eyes of the world has passed away, and now it is
for men of the younger generation to study his
career, note the methods by which he accomplished
his mighty work, and endeavor as best they can to
appraise his character and his service at their true
worth.
Whatever view may be taken of Bismarck as a man,
there will be little or no difference of opinion con
cerning the magnitude and lasting good of his
achievements in the domain of international politics.
He ranks among the greatest men oi an age prolific
of great men. Lincoln saved a nation, Gladstone re
formed a nation, Cavour reorganized a nation, but
Bismarck created a nation, and the creative act was
wrought out by such Titanic forces and by such
amazing steps of uninterrupted success that the
worker stands out before the world as a unique figure,
conspicuous and dominant among the strong men of
his time.
The salient feature of Bismarck s character was a
certain medieval quality of mind and temperament.
Lincoln, Cavour and Gladstone were essentially men
of our time. In no other age could any of them
have achieved the work he performed in the way by
which he actually accomplished it. They were con
stitutional statesmen. They guided rather than ruled
the people. Their power was exerted more as an
influence upon the popular mind than through courts
or armies. They were educators of the masses, as it
were, and took no step that did not have the sanction
of the better, if not the greater, part o. the citizens
of the countries whose affairs they administered.
It was not so with Bismarck. The grea: German
rarely consulted the Germans or cared for their
opinion on anything he decided to undertake. He
frankly announced that in his judgment the only true
government is one that consists of a king and an
army, and that great strokes of statecraft are to be
achieved not by speeches, parliamentary debates and
popular discussions, but by blood and iron. To this
frank audacity of speech his actions corresponded. He
made a united Germany by means of a king and an
army through methods of blood and iron, and having
made it undertook to rule it in the same way.
The rule of judging men by the success they ac
complish iv. life is not a just one, but it is the best
that is known to men. We can never be sufficiently
acquainted with all the circumstances surrounding
any worker, nor with all the forces that oppose or
help him, to accurately appraise the real value of his
personality in the results that follow his efforts. We
can only assume that where the results are great the
worker must have been great, and must, furthermore,
have used the right means for performing the work.
By this rule Bismarck will be given in future histories
a rank as high as has been universally accorded him
during his life. There will be i.o haggling over
whether he was or was not too arbitrary, too domi
neering, too despotic, too harsh. His work attests
his wisdom and his^ strength, and the final conclusion
will be that if such a rough giant worker established
the unity of Germany it was simply because the con
ditions of the people required exactly that sort of
leader to make a nation out of them.
Of the domestic policy of the great Chancellor
little need be said. The word '"Failure" is written
large all over it. Such a bungler was he in the adminis
tration of the empire his genius and his courage had
created that a youthful Emperor was able to dismiss
him in disgrace, without suffering in the least from
the consequences of the act. Bismarck's true career
closed virtually when in the gorgeous palace of the
French Kings at Versailles King William of Prussia
was crowned Emperor of Germany. No Emperor nor
court historian can rob Bismarck of the glory of that
far-reaching act, and the world, which will benefit in the
future as it has already done by the unification of
Germany, will overlook his faults and his failures and
remember only the sterling virtues which made him
equal to the task of creating a nation and raising it
to the first rank among the po.wers of the earth.
COMMERCIAL INSTINCT IN DISGUISE.
AT the meeting of commercial bodies in this
iity Friday night there were speeches far bet
ter never uttered. Passing over that of Hugh
Craig, who is so often in the public eye and ear that
in a measure he loses imprcssiveness, an excerpt from
ths remarks of Captain Charles Nelson may be con
sidered. In endeavoring to show that the Philippines
should be held he said, "The wreck of the Maine
with the murder of our brave seamen in Havana har
bor was an act intended to lead up to this great ad
vancement of civilization." You don't say so!
According to this theory an overruling Providence
desired the United States to grab everything in sight
and had to blow the idea into our understanding with
dynamite. True, the poet says,* "God moves in a
mysterious way his wonders to perform," yet con
ceding this, it is hard to believe that the most mys
terious way would include centuries of brutality on
the part of a nation; culminating in assassination and
wreck. There would, had Providence been directing
affairs with specific view to the condition now
brought about, have been a quicker and neater
method.
As a matter of fact the inspiration of the meeting
sprang from the commercial instinct, which is noth
ing but the hope of gain. There is no use posing.
When business organizations desire an expansion of
territory for the good it will do them in dollars they
might as well say so, and not try to pass themselves
off as missionaries bent upon spreading any token of
civilization unless they can get paid for the token in
cash.
Ah important feature apparently wholly overlooked
is that we have not yet secured the Philippines, and
while the fruit seems almost ripe, there are others out
with their poles. If the statement that 150,000 men
will be needed first to defeat the Spaniards and then
to subdue the natives be true, even the commercially
inspired may well stop to ask, "Will it pay?"
People who do not win in the lottery may find a
grain of consolation in the experience of a man and
wife in this city. They had lived happily until they
had the misfortune to hold the capital ticket, and be
gan quarreling as soon as it had been cashed. Now
the winning will probably have to be devoted in part
to settling the question of alimony.
According to a paper published across the bay
Peter Anderson has gone to work after several weeks'
nursing of a finger blown off on the Fourth of July.
Perhaps Peter knows what is best for him, but a
blown-off finger would hardly seem to be worth all
this trouble.
A man supposed to be the nephew of King Hum
bert is in love with an Am-rican girl. The fact that
the gir! is poor naturally throws a shade of suspicion
over the suitor's claim to royal connection.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
It seems to me that the Rev. E. E.
Dodge does not know to which side of
his daily bread there adheres a com
forting coat of butter. The same is
true of any preacher who rises to rail
against permitting women to have a
voice in church affairs. In my worldly
judgment, if the Rev. Mr. Dodge suc
ceed in eliminating the feminine ele
ment from his flock he will have no
flock. Men go to church because their
wives v.^nt them to go. The women
constitute the life of the institution.
They have just as much right to be
heard in the direction of Its affairs as
\ thej r have to give orders for dinner at
; home. But for the women the Rev. Mr.
i Dodge and his kind would be hunting
; jobs, and mayhap have to be content
with one tending to callous the palm.
The material church would vanish, and
the pastor thereof become a blessed
memory. The claim that women should
â  have nothing to say as to the direction
i of an organization so strictly their own
| strikes me as absurd, and the nerve of
i the minister making it inspires awe.
I Surely Mr. Dodge does not think they
would be so silly as to sit under the
drippings of his wisdom, listening with
meekness to all he might have to say
if they were to be treated as inferior.
I have enough respect for the sex to
believe that they would resent so
marked a slight. Will the reverend
gentleman please tell me what It Is
women lack? Is it soul, or is it intelli
gence? In the meantime, sinner
though I am, I have the grace to be
ashamed of him.

W. D. Crabb has written some poems
which he calls "Lyrics of the Golden
West." The neat volume in which they

j request that I notice it. I decline to do
I so. Just because the Local Lyre man
of the Visalia Delta stirred me to ad
miration it doe? not follow that space

Furthermore, Mr. Crabb may be a good
citizen, and to refrain from hurting his
feelings shall be a joy of mine.

One disgusting feature of the war has
been that for everybody who has won
eminence either through victory or de
feat, up has sprung some woman to tell
how at some time she had been wooed
of him. While most of these females
are fakers, and entitled to no respect,
I confess to an absence of admiration
for such as may be telling the truth.
When a man falls in love with a woman
he pays her a compliment by that act,
and if he vainly offer to become her
husband, surely i worthy woman would
treat the matter as sacredly confiden
tial. As to the Callfornian girl to whom
Cervera is alleged to have written let
ters, I am inclined to believe that she
has been led by some trickery into be
trayal of the circumstance, provided
there is such a person and such a cir
cumstance. It must be borne in mind
that the letters were published in a
paper which is wholly unscrupulous,
and which I verily believe would rather
tell a stupid lie than an interesting
truth. For the benefit of the chance
ptranger within our gates it may be
added that the paper is the lixaminer.

An exchange, commenting on the

I have an active sympathy with the
noble sport of coursing. It is a little
hard on the hares, but they would die
some day anyhow, and in the mean
time chew young trees, as well as prop
aerate the active flea, which needs no
encouragement. The charge has been
made that the sport is not refining, but
this has never been sustained. Only
recently the official known as the
"slipper" made a mistake which great
ly exasperated the ladles present, who,
by his error, lost the bets they had
placed. It is true that some of these
ladlca cried "Hang him," but this was
only due to the first impulse. Their
gentle natures prevailed. They did
not hang him.

When I speak of the Supreme Court
it must be understood that it is always
with the greatest respect, in fact a
feeling akin to awe. So far as I have
been able to ascertain by observation
the duty of this august body is to up
j set verdicts carefully arrived at by the
courts below. That a tribunal fitted
to do this is beyond adverse criticism
and recks not of commendation is a
plain proposition. Still, I have ven
tured to be surprised that absolutely
no regard seems to be paid to consid
erations of Justice. The question ap
pears to be not as to a man's guilt, but
as to whether his guilt has been es
tablished by certain formulae. The
truth is of less importance than the
manner of its setting forth. "We find
that while the demonstration that
John Smith stole the purse is com-
I plete, the trial court failed to establish
! the fact that he stole it from a cross
i eyed woman in the dark of the moon."
j This seems to be about the style of the
i average reversal. Ido not presume to
! find fault with it. In the absence of
legal training, it may strike me as pe
culiar, and yet be eminently sound, and
sustained by an array of precedents
! reaching back to the dawn of creation.
! Another thing over which I have been
! at times impertinent enough to enter
! tain mild doubts is ns to whether the
fact that a verdict has been rendered
j in the court of Judge Wallace is suffi
j cient ground tdt overturning it. It
is certain that the sentences imposed
by Judge Wallace, in instances in
' which no appeal has been given the su
| preme bench an opportunity to monkey
; Judicially with them, have done more
to check crime in this community than
i any other single cause. He has been
severe, but always Justly so, and when
convinced that a criminal needed
heavy punishment has not hesitated to
inflict it. It was he who sentenced
two notorious forgers to priÃon for life,
they having proved themselves unfit
to be at large. That they were guilty

has never been, I believe, a shadow
of doubt. Yet they are to have a
new trial. Why? Because they want
it. I exult in a strength of character
such as is not above stooping from the
bench down to the humble scoundrel
and telling him not to be discouraged,
that there is hope, and that in the fu
ture it may not be his to pine within
four walls, but perhaps to taste free
dom and forge some more.
Relatives of Miss Schley owe it to
that young woman to tell her that no
necessity for putting herself on dis
play has arrived. She is the young

tent to inform Sagasta of the beau

having converted him she would go to
Washington to instruct and edify the
President. Most properly she was
bounced from Spain, but is believed to
still be at large. If she is determined
to go into the show business she seems
adapted to the humble role of museum
freak. With President Love of the
Salute Your Enemy with a Holy Kiss
Society, and Professor Norton, who is
a choice specimen of the rare Copper
head, and Larry Godkin as spieler, it
might be possible to draw a crowd. The

I say again that the United States must
take and keep the Philippines it is with
a distinct knowledge that other people
who seem to know more appear to hold
the contrary notion, and may be cor
rect. I am unable to see how we can
help keeping the islands. It must be
remembered that the war with Spain
is a humanitarian affair. We went into
it with a lofty idea of freeing an op
pressed people from servitude. What
was true of Cuba was equally true of
the Philippines. There the natives
were in rebellion against a hateful
tyranny. If we were to surrender them
back to the tyrant and refuse to sur
render Cuba we would thereby declare
our insincerity, and show that tve went
to the rescue of Cuba merely because
it was so near us that the turmoil of
conflict was annoying. Now that Spain's
hold on Cuba has been broken we must
take care of that island, for it is inca
pable of taking care of itself. The same
rule forces us to take care of the Phil
ippines, which are equally helpless. If
we do not do so now, and our army
and navy be withdrawn, it will simply
delay the inevitable. In a short time
we will be obliged to go back with an
other force and complete the work of
emancipation; either this or we confess
that we were meddlers and had no busi
ness to interfere." â¢

It is always my aim to be moderate in
expression. Therefore when I say that
Judge Gummere of the New Jersey Su
preme Court is a fool, that he has less
brains than the mosquito whose buz
zing annoys him, and whose bill, I hope,
will render the life of the Judge a bur
den to himself as it must be to all about
him, I am studiously avoiding any un
due emphasis. This person, probably
presenting the aspect of a man, has set
aside a verdict of $5000 against a rail
road for the killing of a child, the
ground being that a child is of no p3cu
niary value to the parents. I may have
erred in calling so brutalized a creature
a fool. Rather, he is a hardened and
vicious knave who should be whipped
from the bench, kicked from the pres
ence of decency, and followed by the
anathema of every one whose heart has
ever been touched by the prattle of
babj'hood. He says, this drooling, driv
eling disgrace to civilization, that a son,
far from being of value, is an expense
until he goes off to shift for himself;
that a daughter is a larger expense un
til she marries. The inference is plain
that parents whose expenses are les
sened by the thoughtful killing off of
their offspring should consider them
selves indebted to the corporations do
ing the killing, r.nd I have no doubt,
were the corporations to bring action]
they would be sustained by the un
speakable Gummere. To analyze a doc
trine so monstrous is almost impossi
ble, because the instinct refuses to be
lieve that a Gummere can exist. For a
judicial decision to declare that a child,
who to its parents is as bone of bone
and flesh of flesh, has no value Is to
prove the Judge a pervert. True, this
value cannot be adequately measured,
and yet it should have some definite
recognition in law, else are we brutes
each parent freely entitled to kill his
own, and culpable If he neglect to do
so. New Jersey is known as the rot
ten asset of any corporation which has
the price, but above all the reek of cor
ruption, with a distinct stink of his
own, his hands in the corporation
strong box, his foot on the grave of a
murdered babe, Gummere can be dis
cerned. It is my belief that men more
worthy are hanged every day. and that
the penitentiary convict not his moral
superior is not within four walls. Hell
is full of better citizens. I look forward
to the time, and hope it will not be long
when the devil shall come to the front
door of his smoking tenement and with
a grin of appreciation and welcome say
"Gummere!"

The portrait of General Shatter Is
still above the door of the Examiner,
wreathed with fading laurel. Doubtless
there is a desire within that place of
purity and Joy to turn the picture to
the wall or send it with the next batch
of sworn circulation to the garbage
crematory. But this would never do.
It would be placing the editorial heart
on the sleeve for daws to peck at, and
besides constitute an indecent exposure.
So the paper is beginning to attack
Shafter, taking its cue from the New
York publication of which it is a feeble
echo. It was Shafter who strictly in
line of duty had to tell the public that
the editor In chief of both these daily
villainies had lied. It was fhe same
officer who later had to bounce the
Journal-Examiner men, bag and bag
gage, out of Cuba because of their
malign interference and constant effort
to stir up strife. Now he is being de
nounced in lar^o type, of course. Mean
while the picture remains over the door
and can't be taken down lest there re
sound the merry ha, ha. But while
Andy cannot take it down, I can imag
me him going out during the night and

There should be a law against George
Alfred Townsend's writing any more
poetry. His latest metrical curio is
entitled "Europe to Watson's Fleet." I
am confident Europe never said any
thing of the kind. If it did, there's
your casus belli, and trot out your big
gest guns. With a feeling of being
particeps criminis, I quote:
Atlantic, it rings with hosanna
That follows ye in from the west;
Ye alight on the world like Diana
With her bow and her clusters of breast.
Never having had the pleasure of
seeing Diana in her justly celebrated
act of alighting on the world, I can
only hope that she alighted with both
feet squarely under her. But just how
Watson's fleet is to imitate the act la
not clear. If it alight on the world
it "will have. to be yanked off by tugÂ»
and if it ' happen to hit a hard spot
there will be nothing left but wreck
age. Neither does the idea of "clus
ters of breast" appeal either to a sense
of the artistic or to a moderate knowl
edge of anatomy. I would advise Di
ana, in the friendliest spirit, to see a
surgeon. If her condition has been
correctly portrayed, she needs prun
ing. But let us cull new beauty.
George Alfred breaks out in another
spot:
Long England has waited his sister.
At Mediterranean's gate.
Where Spain, like a hideous blister,
Holds Ceuta her dungeon of state.
Perhaps there can be no objection to
terming Spain a hideous blister, but for
a blister of any kind to be holding A
dungeon, of state is out of line with
precedent. The truth is that a rhyme
was needed for sister and the poet vio
lated the specifications of his license,
and made the rhyme. Ido not un
derstand why England should be re
garded as masculine and this country
as feminine. Uncle Sam wears panta
loons. However, to proceed:
Republics of Greece and Italia,
Tiny spangled the sea with their hate,
Their history long saturnalia,
Their jealousy green as their fate.
Now what do you think of that?
Jealousy is popularly supposed to have
an emerald tinge, but a fate the color
of grass is something new. Perhaps
George Alfred has been confused by
reading of yellow journalism, pink teas
and purple cows. Possibly there lin
gers in his memory a recollection of
some town painted red. I would like
to see a picture of a green fate. Again,
he intimates that his Uncle Sam ought
to wear skirts, as note:
Come, dame without scepter or altar.
And show us the light that is true!
Sit down by the strait of Gibraltar
And tell us if Jesus be you.
I charge George Alfred Townsend
with incipient paresis, and submit the
case without argument.
NIGHT IN CAMP.
My tent is closed against the wind.
Which whistles overhead;
The dogs .are crouching near the stove.
My pitrtner is in bed;
The candle sheds a welcome light
On such; a cold and stormy night.
Of all the thirteen men in camp
But one is now awake;
The others dream of far-off homes
Or claims they hope to stake.
I buil<] a castle In the arr
And find my loved ones gathered there.

Enthusiasm Grows Among Workers For the Coming Irish Fair,
As the day draws near for the opening of the Irish Fair, renewed activity is being displayed by those who
have the magnificent venture in hand. Preparations surpassing anything of a like celebration are rapidly nearing
completion, and everything points to an auspicious opening.
In a few days the largo consignment of earth from Erin's shores will reach the city and will be immedi
ately transported to the Pavilion, where it will be utilized in forming the big map of Ireland which will be a
feature in the Irish Fair. To satisfy the minds of those who are interested In the consignment, the management
states that it is not peat nor sod, as it is termed in Ireland, but is the green turf skimmed from the top of the
ground from farms and village commons in the different counties of the Green Isle. The material has been care
fully laid in large casks, with earth packed carefully around it. It will bo taken from the casks, laid on the
floor and arranged to show the thirty-two counties closely, with the most important cities and towns. All about
this soil map will be canvas painted to resemble the ocean, with shore and lines depicting the surf breaking upon
the rocks. The tan bark jaunting car track encircles this ir.lip of Ireland, and this entire track will be fenced in
by wooden fence and painted canvas cloth to resemble stone wall, trees, etc.
The committee in charge embraces Miss Nellie Sullivan, Miss Josephine Malloy and a large corps of as
sistants. It is expected that fully 100,000 persons will stand on this soil arid walk over the map of Ireland. At the
close of the fair all the Irish earth will be put into pots and disposed of at $1 per pot. . The most convincing
proof in the worldâ the attest of the parish priest; of the men who gathered this earth; the bills of lading of the
American Steamship Company; the custom house receipts from Philadelphia; port of entry of the bill of lading
of the Sunset route; the statement of C. D. Taylor of the American line, and General Passenger Agent Goodman,
will certainly satisfy any doubting person as to the genuineness of this Irish soil. All of these will be published
upon the arrival here of the valuable casks, August 6. On that evening a proper reception and parade In charge
of members of the honorary advisory board of the Celtic Union and all societies will be given, and It will be an
occasion long to be remembered. Thousands will line the streets and many newspaper offices and public build
ings will be illuminated.
During the three weeks that the Fair is expected to continue there will be hundreds of attractions to inter
est the student of Irish history and the lover of things unique and entertaining. In a quaint old garden at the
rear of Blarney Castle, on the main floor, artists have been busy during the past week painting a garden wall and
landscape scene. A small stage has been erected with its attendant scenery for the purpose of illustrating the
legend, of the blessing of the Blarney stone. The river Boyne is depicted In the picture, and appropriate char
acters and little children will participate in a little play written by J. A. Haron, who has earned quite a local
reputation for effusions in that line.
Copyright photographs of Charles S. Parnell, John Dillon, Justin McCarthy, Lord Mayor Sullivan of Dublin,
Daniel O'Connell, Wolfe Tone and other famous Irishmen have been obtained and will be sold in the photograph
booth especially designed for the occasion.
The committee on grocers' night of the Irish Fair are at work under the direction of Joseph A. Stulz. chair
man, and the date selected for their night is August 26. An excursion from Sacramento has been arranged, and
the grocers there will be notified to be present. The grocers of San Joee are arranging a San Jose grocers' night.
Tt is probable that there will be grocers' clerks' contests in wrapping and tielng up goods, as well as some gro- â¢
cers" athletic sports, and prizes for thl most popular grocery salesman and commercial traveler. All the grocers
of the city are Invited to be present on that night.
One of the best features of the fair, and most interesting, will be the preparation and spinning of flax. â¢
One lot will come from Ireland, and another lot from the agricultural experimental station, University of Cali
fornia. Berkeley, Director E. W. Hilgard writes Manager Buckley that they have two demands for their flax
crop, and that of the Irish Fair Is one of them. He says they can "ret" the flax straw, but cannot under
take to "break." "scutch " or "hackle" it. They think that among bo many Irish citizens some one can be found
to do this work. The spinning will be done by two ladies who have volunteered, and the spinning wheels will
Come from the Park Museum.
Another feature of interest will be the reproduction in fac simile of the famous Limerick treaty stone, and the
showing beside it of several small pieces of the genuine stone, proven to the satisfaction of all visitors! with a
certified piece of the .also famous Blarney stone; the reproduction of St. Kevin's wishing chair; of the' famous
cross of Glen-da-Lough, and other attractions. Not only all Celts, but the general public will see much of interest
at this unique exposition.

RAIDS THE CHINESE CLUBS
THIRTY-FOUR POLICE BREAK IN
DOORS, BUT GET NOTHING.
Sufficient Warning Given the Fan-
Tan Players to Enable Them
to Conceal Evi
dence.
Captain Wittman, he of the cold feet
and clammy shake, braced his feet up
against a stove at the Central Station
yesterday and his pedal extremities be
ciwne so warm that he decided to do
something. He became convinced that he
could run Chinatown better than the ser- |
geant in charge, so arranged a raid on the !
Incorporated clubs of the heathen. The
poor result of the raids on eleven clubs
should convince the captain that that j
kind of work is not his forte, and he
must seek elsewhere to find If there Is
anything he can do.
Thirty-four officers and sergeants armed
with sledges and search warrants boldly
entered Chinatown, battered down doors,
alarmed the Mongolians and succeeded In
capturing but fifteen alleged visitors to
fan tan games. The eleven clubs raided j
were located at 7 Spofford alloy, 735, 8Â»-0,
811 and 821 Washington street, lMs and 3$
Ross alley, 812 M. Jackson, corner of Jack
son and Washington, corner of Washing
ton ajid Waverly place, and corner of
St. Louis alley and Jackson.
The Shanghai Club at 800 Washington
stieet is the only one at which the oftl
cers were able to get the slightest bit of
evidence against the players, and what
was secured there will hardly convict.
The posse raiding this club was under the
dltection of Sergeant Martin. The other
squads were commanded by Sergeants
lUcManus, Chrlstensen, Duke, Anderson,
Harper and officers of the regular China
town squad, Tracey, Burke, Wilson and
Sullivan.
The raids on the Chinese clubs are
made quite frequently by the officers sta- j
tioned in that district and have to be
conducted with considerable caution. Gen- I
orally the only way to capture the gam- i
biers' in the act is for one of the officers j
to go into the place disguised or spy out i
the game by letting himself down to a
window by a rope from the roof, but when
the different squads went to the doors
last night in an open manner the look
outs immediately warned the players of
the presence of the police and a lively
scramble ensued. Beans were thrown '

IMPORTANT
RECORDS HAVE
DISAPPEARED
Police Exercised Over the Theft
of the Becker-Creegan
Papers.
Mysteriously Vanished From the County
Clerk's Officeâ Chief Lees Attempts to
Cover Up the Crime.
The greatest excitement prevailed at
police headquarters yesterday, due to the
discovery that the papers In the now cel
ebrated case of Becker and Creegan, the
noted bank forgers, were missing.
Shortly after 11 o'clock Chief Lees, who
was ignorant of the theft of the papers.
BÂ«nt for Captain Seymour, intending to
consult him as to the decision rendered
by the Supreme Court granting the forg
ers a new trial.
After discussing the advisability of fur- |
ther prosecution Lees sent for the papers
In the case. To' his great astonishment
he was told that they were missing, evi
dently having been stolen. Angered be
yond measure and determined to recover
the valuable documents at all hazards
Lees called in several of his best men |
and in lugubrious tones told them of j
what had happened. He carefully in
structed them to spare no efforts to find
the missing papers, as they were essen
tial In case he decided to again try the
Nevada Bank forgers. The County â¢
Clerk's office was searched but no trace |
of the papers was found.
In the meantime Lees, realizing his use- |
lessness in proceeding with the second I
trial of Becker and Creegan without the
all-important documents, sent for As
sistant District Attorney Black, to
whom he confided the discovery
that the papers were missing. It
was claimed by Lees shortly af
ter his conversation with Black that |
the papers had been recovered, having
been found in the office of the Assistant
District Attorney. Despite Lees' asser
tion, it is known that the transcript of ;
the testimony in the case is still missing, j
The District Attorney, however, has a j
copy, which fact evidently was not known j
to the Chief.
For some time past rumors of an at- j
tempt being made to steal the records In |
the case have been heard, but the police, j
thinking that . they emanated from a
friend of the defendants, paid no atten
tion to them. Becker, who is known as
the king of forgers, has frequently de
clared that he would not be sent to the j
penitentiary If money could save him. He
is said to be worth considerable money,
and often boasted that he would spend ev
ery dollar he had to "beat" the case. The
belief is that he handsomely rewarded HTe '.
thief who stole the papers for his trouble.
Not knowing that the authorities had a
copy of the transcript he conceived the
bold plan of getting away with it.
The thief presumably expected to find
the forged check among the papers, but
in this he was disappointed, as It had
been placed in the large safe In the Coun
ty Clerk's office.
Like the theft of the will of the late
James G. Pair, the parties Interested did
not count on the attorneys in 'the case
having had copies made which were of
fered in evidence and accepted by the
court.
Last night Chief Lees and his men were
diligently striving to find a clew which
would lead to the identity of the culprit
who disappeared with the papers In the
Becker and Creegan case. They are de
termined to leave no stone unturned to
land him in prison.
The County Clerk's office was turned
Inside out last night in a search for the
papers in the Becker-Creegan forgery
case. County Clerk Curry was routed
out of bed to assist In the search, and he
called to his assistance Deputy Mulcahy,
who has charge of the papers in all the
criminal cases.
Records could be found of the filing
of the original papers but no papers
could be found, with the exception of a
solitary affidavit of a witness of the ex
penses he had incurred in attending the
trial to give his evidence. Not even the
transcript of the evidence could be found,
and there was no record io show that
It had ever been filed.
Deputy Mulcahy, however, had knowl
edge of the papers being In the possession
of the office. They had been sent to the
Supreme Court at the time the case was
on appeal, and they had been returned.
They had also been sent to the printers
for the official printed copies to be made
and they had been returned, but they are
now missing, and even a printed copy
cannot be found In the possession of the
County Clerk.
Yesterday Assistant District Attorney
Black notified Deputy Mulcahy that a
typewritten copy of the evidence in the
case had been found in the possession of
the trial judge, but nowhere could be
found the original papers.

while Whitney took the net at every op
portunity. They proved too strong a team
for their opponents, who succumbed after
r. hard struggle. The score was 6â 4.
The second match was between Walter
and McGavin and Davis and Blanchard.
The latter came under the wire first to
the tunÂ© of Bâ6. This was the most
closely contested match of the day.
Whitney and Linderman met Kilgarlf
and Stauf in their second match set, and
the honors of victory again rested with
them. They won the set easily with the
ecore of 6â3.
Kilgarlf and Stauf then met Davis and
Blanchard. This was a long drawn out
set Several times the Bcore read deuce
in games, and it took Kilgarlf and Stauf
ten games to win the set. Whitney and
Linderman then played their third and
final match. They defeated McGavin and
Walter, 7â5.7 â 5. At one time the score was
four all. and at this atage the winners
were difficult picking. The last mutch of
the day was between Walter and Mc-
Gavin and Kllgarlf and Stauf, the latter
winning with the score 6âl.
Whitney and Linderman were the only
team that did not lose a same, and ac
cording to the regulations of the play
they were declared the winners of the
tournament. There was a tie for second
plaei:, each of the other teams winning
the same number of sets, but as no sec
ond nrize was offered the tie was not
played off.
Milton H. Esberk, one of the retired
players of t)ie coast, has a special match
on with another equally unpracticed play
er. George Whitney Is training Esberg
for the match, upon the resuilt of which
a champagne dinner has bean wagered.

GREATEST STAMPEDE IN
KLONDIKE HISTORY
DAWRON CITY, N. W. T., July 11
(via Seattle, July 30).â The Canadian
Gold Commission issued a proclama
tion July 9 declaring the Dominion hill,
creek and bench claims open for loca
tion by all persons holding free miners'
licenses. In less than one hour the
greatest stampede in the history of the
Klondike had started to Dominion
Creek, forty to seventy miles away,
over hills and marshes. Many women
joined the procession. In two hours
1100 people had reached the Bonanza
Creek ferry, two miles away.
The trip will require six days, and
will be attended by many hardships.
Some of the stampeders have already
returned in disgust. The value of the |
Dominion bench claims is entirely a .
matter of conjecture.
Dawson is now overrun with idle
men. No work is to be had either here i
or in the mines at any price. The j
population of Dawson is now estimated '
at 15,000. Many are living in tents.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
of without removal. J. N'oonan. 1017-1023 Mission.
Fears of a Famine Allayed.
ALLAHABAD, July 30.â The monsoon
prevails and rains have fallen throughout
India. The crop situation is, therefore,
satisfactory, and all fears of a famine
have been allayed.

ing the Patient in a Short
Time Without His
Knowledge.
There Is a cure for drunkenness that has shed

dreaded habit quietly and permanently.
The above is a picture of Mrs. John M. Hat-
ton of Lebanon, Ohio, who wrota as follows:
I shall never hesitate to recommend Qolden
Specific, for I entirely cured my husband, who
had been a hard drinker for years. From my
own experience I honestly believe this wonder-
ful remedy will save any drunkard, no matter
how far down he may of fallen. I write this
letter out of pure gratitude for the marvelous
change that has come Into my life. Faith-
fully yours, Mrs. John M. Hatton, P. O. box

Hundreds of others are reported, even the
worst cases where the habit seems to have

KANSANS ARE JOYFUL.
Gave a Cyclone Yell When
Told That They Were Going
to Manila.
A yoll of joy went up from the Kansas
camp yesterday morning when it was an
nounced to the men by Colonel Funston,
with the authority of Brigadier General
King, that the regiment had been selected
to follow the Seventh California to Ma
nila. It was further announced that one
of thf two boats now en route here from
British Columbiaâ the Tartar and the
A i hÂ»-naâ would be assigned to the trans
portation of the regiment.
That General Merrltt has gone further
than to merely ask for the balance of his
quota of troops is evident from the fact
that Brigadier General King is said to be
already aware of the troops that will be
under his command when he arrives at
Manila; They will be the Thirteenth Min
nesota., the First Tennessee and the
Tw-ntieth Kansas.
It is now practically a settled fact that
Brigadier General King will have com
mand of the next expedition. The "en
(â ral Is making all preparations for a
leavetaking in the near future. His per
sonal affairs are being put in shape as
are also the brigade affairs, and although
no orders are yet in his hands, it is as
sumed by those who will sail on the Ari
zona and SeandH that they will have
the popular brigadier for a commander.

The daily rout:n<Â» life of the volunteer

J along quietly. This is the characteris

they are rapidly b<Mng transformed from
raw recruits into veterans. The men of
the Fifty-first lowa Regiment were busy
yesterday in putting plank floor* into

of vast benefit to the men and will have
the tendency to reduce the number of

assistant surgeon and assigned to this
troop â¢ reported for duty yesterday to
Captain Came.
Captain Hitchcock, Company H, First
New York Regiment, who for the past
â¢week has been confined in the post hos
pital with an attack of pleurisy, was dis
charged yesterday as cured and has gone
to Alameda for a week to recuperate.
Private Callahan, Company E, same reg
iment, is ill in the post hospital with ty
phoid fever.. One case of measles devel
oped in the regiment yesterday and the
man was sent at once to the hospital,
where he was placed in the isolated ward.
The Twentieth Kansas Regiment, under
the command of Colonel Funston, will
be the next regiment to move from Camp
Merritt to Â« the Presidio. It will move
some time this week, and will go into
camp between the First New York Regi
men and the Wyoming Alger Light Bat
tery. The former- regiment moved a num
ber of its t<^t"Â» yesterday at. the order
of General Miller, which will give the
i^ansas ineglment abundance of room.
The division and field hospitals were
filled yesterday to their utmost capacity,
but there were no deaths, although there
are a number of men who are critically
ill in the former.
Colonel Wholley of the First Washing
ton Regiment and a number of his officers
have been assigned quarters in the houses
that were lately made vacant by the re
moval of the officers of the First Infant
ry, who were ordered East to participate
in the Santiago campaign.
RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.
Test of an Order Issued Rela'
ing to the Burial of De
ceased Soldiers.
On the field of battle, where thousands
of wounded soldiers demand Immediate
attention, there is excuse for delay , In
giving burial to the fallen, but at a gar
rison or camp remote from the scenes ot
conflict there Is no excuse for neglecting
the dead. The fact that tne body of Pri
vate Joseph Wheeler, late of the First
California, was moved from one place to
another for four days before it was laid
at rest In the National Cemetery Is not ;
creditable to the administration of mili
tary affairs in this department.
It is explained at General Miller's head
quarters that the fault of the delay in the
burial of the body of Private "Wheeler lies
solely with the Marine Hospital, in that
the officials of that institution failed to
notify General Miller where the body was
to be found.
To preclude a possibility of further mis
takes the general has caused to be issued
the following order:
HEADQUARTERS INDIANA DIVISION.
EIGHTH ARMY CORPS, CAMP MER

tainable facts connected with his death. in
addition to the Information stated above.
2. The Adjutant General of the division, on

By command of Brigadier General Miller. , ;'
DRILLED FOR CHARITY.
The lowa Regiment Gave an
Entertainment to Aid the
Needy.
The Fifty-first lowa Regiment gave an
other entertainment last night at the
Mechanics" Pavilion for the benefit of the
sick and needy, &nd a second time the big
building was crowded with the friends
of the gallant soldiers from the Middle
West.
The entertainment was tinder the aus
pices of the Lincoln Woman's Relief
Corps, and the funds derived from it will
go to alleviate the sufferings and distress
of the widows and orphans of the veter
ans of the late Civil War.
The first and second battalions of the
regiment, in commajjd of Major Hume,
furnished the programme. The splendid
band of the regiment gave a half hour's
concert before the exhibition drills com
menced. Companies E and C, in com
mand of Captains Mount and Stoepy. re
spectively, gave an exhibition of a skir
mish line of attack and retreat, and Com
panies L and M. in command of Captains
Pryor and Clark, gave excellent exhibi
tions in the manual of arms and physical
JOHN P. IRISH ON A WAR OF CONQUEST
To the Editor of the Callâ Sir: By an apparently concerted action the
Chamber of r"ommeree and commercial bodies of the country are demand
ing of the President the permanent retention of the colonial possession* of
Spnin. The reasons given are commercial, purely. There is no discussion
of this policy in its effect upon our political institutions. There 1? no
voice raided in statement of the effect upon our fifteen millions of labor
ing people. There is no attention Riven to the effect upon established and
growing agricultural interests, of the competition by cheap tropical labor
in similar lines.
The President and devotees of our Republican form of Government
must, however, give some consideration to the political problems involved.
Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber of Commerce, in his address to the
meeting of that and other commercial bodies, said that th^se possessions
"are ours by right of conquest." The President said under the solemnity
of an official utterance, "This Is not a war of conquest."
None of these commercial bodies suggests how these colonies, with
their nearly 20.000,000 of people, alien to us in race and education, arc to
be governed. Does Mr. Craig want them to become members of our body
politic, to bo our fellow-citizens, to have equal voice and representation
with us in the government established by the constitution, which is the
only government the President, the Congress and the Supreme Court can
administer? Or docs he propose to obsolete the constitution and establish
a government for 20,000.000 of colonists unknown to the fundamental law
and as unlimited as the Russian autocracy? For more than a century
we have lived under a written constitution, which establishes a govern
ment of perfect political equality. Can we extend that civil equality to
these tropical people? If we cannot do so by making them members of our
body politic they must be denied that equality. How long can the same
governmental authority be exercised in one place without constitutional
limitation in another within such limitation? These colonies, as non
memberp of our body politic, must be governed by a semi-military estab
lishment. They must be garrisoned. A navy equal to the combined navies
of Continental Europe must be provided to protect them. The American
taxpayer must pay the cost. The profit they yield will be a commercial
gar.ân othing can come from thr-m to the public treasury. They must be
' fortified, their rivers and harbors improved, their equipment in all re
spects made equal to the n'-edsoi commerce and to the resistance of an as
sault by any enemy. They cannot be peopled by our race, which does not
flourish, in the tropics. Their population must remain of the mixed Latin
and African and Asiatic races, which compose it now.
It will be seen then, that the American people have something to con
sider in this matter besides the dollar which, to the commercial instinct,
is made greater than all else.
By following our destiny within constitutional lines and limits we have
become the wealthiest of the nations. Why need we step out of those
lines and limits? Why need we assert the right of conquest, the most
hateful of all rights, the most destructive of human liberty and hap
piness? Is the Midas touch the only inspiration and the only aspiration
left to our people after six score years' experience of liberty?
JOHN P. IRISH.
NEEDED AT THE PHILIPPINES.
More Troops Will Probably Be Called For, Thus
Giving the Eighth California
a Chance.
In view of the fact that Major General Merritt cables from Manila that
all the forces assigned to him will probably be needed, owing to the bold
and defiant attitude of Aguinaldo, as cabled by Admiral Dewey. it is quite
likely that the surplus of troops remaining after the quota of 20,000 has
been forwarded to the Philippines will also go to the front. This surplus
will amount to over 3009.
There are now belonging to the Eighth Army Corps in San Francisco
four full regiments, aggregating 5200 men, and 1800 recruits, making 7000
troops. The Scandia and Arizona will carry away 3200, leaving the First
Tennessee, the Fifty-first lowa and the Twentieth Kansas to follow, and
possibly the Eighth California from Camp Barrett at Oakland, in case
there should be a call for more troops for the Philippines.
The transports that were first sent to the Philippines are expected
back about the middle of August, and will probably make another trip to
Manila.
It is expected that the first battalion of the First New York and the
third battalion of the Second Regiment of United States Volunteer En
gineers will sail to-morrow or Tuesday on the Lakme and North Fork for
Honolulu.
The sailing ship Tacoma, with a cargo of mules, horses and wagons,
will Bail some day this week for Manila.
exercise. There was a drill by the Second
Battalion, and the drill closed with a bat
talion parade and a review by Sol Canen,
the department commander of the G. A.
R. On the reviewing stand at the
march past were Assistant Adjutant
General T. C. Masteller, Major J. H.
Simpson, Colonel C. Mason Kinne and a
number of the officers of fhe First F I ;i
ment of Tennessee. At tfie conclusion of
the review dancing was commenced.
The officers and men of the two bat
talions were entertained at a luncheon
by the ladies of the Relief Corps at the
conclusion of the exhibition. Colonel
and Mrs. Kinne. Mrs. Comstock and
Mrs Staples had charge of the affair, and
to their efforts was due largely the suc
cess of the entertainment. A number of
the members of the Veteran Guard in
uniform, a<ted as ushers. Through the
courtesy of the Presidio and Ferries car
line and the California-street car line,
the snldiprs of the two battalions were
carried from their camp at the Presidio
to the Pavilion and return free of charge.
NURSES ARE CAPABLE.
Major Owen of the Division
Hospital Contradicts a
False Report.
The yellow Journal Is at It again. This
time Major Owen, the surgeon in charge
of the Division Hospital at the Presidio,
is the object of one of the Examiners

lished yesterday a resolution passed by
the Red Cross ladies of Oakland, deplor
ing the fact that all troops were not
moved from Camp Merritt to the Pre
sidio at once, and also a report brought
by Mrs Marie HacUermot from Major
Owen, In which that officer is quoted as

and that in consequence the patients are

thi<= report was true, replied: It is ab

and thi-v are working faithfully and hard.
The death rate is small when the many
obstacles that I have had to overcome are
taken into consideration. The nurses are
satisfied with their positions and they are

ANOTHER INVESTIGATION.
Accounts of ' Quartermaster
Green, Twentieth Kansas,
to Be Carafully Looked
Into
It is the intention of the officers of the
Twentieth Kansas to probe to the bottom
: the shortage in the quartermaster's â¢â  and
! commissary's departments. The latest
move was made yestejÂ£ay, when a board
lof survey was called to expert the ac
' counts of Lieutenant Green, regimental
quartermaster, in order to place the
i blame. for the numerous shortages that
! have been reported. .. . m ..__.. _ .
The board is composed of Major Frank
B. Cheatham, First Tennessee; Captain
Carroll First Colorado,, and Lieutenant
i W. Harry French, Fifty-first lowa.
Sufficient evidence is at hand, to t place
I Sergeant Young :as a disgraced prisoner
on the island without undue delay. ... â¢
The board engaged in inspecting the
accounts of Lieutenant Lafayette C.
Smith has not yet reported.
Two Mora Typhoid Ca~fs,
Despite the fact that Surgeon General
Mi.ldleton has ordered a rigid censorship
of all hospital news given out from the
different regimental hospftals, the fact
leaked 0U( yesterday that two more cases
of typhoid "fever had been discovered in
the ranks of the Eighteenth Infantry. The
victims are Privates Victor Llndho'.m,
Company X, and Frank E. Smith, Com
pany I. This makes a total of five cases
discovered in the Eighteenth in the past
week.
INFERIOR EQUIPMENT.
Board of Survey Ordered to
Inspect Accouterments of the
First Tennessee.
It has been found necessary to call a
Board of Survey to Inspect the equipment
of the First Tennessee Volunteers. A
month's use has developed the poor qual
ity of a number of the most necessary
articles; the canteens are leaky and are
covered with cotton Instead of canvas; the
shoes issued to the men have proved
worthless; the bayonet scabbards, a sec
ond-hand lot from Rock Island Arsenal,
are splintered and bent. The cartridge
boxes will also be Investigated. Instead
of being equipped with the army belt with
a capacity for 50 and 100 rounds, the regi
ment has been given the old style box,
which holds but twenty rounds. Numer
ous other articles of the regimental equip
ment will be inspected with a view of
thoroughly equipping the men before they
are ordered aboard theit transport.
The officers detailed for the board are
Lieutenant Colonel Childers, Major
Cheatham and Major Bayliss.
Novel Programme by Kan
sans.
The Twentieth Kansas Regiment will
give a most interesting evening's enter
tainment at Mechanics' Pavilion next
Thursday evening, the 4th of August, for
the benefit of the Army and Navy Chris
tian Commission work. They are prepar
ing many fancy drills. The regimental
band of the Twentieth Kansas is said to
be one of the best in camp. In addition
to the entertainment by the regiment the
band will give the following programme:
March, '"Stars and Stripes- Forever"
(Sousa); military fantasia, "The Twen
tieth Kansas, V.," arranged by Chief
Musician C. J^Jormly and dedicated to
Colonel Frederick Funston, C commanding
(descriptive, of the battlefield, charge of
the Rough Riders, whirl of battle, assem
bly of the victors and the fighting tune of
the Twentieth Kansas); idyl, "The Mill
in the .Forest," arranged by Merrielles
(descriptive); Mazurka Russa, "La Czar
ina" (Gauna); overture, "l'Espair de I'Al
sace," arranged by Clause; waltz, "Blue
Danube" (Strauss); march, "The Old
Veteran" (Bernard).
Mme. Alice Waltz will sine: "The Star
spangled Banner," accompanied by the
band. The athletic class of the Young
Men's Christian Association has pre
pared a most novel feature for the even
ing under the direction of Dr. Dietz,
which they style me "living pyramid of
flags," in which about thirty young men
will participate.
.. ,-.â â .. . . . â â¦ Â«
Another Day at Camp Merritt.
; As in the case of the Seventh California,
the orders instructing the Twentieth Kan
sas Volunteers to move to the Presidio
on Monday morning next have been re
, scinded, and it is now given out that the
| regiment will not go to its new camp
until next Friday.
The explanation for this sudden change
1 of plans is in the fact that the enormous
amount of preliminary work necessary to
a camp move would leave the Kansas
boys no time to practice for the exhibi
tion drill that they are to give on Thurs
j day evening for the benefit of the Army
! and Navy Christian Commission. This
; fact was laid before General filler by
I friends of the regiment and of the com
1 mission, and the general readily consent
, ed to a postponement of the moving day.
War Incidents.
First Lieutenant Delamere Skerrett of
the Third United States Artillery has been
appointed recruiting officer, and will open
an office in this city with a detail con
sisting of a sergeant, a corporal and a
private.
A second lieutenant's commission has
been issued to Major General Merriam'*
eon, and he has been assigned to duty
with the Third United States Artillery at
the Presidio.
HIS WHOLE LIFE
GIVEN TO CHARITY
ARTHUR G. SMILEY DIES AFTER
A LINGERING ILLNESS.
For Ten Years He Was Closely
Identified With Christian Res
cue Work in This City.
Arthur G. Smiley, superintendent of the
Boys" and Girls' Aid Society, died yester
day afternoon at his home, 1007 Capp
street, after a long and painful illness,
which was undoubtedly the result of
overwork. Mr. Smiley was only about 39
years old, but during- his all too short life
he has devoted ail his energies to helping
others. Thousands of Christian and char
itable people in this city will regret his
death, and thousands of young men and
women who have been torn from evil as
sociations and started on the pathway of
virtue and Industry will rorever remem
ber his kindly and loving assistance.
Mi. Smiley was "formerly registrar of
the Board of Associated Charities. About
five years ago he took charge of the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society, which was then in
a deplorable condition. His first act was
to inaugurate a new system of govern
ment at the institution, and he substi
tuted kind words and Christian love for
the harsh measures then in vogue. . He
abolished the "sweat box," which was
one of the features of the home, and
every Sunday morning he thr^w the doors
open and told the children to go to their
homes for the day aatl return at night.
During the live years Mr. Smiley was in
charge only twenty-five boys took advan
tage of their liberty and failed to return
when their furloughs expired.
An air of sorrow pervaded the home
last evening. The matron and teachers,
who have been associated with the de
ceased for many years, could not restrain
their tears when speaking of him and his
kindly, generous heart.
He was a son of the late Rev. G. W.
and Sarah N. Cooper Smiley of Lexing
ton, Ky., and came here about ten years
ago, since which time he has been closely
connected with local charitable and re
form organizations.

oration of the Event.
The twenty-fifth aftniversary of the or
dination of the Rev. M. S. Levy and the
seventh year of his pastorate as rabbi of
the Congregation Beth Israel were cele
brated in a most elaborate ami impressive
manner at the synagogue on Geary street
yesterday morning. The ladles of the
congregation had turned the interior of
the magnificent edifice into a veritable
bower of flowers, festooned with smilax
and myrtle. A large arch curved grace
fully over the chair of the rabbi, in the
rear of which were suspended the figures
"25" in flowers, while from the center
piece of the arch stood out in bold relief
the figure "7." There were also many
other beautiful floral pieces, remem
brances of individual members of the con
gregation.
The opening sermon of tho service was
delivered by the Rev. J. Leonard Levy of

lof the Congregation Beth Israel many
j changes have occurred. At that time the
congregation consisted of but fifty mem
bers. Since then the membership has been
increased to over 200. The floating and
bonded indebtedness, which amounted to
over $60,000. has been decreased by the
payment of all the floating indebtedness
and $10,000 of the bonded indebtedness.
Several societies connected with church
work have been established, the principal
! of which is the society to aid ex-convicts.
Much good has been done by the society,
and many an unfortunate has been raised
out of the depths by its help.
Since his ordination the Rev. Mr. Levy
I has officiated at over 1000 weddings, and
i has confirmed over 600 children. He has
i performed the service of the golden wed
ding ten times and the diamond wedding
once.
Besides the great amount of work re
quired of him by his congregation Rev.
Mr. Levy finds time to conduct the Jewish
i Times, the second oldest Jewish paper in
the United States. Notwithstanding his
busy life among the members of his con
| gregation and in the office of the Jewish
; Times, he takes the greatest pleasure
i among the members of his immediate
j family, which consists of a wife and six
children. Mrs. Levy, who Is the daugh
ter of a most eminent divine of Cornwall,
England, assists materially in the work
of tho church, to which she is well
adapted.

â¢THE POPULISTS
OVERLOOKED
Nd; Room for Them on
Registration Boards.
TURNED DOWN BY ALLIES
THEIR REQUEST FOR A FEW
PLACES WAS IGNORED.
Registrar Biggy Is Dissatisfied With
the Manner in Which
Officers Were
Chosen.
The local Populists now understand what
fusion with the Democracy means. They
believed that when they fused with the
Magulre-GallaQrher Democrats at Sacra
meh to. they would be rewarded by proper
Ition when the time for the distri
bution ( ,f th.' political plums arrived. The
first distribution of the plums was made
yesterday and not a plum fell to the Pop
ulistÃ. The Democrats took two out of
every three plums distributed and guvÂ©
their allies a lot of gilt-edged promises.
Promises are all right In their way, but
plums are better, no matter how small
may be the plums. The Populists asked
fty-three precinct registration offi
cers. How their modest request was re
ceived by the Democrats is best shown by
the list of officers selected. In each pre
cinct two Democrats were chosen and one
Republican. None of the officers bear the
Populist, label.
Mayor I'hclan and Registrar Blggy also
had iin unpleasant experience with the
commission. Auditor Broderick, City At
.- Creswell, Tax Collector Block and
Surveyor' Til ton were united on every
proposition and the Mayor and Registrar
received the same consideration that is
i â¢ proverbial white chip in a faro
fame. They were simply overlooked.
The ball started rolling when Registrar
Biggy. inquired it the commission intend
ed living up to the letter of the law, which
provides that all election and registration
officers mast be on the assessment roll.
"Do you want us to violate the oaths
we. have taken to support the constitution
of the State?" asked Attorney Creswell.
"The constitution explicitly sets forth that
property holding Is not a necessary quali-
' â¢ ficatlon. for office holding.*"
/'But there Is a law," . ventured Blggry,
'â¢ '-that reads that all election officers must
be on thÂ«? assessment list."
"I believe that law to be unconstitution
al." said Creswell in reply, "and bo does
the majority of the members of the com
mission.*'
"We have exercised all the care possi
ble," said Tax Collector Block, "In the
selection of the men who are to serve on
the present registration boards, and al
though some of them may not be on the
. assessment roll we personally know them
to be good men."
"But I want to know," persisted Biggy,
"if you intend living 'ud to the letter of
the law which provides that all these offi
cers must be on the assessment roll?"
"This is a meeting of the Election Com
missioners," replied creswell. "We are
not here to interpret the law for you."
"Why is it necessary," asked Auditor
Brodenck, "that the precinct registration
officers be on the assessment roll? They
are only going to do the same work the
. deputies you have in your office at pres
ent are doing, and I venture to say that
ilot one of your entire-force is on the as
sessment roll."
After a lengthy debate Mayor Phelan
made a motion that the Registrar be
â¢ given until, to-morrow .morning at 10
o'clirek â¢ to consult - tho assessment rolls
and ascertain if all of the clerks selected
wefc on it.
What is the use of wafting that much
â¢ time," said Cre swell, "for 1 know that j
over DO per cent of the men you named,
f" Mr. Mayor, are not on the assessment
roll?" ":...;.
. Block then moved that the list of Demo
. crats and Republicans presented be se
lected ten act as precinct registration offi
cers.
â¢ The motion prevailed, Mayor Phelan
alone voting against It.
The following is the list of officers

â y One-, of the most â¢ valuable items in

â â¢ remark Is frequently made that "cream
:.J.s t'^ expensive to use' freely." Such
people 'think they must have meat
e.yery. day at 10 and 23 cents per pound,
anil 'do not realize that 5 cents' worth
Vof 'pure, cream for breakfast will do
'.more to put on flesh than 25 or 30 cents
".â¢worth" of . meat.
. â  An ideal portion of breakfast is that
â¢â¢obtained from say, four teaspoons of
, Gra"pe-Nuts and a little, pure, thick
' cream.

I- The "Grape-Nuts, -consisting largely
of grape-sugar, have passed through
. processes similar to the first act of di->
â¢ gestion and are therefore most easily

SEATTLE, July 30.â The steamship
City of Seattle arrived this afternoon
from Skaguay with forty-four Klon
dikers and $2D0,000 in treasure and
drafts. The following were the wealth
iest passengers:
J. A. Gerrow, Seattle $101,000
George W. Burke, Helena 60.i*K)
George De Mars, Puget Sound 20,000
C. N. Hutchinson. Seattle 12,000
T. M. Schreder, New Mexico 10,000
W. W. Misner, Tacoma 10",000
While George de Mars brought out
only $20,000 in drafts and gold, he is
undoubtedly the richest man on the
boat. He has $500,000 on deposit in
the Canadian Bank at D&wson and the
money he brought out was to pay his
expenses before he returns. He owns
the whole of claim Xo. 9 on El Do
rad.o, from wjiich his wealth was ta
ken. It took eleven horses to pack
the gold taken out in the clean-up from
the .claim to Dawson.
â¢â  Geri'ow owned a claim on French
Hill, which he sold to a London syndi
cate for $51,000.
Burke worked claim 1 above Discov-
cry, on French Gulch, and says that
â the -.man who located Discovery claim
â  ori the gulch sold it for $1000 to a miner
named Sanderson, who has since taken
out $26,000.
Fully $50,000 in drafts and dust was
Jn the possession of three Klondikers
-. -who. arrived early this morning on the
â¢ ige City. They came out over the
Dalton trail .and wire longer getting
.. from â¢ Five â¢ Finger Rapids to Juneau
. than .the City of Seattle's passengers
were on the . entire trip.
â¢ The returning miners relate a sad
. ' story of overcrowding, sickness and
1 l.a-ek 'of .work at Dawson. It is the
. forerunner of what old timers say will
â¢T)&. it-he .greatest stampede ever seen
â .out 'of a mining country. While It is
said.' that there are 20,000 people at
Dawson it is believed that 10,000 is
Dearer? the correct number. The fact
remains that Dawson is overcrowded.
Wages have dropped from $15 to $7 50
a day, and there are three or four men
for every job. If the mine owners of
the rich claims abide by their decision
not to work next year unless the roy
alty is taken off, there will be prac
tically nothing to do at Dawson this
winter.
Half of the peope at Dawson are sick
with dysentery. The water is blamed
for the disease. The water is taken
from springs, but In truth is nothing
but surface water, and comes from
inciting snow. According to one of
to-day's . arrivals there is always a
deadly vapor rising from the flat near
Dawson, on which many cf the new
comers are encamped.
Hot weather aids In the spread of
disease, the thermometer registering as
high as 110 degrees.
FIVE MEN DROWNED

FAIRHAVEN, July 30.â News was

GRAHAM LAYS
ASIDE HIS GUN
No Longer Treads the
Warpath.
TRIES TO WIELD THE PEN
EXCUSES OFFERED BY THE SAN
JOSE BAD MAN.
lame Explanation of His Shady
Transactions as a School Trus
tee Operating Under
an Alias.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 30.â School Trustee
Graham has laid aside his gun and
taken up his pen in defense of his
transactions as a member of the Board
of Education. This morning's Mer
cury contains an article three-quarters
of a column in length, endeavoring to
explain his connection with the Cot
tage Grove Kindergarten. It presents
a rather lame excuse and a virtual ac-
knowledgment of the facts as given in
The Call. He assails The Call repre
sentative in the same untruthful, inde
cent and intemperate manner that
characterized his remarks when al
luding to the High School students'
protest against the dismissal of Profes
sor L. R. Smith from the High School.
Graham states there is such a per
son as J. N. White, and that his reg
istered voting number is 10,835. A thor
ough search of the city to-day failed
to reveal Mr. White, but it was learned
that Trustee Graham has a relative by
marriage by that name, and that he
is registered from 128 Locust street.
This is the number of Graham's resi
dence.
Graham declares that the building
and lot belong to Miss Mary A. Mc-
Donald, a sister-in-law. Here the
mystery begins. If the property be
longs to the person stated, why should
he have the bill for rent made out in
the name of J. N. White? is what peo
ple want to know. Miss McDonald is
a most estimable young lady, and if
she were securing the rent for the
premises used as a school the bill
should be made out in her name. In
stead the bill has been made out in the
name of J. N. White. Each month
Graham has received this check and
drawn the money on it. When the bill
first came up for payment it was made
out in the name of Miss McDonald, but
in the name of Miss McDonald, but
this was changed to J. N. White at the
request of Graham.
Graham states the Assessor's report
will show there are improvements on
the lot on which the school is erected.
This is not so, as a search of the re
cords will verify. That the building
was not assessed is due to the failure
of the parties intereated to report It to
Assessor Spitzer.
Chairman Wemple of the Board of
Education says that when the depart
ment rented the place for school pur
poses it was understood that one of
Graham's relatives owned it. He knew
the rent bill was made out to J. N.
White, but made no inquiries.
Ex-School Trustee O'Brien's state
ment was similar. He knew that
White had no interest in the premises,
but as the bill was a just one for rent
of the building he sanctioned its pay
ment.
Mayor Martin was busy behind
closed doors and refused to be inter
viewed on the subject.
There are fair . prospects that the
matter will be brought up and investi
gated at the next meeting of the
board.
Stmr. Grace Dollar will sail for St. Michael.

NBW YORK, July 30.â This was cup day
at Brighton Beach and a large crowd
gathered to see the great Hamburg prac
tically walk over for the $5400 first money.
Ogden took second money, $1250. There
was no doubt as to which of the Daly
pair was to make the pace, for Hamburg
began to go to the front at the fall of the
flag and as they passed the stand for the
first time he was ten lengths to the good.
In the backstretch he widened the gap by
half as much again, while Howard Mann
was a length in the front of Ogden, the
latter under a pull. Passing the stand
for the second time Hamburg was but
little short of a sixteenth of a milÂ© in
front of the others, who were then on
even terms and beginning to race. Ham
burg made the gap a good sixteenth, while
Howard Mann was through, Ogden being
a couple of lengths in front of him. At
the end Hamburg was a half dozen
lengths better than a sixteenth of a mile
in front of his stable mate, Ogden. It was
not a raceâ simply an exhibition gallop
by the best race horses of them all.
Leo Lake, favorite in the first race,
broke down. The track was slow.

Ten Years Ago She Was Known Here
as the Diego, Later as the

as the Guaymas.
The underwriters nnd ship-owners are
Ftil] worrying over the derelict that was
sighted off. Point Reyes a few days ago.
They are not at nil satisfied In their own
minds that the wreck is that of the bark
Forest Queen. That vessel was old, hav

*he would not hold together for any

â¢Jiatthe description would fit at

sehoo'ner that left Puget
Scmd last May is also overdue
and aem'fe of the underwriters think
it ml|yt be she. All doubt as
to the name, of the vessel would be set
at rest arj] a big menace to navigation
Vl) 'l H the Government would only

port.
The Merchants* Exchange recrlved the
following telegram from Mazatlan yes
terday: "The steamer Guaymas of the
Mexican Occidental Railroad Company
of Mexico foundered forty miles north of
Acapulco; The vessel went down gradu
ally. The captain had sent one of his
boats to Acapulco for assistance, but the
steamer sank before the help came. All
the passengers and crew, with the excep
tion of one sailor, were saved and are
now at San Geronimo."
The Guaymas was built In 188S and was
239 tons net burden. She was 151 feet
long. 27 feet 5 inches broad and 14 feet
1 Inch deep. Her engines were built by
\> B. Thompson of Dundee, Scotland,

SAND CRABS
VICTORIOUS
They Defeat the Famous
Gilt Edges.
DONLIN PITCHES SUPERBLY
UMPIRE SWEENEY'S DECISION
WAS PERFECT.
The Game a Great One From Start
to Finish and Was Won
Through Opportune
Hitting.
BY JOE CORBETT.
" Recreation Park was the scene of a
grand game of ball yesterday afternoon,
In which the famous Gilt Edges of Sacra
; mento met defeat at the hands of the
! Sand Crabs by the score of 2 to 1.
| A great crowdâ acknowledged by all to
be the largest yet seen at the park on a
Saturdayâ turned out, and testl!iÂ«-d their
appreciation of the excellent ball played
j by occasionally letting out a few links of
I their vocal abilities, directing their ap-
p lause. however, generally to Mr. Donlln,
the new acquisition of the Sand Crabs.
The gentleman is not new to the fans,
having demonstrated his abilities on a
former occasion when acting in the same
capacity for the "Florists" of San Jose.
j He was very good on that occasion, DUt
: yesterday he was simply great, and to
i his superior pitching is principally due
the Sand Crabs' notable victory.
In nine long yet interesting innings the
: Gilt Edges were able to connect with his
deceptive shoots but twice, and such a
performance certainly deserves commen
: datlon. His wlldness at times marred the
i excellence of his work, especially in the
j fourth inning, when, with the cushions
i full he gave his opponents their only run
i by giving the batsman a base on balls.
I Had he taken his time on this occasion
i just long enough to collect himself I doubt
' whether the Gilt Edges would nave
i ecored at all. He displayed symptoms of
1 being wild at the very beginning, yet
.managed to do most effective work All
! told, he gave eight bases on balU which
; is not so good, by-the-by. To offset th.s
wildness, he caused seven of his oppo
nents to fan the atmosphere, and a few
j of them did so at very critical stages of
| th HiÃ a sUJnÂ«Â«. however, was of very llt
! tie consequence, save on the occasion
i mentioned, for with it he combined ex
ceedingly clever work, not only In the box,
â¢ but at the hat and in the field. This clev
er work included a hot drive at Doyle In
! the second inning, which he beat out and
then instantly stole second through the
efforts of as pretty a slide as I have seen
th He B wolSed the plate shortly after on
Fitzgerald's cracking single with the first
run of the game. He is an all-round good
I player, and with better control of the
ball, would be a very hard nut to crack
for any team In the league.
His opponent, Doyle, pitched the kind
of a game that would win nine times out
of ten, and was also unfortunate, as the
i few hits made ofT him were opportune.
i He was steady and collected throughout,
but as I said tfefore, when hits were
made they came when needed, especially
so in the eighth Inning when the Sand
Crabs, by a base on balls and a three
bagger, tallied the run that decided the
came
And the scoring of this run was at
tended with a kick which, for a moment
took on a serious aspect. The Gilt Edges
threatened to quit the game, and things
In general became mixed, for the decision
of Sweeney was looked upon by a few as
very wrong. . , _.
The play in question happened In this
manner: with Devereaux on .first. S.trieb
hit for three bases. The ball was re
turned to the plate, and Stanley had it
Just in time to put his man out, but tell,
or rather Bat, on the plate. Â, ,
At the same Instant the runner slid In
feet first. Stanley, In his sitting position,
made an attempt to touch him and the
umpire called the runner safe. The play
was very close, and being undecided I
went to ; the club â¢ house - and > interviewed
those spectators and players, including
Mr. Sweeney, who were in a much bettter
position to see the play than I was, and
the opinions of all agreed that the runner
was safe. In view of this fact and. the
i convincing explanations offered â¢ I 1 came to
! the same conclusion, ami in consequence
! consider that the Sand Crabs won a great
contest. The game throughout wan an
excellent exhibition, Doth teams putting
forth their best efforts,. and doing so In a
laudable manner. A lightning double play
in which Devereaux was the central fig
ure and Peeple's great one-handed stop
caused Immense applause. In the field
both teams were equal,, each having an
error. The support accorded: the pltjch
tirety. The support accorded the ptfeh
ers was of course supewo, nd the game
In all its departments was worthy or the
big crowd.' The score follows:

TOOK "KNOCK-OUT DBOPS."
Frank Clayton Tries to Make a Bluff
Good in Judge Mogan's Court.
Frank Clayton, who was arrested a few
days ago on Kearny street by Detectives
Gibson and Wren while In the company
of a well known thief named Doughertv
and In whose pockets when searched two
vials containing "knock-out drops" were
found, appeared before Judge Mogan yes
terday on a charge of vagrancy.
The vials were produced in court and
Clayton declared that they contained a
mild solution of chloral which he was In
the habit of taking before going to bed,
as he was troubled with insomnia. To
prove the truth of his assertion he offered
to swallow the contents of both vials If
allowed half an hour between the doses.
The Judge consented and Clayton swal
lowed a dose. He was put back In the
dock to wait for half an hour before tak
ing the second dose, but in a few minutes
he began to squirm, and Attorney Tread
well, who defended him, had to run for
sugar as Clayton complained of the hor
rible taste. At the expiration of the half
hour he refused to swallow the other dose.
Clayton testified In his own behalf that
he had been working as a waiter in the
Bohemian Club, the California Hotel and
in Owen's restaurant on Ninth street. He
declared that he did not know that
Dougherty was a thief. The detectives
testified that Dougherty had used "knock
out drops" while stealing from his vic
tims.
The Judge continued the case till Tues
day, when he will give his decision.
Fred Bell a Defendant.
Evelyn P. Ferry flled suit yesterday
against Fred Bell to recover $1000 for
board and lodging and $GOO for services
rendered the defendant In the capacity of
a nurse during his illness two years ago.

WEARIED OF
LIFE IN JAIL
Antone Burgle Tried to
Commit Suicide.
MADE A ROPE OF HIS SHEET
IS SERVING A LONG SENTENCE
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER.
Tried to Kill Sigmund Braverman
Year Ago as Vengeance
for a Fancied
Wrong.
Antone Burgle, who is serving a seven
years' sentence for assault to commit
murder, attempted suicide In the County
Jail at about 5 o'clock yestc?rday morning.
The story of Burgles troubles is a long
one, and has already been told at some
length. In 18S5 he rented a store on Clay
street, near Kearny, of Louis Braverman
and opened a restaurant. His business
was a failure, and he finally closed up his
store, just in time to escape a writ of
execution about to be served upon him
by the Sheriff for failure to pay his rent.
A short time later he rented a place at
Washington street, where he started an
other restaurant.
The fates warned to be against him, as
this business venture also proved a fail
ure, and finally Mr. Braverman put his
bills for rent In the hands of a collection
agent. He was unable to realize anything
on them and put the whole matter in the
Sheriff's hands.
On the afternoon of July 14, 1897, a dep
uty sheriff visited Burgles place of busi
ness with a writ of attachment. The
restaurateur, made desperate by business
worries, declared that he would have his
revenge on the son of his "persecutor,"
Sigmund L. Braverman, who kept a jew
elry-store on Post street. The Sheriffs
deputy, while not thinking the man In
tended to carry out his threat, thought it
wise to keep on the safe side and warn
Mr. Braverman. He arrived too late,
however, as the duel in the jewelry-store
had already taken place, and both men
were under a doctor's care. Burgle got
the worst of It, however, and to this day
carries two bullets in his body. For a
time he was not expected to live, and
while on his bed at the Receiving Hos
pital made an anto-mortem statement, In
which he freely confessed his crime, say
ing further that he had intended ending
his life after he had killed Braverman,
but as he had failed he would do so at
the first opportunity.
Contrary to all expectations, he recov
ered, and on trial was convicted and sen
tenced to seven years' Imprisonment.
Since his confinement, while quiet, he has
been sullen and morose. Yesterday morn
ing a trusty, hearing a strange noise in
his cell, made an Investigation, and found
that the prisoner had maÂ«le a rope of his
bedclothes, fastened It to a convenient
projection and was slowly choking to
death He was cut down, and in the fu
ture will be closely guarded.
Pressed by Their Creditors.
Dr. W. F. McAllister was sued in the
Justices' Court yesterday for $12 55,
claimed to be due for coal furnished him
by A. H. Greenberg.
District Attorney Barnes, at present
captain of one of the volunteer companies
stationed at Camp Barrett, has been Bued

COURSING THROUGH THE FOG
PASHA KENNELS WITHDRAW
ALL THEIR CHARGES.
Coursing That Should Attract a
Large Gathering of Sport
Lovers To-
Day.
Excellent coursing was witnessed yes
terday at Union Coursing Park. The hares
did not run as strong as usual, but a few
days of fine weather and less fog will
make a great change in the game little
animals which are accustomed to a very
warm climate. Then, again, this is the
breeding season and hares never run well
during the summer months.
Owing to the death of a sister of Mr. J.
H. Rosseter, all of the dogs entered by
the Pasha kennels were withdrawn, there
by giving their fortunate opponents a
chance to win some of the money at stake.
The short-enders that won yesterday
were Obadlah, L. S. Conley, The Gossoon
and Koolawn.
The course between Flying Buck and
Koolawn was not in the least bit close as
the bitch led from the slip, scored first
turn and held her game well in hand to
the finish. She stands an excellent chancei
of catching the long end of the stake, if
not put out finally by Rosette. Quiver
and White Lily had a sharp argument.
The Lily led from the slips, but in a long
run up to game (Quiver closed the gap and
took charge after the first turn, scoring
rapidly on her opponent. Many people
thought ihat Quiver had put to his credit
the greater number of points, but Judge
Bull should know best and he decided in
favor of the favorite, White Lily. The
winners and losers of the run down are as
follows:
Open stake; seventy-two entries; result: For

INGLESIDE.
Excellent Sport in the Open
Stake Under Bad-Weather
Conditions.
The sport at Inglcslde Coursing Park
yesterday was of excellent class and held
the spectators' attention until the last
brace of dogs left the slips. For an open
stake, Where so many craok dogs were
contending, an unusually large number of
short-enders scored. The most notable
Instance was that li which LasPalmas, at
5 to 1, beat Granuule, the favorite.
J. Dean's Connemara is the favorite for
the stake, with the same owners' Moon
dyne the second choice.
The day was cold and blustery, and the
fog which rolled in late in the afternoon
obscured the last few courses from the
view of the spectators.
The following are the results of the run
down in both the sapling and the all-age
stake:

which I purchased at your office the 6th of last
i December CURED ME OF RUPTURE WITH-
I IN TWO MONTHS. I am over 60 years of age.
i There is no mistake about the fact that your
1 celebrated Truss will positively CURE RUP-
TURE, and I hereby heartily recommend it to
all ruptured persons. Yours sincerely,
:'": ;",:c . - C. S. COLLINS.
IC7If you don't want to remain ruptured and
have to wear trusses all your life, you should
! call at our office or send 2c in , stamps for our
."Pamphlet No.-l," and learn how to get cured.

For the explorer, the surveyor, tlie hunter*
miner, the lumberman, the sportsman or tourist,
Ripans Tabules are the one medicine that is con-
venient, always ready, portable, protected from
accident of Avind or wave, or climatic changes, and
In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred they fully
answer all requirements. Ripans Tabules will not
cure a cut made with an axe or a gun shot wound,
but in most cases the sufferer will be benefited by
swallowing one.

POLICE OFFICERS IN A BRAWL
A. B. ThomDSon and P. C, Peters Fight Uver
Dice and One Accuses the Other
of Rohhing Him.
A DICE game with drinks between each shake brought about a dis
graceful fight between Pollca Officers A. B. Thompson and Prince
C. Peters In B. F. Jellison's saloon at the corner of Kearny and Cal
ifornia streets early yesterday morning. As a result of the trouble be
tween the two men Thompson claims that Peters robbed him of $70 and
the matter -will undoubtedly be brought before the Police Commission
ers.
Both of the officers reported off duty Thursday evening to go on their
twelve days' vacation. Thompson was downtown Friday evening to pur
chase some articles and met Peters on Market street and asked him to
have a drink. At the suggestion of the latter the two went to Jellison's
saloon, where they became engaged In a dice game. Both men had been
drinking rather freely for about three hours, and during the game a dis
pute arose over the wager on one of the shakes and both grabbed for the
money. A quarrel followed, which soon ended in blows.
Tho only witness to the fight was the night barkeeper, Frank Baker,
and as he refused to give any information the participants themselves
are the only ones who could give any light on the cause of the trouble.
Thompson, whose right eye is in mourning, in telling his version of the
affair, said nothing about the game of dice lie explained that he met Pe
ters and went with him to the saloon where the fight occurred, and
after drinking lor several hours he made the remark to his brother of
ficer that he would leave Saturday for his father's ranch, up country.
Pulling six five-dollar and two twenty-dollar gold pieces out of his pock
et he remarked that he thought the sum would be enough to run him
during his vacation. Peters, he claims, snatched the gold from his hand
and placed it in his own pocket. At first he thought Peters was joking,
but when the money was not returned on request he came to the con
clusion that tho joke had gone a trifle too far. In the fight which fol
lowed Thompson got Peters on the floor and had considerably the beat of
the game. The under man begged to be let up and promised to return the
money. Thompson allowed him to rise to his feet and received a nasty
punch In the right eye.. Peters then ran out of the saloon with the
money still in his possession.
Friends of Officer Peters say that Thompson is a "hard loser," and
that the entire affair was nothing but a dispute over the ownership of
the pot. Both claimed it and Peters managed to get possession of the
money. It Is believed by Peters' friends that Thompson lost his money
and is now trying to get even by accusing Peters of robbing him.
Thompson drew his month's salary yesterday morning and left for
his visit with his father. He made no charges before leaving, but says
that he will report the case to the Police Commissioners. Sergeant Mar
tin knows of the fight and the claim of Thompson that he was robbed
and it will probably fall upon him to make an investigation of the case.
RED CROSS SOCIETY
TAKES A FIRM STAND
IT WILL IGNORE COMPLAINTS
IN FUTURE.
Sympathetic People Who Report
Lack of Attention to the Sick
to Be Referred Else
where.
Alleged sympathetic people who sup
posedly have the interests of the boys in
blue at heart have caused no end of an
noyance and trouble to tTie hospital vis
iting committee of the Red Cross Society
by repeatedly reporting instances of latk
of attention shown the soldic-rs by their
own surgeons and nurses. Believing some
foundation to exist for the continued
complaints, the ladies composing the
committee have devoted time and labor
in investigating, with the result that no
truth in the stories can be found.
These continued reports have led Mrs.
John F. Merrill, president of the local so
ciety, to write a personal letter to the
commanders of the various regiments sta
tioned in this city, in which she says:
"In view pf the many exaggerated re
ports brought to our society and pub
lished in the newspapers in regard to the
Inattention of the officers and medical
men to sick soldiers in camp, it has au
thorized the publication of a letter in the
daily papers to the effect that the society
will in future pay no attention to indi
vidual criticisms and will simply refer
persons bringing such reports to the
commanding officers of the regiment. Our
visiting committee will hereafter visit the
regiment ;il bos) itai every other day, but
wili furnish requisition papers, which. In
case of emerge by, if mailed to 16 Post
street will be honored. Kindly report
this to surgeon in charge of regimental
hospital."
The Red Cross Society of San
Francisco cannot be responsible
for the criticisms of the camps
which are brought to the offices
by individual visitors day by
day of alleged inattention on
the part of officers and physi
cians toward the men in vari
ous regiments. Many reports
in regard to the suffering of
men have been investigated at
great inconvenience and disad
vantage to the society. Our
committee has frequently found
those reported ill and dying re
ceiving excellent hospital care
or attending to their own busi
ness downtown. We refuse
from this date to pay any at
tention to such exaggerated re
ports, preferring to refer such
information to the commanding
officers of the regiment criti
cized.

War Revenue Taxe3.
As was told exclusively in The Call re
cently, many proprietors of 25-cent
French restaurants have either charged
5 cents extra for cognac and kirsch water
or discontinued their use altogether on
account of the special revenue tax. Owing
to the falling off of their customers, due
perhaps, to the failure to provide these
liquors, they have again decided to place
thorn on their tables. Yesterday was the
last day on which those required to pay
special war revenue taxes might procure
their certificates, and the office of the
Collector of Internal Revenue was
crowded until long after the usual hour of
closing.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with

DECEPTION IS
RECOMMENDED
Wells- Fargo's Disloyal
Request of The Call.
TO EVADE PAYING THE TAX
SUGGESTION THAT ALL COPIES
BE PLACED IN ONH EUNDLfc.
This Paper Will Compel the Express
Company to Do Its Duty
at All Haz
ards.
Wells, Fargo & Co. Is going through
a series of distressful contortions
in its unpatriotic efforts to evade
payment of the war tax. After having
Insisted that Its patrons shall pay the
tax when the law says that the cor
poration must pay it, it is now prepar
ing a soft place upon wnlch to fall
when the courts shall force this recal
citrant company to do its duty and
obey the law. Yesterday the company
sent an official around to The Call busi
ness office with the following notice:
Commencing August 1 Wells, Fargo &
Co. will issue a receipt for each bundle
or package or newspapers delivered to
them for transportation, and to each a
receipt a one-cent "I. R." stamp will be
attached and canceled, for which the
shipper must pay. Any number of bundles
or packages, regardless of their size or
destination, may be made into one gen
eral bundle, for which only a single re
ceipt and stamp will be required.
To avoid delay at time of shipping,
Wells, Fargo & Co. propose to count the
bundles when received by them and from
the tally to make out the receipts at their
earliest convenience, and at the end of
each week to deliver same to the ship
pers and collect for stamps.
Provided, that but one bill of lading
shall be required on bundles or packages
for newspapers when inclosed in one gen
eral bundle at the time of shipment.
In other words, the company wishes
The Call to assist it in defrauding the
Government out of its dues by sending
The Call's whole edition in a bundle as
big as a house and to accept from the
company one bill of lading for the
whole with a 1-cent stamp â even this
cent to be paid by the newspaper.
When Manager Doyle was asked for
an explanation of this proposition he
replied that the wording of the proviso
relating to newspapers admitted of this
interpretation, and that newspaper
bundles designed to be sent to Alaska,
Mexico, Los Angeles, Siskiyou and Sac
ramento could be covered with a big
sheet of tarpaulin and tied around with
a rope. This would make one bundle,
he ingeniously explained, and there
would be only 1 cent to pay, don't you
see?
The Call will not enter Into such a
dishonorable arrangement or conspir
acy with the express company to de
fraud the Government of a war tax
which should be paid honestly, cheer
fully and not be evaded. It proposes
to mail its copies for San Diego in one
bundle and its mail for Fresno in an
other, and so on, with the bundles de
signed for every town wherever the
paper may go, and to demand a bill of
â¢lading upon each and every one of the
packages, as iÂ« provided by the law. It
proposes also to make the express com
pany pay the tax, for that is what the
law says and what the courts have de
cided that it says and means. If it
should happen that the shipper must
pay it The Call will produce the money
and the stamps willingly and cheer
fully. Because Wells, Fargo & Co.
desire to shirk i .sponsibility The Call
does not propose to be placed in the
same category.
This is the stand The Call has taken
from the first, and it will adhere to it
to the last. What we said editorially
on May 21 of this year we repeat to
day. Here is the article in full:
PROPOSED TAX ON NEWSPAPERS.
THE CALL'S REPLT TO A REQUEST
WHICH WAS NOT DICTATED
BY PATRIOTISM.
The following self-explanatory dispatch
was received l.y The Call last night:
CHICAGO. May 20.â T0 Newspaper Pub
lishers: The war tax bill now pending
in the Senate contains a provision putting
a tax 'of 1 cent on every package forward
ed by express, including bundles of news
papers. If prompt action is taken by
newspaper publishers telegraphing Sena
tors ft will be practicable to secure an ex
emption of newspaper packages, or at
least of all packages containing less than
100 copies. It is suggested that publish
er.- takf the matter up promptly and en
ergetically. CHARLES W. KNAPP,
President American Newspaper Publish
ing Association.
Compliments to Mr. Knapp, and what
sort of an American paper does he
suppose The Call to be? While there
was a prospect of war the papers did
much to promote It. Now for them to
endeavor to sneak out of paying a
share of the expense would be cowardly
and unpatriotic. They are engaged in
print'ng the news of the war and in
Belling the accounts to the public. They
are even assuming the right to direct
the Government. Vet. here is more
than an Intimation that the publishers
of newspapers are so detestably nel
fish, so' lacking In the elements of good
citizenship and honor that they would
evade a responsibility when the evasion
would savor of treason. When the
country is sending its men to battle,
â when every nerve is strained to provide
the means of equipment, when the
plain duty of every man Is to do his
part willingly and the natural impulse
Is to do it eagerly, the supposition that
publishers of daily papers are a class
apart, a set of thrifty vampires draw-
Ing substance from a country they are
too mean to defend and too low to live
In, comes with a shock. If Mr. Knapp
thinks he is dealing with a lot of
knaves, to undeceive him Is a pleasure.
He is dealing with men, and men who
are proud to be Americans. Any citi
zen who is capable now of acting as
Knapp is counseling could do the coun
try no better service than to leave it.
He is a traitor. He might feel at home
In Spain.
The Call is willing to pay any tax the
Government may impose. It will pay
a cent a bundle or 10 cents. It will
leave to legislation the settling of the
limit and make no protest. It will be
glad to know that it can contribute.
Any paper that objects to sharing the
common burden is unworthy the sup
i port of citizens, untrue to the flag, and
I the sooner it shall cease publication the
I better for the patriotism of the land.
GEORGE H. THOMAS POST.
Notable Speeches at the Anniversary
Banquet â Distinguished Guests
Present.
One hundred veterans and several
guests of George H. Thomas Post No. 2,
Grand Army of the Republic, assembled
in the banquet room on the eighth floor
of the California Hotel last evening at
6:30 o'clock and did not adjourn until mid
night. The banquet took the form of an
intensely enthusiastic demonstration of
patriotism and eloquent eulogy of Ameri
can achievements on land and sea. Some
notable speeches and happy hits were
made during the evening.
Among the g^iests at the table were:
Major General Merrlam, Brigadier Gen
eral Miller, Brigadier General Charles
King, Colonel William C. Smith. First
'xennessee; Major Edward Field. Second
Artillery; General Warfield, aid; James B.
Stetson.
The speakers were Selden Sturges, War
ren Olney, Major Field, Elisha Brooks,
Colonel W. C. Smith, E. E. Ewing and
General W. H. L. Barnes.
J. Murray Bailey, commander of the
post, opened tne ceremonies with fitting
remarks. Ex-Senator Bart Burke was
toastmaster. a posuion which he filled
with admirable tact, being ably assisted
by A. J. Vining, chairman of the com
mittee, and W. J. Watson.
Ti.ere was not a happier expression dur
ing the evening than a remark of Major
Field, "That a man who was not at this
time proud of being an American must
be either a tramp or a Harvard profes
sor."
Warren Olnry's reference to our kindred
across the sea evoked great applause.
Colonel Smith read with tender effect the
beautiful poem. "On the Rappahanock.
recently published in The Call. General
Barnes made an eloquent speech, as
usual. Mr. Brooks paid a fine tribute to
General Shaffer, a comrade of the post.
Ma iy tributes were paid to the valor ana
pin erlty of those who wore the gray,
anÂ«. Colonel Smiiu. the ex-Confederate
vet >ran. received a great welcome.
FOUJSiD HIS WATCH.
W. S. Wood Pails in His Attempt
to xfoodwink the Police.
Captain Glllen of the Seventeenth
street station Is satisfied thnt the sensa
tional burglary which was said to have
taken place at the residence of W. S.
Wood, 114 Fourteenth street, -was told for
the purpose of defrauding the Fidelity
and Casualty Company of New York.
Last Thursday morning "Wood, who
claimed he was connected with the real
estate firm of Speck & Co. rushed breath
lessly into the Seventeenth-street sta
tion and announced that his house had
been entered by burglars, and jewelry
valued at JSOO taken. He claimed .hat
he and his wife had been chloroformed by
the desperate men, who, he supposed,
were Eastern crooks.
Captain Gmen at once sent for Detec
tives Fitzgerald and Graham, the sleuths
of the Mission district, and they were or
dered to make an investigation. Last
night they found the gold watch which
Wood claimed was stolen from him.
Wood had sold it for $40 a short time be
fore the alleged crime was committed.
VAN NESS AVENUE BURGLAR.
Dr. Taylor's House Entered, but the
Thief Was Scared Away by
a Domestic.
A bold attempt to break In and inciden
tally loot the residence of Dr. A. Miles
Taylor, 928 Van Ness avenue, was made
by a lone burglar late Friday night. Dr.
Taylor and his family left the residence
early in the evening, leaving a young
â woman, a domestic, in his employ, In
charge of the house. The departure of
the family was evidently observed by the
thief, and in all probability being un
aware of the presence of the domestic he
decided to give the family a surprise
upon its return home. About midnight
the domestic, who was working in one of
the back rooms, was startled by the
sound of a key being worked in the back
door. She listened for a moment
and, to her surprise, heard a
sound as though a heavy bar was
being forced between the lock and the sill.
She hesitated no longer and, running to
the window, she threw it open and
screamed at the top of her voice for help.
Many people in the neighborhood heard
her screams and Mr. Miller and Harry
White, who occupy the upper flaj, 930
Van Ness avenue, bounded downstairs
revolvers in hand to the rescue of the do
mestic. The burglar heard them coming
and started on his run for liberty. He ran
through a little alley into Ellis street,
turned west into Van Ness avenue and
disappeared.
The case was reported to the police at
the Central station and an effort will be
made to apprehend the would-be burglar.

sult of the -fixfet "explosion. ':' â  '
â¢ The. inquest was held In the heart of the
powder works arid most .of the witnesses
.>* ere called, 'from their .dangerous work
to: tell what they knew, of the fearful
./death. of 'their' comrade's. Each had an
â¢ interesting story to tell; either of a hair
breadth: escape or of the action of dyna
mite scum or of their idea of the cause
of .the. catastrophe. A brother of one of
the victims, .Alvarez,' is evidently â  a fa
; talist. He believed his brother's time had
'come arid.he had to go.

I come and he had to go. li his time had not come he would not have
-*- been killed. He had left the house and was on his way to breakfast
with McKay. He remembered that he had borrowed Herbert Stratton's
rule, and he told McKay he would go back and return It. He was ad
vised hot to bother, but ho returned, and no sooner had he reached
Strattnn than the explosion occurred, and both were killed. That shows
his time had come. He was a very careful roan, and would not have

which was afterward found in the wreck
: â  r some dynamite scum that had been
mixed with sawdust. Oh the end of the
fuse I should presume a percussion cap,
:â¢:. or perhaps a giant cartridge, was fixed.
This would cause the first explosion. The
second explosion, which occurred five sec
onds or bo later, would be the explosion
of the blowtank, which would be caused
by the concussion from the first explo
sion. The going \jp of the blowcask
. would naturally create considerable dust,
and after a couple of hours, I think, the
explosion which killed the men occurred
as the result of this dust settling- on the
filters and being decomposed by what lit
tle oil was in them."
"I think Mr. Bermingham, the assist
ant superintendent, did perfectly right
when he started In to cltar away the
: -wreck. I should have advised him to do
last as he did, had I been on th* ground.
I am at a loss to explain the affair, ex-
Cf-pt on the ground of foul play. I do not
..-â ':â¢ think .that there was any intention to
kill,- but unfortunately the first explosion
led to-the second, that was fatal."
John Birmingham Jr., son of the presi
dent of the company, said that he knew
all the unfortunate men well, and all weie
;. â  careful: "After the first explosion," he
said. "I tried to call up Mr. Quinan for
v ''â  Instruction, but when I found I had to act
: myself, I called out the men and started
to clear away the wreck. None of the
men objected to working, but all worked
w.lih a will. One of the men brought me a
fiece of fuse that was found in the ruins.

Â' month ago, but I have no reason to think
that any one should want to blow up the

IS on the part of the assistant euper
ndent to start clearing the wreck as
i as possible to avoid fire. No one sug
ed that any one be blamed for
death of the men.
le experience of J. a. Sandell was un
common. He was working about six feet
from the filter when the second explosion
occurred, and he did not hear It. "1 saw a
tong-ue of flame," saiu Sandell, "about
six feet from me. I did not hear the ex
plosion, but I was knocked down, and
when I got up 1 saw that some of the
men who had been near me were killed
and others were Injured. The flash came
from a tank. I cannot give any reason
for the explosion, but I am satisfied that
it was the best thing to do to clear away
the debris."
Then came old John McLaln. who has
been In all the explosions for twenty-four
years and come out of all unscathed. He
heard the three explosions and running
to the -wreck he put out a small fire and
soon all the men came to work. About
5:30 another explosion occurred and at that
time ne was about forty feet away, but
did not get hurt. McLaln created some
amusement by the manner in which bÂ«
repudiated the Coroner's suggestion that
he was an expert on fuse. "I'm no ex
pert," said McLain, "but I've handled
fuse for twenty years and I know all
there is to know about it. This piece of
fuse should not have been near the house.
It is the kind of fuse that is being used
by the Valley Road contractors about half
a mile away. It was brought to the
works by come one who wanted to do
damage.''
Charles Alverez, a brother of one of the
victims, was present and he frequently
asked questions of the witnesses that mi
i dlcated he was not satisfied as to tho al
leged cause of his brother's death. When
; he was put on the witness stand his story
â¢ wrs somewhat of a surprise.
Moses Murphy, the 6on of Patrick Mur
phy, was also a witness, but he could
give no evidence except to testify to his
fathers age and the children left desti-
Constable Mike Scanlon, who was born
In Pinole 42 years, ago, and who has lived
there ever since said it was impossible
for any one to crawl through the wire
fence from the county road and to have
reached the works. He said that he had
seen several pieces of fuse similar to ihe
"" e . found in the wreck,' and he was told
that when blasting the burned fuse some
times btew hundreds of feet away
Several witnesses testified along the
same lines as the others, and after several
hours of testimony vie matter was given
to the jury. There was over an hour's
argument among the jurors, as some one
had snld that a man named Morgan had
told two lady friends that ho had started
the explosion by using a hammer at the
house. It was proved that Morgan was a
long way off at the time of the explosion
and when the jury was notified of this
they returned a unanimous verdict.

E. NORWOOD JONES
CHARGES BLACKMAIL
AVERS THAT FBANCOETJB IS
GUILTY OF EXTORTION.
He Does Not Deny Complicity as to
Annie Johnson's Death, but
Makes Grave Charges.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 80.
E. Norwood Jones, who Is being sued
for a divorce by Gertrude K. Jones, with
whom. he is sued on a note for $500, to-day
tiled answer to the charge placed against
him. While he does not deny his associa
tion with the Annie Johnson scandal, he
alleges that he is the victim of blackmail.
Jones, who Is in the East, and who only
through the shrewdest detective work was
served with a summons, tells his story as
follows:
He avers that he has at all times lived
in utter happiness with his wife; that
ft-" 1 September 1 . 1896. to November of
L h . e * amp year. Annie Johnson lived at the
home of Mrs. Jones, and that In Decem
if ,Lin me 7 ear the woma became
ill. and in the January following died
from a criminal operation. At that time
Jones alleges, some relatives of Annie
Johneon approached him, claiming that
they had evidence which would tend to
fn nn w t ? h and an associate of complicity
in her death and that thereupon his as
sociate, in order to suppress the a leged
evidence and to protect himself from the
scandal and possible prosecution, em
ployed Attorney Francoeur for $500 This
money was subsequently paid wltn $150 be-
Jones then charges Francoeur with a
grave crime. He alleges that on m, t 1
1897, the plaintiff demanded o "him Wo*
more for his services; Jones refused to
pay it and then the attorney threatened
the defendant ,and his associate that if
the extra $500 were not paid or secured by
a note signed by defendant and wife he
would bring suit and expose to the pubHc
all the alleged evidence in reference to
Jones' knowledge of -the death of Annie
Johnson. It TCaa impelled by this threat
that, Jones claims, he signed the second

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, STTNTDAY, JULY 31, 1898.
A POLITICAL
COMPLICATION
IN OAKLAND
Buckley-Maguires to Take Part
in the Republican Pri
maries.
Hilborn Finds That Metcalf Has Been Doing
Some Practical and Successful
Politics.
OAKLAND, July 30.â The Democrats of
Alameda County have aroused themselves
from their lethargy, and to-day Chair
man Con Brosnahan called a meeting of
the County Committee for next Tuesday
night at R. F. Fitzgerald's office, for the
purpose of issuing a call for a primary to
elect delegates to the State convention.
The members of the committee are un
decided whether to hold an open primary
or elect delegates at club meetings. On
account of the shortness of the time be
fore the convention meets, in addition to
I a marked apathy on the part of the Ala
meda Democracy toward using their time
and money to journey to Sacramento for
the purpose of ratifying the nomination
of the "Little Spotted Giant," the club
system will be probably adopted.
The primary will be held either next
Saturday or a week from Tuesday, most
likely on Saturday, the county being en
titled to forty-three delegates under the
apportionment of the State Central Com
mittee.
The Democrats, just now, are more in
terested in the antics of Pardee than they
are in their own misfortunes. For the
! cake of diversion, a number of them have
i contributed to the gayety of the ca.m
i paign by "boosting" the doctor's fight,
i and they say "there are others." They
: make no concealment of their expectation
j of heavy reinforcements of Buckley-Ma
! gulre heelers from the other side of the
bay to participate in the Republican
; primaries, and they grin as they talk of
1 the lesson in practical politics the Buck-
I ley-Maguire "push" will give the Davis
1 crowd.
That Pardee's intimates are fully cog
; nizant of the contemplated invasion is
| all too apparent. Buckley's gang doesn't
1 dip into Republican factional fights just
j for the health of the members. They
make their living by the stuffing of prim
aries and such workâ and Pardee has
money enough to fill a cistern.
These stories are very disquieting to
the Davis crowd, but tTley are taking
such steps as they can to head off the
raid though they acknowledge that a
i combination of Buckley and Pardee is
| difficult to overcome. However, they are
perfecting their organizations in every
ward, and besides are paying particular
attention to the outside townships, while
!bo far Pardee' b energies have been con
centrated on the capture of Oakland.
While busied with their own affairs and
watching the movements of each other,
both Pardee and Davis were thrown into
a nervous chill during the week by the
mention of M. M. Estee's name as a gu
bernatorial candidate. Although the
friends of the rivals endeavored to con
vince them that the mention of Mr. Es
tee waa a mere formality that must be
g-one through in every campaign, the pos
â Bibllity of still further complications to
the already badly mixed situation wa3
enough to cause the two Alameda aspi
rants extreme mental depression for the
time.
The Populistsâ that Is the members of
the People's Party who refused to be
swallowed by the fusion anacondaâ appear
to be quite determined to make a vigor
ous fight for Shanahan. The county will,
be thoroughly organized and clubs formed
In every ward and township. The Popu
lists will put a full county ticket in the
field and declare they will prove them-
Fflvf-s a large and sharp thorn in the sides
of the other fellows.
Congressman Hilborn has taken a care
ful survey of the field since his return
from Washington, and as a. result is
forced to admit that Victor Metcalf has
stolen a march on him during his absence.
Hilborn finds his own forces in this coun
ty somewhat disorganized, while Metcalf's
friends, by their system of house meet
ings, have made big progress toward per
fecting a systematic campaign for thÂ«
Congressional nomination. Moreover, Hil
born finds that in rewarding his political
manager, W. H. Friend, with an Oakland
postmastership, he badly handicapped
himself, for since his appointment
Friend's hands have been tied by the
"offensive partisan" law, while Metcalf's
friends have been free to take advantage
of every opportunity.
The action of the County Committee
Thursday, In keeping the State and Con
gressional primaries separate, was in ac
cordance with Metcan s wishes and di
rectly opposite to Hilborn's ideas. From
the time he decided to enter the Congres
sional fight Metcalf aimed to have that
kept entirely distinct from the other pri
maries and convenions. When Hilhorn
returned he decided that his interests
would be advanced by joint primaries but
he was too late to offset the work done
by Mptcalf.
When Hilborn took his first stroll down
Broadway after his return from Wash
ington he dropped into Nat Rosenberg's
stand and laid down a quarter, naming
his brand. As he did so he remarked
"Well, Nat, how's the Congressional
fight going?"
"Oh, we've decided to send Mr Mp.t
calf back next term," replied the cigar
dealer.
"You don't mean to say that my friends
have gone hack on me?" anxiously in
quired the statesman.
"Not gone back on you exactly, but
they've sort of made up thrir minds that
as long as Metcalf has made up his mind
that he wants it. it would be a nice thing
to let him have It."
Hflborn left the cigar stand pondering
over the ingratitude of a trusted con
stituency, but he ie not discouraged H&
haa set to work with a grim determina
tion to win out, paying particular atten
tion to the up counties, where he claims
to be strong enough to more than offset
Metcalf's vote In this county.
Alex. Rosborough returned from the
Klondike to-day, to the surprise and de
light of hiÃ friends. Alex, says it Is all
very nice to sweep up gold In the Arctic
but he knew Alameda County could not
get along without him this fall. Of
course, Alex, will be given the nomina
tion for some county office on the Demo
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

cratic ticket, but which Is yet to be de
cided upon. It is probable, however, that
the County Clerkship will just about fit
his ideas of the comforts of life, and if
it does he will give his opponent, who
ever he may be, a hard run for his money,
for Alex, can have almost anything he
wants here.
Rosborough is the second Klondiker to
return in time to mix up in the political
broil. "Jim" Stanley, the Mission S.tn
Jose blacksmith, got back two weeks ago,
and already has thrown himself into the
thick of the fight for Equalizer against
Morehouse. Stanley is immensely pop
ular throughout the county, as evidenced
by his election a_s Public Administrator
for four successive terms, refusing a
ronomination for the fifth term two years
ago.
Stanley, though a faithful officer, is not
much of an orator, but his friends will use
with good effect the only two speeches
he ever made. The first was delivered
ten years ago upon the occasion of his
first nomination for Public Administra
tor. "Gentlemen," said Jim, "I'm no
speech-maker, but I want to say this. I
have an idea that nolding an office is
easier than hammering iron, and I am
anxious to see If my idea is correct."
The second speech was delivered two
years later upon his renomination. It was
this: "Gentlemen, two years ago T had
an idea that holding office was easier
than hammering iron, and I wanted to see
if I was right. I have tried it and have
found to my entire satisfaction that hold-
Ing office is much more congenial to me."
TWO IDEAS
ON ONE POINT
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 30.
Superior Judges Greene and Hall are at
loggerheads on the question as to
whether petitions for involuntary insol
vency can be filed within four months
of the passage of the national bankrupt
act, which went Into effect on the Ist
inst.
Judge Greene has refused to recog
nize any petitions in Insolvency which
are affected by the national law, holding
that the latter law abrogates the State
law. The national act provldts that no
voluntary insolvency petition snail be
filed within one month of its passage,
and no involuntary insolvency within
four months. In this respect Judge
Greene holds the same opinion, and in
terprets the Federal law as does Judge
Belcher of San Francisco and Judge W.
M. Conley of Fresno.
Judge Hall, on the other hand, holds
that a man cannot be deprived of the
right of going through insolvency, and he
has accordingly allowed numerous peti
tions of involuntary Insolvency to be
filed, to wit: Those In the matters of F
J. Marshall, F. B. Freeman, J. W. Macay,
George Wittmeier. Pete Butt, F. B. Pot
ter and others, all Insolvent debtors. Yet
the national act Is really in favor of the
debtors and does not allow a creditor to
force a debtor through insolvency with
in four months of its passage.
The. courts will resume business next
Monday, after the regular six weeks' va
cation, and it is quite likely that this
question win then be thoroughly discussed
and adjudicated.
Judge Hall appears to be In grave doubts
as to Judge Greene's tenets in the prem- !
ises, although he himself Is not absolutely I
satisfied that he is correct in his Inter- !
pretatlon of the national bankrupt act
I have permitted parties to file such
petitions in insolvency," said Judge Hill
to-day, when ,his attitude in the matter
was asked for, "but I have also boon
warning them that there Is some doubt
as to their rights In thus filing the papers
The matter has really never been anrued
here, only ex parte."
Considerable surprise Is of course ex
pressed that the youngest Superior Judge
should differ with Judge Greene, who haa !
the distinction of having dealt out law j
for the past twenty years or more
JAMES MeCLELLAND'S DEATH. I
The Summons Came After a Very
Brief Attack of Heart Fail
ure at Midnight.
OAKLAND. July 30.â James McClel
land, for a number of years prominent in
the employ of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and an active worker in Republi
can political circles, died suddenly at
his home, 1713 Eighth street, at
12:30 o'clock this morning. He had been
111 only one day, and death was due to
heart failure.
Deceased was a native of Philadelphia
Pa., aged 42 years, and leaves a widow
without children, and two slsterp, Mrs
F. L. Lewis and Mrs. Charles Maxwell of
Philadelphia.
Mr. McClelland came to California nine
years ago, and for several years there
after held a clerkship In me department
under Master Mechanic McKenzle of the
Southern Pacific Company, and his rapid
acquaintance soon brought him into prom
inence as a politician. He came from a
distinguished family. His father was the
well known Fleet Surgeon McClelland of
the United States navy under Admiral
Goldsborough.
The funeral will take place Monday aft
ernoon at 2 o'clock from his late resi
dence.
Mr. McClelland carried a large life

aged about 22 3 - ears. While Batana was
being taken to Niles he died on the train.
Coroner Baldwin was immediately noti
fied, and Deputy Coroner Briscoe at
Pleasanton took charge of the remains.
GRANTED A NEW TRIAL.
Ludwig Streuber Wins an Appeal to
the Supreme Court and Will
Be Tried Again.
OAKLAND, July 30.â Ludwig A. Streu
ber, who was sent to Folsom Prison from
here by Superior Judge Greene on con
viction of permitting his young wife to re
main in a house of doubtful character,
has been granted a new trial. The case
was appealed to the Supremo Court on
error of the Judge's instructions. Juige
Greene had instructed the jury in the
case that "it is not incumbent upon de
fendant to prove his innocence, nor 'a it
incumbent on him to explain suspi.Mnus
circumstances unless they tend in Home
degree to establish his guilt." The Su
preme Court holds that this instruction
did not contain a satisfactory statement
of the law. The judgment and order of
the lower court were reversed and the
cause has been remanded for a new trial.
Alameda County Schools.

young machinist, was arrested this even-
Ing at a West Oakland round house for
failure to provide for his child and his
bail was fixed at $50.

IT WAS THE
GOVERNOR'S
BUSY DAY
The Democratic High
Joints Grind Axes.
AGNEWS OFFICIALS SCORED
GIVEN A LECTTJRE BY THE
EXECUTIVE.
Inquiries Concerning the Recent
Shotgun Marriage Between
Miss Democracy and Mr.
Populist Paity.
The headquarters of Adjutant Gen
eral Barrett in the Palace Hotel bore
a distinctly political aspect during the
greater part of yesterday on account
of the presence of a number of Demo
cratic high jo: /its who were there to
wait upon Governor Budd. The busi
ness end of several Democratic news-
papers were also represented, the ob-
ject In view b>ing the securing of the
contract for the printing of several
proposed constitutional amendments
and the regular election proclamation.
Early in th~ day Trustee Hale and
. ; Medical Director Sponogle of Agnews
Insane Asylum paid the Governor a
formal call for the purpose of laying
before him a transcript of the evidence
taken, recently by the board of trustees
of the asylum in connection with the
charges made against Dr. Sponogle. It
â¢was expected that Truat.ee Gould would
. also be present, hut he failed to put in
an, appearance,-, much to the regret of
Hale and Sponogle, though the Gov
â  ernor displayed no visible evidences of
regret because of the non-arrival of
the'gentleman who Is credited with ap
plying the beautiful coat of whitewash
â¢ that How. covers the moral defects in
the administration of affairs at Ag
news. The transcript of evidence was
given to the Governor, and will be
presented by him to the Lunacy Com
mission for 1 consideration.
Both Dr. Sponogle and Trustee Hale
attempted to impress upon the mind
of the Governor the alleged fact that
the investigation conducted by the
board of trustees was fun and com
plete, and demonstrated beyond doubt
that the charges against the medical
director were without foundation. The
Governor dtÂ«cMn-xl to take this view of
the case and informed the gentlemen
that the Lunacy Commission Intended
to carry on an entirely independent in
vestigation, which he hoped would re-
BUlt in r be compteto exoneration of all
accused officials. If the contrary hap
pened to be the case action of a sum
mary kin^ might be expected.
Incidentally the Governor gave his
visitors some good political advica, and
from this point of view directed their
attention to some of the mistakes that
have been made in the administration
of affairs at the asylum. It may be that
he saw fit to go even deeper into the
matter, tor when the officials emerged
from the presence they presented the
appearance of two bad boys who had
just been mixed up with the sole of
the parental slipper. It may be that it
was th* anticipation of some such thing
that deterred Trustee Gould from par
ticipating in the interview. He is a
master hand at applying the rod, but
le naturally averse to exposing" him
self to any sort of castigatinn.
John F. Kidder the Debris Commis-
eioner, made a brief call on the Gov-
ernor during the forenoon. They held
a short executive cession on matters
political, after which AY. W. Foote,
Yosemite Commissioner and candidate
for United States Senator, was given
a chance to tell the Governor about the
merit, as an advertising medium, of the
newspaper owned by one of hia per
sonal friends and political henchmen.
State Library Trustee A. B. Lemmon of
Santa Rosa also dropped in to see what
was being done in the way of official ad
vertising, as veil as to make a few
timely suggestions concerning the lay
ing of pipes for the programmers at
the State convention. A. J. Clunie, In
surance Commissioner, called in for a
word with the chief executive, presum
ably on the subject of the apportion
ment of election printing. Clunie Is
Baid to be a candidate for the nomina
tion for Assessor, though this fact Is
not presumed to have any connection
with hip visit to the Governor.
Patrick Reddy and Peter Shields
dropped In to see the Governor during

TORE UP THE TRACKS OF THE GARS
Huntington's Antiquated One-Horse Vehicles Will Run on
Market Street No More.
Huntingdon's rickety, antiquated, one
horsn bobtail cars will run on Market
street no more. Early yesterday morning
Street Superintendent Ambrose, Â»vith a
force of nearly 200 men, carried out tho
programme as outlined in yesterday's Call
and tore up tho tracks over which the
horsu cars on Market street jolted along.
By dark the removed rails were stowed
in the corporation yard, and to-morrow
the rough cobbles That for ages have
served as a pavement along the line of
the removed tracks will be taken up, and
ir. their place a smooth bitumen roadway
will be laid as fast as the work can be ac
complished.
Mayor Phelan issued an order to thÂ«
Superintendent of Streets shortly before
midnight on Friday, directing him to re
move the objectionable rails on Market
street, and that official lost no time in
obeying the order. Couriers wera sent
out at once to assemble the force em
ployed by the Street Department, and by 9
o'clock yesterday morning nearly 200 men
armed with the necessary tools were
ready for duty.
No time was lost In commencing the
work of removing the rails. Tho men
were divided in gangs, each gang taking
a line oi rails, and a start was made at
the point where the tracks turn into San
some street from Market. Just une hour
and twenty -two minutes after thetirst rail
was removed the last one, at the corner
Of Sixth street, was lifted from the ties.
The work had been accomplished and no
resistance had been made by the railroad
company.
A copy of the Mayor's order to "the Su
perintendent of Streets, directing him to
tear up the rails, is as follows:
SAX FRANCISCO, July 29. IS9B.
Hon. 'William F. Ambrose, Superintendent of
Streetsâ Dear 31r: By resolution No. 1451,
fourth series, th? Market-street Railway Com
pany was required by the Hoard of Supervisor*
to remove the outside tracks 'of the street rail
way now operated by horse cars under th#ir
management on or before the 6th day of Au
ffust, IS9S. In a communication received from
the said company this day, and addressed to
the members of the Board of Supervisors, to
yourself and to me, it appears that the said
Market-street Railway Company "declines and
refuses to remove the said tracks, or any part
thereof, from said Market . street," thereby
waiving the ten days' notice given them in
which to act, and it now devolves upon you to
exeecute the orders of the Board of Supervis
ors. I therefore hereby direct you to proceed
and remove the tracks in accordance with the
resolution of the Board of Supervisors to-mor

Laughlin stepped in for a moment to
inquire about the legality of the recent
shotgun marriage between Miss Dem
ocracy and Mr. Populist Party. He was
informed that the bridegroom shows no
signs of a desire to deny the paternity
of the Little Giant baby and that there
is some talk of a divorce. The child
has been given fifteen days in which to
acknowledge its father.
There were many other callers at the
apartments of the executive during the
day, so many, in fact, that there was
no need for a "This is my busy day"

the Chinese language phonetically, gave
an exhibition of her success in teaching
the system before the school of the Chi

take down In shorthand what Is road to
her, and then by giving to the characters
their respective sounds reproduces exact

Mrs. Barrett has obtained the consent
of the Chinese Vice-Consul to teach the
system in the school of the consulate in

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., STTSDAY, JULY 31, 1898.
Accompanying the order was the fol
lowing letter giving reasons why imme
diate action should be taken:
SAN FRANCISCO. July 29. IS9B.
Hon. William F. Ambrose. Superintendent of
Streetsâ Dear Sir: Referring to my communi
cation of to-day, I desire to Inform you that,
pursuant to resolution 1431, the Board of Su
pervisors intends to invite proposals for the
work of paving that part of Market 6treet to
be vacated by the horse car tracks at its meet
ing- next Monday, August 1. when you â will
please have specifications ready as required by
said resolution. You will thus see the neces
sity of having the tracks removed to-morrow,
in order that the city may be in possession of
the. street when tho bids are invited. Yours
truly, JAMES D. PHELAN,
Mayor and ex-offlcio President of the Board of
Supervisors.
Mayor Phclan in support of his action
and of the order he gave to the Superin
tendent of Streets said:
"The ten days' notice given by the
Board of Supervisors to the railroad com
pany to take up Its tracks was a mere
courtesy and was not required by law.
The ten days' notice to pave between the
tracks and rails is required by law. When
the railroad yesterday notified us that
they declined and refused to remove the
tracks, of course they waived their notice
and in order to carry out the resolution of
the Board of Supervisors I directed the
Superintendent or Streets to remove the
tracks to-day. By this proceeding, the
city being in possession of the street, can
now Invite bids for the paving of it next
Monday as Intended. Otherwise, it would
mean long delay and raise legal questions
as to contemplated paving contract.
"As to the horse car tracks, I read be
tween the lines of the communication of
the railroad people that they have no au
thority to maintain the tracks under Sec
tion 499 of the Civil Code, and the Board
had no right to grant such a privilege on
Market street; and, secondly, that by rea
son of the fact that they have abandoned
portions of the horse car road, as on
Grant avenuo and other streets, they have
forfeited the whole franchise. .
"I sincerely trust, in the interest of the
city alone,, that the company will now
pave between its tracks and for two feet
outside of their outer rail without any
compulsion. I do not believe that there is
any Intention on the part of the Super
visors to insist upon the repaying of the
concrete cable road bed, nor do I believe
that they, should be justified in so doing.
It looks now as though wo would have a
smooth and noiÃeless pavement on Mar
ket street between Second and Sixth
streets."
The action of the Superintendent of
Streets was so unexpected by the street
car company that several of their cars
were caught along that part of the track
that was token up, and several of them
were left along tne street with no rails
to run over to reach the carhouse. At
one point along the line five cars were

IS UNGRATEFUL
Yankee Advertisements
Fill His Paper.
BITES THE HAND THAT FEEDS
ITS EDITORIAL COLUMNS TEEM
WITH ABUSE OF AMERICA.
Sample of the Fables With Which
Spanish Courage Is Stimu
lated and Patriotism
Kept Alive.
A flagrant case of Americana (giving aid
and comfort to a Spanish newspaper
which is upholding the cause of Spain in
the war with the United States has come
to light with the arrival of El Comercio
de San Franciscco, published in San Sal
vador, Central America. The paper was
formerly published In this city, but # Just
before the war broke out between the two
countries the editor moved lilb traps out
of the sty of "Yankee pigs," as his coun
trymen delight to call Americans, and
took up his abode in Central America,
The Issues of the paper to which atten
tion is called are those of May B and 22,
1898. They are filled with abuse of Amer
icans and of the United States, and yet
the columns contain advertisements from
well known business men in this city.
Among them are the California Wine As
sociation, corner of Second and Folsom
streets; Garcia & Mugglni, commission
merchants; W. W. Montague & Co., San
Francisco Bulletin, Cyrus Noble Bourbon
Whisky, Hotel Occidental, Guillermo B.
Hooper proprietor; Bacigolupi's Phono
graph Parlors; Union Pacific Railroad, by
D. W. Hitchcock, No. 1 Montgomery
street; Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
Hotel Langham and others.
In the issue of the paper in which these
advertisements appear are scurrilous ar
ticles, original and selected, from the
most violent of the newspapers of Madrid.
In the issue of the 22d is an article head
ed, "Donde esta un Espanol esta Eepana."
(Where there is a Spaniard, there is
Spain.) The following translation shows
the nature of the stuff which has been
dealt out by Spanish newspapers to that
small portion of the Spanish public that'
can read:
La Correspondencia Mllitar of Madrid relates
the following eplÃode in which the worthy
Slgnor Eulate, commander of the cruiser Vlz
caya, certainly bore an honorable part. "A
half-hour before the cruiser Vizcaya left the
port of New York more than 10,000 Yankees,
the greater number of whom were jingoes,
were waiting for the ship to weigh anchor with
bunched up on a stretch of track discon
nected from any part of {he company's
system. The cars were hauled and pushed
over the cobbles to the nearest tracks
that they could reach and sent to the
stables.
A car was left to run up and down on
Sansome street and another was detailed
to Jolt over the uneven rails on Sixth
street,. The conductors of the cars on
Sansomo and Sixth streets were Instructed
to issue transfers to the Market-street
cars, bo that connections could be made
between the two ends of the broken bob
tail line.
Tho threat of the railroad, company car
ried no fears to Mayor Phelan. "The
public interest demands tnat tho objec
tionable tracks bo removed," he said. "I
do not think that the threat of a suit of
damages against public officials should
deter them from doing their duty
and from acting In < a matter of
so much importance â  to the city.
It is well known that the Market-street
Railway Company will sustain no dam
ages from the removal of the tracks, as
it as been admitted by the officers of the
company that the removed line has for
years been operated at a loss."
Superintendent of Streets Ambrose said
he simply carried out the orders of the
Mayor in removing the tracks. "Tho
Market-street Railway Company," ho
said, "has no franchise to operate the
line, and it was perfectly proper for the
city to remove the rails from the street."
The Southern Pacific Company was sur
prised yesterday when the action of Su
perintendent of Streets Ambrose was
brought to its attention. They had not
looked for such premature action, think
ing that the city officials would not tear
up the rails until the expiration of the
time allotted them for tho removal of the
tracks. - â  â¢:
Nothing has as yet been * determined by
the railroad company to offset the action
of the city. - Mr. Herrin, attorney for the
Southern Pacific,' said s yesterday:. "Tno
city officials- have acted rather hastily in
this matter. I think 1 the Market-street
Railway Company has been very reason
able in the attitude which it assumed and
to which it adheres. They may tear up
the tracks but they cannot tear up the

OREGON HOUSE
A FIRE TRAP
Depraved and Vicious
Were Its Patrons.
ROOMS WERE ONLY BOXES
FIVE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN
FULLY IDENTIFIED.
Injured Survivors, With One Excep
tion, Are Out of Danger â Morbid
Crowd Visits the
Morgue.
In all probability the five unfortunates
who perished in the fire and smoke at the
Oregon lodging house night before last
never realized that death was upon them
when they groped blindly and sleepily
for an exit from the fire trap in which
they lodged. It was a ten-cent looping
house, patronized only by outcasts, the
moral and physical derelicts of Barbary
Coast and the water iront. Occasionally,
perhaps, an honest laborer, with but a
dime left, would seek shelter there for a
single night, but he would never return a
second time. For the past five years the
place has been known to the police as a
rendezvous for morphine and opium
fiends, vagrants and drunkards of both
sexes, and when the fire broke out nearly
all were in a drunken stupor or dazed by
drugs. One of the survivors, whose In
juries may yet prove fatal. Illustrates
this. He says he heard a racket for sev
eral minutes before he got out of his bunk,
but thought nothing of it. Then he heard
the crackling of the ilames and noticed
tue odor of smoke, and thinking some
thing was wrong got up and went to the
window. He saw the tire pouring out of
the open hall uoor and started to go
downstairs. Opening his door he was en
gulfed in flames, but he ran through to the
rear end of the hall on to the porch ard
jumped into the back yard. He managed
to drag himself out of there and was pent
to the Harbor Hospital.
The building wus a veritable death trap,
with only a narrow stair leading to the
street. The two upper floors, about ?5x50
feet, liad been partitioned off into boxt
which were called rooms. There wero
fourteen of these on each floor, and ;Le
dilapidated beds, the only furniture In
them, occupied all the space. Lodgers
were evidently expected to bring their
own bedding or sleep in their wearing ap
parel. The ground floor was occupied
by Chinese fruit and vegetable peddlers
as a storeuom and sleeping apartment.
It Is supposed a lamp exploded down
stairs, and the dry wood was soon aflame.
In another instant the flre reached the
Stairway and shot upward, shutting off
the only exit from the lodging house.
The damage to the building Is not very
great, the lire having been confined to the
hallways. The doors t the sleeping
ri ioins were burned and t..e inmates were
suffocated while they slept or burned to
death in endeavoring to get down the
stulrs.
Charles Holmes, the crippled newspaper
vendor, was found on the floor in his
room. He lay partially under the bed.
In the debris yesterday near the door hta
two crouches were found. Both wero
broken, indicating that he had made fran
tic efforts to escape a fiery death.
Joseph Cuneo. who owns a number of
such buildings as the one burned and haa
grven the fire department endless trouble
by constantly violating the rtre ordinances.
Is the owner of the shack. He bought It
several years ago aj.il immediately con
verted it into a cheap lodging house, Cu
neo has already made preparations to re
new the partitions in tho house. Tt was
built about forty years ago and at one
time was a popular boarding: house under
the management of John Hogan. Hogan
sold out and went into the insurance bus
iness. Cuneo had no insurance on the
property, probably because no company
would write a policy on it.
Edward M. Kennedy, one of the injured
who was taken to tho Harbor Receiving-
Hospital, has only one leg. He was asleep
on the top floor when aroused by the cry
of "Fire." He opened his door and dashed
toward the stairs without waiting to get
his wooden peg which he usually wore.
In going down the stairs he fell headlong
into the flames, but he managed to hobble
to thn rear porch and let himself down a
ladder into the back yard, where he was
found by the firemen. He had no cloth
ing and was carried out to the street and
covered with an old quilt until the am
bulance came and took him to the hos
pital. Kennedy Is very badly burned about
the body and his injuries may prove fatal.
He and John King, whose burns are also

very severe, were taken to the City and
County Hospital yesterday afternoon.
Mrs. Sflva, Chris Christiansen and Pat
rick Donohue. who were taken to the hos
pital from the fire, were able to go to
the homes of relatives and friends. None
of the three lntter are seriously injured.
All day yesterday there was a stream of
people climbing the stairs to the Coro
ner's office on Merchant street. Some
were prompted by morbid curiosity, oth
ers were friends of the dead, but all came
with the one requestâ they wished to en
ter the gloomy portals of the dead house
a few doors below, where lay five charred
and blackened bodies in the plain coffins
which have been used to convey hun
dreds of bodies of unfortunate dead. Few
were allowed to enter. The bodies had
already been identified, and there was no
need of exposing them to the eagor and
curious throng. In a few days they will
be buried, and those who were their
friends will have the opportunity of tak
ing thp last look at them before the earth
closes over them foreverâ not as they are
now blackened, distorted, disfigured, but
neatly cleaned and prepared for a decent
burial
Late in the afternoon came two who
stood apart from the rest. They gave
no names, but their names would be
known only to the few who frequent
what Is known as "the coast," but
they deserve a high place in the roll
of honor. Both were poorly dressed and
gave evidence of being women to whom
dollars are precious. They had been
friends of Kate Connoly in life, and came
to proffer their services and what money
they could raise toward giving her a
burial. . . Â.
"I have been around seeing my friends,"
said one of them, "and have raised a lit
tle money to pay for the funeral. All
have given a dollar. None refused or
grumbled. I have very little money my
self, but I will manage to spare $5. I
knew Kate, and now that she's gone I'll
do my best for her."

THERE is a look of settled melan
choly on the Queen's face. She
baa the air of one wearied of her
I :,. disheartened at the abso
"; lute failure which has attended
her hei oio efforts. There is noth
ing royal about her surroundings, yet
' something of the dignity of majesty
â¢ ren?: r. Seated In an ordinary
hotel parlor, -without throne or crown
or any other royal appurtenance, she
still looks a Queen.' The place is fur
nished in the usual way, even the fold
ing bed m the corner, striving with un
blushing mendacity to look like a ward
robe, has not been spared. Liluokalanl
is attended by no suite; she was alone
when I entered.
Colonel Macfarlane, the Queen's busl
. ness man (I was almost going to say
buiness manaeer), would make an ad
mirable courtier. He has the suave,
polite manner, the polished, easy ad
dress of. your man of the world, ac
customed to move In high social circles.
"Your Majesty," says the colonel,
bowing low, his highly polished silk hat
In his hand. Though a Queen without
a kingdom, Lilu.okalani'3 title is pre-
Corvad *â¢ !Â»Â«<â¢Â» - "JTore'-ls- a, gwntJ^Tnan
who wishes to talk of your native
land."
It was a neat way of recqmmendlng
me to the Queen's good graces. No
subject could be dearer to her heart
than her land, and people, the beautiful
Isles of which she has been despoiled,
her subjects over â¢whom she may no
longer rule.
A smile of welcome lightens up the
â weary face as the Queen holds out hÂ»r
ha-nd with stately grace. Though her
features are distinctly Polynesian,
though she has the broad lips and the
Bnub nose of her race, LiluokcJani is
not at all C-.rk in color. Just a faint
tinge of brown not more than many a
Mexican has. Her English is perfect,
though she speaks slowly, with the
Blightest possible foreign intonation.
"Yes, my people," she sighs. "It is
long since I have been with
them. The two years which I have
spent In Washington seem like an age
to me. It has been such hard work,
too, and the climate has tried me very
much. I have no complaint to make
about your Washington officials. They
treated me most kindly. They gave
me the place of honor at the inaugura
tion ceremonies, and every one re
ceived me In a friendly spirit. But all
my work has gone for nothing.
"I was just on the point of success.
The annexation scheme, I am sure, was
defeated, when the war came. The
Whole situation changed at once. The
military spirit of the peuple swept
away all considerations of right and
justice, and I could do nothing. That
is why I am going home to my people
to explain why I failed; to show them
that I hove done all I could for their
liberty; to tell them how their Inde
pendence was lost; to advise them to
submit patiently to fate."
"Then your Majesty will not com -
mand your subjects to oppose the
America ri rule?"
"I have no longer the right to com

they are my people. But lam con

take steps of their own accord, I shall
do nothing. If they hold a great mass
meeting, as Is the native custom, and
call upon me by an overwhelming vote
to oppose annexation, I will, of
course, help them all In my power."
"Where does your Majesty propose to

*I shall, of course, travel about the
Islands a good der.l and visit my people
and care for their welfare. But when

"Before this war broke out I had every hope that I would come
into my own again. If annexation had been defeated the
movement for the restoration of the monarchy would have
gained strength enough to sweep the republic away. My
people never voted for tee republic, but at least 75 per
ctnt of them would have voted for my return to the throne. Every

gain the crown lands which were taken
from you by the republic?"
Now the financial question is a deli
cate one to touch on with the Queen,
and I felt some hesitation in putting
such a query. It Is well known that
the royal estates, which brought in a
revenue of some $100,000 annually, were
confiscated by the republic, and not
one penny of compensation has ever
been paid to the Queen.
"I do not know," 'she replied. "I can
not tell what will be done with the
property of which I was so unjustly
deprived. But I am pure that a great
and honorable nation like the United
States will not treat me with injus
tice."
"Her Majesty." put In Colonel Mac
fariane, as one better competent to doal
with figures, "has relied entirely on her
own resources since the revolution.
Many kind friends have offered hell),
but she has refused all financial aid.
Her expenses at Washington have, of
course, been very heavy, and she hÂ£Â§
had to mortgage her private property
to obtain funds. I am sure the Ameri
can nation would never allow the
Queen, whom they have deprived of
her country, to sink into poverty. You
know when a proposal for annexation
was made under the Harrison admin
istration it was intended to offer the
Queen ample compensation for the loss
of her crown. Now that annexation is
an actual fact some proposal of a simi
lar nature will be made."
"Before this war broke out," said the
Queen. "I had every hope that I would
come into my own again. If annexa
tion had been defeated the movement
for the restoration of the monarchy
would have gained strength enough to
Bweep the republic away. My people
never voted for the republic, but at

proudly. "We belonged to the family

different thing from annexing a col

If the nation is to be absorbed by the
Unite? States, then it should be ad
mitted to the Union, and the Hawai

and privileges as are accorded to any
other portion of the race.
"Then, again, some special provision
must be made for the introduction of
Asiatic labor, or else all the sugar
plantations will be ruined. It will
never do to stop the coolies coming
there altogether."
"But are not there enough men now
on the islands to work the planta
tions?"
"Yea, there are enough coolies now,
but if more were not .allowed to come
you can see that the supply would soon
run out, ami there would be a great

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JULY 31, 1898.
"I have no longer the right to command my people to opposo
American rule. They are not my subjects now; they are my peopls.
Hut I am confident their love and respect for me are as deep as ever.
They will do what I tell them. I know that any active opposition to
annexation would be futile, and I should be sorry to lead my people

do nothing. If they hold a great mass meeting, as is the native cus
tom, and call upon me by an overwhelming vote to oppose annexa

LIKE Queen Victoria, Hawaii's
Queen is an author as well as
a monarch. She has given us,
from her own pen, in clear, in
telligible .English, an account of
her life, hiding none of the se
crets of royalty and telling us exactly
what it feels like to be a queen. Her
intense love for her beautiful 'country
and intelligent people shines forth
from every page of this volume. She
tells of her happy childhood, her still
happier marriage, her brief but event
ful reign, and last and saddest of all,
of her dethronement and separation
from the people she loved so well. Of
her childhood she writes:
"I knew no other father or mother
than my foster parents, no other sister
than Bernice. I used to climb up on
the knees of Paki. put my arms around
his neck, kiss him and he caressed me
as a father would his child; while, on
the contrary, when I met my own par
ents, it was with perhaps more of inter
est, yet always with the demeanor I
would have shown to any strangers
who noticed me. My own father and
mother had other children, ten In all,
the most of them being adopted into
other chiefs' families; and although I
knew that these were my own brothers
and sisters, yet we met throughout my
younger life as though we had not
known our common parentage. This
was, and indeed is, in accordance with
Hawaiian customs. It is not easy to
explain its origin to those alien to our
national life, but it seems perfectly
natural to us. As intelligible a rea
son as can be given is that this alli
ance by adoption cemented the ties of
friendship between the chiefs. It
spread to the common people, and it
has doubtless fostered a community of
interest and harmony."
The school days of the Queen were
chiefly remarkable for the development
of her great natural gift for music. All
Hawaiians are musical, but the Queen
was the first of her
race to master the
difficulties of tech
nique, and to re
duce her native
songs to written
music. "I have
never yet," she
writes, "numbered
my compositions,
but am sure they
must run well up
into the hundreds.
Of these not more
than a quarter
have been printed,
but the most popu
lar have been in
such demand that
several editions
have been exhaust
ed. Hours, of which
it is not yet in
place to speak,
which I might have
found long and
lonely, passed
quickly and cheer
fully by, occupied
and soothed by tho
expression of my
thoughts in music;
and even when I
was denied the aid
of my instiunient
I could transcribe
to paper the tones
Of my voice." More
than this the
Queen, in her girl

ideal retreat was the fact that it con
tained a mother-in-law, whose conduct
severely tried the young bride. Lili

band otherwise than with the deepest
affection and respect. He lived long
enough to assume the title of Prince
Consort, dying only seven months af
ter the Queen's accession to the throne
in 1891.
Llliuokalani became heir apparent to
the throne in 1877, and received the
official title she now bears.
Ever since that date she took a prom
inent part in Hawaiian affairs, acting
during one year as Regent, while her
brother, the King, made a tour round
the world. She traveled also herself,
visiting the United States and Eng
land, and assisting at the jubilee cele
bration of Victoria's reign. Her jour
neys broadened her mind and bright
ened her natural intelligence, enabling
her to take a liberal view of her du
ties as future Queen, and to do much
to promote the welfare of her people. .
But it availed not; her affection for
her subjects could not save her throne
in t: a day of trial, and it is a signi
ficant fact that for the doings of that
day Llliuokalani blames, not her own.

bodied in the self-seeking, rapacious,
American missionary. On page after
page she alludes to the pernicious po
litical influence of men who, having
come to spread the gospel of Jesus, had
stayed to enroll in the ranks of Mam
mon. More especially she denounces
the notorious adversary of Father Da
mien, Dr. Hyde, to whose prejudiced
fhfiuence over Mr. Albert Willis, the
United States emissary, she directly at
tributes her own downfall. But not
the missionaries alone came under Lili-
uokalani's sorrowful censure, and, in
deed, seeing the treatment she received
at the hands of some representative
Americans, it is marvelous that she
should have preserved a warm senti
ment for the American nation.
Yet, withal, uncounseled and un
crowned, she never lost her dignified
self-possession, never put her own in
terests before those Of her peo
ple. And, when at last, after her ab
dication, she was brought to trial by
her captors, charged with a series of
imaginary offenses, her defense has a
queenly ring about it.

WHY IS MARRIAGE ON THE DECREASE?
Discussed by JESSIE fICKERMAN, RABBI NIETO, F- R- DONFORTH. JOHN HEMPHILL. D.D., THEODORE HITTELL. J. H- STfiLLfIRD, M.D., CHARLOTTE BLAKE-BROWN, M.D., J. RICHARD FREUD.
STATISTICS show us the fact, looked upon as
alarming by some of our sociologists, that the
marriage rate is decreasing among us.
This is noticeably the case in Massachusetts,
New York. Illinois and Kansas, where marriages
are occurring, in proportion to the number of
adult inhabitants, so much less frequently than they
did in former days as to arouse an interrogative in
: not only in those States themselves but in the
nation at large.
Even here in San Francisco the decrease in the
marriage rate during the past six years has been very
marked, The last census gave us a population of a
little less than 280,000; last year we were. credited by
authorities with an Increase since then of at
least 70.000. And yet the number of marriage licenses
which were issued here lasi .'.car was 624 less than
the number which was issued during the year ending
July. 1892.
The actual figures of the Fan Francisco license ac
count for the years mentioned are as follows: 1891-2,
L892-S, 1411; 1893-4, 3200; 1884-6, 3218; 1595-6, 3164;
1896-7. 3125; 1897-8, 20T4. The rate of decrease for the
a mentioned is even greater and the reason for
this decline Is iÂ» Ing seriously discussed. Some of our
San Francisco students of social conditions here ex
press their Views on the subject.
In other days the woman was lost in the wife and
mother, the individual was absorbed in the idea of
her "sphere," which was

ss which crystal ized into a desire to become an
"Individual"â to individualize herself. In her effort to
jgain this end she unconsciously opened new doors of
learning and avenues of industry which have led to
an independence that truly has thrown a spell over
the young woman of to-day, filling her with ambition
along new lines.
The desire to sustain this freedom of independence
has brought her into business competition with man
and in the race it may be fairly stated that she cornea

competent of self-support; in other words "woman has
31 v -led herself."
In the final analysis of the question "why mar
riage is on this decrease," it may briefly be summed up
by saying that. woman has become an individual. She

The effect of this state of affair* upon the home
life of tbis nation forma ample scope for meditation,
â¢and .'i !/;i inst it. for the -present, will stand a good-sized
question mark.
I feel convinced that the present conditions are
due to the false system of education tvhich has pre-
vailed for so many years.*
We have devoted our
selves to cultivating and
educating the intellectual
j h. stallard; m. d.
powers to the utter neglect of industrial training.
Even here in California this has been the case, and the
consequence of it is that both sexes have been taught
to live rather by their wits than by honest we:k. In
consequence thousandsfare just selfishly existing in
our overcrowded professions and in clerical posi
tions, who might marry and live well and happily had
they been taught to avail themselves of the various
industrial opportunities in our land.
It is universally acknowledged that the ratio of
marriage to the population in any civilized community
affords one of the best indications of social prosper
ity or its reverse. A decrease in the number of mar
riages is only one of the many evidences of the fail
ure of merely intellectual training to secure pros
perity. Another evidence is the great increase of
crime, which Is so marked as to call for especial notice.
Industry is the inseparable basis of honesty, and
industry, having long been relegated to a. secondary
place In the estimation of our people, the consequence
is that public dishonesty has increased to alarming
proportions.
The most hopeful feature of the present state of
things is the comparatively recent introduction of in
dustrial education in our schools and universities.
National prosperity depends primarily upon such a
movement, and its natural consequence â honesty.
Another great, but so far unrecognized, principle is
back of this. Personal freedom depends upon the op
portunity to secure a livelihood without the aid of any
other person, and that opportunity is only afforded by
the gifts of nature which belong to every one by right,
at least to the extent of a bare subsistence. Upon
that riKht to' subsistence freedom depends alone.
The natural condition of things is that every man
should marry and have one wife. When a man can
be sure of supporting a wife, or when there is indus
trial sympathy between them so that they can work
together for each other, prosperity ajid the marriage
rate will increase together.

So far as America is concerned if the marriage
rate is becoming less in proportion to the population
than it has been heretofore, I think that the fact may
be justly attributed to the laxity of the divorce laws.
Men do not feel to-day justified in taking upon
themselves responsibilities when the other partner to
the contract may shake them off for little or no rea
son. F'> many cases have come to public notice lately
of women who found that they were "not in sym
pathy" with their husbands, when after five years or
more of married life those husbands have met with
serious financial reverses, that the generality of young
men have been led to reflect seriously on this subject.

sponsibility carelessly and
thoughtlessly, without carefully and circumspectly
weighing all the probabilities and possibilities con
nected therewith, makes a grave mistake, which will
entail grievous trouble, and in many cases actual suf
lering upon many innocent persons in the generations
yet to come.
The prevailing "hard times" of the past few years
have undoubtedly had a seriously deterrent effect up
on many who wouldâ were prosperity the ruleâ have
entered the married state. No man likes to ask the
woman he loves to share a precarious existence or act
ual poverty with him. He does not feel that it would
be just to her or pleasing to himself to place her in
surroundings which have in them no element of present
comfort or prospect of future prosperity. Therefore it
is that statistics show that marriages are governed â
however much the sentimentalist may desire to think
the contraryâ entity by the conditions of the coun-
try. In "good times" the rate of marriage increases;
in "bad times"_jt decreases. A study of matrimonial
statistics will show the rise and fall of the tide of
prosperity in any district not affected by outside in
fluences, and conversely a study of business condi
tions will approximately tell the tale of the new
households formed there.
I do not consider that the more general employment
of women has anything to do with the matter. If a
girl has sufficient domestic instinct â or rather suffi
cient love of domesticity â to , make her a good wife
and mother, business life will not take the place of
home life in her heart. I believe in giving all, male
or female, the opportunity to, if possible, make their
ambitions realities â at any rate to exercise their abil
ities and carve out their lives as best they can. A
girl who, because of restrictions, limitations and lack
of opportunities to live her own life her own way,
"marries for a home," will not be apt to make that
home what it ought to be. When s!-e marries because
she of her own free will and accord chooses to take
the step, her home will be her pride and glory, and a
center from which good will radiate to the outside
world.
It is difficult to assign any one reason for that gen
eral decrease in the number of marriages during the

principal one in my opinion, la to be found in the in

thousands of men who, under the conditions which
prevailed a decade or so ago, would be able and glad
to take upon themselves the responsibilities of matri
mony are now either unemployed or are working for
salaries inadequate to support more than one person.
It is not the mere fact that women have become
workers that makes the trouble; it is the feet that in
almost every case when a woman supplants a man
'in a business position she does so for a salary much
lower than that which her male predecessor received.
This point is usually made in the application for em
ployment â the woman will do the work required quite
as well, and far cheaper, and as a simple business
proposition the firm to which she applies usually gives
her the place. The consequence of this is that the
rate of wages for all situations i hich it is possible for
women to fill has become so lowered that even those
men who are still retained as clerks, bookkeepers,
stenographers, etc., are unable to earn more than their
own livings.
If only those women and -iris who really need em
ployment would seek and secure it the situation would
be much better. When a woman does as good work
as a man she ought to receive as good wages, and she
should demand them. The main trouble is, though,
that thousands of girls with good homes prefer busi
ness life to helping their mothers about the house; so
a Bervant is hired to take the daughter's place, or the
mother works alone, and the girl works for less than
living wages, for the reason that her living is assured
and her salary is devoted merely to non-essentials.
Having assisted in reducing the salary of the aver
age young man, the average young working woman
does not look favorably upon him as a suitor, even if
he forgets his financial circumstances sufficiently to
wish to marry. She feels that she is far better off in
a. store or office with light duties, regular hours, and
money of her own, than she would be as the over
worked wife of a poor man with whom nearly all her
sisters are in competition. Probably she is right, but
her decision is based on conditions which she herself
has helped to change â whether for better or worse is
an open question.
Â« -â¦ â¢
One great reason for the decrease in the number
of marriages is the complexity of modern life, for
which I cannot in justice
say that the men are
really to blame.
A man receiving a
moderate salary, or be
ginning business in a modest way, is attracted by a
girl and really wishes to marry her, but the -reflection
Xi h G Â£ an . not arford t0 maintain her in the style to
w men sne is accustomed prevents him from asking
her to share his lot. A man who sees the girl of his
choice always elegantly attired, living in a fine hou<=e
and petted and indulged and waited upon as loved
daughters of well-to-do families always are naturally
hesitates about asking her to begin far lower down on
the ladder of worldly prosperity with him.
Did he but know it in very many cases the girl
would be glad to bear her share of life's burdens and
in a happy little home of her own would regret none

of her girlhood's luxuries. The love of a manly man
will make any worthy girl willing t<> help him carve
out his fortune; but as girls cannot even hint con
cerning their feelings in this regard many a happy
marriage Is prevented by this misapprehension.
It is a very common error among men- particularly
young menâ to think that because some women are
selfish, worldly and mercenary such traits are charac
teristic of the sex. As a rule a woman is far more
ready to give up luxuries and even comforts for the
sake of one she loves than is her brother.
If a young man would decide to give up his cigars
and his club and the numerous other little self-indul
gences which decrease his income so that he does not
feel that he can afford to marry, he would find him
self better off in many ways.
Let a young man do this and then look about him
for a good, sensible girl who is willing (and man>
more of them than society is aware of really are) tÂ»
eet up an establishment on a small scale and hplp
him make his way in the world as her mother helped
her father, and a happy marriage will be the result.
There i 3 too much of selfishness and pretens*;
among us; when we are more self-sacrificing and
more honest with each other, we shall all be happier.
At pj-esent "muy rico," as the Spaniards s&y, seems
the desideratum in too many of the marriages which
take place.
In this emphatically commercial agÂ£ it impresses
me that the question of marriage has unfortunately
become also a commercial

Competition in nearly all the walks of life has be
come so keen that a majority of our young men can
not see their way clear to maintain a home complete
and elegant enough in its appointments to agree with
their accustomed ideas.
In the life of the workman, especially those en
gaged in factories or those who perform the ordinary
unskilled labor of our farming communities, a still
more serious competition must be taken into consid
eration. The advent to our shores of alien peopli *,
whose plane of civilization is so low that the absolute
necessities of existence are all that they require to
sustain them in contentment makes the lot of our
poorer classes even harder to bear than it would

civilization. He not only found this an
cient city, but unearthed hieroglyphics

in studying the traces of the prehis

he has been constantly making re

Mr. Seville left on his latest and most
successful trip on October last. It was
his purpose to decipher certain picture
writings which cover the temple of
Mnntfzuma's far-famed sun god, then
considered the most important ancient
.American structure extant. Quetzal
coatl, the sun god, was the principal
diety of the Aztecs, and by some lucky
chance his temple escaped the destruc
tive hands of fortez find the other
Spanish invaders.
The young explorer has just returned
to New York, and the secrets which he
has unearthed and which he now for
the first time announces to the world,
prove to be far more important than
any that were in the keeping of the
sun god.
Mr. Saville's work was prosecuted
under the auspices of the Mexican Gov
ernment, and he was accompanied by
Mr. Humphreys, a surveyor who acted
as an official Mexican representative.
They took along with them a consider
able force of Mexican laborers to do the
work of excavation, and carried a type
writer, cximera and other implements
of modern civilisation with which to
prosecute their work.
While on the way to hfs Intended field
of labor, Mr. Raville found traces of a
great group of pyramids near Xoxo.
This region has lung been recognized
as a fruitful field for the discovery of
Zepotecan relios. Thinking that a little
exploration might uncover something
of value, Mr. Saville set his native la
borers at work and in a short time had
unearthed a number of pyramids and
smaller mounds. The twelve largest of
these pyramids are of the sort called
teocalli, an Aztec word meaning divine
tombs. The ground throughout this re
gion was thickly overgrown with gua
miichi wnd mesquite. The roots from
these trees penetrated to a great depth,
and in several instances they had
brokon through the stone floors or the
mounds. Specimens of ancient pottery
and other relics were found which had
been broken up by the same resistless
forces.
One day while Mr. Saville was recon
noiterlng some distance to the north of
the big group of pyramids he came to

ticed peculiar bits of pottery and traces
of ashes. On examining the pieces of
broken pottery he knew at once from
their peculiar formation that they had
lain there undisturbed for centuries,
sheltered from wind and storm by the
impenetrable thicket through which
not even the heavy tropical rains could
force their way.
Hoping that he was on the scent of
valuable relics, the explorer applied
himself to pick and spade, and with
great difficulty dug two or thrse feet
into the earth, where he came to a
hard. Hat surface. In considerable ex
citement he called his laborers, who
quickly cleared away the brush and
dirt. The surface was found to be a
cement floor, or perhaps it would be
more accurate to say a cement roof.
Cutting through it the workers came
to the face of a stone wall. Sealed to
this wall by their rims were cazuelas
("earthenware bowls). Under each bowl
was a bright red funeral idol which
had been so thoroughly preserved by
the perfectly dry air that it looked as
though it had i>een newly painted.
What had at first appeared to be a
stone wall was now seen to be a long
slab, forming a lintel over the top of a
door. After further digging the door
way was uncovered and was found to
be blocked by a huge metate (native
millstone.) Its corners had been filled
In with smaller stones and the whole
mass cemented over, so that the tomb
was hermetically pealed against damp
ness and other corrosive agents.
The lintel of this doorway was a
huge stone block of volcanic origin,
about six feet long and eighteen inches
wide. Carved -cross its entire surface
were inscriptions in the hieroglyphics
of a civilized race! No writing- of such
an advanced character as that of these
hieroglyphics l.as ever before been dis

casts in plaster and papfer-mache im
pressions of this wonderful monolith,
and finally of the whole doorway. The
inscriptions slow in excellent relief,
and Mr. Saville is now engaged in an
exhaustive study of them from the
casts. He intends to recast duplicates
of the originals and send them to the
ablest hieroglyphists and students of
ancient records the world over, in or

skill may be brought to bear for their
deciphering.

tudes of prayer were on the walls.
Three niches in the tomb contained a
number of skulls and other bones com
prising parts of ten skeletons were
scattered about. These were all paint
ed a bright red, the same shade as that
which covered the bones found outside
the chambers und^r the cazuelas. Red,
Mr. Saville says, was the mourning
color of the Aztecs. The fact that all
the bones were painted shows that
they had been entirely stripped of flesh
before being placed in the tomb. Dur
ing the long generations whicn had
elapsed since the sx-pulcher had been
staled over an inch of fine dust had
sifted down from the decayed rocks
which formed the roof and walls.
The m<.-st valuable part of the find in
this ancient tomb, in the opinion of Mr.
Saville, was the inscriptions. Although
some of them bear a generic resem
blance to the Maya writing which has
been found in other parts of Mexico
no written characters of so high an
order have ever before been discovered
in America. It is Mr. Saville's beliel'
that the writing is at least partly phon
etic. If this proves to be the case, it
will lift the Zepotecas to a position in
history far above that of the cele
brated Aztecs or the opulent Incas of
Peru.
The next step in Mr. Savllle's ex
plorations was the great crypt of Xoxo.
It was discovered by Dr. Sc-logruren, the
famous Mexican archaelogist and col
lector of relics, in 1886. Mr. Saville
forced his way into it by a small
door which had been previously un
known. To reach the interior, four
floors, each from two to three inches
thick, made of a very hard, white
cement, were cut through. Peculiar
architectural formations of an impor
tant ceremonial significance were
found in the interior of the crypt. It
seems likely from the religious and
ceremonial symbols uncovered here
that the origin of the Zapotecan re
ligion may be found to be identical
with that of the most ancient faith of
the eastern world.
The great discovery, and the one
which scientific men consider the most
important yet made, was hit upon In
the course of excavations among the
mounds already mentioned. A terra
cotta drainpipe was found leading from
one of these mounds into the fields. The
joints of the pipe were several feet
long, and they were -so made as to fit
carefully together. The course of the
pipe was folLowed for a considerable
distance. Then it broke off, but fur
ther along it was found again, and fol
lowing it up a steep mountain, the ex
plorer came to a huge temple at the
top, surrounded by an imposing peris
tyle. It had been a work of the great
est difficulty to follow the long course
of the buried pipe, but probably by no
other means could the ancient city have
been discovered, hidden as it was by
thick growths on all sides.
The sides of the mountain, on the
summit of which stood the city, had
EXPLORER SAVILLE EXAMINING THE BONES OF A HUMAN BEING FOUND IN A HOUSE IN
THE BURIED CITY.
been artificially terraced, the top had
been razed and fortified on all sides
till it was impregnable.
The temple Itself was a magnificent
piece of architecture. Beyond it on the
broad area of the mountain top were
the- crumbling ruins or amphiteaters,
palaces and other public buildings.
Streets and passageways were exactly
as they had been during the long cen
turies since their desertion. Here on
this terraced mountain, overlooking a
great stretch of country at its foot, was
at last found the lost capital of the
Zepotecan nation, at one time, probably
the rulers over most of the other peo
ple of the continent, certainly their
leaders in art, civilization and industry.
The mountain on which the skeleton of
this prehistoric metropolis was brought
to view is marked on the Mexican Gov
ernment maps as Monte Alban. Its
crowning wall is completely hidden by
the surrounding growth of lofty trees
and it is so difficult of access that it has
never been attacked or even seriously
thought of as a field of exploration.
That there were ruins upon this sum
mit was known before Mr. Saville's
visit, but they were supposed to be
only the remains of some rude Indian
fortress instead, aa has been proved,
the wreck of a stately and civilized
city.
"Zachila was, in all probability, the
ancient name of the city on Monte Al
ban," says Mr. Saville. "Not very far
away there exists a little village which
now bears the same name. The spot
was strategically an ideal place for a
great capital city in the troublous times
when it must have existed. Its situa
tion made it an impregnable fortress.
The mountain stands at the intersec
tion of the three broad valleys, Oaxaca,
Etla and Jalplan. Thus it commanded
a wide view in all directions, and, be
ing isolated by these valleys from the
surrounding mountains and looming
high above them all, it kept perpetual
guard over all the country round
about
"Of course my work did not extend
over a sufficient length of time to de
termine the exact extent of the cul
ture, wealth and civilization of the peo
ple who once inhabited the city, but
they must have been far in advance of
most of those with whom we have be
come in a degree acquainted through
other mounds and ruins. The city was
certainly one of considerable size, ex
tending over several square miles. We
came upon stone aqueducts over six
feet wide. In the different parts of the
plain are big mounds which, on inves
tigation, proved to be the crumbled re
mains of what were once great public
buildings. The frequent earthquakes of
that region, which probably caused the
destruction of the city, have shaken
these once important structures into
mere heaps of dust and debris.
"In the southern end of the city we
found a big mound over a thousand
feet long and three hundred feet in
width. The slopes of its sides were
regular and faced with masonry and
there was a stairway leasing to its
summit. It may have been the sits >>f
a vast temple or of a series of public
buildings. At the opposite end of the
city there was a rectangular basin of
about the same size which once formed
a great amphitheater where public
gatherings were held and religioun
ceremonies performed.
"No reliable proofs are left of what
a Zapotecan dwelling was like. Ex
cavations of temples, causeways, pii
lars, arches and other magnificent pub
lic structures and a searching stud/
of the plans and general appearance of
the city have furnished the mo3t con
vincing data for the scientific meaning
with which the explorations have
clothed the masses of hitherto mean
ingless stone and dust. Everywhere
there was found proof that the Zapote
cans were a peace-loving people who
must have been governed by an elab
orate code of laws and customs. They
had a literature, too, for we found
proofs and traces of it, though, of
course, there was no time to go ex
tensively into that phase of the ex
plorations. Their religion must have
developed to an advanced stage, for we â 
found proof that they did not offer up
live sacrifices in their religious fetes.
Doubtless further work will bring to
light other important and interesting
facts about the lives and customs of
these pe^ pie whom we may Justly look
upon as our earliest predecessors on
this continent. Just how extensive
these discoveries may prove to be it is
impossible to sw at the present time.
"Ever since the attention of anthro
pologists, has been called to this hemis
THIS DOG HAS FALSE TEETH.
LONDON claims to have the only
dog with false teeth in the world.
This canine curiosity is in the
possession of Mr. E. Mosely, one
Bf the best known dentists in the
West End.
Myn Duivel, as the dog is named, is
proud of his masticators and defies
criticism by vigorously devouring
whatever is placed before him. He
does not even hesitate at chops, grind
ing their bones to powder with wonder
ful ease.
"I bought the dog abroad," Mr. Mose
ly remarks in Tid-Bits, "for a stud
dog, as, although old, he possesses
many good points. He had no teeth,
however, and I found that we had to
specially prepare food for him. Ha
became very unfortunate in the ken
nels, where the dogs would worry
him. without his being able to defend
himself, and treat him with the utmost
contempt. So the idea occurred to me
that I might make him a set of false
teeth. It had never been done before
to my knowledge, and there were great
difficulties in the way, but I saw no
reason why it should not be done.
"So I chloroformed Myn Duivel and
removed the few stumps he had left.
The puzzle, after the mouth was pre
pared, was how to fit the plate. Every
thing had to be specially made, but at
last I succeeded in taking models of
the dog's mouth, and the most difficult
part of the operation was over, or so,
at least, I congratulated myself. From
the models metal dies were cast, and
natty little platinum plates struck to
fit each jaw. These plates had to be
of double thickness in order to obtain
sufficient strength, as Myn Duivel, hav
ing no fear of his dentist's bill-, is reck
less in the way he tackles bones.
"It was a formidable task â the most
difficult operation I have performed in
a professional career of nearly twenty
years. Each of the teeth occupied two
hours in preparing, and as there were
twenty-four of them you will under
stand what a dreary task it was. For
ty-eight hours of grinding! And then
each tooth had to be ground to the
exact size and shape, and there was
great risk of breakage. But it was
done at last, and Myn Duivel was fitted
phere as a field for archaeological
study, the great question has been to
settle conjectures as to how the pre
historic tribes and nations sprang up in
America. The theory most widely ac
cepted is based on .the hypothesis that
the vanguard of human migration to
this continent was composed of wan
dering tribes- from Asia who crossed by
the Bering- Straits into Alaska and
who, meandering southward through
North America, finally settled in Mex
ico.. By this theory South America was
populated partly by subsequent migra
tions from the same source and partly
by secondary ones from the Mexican
settlers. It is possible that further Za
potecan explorations will settle this
question, which for four hundred
years has been a scientific riddle, and
that the phonetic writings, burial cus
toms and architectural peculiarities
brought to light on and about Monte
Alban may disclose' the origin.- and
even the progenitors themselves of the
first Americans." ' â¢ '

fought violently- against the inpoVation,
but at length he became reconciled, and
he is now an extremely proud, not to
say a conceited, dog. His teeth are
taken out and cleaned each night with
his own toothbrush and a special tooth
powder.
"The outlay for materials used in ex
periments and failures," said Mr. Mose
ly. "was considerable. â¢ My leading
mechanic was employed on the case for
over ten days, and I put in more hard
work and took more skin off my finger
tips in shaping those" teeth than I
have done in a year of ordinary work.
No, I shouldn't care to do another one

even then I should think twice."

"BIG BILL" MASON, the Most Dangerous of Criminals, According to the New YorK Detectives.
FORMER President Chester A.

avenue, New York, was robbed
in 1885. A boy m the uniform
of a district messenger, called
with a message. .While the ser
vant went with the note for its answer
the boy seized a piece of silver on the
hatra^ckâ it was a card case or some
thing of that kindâ withdrew from the
house, shut the door softly and i
his h?els. The girl returned and found
the ornament and boy had disappeared.
The echo of that robbery cam.; last
Week with the arrest of -Big Bill" Ma

tured with him, was Frank Spencer,
alias "Red" Spencer, the thief who
robbed former President Arthur's

Captain McClusky, chief of the De
tective Bureau at police headquarters,
performed a public service of great
value when his detectives, at the risk
of their lives,- snapped the handcuffs on
those four men. According to the re

HERE IS THE WAY TO DO SEVERAL CLEVER PARLOR TRICKS.
A NUMBER of clever young pres

town with a lot of tricks that
seem to have been laying under

ten or fifteen years. New
names have been given the tricks and
to the younger generation they have
all the attraction of being positively

Jack Moore, an old pal. On Decem
ber IS, only nine days after his escape,
he and Moore broke into the house of
Vice President Bradley of the Tarry
town Savings Bank.
They carried off a bag of solid sil
ver, took an early morning train and
reached Tonkers about daylight, went
into a little all-night restaurant and
were drinking coffee, when the loca!
police, who had become suspicious, ar
rested them.
In the railroad depot the bag was
opened and the silver bound. The of
ficers took the prisoners by first train
to New York for identification. Head
quarters detectives instantly recog
nized them as notorious ex-convicts.
The big, slim six-footer was William
Mason, and the short, sandy haired
chap was Jack Moore.
The Yonkers Kawkshaws opened
their mouths wide at this, but they
were congratulated on their longhead
edncs? in making the arrest. They had
covered themselves thick with glory
and were praised. The prisoners were
taken to Yonkers. tried, convicted and
00 January 11. 1888, sentenced to four
teen y'-ars in Sing Sing.
Muore was pardoned August 7, 1895.
"Big Bill" Mason, for good behavior it
was always declared, got his "time"
reduced five years and two months. So
he soon found himself afloat again in
the world, in the full strength of his
r:anhood. so far as muscle and nerve
were concerned. How Mason really
got out of prison ahead of time will be
expl&inf-d further on in this sketch.
He was next heard of at Terre Haute,
Ind. His photograph was sent to the
Now York police by the Terre Haute
Chief. Mason, with "Jack" Frye, an
other New York thief and murderer,
and "Reddy the Gloucester," robbed
the house of George A. Schall, at No.
432 North Sixth street, Terre Haute.
On receiving their pedigrees from
New York the authorities put them
through the courts at lightning speed.
The three men were convicted and sunt
to the penitentiary at Michigan City,
Ind, â Masiin fur four years under the
ranic of William T. Wrigtit, January
28, 1887.
Mason soon showed the Hooaiers that
he was no common New Yorker, if he
was a thief. On thp following July he
knocked his keeper down, bruising him
as if he had been hit with a ton of
PhÂ«laÂ£elphiA brick. Then Mr. Mason
from New York quietly escaped aiiu
of secret magnetism, clairvoyance,
psychic amd mysterious influences.

by these young 1 magician?. The tricks

skipped to other climes.
On a cool, wintry morning, December
3, 1897, George R. Blodgett, ounsel for
the General Electric Company, was lin
ing at Schenectady, N. Y. He was well
to do, and his house was liberally fur
nished. Just before daylight on that
morning his wife woke him, whisper
ing that some one was in the room.
Blodgett attempted to rise, when a
tall man ordered him to throw up his
hands. He failed to obey. There was
ju.st an attempt at resistance, when
the lawyer fell back dead.
Still another crime was committed in
Providence on March 8, 1898. William
O. Hutchins, a Jeweler of wealth, was
killHi in his own house by a bullet fired
as Mason always shoots his lead. The
porch had been climbed and the win
dow opened for the burglar to enter.
After murdering the man and robbing
his house the thief escaped by the win
dow and porch to the ground. Second
Story robberies, especially over a porch,^

methods of earning State prison fame/
Much has been printed about the
heartless murder of Major William C.
Wilson, the aged librarian who was
found dead in his book store at No. 1117
Walnut street, Philadelphia, last Aug
ust. That crime made a deep impres
sion on the police and the community.
The best men of the force set at work,
authorized to employ every resource in
discovering Mason's whereabouts.
Warnings were telegraphed to all prin
cipal cities, but the robber must have
kept himself well informed as to the
situation. As the heat of the investiga
tion increased he withdrew to cooler
quarters and kept himself hidden in the
background.
Captain McClusky and his assistants
learned that Mason and Coffey had
gone West after the Philadelphia mur
der. When Coffey returned to New
York recently and opened a saloon in
Cherry street, near Pearl, Captain Mc-
Clusky showed his detective cleverness
in believing that Mason would soon ap
pear on the scene, so he laid his plans
accordingly.
Detectives Fogarty and Stripp were
detailed to shadow the place. Presents
ly "Red" Spencer appeared. He was
but a few days out of prison. The
former convicts were shadowed to the
West Shore depot ferry, at the foot of
West Forty-second street. The officers
on duty there were quietly instructed
to "lend a hand" and be ready for ac
tion.
Mason drew his gun. Fogarty's thumb
flashed between the hammer and the
cartridge at the instant Mason was
pulling the trigger.

"Big Biff" Mason, Captured at Last After Committing Aff Sorts of Crimes
From New YorK to San Francisco.
A hair's breadth of time in Mason's
favor would have sent the bullet
through the detective's brain. Then
followed a desperate hand to hand
struggle. Mason had sworn an oath as
big as a street car that never, never on
this round globe would he be taken
alive by any man in brass buttons and
blue uniform. The robbers â all desper
ate devils, all powerful athletes, seeing
Sing Sing and perhaps the electric
chair yawning for them â fought like
tigers. But the detectives w^re a whole
menagerie of wild beasts of strength
and ferocity. For a few minutes the
situation was serious and desperate.
The detectives, however, knew all the
tricks, and landed blows where they
would paralyze most men. Presently
the robbers were hammered into rea
son, collared and handcuffed.
It was one of the three great fights
of the yearâ Dewey, Schley and the
New York detectivesâ all for law and
order. The bandits, whose hands are
red with crime, were caged behind steel
bars and under thick walls in the dun
geons at police headquarters.
They remained silent and sullen.
They know exactly what to do and
what to say; that is, when the time
comes. Until then you will get nothing
from them.
According to the detectives, these
men are the most dangerous criminals
of recent years. They would as soon
shoot a man as rob his house or
strangle his wife.
Mason is a unique figure in the army
of crime. He occupies no second place.
He is general in chief. He fears noth
ing and a ton years' sentence in State
prison i 3 but a morning's incident in
his calculations.
At police headquarters, in the pri
vate office of Chief McClusky, the im
plements of their trade were displayed
on a table. A child could have carried
the entire arsenal of the murderous
gang.
A bit of iron no larger than one's lit
tle finger, and only a foot long, is a
jimmy for opening the strongest win
dow. A larger instrument, exactly like
it, which a man could hide up his
sleeve, would force a locked oaken bank
door from its binges,
A pair of twisted drills of the finest
Sheffield steel lay beside the Jimmies
and the pistols. The detective pointed
to an old-fashioned bit brace, which
never cost more than 40 cents. It was
cheap, he said, but it did their work
well.
The drills were a different breed of
ducks. They were the highest-grade
tools that experts have yet devised.
"With these drills and the old bit brace
Mason or any of his gang could bore
a hole in any bank safe.
It was not a roll of putty of the size
of an egg and about as long that lay
on the table, wrapped in paper, but it
looked like putty.
It was soft, pasty dynamite.
"It's enough to blow up a building,"
paid Detective Sergeant Sheridan, the
custodian of the records of the office.
"A mite of this paste inserted in the
little finger of a lady's kid glove, and
the little finger with the paste inside it
inserted In the hole drilled into the
safe, will blow off the steel door, when
exploded by a lighted fuse.
"The thieves understood their busi
ness. .They were afraid of nothing, and
it is a big thing for the country that
they have been captured and caged to
await a long sentence to Sing Sing. The
prison is hungry for the blood-stained
robbers."
New facts in the history ot Mason
are coming to light daily since his re
cent arrest. His real name is Benja
min Lippy; he was born at Carondelet,
near St. Louis. The gold fever took him
to the Paciilc Coast when a young man,
where he is credited with doing a slick
job or two in and around San Fran
cisco. He made the acquaintance of
train robbers and began a wild career.
Originally he was a carriage painter
and decorated many a coach for the old
French families of Carondelet. T ike
many of the Western quick shooters
he has a sickly look, which is increased
by high cheekbones and a cadaverous
appearance, but he is all muscle and
the skin on his neck would make a
valise.
Captain McClusky said:
"I consider Bill Mason n menace to
civilization when he is loose. The pub
lic have no idea of his abilities as a
robber and murderer. Notwithstanding
what has been said he seldom works
alone. No pal has dared to go back
on him to any serious extent.
"Many fine residences along the At
lantic coast, around Newport. Boston,
Philadelphia and other cities, have been
robbed by this chief of burglars. In
nearly every prominent town agents
work for him.

CHANCES FOR AMERICAN
TRADE WITH THE ORIENT
BY WU TING FANG, Chinese Minister at Washington.
WASHIIs'GTON, July IS.â Wu Ting-Fang, Chinese Minister to United
States, is a wonderfully interesting man. With the exception of LI
Hung Chang he is doubtless the ablest and most progressive states
man of Celestial origin who has ever visited this country. For that
matter he is more closely in touch with European and American hab
its of thought than Li Hung Chang himself. He speaks the English
language with a faultlessness of accent and of idiom of which many a native
born American might envy and which is equaled by no other Chinese public
man. He is familiar with American and European politics and business. He can
make as appropriate and effective after-dinner speeches as Speaker Reed or
Chauncey Depew. Minister Wu was educated in England and was the first ( hi
nese gentleman who ever became an E.iglish barrister. He visited the LniteU
States in 1577 and then returned to Hongkong, where he established himself as
a barrister After six years of practice he was appointed legal adviser to U
Hung Chang and deputy for foreign affairs in Tientsin. It was his great distinc
tion too to have built the first railroad in China, having been the prcmot3r and
first' director of the Kai Ping Railway Company. He was First Secretary of Em
bassy in the peace mission to* Japan in 1&95, and was plenipotentiary for the pur

bf-en appointed chief director of the Tientsin University, which was established
in 1895 In 1597 he was appointed to his present post. He is accredited as Envoy
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary not only to the Government of the
United States but also to Spain ami Peru. He resides the greater part of the
year in Washington and directs from here the affairs of the legations at .Madrid
and Lima. The wife of Minister Wu is a woman of rare intelligence, who, like
him has made a study of the English language. Ills children are bright young
sters who have their English gov( rne^s and who play up and down the iui'is of
the legation with the abandon and bnisterousness of American boys. As v Chi-.
nese statesman he naturally looks with keenest interest upon the part in Oii
ental politics which America seems likely to play.
THE prospects for the extension
of American trade with China
are excellent just at the present
time. The material awakening
of the empire is just beginning,
and the volume of foreign trade and of
domestic improvements, which will de
pend largely on foreign enterprise, is
bound to increase with wonderful rap
idity for the next few decades. The
prejudice of the inhabitants of China
against the building of railroads, tele
graphs and telephones, and, I may say,
a hundred other things that vjould
cause her to lose step in the march of
modern civilization, is finally disap
pearing.
Thus you can see at once what a
large field is opened for shrewd, ener
getic Americans who know an advan
tage when they see it, and are quick
to grasp it when presented. If the Chi
nese exclusion act were repealed by
this or the next Congress the people
of the United States would be still more
benefited. It is hardly necessary to ar
gue a point like this; it is a self-evi
dent proposition.
Then, there is no prejudice against
American goods, nor any preference for
goo :1s of other nations to interfere with
the expansion of trade with the United
States. On the contrary, certain sta
ples produced by the United States
have almost the entire field.
Take, for instance, kerosene oil,
matches, American flour, and Ameri
lcan cutton cloth. The trade in Ameri
can flour is simply immense. No other
country seems able to cope with the
United States in these articles with
my people. The Chinese will take any
thing which is cheap and good. And
in this connection I may be pardoned.
I hope, if I make a suggestionâ that
the manufacturers of the United States
study more closely the local wants of
the people of China. There are many
ways of doing this. One proposition
that Btrlkea my fancy strongly is the
one advanced recently by the Phila
delphia Museum. This institution has
appointed a commission of skilled men
to visit China and learn by actual ob
servation the exact local wants of the
people. Of course, my Government will
heartily welcome this commission and
will give them every opportunity for
gaining the information desired. Hay

A new incident in Mason's career has
just come to light. After the Pittsfleld
robbery he and his pal, Moore, were
sentenced to prison. Moore was par
doned. Then Mason's wits served him
a wonderful turn of fortune.
He- planned for a pardon, but had no
ing learned what is most wanted by
practical observation American manu
facturers will no longer do business in
the dark.
If they have the enterprise, as they
surely will when they learn of the o-p
portunity, to seize upon this great field,
their rewards will be proportionately
great. China is ready to welcome the
United States as a peaceful neighbor
and commercial friend. Among the in
telligent public men of the Chinese Em
pire there is absolutely no prejudice
against America. On the contrary,
there is a strong desire for the friend
ship of this great republic, and ad
miratic,-n for Yankee ingenuity and* in
ventive genius is quite as pronounced
there as in any other part of the world.
I repeat what I said at the beginning of
this interview â repeal the exclusion
act, which will restore the good will
that existed between China and the
United States previous to the adoption
of that act, and the trade between the
two countries will increase to enormous
proportions.
What has China done, or what have
Chinese merchants done, to encourage
trade with the United States?
That is a difficult question for me to
answer. "You will understand, however,
that when a people are legislated
against as the natives of China have
been, the mercantile interests have not
the opportunity or the zeal to encour
age trade as they would if condi

very much like an individual. A man
trades where he is best treated. This
is human nature the world over, not
excepting China. I live in hope that
whatever may be the differences be
tween the two countries they will dis
appear. China desires to hold friendly
relations with all the world, and par
ticularly with the United States.
The commercial relations between the
Chinese empire and the Philippines are
very great. You will appreciate this
more strongly when I say that over
100,000 Chinese inhabit these islands.
Steamers run continually back and
forth between Honkong and other Chi
nese ports and Manila, exchanging the
products of the two countries. China

To appreciate the recent progress of
China in a material way one must
â¢thoroughly understand the Chinese
character. China to the world at large
is an unknown land. Notwithstanding
all that has been said and written the
Chinese are a very practical people.
They are not movtJ with the fiery
energy of the Anglo-Saxon. They go
slow and hold to the things they have.
Time was when the masses opposed
with a spirit even of fanaticism all in
ternal improvements. That spirit only
exists now in isolated instances. Re
forms are now welcomed as never be
fore. The people are seized with the
spirit of progress. We are a nation of
four hundred millions. ' As it is a law
of nature that large bodies shall move
slowly China is not to be judged in her
forward movement with a smaller na
tion. Nevertheless we are moving for
ward.
The genius of China is not In the line
of the acquisition of territory. Were
she circumscribed in. territory* perhaps
her ambition might be for more. It has
been said of her by Lord Wolseley, that
in time she will overrun the world with
her millions of inhabitants. No one need
fear such a result. Genghis Khan is
pointed to as a bright exemplar of what
the Chinaman will do when he once
sets about it. But that illustrious war
rior was a Mongol. Now the Chinese
are not Mongols, in the proper sense of
the "word, although the masses of man
kind so believe. The Chinese are a dis
tinct, race altogether. No, we shall be
satisfied if we are let alone and al
lowed to work out our destiny as a na
tion in our own way. That way may
not be the way of the European or
American; but it is the way best suit
ed to the peculiar nature of the race
or races which inhabit what is known
as China,
A national awakening is already go
ing on. Some years ago a Chinese dip
lomat in Great Britain wrote an article
which excited much discussion in
America and on the continent, the
opening sentence of which was, 'China
awake!' That watchword is on the lips
of millions to-day, although when it
was uttered it sounded like a discord
ant note. China is awake. It is no
small task to lift a nation to the plane
of the high ideals of her wise men.
But when a people once awake to the
dangers which surround them they
make rapid progress. China is not in
such an advanced stage of decomposi
tion as some affect to Delieye. Aroused
as she now is to her niaterial interests
her future is secure.
Of course the mystery of these tricks
is greatly increased by deft finger and
hand manipulations of the performers.
Amateur performers frequently con
tent themselves with performing these
hair tricks by simply making the ob
jects move in one direction, toward
themselves, and never trying to move
anything heavier than four ounces, the
limit of strength of the hair of a wo
man's head. By practice both of these
may be so modified as to escape the at
tention of the spectator.Years ago Ah Fong came
to the islands a poor trader.
He quickly amassed a great
fortune and attained wide
influence, married and raided
fifteen children; several of
the daughters have mar
ried prominent Causasians.
One day Ah Fong took his
eldest son and left for China
and there he has remained.
His wife and children were
left in Honolulu in affluent
circumstances.
THE Ah Fong family is unique,

beauties can boast of a mixture, of

. Mr. Ah Fong, a Chinese gentleman
with the. Intelligent face of the higher
Chinese merchant, left China and came
to Honolulu, in search of a. fortune; al
though he found himself in the tropics
he eschewed hammocks and was shy,
"of the seductive siesta. It might even
be said that the seemingly impassive

goods. Then he branched out and
went heavily into opium, and he be
gan to be known as a very wealthy
man. ; Later he invested money in a
sugar plantation, and this investment,
too, proved a paying one. Mr. Ah
Fong was also prudent and provident,
and, although hospitable, he was very

"Once or twice I nearly fell asleep,
but the movement of the boat rocking
with the swell gave me a surlden bump .
that roused me in an instant. After
an hour or so had been spent this way
and it was. getting along toward noon
I thought of going ashore. Then I
concluded that it was too pleasant and
I would wait until the breeze sprang
up.
"So I commenced to doze again. This
time I was awakened by a terrific
splash near by. My first Impression
was that the wind had come. but. on

only a round circle of bubbles and

unintentionally I had brought along.

the remote past, and the couple lived
happily together. Gradually the fam
ily grew until thirteen daughters and
two sons clustered about the Ah Fong
knee. Mr. Ah Fong built a beautiful
home on Xuuanu avenue, the most pic
turesque portion of Honolulu, with its
palm lined roads and wealth of tropi
cal foliage. The house was large; it
had reason to be, for although the fam
ily was united in love, it was neces
sarily divided by its numbers. The
house wss very handsome, of the Pa
goda form of architecture; there were
two stories and each had a veranda
running about it with pointed effects,
suggestive of China, and very differ

neighbors.
The Ah Fongs had a carriage and a
Chinese coachman. Mr. Ah Fong sat
in the back seat when being driven to
the wharf for a first call on a newly
arrived man-of-war, or other formal
function. At other times he sat by the
coachman, and to the uneducated
American eye this was disastrous, al

best lawyers and he had the caution
and calm judgment of hi? race, joined
with their indomitable energy and per
severance. And he began to send
money to China.
He bought a summer place for his
family at Waikiki, where the surf
rolled up to his door, and where could
be found any attraction that might be
lacking in his city house. And Mr.
Ah Fong was recognized as one of the
wealthy men of Honolulu.
Then, one morning, the Isles of Ha
waii awoke and they learned that Mr.
Ah Fong was to be known no more
forever In the land where he had ac
quired wealth and position â not â to
speak of family. He had taken his
oldest son and returned to the land of
his forefathers; to the fortune he had
sent before him, and â Hawaii whis
pered âto another family, which was
"though lost to eight, to memory dear,"
after the manner of the Orient.
And Mrs. Ah Fong pursued the even
tenor of her ways; she smiled as pla
cidly, brought up her daughters as ad
mirably, kept open house as hospita
bly and spent the Ah Fong money, set
tled upon her, as judiciously. As the
girls grew up they were brought out
in turn, and it was a remarkable fact
that never a word was said against one
of them, in spite of their number and
in a place where the half whites or
Havvaiians were so often open to sus
picion, and often the subject of gos
sip. The girls would drive to the open
air band concepts Saturday afternoons,
the carriage filled to overflowing and
looking like an animated, brightly col
ored bouquet, its load of occupants gay
with their vivid pink, blue, green and
yellow saÃhes and ribbons; for the Ah
Fong girls did not care for pale col
ors. Their pinks were all magentas
and their reds of scarlet hue.
And the Ah Fong name became
Afong.
The naval officer was sure of a
hearty reception and an appreciative
audience in the Afong mansion; in fact,
the family kept open house and the of
ficers were welcome to breakfast,
lunch or dinner â or, if between meals,
to cooling drinks, cigars and always
warm-hearted cordiality. There was
sure to be a certain coterie of officers
on each ship that were at home in
the Afong house, devoted themselves to
the Afong girls at dances and escorted
them to teas, tennis, or wherever it
might be.
They were a nice, unaffected, jolly
set of girls, admirably brought up, with
well-bred manners, always ladylike and
not at all boisterous or hoydenish.
Marie, one of the older daughters,
played the ukulele and sang fetching
Hawaiian songs and she was always
in demand for moonlight boating par
ties; the others were variously attrac
tive by reason of youth and a warmth
of hospitality Imbibed from the islands
and alluring to the stranger.
The Afong girls were not beauties,
but they were petite of figure and pi
quant of feature. They had not the
brightness and quickness of the Amer
ican girl. They were just pliable, am
iable, docile, well mannered and good
natured young women. They never
took exception at fancied slights. Their
position was assured, as far as it went,
and they did not seek to penetrate into
the most intimate daily life of the "old
families," or the fashionable new ones.
They went to all the larger entertain
ments, and if they were not bidden to
exclusive lunches, dinners or other
smaller functions it did not seem to
trouble their girlish hearts.
None the less, It was an eye opener
to all the easy-going Isles of Hawaii,
to conservative naval circles, and to
Captain Whiting's friends, when Etta,
a round-faced, pink-cheeked, almond
eyed bud of seventeen, just out of
school, met and conquered the able
officer, gray-haired man .of the world,
and traveled gentleman, Captain Whit-
Ing.
Several of the Afong girls had mar
ried by this time; one was the wife of
J. Alfred Magoon, an auctioneer, who
had settled in Honolulu; the eldest
married Mr. McStoeker, a dry goods
merchant, and the younger one was
married to a dentist named Hutchin
son, and left Honolulu with her hus
band for a time. This was an unhappy
match, however, and Mrs. Hutchinson
procured a divorce and returned to
her home alone. She has since become
engaged to the doctor on a man-of
war recently in Honolulu.
Marie Afong, who was perhaps the
brightest of all the girls, married a
Hawaii
young lawyer named
Humphries, a new
jomer In Honolulu.
All fair matches
from .a wordly point
Df view, but upon
Etta's young brow
rested the laurel
wreath; she was to
marry in the nayy â and a commander
at that. Speculation was rife as to the
ultimate effect of this match on Cap
tain Whiting's position in the navy,
while it was openly wondered if Mrs.
Whiting's lot would be a happy one
when she found herself transported to
some naval station, where her ancestry
was not the accepted old story that it
had become in the land of her birth.
And it was remarked that after the
marriage the choice naval stations did
not seem to come Into Captain Whit
ing's way, as they had heretofore.
But they were content for all that.
Captain Whiting's devotion to his
young wife was unmistakable, and she
proved a nice, good, little helpmate to
him. Their small daughter, not yet
three years old, is the pride of the cap
tain's heart, and all went well in the
Whiting family. Then the villain,
without whom no romantically happy
couple can do, appeared upon the scene
in the nerson of Paymaster Wilcox.
But the tropics is no place for a trag
edy, so the curtain will fall upon his
discomfiture and the Whitings will live
happily forever after.
There are plenty of Afong girls still
left unmarried to gladden the hearts
23
and homes of plently of youth an 4
chivalry. . '.
In the preparations to welcome our
"Boys' in Blue" they have each taken
$. prominent part, and who knows how
many more Afong rirls will, in the fu
ture, say through the Golden .Gate to
look for the hospitality here that they
have always been ready to accord the
stranger in their tropical home.
At a dinner given in honor of the
Monadnock's officers by J. R. Burns
at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Mr. Wil
cox, while flushed with wine, spoke dis
paragingly of the Ah Fong family, and
especially of Captain Whiting's wife,
who was a Miss Ah Fong. He went so
far as to charge Mrs. Whiting with
having addressed him (Wilcox) in lan
guage such as no lady would utter.
The conduct of his subordinate was
reported to Captain Whiting, and for a
time it was thought that a duel be
tween the men was unavoidable. The
counsel of friends prevailed, and the
monitor's commander was induced to
give the paymaster a chance to resign
from the service. Should Wilcox not
do so, charges of drunkenness and con
duct unbecoming a gentleman will be
preferred against him.

rhymes refused to come. He changed the meter;
he gave. up laboring to fit words to the a:r of "Suwaneo
River," and started fresh Itnea which would go to the
tune of "Greenland's Icy Mountains," a meter with
which he had at other times been notoriously successful.
But it failed him now. He could , not get the jingle; spare
feet bristled at every .turn; and the field of puppies on
which his muse was engaged became every moment more
and more elusive; â 
It was no 'use. .He put down the pencil and sighed;
and then frowning at himself for his Indecision, took out
the letter-card again and deliberately reread It, front
and buck.
Captain Kettle was a man who made up his mind over
most matters with the. quickness of a pistol shot, and
once settled, rightly or wrongly, he always stuck to his
decision. But here, on the letter card, was a matter ho
could not get .the balance of at till; it refused to be dis
missed, even temporarily, from his mind; it Involved In
terests far too large to be hazarded by a hasty verdict
either one way or the other and. the difllculty in coming
to any satisfactory conclusion irritated him heavily.
The letter-card was anonymous, and seemed 10 pre
sent no clew to Its authorship. It was typewritten; It was
pitted, as the stamp showed, in Newcastle; it committed
its writer in no degree whatever. But it made statements
which, if true, ought to have sent sumermdy to penal
servitude, and it threw out hints, whether true or untrue,
that made Captain Kettle heir to a whole world of anxiety
and trouble.
It is an excellent academic rule to entirely disregard
anonymous letters, but it is by no means always an easy
rule to follow. And there are times when a friendly
warning must be conveyed anonymously, or no; at all.
But Kettle did not worry himself about the ethh - "f
anonymous letter Writing as a profession; his atti
was taken up by this typewritten card for Well Wisher,
which he held in his hand.
.. "Your ship goes to sea never to reach port," he
nail. "There is an insurance robbery cleverly rig
ged. You think yourself very smart, I know, but
.this time you are being made a common gull of."
And the writer wound up by saying: "I can t give
you any hint of how it's going to be aone. OnTy I
know trie -game Is fixed. So keep your weather eye
skinned, and take the Sultan of Labuan safely nut
and haclc, and maybe you'll get something more
â ' . solid than. a drink. From
'â¢YOUR WELT. WISHER."
Kettle crammed the blue letter-card into his
pocket and took his cap. "My^dear," he called down to
. Mrs. Kettle, who was engaged on the family wash in the
kitch.eo bel(.w, "I've got to run up to the office to see Mr.
<sedge. â  I don't think I quite understand his wishes about
running .the boat. Get your tea when it's ready; 1 don't
want to keen you and th-e youngsters w.niting. "
Captain^ Kettle thought out many things as he Jour
neyed from South Shields to the grimy oincc of his em
ployer in Newcastle, but his data were insufficient, and
he was unable to get hold of any scheme by which he
could -safely appioach what was. to say the very least of
It, a very delicate subject. Mr. Gedge had hired him as
captain. of the Sultan of Labuan; had said no word about
losing her. and how was he to force the man's confidence?
It looked th& most unpromising enterprise In the world.
Moreover, although in the outer world he was us brave a
fellow as ever lived, he had all a shipmaster's timidity at
â tackling a shipowner In his lair, and this, of course, han
dicapped him.
In this mood, then, hÂ» was ushered upon Gedge in his
office, and saw him signing letters, and casting occasional
sentences to a young woman, who flicked them down In
shorthand.
The. shipowner frowned. He was very busy. "Well,
captain." be said, "what is It? Talk ahead. I can listen
whilst I sign these letters."
"It's a private- question- Id like to ask you about run
ning the boat."
"Want Miss Payne to go out?"
"If I might trouble her so far."
Gedge jerked his head toward the door. "Type out
what you've got," he said. The shorthand writer went
out and closed the glass door after her. "Now, Kettle."
Captain Kettle hesitated. It was an awkward subject
to begin upon.
"N.i\v, then, captain, out with it, quick. I'm in the
devil of a hurry."
"I wish you'd let me know a little more exactlyâ ln on
fidence, of course â how you wish me to run this steamer.
Do you want me toâ l meanâ"
"Well, get on, eet on."
""When do you want her back?"
Gedge leaned back in his chair, tapped his teeth with
the end of. his pen. "Look here, captain, " ne said, "you
didn't come here to talk rot like this. You've had your or
ders already. â  You aren't a drinking man, or I'd say you
were screwed. So there's something else behind. Come,
out with it."
"I hardly know how to begin."
"I don't want rhetoric. 1/ you've gt>t a tale, tell it, If
not"â Mr. Gedge leaner! his desk again and went on
signing, his letters.
Captain Kettle stood ..,<-â¢ rudeness without so much as
a flush. He sighed a little, and then, after' another few
moments' thought. -took the letter-card from his pocket
and laid It on his employer's- table. After Gedge had
conned through and signed a couple mare sheets, he took
the card up In tns fingers and skimmed it trough.
As he read the color deepened In his face, and Kettle
saw that he was moved, but said nothing. For a moment
there was silence between them, and Gedge tapped at his
teeth and was apparently lost in thought. Then he said:
""Whe're did you get this?"
"Through the post." . â 
"And why did you bring it to me?"
"I thought you-might have something. to say about It."
â *ShOWTi It to any one else?*'.
"X". sir; I'm In your service and earning your pny."
"Yes. I pulled ym; out of the gutter again quite re
' cently. and you said you'd be able to get your wife's
clothes out of pawn with your advance note."
"I'm very grateful to you for giving me The berth, sir;
and I shall be ,n faithful servant to you as long as I'm in
. your employ. Tint if there's anything on I'd like to be in
your confidence. I know she isn't an old snip, but â "
"But what?"
"She's uneconomical. Her engines are old-fashioned.
It wouldn't pay to fit her with triple-expansions and new
boilers."
"I see. You anp>ar to know a lot abrut the ship, cap

MR. GEORGE`S CATSPAW
Adventures of Capt. Kettle
I'm not the sort of man to try and make my dividends out
of Lloyds'. No. not by any means, captain; I've got my
name to keep up."
Captain Kettle brought up a sigh of relief. "Glad to
hear it, sir; I'm glad to hear It. Hut I thougnt it best to
have it out with you. That beastly letter upset me."
Gedee laughed slyly! "Well, If you want to know who
wrote the letter, I did myself."
Kettle stared. He was obviously Incredulous.
"Well, to be accurate, I did it by deputy. You hae yer
doots, eh? Hang it, man, what an unbelieving Jew you
are." He pressed one of the electric pushes by the side of
hia desk, and the shorthand writer came In and stood at
the doorway. "M:sh Payne, you typed this letter card,
didn't you?" and Miss Payne dutifully answered, "Yes."
"Tha.uk you. That'll do. Well, Kettle, I hope you're
satisfied now? I sent this blessed card because I wanted
to Fee how deep this shore-going honesty of yours went,
which I've heard so much about; and now I know, and
you may take it from me that you'll profit rrom it finan
cially In the very near future. The shipmasters I've had
to do with have been mostly rogues, and when I get hold
of a straight man, I know now to appreciate him. Now,
jrood-by. captain, and a prosperous voyage to you. If you
catch the midnight mail to-night from horc you'll just get
down to Newport to-morrow in time to Bee her come into
dock. Take her ov<-r at once, you know; we can't have
any time wasted. Here, good-by. I'm frantically busy."
But, busy though he might be, Mr. Gedge did not imiiie-
CAPTAIN KETTLE REPLIED TO THE FIRST OF THESE COMPLIMENTS BY THREE PROMPT REVOLVER SHOTS
diately return to signing his letters after Captain Kettle's
departure. Instead, he took out a handkerchief and wiped
his forehead and wiped his hands, which for some reason
seemed to have grown unaccountably clammy, and for
awhile he lay back in his writing chair like a man who
feels physically sick.
Captain Kettle, however, went his ways humming a
cheerful air, and as the 12-o'elock mail roured out that
night across the high level bridge, he settled himself to
sleep in his corner of a third-class carriage and to dream
the dreams of a man who, aft-r many vicissitudes, has at
last found righteous employment. It was a new experi
ence for him, and he permitted himself the' luxury of en
joying It to the full.
A train clattered into Monmouthshire some twelve
hours later, and he stepped out on Newport platform into
a fog. raw and fresh from the Bristol channel. His small,
worn portmanteau he could easily have carrier! in his
hand; but there Is an etiquette about these matters which
even the hard-up shipmaster to whom a shilling Is a
financial rarity must observe; and so he took a fonr
wheeler down to the agent's office and made himself
known. The Sultan of Labuan. it seemed, had come up
the Usk and pone into dock barely an hour before, and so
Kettle, obedient to his orders, went down at once to take
her over.
It was not a pleasant operation, this misttng another
man from his livelihood, and as Ketttle had been supplant
ed a weary number of times himself, he thought ho knew
pretty wejj the feelings of the man whom he had come to
replace. His reception, however, surprised him. Williams,
the former master of the Sultan of Labuan. handed over
his charge with an air of obvious and sincere relief, and
Kettle felt that he was being eyed v.ith a certain embar
rassing curiosity. The man was not disposed to bo verbal
ly communicative.
"You look knocked up," said Kettle.
"Might well be." retorted Captain Williams. "I haven't
had a blessed wink of sleep since 1 pulled my anchors out
of Thames mud."
"Not had bad weather, have you?"
"Xo, weather's been right enough. Bit tMcklsh, that's
all."
"What's kept you from having a watch below, then?"
"Traid of losing the ship, captain. I never been up be
fore the Board of Trade yet, and don't want to try what it
feels llkÂ«."
"Oh," said Kettle wiht a sigh. "It's horrible; they're
brutes. I know. I have been there."
"So I might have guessed," said Williams, dryly.
"Look here." said Kettle, "what are you driving at?"
"Don't think you're doing me a bad turn, captain,
because you aren't. I wns never so pleased to step out of
a chart house in my life. Only thing Is. I hope I aren't
doing you a bad turn by letting you step In."
"By James!" said Kettle, "do speak plain, captain;
don't go on hinting like this." *
THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 31, 1898.
I am maundering on too much, captain, and that's a
ract. Result of being about tired out, I suppose. But you
must excuse me spt-akhiK further; there's that blasted
libel law to think Ã¼bout. Now, captain, here's the key of
the chart hou.se door, and if you'll let me I'll go out first
and you can lock it behind you. You'll find one of the
tumblers beside the water bottle broken; it fell out of my
hand this morning just after I'd docked her; t>ut all the
rest ia according to Inventory; and I'll knock off three
pence for the tumbler when we square up."
They plunged straightway into the anditlr-s of busi
ness, and kept at it till the captaincy had been formally
laid down and handed over, and then the opportunity for
further revelations was gone. Captain Williams was clear
ly worn out with weariness; responsibility had kept him
going till then, but now that responsibility had ended, he
was like a man in a trance. His eyes drooped; his knees
failed him drunkenly; he was past speech; and if Kettle
had not by main force dragged him off to oed at a tem
perance hotel he would have tumbled down incontinently
a mi] slept like one dead in the gutter. As It was he lay on
the counterpane in the heaviest of sleep, the picture of a
Btrong man worn out with watching and labor, and for a
minute or so Kettle stood beside the bed and gazed upon
him thoughtfully.
"By James!" he muttered, "if I could make you speak,
captain, I believe you could tell a queerisn tale."
But Kettle did not loiter by this taciturn bedside. He
had signed on as master of the Sultan of Labuan; he was
in Mr. Gedge's employ and earning Mr. Gedge's pay, and
every minute wasted on a steamer means money lust. He
went briskly across to the South dock, and set the ma
chinery of business to work without delay. There was
grumbling from both mates, fii^ineers and crew that had
hern given leisure for scarcely a breath of ignore air, but
Kettle was not a man who courted popularity from his
underlings by offering them indulgences. He stated that
their duty was to get tho water ballast out. and the coal
under the hatches In the shortest time on record, and
mentioned that he was the mnn who would see it done.
The men grumbled of course; behind their driver's
back they swore; two deck hands and three or the stoke
hold crew deserted, leaving their Wages, and were re
placed by others from the shipping office; and still the
work went remorselessly on under tho gray glow of the
fog so long as daylight lasted, and then under the glare or
raw electric arc lamps.
Kettle got his clearance papers with trie same fierce,
businesslike bustle, and came back and stepped lightly up
on the tramp's upppor bridge
The pilot was there waiting for him, half admiring,
half repelled: the old blue-faced mate nnd the carpenter
wore on the toflscastle head, the second mate v.as aft, the
chief himself an\the third engineer wen- at the throttle
and the reversing* gear below. The ship's entire comple
ment had quite surrendered to the sway or tnis new task
master, and stood in their coal grime and their tiredness
ready to jump at luh bidding.
Bristol channel tides are high, and the current of the
T'sk is swift. It was going to M quick work If they did
not miss the tide, and the pilot, who had no special stake
in the matter, said it could not be done. Kettle, however,
thought otherwise, and the pilot in consequence saw some
seamanship which gave him chills down tne back.
"By gum, captain," he said, when they were fairly out
of the river, "you can handle her."
"Quartermaster." said Kettle, "tell my steward to
bring two goes of whisky up here on the bridge. Pilot, if
you say such things to me, you make me feel like a girl
with a new dress, and I want a drop of Dutch courage to
keep my blushes back."
'Well," said the pilot, when the whisky came, /'here's
lots of cargo, captain, of good bonuses."
"Here's deep-draft steamers for you, pilot, and plenty
of water under 'em."
The whisky drained down its appointed channels, and
the pilot said: "By the by, I've this for you, captain,"
and Drought out a letter-card.
"Typewritten address," r ; tii<l K> ttle. "No postmarak
on the stamp. Who's it from?"
"Man I came across. Look you, though, I didn't know
him. But he said there was a useful tip in the letter
which it would please you to have after you sailed."
Kettle tore off tho perforated edges aijd looked inside
the card. Here was another anonymous communication,
also from Well Wisher, and, as before, warning him
against the machinations of Gedge. "Got no idea who the
man was who gave it you?" he asked.
"Well. I did have a bit of Uilk with him and a drink,
and I rather gathered he might have had something to
do with insurance. But he didn't say his name. Why,
isn't he a friend of yours?"
"I rather think he is," said Kettle, "but I can't be
quite sure vet." He did not add that the anonymous writ
er guaranteed him a present of Â£50 if the Sultan of La
buan drew no insurance money till he had moored her in
Port Said.
From the very outset the voyage of the Sultan of La
buan was unpropitious. Before she was clear of the Usk
it was found that three more of her crew had managed
to .slip away ashore and so were gone beyond replace
ment. Whilst she was still in the brown, muady waters of
*the Bristol Channel there were several breakdowns in the
engine room which necessitated stoppages and anxious re
1 airs. The engines of the Sultan of .Labuan were her
Weak spot, for otherwise her hull was sound enough. But
these machines were old and wasteful in steam, and made
ail the difference in economy which divides a profit from
a loss in these modern days of fierce sea competition.
With Murgatroyd, the old blue-faced mate, Kettle had
been shipmates before, and there existed between the two
men a strong dislike, and a. certain mutual esteem. They
interviewed over duty matters when the pilot left. "Mr.
Murgatroyd," said the little skipper, "you'll keep tho
hatches off and do everything for ventilation. This Welsh
coal's us gassy us petroleum."
"Aye, aye, ' rumbled the mate. "But how about when
heavy "weather comes and the decks are full of water?"
"You'll have fresh orders from me before then. Get
your hoses to work now and sluice down. The ship 3 a
"Aye, aye. But the hands are dog tired."
"Then it's your place to drive them. I should have
thought you'd been long enough at sea to know that. But
if you aren't up to your business, just say, and I 11 swap
you over with the second mate right now.
The old mate's face grew purple. "If you want a
driver." he said, "you shall haye â  one. and with that he
went his way and roused the tired deck hands to work af-
Sr But did not spare Ms crew he was
equally hard on himself. He was at sea now and wearing
his sea-going conscience, which was an entirely different
piece of mental mechanism to that which regulated his
actions ashore. He had received Mr. Gedee s precise in
structions to run the coal boat in the ordinary method.
and ho intended to do it relentlessly and to the letter He
had had his doubts about Mr. Gedge's real wishes before
and even tho episode of Miss Payne, the typewriter had
not altogether deceived him, but the second letter from
"Well Wisher" which the pilot had brought on board
cleared the matter up beyond a doubt. There was not the
faintest chance that Gedge had written that; there was
not the faintest reason to disbelieve now that lÂ»edge
wished his uneconomical steamboat off his hands, and
had arranged for her never aagin to come into port.
Now, properly approached â say with sealed orders to
be opened only at seaâ l think there is very little doubt
but what Captain Kettle would have undertaken to carry
out this nefarious piece of business himself. The average
mariner thinks no more of "making the insurance pay"
than the average traveler does of robbing his fellow coun
trymen by the importation of Belgian cigars and Tauch
nitz novels from the channel packet. And with Kettle,
too, loyalty to an employer, so long as that employer
treated him squarely, ranked high. But for a second time
"Well Wisher had repeated the word "catspaw," and for
his purpose ho could not have used a better spur.
The little captain's face grew grim as he read It. "By
James!" he muttored, "if that's the game he's trying to
play, I'll make him rue it."
In due time the Sultan of Labuan had run down the
Cornish coast, had rounded Land's End. and was standing
oft" on a course which would make Finisterre her next
landfall The glass was Inking steadily. The hatches
â¢w-re off and a good strong smell of coal gas billowed up
from below and mingled with the sea scents.
With all a Northern sailor's distrust for a "Dago,"
Kettio had spotted this spruce young Italian second mate
us Gedge's probable tool, and watched him like the apple
of his eye. No man's actions could have been more inno
cent and normal, and this, of course, made things all the
more suspicious. The engineer staff, who had accesss to
bilge cocks, and could arrange disasters to machinery,
wore likewise ex-ofticio suspicious persona, but as it was
quite Impossible to overlook them at all hours and on all
occasions, he hsul regretfully to tatke them very largely
on trust.
Blundering, incompetent old Murgatroyd, the mate
was the only man on board In whose honesty Kettle had
the least faith, simply because he considered him too stu
pid to be intrusted with any operation so delicate as .bar
ratry, and to Murgatroyd he more or less confided hia in
tentions.
"I hear there's a scheme on board to scuttle this
steamboat," he said, "because she's too expensive to run

and he told me he madY a profit on her. lTn going by Mr'

"Aye," grunted the mate.

be The old man's suggestion about the hatches had touched
upon a sore point. Kettle knew quite well that It was dan
gerous to leave the great gaps in the decks undefended ay

Hour after hour Kettle, in his glistening oilskins had
been stumping backward and forward across the upper
bridge, watching his steamboat like a cat, and holding on
with his order until the very last moment. But at last he
gave the command to batten down, and both watches
rushed to help the carpenter carry It out . Âââ,._ _..<*,,
The hands clustered on the lurching iron decks , w iUi

"Aye," said Murgatroyd. " - '" . J 'â '":

have to take care if we do not want to go to heaven

'round now and see it done yourself. .
"Aye, aye. But you don't mean the side lights, top,
do ye? .There's a big lot of shipping- here in the bay, and
we might easy get run downâ" The old man. caught an
ugly look from Kettles' face and broke off. And grum
bling some ancient saw about "obeying orders if you
break owners," he shuffled off down the ladder.
Night went and the day came, gray and wet and deso
late. The heavier squalls had passed away, but a whole
gale still remained, and the sea was if anything neavier. â¢
The coal boat rarely showed all of herseir at once above
the water. Her progress was a' succession of dives, her
decoration (when she was visible), a fringe of spouting
scuppers. Watch had succeeded watch with the dogged
patience of sailormen,' but watch after watcn Kettle hung
on behind the canvas dodgers at the weather end of the
bridge. He was red-eyed and white-cheeked, his torpedo
beard was foul with sea salt, he was unpleasant to look
upon, but he was undeniably very much awake, and when
the accident came (which he concluded was Mr. Gedge's
effort to realize the coal boat's insurance) he was quite
ready to cope with emergencies.
From somewhere In the bowels of the ship there came
the muffled boom of an explosion; the bridge sprang up.
beneath his feet so that he was very nearly wrenched
from his hold, and the iron main deck, which at that mo- .
ment happened to be free of water, rippled and heaved as
a tin biscuit box moves when it is kicked. There was a
tinkle of broken glass as some blown-out skylights crash
ed back upon the deck. . ~ â¢
He looked forward and he looked aft, and to his sur
prise saw that both hatches were still in place and that
very little actual damage was visible,, and then he had
his attention occupied by another matter. From the .
stokehold, from the forecastle and- from the engine room'
â¢the frightened crew poured out Into 'the open, and some
scared wretch cried out to "lower away zem boats,"
Here was a situation that needed' dealing with at once, â 
and Kettle was the man to do it. From beneath his oil
skins he lugged out the revolver which they Knew so pain- â¢
fully already, and showed It .with ostentation. "By.
James." he shouted, "do you want to be taught who's â¢
captain here?. I'll give cheap lessons if you ask." .
His words reached them above the hooting and brawl â¢
of the gale, and they were cowed into sullen obedience. â¢â .
â  ,- Presently a bare-headed steward fought his way up
the bridge ladder against the tearing wind, and bawled
out some ' startling news: "It's Mr. {Murgatroyd's-' room
that's been blown up, sir; made a 'orrld mess or; Chips
Bays 'c picked up 'is lighted pipe in the alley way, sir,, an'
It must 'a' been that that fired the gas."
"The blamed old thick-head,"- said Kettle, savagely.
" 'E was arskin' for you, sir, was the mate, though we ;
couldn't rightly make out what 'c said." . , ' .
"He won't be pleased to see me. - Smoking, by James,
was he?" â :.'â â¢â â 
"The mate's burnt up like a piece of coke-," said the
steward, persuasively. "'E cawn t last long. It's a mar
vel 'ow 's's alive at all, sir!" , . â¢
â¢ The carpenter came up on the bridge. "Dose blow-up .
was not so bad for der ole ship. sir.: She nod got any
plates started dot 1 can see." Dey have der bilge pumps
running, but dere's nod much water. Und der mate, sir.
He say he would like to see you.. He's in ver' bad way."
. The author of all the mischief, the stupid old man who,
through sheer â¢ crass, ignorance had gone to bed and
smoked a pipe in this powder magazine, lay horribly in- â '
jured in the littered alleyway, with a burst straw cushion
under the shocking remnants of his heart. Most of his
injuries were plain to the eye, and it was a marvel that
he lingered on at all. It was very evident that he could
not live for long, and it was clear, too, that he wanted
to speak. t
Kettle's resentment died at the sight of this poor
charred cinder of humanity, and he knelt in the litter and
listened.
"Nearly;- got to windward of you, skipper. It was me â
Gedge paid me Â£50 for the Jobâ scuttle â her after Gib :
would 'a' done it. too in spite of your teeth." ;.
The old fellow broke .off, and Kettle leaned near to
him. "How were you going to scuttle her?" be asked.
There was no answer. A second time he repeated the
question, and then again a third time. The mate heard
him. The sea roared outside, the wind boomed overhead,
the cluttered wreckage clanged about the alleyway. The
old man was past speech." but he opened an eve, his one
remaining eye, and slowly and solemnly winked. â 
It was his one recorded -attempt at humor -during a
lifetime, and the effort was his last. His jaw dropped
wagging to the thud of the ship, his eye' opened in -a.
glassy, unseeing stare, and he was as dead a thing as the
iron deck he lay upon. . Â-Â«.-..
"Well*, matey," 'said Kettle, apostrophizing the poor
charred form, "we've been shipmates before and I never
liked you. But. by James, you had your points. You shall*
be buried by a pukka. parson in Gib and have a stone put
over your ugly old head if I have to pay for. it mvsplf I
think I can hammer out a bit of verse, too, whlch'll make
that stone a thing people will remember."
"By James, though, won't Gedge be ' mad over this!
Gedge will think I -spotted the game you were playing for
him. and murdered you out of hand. Well, that's all
right, and it won't hurt you, matey. I want Gedge to un
derstand I'm a man that's got to be dealt stralgnt with
I want Mr. Blessed Gedge to understand that I'm not the
kind of â¢ lamb .to make into a catspaw by any manner of
means. I bet he does tumble to that, too. But I bet also
that he sacks me from this berth before I've got the coals
over into the lighters of Port Said. By James, yes! Gedge
is a man. that sticks to his plans, and as he can't lose the
Sultan of Labuan with me as her skipper, he'll- jerk' an
other old man into the chart house on the/end of a wire
who'll do the job more to his satisfaction."
The Norwegian carpenter came up and asked a crea
tion.
"No, no, Chips; put the canvas away. I want you to
knock up some sort of a box for the poor old mate and
we'll take him to Gib and plant him there in style I owe
him a bit. We'll all get safe enough to Port Said now."
CAUTIOUS.
"Yes, I've been all over Europe, Asia, Africa and Aus
tralia."
"Ever been to America?"
"No, th;> place I won't visit! Tou see, there's a,

SENDING PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S PORTRAIT BY WIRE.
RECEIVING PRESIDENT MrKINLEY'S PORTRAIT BY WIRE.
With Hummers machine it is possi
ble to send an outline drawing but not
!an actual photograph. A signature or
a diagram can be sent, but the least
bit of shading will appear as a mass of
the same tone as the rest of the pic
ture.
In general appearance the work of
the machine looks like a picture made
; of a series of lines all running in one
direction,. Of course this ia flat and
there is a lack of detail most notice
able. However, well trained artists can
: supply all of this so that the finished
picture is all that can be desired.
Mr. Hummel is a young manufactur
ing jeweler In St. Paul, and his inven
tion is the result of numerous experi
( ments thought out and carried out
during all his spare moments for the
j last two years. He believes the instru
; ment will be especially valuable In
I helping to catch criminals fleeing from j
jjustlce by scattering their photographs i
| over the country with the speed of
electricity instead of by .the compara
, lively slow medium of the mails. This,
; however, is only on incidental use for
the invention. In scores of ways the
j device can be put to practical use.
The Hummel invention takes up â 
I about the same space as a typewriter
and its table, or a sewing machine. Its
principal features, of course, are the
transmitter and receiver. Each of these
is operated by a diminutive electric mo
tor, hardly as large as the case of a
pair of spectacles. There is also a
rather complicated system of clock
work which controls the movements as
part of the machine.
The transmitter and receiver each has
a moving carriage, operated by the
electric motor. In these carriages are
fixed the pencils which are used in '
copying the pictures to be sent. The I
carriage of the transmitter has a pro
jecting arm with a vulcanized rubber
extremity, in which is fitted a sharp
platinum point.
By an ingenious device the clock
work movjes this platinum point a very
minute distance from the line in which
it moved before. A screw and triple
series â¢ of ratchets are provided by
which the width between the lines can
be regulated.
When a picture is to be sent over the
wire it is first traced through a carbon
paper upon a metal plate. Then the
lines on the plate are brought out by a
solution of shellac, which is a non-con
ductor of electricity.
After the machine is connected with
the electric circuit and the platinum
point is set in motion each time it en
counters a strip of shellac the circuit
is broken. This break in the circuit

CHANCES OF DEATH IN THE PRESENT WAR.
WAR to-day is a slaughter by
job lots. Modern methods
have largely eliminated the
element of personal bravery.
The. puniest man may
stand behind a cannon, take
his range finder, figure out the right
range, touch a button and destroy a
thousand lives. To a great extent bat
tles are fought in the dark. Shelis are
seen coming through the air from per
haps unknown corners. They fall and
death comes like a bolt from the sky.
In the civil war methods were alto
gether different. Except as obscured
by the smoke of battle, the soldiers
could see their foes and their weapons.
; There were no giant machines for hurl
ing tons of death-dealing iron and steel
through the air from points miles and
miles away. When the Swamp Angel
came into existence we all thoiJght it
was a marvel, and yet it was nothing
compared with the modern engines of
war. In those times, as my own expe- j
rience taught me, in observing the men
who fought, the number of dead and
wounded often depended very largely
upon the personal conduct of the sol
diers themselves. There was no ma- j
chine for dealing out bullets by whole
i sale, and therefore the effect was reg
j ulated infinitely more by circumstances
than it is to-day.
The soldier who goes into battle in
our present war with Spain must face
a storm of bullets which are just as
apt to come from a half dozen machine
guns as from a regiment of soldiers.
j These bullets fly at so many different
; angles that it is almost like a cross-fire
| at times, with the result that the sol
diers are unable to protect themselves
as they were in the old days when there
was a bullet for every gun and no
more. In spite of all this, however, I
am inclined to think that our modern
j methods are the more merciful, for the
chances of a man being hit by a bullet
and living are entirely altered from
what they were in the eld days.
If a bullet strikes a soldier in the head
or some vital part death is almost cer
tain to be practically instantaneous. A
man may survive for a few moments,
but he is never likely to regain con
sciousness. If the bullet does not strike
a vital part then the hospital methods
of to-day, and I am speaking of the
field hospitals, are such that unless
there is such a shattering of tissue and
bone as to preclude the possibility of
recovery the man is almost certain to
regain his health. I well remember
while I was with the army and in the
hospitals during the civil war that to
amputate a man's limb sometimes
meant that death would follow not
from the mere amputation, but because
of that frightful thing known as hos
pital gangrene, which so often made
reamputations necessary.
Now to-day there is no such thing as
hospital gangrLne. At least if there is
it is so rare as to be unknown to the
majority of practitioners in hospitals.
Aseptic surgery has reached that stage
where gangrene is almost an impossi
bility. The result of this will be, in the
field hospitals, that when a man 1? torn
by splinter, shell or bullet, he will be
so treated that there is nothing to con
tend with except the direct physical in
jury caused by the object that inflicted
the wound. Of course, now as then the
probabilities of man's surviving the
shock of a wound are lessened or in
creased by his physical state at the
time he received the wound. Taking
all things into consideration I have no
hesitation in saying that the chances of
the United States soldier of escaping
with his life from the dangers of the
battle field are 75 per cent greater than
they were when last he fought an
enemy of his own color.
The character of the wounds Inflicted
and the immediate effect of the bullet
or pieces of shell that Inflict them are
very different from what they used to
be. We know more about the direct
effect of the bullet than the shell. We
have experimented with medical sub
jects in this regard and have learned
that the force and velocity of the mod
ern bullet is so great that when it
passes through the head of a person it
almost annihilates the brain. The old
style bullet might pass through any
thing and leave merely a clear trail
behind it and therefore its effect was
small In comparison with the present
shell. lam now referring to the bullet
that is authorized by the Geneva con
vention, which forbade the use by any
nation of the explosive bullet that in
flicts such fearful injuries.
Then again a man who receives a bul
let wound in the body suffers from a
much more serious Injury than he
would have in other days. More tissue
Is destroyed and the bone, if hit, is
â splintered more. These things would
make the ordinary wound in a part
which is not vital an exceedingly se
rious matter, if it were not for asep
tic surgery. I do not say that the
uronnds are not serioua as they are. but

passed over the shellac and the circuit
is again closed the needle poir . Is lifted.
It goes without saying that the har
monious working of the delicate instru
ments requires the most careful adjust
ment of the clock work which controls
the velocity of the machine. This ad
justment Mr. Hummel reaches by sev
eral whirling fans, somewhat like the
governors of a steam engine, but with
BY DR. GEORGE F. SHRADY, President Red Cross Society, New YorK
here again we find the injury Is by
modern surgical methods confined sim
ply to the hurt made by the bullet, and
not the result of some after develop
ment. I think a man is more likely to
lose a leg or an arm than during our
last war for the very reason I have
statedâ the increased shattering of bone
and tissue.
"The change in the injuries inflicted
in past and present wars is caused by
the difference in the projectile and in
the material used. The shell breaks
in a different way. It is ao different in
every way that the effect seems to be
much greater, meaning by that that
the injury inflicted is more severe. I
believe that the statement regarding
the bullet, that there are but two al
ternatives, death and recovery, when a
soldier is strickenâ meaning instant
death â holds good in the case of the
shell, and I think that the statistics of
the war's killed and wounded will
prove this satisfactorily.
"The wound inflicted by a splinter
of wood will be infinitely more danger
ous than that resulting from a bit of
shell. I regard the wood splinter
wound, taken altogether, as fright
ful if not the most frightful injury that
can be received in battle in that it

lodges and penetrates the flesh in Jag
ged ways that make recovery well nigh
an impossibility. This fact is entirely
realized by the men at the head of the
modical department of our army and
navy. It is to avoid wounds of this
sort that every bit of woodwork pos
sible Is thrown from a ship when she
goes into action. Stripping for action
is what the naval men call it. but it is
in reality stripping to prevent wounds.

d:Â«ks instead of spheres.
The inventor does not regard his de
vice as beyond the stage of improve
ment, but is now building a machine
which he expects to work still better
than the one in use, and to do its work
in less time. It now takes about twenty
minutes to transmit a complete photo
graph. As will be seen by the repro
ductions, the portraits now sent by wire
are distinct enough to be easily recog
nized, but Mr. Hummel Is confident his
next machine will bring out the lines
still more sharply and well defined.
But our medical service is thoroughly
up-to-date to meet all these new emer
gencies. There never was such a hos
pital service as that of the United
States, on land, in the field or at sea.
I have had occasion to become very
familiar with the facts regarding this
subject and to know the two gentlemen
who have them in charge for the Gov
ernment. I want to say that it is my
sincere belief that there is not an in
competent medical, man in the service
to-day. Every man selected to fill a
volunteer appointment in the medical
corps has been picked from his fellows
because his training has fitted him for
the position. Do you realize that in
New York city the hospitals receive
every day more men suffering from
wounds than the record shows United
States soldiers have fallen in battle
with the Spaniards? The man who has
had a hospital training in a great city,
if he is bright and capable, is well
fitted for a medical position in the
army or navy.
In addition to all this is the aid and
comfort the Red Cross Society will give
to the wounded. The moment a man is
wounded he becomes a neutral, a non
combatant He is out of the fight, and
in accordance with the international
agreement to the results of the Geneva
ONE of the most novel bridges In all the world has just been finished at
Bizert, in Tunis.
The requirements of a bridge at this point are similar to those ex
isting in many parts of the United States. A narrow river cuts through
a part of the town. Traffic from side to side is quite heavy and large
Bhips are constantly passing up and down the river.
In a way this problem could be solved with a drawbridge, but this pos
sesses many disadvantages too apparent to anybody who has ever stood half
an hour waiting for one of the things to swing around.
The French engineers were equal to the emergency at Bizert and solved
It in the most unique manner. At present the new bridge is answering all
requirements and there is practically no delay for either foot passengers,
horses or ships.
On either side of the river towers as hlsrh as the masts of the largest ship
have been erected. Between the two towers at the top there is a strong,
level roadway with tracks. So arranged as to ride under the rails is a heavy
truck. Between the truck and the surface of the water is a distance of nearly
150 feet
Suspended by cables from this truck so as to be on a level with the
street below is a qtfr capable of carrying a number of passengers and half a
dozen vehicles. A cable operated by an engine on shore hauls the truck
and suspended car fro; . one side of the river to the other.
It takes very little more than a minute for it to cross, and there is
only a moment s waiting at either side. When a ship is passing it is ex
pected that she will steer so as to avoid the car. In this way there is no de
lay, and thousands of people can be carried in an hour. This bridge has
the additional advantage of being picturesque, even though it is con
structed entirely of iron.

longs would have given him.
The surgeon aboard the hospital ship
Solace, the most splendid aid to the
sick and wounded ever afloat, wrote
me the other day that they expected
an engagement soon, and when that
happened and the wounded came
aboard he would send me a detailed ac
count of the injuries inflicted by the
modern bullets and projectiles. That
is a subject of the deepest interest. It
is just that study that will make the
medical man more of an aid to his sol
diers, and yet God help the soldiers
who are waiting for those wounds.
Waiting for them, I say, just as a man
unconsciously waits for death. Wait
ing for sorrow and suffering, martyrÃ
to the cause of their fellow men. The
whole medical world is awaiting the
report of the result of those wounds
yet to be inflicted.
THE SUEZ CANAL.
THE recent troubles which Admiral
Camara experienced with his fleet
upon entering the Suez canal
have made this waterway a point
of special interest in the eyes of
the world. The canal was first opened
In 1869. It saves the trip around the
Cape of Good Hope and reduces the
sailing distance therefore about 4100
miles. The canal is eighty-seven miles
in length. Port Said Is at the eastern
end, on the Mediterranean, and Suez
is the southern terminus, on the Red
Sea, There are no locks in the canal;
It is lighted throughout by electricity

and can be navigated by vessels draw
ing twenty-six feet of water. Twenty
one miles of the can.il are made up of
small lakes, through which vessels can
pass at a speed of seven or eight knots,
the maximum speed in the canai proper
being limited to six knots.
The tolls are determined by the ton.
For a passenger steamer or war vessel
the rate is about $1 SO per ton and 50
cents for each passenger. Vessels in,
ballast have a reduced rate. Admiral
Camara was required to pay $160,000 as
toll before his vessels were allowed to
enter the canal.
The canal is at all tiroes' neutral and
war vessels of any nation are permit
ted to pass through it, no matter on
what footing the country to which they
belong may be in respect to other na
tions. Great Britain is a large owner
in the Suez canal, having acquired in
1875 all the stock belonging to the Khe
dive of Egyptâ l 77 shares out of 400 â
at a cost of $20,000,000.
Port Said is a town of about 10,000 in
habitants, while Suez, at the other ex
tremity of the canal, contains about
16,000 people.
TO BUSY TO
TAKE MONEY
A lawyer had come all the way from
Califc-rnia to pay a $10,000 legacy over
to Uncle Jerry Hopefield, who had lived
all his life in a little town in Ohio, and
after breakfast two or three of us
were invited to go along and witness
the transfer. When we reached the
house Uncle Jerry was tightening up
the hoops on the rain barrel, while his
wife had gone to see a sick neighbor.
They had been fully identified the day
before as the proper parties, and now
the lawyer said:
"Well, Uncle Jerry, I want to hand
you that money and get a receipt and
be off this morning."
"I'm kinder busy, just now," said the
old man, as he stopped hammering for
a moment.
"Yes, but I have $10,000 here for you.
I don't believe there's a man in the
world who wouldn't stop work long
enough to sign a receipt for such a for
tune."
"Mebbe not, but it looks like rain, and
I want to git this bar'l fixed right
away. Can't you come over in about
an hour?"
"Look here, man, but did you ever
see $10,000 in all your life?" asked the
lawyer, as he opened the satchel and
displayed a big package of" new green
backs.
"No, I never did," replied Uncle Jerry
as he pounded away.
"Did you ever have a thousand dol
lars of your own?"
"Lands, no!" . '
"Never had a hundred all at onco, did
you?"
"Never. Durn that hoop, but it don't
want to go on!"
"I must ask you to get this business
over as soon as possible," continued the
lawyer, as the old man kept at his
work.
"But it's going to rain."
"Yes, but here's your money."
"And I've got to get this bar'l fixed-."
"It won't take over ten minutes to fix
up our business. Run along and fetch
your wife."
"See here," said Uncle Jerry, as he
laid down his hammer and wipea the
back of his neck, "Mariar ha:s gone
over to Blodgett'a to be gone an hour.
Befor? she went she said I* must tinker
up this rain bar'l."
"But can't you stop your tinkering to
handle $10,000 in cold cash!" exc*ainnÂ»d
the lawyer in indignant tone 3.
"Yes, yes, I kin stop work; bit wJiat
about Alariai ?"
"Well, what about her?"
"Why, she'd come home expectln'
this bar'l to be all tinkered up, and if
she found it wasn't, them $10,000
wouldn't hold her no more'n a tow
string would hold a hoss. She'd just

WILL BECOME A
PROFESSIONAL NURSE
Mies May Hoffman Will Go East Shortly to Study in a Hospital.
Where is the man who has the power and
skill
To stem the torrent of a woman's will?
For if she will, she will, you may depend
on't;
And if she won't, she won't; so there's an
end on't.
AGAINST the opposition of her
parents, against the arguments
of her sister, against the Impor
tunities of her admirers, and
against the expostulations of
her friends. May Hoffman, dash-
Ing society girl and ambitious leader
of her set, has turned a deaf ear.
She has determined to become a pro
fessional nurse, and has applied to a
hospital in the East for admittance. She
hao made up her mind Irrevocably to
leave behind her .he gayeties and friv
olties, the pleasures and pastimes of a
society career; to espouse a life of
work, a dreary routine of dull care,
anxiety and drudgery; to exchange the
days gay with tennis and teas, golf and
gossip, lunches and larks, shopping and
social success, for days wherein every
hour holds Its arduous duties and every
lapse of alert attention or the slightest
nagging of energy means a merited rp
buke which must be humbly received.
May Hoffman has been a typical so
ciety girl; tall, of fine physique, hand
some and well groomed, a perfect speci
men of the Gibson American model.
Her boast has been that for every oc
casion she has been perfectly gowned â
not because of the range of her ward
robe, but because of the discrimination
that guided her choice. The right cos
tume for the right hour has been a
matter of study of which the attain
ment has been undisputed. And each
and every gown May Hoffman has
worn with that intangible air known
to some few women who make their
dreÃs a part of themselves, and lend to
the simplest frocks an air of rare dis
tinction. In shirt waist and tailor
skirt she haÃ reigned supreme, and in
a ball ~^wn with frou frous and lluff
she has been inimitable.
Gay, dashing and accomplished, she
is fitted to lead' her coterie of young
frlendÃ. She has bicycled with skill
and daring, golfed among the first girls
at the links, and danced with an ease
and grace that has made her sought
after for a partner. Her manner is a
gift, easy, cordial, and with lust the
proper soupconof srushand enthusiasm.
She is bright and quick, and never at a
loss for the valuable small talk of so
ciety. She has always been as pains
taking wit'n the old as with the young,
and she would leave an admiring cir
cle of friends to cross a room and make
a graceful little speech to some lady,
three times her age, standing alone,
whom she had espied and recognized as
a casual acquaintance.
May Hoffman and her sister Alice are
nieces of the late Judge Ogden Hoff
man, who had many warm friends.
Among them was Charles Mayne, well
known in San Francisco, who, out of
love for the Judge, left each of his
nieces $50,000. The money left to May
Hoffman was in railroad bonds, and the
income therefrom began immediately
and has been a steady one ever since.
The part of Mr. Mayne's estate left to
her sister Alice has been in litigation;
and she has been unable to draw any of
the money left her, so she has never
been independent like her older sister.
She is athletic, fun-loving and popular,
yet society could have understood from
Alice Hoffman a determination to
eschew society and become a profes
sional nurse, for the salary is a good
one, and in her case this might have
been the incentive.
But May Hoffman, with money in
addition to position, youth and good
looks, seems to have no cause for turn
ing her back upon the gay world to
bury herself in a hospital with the sick.
There has been another side to May
Hoffman's character. She has been ac
tively engaged in charitable work for
the past three years, and having money
as well as time and a good heart, she
has been a valuable aid to many a
charitable undertaking. Society said
that charity was a fad with this so
ciety belle; some said her ambition for
leadership and her love of managing 1
had led her into a field where she ruled
by reason of untiring zeal and undis
puted capability, added, of course, to
the all-important factor â money. But
fads are evanescent as a coquette's
caprice, and May Hoffman has not tired
of her benevolent work.
At the Children's Hospital she has
been a constant visitor, and in every
scheme for its advancement and profit
she has been head and foremost. Her
friends question if it Is there she has
imbibed a love of nursing, a desire to
soothe, to comfort and to help; or if,
perchance, the white cap and apron
appeal to her Idea of perfection â or
at least varietyâ in dress; or, if in the
lavish expenditure incidental upon a

mWomen`s Fashions
MEW YORK, July 2?.â Summer
has Its hats no less than win
. ter.
In fact to .speak literally,
3 ii summer hats are greater than
winter ones, much greater in (
] olnt of siae, and ffer exceeding them in |
newest hat of the summer of '98 is j
Laud Muller. which is part hat' and ;
sunbonnet. It is made upon a wire !
with a poke bonnet crown. It is in
truth an imrnwHt,- poke hat with a flaring
front, and a big, round back. It is worn
over the face, which gives it a sun
bonnet took.
To make one of these hats you get a j
wire frame and cover it with mull. Set
un edge of chiffon around the frame so I
that it will fall over the hair, and fastei)
It with large, white ribbon strings. The i
only other decoration needed on your j
Maud Muller hat is a band of ribbon j
which Is tied into double loops and ends,
at the side. Plumes may be set in the i
bund of ribbon bo as to fall far forwuyl.
These pokes come in white straw and |
art- very decorative. They are faced with
rosy silk and bordered with a double chif- i
fon puff. They may be trimmed with 'â 
large bows of ribbon and bunches -of I
flowers and white plumes. A hat like this j
is not worn for warmth, but for decora- i
tlon and as a sunshade. The sunshade {
hat may be a flat hat, of course, but the
poke bonnet is a much more decorative]
tun hat.
The summer toque is to be worn to sum
mer entertainments. Theatricals at tnirh- i
mer resorts and concerts arid other pub
lic affairs call for a hat. and for these i
there comes a straw toque, which this
summer is very pretty.
Many of these toques come in a rough
Straw which requires little trimming.;
Some of them are of white straw with !
trimmings of .green straw. On such a
toque as this the only decoration that is
required Is a handful of stiff plumes sew- |
e<] at one side of the hat and llnlshed with
a knot of veiling. These toques ire very
easily trimmed and many of them an
Worn without trimming of any kind
except a knot of veiling and a twist of tnt
pume material.
It is Questioned whether it is desirable

! to pay a great deal for a summer hat. !
Surnmor straws are so varied and summer
materials are so cheat tnat it seems al
most a pity to exnend {25 upon a single
hat, when for that sum any woman who
Is handy with her fingers can easily get a
dozen hats.
In making her own hats the home mil
liner should be careful to select something
which she can trim. It is a \*>ry good
plan for the observant woman to look at
the shapes that are much worn and to se
lect one which she admires. Then comes
the question of trimming.
Too often the home milliner depends '
upon odds and ends in the house. These
are wrinkled, faded and soiled, and cut
Into inconvenient lengths. Not even a
â  milliner can make anything out of them.
! For home milllnerv purchase new ribbons, j
> new flowers, new feathers and new Un- \
; ings. Do not use anything that is o.d if .
I you want a good effect. The professional i
| milliner may be able to work with odds
and ends, but the amateur requires the
best of goods. Put on your trimming with I
lavish hand and trust to pins as well pa ':
: thread for fastening your trimming. .Mil- '
; liners oftfn employ pins, as will be seen
by ripping a hat apart, and the home mii- !
] Uner can do the same.
One great error in home millinery oc
curs, when there iÂ» an effort to smooth
i the trimming down. If you will notice
I the store hat you will see that irs loops
, stand smartly erect, that Its feathers are
| pointed in an aggressive way. that its v*.-l
'â vet is- put on in grÂ»;it rolls, without any
;â¢ attempt to flatten the rimming (low i.

down upon the hat, and by various Sat
touches gives it the amateur look so
easily detected.

! edges of .ribbon. Rolls of velvet can easily
be made larg<= without using a great deal
of material. A little crinoline should be
used underneath fhe velvet. If chiffon is
I. used, the foundation should be mull. The

, stiffened by it.
Such delightful hood hats are made for
Dice day and evening occasions. These
are veritable red riding hoods and are so

becoming to the face that women who
study their good looks have several of
them.
v The red riding hood hat is one that is
made of any thin material lined wltn a
bright color. A ruffle- or ruching Is j.ut
around. the edge, and there is a little cape
around the neck. The hat Is caoaMe ot a
great variety of treatment and some. tf
the results are truly surprising.
At an open air performance of "Ab You
Like It," at a summer resort recently,
a very pretty woman gowned In gray sat
under a green tree, wearing a hood of
leaf green satin, lined with Drlght cerise
silk. There was a double frill around the
edge of the hood of gray chiffon. The
three colors harmonized delicately and
beautifully and gave a very nice touch
to the costume. Its very decorative In
side lining makes a pretty contrast of
color.
Mats of this kind are also made out of
mull and lawn of all colors. They are
lined with taffeta and are bordered with
a little mull ruffle or a ruffle of silk. The
hood is tied under the chin with a very
bright ribbon.
The woman who is fitting herself out
with summer hats will do well to select
odd ones. That is, hats that are a little
out of the ordinary without being too
conspicuous. In summer, the odd hat is
preferable to the conventional one. Two
or three poke hats, a mull toque and two
straws will carry one fairly well during
the summer season. The toouos can be
used for traveling, the poke hat for
croquet and other lawn games and the
hats for day and evening.
Of course for bicycling and golf there
must be another style of hat, hut for
these there Is nothing equal to the sail
or, which is becoming to all ages and con
ditions of women.
The Bailor hat this year Is trimmed.
Bands of ribbon with quills, sashes with
fringes, veiling with flowers, silk with
bunches of feathers, all are worn on
sailor hats.
A year ago a fashionable woman cre
ated a sensation in society at an after
noon luncheon by announcing that al
though she had fifteen hats that sum
mer, not one of them contained an hi'h
of silk. Bfftln, velvet or straw. They
were entirely of paper. This wa.-i ques
tioned until she had a maid produce from
the cloak room a very natty black tur
ban, trimmed apparently with bards of
silk. On investigation it was found that
the turban was covered with dull black
silk paper, and banded with the same ma
terial. On a wager she produced all her
hats and proved that they were trimmed
In the same way.
In a certain very large city there Is to
day an immense millinery emporium

THE question as to whether or not
soap should be used upon the face
can bring up more opinions than
can the discussion as to whether
Sehley or Sampson deserves the
I credit of >the latest achievement of the

Some one wrote me last week and said
that when she used soap on her face the
skin felt stretched and uncomfortable,
and yet wh'-n she did not use It she could
not make herself believe that her face
I was really clean. One cannot make a
cast-iron rule for all womankind and say,
"Thou shalt not use soap." What Is good
for one complexion is not good for an
other. If you find that soap does not
i agree with your skin shun It as you
! would a poison; if It does agree with It
i then give the face a gentle scrubbing
! every night, being careful to rinse away
i every particle of the soap.

best kind. A large number of toilet soaps

colors, flowered, crinkled and plain. It
Is as tough as r-!lk and much more dur
able than mull or chiffon. You can sprin
kle it and you can let the sun shine upon
it, but it will remain true to color, -which
is a great deal more than can be said of
many summer materials.
These hats are, unfortunately, very ex
pensive, but the woman who is deter
mined to do her own millinery can Kct a

and plain, and experiment with it. Let

find that they wear extremely well. She
can face her hat with the tough Japanese.
variety of paper and can otherwise dec
orate it just about as she pleases. Of
course, with the use of paper the cost of
the hat is extremely small, and she can
have as many as she desires without
spending more than a few dollars.
In purchasing a^ paper hat, however,
any woman will be compelled to pay a
large sum. These are quite expensive.
They are placing so much work upon the
paper flowers and the trimmings that It
becomes necessary to charge well for
them. Besides, they are so beautiful that
they command a high price and readily
obtain it. The advantages of tissue paper
are many, the principal one of which la

It is warranted not to lose its brilliancy.

LATEST
COMBINATION
NOTWITHSTANDING the threat
ened boycott of everything Pari
sian in the way of millinery, dress
making: and the little odds and
ends of feminine attire -which go so far
toward making an entirely complete and
fashionable woman, Paris has sent us an
ultimatum, so far as the ever-useful
sailor hat is concerned, which our girls,
ever wide awake to that which will en
hance their beauty, have received with
distinguished consideration.
To be up to date the girl of the period
must not wear the usual plain, severe,
coarse or fine straw sailor, so closely
copying that of her brothers or husband,
but must add a little finishing touch of
femininity to It, which Is certainly very
charming and extremely becoming to
nearly every style of face. It is an ac
knowledged fact that nearly every wom
an looks well in a sailor, and if the plain
ribbon banded straw Is so fetching how
much more attractive will be the latest
style sent to us by our French sisters?
The new sailor is more stylish and up
to date when made of a fine French chip
straw. The crown Is a little higher than
the ordinary mannish hat of coarse,
rough straw, and the brim a little broad
er in front than at the back. Boulllon
nes of chiffon or silk surround the crown,
either of white, veiled with figured black
lace, or all of white, with chenille dotted
net covering the soft, fluffy chiffon or
silk roll.
Then there are large double Mercury
wingF spread across the front of the hat,
finished with a "choux," as it is called,
of soft chiffon or silk. This trimming
may be varied to suit the face the hat
is intended to set off by being placed at
the side. But the full white Mercury
wings are an indispensable part of a chic
sailor for this season.
The back of the hat Is filled In with
soft choux of white chiffon or roses,
which is a matter of taste: but to be al
together in the style the back is better
left untrimmed. Another favorite method
of transforming the mannish sailor into
a womanly one Is to trim it with one of
the long, soft Roman scarfs so fashion
able at present and to form full knots of
the soft Italian silk at the side, from
which In coquettish tills will protrude the
Inevitable white Mercury wings. These
wings must be on the hat or the style is
gone.
It Is not alone sufficient to have your
sailor hat. but the girl who adopts this
pretty mode must also adopt the new
white and pink round veils which go with
it These veils are but one of the many
revivals of which mis spring and sum
mer have been so prolific. Nearly every
rirl can go through her mother's, nay,
perhaps her grandmother's, box of laces
and mid the fac-simlle of the newest '98
Straight across the top, It Is finished I
with a beading through which elastic in
narrow ribbon is run, by which it can be I
gathered around the crown of the hat. Its
bottom is circular shaped, so that when
it is In It falls below the chin in front and
slopes up even with the hat brim in the
back. It has a handsomeh' designed bor
der, sometimes in black applique on the ,
white net. but thip latter is rather outre i
and too pronounced for the ultra refined I
woman.
A still more startling novelty, which Is
designed for wear with the sailors
trimmed with Roman scarfs, Is the veil j
of pink tulle with large, medium sized !
and Email white chenille dots. This pink
veil Is certainly a great beauty enhancer, ;
but one which 1 doubt will have a long !
life.
Now, to be complete In all the glory of I
her summer paraphernalia, the '98 girl '
fected by exposure to wind and cold.
Do not use a colored soap. Many of the
highly scented and colored toilet soaps
contain a considerable amount of lime,
chalk or gypsum and owe their attractive
tints to noxious mineral matters.
I hate to recommend anything Spanish,
but the real imported castile soap which
Is made of olive oil and soda is all right.
However, the problem is best solved by
manufacturing your own toilet Boaps.
and this Is not difficult to do. Here is the
formula for a soap which is particularly
nice for the hands on account of the oils
which it contains. It is called:
JUNIATA TOILET SOAP.
To one good-sized bar of caÃtlle
soap add sufficient water to dis
solve It thoroughly. Stir in one
tablespoonful of bicarbonate of
soda. Let boll. Remove from fire
and stir In one tablespoonful of
each of the following oils (mixed):
Cocoanut, sweet almond and olive.
Add one tablespoonful of mixture
of equal parts of spirits of cam
phor, nitre, and ammonia and stir
slightly. Put in molds and let
. Btand for some time before using.
If a scented soap is preferred, here is
one with a frngrance as of wood violets
straight from the meadows:
White castile soap, 8 ounces.
Honey, 1 ounce.
Spermaceti. 1 ounfe.
Oil' of sweet almonds, 1% ounces.
v\ hlte wax, 1 ounce.
Essence of violets, ounce.
Shave the cas..ie soap very fine. Put
the honey in a double boiler and when
hot add the soap. In another double
boner put the oil of almonds and the
spermaceti and the wax, which have been
grated fine. When the soap is entirely
must have a touch of the "millngtary" In
her make u*\ and this has been furnished
in the new umbrella handles. As all
Americans are war crazy, the fashions,
of course, must follow the trend of the
public mind. With this idea in view the
fad of the hour is a sun umbrella with a
gilded sword handle. It matters little to
the swell jrlrl that these umbrellas are
hard to carry, and with the present style
of full skirts, which must be neld up with
both hands, almost an impoFsibilitv to
hold open, still, all tnie must be put to
one side, and a sword handle she must
have to her sunshade.
These sword handles are not confined to
the plain silk sun umbrella, but extend to
the thousand and one pretty conceits of
the hour, which are most elaborate pro
ductions of tucks, hemstitching, ruch
ings, plaitinps and insertions of lace,
Swiss muslin, mullo, nonpee. foulard and
every conceivable material on the market
to-day.

melted pour the oils and the soap to
gether. Sometimes it may be necessary
to add a little hot water to the honey
and soap, but be very sparing of it, lest
you weaKen your soap, so that it will not
harden. Two tablespoonfuls, at most. Is
quite enough. After the oils and the soap
have been in the hot water bath, which
should be kept boiling briskly, for ten or
fifteen minutes, remove from the fire, add
the essence of violets, stir and then pour
into teacups, if you do not happen to
have any molds handy.
Soap, likÂ« wine, improves with age, so
the longer this Is kept before using the
better it will be.
This is a bit more troublesome to make
than the first recipe given, but, if direc
tions are carefully followed, should come
out all right.
A liquid soap, which' is much easier to
compound than either of the other two,
which is particularly good for doing away
with blackheads and also makes a de
lightful shampoo, is maSe after the fol
lowing fashion:
Cut In very small shavings one-half
pound of pure imported castile soap.
Place in a porcelain vessel with two
quarts of boiling water. Let it simmer
until every particle of the soap is dis
solved. Wheji cold it should be of the
consistency of rather thin cream, and if
thicker add more warm water. Stir In
one-fourth pint of alcohol and then let
stand several days in fl wiirm room. All
the alkali and impurities wilt settle to
the bottom and the liquid will be as clear
as crystal. Pour off very carefully, leav
ing the residue for kitchen purposes. Add
one-fourth ounce espenoe of verbena.
Pour a little of it in the water before
bathing. I am sure you will find it de
lljfhtful.

I wish that my- readers, after experi
menting with any of the recipes that I
give them, would write to me and let
me know how successful they havi; been.
In the case of failure, I may be able to
point out where the error was, or per

seems hopeless.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
GEORGTANA â Blackheads are very
hard to get rid of. Buy a camel's hair
fuce brush and scrub the face with L^fcd
water and pure castile soap every nife^.
Or, you might use the liquid soap that J
have given the formula for In my tal^
to-day. Be sure to rinse away all the
soap. Then dry and apply a cold
I cream, rubbing it into the pores until it
is all absorbed. The next morning: bathe
the face in clear tepid water. Squeezing 1
out the blackheads in a great mistake. It
irritates them and increases them in
â number and. size. Take a daily sponge
bath, one or two hot baths a week, plenty
of exercise, and avoid rich, greasy foods,
and I feel sure the blackheads will dis
appear. If they do not, then let me know
and I will give you a recipe for a lotion
to use in connection with the scrubbing.
Lemon juice ie the simplest thing to use
on the face for the removal of Freckles.
Dilute it with rose water, and when going
out protect the face against wind and sun
by wearing a chiffon veil. This is also
Rood for tan. For the wrinkles massage
thoroughly each night with a good skin
food, such as I gave formula for on wrin
kles in The Sunday Call of July 10.
MONA L. â For excessive perspiration
wash the parts affected with boracic acid,
diluted in the proportion of one part or
the acid to twenty py.rts of hot water.
Then dust with this powder: Salicylic
acid, three parts; talc, seven parts;
starch, ninety parts.
OLIVETTEâ For the discolora'Jon and
swellings under the eyes try bathing
them with witch hazel and camphor wa
ter in equal proportions.
THELMA-I am always so sorry when
any one asks me for something to prevent
the white hairs from coming, for, to my
mind, there is nothing more lovely than
white hair. It softens the lines of the
1 face, lends dignity to it and altogether
gives it a chastened appearance. How
ever, we do not all think alike. When
hair begins to turn white it indicates a
failure of iron in the system, and a good
plan is to take a good iron tonic pre
scribed by a physician. Do not use any
of the so-called "restoratives." Most of
them are poisonous and dangerous or else
color the scalp and give the head a most
uncleanly appearance. There is a tonic
of claret and sulphate of iron which has
a slight coloring effect. The proportions
are: One gram sulphate of iron to sixty
grams genuine claret. Boil for one min
ute, and when cold bottle and cork. Wash
j the hair with this twice a week, allowing
ilt to dry on. This strengthens and invig
orates the hair bulbs and thus brings
back the natural tints. If you will apply
rose water or a very little bit of cold
cream before powdering you will find
the powder will go on more smoothly.
EVAâ A good white face powder Is
made by sifting over and over again one
ounce of the finest rice powder with threÂ«
ounces of pure oxide of zinc and adding
three drops of oil of roses. A dry rouge
is thus prepared: Carmine, half A
dram; oil of almonds, one dram;
French chalk, two ounces. Mix. If you
prefer a liquid rouge, or a grease, write
to me again, and I will give you a for
mula.
MARGARETâ Here is the formula for
I a hair tonic. Cologne, eight ounces; tine
' ture of cantharides. one ounce; oil of
I English lavender, oil of rosemary, one
half dram each. Apply to the roots
of the hair once or twice a day. It Is
positively necessary that the scalp should
be kept clean. For freckles of the "all
year round kind,"' the only sure way of
getting rid of them Is to wear a mask
made of beautifying paste, until they fadÂ»
out. A paste 1b easily made by mixing
three ounces of ground barley (or fresh
rye meal) with one ounce of honey and
the white of an egg. Use at night and
wash off in the morning. Wear during
the day as much as possible. After this
treatment you will have to take great
'.â¢are when going out to protect the face
with a veil or parasol.
H. H. H.â l have seen in the East a
patent contrivance of some sort, which,
placed over the mouth at night, forces
one to breathe through the nose, and so
does away with the snoring. Whether or
not the article can be found here I do
not know.
I have never known of any such opera
tion as you mention. Such a one, I should
think, would be largely in the nature of
an experiment, and I fear could not be
undergone without taking grave chances.

HOW TO BUY
EASTERN RUGS
SINCE Oriental rugs have become so
much sought after by the follow^
ers of fashion countless frauds
and Impositions are being prac
ticed. Here are a few pointers as
offsets furnished by a professional buyer
of rugs from the East.
Some dealers will always assure you
with passionate earnestness that the rugs
are either Persian or Turkish. You must
not believe a word they say, for somo
Mussulmen have been raised in the be
lief that to get the better of a Christian
is a saving grace. As the size of Persian
and Turkish rugs rarely exceed eight ana
I a half by six and a half feet, about a
I per cent of all the rugs made are larger
but they have been made to order, and
only about 1 per cent of the 5 per cent
ever come to America.
The Oriental worker makes the rugs to
fill the use of chairs and they are plleu
in heaps in his narrow hut or house.
Only the long narrow carpets which wo
covet for our halls and stairs are in
tended by him to be used under foot.
These floor strips are never more than
sixteen feet, and are usually thirteen by
three feet.
In this country, and in San Franciscu
In particular, a great many large rugs aru
being sold as Dagastan, Goulistan, etc.,
some of them running as high as twelve
by twenty-four feet. They are made in
large barbaric patterns, with great wealth
of color and are very loosely woven.
They are genuine Oriental rugs, but not
Persian or Turkish. They are made in
four prisons of India, where the British
Government employs the native convicts
in the making of these rugs for the Eu
ropean and American markets.
As a number of men are employed on
one rug the pattern must be given them
by the English overseer, as the convicts
do not belong to the rug mailing class.
Hence the patterns are such as a long
headed Englishman would select.
In the Persian and Turkish huts the
whole family will work on a rug, whose
pattern is evolred with the rug.
The prison-made rugs are made of in
ferior wool, as the Government buys only
the short staple, while the Oriental usea
the rongest and finest wool obtainable.
The prison rugs are dyed wfth analine
dyes, while In the old Oriental families
the secret of the vegetable dyes has
been guarded for centuries and handed
down from generation to generation.
The British Government has found tn!Â»
industry profitable and it has grown to
such an extent that'they have more
orders than they can fill. As a conse
quence they are constantly improving the
rugs which, while beautiful and genuine,
are not what they are represented to be
when sold in this country. The analina
dyes fade, which often softens and im
proves the rug, where It does not fade
unevenly, as is very often the case.
A simple test for analine which any
one can apply at a moment's notice is
to moi-sten a white handkerchief and rub
the suspected rug vigorously. If any of
i the color comes off it is analine dye.
It must be borne in mind that owinÂ»
| to the difficulty the peasants have in ob
; talning some of the vegetable dyes, they
will sometimes substitute one color, par
ticularly sapphire, in analine. An abso
i lutely infallible test for analine dye Is to
j test the rug with a match. Pull out a
I thread and burn with a match, letting the
| ash fall on the rug. It will leave a yel
low smudge. If the thread was dyed with
vegetable dyes you can easily 'rub the
: smudge off with a handkerchief; if dyed
I with analine the smudge cannot be rub
bed off.
As to patterns, the genuine rug may
have occasionally European designs. The
i French have serit to the Persian families
! designs to be made up, and these rugs are
j sometimes offered for fale>*ere.
I An American had for sale in San Fran-
I Cisco three of the most beautiful rugs,
I which he said had been ordered by the
i French Embassador.
The background was blue in one, red
in the other and white in the third. Each
j had for the center the French flag,
j crossed by the Persian. The rugf were
made of camel's hair and* silk, and were
I valued at $700 for the three.
Most of the Eastern rugs are made by
Mohammedans, and as the Koran forbids
! the representation of any living thing,
when the pattern contains the likeness
more or less crude of an animal, usually
a horse, sometimes a camel, the ru~ was
probably made by a Nestorian Christian
j in Asia Minor, or in Anatolia, by a Greek
Christian family.
These Anatolian rugs being made of
i very long, staple wool, are exceedingly
I beautiful, and are more artistic in color
i Ing and in pattern than In Persia, wher#
! rug making has become an established
! industry.
The Anatolian agrees with EugenÂ»
j Field, thinking that any color. ?o long at
; It is red. is the color that suits him best*
and the prevailing color of all Anatolian
rugs is a rich pigeon blood red. ThÂ«
, Christian made rugs often have a cross
I In the pattern.
The Bokara rug, so much prized by col
lectors, has always for a pattern a very
conventionalized pomgranite about Ixl^4
i inches,' being nearly circular, usually on
! a rich dark red background.
The Tlflis hnll carpets used by us a*
stair carpets have also frequently a con*
and the pomgranate Is much largerâ thaV
but the rug Is not so closely woven as a
Bokara, the coloring is totally different
j and the pomgranite is much largorâ that
is, about 2V> inches in diameter, and is
rather PTuare than round.
One nt The best weaves of the Persian
! rugs is the Sherez, but a word of warn
ing concerning these rugs. At Sherez, a
i town in Persia, factories nave b^r*n started
! where they turn out large numbers of tho
rugs, very beautiful, but all colored with
the analine dyes, ana sure to fade, and to
fade unevenly.
The genuine old Sherez Is usually of a
very simple pattern, consisting of verti
cal or diagonal stripes surrounded by a
greater or smaller number of borders. As
I a rule the greater number of borders in
I this rug the greater the value.

MRS. ANNE THACKERAY RIT
CHIE has just brought out the
fourth volume of the Biographi
cal Edition of her father's works.
This volume comprises "Barry
Lyndon." which, in a sort, is his master
piece, coming next in the same sort to
Fielding's "Jonathan Wild," on which it
is remodeled as the greatest tour de force
In the English language; "Catherine," a
grew Â»ome bit of anti-realistic realism:
"The Fatal Boots" and other sketches of
the same period.
Tho introduction to this volume con
tains more Interesting personalia, the
greater part of which is new. Even the
old story which Is includedâ the one re
lating to that egregious young Irishman,
Briffgs, who wished to thrash the novel
ist :.:i<l for that purpose took a room
across the wayâ ls elucidated a little
further than in the earlier version. The
Catherine Hayes of "Catherine" was a
real person, and a well-known Irish mur
deress. When Thackeray's story ap
peared many Impressionable Irishmen
suspected that it "was a deliberate at
tempt to ruin Miss Catherine Hayes," a
singer popular in Ireland. Brlggs, It
seems, brooded over the supposed wrong,
and It was his loyalty to the fame of the
singer that drove him to contemplate
reprisals upon Thackeray.
When Thackeray__jÂ«v?te "The Great
Hoggarty Diamond"," It was rejected by
the Blackwoods. "They refused the best
story I ever wrote." he afterward said.
The note is authoritative, but there be
come who would prefer to regard "Barry
Lyndon" as his most brilliant work, and
it Is surprising to learn from the quota
tions which Mrs. Ritchie gives from her
father's diary that he wrote the book
with difficulty, and was not, on the whole.

THE BOOK OF THE WEEK
much pleased with It "You needn't read
'Barry Lyndon,' you won't like it," he
said to his daughter when she was a
girl. She adds, sagaciously, "indeed It is
scarcely a book to like," but the.n f v â¢â¢.
giKÂ»s on to describe it as a book "*.' ad
mire and to wonder at for its consum
mate power and mastery." The words ex
actly characterize this masterpiece.
Thackeray never produced a more homo
geneous, more closely knit bonk than
"Barry Lyndon." The vitality of the
work Is tremendous, never slackening,
but preserving flawlessly all the airs
and colors of actual life. Yet Thackeray
wrote of it as follows: "In these days
got through the fag end of chapter IV
of 'Barry Lyndon' with a great deal of
dullness, unwillingness and labour. â¢ â¦
â¢ Passed the whole of these days â¢ â¢ â¢
reading for 'Barry Lyndon," and writing,
with extreme difficulty, a sheet. â¢ â¢ â¢
At home all day drawing and dawdling
with 'B. L.' lying like a nightmare on
my mind. â¢ â¢ â¢ Wrote 'Barry' but
slowly and with great difficulty. â¢ â¢ â¢
Finished 'Barry' after great throes late
at night." Thackeray went traveling
with the book "hanging round his neck,"
yet It remains one of the most spontane
ous things in English literature, a book
without the smallest trace of effort. Mrs.
Ritchie notes, by the way, that the story
of Barry Lyndon's marriage was evident
ly taken from more or less historical
sources, "The Family of Bowes" dates
from the Conquest, and we read that one
of the ladies Strathmore was the sole
heiress of this wealthy line. She was
left a widow before she was 30. and had
many suitors, for she was charming as
well "as rich. This unfortunate lady was
bullied Into a marriage with a brutal ad
venturer, from whom she finally escaped
by flight, barely saving her life. The
story of her eldest son. who disappeared,
and only camo back after many years, is
iot less true. My father had a friend at
Paris In those days, a Mr. Bowes, who
dress on the order, and Santa Cruz Lodge
in particular, showing Its remarkable
growth through the efforts of its officers.
He followed r>y presenting to the new
deputy a beautiful badge, expressive of
the members' appreciation of his work.

TOE .MEMOIRS OF BJIRRY LY.NDO.N. ESQ.
Written by Himself; The Fitzboodle Papers; Catherine, A Story; Men's Wives, Etc.
BY WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.
may -have' first told him this history, of
which the details are almost incredible,
as quoted from the papers of the time."
Among her reminiscences of this period
Mrs. Ritchie has a vague vision < of iier
godmother,' Mrs. Sterling, the wife of the
famous John Sterling of the Times; Jiving
her a pair of red shuts: "I sat on. the
floor and gazed at them in admiration.
This taste may have been Inherited, for
there was a story my father used to '.ell
us of his own early youth and of nls.nas>
slonate longing for a pair : of Hessian
boots, which he ordered home, and which
were sternly sent back to the shop, as un
befitting a schoolboy. It was a dreadful
moment, and one which he said ne could
never forget. Does any one over forget
these early mortifications?
"Boots must have been of much nir>>Â©
vital Importance in the beginning of the
century than they are now. 1 see in a note
to 'The Life of Cardinal Manning,' who
was four years older than my father, that
at Harrow Mr. George Richmond de
scribes Manning an 'a buck of the first
water.' and says that among other adorn
ments he sported Hessian boots with tas
sels.
"The history of 'Stubbs and the Fatal
Boots' may have had some .ink with those
Hessians *of my father's dreams. The
story wat; written in tne year 1839, and
was published in Cruikshank's Comic An
nual for IS4O.
" 'Catherine was also written in 1839.
The story appeared in Frazer's Magazine. \
'It was written in Imitation of the bom
bastic fictions of the day,' says a/later
editor."
A taste for highwaymen was the fash
ion then. just as a taste for the new, wo
man and neurotics has been popular of
late. The story of the wicked Catherine
is one of the grimmest of all Thackeray' 3
stories, but he still, perhaps, retained the
prejudice that crime is grim. .
The story made its mark. "The judges
stnnd up for me," writes Thackeray to his
mother "Carlyle says it is wonderful,
and many more laud It highly, but it Is a
disgusting subject and no mistake. I
wish I had taken a pleasanter one."
In another letter he returns to the sub
ject: "It Is very Ingenious In you to find
beauties In 'Catherine,' which was a mis
take all through. It was not made dis
gusting enoughâ that was the fact, and
the triumph of it would have been to
make readers so horribly horrified as to
cause them to give up or rather throw up
the book and all its kind; whereas you see
the author had a sneaking kindness for ,
his heroine, and did not like to make her
quite worthless." â 
There is a pleasant picture of Thack
eray at work, with his wife and daugta

had assembled to witness the ceremony,

installing officer, Mrs. Emma Thierbach,

trella Parlor, is one of those retiring
Native Daughters who Is possessed of ex
traordinary ability, but who has allowed
her talent to remain dormant. Her de
livery of the memorized work without
book was with a naturalness and lm
pressiveness that wan exceedingly pleas-
Ing, and It created a most favorable Im
pression, not only on the onlookers, but
on the officers before her, several of them
having been installed on previous occa
sions. The ceremony of this order when

CHOPPERS' FRIENDSHIP CLUB
Lest Monday â¢ night the Cnoppers*
Friendship Club, organized as an auxil
iary of the parent order to care for those
of Its members who may be taken sick,
gave an entertainment In the camp of
Golden Gate No. 64 in the presence of a

time 1 can remember my parents," says
IVirs. Ritchie, "was at home in Great
Coram street, on one occasion, when my
mother took me upon her back, as she
had a way of doing, and. after hesitating
for a moment at the door, carried me
into a little ground floor room, where
some one sat bending over a desk. This
some one lifted up his head and looked
round at the people leaning over his
chair. He seenied pleased, smiled at uf,

picking up his little daughter from the
midst of her dancing with other children
before the organ of an Itinerant grinder;
and once, too, on the way to Pnris, when
the child Insisted upon crying after he
had warned her that she would be pun
ished if she kept it up, he put out their
lantern and refused to light It In spite
of her tears. They are all trivial de
tails, but they appeal to the lover of

A new book of poems by Bliss Carman
Is a literary event which appeals not
only to the love of beauty, but the love
of novelty as well. Each of his poems is
pitched In a key of its own, and its har
monies are as sure to please as its mo
tils are to surprise. The most conspicu
ous and attractive characteristic of Bliss
Carman's verse is his disregard of hack
neyed conventionality, combined with
vitality and ability to construct lines
metrically flawless, thereby possessing
the rare attribute of reaching the hearts
of the most prosaic readers. Those who

MARVELOUS ELECTRIC LIGHT EFFECTS.
THE SHARP BROTHERS IN THEIR NEW ELECTRIC FIRE ACT.
After seven years of almost constant work Frank H. Sharp .and his
brother, W. E. Sharp, have produced some wonderful effects in what they
call an "electric fire" act. They have not yet made their appearance be
fore the public, but are almost ready to do so. At present they are prac
ticing in a deep cellar on the corner o' Third and Howard streets.
And what a wonderful place this cellar is during rehearsals.
Before they begin the large cavern is in semi-darkness. The whiz
zing of some sort of electric machine can be heard in the distance.
Dressed In the classic costumes that are supposed to be worn by the In
habitants of the infernal region, the two brothers suddenly step from be
hind two tall stands and advance a few steps. Each, carries a queer look
ing lamp that shows not the faintest sign of light. But the moment each
touches his lamp to the other's both suddenly burst into flame.
Then commence all sorts of queer demoniacal goings on. Wherever the
finger of one touches the body of the other there is a pyrotechnic display.
In an innocent manner one touches the lips of the other. In an in
stant a wave of flame rolls out of his mouth and roars wildly. There are
dozens of other tricks of equal strangeness, and it would seem as if the
demon of fire lurked somewhere In the depths of the cellar, ready at a mo
ment's notice to change the air into flame. Fire seems to come out of
the darkness at will. One moment there is nothing but an Inky vault
with two figures moving mysteriously about. In an Instant thÂ«re is fire
everywhere and the strange thing is the actors do not get burned.
About the prettiest and weirdest act these two young men produce is
causing the glow of a vacuum tube merely by contact with one another's
body. When one of these tubes is held by the end in the hand of one of
the boys it Is an ordinary looking glass tube. But let the other touch It
and at once it seems to spring into life. From one end to the other is
an iridescent glow, beautiful to behold. The instant one lets go all Is
darkness.

A ROMANCE OF SUMMER SEA&-By
\ anna Anne Jefferson Davis, is a love
st>>ry, told by an American traveler in the
smoking room of a country Mouse. The
scene of the tale changes from the P. and
O. steamer Sultana, in Eastern waters, to
Hongkong and Yokohama. The gossips
of the Sultana's deck couple unpleasantly
the names of Malcolm Ralstone and Mi
nerva Primrose, who come aboard the
ship at Penang. Ralstone is a young
Englishman who has charitably consent
ed to act as traveling companion for Miss
Primrose, being an old and intimate
friend of the girls father and herself.
Upon this unconventional association the
worst possible construction is placed by
niost of the other passengers, and espe
cially by Colonel Goodloe F. Guthrie, a
rough American diamond from the great
West. Owing to the malicious machina
tions of a certain Chubbs, a quarrel con
cerning the honor of the heroine is precip
itated between Guthrie and Ralstone,
which results in a challenge for a duel.
At Hongkong, however, Ralstone is
strlokf-n with fever and the duel is pre
vented. Chubbs. however, acting as
Guthrie's second, posts Ralstone as a
coward in the Travelers' Club. Bush, the
American globe-trotter, who tells the
story, succeeds in provoking guthrie to a
duel in Yokohama, thus preventing the
necessity of Ralstone fighting him, ihe
hefo having by this time become duly be
trothed to the girlish heroine. Chubbs

that they have been succeeded by their

6f many of the great artists there is
not only no one to Bucceed them, but
few whose work gives evidence of the
. of the special qualities that
even promise greatness.
It may be that the creation of these
Th>-.spian geniuses is governed by the
law of cycles, .as it appears to be in
that of tlit.- masters of literature, music
and painting; and if one indulges in
retrospection such a theory can well be
entertained.
Take, for instance, the magnificent
perfection of the genius of the elder
Booth. Can there be found among
the whole Anglo-Saxon race one
upon whose Bhouldera his splen

In reply to the foregoing it might, |
with Â«ortip degree of reason be said, I
that amusement seekers of to-day have
developed a new, a degenerated taste I
that does not demand the high stand- I
ard of the past, either as to plays or
players; that from a Booth, a Slddons,
a Xielson they have descended to the
point where they are content with what
they receive from such artists, say, as
De Wolf Hopper, Francis Wilson. Ada
Rehan and Lillian RttpseU; that the
great tragedies and comedies, the stir
ring, thunderous melodramas have per
force given way to the roaring horse
play farce, the frothy society drama,
strung on a string made of up-to-date
love-making, and usually the peccadil
1 lues of a woman of jelly-!ish composi
tion; the spectacular machine play,
hybrid drama and vaudeville.
To a considerable extent this is true
and the logical quiries arise: What are
you going to do about it? What will
come next with the opening of the new
century? Will it bring us an era of
great authors and master minds with
the genius to interpret their works, or
will the play-worid wag along on the
down grade at the pace it has been
pursuing of late years?
Let us abide in the hope that the al
ternative will not be realized.

The Columbia.
One half of the present season of the
Frawley company at the Columbia
Theater has expired, and they have been
seen in a variety of plays in which the
' abilities of the members have been dis
â¢ played. Their success has been quite in
! keeping with the merits of the organlza
i tion Mr. Frawley selected largely for
fcan Francisco's edification. Under the
lest of comparison It is not as capable as
its predecessor, for it does not contain
the equals of a Blanche Bates, a Gladys
Wallace or a Worthing, for the simple
reason that there are not enough of such
I to (fo around, but, notwithstanding the
i handicap of a comparison, the company
i has won a commendable position in the
I estimation of the theater-goers of this
| city. Of the leading people who have
i met with special lavor are Theodore
l Roberts, Edward M. Bell, Sam Edwards.
I Eleanor Carey, Madeleine Boutin and
; Cora Tinnie. Roberts iias maue hlnuteli
i a general lavorite by his excellent work
| in such widely different roles as the pugi-
I list in "Number y," Stockton in "Aris
tocracy," the Indian in "r'ort Frayne."
Old Todma.ii in "Liberty Hall." In the
. latter he proved himself the possessor of
| exceptional talent.
The bill for next week by the Frawley
company will be "The Masked Ball," in
which John Drew and Maud Adams had
such remarkable success. The play, which
is a translation from the French of Bis
son and Cane, had a run of 300 nights ia
New York, and met with proportionate
success in all parts of the country, in
cluding thin city. The plot turns on the
treachery of a suitor in sending his rival
to foreign lands by means of a false let
ter and thus clearing the field for his suc
cessful wooing. The fraud is discovered
too late when the yoving wife and the
former suitor meet at tfie French ball.

amusing.

for a very elaborate staging and Frawley
promises to go to extremes in that direc

that reiteration Is unnecessary. "Riche
lieu" affords a vast amount of material
both in scenes and action. It reviews the
life of one of the greatest statesmen that
ever voiced the policy of France. The plot
takes up his life in his junior days and
closes It just prior to his demise. The ac
tion is confined within the years that his
administration dictated the policy of the
crown and thwarted the arrogant attltu-it
of the nobility that had through feudal
privileges overridden the ruler.
"Camille," Mathilda Heron's French
adaptation, is a play dramatized from
true life. It wat rounded upon facts fa
miliar to even.- one. It illustrates what
power the magnetism of a handsome wo
man has and how base becomes its ef
fects when exercised for evil purpose's.
Both bills will receive a gorgeous
mounting and the casts which have been
judiciously made present a good and
"forcible company.

the Grand Opera-house with the piercing
tones of the pibroch, the drone of the
bag-pipes, the clash of arms and the tur
moil of battle during next week. This
will be its first production here, after a
good reception in the East. The plot deals
with a feud between .two clans In which
there are equal parts of love, courage,
deceit, war and reconciliation, through
which the villain receives his just reward
in common with the distracted lovers.
The play is a picture of Scotch life in the
olden times and is said to possess special
attractions by reason of the beautiful
stage settings,' the odd costumes and the
strange customs shown. The fourth act
Is particularly exciting, portraying, a
desperate combat between the fierce clans
which ends, of course, in victory for the
right.
The situations are said to be highly
dramatic, the action rapid and the Scotch
accent comprehensive.- Mr. Hrophy has
a fine role, which should show him to ad
vantage. His present engagement will
end in two weeks.
Jhe Orpheum.
For the week opening to-morrow night
the Orpheum announces an exceptionally
attractive bill; the new people include
James Thornton, the well-known song
writer, author of "My Sweetheart's the !
Man in the Moon." Among the new
songs he will introduce this week Is his
latest, "When You're In Love," which
has been very successful. For a novelty
act Valoon and Anthelmine have been
imported from Paris. They are said to
be very clever in thetr line, which is
songs and dances of the "Gay Paree"
order. Joseph Hart and Carrie de Mar
have a number of new specialties to pre
sent in their clever comedy sketch, "Dr.
Chauncey's Visit." This versatile couple
have scored a great hit. The Macarte
Bisters have some additional feats on the
high wire, and Valmore, "the Instrumen
tal Man," .has new imitations to offer.
Tlie Angela Sisters will appear in a
budget of new songs. W. H. Windom
an-d the Blackstone Quartet havo now
selections for public favor. Gilbert and
Goldie will put on a new act which is
said to be quite as clever as the one which
won so much praise on their opening.
Wilton and Stack, the horizontal bar ar
tists -are still a feature. The bill with
so many clever acts will no doubt servo
to pack the house to its utmost capacity.

Cora Tinnie, the bright and popular
noubreUe of the Frawley Company, does
not, when on the stage, show any indi
cation of the fact that a giggle from the
aedience released at an inopportune mo
ment would drive her to grief and tears,
but such is the case.
Her first appearance here was in the
curtain-raiser, "Po* White Trash." her
role being that of the daughter of a
wealthy planter. The little lady had
one good line in the part and naturally
supposed she was prepared to deliver it
properly, but she nad not gauged the
acoustic properties of the theater, and
the result was on the order of a nervous
schoolmiss "saying her flrst piece." The
audience could not refrain from snicker
ing, notwithstanding the scene was a
really pathetic one.
Miss Tlnnie was almost heartbroken,
and the flowers that came to her only
made the sorrow worse. ~.-e stormed up
and down behind tne drops wringing her
hands and crying as though there was
no balm in Gilead. The little lady could
not be comforted, and finally was es
corted home, sobbing like a child, her
face buried in the armful of flowers she
carried.
On her subsequent appearance she was
received very cordially, and now thinks
that the much dreaded and critical San
Francisco audience is not such a dread
ful combination after all that ia said
of it.
SLAVED JAVARY'S FACE.
The Red-Whiskered Jer\or Who
Wanted His Picture printed.
Contrary to tradition there is once in a
decade or longer -a. good story connected
with the stage that does not find its way
Into print through the efforts of the hard
worked press agent. The present narra
tive is "wan ay thlm," and shows to what
lengths a man's personal vanity will carry
him; how the cultivation of the habit of
seeing his "picture" in the papers became
finally a mania which led to serious re
sults and even the violation of his con
tract. The artist in question is a famous
tenor, who came here first with Patti. He
is a little red-faced, red-whiskered
Frenchman, whose voice constitutes his
attraction. However, he did not believe
that his features would not charm the
ladles, and hence the trouble. He appear
ed here with the Tavary Opera Company,
and was to sing on Monday, the opening
night. Coming up from Los Angeles, the
Sunday papers were received, and to his
horror Monsieur G. discovered that his
portrait did not appear in any of the pa
pers, and he nearly went Into spasms,
tearing his warm whiskers and indulging
in choice French invective against the
hard-hearted press.
The nearer the train approached San
Francisco the madder he got, and finally
he swore by all the gods of song that he
would not sing on the opening night.
When the opera people were convinced
that he was in earnest there was a quar
rel, which terminated on the ferry. The
male songster was ultimately told in the
heat of passion that the publication of his

portrait would ruin the engagement, and
then the fur flew. In the mixup that fol
lowed it is said that Madame Tavary had
her face slapped, and that something
worse happened to the excited tenor.
Later the local managers who had the
company on their hands tried their sweet
est wiles, and they art- many, to con
vince the stubborn songbird of carmine
adornments that all was not lost because
his face had not been run through a per- ;
rectlng press and given to the public but
be haughtily and profanely said them ' :
nay. Then they became alarmed and
tried all kinds of bribery. They offered
to print a half-page plct'ure of him. He
said It was too late. Then cash offers of !
extra pay were made, until the hot-head
ed and unreasonable Frenchman had
scornfully declined a proffer of $200 above !
his regular pay to sing on the initial
night
As the last resort the company had to
put on a substitute, who knew nothing
of the part, and the result was that the
performance fell flat and the engagement
eventually proved a failure. All because i
of the perversity of a man who wanted I
to see his phiz in the paper worse than ;
he wanted money or friendship. Of such !
stuff some artists are made, be it sadly
said.
J^eW Gomedvj Theater.
Advices from New York indicate that
M. B. Leavltt, who is to open the old
Bush as the New Comedy Theater, will
proceed on his former lines of enter
prise and success. Among the many at
tractive features he will offer' will be four
comedies written by Mrs. Romualdo Pa
checo, author of "Incog," which was j
originally and successfully produced in j
this city. The company will play Salt j
Lake the fore part of September and then
come to the New Comedy Theater for a
run. Mr. Leavltt has also made an ar
rangement with George W. Lederer and
George B. McLellan whereby he will pro
duce all the Casino successes for a sea
eon in San Francisco. For this scheme
a special company will be organized by
Lederer and McLellan. This organization
Is headed by the three prestiac-itateurs,
Le Roy, Fox and Powell, and will Â«be
managed by Frank Conant and Matt
Berry.
The remodeling of the New Comedy
Theater is now proceeding rapdily under
the direction of Alf biiinghouse, and
when it is completed It will be one of the
handsomest theaters in the country.

There are lots of prize housekeepers \
among the women or the stage. Rose
Coghlan can cook, and so can Lillian Rus- !
sell. Mme. Modjeska is a great house
keeper, and May Irwin delights in going
about her house dusting, with a towel
about her head. Little Edna Wallace has
a most formidable apartment in New
York, which she looks after personally.
She has a cook and butler and maid, who ,
boss her around because she is such a
mite of humanity.
The spectacular Kiralfys, well known In ;
San Francisco, have during several years
confined their affairs to Earis Court, Lon

American and Spanish warships. These

accurate, and they are changed from time

The vaudevllleites are up to strange
acts In the way of patriotism. In an
Eastern roof garden an artist wrapped
himself in a Spanish flag, as in a mantle,
and stood in the attitude o<. a diver high
above a deep pool of water. At a given
signal an attendant touched a match to [
the hated red and yellow banner, the i
"professor" took his downward plunge, I
fluttering with fire, and lo! when he arose
from the pool he was clau in the stars
and stripes. How it was done Is not
stated, but it was a clever pyrotechnic
performance, indicating that It was not
difficult to extinguish fire or Spain if the
broper course was pursued, and that the :
Americans have Spanish flags to burn; I
and "that ain't no lie."
Here is a little story which Marshall '
P. Wilder tells about himself: While !
giving an entertainment in a small West
ern town some years ago he was stand-
Ing at the door $.s the audience filed into
the hall, when Â« big lumberman tried to !
push his way past the ticket-taker with
out a ticket. "Can't go in unless to pay,
Imy friend," said Wilder. "Well, I've got
!no money," said the lumberman, "but
I'll give you my dog," pointing to a hound
that was trailing behind him. "All right,
I'll try some of my new jokes on him,'
said the humorist quickly. "Go ahead;
I don't want your dog; take him in with
you." After the performance Wilder met
the fellow and asked him how he liked
the performance. "Well," grunted the
countryman, "I'm glad I kept my dog."

It was a light .that failed Blanche
Walsh as she went cycling down Fifth
avenue last evening, says the New York
Sun. The actress's self-possession did
not fail, apparently, and she got well out
of the scrape. Arrest, however, with in
terviews in court and all that sort of
thing, makes rather a dreary existence
for these scorching days. Miss "W alsn
will get much sympathy and some little
advertising out of her unsuccessful en
counter with the police force.
Anna Held has gone to Russia for the
summer, where she will try to make the
far north people think she is an artist.
If she finds them as cold there as she
found the San Francisco theater-goers,
who took her at her true value instead
of her own estimation, the box-office ther
mometer will be low. It is a mystery
how she can succeed in hypnotizing the
Easterners, for she has made a lot of
money, and it didn't come from this
town.
"Our Boys" is th title of the latest song
and chorus brought out by war times.
The words and music were composed by
Miss Hattie Moulton, a pupil of the John
Swett Grammar School. Considering the
fact that the young lady is but 16 years
of age, the production Is decidedly cred
itable. The sentiment Is highly patriotic
and the verses cleverly constructed. The
song is dedicated to Company G, First
California Volunteers, and is published by
the Zeno Mauvais Music Company, this

George Caron, ttfe clown, whose quaint

never again cause laughter to leap to the

One of the cleverest and most am
bitious members of Augustin Daly's or
ganization is Mabelle Gillman, a San
Francisco girl, and she has been a gold
en nugget for Mr. Daly by reason of her
versatility and ready adaptability. She
has been able to take Virginia Earle's or
Marguerite Vernon's place at any time
in case of sudden indisposition of these
ladies. She is not only attractive in face,
but has a deliciously clear-speaking
voice, 'an enunciation that makes her
lines telling. She has played the lead
ing parts in all of Mr. Daly's musical
productions.
The New York Dramatic News says
that "Hery Lee has undertaken the plan
to organize a big vaudeville company to
consist of high class European stars to
play the leading cities, and M. B. Leavltt
will manage the company. Mr. Lee be
lieves a company of prominent artists will
appeal to the patrons of first-class thea
ters and as all the members will be im
ported the idea will be something new.
Mr. Leavitt will play this company at the
Comedy Theater in San Francisco and
over an extensive route, while a represen
tative has gone abroad to secure the
proper talent. Mr. Lee will introduce a
number of new specialties, and a feature
of the affair is to be the introduction of a
novel pantomime."
It was just a little slip of paper that
turned up at McVicker's Theater in Chi
cago the other night, but it was handed
about as a great curiostiy. The holder,
it read, had purchased two seats "on a
sofa," which would be reserved until
the end of Act I. The signature of J. A.
Warren, treasurer, and the date, June 6,
1862, were written in the spaces of the
printed order. A railroad man presented
the pass, saying that he had originally
obtained the seats for a performance of
"Richard III" and "Who Speaks First,"
but had been unable to use the order at
the time specified, thirty-six years ago.
The pass was honored on presentation
and is preserved as a relic of antiquity in
the McVicker's box office.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
The recent tendency of the stock market to.
dullness was rather accentuated to-day by the
fact that the London Stock Exchange was
taking a holiday. Dealings In railroad stocks
were a minimum, and there was a notable dis- i
inclination to sell. Even , the professional !
bears, who have really been the only prominent '
sellers In the market for a period of nearly ]
two months, hesitated to put out short lines [
to-day. In fear of some development over Sun- j
day that would give the market "its long-ex- I
pected impetus to activity. With the expecta- ]
tion of news at any time that Mantle has been j
occupied by the United States forces, with the â 
expedition in Porto Rico making favorable j
progress and with concrete proposals of con
clusion of peace under actual official discus
â¢ion, the bears do not care to leave short con
tracts open over Sunday in a market that has
shown such long, llrm resistance to all efforts
to force a decline and dislodge offerings of i
stocks. â¢ There was. besides, a continuance of :
the improvement In some of the industrial |
stocks which recently have been prominent. '
There was large and aggressive buying of
Brooklyn Transit, attributed to the predomi- ;
nant interest in the property, with a resulting !
rise of nearly 2 per cent in the prices. The :
rubber stocks continued to advance, on the un- ;
derstanding that they have become the favor- |
ites of onÂ» of the street's influential speculative :
leaders. Sugar and Metropolitan Street Rail
way also showed strength. There was no news
to account for the advance in these stocks. ;
Prices are fractionally higher all around,
rather as a result of the timidity of the bears"
than from any actual demand for stocks.
The bank statement shows that the week's ;
violent changes were due to the practical clos
ing up of operations for 'the Government loan '
and this week's variations are small. . The
new bonds will themselves be available to the
banks as security for deposit of future instal
ments of payments to the Government on ac
count of thÂ» loan. It was the scarcity of
bonds for this purpose that made necessary
last wet-k's heavy withdrawals of Government
deposits.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 84,900
shares, including: . People's Gae. 3259; Lead,
6820; American Sugar, 11,600; U. S. Rubber. 10.

ASSOCIATED BANK STATEMENT.
NEW V RK. July 30.â The Financier says:
The statement of the Associated Banks of New
York City for the week ending July 30 shows
no important changes. The increase of $1,520,
800 In loans is overshadowed by the expansion
of something Itke two and a half millions In
this, item reported by one bank. In the same
manner one bank's -decrease In cash was twice
as large as the average decrease of the re
maining Institutions. Deposits have remained
almost stationary, but there has been more or
less shifting of funds, and the banks with
heavy interior connections seemed to have gain
ed as a rule. - In the same time the reduction
in surplus reserve was brought about by act
! ual loss in cash as the 25 per cent requirement
I is very little higher than last week, owing to
I the insignificant deposit expansion. The specie
decrease was due to operations with the treas
ury, but the transfers of coin to the sub-treas
ury on July 23, aggregating nearly eight mil
lions, seem to have been included in thÂ« last
week's statement. The Government bond pay
ments have been more than half completed,
and the only â effect so far has been to reduce
the reserves at the New York banks about
twenty millions. 'The remaining payments will
have but little effect, since treasury deficits
will about counterbalance reports. anil the
money In depository banks will be withdrawn
gradually.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. July 30.â The further extension
ar.d continuation of rains in the West caused
liberal selling of corn b~ commission houses,
considerably long property coming out on ?<op
loss orders. At the decline resulting shorts be
came good buyers. Some of the prominent
bulls were also conspicuous on that stde, and
the opening decline was partly recovered. That
no greater reduction in price took place was
due to a widely diffused opinion that much
corn had been Irretrievably injured. Septem
ber closed %c lower at 33% c.
The tardy movement of the new crop started
wheat a trifle higher. This comparative
strength was maintained for a time, but finally
the market succumbed to the softness In corn.
There was no Liverpool cables, owing to a
holiday In England. The crop advices main
tained atX'Ut the same tenor as heretofore, and
with nothing to stimulate speculation buyers
arid sellers seemed disposed to take a rest. With
the short Interest eliminated In July that
month began to slip off early in the session .
It dropped from Wftc to 66c. ending the July
deal as was expected. The wheat and flour
clearances from the seaboard reported to-day
were unusually heavy, aggregating about 722,
"-' bushels. When this became known Septem
ber, which was nellir.g at 64c. was bid up to
64% c. As the session drew to a clove. how
ever, there was renewed selling, which carried
the price off again. July closed with a loss of
4^, September unchanged to %c down, and
December unchanged.
Oats were Independently and pronouncedly
bullish. Every commission firm seemed to
have orders, but the buying orders predomi
nated, and prices advanced sharply. Crop dam
axe talk furnished the Incentive for buying.
The closÂ» was V*'S'<*ic higher.
Moderate buying In addition to small receipts
and higher prices for hop? held provisions firm.
The trarle was largely in the way of changing.

BANK NOTES IN BIBLES.
It has happened not infrequently that
wealthy people of eccentric character
have chosen to conceal a portion of their
money in the family Bible, where It has
been discovered by chance long after
their decease.
A young nobleman who was In financial
difficulties some time since had occasion
to refer to the family Bible for a date
there recorded. Id so doing he came
across a number of Bank of England
notes, amounting collectively to a con
siderable sum. which more than met his
liabilities. Then he recalled his mother's
dying words that "help might be found
in the Bible when all other sources
failed." But he had paid small heed to
the injunction and certainly never
dreamed of so practical a fulfillment of
the words referred to.
A needy student purchased an Interest-
Ing old Bible from a second-hand book
seller's some years ago and was delighted
to discover banknotes to the value of
Â£1000 folded between the sacred pages.
Another ancient Bible was found to con
tain notes to the extent of Â£700. This was
owned by a prodigal sop, who lived for
many, years unconscious of the wealth
In his possession.

BINNIE AND NED IN CUBA.
(Sj-nopels of preceding chapter: B!nnf<* and
Ned of California, who will be recollected in
connection with the cruise of the yacht Cali
fornia to New Guinea, are In Cuba, on secret
'service for the United States. The preceding
chapter told how lilnnie narrowly escaped being
killed by a squad of Spanish soldiers He was
hit. but escaped after he Jia^J disabled two
Spanish sentries, rind he hen made his way
to a secret rendezvous, where he met Ned.
Binnie took from one of the sentries whom he
had disabled a lr.lninture of the Penorita Julia
and all a clph-T letter signed by Blanco, the
Spanish Captain General of Cuba. The letter
proved to be at once a paw for the bep.r.-r of it
and also an nrdT for the (leisure of Julia, for
r<-nsr>r.s which will appear more fully as the
Ptory Is developed. ll!nr.ie>and Ned lose no
time in giving notice to the Cuban girl of her
danger.)
CHAPTER IT.
THE Senorita Julia, a mere
girl, had only just turned her
r. Reared amid
peril and taught from
the time when firsl
a few words to think that her life was
consecrated to the task of helping to
secure freedom for Cuba, Bhe was at
once devoted and fearless. She was
slightly built, but Bhfi was as active as
a wild deer. Phe could plan as w<
any one of th* men and she could
keep a secret better. Early Bhe was
astir the day following the â¢
lated in the preceding chapter. Sh
heard the sound of the Spanish guns
when the Spanish soldiers were making
a target of Binnie. A faithful Cuban,
who had seen the entire hap]
from a hiding-plave, had hastened to
bring the news to her. Consequently
phe was expecting the Americans be
fore they arrived. She greet mJ them in
a business-like and brisk way. standing
In- th^ door of her cabin on the v.
mountain side:
"I am afraid you have made' a b id
mistake," she said to Birinie. "Now the
Spaniards will travel all through the
mountains and will not . while

will want to get you as prisoners more
perhaps than they will even me. If

they should succeed in finding an In

fear or for the sake of reward, they
will learn much."
"I had to fight or b* killed," answer
ered Binnie. . "There was no way for
me to successfully dodge them, (or

were many against one. They were or
dered to take you away with them â "
"Take me away?"
Binnie produced the paper signed by
Blanco and slowly interpreted it to the
girl. Her eyes dashed and her cheeka
burned with anger, but she did not
speak for a few minutes after the truth
had fully appeared to her It whs clear
that her quick mind wu already form
ing a, plan and making a swift review
of all the circumstances.
Binnie also thought quickly and the
fearful position in which the Cuban girl
was placed was uppermost in his mind.
The Spaniards must not be permitted
to carry her away, so he thought. But
how could that be prevented? Thi "u
ban mountaineers were scattered ai d
poorly armed and they had not the mil
itary nee that their nearby
lab foes had.
"Never mind," thought out the stout
hearted and loyal California boy, "Ned
and I are two at least and the senorita
is brave. If we could rouse all our
friends there might be a chance to am

, friends that she can af
ford to lose to-day, 1 " broke Binnie in
upen the thoughts of the girl. "All the
irds need not go away if "
â¢â  No, no," said Julia decidedly,
"they must not be ambushed here. If
they should learn all the secrets of
these billa we would lose a place of ref
uge which is of greater value to the Cu
cause than is my single life. Were
Spaniards to die on the moun

them. There are many spies abroad:

"I will deliver myself Into their hands
and will even send a friend to seem

me. The sooner they find me the
sooner they may go their way; espe-
dally if they can be persuaded that you
have escaped."
"No, no!"
"Yes, you must let me go with the
Spanish butchers. I am not afraid
to do this much for Cuba in her
hour of trial, for which I have long
prepared. In the meantime, Binnie, I

tion. I trust you to remove these to â

all ready to move they will look to you
as their leader â not to me."
Tears th:it she could not keep back
rolled down the girl's cheeks, for she
wns fully alive t'> the peril which her
determination would bring Upon h>r.
"It must not be, Julia. Fly while it
is yet time and leave the management
of the Spaniards to me," pleaded Bln
nle.
The girl faced him. her composure
entirely regained. "I have thought it
all out and my plan is the fo^st that
can be adopted."
'â¢But the Spaniards will possibly tor
ture you and throw you into prii

give up your sceret. That must not be.

â¢What must be, must be. What hap
pens to me cannot be considered. I
will not I)- the first daughter of Cuba
to suiter for her native land: nor will
I be the last to manifest my love for
Cuba Libre."
At these words both the Americans
removed their hats in respect to the
brave girl.
"Blanco is brave," she went on, '"and
he will respect courage in n young
Cuban -Tirl. Rutâ what is that 0 " .
The question found a speedy answer.
ThÂ«> Spanish captain and his troopers
were on the trail. The hoofs of their
horses rattled over the bridge that
Bpanned a canyon a mile below the
cabin. A minute later uÂ»e troopers
came into view, spurring their horses
to their best speed, while bi l and
foam dripped from the flanks of the
tortured animals.
"Go," commanded the girl, as she
stood in sight of the road, calmly await
ing, without a sign of fear upon her
handsome face, the oncoming foe.
There was no mistaking her com
mand. The two California boys
turned Into the forest after ;â¢. parting
promise to her that they would yet
bring Julia back to her mountain home
in triumph, if that were possible.
"Fearless I know you are, my
friends," said Julia; "now prove your
self as wist- as you are brave; and do
not change my plan throush your im
patience." She lvld out her hand,
which was pressed by liinnie and Ned.
Then the forest hid them securely.
The Spaniards ransacked the cabin
and nsk^d Julia many questions. She
answered ail good-naturedly, but told
the Spaniards nothing that they
wished to know. "Never mind, young
woman." said the Spanish captain,
"the captain general has a way to
make persons talk and toll him all
tlv ir secrets. Perhaps you will change
your mind after he has tried to per
suade you."
Julia understood this threat to mean
the dark dungeon of some Morro Cas-
tle or possible cruel punishment; but
Btill she smiled and would not tell. She
was placed upon a spare horse and
was taken away as a prisoner. The
Americans saw her depart, but they re
spected her wishes and judgment and
made no hostile move as the cavalcade
Bwept by them within easy range of
th< ir trusty rifles.
Two /lays later Binnie and Ned were
oncn more in the saddle. They had
found the long concealed arms ;iml am
munition â and now? They would sum-
mon the bravest among the Cuban
mountaineers and would follow the
Spaniards to rescue the sennrita fit any
cost. Well the lads knew all the paths
in the mountains, for often, by night
as well as by day, they had ridden has
tily through the mountain fastnesses
to call the Cubans together for drill or
for counsel.
"Halt!"
A tall, swarthy faced man stood in
the middle of the trail as they rode and
held his leveled rifle re^dy for use.
"Ostend!" Binsie almost shouted thÂ«
name in his surprise.
"The same."
"Ami what brines you hÂ»r<>?"
"The Ajnericmni are "ff the coast ol
Santiago in their ships and I am oomÂ«
to command you bott) to proceed at
to Santiago on secret Bel Vice with

"And wh;)t â¢ toe? l '

"What expedition are you now started
upon?" asked Mr. Ostend.
\"Th<' Bpanlarda have taken away the

"Away then and at once. Then lose

PUZZLEâ FIND THE MAN'S BROTHER.
Harry Ostend turned his horse and
was off in a whirlwind qÂ£ dust.
A price upon their lives! Both boys
thought of this at once. With one im
pulse they turned and grasped hands.
â¢â¢That means," Bald Binnie, "that we
are marked for the especial vengeance
of Blanco. But if he gets one he will
have to fight us both."
"That he will," responded Ned, earn
estly, "but we must be off, for the
Spaniards ride fast and do hot spare
their horses."
Hardly had the lads disappeared
around "a bend in the trail when
Ramon Ramirez, who had been se
cretly listening to all that had been
said and who had paid especial atten
tion to Harry Ostend, slipped from be
hind a clump of bushes and plodded
along, on foot, in the direction taken
by Mr. Ostend.
Ramirez had been considered to be
one of the trustiest of the Cuban pa
triots. His actions in this instance were
certainly suspicious. Was he a Span
ish spy?
In the gathering ciusk of early even
ing the Cuban mountaineers mot at the
rendezvousâ the cabin of Julia. Pick
ets were posted, for the Spanish were
known to be more active than usual.
The young and the old men came to
the meeting place from all the sur
rounding country. Binnie had no dif
ficulty in securing a company of vol
unteers to follow the Spanish troopers.
Binnie judged that the time had now
arrived for the general uprising of the
mountaineers, and on the edge of start
ing on this perilous adventure he dis
closed the hiding place of the arms. So
before midnight the Cubans were on
their way to join the army of General
Calixto Garcia, who was in the Santi
ago province. But before this another
company moved. Binnie and Ned. ac
companied by Cuban troopers, hastened
down the mountain side. As they
wound through the canyon in
single file they heard, far up the moun
tain, the sound of a bugle and the
cheers of the Cubans for the "Ameri
canos."
The dawn of Cuban freedom seemed
nearer; but there was much suffering
to come before the dawn could be ush
ered in. The cheering mountaineers on
their way to join Garcia missed Ra
mirez. Where was he? D. H. W.

LITTLE JOHNNY'S PICTURE.
BY JANIE REBECCA WARD.
JOHNNY was not quite five years
old when his mamma said to him
one morning: "My dear. If you
will be a good boy all the forenoon
and do not disturb me while I am
at work you may go over to Aunt
Jane's after dinner and have your pic
ture taken." Aunt Jane, was a photo
grapher, and JÂ»hnny knew what that
meant. He thought it over and after
awhile said: "Mamma, may I have it
taken just as I want it? I mean, may
I Stand just as I please?" ,
"Yes," said mamma, "You may stand
just as you like."
"I am afraid," said Johnny, "that
auntie will not want me to do that."
They then agreed that mamma should
write a note telling Aunt Jane to allow
him to take whatever position he de
sired. Everybody laughed when they
saw the picture.
I do not believe you could guess how
Johnny had his picture taken. He just
stood straight up with his back to the
camera. There was the picture, but no
one could tell whether it was Johnny
or some other little boy. He said he
could see his face in a looking glass,
and he had often wondered how he
looked when he turned his back. It
was a long time before this little boy
heard the last of his queer picture. It
waa shown to so many people that he
finally. said: "Mamma, suppose we hide
that back picture?"
He then put it where it could not
easily be found, but did not destroy it.

she said. "How could you rob that

THE STORY
OF LADY LOREA
ONCE, Ion?: ago. In England, there
lived a beautiful little girl 5 years
old. Her large brown eyes, her
gulden curls, falling around her
pretty face, and a mouth shaped
like cupid's bow, that when Bhe laughed
showed a row of pearl-like teeth, made
the beautiful picture of our little hero
ine.
Her father was the Earl of Woodrlft
Castle. One look from his hcmedt blue
eyes would make one love him. Her
mothtr was also noble and hat.dsome.
PUZZLEâ FIND THE MAN'S WIFE,
and when I have described her daugh
ter I have also described her, they
were so much alike in every way, and
both of the same loving disposition.
When the little girl was about one year
old the Earl lost his beautiful young
wife. When Lady Lorea's mother died
she left no relations except the hus
band and child. The Earl also had r.o
relatives left except his little daugh
ter.
Lorea would often climb on her
father's knee and ask about her mother
and wonder when she would meet her
In heaven, and often she would cry bit
terly when she would see other little
children clinging to their mothers and
think she had none to cling to.
Lorea had very queer ways, and
would often cheer her father when he
was sad with her odd little sayings.
One day, while in the garden playing
on the lawn, she saw on the street a
ragged little girl of her own age crying
bitterly. Lady Lorea ran to her side
and asked the reason of her sorrow.
The little girl was so much surprised
to hear one dressed so nicely speak to
her that she did not answer. Lorea
again asked her why she was crying,
and the little girl said that she had
been without food for a whole day and
was crying with hunger.
The tender-hearted little Lorea was
much touched by her story and told her
to come in and she would be taken care
of. She ran to her father with the lit
tle stranger. When she was passing
through the halls some of the servants
would step aside, for fear that their
garments might touch those of the rag
ged little urchin. Others said that Lady
Lorea was disgraceful to bring such a
child into the house, and some others
said that the Earl would be angry.
Lorea did not mind them. Her heart
was too full of good works. She knew
too well her father's kind heart to
think that he would disappoint her.
As she hurried through the grand
halls the other child seemed much
frightened with all the wonderful
things, as they seemed to her. At
last they arrived at the door of the li
brary, where her father sat, sad and
melancholy. When he saw Lorea he
ran to. her and kissed her;, but what
was his surprise when he saw standing
by her the little beggar child. What a
beautiful picture it made. He asked
Lorea what it meant, and she begged
that the little stranger might be al
lowed to remain. Her father said:
"Another of your queer thoughts; but,
however, if it is the wish of my dar
ling, It shall be granted."
Orders were given to the servants to
clean the little girl and feed her. After
she was clean she and Lorea ran into
the garden to play. Lorea asked her
name, and she said it was Leone.
She was quite a pretty child. When
she first came her eyes were wild and
hungry-looking, but after a while they
lost their wild look and became gentle
and mild. She had soft, black, curly
hair and a beautiful complexion. â¢ At
first she was very timid and almost
afraid to speak, but very soon she got
used to the place and was net so timid.
She had a very sweet disposition and
soon made every one love her.
Larea and Leone ran into the garden
every day to play. They learned to love
each other very much and soon became
very good companions. One day after
about two years Leone caught a cold.
No one noticed it at first, but after a
while she became pale and thin. The
doctor was called and he said she had
quick consumption.
Lorea was very sad because her play
mate and sister, as she called her, was
failing so fast. She remained by her
side all the time. At last one day she
died. Lorea . was very . sad . for a long

time and was often found alone crying
bitterly.
One day a short time after the death
of Leone Lorea and her father went for
a carriage ride. When they returned
they had tea together, then her father
went out for a stroll. Soon after news
came that the Earl had been shot by
some one with whom he had been deal
in? In political affairs and against
whom he had won, and therefore there
had been 111 feeling between them and
through it the Earl lost his life.
He was brought home dying and the
minute he got Into the house he called
for his little daughter. She ran to him.
threw her arms around his neck and
cried. The Earl was asked to make his
will and here is the way he did It. He
left all he had to a friend, whom he
trusted, until Lorea was eighteen. This
friend was to take care of Lorea until
that time. After this he called his little
girl t<> his Fide and told her to always
be kind and true.
Lorea's guardian had a beautiful lit
tle boy, beautiful In face, but not In
actions. He became Jealous of Lorea
and would run to his mother and tell
h.r tales about the little girl. His
mother was of course foolish enough to
believe everything he told her. She
soon began to have a hatred for Lorea
and did <-v< rything to make things <1 s
agreeable for her. Lorea had no friends
to help her, no matter what happened.
The woman knew that and for this rea
son she was not afraid to do whatever
she wanted to with the little orphan.
She soon took away all her grand
clothes and Instead of having maids to
wait on her she had to do all the work
herself and even wait on others. She
became so disheartened that she re
solved to run away. Said she,' "If I
must work and be a servant I'll do !t
where I will be thanked for It and at
least be content and happy."
Lorea worked and earned an honest
living. She fell In love with a young
man and he loved her. He was not
rich. He was a soldier and had just
enough to iive on and that was all.
They were married. A war broke out
and the soldier was forced to go to
war.
One day she was Just preparing to go
for a walk and the postman brought a
letter to her. What was her surprise
when on opening it she found that it
was her guardian who had written It
to her, begging her to come back again
While she was still beautiful she no
longer had on her cheeks the flush
of youth. Her guardian restored to her
the fortune which was hers. Soon after
her husband returred front the war and
they lived happily ever after.

THE SHEPHERD BOY.
BY VERA CHISHOLM.
On the mossy hillside
Where the tiny bluebells peep
A pretty little shepherd boy
Lies dreaming, in his sleep;
While his sheep are running round him
The sun sinks in the West,
And every little bee and bird
Has homeward gone to rest.
That's nothing for the shepherd boyâ
His home is on the hill â
He slumbers softly to the sound
Of the wheel that turns the mill.
The liftte gentle shepherd boy
Is king of this demesne;
His subjects are the snowy sheep.
His throne the hillside grefn.
Sleep, thou, my tired shepherd boy,
Amongst the grasses tall-
Sleep while thy heart is full of Joy-
Sleep while the dewdrops fall;
The Shepherd of the heavenly sheep
Will o'er you faithful vigils keep.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, July 30.â The War
Department has received the following:
"SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 29.â
Hon. R. A. Algrr, Secretary of War,
"Washington: Haw the Sun of Satur
day, July 23, in which comments are
made as to my treatment of General
Garcia. I desire to say that General
Garcia was invited by me personally
to go Into the city of Santiago at the
time I entered It, but he declined upon
the ground that the Spanish civil offi
cers were left in power. It was fully
explained thit those officers were con
tinued in power until it was convenient
to change them for others. General
Garcia's assistance to me has been
purely voluntary on his part, and he
was told at the beginning that 1 did
not exercise any control over him ex
cept he chose to allow. The trouble
with General Garcia was that he ex
pected to be placed in command at
this place; in other worJs, that we
would turn the city over to him. I
explained to him fully that we were
at war with Spain, and that the ques
tion of Cuban independence could not
be considered by me. Another griev
ance was that, finding that several
thousand men marched in without op
position from General Garcia, I ex
tended my own lines in front of him
and closed up the gap, as I saw that I
had to depend upon my own men for
any effective investment of this place.
"SHAFTER."
The differences which have arisen
between General Shafter and General
Garcia are not regarded by the war
officials as serious, and confidence is
expressed that they will be amicably
adjusted.
The dispatch is in entire accord with
Information previously received by the
AVar Department concerning the inci
dent to which General Shafter refers.
It is evident from General ohafter's dis
patch and from other War Department
officials that some of the statements in
General Garcia's letter to Shafter were
incorrect. It was the understanding of
the officials of the War Department
that General Garcia had been invited
to be present at the formalities attend
ing the surrender of Santiago, and this
understanding is corroborated by the
statements in General Shafter's dis
patch of to-day. General Shafter was
given an intimation that it might be
wise for him to make a statement of his
relations with Garcia which could be
given to the public, 90 that any mis
apprehension concerning those relations
which might exist should be corrected.
In response to this intimation Shafter

8 o'clock, patriotic mass meeting
ress by jpr. Radeii
sent the dispatch above quoted to Gen
eral Alger.
A difficulty arising out of the differ
ence between General Shafter and Gen
eral Garcia has arisen in Santiago.
The Spanish residents there have been
led to believe that Shafter'3 army is
to be ordered away from Santiago, af
ter the Spanish troops now prisoners
have been transported to Spain. This
has given rise to a fear in their minds
that they are to be left to the amen
ities of the Cubans. If they feared
tlie occupation of Santiago by the
American army, they are now doubly
fearful of the results of its departure.
Appeals have been made to General
Shafter not to withdraw the American
forces from Santiago and he has com
municated these appeals to the war of
ficials. Assurances have been given
to the people of Santiago by the War
Department through General Shafter
that this Government will stand
squarely by the terms of the Presi
dent's proclamation relative to the gov
ernment of the city and province.
A permanent military garrison for
Santiago, consisting of the First and
Second Immune Regiments, has been
provided and it will remain there even
if General Shafter's corps should be
withdrawn. These facts have been
communicated to the Spanish residents
of the city and have tended to allay
their alarm.
MANY CLAIMS FOR
LOSSES SUSTAINED
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 30.â A
feature of the situation here is the con
stant stream of native residents who
are presenting claims to the authori
ties here against the United States
Government fur losses sustained at the
hands of Cuban troops, damage to
property, robbery and plunder during
the last three years. These claims are
promptly returned with an expression
of regret.
All foreign orders for goods have
been countermanded. There is a dis
tinct sentiment here for the continua
tion of the occupation and the definite
establishment of an American protec
torate.
THE CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND
Merchants Appreciate the Efforcs of
the Ladies' California Club
In That Matter.
The directors of the Merchants' Asso
ciation have expressed their appreciation
of the work of the ladies of the Califor
nia Club in the following letter, which
was sent out yesterday:
To the Ladles of the California Club: On
behalf of the Merchants' Association, the
board of directors desires to express to the
worthy members of your organization the high
appreciation felt for your noble effort* In
creating the first public playground In San
Francisco. During the past decade, play
grounds for children have been established in
many European and American cities; but It
was reserved for your commendable enthusiasm
to found the first public place In Ban Fran
cisco, where our deserving boys may, to their
hearts' content, solve the. vexed problem of
fun. exercise and health In the busy hive of
a commercial metropolis. Hoping that your
thoughtful example of caring for the too much
neglected period of childhood may prove a
source of emulation to our citizens, we re
main, with best wishes for the success of your
cause, sincerely yours.
