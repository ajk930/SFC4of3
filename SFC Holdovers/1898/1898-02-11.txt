A WARSHIP
Letter Carried by the
Duguay Trouin to
Hawaii.
It Has Thrown President
Dole's Government
Into a Flutter.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Feb. 3.â The French
cruiser Duguay Trouin entered port !
this morning, and the usual salutes ;
were exchanged. The Cabinet is be- j
wildered, as the vessel brought a let- !
ter informing the Government that the j
French cable from Tahiti, touching at
Honolulu, was to be immediately laid,
and that in future the steamers of the '
Meesageries Imperiales would call at
this port.
The man-of-war Is ordered to remain
here for an indefinite stay. The Gov- j
eminent cannot understand this move,
and has cabled to-day to Washington
for instructions and advice.
The Dugnay Trouin sailed from Cal
lao on the Tth ult., and used her can
vas a good part of the way up, expe
riencing good weather all the way.
There have been no changes in her
complement of officers since she was
here last year. Following is the full
list: Commodore Fort, Commander
Pugiblet, Flag Lieutenant McGuckin de
Slane, Surgeon Labadens, Paymaster
Ranch and Chief Engineer Lennox,
Lieutenants Fromy, Guthgsell, Tenier,
Forsey, Allemamot, Mondot and
O'Neill, Aspirants dv Brossay, Brossier,
Bemoit, Brousse, Lecannis and Rhobt.
When the Duguay Trouin called in
here in September last, on her way
from Tahiti to San Francisco, she re
mained fourteen days in port, and her
officers, in appreciation c-f courtesies
shown them by the shore folks, gave
a big party aboard, which was largely
attended. The officers on their arrival
here to-day found several bags of mail
awaiting.
The Duguay Trouin has been sta
tioned on the Pacific about seven
years. When she sailed from here the
last time, the officers expected that
she would cruise along the coast of
South America until summer and then
go home, to be replaced next year by
a modern -4000 ton cruiser. She went
from San Francisco direct to Callao,
and remained there until she received
her present orders.

FRENCH CRUISER DUGUAY TROUIN.
BOTHERED BY
THE CANADIAN
REGULATIONS
Captain Goodall Not Permitted
to Use an American Steamer
in Saving the Corona.
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. 10.â Captain
Gpodall has had an awkward experi
ence with the international coasting
and wrecking regulations, which has
interfered considerably with the plans
for saving the Corona, which he cher
ished upon leaving San Francisco.
When the captain arrived at Victoria,
he wished to employ the steamer Cleve
land, then shortly to sail for the north,
to do the necessary work upon the
Corona, and with this In view applied
to Collector Milne for the necessary
authority, the wreck being in Canadian
waters. This the collector refused on
the ground that wrecking In Canadian
waters can be performed only by a
Canadian vessel.
Then Captain Goodall determined to
proceed to the scene of the wreck on
his company's steamer, Queen, and.
thereupon, applied for permission for
her to call at Lewis Island, some few
miles distant from where the Corona
lies. Again he was met with a refusal
from the collector, this time the coast
ing regulations standing in the way.
Captain Goodall then fell back upon
the only resource available, obtaining
the services of the local steamer Maud?
I" tnke himself, pumping apparatus,
and timbers. The Maude was to have
sailed on Saturday, but experienced Cc
lay in stowing the unusually Me ivy
cargo, and then was detained by
weather rather rough for a craft of her
size, so it was only yesterday that she
got .-i way from Victoria.
The steamship City of Topeka came
into port about 11 o'clock to-night, hav
ing left Sitka on the 4th inst. and
Juneau two days later. The Topeka
brings the news that the body of a
dead man has been discovered on board
of the wrcked steamer Corona. Al
though floating about in the hold of the
vessel it had not been recovered. It is
now believed that another dead body
is also on the Corona, as it is known
that the. 'j were two stowaways aboard.
They were in the coal hole when last
heard of, and when the steamer struck,
the hatchway leading into this part of
the vessel was closed down. One of
the stowaways was a well-dressed man,
and is supposed to have come from the
East.

ONLY DISEASED FRUITS
ARE NOW KEPT OUT.
There Will Be No Further Corre
spondence With Germany in
Regard to the Matter.
NEW YORK, x'eb. 10.-A Washington
special to the Herald says: There will be
no further correspondence with Germany
in, regard to the action of that Govern
ment in excluding \diseased American
fruits. Information received by the State
Department from Emba\sador White has
convinced tne authorities that the regula
tions put in force by the modified German
decree for the exclusion of fruit and
plants affected by the parasite known as
the San Jose scale are not any more
stringent than the regulations enforced
by the States of Washington and Oregon
to prevent the introduction of the pest
into those States, and they are not, there
fore, considered by the administration to
be unreasonable. Assistant Secretary of
State Adee has prepared for the depart
ment a lengthy document, giving the his
tory of San Jose scale and of its spread
in this and other countries. A copy of
this will be forwarded to Embassador
White for his information and guidance.
Secretary Sherman said to-day: "The
action by this Government and by its
diplomatic representative at Berlin for
the protection of all legitimate commer
cial and exporting interests injuriously
affected by the German prohibition was
prompt and effective, and, as the
matter now stands, the admission of
American fresh fruit into Germany has
been secured in all cases save where the
actual existence of the San Jose insect
upon the fruit or in the packings thereof
is ascertained."

Baron Harden Hiokey
Ends His Life
With Poison.
His Poverty and Trouble
Cause Him to Take a
Dose of Morphine.
Noted as a Duelist in France
and Later as the "King
of Trinidad."
HE WEDS MISS FLAGLER.
His Latest Scheme Was to Become
the Sovereign of the Hawaiian
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL PASO, Oct. 10.â Baron Harden
Hickey, who several years ago pro
claimed himself "James I of Trin
idad," who had fought duels in France,
who married Miss Anna Flagler.
daughter of John H. Flagler of the
Standard Oil Company, was found
dead by his own hand to-day in the
Pierson Hotel in this city. It was not
until his papers were "examined that
his Identity became known.
The Baron arrived in this cNty from
Mexico on February 3 and haNfl been
staying since at the Pierson Ylotel.
He was last seen alive at half-p\st 7
o'clock last evening by the hotel c.lÂ»rk,
when he retired to his room. His ab
sence from breakfast was noted, anil
at half-past 11 this morning an effort
was made to arouse him. As no re
sponse to the knock was received the
door was forced.
His body was found stretched across
the bed. It was evident at a glance
that the man was dead and that he
had died by poison.
Policemen and physicians were
hastily summoned, and an examination
of the dead man's effects was made.
Among them was found enough poison
to have effected the death of a regi
ment. There was also a letter, ad
dressed to his wife, which was written
on Tuesday night. It was directed to
the Baroness Harden Hickey, Corona.
Riverside County, Cal., and read as
follows:
My Dearest: No news from you, although
you have had plenty of time to answer
my last letter. I expect to leave this
hotel to-morrow or the day after. Harvey
has written me that he has no one in
view In buying my land at present Well
I shall have drained the cup of bitter
ness to the very dregs; but I do not com"
plain. I prefer to be a dead gentleman to
a living blackguard like . Good-by I
forgive your conduct toward me, and trust
you will be able to forgive yourself Ever
affectionately, HARDEN.
An examination of the body by phy
sicians showed that the baron died
from morphine poisoning, and that life
had been extinct for many hours. Very
little money was found among his
effects, and It is presumed that pov
erty, together with family troubles
hinted at in a letter, was the moving
factor in causing the suicide.
Among his effects were found dozens
of medals and insignia and papers of
much interest. Many of them bore on
his scheme for establishing a military
colony on the island of Trinidad, of
which he was to be dictator. His' pa
pers also disclosed that he had been
interested in other and more ambitious
projectsâ notably a plot to place him
at the head of the royalist Government
in Hawaii. Among these papers is the
following from Ralston J. Markoe
which speaks for itself: '
San Francisco, Aug. 26, 1895.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 10.â According
to a special dispatch from Paris
Mme. Dreyfus is so seriously ill,
owing to worry, that she is un
able to appear on the witness
stand in the Zola trial, and in
any case she refuses to furnish
any further testimony.
PARIS, Feb. 10.â The examination of
M. Tauriex, the former Minister of
Justice, was completed at to-day's ses
sion of the Assize Court of the Seine,
before which M. Zola and M. Perrieux,
manager of the Aurore, are being tried,
the former writing and the latter print
ing a letter reflecting upon the Ester

M. Tauriex said that while he was
Minister of Justice he had nothing to do
with the Dreyfus case. He appro% r ed of
M. Scheurer-Kestner's agitation of the
matter.
When Commandant Fornesetti was
called M. de le Gorgue, presiding Judge,
refused to allow him to be questioned

Laborie, counsel for M. Zo'u, an

court he would abandon the examina

Captain Le Brun-Renaud and others,
whom he only desired to question re

Major Paty dv Clam was recalled

to other questions on the ground of
"professional secrecy."

Spanish Government's De a

to the President/
Unless There Is arw Expression
of Regret There May Be a
Serious Breach Between
the Two Countries.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Although Spain has accepted the res
ignation of Senor de Lome as Minis
ter in Washington, the incident will
not be considered closed until Spain has
disavowed his letter or made some ex
pression of regret concerning the con
duct of her late Minister. The author
ities here have been anxiously wait
ing all evening to hear from Madrid,
through Minister Woodford, that some
disavowal had been made. Up to a
late hour to-night the President had
not been advised of the character of the
response made by Spain to the demand
for Senor de Lome's recall.
Assistant Secretary of State Day re
ceived a cipher dispatch from Minister
Woodford to-night, but he would make
no further statement concerning it than
that it confirmed the press dispatch
concerning the acceptance of Senor de
Lome's resignation and announcing the
appointment of Senor Dubcrsc, first sec
retary of legation, as Charge d'Af
faires ad interim. It was apparent the
reply was not what Assistant Secre
tary Day expected, and that some ad
ditional information is desired from
Minister Woodford before the incident
will be regarded as at an end.
At any rate, the authorities will not
consider the matter disposed erf until
the Cabinet meeting to-morrow. The
whole subject will then be discussed
and the course of future action decid
ed upon. I can state authoritatively
that President McKtnley expected
either compliance with his request for
the recall of Senor de Lome or some
expression of regret on the part of
Spain accompanying the announcement
of the acceptance of his resignation,

NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â A spe
cial to the World from Washing
ton says: A member of the dip
lomatic corps, who had Just
called on the ex-Minlster from
Spain, to-day said: "De Lome
says the effect of his resig
nation will be that the Liberal
Ministry under Sagasta will be
forced out of office almost at
once. In the new Ministry he will
be either Prime Minister or Min
ister of Foreign Affairs. Either
position will give him the scope
he needs."
which would show that the Spanish
Government repudiated his conduct. It
is possible that the new Charge d'Af
faires of the Spanish legation will call
at the State Department to-morrow,
and will accompany the formal notifi
cation of his appointment and the ac
ceptance of the resignation of Senor de
Lome, with an expression of regret of
his Government on account of the oc
currence. It is also possible that be-
fore the Cabinet meets to-morrow fur- !
ther dispatches frc-m Minister Wood- j
ford of a satisfactory nature will be re- i
ceived. This is what the authorities j
hope for. It is what they consider they ,
have a right to expect.
Spain's new Ministry has thus far
dealt with all pending questions be

Failure to in some way publicly dis
claim responsibility for the indiscre
tion of her Minister here by an answer
to a note to Minister Woodford may ba
considered in the nature of an affront.
The authorities here consider that
they took the mildest course possible
under the circumstances, and that
Spain, unless she wishes to assume re
sponsibility for Senor de Lome's letter,
cannot but disavow it. It makes little
difference to them what becomes of
Senor de Lome after he leaves here or
what form the Madrid Government
adopts in withdrawing him. All that
will be insisted upon Is that the Span
ish Government shall not tacitly ap
prove his course.
IT has been the earnest wish of the
President to have the incident closed
as promptly as possible, and to avoid
anything that would cause irritation.
If Spain declines to repudiate the ac
tion of her Minister, the authorities will
consider that his letter can no longer
be treated as a mere private communl*
cation from Senor de Lome to Senor
Canalejas, but as a letter from a Min
ister of Spain, for which Spain assumes
full responsibility. Upon the nature of
the reply that the Sagasta Ministry
has made to the note delivered by Min
ister Woodford the whole situation de
pends. Until this has come before the
President and he has had an opportun
ity to discuss it with his Cabinet, the
authorities with whofri I talked to
night were reluctant to speculate about
the future course of the United States.2
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â Up to the
close of office hours the State Depart
ment had not heard from Mr. Wood
ford. Under the peculiar circum
stances existing the ceremonies at
tending the departure of the Spanish
Minister are in doubt. It is usual when
a foreign representative leaves the
country tor him to be received in for
mal audience at the White House,
when ai> exchange of well wishes takes
place between him and the President.
It is hardly expected that this for
mality will be observed in the present
case, owing to the personal aspects of
th.^ incident.
In cases that approach this in most
respects the Minister has usually al
low. .1 nia lettera of recall to be pre
sented by his successor. Senor iluru
aga. who was Senor de Lome's pre
decessor, left Washington suddenly on
leave of absence shortly after the ap
pearance in a newspaper of an inter
view in which he criticized our Govern
ment, lie did not return to Washing
ton, but Senor Dupuy de Lome ap
peared with the letters of recall of Ins
predecessor and letters accrediting him
as his buecesaor, so that there is a pre
cedent for the failure on the part of
the retiring Minister to take leave of
our officials. It is said at the state
Department that there- i.s no time limit
ih which Pc Lome must leave Wash
ington, and being now only a private
Spanish citizen, he may take a reason
able time t<> arrange his affaire here
without calling for criticism.
The Do Lome letter has already at
tracted the attention of foreign Gov
ernments and appears to pc regarded
by them as an important factor in the
general Cuban question. Pome of the
foreign Ministers at Washington have
advised their Governments fully of the
occurrernce. These wore misleading at
the outset, for members of the diplo
matic corps assumed that the letter
was a forgery and some advices civi
veyed this view of the case. Now that
its genuineness has been established the
facts have been sent to most of the
foreign capitals.
No Ineideni In recent days has caused
such a sensation in the ranks of the
diplomatic corps. There is universal
regret among the Bmbassadors and
Ministers who have been brought into
close relations with Senor de L^me. It
has also aroused a keen discussion as
to the right of criticism which a Min
ister can indulge in under the seal of
a private letter. While there is no gen
eral consensus of opinion among diplo
matic authorities, yet many of th.'in
tak*> the view that it is not only a
right but a duty of a Minister to pre
sent every detail of a personal nature
â¢which in his judgment may aid in a
correct understanding of a case.
When inquiries were made at the
Spanish legation as to how the letter
reached the hands of the Cuban junta
it was said that the statements made
by the junta as to Canalejas receiving
the letter were absolutely false. Pri
vate inquiries, it was stated, had been
made through a New York gentleman
â¢which had disclosed that Canalejas
never saw the letter. This inquiry wag
sent by cablegram direct to Canalejas,
now at Madrid, and he was asked if he
had ever received a letter of the char
acter described. To this Senor Canale
jas answered that he never received the
letter, and knew nothing of its con
tents: that if he had received "it, he
would have mads answer to the let
ter. There has never been an acknowl
edgment or an answer from Canalejas.
After this statement direct from Ca
nalejas, the Spanish authorities regard
it as plain that the letter was stolen
in transit, and the reports of Canalojas
receiving it and reading it to Dr. Con
gosto are fabrications intended to cover
up the plan by which the letter was ab
stracted. The fact that the envelope
BETROTHAL OF ROYAL HAWAIIANS.
Princess Victoria KaSulanJ, Heiress to the Pretensions of Ex-Queen Liliuoka
, rlanl, to Become the Wife of Prince David Kawarianakoa.A i
HONOLUIiU, Feb. 3. â The Call is permitted to announce that a marriage has been arranged between Prince
David Kawananakoa and Princess Victoria Kaiulani. The formal betrothal merely awÂ«its the signature to certain
deeds of family settlement of Dowager Queen Kapiolanl, a considerable portion of whose large property will be do
nated to her nephew and his brother, Prince Jonah (Cupid) Kalanianaole.
It will be remembered that Princess Kaiulani is the daughter of ex-Governor Archibald Scott Cleghorn and the
late Princess Miriam Likelike, and under the monarchical regime would have succeeded Queen Liliuokalani to the
throne of Hawaii.
Prince David is the son nf David Kahalepouli, a famous high chief, and Kinoikl Kekaullke, the younger sla
ter of Queen Kapiolani. He is an extremely popular young Hawaiian, has enjoyed a thorough English education,
nftor graduating from a famous semi-military institution near San Mateo, California, and has studied scientific
agriculture at Cirencester, England. He is an enthusiastic yachtsman and athlete, and above all bears an excellent
reputation as a true and honorable gentleman, devoted to the best interests of his country. His early California
training has had its influence on his personal character, and most advantageously. He was destined under the mon
archy for a career in the Department of Foreign Affairs, and for some time acted as a student-clerk in that office,
evincing a disposition for hard and faithful work somewhat surprising to his superiors, considering the temptations
to which his tjien high position subjected him.
This marriage will undoubtedly be used by politicians to ask the question: "Is Queen Kaiulani the logic of
Hawaiian history?" At any rate this announcement ehould dispose of the scare of annexation by Great Britain
or Japan.

evidence that the letter was taken In

closed the postmarks, with the time of

try and Havana, if it ever reached the
latter place.
THE SPANISH PRESS
IN HOSTILE MOOD.
They Think the Government at
Madrid Should Not Have Re
called De Lome.
MADRID, Feb. 10.â The candidature
of Senor Muruaga to succeed Senor
de Lome has been abandoned. The
Government maintains its reserve, de
siring to secure the approval of Wash
ington, according to diplomatic cus
tom, before appointing Senor de
Lome's successor.
i El Perchasays: Senor de Lome's res
ignation has beon accepted, the inter
. national question disappears. Never
theless the Cuban insurgents have
succeeded in chasing from Washington
a representative of Spain who always
displayed great zeal to prevent fili
bustering expeditions, but they have
done so by tricks only employed by the
clients of penitentiaries.
Correspondencia de Militair says:
The Government should not have ac
cepted Senor de Lome's resignation.
The American attitude is offensive and
humiliating to Spain.
El Correro Bspana, the Carlist or

THE LONDON PRESS
GENERALLY UNFRIENDLY.
LONDON, Feb. 10.â The New York
correspondent of the Daily News says:
"Senor de Lome was sometimes trou
blesome on account of his disposition to
assume a high manner over Cuban af
fairs, but he usually subsided when he
found it unsuccessful. A less tactful
successor may precipitate a crisis, for
the situation is full of dangerous ele
ments, but trouble may be averted if
President McKinley holds the affair
completely in his own hands."
The Daily Telegraph editorially cen
sures Senor de Lome's injudicious and
ill-timed letter. The New York corre
spondent of the Standard says: "Presi
dent McKinley was the coolest man in
Washington, and almost exaggerated
the slightness of the personal offense in
order to steady raging Congressmen."
The Standard, editorially, says: "The
responsibility for preventing the affair
reaching a dangerous phase appears to
lie wholly with Spain. The sympathy
Of observers will be with President Mc-
Kinley rather than with Senor deLome,
whose letter shows that he is destitute
of the qualities required by his pro
fession. We confess we should like to
know the facts as to the theft of the
alleged letter, whose opportune produc
tion looks suspicious. But if its use
were designated to hasten the crisis the
designers seem to have gained nothing
beyond a change of Ministers."
The Morning Post says editorially: !
"The Cuban Junta has quite uncon- i
sciously done President McKinley a j
considerable service. Amid the break- i
down of his financial policy and the
gloomy prophecies as to the coming
ele< lions, the De Lome letter is a happy
discovery. It enables the Cabinet to
assume an air of outraged dignity and
then insist upon reparation from Spain I
without in any way committing itself
on the general question of Cuban poli
tics. The letter was quite natural for j
Senor de Lome to send, and the im- j
petuous and high-handed proceedings
of the Washington Government form ;
another illustration of the total con- j
tempt for good manners which charac
terizea the State Department. In this I
case their energy is stimulated by the !
opportunity to please the rabble of j
their party without actually provoking j
Spain to declare war."

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 9.â The recent
rain, with its bountiful blessings, has
not only revived and given new life to
the seed sown some weeks ago, but
seems to have stimulated and awak
ened the patrons of political husbandry
and the crops of that character not
already in are being planted to a
greater acreage and preparations for
an early harvest are being actively
made.
W. R. Davis of Oakland spent a
couple of days here last week and scat
tered a few seed, which he hopes may
multiply to his profit later on. He en
countered winds from other directions,
however, and those who are looking
after the interests of L. H. Brown and
Attorney-General Fitzgerald declare
that what little sowing he did will not
thrive, as the soil of Sacramento Coun
ty has been and is being cultivated for
other crops than his.
The announcement in the Oakland
Tribune to the effect that L. H. Brown
had retired from the fight for Gover
nor has resulted in quite an active
movement in that direction on the part
of his Sacramento friends and sup
porters.
Mrs. L. H. Brown, in speaking of the
report, made the following statement
to The Call correspondent to-day: "You
may say positively that such a report
has no foundation in truth. In fact,
Mr. Brown is now actively engaged in
mapping out and planning his cam
paign. The attending physicians have
advised me to the effect that should
Mr. Brown now take their advice and
refrain from excitement and bother of
official cares for a week or so more he
will be stronger than he has been for
six years, and it is their wish that he
should be careful now in order that he
may be fully prepared to enter into any
kind of a venture later on.
"Mr. Brown put in an hour 'of hard
work yesterday, and it is now our in
! tention to go to San Francisco the last
of the week and later on we may take
a trip south. I have received several
letters making inquiries concerning the
report in the Oakland paper, and you
can ,: say for Mr. Brown that the
thought of retiring from the fight has
never entered his head, and in a short
; time he will be able to take up matters
pertaining to the contest with his old
time vigor and energy." , . â¢ '.J â :â â â 
While, nothing of a positive nature
could be gathered at;, the office of the
â  Attorney-General. , Judge v'C.. N. ? Post
and Charles H. J:\ckson, the represen
tatives of the Attorney-General in Sac
i ramento, are both sanguine of their
principal's ultimate victory. â¢ . ... .
The Congressional contest in the Sec
ond District has brought out Judge J.
M. Walling of Nevada, City, and his
great strength is conceded by all. The
Record- Bays editorially:
Judge J. M. Walline of Nevada City
will geek the Republican nomination . for
Congressman for the Second District.
Judge Walling is a strong man, extreme
ly popular in the mining counties and
thoroughly acceptable to the agricultural
; portions of the district. He was depart
: ment commander of the Grand Army in
California last year, is a leading Odd Fel
j low and Mason, and is well known
I throughout the State. He has served on
i the judicial bench with great distinction.
He is regarded by all other candidates in
the district as formidable. .
The supporters of Judge Walling aro !
further urging his no-mination upon j
the claim of locality. Amador, El Do
rado, San Joaquin and Sacramento
counties have all had the naming of a
Congressman from the Second, and
now Nevada, which has always stood
up good and strong for the o-ther nom
inees, claims the turn to put forward
one of her favorite champions. The
good feeling now prevailing between
, the mining and agricultural counties,
; which go to make up the Second Con
gressional District, will certainly insure
the electic-n of Judge Availing.
Hon. E. C. Voorheis, State Senator
from Amador and Calaveras, has been
urged by his friends to stand in, but
he declines, and in speaking to the i
representative of The Call said: "My!
mining Interests are such as to abso- ;
iutely preclude every possibility of my
becoming a candidate for any office. I j
could not under any circumstance or
contingency be persuaded to accept
any office of a public nature."
Jacob H. Xeff of Placer County is j
being urged by his many friends to ac- !
i cept the nomination for Governor, but j
as yet they have not been able to se
cure his consent.
"His popularity throughout the State
would certainly insure his election,"
said J. J. Crawford, ex-State mineral
ogist and prominent Republican lead
er of El Dorado County.
The Republicans are not alone in
preparing for the fray, which will be
on us before we know it, provided the
Supreme Court sustains the enactment
of the Stratton primary law.
The Bryan Silver-Republican, Dem
ocrat and Populist aggregation had a
meeting last night, and arranged for
the firing of the first gun. Hon. C. A.
Towne, ex-Congressman from Minne
sota, is going to touch it off on the
24th day of February, provided suffi
cient funds can be collected to buy the
powder and hire a hall.
In the way of local matters things
are moving along smoothly, with May
or Land and the trustees throwing bou
quets at one another, and at the same
time giving Sacramento a promise- of
the best administration the capital
city has ever had.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
GILA BEND, Ariz., Feb. 10.â This
morning about daylight an attempt was
made to assassinate Josiah Anderson,
a well-known rancher living several
miles from this place. A masked and
mounted stranger called Anderson to
his gate and fired two loads from a
shotgun point blank at him. Almost
miraculously Anderson escaped with
his life. One of the shots went wild,
the other dreadfully shattering Ander
son's hand.
The assailed man lately achieved
more than local notoriety in connection
with a theft of cattle from the ranch of
a neighbor. The charges, which are
now pending in the District Court,
have aroused the most intense bitter
ness. Another incident supposed to
have connection with the same affair
was the incendiary' firing, last night, of
the dwelling and stable of Frank D.
Welcome and the home of Mrs. S. E.
Hazzard. All three buildings were de
stroyed.

TO TESTIFY

relate the story of the Esterhazy in
quiry and said that Matthieu Dreyfus
and M. Scheurer-Kestner both admitted
that they could not prove the charge
against Major Esterhazy.
General Pellieux then indulged in an
outburst against Colonel Picquart,
whom he accused of divulging an
espionage affair to an outsider, claim
ing "such conduct is shameful." Re
ferring to the bordereau, the general
declared that the alleged fac similes
: published were all fictitious. As to the
i compromising letter sent to Major Es
| terhazy, which might raise suspicion
i that he had shady relations with a for
j eign agent. General Pellieux said: "It
i is inconceivable that any one could be
so naive as to employ this method of
correspondence in a matter of such
gravity." General Pellieux here ex
pressed indignation at the "inexcusa
ble action of Colonel Picquart in having
Esterhazy's rooms burglarized without
authority of any kind."
"Colonel Picquart admitted this," the
witness continued, "and when the
court-martial acquitted Count Ester
hazy I was not astonished. I was
proud of having contributed to the ac
quittal of Esterhazy, which proves that
in the French army there are not two
traitors, but only one traitor."
General Pellieux was about to refer
to the Dreyfus case when the presid
ing judge gently interposed his usual
veto.
M. Dupuy, the former Premier, was
then called and M. Laborie began to
question him regarding the case of
Dreyfus, which the presiding judge ve
toed, whereupon M. Laborie announced
that he wo'uid throw up the examina
tion of M. Dupuy and other former
Ministers, as the ruling of the presid
ing Judge made it fruitless.
M. Thevenet, a former Minister of
Justice, who was next examined, said
he could easily understand why M. Zola
was exercised by the "veiled lady
story." M. Zola, he added, had acted
in good faith, for complete truth had
not been thrown on this matter and M.
Zola's was not the only troubled mind.
M. Thivenet expressed satisfaction at
the acquittal of Major Esterhazy,
which, he said, proved there was no
traitors in the French army, but he
"boldly insisted" that complete light
had not been cast upon this grave af
fair, which, he added, interested the
whole of Europe. He further expressed
regret that the Government had not
spoken in order to restore tranquillity
for the country. Continuing, M. The
venet said he was astonished that the
witnesses, instead of giving open testi
mony, should take refuge behind "pro
fessional secrecy."
M. Salle. a lawyer, followed M. The
venet on the witness stand. The pre
siding Judge refused' to allow questions
to be put to him concerning the Drey
fus case, and a heated discussion be
tween the Judge and M. Laborie en
sued. The latter asked for a short ad
journment in order to draw up a for
mal application that these questions
be allowed.
When the hearing was resumed M.
Laborie submitted the application re
ferred to. M. Clemenceau, counsel for
the Aurore, supported him in a skillful
maneuver. The former asked that for
mal notice be taken of the fact that M.
Salle, on the witness stand, "has not
denied that he was aware, though a
member of the court-martial, that a
secret document was submitted to the
court-martial."
The court refused both applications,
but M. Clemenceau, by his expedient of
reading a question in the form of an
application, practically obtained what
he wanted. The court then adjourned.
There was some demonstrations on
the streets to-night, but nothing seri
ous occurred. After each day's pvo
ceedinga a report of the case is tele
graphed to Emperor William.
SUICIDE OF A
REMARKABLE
ADVENTURER
Continued from First Page.
Tory cannot give rise to any constitution
al questions, for the reason that constitu
tions, like land tenures, are In a state of
such utter confusion that only a strong
hand can unravel them, and restoration
will result in the establishment of a
strong military government. If I go
down 1 with the expedition I have organ
ised I shall be in full control of the situ
ation, and In position to carry out all my
contracts.
Thirdâ lt is the inland of Kaual on
which I propose to establish you as an
Independent sovereign.
Fourthâ My plan is to successively oc
cupy all the islands, leaving the capital
till the last. When others have fallen
the capital, being cut off from all re
sources, will be easily taken, and may
even very likely fall without a fight. I
do not expect in any case to have to
fortify myself or to take the defensive
or to have to issue a call to arms, but I
shall have an overwhelming force to join
me also, in addition to those wh.o go with
me, who by themselves will be sufficient
to carry everything before them without
active co-operation from people here.
Fifthâ The Government forces consist
of about 160 men and boys, with very im
perfect military training, and of whom
about forty are officers. They are or
ganized as infantry. There are also about
six hundred citizens enrolled as a civil
guard who may also be called in case
of an emergency, and about 150 police.
We can fully rely upon the assistance
of all the police and from a quarter to
half of the troops; and of the remainder
many will, under the circumstances, en
gage in a sharp fight in defense of the
present Government. There are now on
the island plenty of men and arms to ac
complish our purpose, and if my expedi
tion does not get off very soon the peo
ple there will be organized to do the work
without assistance from here, other than
the direction of a few leaders, of which
they stand more in need than anything
else.
Sixthâ The toiwiage of the vessel is 14G.
She at present has berth room for twenty
men, but a bunk room can be arranged in
the hold for 868 more, with provisions for
ample ventilation. She has one complete
set of sails and two extra spars. The
remaining information as to her I will
have to obtain and send you to-morrow.
I think it must be clear to you that the
opportunity now offered you will be of
Incomparably greater value at once than
Trinidad would ever be. Still hoping that
I may have an Interview at an early day,
respectfully yours,
RALSTON J. MARKOE.
There were also papers showing that
he had once been possessed of large es
tates in the Republic of Mexico. Among
the newspaper clippings was an ac
count of his marriage in New York City
three years ago by Rev. John Hall to
Anna Flagler, daughter of the Stand
ard oil magnate.
That the Baron had only followed his
own teachings in ending his life by poi
son was evidenced by a book of which
he was the author entitled "Euthania;
or, the Ethics of Suicide."
Baron Harden Hickey was the first
of the royal dynasty of Trinidad. He
was born in San France December 8,
1854, of a Catholic and old royalist fam
ily. His ancestors, the Hickeys, orig
inally came from Ireland, having ac
companied the banished royal Stuarts
of England in their flight to France.
The young baron was educated at the
college of Jesuits at Namur, and after
ward at Leipsic. Here he established
a reputation as a first-class and fear
less duelist. When 19 years of age he
entered the French military college at
St. Cyr, but he abandoned a martial
life on the death of his father in 1873,
and devoted his life to sculpture and
literary pursuits. *
His talents first found recognition
in the shape of translations for Eng
lish magazines, but he also wrote quite
a number of works in his native lan
guage. In 1878 the irrepressible writer
started a weekly satirical paper in
Paris cabled La Tribotteta, which
landed him in constant tribulation. It
was devoted to the interests of the
royalists, and its editor, the baron,
made 114 appearances in the police
courts, paid fines amounting to 300,-'
000 francs, and fought no less than a
dozen duels. Among his antagonists
were Aurelian, Scholt, A. Lavertujon,
Tame arid De Cyon. He was eventu
ally compelled to leave France, going
to England.
The barnn was thoroughly conver
sant with the Sanskrit language, and
after studying its literature, deter
mined to propagate the religion of
Burldha throughout the United States.
In the meantime he met and married
Miss Anna Flagler, the daughter of the
Standard Oil magnate, and gave up his
intentions in that direction. He then
set about starting a new kingdom on
the island of Trinidad, but the revolu
tion in Brazil interfered with his
plans.
The enterprising Baron claimed to
have hit upon the last bit of habitable
earth upon the surface of the globe
capable of supporting a considerable
population which escaped the grabbing
greed of the annexation passion of the
powers that be, and he proposed to
make it a little power to itself. The
territory which was thus about to be
raised to the proud eminence of inde
pendent nationality is a little island
which pokes its nose out of the bed of
the South Atlantic Ocean about lati
tude 20 degrees 30 minutes south and
longitude 29 degrees 22 minutes west,
which everybody knows is 700 miles off
fhe coast of Brazil, at the point where
stands the town of Victoria. Being
compelled to abandon his kingdom
before it was born, the Baron then be
came a soldier of fortune.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 10.-When the consol
idation of all the roads in the present
Northwestern system has been completed
the plan now undor consideration will
have been consummated. The consolida
tions will be but the solidifying of one
link in a great chain extending over the
entire continent from the the Atlantic to
the Pacific. Once these conditions are
outof the way the field will, it is believed,
be clear for the further consolidation of
the Northwestern and Union Pacific sys
tems.
The two roads of to-day practically are
one. All affairs relating to through "busi
ness is so arranged a* to guard their in
terests and suit the convenience of each,
and the final consolidation of the two
roads will in reality be more a matter of
detail than the introduction of any radi
cal change in the relationships which now
exist between them. When they become
one in name, as they are now in action,
the conpletion of the western chain al
luded to will have taken place and noth
ing will remain but to weld it to the east
ern end, which has already been formed
by the unification of the New York Cen
tral and the Lake Shore roads. The Van
derbilt main line will then extend from
New York to San Francisco. It may be
that by that time absolute ownership of
the Central Pacific will have been se
cured. Whether it Is or not. the present
rights of the Union Pacific to cover that
line are Inalienably secured.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 10.â The City
Council committee on mountain water
supply will in a few days start out to
personally Investigate the various
sources of supply which have been
offered. Chairman Grider says the
trip would have been made before had
tho recent rains not Interfered.
"We are waiting also," said he, "for
Chairman/ Hazard to announce his
| steering /committeee, so that we can
| consult With those gentlemen and learn
j what is /pest to be done."
The gfeneral opinion is that the prop
erty knj,iwn as Crystal Springs will bÂ«
included in the schedule inventory
which }[he water company will return
,to the Council. It is upon this item
I that the water company and the city
will n^ver agree, as the city claims
! the alleged springs to be nothing more
| nor less than a part and parcel of the
Los Angeles River, to which the city'a
title has beeen granted by the courts.
In this connection the real tactics of
the water company become apparent.
In its paid authorized statement pub
lished in the midwinter number of the
Times the company insists that until
â¢ this Crystal Springs litigation has been
! disposed of there can be no arbitration.
i This means that municipal ownership
will have to wait, if the water com
pany has its way â and that is what the
| syndicated press is striving to effectâ
until that issue has been taken through
all of the State and Federal courts,
which must of necessity consume sev
| eral years, the company presumably
acting in the interval under its present

CALLING FOR
MARTIAL LAW
Good Citizens at the
Mercy of Despe
radoes.
Governor Brady Asks the
President to Send
Troops.
Marshal Shoup Wants Military
Posts at Both Skaguay
and Dyea.
THE SITUATION CRITICAL.
New Strikes Reported â Fort Yukon
Short of Food â Sam Wall's
Perilous Trip.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITKA, Alaska, Feb. 5 (by steamship
.City of Topeka to Seattle, Feb. 10).â
President McKinley will be called on
by Governor John G. Brady of Alaska
to enforce order at Skaguay. The sec
ond scone of the Skaguay tragedy, in
â which two men were murdered and
two arrested, has been transferred to
the capital. The transfer means busi
ness â vengeance and preservation of
order if Uncle Sam must be called upon
to maintain it.
The fact is that United States Mar
shal Shoup, who is a brother of ex-
Penator Shoup of Idaho, regards the
situation at Skaguay as critical and as
demanding the presence of an armed
force of United States troops to pro
tect life and property.
The lawless element of humanity has
drifted into Skaguay from all sections
of the earth in sufficient numbers to
almost control the town and seriously
alarm the other inhabitants. It is a
dull night, indeed, when there is not a
hold-up or a theft, and a very stormy
day when the â¢"sure-thing" man does
not make a "killing." and it has been
so for two weeks more.
Since my last dispatch, sent south
aboard the steamship Oregon. th>^
method of procedure at Skaguay has
been changed. Instead of appealing
direct to the Secretary of War for pro
tection it was decided to send a request
to Sitka for assistance. A paper stat
ing the facts of the situation there and
asking for help came by the same
that brought the double mur-
derer, Eddie Fay, and a man known as
"Crazy" Junes, who is charged with
assault with inK-n: to kill in emptying
the bullets of his revolver into the legs
of liariy Lamnnt, a spectator.
The remains of Deputy United States
Marshal .Mark A. Rowen and McGrath
have been interred. The sight of these
funerals greatly stirred the law-abm-
ing element of Skaguay, which, not
withstanding the overplus of toughs,
numhvr? many. The citizens held a
m meeting the next day after the mur
ders, organized and appointed a Com
mittee of Safety, which closed the thea
ter where the revolvers were fatally
flashed, and sent word broadcast
through the town that a conspicuous
example would be made of the next
man who committed a serious breach
of the peace. This was generally un
derstood to intimate the use of a length
of hemp with a body dangling at the
end.
Since then Skaguay has quieted down
somewhat. Fay says he never tended
bar before; that he was awaiting the
return of his partner, who was engaged
in getting their Klondike outfits to
Lake Bennett, and that he did not
know Rowen, who he supposed was a
friend of McGrath. .
United States Marshal Shoup was at
Rkaguay about ten days ago. At that
time he was in favor of stationing
troops at Skaguay and Dyea. He saw
then that the grafters, gambiers, bunko
men and the riffraff of the earth, com
ing in on every boat, threatened peace
and good ordÂ»r. The citizens at that
time differed from Shoup in their opin
ion as to what ought to be done. They
wanted more United States Marshals,
rot less than ten â an Uncle Sam police
force.
Governor John G. Brady has now
taken a hand. He will appeal to the
President of the United States for a
force, military or civil, sufficient to en
force law and order. He will state the
facts of the situation and ask that o-ne
or two companies of soldiers or deputy
marshals be sent for duty at Skaguay
and Dyea, to remain there while the
rush to the Klondike by way of th*
overland passes is on. This action was
precipitated by the recent murders and
other crimes and the increasing assem
bly of crooks at the gateways to the
rich gravel beds of the Yukon.
The Governor expressed the hope
that I would not ask him for a copy
of his communication before it had
been transmitted to the President,, but
the gist of its contents is as stated.
The official communication may go
south on the steamship City of To
peka, which leaves Sitka at 9 o'clock
this morning if it can be finally pre-

SHIP LUCILE
TO TAKE SOME
RELIEF STORES
Portion of the Government Expe
dition to the Klondike Will
Be Sent North With
out Delay.
SEATTLE, Feb. 10.â Arrangements were made to-day to transport
from Seattle a portion of the Government relief expedition that is to
take food to the needy miners in the Klondike district. The fine sail
in? ship Lucile, Captain Anderson, has been secured to take a detach
ment of men and 110 pack mules to Dyea, in charge of two officers of
the United States regular army.
The expedition from Seattle was to have sailed on the steamer Sig
nal, under charter by Carroll, Johnson & Co. The date of the sailing
on the Signal was set for February 5, but the steamer was delayed by
discharging cargo in the north until past the time fixed in the con
tract with the shippers. For this reason, and for the further reason
that the officials of the department believed that If the expedition was
to accomplish the desired relief it should be started not later than the
12th of the month, it was decided to cancel the contract with the Sig
nal and send another boat.
Final arrangements were made to-day between Captain W. W. Rob
inson Jr., actir.s tor the War Department, and Havner & Co., agents
for the Lucile. for space on the boat to carry the pack train and the
men and supplies north as soon as she could be loaded. Cars con
â¢aining the freight and sleds were hurried from the Northern Pacific
sheds to Schwnbacher's dock this afternoon, and the work of loading
> ship will be begun to-morrow morning bright and early. The Lucile
will be towed to Dyea and Skaguay by the tug Sea Lion.
The expedition will be in command of Lieutenant Guy H. Preston
and Lieutenant J. A. Ryan, both of the Ninth United States Cavalry.
Lieutenant Preston is a gallant officer, who earned the approbation of
' superiors and considerable fame in the Indian campaigns of 1890-91
n Dakota. At the battle of Wounded Knee, while a detachment of
troops was surrounded by the Indians, he carried important dispatches
through the lines of the savages to General Brook, in command at
Pine Ridge. His ride was one of the memorable incidents of the cam
paign, and was made through a country filled with bloodthirsty red
men. . mx
pared in time, so that it is quite prob
able that even if martial law is not de- j
clared at Skaguay. United States troops
may be stationed there and at Dyea
soon. r .. .
Governor Brady's communication to
the President is a strong one. Arrange
ments have been made to have it wired ;
from Seattle to Washington, whether
it goes south on this or the next ship. ;
It is said that contracts will be signed j
this week for a railroad over the Ska- j
gtwy trail to Lake Bennett, to be in |
operation by September next. If this ;
is carried out Skaguay will have the
first railroad tp the Yukon.
Four men who left Dawson January
3 arrived here to-night. They got to
Skaguay January 28, twenty-five days
on the trail, which" equals the best time
really made up the river this winter.
There is so much travel up and down
the river that outcomers are not com- i
pelled to break trail through the snow,
as in previous years, and that is why
it is possible to make such unprece
dented fast time. A. D. Nash, one of
! the party, has made three winter trips
! into the Yukon. He is from Portland,
| Oregon. The others are: E. M. Sulli
' van of Victoria, B. C, W. O. Young of
! Colorado and H. F. Wauerh of New
â  Brunswick. Just before they were ready
! to leave Dawson a new strike was re- |
i ported from down near Sixty Mile. The |
name of the creek is Rosebud. Xo par
ticulars were heard, beyond the fact
that the first prospects were very en
couraging.
Reports from Fort Yukon as to the i
grub supply and as to the actual con- :
dition of things there recently became
very conflicting. Billy Moran and
George Kennedy came up the river
from Fort Hamlin with the report
that there was nothing but the shortest
| amount of provisions at Fort Yukon
and that the people stranded there i
j were in far greater danger of starva- \
tion than those at Dawson. Other re- j
ports were in circulation to the effect j
that the food supply had been seized j
by the men after Captain Ray and j
Lieutenant Richardson, the only United
States army officers there, had been
overpowered.
It was for the purpose of getting at
the truth that Sam Wall, The Call's
correspondent at Dawson, undertook
the cold and perilous trip down the
river behind a dog team. A. D. Nash
is personally acquainted with Mr. Wall.
He said Mr. Wall has a long and a
very frosty ride before him. The Ca
nadian police have posted notices at
various points on the trail that no per
son will be allowed to go down the
river below Tagish House with less
than 1000 pounds of provisions. These
notices were posted last night at Dyea
and Skaguay. Several Klondikers win
tering at the mouth of the Big Salmon
River sank a shaft 100 feet to put in the
time and see what they could find.
There they found 4-cent gravel, but
the water drove them out and they
could go down no deeper. They went
up the Big Salmon eight miles and
started another shaft, hoping to escape
the flood and find richer dirt.
Major Walsh is still at Tagish Lake.
He will not get into Dawson before the
Ist of April, if he makes it by that
time. HAL HOFI MAN.

SIX THOUSAND
DOLLARS A TON
What James T. O'Brien's
Klondike Quartz
Assays.
The Lucky Prospector Tells of
How He Stumbled Over
a Bonanza.
Will Shortly Return From Seattle
With Powder and Tools to
Open the Ledge.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 10. â Some days ago
The Call referred to the discovery of
rich gold quartz in the Klondike dis
trict by James T. O'Brien. He brought
out samples of ore from the bottom of
the shaft and left them at Juneau to
be assayed. To-day Mr. O'Brien re
ceived a letter from John Olds, pro
prietor of the Occidental Hotel at Ju
neau, which stated that the report of
the assayers at Treadwell Mine gave
the value of the ore as JSSOO in gold
and ninety ounces of silver. The ledge
from which this remarkably rich ore
was taken is three feet wide and gives
every evidence of being a true lead.
This tells the story of one of the
richest discoveries that have yet been
made on the Yukon. It was early in
December that Mr. O'Brien discovered
croppings of a quartz lead while cross
ing the ridge between the head of El
Dorado Creek and Quartz Creek, a
branch of the Indian River. He
traced the ledge on the bare top of the
ridge for some 3000 feet and sank a
small prospect shaft where the crop
pings appeared best. On the last trip
of the Corona Mr. O'Brien came into ]
Seattle. But no one knew that he was
the real discoverer of Klondike quartz,
as he said nothing about it, for he did ,
not know how the ore he had left at
Juneau would assay.
But then he did not tell any
one that he had $25,000 in drafts,
for he is one of the most reserved indi
viduals that have yet come out of the
Klondike. Now that he has received
news which leads him to believe that
he has located the best claim in the
Klondyke coutry he does not care to
talk about it, but finally told the story
of the discovery to the Call corre
spondent to-night. He said:
"Early in December there was a
stampede to Quartz Creek, a tributary
of the Indian River. With a number
of others I started across the ridge
from El Dorado Creek, hoping to get
a claim. The top of the ridge between
the two creeks had been laid bare of
snow by the high winds.
"Almost on the very top of the ridge
I noticed mineral croppings. I was in
terested in quartz finds, for several
stringers of quartz had been struck
shortly before in the bedrock prospect
holes on the gulches. It was not very
difficult to trace the ledge, which
cropped at intervals, and I followed it
on both sides of the croppings that had
at first attracted my attention for a
distance of 3000 feet. I then gave up
the race to Quartz Creek, and decided
to prospect the ledge. With a pick and
shovel I dug at the point where the
croppings appeared best to a depth of
four feet. Then I struck a solid forma
tion, and having no drills or powder
could go no further. 1 hastened to
Dawson and located two claims, call
ing the lead Ophir Mining Ledge.
"I had to come out for a grub supply,
so I contracted with Cal. Rrosius to
take me out for $600. According to our
agreement I was unable to bring out
any quantity of the ore, but loaded my
pockets with samples taken from the
ledge. I have had some experience in
quartz mining in Wyoming and South
eastern Alaska, and the ledge appears
to be a true one. The ore I left at Ju
neau to be assayed at the Treadwell
mine.
"I have just received a letter from
my old friend, John Olds of Juneau,
which states that the assay ran $5800
in gold and ninety ounces in silver.
That is mighty rich ore, even from the
golden Klondike, and I have hard
ly had time to figure it out. I will go
back in a few months with powder and
tools to open up the ledge, as I think
it is better than the placer interests I
have."

Upon the Defective Shrapnel

Special Dispatch â¢- The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 10.
Both Senator Perkins and Repre
sentative Hilborn of California are
showing a lively interest in the matter
of the quality of ammunition that is
being supplied to the army. General
Flagler, chief of the ordnance depart
ment, was before the Senate Commit
tee on Fortifications to-day. He tes
tified that neither heat nor cold, dry
ness, moisture nor age should affect
the powder.
Senator Perkins, chairman of this
sub-committee, is very much interested
in the exposure made by The Call on
last Thursday morning of the failure of
the shrapnel shells. He said to-night:
"I am sorry that a copy of Saturday's
j Call giving further details of this mat
ter did not reach me earlier to-day, for
I would have sought to elicit some ad
ditional facts during our examination
of General Flagler to-day.
"I have resolved, however, to address
him a letter (inclosing a copy of The
Call's article). It seems to me that
this is a very serious matter, and when
I receive General P^lagler's reply to my
letter of inquiry I may bring this mat
ter to the attention of the Senate
when the fortifications bill comes up
for consideration. The bill will be re
ported to-morrow by the committee."
"The War Department submitted an
estimate of nine millions, but the
House of Representatives, being eco
nomically inclined, cut the amount
down to four millions. The amount
which the Senate < nmmittee has pro
vided, however, approximates nearly
that sum. It will he over eight mil
lions and nearly nine. This will be
pleasing intelligence to Pacific Coast
people, as a great deal of the money
will be expended on that coast for
arms and emplacements."
Congressman HilNirn is as much in
terested in the matter of fortifications
as Senator Perkins. He is inclined to
believe that certain manufacturers of
ammunition are the beneficiaries of the
Government's favor.
He has introduced a resolution of in
quiry, demanding to know why the two
"shoulder arms" employed by the army
and by the marines are of different
caliber, when it would seem to be of ad
vantage to the Government (in emer
gency) to have them of the same cali
ber.
Hilborn will also undertake in the !
House of Representatives to put
through a resolution of inquiry con- j
cerning the ammunition furnished the '
Government, and Senator Perkins may j
do the same thing in the Senate after j
receiving General Flagler's reply to
his communication.
STEAMER KAALA
A TOTAL WRECK
Runs on the Reef at Kahuhu
and Is Broken to
Pieces.
Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Feb. 3.â The steamer
Kaala of the Inter-Islaru] n?et Is a total
wreck on the reef at Kahuku. Nothing
whatever was saved and the captain and
crew landed safely at Laic In .he steam
er's boats with nothing of their belong

their backs.
The Kaala left this pnrt on the 17th ult.
with freight for Kahuku and Punaluu.
She succeeded in landing: all this in good
shape, and close upon 5 p. m. the next
day started out of Kahuku for Honolulu

there was no help for her, ordered his
men Into the boats and all hands went
The Kaala was then pounding heavily
on the reef and breaking to pieces very
rapidly. Telephone messages received

But Since the Pollard Scandal the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Feb. 10.â Captain
Thomas E. Moore's challenge to Colonel
Breekinridge printed an editorial in the
reigning sensation here to-day. Colonel
Breekinridge printde an editorial in the
Lexington Herald this morning under
the caption, "Once a Man. Twice a
Child," in which he refers to Captain
Moore: "Our dear old bimetallic leaguer
seems to have lost his temper, and if
one did not know him he might be
lieve he was extremely anxious to
fight; but he uses language in a Pick
wickian sense. The Herald took pleas
ure in bearing witness to his political
record for the purpose of assuring the
present Legislature that they could
find no one in Kentucky who had been
a more persistent, consistent and hope
lessly ignorant advocate of depreciated
money, and that therefore he was emi
nently qualified to fill any office to
which he might aspire.
"As the Herald knew of no qualifica
tion which this venerable knight of the
code d*uello possesses as the controller
of the penitentiaries of Kentucky it
confined its condemnation to those quali
ties to which it did have knowledge. It
feels compelled to decline to enter into
private correspondence with this grace
ful wielder of such a facile pen, for
thereby the community wuuld lose the
pleasure of reading his cards.
"The Herald is not an expert in the
code, and it does not know whether
this belligerent letter is a challenge.
If It be a challenge the Herald respect
fully declines to accept it. If it is an
invitation to this venerable leader to
arrange what course may be necessary
and satisfactory to both parties and
that limited upon condition that the
meeting shall be with him, the Herald
respectfully declines. But we suggest
to him that in this pleasant weather
in February, with St. Valentine's day
approaching and with the Legislature
having only thirty days to sit, he turn
his thoughts to sweeter amusement
than shooting, he pray for larger pow
ers of self-control, he get into his mind
the conception that he who enters pol
itics and freely talks of others, and
that not always within the bounds of
accuracy, must expect to have an an
swer made, and that he console him
self with the thought that a life so con
spicuous as his, a career so distin
guished as that which has come to
him and a position so full of influence
as the one he now fills, attracts the
public attention and causes criticism."
Captain Thomas E. Moore dictated
this: "The article bears the marks of
the power behind the throne (Colonel
"W. C. P. Breekinridge), and slander
and abuse being their stock in trade.
I deem the article unworthy of notice.
I am willing for the people of Bourbon
and Fayette counties, and all other
counties in Kentucky, to judge between
me and the record of the party behind
the thrcne in every way."
In course of conversation it cropped
out that the captain has been a sup
porter of Colonel Breckinridge in all
his successful races for Congress; that
he abandoned him when the Pollard
scandal came out, and that the captain
thinks this is the reason Colonel Breek
inridge has so persistently hounded
him in his editorials.

Frank Belew's More
Hopeful View of
His Case.
Persuades Himself That
He Cannot Be Held
Responsible.
Says Something Beyond His
Control Drove Him to the
Awful Crime.
A MOTIVE IS SUGGESTED. |
Love for His Wire May Have Been thÂ«
Cause-Preliminary Exam
ination,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
6UISUN, Feb. 10.â Frank Belew. the
Dlxon poisoner, was in a more cheerful
mood to-day, and believes, notwith
standing his confession, that he alone
is responsible for the death of his sis
ter and brother, that he Will escape
with Imprisonment tor life. He slept
quite peacefully last night, and his ap
petite was greatly improved to-day.
"I cannot understand,"' said he to
day, "why I committed the terrible
crime. Something beyond my control
drove me to it."
It is the general belief of those best
acquainted with Belew that he poi
soned his brother and sister in the hope
uf benefiting from their estates.
"If Belew would only give the motive
for the poisoning," said one of his ac
quaintances last night, "I am certain
that it would be Been that his love for
his wife is at the bottom of the sad af
fair. Mrs. Belew is fend of dress, and
Frank was not able to satisfy her tastes
in that matter. When she left him he
worried over her absence, and my the
ory is that he then concluded that if
he had money she would return to him.
To his narrow mind came the idea thar
the necessary money would be forth
coming after the death of his brother
and sister, and he deliberately planned
to poison them."
Belew will be brought before Justice
Maynard to-morrow morning for a pre
liminary hearing. It is probable that
he will not enter any defense, and will ,
allow the case to rest on the testimony
for the prosecution. He still has hope
that Reese Clark will defend him, but
if Clark has been retained no one here [
knows it.
Belew is anxious to make a good ap
pearance in court, and yesterday sent i
for a barber to shave him. He says .
that he has no intention of attempting
suicide, but notwithstanding his asser
tion Sheriff Rush is keeping a close
watch over him. The prisoner is at
times subject to despondent spells, and
if not guarded might in one of them try
to strangle himself.

AVENGED THE
KILLING OF
DON APARICIO
Oscar Zollinger, a British Subject,
Slew Barrios Because of His
Employer's Tragic Fate.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James GorJon Bennett.
PANAMA, Feb. 10. â Details of the assassination of President Bar
rios of Guatemala have just reached me from the Herald's correspond
ent in Guatemala. These advices state that President Barrios was shot
and killed at 8 o'clock on Tuesday night. The shooting took â  ace near
the palace while the President was walking, accompanied by five
guards. The assassin met the party and stepped off the sidewalk, ap
parently to let the President pass. Then he pushed aside the two men
nearest Sor.or Barrios, thrust a revolver against the President's face and
shot him in the mouth and then In the stomach. The murderer then ran,
but was shot to death by the guards who chased him. Senor Barrios
died in a few minutes.
President Barrios' assassin was 23 years old. For years he was an
employe of Senor Don Juan Aparicio, the well known financier who was
killed by a Government soldier during the revolutionary outbreak last
September while he was held a prisoner. The assassin's name was
Oscar Zollinger. He was a British subject. Senor Aparicio was
wealthy and popular. His death caused great feeling against Presi
dent Barrios, and Zollinger's act was the result. He came to Guatemala
three weeks ago and had presumably been watching for an opportunity
to kill Senor Barrios since his arrival. Zollinger was heavy and mus
cular, and he acted so suddenly that the guards could do nothing. After
the assassination the Foreign Ministers in Guatemala called at the
palace and expressed their regret.
There is little excitement in Guatemala. Manuel Estrada Cabrera,
Vice-President. has assumed theduties of President and will continue as
chief executive until the next election. It is difficult to say what turn
events in Guatemala will take now that the man who only held power by
an iron hand and an indomitable spirit, not by the will of the people,
has been hastened to his end by the hand of an assassin. His death is
the result of his ambition to retain power. Had President Barrios re
tired at th*e end of his legal term, much bloodshed would have been
avoided, as his refusal to do so caused the revolution of September.
He could have retired with a fortune of from $10,000,000 to $12,000,000,
amassed during five years, and with the gratitude of the people, as it
Is admitted even by his enemies that he advanced the country in every
branch. i
There will be a general scramble among all party leaders now for I
the Presidency. General Prospero Morales, with hia great popularity i
and prestige, has a good chance, but It is doubtful if, under the present i
circumstances, he could retain the office unless at the head of (
an army. (
NO ANNEXNTION
THIS SESSION
Treaty Will Be Aban
doned After a Few More
Week's Debate.
Fate of The Morgan Bill Also
Declared Very Uncer
tain.
Speaker Reed In a Position to Kasily
Defeat the Schemes of the
Jobbers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
"Washington, Feb. 10.
The Hawaiian treaty is dead. The
straw vote alleged to have been taken
yesterday was a fake. The annexa
ti<mists lack six votes, and probably
seven. The treaty will probably be
abandoned after a few more week* of
debate. This is the opinion of both
White and Perkins.
The fate of the Morgan bill for an
nexation is uncertain. If it comes to a
vote it may pass, but the chances for
its consideration in the House are re
mote. Speaker Reed is emphatic in his
denunciation of the annexation
scheme. In conversation with a Cali
fornia member of Congress Reed did
not mince his words, but denounced the
proposed annexation as a job of mer
cenary schemers.
The attitude of the administration
does not influence Mr. Reed in the
least. He is a man of positive convic
tions, and as Speaker of the House of
Representatives, with a big Republi
can majority at his back, can easily
defeat the annexation jobbers. He will \
not only have the support of his own ;
party in the House, but nearly all the
Democrats. For these reasons the an- :'
nexationisfc are discouraged, and the i
talk is now that after the vote on the
treaty, a few weeks hence, the annexa
tioa project will be postponed until
next December. This is the opinion of !
Senator White.
GEORGE CLARK TO
PLEAD INSANITY
Futile Effort to Set Aside the
Information Against the
Fratricide.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA. Feb. 10.â The Superior Court to
day overruled a motion of counsel for
defense to set aside the information filed
against George Clark, charged with the
murder of his brother William, on the
ground that he had been brought before
the court upon an illegal process. An
exception to the ruling was taken.
Attorneys for the defense then asked
leave to file a demurrer to the informa
tion upon statutory grounds. The court
granted the request and the demurrer was
argued. The court overruled the same
and another exception was noted.
Attorney Reerstecher then addressed
the court. Ho stated that he wished to
have a commission for the purpose of
taking depositions in the State of Illinois
to be used upon the trial of the case.
Mr. Heerstecher's remarks gave the
keynote as to what the defense will be.
Insanity will be the plea which will be
tirelessly urged with the hope of saving
the fratricide from the gallows. Mr.
Beeretecher stated that in Illinois, where
George W. Clark was born and where his
parent* reside, there were insane asy
lums in which some of George Clark's rel
atives had been cared for.
District Attorney Bell was anxious to
have the case proceed to trial as soon as
possible. The defendant's counsel re
quested delay in order that they might
have opportunity to prepare for trial.
The court set March 8. 1898, at 10 o'clock
a. m., as the time for the trial.
Throughout the entire proceedings in
court this morning Murderer Clark sat
unconcerned. When he left thÂ« court
room he talked with the Bheriff in a
cheerful manner. He walked into his cell
with a light step, and did not appear to
have any fear as to the outcome of the
great legal fight that is about to be made
for him. He stated to The Call reporter
that he did not wish to discuss his case.

SWIFT RUNS
TO HONOLULU
I Remarkable Sailing Time
Made by the Hyde and
Hitchcock.
Death of " Mother" Carter, "Who
Has Resided in Hawaii
Since 1832.
An Incident In Military Discipline and.
Its Bearing on an Alleged Im
pending Revolt
Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Feb. 3.â Not Bince the
days of clipper ship 9 have the perform
ances of the ships Henry B. Hyde and
S. P. Hitchcock, which arrived here on
the 30th and 29th ult., respectively, been
equaled. The Hyde arrived here at
sundown on the 30th, after a sensation
al run of nine days four and one-half
hours from San Francisco, time record
ed from anchorage to anchorage. The
Hitchcock practically made the run In
nine days seven hours. As nearly as
can be learned, but ohe sailing vessel
has ever beaten the record of the Hyde.
She was the famous old clipper ship
Fair Wind, built for speed rather than
for carrying capacity. She is reported
to have made the run in eight days
seventeen hours. But that was long
ago, in the days when speed was con
sidered the most important quality for
an ocean trader and vessels carried
clouds of canvas.
The Hyde is built rather as a carrier
than for speed. When she sailed from
San Francisco on January 21, Captain
Colcord, her new master, was not
thinking of a speedy run, but rather of
making his vessel ready for her long
voyage around the Horn. But when '
the winds blew favorably and the ship
cut the water at regular steamship
speed, he became interested In his work
and put her tÂ« a test. She did some
wonderful work. Her smallest day's
run was 210 miles, and her greatest 290
miles.
On the 29th ult., death claimed a no
| ble woman in the person of Mrs. J. O.
Carter, who passed away quietly In her
88th year. She was reverently known
las "Mother" Carter. Mrs. Carter was
born at Hallowell, Maine, and was the
daughter of John and Hannah Lord,
names of- peculiar interest in the ante
pioneer days of California. She arrived
in Honolulu in 1832, and in the follow
ing year married Captain J. O. Carter,
one of the best known and most promi
nent seafaring men of the Pacific in
the earlier days of Hawaiian history.
She bore six children, one of whom was
H. A. P. Carter, Hawaiian Minister to
Washington, ajid a surviving son is J.
O. Carter, now in Washington repre
senting the cause of the Hawaiians. A
surviving daughter is the wife of Rob
ert Lewers of the prominent firm of
Lewers & Cooke. No less than twenty
eight grandchildren and sixteen great
grandchildren join with the communi
ty In mourning her departure.
An incident in military discipline has
been turned to account by a certain
faction of the more rabid annexation
ists as favoring views of an impending
revolt. It has been found more con
venient for military discipline to re
move the officers of the National Guard
of Hawaii from their former barracks
in the Executive building (the palace)
and to place them in more comfortable
quarters in King Kalakaua's bungalow,
closely adjacent, and to have the men
in charge of their non-commissioned
officers, who in future will be primar
i ily responsible for any breaches of dis
cipline, instead of first worrying the
officers out of their quiet repose to lis
ten to picayunish details which are half
the time condoned out of good nature
This fact, in conjunction with certain
indiscreet and amusingly bloodthirsty
remarks made at a semi-military gath
ering, at which only lithia water, coolly
iced, and ginger ale, delicately spiced
were spilled, and only target "possi
bles" recorded, have been taken ad
vantage of by those who want a whole
fleet of American war vessels stationed
here for the benefit of trade, and the
most baseless rumors have been fabri
cated and ordered to be circulated
abroad. There is no truth in them.

TACOMA, Feb. 10.â Oriental advices
received to-night via Vancouver give
somewhat detailed accounts of the ex
tensive operations being; carried on by |
Japanese troops against Chinese rebels j
in Formosa. Three severe fights have j
taken place, In -which at least 200 reb- j
els have been killed. Many more were i
wounded or taken prisoners.
Governor-General Nagi, the Civil
Chief in authority in Formosa, has been
very ill with malarial fever, leaving
the insular government largely in the
hands of the military authorities, and
the latter have carried out plans which
were being formulated when Nagi be
came sick, relating to offensive meas
ures against the rebels.
The military forces were divided into
three parts and sent against the strong
est bands of rebels in the chief prov
inces. Lieutenant-Colonel Hirooka
headed an expedition against two no
torious leaders posted in the hilly re
gion north of the Kelung River. Their
repeated raids in all directions made
active measures necessary. The ban
dits here melted away before the
troops. Over 100 were killed, their
stronghold captured and further losses
inflicted by systematic scouring of the
hills.
Another force, led by Colonel Tago,
attacked the band at Shokkozan, which
during the early winter kept up dis
turbances around Taihei. Here fifty
more rebels were killed and twenty-five
prisoners taken, including one leader,
and a Japanese garrison was left in the
rebels' quarters.
Simultaneously Lieutenant-Colonel
Mouye became active in the third mili
tary district. Banshin was cleared of
over 200 rebels, several score of whom
were killed and the renmantÃ of this
body were dispersed after another
bloody encounter Â«t Kiucho. This vic
tory, even mure than the others, has
caused great rejoicing, as these rebels,
under two daring chiefs, had carried
out their depredations over a wide area.
The Japanese lost about a doeen killed
and as many wounded during these en
counters. They were well armed, while
the rebels possessed but a few firearms,
which they had smuggled in from the
mainland of China.
A small band of rebels attacked the
prison at Kagi and liberated seventeen
convicts. Three of the police were fa
tally wounded In this outbreak for lib-
erty.
The native Chinese In Formosa have
rebelled against Japanese rule ever
since Japan acquired the >sland. They
are aided and abetted by rich Chinese
at Amoy, China, whose trade with the
rich island has been cut off. The rebel
leaders gain many recruits by spread
ing reports that the Japanese will soon
compel all Chinese islanders to cut off
their queues.
Japan is taking a very firm stand,
and proposes to exterminate every rebel
band, if that is necessary to complete
the subj igatici of Formosa, Travel is
impossible in the interior of Formosa,
which is occupied by 641 tribes num
bering about 100,000 aborigines. Of this
total over 23,000 are reported to belong
to those famine that maintain tattoo
ing and head-hunting as proper prac
tices of mankind.
Santa Clara Defeats Stanford.
SANTA CLARA. Feb. 10.â The first

made were costly. Beckett was steady.
He pave only three bases on balls and
struck out five. Kelly allowed three
bases and struck out two.

General William Booth of London,
founder of the Salvation Army, acted
as chaplain at the opening of the Sen
ate to-day.
Senator Frye secured the passage of
a bill amending the navigation laws in
important particulars affecting the
coasting trade of this country. The bill
is of general application, but it is in
tended especially to prevent Canadian
vessels from securing an undue share
of the carrying business between Alas
kan and other American ports. It will
prevent Canadians gaining part of our
coasting trade.
Considerable discussion arose over an
Xm endment to the Indlan appropriation
pill proposed by the committee provid
ing "that hereafter no Indian or tribe
of Indians shall lease for mining pur
poses lands that are not patented to
said Indians."
In the course of the discussion of an
amendment offered by Thurston,
against which a point of order was
made by Allison, Allen made a sharp
attack upon the Speaker of the House
of Representatives. He declared that
it was impossible to secure the passage
through the House of many meritorious
measures, because one man stood at the
entrance of the cavern into which pro
posed legislation was dumped, and
would permit nothing to be done about
that of^ â¢which he did not approve. He
said: "In the other end of the Capi
tol this one man stands for 828, and his
bold, unwarranted and undignified ac
tion is a disgrace to the Congress and
to the American people."
Frye of Maine said the Senator (Al
len) was himself out of order while
sp.eaking to a point of order.
Allen said he had no desire to violate
the rules, and did not think he had vio
lated them, as he had not referred to
any man by name, nor any particular
end of the Capitol. This was received
with sarcastic laughter by other Sena
tors, and even Allen smiled.
Further along in his remarks Allen
reverted to the power exercised by the
Speaker of the House, declaring that in
view of the impossibility of securing
consideration of meritorious legislation
the truth ought to be known to all the
people in the country. If the truth
hurt or it broke any rules, he was not
responsible.
"I want it understood." said Allen,
"that I hold myself responsible at any
time and in any place for the state
ments I may make or have made on
this subject."
Allison'g point of order was sustained
by the Vice-President.
Allen took an appeal to the Senate
from the Vice-President's ruling. Hoar
moved to lay the appeal on the table.
Allen made the point of no quoruJM,
and a roll call disclosed the presence
of but thirty-nine Senators â not a quo
rum.
The Senate, on motion of Allison, at
5:15 p. m. adjourned.
ROLLCALLS THE ORDER.
Much Filibustering in the House
Over Two Bills of Minor
Importance.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â The House
was in a very bad temper to-day, and
the whole session was consumed in fili
bustering against two bills of minor
importance, one to issue a duplicate
check, and the other to make Roekland,
Maine, a sub-port of entry. Neither got
further than the engrossment ami third
reading. The trouble arose over the
enforcement of the rule against the
discussion of irrelevant subjects, when
Handy, a Democrat of Delaware, at
tempted to reply on the floor during
the consideration of those bills, to a
letter recently written by Thomas F.
Bayard, in denunciation of the free sil
ver Democracy. Roll call followed roll
call all day long, and partisanship
reached a high pitch. Finally, when it
became evident that no progress could
be made with the bills presented, an
adjournment was taken until Monday.

LELA BLISS AND W. S. BALLARD, THE PRIZE WINNERS.
THE baby show at the Mining Fair
yesterday afternoon offered a
study In two phases of human
nature; first, maternal love and
pride, and, secondly, the exten
siveness of the vocabulary from which
fond mothers select names. Fifty-four
girl babies, under 2 years of age, ac
cording to their mothers' statements,
were exhibited, and almost as many
boys. Naturally it was expected that
the girls would outnumber the boys.
The girls were the owners of those
delightful names that have graced the
stage and have been found in thrilling
novels ever since the time of Adam.
There were Bernice, Elma, Hazel, Myr
tle, lone, Bemardine, Velna, Cecilia,
Phelona, Berna, Vivian, Zone,
Dolores, Vera, Irene and Viola. These
were a few of the titles, and there were
many more that were soft sounding,
and as beautiful as the babies them
selves. The boys were a few point-3 shy
on the beauty of cognomens, and Joes,
Jacks, Henrys, Bills, Georges and
Johns made up the general run of the
future Presidents. There was one most
noticeable fact, and it was that among
th^ girls there was not a single Mary.
It is now thought that the popularity
of this name is on the decline.

Can thÂ«.^loo<Â»!Stan*Â»S^<>uoh <^.cld to
Do Goo4^Wlthio\irt3^uxger to
WÂ»3Patient?
Dr, George W. Daywalt's star -seems
to have risen In. the medical world, and
there la no great commotion at the dis
covery. Even the howl that rang In
the ears of Drs. Hlrschfelder and
D'Evelyn when they came forward
with remedies for disease is missing.
Physicians are very guarded In their
expressions on the merit or demerit of
the alleged discovery. Some speak In
its favor, others admit that it may
prove efficacious. Some doubt that Jt
will do good, and others condemn It
in mild terms. The general opinion
seems to be that Daywalt at least has
the benefit of humanity in mind by not
trying to conceal the simplicity of the
remedy.
A thorough canvass of the prominent
physicians of the community yester
day drew forth the following state
ments:
Dr. F. W. d'Evelynâ Any â  effort
which has for Its object the elucidation
of problems affecting life or health is
worthy of cordial encouragement.
These investigations of Dr. Daywalt
are apparently along the lines of anti
septic treatment, yet the experience
gained by me or almost analogous
routine did not give the results which
would justify the conclusion that the
method would at all be classified as a
specific. Presuming the death of the
bacillus, we are not permitted to con
sider the. result -as equivalent to the
cure of consumption. A bacillus is prob
ably as active an irritant ' when dead
as when living, as the toxine result
ing therefrom is still a foreign and
detrimental agent to the vitality of the
lung, tissue, and one of the essential
factors toward the cure of this disease
must be the removal of the secondary
effects of the bacillus and its toxine.
Dr. Jerome Andersonâ l am cautious
in expressing an opinion because all
these things have to be decided by act
ual clinical experiment. There is
nothing strange or impossible in the
theory that boric acid might prove to
be a cure for consumption. It is one
of those remedies that act -by inhibit
ing growth ; rather than by killing the
sera. My bgUef is that in that flej^
The mothers were a study them
selves. They could not see any baby
but their own, and while from their
countenances there beamed much ma
ternal love, there was also the most
vindictive Jealousy. Only two pairs of
twins were to be found in the city, and
upon this proposition the giris and
boys had an even thing of it. The trip
lets failed to materialize, and the man
agement did not have to give the *20
gold piece that they offered for the
triple spray of young humanity.
Three prizes were given for the hand
somest girl babies, and three for the
boys. There were also some extra prizes
for special attractions in the baby line,
and a consolation list for those babies
who got nothing, and whose mothers
thought differently upon the subject.
This was a wise precaution upon the
part of the management, and as it was
the secretary, Joseph Cummings, bare
ly escaped with his life in his endeav
ors to settle with the disappointed mat
rons, who poured into his office after
the show to try to explain how it was
that the judges did not see Luclle's or
Johnny's charms, as the case happened
to be. Messrs. Hynemann, Neal and
Barrington, the judges, made a rapid
exit as soon as their decisions were an
nounced.
The successful contestants were:
Handsomest girl, first, Lela Bliss; sec
lies great hope. In certain diseases, as
In diphtheria, if you try to kill the
germ you may kill the patient. In
flammation always gives the microbe
an easier time of it- Pprsonally Dr.
Day wait Is a live, intelligent physi
cian and a thinker. I regard his inves
tigations very favorably.
Dr. "Williamson â As I am not on the
committee of ethics of the County-
Medical Society I am not in a position
to talk. I have not read the article
carefully, but believe there may be a
possibility of success in the use of
boric acid for! tuberculosis.
Dr. J. F. Morse â There can be no
question that the medical profession
would welcome any remedy which
might prove efficacious in battling
â with tuberculosis. It has called forth
repeated efforts on the part of medical
men to discover some treatment for its
cure. I do not believe that any of the
recent advertised remedies will prove
themselves any longer lived than those
that have gone before.
Dr. F. S. Cookâ The experiment of In
troducing an agent into the human
body of sufficient strength to destroy
or render innocuous the different dis
ease producing germs or bacilli is all
the rage In medical circles the world
over. The one statement that by "ac
tual experiment it required a certain
percentage strength of the destroying
agent to produce such result," it seems
to me should, when seriously consid

ing the possibilities of her magnificent voice, urged her to leave the Boston
ians and procure some new opera in which she might star, supported by a
company of her own.
The idea found great favor with Miss Nielsen, but, owing to financial dif
ficulties that stood in the way, she was unable to act on it. Finally, after
the matter had been debated for some time, she consented to an arrangement,
whereby Mr. Williams would furnish the necessary capital to have an opera
written especially for her and enable her to organize and bring out a company
of her own. Last October negotiations were entered into with Victor Her
bert of New York, the composer of "The Serenade," the opera at present be
ing sung by the Bostonians, with the result that he is now engaged in the
composition of another light opera, very similar in character to "The Sere
nade," which he hopes to finish in time to allow Miss Nielsen to open in it
at the beginning of next winter's seison in New York.
Miss Nielsen will continue with the Bostonians until the conclusion of the
present season, when she will sever her connection with that company, carry
ing with her Eugene Cowles, the celebrated basso, who will join her in her
contemplated venture, together with her sister Hortense, at present studying
in this city. The manager of the new company has not been finally, decided
upon, but in Ail probability it will be Mr. Fraak Pearly,

Both in the afternoon and at nisrht
Captain John Holtum gave an exhibi
tion of juggling with heavy cannon
balls, catching one fired from a cannon.
His jugglery is truly a marvelous ex
hibition of strength, and every motion
that he makes with the heavy balls is
full of grace. The catching of the ball
from the cannon evoked great ap
plause. Captain Holtum after he
catches the ball loads the cannon again
and fires it from his shoulder. He will
be put on again to-morrow night by
the management, and he has posted
$100 challenge for any man who will
catch the ball from the cannon.
The three features for to-day and to
night are the Martels, "The Battle of
Gettysburg" and the fact that every
lady who visits the fair will receive as
a souvenir a dainty cup and saucer.
To-morrow being the anniversary of
ered, prevent unnecessary labor which
is being expended in that direction.
The desired thing is to produce or
discover some agent sufficiently innoc
uous so that it can be introduced in
sufficient quantity or quantities to
make the human body represent a solu
tion of the strength predetermined in
laboratorical research without destroy
ing the tissues of the body itselC The
remedy is doubtful.
Dr. A. P. Woodward, president of the
San Francisco County Medical Society
â Until the boric acid treatment has
been thoroughly tested, scientifically,
I do not wish to express myself as be
ing in favor of or against Its use. So
far all the so-called treatments for the
cure of tuberculosis have failed, those
of recent date being as .short-lived as
the more ancient remedies.
Dr. C. F. Buckleyâ The question of
curing consumption by any method is
one of the most engrossing before the
medical profession throughout the
world to-day. I have no doubt science
will reach the desired goal in due time.
I have been making experiments in
this direction for the past three years.
The only active quality Dr. Hirschfeld
er's aseptaline can possibly possess lies
in the 5 per cent of boric acid, which
is the last addition of his solution. This
I pointed out to my medical friends be
fore I wrote anything on the subject,
because in my sterilization experiments
I found this chemical one of the most

powerful germicides known.
My friend Dr. Henry Gibbons in one
of the Eastern journals, gives a num
ber of cases successfully treated by the
local nostrums, and points out that the
bacillus is readily destroyed by It on
the experimental table. This is highly
scientific! Did it not occur to him that
the 5 per cent solution of boric acid
would readily achieve the same purpose
without the veal broth? The injection
of boric acid into thp circulation is not
as free from risk as a new medical
philosopher claims.
Dr. W. F. McNuttâ l do not think the
remedy scientific. First, we have to
find out how much boric acid is re
quired to do what Daywalt claims. It
has never been demonstrated in any
scientific laboratory that the blood
could stand it in sufficient quantity to
destroy the germ without killing the
patient. When that is shown then the
profession will have faith in the rem
edy. Quinine is good for malaria sim
ply because the body can stand, with
out injury, enough of it to kill the
microbe. Can the body stand enough
boric acid to kill the consumption germ
without dire risk of immediate death?
UNIVERSITY LOSES A BEQUEST.
Judge Coffey Decides That Money
Left It Must Go the Next of Kin
Judge Coffey rendered a decision yester
day which will cut off the University of
California from receiving a bequest
amounting to nearly $4000. Herman
Royer, at the time of making his will,
thought himself possessed of a large
amount of worldly goods, and made a
clause in it for the establishing of a pro
fessorship of political economy at Berk
eley. When the executors came to ad
minister the estate they found that liti
gation and losses had lessened his for
tune, and but a small amount remained
Joseph Leggett was appointed attorney
for the absent heirs, and objected to the
university receiving the monfy, on techni
cal grounds. Judge Coffey sided with Mr.
Leggett, and yesterday delivered an
opinion, in which he said: "I am of tne
opinion that the I nivorsity of California
is incapable of taking the bequest men
tioned in the will of the decedent, as the
bequest has wholly failed, and that the
whole of the residue should be distributed
to the next of kin."
PROMINENT GERMAN DEAD.
Andrew Kusteberg Passes Away
After a Lingering Illness of
Four Months.
Andrew Rusteberg, a prominent Ger
man musician of 1 this city, aged 62 years,
died at his residence, 2705 Folsom street!
at S:3O o'clock last night after a lingering
illness of several months.
The deceased was a native of Germany
but had lived here for the past thirty-five
years. He was most prominently iden
fied with the Vereln Elntracht, and will
be buried from its hall at 2 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. All the German bands
will attend the funeral and the interment
will be in Odd Fellows' Cemetery The
deceased leaves several children. He was
a noted trumpet player and had played
with the greatest artists that have visited
this country. Mr. Rusteberg was a man
who had traveled extensively and was
possessed of a wonderful fund of informa
tion. The news of his death will be a
great source of sorrow to his many
friends.
SOME NOTED GREYHOUNDS.
Dr. Yon Hummell, the famous coursing
enthusiast of Philadelphia, who visited
this coast seven years ago, arrived here
yesterday from Los Angeles with a string
of dogs, namely: Just. Eclipse, Chit Chat,
Van Tralee, Van Brulle, Van Cloie, Van
Manle, Van Nida and Van Knapp. As may
be seen, the Vans are well represented.
While in Los Angeles the doctor sold
Breach of Promise, a first-class dog.
He arrived here purposely to condition
his charges for the great interstate meet
ing which will be held at Ingleside Cours
ing Park on the 22d inst. The doctor stated
that he expected to see some noted East
ern coursing men here in time to witness
the meeting between the crack dogs of the
East and West.
J. Lynch, the local coursing enthusiast,
who was mentioned last week as having
purchased a kennel of Eastern dogs, re
ceived last evening from J. A. Graham of
St. Louis the following dogs: Decota. by
Glenkirkâ Gilda; Mystic Maid, by Millers
Rabâ Lady Pembrook; and two very
pretty saplings by imported Astronomy-
Mystic Maid.

A Stringent Order by the Surveyor
of the Port to Keep Him on
Board Until Released.
In accordance with Instructions re
ceived from Collector Jackson, Sur
veyor of the Port Spear issued an or
der yesterday that will neutralize fu
ture attempts of State Quarantine Offi
cer Chalmers to interfere with the du
ties of Federal Quarantine Officer
Rosenau. The order commands board
ing officers to enforce strictly the quar
antine rules requiring all persons who
board incoming vessels to remain on
board until after the Federal quaran
tine officer shall have performed the
duties of his office and given tljg ves
sel free pratique. The order defines
"all persons" as Federal officers, cus
toms inspectors. United States mar
shals and "all others."
"All others" will include Dr. Chal
mers and representatives of his office.
If the doctor boards .a vessel subject
to quarantine he will be forcibly de
tained on board unless he should exhib
it an intention of Jumping overboard
and swimming ashore. He and the re
mainder of "all others" will be detained
until the passengers have been fumi
gated.
When the Peru arrived here a few
weeks ago with President Dole on
board Dr. Chalmers acted in a manner
that was construed as officious by the
Federal officials, and in giving free pra
tique to the vessel they say that he cer
tified not only that the laws of the
State, but of the United States, had
been complied with. The Federal offi
cials immediately concerned say that
the quarantine regulations of the
United States had not been compiled
with because the examination was
made at night when the regulations
provide that it must be made by day
light.
Dr. Chalmers' action in the matter
was reported to Collector Jackson, and
he wrote a letter to the Secretary of
the Treasury, laying all the facts be
fore him. A reply was received a day
or two ago, and the Collector was ad
vised of his rights in case the State
quarantine officer ventured to interfere
with the Federal quarantine officer in
the performance of his duties as such.
Surveyor Spear was notified, and his
stringent order of yesterday was the
result.
BIDS FOR THE
SAN PEDRO HARBOR
Seventeen Contractors Are
Anxious to Work, for the
Government.
The Lowest Bidder "Will Not Be
Determined Until
To-Day.
Bids for the breakwater of the San Pe
dro harbor were opened yesterday at
noon In the office of Major Charles E. L.
B. Davis of the United States Engineers
Corps, In the Flood building. The rep
resentatives of the competing firms were
present and seventeen bids were offered.
According to the specifications for the
construction of the breakwater, each bid
is subdivided so as to constitute a sep
arate bid upon each piece of work. The
specifications asked bids on 136,020 long
tons of stone for the foundation, 1,933,603
tons on the substructure, 221,025 tons on
the superstructure and 2370 cubic yards
of concrete work. Bids were also invited
on rock from the quarries of the bidders
and on San Clemente rock.
Much interest was manifested as Major
Davis read the figures, which were care
fully recorded by his assi3tants. One no
ticeable fact was that where the contrac
tors bid on the rock from San Clemente
there was a marked reduction. The gen
eral supposition is that the regular rule
will be followed and the bid awarded to
the lowest bidder; and to determine who
is the lowest bidder will take until this
evening, for the amounts in each bid
have to be multiplied by the figures
called for in the specifications, and this
has to be done on each separate piece of
The final disposition of the matter will
depend largely upon the bond offered by
the successful firm. When the lowest
bidder has been determined, Major Davis
will forward a recommendation that the
contract be awarded to that bidder, but
the final action in the matter rests en
tirely with the Secretary of War.
The following were the bids submitted
yesterday:

CHEF WILLIAMS
IN DISGRACE
Caught in the Act of Ac
cepting Money From
a Prisoner.
He Is Made to Disgorge and
Ordered to Remain in the
Kitchen.
Another Scandal In the Culinary
Department of the City
Prison.
Harry Williams, the chef of the City
Prison is in disgrace. He was caught
yesterday in the act of accepting
money from a prisoner who wanted an
extra plate of "hash."
Williams is the individual who seems
determined to starve the inmates of the
City Prison unless they pay him for his
trouble. Since the publication in The
Call of the queer methods of Williams,
Chief Lees has instructed the City
Prison officials to keep a close watch
on him. Determined to catch him at
his tricks of "bleeding" the unfortun
ate men confined in the prison, the of
ficials took a prisoner into their confi
dence for the purpose of obtaining suf
ficient evidence against the scheming
cook. The prisoner was given 50 cents
and as Williams passed down the cor
! ridor dealing out the meagre rations to
the occupants of the cells the former
called him. He told him he had money
i and offered him the 50 cents ir he would
| bring him an extra plate of "hash."' The
cook readily fell into the trap, and
after taking the money he started for
| the kitchen to get the extra "dish.^
I Just then one of the prison officials who
I had been apprised of the transaction
I held up Williams and compelled him
! to return the money to the prisoner.
After being severely reprimanded for
his despicable methods, Williams was
ordered into the kitchen a.nd told not
to leave it until his term of sentence
was up. The prison dishwasher now
| feeds the prisoners, much to fche hu
: miliatlon of the convict cook.

JUSTICE CARROLL
IS THREATENED
A Long Delayed Judg
ment the Cause of
the Trouble.
He Received Money and Holds
It for Six Months and
Over.
Justice of the Peace John A. Carroll
has been threatened with criminal pro
ceedings because he fails and refuses
to either return money deposited with
him in a case in his court or to render
judgment in the litigation.
About a year ago J. H. Lichenstein,
the pawnbroker, paid a deposit of $250
with the real estate firm of McAfee
Bros, as a deposit on the price of a
piece of real estate that he thought of
purchasing. Later the bargain palled
on him, and he demanded the return
of his deposit, meeting with a refusal
from the dealers. Then Lichenstein
sued in the Justice Court for the re
turn of his money. Before the case
went to trial the property was sold to
a third party, and McAfee Bros, had
the name of the original owner, a
young man named Murphy, substituted
as defendant. When the case was
called before Justice Carroll that official
ordered that the amount sued for be
paid into court, and Murphy made the
deposit as required. Such deposits are
usually made with the clerk of the
court, but In this case the money was
accepted and receipted for by the court
itself.
The case went to trial six months ago
and was taken under advisement by
Justice Carroll. Since then repeated
demands have been made by the de
fendant for a judgment so that the
money could either be drawn down or
used to satisfy the judgment, but Jus
tice Carroll has refused to heed the de
mand.
Murphy and the friends whom he
consulted have told Justice Carroll that
â  the judgment must be rendered, but he
I has delayed the matter on various ex-
I cuses until their patience is about ex-
I hausted, and they have about decided
to apply to the courts for redress.
Justice Carroll is known to be in bad
financial straits, but he promises to
I render judgment and pay over the
> money at an early date.
An excited altercation over the mat
j ter took place between Justice Carroll
! and Thomas S. Mulvey, a friend of the
I defendant, in a downtown saloon yes-
I terday, and the latter threatened pro-
I ceedings against Carroll unless some
! thing was done at once.

CRUEL RUSE TO
FOOL THE HEN
Trying to Extort Extra Eggs by
Means of Trick, and
Device.
Ben True Tells of the Scheme of
Inventor Bridenbeeker, but Does
Not Openly Indorse It.
Ben True has been a detective so long
that his professional instincts are ever
alert. He likes to search out the un
knowable secret and clear away the im
penetrable mystery. Mr. True has been
visiting the Atlantic coast. It was a long
way from home, but he took his profes
sional habit with him and kept on the
lookout for something new. He comes
back convinced that he has found it.
The novelty is designed to bamboozle
the domestic hen. The genius who con
trived it is named Bridenbecker, and
feathered generations yet unborn will
rise up on the barnyard fence to call him
not blessed. The iniquity of the "cold
deck" is nothing to what Bridenbecker has
rung in on the industrious fowl. He wants
her to work overtime.
Bridenbecker has devised a nest having
a false and fleeting bottom, which, under
the weight of an egg automatically
opens, letting the egg through and out of
sight. Her duty done, the hen turns
around to observe the product of her toll
and beholds an empty nest. She blush
ingly stifles a half formulated cackle and
goes on the nest again, of course with %
similar result. Bridenbecker has made a
study of the hen and brought to the task
uj. intellect almost equal to the hen's.
He is confident that she will lay three
eggs in constant succession before going
away to lay a complaint on the table of
the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Poultry. By the next day she will
have forgotten the experience and be
ready to repeat it.
Mr. True does not say he has absolute
faith in the Bridenbecker idea, and yet
he may have, for a proposal to try th*Â»
machine on the goose that lays the golden
eggs seems to strike him favorably.
No Diseased Cattle Wanted.
The Municipal Council of Apia. Samoa,
has passed an ordinance requiring all im
porters of horses, cattle or sheep into
that country to furnish a certificate of
the good health of the stock, the inspec
tion to be made at the last port of ship
ment.

THE HOMICIDAL SUICIDE.
/"~* LEVELAND has a chance to show whether a
L man of morbid tendencies has a right to kill
himself when the operation involves the carry
ing off of people whose inclinations have not been
consulted. Just because oneindividual happensto have
chronic indigestion is no logical excuse for his treat
ing his malady with a remedy so comprehensive as to
take in every one in the vicinity. In illustration of
this point may be cited the case of a Cleveland man
with a wife and nine children. The man was not of
a happy disposition. The world had palled. The
prattling of infants did not soothe him. The other
morning the entire tribe was found unconscious from
the effects of gas. Many of them will die. The fel
low who turned on the gas, however, deserves to live
until certain preliminaries can be attended to, and
then he ought to hang on a gallows of extra height.
Certainly he could not object. He pines for death,
and death by hanging lias many advantages over the
same thing by gas. The State pays the expense and
the estate is not cinched for the cost of the destroying
fluid measured off by an active meter.
STILL GROPING IN ERROR.
THE Chronicle sees in the annexation treaty as
its chief merit that "it is designed to open up a
wide field of enterprise for white men now un
occupied because of Asiatics."
While the meaning of this is obscure, like the
meaning of all utterances on that subject by the an
nexation press, we take it to be that at present Asiat
ics, principally Japanese, hold the laborfield in Hawaii
against all comers. We should think that ardent an
nexationists would express regret that the Dole Gov
ernment, in the nearly five years it has been in power,
has not freed the islands from the Asiatics and proved
that the plantations can be worked by white labor.
As we have pointed out, Dole has been supreme.
None could defeat or obstruct any policy he chose to
follow. If white men could have worked the planta
tions he should have proved it. What his acts have
failed to establish cannot now be made sure I . a
paragraph in the Chronicle. Dole's mission to Wash
ington has been accomplished. It was to make sure
the right of the planters to import Japanese coolies.
They are being landed in Honolulu now in shiploads
of 500. Hundreds of thousands of acres of virgin
sugar lands will be planted immediately upon annex
ation, and the planters are taking time by the fore
lock in importing their coolie labor.
We have asked the Chronicle to point out any place
in the world where sugar cane is raised by free white
labor, at white wages, and it has not found such a
place.
We state it as a fact irrefutable that the only sugar
ever produced by white labor at white wages is beet
sugar. Annexation means that American beet sugar
is to be sacrificed to' the cane sugar and coolie labor
of Hawaii.
No one has yet quoted anything from the annexa
tion treaty that disproves this, because it is not there
to quote. But Mr. Dole was not content with the
negative permission of coolie labor in that Janus
faced document, and the object of his trip here was to
make a side bargain that leaves Hawaii permanently
open to Japan.
Somebody has written in the Stockton Mail an
able editorial in denunciation of the vagrancy Jaw.
The article calls this law a blot upon the statute
book. It is exactly this. Under its benign provision
any man out of work and seeking it is likely to be
thrown into a jail, for the sake of the arresting offi
cer's fee, and when released to have a similar ex
perience with the next constable who happens to see
him. The law as it stands is not only unjust, but
ridiculous, and in all probability a test would show
it to be unconstitutional.
With every appearance of frankness the Stockton
papers are calling attention to the fact that there is
corruption in San Francisco. Their information does
not come as a surprise. Indeed it merely gives rise
to a belief that they have been reading The Call,
which has lately contained several remarks on the
subject. In fact, there seems to have been so much
corruption here that the importation of an extra lot
from Stockton was clearly superfluous.
Circumstances would look brighter for the Dep
uty Sheriffs on trial for killing strikers in Pennsyl
vania if the men had not all been shot in the back.
While it may be true that a striker is sometimes a
dangerous man, when he is engaged in running away
the excuse for sending a bullet after him does not
stand forth impressive and final.
Mr. Lynn of Oakland can hardly hope to convince
the world that the Lord told him to kill Mrs. Lynn,
but if he can succeed in making the world think he
believes he got such an order it will be a good move
*o his game

the Hon. Sackville West in 1888.
The offenses of these two diplomats are mild,
however, in comparison with the attack of foot and
I mouth disease which undid the Citizen Genet, sent
here as the Minister of France in the midst of the
i French revolution. He landed at Charleston and
I seemed to assume that he was sent here to order us
!to arms to fight for France. He found the people
ready to shout and immediately began issuing proc
: lamations, holding public meetings and making
1 speeches, before presenting his credentials to the
President. Seen in the perspective of nearly a cen
tury the affair is merely fantastic and funny, but it is
probable that no other country was ever put under
such a peculiar strain as that to which the French
man subjected this. He freely criticized the Presi
dent and Secretary of State, and acted as if he had it
in mind to depose the administration and take charge
v: the country himself, following the method by
which Bonaparte was in the habit of unseating
kings and putting in their places his brothers and
brothers-in-law. Citizen Genet was finally sup
pressed and sent home, foaming at the mouth, and
was not heard of again. Compared with him Sack
ville West and De Lome were models of prudence,
though one iet himself be tricked by a decoy letter
into writing about the domestic affairs of this country
and the other has permitted his resentment and
anger to get the better of his discretion, and the
wrestle was not hard, for his discretion is not robust.
His Spanish countrymen who compose the Cuban
Junta have a perfectly clear comprehension of the sit
uation. They counted with certainty upon their
ability to goad him into making a false step and ex
posing him in it, and they have succeeded.
The incident gives rise to some inquiry into the re
lations of the United States to diplomacy and our in
ternational relations. The Senate is part of the ex
ecutive when treaties are made, and comes" directly
in contact as such with the representatives of foreign
Governments.
Members of the Senate have not recently sought
to butter their diplomatic parsnips with soft words in
their characterizations of the Spanish Government
and people. Spain has been openly abused and de
rided, and everything from the Inquisition to the
quality of Havana cigars has been riung in her face.
One Senator deliberately said that she was a nation
of thieves and robbers. The epithetic and invective
resources of our language have been pumped dry for
verbal ammunition to use against the Dons. It may
be hard to convince foreigners that Senators who
show such violent prejudice and express it in such
violent language, as legislators, can enter the secret
session and sit with diplomatic fairness and courtesy
over international matters with the same country
whose people they have publicly denounced. De Lome
seems to have been unable to comprehend this. His
country needed in his place a man incapable of being
affected in his temper by the almost daily violence
and abuse in Congress. Perhaps the fact that hv was
not such a man, and that he will be probably suc
ceeded by one like himself, is evidence of the weak
ness and decay of Spain and proof that fate is not
fighting on her side.
EXCESSIVE CANADIAN ENTERPRISE.
CANADIAN enterprise has undertaken to con
struct to Dawson a railway line which, accord
ing to its promoters, is to be wholly on Cana
dian territory. The proposal has a certain noble
sound that has won admiration, but it will bear
watching. It is possible the enterprise may be one
iof the kind that overleaps itself. Canada may have
i undertaken more than she can accomplish.
A railroad starting from any Canadian point and
j running to Dawson through British Columbia wouKl
i be extremely costly, and the line would be so long
that years would be required to construct it. The only
, way to make a short line capable of speedy construe-
I tion would be to start from some point on the sea
j coast opposite the Yukon Valley, but It is more than
J doubtful if Canada possesses any point 6O situated as
| to be available for the purpose.
No less than five routes have been suggested and
discussed in connection with the proposed enterprise.
. Three of these are, designed to make the starting
'i place at some point on the Lynn Canal, a fourth
I starts from Taku Inlet, and the fifth, which according
\to late reports has been almost decided upon, is to
j make the point of departure from the sea at Stickeen
River. By either of these routes a comparatively
short line would reach the headwaters of the Yukon
I Valley, and the construction could probably be com
pleted as proposed within a year.
There is on one and all of these short routes, how
ever, a difficulty which the enterprising Canadians
i have either overlooked or chosen to ignore. The
j United States lays claim to all that portion of the
< Alaskan coast. It is true the boundary of that part
! of Alaska has not bÂ«en surveyed and determined by
the two Governments and Canada may possibly have
; a water front at the Stickeen, but the chances are
; the territory around the mouth of that river for at
least twenty miles back belongs to the United States.
i If this claim be found correct when the official sur
j vey is made, what will become of the "all Cana
i dian" route?
The American people admire enterprise. They
have noted with admiration the swiftness of the Can
; adians to seize everything within their reach on this
! coast from the soil of Alaska to the seals that swim
in the sea. Admiration, however, does not imply a
willingness to yield to the admirable object. It not
j infrequently excites emulation and desire to set up as
j a rival. If the Canadians in their eagerness to get an
j all Canadian route to the Yukon should take posses-
I sion of territory that belongs to us, we may feel so
moved by admiration of the enterprise as to set forth
I and take our coast line back again and the whole
j Yukon Valley along with it.
Another cure for consumption has appeared and
will be welcomed. The world is perfectly willing that
this disease shall be exterminated, and has boundless
faith. The latest cure has advantages not to be
claimed by its predecessors. In the first place, it is
not enwrapped in mystery, and it is not produced by
incantations only effective if conducted with the
moon in a certain quarter. If borax is fatal to the
bacilli of tuberculosis any man with lungs only
partly caved in can go into the desert with a shovel
and scoop enough of the remedy up to insure him
such a dose of longevity that he may get tired of it.
It would appear that a man intent upon committing
a cold-blooded murder should first take a few drinks.
Then a jury will pity him for having been led into
error and decline to treat him to the hanging he
really deserves.
That Horace Boies of lowa should be in favor of a
new policy is not surprising. A policy which fails to
bring him prominently to the front is naturally de
fective in the eyes of Mr. Boies.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1898.
\A ONUMENTAL nerve may always be expected
/ \ from corporations. Having no souls these crea
tions of the law are furnished with an assur
ance which, measured by the ordinary arithmetical
rules, runs into figures too vast to be comprehended
by the human mind.
In the production of corporation nerve the glorious
climate of California stands first in the world. Our
corporations have long worn the belt for the cool
ness with which they put forward what used to be
known on the sand lot as "thieving propositions,"
But no exhibition of corporation nerve ever pre
sented to the people of this city has exceeded in mag
nitude the recent application of the Spring Valley
Water Works to the Board of Supervisors for au
thority to increase water charges. To understand this
proposition it is not necessary to inquire as to the
rate of interest paid by the corporation to its stock
holders, nor as to the water in its capital stock, nor
as to the character of its management, which, we be
lieve, even by its enemies, is admitted to be excel
lent.
What the outside investigator would like to know
is the theory on which President Howard argues that
the people of San Francisco ought to provide money
for "new construction." If the people are to con
tinue to pay for putting in pipe lines and building
reservoirs, is it not about time that they should be
allowed interest on their investment? If the stock
holders of the Spring Valley Water Works cannot
provide against the danger of dry seasons and re
plenish their water system as fast as it wears out, on
what reasonable ground can they demand that the
ratepayers shall allow them 6 per cent on their al
leged investment?
The Call does not sympathize with the constant en
deavors of the demagogues to create public preju
dice against corporations. As a rule we think the
purpose of most assaults on what the politicians call
the "public utilities" is blackmail and political plun
der. But it is just such things as this demand on the
Supervisors by Spring Valley for an increase in
water rates which gives the blackmailers their handles.
For years President Howard has been assuring the
public that if it would only help him build the
Crystal Springs reservoir he would put a water famine
forever behind him. Yet the first chance he gets he
comes forward with an alarming story about the
tardy rain and a plaintive appeal for more money
with which to make his water supply more secure.
Under no circumstances whatever should the Su
pervisors increase water rates. If the stockholders of
Spring Valley desire to improve their supply system
they should provide the money themselves or author
ize their board of directors to increase the capital of
the corporation and sell shares to raise the amount.
The most they can ask the ratepayers to do is to
liquidate operating expenses, pay interest on the
company's debt and allow a fair dividend on the
actual capital invested. Not a dollar of the people's
money can be justly expended on "new construc
tion" or in rejuvenation of the plant.
AN INTERESTING CONTEMPORARY.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Congressional
Record, is too often regarded by the general
public as a mere depository for political bun
combe and thrown into the waste basket without
further ado. This rude treatment it does not always
deserve. Occasionally it contains a good deal in the
way of poetry and general criticism, and on such oc
casions repays attention as well :h merits it.
The issue of the Record for January 27 is an in
stance in point. Take this as a sample of poetry
suitable for quotation in debate on the great issues of
the day:
O Mammoth Care, what a spot â
In summer cold, in winter hot.
Oh, what an awful wonder!
Hell and damnation gone to thunder!
The meaning, moral and significance of the verse
are so clear and so suggestive to the mind, it is
hardly necessary to say it was used to illustrate a point
raised during a debate on an appropriation bill for
the District of Columbia. It is to that section of the
Union and to that subject only that such a verse
could be made to apply without losing dignity and
becoming absurd.
Even more interesting than the poetry of the num
ber is the criticism it contains on certain newspapers
in the city of New York. The future historian of
journalism in America who turns to the Record to
find expression of contemporaneous opinion on cer
tain phases of the journalism of the day will find
printed in this issue a memorial from a Grand Army
post in Kansas, which sets forth that opinion with a
degree of force sufficient to maintain its vitality for
years to come.
The memorial says of Harper's Weekly: "It has
always been a disloyal sheet; its patriotism has been
but salt to savor its disunion sentiments. It is at all
times Tory, and if ever a loyal word crept into that
paper it was pure commerce and nothing more. It
panders to the English population in New York and
London and desires the approval of foreigners rather
than the esteem of its own countrymen."
Turning next to the New York World the gentle
course of candid criticism continues: "The World
is a degenerate; each column is a prostitute, and the
laborer on it is worthy of his hire. It knows neither
loyalty, decency or morals." After that comes the
turn of the New York Journal, and the criticism pro
ceeds: "The Journal has the ability to imitate the
vices of its greater contemporary for rot, and neither
understands nor comprehends what it took in men
and money to preserve this country."
It is not worth while to make further quotations.
The extracts given are sufficient to prove the state
ment that the Record is sometimes interesting. Being
an official publication, it is not liable to suits for
libel, and its criticisms therefore are at times as can
did as truth itself, while its poetry, freed from the su
pervision of unpoetic souls, attains a flight that
"would have made Quintilian gasp and stare."
Somehow the United States Supreme Court has not
been educated up to the idea that the natural conclu
sion to be derived from the fact that r murderer ha?
been condemned is that he ought to be set free. Cali
fornia lawyers might do some missionary work in the
national capital.
At this distance it is impossible to have a firmly
grounded opinion of the justice of the verdict against
Luetgert in Chicago. Ordinarily, however, a jury
before convicting a man of murder wants to be rea
sonably certain that somebody is dead.
De Lome has some good points. The celerity with
which he seyt in his resignation shows that when a
house falls on him he has a firm grasp of the fact that
something has happened.
There will be much regret over the fact that Roche
fort must go to jail. But the world is sometimes
generous to a man who is down. It will concede to
Rochefort a monopoly of this regret.

CALL.
ONE of the most heart stirring scenes in the world Is the departure of troops
from home to the seat of war. A San Francisco girl has just returned from
Spain, where she went to be educated, and in graphic way, breathing the
enthusiasm of youth, she describes the exciting embarkation of 5000 Spanish
soldiers bound for Cuba. They passed before the little King and his mother, the
Queen, while the archbishop on a raised altar blessed them. It was a heart-moving
scene, and nearly every woman present was In' black and sobbed violentlyâ and
you'll realize why if you read the story.
Every man doesn't tell his troubles to a policeman. If you don't believe it read
the lively heart pangs on disastrous occasions that befell Artists Keith, Strong,
Stanton, Joullin, Latimer, Ciawson, Jorgensen, Cadenasso, Dobbertin, Brewer and
Robinson. The tough trials of the argonauts struggling to reach California were as
nothing compared with what they experienced in scaling the Olympian heights of
art. How they suffered, why they suffered and what they suffered and what a piti
less brother artist thinks of their pathetic tales of "hard luck" is graphically set
forth with crayon and typewriter

DAN CUPID'S JUBILEE DAY,
COULD dear good Saint "Valentine
have peeped through the centuries
and in real eaint-like fashion have
been favored with the revelation
that in future ages his name was
to be linked with true lovers' knots,
courtship and marriage, he might possi
bly have entered a mild protest; for there
was nothing particularly romantic in his
own life and history. Saint Valentine
was simply a presbyter of the church,
and was noted for his love and charity.
He suffered martyrdom under the Em
peror Claudius about the year 270. Such
Is his brief history, and in searching the
legends associated with his name there is
no occurrence in his entire life that could
possibly have given rise to the practices
prevalent on Valentine's day. Butler,
however, in his "Lives of the Saints," re
marks that there was a superstitious cus
tom among the pagans for boys to draw
the names of girls in honor of the hea
then goddess Februata Juno on the
14th day of February, and that when
tho pagans became Christians the Ro
man clergy substituted in place of the
girls' names the names of saints for
the billets drawn on this day. Be this as
it may, the valentine has played a con
spicuous part in love and courtship, and
in the language of sweethearts the ex
prettlon, "Thou art my Valentine!" has
ever meant the world over "Thou art my
love!" Indeed, nature herself, seems tb
have sanction. -.1 this popular custom, for
In olden times there was cherished a ru
ral tradition that on this day every bird
cbooaefl its man-, to which belief Shake-
Bpeare in his "Midsummer Night's
Dream" happily alludes: "Saint Valen
tino is past; begin these woodbirds but to
couple now?"
The valentine has ever bÂ«en a theme for
poet unil author, and Goldsmith in his
chiirming tale of "The Vicar of Wake
lit Id" describes how the rustic swains
sent true-love knots on Valentine morn
ing. Gay's poetic description of some ru
ral ceremonies observed on this day is
prettily given in the following verses:
"Last Valentine, the day when birds of
kind
Their paramours with mutual chirping
I early rose, just at the break of day,
Bi fore the sun had chased the stars
away;
Afield I went, amid the morning dew,
To milk my kine (for so should house
wives do).
Thee iirst I spied, and the first nwain we
see
In spite of Fortune shall our true love
be."
The art valentines this year are fanciful
and dainty. A charming one is in the
form of a fan, each stick bearing a stan
za of an old-fashioned love lyric. An
other is a kite, to the tail of which cling
several fat, pink cupids, a cloud of these
diminutive mischief-makers floating across
the white surface of the kite itself. . The
verse which accompanies this flight of
fancyâ no pun intendÂ«dâ brief, but to
the point:
My love's a kite,
'Twill ne'er take wing,
Because, sweetheart.
You hold the string.
In the center of a wreath of rosebuds
one reads:
one touch from you
My heart will open wide,
And my sweetheart
You'll Bee insile.
On pulling a pink ribbon the poetry dis
appears, disclosing a mirror wreathed in
roses. Beautiful little water color draw
ings of dainty dames and courtly cava
liers in the picturesque costumes of long
ago adorn the covers, which inclose am
orous greetings written in golden letters
and punctuated with doves, rosebuds and
archery-loving gods of love.
EXCLUSIVE NEWS.
Sacramento Bes.
The San Francisco Call achieved a
distinct "scoop" in Its publication of
the arrest of Frank Belew upon the
strength of a confession he had pre
viously made to the officers. The other
San Francisco dailies should have had
the g:nod grace to admit the victory
of their neighbor, instead of trying- to
belittle it and endeavoring to secure
some part of an undeserved glory for
themselves. The Call's beat was a
neat one in every respect, and it han
dled the exclusive news in a thorough
ly creditable way.
A JOURNALISTIC TRIUMPH.
Santa Cruz Penny Press.
The Call Friday printed exclusively
the news of the arrest of Frank Bel
ew, near Klmira, at 10 o'clock Thurs
day nijfht. The Call has kept a re
porter in the neighborhood since the
time of the murder and thus rendered
assistance to Sheriff Rush of Solano
County. The exclusiveness of the pub
lication was a journalistic triumph,
and the capture of the murderer after
the case had been dropped as a mys
tery is a feat that demands recogni
tion of the persistence and faithful
ness on the part of the officer. It is a
sad admission that murder is so com
mon in California, but it is a satisfac
tion to law abiding people that mur
derers are caught through diligent ef
fort of the officers aided by the news
papers. ________^^_____
THE SCOOP WAS COMPLETE.
Stockton
The San Francisco Call of Friday
had a "scoop" In the Dlxon poisoning
case by getting the alleged confession
of Prank Belew that he poisoned his
sister Susie and his brother Lewis.
While The Call's scoop Is complete It
does not appear that the officers, with
whom It shares the credit of the rev
elation and arrest, are entitled to
much glory. To Bird's love of life
being stronger than his conscience or
family pride the outcome seems due,
but how The Call secured an exclusive
story does not appear, yet It got It and
is entitled to all the glory of the
achievement.

HOLMES ON
THE STAND
Prolonged Examina
tion of the Water-
Front Expert.
His Experiences With
Colnon on the Creo-
sote Subject.
Review of the Two Obnoxious
Clauses in the Speci
fications.
NO PATENT NEED APPLY.
Confirmed Hearing in tho Paraffine
Company Case Against the
Harbor Board.
Chief Engineer Holmes was kept on
the witness stand nearly four hours
yesterday in Judge Belcher's court, j
under a fire of questions from both >
Bides, in the case of the Paraffine Paint |
Company against the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners. During the
forenoon session his testimony was !
mainly responsive to questions put by
Attorney Stratton in the "Did you say" '
and "Did I say" affirmative form.
From the line of inquiry pursued the
policy of the defense in the pending
action was fairly well indicated. The
more plainly does this seem to be* the
fact, when taken into consideration
with an expression previously made by
Mr. Stratton to a Call representative,
that whatever intention the board
might have had to favor the San Fran
cisco Timber Preserving Company,
they abandoned it when what is known
as the third set of specifications were
framed.
It is this third set of specifications
upon which the case of the Paraffine
Company is claimed by the defense to
be largely predicated. Two obnoxious
propositions were injected after the re
jection of the bids under the second
set of specifications, in which contest
the Paraffine Company was the lowest
bidder on each of the proposed pro
cesses. These bids were all rejected,
on the pretext that a protest fruitful
of litigation might result from award
ing the contract on a day not specified
in the advertisement, consideration of
them after they were opened having
been deferrM.
One change, or insertion, made in the
third set, when it was decided to ad- â 
vertise for new bids, was the addition j
to each one of three of the described (
processes for treatment of piles, of the j
number of the patent for material to
be used. In the case of the fourth, or
creosoting\ trea.tir.ent, no patent num- '
ber was given.
Respecting the creosoting treatment,
0 -vhich is the one used by the Dundon-
Slade Company, it is not the material
but the process that is patented.
Mr. Stratton set up in his examina
tion of Engineer Holmes that because
of this fact, and the additional doubt
as to whether the Curtis & Isaacs
patent would "hold water" â as Mr.
Holmes expressed it â the patent num
ber was i from that clause of
the specifications which described the
creosoting treatment; and that further
the words "atmospheric pressure,"
which called for tfie Ctirtis & Isaacs
patent, wi The reason as
d for thi Unary precau
ti >n â extraordinary in view of the fact
that Dundon had been treating piles
by this process on informal bids, was
to admit of competitive bidding for the
creosoting treatment.
At this point of review it may be
we!! â  â¢ a few facts not in evi
dence, but of themselves suggestive.
Mr. Stratton was a member of the last
was at that time
servinj â  ial counsel for the Har
bor Comi - Governor Budd had
proposed in Ins message a complete re
constitution of the board and the en
actment of statutory restrictions as to
its manacpment, particularly in the
matter of contracts and expenditures.
He was resisted successfully, as he
avows, by a Harbor Commission lobby.
Th" Governor was also interested in
an amendment to the penal codeiwhich
concealed in its verbiage a provision of
law worth recalling. The bill went
through the ordinary course of legisla
tion, passing in a regular manner both
the House and Senate. It is not to be
assumed that the measure escaped the
vigilance of a lobby potentially inter
ested in perpetuating the existing
methods and liberties of the Harbor
Commission. The law is as follows:
[Approved March 27, 1897.]
The people of the State of California,

bid shall be asked for any article
of a specific brand or mark nor
any patent apparatus or appli
; ances when such requirement
would prevent proper competition
on the part of dealers in other
articles of equal value, utility or
merit.
In view of the developments In the
Harbor Commission case and the fact
that the board, as well as their spe
cial counsel, are charged especially
with knowledge of the laws relating to
contracts, it becomes interesting at this
' stage of the proceedings to ask whether
! they could have let a contract to either
! of the bidders under the treatments de
! scribed as patented in the clauses B, C
i and D of the third set of specifications.
Must they not have discovered, had the
Paraffine Company not enjoined them,
and had bids been presented in accord
ance with the last specifications, that
i a forgotten or hitherto unknown law
: prohibited them from entering into a
contract with any bidder save one of
those coming under thÂ« creosoting
clause, or "A," as it is known.
Here the second obnoxious or penal
ty clause, previously not inserted in
specifications of that particular nature,
has a bearing. The limit for the deliv
ery of piles to the Green-street wharf
was fixed at forty days. Failure to
comply by so much as a day would
I have left it in the power of the board
to cancel the contract. Ten days was
named as the time when the delivery of
i piles must begin, and for every subse
quent day thereafter on which at least
twenty piles were not delivered a pen
alty of $.">0 was provided.
With only one of two plants could
the work be performed. The Dundon
combine owns one; the Parafflne Com
j pany had arranged for the purchase of |
â  the other, conditional on securing the j
j contract. To remove the Bolton plant .
I and get it under way in this city would
take the Parafflne Company not less
than fourteen days, a fact of which the j
board was advised. The threat wte
' made that if the Parafflne Company got
'â  the contract the Dundon crowd would
' tie them up in litigation on the pretense
i that the Curtis & Isaacs patent was in
; fringed. That, whatever the merits of
! the question raifed at law, would have
I enforced further delay, and prevented
' the completion of the contract^within
: the specified forty days. Then, with a
j $25,000 plar* idle on their hands, the
! Paraffine Company might have thecon
j tract taken away from them and turned
over to the Dundon Company.
Mr. Holmes testified that when the
I bids were opened under the second set
I of specifications, which covered the pro
! posed delivery of treated piles for a
year, G. S. Irving, representing the
Paraffine Company, the lowest bidder,
offered to give an indemnity bond to
i the board to secure them from any pos
! sible loss from failure of contract.
The -witness stated that prior to Mr.
Colnon'a appointment on the board it
had been customary for the contractors
on the water front to furnish their own
piles. Latterly the piles have been fur
nished the contractors by the board.
Mr. Holmes had a check on the piles
ordered for contractors, but of the
manner of oherking the majority of the
! piles purchased by the board for use |
in repairs under the direction of the i
I superintendent, who is under the or-
I ders of the board, he knew nothing,
i Witness had suggested thut the board
! establish a laboratory for testing the
i creosote used, but Mr. Colnon said he
' was satisfied with the tests made by j
i the Southern Pacific for him.
Mr. Holmes believed that the creo- |
soting 1 treatment increased the inflam- I
inability of piles and the wltarf super
structure. Mr. Colnon disagreed with
him. It was the opinion of witness
that the least amount of creosote to be
uesd in the tratment of piles was four
teen pounds to the cubic foot. The
| Dudon Company has been supplying
i 10-pound treatment, and this he did not .
; deem adequate. The thousands of dol- '.
â  lars' worth of piles of this kind thus
i far placed are an experiment. The â 
| paraffined pile, so far as It has been j
I tested in San Francisco Bay, he re- j
! garded as being equally serviceable i
! with the creosoted pile. For his own j
i part he preferred the cylinder pile. I
! Even Curtis and Isaacs had agreed â 
: with him as to the superiority of the
! 14-pound creosote pile. He admitted
that the expense of treating was in
creased by the Injection of each addi
! tional pound of creosote, but he insist
ed that ten pounds was inadequate. He
! had heard William Healy of Healy,
Tibbeta & Co. charge in an open board i
i meeting that some of the piles dcliv- ,
I ered by Darby Laydnn & Co. for sec- !
tion 1 or 2 of the seawall were rotten. j
Nothing was done about the matter.
It was developed by Mr. Holmes' tes- j
I timony that 187 piles had been ordered j
I treated by the Dundon Company since
the issuance of the temporary injune-
I tion. The whole order was for 287
1 piles. 100 having been ordered before '
! the date of the injunction. He had been j
j instructed by the board to divide the |
j order in this manner. Counsel for the i
! Paraffine Company sought to show that
j the plan was invented to evade the law
i restricting purchases of materials j
! without contract to the value of less |
I than $3000, the total value of this spe
cial order for a given purpose exceed
ing $4000; but witness had no knowl- i
edge as to the purpose of the board and j
merely obeyed orders.
Judge Cope started oft* the morning
session by introducing Harbor Commis- i
sion vouchers, showing that Attorney!
Stratton had received $800 fees from
the board in the Pacific Pine lumber j
I cases, in which he likewise had served
I Slade, and $300 in the Healy, Tibbits &
Co. suits against Colnon, which was j
; compromised. It had been shown al- j
I ready, from Slade's double-action
books, that $350 was paid by the Slade- j
Dundon combine to Stratton for his'
, services in the compromised Pacific <
| Pine lumber cases.
The next morsel of evidence was an- !
, other of the hundred and one links of
; circumstantial proof of collusion be- j
j tween the board and the Dundon-Slade
combine. It was an opinion submitted i
to the board by its regularly employed :
i counsel, Tirey L. Ford, on October 4, j
i 1897, shortly after the inception of the ;
i Pacific Pine Lumber Company suits, in ;
' which Mr. Ford plainly pointed out that i
i the alleged lumber contract with the j
S. E. Slade Company could be with
drawn at the will of either party. He j
I advised its immediate termination by |
the board, and incorporated in his rec- j
ommendation a resolution, the adoption i
of which would have stopped the Slade
Jobbery in the prices of lumber deliv
ered to the commission. No attention j
was paid either to Mr. Ford's money- !
saving advice or his resolution, and the |
legal complications following were spe
cially taken care of by Mr. Stratton, |
with the result of the compromise so i
well known, which eventuated in hand- I
some fees for the special counselor, and !
much cash by fraud for the Dundon-
Slade combine.
Stratton recalled D. H. Bibb to the
stand to ask him whether he had not
stated to Governor Budd, when he met
him at the Palace Hotel, two or three
weeks after his experience with Inglis
and Chairman Colnon. that he wanted
to get a contract for the sale of lumber
to the Harbor Commission, but could
not without taking Inglis into partner
ship.
Mr. Bibb Bald he could not answer the
question without telling what he really
did say. Witness then reiterated that
what he had testified on direct examin
ation as to his interviews with Inglis
and Colnon, he had related in detail to
the Governor.
The case will not be resumed until
next morning.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1898.
HALL BROS.' NEW SCHOONER NOMAD.
She is now sixty-eight days out from Shanghai and a^ little anxiety is felt over the long passage she Is making. Sea
faring men think there is a good chance for her yet and say she may have been blown out of her course or may have been
disabled in a hurricane and is now coming along under a jury rig.
OVERDUE FROM
SHANGHAI
Schooner Nomad Left
There Sixty-Eight
Days Ago.
Another Large and Fast Col
lier Purchased by Rosen
feld's Sons.
Entire New Crew Shipped on fhe
Oceanic Company's Steamer
Zeaiandia. â 
Considerable anxiety is felt over the
non-arrival of the new schooner No
mad from Shanghai. She is one of the
last vessels turned out from Hall's ship
yard at Fort Blakeley and left on her
maiden voyage on September IS. She
was in command of Captain West Mc-
Allep, who was accompanied by his son
and daughter. Miss McAllep had been
very sick, and her father took her with j
him in the hope that the sea voyage |
would do her good. The Nomad reached
Shanghai after a fast run, and started
egain in ballast for Puget Sound sixty
eight days ago. Since then she has not
been heard from.
Among shipping men the impression
seems to be that there is a good fight
ing chance that the Nomad will turn
! up. George E. Billings of the firm of
Hall Bros, says that a number of cir-
S cumstances may have arisen which
i might have detained the vessel. She
may have been driven way out of her
course by a storm; again some of her
sails may have been blown out of the
bolt ropes and she may have even lost
some of her spars. Any of these acci
dents would result in a long voyage,
, and he is still confident that the ves
i sel will turn up all right. The Nomad
| was one of the best four-masted
i schooners and one of the best carriers
' that have been turned out by the Halls
I in some time, so her safe arrival at
Puget Sound will be hailed with de
t light.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
I steamer Mariposa arrived from Sydney
! and way ports yesterday with a very
; large passenger lifct, many of whom are
! bound for the Klondike. H. Maddean,
a detective from Auckland, N. Z., was a
. cabin passenger. He has come to this
! country to take back Dr. Arthur -Her
i bert Orpen, who is wanted in Auckland
|on a charge of murder. Orpen is now
: in the custody of United States Marshal
! Baldwin.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
j Zealandia is shipping a new crew, and
j the Australia's men will not be trans

John Rosenfeld's Sons have purrhas-
I ed another large collier for the Nanai
| mo trade. She is the Norwegian steam
er Titania, and is now discharging a
| general cargo from Antwerp at Kobe,
j Japan.
The ferry steamer Piedmont got lost
| in the fog again yesterday morning.
j She was thirty minutes late crossing
the bay, and when she arrived at the
! Oakland mole the passengers by the
i 7:30, 8 and 8:30 trains were waiting for
! her. A quick run was made back to
San Francisco, but when headed into
i the slip the captain backed out again,
s.lthough the mate from the deck called
; out to him that it was all right and to
go ahead. The steamer, however, was
| backed right out and turned around,
i going into the slip stern first. This
; maneuver occupied fifteen minutes, and
! the atmosphere was blue from the lan
j guage of the belated passengers as
i they scrambled over the baggage and
dodged horses and teams in their en
deavor to get ashore. All the horses had
to be taken out of the wagons and the
! latter had to be run ashore by hand
i power. To add to the discomfort the
i narrow gauge steamer had to follow
t the rule laid down by the Southern Pa
cific, which says that no steamer shall
leave her slip while another is trying
to make a landing. Luckily there were
not many passengers on the narrow
gauge boat, so the delay did not work
so great a hardship as it did
on the people on the Piedmont, who
were anxious to get to their work on
this side of the bay.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Com
pany's steamer Alliance sailed for Cop
per River via Seattle yesterday. She
j took away eighty passengers from here
! and HO more are waiting for her at
I Seattle.
The City of Puebla sailed from
Broadway wharf yesterday with 300
passengers, nearly all of whom are
bound for Dyea and Skaguay. The de
! mand for tickets was so great that the
company could easily have sold 200
more had there been room in the boat
for them. Large quantities of canned
goods and other portable stuff was
taken along by the prospectors, but it
is doubtful if one-half of the stuff that
has left this city and Seattle will get
over the trail into Dawson this year.
SEARCHING FOR
THE FIREBUG
Fire in Apostolo's Barber-
Shop Believed to Be
Incendiary.
Certain Suspicious Circum
stances Found by the Fire
Marshall.
He Is Determined to Make a Thorough
Investigation Into the
Matter.
Fire Marshal Towe is making a
searching investigation into the cause
of the fire at the barber shop of Ata
nasio Apostolo, 11 Grant avenue, un
der the Hammam baths at an early
hour yesterday morning.
He visited the store yesterday, and
found certain thines that appear to
him suspicious, and lead him to the be
lief that the fire was of Incendiary ori
gin. The fire started in a storeroom
adjoining the bathrooms, and was for
tunately extinguished before it had got
much headway.
"There are seven or fight chairs in
the shop," said the Fire Marshal yes
terday, "and each of the barbers has a
locker. At the bottom of each locker
is a folding drawer for the men to
throw the towels into that have been
used. I found all these folding draw
ers open, and from the storeroom
where the fire broke out to the near
est four lockers there is a distinct trail
of bay rum which had been set on fire.
I found towelÃ in each of the folding
drawers saturated with coal oil, the
idea being that the flame from the bay
rum would communicate with the tow
els saturated with coal oil, but it failed
from the fact that when the bay rum
was ignited there would follrcw a quick
flash not of sufficient duration to ig
nite the towels.
"As soon as I saw this I asked Apos
tolo for an explanation, but he replied
that he did not know anything about
it. He said he left the shop shortly
after 9 o-'elock Wednesday night and
went to his home, at 2112 Geary street.
He had no idea whatever as to the ori
gin of the fire, and said the shop was
all right when he shut up for Â»the
night.
"Apostolo told me that the place had
been entered by burglars Tuesday
night and $8 stolen from the till. He
had reported the burglary to the po
lice. I asked Captain Bohen and other
officers at police headquarters if the
burglary had been reported, but they
knew nothing about it. I went back
to Apostolo. and told him that no one
knew about the burglary, and he then
said he had reported it to a reporter.
"There is $3750 insurance on the stock
and fixtures, which I consider exces
sive. Some of the fixtures I under
stand belong to the proprietors of the
Hammam baths. I have no idea as to
who act fire to the place, but I am de
termined to make a most searching in
vestigation. It may have been some
enemy of Apostolo, but I will do my
best to find out the facts, as if the fire
had got good headway some lives
might have been sacrificed."
The Famous Boot Jack Tobacco.
If you use tobacco you surely want the
best. Boot Jack plug is made from choice
selections of leafâ the cream of the crop.
It is pure, clean and lasting.
The unanimous verdict is there is no
chew like Boot Jack. Of course it costs
a little more than the common brands,
but it lasts longer and gives much better
satisfaction. It is always best to pay a
trifle more and get Boot Jack plug than
to waste money on inferior brands. â¢

NOW SEEKING
FOR A MOTIVE
An Interesting Argument
in the Figel Case
Yesterday.
Prosecution Asked for Admis
sion of Evidence in Em
bezzlement Cases.
Was Done for the Purpose of Show
ing Cause for the Alleged.
Murder.
The Figel case proceeded aa usual
yesterday in Judge Cook's court be
fore a large crowd. The witnesses
called for the prosecution were briefly
questioned, and were soon disposed, of,
as the Police Court testimopy was but
gone aver again in a hurried manner.
The most important issue of the day
was an argument in the absence of the
jury concerning the admissibility of
evidence in the embezzlement and for
gery cases for the purpose of fixing a
motive for the alleged murder of Isaac
Hoffman. The argument consumed
nearly the entire afternoon.
Louis Friedman, a boot and shoe
dealer, at 320 Market street, also testi
fied to having seen Hoffman in front
of the store about 6:15 on the night of
June 1. He stated that Hoffman ap
peared to be in good spirits, as he had
spoken to him, and that if he had con
templated suicide his conduct did not
show it.
Harry H. Hoffman, a distant relative
of the deceased, testified that a letter
mailed at 6:12 on the night of June 1
was written by Isaac Hoffman, and
was addressed to Edward S. Rothohild,
then in New York. The letter, which
was obtained from the postal authori
ties by Chief of Police Lees, contained
suggestions for the carrying on erf the
business for the coming month.
H. Justins, a clerk in E. T. Allen's
gun store, testified' during the after
noon's session. He was called for the
purpose of testifying to whether or not
Theodore Figel had purchased a re
volver in the store on the evening of
June 1. The defense acknowledged the
fact that the defendant had made the
purchase on the evening in question.
It was brought out that the witness
had sold the revolver and a box of
cartridges to the defendant, and that
he again met him on the Tiburon boat
at about 6:30 o!clock on the same even
ing. In cross-examination he stated
that he had seen Figel at 6:05 o'clock
in the store, and was positive of the
time, as he looked at the clock at the
time Figel came into the store and as
Mr. Allen went out on his way home.
He also stated that he had seen a va
lise carried by Figel.
James Doyle, a special officer at the
First National Bank deposit vault, said
that he had seen Figel at 5:46 o'clock
on the evening of June 1, when he had
opened his box in the vault at the time
mentioned, and that he remained in the
building but half a minute. The cross
examinatton brought out no new points.
The testimony given by James O. Ma
loney, a drayman, who cannot be
found, at the preliminary examination,
was read to the jury. The reading was
interrupted by a transfer of the visit
ing crowd that was standing on the
main floor to the gallery. Judge Mur
phy said he thought it was an earth
quake. Order was soon restored and
the trial proceeded. The cross-examin

SCOTT & BOWNE, Chemists. New Yorfc
ation was read by General Barnes. The
testimony was principally concerning
the time the witness had seen Theo
dore Figel on the evening of June 1,
and the fact that he had seen Hoffman
standing in the doorway of the store
on that evening, and stated that he
had heard loud, angry words and a
statement from one of them saying,
"Come in and I will settle with you,"
and the reply, "You have, nothing to
settle." According to testimony the
men entered the store and closed the
iron doors behind them. After the
reading of the testimony the jury was
excused at the request of counsel for
both prosecution and defense with the
object in view of arguing the matter
regarding the admissibility of certain
evidence concerning the embezzlement
and forgery charges. Judge Murphy
in opening the argument stated that
he proposed to show that money had
been appropriated by the defendant
and that the receipt for $9500 was forg
ery. The evidence was asked to be ad
mitted by the prosecution for the pur
pose of showing a motive for the_ al
leged crime, and that evidence tending
to show a motive for a crime should
be admitted in a homicidal case.
In reply General Barnes stated the
defendant had been informed against
by the District Attorney on serious
charges of embezzlement on many
business firms, in all seven infor
mations, amounting to about $POOO. It
was denied as competent evidence, as
a motive is immaterial in crime except
a.s an aid to that crime. It was stated
by the defense that there has been no
proof of the crime further than that
the body had been found, and in itself
was not proof of a homicide. The case
was gone over in detail by the defense
and cases quoted to the Judge bearing
out the claims of the defense. General
Barnes said that as the corpus delicti
had not been shown he would pray the
court not to admit the evidence. "Mo
tive can be inferred from a crime," he
said, "but a crime cannot be inferred
from a motive." In reply Judge Mur
phy stated that he would ask that the
evidence be admitted, when he should
show to the satisfaction of the court
that it was good evidence and vital to
the case, showing â  a motive for the
murder of Isaac Hoffman by the de
fendant, Theodore Figel. "A motive,"
he said, "was what is being sought for
and can only be determined by admis
sion of evidence tending to sh"bw that
motive, which we allege was to save
himself from many years' imprison
ment for commission of felonious acts
against his employer." Numerous
casea were cited by Judge Murphy
bearing on the case. The argument
will be continued this afternoon.
This morning the court and jury will
visit the scene of the shooting and will
afterward return to the courtroom,
where more evidence will be heard.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate maximum temperature
for the day?: those underneath It. if any. the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in inches
and hundredth!* during the past twelve hours.
Isobar?, or soiid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word 'high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "'low" refers to low pres-
Bure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when thÂ» "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is lm
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Call- i
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of ihese conditions will produce an !
opposite result.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 10.â The most Interesting
feature of to-day's stock market was the
manner in which It regarded the Spanish
Minister" resignation. In view of the (sen
sitiveness in the recent past to everything
connected with the Cuban question its disre
gard of an Incident involving so acute a phase
of feeling is noteworthy. The view taken of
the subject In Wall street was that the pos
sibility of danger in it had been avoided by
the firm and prompt manner In which the in
cident had been treated by the Government.
Prices advanced from the opening of the mar
ket. Higher quotations from London gave an
Impetus to the opening rise. There was no
great setback from the opening to the close
of the market. The only thing approaching
It was an occasional pause in the advance,
but this was simply due to a falling off In the
buying and not to heavy offerings. Upon a re
newal of activity the upward movement be
gan again. Advances were not uniform and
were not simultaneous. Considering the vol
ume of the trading for tho day the railway
stocks were notably email. in these which
show large gains the advances were made at
different times during the day. first one and
another or the stocks or group of stocks be
ing taken up and pushed. The local transac
tion scored the largest advance and showed
the heaviest dealings of any group in the list.
The strength of the market showed a ten
dency to run to the specialties and tobacco.
General Electric, Western Union and Susque
hanna and Western preferred were conspicuous
in the day's movement. Pullman added flva
more points to Its remarkable advance. The
mainstay of the market was the renewed buy-
Ing on a large scale of New York Central and
the strength of Northwest, Omaha and the
other Vanderbllt stocks.
The Grangers as a group were strong. Bur
lington leading. Adams Express was bid up
22 points over yesterday's bad price without
eliciting any offers. American Express sold
2H points over the last sale and was bid up 2
points higher. There was a further easing In
money rates to-day and sterling exchange con
tinued firm.
The recent slight reaction In speculative
bonds terminated to-day and the general
movement was again strongly upward on a
very large business. It was reported that $1,
000,000 worth of a single issue have been taken
for London account. Total sales, $4,830,000.
United States new 4s registered were %
lower bid.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 395,900

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 10.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were dull. Dear money Is begin
ning to have an Influence, although It is not
expected that It will have a really bad effect
on the market, because the dearness is partly
due to the healthy condition of trade. There
were very large borrowings to-day from the
Bank of England, amounting probably to Â£2 -
000.000. Americans were above the New York
parity, but except for Erie preferred and Union
Pacific shares the market was listless. Argen
tines and Brazils were lower. Mines were
easier. Grand Trunk was better on expecta
tion of a favorable settlement. The reported
sales of lands by the Northern Pacific for the
retirement of its first mortgage bonds Is not
believed here. Gold is In strong demand
partly for South America. The Paris Bourse
was better.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET;
CHICAGO, Feb. Scan after the opening
May Wheat dropped to 96\4@88iÂ»e en realisa
tions. Then a plow advance started which car- j
ried the market up to Â»6Vi@96%c, when a re
action occurred, May declining this time 'to
BS%c, Sellers were not without encouragement.
Crop reports were very favorable, Kansas
messages stating that the prospects there were
the beet ever known, and the outlook In Michi
gan was also good. News from Argentine
caused some hesitancy for a time. BroemhaU
estimated the Argentine . shipping surplus at
32,000,000 bushels, and said he looked for ship
ments from that country to Europe this month
01 about S.OW.UOO bushels. A report that be
tween 800. and UOO.OUO barrels oC Flour had
accumulated at New York was also in, under
second decline. A,bout 11 o'clock the market
began strong and active. An authoritative New
York dispatch estimated Flour stocks there at
not to exceed 100,000 barrels outside of that al
ready contracted for shipment. Everything
else, however, was overshadowed by the cash
news. Reports that Joseph Letter had con
tracted to ship 600,000 bushels of Wheat by the
JLehlgh Valley road to the Eastern seaboard,
which were circulated yesterday, were con
firmed to-day, and It wan further ascertained
the Wheat was going forward on a through
rato to Europe. There was also rumors of
other large lots to be moved out. half of It
by rail, and though not entirely â¢ confirmed,
were received with credence by traders. The
Atlantic port clearances of Wheat and Flour
were put at 534,000 bushels. By noon there was
a big trade In the pit and prices under a gen
eral buying demand had â¢ advanced ' to 97@97%c.
Many of the early sellers were forced to buy
back their lines. The price was â¢ well â  main
tained at the top for some time, but offerings
became free late In the session and ! a reaction
to 867* c took plaoe, the market closing steady

THE FRUIT MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 10.â The Journal of Com
merce says: Florida oranges are about done.
The stock here Is said to consist largely of
frost-damaged stock, and. In consequence,
prices are somewhat unsettled. California or
anges are still arriving freely, but under con
tinued good consuming demand prices remain
stationary on both navels and seedlings. In
Jamaica oranges the trade is only moderate,
and, under full supplies, the market favors
buyers, but there has been no quotable change
in prices. California loose Muscatel raisins
are still unsettled. While standard goods are
held firmly up to quotations, off-grade and
rain-damaged stock Is to be had at lower fig
ures, and offerings of these on a compara
tively dull market have a depressing influence
on market values. Exnort Interest at the
moment does not appear to be very great, but
sellers are confident that during the coming
season trade with European buyers will show
a large increase and there are entertained
hopes that the export business will eventmlly
assume large proportions. California, it is
estimated, has already taken steps to control
the export business and hopes to do most of
It In the future. California London layers and
clusters are scarce and firm, but we hear of
little demand. Valencia layers are in limited
supply, but in the absence of demand prices
are nominal. Imported sultanas are scarce and
firm. Stocks of California sultanas and seed
less Muscatels have, it is reported, been closely
concentrated by recent purchases and prices
have an upward tendency. Currants are firm
and offered sparingly, but there seems to be
little demand at present. California apricots
of lower grades are still wanted, but it Is re
ported that stocks are well cleaned up on spot,
and that there is little or nothing more to
come forward.

meeting of Oakland's
City Fathers last iii^hi.
When The Call sounded the note of
warning to the people of Oakland two
weeks ago there was every indication
that there would be a concerted effort
on the part of the two water companies
of that city to have the Council make
an increase of rates. The companies
had announced what they were pleased
to term an "agreement," and interested
parties were busy with the Council
men with arguments in favor of mak
ing a change in the existing schedule.
The Call took up the fight of the peo
ple against the water companies, and
the City Council last night passed to
print a water rate ordinance that fully
bears out The Call's position and gives
to the people the old rate while it
makes a readjustment that increases
the income to the companies from hy
drants and schools. These changes
were outlined in The Call of yesterday

"BMOlved, that in the light of experi
ence further extension of the French co
lonial system would be impolitic." C. A.
Murdock, Charles P. Eella and Sheldon J.
Kellogg will act as judges.
The Carnot medal has been won twice
by a California manâ in 1596 by Martin C.
Flaherty, now Instructor in English at
the university, and in lh!)7 by Harry A.
Overstreet. Last year the debate was
held at Palo Alto.
The Berkeley students expect a delega
tion of a hundred Stanford men to-mor

them in return for the cordial reception
that the Stanford people accorded a
party of visiting Berkeleyans at Palo
Alto last year.

morning and are directly in line with
that for which this paper has contend
ed. It has been a right for the people
and the people have won.
When the Council met last night It
was evident that the water companies
were prepared to take advantage of
every opening in order that they might
win an increase, but the men who were
standing for the best interests of the
people were on the lookout and balked
every scheme that appeared.
At times the discussion became acri
monious and bitter, and even went to
the extent of an indulgence in person
alities, but all the while the five mem
bers who have shown their determina
tion to stand between the people and
any increase of water taxation made
such a firm stand that even those
members who were trying to make
changes were forced to _vpte for the
people, and the ordinance was passed
by a unanimous vote.
Councilman Heitmann opened the war
with an attack upon Mr. Girard by
saying that there was a time when
fools were appointed to office, but now
is to be a reunion of the many former
Hawaiian residents who now reside here.

HAVE BUILT A "BIG C."
BERKELEY, Feb. 10.â The "Senior C"
fence or bench, was built this afternoon
on the university campus, just east of
North Hall, and the members of the class
of '98 have arranged to dedicate it with
unique ceremonies to-morrow morning at !
11:15 o'clock. The "C" is practically a I
bench, three feet wide, forming an octa- |
gon, one side of which is partly- cut out, I
forming the "C," which stands for "Cali
fornia/^ It is to be a congregating place ;
for the seniors exclusively, who, when
they graduate, will turn it over to the
class of '99.
The idea of the "Senior C" was first sug
gested by a letter from ex-Football Cap- j
tain Wilfred Ransome, in which he de
scribed the famous Yale senior fence, j
Something original was wanted, so a j
"senior C" was decided upon.
The dedication exercises to-morrow
morning will consist of music by the

be preceded by a rifle salute of ninety

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1898.
they were elected. Girard was on his
feet in an instant, and for a while it
looked as if there might be need of po
lice interference, but Heitmann was
satisfied to keep silent after the scoring
inflicted upon him by the indignant
champion of the people. Girard brought
forth the applause of the assembled
citizens when he said:
"Yes, and there was a time when
honest men were elected to office In
Oakland; when men who worked, like
myself, and who had visible means of
support were members of the Council;
when honest men, and not hoodlums,
were elected."
Councilman Cuvellier watched the op
position very closely, and checked ev
ery attempt to make changes in the re
port of the committee with the result
that the report was adopted as made,
and now the chances of the water com
panies getting any "joker" incorporat
ed in the ordinance are very slim in
deed.
That something of this sort will be
attempted was evidenced by a very
significant remark made by Council
DOG TRAINERS
ARE AT WAR
What the Death of the Famous
Pointer Glenbeigh Has
Brought About.
Allender and Campbell Engage in
Fisticuffs After a Warm
Debate.
Although Glenbeigh, the once famous
pointer dog. has departed to the happy
hunting: grounds, his great performances
in the field have not been forgotten by
Howard Vernon and sportsmen who have
had the pleasure of shooting over him
when he was in the land of the living.
As already stated, the dog was poi
soned in Bakorsiield just previous to the
field trials, and there were among the
Iportsmen who witnessed the trials some
who thought that the gram! old dog had
been poisoned intentionally; then again,
there were others who believed that the
dog had partaken of meat that was poi
soned purposely to destroy the coyotes
which are numerous on the plains and
that his death was purely accidental.
However, the handler of the dog Al
lender and a dog breaker named Camp
bell, with some gentlemen who take an
interest in field sports, met yesterday in
a downtown establishment and a hot
exchange of words between the dog
breakers resulted.
Allender cross-questioned Campbell re
garding his trip to Bakersfield and also
about remarks he (Campbell) had made
in reference to Allender and Glenbeigh,
which roused the Scottish blood in the
veins of Campbell, who retaliated with
a statement that If any one person had
an object in disposing of the dog in ques
tion it would be the man who is now en
gaged in looking after the interests of the
K. V. Sullivan Kennels of English setters.
At this Insinuation Allender's little
brown eyes Hashed, and bracing himself
for an attack he sent out his powerful
right, but the blow fell short by an inch
of the nasal appendage of Mr. Campbell,
but the whirr of the handler's big bunch
of fives as it cleaved the "powdered" at
mosphere could have been heard a block
away.
A famous snipe shooter, who was pres
ent when the battle was waxing hot, said
that if Allender had happened to hit
Campbell there would be no telling where
Campbell's head would have landed, as
it is said that in prime condition Allender
can strike a 400 pound blow.
Campbell, who is a giant in front of
Allender, did not dream of an attack of
the fists being made upon him, and ho
excused himself for the great loss of time
on his part in retaliating by stating that
it was a much greater surprise to him to
see Allender attempt fisticuffs than the
announcement of the death of Glenbeigh.
Friends interfered, however, before cold
Irons could be used, and the respective
handlers were ushered to places of safety.
But it is said the end has not arrived.
Campbell intends to issue a broadsword
challenge to Allender, the contest to take
place on the Farallon Islands at any time
Mr. Allender is ready for a strictly busi
ness undertaking, but then, as Mr. Alen
der has never had an opportunity of
learning how to manipulate a sword
either when mounted or on foot, the
challenge will doubtless not be accepted.
Allender wants the mitts or the raw
'uns; he believes only in the manly art
as a sportsmanlike means of self-de
fense, and Campbell will, in all proba
bility, have to practice fisticuffs if he
hopes to meet Allender on the field of
battle.
DoubtlesÃ the Olympic Club, which is
now reaching out for fistic. talent, will
offer "the handlers" good financial in
ducements to spat before the members.
The City Loses Its Land.
The Supreme Court decided the case of
the City and County of San Francisco
against Mrs. Ellen Grotte in her favor for
the possession of 35x12^ feet of land
which has been in litigation for some
time. This piece was originally deeded
to the city by the husband of Mrs. Grotte
previous to his death some years ago.
The trial court decided against her and
on her appeal this was reversed on the
ground that as the land in question was
homesteaded it was necessary to have
the consent of the wife to the dedication
before it could be legally done.
.â â¦ . .
In the Divorce Courts.
Max Levin was granted a divorce from
Lena Levin by Judge Hebbard yesterday,
on the ground of desertion. Mamie Greict
was granted a divorce from William
man Earl after the ordinance was
passed. He reserved the right to in
troduce an amendment when the ordi
nance came up for final passage, and
when this was objected to by President
Pringle on the grounds that any amend
ment should be made now as its future
introduction might jeopardize the le
gality of the ordinance on account of
the lime necessary for publication, Earl
said: "Oh, we will fix it some way."
The general impression made by this
remark was that an attempt would be
made to throw the ordinance over the
legal time and then have it declared il
legal by the courts, but with the five
stanch friends on the floor, backed by
President Pringle with the deciding
vote, the people have nothing to fear cm
this score, and they may rest assured
that Oakland water rates will remain
aa fixed in the report of the Fire and
Water Committee.
Those upon whom the people of Oak
land enn depend are President Pringle,
Councilmen Upton, Brosnahan, Cuvel
lier, Girard and Kowe, and their solid
front will prevent any scheme from be
ing consummated which will be detri
mental to their constituents.
Following its usual custom, the Ex
aminer took up the fight after The Call
Greist. The decree was Issued on the
ground of the defendant's infidelity, and
he was ordered to pay his 'wife alimony
in the sum of $20 a month. Sierra Nevada
Sullivan whs granted a divorce, on the
ground of desertion, from her husband,
C. J. Sullivan, an Insurance agent. The
custody of the plaintiff's three sons was
awarded her, and , she was given â  $50 â  a
month alimony. The couple. were married
in Chtco in 18S0, and lived together until
January of last year, when a disagree
ment arnÃp, and Sullivan deserted his wife.
She waited until due time had elapsed *>nd
then filed suit for divorce, and Judge
Troutt yesterday granted her application.
Anita Higuera was granted a divorce from
Adolph Higuera on the ground of willful
neglect.
BOGUS LOTTERY TICKETS.
George, Alias Thomas, TJpson Again
Arrested and a Complete Out
fit Seized.
George, alias Thomas, T'pson, the no
torious dealer and manufacturer of bogus
lottery tickets, was arrested yesterday
morning by Sergeant Donovan and posse
at his residence, 264 Clementina street
and booked at the City Prison on a
charge of keeping a lottery place. The
police found a complete outfit of plates,
dies, inks and molds and a large quantity
of tickets of the various lottery com
panies, which were seized.
The police had been watching the place
for some days in the expectation that
they would capture several of the men
who bought the bogus tickets from ['j>
son, but were only successful in captur
ing one, A. C. Campbell, and lie was ar
rested for aiding and abetting a lottery.
Severn 1 tickets were found in his pockets.
Upson on February 5, 1895, was fined $2iH)
DEATH OF A PIONEER STEVEDORE.
CaDtain Thomas Young Passes Awau,
Captain Thomas Ynung of the firm of Young & Allen, pioneer stevedores of
this city, died at his residence, 418 Lombard street, fct 7 o'clock last night, after
a protracted illness, at the age of 70 years. The deceased was one of the best
known men about the water front.
Captain Young was born in Liverpool. England. He went to sea when only 14
years old and since then he has visited every port in the known world. Arriving in
San Francisco In 1850 he rested rrom blue water service and contented himself
with the command of coasting vessels on the northern route. In the emantime he
saw a good chance to make a living at the stevedore business and entered into
partnership with the late Commodore Allen, a partnership which was continued
for forty-seven years.
The deceased leaves a widow and two sons, Harry and John, to mourn his loss.
His funeral will take place from St. Francis Church this morning at 10 o'clock, at
which time a solemn high mass will be celebrated. Afterward his body wil be In
terred In Holy Cross Cemetery,

morning it will make its customary

but, unfortunately for the Mission street
Monarch of Fakers, the people of Oak
land know that The Call had fought
and won their battle before the yellow

The following telegrams were re

and six months In the County Jail for the
same offense and in April, 1896, he was
fined $300. He was subsequently arrested
by the Federal authorities for counter
feiting.
The most sensational episode In his ca
reer was when he went to his rooms on
Howard street early In the morning of
August 22, 1593, and discovered a man
under his bed. They had a desperate
struggle and Upson was wounded by a
shot from a revolver that his opponent
used. The man proved to be John Miller,
an accomplice of Vpson. He was arrested
ami charged with burglary and assault to
murder.
HOME-MADE TWINE.
Hemp Growers Desire Becognition
Among the Merchants.
At a meeting of the Manufacturers and
Producers' Association held yesterday af
ternoon at the society's rooms In the
Mills building the question of growing
liemp and its conversion into twine occu
pied the attention of the meeting.
Horatio Heveridge. manager of the Pa
cific Coast Mining Agency, in his opening
address dwelt upon the great advantages
to the merchants of this coast should
they be enabled to procure their twine
from home-grown hemp. He stated that
there was 4(K> tons produced in California
last year; this brought 5^ cents in tho
Eastern market. From this price it was
quite evident that the growing of hemp
was a profitable investment to men upon
whose land the fiber thrived. It was
shown that there was a profit of $80 an
acre to those who had grown hemp in this
State last year. Upon the representa
tions made by those interested in the
hemp industry and also those desirous
of Investing capital In machinery to con
vert the hemp into twine, the association
will refer the matter to its committee on
promotion for consideration.

"LIKE A PUBLIC BALL."
Even an Angel From the Great White
Throne Would Have Got the
Glassy Orb.
A sob, a sigh, a nervous twisting to
gether of two- dainty hands and a quick
fluttering of the breath sadly indica
tive of incipient hysteria. Then her
eyes sought the exact spot where the
chandelier was suspended from the
ceiling, as if in mute appeal for par
don from above at the sacrilegious
character of what she intended to ut
ter â and then she spoke.
"Why, if a dewy-robed angel from
the base of the Great White Throne
had appeared at my ball under the
same conditions 1 would have been just
as horrified."
The speaker was Mrs. Murphy, Mrs.
S. G. Murphy, wife of the president of
the First National Bank. Her agita
tion was something touching to wit
ness. By her own confession she has
been laboring under this awful load of
woe since last Friday evening, the oc
casion Â»f her fancy dress cotillon in
Maple Hall at the Palace Hotel. And
she blames young Aylett Cotton for it
all, he who is distinguished from his
famous brother of the football bangs
by blond locks not quite so abundant.
Miss Trumbo, sister of the colonel,
comes into the tragedy In the role of
chief assistant to the villain.
Mrs. Murphy had laid her plans for
that cotillon with loving care for
months. It was to be the occasion when
her youngest daughter, Adelaide, who
has been carefully cultivating a becom
ing Parisian accent for many moons,
was to make her bow in the charming
role of debutante and take society at
the point of the bayonet. Portraits ga
lore illustrating dainty feminine finery
worn at various epochs in the land that
fathered the great Napoleon had been
carefully studied, and when the bud
appeared at the cotillon she was at
tired a la Francaise from her exquisite
coiffure to the tip of her neat Louis XV
slipper.
All went well, and everybody was gay
and light-hearted until the mysterious
element crept inâ a careful count of
noses divulged the fact that instead of
150 persons there were just 151 present.
Mrs. Murphy was mystified, but soon
had matters explained.
Young Aylett Cotton came forward
with a young lady to introduce to the
hostess, Colonel Trumbo's sister, who is
here on a visit from Salt Lake. And
then Mrs. Murphy's orbs turned glassy.
Incidentally, her daughter fainted dead
away three times during the evening
cause unknown.
Now Mrs. Murphy Is full of words,
words, words, despite the fact that she
has already dispensed chunks of verbal
ice anent the subject to all of society's
devotees. So, as a result, Mrs. Grundy
is in clover.
Mrs. Murphy assorts that Mr. Cot
ton brought tho young lady without
first consulting the hostess, which ofr
tainly is not according to Hoyle. This
the young fellow vigorously denies,
saying that Miss Murphy herself au
thorized him to Invite Miss Trumbo.
But the hostess will not be appeased
by any such explanation, and insists
that Mr. Cotton has attended cotillons
and "fortnightlies" before, and should
know better.
"They acted Just as if they were at a
public ball or 'function.' " shfÂ» asserts.
And if there is anything worse than
that under the sun It is impossible of
conception to the lay mind.

at Long Odds.
The swagper event of the racing sea
son is* now a thing of the past. Tod
Sloan, the conqueror of all England,
riding with a long rein but minus the
"English roll," made his appearance in
the saddle at Emeryville track yester
day.
Although the ladies broke no parasols
in their delirium of joy at seeing him
back here once more and the men for
pot to punch holes in their high hats.
Tod received a reception that must
have convinced him that he had many
friends in this far western country. The
dapper little rider had the pleasure of
throwing his leg over the back of two
favorites â Wawona and May W. â but
on both occasions was led past the win
ning post by horses piloted by "Long
shot" Conley, the ebony-hued demon.
Sloan's first mount. Wawona, the
favorite for the mile and a furlong sell-
Ing 1 run, opened up at 8 to 5, and went
back in the betting to 2 to 1. This was
from a strong play made on Adam An
drew, sending his odds down from 4 to
1 to 5 to 2. Tod was unfortunate in
getting his mount away from the post
last of the bunch, and, being compelled
to travel the overland route most of the
way, was led past the judges over two
lengths by the 30 to 1 shot. Our Cli
mate, with Conley in the saddle. The
latter is an intermittent sort of a racer
owned by Dan Honig. who has a habit
of slipping in first when no one thinks
ho has a chance. ("onley's mounts,
though, are always backed, and the
colored lad was vociferously cheered as
he returned to the stand.
It was In the final race erf the day
that Sli^an's friends expected him to
Bhine brightest. He had the mount on
that phenomenally fast morsel of speed j
May W., the Calgary bred mare. She i
was pitted against some of the most
select sprinting talent on the track,
among the lot being Tea Rose, Liber
tine, Montgomery and Peixotto. not
withstanding which fact her odds were
gradually hammered down to 6 to 5. ,
As prophesied by the wise ones, Mont
gomery and Tea Rose chased out in
front, and were all out when the stretch
was reached. Tea Rose hung on gam
est, and was still leading below the fur
long pole. Sloan now went to the bat
on the favorite, and it looked as though
Fhe might win, when Conley. on Liber
tine, came with a rush, and, despite
Sloan's furious riding, Galen Brown's
big bay won by less than a length. Tea
Rose was beaten two lengths by the
first choice for the place.
The modest smile that illuminated the
features of Conley when he first "put it
on Sloan" had now lengthened until it
resembled the main entrance to a cir
cus tent.
The attendance was much larger
than on the previous days of the week
a^id the betting far livelier. The track
had been harrowed down until it again
presented quite an even appearance,
although it was still too slow and pre
cluded a*ny fast time being hung out.
Favorites captured but two races.
The mile and a sixteenth handicap
furnished an unexpected winner in
Marplot, which colt went to the post at
odds of 4 to I. He shouldered Johnny
Woods and his So pounds, and making
all of the running vron galloping from
the favorite, Morellito, ridden by
Thorpe. Lincoln II came out for the
first time this season and finished a

grood third. Myth and Garland Barr
were delicately ridden.
Fifteen started in the first event, a
neven-furlonff run, and there was no
pronounced favorite in the betting. La
Maecota. a 6 to 1 chance, with McDon
ald in the saddle, assuming first posi
tion in the stretch and at the wire won
handily from Morlnga. Eroica, played
down from 30 to 7 to 1, was a good
third.
The three-furlong scramble for mem
bers of the kindergarten division, was
an easy thing for the 9 to 20 favorite.
Raintly, ridden by Clawson. The Mid
lothian colt headed Gold Scratch when
squared away for home and won smil
ing from the Burns & Waterhouse
entry. Anchored finished a good third.
J. N'agle Burkc's mare Coda took the
mile and a furlong selling affair, third
on the card, by the narrowest of mar
gins from the 60 to 1 shot Heidelberg.
After Fred Gardner had led to the
stretch Coda and Walter J showed In
advance of the field. Slipping through
next the rail Heidelberg momentarily
held the lead opposite the saddling
paddock, but Wainwright was not of
much assistance to him and was out
finished and beaten by a nose by Harry
Brown on Coda, The winner was 9 to 2
in the ring.
TRACK ITEMS.
It is said the Pacific Coast Jockey Club has
about decided to discontinue "ladies' day" on
Wednesdays.
McDonald, who rode IjSl Mascuta, Is about
the best of the "coming" division. He has
a good seat in the saddle and uses good Judg
ment.
Owners are notified that a man will be in
attendance every day at Ingleside track operat
ing the starting gate for those trainers who
wish to school their two-year-olds.
S. B. Weems of the New York Daily Tele
gram has wired trainer Jimmy McCormick
that the family of the deceased rider, "Dare-
Devil" Fltzpatrick, have been left in actual
want. A BUDSd^ptlon has been started tor
their relief in New York, and Mr. McCormick
WM asked to see if the horsemen out this way
would contribute. Several hundred dollars
was raised in a very short time, and Jimmy
has a subscription list on which the charitably
inclined can place their name for any amount.
While many are inclined to doubt the ability
of Conley In the saddle, believing luck to be a
strong factor in his success, a well -known
turfman satd yesterday that he considered the
colored lad to be one of the strongest finisher*
he had ever seen.
The excuse made for the reversal in form
shown by Our Climate is that he does not like
a soft track. He Is a very changeable horse in
his notions, and it is just possible that on
certain days he does not.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1898.
THREE ROUNDS
OF FAST HITTING
Jeffries and Ryan Have
a Warm Bout in
Oakland.
What Peter Jackson Intends
Doing if He Wins His Next
Fight.
Dal pawklna Will Make Another
Trip in Quest of
Coin.
George Green and Joe Choynski are
doing the major part of their training
in the Olympic Club. Ryan and Green
are booked to fight before the National
Club on February 26, but this date
may be changed to February 24 and
Choynski and Sharkey will meet on
March 11. but doubtless they will fight
on March 10.
An athlete who has trained for many
battles and who is considered a most
successful trainer of pugilists re
marked yesterday that If he had the
handling of Green and Choynski they
would have to do the greater part of
their exercise in the open air.
"Of course they may have the pleas
ure of good company," said the speak
er, "but it is not handball playing and
bag punching in an impure atmos
phere that will fit George and Joe for
a game that will test the strength of
their lungs when they are fighting for
the long green. "A little good color
In the faces of both men is needed,
and that will not be got from the kind
of exercise they are taking. Lavigne,
Jackson, Dempsey, Fitzsimmons, etc.,
thought more ctf one good hour's ex
ercise in the open air than all the bag
punching and rope skipping they en
gaged in while exercising within
doors."
Jackson is working like a trojan at
Crolls Gardens, Alameda, and the re
port that Peter's trainer had left him.
because Jackson was cranky when In
his cups lacks confirmation.
Jackson, in a chat with Billy Kenne
dy of the Olympic Club a few days
ago, said that time will convince the
sporting pec-ple of this city whether he
is the same oid Peter of six years ago
' or a back number.
"If I am unable to uphold the title
which I now possess, viz., Champion
of England and the Australias," said
Jackson, "then I will gracefully retire
from the ring and seek some other line
of business, but if I can dispose of that
husky young fello-w Jeffries hi any
thing like good fashion, then I shall
expect recognition from Corbett or
Fitzsimmons. If 'Fitz' will not recog
nize my challenge I certainly shall
claim the heavyweight championship
of the world which Mr. Corbett can
disputeâ that is, if he really wants to
fight.
In case Jeffries whips Jackson and
Sharkey disposes of Choynski, the
Olympic Club directors have stated that
they will match the heavyweight coltÃ,
believing that a tight between Tom and
Jim would prove to be a slasher from
start to finish. But Sharkey has prom
ised some of his nearest friends that
win or lose with Choynski he will start
for the gold fields of Alaska next
month.
Tommy Ryan Is training with Jef
fries in Oakland, and Billy Delaney is
superintending the work of both men.
A day or so ago while Jeffries and
Ryan were fitting on the gloves pre
paratory to holding a pleasant little
three-round set-to, some one suggested
that they "liven things up a bit."
"It's a go," answered Ryan quickly.
"How about it, Jeff?" mildly queried
Delaney. And big Jim blushingly re
plied: "All same to me, Billy; that's
how I will learn to hit fast."
They went at it for three rounds, and
the few people who witnessed the little
mill said that it was worth going some
distance to see. Ryan proved that he
was an exceedingly clever fellow and a
great judge of distance. He planted
his left more than once on Jeffries'
nose, but the big Los Angeles heavy
weight warmed Tommy's sides In good
fashion. Jeffries' ducking, Ryan said,
was surprisingly quick, considering the
size of the man. There was no blood
shed, although red spots on the faces
of the fighters were not indiscernible.
It is said that Hawkins is figuring on
a trip to the country, where he expects
to pick up a few golden eagles by whip
ping the champion of an interior town.
Hawkins is in hopes of getting a match
with Erne.
The organization of a new club for
the purpose of permitting and encour
aging amateur athletics was effected
I on the evening of the 9th inst. at the
temporary club rooms, located at 514
Octavia street The name of the club
will be the Jefferson Athletic Club. The

SCHOOL DIRECTOR
WALLER INDICTED BY
THE GRAND JURY
Formally Accused of Asking a Bribe From Eli T.
Sheppard for Placing His Daughter on
the Substitute List.
His Bonds Fixed at $5000, Which Will Be Furnished by Thomas A.
Burns of the School Board and Joseph Naphtalyâ Some
of the Supervisors on the Rack.
An indictment charging School Direc
tor Samuel L. 'Waller with asking a
bribe from Eli T. Sheppard was filed
by the Grand Jury yesterday afternoon.
The filing of the indictment was pre
dicted several days ago, but since then
there occurred a hitch, and yesterday,
for legality's sake, the proceedings were
practically gone over again. It was
found that A. W. Spear, who listened to
the testimony and assisted in all former
proceedings, was not a taxpayer, and
so when the matter came up yesterday,
he was sent out of the room and the
vote on the indictment went on with
out him. Seventeen votes were cast,
and of these twelve were for indict
ment.
Waller was up before the Jury and â 
what he had to say was heard. Then
the vote was taken.
It was a few minutes after 3 o'clock
when the Jury sent In word to Judge
Belcher that If he was willing: It would
like to make a report. He was willing
and stopped the Harbor Commissioners'
case long enough to receive the Jurors
and listen to the business they had to
transact.
When the roll had been called the
District Attorney handed to the Judge
C a folded paper and said that was all
the Jury had to offer. It was an in-
dictment, and Mr. Barnes announced
that while the accused was not at that
time under arrest, it was not necessary
to put the document on the secret file
as there would be no attempt at evad-
ing service. Judge Belcher read the
indictment over and handed it to the
clerk, who placed the file mark upon it,
and under instructions from the court
entered the bail at $5000. No name had
been mentioned, but there were "few in
the courtroom who had not guessed the
subject of the accusation.
Waller had followed the Jurors into
the court and he sat in one of the rear
seats while the indictment was being
filed. Then the proceedings in court
being over, he disappeared for a while
and then returned with School Director
Thomas A. Burns and Joseph F. Naph
taly, the attorney, and an uncle of
the accused, each of whom qualified as
a bondsman in the sum of $5000: but
there was then no court open and no
Judge available to accept the bond, and
so the case was left until this morn
ing when the bench warrant issued on
the indictment will be served. The
bond will be ready then and the arrest
and the release can be made practic
ally at the same time.
The indictment against Waller re
cites that on May 10, 1897, he at the time
being in office as a School Director,
asked of Eli T. Sheppard $500, the con
sideration being that he should get for
Evelyn Louise Sheppard a place in the
School Department as a substitute
teacher.
The witnesses upon whose testimony
the indictment was found were Laura
Jr. Fowler, principal of the Normal
School; R. H. Webster, Superintendent
MAKING READY TO
FIX WATER RATES
Supply of Water Sufficent to
Last 1000 Days Without
Any More Rain.
Vast Sums Have Been Paid by Consumers
to Repair and Extend the Present
Spring Valley System.
The Supervisors will meet at 11 a. m.
to-day- as a committee of the whole to
consider the subject of fixing water
rates for the next year. The constitu
tion requires rates to be fixed in Feb
ruary of each year. Last year so much
time was lost in useless discussion that
the rates were not established during
that month. As a result of the negli
gence the whole board was removed
from office, at the instance of George
K. Fitch in proceedings taken in Judge
Wallace's court. The Supreme Court
in its wisdom or indulgent mercy prac
tically reinstated the ousted Super
visors. In the light of past events it
can be safely predicted that the board
will establish annual rates this month.
Representatives of the Spring Valley
Water Works have been invited to at
tend the session to-day. The company
has already made application, through
its president, Charles Webb Howard,
for a restoration of the rates estab
lished in 1895, or, in effect, an increase
of rates.
According to figures supplied by the
corporation the rate payers of San
Francisco paid in 1896 the sum of $1,
503.152 59. The city paid $213,917 70 and
from other sources the sum of $21,619 84
was collected. The aggregate amount
received by the company for that year
was $1,788,690 16. For the year 1897 the
company collected $1,775,129. The re
port for 1896 shows that the disburse
ment for operating expenses amounted
to $394,012 08; for taxes, $127,289 49; for
interest, $540,261 68; for dividends, $679,
602 50. According to the report the
amount expended for construction was
$432,378 20.
According to the figures of Solon Pat
tee, in 1886, the water company, up to
that time, had paid $11,000,000 in divi
of Schools: Eli T. Eheppard and the de
fendant. Miss Fowler and Mr. Web
ster were not examined directly upon
the charge brought, their testimony be
ing as to the general workings of the
School Department. Their evidence
was given some time ajo. It was
thought, however, that to insure the
validity of the indictment all witnesses
examined by the jury upon the school
matter should be included.
There was quite a gathering of well
known people in the anteroo:.i of the
jury chamber. Supervisor Delany
warmed himself before the fire with a
"very much at home" expression on his
face. Supervisor Haskins was also
present. Judge Low came early and
was rewarded with a prompt release.
Jim Groom and his partner in the Na
tional Athletic Club, J. D. Gibbs, were
on hand with no complaint except at
the delay in their summons to the se
cret chamber, and Auditor Broderick
and Treasurer Widber made up the lfst
of notables.
Next in importance to the school
matter was the investigation into the
charges against the Health and Police
Committee of the Supervisors. The
members of that committee had asked
for an early hearing â before "the jury
became prejudiced." They were called
yesterday afternoon and they told their
stories and denied all that had been
published against them. Supervis. ij-
Delany was given first chance, and S"u
pervisor Haskins, and then Supervisor
Devany came after. A number of the
jurymen had expressed themselves in
such a way, however, that it seems
likely more indictments, with Supervis
ors as subjects, may be found.
Mr. Groom was called and was asked
all manner of questions regarding the
possibility of him having a "cinch" on
all fight permits given by the board.
He was also asked if his club had any
such dealings with the Supervisors as
Young Mitchell claimed to have had.
but to all these questions he answered
no or its equivalent. His partner, Gibbs.
was not called.
Auditor Broderick's business with thiÂ»
jury was in regard to the method of the
payment of court stenographers' fees,
which is done by order of court and not
through the regular channel of the
Auditor's office. It was the fees of the
Police Court stenographers that was
under discussion, and that accounted
for the presence of Judge Low.
Under the present method all that is
neeeFsary is an order of court for the
amount, and this is payable on pres
entation to the Treasurer. The Au
ditor has no chance to investigate any
of these orders of court and as a con
sequence large sums of money are paid
out without any proper check beine:
kept upon the payments. The Auditor
advised that these payments be made
through his office, as in that case he
could compel each stenographer to
show that he had done the work be
fore he could be paid for it.
The Auditor and the Treasurer were
examined at length in the Jury room
upon the subject.
J. W. Bonney, a grocer, against
whom there is a complaint of obtain
ing money by threats and extortion,
also spent a few minutes in the com
pany of the jury. He said he was sure
he could produce a witness on Monday
dends. Since then dividends approxi
mating $7,000,000 have been paid.
Accepting as correct the corporation's
own figures as returned to the Board
of Supervisors, the 'company has dis
bursed on construction account since
1880 the sum of $11,000,000. When the
company was spending this money, col
lected from the water consumers, the
people of the city were assured that the
managers of Spring Valley were pro
viding an adequate supply of water to
tide over three dry seasons, but now at
the apprehended approach of one year
of scant supply the president of the
company asks that rates may be in
creased.
Last February Chief Engineer Schuss
ler entertained the board with a glow
ing sketch of the immense water re
sources immediately available. He de
scribed the great Crystal Springs res
ervoir, with its immense capacity of
nineteen thousand million gallons and
pointed out other available sources
owned by the company, which, added
to Crystal Springs, would insure a sup
ply for 1000 days without the addition
of a single drop of rain during that
period of time. Last year Mr. Schuss
ler told the Supervisors that the waters
of Lake Merced would be fit for use in
the fall of 1898.
Alameda Creek was then furnishing
6,000,000 gallons a day. The Partola
dam was cited as capable of supplying
5,000,000 gallons a day. All these out
side sources were referred to as con
venient when the water in Crystal
Springs "bloomed."
Every assurance was given that a
large and never-failing supply had
been secured by the vast outlay of
money As some mention has been
made of the cost of pumping water, it
is in order to refer to what Mr. Schuss
ler told the Board of Supervisors one
year ago. Then he said: "We are now
using the water that comes from the
Calaveras Valley to the Alameda pipe
line, taking it out near Niles station

DEFENDED HIS POSITION.
Auditor Broderick Appears Be
fore the Teachers' Annuity
Association.
The Teachers' Annuity and Retire
ment Fund Association met yesterday
at the rooms of the Board of Education
to hear from Superintendent of Schools
Webster and Auditor Broderick regard
ing the controversy between the two
officials over payment of the warrants
drawn on the fund.
Auditor Broderick claims that he has
refused to sign the warrants drawn by
the Commissioners because the man
ner of handling the funds is not ac
cording to law.
He explained his position to the ;
teachers, assured them of his friend â¢ J
ship and was given an ovation when he I
said he would do everything in his |
power to assist them when the fund '
was in legal shape.
He attacked Mayor Phelan and his
attorney fur unwisely advising the I
teachers to employ special counsel to â 
test his action, and advised them to j
wait until they could secure the serv- I
ices of the District Attorney.
Chairman O'Connor appointed thefol- ;
lowing executive committee: A. L. j
Mann, vice chairman; Miss Mary E.
Donnelly, Miss Mary A. Dean, Mrs. |
Mary A. Prag. Miss (\ Hunt. Miss Em
ma Stincen. Thomas H. McCarthy, Miss

Will Not Give Up.
E. C. Kilpatrick, who was suspended
as principal of the Business Evening
School by the Board of Eduoation,
pending charges against him, has re
fused to vacate his position.
He wrote the secretary of the board I
yesterday, in answer to a notification \
Of his suspension, stating that his at- !
torney had advised him that the board j
had not acted legally and that he I
would report for duty at the school as I
usual.
C. L. Barririgton. president of the j
Board of Education, has declared the |
action taken by the Committee on j
Rules and by the full Board of Educa- !
tion against Principal Kilpatrick and i
School Teacher Stanton as void and in- j
valid. He claims that th.c action of the j
board was not in conformity with the j
rules governing the procedure. He
cites the following rules as necessary j
in an action taken against a teacher ->r i
a principal:
Section 177 â All complaints or charges
against any teacher or principal of the
School Department shall be made in writ
ing, addressed to the president of the
Board of Education, properly verified be
fore the secretary of the board and filed
with this officor.
The secretary shall at once notify the
president of the board, and the latter
shall call a meeting of the proper com
mittee within three days.
running It to Belmont and there pump
ing it, because it is much cheaper, at
present at least, than to build a very
large, expensive dam at Calaveras and
a very expensive tunnel and pipe line.
The interest on the cost of that plant
would be a great deal more than what
it costs to run the water across this
way and pump it."
Accepting the former statements of
Spring Valley representatives as cor
rect, the conclusion must be reached
that the time has now arrived for a
substantial reduction In water rates.
Since 1880 the people have paid as
much to repair and extend the Spring
Valley system as it would cost to bring
from the mountains a supply sufficient
for a city of a half million Inhabitants.
A YOUTHFUL LOTTERY AGENT.
Ah Tang, 10 Years of Age, Arrested
by Sergeant Shea and Fosse.
A Chinese lad, 10 years of age, named
Ah Tang, was arrested Wednesday even
ing by Sergeant Shea and posse on Rosa
alley, and charged at the California-street
police station with aiding and abetting
Chinese lottery. It is claimed by the of
ficers that the Chinese merchants have
the children throughout Chinatown carry
the tickets from place to place to avoid
arrest of the merchants, as it was pre
sumed by them that the children would
not be noticed by the officers on duty in
that district.
They did not appreciate the efforts of the
arresting officers, and It is said they have
made a record there which will be hard to
surpass. The boy was released from cus
tody by L,y Pong, who put up $100 as ball
for the boy's appearance in court. The
lottery tickets were held as evidence.

The relatives and friends of the late j
Peter G. Camarinos, the Hawaiian
I planter who died on December 8 at the !
Agnews Asylum for the Insane, are not |
satisfied with the report of the physi
! cians of the Institution attributing the â 
: cause of death to paresis and to gen- '
eral paralysis. They are inclined to be j
lieve the story of Griffiths, a discharged â 
patient of the institution, who says he
! saw the special attendant of the un- i
fortunate man kick and maltreat him '
only a few hours before death occurred, j
That special attendant was John '
I Lynn, who, on the morning of February
1, attempted to take the life of his wife j
I by sending several bullets into her body ;
!in Oakland. Lynn is now in the Ala- â 
| meda County Jail, either insane or !
| feigning insanity.
When ramarinos was sertt to the
asylum in May of last year the rela
tives of the demented man engaged
Lynn to take care of him. Lynn was j
recommended as a careful nurse by Dr.
Sponagle. the superintending physician
of the Agnews Asylum. A private ward
and a special room were engaged for [
the patient and his attendant, and
about the time he was taken there a ,
man named John R. Griffiths was ad- !
mitted to the institution.
Griffiths had a mild form of dementia,
and he was given special liberties about
the place for the services he returned
to the physicians and attendants. Grif
fiths says he became well acquainted
with Lynn, and. a few days before Oa
marinos died he declares he saw Lynn
cruelly and most shamefully abuse his
patient.
He says he heard Camarinos com
plain about the way his breakfast was
prepared, and then he says Lynn struck
him.
Camarinos, who was a powerful man
and violent at times in his insanity,
knocked Lynn down, and was punish
ing his nurse severely when two other
attendants ean>e to his assistance.
Griffiths says he saw the two mpn
throw Camarlnoa to the floor, and
while they held him down on his back
Lynn jumped on him, landing on his
FROM TELEPHONE TO TITLE.
Sadie Holmes, H Hello Girl," Now Ladu Bretherton.
From the humble position of telephone operator in California to wealth,
rank and title in England is something of a transition, and a stroke of fortune
so great that it seldom takes place. Yet It sometimes does occur, as is seen in
the case of the pretty operator at the branch office of the telephone company
in the Palace Hotel, who was yesterday Sadie Holmes, tho "hello girl," and who
to-day is Lady Bretherton, mistress of a manor in Wales.
Frederick Holmes, the wild young scion of an old "Welsh family, after knock
ing about the world for many years, finally settled down in Panama, where he
married the daughter of a prominent Spanish family. A daughter, the present
heiress, now 21 years old, was born to the couple, who shortly after moved up to
this city, where the father entered the Custom House brokerage business on
Battery street.
As the years rolled on the little child grew into a beautiful woman, and, as
times were hard, applied for and obtained a place in the employ of the Pacific
Bell Telephone Company. There she remained, hearing from her father's lips
the story of her family and their importance in the English world, but never
dreaming of being anything else than a Cinderella in the circle. But the years
had wrought changes In Wales as well as in California, and the older branches
of the family tree had dropped off one by one until only an elderly aunt of Mr.
Holmes, Lady Jane Bretherton, was left. A short time ago she also died, and
by the laws of England Mr. Holmes comes in for all of the property, which is
valued at over Â£200,000, except the lands in Wales, which, together with the
title of Lady Bretherton, go to bis eldest daughter, Sadie.
PETER G. CAMARINOS,
stomach with both feet. Several times
it is claimed Lynn repeated his assault,
and when they picked the prostrate
man up from the floor-he had fainted.
W. D. "Vanvales, a nephew of the de
ceased, took a deep interest In his un
cle's welfare, and he frequently visit
ed the asylum. He called on Oamari
nos only a few days before his death,
and he says the demented man was in
good physical health then. Late in the
forenoon of December 8 he received a
telegram from Dr. Sponagle, telling
him that Camarinos was very ill.
Shortly after noon of the same day an
other dispatch was received announc
ing his death.
Vanvales wired back to have the
body sent to San Francisco as soon as
possible, and early the next morning it
arrived. It was taken at once to the
undertaking parlors of Halsted & Co.,
and when the coffin was opened, less
than twenty-four hours after death had
been announced to have taken, place,
the body was found to be in an ad
vanced stage of decomposition. Several
of the friends of the relatives of the
dead man saw the body and
at the time they remarked upon
the condition the body was in and also
discussed the presence of a marked dis
coloration about the body in the region
of the stomach and breast. They could
not tell, however, whether the marks
were from bruises or from natural de
composition.
The undertaker was of the opinion
that Camarinos hart been dead at least
two and possibly three days when he
received the body, and the relatives of
the dead man were of the belief that
death had possibly occurred before De
cember 8, and that the body was kept
a day or two at the asylum until de
composition had effaced the marks of
the bruises before the relatives were
notified of the sudden collapse and
death of the demented man.
The officials and attaches of the asy
lum discredit the story told by Grif
fith. They say even if the scuffle al
leged to have taken place between
Camarinos and Lynn had actually
occurred it would have been impossible
for Griffith to have witnessed it, for he
was confined in ward 2 and Camarinos
was a patient in ward 6, and the two
wards are on different floors. The con
necting doors are kept securely locked
and the patients of the two wards are
not allowed to mingle, as those in ward
6 are of a violent type and those in
ward 2 are considered to be of a
milder disposition.
The statement that the scuffle never
took place is assisted by the testimony
of the regular. attendantsâ Dowd, Wil
son and McCabeâ and that of the two
physicians in charge of the asylum
patientsâ Drs. Chrystal and Stocking.
Dr. Sponagle said the first he had heard
of the affair was when he read it in the
paper, and said that if it happened at
all he most certainly would have heard
of it.
Camarinos was committed to the asy
lum in May last, and was suffering
from paresis in an advanced stage at
that time. He had been under medical
care for three years previous, and was
subject to periodical paralytic strokes
which would leave him in a very weak
ened state. He would rally from these
attacks, however, and would again be- |
come physically strong and at the same i
time vicious, and would strike, kirk !
and bite his nurse, and It sometimes be
came necessary to call in the assist
ance of one or two other attendants to i
quiet him.
The officers of the asylum say Lynn
made an excellent nurse. He was em
ployed by the relatives of Camarinos i
to attend him. Lynn has two diplomas !
as a trained nurse for the insane, and
had been employed in the Utica Asy
lum and other institutions. He ap- !
peared particularly interested in keep- j
ing Camarinos alive, as he was in re
ceipt of $45 a month and board and j
lodging in return for his services, and j
was heard to remark on many occa- I
sions, when Camarinos seemed about
to succumb to the attacks, "I hope this
man will not die, for I would he out
of a job." The officials say that the
life of Camarinos was prolonged by
reason of the excellent care and atten
tion given him by Lynn.
The decomposition setting in within
twenty-four hours after Camarinos'
death, the asylum doctors say, was not j
unusual, as he was also afflicted with j
bed seres, and decomposition would |
quickly follow death under those condi- j
tions. <
The officials are emphatic in their de
nial of such an occurrence as related by
Griffith. A number of the patients
speak well of Lynn, and on the other
hand they doubt strongly Griffith's ve
racity.

ONLY A LITTLE
SACK OF GOLD
Story of a Special Deposit Made
in the City Treasury
Vaults.
Auditor Broderiek Says That
Should Bo Given Back to the
Plumbers.
A little sack containing: $500, more or
less, that rests on a shelf in the massive
vaults of the Treasurer's office is causing;
no enu of turmoil in the minds of certain
officials of the City Hall. The money
rests there in the name of Secretary Ed
mund Godehaux of the Board of Health,
but it does not belong to him, and as a
matter of fact it is a much mooted ques
tion In 'some minds whether or not he has
the right to hold it at all.
The sack represents the amount of feea
that were collected from plumbers before
it was found that the plumbing regula
tions formulated by thÂ© Board of Health
were not tenable.
The board adopted certain rules regard
ing the plumbing of buildings and also
required that ull plumbers should regis
ter with the department and also pay a
license fee of $1 50 for the privilege. Later
it was demonstrated that the Health
Board had no right to pass or try to en
force such an order, and that It waa
getting into a conflict with Uie powers
of thu Board of Supervisors. An at
tempt was then made to induce the Su
pervisors to adopt an order covering the
ground desired by the Health Depart
ment, but thus far the attempt has been
unsuccessful. In the meantime the col
lection of fees went on until several hun
dred dollars were in the hands of Secre
tary Godehaux. This was deposited in
the secretary's name and was never turn
ed into the public treasury.
Auditor Broderick says that the board
has no right to keep the money and that
it should be returned to those who paid
it*to the secretary. "It was collected un
der an invalid act of the Health Board,"
said Mr. Broderick, "and should have
been returned when the Board of Super
visors refused to act in the matter. If
Secretary Godehaux should die to-mor
row that money could be claimed by his
heirs and the plumbers would not be able
to recover a cent."
SIXTH SYMPHONY
AT THE TIVOLI.
The Largest Audience of the Season
and a Well Made Programme
Well Played.
The programme of yesterday's sym
phony concert at the Tlvollâ the sixth of
the seriesâ was made up and played with
tact and good sense and listened to by
the largest audience of the season. It
was a conspicuously fine programme and
one that did not bore the musio lovers
of the audience by including any of the
usual "joyful relief" pieces.
Beethoven's "Heroic" symphony, a
work that Scheel has given here before
with splendid effect, was the special
event and was played with beautiful
sonority and analysis. Perhaps the
funeral march was played with slightly
less nobility and perfection of detail than
at the earlier performance, but on the
whole the interpretation and execution
were admirable. The scherzo especially
was a remarkable achievement, even sur
passing the previous performance in
the unanimous delicacy of the strings.
In the Liszt symphonic poem. "Les Pre
ludes " a composition of remarkable su
perficial brilliancies if not of very deep
emotional character, the band displayed
excellent variety and discipline. The
"Rheingold" excerptâ "The entrance of
the gods into Walhalla"â and Rein
ecke's "Peace Jubilee" overture com
pleted one of the most successsful con
certs ever given in San Francisco.
