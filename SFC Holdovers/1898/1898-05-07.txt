THREE HUNDRED SPANISH KILLED
AND FOUR HUNDRED WOUNDED
RIOTS ALL OVER SPAIN
BUT THE SOLDIERS STILL
KEEP PEACE AT MADRID
In the Cortes Moret Challenges a Direct Vote of
Confidence and Says the Government Is
Ready to Give Up Office.
Copyrighted. IS9B, by James Gordon Bennetr,
GIBRALTAR. May 6.â Riots have
taken place all over Spain â at Oviedo,
Ciudad Real and other places. In all
rases martial law has been declared.
The revolutionary spirit is rife.
MADRID, May 6.â There is absolute
ly not a word of truth in the rumors
that have evidently cror-jd the frontier
that Madrid is in a" state of riot. Every
thing here is despairingly quiet.
Communication with Manila is cut off
and news from Cuba is of the most un
interesting character. Naturally enough
the news that the Alfonso XIII had ar
rived at Porto Rico has caused great
satisfaction, but nothing has happened
since Monday that is even worthy of
note.
The Government, by placing the city
in the hands of the military, has com
pletely cowed those who sought to pro
mote disorder, and not one demonstra
tion has been made since it was made
clear that no mercy would be shown to
agitators. Every one is satisfied that
the Government does not mean to be
bulldozed. Those who would like to
do it are too timid, and all others are
perfectly satisfied that the interna
tional affairs of Spain have not gone
astray. In short, for a moment stagna
tion is the word that best defines affairs
here at present.
The Heraldo publishes a dispatch
from General Blanco from Havana say
ing that an American attempt to dis
embark troops at Salada has been de
feated, the disembarking force being
compelled to withdraw. The Spanish
had four wounded. The captain gen
eral also says the Americans were
beaten in their attempt to land at
Banes.
In the Cortes to-day Senor Moret,
Minister for the Colonies in a speech
regarded as the best in his political
career and repeatedly interrupted by
enthusiastic <-heering, insisted that the
throne, "occupied by only a young and
promising monarch and afterward by
his widow and child, must not be
blamed for the policy of different gov
ernments." The responsibility existed,
he declared, as the burden of all and
each should hear his share instead of
trying to shift the blame to a neighbor.
He defended autonomy as "granted to
Cubr ' generously, under the friendly
advice of the powers, in order to de
prive the Americans of a pretext to fo
n.er' discontent and rebellion, and
challenged a ect -Â« . - confidence,
declaring the Government would resign
if it was not carried.
Autonomy. he maintained, had
achie.ed consideration and improved
the economic situation. He pointed, as
*. proof of its succesp above all others,
Seizure of the French Steamship Lafayette, off Havana.
THE SPANISH FLEET IS
NOT AT THE CANARIES
NEW YORK, May 6.â ln view of the great Im
portance of locating the Spanish fleet that left
Cape de Verde last Friday morning, the Herald
has succeeded in obtaining information that proves
that up to last Wednesday the fleet had not ar
rived at the Canary Islands. The Herald-Call's
correspondent cables as follows:
"FUNCHAL, Madeira Islands, May 6.â Advices
received from Teneriffe, dated May 4, report that
there are no Spanish warships in the Canaries."
The dispatches also say there is no excite
ment whatever in the Grand Canaries.
to the "loyal friendship and ssistance
of the Cubans in the present war
against the United States."
With regard to the question of un
preparedness, Senor Moret candidly
confessed that he had not believed un
til the very last war would come, as
he considered the Americans were "in
capable of attacking Spain without the
slightest cause," bjut "when convinced
that the United States was bent upon
despoiling Spain, then with the entire
Cabinet he seriously prepared to re
pel an unjust attack, purchasing and
fitting out warships and procuring war
material irrespective of cost," resolv
ing to "make a strong stand and con
verting a peace-lovir- people into a
warlike cabinet."
In pathetic terms Senor Moret cleared
himself of the charges of a press which
was, he said, "trying to load all the
sins of the nation" upon him. He as
serted that he yielded to .ione in pat
riotism and was always acting to se
cure what he thought best for his coun
try's welfare. In conclusion he ap
pealed to the patriotism of the na
tion and the chamber to "assist and ad-
vise the Government in its defense of
the rights and honor of Spain," a task
which was "the work of all, with the
collective after responsibility of the
Minister to the Cortes and the nation."
Senor Moret resumed his seat amid
thunders of applause, deputies crowd
ing around him, loading him with con
gratulations.
In the Senate Senor Puigierver refused
any explanations as to the war inten-
tions of the Government. In reply to
a question whether measures had been
taken in view of the industrial crisis
due to the diminution of the stock of
coal, he said the Government was in
quiring into the question, and if neces
The San Francisco Call
sary would prevent the exportation of
coal.
In the Congress, Senor Capdopon,
Minister of the Interior, asked the Dep
uties to suspend Judgment as to the
Manila engagement until detailed re
ports had been received.
CALIFORNIA HAS
NOTHING TO FEAR.
War Department Officials Say This
Coast Is in No Danger
Whatever.
WASHINGTON. May 6.â Senator
White was at the War Department
again to-day to see General Greely,
Chief Signal Officer, and urged that a
cable be laid to the Farallon Islands.
The matter was taken under advise
ment. It may be said, however, that
despite Senator White's urging the War
Department officials fail to see the util
ity of such a calle. They ridicule the
dispatch from Madrid, printed in this
morning's papers, to the effect that the
Spanish fleet would attack California
coast cities.
"California has nothing to fear, now
that Commodore Dewey has destroyed
the Philippine squadron, which was the
only serious menace to the Californian
cities and Pacific Coast shipping inter
ests," said a War Department official
to-day. General Miles concurs in this.
SEWELL MAY NOT
TAKE A COMMAND.
Declines a Major-Generalship if it
Means His Resignation as
Senator.
NEW YORK, May 6.â A Washington
correspondent of the Herald says: Sen
ator W. J. Sewell of New Jersey, whose
commission as major-general of volun
teers was signed by the President to
day, left for his home in Camden this
afternoon. Before leaving he said he
was still undecided about accepting the
appointment. An intimate friend of
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
Senator Sewell who is in the Senator's
confidence said to me to-night:
"I don't think that Senator Sewell
will accept the place. You can state as
a positive fact that if it is necessary for
him to jrfve up /iis seat in the Senate
he will decline $he appointment. The
appointment came to Senator Sewell
without any so king in his part, and
while he !s rea^.y f.n-1 willing to serve
his country and gt> to the front if
necessary, he thinks for the present, at
least, his State has first claim an his
services. He has placed the matter in
the hands of Attorney-General Grigps,
who will look up the law and prece
dents in the case, and the Senator will
await his decision."
SCHLEY'S SQUADRON MAY
SOON BE IN ACTION.
Two Cruisers of Exceptional Fight-
ing Ability Added to His Ships
of War.
ON BOARD the flagship Brooklyn,
off Fort Monroe, Old Point Comfort,
Va., May 6. â To-day's developments on
the flying squadron would seem to in
dicate that Commodore Schley, one of
the best strategists and most daring
men in the navy, will be given a
chance for action within a few days.
The cruiser Minneapolis arrived here
this afternoon at 5 o'clock, and
the New Orleans will be here early
in the morning. These additions
make a squadron of exceptional
fighting ability. The New Orleans
as a fighting ship is superior to
the Columbia, which was detached, and
the Scorpion with her splendid arma
ment helps to fill out a squadron that
will give a good account of itself.
The Minneapolis was ordered to New
port News for coal immediately upon
her arrival and will be coaled to-night.
Flag Lieutenant Sears ordering a
hurry job. If the New Orleans gets
here to-morrow she will be coaled im
mediately and with the addition of the
tug Fowler as a water boat and the
collier just attached the flying squad
ron will be complete.
AGAIN APPEALS TO
AUSTRIA'S EMPEROR.
Spain's Queen Regent Not Yet With-
out Hope of Europe Inter
vention.
LONDON, May 6.â The Vienna cor
respondent of the Daily Jail says:
"The Spanish Queen Regent has again
appealed to Emperor Francis Joseph to
use his Influence In favor of European
intervention. Count Goluchowskl, the
Austrian Foreign Minister, has ad
dressed a note to the powers on the
subject. I understand that but for
England's pro-American attitude ser
tain European powers would have
openly sided with Spain before the war
broke out."
The Copenhagen correspondent of the
Daily Mail says: "Baron Wedel-Jarts
berg, the Scandinavian Minister at
Madrid, telegraphs that Spain intends
to protest to the powers against the
infringement against the international
law in America's failure to make the
Cuban blockade effective."
CRUISER DUBOURDIEU
ARRIVES AT HAVANA.
Carries the Admiral of the French
Fleet of Warships in the

HAVANA. May 6.â This morn tag
about 11 o'clock El Morro was signaled
by a French warship, and at 12:45 p. m.
the second-class cruiser Dubourdieu.
from Martinique, entered the harbor.
She carries the admiral of the French
fleet in the Antilles.
When the Dubourdieu passed the
American squadron the cruiser Mont
gomery hoisted -n Italian flag, but
when the mistake was discovered she
promptly hoisted the French flag,
whereupon the Dubourdieu answered
her salute.
At 4:30 this afternoon the commander
of the Dubourdieu, accomanied by the
French Consul, visited General Blanco.
The Entire Fleet of the Dons at
Manila Destroyed, With No
Loss on the Ameri
can Side.
NEW YORK, May 7.â The New York World, in an
extra just issued, publishes a dispatch from Hongkong to
the effect that the dispatch-boat McCulloch has arrived
there bringing the news of the fight at Manila.
The report states that the entire fleet of eleven Spanish
vessels was totally destroyed and that 300 Spaniards were
killed and 400 wounded.
No lives were lost on the American fleet and but six
persons were injured, while no material injury was done to
any of the American vessels.
WASHINGTON, May 7. â The Navy Department has
received a cablegram from Hongkong announcing the ar
rival there of the revenue cutter McCulloch.
This is the only information received, but the Depart
ment expects advices within the next three or four hours. .
AMERICAN EMBASSY
AT PARIS UNDER
POLICE PROTECTION
LONDON, May 7. â Special dispatches from Paris say
the seizure of the steamer Lafayette has intensified the bit
ter feeling against the United States. Angry expressions are
heard, and the United States Embassy has been placed un
der special police protection in view of a possible hostile
demonstration.

KEY WEST, Fla., May 6.â The
French liner Lafayette of St. Nazaire,
for Havana and Brazilian ports, was
to-day brought to this port, a prize,
by the gunboat Wilmington. The La
fayette was heading into Havana
when hove to by a shot from the
gunboat Annapolis. The vessel has
a general cargo and carried a large
number of passengers. Her comman
der made a vigorous protest against
the seizure of his ship.
The capture took place yesterday
afternoon, and was made close
enough to Havana for it to have been
witnessed by the signal men on
Morro Castle. It was about 3 o'clock
when smoke was descried to the
northward, and a few minutes after
the first smudge had been seen the
gunboat Annapolis, which had been
cruising to the eastward off Havana,
swung her dow to the northward
and went driving in the direction of
the smoke. Away on her port beam
the Herald-Call's fleet -ispatch-boat,
Dewey, had also sighted tne quarry,
and went scampering to the north
ward, anxious to see the meeting be
tween the inward bound steamer and
the blockading men-of-war. The in
comer hove her masts and then her
bright red funnels into view, and as
her long black hull rose above the
horizon I noticed a stir among the
other ships of the blockading squad
ron, most of whom had run down to
the' westward to participate in the
capture of a small coasting schooner.
To me the incomer looked as if she
might be an armed transport, and I
suppose she appeared the same to the
blockaders. At any rate they quick
ly deserted the schooner and came
racing toward the Annapolis with
throttles open and crews at quar
ters, ready and eager to render as
sistance in case their consort was
overmatched.
There was dead silence for a while
as the ships neared their common
goal, and then there came a spurt of ]
flame and drift of smoke from the |
bow gun of the Annapolis.
The stranger was plainly jn sight,
and the "bone of his mouth" grew
j none the smaller as the deep boom of
j the discharge went rolling over the
waters.
There was another flash and re
port, and I saw a small geyser rise
I near the bow of the steamer as if she
had flung an inverted cataract in the
air. At any rate the steamship came
to a sudden stop, and tne Annapolis,
ranging abeam, lowered a boat and
sent an officer .to investigate the
character of the vessel.
The three warships lay by until
the boat from the Annapolis started
i back from the liner to the gunboat.
j Then, suddenly, to the astonishment
Jof all on board the warships, the
Frenchman blew a long whistle and
put on full steam ahead, pointing
straight to the entrance of Havana
! harbor.
The after gun of the Annapolis
forthwith sent a mandatory message
| which the French captain must have
i plainly comprehended, for he stopped
I his ship immediately and followed
with the order to back.
A string of signal flags in the
: international code went fluttering to
I the mast head of th_ Annapolis.
j These supplemented the oraer of the
i gun, and in their volapuk of the sea
: warned the captain that he must re
main hove to until bidden to depart
! in peace, otherwise he might go in
| pieces.
Then ensued a long wait, during
; which time the ships of the blockad
; ing fleet held commune with each
I other by means of signal flags, mega
| phones and the wigwag code. The
i final result was that the Lafayette
j and her hostages were heided for
| Key West, with the Wilmington in |
| her wake to see that she traveled in
! a straight path and over the road
! called rough by those who traverse it :
in dispatch boats.
The Lafayette is a fine vessel of
the old type. She is 344 feet long,

ty-eight feet deep. She was built in
1864, at Greenock, of iron.
THE SEIZURE WAS
ALL A MISTAKE.
It Had Been Stipulate! Before Slia
Sailed tfhat the Lafayette Could
Ent~-r Havana Harbor.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 6.â Tha
Lafayette was released and sailed
just before port closed to-night. Thia
was done in accordance with impera
tive instructions from Washington.
She was not attended by United
States warships. She headed straight!
for Havana, bearing passports that
permit her to enter. Captain Do
Chaplaine told the pilot who took the
Lafayette through tlie channel that
the Americans daied not hold a
French vessel, and seemed greatly
elated at his release.
The capture of the Frenchman by
the gunboat Annapolis turns out to
have been an unfortunate incident,
resulting from mistakes, but no pro
test has bsen made to the representa
tives of the French Government in
the United States.
The officials here declare that thia
will close the affair. It appears that
before the Lafayette sailed for Ha
vana, the French legation in Wash
ington was instructed to communi
cate with the State Department. This
was done and permission granted to
the steamer to enter and discharge
her passengers and cargo with tho
understanding that she would taka
on nothing there. Instructions for
the fulfillment of this agreement
were sent from Washington to Ad
miral Sampson's squadron, and it
was only learned to-day, after the
capture was made, that they were
never delivered.
This afternoon United States Com
missioner Otto, United States Dis
trict Attorney Stripling and a num
ber of other Federal officials went
over to the Lafayette, examined her
papers and cabled the State Depart
ment for instructions. These cams2
SPAIN'S FLAG
FLOATS OVER
FIREBAUGH
Castiliao Cutthroats Hoist the
Colors QY)d Defy AmericaQS
to Remove Them.
STOCKTON, May 6.â News that defiant Spaniards had hoisted the
colors of the enemy at Firebaugh was received at Tracy this afternoon
and transmitted to the authorities here. Arrogant truck gardeners, lit
tle counting the probable cost of their treasonable conduct, raised the
hated colors of the Land of the Butcher and American sentiment was
i.ot strong enough in the immediate vicinity to replace them with the
Stars and Stripes.
Firebaugh is in old settlement on the upper San Joaquin River and
has always remained und.r Spanish dominance. Since the war began
a cut-throat element has terrorized the place, but it committed no
overt act until to-day, when it procured the banner of tyranny and
blood and raised it on the highest flagpole in the place, making threats
against any one who offered objections. All day long and at last re
ports the emblem of the crumbling kingdom .waved defiance to the
nation in which the ignorant wretches enjoy liberty and protection.
The people of Tracy are much incensed and t"~e act may bring
severe retribution upon its authors before morning. It is proposed to
burn the Spanish flag and make all suspicious characters in the place
salute the American flag or go elsewhere.
Tho railroad men at Tracy are American to the core, and their
justice may be r >re severe than the Spaniard lticipaie.
To-day's demonstration will cause the authorities to urge the re
cruiting of military compa~i^s as soon as the prese t ones are sworn
into the United States service, as several settlements in this section
may require protection f-om ill-advise' Spanish settlers.
without delay, in the form of an
order to Commodore Watson.
Of the 168 passengers on board the
Lafayette 78 are for Havana, nearly
all being young Spaniards, who say
they are going to Cuba to engage in
mercantile pursuits. One Cuban was
aboard who was returning to join
the insurgent army. He was ban
ished from t^e island several months
ago, but came within the terms of
General Blanco's armistice just be
fore the war began. He was over- j
joyed when told that he would be
taken with the regular Jnited States
troops when they moved. The local
Junta took him in charge, and he
leaves for Tampa to-night. The Unit
ed States authorities who examined
the Lafayette to-day say that so far
v the ship's manifest goes she car
ries no contraband of war, but with
such an immense cargo it was impos
sible to make a thorough -nspection.
They saw nothing in the nature of
arms or ammunition on board. Her
release constitutes the first official
act of Commodore Watson in his new
command of this division of Admiral
Sampson's fleet. He arrived on the
Olivette to-day and immediatelywent
on board the cruiser Cincinnati, where
he hoisted his flag. The ships in the
harbor boomed a commodore's salute
of eleven guns this afternoon. This
customary act of courtesy to a new
commanding officer had a distressing
effect on the Lafayette's passengers.
The Federal officials were diningwith
Captain Chapleta at the tim^. and
suddenly found themselves in the
midst of a panic. The Spaniards
yelled that the enemy had opened
fire, and they scampered about the
decks tc find places of shelter. Some
of them burst frantically into the
captain's cabin and begged the Ameri
cans to save their lives. One Mexi
can woman, wife of a Spaniard, was
seized with a spasm when the An- '
napolis held up the Lafp.yette yes
terday, duplicated that performance
when the salute was fired, and for
some time it was feared her life was
in danger.

URGES POLICY
OF IMMEDIATE
CUBAN INVASION
Secretary filler Anxious to Dis
patch the Arri)y Now Mob
ilized in the South.
NEW YORK. May 6.â A Washington special to the Herald Bays:
There is still a great difference of opinion among leaders of the
army as to the most advisable plan to be followed in invading Cuba.
The present policy, and that which is being urged by Secretary Alger,
is to send immediately the entire army of 17,000 troops, now mobilized
at extreme Southern points, over to Cuba and have them attack Ha
vana in conjunction with Admiral Sampson's fleet. There is even a
strong probability that the first detachment of these troops ha r e al
ready landed in Cuba.
Â«Many army officers, most prominent of whom are medical authori
ties, have advised that the grand movement against Cuba be put off
until the early fall months, when the danger from yellow fever will be
much less than it is at the present time. It is proposed by advocates of
this latter plan to have the 5000 troops now at Tampa sent to Cuba in
Tetachments for the purpose of carrying supplies and ammunition to
the army of General Go- ez. They claim that with the help thus af
forded by the United States the insurgents will be amply able to hold
their ground until such time as the Government shall decide that it
is safe to send a large army against Havana.
In discussing the plans all officers of the War Department are In
clined to believe that the movement will not be put off, but that the
original policy of immediately taking Havana will be followed, if the
future operations show that the army is running too much danger
from yellow fever the troops will be withdrawn from Cuba and 10,000
immunes will be sent to assist the insurgents. Colonel Wood of the
Mounted Riflemen will stay on Cuban territory, no matter how great
the risk.
persons. A long procession esconeu
the company from Armory Hall to the
depot, including a band, fraternal so
cieties, school children and citizens.
The company marched between a long
file of school children, who showered
them with bouquets and strewed their
path with flowers. There was firing
of cannon, ringing of bells and blow
ing of whistles. This is the banner

ARKANSAS RIVER
IS ON A RAMPAGE.
Lives Lost, Farms Inundated and a
Nur ber of Dwellings Swept
Away.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 6.â The Ar
kansas River is on a rampag", and has
left its banks, doing Incalculable damage
to property and causing the loss of an un
known number of lives. The situation is
growing worse evÂ«?ry hour. The Verdi-
Kris, and Illinois are rushing great tor
rents into the Arkansas. At Van Buren
miles of country are inundated, farms in
some instances being eight feet under
water.
Several farmhouses have bÂ»en swept
away above Little Rock, and in one in
stance an entire family were drowned.
Below the city the situation is very
alarming and many of the big cotton
plantations have already sustained heavy
damage. Tho levee opposite Grady, in
Lincoln County, has broken and the town
is threatened with destruction.
A boat sent down the river to rescue
the people living along the river below
Pine Bluffs was unable to make the re
turn trip. About 100 people wtre rescued.
At one place the rescuers learned that
a family of four were entirely cut off by
the water an . were in great danger, but
they could not be rescued on account of
the swift current.

DORAN NERVOUS.
The Contractor for the Seats Blames
the Management.
T. F. Doran, the contractor who had
charge of the erection of seats In the
Pavilion, was seen shortly after the
stands supporting the chairs had col
lapsed, lit- was In a highly nervous con
dition and his features were drawn with
anxiety. In speaking about the unlooked
for accident, he said:
"I claim right now that when the man
agement allowed these people to go upon
my structure it was accepted. Mr.
O'Shauphnessy was In the Pavilion all
day overlooking the work. He ordered me
to put on extra braces where it was nec
essary, which I did. He told me to put
on extra bracing in the gallery, but he
did not go up there to see whether I had
followed out his instructions. I know I
am up against it awful hard. For the
past few years I have had charge of the
carpentering work for the various clubs,
but this is the first time an accident has
occurred. There would not have been
one had the management not allowed an
overcrowding. I contracted to seat a
certain number of people, and was to re
ceive $1125. The contract was for 6000 seats
downstairs and 4000 in the gallery. I car
ried out my contract to the full extent of
my ability. They simply overcrowded the
structures and they could not stand the
excessive weight.
"In constructing the seating arrange
ment I left aisles on the main floor, so
that people possessing side seats could
pass, but instead of going to their rightful
seats the holders of such tickets rushed
on to the raised seats, making them sus
tain double weights. The management
was responsible for this, but I did not
warn it because I thought my structures
were perfectly safe.
"I was to receive my money right after
the preliminary event had been decided,
but have not as yet been paid. I have not
asked for it, because I don't suppose they
would give it to me. li I don't get it I
can't tell at present what I shall do.
"I told them I would be through with
my work yesterday, but unforeseen de
lays prevented me from finishing It. We
rushed the work In the afternoon up to
the time the doors were opened. I was
compelled to put in extra bracing and ex
tra timber by order of the Fire Marshal,
and he warned me that he would not al
low the fight to proceed if I did not obey
him.
"A great many people told me not to
say anything to the reporters, but as long
as I will be roasted I thought It best to
set myself straight."
Mr. Doran pointed to a tier of seats
extending ten feet high, and stated that
Mr. O'Shaughnessy thought it was weak,
yet it had not fallen. The reason why it
had not is that the peode did not over
crowd it. He continued: "I think the
first collapse was caused by a defective
piece of timber, and when that went down
it started other portions of the structure.
As long as these folks have paid their
money to see the fight, I think I am en
titled to what la due me. I am sorry they
did not get their moneys worth."

GENERALS
CONFIDENT
j Spanish Officers Think
Cuba and Porto Rico
Are Safe.
Believe Insurgents Will Be
Beaten When They Fight
in the Open.
But They Are Not So Sanguine Con
cerning the Blockade of
Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 4.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standard says:
Many Spanish generals with consid
erable experience in Cuba, with whom
Senor Sagasta has consulted, assure
him they are confident that General
Blanco in Cuba and General Macias in
Porto Rico can hold on and make their
respective islands very uncomfortable
for the invaders as long as the sup
plies of stores and munitions of war
last, even if the Americans should
meet with some success in the bom
bardment of ports.
The Spanish generals have absolute
confidence in their ability to defeat the
insurgents, directly the latter cease
their guerrilla warfare and come Into
the open upon the plains or near the
cities. They seem equally persuaded
that their troops, seasoned with several
years of campaigning in Cuba, will also
face the Americans very creditably.
Military men like the West Indian
representatives look grave and preoc
cupied when the question of communi
cation between the colonies and Spain
and t^he duration- of the blockade is
mentioned, and they do not deny that
they think the Spanish navy must be
the principal factor in sustaining the
power of Spanish resistance to America
and th^ insurgents.
The Spanish naval reserve at Ma
nila, the singularly slow movements of
the gquadron lately at Cape Verde and
the even slower mobilization of the re
serve navy have caused much disap
pointment and exasperation all over
Spain. These feelinps are echoed by
newspapers of every shade in very se
vere articles against the Government
and the present and former Ministers
of Spain.
Seven prominent Deputies have laid
on the table of the House a motion of
censure and inquiry, showing that
Spain spent Â£9,000.000 in extraordinary
naval estimttes voted in 1888, and has
spent about Â£8,000,000 since without ad
equate results on the squadron under
Admiral Cervera, lately at Cape Verde
Islands. _^__^__________

There Are Now Two Vacancies on
the Naval War Board, and. Cap-
tain Mahan Will Get One.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Theodore
Roosevelt to-day formally tendered his
resignation aa Assistant Secretary of
the Navy. This action was taken prior
to the swearing in of Mr. Roosevelt as
lieutenant-colonel of the First Regi
ment of Mounted Rifleman by Adju
tant-General Corbin. While Lieuten
ant-Colonel Roosevelt naturally regrets
his departure from the Navy Depart
ment he feels that his place is with his
regiment, and he is champing at the
bit at his enforced stay in Washing
ton.
The resignation of Mr. Roosevelt will
result in his immediate detachment
from the service as a member of the
Naval War Board. Another member
of the board, who will be detached
within the next few weeks, is Captain
A. S. Barker, formerly commanding the
Oregon, who has been assigned to com
mand the cruiser New York, which will
be placed in commission on May 21,
and probably assigned to the flying
squadron.
The relief of Mr. Roosevelt and Cap
tain Barker will leave only two officers
comprising the board, Rear-Admiral
Montgomery Sicard, president, and
Captain A. S. Crowninshield, chief of
the Bureau of Navigation. Both of
these officers enjoy the full confidence
and trust of the President and Secre
tary of the Navy. Captain A. T. Ma
han, retired, is expected to arrive in
Washington within the next ten days
and his assignment to the board will
result in making that body an organi
zation upon which the country can
safely rely in the future, as in the past.

IS LOST
TO SPAIN
She Will Not Try to Re=
take the Philippine
Islands. i
War Department Ready to Send
Troops as Soon as Dewey
Says He Wants Them.
NEW YORK, May 6.â The Herald's Washington correspondent says:
None of the members of the War Board believes for an instant that
Spain will attempt to retake the Philippines. Notwithstanding the
Suez canal is open to her fleets, it was pointed out by an expert witn
whom I talked that the withdrawal of sufficient force from the Atlantic
to attempt the recapture of the Philippines would place not only Cuba
and Porto Hico, but the Canaries and Spain itself at the mercy of the
American warships on this coast. It was more probable, he said, that
the United States would send ships from the Pacific through the Suez
canal to the Mediterranean to attack Spain's Mediterranean coast than
that the Madrid Government would order its ships to retake the Philip
pines; but either contingency he thought decidedly remote.
NEW YORK, May 6.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Preparations are in active progress for
augmenting Commodore Dewey's fleet
at Manila, while the authorities are
anxiously awaiting for tidings which will
determine how much, if any, assistance
he will need. Hopeful of good news,
the official mind will not be at ease un
til Commodore Dewey has been heard
from. Upon the recommendation of the
Xaval War Board, Secretary Long has
informed the War Department that the
cruiser Charleston, which has been
placed in commission at Mare Island,
will be the man-of-war to convoy the
troopship to Manila.
Secretary Algcr will therefore deter
mine the date of the departure of the
cruder with expedition from Mare
Island. As the Herald stated this morn
ing, it is proposed by the War Depart
ment to place at least a regiment of in
fantry on board the City of Peking,
which is expected to sail from San Fran
cisco for Manila about May i.v The
City of Peking, besides carrvine a ma
chine shop for the repair of the con
quered vessels of the Spanish men-of
will take a large amount of ammu
nition, as follows: Fifty rounds for
each eight-inch gun. fiity rounds for
each six-inch gun, 100 rounds for each
five-inch gun. 300 rounds for each one
and six pounder.
In accordance with instructions
from Washington. General Merriam,
who will command the military expedi
tion, has been collecting a formidable
force at San Francisco, and it is ex
pected that it will be ready to sail by
the time the City of Peking and other
steamers to be acquired are in condition
to depart. Of course much of what is
being done is preliminary in character
and will not take actual effect until
Commodore Dewey is heard from.
While maintaining a hopeful view of the
situation and believing Commodore
Dewey is its master, the authorities pri
vately admit that they will not get down
from the anxious bench until he has
wired them details of his action upon
the Spanish fleet and upon Manila.
Before Commodore Dewey sailed
from Hongkong on Sunday a week ago
Secretary Long cabled him asking him
to make arrangements for keeping in
continuous communication with the de
partment, and it is believed he arranged
with Consul Wildman at Hongkong to
OFFICERS MUST
HAVE MERIT
McKinley Will Not Select
Men Who Have No
Experience.
Provision of the Sinews of War
a Serious Subject Considered
by the Cabinet.
There Is a FÂ«ar That the Senate Will
Leave Out the Bond Provision
in the Revenue Bill.
Special Plspatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 6.
Besides the war situation in its gen
eral aspect, there was some discussion
at the Cabinet meeting to-day of the
relative merits of the persons seeking
brigadier-generalships and other com
missions in the army. The President
expressed himself very pronouncedly
as opposed to the appointment to such
responsible positions of those who have
had no military experience.
One feature of the session was a dis
cussion of the attitude of the Senate in
providing the "sinews of war" for de
fraying the expenditures of the war. The
President has received positive . infor
mation that the Senate Committee on
Finance, which is still struggling with
the war revenue bill, will report that
measure with the bond feature elimin
ated. This fact is causing the adminis
tration much uneasiness and embar
rassment, and the statement is made
that the possibility of adverse action of
the full body of the Senate is a source
of much anxiety. The President laid
transmit to Washington all dispatches
which he might forward by cable or
dispatch boat. According to the ad
vices of the State Department Consul
Wildman has had nothing authoritative
from the American officer, and for the
purpose of definitely settling the situa
tion and relieving anxiety it is understood
he has sent a vessel to Manila to learn
the exact condition of affairs, and upon
its return will at once communicate with
the department.
In the meantime the authorities here
have to content themselves with watt
ing for the return of the steamer sent
by the Consul or for the receipt of a dis
patch which Commodore Dewey may
send at any moment to Honekong for
transmission to Washington. It is be
lieved in naval circles that the steamer
sent by the Consul carried to Manila the
cable instructions sent to Commodore
Dewey a few days ago by Secretary
Long, which were exclusively an
nounced in the Herald at the time.
It is estimated by the officials ' that
some information should have reached
them from Manila by this time. The
attack and destruction of the Spanish
fleet occurred on Sunday morning, and
the bombardment of Manila occurred
twenty-four hours later, in accordance
with the terms of Commodore Dewey's
ultimatum. It was presumed that this
bombardment was a matter of a com
paratively short time, and was over by
Monday night or Tuesday morning. The
only fortifications then left to prevent
the progress of a dispatch boat were
those at the mouth of the harbor. As
Commodore Dewey found no difficulty
in passing these fortifications on Sun
day without discovery, it is not believed
in naval circles that a dispatch boat
would have any difficulty in getting out.
It is sixty hours' run from Manila to
Hongkong, so that information ouerht
to have been received at the British
port this morning.
"I don't see any cause for anxiety."
said a prominent official to me this af
ternoon. "Commodore Dewey. mark
my words, wants to do the thing in the
style that he has selected. He does not
want to be bothered by instructions
from Washington, because Washington
does not know his position and he
might be embarrassed by what is sent
him from here. He's all right, and
when he thinks proper he will communi
cate with Secretary Long."
before the Cabinet the information he
had as to what is to be looked for from
the Senate, and while not expressing
absolute confidence in favorable action
by the Senate with the bond feature
reincorporated, expressed the hope
that there would be a satisfactory ma
jority for the bond provision.
Should it not become a part of the
law many urgent appropriations for
the war will have to be held back. The
money to be secured from bond sales,
it is reported, is needed imperatively
for the execution of the plans mapped
out, and adverse action by the Senate
would be likely to interfere unless the
money is otherwise provided, and by
as speedy method as the issuance of
bonds.
The administration is anxious to im
press this fact upon Congress in order
that ample revenues may be at hand
for a vigorous prosecution of the war.
There was considerable gratification
evident at the session at the general
war outlook.
There was a strong belief that the
Spanish fleet, instead of sailing across
the seas to intercept the Oregon or to
come over into the waters^near home to
begin operations, would be found event
ually to be now progressing for some
point closer its own possessions on the
other side of the pond. While there is
great reliance on the part of all the
members of the administration on the
subject, there is excellent authority
for the statement that the instructions
of Admiral Sampson give him great
latitude.

BUENOS AYRES, May 6.â The Her

guay, sends word that the Spanish
torpedo-gunboat Temerario has arrived
there. When she reached port the
Spanish residents of the city gave her
an enthusiastic reception. Word comes
from the Herald's correspondent in Rio

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAL.L, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
SEVENTH REGIMENT
OFF TO THE WAR
Twenty Thousand People at Los An
geles Give the Southern Calif ornians
a Rousing Send=OÂ¥f.
LOS ANGELES, May 6.â The farewell of citizens of Los Angeles to the officers and men of the Seventh
Regiment, which was extended this morning, was a kaleidoscope of color, a mixture of laughter, joy, sorrow, de
votion to duty, lofty patriotism and self-abnegation. The scene was one never to be forgotten by those who beheld
it. People by thousands turned out to bid the citizen soldiers of the Sevent'i godspeed on their journey. Their
pathway from the armory to the depot was strewn with flowers. The sidewalk and the streets up to the very line of
march were banked with enthusiastic and admiring masses. Old and young, men and women who had witnessed
departures of a similar nature in '6i, were on hand. Buildings were decorated. All business, public and private, was
suspended for half a day.
And the soldiers! They showed the true warrior spirit. There were some to whom the musket was still an
unknown quantity, whose head stooped from the severe perpendicular which comes only as a result of the trying
"setting up" process that they will get at the Presidio or on board the troop ship.
The city men swung along with alert step and slight, nervous figures; the country companies from Red
lands, Pomona and elsewhere were of men of heavier build, and kept their step in a more phlegmatic manner, but the
faces of all, whether smiling or set, showed sternness and capacity for daring and doing that proved to the most
casual observer that these were worthy scions of the heroes of Bunker Hill, Chapultepec and Shiloh.
There were boys and men in the ranks, going into the unknown, away from all that their hearts clung to, aban
doning their life careers, braving the greatest terror and horror the world has ever known â for there have never
in the past been battles like the ones to come, in dreadfulness and destruction â all for the love of the colors that floated
above them and for what those colors stand for.
From daylight until the hour of departure the armory was astir with hasty preparations for the long march.
By 9 o'clock the streets on both sides of it were closely crowded. The iron gates at the foot of the stairway were
guarded by a couple of soldier boys, and the sidewalk was kept clear by a good-natured detail. The men began to
arrive by 8 o'clock, and poured in for an hour from all directions. Nearly every one carried a bouquet presented not
long before, as could be seen in the solemn soldier face.
Of tourse there were red eyes and white handkerchiefs; mothers, wives and sweethearts gazed through their
tears from all sides at the retreating forms as the boys went up the stairs for their last preparations. As they came
down and before they fell in line for the first real march in their lives there was many a pathetic parting, and, to
look at the older women, many a heart-break, for the mothers remembered another leave-taking thirty-seven years
ago.
At 10:15 o'clock the procession began to move. First came a platoon of police, thirty officers. The Catalina
band had the right of the line. Grand Marshal R. H. Herron was on foot. His aids were Messrs. Max Meyberg.
John C. Cline and R. W. Pridham. The latter had as assistants F. I. Herron. Robert T. See and E. V. Sutton. The
City Councilmen and county officials followed the grand marshal. The Merchants' and Manufacturers' Association
headed by the officers and board of directors turned out 300 strong and made a grand showing with its uniform, tri
colored badges and flags.
All the Los Angeles members of the Native Sons were out in force, while Pasadena, Redlands and Riverside
sent delegations. The Native Sons carried the national banner at the head of their line, with color guards.
Then came members of the Chamber of Commerce, headed by the officers of the organization, who carried the
colors, and were followed by representatives of the Board of Trade. About 2^o men represented these two organiza
tions, marching four abreast. A brass band preceded the Jonathan Club, each club member carrying a flag.
The first volunteers of Southern California, with 150 men in line, followed the club men. The State Normal
School delegation. 100 strong, came next, followed by the local Fire Department. A brass band headed 500 High
School pupils. The Knights Templar drill corps, thirty strong, followed, with 200 Knights of Maccabees, 100 mem
bers of the Americus Club of Pasadena and about 1000 veterans #of the Civil War.
Then came the Seventh Regiment, with Brigadier General Last at the head of the column, accompanied by his
staff.
At the depot a crowd of 20,000 people gathered. Amid great cheering and a tremendous display of enthusiasm
the train pulled out, and the Seventh Regiment had gone to the war.
BAKERSFIELD, May 6. â Private Prine of Company C fell from the train two miles from Saugus and suf

6pedal Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 6.
Senator White said to The Call cor
respondent to-night that there was no
chance for the Hawaiian annexation
resolution to pass the Senate. "It is
merely a game of the Hawaiian sugar
planters to bull their stock, which re
cently slumped," said he. Senator
White added that the Senate would be
ready to adjourn by June 1, and there
would be no time to properly discuss
Hawaiian annexation.
The administration has massed an
other day of anxious waiting for news
from Manila. While the President and
his advisers profess a cheerful philos
ophy in discussing 1 the various theories
to account for Commodore Dewey's
silence, they are unable to conceal the
apprehension they feel lest all Is not
well with the gallant commander and
his brave sailors. The executive offi
cers of the department who are familiar
with the cable service in all parts of
the world are surprised that at Hong
kong there is no definite news of Dew
ey's fleet, for had the slowest vessel of
his squadron left Manila Wednesday
night, more than three days after the
victory over the Spanish fleet, its dis
patches would have been placed on the
wires several hours ago. Certain offi
cials who take a more cheerful view of
the situation declare that Dewey's pro
gramme has not been understood at
the department; that he is engaged in
reducing the fortifications of the Phil
ippines in detail, and that until he has
finished his work he will not only send
no word to the department but will
take no steps in looking to the restora
tion of cable communication, which
would mean the opening up of a chan
nel through which he might receive or
ders from Washington that would
prove most unwelcome in view of the
status of affairs in the islands. Vete
ran naval officers declare Dewey should
have a free hand until his great task is
completed, and are disposed to con
gratulate him on the opportunity to
work untrammeled by the directions of
superior officers.
It is confidently believed that Ad
miral Sampson's fleet will take Porto
Rico within the next forty-eight hours;
indeed, it would not be surprising to
learn at any hour that San Juan had
surrendered and that blue jackets were
policing the old Spanish towns. The
orders Sampson has received as to the
assault upon Porto Rico leave much to
his discretion, especially witL reference
to the important question as to the
whereabouts of the Spanish fleet.
Havana will not v - bombarded until
the fleet has been located, and if found
in Cuban waters not until it has been
disposed of. but the situation with ref
erence to Porto Rico is different. Its
capture presents no strategic difficul
ties nor peril to the attacking fleet, and
at the same time it is highly important
that it should be taken by our forces
to prevent the Spanish squadron from
using it as a military base. Hence
Sampson may even now be demanding
the surrender of San Juan, which lies
at the mercy of the shotted guns of his
formidable fleet.

Admiral Sampson Awaits
the Report of Cruiser
Scouts.
If the Spanish Warships Are
Bound for Porto Rico They
Will Be Intercepted.
NEW YORK, May 6.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Rear-Admiral Sampson is
now fully prepared to meet the
Spanish fleet. Though no information
has come from him, officials of the
Navy Department are confident he has
reached the sea where, with the vessels
under his command, he will await the
reports from the auxiliary cruiser
scouts, which will inform him of the lo
cation and direction of the Spanish
vessels.
One of his scouts, the St. Paul, has
been held back, and will not go to sea
until to-morrow morning. She is to be
more closely attached to the fighting
squadron than her three sister ships,
which have preceded her to sea. She
carries a much heavier armament than
some of the other scouts, and, under
command of Captain Sigsbee, she will
doubtless take a hand in the expected
battle, where her high speed would
make her particularly effective in man
euvering and cutting out and destroy
ing any of the torpedo-boat destroyers
of the enemy which might become sep
arated from the armored ships.
It is still the general belief at the
Navy Department that the Spanish
fleet is bound for Porto Rico, though
some officers are inclined to the belief
that under cover of darkness on the
first niglit out it may have turned
northward to the Canary Islands or to
Cadiz, to combine with the Cadiz fleet,
or that it may have gone southward to
the neighborhood of Cape St. Rogue to
lie in wait for the Oregon, Marietta and
Nictheroy. As time passes and no ves

tar or Lisbon reports having sighted
the Spanish vessels, the theory that I
they have gone to the northward is
weakened. Advocates of the theory {

The Cape Henry Signal Station report
ed her passing into Hampton Roads at
half-past 3 o'clock r.iis afternoon, and

to the northeast of Cape St. Rogue and

Captain Clark was informed by cable
of all that was known here as to the

which he should come aprth, and, while

would have arrived at Las Palmas long

that the fleet may have gone to Cadiz,

ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL.
DISPATCH BOAT SOMERS N. SMITH
via Key West, May 6. â Almost under
the nose of Morro Castle's guns, eluding
the sight of Spaniards with her search
lights constantly beating the sea, the
torpedo boat Ericsson, Lieutenant Ush
er commanding, stole quietly last
Wednesday night. The officers and
crew were on the gui vive, because for
several days they had been hoping to
lure to a chase the Spanish gunboat of
boasted prowess and twenty-two knots
speed that inhabits Havana harbor.
It has been risky business, but the
only spirit prevalent was the lucky
chance of sinking the gunboat before
her batteries could destroy their craft.
Visions of prize money spurred the
crew, and the danger of the bold at
tempts was not thought of. On special
occasions previously the Ericsson had
ventured into dangerous proximity to
Morro's guns, hoping the gunboat
would sight her and start in pursuit,
confident of an easy victory. Wednes
day night extra hazardous chances
were taken. Quietly the Ericsson
moved toward the harbor. The Span
ish searchlights cut wide arcs, then
swept paths from far out close into the
castle. Ail around the Ericsson its
rays rested, but nearer and nearer went
the Ericsson, absolutely unobserved.
So close did the torpedo-boat ap
proach the castle that its guns could
be seen gleaming, and the officers and

IN THE RINKS
Scion of the Noted House
Joins the Army as
a Private.
Enlists at Tacoma With a Com
pany That Will Go to the
Philippines.
Visitors to the Camp Find the Young
Man Engaged in Washing
Dishes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, May s.â The branch of the
Vanderbilt family living in Tacoma has
shown its patriotism. William Howard
Vanderbilt,' a cousin of Cornelius and
William K. Vanderbilt, has enlisted as
a private in Company C, and in a few
days will be mustered into the ser
vice of the United States. W r ith other
Washington soldiers he expects to be
sent to San Francisco and thence to
the Philippine Islands.
Howard Vanderbilt is 21 years old
and six feet tall, and has a perfect
physique. His grandfather was Jacob
Vanderbilt of New York. His father
is Jacob Vanderbilt, second cashier of
the Metropolitan Savings Bank here,
owned by George Vanderbilt of New
York. Young Vanderbilt has been am
bitious to see military life for several
years, but would not join the army nor
seek entrance at the lowest point while
he thought there was no active service
in sight. When the twelve companies,
comprising the Washington regiment,
marched through Tacoma last Sunday
his military enthusiasm revived and he
determined to enlist. After much per
suasion his father consented.
On Wednesday young Vanderbilt left
his luxurious home and started for
Camp Rodgers, accompanied by friends.
Company C of Tacoma was found
to have one vacancy. He quickly en
listed, and to-day visitors to the camp
found this scion of the house of Van
derbilt appareled in an ill-fitting uni
form and washing dishes. It had fallen
to his lot to-day to join the company
me9s squad.
For several years the National Guard
of Washington has held no annual en*
campment, for financial reasons. The
regiment contains many recruits of a
year's service or less, and is conse
quently somewhat "green" as to tac
tics and discipline. It is customary
when the Governor appears at camp to
"call out the guard" as a mark of cour
tesy, which order is repeated from sen
tinel to sentinel until it reaches head
quarters, or the officer of the day, when
the guard turns out and presents arms.
When Governor Rodgers appeared at
the camp on Wednesday the order to
"turn out guard for the Governor" was
repeated by the sentinels and the guard
speedily turned out. The Governor,
however, wished no ceremonial and di
rected the first sentinel to "never mind
the guard." This direction was mis
understood, with the result that the
guard of forty-eight men stood lined
up and presenting arms for twenty
minutes, while Governor Rodgers was
strolling about at the further end of
the camp.
This is one of the many ludicrous in
cidents at Camp Rodgers that have
caused much merriment to those fa
miliar with military' rules. Adjutant-
General Ballaine of the National Guard
is unknown to the men, and in conse
quence spends a half hour dally getting
inside of the lines.
Gradually Colonel Wholley and Lieu
tenant-Colonel Fife are bringing order
out of the chaos that has reigned so
far.
The Star speaks of School Board thieves
and tells some strong truths. â¢
! crew fairly ceased drawing long
breaths. All felt something was sure
to happen this time and something did.
The youthful Japanese cook on the
Ericsson was as anxious as any one
for prize money and a set-to with
Spain's crack boat. He scurried around
on tip-toe, trying hard to repress his
excitement and willing to share in the
honors and glory.
With the best of intentions he stum
bled and in one of those unaccounta
ble ways which happen at inopportune
times, became tangle*! in the rope con
nected with the Ericsson's steam whis
tle. Then beneath Morro's guns there
was emitted a screeching that was
echoed through the Cuban hills and
made the night hideous. Efforts to ex
tricate the cook failed for more than a
minute, during which time the screech
ing increased in volume.
The excitement on land was in plain
view and the searchlight began to
work frantically. Luck or misfortune, j
whichever it might be, seemed on the |
verge of realization. The men on the j
torpedo-boat now stopped breathing,'
entirely, after the screeching had
ceased, fearful even that it might at
tract the aim of the enemy's gun.
Rut not a Spanish eye seemed to see
the trespasser and the gunboat did
not come steaming out of its hiding
place. After a few minutes the excite
ment subsided, and the Ericsson stole
stealthily away from its dangerous lo
cation and back to its station, the offi
cers, crew and the Japanese cook
heaving sighs of relief, and yet all de
cidedly disgusted.

ROME, May 6.â There were renewed
j bread riots at Pavia yesterday even
| ing. The rioters stretched chains across
the streets, in orQer to prevent cavalry
| charges. Several soldiers and civilians
I were injured. A riotous mob surround
ed a detachment of troops at Sesyo
| Fiorintino and the soldiers fired a vol
| ley, killing three of their assailants and
j wounding four others.
There were further disorders at Pra
to, ten miles northwest of Florence, to
day.
The extension of the bread riots to
Central and Northern Italy is regarded
as an extremely serions feature of the
case, because the people in that section
are more enlightened and better edu
cated and there will be great difficulty
in suppressing the agitation.
Some of the worst rioting has oc
curred at Pavia, Among the killed is a
stude.nt, a son of Signor Missi, vice
president of the Chamber of Deputies.
The news of this has caused trouble
at Milan, Signor Missi being very pop
ular there.
A conflict occurred between the
troops and rioters and one was killed
on each side and many injured. At
Pralo and Florence there has been
very serious trouble. The latter city
has been occupied by the troops. It is
believed that the censorship stops the
worst news.
On Thursday a savage scene was wit
j nessed at Murgie-Minervino in Cala
: bria. The rioters laid siege to a mill,
| whereupon the miller lmng money into
I the crowd and begged that his life be
spared. The mob shouted back, "It is
1 not your money, but your skin we
! want." The mill was then stormed
! and the miller and his wife were bru
1 tally killed.
A physician who appeared at a neigh-
I boring window to protest against the
! brutality also fell a victim to the mob,
and his wife, who was lying ill, died of
fright. Another townsman was stabbed
i and beaten with hatchets until he died.

LIVERPOOL, May 6.â Steamers arriv
ing here to-day from the Canaries re
port that the United States Consul at
Las Palmas left suddenly with the
plans of Las Palmas harbor. They say,
also, that there are 12,000 Spanish
fifteen tons, and none of the larger
vessels, of which there are but two,
are equal in speed and armament to
the smallest American cruisers. The
gunboats are literally only njosquito
gunboats, unable to venture out of
sight of land, as they carry but a small
supply of coal and are, for the most
part, slow. The only dangerous yes-
comparati\'ely insignificant weight of
shot and range they can only deliver
a third the number of shots which the
American 4 and 5 inch guns can dis
charge in the same given time. The
still smaller caliber guns are similar to
those of the same caliber In our
navy.
The surrender or destruction of this
mosquito fleet can only be the question
troops in Grand Canarla alone, under
General Sugara.
Every Spaniard and Canarlan had
been pressed into the service, and the
business of fruit packing was left to
the women. Fortifications were rap
idly being constructed and a new fort
on the hillside at Las Palmas, facing
the sea, will mount heavy guns. The
military authorities were taking pos
session of buildings of British subjects,
for which they refused to pay, or make
exchanges, and the Government was
selling at auction all sorts of monopo
lies, arms, paints and the like, in a
desperate attempt to raise revenue.

INTO SEVEN
ARMY CORPS
How the Volunteers and
Regulars Will Be
Divided.
Brooke, Merritt, Breckinridge,
Otis, ' Wilson, Shafter and
Coppinger to Command.
Difficult Task of Assigning Troops to
Brigades, Divisions and Corps Not
Yet Completed.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, May- 6.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: It has
been decided to divide the regular and
volunteer armies of the United States
into seven corps, numbering from one
to seven inclusive. As soon as the
mustering in of the volunteer army is
completed the War Department will
designate the corps and send them un
der commanders to six points of mob
ilization, the most northern of which
will be Hempstead Plains, Lond Isl
and. Most of the troops will be sent
South, as Surgeon-General Sternberg
has advised that all northern soldiers
be allowed to get acclimatized to the
Southern climate of the United States
before they are sent into the intense
heat which will be experienced while
fighting in Cuba.
The difficult ta.sk of assigning troops
to brigades, divisions and corps has not
yet been completed, but a general out
line of a statement has been made by
Adjutant-General Corbin and his as
sistant, Brigadier-General Schwan. It
is the purpose of the department to
mobilize about 30,000 troops in the near
vicinity of Washington, in order that
they may be in a position to be im
mediately sent to the South. Major-
General Breckinridge, who has seen
several years of active service, will, in
all probability, command the troops
situated at the capital.
Although it is not possible to defi
nitely state who the other corps com
manders will be, I have been told on
good authority that these generals will
be selected by the department: Major-
Generals Brooke, Merritt, Breckinridge,
Otis, Wilson, Shafter and probably Cop
pinger. As will be seen all of these
officers are in the regular service, ex
cept General Wilson, who was appoint
ed from civil life.
General Joseph Wheeler will, with
out doubt, be given command of the
cavalry doing service in Cuba. Gen
eral Fitzhugh Lee will certainly see
actual service against the Spaniards
In Cuba and will, in an probability,
command the immunes that will re
lieve the regular army during the rainy
season.
It is a significant fact that Algernon
Sartoris, grandson of General U. 8.
Grant, will receive a commission as
lieutenant-colonel and will serve on the
staff of Major-General Lee, nephew of
General Robert E. Lee, the old Con
federate leader. Frederick Alger, son
of the Secretary of War, will rceive a
commission as captain in the volun
teer army and will serve on Major-
General Miles' staff. No action has as
yet been taken by other major-generals
in appointing their staff.
POWERS NOT
SEEKING TO
INTERVENE
Continental Countries Did
Not Try to Influence
Great Britain.
At the Present Time There Is
Nothing in the Situation
That Would Justify
Meddling.
T*" Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, May 6.
The London report that the continen
tal powers were seeking to have Eng
land join them in intervention is lack
ing in verification in official and dip
lomatic quarters here. The State De
partment has received no suggestion of
such intervention and does not believe
it is contemplated. The foreign rep
resentatives here, including those of
Great Britain, France, Germany and
Russia, meet these reports with spe
cific denials and declare that interven
tion is not being discussed in any way
at the present time. These officials
have been fully conversant with all
previous moves toward intervention
and they doubtless would be aware if
such a move was on foot at present.
The utterance of Emperor William
before the Reichstag to-day confirmed
what the German officials here have
maintained from the first, namely, that
Germany would observe strict neutral
ity, even though no decree of neutral
ity was issued. Russian officials take
the same view as to the purpose of
Russia to keep out of any intervention
which would be inimical to the United
States. The French authorities here
do not consider Intervention a live
question at present, and since France

"â¢ Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 6.
In the Senate to-day a bill granting
the Santa Fe and Grand Canyon Rail
road Company right of way through
the Grand Canyon forest reservation
in Northern Arizona was passed.
In requesting a conference upon a
pension bill Gallinger of New Hamp
shire, chairman of the Pension Com
mittee, said that the House had tac
itly adopted a rule that in cases
where the widow of a general officer
had no pensionable status in the Pen
sion Department, no pension exceed
ing $30 a month would be granted, but
in such cases where a pension was al
ready being received, the pension might
be increased to $50 a month. Gallin
ger made the statement he said, in
order that the Senate might realize the
futility of pressing for pensions of $75
or $100 a month.
The consideration of the postofflce
appropriation bill resumed, the pending
question being the amendment offered
yesterday by Pettigrew of South Da
kota, providing for a reduction of 20
per cent in the amount paid to rail
roads for the transportation of mails.
Quay said that the adoption of Pet
tigrew's amendment would result in re
ducing the compensation of the rail
roads $6,000,000 without any evidence as
to the results or righteousness of the
action. He maintained that the in
vestigation authorized by the pending
bill ought to be made before any ac
tion was taken.
Pettigrew maintained in the course of
an analysis of the mail and express
statistics that the Government paid
ten times as much for transportation
of the mails as the express companies
paid for the transportation of their
matter.
Faulkner of West Virginia presented
a strong argument against the Petti
grew amendment. He declared that it
would destroy many of the railroads in
his own State, fully one-third of those
in the Southern States and many
throughout the country.
Quay moved that when the Senate
adjourn to-day it be to meet on Mon
day next. The motion was agreed to.
Unanimous consent was then given
that the final vote on the bill should be
taken before adjournment on Monday.
Hawley of Connecticut, chairman of j
the Military Affairs Committee, pre- j
sented the House bill to increase the ;
number of surgeons in the United
States army by fifteen and in emer
gencies giving the Secretary of War
authority to appoint as many contract
surgeons as may be necessary, the sal
ary of each not to exceed $150 a month.
The bill was passed.
Cannon of Utah secured the adoption |
of a resolution directing the Committee
on Manufactures to investigate the :

Sewage.
SACRAMENTO, May 6. â Mayor Land
approves the course taken by The Call
In placing before the people the exact
condition in relation to the woeful lack
of sanitary precaution in this city.
Said Mayor Land to The Call corre
spondent this evening:
â¢'I have felt for a long time the ne
cessity of taking steps toward the pro
tection of our people against sickness
which is sure to follow a season as dry
as this. Street Commissioner Touhey
is in hearty accord with my sentiments
in this regard, and for the last two
weeks he has been engaged in cleaning
out the catch basins throughout the
city. There are 2200 of these basins,
and the accumulations in many of them
would indicate that years have elapsed
since they have been cleaned at all.
We have now cleaned about 2000 of
them, and in that number we have car
ried away 11*00 wagonloads of refuse,
and sewage deposits. We have a city
very difficult to drain, and before my
administration is over I hope to insti
tute many improvements in this re
spect.
"But what is the use of our taking
local precautions in sanitary matters
as long as one of the largest institu
tions in the State is permitted to de
file our waters, by using the stream
from which we obtain our drinking
water as a dumping place for the sew
age of 1000 or more men : I think we
should take immediate steps toward the
abatement of this perilous practice,
particularly during this season, when
the water will be very low."
Mayor Land will, in all probability,
send a message to the Board of Trus
ad B< '1 of Health next Mon
day night, calling their attention to the
of taking immediate steps in
the <!:rection indicated.
In F. Smith, for many years sec
: the State Board of Agricul
and widely known throughout the
. has just recovered from a very
serious attack of typhoid fever. Last
evening he sent the following- commun
n to the Evening Bee:
Tn the Editor of the Beeâ Sir: One who has
telt the sting of pain knows not what
pain is. One that has not felt the terrible
â¢f typhoid or malarial fever knows noth
inp of its"exhaustivp and dangerous character.
The old maxim, "an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure," la applicable at this
time to our present drinking water system. I
,â¢â  r.f those forty-year drinkers of Sacra
rr.r-nto water: have drunk It in all shapes, and
felt that I was Impregnable to its gercn
carrylng danger, but the conditions of the pres
iflon are so materially different from all
is ones that with all the physical health
strength one could wish, I picked up the
of that long lingering malady, malarial
which Is nothing more than an overdose
ii that brings one. It seems, to the verge
ith, but holds him back to Buffer agonies
c cannot find short of the place Bob In
gersoll Pays exlpteth not.
Notwithstanding the reports, there Is no use
g that at the present there are more
dangerous oases of fevers existing In this city
:t any time during its history. I dare
lat almost any citizen could locate from
three to five cases within his acquaintanceship,
v. hie! irtterlon that the Btatement
â¢ .i prominent physician made a few weeks
â¢ there being over 200 cases of fever In
ilty was con
ar '-onditlons of the season, owing
unusual lack of rainfall, render It plain
that action of some kind is necessary toward
provement of our water supply before
Ing else is done in the way of city im
ents. If those in charge of the affairs
city v.:ll but think of the Jeopardy in
which the thousands of innocent children at
fnfllnfr the public schools are placed in the
drinking "f this now most impure wat^r, they
would be inhuman not to devise some method
of improvement, and that should be done at
r.n^e. otherwise during the present summer
made graves will multiply, and the un
dertaking business will be a most prolific ven
l ire.
I know that the people are prone to charge
one that attempts public communications with
bein^ interested In some way with the subject
in hand. All the interest I have is the health
of the community in which I have livod all my
life.
Thnse of you who, like myself, have drunk
the river water for forty years, Old not have,
until within a few years past, the contami
nating sewage that is now dumped in the rivers
to contend with. I wonder what the most
learned (?) authority that said running wattr
purities itself in a short distance would now
say if he were to go up the American River
and view the solid mass of sewage rolling lazily
in large lots as it Is dumped in the now slug
gish Rio de los Aemericanos?
I predict that any change in our system, if
only to extend the water pipe above the Ameri
can River a half mile or so, would be a credit
to our city, and do more good in the end than
the suppression of facts as they now stare us
In the face, and are well known, notwithstand

State. Let us tor-* If necessary, our children
and their children, that we may prolong the
life of the present generation, and give to us
health and happiness in this beautiful city of
homes. EDWIN F. SMITH.
At the present time there are many
cases of fever in the city of Sacramen
to, and they are increasing daily. Most
of these are typhoid. Dr. Henderson,
secretary of the State Board of Health,
in speaking generally of the disease,
said:
"In places where the supply of water
is from rivers or wells all drinking
water should be boiled, and it is a wise
precaution during an epidemic to have
the milk Ecalded, as the prevalence of
typhoid in London in 1873 was clearly
traced to the or.-ntaminationn of the
milk by the excreta of a man who had
dipd of typhoid on a milk furm. The
period of incubation usually extends
over two weeks, being preceded by loss
of appetite, languor, headache, dizzi
ness and blf-eding from the nose in
many instances. From the tenth to the
twelfth day the rash usually appears.
It is very slipht, and unless care is
taken may be entirely overlooked.
These spots arc rose-colored, about the
size of a. pin's head, disappearing on
pressure, but reappearing as soon as'
the pressure is removed. In favorable
cases the fourth week finds a change
for the better. The temperature falls,
th<Â» symptoms are alleviated, the sleep
becomes more natural and the appetite
grows stronger.
"After the thirtieth day, in the ma
jority of cases, no more spots appear,
the fever is at an end, and the patient
passes slowly into a stage of convales
cence. In typhoid fever relapses are
common, and dangerous complications,
especially of the lungs, may ensue. If
the ulceration of the intestines pro
ceeds so far that they are perforated,
death ensues almost invariably, and in
all cases the mortality is high. The
main chance of recovery depends upon
careful and scientific nursing, under
the direction of a skilled physician."
Dr. Henderson believes with other*
that a great portion of the Blckness In
Sacramento is due to the consumption
of river water, and thinks that some
thing should be done to remedy the
present dangerous practice of using the
streams as a receptacle for offal and
sewage.
"I am glad," said he, "to know that
The Call has taken up the question in
the vigorous manner it has. How in
the world can one expect municipali
ties to observe the sanitary laws of
man and nature when we permit the
State to set such bad examples? I be
lieve that not only should the sewage
system of Folsom be changed, but steps
should be taken to suppress the same
practice in the city of Marysville, and,
for that matter, the city of Sacramen
to, in asking others to refrain from
sending down these impure deposits,
should herself desist. The Call has
taken up a question which is of vital
importance to every locality in the
State, and I sincerely hope that before
the agitation ceases the people through
out the great valleys now drained by
the large rivers may awaken to the
peril which is threatening every com
munity, as the State increases in popu
lation."
There are some who find fault with
the expose by The Call of this all-ab
sorbing question, but they are few and
far between. While a Silurian here and
there will tell of having drunk the
water for thirty or forty years, and
others intimate that such information
going abroad will have a tendency to
keep people away from the city, the
majority of Sacramento's citizens are
praising the efforts of The Call, and
declare that the health of the people
who are here is of greater concern than
the prospective increase of population.
"Our first duty," said Dr. Hender
son, "is to those already here, and until
we have properly defended them
against the ravages of disease we can
not expect others to come."
LEARNED MEN IN
DRAMATIC ROLES
Members of the Stanford Fac-

Footlights.
"All in a Fog; or. Who Is Who?"
Presented Successfully in En

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO. May 6.â The Faculty
Dramatic Club to-night made its sec
ond appearance on the stage in Encina
gymnasium and repeated the success
it scored at the Holloween Kirmess
last fall. It produced Williams' catch
ing farce, "All in a Fog; or, Who Is
Who?" and showed that the ability of
the membe. does not all run in the line
of giving lectures and conducting reci
tations, but that they have dramatic
talent that will at least captivate a
Stanford audience.

CALIFORNIA INJURED
BY PETTY DISPUTES.
Delegation in Congress Unable to
Agree Upon Any Man for Any
Position.
WASHINGTON, May 6.-The President
told Senator "White that on the passage of
the sundry civil bill he would select seven
of the best men he could find to act as
American directors or commissioners at
the Paris Exposition, and they would se
lect a director-general from among their
own members.
The Californians naturally expect one of
the seven directors to come from the Pa-,
ciflc Coast, but as the California delega
tion will probably (as usual) be unable to
agree on any one candidate, the honor
may fall to Oregon or Washington.
It is currently reported here in the Cali
fornia colony that Mr. de Young may not
be a candidate for director, but will try
again for the Senate.
Nothing is known definitely about the
brigadiership. but it is the general opinion
among the Californians that no Callfor
nian will get the prize, as there are so
many candidates and the California Con
gressional delegation is divided.

SCURVY FINDS
MANY VICTIMS
The Dawson Hospital Is
Filled With Afflicted
Miners.
Pneumonia Also Epidemic in
the Metropolis of the
Klondike.
Disappearance of the Snow Reveals
a Shocking Condition of
the Streets.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TAOOMA, May 6. â Two Dawson let
ters, dated March 29 and 30, have been
received from John Williams and C. C.
Pagett. Williams writes that scurvy
is epidemic at Dawson, the hospital
and several cabins being full of pa
tients. Pneumonia is also prevalent.
There have been a number of deaths
from each disease. Many more deaths
from scurvy are considered certain be
fore the miners are able to escape
down the river in June.
The rapid spread of scurvy is not
thought strange at Dawson, consider
ing the utter lack of variety of food that
has prevailed in many cabins for
months, together with the poor cooking,
which results from the hurry and in-
conveniences of a miner's life. Some
miners who were short of provisions
last fall, but determined to remain,
had, when Williams wrote, been living
for several weeks on bacon, beans and
flour, fried in fat. The little cemetery
laid out a year ago Is being enlarged
to meet increased demands upon its
space.
Fine, clear prevailed dur
ing March, causing the snow to disap
pear rapidly, and revealing the unsan
itary condition of Dawson, which is
expected to result in typhoid fever and
other diseases when the hot sun of
May and June beats down upon the
filthy streets and by-ways of the Klon
dike metropolis. If the warm weather
continues, Pagett writes, the ground
would be bare by April 15 or 20. Pagett
says further:
The food scare is pretty well over, but
prices are high. Flour is $50 a sack, and
all other provisions range from $1 to $1 2o
a pound, excepting butter and lard, both
being scarce. Lard is $5 a pound and
butter $3. ..
Spring is here, and soon comes the
miners' harvest. The days are lengthen
ing very rapidly, giving nearly twelve
hours' daylight. Dawson has already
begun to- awaken. New buildings by the
score are going up as rapidly as men and
material will permit. The main drawback
in this line is the scarcity of nails. As
high as $4 or $5 a pound is paid for eight
and ten penny nails, and very few can be
had at those figures. Two lots on i irst
avenue, near the old opera-house, sold
last week for $40,000. A woman owning a
twenty-five-foot lot almost back or these
on Second avenue sold for $4500. It cost
her $300 about a year ago.
Harper & Ladue, owners of Dawson
townsite, have advanced prices on all of
their property from $lm.Â» to $1000 a lot, ac
cording to location. Harper & Ladue's
mill is being moved from its old location,
and will soon be In running order. Lum
ber is $150 a thousand feet. Flooring and
dressed material are $250.
There are two other mills, one at the
mouth of Bonanza and the other near the
mouth of Bear Creek. They moved up the
river last fall, in order to be near the
timber. They have been running all
winter, using uog teams to \op; with. They ,
have not been able to satisfy the demand
made on them for lumber for Bluiceboxea
and building purposes, but now that the !
days are getting longer they will be en- :
abled to double their output. The lumber
is hauled principally with dog teams, al
though there are about fifteen horses
here, and, owing to the mild winter, they
have done great work and made fortunes
for their owners.
Dogs are very scarce and high priced,
$250 being paid for a fair-sized dog from
the outside. Interior dogs (malmoots and
huskies.) are worth from $3uO to $500 each.
From 300 to 400 miners have recently left
for American territory, rhiefly Forty-Mile
and Seventy-Mile creeks. More will go
because of the stringent Canadian mining
rules.
TO WED A CHINESE
MERCHANTS DAUGHThR.
Dr. Thompson of the Mohican Be
trothed to Mrs. Hutchinson. of
Honolulu.
NEW YORK, May 6.â Dr. Joseph C.
Thompson, assistant Burgeon on the
United States warship Mohican, has an
nounced in a letter to a friend in Brook
lyn his engagement to Mrs. A. Hutchin
pon of Hawaii. The bride-elect is the
daughter of Ah Fong, a rich Chinese
merchant of Honolulu. The Mohican is
now lying at Honolulu, having arrived
there on March 19. It was only a matter
of a few days when Dr. Thompson met
Mrs. Hutchinson and immediately fell in
love with her.
Dr. Thompson Is 23 years old. while his
fiance is said to be some years his senior.
She was married ten years ago, and Is
said to have been divorced from her hus
band. Her sister, Henrietta, was married
In December, 1893, to Commander William
Henry Whiting of the United States ves
sel Alliance. This wedding occasioned
widespread comment at the time. Com
mander Whiting was r>o years old and his
bride 17. Another sister, Ella, became the
wife of William Henshall, a lawyer of
California.
LOSES HIS LIFE IN
A GRASS VALLEY MINE.
Albert Rowe Shockingly Mangled by
the Premature Explosion of a
Blast.
GRASS VALLEY, May 6.-A distressing
accident occurred this afternoon at the
Massachusetts Hill mine by which Albert
Rowe, 24 years of age. lost his life, and
Alfred Pascoe was seriously injured.
The men were at work at the 1400-foot
level. They had finished drilling holes
â and filled them with powder. Rowe was
spitting a fuse, and about to make his
escape when the blast went off. Rock was
blown in every direction. Rowe was
struck by several pieces and mangled
frightfully. His body was taken to the
home of his parents by fellow workmen.
His mother is distracted over her loss.

CONFLAGRATION
IN THE HEART
OF RANDSBURG
Flames Raze Many Business Blocks
and Dwellings in the Min
ing Town.
RANDSBURG, May 6.â Fire started at 2 o'clock this afternoon In
the residence of George Clutte, on Butte avenue, and soon that part of
town was all in flames. The Wells-Fargo Express office, the "Western
Union Telegraph office and the Occident Hotel were destroyed, as was
alpo the Orpheus Theater, built last year. The exact loss is not
known, hut it is safe to say that the damage will amount to more
than $100,000.
Every business house except Hammond's and a few small stores
on Rand and Upper Butte avenue were destroyed. Dynamite saved
the upper end of Butte avenue. The citizens worked like Trojans. No
suffering will ensue, as the homeless are well taken care of by the
more fortunate friends.
A heavy wind storm aided the fire. Guards will watch the smol
dering ruins to prevent firebrands starting new conflagrations. The
Call agency has secured new quarters. The Western Union volunteer
operator, Smith, has connected his instruments with the wire on the
hillside, and is lying on the ground as he sends this.
PLEASED WITH
THEIR VISIT
Marin Teachers Praise
the Public Schools of
Oakland.
One Feature the Kindly Rela
tion Between Teacher
and Pupil.
Close of the San Rafael Institute
After a Very Successful
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Cell.
SAN RAFAEL, May 6.â The Oakland
schools are all right. "hat is the
unanimous verdict of the various com
mittees of the Teachers' Institute that
visited the Oakland schools yesterday.
All this morning's session was given
up to the reports of the chairman of
these visiting committees.
A crystallization of these reports
shows that the teachers were all much
impressed with what they saw in the
Athens of the West. The disciplinary
systems in vogue there are deemed
both original and practical, one of the
pleasantest features being the kindly
relation between teacher and pupii.
An item receiving special commenda
tion was the numberless forcible ways
in which patriotic ideas were incul
cated.
Considerable amusement was fur
nished the institute by some wag who
gained access to the courtroom yester
day in the teachers' absence and filled
the blackboards with parts mutuel
wagers on the Jeffri.s-Sharkey boxing
match. Such expressions as "All bets
paid according to the decision of the
referee," "Usurpers of seats will be
promptly ejected," etc., abounded.
This finally attracted the eagle eye of
Professor Boke, who facetiously in
quired of Superintendent Furlong if the
institute was to be coached in the ele
ments of fistic bouts. And then, amid
general laughter, the blackboards had
their faces "turned toward the wall."
Professor J. B. Davidson delivered an
interesting lecture on the course of
reading teachers should take. He be
lieved that too much of this is done
along other than psychological lines. A
short discussion by the institute fol
lowed.
Considerable attention was paid to
the formation of a history club for col
lecting State and county material.
Discussion was finally concluded by se
lecting Professor Boke to appoint a
committee to gather information and
organize a club.
The intention was to end this session
of the institute in the morning, but an
accumulation of business was found to
necessitate a meeting in the afternoon.
It was begun with a vocal bolo from
"II Trovatore," by Professor Charles
N Watson who was encored and sang
â¢Love Is a Queer Thing," from the
opera "Said Pasha."
After settling all unfinished business
the institute adjourned with the sing
ing of "Auld Lang Syne." The teach
ers say they have had a pleasant and
beneficial meeting. Most of them de
parted homeward during the afternoon.
PRINTERS ON AN OUTING.
"Nine-Hour Camp" Established Not
Far From Camp Taylor.
CAMP TAYLOR, May 6.â The members
of San Francisco Typographical Union
No 21 may be out on a strike, but they
are having a "gay old time" just the
same. About twenty-flve of them are
camped on Lagunltas Creek, near here,
waiting for the word to go to work so con
fidently expected. The boys have tents,
bedding, cooking utensils and a commls
sarv that would delight the old Roman
gourmands. A detail of fishermen go out
every day to catch enough fish to satisfy
appetites all around.
Owing to the fact that one of the num
ber owns a pair of old artillery trousers
the camp is conducted under military
regulations. Over it floats a small Ameri
can flag At the entrance is a flaring
sign reading "Nine Hour Camp."
The camr roster includes Colonel Louis
Hamer, Lieutenant Colonel Hon. i-on
Henry. Major Hon. J. P. Jones, Cffptain
Bob Cochran, First Lieutenant William
Hognn Second Lieutenant Harry Barber,
Sergeant Pete Petersen, Commissary
(Captain Stew) Ole Olesen, Quartermaster

quota of officers nor menâ Colonel Harry
Tilley, Lieutenant Colonel W. Turner,
Major' Charles Rogers. Captain B. Lewis.
Scouts to do forage duty are numerous.
RUNAWAY ACCIDENT.
SAN QUENTIN, May 6.â State Parole
Clerk W. F. Reynolds sustained a
sprained ankle and severe contusions,
and may have been injured internally, by
lumping from a wagon drawn by a run
away team to-day. Reynolds was in the
mail wagon with a trusty driving, w..en
a train arrived. The horses became
frightened, and, a bit slipping out of ore's
mouth, they tore off toward the prison.
The injured man was treated for his in
juries at the prison hospital. The mail
wagon was almost demolished.

read a paper entitled "Decoration of
Home Grounds," and Professor E. J.
Wickson read a paper on "The Best Va

A. D. Bishop of Orange read a paper
on "Migration of Weeds," and Hiram
Hamilton followed with a paper on
"Fruit Pest Quarantine Laws." ,
The election of officers, which was

MIDDLE-AGED MAN WEDS
A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD.
Indignation Aroused at Visalia Over
a Marriage Performed by a Jus
tice of the Peace.
VIS ALT A. May 6.â Much Indignation
was aroused among the residents of this
place this morning when it was learned
that the authorities had permitted the
marriage of a little child of 10 years to a
six-foo*er 38 years old to be solemnized
here last night.
The name of the tiny bride is Alice
Adams, and the groom is James M.
Hitchcock. Both are from Kern County.
One strange feature of the transaction is
that the little girl's fattier, Arthur Ad
ams was along and sanctioned the union.
The license was not issued until legal ad
vice had been obtainegd. A local Justice
of the Peace performed the ceremony.
The father's excuse for allowing the
marriage was that his divorced wife was
endeavoring to keep the little girl in a
disreputable house in Bakersfield, and he
took this plan to get Alice away from her
mother. Hitchcock and his baby bride
and father-in-law left for their homes
this morning. There is strong talk of
prosecuting Hitchcock for marrying the
child.
TRAINS COLLIDE ON
THE MOUNTAIN SIDE.
Twelve Cars Roll Down a Canyon
and Several Trainmen Are
Injured.
REDDTNG. May 6.â A collision occurred
on the Iron Mountain railroad, operated
between the famous Shasta County cop
per producer and the big smelting plant
at Keswick, this afternoon. At the
point where the accident occurred the
road is built on heavy grades and directly
on the mountain side, but fortunately the
engines were pushing their trains, thus
avoiding danger to life and lessening the
loss of property. Twelve cars rolled down
the mountain side and lay in a heap in
the canyon. David Wells, a brakeman,
had his leg badly crushed, and Al Gump
ton and Fred Brooks, trainmen, suffered
injuries. The collision resulted because
orders were given the trains from con
flicting sources.

FOR THE KLONDIKE.
\A R. S. W. WALL, whose splendid service in
/ \ Alaska and the Klondike country during the
* past winter enabled The Call to furnish its
readers with an unrivaled series of reports of events
and conditions in that region, started on his return
to Dawson last night, and will carry with him a
special edition of The Call containing, for the benefit
of Alaskan readers, a full report oi all the war news
up to date.
The achievements of Mr. Wall in the arduous work
of newsgathering along the Yukon are among the
most notable triumphs of recent journalism. When
the boat on which he had embarked for Dawson was
stopped by reason of the low water in the river last
summer he at once started to make his way by canoe.
Succeeding in this, he carried to the people of Daw
son and the Klondike generally the first information
of the stopping of the supply boats at points along the
lower river. This news gave warning of possible
famine during the winter and enabled hundreds to
leave Dawson and make their way to other places
where ample supplies existed, thus relieving to a
large extent the strain at Dawson and saving the gold
districts from the calamity which threatened them.
During the winter, when no further news of im
portance wasto be gathered in Dawson itself, Mr. Wall
made his way down the river and obtained accurate
information of the movements and location of hun
dreds of men and women who had gone into the
country during the rush and of whose whereabouts
their friends knew nothing. These reports, published
in The Call, carried relief to many anxious house
holds. In that and in other midwinter journeys Mr.
Wall gathered information which enabled him to
give to the public through The Call the fullest and
most accurate reports of the various mining camps
and diggings which have ever been published.
By continuing this successful correspondent in the
Alaskan field The Call assures its readers the best
and most reliable news service in that region. It
confers a benefit upon the people of Alaska also by
sending north with him the Klondike supplement re
lating to the war. The work of preparing the supple
ment has been carefully done. It gives the record of
events leading to the outbreak of hostilities and all
important incidents that have occurred since. To
Americans who in those remote districts have been
deprived of news this edition of The Call will be of
the greatest value, as it will enable them to have a
clear understanding of the whole situation which they
could not obtain from the ordinary editions of news
papers which may reach them.
The act of the Cuban who expectorated in the face
of Colonel de Cortijo cannot be regarded as an evi
dence of refinement, yet it served the colonel rightly.
De Cortijo had once subjected the Cuban to a similar
indignity. If the eye for an eye business is applicable
to the present situation it certainly embraces the in
stance cited, unless one of the parties at interest is
addicted to the unpleasant habit of chewing tobacco.
Senor Dv Bosc has been spitting Spanish fire in
the direction pf the United States. Nevertheless, not
a feather of the eagle has been scorched. Dv Bosc
might be tolerably successful as a pyrotechnic dis
play, but as a war measure he is no mor effective
than the others devised by Spain. Canada ought to
put him out
The man who in a mining town of Washington
tore down the stars and stripes and put up the Span
ish flag instead was merely ordered out of town. An
American trying the reverse of this trick in Spain
wouldn't have any such luck.
Sir Charles Dilke declares that no power will in
terfere with the course of the United States in the
Philippines. Evidently he does not regard Spain as
& power, and the impression that his estimate is cor
rect is steadily growing.
It is pleasing to note the sympathy of the Examiner
for its own readers. With a sincerity so emphatic
as to bring tears to the eyes it condoles with people
who have to read fakes or nothing.
One value attaching to the rumor that the Queen
Regent is to leave Spain arises from the fact that it
can always be denied next day, thus becoming two
rumors of dignity and importance.
It is to be regretted that so large a proportion of
the Police Commission is under the weather. Their
absence from duty permits Chief Lees to be almost too
numerous.
Murderer Ebank9 must be a man of some dignity.
He has just been sentenced for the fourth time to be
hanged, and yet he did not ejaculate "Chestnuts."
MORGAN'S CANOL BILL.
NO little gratification is felt at the announce
ment from Washington that Senator Morgan
has reintroduced his Nicaragua canal bill,
slightly amended, and will at the earliest opportunity
urge action upon it. The importance of the project
was never more apparent than now, and Congress
can well afford to give it consideration before ad
journment.
According to reports from Washington the new
measure is framed upon the same principles as for
mer bills, but there are several new provisions, the
most notable of which is one authorizing the Presi
dent to invest in the canal bonds the money realized
by the Government from the sales of the Central and
Union Pacific railroads.
Past discussions of the subject have shown that
among supporters of the project wide differences of
opinion exist on minor matters of detail in the various
plans proposed for accomplishing the work. These
differences should now be harmonized on some plan
which will provide for the construction of the canal
under Government supervision and on terms that will
give the Government control over it when com
pleted. The very suggestion that the nation invest
in the bonds of the canal the money derived from the
sales of the subsidized Pacific roads is itself a warning
to the Government not to repeat the blunder made
in the grants for the construction of those roads.
One experiment of that kind is enough.
The fact that the nation has now to make heavy ex
penditures for war is no reason why it should not
undertake the cost of this great work. It is in the
truest sense of the word a war measure as well as a
commercial enterprise. The canal would immensely
strengthen the effective force of our navies by
enabling the Pacific and Atlantic fleets to co-operate
with one another in case of need. At present they
are separated by such a long distance of sea voyaging
that they are powerless to combine, and thus for
naval warfare our compact republic is almost as
badly off as if half of it were on one side of the
globe and half on the other.
Senator Morgan has long been an earnest and
vigorous supporter of the construction of the canal,
and, while he is now old and worn with ill health, he
is still a leader of power and influence in the Senate.
There is reason to believe, therefore, that if properly
supported by the country at large he will be able to
have his bill taken up for consideration without long
delay. Boards of trade, chambers of commerce and
other bodies representing the commercial and in
dustrial interests of the people should unite in urging
action upon it. As a war measure the Nicaragua
canal is of the highest importance, and now that war
is upon us is the time to close up the debate on the
issue and begin the work.
AN ARTIFICIAL NECESSITY.
IS an attempt made to create an artificial necessity
for the annexation of Hawaii?
That country lies 2000 miles from our shores
and is 5000 miles from Manila. The plea is made that
a naval expedition from San Francisco 10 Manila
must coal at Honolulu, and that taking coal in Hawaii
will break the neutrality of that country and make
her an ally of the United States; therefore we should
annex.
The folly of the argument is exposed when it is
remembered that we have been offered coal by the
Straits Settlements and other British colonies in
Asiatic waters, and no one has pretended that the
neutrality of Great Britain is broken thereby and
that she becomes our ally.
No government has yet declared coal contraband
of war in the Pacific. It may be sold to either Spain
or the United States without breach of neutrality.
England has declared it contraband in the Atlantic
only. She owns all the coal in stock from Aden to
Hongkong, and will not declare it contraband in
that hemisphere because she has it for sale, and can
withhold it from Russia or Germany without a con
traband declaration, and can sell it to the United
States if she choose.
This leaves coal free in the Pacific and we can get
it where it is to be found, unless we declare it con
traband ourselves, which is not likely.
So the emergency argument for renewal of the
rank scheme of annexation has no foundation. Its
reappearance is suggestive of the effect upon this
country of the war in which we are engaged. Spain
is dropping to pieces as the result of following the
path of "manifest destiny" for four centuries. It is a
far cry from cause to effect, but the life of nations
exceeds that of many "generations of men.
Spain wanted islands, colonies, "gems of the An
tilles" and "the garden of the Eastern seas." She
reached out for spice islands, gold mines :.nd every
thing profitable and pretty. She invented necessi
ties, discovered policies and created pretexts for
planting her standards in every zone. Here it was
to save the souls of natives, and there it was to get
rid of their bodies, and everywhere it was a policy
of extension of power and prestige.
Considered as # a national policy every argument
now made for taking Hawaii against the protest of
98 per cent of its people, and for holding the Philip
pines, if we have them, and for keeping Cuba, which
will be attempted in defiance of our solemn counter
declaration, may be found in Spanish history from
1492 until now.
The patriotic support of the war and the flag where
ever it floats should not be used to make such â¢Â». grave
and far-reaching change in our national policy.
We should not invite an unanswerable criticism
which will put us on the defensive before the world
by professing high motives in making Cuba inde
pendent while we destroy the independence of Hawaii
against the protest of her people.
Weyler still insists that the loss of the Maine was
due to lack of discipline in the American navy. He
can hardly ascribe the loss of several Spanish ships to
the same cause. Nevertheless, Weyler may be less a
fool than would appear. He may yet be asked some
pointed personal questions about the Maine and then
denied the opportunity to lie.
Information that the success of the American navy
has caused little pleasure to Continental politicians
will not occasion any deep distress. So far as can
be learned from official sources the navy was not or
ganized for the purpose of giving pleasure to dip
lomatic gentlemen living abroad.
An "American diplomatist" living in Paris is said
to have remarked that this country would b,e glad
of the intervention of Europe. Before accepting his
view as final it is well to recall that the "American
diplomatist" is simply first cousin to "prominent
citizen.'"
Whcp the Governor of the Philippines shall issue
another proclamation perhaps he will omit from it
any mention of the circumstances that the Yankees
can't fight and that they lack discipline.
THE SAN FKAKCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
THE Continental League is reported as opposing
the adoption of the new charter on the ground
that it confers upon the Mayor extraordinary
and dangerous political powers. In defending the
instrument from the assertions of the league a morn-
ing contemporary declares that this ground is a
bugaboo. "The new charter," says the journal in
question, "does not vest any extreme power in the
Mayor; in fact, it makes a very slight advance in
that direction. The most important increase in his
appointing power results from the appointment of the
boards and commissions now appointed by the Gov
ernor."
It is such statements as this which inflict immense
damage upon the prospects of the proposed charter.
There is scarcely a grain of truth in the allegation
that the instrument merely transfers appointments
from the Governor to the Mayor. Any intelligent
person may ascertain the exact amount of truth by
examining the charter itself.
The proposed Board of Public Works, which is to
be appointed and removed by the Mayor at pleasure,
is to supplant the Superintendent of Streets, City En
gineer and Street Committee of the Supervisors, all
of whom are now elected by the people. Here, then,
are extraordinary powers transferred from the people
to the Mayor. The Board of Education is now
elected by the people. The charter confers its ap
pointment upon the Mayor and authorizes him to re
move its members at pleasure. The Police Commis
sion is now appointed by the Governor in conse
quence of a failure of the law, but since 1878 that
official has named but two Commissioners. As
things stand the Police Commission is practically ap
pointed for life. At all events there is no power of
removal.
The Fire Commission is now appointed by the
Governor and Supervisors jointly, the latter appoint
ing two, the former two, and one, who was chosen by
the Judge of a court abolished by the constitution of
1879, holding office for life. There is no power of re
moval except for cause. The Board of Health is ap
pointed by the Governor for a fixed term, and the
Election Commission, which now consists of the
Mayor, Auditor, Tax Collector, City Attorney and
Surveyor, is elected by the people. The Park Com-
missioners are appointed by the Governor, and un
der the present law there is no Civil Service Commis
sion. This is the extent to which the proposed char
ter has vested in the Mayor "the appointment of
boards and commissions now appointed by the Gov
ernor."
Nor is this all. Not only is the appointment of
these bodies placed in the hands of the Mayor, but
he may remove them at pleasure. He may also sus
pend elected officials. This makes the entire govern
ment subservient to him. We have no disposition to
quarrel with the Freeholders for presenting to us this
kind of a political monarch; perhaps they think he
will emancipate us from the thralldom of the bosses.
But we do object to smuggling him through the bal-
lot boxes by misrepresentation. If a powerful Mayor
is a good thing, why not make a clean breast of him
and defend the charter on the ground that he is a
reform innovation? The pleas of denial and avoid
ance which are being entered are calculated to make
the people think there is a job of some kind behind
the charter. For whom is this vast political power
being centralized? In the event of the adoption of
the charter who is going to exercise it?
THE INCOME TAX FOLLY.
GENERAL GRANT'S statement that in every
political crisis the Democratic leaders can be
always counted on to blunder is as true of the
party to-day under the leadership of Bryan and
Bailey as it was under that of Seymour and Hen
dricks. A striking illustration of the fatuous folly of
this blundering is shown in the course pursued by the
party in opposing the war revenue bill and seeking to
amend it by imposing an income tax as a substitute
for the proposed bond issue.
There is not the slightest chance of getting the
House or even the Senate to agree to an income
tax. There is not the slightest reason to believe the
people favor any such tax. It is fairly certain the
Supreme Court would set such a tax aside as un-
constitutional if it were enacted. What then, in the
name of reason, political sagacity and good horse
sense, do the Democratic leaders mean by pushing
such a proposition to the front and wasting time and
lung power in discussing it?
It is asserted, indeed, with some vehemence by
certain of the blundering Bourbons that the Supreme
Court declared the Wilson income tax to be uncon
stitutional, but would uphold such a tax at this junc
ture as a war measure. So far as can be seen, how
ever, there is not the slightest ground of law, reason
or evidence to serve as a basis for this assertion. It
seems to have been made solely for the purpose of
providing a seeming justification for the folly of ad
vocating the tax and was clearly designed for use in
Buncombe County rather than in Washington.
Here is a set of political leaders holding high office
and entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of
statesmen who, in the face of a war sure to entail
large expenditures, urge the adoption of a system of
taxation which has just been declared unconstitu
tional. Their only argument for such a course is
based upon the possibility that the court might re
verse itself. They would expose the income of the
nation in time of war to that chance. They would
turn away from sure sources of revenue for the pur
pose of imposing an unpopular, unjust and doubtful
tax simply to be consistent with their campaign cries
against wealth and the thrifty and enterprising men
whose incomes are somewhat larger than those of the
general mass.
Tactics of this kind are not only below the level of
statesmanship, but beneath that of ordinarily clear
sighted politicians. They are the outcome of folly
which in its oa^ure is best characterized by the fam
iliar term, "pure cussedness."
The distinguished officers of the National Guard
might as well understand that in this emergency no
body cares whether they get high-sounding jobs or
not. The little affair with Spain was not brought on
with a special view to letting be-braided officers shine
on parade.
Germany is inclined to the opinion that the United
States Government was all the while casting an en
vious eye on the Philippines, which shows the ten
dency of people to judge others by themselves.
If to display in large type the line, "News From
Dewey," and under it in much smaller letters,
"Anxiously Awaited," is not bunko business, the
gold brick game is honest enterprise.
It is all right, of course, to have parades in honor
of Commodore Dewey, but by waiting a short time
the parades would apply as well to Sampson and
Schley.
WHY THIS CHICANERY?
THE HEART OF A SOLDIER.
SPANISH DOCKYARDS.
IN 1884 the Bpanish Government con
ceived a very elaborate naval scheme
and the Cortes was asked in all ser
iousness to sanction It and vote $46
000,000 to cover a period of ten years. The
plan provided for twelve armorclads, two
armored cruisers, seven cruisers of thu
first class, nine second class, eleven third
class, thirty-two torpedo-boats and six
transports. The money was not voted
and the programme has been greaily
modified, with the result that Spain has
only one armorclad built md one Under
construction; the armored cruiser class
has been materially increased anil only
three out of sixteen of the larger cruis
ers have been built. Fully $46,001,0(10 has
been spent, however, upon new construe
tion and the four dockyards have bt;Â«:n
kept busy. The naval arsenals o* Spain
are at Cartagena, Ferrol, Carrara and
Cadiz, and there are also two private
establishments for ships and engine con
struction, one at Cadiz, the other at fail
bao. The latter yard is conducted by
the Palmer firm of Yarrow-on-Tyne, ond
the Spanish Government has made cer
tain concessions and given guaranteesâ
the latter fortified by hypothecating part
of the profits from the Almaden mines â
to keep the establishment going. As all
the material used for ship and engine
building has to be imported the lock
yards and private yards labor under great
disadvantages, and it has become neces
sary to go to foreign countries for ships.
While the Spanish mechanics are fairly
good, the management of the yards is
like the naval establishment in its en
tirety utterly Inefficient, the progress of

ENGLAND'S WAY.
The King of Abyssinia once seized a
certain Captain Campbell and put him in
a dungeon. Campbell was a British sub
ject. His immediate release was demand
ed and King Theodore refused. England
fitted out an army at once and, marching
it 900 miles over morass and mountain,
broke down the gates of the dungeon and
bore Captain Campbell home in safety. It
cost valuable lives and millions of money
to protect and save this one British sub
ject, but it is such deeds as this that help
to make a nation proud and prosperous.â

And a wonder in the face.
And a "God save papa and bring him back
In the goodness of thy grace!"
And there is the heart of a soldier-
Not on the field of fight.
But steeped in the dream of a saddened home
Where a window keeps its light \ / â¢â 
That a soldier's feet may keep the path
And his way may homeward lead.
When under the flag of the f reedomland '
He has wrought tho hero's deed.
Tea, there Is the heart of a soldier.
Where wife and baby, are,
Though his" eyes and his will may follow
The light of the battle star;
Though his hand may swing the saber.
And his bayonet charge the foe.
The soldier's heart Is away, away.
In the home where they miss him so!

It is only at the Nervion shipyard at
Bilbao, under English management, that
work is done expeditiously, and the three
fine armored cruisersâ lnfanta Maria
Teresa, Oquendo and Viscayaâ were built
in reasonable time and moderate cost, the
contract price being $2,855,000 for each. On
the other hand, those built at the dock
yards have taken from six to seven
years, and the Relna Mercedes, of 3520
tons, built at Cartagena, took twelve
years. The Princesse de Austria, begun
In October, 1889. at Carraca, was launched
seven years later, and during the last
year on the stocks progressed at the rate
of only about 2000 pounds per day.
Of the small cruiser class of 1130 tons,
the Isla de Cuba and Isla de Luzon were
built on the Clyde at a cost each of $223,
590. The Marquis de la Ensanada, built
at Carraca, cost $1,439,973, or more than
five times that of the Clyde built vessels
even after making an allowance of
25- per cent for exchange, a? Spanish
money outside of the country is subject
to that discount In ordinary times. Tho
Don Antonio de Ulloa and Don Juan de
Austria required four years at the dock
yards at Cadiz and Cartagena, although
only of 1130 tons, and the torpedo-gunboat
Filipias, of 750 tons, built by contract,
cost $504,200, or about double the expense
of building a similar vessel in this coun
try.
There are fnstances of long delays in
other navies in completing ships, and we
have had some notable cases in this coun
try. Such cases, however, proceeded from
causes quite different from the chronic
state of "donothingness" which exists in
the yards of the South American states,
France and Portugal, but is most pro
nounced In Spain.

TWO COMMITTEES NAMED
San Francisco and Alamada County
Stalwarts Perfect Plans for the
Gathering.
A meeting of representative Republi
cans of San Francisco and Alameda
counties was held in the rooms of the
Union League Club in the Palace Hotel
last evening for the purpose of perfect
ing arrangements for the first biennial
convention of the California League of
Republican Clubs, to be held in this
city May 31.
Colonel George B. Stone was ap
pointed chairman. After stating the
object of the meeting he called upon
those present to offer suggestions as to
the best plan to be pursued to insure
the success of the convention, as well
LABOR COUNCIL DENOUNCES OTIS,
Harrison G. Otis will not be appointed to any position of prominence
or trust if the working people of the State have anything to sny about It.
The differences between Colonel Otis and the Typographical Union are so
well known throughout the State as to need little comment, but the mem
bers of that organization are not willing to bury the hatchet. They have
Y^eon waiting for an opportunity to strike a blow, and it looks as though
the opportunity has at last arrived.
â¢ At the meeting of the Building Trades Council Thursday night strong
repnimimis were adopted and telegraphed to the President. Last night the
San Francisco Labor Council held its weekly meeting, and the representa
tives from the Typographical Union lost no time in bringing the matter be
fore the house. There was little time wasted in speech-making, but had the
man from Los Angeles been present and heard the outburst of stinging,
scornful words, the arraignment of his character and the quotation of his
own words against the working people and National Guard, it is probable
that his ears would have tingled. Referring to the warrior-editor, one of
the speakers declared he "contaminated with his presence."
The Labor Council had no elaborate set of resolutions provided, but its
action was pertinent and decisive. The secretary was instructed to at once
wire the President and California's representatives in Congress that the
appointment of Harrison G. Otis to the position of brigadier general or any
other position of honor or trust would be odious to organized labor, as
the man Is despised by all who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.
This action was taken without a dissenting voice, but one of the mem
bers of the council suggested that it would be a good plan to have "the
friend of rats and scabs" placed in some position where he would stand a
good chance of being killed at the first fire. The two organizations which
have condemned Otis jointly represent over 20,000 voters.
as anything that might be offered in
the way of plans for the successful con
duct of the campaign. Many responses
were made, and It was finally decided
to authorize the chairman to apnoint
a committee of seven to take charge of
and perfect all arrangements for the
convention. A reception committee, to
be composed of the presidents of all
the district clubs in San Francisco and
Alameda counties, will have charge of
the accommodation and reception of all
delegates to the convention. Both
committees will meet in the rooms of
the Union League Club next Wednes
day evening for the purpose of per
fecting organization and mapping out
the work that is before them. Follow
ing: is the official call for the conven
tion:
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 20, 1808.
By authority of the National Republi
can League Convention of 1897 and under
the direction of the California State
League, a convention of delegates from
all the Republican clubs of this State is
hereby called to meet in the city of San
Francisco on Tuesday, May 31, 1888, at 1
o'clock p. m. The convention will continue
Its session until the business for which it
is called is completed.
Each Republican club In California, in
cluding those of the American Republi
can College League, shall be entitled to
one delegate at large and one delegate
additional for every twenty-five members
upon its rolls; organizations of Republi
can veterans are especially invited to par
ticipate. No club shall be entitled to rep
resentation in the State League Conven
tion unless it has been organized and in
existence at least ten days prior to the
date of the convention. No person shall
be counted for representation in more
than one club. All delegates shall file
with the Secretary of the convention cer
tificates of election signed by the presi
dent and secretary of their clubs. These
â¢will be accepted as proper credentials at
San Francisco.
In addition, each club shall furnish Its
delegates with a certified list of Its mem
bers for the use of the committee on
credentials. The following are ex-offlcio
delegates, viz.: President, secretary and
treasurer of the State League; the presi
dent and secretary of each Congressional
District League, the vice-president for
California of the National League, the
members of the National League exec
utive committee for California and chair
man of American College League of Cali
fornia. _, ,
The business of the convention will In
clude reports from the officers of the
league, the election of State officers for
the ensuing year, the designation of time
and place for holding the next conven
tion, the adoption of a constitution and
a general discussion of plans for league
organization. The latter, will include the
prosecution of a vigorous campaign
through permanent headquarters, the ac
quirement and distribution of Republi
can literature, the organization of county
. leagues and local clubs and the arrange
ments for a thorough canvass of the
State by Republican speakers.
An evening mass-meeting, to .be ad
dressed by speakers of national repute,
will be one of the' events of the occasion.
The various railroads and steamship
lines will make reduced rates â¢ for round
trip tickets, and the citizens of San
Francisco cordially invite the patriotic
Republicans of the State, whether dele
gates or not, to attend this gathering.
We cannot over estimate the value of
this convention to our party. The victory
of 1896 does not guarantee permanency of
power. We shall vote this year for mem
bers of Congress, members of Legisla
ture, which will elect a United States
Senator, and for State and county offi
cers. It becomes the mission of our grand
old party to meet the emergency with the
highest patriotism, and our league should
be well equipped for the coming contest.
Let us therefore come together in San
Francisco in large' numbers. Let us
revive and enlarge our enthusiasm for the
party of Lincoln, Grant and Blame and In
bo doing so strengthen and build up our
league that in the coming conflict It will
be Invincible, unwavering and victorious.

Asked as to the Cost of

REFERS TO THE BIG FOUR.
The Railroad Commission Spends
Another Day in a Fruitless Search
for Facts and Figures.
"Uncle Collis" Huntingdon unloaded an
other batch of anecdotes and reminis
cences on the Railrond Commission yes
terday afternoon. He also took advantage
of the occasion to again call attention
to his own great worth, not only as father
protector of Californians, but also as the
benefactor of the entire human race.
To be sure, the Commissioners asked
some pertinent and unpleasant questions
concerning the operations of the Contract
and Finance Company, thus giving edi
dence of an unnatural desire to learn
something regarding the cost of construc
tion of the lines of the Southern Pacific
system, but these things only temporarily
disturbed the flow of soul with which the
I aged railroad magnate sought to enter
j tain those who were within the sound of
j his voice. He related with much partiou
j larity ttie incidents of a meeting of Bos
j ton bankers that occurred away back in
! the early sixties, when he and the other
members of the Big Four had nothing be
tween them and starvation s:i.ve a cash
loan from the Government of $60,000,000
and a land grant that might have con
j stituted a king's domain. The bankers,
i he said, wished to buy his bonds for rtO
i cents on the dollar, but he, fired with the
j spirit of his own great worth as a finan
cier, told them that he would "see them
further in hell than they were out" before
he would take loss than 75 cents on the
dollar. Thereupon the bankers immedi
.ately capitulated and the future magnate
was soon on his way back to his asso
ciates with a million and a half dollars
jingling merrily in his inside pocket.
Strange to say, Huntington could not
rememfcer how this money so bravely won
had been invested, but he remembered
perfectly the name of each and every one
of the twelve bankers who had weakened
at his furious onslaught. He even sought
I to relate a -few personal reminiscences of
i each of the gentlemen, but was prevented
! from doing so in time to save the official
I stenographer from a stroke of pen
i paralysis.
Chairman La Rue wanted to know what
! had been paid for the construction of
the Central Pacific Railroad. Huntint,'
ton was willing to tell all that he know
about the matter, though he warned the
I commission in advance that the transac
tion had occurred so many years agt>
I that his memory was liable to phiy h'm
I false.
"It Is my recollection," he said, "that
the contractors undertook to build the
road for all of the bonds and about $HO,
000,000 worth of stock. 1 ihinK there was
also some slight cash consiuÂ«rat">n also,
but Just what it was has slipped my
memory."
Commissioner Hinton wanted to know
if it was not a fact thai the men who
composed the Western Development Com
pany were also the incorporators of the
Contract and Finance Company. Hunt
ingdon admitted that this might be trufe,
! but contended that even If it were so the
fact could not be seized jpjn ;o furnish
evidence of any illegal acts on vhe part at
the organizers of either corporation.
"It is not unlawful for men to con
tract with themselves," he said, "provid
ed they be organized into two separate
and distinct corporations, as was the case
In this instance. It was the only way in
which the road could be built, a fact
that of itself would justify the means if
any Justification were needed. I am sat
isfied with the part I took in the matter,
and that goes."
This sentiment, though somewhat slawg
ily expressed, seemed to afford the old
gentleman no small amount of satisfac
tion, for he immediately settled back into
another reminiscent period that only end
ed when he had relieved himself of an
other chapter of self-praise.
"In those days," he said, "the people
thought we had accomplished a grent
undertaking, and that we were great
men. They would almost have erected
a. monument in commemoration of our
acts â not that I wanted any monument
or have ever wanted one for anything
that I have done. lam very well satis
fied with myself and my work."
During the course of the afternoon the
Commissioners propounded innumerable
questions intended to elicit some informa- j
tion regarding the cost of construction i
of the various linos of the Southern Pa
cific system, but were unable to gain any
definite iiuormation on the subject. Hunt
ington had either forgotten or had never I
known. The session proved as fruitless '
of results as others that have preceded
it. An adjournment was taken until next
Wednesday afternoon.
Demanded a Jury.
The two cases of battery against Louis
and Aaron Siminoff, cloak manufactur
ers, on complaint of their brother Morris

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAT 7, 1898.
LDNING HUNTS
FOR WHITTELL
A Hot Chase for the Man
ager of a Millionaire's
Estate.
He Is Either Hiding at Home
or Fishing â For His
Health.
Sleuths Lie In Ambush Around the
Residence of the Mil
lionaire.
There Is a merry chase for George
Whittell, president of the Luning Com
pany. Officers and detectives who have
been searching the city to serve papers
in the million-dollar suit of Oscar Lun
ing, who avers that Whittell has withheld
vast sums of money, have been disap
pointed in finding the defendant, whose
whereabouts is a mystery.
At the law office of Attorney Lang
horne and at the office of the Luning
Company it is announced that Whittell
has gone fishing, but prominent sports
and anglers are positive that he knows
nothing about fishing. In sporting circles
his angling proclivities were never heard
of by the men who keep books on these
affairs and who, as a rule, know where
and when prominent men do their fish
ing. After digesting the whole affair At
torney Parker of the New York bar, who
has much to do with the case, has con
cluded that Whittell is not rishing, but
that he is cutting bait somewhere in hid
ing-.
The search for tne millionaire manager
of milionaires' estates is growing very
warm. It is said that if Whittell is hiding
in the sacred precincts of his domicile out
on California street he will be obliged to
remain in hibernation for a long time,
because sleuths lie in ambush all around
the place. Should the defendant try to
make a hasty flight he will have a serious
time trying to run the blockade.
It is supposed that Whittell has been in
consultation with Mrs. Cunningham, one
of the heirs, who made a hasty trip from
Los Angeles after the publication of the
account of the suit in The Call. He has
also been in consultation with his brother
and his brother's wife, or so the detec
tives are said to believe.
The brigade that has gone forth armed
with process papers of the court in sex
tuple form has full faith that the de
fendant will be dragged or forced from
his hiding place within a few days.
Wherever the Luning manager turns,
if he leaves the fishing camp, or his home,
or wherever he is, he will find men with
due processes of the Superior Court. And
wherever he goes, unless the case is com
promised, he will see fighting Attorney
Parker of New York. At his office the
story is given out that Mr. Whittell will
have exhausted the fishing business and
cured his face of poison oak by Monday.
T'ntil then there will not be an open
rupture, unless the defendant should, so
officers say, attempt to leave his house
under the apprehension that the path is
clear.
ROW OVER A BILL.
Officer Gillen and Butcher O'Brien
Get Things Badly Mixed.
A general row which led to an arrest
and a visit to the City and County Hos
pital occurred yesterday afternoon at the
residence of Police Officer Pete Gillen, at
2760 Twenty-third street. From the sTate
ment made by James O'Brien, who keeps
a butcher shop at Twenty-fourth and
Hampshire streets. It appears he went
to the residence of the officer for the
purpose of collecting 1 a bill due him for
meat supplied. On making his business
known Gillen is accused of having used
rough language and to have knocked the
butcher down and at the same time
called to his wife to bring him his gun.
This, it is said, she did, and when she
arrived upon the scene she proceeded to
use the butt end of it on the head of
O'Brien, who by this time was lying on
the floor.
What followed is not recorded until
Gillen and his brother officer, L. Harri
son, appeared at the Seventeenth-street
station with O'Brien in charge. O'Brien
was booked on two chargesâ one for dis
turbing the peace and the other for bat
tery. He promptly put up $25 bail on each
charge and immediately went to the City
and County .Hospital, where he had five
stitches put in his scalp on the back por
tion of his head, besides having his nose,
which was turned to one side, made
straight. In addition to these injuries
both his eyes wore discolored. All of
these discomforts he claimed he received
at the hands of the officer and his wife,
who aided him in the chastisement of the
butcher who went to collect his bill.
From the friends of thf> injured man it
is claimed that this is not the end of the
trouble. O'Brien has a host of acquaint

er, who went to Ivotzebue on the bark ;
Alaska.
The bark Forest Queen, which was i
written up some time ago in The Call as
being long overdue at San Pedro from
Tacoma, has been posted as missing. The
general supposition is that she was
caught in a storm and the deck load of
piles proved too much for the old vessel,
and she went down with all hands.
The American ship Shenandoah had to
pay $1500 to lie towed from the coast of
Ireland to her destination. Her cargo
was valued at (155,009, and Captain Mur
phy was not taking any chances after
the scare about his vessel having been
captured by ;i Spanish cruiser.
Chief Wharfinger Root has found it im
possible to plant a danger signal on Mile
Rock, so practicing from Fort Point bat
tery will go on without it. A party head
ed by Assistant Chief Wharhnger Scott
went out on the tug Governor Irwin with
the intention of doing the job, but owing
to the gale that was blowing the tug
could not get near the rock. Yesterday
morning Chief Wharfinger Root went out
on the tug Governor Markham, but a
very heavy sea waa running and it was
found dangerous to launch the boat. The
fishermen and coasters will therefore have
to take their chances with the Fort Point
marksmen without the warning flag.
Captain Matson of the bark Annie John
son has another great grievance against
Quarantine Officer Rosenau. The bark
came in with a fair wind Thursday after
noon, but was compelled to come to
anchor off Meiggs wharf by the quaran
tine officer. In consequence Captain Mat
son lost the tide, and yesterday had to
up anchor and sail to the sugar refinery.

INCENDIARISM
IS SUSPECTED
The Fire at the Old Union
Hall Under Inves
tigation.
Fire Marshal Towe Is Actively
Searching for a
Motive.
Certain Circumstances Have Do
â 
veloped That Require to Be
Cleared Up.
Fire Marshal Towe has been making a
quiet investigation into the cause of the
fire Monday night which destroyed the
old Union Hall on Howard street, near
Third.
From the results so far he is strongly
of the opinion that the fire was not due
to an accident, but was the work of an
incendiary. He is now searching for a
motive, and although he sees difficulties
staring him in the face he does not lose
hope of surmounting them.
What first aroused suspicion was the
fact that the flames had gained consid
erable headway before the was
turned in. The flames were in the rear
portion of the building, where the stage
was situated, and were burning fiercely
when the firemen reached the scene. An-
other {suspicious circumstance was the
fact that the place, which had been used
as a skating rink and dance hall, had
been closed that night.
In the course of his investigations the
Fire Marshal ascertained that Nels A.
Lybeck, the lessee of the premises, had
a few days before the tire rented a vacant
store at GOT Fourth street for the purpose
of starting a mucilage factory. Further
than that he discovered that a number
of valuable articles had been removed
from Union Hall to the vacant store the
day previous to the fire and a large num
ber of skates had been sent to San Jose.
.Lybeck had the skates, furniture and
other effects in the building insured for
$2000, and he made a statement to the Fire
Marshal that their value was in the
neighborhood of $3500.
The Fire Marshal had an interview yes
terday with .Lybeck, and he stated that
on the night of the tire he and his wife,
who occupied three rooms in the build
ing, left thu place about half-past 7
o'clock. They returned about 10 o'clock
and remained about fifteen minutes. His
wife thought she smelled something
burning and he examined the stage and
rear portion, but could find no trace of
fire. They left the place about 10:15
o'clock, lockir.g it up, and nouoed the
flames later while they were on a How
ard street car. He said he was at a loss
to account for the lire unless it had arisen
from one of the matches which he used
in making his examination of the stage
when his wife thought she smelled fire.
"I am not nearly through with my in
vestigation yet," said the Fire Marshal
yesterday. "There are a number of sus
picious circumstances which I have not
had time to thoroughly investigate and
at present 1 am not in a position to' state
what they are. I ascertained that before
coming here Lybeck was in Paso Robles,
and his place was burned down there in
October last about 1 o'clock in the morn
ing and he does not know how the fire
originated. He has been running the
Union Hall as a skating rink and dance
hall since last December, having leased
the premises from the Market Street
Railway Company. I am strongly of
opinion that the fire was the work of an
incendiary, but I have nothing definite
as yet to point to the guilty person."
HOSPITAL CORPS
TO CHANGE ABOUT
All the City Surgeons Must Do
Duty at the Branch in
Golden Gate Park.
Why trie Board of Health Ordered
Dps. Hartley and Stafford to Shift
Their Stations.
Dr. Morse, chairman of the Hospital
Committee of the Board of Health, has
inaugurated a plan he has had under con
sideration for some time whereby me sur
geons in charge of the Harbor and Park
Receiving hospitals shall alternate at the
two stations. Whether the surgeons at
the central hospital will be shifted about
has not been decided yet, but it is likely
that they, too. will have to take their
turn at the branch stations.
The object of this change is to give all
the surgeons an equal chance, or at least
the two park surgeons a chance with the
harbor doctors. The corps of city sur
geons are paid a nominal salary â $75 a
monthâ depending in a measure on emer
gency patients who retain the services of
the city doctors after they are able to be
removed to their homos. A great many
patients are treated at the Harbor branch
and the doctors there secure many pay
patients, while cases at the park branch
are rare. As the surgeons at that station
are required to be on duty twelve hours
a day they have little time to devote to
private practice, and are practically lim
ited to their salary.
At present Drs. Stafford and Wymore
are stationed at the park, while Drs.
Hartley, Hill and Deas are at the har
bor. But Dr. Morse has ordered Hart
ley and Stafford to change stations as
the first move toward carrying out his
plan. Dr. Hartley's friends were surprised
when the order was Issued and could not
understand its meaning, but Dr. William
son of the Board of Health, in the ab
sence of Dr. Morse, explained the matter
last night. He said that Dr. Hartley was
one of the most competent surgeons in
the service, and the change in no way
reflected upon him. After three months'
service at the park he would be brought
back either to the harbor or central hos
pital,' and might not have to serve there
aeain for many months.
It is expected that either Dr. Hill or Dr.
Deas will be ordered to change with Dr.
Wymore in a few days. The surgeons at
the central hospital are making a strong
fleht against being disturbed, but it is ex
pected that thoy. too, will have to take
their turn at the park.
â¢'Patriotism of the Jews."
This afternoon at 5 o'clock, at the
Chevrah Thilim Congregation, 1036 Fol
som street. Rev. Dr. N. Mosessohn. editor

Biblical Hebrew, on "The Patriotism of

doctor will offer prayers for the protec
tion of the President of the United States

and will also hold memorial services for
those who were killed on the United

all will be welcome, regardless of creed.

THE BOYS HAVE DONNED THE BLUE AND ARE NOW IN CAMP
SPANIARDS PLOT TO
KILL AND DESTROY
Would Assassinate the Governor and Blow
Up Pinole's Powder Works.
Mysterious Strangers Skulking on the Hills Near the Explo
sive-Making Plant-â Precautions Taken.
It is now believed that three Span
iards have arrived here to carry out a
plot to assassinate Governor Budd and
blow up the powder works at Pinole,
Contra Costa County. Since the ac
count in yesterday's Call of the con
versation among three Spaniards on
tbe train from the East, in which one
remarked that Governor Budd could
be assassinated easily, much light has
dawned upon the people of Pinole rela
tive to recent events heretofore not
comprehended.
A week ago yesterday three Span
iards came from the East over the
Santa Fe route, and H. B. Stewart of
ficiated as brakeman from Sacramento
to this city. Stewart speaks the Span
ish language fluently, and a short dis
tance out from Sacramento, while trim
ming a lamp, his attention was at
tracted to the conversation among the
Spaniards. They were discussing the
war, and one remarked that Governor
Budd was making himself very active
in getting men to help fight Spain.
Stewart in telling a Call reporter of
the incident said:
"I naturally pricked up my ears to
bear what was coming next. One with
a dark mustache said that the Gov
ernor was an easy man to pick off, as
he does not travel with a companion
(meaning a body guard). The fellow
said he knew that Governor Budd goes
about the city and State at all times
and He would be an easy bird to catch.
The speaker seemed to be better ac-
Quainted with the people and the State
than the other two. While I was
standing on the arm of the seat fixing
my lamp the remark was made that
the Governor could be attended to at
any time, and the manner of their
speech gave me the idea that they had
something of far greater importance
to attend to first. When the train
passed the powder works at Pinole the
three craned their necks to get a glance
of the premises. This looked suspic
ious, and when the train stopped at the
station one of the men got out while
the two went on to the city. On the
following morning I was much sur
prised to find among the passengers one
of the Spaniards who had gone down
on the afternoon before and told one
of the men connected with the powder
works."
When the Spaniard alighted from the
train he started at once for town,
â¢which is half a mile distant. There he
disappeared, and has not been seen
since. While the town is thoroughly
American, still there are a number of
Portuguese and Mexicans in the sur
rounding country who speak the Span
ish language, and whose sympathies
are not well known. It Is with one of
these that the man no doubt found
shelter. The only clew as to his iden
tity is that one o-f his companions ad
dressed him by the name of Mendoto,
Mendoza or Mendejta. He was fairly
well dressed in a suit of light clothes
and was of slim build. As stated, his
companions continued on their way to
San Francisco. On the following
morning, greatly to the surprise of
Brakeman Stewart, one of the latter
boarded the train at the Oakland mole,
and his ticket showed it was good for
a trip to Pinole and return. The fellow
was short, stout and dressed in a dark
suit, and wore a light felt hat. He had
a heavy black mustache tinged with
gray. On the same train was J<>hn
Wilson, one of the clerks at the pow
der works. As the Spaniard left the
train the brakeman said to Wilson:
"That is one of those Spaniards who
â¢was talking last night on the train
about killing Governor Budd. He will
bear watching while he is here. While
he was on the train he kept consulting
a paper as though to get thoroughly
posted before getting off the cars. He
means mischief to the powder works,
ot I am greatly mistaken."
Wilson heeded the warning and
watched. The suspect walked about
for a few minutes, as a stranger will,
evidently "sizing up" the people. At
last, observing one with a swarthy com
plexion, a Portuguese employed on a
milk ranch, he addressed him in Span
ish. He wanted to know how the
trains came and departed, the distance
to adjoining towns, the names of the
latter, and last, but not least, where
the powder works were. The Portu
guese gave the desired information and
the Spaniard went up to the town
proper.
While the two were talking Mr. Wil
eon observed the gestures and asked
Mr. Garrity to watch him and tell the
officers to keep up the watch. This
was done in a sort of fashion and
enough was learned to have put most
any one on the alert, especially consid
ering the suspicious incidents attend
ant upon the explosion and destruction
of the powder works at Santa Cruz.
The dark-skinned stranger asked many
questions In many places, especially
â¢where he could converse In his native
tongue. His inquiries always led to
the powder works. In one place, where
he stopped, a barber shop, John Berm
insrham, assistant superintendent of the
works, was getting: shaved. As soon
as he could he followed the fellow and
finally saw the stranger start for the
works. He did not take the direct
road, near the railroad track, as most
men would, but went along the Marti
nez road to the south and by tho rear
of the big powder plant. Bermingham
drove rapidly along the railroad track
and reached the works long before the
swarthy pedestrian. Cutting across the
field he intercepted the stranger in the
rear of the company's property and de
manded of him his business. The Span
iard was greatly alarmed and replied
that he was "Just looking around.**
"Why did you come to Pinole?" asked
Bermingham.
"I wanted to see Manuel Furtado.
He is a friend of mine," replied the
Spaniard. Furtado is supposed to be
a Portuguese. He keeps a saloon in
Pinole, at which the stranger stopped
before starting for the powder works.
Some time ago Furtado was employed
in the works, yet no one thought to
ask of him his business with the mys
terious Spaniard. For the past two
a' three days he hasTbeen Â£n San Fran-.
Cisco, or at least there is whei
barkeeper says he has gone.
As the Spaniard's answers were not
satisfactory Mr. Bermingljam told him
to turn in his tracks and get back to
San Francisco as fast as his legs and
the Southern Pacific train would carry
him. The fellow glanced at Berming
ham's tall figure, then at the Deputy
Marshal's badge he wore and at the
handle of a revolver that showed above
the tjelt and started off at a lively gait
for the station. Upon recovering from
his fright he began to quiz Station
Agent E. M. Downer, winding up by
asking about the powder works. He
took the 9:30 a. m. train for San Fran
cisco.
Colonel W. R. Quinan, superinten
dent of the Pinole branch of the Cali
fornia Powder Works, did not at the
time attach much importance to the
foregoing incident, believing that the
Spaniard was prompted as much by
curiosity as evil motives. Now he
wishes that Mr. Bermingham had
taken him into custody and held him
until he gave a satisfactory account of
his actions. The colonel is also in
clined to believe that there was a plot
to assassinate Governor Budd and da
injury to the powder works â that is, if
Brakeman Stewart understood correct
ly the conversation among the three

A MYSTERIOUS SPANIARD.
The Man Who Was Discovered Prowling Around the
Big Powder Works at Pinole,
acquired by a long experience in the
army, he took every precaution tv
â¢guard against accidents or plots as
soon as he saw the war clouds gath
ering. He had eight of his most trust
worthy men appointed as Deputy Uni
ted States Marshals and several others
as deputies under the Sheriff and Con
stable. The latter patrol the high
points of the 350-acre tract in which
the powder works [ are located and a
large force of watchmen guard, the
works at night. Large reflector lamps
light all places where evil-disposed
persons would be likely to go. Al
though strict before, the colonel is more
so noxw,
No one Is permitted even to enter the
grounds without , a permit, and these
are difficult to obtain. Colonel Quinan
has recently started the erection of a
barb-wire, man-proof fence around the
entire tract. . The fence is eight feet
high and when : finished no one can
cross It. Should any one cut the wires
at night the fact will be known imme
diately in the office. The fence is four
and a half miles long, and at conspicu
ous points will be placed signs reading:
"California Powder Works, engaged
in United \ States Government work.
All strangers are warned,; not to enter
under penalty of arrest." '
Since the accounts of the plot to de
stroy the powder works and kill the
Governor have been made public clos
er watch , will be kept : on all persons
seen prowling around the premises, and
any one who jis found inside of - the
enclosure who has no business there
will be arrested and called to a very
strict account. For a time" it was sup
posed that the Government would j send
some of its troops to protect the place,
but none have arrived yet, and it -is not
likely that any will. The * Superinten

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
Marshals, and a number of names
have been sent to Barry Baldwin.
There is a rumor at Pinole that Mr.
Baldwin will not swear In any more,
and that he will deprive those he has
sworn in of their authority. Why, no
one knows. When hostilities began he
sent Detective Hickey to Pinole to
keep watch over all suspicious charac
ters, but the detective is said to have
spent most of his time in town, and he
was recently recalled. The branch of
the California Powder Works at Pinole
does not manufacture Government
powder entirely. It manufactures here
nitro-glycerine and the finishing is
done at the Santa Cruz works. Still,
if anything should happen to the
works, it would sadly cripple the en
tire plant. The superintendent does
not intend that anything shall happen.
THE FIRST IS
UNDER ORDERS.
Mustering in the Compa
nies of California's Vol=
unteer Army.
The First has entered the service of the
flag and the boys are preparing to break
! home ties and seek fame and l.onor
i wherever the President sees fit to send
them. Every company is full to the legal
limit, and all but two of the regular offl
| cers of the regiment have been selected
Ito lead the men, so it is a purely San
i Francisco organization, and whatever
glory it may bring home belongs right
here where the men are known and
where the gTeater number of them were
born.
The regiment enters the service under
the designation of the "First Infantry
Regiment, California Volunteers."
The work of muster began early in the
morning, and before the afternoon was
well over the regiment had been trans
ferred. It has twelve companies of eighty
four men each, a band of eighteen pieces
and a hospital corps of twenty-four, be
sides a full complement of field and staff
officers and a full non-commissioned staff.
It is a fine body of men, and Captain Car
rington, the musteiing officer, believes
that after the raw recruits become used
to the military discipline there will be
no finer regiment of volunteers in the ser
vice.
Company A was the first to be sworn
in. The men were assembled on the floor
of the big drill hall, and then Captain
Connolly, their commanding officer,
called the roll and each man was made
to leave his place in the ranks and take
a position in another line further toward
the end of the hall. Then the mustering
officer carefully verified the roll and
counted the men himself, and stepping
to the front and facinc the men he
ordered "uncover."
Every man removed his hat. and then
becoming impressed with the solemnity
of the occasion, first one and then another
of the spectators did the same until, as
the oath was given, every man in the- hall
stood with bared head, while the men In
the ranks, with right hands raised,
listened attentively to the words which
bound them.
There was a cheer as the ceremony
ended, and then as the boys marched out
their comrades crowded round them to
congratulate, or in the case of those who
were rejected by the surgeons, to express
a word of envy and regret.
Company B, the old City Guard, came
next upon the floor, and the same cere
mony was gone through with; then came
D and E and F, and then the others in
rapid succession until the regiment had
been transferred to the Government and
there was no turning back. But there
was no thought of turning back, and
there was many a man in the hall who
would have given all he had for a chance
to don an 111-fitting blue uniform and
join the boys who seemed 60 happy in
their new-found occupation.
The field and staff officers of the regi
ment were mustered last. Colonel Smith
at their head, and then the colonel went
up to headquarters to prepare his first
order â one assuming command.
In the list of officers of the volunteer
regiment there are several changes and
additions made by the Governor, most of
them being in the nature of a reward for
long and efficient service in the organiza
tion. The first of these was the promo
tion of Regimental Sergeant-Major Otto
Schwerdtfeger to be second lieutenant of
Company E. Lieutenant Schwerdtfeger
has been in the regiment for nearly seven
years and he has been a guardsman for
seventeen years. Edward F. Rivers was
promoted from first sergeant of Company
M to be second lieutenant, and James A.
Hutton was appointed from civil life to
be second lieutenant of Company D.
Lieutenant Hutton is a retired army offi
cer.
While the troops were being mustered
in the morning Lieutenant Colonel Du
boce accompanied Major Field, U. S. A.,
the artillery inspector, to the Richmond
District to Inspect camp sites. Hermaa
Schussler, chief engineer of the Spring
Valley Water Company, was one of the
party. There had been several sites ten
dered, among them being the old race
track property, a site on the hills divid
ing the Richmond District from the Pre
sidio and another on the hospital tract.
None of these were selected, however,
principally because of Colonel . Duboce's
plea that it would be subversive of the
discipline of the regiment to put it any
place where the discipline of the men
could be interfered with, and he believed
it was better to put them out at the Pre
sidio, where the military surroundings as
well as the presence and example of the
regular troops and of the other regiments
would help to infuse the military spirit
into the organization.
It was finally decided to select a place
on the big parade plain at the Presidio to
the right of the entrance gate. It was
the desire of the inspecting officers to
leave the parade plain as clear as pos
sible, so the camp will be pitched close to
the boundary of the reservation. W ater
will be piped to the most available places
on the campground, and Mr. Schussler
guaranteed for the regiment v. ater enough
for all purposes and to spare.
It was not possible to get the men un
der proper cover before last evening, and
so they were once more allowed to sleep
at home, but they were ordered to report
at the armory at 8 o'clock this morning,
and one of the first duties taught will be
promptness, for Colonel Smith says he
will have no stragglers.
CALIFORNIA
VOLUNTEERS.
Two Battalions of Infantry
Will Rendezvous at
Stockton.
The formation of the two battalions of
infantry has been determined upon by
the Governor, who has decided to follow
the desired policy of the President as far
as possible and keep the regimental or
ganization intact. The Sixth Regiment
will be taken in entirety, with the ex
ception of Company F of Fresno, which
will be replaced in the . battalions by
Company E of Sacramento, from the
Second Regiment. The companies form
ing the battalion will rendezvous at
Stockton on Sunday night or Monday
morning, and proceed from that point
here.
The Governor has appointed Colonel
Choynski as lieutenant of one of the
batteries of heavy artillery.
The following dispatch was received
from Colonel Last just as he left Los
Angeles with his regiment:
LOS ANGELES, CM., May 6. IS9B.
Brigadier General A. W. Barrt'tt, San Fran
cisco, Cal.: First section starting 12:4o p. in.;
interior trains delayed. Crush of people at
depot so great as to make it impOM ble to
move. C. F. A. LAST.
Colonel Command m^.
Colonel Guthrie of the Second Regiment
and General Wartield were In conlorenee
with the Governor yesterday. The latter
officer, when shown a copy of the resolu
tion adopted by the Building Trades
Council opposing the appointment of
Harrison G. Otis to the brigadier-general
ship, refused to discuss the matter, but
said he understood that the resolutions
had been wired to the President and that
there was no doubt that Otis was very
unpopular among the workingmen of the
West.
Captain Cook's battery of heavy artil
lery will lea.ye Sacramento at 4 o'clock
this morning, arriving here at 8:15 o'clock
this morning. It will be immediately
marched to the First Regiment Armory,
Page and Gough streets, where the men
will be mustered Into service prior to the
arrival of the Seventh Kegiment from L<os
Angeles.
Captain Steere's battery will leave Los
Angeles at an early hour to-morrow
rnornir.j', arriving h *re Monday morning
at 7:45 o'clock. It wfll be mustered into
service just as soon as the Seventh has
been mustered in, and in the meanwhile
the men will be quartered at one of the
armories here.
General Barrett was officially notified
yesterday when the Seventh left L,os An
geles, and the headquarters was kept in
formed of the progress of Colonel Berry's
command along the entire route. The
Seventh will arrive this morning, and it
will fcio met at the foot of Market street
by the Naval Militia, the Ltugue of the
Cross Cadets and the Signal Corps. The
regiment will be at once marched to its
quarters at tho First Regiment Armory.
Early yesterday morning Governor
Budd received the following complimen
tary dispatch, at which he and his stall
were highly gratified:
VANCOUVER BARRACKS, Wash..
. . May 6, UN.
Governor of California, San Francisco. Cal. :
I am gratified at your prompt work of organ
ization. MERRIAM.
Brigadier General.
Major Rice of the heavy artillery was at
headquarters In the morning, and re
ported to the adjutant-general that his
two batteries had assembled at the arm
ory on Market street and that they were
being physically examined, and that he
had been notified by Captain Carrington
that they would be mustered in this
morning: Colonel Thomas F. Barry,
formerly of the Third Infantry, will be
one of the lieutenants of Battery A. He
was selected by Major Rice, and his com
mission will be signed jby the Governor.
ORDERS FROM
GENERAL MERRIAM
Fourteenth Infantry and
Volunteers to Camp at
the Presidio.
General Bferrtam, U. S. A., commanding
the departments of California and the
Columbia, wired from Vancouver to mili
tary headquarters in this city yesterday,
directing that the California \'olunteors
should go into camp on the Presidio res
ervation. He directed also that space
should be reserved at the Presidio for the
volunteers of Oregon and Washington
and the Fourteenth Infantry, U. S. A.
This practically settles the question of
camp location. Doubtless the command
ing general will be in San Francisco early
next week and give personal attention
to the organization of the new troops.
There Is bound to be some confusion at
the Presidio for a few days, until the vol
unteers get comfortably settled down to
the discipline of camp life. There has al
ready been some friction regarding the
particular location of the volunteer camp.
The present plan, so far as it is disclosed,
is to reserve the barracks and the ground
nearest the post headquarters for the
Fourteenth Infantry. The volunteers will
be placed near the drill plain, as they will
require daily instruction on the drill
grounds. Until the arrival of an army of
iicer who will command the soldiers In
the camp First Lieutenant John M. Neal),
Troop C, Fourth Cavalry, stationed at
the Presidio, will be detailed to assist in
the organization of the volunteers. The
quartermaster's department has made all
the necessary arrangements to furnish
fuel for cooking purposes, and the pur
chasing commissary will issue the regu
lation ration. The camp will be inde
pendent of the Presidio proper, but the
troops will be compelled to obey the post
regulations.
First Lieutenant J. E. Nolan, post com
missary officer at the Presidio, was taken
by surprise yesterday when he received
an order directing him to supply the vol
unteers with fresh beef. The order did
not say whether he should supply 100 or
10.000 volunteers. Having no herds of
cattle on the reservation and no imme
diate means for furnishing a large quan
tity of fresh boof, he consulted Colonel
Morris, commanding the post. The con
clusion was reached that the order to
BUPPIy fresh beet' was Intended for Lieu
tenant Sidnoy a. Cioman, V. S. A., acting
quartermaster and commissary of volun
teers. It is not known now just how Mr.
Cioman will get the beef for the volun
teers, but he will round up the herds of
cattle somewhere if the contractors do
not come to his rescue.
It is understood at the Presidio that
the organizations of the Fourth United
States Cavalry, now stationed in the De
partment of the Columbia, will soon be
ordered to San Francisco. It is almost
certain that the regulars of the Fourth
Cavalry and Fourteenth Infantry will be
the first troops sent to reinforce Com
modore Dewey at Manila. The opinion is
.expressed that two batteries of the Third
Artillery may be sent to the Philippines
with the first column of troops.
The different staff departments of the
United States army stationed in this city
were busy yesterday completing arrange
ments for properly equipping the volun
teers for service. As soon as estimates
and requisitions are forwarded to the
heads of the different departments the
new troops will be supplied with quar
termaster, commissary, ordnance and
medical supplies. .
The recruiting office at the Presidio is
a busy place. Lieutenant Boyd is daily
enlisting excellent men. He has sent
some recruits to the Fourth Cavalry,
others to the Third Artillery, and quite a
number have been sent East to join the
regiments at Tampa,
The artillerymen stationed at Fort Point
and those garrisoning the mortar and
dynamite batteries are constantly on
duty. While there are no indications of
the approach of an enemy a vigilant
lookout is maintained. A powerful search
right to scan the sea by night has been
secured.
HEALTH TO THE VOLUNTEERS
I hear the call of the bugle,
I get a glimpse o' the gun.
And the thrill that I feel at the Hash o' the
steel
Is the same as In sixty-one;
But the boys in blue ara marchln'.
The time for action has comeâ
From the old Granite State to the locked
Golden Gate
They step to the tap o' the drum.
So here's to the call o' the bugle;
Anil here's to the flash o' the spears;
But the heartfelt toapt that we love most
Is a health to the volunteers.
The eagle is stretching his pinions.
The banner is thrown to the breeze.
The blue and the gray are all one to-day
And the foe is far o'er the seas.
No longer is brother 'gainst brother.
No longer is father 'gainst son;
But all now unite for the heart of the fight
And a victory that must be won.
So here's to the bird o' the Nation,
And here's to the red, white and blue;
But we have three cheers for the brave
volunteers
And a health and a kind adieu.
âGeorge 11. Thornton.

WHEREAS, Our order was born and nur
tured in the same cradle of liberty as our
country, and once more the flag of our nation

Call, is self-explanatory:
HEADQUARTERS DIVISION', N. O. C,
SAN FRANCISCO, May 6. 1898.â City Editor
Â« "all. San Francisco: It seoms to me that it
would be a very appropriate thing while our
local troops are being mustered Into the ser
vice of the Doited States and particularly
while a large body of them Is moving, as is
the Seventh Infantry from Los Angeles, which
will arrive in the city to-morrow Saturday),
that the Stars and Stripes should be displayed
from every flagstaff in the city.
Let our flap be displayed on every hand for
the cni-ouniKemmt of those who are rallying
to its defense, for the education of those who
remain behind and particularly of the children
who are growing up and upon whom, in due
time will devolve the protection of our flag.
I take the opportunity of writing this and
sup^i-sting that you, through your valuable
paper, call the attention of our citizens to
this matter, which I consider a very important
one at this time, and urge them to throw
"Old Glory" to the breeze from every house
limping this suggestion will meet your ap
proval. I am. very respectfully, your orient
servant JOHN H. DICKINSON,
Major General Com. Division, N. G. C.
The Seventh Regiment will bo met in

The parade will move promptly at 11
o'clock.
MOSBY'S POSITION.
Services Offered as an
Example of United
Country.
Colonel John S. Mosby still maintains
his position that Congressional influence
cannot add to the value of his services
as a soldier. In an interview yesterday
he remarked:
"I offered to serve the Government as
a soldier, without specifying any rank or
position. I was not prompted by ambi
tion, but a desire to set an example that
would be evidence of a united country.
The offer was made to the War Depart
ment through the commander-in-chief of
the army. I did not consider that I was
asking a political favor of the adminis
tration. I was surprised to hear that Con
gressional influence was required to se
cure the privilege of fighting the battles
of the country. I have no control over
any such influence and would not ask it.
I cannot imagine what any Congressman
could say that would add anything to the
indorsements I have received from Gen
eral Grant and General Robert E. Lee."
READY TO MUSTER.
Artillerymen Hope to Sleep
in Their Tented City
To-NiÂ£ht.
All day yesterday large crowds of men
gathered about the entrance to the First

ORGANIZER OF VOLUNTEER ARTILLERY.
MAJOR FRANK S. RICE.
Major Frank S. Rice, inspector Third Brigade, National Guard of Cali
fornia, and organizer of the batteries of heavy artillery of California volun
teers, graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point
July 1, IS7O, with the rank of second lieutenant of infantry, and for a time
was on duty in the department of tactics at West Point, and successively
served at the station at Key West, Fla. ; Signal School of Practice at Fort
Whipple, Virginia; Michigan Military Academy at Orchard Lake; Fort In
dependence, Boston harbor; Fort Warren, Massachusetts; Fort Adams,
Rhode Island; at the Presidio, San Francisco, Cal. His last duty in connection
with the regular army previous to his retirement was at Fort Mason, in tkia

the severe medical examination of Sur

Rethers. of the 491 men examined only

withstand the rigors of a soldier's life.
It is expected that the full quota of re
cruits will be made up early this morning
and that the mustering in of the artil
lerymen will take place this afternoon.
Through the persistent efforts of Colonel
Geary and Captain I.ocke the men al
ready show a marked improvement in
discipline, and a feeling of friendly rival

proficiency in drill. All are eager to don
their uniform, and hope that to-night
they will sleep In the tented city on the

Patriotism Around the
Campfires.
Within a fortnight 6000 regulars and
volunteers may be mobilized In this city.
The Presidio of San Francisco will pre
sent a martial sight when the troops
parade in daylight, but the vivid scenes
or' TKttriotic inspiration will be witnessed
in the evening when the soldiers gather
around a myraid of glowing campfires
and sing the songs of patriotism. Voices
of men singing the Battle Hymn of the
Republic produce a thrilling effect, and
since the war with Spain is a conflict la
the cause of humanity, the volunteers
will sing:
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was bora
across the sea
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures
you and me.
As he died to make men holy let us die to
make men free.

Women and the Wheel.
From the Gazette, Delaware, Ohio.
Tho healthfulness of bicycle riding: for
women is still a disputed question be-
tween eminent physicians and health re-
formers.
Used in moderation it surely creates for
women a means of out-door exercise, the
benefit of which ail physicians concede.
Used to excess, like any other pastime,
its effect is likely to be dangerous.
The experience of Miss Bertha Reed,
the seventeen-year-old daughter of Mr
J. R. Reed, 335 Lake street, Delaware,
Ohio, may point a moral for parents who'
like Mr. and Mrs. Reed, have experienced
some concern for their daughters who are

"Central" will hear nothing but "Put

down 50 cents"â both of which mes-
B&gea are equally acceptable.
The finest, the most spontaneous, the
noblest answer to that appeal published
yesterday was given by the pupils of
the Washington Grammar School, cor
ner of Mason and Washington streets.
The Washington Grammar School is
the banner school of San Franciscoâ
the first to enroll Itself as the champion
of humanity, the first to be touched by
the thought that the soldier boys of
California were about to go to war un
prepared, handicapped, hindered by in
sufficient provision, by lack of medical
appliances, by the want of that tender
forethought which It is the province of
the Red Cross to Buppy.
Miss Ma Kervan, who at Monday
night's meeting declared that "the
women of California are the most loyal,
the truest-hearted of any of the whole
Union, and they will prove their pat
riotism when occasion requires," is a
teacher at the Washington Grammar,
a sehn.il for boys. Yesterday, with per
il of Principal T. C. White. Miss
Kervan addressed the boys of the
Washington Grammar, four rooms of
them at a time, the doors being thrown
open for that purpose. The effect of
the patriotic teacher's address was im-
The whole Washington
Grammar has formed itself into a Red
Cross Societyâ every boy of them, from
the tiniest transplanted German to him
of Spanish descent in the upper class,
signing a form pledging himself to a
certain sum every- month, so long as
the war shall continue. The volunteer
list is headed by the principal's name,
promising $1 monthly and those of all
twelve teachers for 50 cents apiece.
There's a record for the schools of San
Francisco to aspire after, and to out
doâif they can! The Red Cross So
ciety will present each of these new
recruits with badges.
There were many curious and pa
thetic incidents, too, in connection with
this banner school of the Red Cross.
When one lad put his name down for
50 cents monthly, his teacher profc
"But I can, I say," insisted the young
patriot, "and I will." Another small
Teuton â it is the youthful American of
foreign descent, five or six hundred of
them, that fills the Washington Gram
mar School â informed his teacher that
his father gave him a nickel every day
for carrying his lunch to him, and that
nickel should be a Red Cross nickel
every month until the war is over. His
brother, who goes to turning school,
I remarked that "Walking: is pretty good
those days. A fellow can save his car
fare if he wants to." And so he can.
and will, for he's down for 10 cents a
month. But there was a small dark
skinned lad wlur craved a private In
terview with the leader of the niove
; ment.
"Thay," he lisped, "thay, my moth
i er's Thpanish, you know. She won't
\ let me give a thent. But, thay, my
father will. Ileth Thpanish, too, but
it's California Thpanish, and that
; meanth American. Put me down for
i lij centh."
Of all the war documents that are

would be this record of a voluntary in

THE SAIS T FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
REV. JOHN COYLE, M.D., D.D.
The president of the Berkeley High School Sanitary Commission gives some
practical suggestions for the formation of auxiliary leagues to the Red Cross
Society In the country districts. His communication is as follows:
"As there are thousands of patriotic young men and women in the country
dist-cts of the State who would be glad to aid the. Red Cross movement now
un<] r way, but do not know just how to begin. I have thought a few sugges
tions to get them started would not be out of place at this time.
"We all realize there Is no time to lose. Our California boys will soon be
ordered to Manila. We must not let them go unprepared to face the danger and
suffering of Held and hospital, and as there are thousands m village, town and
hamlet who would gladly help us if you will tell them how, I venture to sug
gesl the following plan for organization:
"FiTrt-JLet there be a call tesued by the press and pulpit of the town or
village for a meeting at some given time and place for all interested in this
work to enroll. . . ,
"Second-After the enrollment list is complete, elect a temporary chairman
and secretary Then appoint a nominating committee to name permanent offl
cerÃ-preSident vice-president, secretary and treasurer and an advisory board of
five or seven. This board, with the officers, will constitute the executive com
mittee to act ad Interim with power. Let the committee name also a medical
consulting board, composed of the physicians In the town or village, who will
advise how to prepare bandages, disinfected materials for wounds, etc.
"Thirdâ l et this executive committee appoint the following committees: Com
mittee on finance, committee on medical supplies, committee on food and com

Clubs Consider the Charter.
Several of the improvement clubs have
switched off from their local wants to
the consideration of the charter. At the
meetings of the West of Castro Street,
the Lick-Wilmerding and Precita Valley
clubs the proposed fundamental law was
discussed at their gatherings last night.
In all of these the charter : was talKed
over. The good and bad points were
paraded and compared with the existing
laws which now govern the city. In tho
majority of | the clubs no expression of
opinion was offered further than the ask
ing of questions of such of the speakers

S. L. ACKERMAN
AS STAGE MANAGER
Will Direct Afternoon Perform
ances Soon to Be Given
at the Alcazar.
Many of Henrik Ibsen's Works Will
Be Presented to the Society
Folk of the City.
A series of afternoon performances will |
soon be given at the Alcazar Theater.
The management states that it will be
a society event and bid for the intelli
gence and culture of the city. The plays
given will be the works of Henrik Ibsen j
and Maurice Maeterlinck, and, among
others, "A Doll's House," "Pillars of
Society," "Hedda Gabler," "Ghost
AValks," "The Intruder," "The Blind"
and "The Seven Princesses" will be pre
serited by the clever stock company now ,
on the boards at the theater. j
Ibsen's plays are considered second only
to Shakespeare's, and as S. L. Aukerman j
is to act as stage manager during the
performances in the afternoons, large :
crowds will, without doubt, encourage the !
new departure. The spirit of enterprise ]
exhibited by the management is buoyed I
up by the Feason that they have the con- |
fidence of the public, and the time In
which the performances will be given de
pends upon the reception accorded them.
Mr. Ackerrnan, who will act as stage
manager, is a. well-known society and
club man, and has often assumed charge
of the productions presented by amateur
society people in this city. Mr. Ackerman
believes that the plays will tend to ele
vate theatricals in general, and as soclety
will gather on the first night to witness
"A Doll's House," a continued success is
looked for. The new stage manager does
not interfere with the duties of others
during the regular evening performances,
but he has entered the idea with the de
termination to bring- off the plays in the'
best manner possible.
FAILURE TO PROVIDE.
An Unusual Number of Cases in the
Police Courts Recently.
There have been an unusual number of
cases of failure to provide In the Police
Courts recently, and yesterday Judge
Low issued no less than four warrants
for the arrest of husbands on this charge.
Delia T. Daggett, 51 I.angton street,

mentioned defendant was tried before
Judge Joachimsen on Thursday on the
same charge and the case waa dis
missed, as at the time alleged In the com
plaint the defendant had provided for his

Yesterday Gteorge Aubertlne. a barber,

The Wasp This Week.
! The cartoon features of that splendid

'as to what the United States is doing:
toward war preparations from the yellow
I Journals that are always full swing, and
i in consequence of which there is little
! necessity to have spies in America. An
other cartoon depicts Don Quixote Budd
, and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza
Colnon off to the war, bent on pulling
; down' the Spanish throne. Another car
toon contains a suggestion for a new
monument to be dedicated to the Mayor,
ami another picturesquely depicts the bil I
board nuisances. There are some half
dozen splendid half-tone engravings of
; the warships In Admiral Deweys vie-
I torious squadron, and also of those on
the Atlantic Coast, besides a very enter
taining article on the past and present or
sea fighting, with pictures of ships that
carried the Stars and stripes to victory
iin the olden timÂ». Senator Mulrooney re
sumes his letters to The Wa*si> and this
week disserts on practical politics as con
ducted on true Jaeksonian principles. In
the "Plain Talk to Public Characters"
there is a brief address to 'the crop of
would-be Napoleons who crave for imme
diate military prominence, with a view
i to the profits of peace that follow in the
wake of war. In the "Old Maid's Diary"
Tabitha TwiggS exposes the weakness of
, the fair sex for "fibbing." and in the
"Social Side Lights" several 'cry enter
taining stories are told on people who
are known in society and out of it. The
editorials in The Wasp this week are, as

Deformities of the Face.
The Medical and Surgical Reporter of :
Philadelphia, one of the leading journals [
of America, contains an article on the [
surgical treatment of deformities of the
face, by Dr. McTapgart, formerly of this
city but now of Grass Valley, in which
some very delicate and artistic surgery
is performed. If an ear projects, is too
lar^e or irregular in shape, or a nose '
is crooked, beaked, too long, flat or in '
any way deformed, he skillfully corrects
the deformity by a plastic operation and j
thus converts ugliness and forbidding ;
features into expression, attractiveness .;
and beauty.

ALICE NEILSON

The California Prima Donna
Severs Her Connection With
the Bostonians.
Miss Giustl Reported to Have Also
Resigned. Owing to Dis
eension.
Alice Nellson has returned home. The
popular prima donna has severed her con

present plans are carried out she will i
remain here quietly until she starts out i
next season at the head of her own com- |
pany.
It to reported that Miss Glustl has also
left the Bostonlans, and if the stories |
flying about in theatrical circles are I
founded on fact, the liveliest kind of a
row has taken place, culminating in the
two California songstresses resigning
rather than submit to what they deemed
unwarranted interference on the part or

There are two versions of the trouble.

tremely obnoxious to the other members
of the company by her efforts to monop
olize the stage and the favors of the au
diences. It is charged that all the ap
plause was taken to herself and that none
of the others was permitted to share in
the commendations.
Miss Giusti, toe, it is said, early devel
oped an undue appreciation of her own
abilities, to thÂ« extreme fatigue of her
associates, and when the management In
timated that It would be well to give the
otherg some chance she withdrew from
the company. Miss Nell?Â»on was not so
easily disposed of. She had several
stormy interviews with the manager, but
when he insisted that she make herself
leas conspicuous she, too, retired.
Miss Nell sen's version Is quite different.
It la to the effect that the other members,
envious of her pronounced success, re
sorted to every means to annoy ana be
little her. Interruptions were of frequent
occurrence, her cue given at the wrong
time and a constant clatter kept up be- ]
hind the scenes during her solos. Finding
her protests had no weight with the man
ager, she concluded it would be better
to resign, and djd bo. Miss Neilson is
exceedingly gratified with her reception
by the Kastern musical public and is
building high hopes of success In antici
pation of the time when she starts ou,t
with her own company.

RELAY COURIERS
FOR THE
CYCLERS' RACE
The fifth annual relay race of the
California Associated Cycling CUibs will
take place to-morrow, and the members
of the five clubs that have entered teams
are in a fever heat of expectancy. Al
though this Is just one-half the num
ber of clubs that entered teams In this
great event last year, the Interest In the
contest is unabated. The five clubs en
tered this year being the Acme Club
Wheelmen and Reliance Club Wheelmen
of Oakland, Garden City Wheelmen of
Qtai Jose, Bay City Wheelmen and Olym
pic Club Wheelmen of this city, finished
in the first live places last year, the order
being Bay City, Olympic, Reliance, Acme
and Garden City. It te a case of the
survival of the fittest, as the other clubs
other lacked the racing men or found
the expenses of maintaining a relay team
too heavy to warrant the outlay.
Just a brief resume of the raoe itself
may be given here, and -when it Is said
that the event is watched and read of
throughout the whole United States by
all the wheeling fraternity, some idea of
its importance in the mind of the aver
age cyclist may be gained.
The race ip a distance of 100 miles, from
this city to San Jose via San Bruno road,
and back to Alamcda on the other side
of the bay. The start here Is at the cor
ner of McAllister and Larkin streets at
i> o'clock sharp to-morrow morning, and
the finish will be about five hours later
on Central avenue, Al&meda, between
Pearl and Regent streets.
Eacb club participating entora a team
of w-n men; each of whom rides a relay
of ten miles for his club. Bach man is
furnished by bis club with a "trailer,"
usually a clubmate, whose sole duty it is
to lend the relay rider he Is following
his own wheel In case the relay courier
breaks down. The trailer is kept back
of the courier a couple of minutes at
the start, so as not to Interfere with
the couriers of other clubs.
A 1 the start the riders of the first relay
are handed a leather packet, which usu
ally contains h. letter from the Mayor of
this city to the chairman "i the Board
of Trustees of Alameda, commenting upon
the rii ft itnd wishing him the compliments
c; the day. At the end of the first relaj
each man hands his packet over as soon
3a lie arrives to the rider of his club
on the .second relay, and so on down the
line, and tlie dub man who first bears his
li.uket across tin- tape at the end of the
tenth relay Is declared the winner of the
race, that is, his club wins the trophy
for that year. It must be won three times
to obtain linal possession, and as a nevv
cup is being run for this year, it has
yet to be won for the n'rst time.

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, MAT* 7, 1898.
I Is down Larkin street to Ninth, down
Ninth to Folsom, to Twenty-second, to
Potrero avenue and out to the San Bruno
road. Many will probably wheel out the
San Bruno road to the Six-mile Hill, from
the top of which a splendid view caJi be
I had. The men can be seen for a mile
j coming toward the city, and the sight of
them going pell-mell down the other side
will never be forgotten.
It was estimated that fully 20.000 people
assembled at the finish in Alameda last
year, and there will probably be as great
a throng to-morrow. Most of the of
ficials and club men will go over on the
boats from 11 to 12:30 o'clock, so as to be
on hand early. Bulletins will be posted at
the corner of Park street and Central
avenue, Alameda, from telephonic advices
sent by the judges at the end of each re
lay, showing the progress of the race, and
these will be productive of a great deal
of interest.
The trophy for which the clubs are con-
I testing this" year is a beautiful silver cup
' valued at $250, presented to the assoeia
! tion by Leavitt & Bill, and It will be a
valuable addition, to any club's silver
chest, apart from the glory of winning it.

REGATTA OF THE
SOUTH END CLUB.
The boating evpnt of tne week was the
regatta of the South End Rowing Club
lost Sunday. The day was beautiful, the
water smooth and there was some good
racing. The course was rather more
than half a mile straight out from the
clubhouse, round a barge, and return.
The disappointment of the day was the
non-appearance of the sculler Dr. C. C.
Dennis, whose duties with the naval bat
talion detained him. The half-mile spe
cial spurt between Al Fritz and Frank
Duplissea did not como off, Fritz having
strained himself by overreaching; while
playing baseball The junior skiff race
between Joseph Lyons and James Pallns
was won by the former, and the ;nter
medlate barge race was also won by a
volunteer crew, stroked by Joseph Lyons.
The junior barge race was won by Barry's
crew, the victory being mainly due to the
good course steered by George McGrill.
Though Chetwood Avres of the Alameda
Boat Club beat Len Hausler of the South
End Club in the skiff race, it is probable
tli at Hausler, who has only recently taken
up rowing again, did not exert himself.
In the open skiff race between Tom Shor
tall and Mat Breen of the South End

Club, Tom bhortall caught a crab and
capsized In the iirst twenty yards; W. O.
Patch won. The Dolphin Club sent its
Bix-oared barge, and the Alameda Club
its senior barge crew, to the regatta.
Among the visitors were J. R. Bookman
'of the Ariel Rowing Club, C. H. Smith
and W. B. Hlnchman of the Alameda
Boat Club, a crew of naval battalion men
in a Whitehall; Arthur . Inkersley of the
Oxford University and Adelaide Univer

Harvard College. After the races songs
and music entertained the visitors In the
clubhouse. The Soutu End picnic takes
plar-e to-morrow at Mirabel Park; it is
hoped that the proceeds will materially
diminish the indebtedness incurred in the
erection of the handball court in the club
house.
The Ariel Rowing Club will hold Its re
gatta on the first Sunday in June. The
senior and junior crew are now In regu

crews will compete: First â Edward Mc-

If the Oakland management has neglected

Wheeler, the "soldier boy," has been

are in good shape, the game should de
velop into a pitcher's battle.
Charles' O'Kane, who played with the
Oaklands of the Pacific States League,
has been released, owing to the consoli
dation. Why he should be left out is a
mystery. There are very few, if any,
players now on the coast that surpass
him in his position, and there are any
number on the various teams that, as ball
players, should not be mentioned in the
same breath with O'Kane. Owing to lack
of practice he, like a good many others

DOGS OF QUALITY
COURSING FOR COIN.
No less than 140 greyhounds will com
pote for coin and fame at the two cours
ing parks to-day. The sport might be
said to be at its height, and certainly it
has reached an elevation never befcre at
tained on the coast or in America.
At Ingleside to-day and to-morrow two
stakes will be run off, viz. : an all-age
event for the top-notchers, embracing
forty-eight entries, and a puppy contest
between twenty of the keenest youngsters
ever going to slips. The feature at Union
Park is an all-age open event, in which
seventy-two performers will compete for
honors. The candidates at both parks in
clude many of quality and the sport will
be correspondingly hot.
The rundown at Ingleslde will bother
the talent a bit this afternoon. The dogs
are all well matched and in some cases
with exceptional closeness. The likeliest
to raise a flag are High Born Lady. Fi
renzi, Tallamore, Lass o' Gowrie, Myrtle,
Benicia Boy.Bonita.Right Bower, Eclipse,
Connemara, Prince Hal, Van Kirk, Van
Needa, Sylvia, Tessie Fair, Promise Me,
Mystic Maid, Whiu> Uly, Glen Roy, Se
norita, Occidental, Nelly Conroy, Hinaloa
and Sweet Music.
The rundown of the puppies at Ingle-
Bide should go to Dauntless, Thornhill,
Rathbone, Royal Prize, Liberty Bell,
Royal Oak, Soubrette, Minerva, Dempsy
Lass and Magnesia.
The Interstate Coursing Club held Its
usual monthly meeting this week, Domi
nlck Shannon presiding. Among tho im
portant business was the establishing of
a new stake, wherein the usual liberal
prize (S6OO added money) v.ill be hung up,
but divided in such a manner as to give |
the winner Jl.'.u and the otlvrs in propor- j
tion down to the winners of one course
who will receive $7 50 each. The first of
these stakes will be run off two weeks
from to-day at Ingleside and
once every three months, or in the months
embracing five Sundays.
The club also passed the following res
olution: "That Ihe breeder of the puppy
winning first prise in any of the club s j
future proditcp stdkes shall receive ten
per cent of tho money won by such puppy ]
in said stakes."
It is expected that the famous Handy
& Smith string of Minnesota will arrive
here early next week. Mr. Smith has al
ready been In the city several days and
only awaits his dogs to embark in the
game with vigor.
Excellent sport Is promised at union
Park to-day. The winners of the stake
should be Kingston. Moore's Prescription,
McKinley, Lord Byron, Terrona, Rusty
Gold, Jester, Sharkey, Theron, Black
stone, Arapahoe, Laurelwood, At Last, i
Glenwood, The Turk, Cavalier, Royal j
Buck, Lissak, Sweet Lips. Robert Adair, j
L. S. Connelly, Fear Not, Port Costa
however, necessarily follow that, with
practice, he will not be able to play in
his old form. I would advise some of
these managers who, it appears, are un
able to tell a good player when they see
one, to sign Mr. O'Kane, and lose no
time. Here are the names of a few play
ers who, from all accounts, are quite fast
enough for the Pacific Coast League:
Pitt, late of Sacramento team, of Califor
nia League; pitched four games .'md won
throp, besides weighs 220 pounds and
stands six feet high. Williams, shortstop
of San Jose team, late California League.
Packenfield, pitcher of the Napa City
team. This man never lost a game while
with the above named club. These play
ers have good records, and should be
given a chance.
Baltimore is crazy over the great pitch
ing of Hughes. They say he is the best
pitcher that ever donned an "Oriole" uni-
form.
The grand stand and bleachers at Recre
ation Park are to be painted. No money
is to be spared In making this park the
best in California.
The Young Olympics have- reorganized,
and would like to hear from all teams
under fifteen years. Their line Up is as
follows: Davis, pitcher; Sleffen, catcher;
Sinleton, first base; Smith, second base;
Sullivan, third base; Lynch, shortstop;
Rail, left field; Teska, center field; Marx,
right field. Address all letters to Tony
H. Teska. 448 Jessie street.
Jim Sullivan, of the Oakland-Reliance
team, says that Owinger. who at present
is pitching for the Grass Valley club, is
a good pitcher, and should be signed by
one of the league clubs. Here is a good
chance for some team. In fact there fs
not a team in the league that could not
afford to support a good pitcher. They
certainly are very scarce.
"Truck" Egran says that he is going to
devote all his spare time to pitching.
Not a bad idea, "Truck." First learn
how to control the ball, the rest comes
very easy.
Manager Swanton says that all teams
.are treated fairly by the umpire in, Santa ,
Lass, Amorita, Rocklln Belle, Tod Sloan,
Hercules, E V D, Clipper, Move On, Syl
vanus, Susie, White Chief, Jennie Deane,
O'Grady and Pastime.
The running at both parks' to-day com
mences at the usual hour, 1 o'clock. At
Ingleside the puppies will go first to the
slips, and both stakes will be , carried
through the first rundown.
Among the puppies at Ingleslde to-day
are several that have never been seen
before, and rumor has It that something
In the way of sensationalism may de

RACKET-WIELDERS IN
INTERCLUB DOUBLES.
To encourage Interest in doubles, the
three bay tennis clubs have come together
and arranged a series of games which
will be played off every Saturday. Each
club is represented by two teams, and the
winner of the most games during the sea
son will receive a handsome trophy, to be
come the property of the club which they
represent. The first game will be played
this afternoon at the California Club
courts.
The following complete schedule has
been arranged:
May 7â San Francisco vs. Alameda, at San
Francisco.
May 14â Oakland vs. Alameda, at Alameda.
May ilâ San Francisco vs. Oakland, at Oak-
May 2Sâ San Francisco vs. Oakland, at San

June 4â Oakland vs. Alameda, at Oakland.
June 11 â San Francisco vs. Alameda, at Ala
meda.
Owing to the refusal of the Whltneys
to represent the California Tennis Club
in these matches, San Francisco will not
have its strongest teams In the field
against the suburban competitors. Harry
Weihe and S. H. Adams will be one of
the teams that will work for the local
club; the other will be picked to-day.
During the week the following interest
ing matches were played: George Whit
ney and Dr. Root defeated Robert N.
Wnltney in three very close sets. Geor t r e
Whitney defeated Dr. Root in two
Btraigbt sets. A. G. Buckley and W. G.

Dally and Cornell defeated J. McGavin
and Grant Smith, oâ 4. 6â4.
Although the ladles' doubles did not
eventuate, the courts were well patron
ized by the fair sex during the week.
A series of matches were played among
the following ladies: Misses Bowman,

On Monday a match was played be

Such Is life.
Recreation Park Is the scene of great
excitement, and all on account of a big
game between San Francisco and San
Jose which is scheduled to take place
there Sunday afternoon. Altogether ten
men are at work on the grounds and
stands, laboring hard to have everything
in readiness for the big crowd that is
expected to be present when the umpire
ejaculates "Play ball" in to-morrow's
game.
Twenty-seven loads of sand have been
taken off the fieldâ the uneven spots
patched up, until now the diamond looks
as smooth as a billiard table. The stands,
which a week ago presented anything but
an inviting appearance, have been dusted
and cleaned, so there need not be any
fears regarding the ruination of silks or
satins. Little boys unaccompanied by
their parents will "not be allowed in the
grand stand, a place having been re
served for them in the left field bleachers.
This was a very good move on the part
of the management-
President Bert says that in three weeks
the electric road from Market street
down Eighth to the grounds will be run
ning, and that everything is being done
to make things as pleasant as possible
for the baseball public. He also states
that the contracts for all private boxes
have been renewed, on account of the
consolidation, and were leased as fol

ATHLETIC TRIPS
OF THE
COLLEGE BOYS
The Eastern trip of the California ath
letes has finally been sacrificed, and in
stead of such a lengthy journey for fresh
honors the Blue and Gold team will sound
the north. As soon as the colleg-e vaca
tion begins the track and field men will
leave Berkeley for Portland to face the
Multnomah Athletic Club team. Besides
the Multnomahs dates have been arrang
ed with the Tacoma Athletic Club and the
Seattle Athletic Club.
There is something back of this substi
tute trip which has not been made pub
lic. The spirit of the university and the
popular feeling- is in favor of the Eastern
crusade, but there Is one person in the
athletic affairs of the college at present
and his influence has proved all powerful
in preventing such a venture this year.
Everett Brown Is the steerer of the ship,
and by his well laid plans he has accom
plished his desires. Brown did not in
dorse the actions of his fellow students
in the preliminary efforts to "secure tne
necessary accessions for the Eastern
trip. He had other things in view which
he considered more important and which
if the team went East would be impossi
ble to realize. In order to have the Blue
and Gold represented on Eastern fields
both the college and the alumni would
perforce be obliged to subscribe for the
consummation of this design. Now
Brown, considerate for the pockets of his
fellows, fears to ask too much. At pres
ent he is contemplating a touch of the
students and the alumni for a scheme
which is dearer to his heartâ the building
of an atlilttlc field, club house and gen
eral training quarters, second to none in
the country. This is the reason why he
did not advocate the trip to the East. To
attain both would not be feasible or pos-
sible. Brown considers one a luxury, the
other a necessity.
The present aggregation of talent at
Berkeley is way and above anything that
the colkK^ n;is heretofore produced. In
every hraneh of field and track athletics
California has a list of champions. When
the home team meets the Multnomah,
however, an interesting field day may lie
expected. The Multnomahs always were
a strong athletic club. Two years ago,
when the Olympics sent a picked team to
try conclusions with the Portlanders they
were ignominiously beaten. The Multno
mahs will have a strong team to set
against the visitors. Besides the home
talent they will lie re-enforced by Mor
gan, Stanford's crack all-round athlete.
Morgan wMI very probably meet Bakewell
in the Inn dies, and for the first time their
respective merits will be tested. The
Multnomahs also have Kerrigan, the
champion high jumper of .the West. There
arc also a number of other first class ath
letes In the Multnomah team, and Cali
fornia will have no snap. Manager Do
zier will take a large team with him:
Drum. Broughton, Woolsey, Bakewell.
Dawson. Hinz. Westerfeld. Walsh. Car
roll, Carpenter. Jackson. Hoffman. Mum
ma. Guiberson. (Jriesberg and Brown.
The meets with the Seattle and Tacoma
athletic clubs are considered easy victo
ries for California. It is expected that the
revenue of the three field days will cover
the entire expenses of the trip.
CHAMPION TEAMS
PLAY BASKET-BALL.
The Portland (Or.) Young- Men's Chris
tian Association Basket-ball team will ar
rive In this city on Friday, May 18, to
play the Business Men's team of the local
association In the gymnasium, corner of
Mason and Ellis streets.
The Business Men's team holds the coast
championship for 1897, and It has also
won the California championship for IS9B,
while the Portland team Is champion of
the Pacific Northwest, having met and
defeated all the leading teams In that
section of the country.
The game to be played on Friday even-
Ing next will be of special Interest, as it
settles the coast championship for IS9B.
All the local players are training hard,
and they mean to play the game of their
lives, so as to retain the honors so long
held, and Captain Titus is confident of
victory. Wilson, Goodrich and Titus, tne
sroal-throwers of the Business Men's
team, are daily practicing, and have at
tained a degree of proficiency seldom wit
nessed. "With the able fnterference work
as guards of Auger, Bernard and Batzer
this team; with its sure passing of the
ball from one end of the field to the other,
will make a strong game, and the Port
lands will find that their eyes must be
kept wide open and their feet on the
alert in order to wrest the championship
from the local boys.
The Portlands' line-up has not been
received as yet, but the Business Men will
play in the folowlng positions: Louis
Titus and Francis Goodrich, forwards;
TV*. Wilson, center; C. J. Auger, F. J.
Batzer, Chris Bernard, backs.

CONSCIENCE OF THE CITIZEN.
An Interesting Lecture Is Delivered
by Father McNally.
"The Conscience of a Citizen" was the
interesting and novel subject that the
Rev. Father J. B. McNally of Oakland
chose to lecture upon last evening before
an immense and appreciative audience at
the Metropolitan Temple.
The lecture, which was given under the
immediate auspices of Strosmayer Coun
cil No. 460 of the Young Men's Institute,
dealt mainly with the individual thoughts
that the citizen mind conceives in con
templating external and supernatural phe
nomena, and his thoughts and ideas as
a citizen of the world regarding his fellow
man. human existence and eternity.
A distinct and plausible parallel was
drawn between the conscience of a man
raised according to the teachings of the
world and the man raised in the realm of
sacredness and within the walls of the
cloister of the church.
In conjunction with the lecture an en
tertaining programme was rendered, con
sisting, for the most part, of patriotic
songs and addresses. The introductory
address by W. F. Humphrey was a loyal
tribute to the flag, the upright policy of
the United States in the declaration of
war against Spain, for the suppression
of cruelty and inhumanity in Cuba, and
the necessity of the citizens of the coun
try standing by this declaration and en
forcing it.
"No matter whether thfi country was
acting under a just Impulse or not," said
the speaker, "what our country does
must, of necessity, be right; and if a
doubt does or should exist, now is not
the time for us to determine; we must
defeat the enemy first and debate the
Justness of the cause hereafter."
The ' programme, as rendered, was as
follows:
Introductory, Antone Pilcovich. president
Stromnayer Council No. 460, V. M. I.; address,
w. F. Humphrey, president of the evening;
patriotic sone. "In the Harbor of Havana"
(original), Frank W. Healy (accompanist, Mljs
May Stein); poem, "Hail to Our Flag," Miss

Citizen." Rev. .1. B. McNmllv; .pone, "My Love
Has Gone a Sailing 1 ." Miss Kittle McShane
(accompanist, Miss May Stein); specialties, Dr.
J. P. McCarthy.

Waller's Technical Fight.
Th<* demurrer Interposed by School Di
rector Samuel L. Waller to the indict
ment found against him, charging him !
with having in his official capacity sought I
a bribe, was argued yesterday before
Judges JBorden, Cook and Wallace. At
torney P. F. Dunne; who represented the
defendant, argued that there was .a con
flict in the luws relating to the giving
and accepting of bribes. The law as it
stands makes it a felony to seek or so
licit a bribe, and only a misdemeanor to
accept a bribe. The demurrer was taken
under advisement.

It Was James Kidney.
The statement that William Kidney,
the agitator, was arrested for drunken
ness and conveyed to the City and County
Hospital, where he died, had origin in a
confusion of names. As a matter of fact
Kidney, the agitator, was not drunk, but
was picked up on the street suffering
from pneumonia and taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and from there to the
City and County Hospital, where he died
on Thursday from pneumonia. In the
meantime and on the same day William
Kidney was arrested and locked up in the
Central station, where he is at present.
The two Kidneys mentioned are in no
way related. The deceased was a man
that never indulged in intoxicating liquor.

be received by the club. Mr. Oldham was
superintendent of the Baltimore show
held two months ago, and also of the
Pittsburg show last month. At the lat
ter place there were 633 entries. San
Francisco, with a much smaller popula
tion, had over 650 dogs last year, which
speaks well for the enthusiasm of the
keiniel men of this ooast The office of

on Sunday. The entries will close on
on Sunday evening May 8, at midnight.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
A GREAT DAY
FOR OUTSIDERS
Horses at All Sorts of
Prices Finished
First.
Imp. Mistral, a 4O to 1 Chance,
Proved the Star Per
former.
â : â
Excursion Was the Only Winning
Favorite â Morellito Downed
Odds On.
I
The slaughter of favorites . at Oakland
track yesterday was something awful.
Excursion, a tight 2 to 5 chance, of all the
choices sent into the starter's hands was
alone returned winner. The noise began
with the victory in the opening event of
Mike Rice, a 20 to 1 shot, which won
driving. Then Rev Hooker, at odds of 8
to 1, finished in front of a big gathering
of two-year-olds. With as good as 40 to
1 against his chances, imp. Mistral an
nexed the fourth race, and in a hair
raising drive Morellito next put it on
Odds On a nose at odds of 10 to 1. In the
wind-up Valencienne was led out by the
second choice, St. Calatiner The winners
were not all neglected by bettors, still the
books profited most by the defeat of the
favorites.
The Morelllito-Odds On finish aroused
more enthusiasm than all of the other
finishes combined. The pair came to
gether in the fifth race of the day over a
mile, with San Venado, Twinkler and
Missioner as the other contenders. Odds
On was peppered as a good thing, going
to the post all to 10 choice. San Venado
was next in demand, while Morellito,
j with a lad named Garrigan in the saddle,
! was as good as 10 to 1. San Venado made
! all the running, with the favorite back in
i the bunch under wraps. When the
stretch was reached all cut loose, and a
furious drive ensued to the wire. Up to
within thirty yards of the finishing post
the favorite looked a winner. At this
junctiure Garrigan got up with Morellito
and gained thÂ« decision by a short nose.
Sandwiched between the pair San Venado
was beaten but half a length.
('.â¢lusii waa the pick of the crowd for
the opening scramble, but has none of her
old-time Bpeed, and was unplaced. Sen
ator Morrill was first into the stretch,
where he was passed by Mike Rice. In a
hard drive the latter led The Dragon out
a head.
In the four furlong dash for maiden
two-year-olds RÂ»-y Hooker won from the
30 to 1 shot Flamaro, with Enos looking
back at the end. Master Lee. the favor
ite, showed no speed whatever.
The four and a half furlong sprint for
two-year-olds went to the favorite, Ex
cursion. Thorpe made all the running
with the brown colt, and ridden out at
the wire finished over a length in front of
El Mido, the second choice.
The Baldwin stable furnished the fa
vorite for the s<'ven furlong event in Ber
nadlllo, with the customary result. By
dint of hard riding Piggott managed to
land him in fourth place. O'Conn-11 held
the lead to the stretch, whore he "blew
up." Finishing next tne rail. McDonald
got home first, with imp. Mistral, which
downed Dolore, another rank outsider,
two lengths. San Mateo was a good
third.
The speedy Valencienne was backed to
a standstill to win the final live furlong
spin, but was beaten out easily by St.
Calatine, the second choice.
TRACK NOTES.
Tommy Keating and Andy McDowell
leave here on Tuesday next with two se
lect strings of trotters and pacers to take
part in the big meeting to be held at
Denver next month.
Miss Ruth, at odds of 100 to 1, finished
a close fourth in the opening event. She
was well ridden by a little fellow named
O'Nell.
Mahogany received considerable back*
ing to win the race in which he was a
starter. The gelding was either short or
else McDonald, his rider, did riot like him.
By Holly will take a Dig string of six
teen horses to Montana, Fourteen of the
lot will be raced at the Denver meet.
Piggott's ride on Midas in the first race
was a very tame exhibition. He made a
strenuous effort when it was too late.
Don Cameron evidently has a handy
piece of racing material in the Flambeau
two-year-old Flaniii.ro. It was the young
ster's initial start, and he finished like a
good o;ie. The stable backed him "on
the limb." , â 
The books chalked Id to 1 against Mor
relito in the first betting, bu f took very
little coin at that price. Woods managed
to get the Morello colt cut off soon after
the barrier was released, and he was un
placed at the wire, though making a very
good showing.
Garnet Ferguson says his St. George
youngster, Master Lee, is "Hawkins'
horse" in the morning, but that earning
his oats is not his game.
On Thursday imp. Mistral finished third
in a race, with the ring laying 40 to 1
against his chances. Yesterday he won
with something to spare at the end.
The fast Nomad filly Toluca, formerly
owned and trained by "Bill" Murray, is
now the property of Sam Hildreth, and
should be heard from around Chicago the
coming summer.
It looks now as If six funongs was
about as far as O'Connell cared to carry
his largo bundle of speed; at least, his
last two races have indicated as much.
The old fellow was well supported yester
day, but passed it up in the run to the i
wire.
After St. Calatine had won the final
race on the card, entered to be sold for
$500, she was bid up to $1000 by By Holly.
The latter then stopped, and Sam Hil
dreth bid $50 more, at which ligure the
"iill v was knocked down to him. J. Mc-
Sweeny, the rightful owner of the fast
filly, It is said, will protest the whole
proceedings, and if rumor has it right,
the California Jockey Club, if it offers
any protection whatever to California
owners, should thoroughly investigate the
affair. It appears that McSweony was in
debt to P. G. Lynch, the owner of a
boarding-house near the track, and that
the former. In order to rid himself of the
indebtedness, turned the filly over to
Lynch for a spt.viiied time, until the
amount owed was paid. Sam Hildreth
trained the animal. On Tuesday last she
won a selling race and escaped a run up. i
Previous to yesterday's race Hildreth was !
given an Inkling that if the filly won she !
would receive a "boost" as she was en
tered at suph a ridiculously low price.
He did not scratch, and, curiously
enough, now owns the mare.

FOR HOME INDUSTRY.
Capital and Labor Join Hands to
Protect the Marble Trade.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council Thursday the matter of the large
Importations of marble from Europe and
the East which Is playing such havoc
with the local industry- was brought up
by the delegates from the Marble Cut
ters' Union. The committee reported that
it had held several conferences with arci
ftects, and many of them promised to
specify that only marble cut in this State
be used in the construction of any build
ings they are interested in. The council
will use all the means in its power to
keep the marble industry here, as will
also the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association.
This will affect only the polished
marble used In the Interior of build
lng-s, but there is also a great deal or
polished marble used in other ways, such
as headstones and monuments, overwhicn
these organizations can have little con
trol, and an appeal to the public is the
only means of localizing this branch of
the trade. During the past year shipments
of headstones aggregating thousands of
dollars in value have been received from
European ports, cut, polished and needing
only to be lettered. This work. It is
claimed by the marble men, could be done
just as well In this city and almost as
cheaply, if they could only once get the
run of the trade. As it is many of them
have ;~eir yards full of stones cut when
work was a little slack to keep the men
busy These are at present just so much
useiess material, as people seem to pre
fer to buy goods bearing a foreign stamp,
if for no other reason than that the for
eign stamp is there. Many good workmen
have already left the city and more are
planning to go if they cannot be guar
anteed steady work.
THE IRISH FAIR.

tions.

Union met Thursday in the permanent

member and also president of the fair.
Louis W. Buckley was engaged as man
ager and the names of fifty prominent
citizens, as an honorary advisory board,
were selected, and they will be invited
to serve thereon. The names of hfty
ladiea as an auxiliary committee were
selected, and they will also be asked to
h.-lp make this Irish Fair a financial and
social success. That it will attract society
is undeniable. Many advance subscrip
tions were pledged and arrangements for
booths were made. The committee will
meet again Monday^

M I work steadily all day in a downtown office in New York.
Often, when I get through at night, I am tired and faint at my
stomach. I suppose my stomach is tired too. Anyway I feel
hungry and I am apt to eat too much supper, and the conse
quence is I frequently used to have a bad stomach all night
and a head on me the next morning. But I have lately found
that if I take a
after my supper, it digests all right. Whenever my stomach
has .extra work to do, the Tabule takes hold and helps like

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 6âThere were striking
elements of strength in to-day's stock market
notwithstanding the fact that most of the day's
changes are on the Bide of losses. The bull
sentiment has several severe drawbacks to
contend with, and the selling pressure on the '
market was at times very heavy. Again and
again the buying demand was sufficient to
overcome all obstacles and to absorb all of
ferings, carrying prices upward on a large vol
ume of business. It was not until the final
hour that the market finally succumbed to the
burden of liquidation and yielded practically
all earlier gains and established losses ranging
up to 2 per cent in some of the specialties.
American stocks were heavy in London before
the opening here In sympathy with a general
depression in that market. Although prices
of International stocks had declined to in some
cases nearly a point below last night's New
York closing, there was sufficient demand here
at the opening to overcome the greater part of
London's declines. By establishing a range of
prices here above the London parity arbitrage
selling was made profitable and inviting. The
soiling for London account was the heaviest
for many weeks and was estimated at 50 0&0
shares at least. The dragging tendency of this
selling was easily perceptible in the interna
tional stocks during the morning. But the bal
ance of the list showed a disposition to forge
ahead on its own account. Some of the spe
cialties were conspicuously strong, notably To
bacco. The market showed a tendency late in
the day to rally strongly on a report that the
cable communication had been established with
Manila and Commodore Dewey. The - capture
of the steamer Lafayette under the French flag
assumed growing Importance in the eyes of
traders during the last hour and Induced sell
ing to realize, and the dealing of shorts by
bears which carried prices to the lowest of
the day at the close when the Belling movement
was soil actively in force.
The bond market showed the effect of sell
ing for London account in some of the specu
lative issues, as did the stock market. Other
wise the tone was strong and prices are gen
erally higher. Total sales, $2,450,000.
United States new 4s (registered) and the
Did 4s (coupon) advanced % per cent, and the
new 4b (coupon), the old 4s (registered) and
the 5s *4 per cent In the bid price. There
were sales of the old 4s (registered) at an ad
vance of,l*i per cent over the last sale.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, May 6.â The Evening- Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock

about Â£3,000,000 from the Bank of England.
Americans were good and were bought spee
ulatively. They closed steady.

Greek loan, guaranteed by England, Franco
an.l Russia. It is a 2\ 2 per cent loan and the

definitely arranged, subject to certain conces

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, May Foreign news available
at to-day's opening of the wheat market was
all of a bullish character. Liverpool recorded
| advances of Â£d for May down to 2d in Septem
i ber option. Paris rose the equivalent of 23Â»o;
! Antwerp. l%c. Mark Lake reported gains of
! 9c per bushel since Wednesday's market.
! The opening trades In July, regardless of for
! eign advances, were at $I@l 00%, a decline
1 of 1%@2%e. . May started at Jl 46@1 47, a drop
! of 3@4c. These losses were entirely attributa
i ble to pit conditions. Scattering longs wanted
I to realize and found a concession necessary.
But the market soon began -to give symptoms
of recovery. Before the end of an hour's trad-
Ing early sellers were on the run, and July
| had sold up to $1 02. Domestic statistics were
!of no significance except that primary re
ceipts offered little Indication of ' supply | ex
haustion, and encouraged short selling of dis
tant futures. - Hesitancy in this market appar
ently affected the foreigners, and Liverpool
eased oft until at ' the close net gains there
were limited to 2%d in July.
Strong outside markets kept the Chicago pit
traders nervous and fluctuations were violent
over a narrow range. July made a top figure
with $102%, after which it slipped again to
$1 00%. recovered to $1 01%, and was at 12
o'clock quiet for a while around $1 01% and
$1 01%. â¢ September during the same time rose
from 83% to 84c, back to 83% c, up to 85c, and
down again to 84c. May, on light demand, re
acted from $1 40, where it remained listlessly
for the first, two hours, to $1 50. Leiter satis
fied the first demand at $1 60 and the close was
at $1 49% bid. July eased off to $1 00%. rallied
to $1 01, closing at $1 01 sellers. Leiter reported
sales of 275,000 bushels, half of it for export.
Foreigners, he said, had not responded' to . the
advances made last night. Engagements were
made by Lelter at the . seaboard for â 'â  twenty
two steamers, with a carrying capacity of four
million bushels for May and June Bailings.
Corn opened weak and .lc . lower with wheat.

LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON, May 6.â The wool sales were con
tinued to-day with a full attendance. ThÂ»
offerings number 12,650 bales. Including much
low class wool, which received little support
and was withdrawn. Good greasy merinos
were taken at about the prices of the last sale.
I Foreigners competed strongly for this wool. A
I good selection of scoured was also strongly
competed for by the foreign representatives
and the home trade.
! The latter secured a fair proportion with har
dening rates. Following are the sales in de

BOSTON, May The Boston Commercial
Bulletin will say to-morrow of the wool mar

The easiness of money and the stir In manu
facturing circles occasioned by Government de
mands have had a reviving influence for the
moment on the languid market. An actual
business developed in medium unwashed fleeces,
one-half bloods and better. Under the sem
blance of activity views have assumed an ap
preciable gain In firmness and prices have held
very well.
Tne sales of the week are 745,000 pounds do
mestic and 245,000 pounds foreign, against 410.
000 pounds domestic and 677.000 pounds foreign
last week, and 1,262,600 pounds domestic and

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, May 6.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say -to-morrow:
â¢ A â¢ state , of war was *bo . greatly dreaded <by
'those who have seen nothing like it for more
than.thirty years that its coming. has hurt less
than its apprehension. Especially, since the
victory at Manila, which indicated the superi
ority of the American navy, gun for gun, ex
pectations that the war will not last long have
influenced all markets, and stocks : have ad
vanced, the average rise . for/ railroads - being
$2 70 per share. The general condition of busi
ness has been materially improved. : One day's
work , by/; the I officers and â  men at Manila has
given many days' work to thousands of peo
ple of whom" they knew nothing and has placed
all American industries ;â¢ and â , interests :on>' a
stronger i footing ; for., any conceivable : future.
The I fact that , gold is now - used almost ' ex
clusively : between \ the i treasury i and . the â¢ clear
i lnr-bouse Indicates tbe entire freedom from ap
prehension about the currency or public credit.
The most sensational of all changes and the
most practically important has been the rise in
wheatâ l 3 cents during one day's session. 21%
cents from Tuesday to Thursday night and
25 l ,4 cents for the weekâ throwing into the shade |
all past advances and all expectations, though |
a reaction of IVi cents naturally followed on
Friday.
Western receipts, after averaging less than
2,500,000 bushels per week for four months, have
suddenly risen to more than 3.j00.000 bushels. |
Exports have not been checked by higher prices
as yet, but have caused them, amounting for
the week to 2,094,3*0 bushels I flour included I,
against 1,498,167 bushels from Atlantic ports ;
last year, and 559.848 bushels against 99.508 |
bushels from Pacific ports The remarkable, j
rise on Thursday was largely due to the re
moval of duties by France and to the prohibl- j
tion of exports by Russia, both showing the
extraordinary needs abroad, SO that the rise of ]
25^ cents for the week is not without excuse.
Industries have received a wonderful stimu
lus from the conviction that hostilities will not
last long and from heavy Government orders, i
Besides the great demand for steel plates and
other iron products and ammunition the Gov
eminent has ordered 2 500 000 yards of woolen I
cloths. 125,000 blankets, 8,000.000 yards of cotton
goods and great quantities of provisions and
other supplies, and meanwhile reviving conn
dence has multiplied other demands. It is not
due to domestic conditions that orders of the
Russian Government for two big warships have
been taken by the Cramps and orders for rails ;
from Mexico have given a good start to the f
rebuilt Colorado works. Four large merchant :
ships have been ordered from the Delaware
works, plate mills are crowded and at inâ¢
same time one establishment far in the interior
|s Lidding on foreign orders for 6000 tons,
while car and rail works continue to receive
large orders and demands for agricultural im
plements and fencing goods beyond the aniiip
of the works in some cases. Textile establish
ments have been receiving large orders within
the past few days outside those from thÂ° (tO^
ernment. so that the stoppage or reduction or
time in four woolen mills early In the wee>.
have been premature. . . . â_,,
Wool has declined about half a cent in April,
taking the average of one hundred quotations
by Coats Brothers, and the bette. demand for
goods has caused more inquiry, but thus iar
no improvement in prices. .
Failures for the week have been 238 In tne
fnlted States against 221 lart year, and 25 In
Canada against 36 last year.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 6.â Bradstreet'u Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Lat week's ex
treme dullness has given place to an active
speculation, the feature of which was the re
newed purchasing of securities. The mov^- I
ment began on Saturday, when, under pro- i
fessional leadership, the market showed con
siderable strength, and on Monday, when the
news of Commodore Dewey's victory at Manila i
was received, there was an influx of buying
both for long and short accounts. The move
ment was checked on Tuesday, more by the
fact that the next day was a holiday than by
the absence of further information from Ma
nila or by the lack of evidence to substan
tiate the belief that Spain had accepted the
lesson of her defeat â¢ and was willing to end
the war. It may also be noted that profes
sional interests, which bought stocks heavily
during the recent depression either because
they were cheap or to support their own specÂ»
ialtles, sold considerable amounts, and that
London marketed considerable holdings on !
Tuesday.-
On Wednesday, however, London contributed I
to a renewal of the rise by taking a round '
amount of stocks, while the local shorts cov
ered to such an extent that the borrow!"? de
mand for stocks for delivery was materially
reduced, and commission, houses In most cases
reported a decided accession to outside buying
orders. Increased activity was accompanied i
by a general advance .throughout, the. list, the
only tangible reason, . apart from the growing
belief that Spain is clearly outmatched by our
navy, being the evidence that her internal po
litical and financial troubles render a further
6t Kg i e on ncr P art absolutely hopeless.
The fall of Spanish fours to below 30, the rise
or the gold premium at Madrid, from 60 to 114
and the run on the Bank of Spain and other
institutions were considered a . justification of
this view.
BRADSTREETS REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 6.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Evidences accumulat.: that the
corner has finally been turned In the trade
situation, and that circumstances which have
hitherto been regarded as disquieting have be
gun to give way to more cheerful conditions or
are beginning to be recognized in a truer and
more reasonable light. White it Ifl claimed,
and perhaps with Justice in many cases, that
the changes yet noted are largely sentimental,
and little that is tangible is to be cited in the
direction of improvement, it is not to be for
gotten that the dullness and even depression
ruling for some time past was likewise largely
sentimental and it is now beginning to be ad
mitted by many had even less of a basis to
rest upon than the present unmistakable signs
of Improvement. A new sense of national
strength and energy seems unquestionably to
have developed since the news of the American
victory at Manila, and the business community
generally, with a few exceptions, would ap
pear to have come to the conclusion that the
possible effects of the present war have been
already well discounted.
Among thn more favorable features of the
week have been the slightly easier tone in th*
money market and a little more disposition on*
the part of financial institutions to accommo
date legitimate demands of trade. Another has
been the very general feeling of recognition of
the critical position of wheat supplies in the
lowering or the suspension entirely of import
wheat duties, notably in Italy, France and
Spain, and reflected in advances proportionate
to the import duty reduction in those countries.
Prices, both at the seaboard and at the in
terior, have broken all records for many years
past, while the eagerness of foreign buyers
to take hold at the advances furnishes tstl
mony to the fact that the present wheat cor
ner is not due entirely to the fear of inter
ruptions in supplies, nor yet to the successful
projection of a wheat corner, but to a con
siderable extent to foreign recognition of the
fact that the world's wheat stocks to-day are
smaller than they have been lor xuany years
past, and that some time must yet elapse he
fore the admittedly good world's wheat crop
prospects find expression in new supplies.
Of considerable importance In the direction of
actually stimulating business in some lines are
the large orders received for equipment and
supplies of all sorts for military use. notably
in the lines of cotton and woolen goods, shoes,
projectiles and ammunition of various sorts.
It, of course, would be useless to deny that
there are some unfavorable features in view,
notably in the cotton and woolen industry. In
the former print cloths have again struck the
lowest price on record, with a quotation of
1 15-16 C for standard grades, and the woolen
manufacturing Industry is. as a whole re
ported quite depressed. In contrast with these
reports, chiefly coming from the Eastern and
Middle States' cities, aro the sales of a con
siderable quantity of raw wool, said to be
for the manufacture of goods ordered by the
The wheat exports for the week reflect the
temporary check to the demand caused by the
sudden advances in price and now show a fall
ing off. aggregating 2.478.775 bushels, against
4,449,0.0 bushels last week. 1.799. bushels in
this week a year ago, 1.892,000 bushels in IMb.
and 2,805,000 bushels In 1595. *
Corn exports are larger this week than for
more than a year past, aggregating 6.164,000
bushels, against 4,316,000 bushels last week,
3.127.000 bushels in this week a year ago, 1.M1.
000 bushels in 1896, and 934.000 bushels in 18*.
Business failures are slightly smaller this
week, aggregating for the United States 240.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been two Coal deliveries from
Washington with 5700 tons; two from Oregon.
1060 tons: one from British Columbia, 5409
tons; two from Australia, 3638 tons; total,
15.867 tons. The arrivals of this week are
light, less than half the quantity delivered
here last week ; there are a large number of
vessels overdue, which are Coal laden still we
are not in want of coal at present, there being
ample here in yard for all immediate demands,
and our largest consumers are all supplied for
the moment. The only fear is for the future,
say six months hence, unless the coast col
lieries will increase their output and become
more generous shippers here, as our foreign
sources of coal supplies will become scant,
and will form a very small quota of our ac
tual consumption. In the meantime prices are
advancing so as to keep in line with Coal
freights this way. which are climbing very
| fast. This of course was assured as our
Grain shipments this year will be compara
tively nil. hence foreign vessels must be paid
generously to transport coal, with no business
in view for them after arrival here.
"We are promised shipments of â¢Corrimal' j
Coke from Australia in the near future, the
samples of same are at hand, and Its appear
ance and -analysis . would indicate - its .availa
bility for all smelting purposes. Rumors are
broadcast about large purchases of coal, mak

have yet to be verified."

A LONG WALK
FOR A WAGER
Assemblyman Brierling
Is Sure His Money
Is Safe.
His Butcher Boy Will Tramp
Fifty Miles After His
Day's Work.
The Route Is From San Jose Court
house to Oakland's City
Hall.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 6.
If Richard Gorman of West Oakland
ran walk from San Jose to Oakland in
twenty-four hours Assemblyman Oscar
Brierling will lose $50.
Gorman is employed by the Assembly
man, who is a butcher, and who has a
great love for sport. It is a very com
mon thing for the master and employe to
argue over possible feats of endurance
and skill, and a few days ago Gorman
said it would be an easy matter after his
day's work was done to walk fifty miles.
Brierling denied that such a thing could
be done, except by a man who trained
specially for such an exhibition of en
durance. Gorman has always been a
great walker, and has great confidence
in his own endurance. He repeated his
statement, and Brierling finally said:
"I'll bet $50 you can't do it."
"Done," cried the butcher boy, and the
bargain was sealed.
To-morrow evening after the butcher
shop has closed and after Gorman has
done his full share of Saturday's work he
will go down to San Jose on the train.
He will be accompanied by the Assembly
man's brother, and the race is to start
from the front of the Courthouse at San
Jose. Mr. Brierling will take things easy
with a wheel or in a buggy, and Gorman
will ride shank's mare.
The agreement calls for a continuous
walk, and the contest is to end in front
<>:" the Oakland City Hall within twenty
four hours of the time of starting. Gor
man is confident of his ability to win the
v â _ -. a id Assemblyman Brierling is as
positive that he will give up and will have
to be driven the latter part Of the dis
tance. He declares that to walk fifty
miles after a hard day's work is not pos
sible.
West Oakland is greatly interested in
the result, and bulletins are to be tele
phoned to Oakland as often as possible
en route.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
TOO ANXIOUS
FOR A WIFE
Young Sexton Swore He
"Was Over Twenty-
One.
Oakland Keeps Up a Record
for Quiet Little Elope
ments.
His Father Filea a Suit for an An
nulment of the Mar
riage.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 6.
Patrick A. Sexton, a lad 19 years of age,
is sorry that he eloped last Thanksgiving,
and his father, as his guardian, wants
the marriage- annulled.
The latter part of last November young
Sexton, accompanied by a pretty girl, ap
plied to Clerk Ewing for a marriage li
cense. The clerk asked the uoy if he
knew his age sufficiently well to swear
to it, and Sexton wius positive that he was
born more than twenty-one years ago, and
he took the oath to that effect.
As the young lady did not appear any
too old to wear short frocks, the clerk
made some inquiry of the young man, and
he swore that she was over 18. The license
wan issued, and an hour later Miss Em
elie Hemple was the wife of Patrick A.
Sexton.
They took no one into their confidence
for some time, but finally the news of the
elopement leaked out. Sexton's father
was very much annoyed over the affair,
and it is* now stated that the young folks
never lived together as husband and wife.
This afternoon Mr. Sexton Sr., as guar
dian of his son, tiled an action seeking the
annulment uf the marriage on the ground
that at the time it occurred the lad was
not 19 years old and could not legally
marry. The father swears that the son's
age is known to him and that he will not
ue 21 for nearly two years.
The complaint is rather an unusual one,
as it places the boy's father in the posi
tion of swearing to a complaint that is
indirectly a charge of perjury against the
son. Young Sexton Is not at home at
present, and it is not known whether the
case will be contested or not. Mrs. Sex
ton is living in Oakland, but very few of
her friends know of the Thanksgiving
elopement, as it has never been openly
announced.

CHILDREN HAVE A MERRY TIME.
Ponies. Dogs and Monkeys Afford the Little Ones
Much Amusement,
Dog and pony shows are not affairs to
go irfto rhapsodies over, but the man who
doesn't find pleasure In the tricks and
antics of such intelligent animals as Pro
fessor Norris has in his charge must be
indeed blase.
The performance is under the direction
of Andrew Norris. He must have a
wonderful faculty for teaching horses,
dogs, monkeys and goats, for the animals
that took part in the show in Central
Park last night seemed to be "letter per
fect" from start to finish. There was not
an act from the beginning to the end that
did not command close attention, and
some of the special features were so good
as to warrant detailed description.
There was a military drill by eight
Shetland ponies, and then came a rep
resentation of a minstrel first part, in
which thirty dogs participated. The dogs
did some great tricks in lieu of cracking
jokes. Next there was a game of see-saw
by ponies, after which there were a revolv
ing pyramid and a revolving tableau by
ponies and dogs.
It was the "business" of one of the
dogs in the act that followed the tableau
to be a "hard case." He played the part
admirably, and as a result a miniature
police patrol-wagon, drawn by a dwarf
among ponies, driven by a midget, and
with the funniest little monkey you ever
saw, dressed up in police garb, dashed
into the ring. The monkey policeman
jumped down from the "hurry up" wagon,
seized the recalcitrant dog by the collar,
waved a club just as a "cop" would and
then hustled the bad dog into the vehicle
and away the wagon dashed again.

Confederate Bill Swindler.
ALAMEDA, May 6.â William Williams,
the confederate of Sloan in passing coun
terfeit bills, was on trial to-day before
Justice Morris in this city, on a charge of
petty larceny. The woman whom he was
charged with robbing was not positive in
her identification, and the case was taken
under advisement. Sloan is already serv
ing a six months' sentence in the County
Jail, but it is believed Williams will
escape, owing to the uncertainty of iden
tification.
A Female Thief.
ALAMEDA, May 6.â A well-dressed
woman called at the residence of T. P.
Dickinson yesterday afternoon on the pre
tense of desiring to rent it. Mr. Dickin
son was alone in the house at the time,
and while the woman thought he was not
looking she pocketed some valuable man
tel ornaments. He caught her in the act
and made her disgorge, aad then, instead
of notifying the police, ordered her out
of the house and told her that If she did
not leave the city at once he would have
her arrested.

Burnham Able to Go Home.
OAKLAND, May 6.â Walter Burnham,
the son of the late O. H. Burnham, who
shot himself yesterday morning, was so
much Improved to-day that he was able
to go home unattended. Wednesday night
he drank heavily and was the worse for
wear yesterday morning when he entered
the blacksmith shop of Hurry Wilson on
Eleventh street. He flred at his head,
and the bullet struck the right side, tear
ing a furrow several inches in length. No
bones were broken, but he evidently
thought he hud done a good job, for he
remarked when found, "Good-hy; I am
going." The only other message he had
for his friends was, "Oh, don't tell mother
about it." He was treated at the Re
ceiving Hospital and kept strapped to the
bed until to-day.
Gin Gum Convicted of Forgery.
OAKLAND, May 6.â Gin Gum was sen
tenced to Pan Quentin to-day for forgery.
li.' whs convicted late last night after the

long ago Mrs. Hale, wife of the Prison

she will be surprised to rm-et him so soon.

A very intelligent pony named Rose-,
bery answered a variety of questions pro
pounded by Professor Norrls, and finished
his act by getting a whisk-broom from a
desk and dusting his master's clothes,
just as a valet would.
Then there appeared the fattest kind of
a nanny gr>at called Trilby, who walked
the tightrope with a monkey riding bare
back on her.
There was skipping the rope by a pony,
by dogs and by Mr. Norris and dogs to
gether.
All the riding acts were eclipsed by the
champion bounding jockey of the world.
"Jim Robinson." a large monkey, at- !
tired in tights, blouse and can. Jim rides
standing erect on his hind feet, and to
jump over banners or throw back somer
saults while his pony is going at full
speed is mere pastime for him.
The entertainment concluded with a
very exciting fire scene. A small cottage,
in which the McGlnty family reside,
caught fire, and the alarm was turned In.
A moment later the animal fire depart
ment came dashing in at breakneck
speed. The hook ami ladder truck, drawn
by ponies and manned by dogs, was the
first to arrive. Ladders were placed
against the sides of the building, and the
dogs climbed to the second story windows
and entered among the flames and smoke,
returning with smaller dogs in their
mouths. They aJso carried out the furni
ture. By this time the hose-wagon had
arrived, and a huge monkey ran up a
ladder with the hose and directed a
stream of water on to the flames until
they were quenched. Only those who
know how difficult it is to get a dog into
fire can appreciate how marvelously well
trained are these dogs.
The show is advertised as moral and
clean. It is not only that, but is highly
entertaining.
PEACE OVERTURES
WERE REFUSED
A Bitter War Now Going On
Among the Children of
Adolph Sutro.
Dissension Over tho Removal of the
Aged Millionaire From His
Home.
Dr. Emma Sutro-Merritt made overtures
for peace to her sister. Miss Clara Sutro>
yesterday morning, but she was repulsed
with scorn. The family of the aged mil
lionaire and philanthropist is divided and
the breach promises to become wider
when the promised battle in the courts
is opened.
Dr. Emma Sutro-Merritt. the elder sister
and legal guardian of her father, called at
the cozy home of the ex-Mayor at the
Heights with the olive branch of peace,
but Miss Clara Sutro bluntly refused to
receive it and decliued to be reconciled
while her father was kept away from the
home he built and where he hoped to
spend in peace the declining years of his
eventful life. Mrs. Merritt was scored in
no unmistakable terms for forcibly car
rying- the ill and imbecile old man away
to a strange hearth when only a few days
remained for him on this earth. Charles
Sutro, a son of the man who made the
Comstock famous, was present during the
interview between the sisters, and ho
took sides against the woman who took
the old man from his home when death
was beckoning him.
Neverthless, Dr. Sutro-Merritt main
tained that she was wholly within her
rights and was consulting her father's
best interests in removing him to her
home. She advanced the fact of her hus
band's illness from asthma as an addi
tional reason for having her father close
at hand. Her sister and brother were,
however, not satisfied and shortly after
loft the house for the city whither DÂ£
Merritt soon followed them.
Attorney Reuben Lloyd was yesterday
engaged in considering the legal aspects
of the case from the standpoint of Miss
Clara Sutro and h^r brother.
SALOONS AND
RUM SELLERS
A Rumpus Combination That
Means Death to Civili-
zation.
Missionary Congress of the Califoi
Woman's Christian Temper
ance Union.
A reception to commemorate the return
of Mies Jessie Ackerman, generally
known as the "around the world mission
ary," was held at Calvary Presbyterian
Church yesterday under the auspices of
the California Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union. Delegates and repre
sentative ministers from all parts of the
State were in attendance, and many elo
quent addresses on the subject of intem
perance, its baneful effects in retarding
the growth of civilization and preventing
the spread and dissemination of Christian
doctrine in the heathen world were
given.
The congress was formally opened with
divine services at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing by Mrs. Mary Case Lord of Pasadena,
and it continued in session the entire day,
closing with a special programme in the
evening.
Among the prominent speakers of the
afternoon were Rev. George C. Adams,
Rev. E. S. Chapman, Rev. S. S. Cryor and
Miss Ackerman.
The prevailing topic upon which the
several addresses were based was intem
perance and the appalling result of the
liquor traffic.
Rev. E. S. Chapman spoke of the curse
of liquor as the greatest retarding influ
ence that modern civilization had, and
maintained that the nation, unless it
stopped the continual demoralizing influ
ence, would reap a whirlwind for its neg
ligence.
"The $4,000,000 that is spent annually in
California for rum," said the preacher,
"is the life blood of the State, and the
$120,000,000 that is expended by the coun
try, taken as a whole, represents the
gradual decay of the nation. Rum para
lyzes the church and places a ban upon
every branch of civilization. God cannot j
afford to multiply his church until we
wash our hands of this unholy curse. The
greatest evil to the church and the world
to-day is th^> saloon, and if we hope to
perpetuate our nation and our people we
must protect the present generation and
the generations to come by organizing a
movement that, if it does not succeeed in
blotting out the stain of intemperance en
tirely, will, however, lessen its ravages
and attendant horrors. To commence this
work of instituting the white banner in
every civilized community in the country
we have to first raise it heÂ»e in this city,
because we cannot hope to meet success
by looking elsewhere and depending upon
others."

JEFFRIES GETS THE
DECISION BUT FAILS
TO STOP THE SAILOR
Not a Great Battle From a Scientific
View, but Exciting Enough for the
Thousands Who Attended.
Flimsily Constructed Seats Give Way During the
Show and Hurl Hundreds of Helpless Spec
tators to the Floor, Injuring Many.
The criminal carelessness of a contractor and the National Athletic Club, as well as the indifference
and incompetence of an official of the Fire Department, came near turning the Pavilion into a scene of
death and disaster last night, instead of having it an arena for the aggrandizement of a pair of pillowed
bullies and the edification of a frenzied crowd.
Tom Sharkey and Jim Jeffries were pitted to figkt a twenty-round contest. They are both known
to*f ollowers of prize-fights as "sloggers," and the doors of the great building were hardly large enough
to let the crowds in fast enough to witness the exhibition. Seats for the crowd were constructed on
platforms, tier above tier, and arrangements had been made for seating 10,000 people. Long before
the preliminary exhibition fights were called every seat ow the lower floor was crowded, and on some two
men were clinging. The master of ceremonies had stepped into the ring to announce the first contest,
when there came a sound of cracking timbers followed almost instantly by a roar as of thunder, above
which could be heard cries and curses of injured and angry men. A tier of about a dozen seats along
the Polk street end of the building had fallen, carrying with it about 500 men. Instantly there was a stam
pede in the great building. Men began rushing in all directions and hundreds of them crushed their way
out through the crowd at the door and sought safety in the street. The Larkin street end of the build
ing was obscured in a cloud of dust. In the midst of the confusion there came another crash from
the midst of the dust cloud, and another section of the seats went down. Hardly had the sound of the
breaking timbers died away when the remaining section of the platform gave way.
Nearly 2000 men were scrambling, cursing and fighting in that cloud of dust, and in the confused
seaÂ»of broken timbers and chairs. Several were injured, and for a few minutes there was a stream of the
wounded, assisted by friends, on the way to the Receiving Hospital.
It took some time to get order out of the confusion and start the show again. The lightweights
were introduced to the great audience, and they danced at each other for a round or two when there
came the same warning sounds from beneath the seats along the Larkin street side of the building. The
seats nearest the ring went first, and tier by tier they went crashing to the floor beneath. In an instant
2000 more men were scrambling amid the wreckage, fighting and cursing and groaning in their agony
from their injuries and obscured from the rest of the audience in a cloud of dust. Again there was a
stream of injured to the Receiving Hospital. In that crash the bandsmen were among those who went
down. For a while it was thought the great contest would be called off and the crowd dismissed fearing
more and greater disasters from the insecure seats. Finally, however, order was in a measure restored
and the fights went on. Stelzner and Baker were called to the ring, and they had hardly taken their cor
ners when creaking timbers gave warning of yet another catastrophe. A section of the platform on
which the seats were placed at the Larkin and Grove street corner of the building began to topple over,
and down it went with a crash. Several hundred men were among the debris when the cloud of dust
cleared away, and again there was a procession of injured to the Receiving Hospital. Most of the in
juries were of 8 slight nature, though for the time painful. One man, however, received an injury to
his spine, and he may never fuliy recover. Several others were so injured that it may be days before they
will be able to attend to their regular duties.
Contractor Doran says he put up the platforms and the seats in a good workmanlike manner, and
according to the plans he prepared and had approved. They were, he says, calculated to hold anH seat
6000 on the main floor and 4000 in the gallery. Nearly twice that many were put on the platforms
and the timbers used were unable to hold the weight. District Fire Engineer O'Shaughnessy passed on
the platform and pronounced it sufficiently strong to hold the crowd that could get on it. He, however,
asked that a few more braces be put under it to make provision for emergencies. The braces were placed
according to his direction, but his judgment, according to the result, was at fault.
The managers of the club claim that tne contractor was not stinted in the cost of his work. Doran
replies to that by saying he had only a short time to do the work and the limit of the expense the club
would stand for the work was $1125.
A DECISION IN
TWENTY ROUNDS
The Southern California
Giant Bests the
Sailor.
Jim Jeffries, the powerful representa
tive of Southern California, received a
|decision In his favor last evening, ren
dered by Referee Alexander Greggains,
â¢after he had faced Tom Sharkey In a
! twenty-round contest.
The battle was not as interesting as
the majority of the spectators had ex
pected, owing to the fact that Jeffries
put a quietus on the sailor lad when
ever the latter attempted rushing and
pushing tactics, for which style of
fighting Sharkey has been noted.
It was in the second round, after
Sharkey had received a straight left on
the nose, that he attempted to intro
duce his favorite gameâ that of pushing
his adversary with his shoulder and
then dashing at him, swinging the left
and right at the head.
Just as soon as Sharkey bore In Jef
fries put his gloves on the Sailor's
shoulders and held him against the
ropes. Sharkey quickly came to the
conclusion that at rough work he had
an opponent who was his superior In
weight, and afterward he did not resort
to rushing and shoulder butting.
In the opening round Jeffries Immedi
ately assumed the aggressive and
forced Sharkey to dance around the
ring, but after considerable fiddling
and arm movements the Sailor was
first to lead with his left, but the blow
fell short. Jeffries then got Sharkey
Into a corner and landed lightly on
the neck. The Sailor, who was much
quicker on his feet than Jeffries, side
stepped at a time when Jeffries was in
the act of swinging his left, and then

moving up close he landed a good right
swing on Jeffries' jaw. The big fellow
smiled and made a wicked hook at
Sharkey, but the blow was very neatly
ducked.
In the second round Sharkey struck
at Jeffries in a clinch and was hooted
by the gallery. He had one arm free,
however and according to rule he had
the right to hit his opponent if he so
; pleased. Time and again Jeffries tried
I short-arm blows and hooks, but â¢ the
, sailor was too quick, and avoided pun
ishment by clever ducking. After a
. rally Sharkey swung his right for
Jeff's jaw and the blow came within an
i Inch of landing. He smiled as the gong
1 sounded for corners.
It was in the fourth round that Jef
fries took some of the fire out of Shar
key's attack by short-arm punches
which troubled Sharkey's ribs to no lit
i tie extent. One hard smash caused the
sailor to grunt, and he then wildly
rushed Jeffries, only to receive a left
stop in the nose. Jeffries swung his
left and right, and Sharkey ducked so
low as to almost scrape the floor with
his nose. After a rally in which no
damage was done, Sharkey turned to
his seconds and Bald, "Why, he's easy";
i but scarcely had the words been spok
en when Jeffries' left fist landed on
! Tom's neck, and the sailor retreated
; quickly, Jeffries falling to follow up a
good opportunity that Sharkey left for
a smash in the stomach.
In the fifth round Jeffries proved that
! his blows were dangerous. A right
swing landed on Sharkey's arm and the
force of the blow sent the sailor stag-
I gering against a post. Jeffries, whether
1 it was because he did not desire to take
the least chance of being bit in the face
or was obeying instructions, failed time
I and again to follow up his game and
| especially was this noticeable when he
| had Sharkey in a corner under his
i wing, so to speak. Each time that
! Sharkey ducked under Jeffries' left arm
whenever Jeffries attempted to hook
â  him in the neck Sharkey would smile
and pass some remark, but during the
I last rounds of the fight Jeffries stopped
I the sailor's artful ducking by sending
a straight right into Sharkey's ribs.
In the seventh round some hot fight
ing resulted at close range, and in a
rally near the ropes Sharkey made a
wild rush, swinging right and left at-
Jeffries' head. The latter backed away
but ;he sailor was on top of him in a
jiffy and Jeffries was sent through the
ropes and came within an ace of falling
to the floor.
It was expected that the contest
I would terminate before the tenth
I round, but the sailor, who was much
; quicker on his feet than Jeffries, man
! aged by ducking and clinching to
! avoid punishment.
Jeffries fought a very slow and care
; ful fight, but he left his face ungarded
and Sharkey found little difficulty in
reaching it with straight blows, but the
sailor wanted to land a swing, which
blow Jeffries looked out for.
Jeffries invariably telegraphed his
blows. Before hitting he would pull
his arm back and Sharkey made ready
to duck. The only hard blows that
were landed were delivered at close
ranere, and the sailor must have a sore
left side this morning. Still, Jeffries
received his share of punishment in the
face. One or two blows that Sharkey
landed on Jeffries' mouth and nose
must have bothered tl c receiver.
The fight waa not very interesting
from the fact that both men resorted
THE PAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 7, 1898.
to round-arm blows and swings in the
hope .of scoring a knockout. There
were very few straight* blows landed.
Jeffries should , have whipped Sharkey
in one or two rounds during the con
test when the sailor was groggy from
blows he received- in the head. -
Fitzsimmons can whip Jeffries easily,
and will certainly do so if they ; ever
meet. : >~~-~Â£r- : -. â¢ - â¢ ,â â â¢â 
Although Greggains gave the decision
at the end of the twentieth round in
favor of Jeffries, there were many of
the spectators who said that a draw,
would have been proper
The preliminary event was to be a ten
round go , between two. light heavy
weights of local fame, Jack Stelzner and
Henry Baker. Stelzner was the taller
and heavier of the two, and was the fa
vorite in the betting at 2 to 1.- Baker put
up an aggressive fight and took some
grueling punishment from Stelzner's
straight lefts. In the sixth round Stelz
ner. who had been warned before, fouled

MY VIEW OF
THE BIG FIGHT
BY JOE CORBETT.
Tom Sharkey and Jim Jeffries engaged
according to schedule in a twenty-round
boxing match at Mechanics" Pavilion,
and Jeffries, the "pride of California,"
was awarded the decision.
The crowds began to congregate in
front of the various entrances hours be
fore the time set for the doors to be
opened, little dreaming, as they merrily
chatted as to the probable result of the
light, that death under crashing lumber

Were Seated.
and falling humanity might be their fate.
it Is needless to say that if every one in
that vast audience could have foretold
what was in store for him, Sharkey and
Jeffries would have settled their cham
pionship aspirations before iTiKK) vacant
seats. Such, however, is the uncertainty
of life.
Managers Groom and Gibbs, In antici
pation of the big crowd, bad made â¢ i:ti>
orate arrangements for their reception.
Carpenters had been very busy for the
two weeks building ti^r^ of seats at an
elevation, so that everybody, young and
old, could have a good view of the great
battle. The crowd, on entering the Pa
vilion, immediately settled In these ele
vated Beats, but "they were built in a
hurry and not strongly enough to hold
the imttifnso mass of people, who occu
pied every inch of available space, and.
consequently, came down with a dull
crash, carrying everything before and
upon them.
To describe the scene as T saw it is
beyond me, yet the picture of those peo
ple as they were hurled headlong to the
floor one, and in some places twenty, on
top of each other, amid an avalanche of
chairs and broken lumber, will live for
years and years to come. That no one
was killed outright is the greatest of
miracles, and ninny a day will < <>me and
go ere people will again allow themselves
to be caught like a rat in a trap.
The fight itself was a big disappoint
ment to many on account of its lasting
the twenty rounds, yet was as good a
fight as has been witnessed in California
for some time, barring the Walcott-La
vigne contest.
Both men fought very carefully during
the early stages of the fight, apparently
afraid to try the prowess of each other,
Jeffries, however, landing body punches
at intervals which hurt and finally won
for him the decision. He forced the fight
ing from start to finish, following Shar
key from one side of the ring to the
other, but was unable to land a knockout
punch, owing to Sharkey's quickness and
cleverness. He, however, kept trying,
mixing it up whenever Sharkey was so
disposed, his body punches having a ter
rible effect, especially in the last few
rounds, when he devoted most of his
time to that part of Sharkey's anatomy.
Jeffries 1 judgment of distance w.as very
poor, as was Sharkey's, punch after punch
cutting the air, but as Jeffries forced the
lighting, landed oftener and did more
damage, he deserved the decision, which
was a just one.
Sharkey, on the other hand, consider
ing the odds against him, fought a good
fight, and a clean one considering his past
performances. True, he could not hustle
Jeffries around as he has many others,
yet he seemed intent on making a fair
fight, forgetting himself very seldom,
and then doing no damage.
He was almost continually on the de
fensive, his rapid footwork and clever
ducking saving him from many a hard
punch. He tried hard and often to land
a damaging punch, but Jeffries was tun
big and long. He. mad<* a game fight,
however, yet should not complain, as
Jeffries outpunched him, having him on
queer street three or four different times.
Both men have much to learn in the
way of science before they will be able to
cope with such men as Corbett and Fitz
simmons.
JEFFRIES WAS
NEVER AFRIAD
Jeffrfes f natural modesty got the better
of him. and he begged to be excused from
saying anything, adding that he dJd not
wish to appear rude, but he had nothing
to say. By repeated questioning, how
ever, he was prevailed on to say that his
hands caused him a great deal of pain
and he was unable to hit with much
force, as every blow caused a twinge of
pain to shoot* through his arm, causing
him to flinch.
"At no staye of the game could he lick
me," he said. "His blows did not feaze
me, and [ told him at different times dur
ing the light that he would lose if he did
li. Â«t do more lighting and less running
away. This would anger him, and he
said he would kmxk my roof out Into the
audience, and when he hit me he would
,;>; : How do you like that?' I joshed
him throughout the fight, and it got him
crasy. The only injury I received was
when he butted me in the nose and eye. . j
"He blackened It, and it hurt me more
than his blows. I was not tired at the
end of the fight, but was as fresh as a
daisy. I "m going to rest until my hands
get "in shape again, as I can't hit with
them. I will then be ready to receive
challenges."

SHARKEY CALLS
IT A ROBBERY.
"Well. I think it was a robbery." Shar
key disgustedly said after the fight.
"Greggains did the dirtiest, lowest and
meanest turn ever done in Frisco. The
worst he could have done was to call it
a draw, but to give Jeffries a decision
after I punched him and did almost
everything with this fellow! You see
there is not a mark on me. I was able
to punch him when and wherever I
wanted. I could have knocked him out
in the tenth round, but thought if I be
gan rushing the crowd would have hal
ten '1 foul and the police would stop it.
"I will fight him again for $20,000 any
time he warns to. That decision does not
hurt me. r will say one thing: If he
jr. â â  s up against Maher he will knock hla
head off. I don't know of any heavy
weight in the ring that he can lick. When
Greggains gave Jeffries the decision I
nearly dropped dead with surprise. I am
going to rest for six months, and the next
light I go into will be for the champion
ship of the world. My reputation Is all
ritrht. That decision only means a dif
ference of a few thousand to me."

The foregoing is the list of the men who
were injured by the collapse of several
rows of chairs at the Pavilion last night.
A few minutes before Baker and Stelzner
appeared in the ring the crowd was horri
fied by a sudden crash, accompanied by
the shrieks of the- wounded.
The seats in the southwest corner ot
the immense building had collapsed, pre
cipitating several hundred men to the
floor. The police rushed to the rescue, of
I the wounded, and when the debris was
i cleared away it was found that a number
I had been injured. A few minutes later
| the seats near the main entrance gave
way. injuring several people
Immediately after the first accident
! happened the ambulance was summoned.
i Finding that it w;is impossible to convey
the wounded to the hospital in the ani
bulance Captain Wlttman ordered the
patrol wagons to assist in removing the
'' "john Holland, a former driver of the
patrol wagon, and Louis Holtz secured
' a stretcher and assisted in removing the
wounded men to the hospital
"With the exception of Mulvey It was
i found that none were seriously Injured.
Mulvey, who is well known, it Is feared
' is internally hurt.
1 All the victims were loud in their de
i nunciation of the failure of the National
' Club to see that the seats were substan
tially arranged- It is claimed that several
holders of tickets informed the promot
ers of the fight that they feared an acci
dent, and suggested that they proceed to
"brace" the seats.
They were told to mind their own busi
ness, it is claimed, and rather than miss
the fight they concluded to occupy the
i seats, at the risk of their lives.
