MANILA, Philippine Isl
ands, on board the flagship
Olympia, May i (via Hong
kong, May B).â On the day
he sailed from Mirs Bay to go
in search of the enemy Com
modore Dewey remarked to
the officers grouped around
him that he proposed to fight
the Spaniards on the very
first day he could get at them,
and this he believed would
be the following Sunday.
When we arrived off Subig
Bay, not very far north of
Manila, yesterday afternoon,
all the commanding officers
of the ships were called to
gether on the flagship and
every detail of the plan of at
tack was outlined to them by
the Commodore.
The complete precision
with which the plan was ex
ecuted to-day reflects equal
credit upon Commodore
Dewey and his captains.
As I have already stated,
The San Francisco Call
after the destruction of the
enemy's ships and fortifica
tions and the battle was over,
the Commodore anchored his
fleet off the City of Manila
and sent word to Governor-
General Augusti that the port
of Manila was now blockaded.
With this notice went a
plainly worded warning
that i? a single shot was
fired at any ship of the
American fleet from Manila,
that city would be laid in
ashes.
Commodore Dewey also
made a demand for the use
of the cable from Manila to
Hongkong. No reply to this
demand has yet been re
ceived. Never in the history
of battles on sea or land has
there been a more complete
clearing out of an enemy of
equal or superior force
achieved with so little harm
to the victors.
Not one American was
killed. Every American ship
is ready to-night to fight a
similar action to-morrow
morning. To-day's complete
victory was the product of
forethought, cool, well-bal
anced judgment, discipline
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, MAY 9, 1898.
SAMPSON'S FLEET OFF
THE HAYTIAN COAST
NEW YORK, May 8. â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends the following:
Cable advices received from Bear Admiral Sampson announce his arrival off the coast of Hayti yes
terday with a division of his fleet. He will remain at the' point where he is now located until the department
or one of the scouts informs him of the appearance of the Spanish men-of-war, which sailed from St. Vincent
nine days ago. Although press reports have been published announcing that the Spanish fleet has arrived at
San Juan and off Martinique, the department has heard nothing from the American liners acting as scouts
confirming such reports, and the Consular officers of this Government in the West Indies are silent. The
officers are under instructions to report to the Department of State any reliable information of the presence
of any Spanish men-of-war.
The Naval Board has estimated the Spanish squadron should be at or near Porto Bico by this time,
and it is in the hope of bottling up the fleet in the harbor of San Juan that the men-of-war of the North
Atlantic squadron are hovering within a short distance of Porto Bico.
Should the Spanish fleet not make its appearance in the West Indies by to-morrow night or Tues
day, the authorities will turn their attention to the battleship Oregon and her consorts, the gunboat Marietta
and cruiser Nictheroy, whose safety will then become a matter of anxiety. Believing that these ships can
take care of themselves, it is not proposed by the Naval War Board to send them any reinforcements on ac
count of the blockade of the Cuban coast and of the exposure of the gulf ports of the United States that would
consequently follow. If the Oregon should engage the enemy in battle it is expected that prompt information
will be at once sent to Washington, and then Bear Admiral Sampson's fleet can safely be sent to destroy it.
So far as the protection of northern ports is concerned, the authorities are confident that the junction
of the flying squadron and the northern patrol squadron will form a fleet which will defeat the Spanish
squadron, should it make its appearance along the coast. Commodore W. S. Schley, commanding the squad
ron, has orders to be prepared to sail at a moment's notice, but he will only go in the event that the where
abouts of the Spanish fleet is ascertained.
Offensive movements against Porto Rico may be expected to commence immediately after the de
struction of the Spanish fleet or upon receipt of information showing that the enemy's men-of-war are still
on the other side of the Atlantic. The more the officials have studied the situation the more convinced they
are that Porto Bico is the strategical key to the situation, and there is some talk in naval circles as to the
advisability of first occupying Porto Bico and then invading Cuba. It is possible that the two invasions may
occur simultaneously, but in any event the authorities have determined to take Porto Bico as soon as they are
advised of the whereabouts of the Spanish men-of-war. It is recognized that it would be foolhardy to attempt
to transport troops to Porto Bico, about 1000 miles distant from Key West, in the face of a possible attack
by the Spanish fleet, and it is this danger that has caused the officials to hesitate about making an offensive
movement. With Porto Bico in the possession of this Government, and with a strong fleet stationed there, it
will be possible to withdraw many of the men-of-war from Cuban waters after a large army has been trans
ported to Cuba and to leave to the land forces and to the monitors and auxiliary vessels the work of reducing
Havana and of forcing Captain-General Blanco to capitulate.
and bravery.
The position taken by the
Spaniards, coupled with their
heavy guns mounted on shore,
gave them an enormous ad
vantage. Only our good luck
COMMODORE DEWEY'S
WORK UP TO DATE.
MONDAY, April 25.â Received news of the declaration of war.
Quitted British waters.
WEDNESDAYâ SaiIed for Manila at fastest speed that could be
made with coal supply for ships.
SATURDAY NlGHTâ Passed the batteries at the entrance of
Manila Bay.
SUNDAYâ Sank, burned or captured all the ships of the Span
ish squadron, silenced and destroyed three batteries.
MONDAYâ Occupied navy-yard. Blew up six batteries at the
entrance to the bay. Cut the cable. Established blockade of
Manila. Drove Spanish forces out of Cavite.
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAYâ Swept the lower bay and en
trance for torpedoes. Gave crews well-earned rest. Prepared
official dispatches.
The losses of the Spaniards include ten warships, several tor
pedo boats, two transports, navy-yard and nine batteries.
Including the losses ashore about 1200 Spaniards were killed
or wounded,
The estimated value of the Spanish property destroyed or cap
tured is $6,000,000.
On the American side the total loss is eight men wounded and
$5000 damage to ships.
or the bad aim of the Span
ish gunners saved us a more
terrible loss of life.
Where every vessel in the
American fleet proved itself
so efficient I cannot draw
distinctions, but when the
ships passed each other
close aboard, after the ac
tion was over, the hearti
est cheers heard after
those for the commodore
were given to the little gun
boat Petrel.
During the first hour of the
fight in the morning a Span
ish torpedo-boat was seen
sneaking along the shore
ahead of the Olympia. Sud
denly thistorpedo-boat turned
and made a quick and plucky
dash at the flagship. The
commander of that Spanish
craft must have been ignorant
of the power of modern guns
or utterly indifferent to death.
Not until she had been
twice hit by shots from the
Olympia's secondary battery
did the daring little boat turn
back. She reached the beach
just in time to save her crew
from drowning.
Two other Spanish torpedo
boats made more cautious at
tempts to come out into the
harbor to attack us, but one
was immediately sunk by
our fire and the other quickly
abandoned the attack.

DOING HONOR
TO GALLANT
GEORGE DEWEY
It Now Remains for Congress to
Carry Out the President's Wishes
in Thanking the Admiral.
XEW YORK, May 8. â A Washington special to the Herald says:
President McKinley and Congress will unite In doing honor to Act
ing Rear Admiral Dewey for his sweeping victory. The President
has alr-ady done all that he can, without th<* co-operation of Con
gress, by cabling to the gallant officer in command of the Asiatic fleet
that he has appointed him an acting rear admiral, and that he will
recommend that he receive the thanks of Congress as a preliminary
to further promotion. Section 1356 of the Revised Statutes provides that
"during war rear admirals shall be selected from those officers on
the active list not below the grade of commanders, who shall have
eminently distinguished themselves by courage, skill and genius in
their profession, but no officer shall be so promoted under this pro
vision unless, upon recommendation by the President by name, he
eceived the thanks of Congress."
Section 1508 of the Revised Statutes says that any line officer,
â whether of the regular navy or volunteers, m*y be advanced one
grade, if upon recommendation of the President, by name, he has re
ceived the thanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in
conflict with the enemy or for extraordinary heroism.
rnder the law it is necessary for the President to take the first
step toward giving any officer the thanks of Congress or of promot
ing him out of his regular order. In the case of Acting Rear Ad
miral Dewey, the President has already indicated that he will rec
ommend a vote of thanks and will then give him the promotion pro
vided by law. Whether he is to have a still higher promotion will de
pend on Congress. At present the highest grade provided for by law
in the navy is that of rear admiral, the grades of admiral and vice
admiral having expired with the deaths of Admiral Porter and Vice-
Admiral Rowan. Special legislation would be required to revive
either grade. It is probable that one or both of them may be revived
at the end of the war as rewards for officers who have signally
distinguished themselves. That Acting Rear Admiral Dewey -will re
ceive one <>f these rewards may be regarded as certain. Acting Rear
Admiral Sampson is looked upon as likely to receive the other.
natural advantages for defense
than are found in Manila Bay.
Commodore Dewey's promptness
in bringing over his fleet from Mirs
Bay prevented them from moving
to this position.
1 find that in my previous dis
patch 1 underestimated the losses
of Spaniards in Sunday's battle.
The surgeon of Castilla tells me
that Admiral Montijo was wound
ed. The captain, chaplain and
ninety others were killed and six
were wounded on the Castilla.
One hundred and fifty were
killed and ninety wounded on the
Reina Christina, Admiral Montijo's
flagship.
Five were killed and twenty
nine wounded on the Don Juan de
Austria.
Four were killed and fifty wound
ed on the Don Antonio de Ulloa.
As 1 am leaving the harbor the
situation in the city of Manila is
very critical. The British Consul
reports that the city has been en
tirely cut off from the outside
worid both by sea and land, and
only enough provisions left to last
a few days.
It is impossible to open commu
nication between the shore and
the fleet, and therefore news about
events ashore is very scarce on
board the American vessels.
The little that has leaked
through indicates the probability
that the insurgents will soon attack
the city. The Spanish residents
of Manila are very bitter against
the Governor-General and they
are threatening to depose him.
Here is a summary of Commo
dore Dewey's work up to date:
Monday, April 25 â Received
news of the declaration of war.
Quitted British waters.
Wednesday â Sailed for Manila
at fastest speed that could be made
with the coal supply of the ships.
Saturday night â Passed the bat
teries at the entrance of Manila
Bay.
Sunday â Sank, burned or cap
tured all the ships of the Spanish
squadron, and silenced and de
stroyed three batteries.
Monday â Occupied the navy
yard. Blew up six batteries at
the entrance to the bay. Cut the
cable. Established a blockade at
Manila. Drove the Spanish forces
out of Cavite.
Tuesday and Wednesday â
Swept the lower bay and entrance
for torpedoes, and gave the crews
a well-earned rest. Prepared the
official dispatches.
The losses of the Spaniards in
clude ten warships, tor
pedo-boats, two transports, a
navy-yard and nine batteries.
Including the losses ashore,
about 1200 Spaniards we re killed
or wounded.
The estimated value of the
Spanish property destroyed or cap
tured is $6,000,c00.
On the American side the total
loss is eight men wounded and
Â£5000 damage to ships.
The British gunboat Linnet en
tered the bay on Monday, but
some of her men having the plague
she did not come near to our ships.
The French armored cruiser
Bruix entered the bay to-day. The
British cruiser Immortal ite is un
derstood to be on her way to
Manila.

ST. JOHNS.
ST. JOHNS, N. F., May B.â
Owing to the serious interna
tional complications growing out
of the war between the United
States and Spain, the British
Government is arranging to for
tify St. Johns. The British War
Office has cabled the Governor,
Sir Herbert Murray, as to the
condition of the forts and bar
racks belonging to the imperial
Government, which were given
into the custody of the colonial
authorities when the troops were
withdrawn from here in 1870.
Sir Herbert Murray and the
Colonial Ministry are consult

perial troops, the first contingent
of which is likely to arrive from
Halifax next week.
last Sunday's battle, the more
miraculous it seems that no Ameri
can lost his life.
The shell that entered the Bos
ton's wardroom was going straight
for Paymaster Martin, when it ex
ploded within a few feet of him,
yet he was not touched.
Aboard the Olympia an operat
ing table was placed in the ward
room. Chaplain Frazier, who was
assisting the surgeon, had his head
out of one of the 6-pounder gun
ports, when a shell struck the
ship's side, less than a yard away.
The chaplain pulled his head in
just in time to -escape having it
blown off, as the shell instantly
burst.
Three fragments of one shell
struck the Olympia within a
radius of fifteen feet from Commo
dore Dewey. The armor-piercing
projectile that exploded a box of
three-pounder ammunition on the
Baltimore passed between two
groups of men so close to both that
it is difficult to see how all es
caped.
If the Spaniards had properly
prepared for our coming they
would have killed many of our
men, but they had not intended to
make their fight at Cavite.
Among other official papers cap
tured in Admiral Montijo's office
was his acknowledgment of the
receipt of a decision of the Council
of War officers to mass his guns
and ships at Subig Bay, where
much better conditions for defense
existed. This was prevented only
by Commodore Dewey's action. A
few days would have sufficed to
remove all their guns and ships to
Subig Bay, where there is a nar
row entrance and the water is
shoal, and a plunging fire from
shore would have made victory
very difficult for us to attain.
HORRORS OF THE
NAVAL BATTLE
DULY DEPICTED
Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
HONGKONG, May B.â Early in the
morning of Monday, May 2, the day af
ter the battle in Manila Bay, Comman
der Lamberton and myself were or
dered to go to Cavite Arsenal and take
possession. The Petrel took us within
500 yards of the landing, when we were
surprised to see that the arsenal was
still occupied by about 800 seamen,
armed with Mauser magazine rifles.
As the white flag had been hoisted
on the arsenal the day before, Com
mander Lamberton could not under
stand what the Spaniards intended to
do, and before leaving the Petrel he
ordered Commander Wood to keep his

men at the guns, with directions that if
we were not back in one hour he should
open fire on the arsenal.
On landing we were met by Captain
Sostoa of the Spanish navy, next in
rank at this station to Admiral Mon
tijo, who had been wounded and con
veyed to Manila. Commander Lamber
ton, Lieutenant Wood of the Petrel and
myself went with Sostoa to the arsenal
headquarters, which were at once sur
rounded by an armed guard. Comman
der Lamberton told Captain Sostoa that
he was surprised to see his men under
arms after they had surrendered the
day before.
Captain Sostoa replied that they had
not surrendered, but had merely hoist
ed the white flag in order to enable
them to remove the women and chil
dren to places of safety.
Commander Lamberton said that
when the Spanish flag came down and
the white flag went up, no other inter
pretation could be placed upon it than
that it was an unconditional surrender,
and the women and children ought not
to have been there anyhow.
Captain Sostoa remarked that we
came so early in the day they had not
| had time to remove them. If we had
not begun the light so soon the women
would have been out of the way.
Commander Lamberton reminded him !
that the Spaniards had fired the first
j shot However, he added, he was not !
there to discuss past events. He had I
I come, as Commodore Dewey's represen- j
i tative, to take possession of the arsenal, j
All the Spaniards there, he said, must i
surrender their arms and persons as ,
prisoners of war, otherwise our ships i
would open fire on them.
Then Captain Costoa said he could ;
do nothing, not being in command, and
would have to consult his superiors.
Commander Lamberton refused to
recognize any one but the senior of
ficer actually present, who. he said,
must comply with Commodore Dewey's
conditions.
Captain Sostoa asked to have the
terms of surrender put down in writ
ing, which was done, these being the
conditions: "Without further delay all
the Spanish officers and men must be
withdrawn, and no buildings or stores
must be injured. As Commodore
Dewey does not wish further hostility
with the Spanish naval forces, the
Spanish officers will be paroled, and
the forces at the arsenal will deliver
all their small arms."
Captain Sostoa thTi pleaded for more
time. The talk had all been in Span
ish, and the time when Commander
Wood was to ..pen flre was already
nearly *up. Consequently, Commander
Lamberton gave the Spaniards two
hour's time. If the white flag was not
rehoiste . over the arsenal at noon, he
said, we should reopen flre. We re
turned to the Petrel just in time and
started back across the bay to report
to the commodore. At 10 .3 o'clock the
whit, flag was hoisted, but when we
went to take possession of the arsenal
in the afternoon, we found that every
seaman had marched off to Manila,
carrying his Mauser rifle with him.
Hearing that evening that the Gov
ernor of Manila had refused to let the
cable company transmit our messages.
Commodore Dewty sent the merchant
steamer Zafiro a short distance down
the bay and hid her cut the cable.
Having no instruments for working
the cable, we o-uid not keep up com
munication, and the Governor would
not let the cable company send Its
operators to our ships.
No one can complain that Commo
dore Dewey has been slow in finishing
off his work, but he would have done it
even sooner but for an accident to one
of the Raleigh's pumps, which detained
him in Mirs Bay two days, and also the
slow speed of which the transport ves
sels are capable. But for these delays
the Spanish ships would have been de
stroyed on Thursday instead of Sun
day, as in all other respects Commodore
Dewey's plans were complete.
During the passage of the forts at the
entrance of Manila Bay on Saturday
night Frank B. Randall, chief engineer
of the revenue cutter McCulloch, died
suddenly from heat and prostration.
He was buried at sea the next day.
Although the McCulloch was of no
value as a fighting machine, Commo
dore Dewey several times made use of
her to overhaul sailing craft. She kept
at a safe distance from the scene of
action on Sunday, but went down the
bay to meet the English merchant
steamer Esmeralda, which was coming
in, and made an excellent record for
speed as a dispatch boat while bringing
us over to Hongkong on Thursday.
There were three civilian spectators of
the battle at a distance of ten miles
from the fighting line, but that inci
dent hardly warrants the claim of any
newspaper that it had a steamer spe
cially chartered to accompany the
squadron.
As soon as the natives ashore learned
that the Spaniards had been driven out
of Cavite they began coming in crowds
to pillage. Finally they became so bold
as to attack the hospital, and it was
necessary to send a gruard of American
seamen to protect the wounded or to
transfer them to Manila, The latter
was done on Wednesday, Commodore
Dewey utilizing the captured steamers
for this duty. All the houses of the
Spaniards in the town of San Rogue,
near Cavite, were absolutely gutted by
the natives, who even ventured into the
arsenal and carried off many boatloads
of furniture and stores before a marina
guard was posted at the gates.
The Spanish defeat was advertised
for miles away by the phips burning in
Cavite Bay. The Castilla, which was
set on fire in Sunday morning's battle,
was a magnificent mass of flames
twelve hours later, and continued to
burn all night with brilliant intensity.
I boarded the Don Juan de Austria,
the Isla de Luzon and the Marquis del
Onero while they were still burning. 1
found them fitted up with fine Canet
rapid-fire guns and modern equipments.
I did not discover until we had spent
the afternoon in their vicinity that all
their large guns had been left loaded
with powder and shell, making them
peculiarly dangerous to small boats.
The guns generally lay level just above
the surface of the water. As several
of them were pointd at the arsenal
their charges were first drawn, and
"drowned," as the fire might reach
them at any moment.
When our ships drew away for
breakfast Sunday morning the temper
of the men was well illustrated by the
almost tearful appeal of one gun cap
tain to Commander Lamberton. "For
God's sake, captain, don't stop now,
let's finish them right off. To hell with
breakfast."
"Old Purdy," a privileged petty offi
cer, because he has served in the navy
or army nearly fifty years, greeted the
commodore on Saturday, when the old
man "shifted his quid" and said: "I
hope you won't fight on the 3d of May,
commodore."
"Why not?" asked Commodore
Dewey.
"Well, you see," the old man said. "I
got licked the last time I fought on
that day."
Purdy had been with Hooker at
Chancellorsville, and he did not like
that anniversary.
All our firemen suffered greatly from
the heat during the action, for they
were all shut up below, with furnaces
blazing and a tropical sun pouring down
its heat rays. Probably several of
them would have succumbed but for
tne excitement of battle.
Eighty Spanish bodies were found
unburied on Monday knight, and we
gave them a burial Tuesday morning,
railing in a Roman Catholic priest to
read the burial service over their re
mains. The bodies presented a horrible
sight. One had a head almost entirely
carried away. Another had been struck
111 the stomach by a large projectile,
cuting everything away to the back
bone. One very large man, apparently
an officer, was not only mangled but
burned, and all the bodies were horribly
bloated. To add to the horror of trie
scene, several lean wolf-like dogs had
discovered the bodies before we had.
Probably there were nowhere a more

Post No 42, G. A. R., met General
Woodford at Quarantine and accompa
nied him to this city. General Wood
ford declined to be interviewed by re
porters, saying he was still in the dip
lomatic service of the Government and
could say absolutely nothing for pub
lication.
Mr. Sickles, when informed that
cable dispatches had reported that the
train on which the members of the
legation had come from Madrid to
Paris had been attacked by a mob
and that stones had been thrown at
the party, said:
"Well, some things were thrown at
the train, but the demonstration was
not of a serious character. A number
of students â not a large numberâ had
gathered at Valladolid and cried: 'Long
live Spain,' and a few other patriotic
cries. They were not directed against
us particularly, I assure you, but were
the result of a patriotic feeling on their
part. A few windows in one of the
cars next to the party were broken,
but none of us were injured. None at
all were hurt. While at Madrid we
were treated with the utmost cour-
tesy."
When asked how it happened that
Minister Woodford had received his
passport previous to his handing to the
Spanish Government the ultimatum of
the United States Mr. Sickles said:
"We rather expected that, at least
we were not surprised when the pass
ports arrived, as we knew that when
the Spanish Minister at Washington
received his papers the Spanish Cabi
net could probably issue ours to us and
thereby sever all diplomatic relations.
But any further information I cannot
give."
Naval Attache Dyer, when asked
about the reception of his passports by
Minister Woodford, said that he had
not been present at the time, as he had
accompanied the wife and daughter
of Minister Woodford to Paris and had
I left on the day previous to that on
! which the passports had been handed
in.
Colonel Kellogg of the Fourth United
States Cavalry, the military attache
at Paris, said
"I am simply going to Washington to
! beg to be permitted to take part in the
i active operations in the army when
they take place. Captain Rodgers of
the Fourth Cavalry is compelled to re
main abroad, but will make every
effort to be transferred to this country
as soon as possible."
J. S. Highlands, another American
on the steamer, said he had gone
abroad to visit his son at Madrid. He
had intended staying for about six
months, but the anti-American demon
strations had been so great that he
was forced to leave that place within
three weeks after his arrival and that
his son was forced to flee to Lisbon.
Mr. Highlands said that the signs on
the offices of the American business
houses had been smashed and torn
down.
W. G. Cannon of Denver, who had
been traveling abroad, said he was
forced to return to this country, and
he could not continue through Spain
during the present state of affairs. In
Paris, Mr. Cannon said, the feeling was
most bitterly anti-American. Every
person who was thought to be Ameri
can was elbowed off the sUewalks,
jestled by the crowds and every-.Uins
possible done to show the antipathy of
the French. Petty annoyances were
practiced. For instance, the street cars
will not stop to take on American pas
sengers, rates of exchange on money
in most cases are exorbitant and small
purchases are not encouraged by many
of the shop keepers except at figures
three or four times the actual value.
WASHINGTON, May 8. â General
Stewart L. Woodford, United States
Minister to Spain, arrived in Washing
ton from New York to-night. He
went almost directly to the White
House, where he was given a most cor
dial reception by the President. He
remained in conference with the Presi
dent until a late hour, the entire His
pano-American situation being inform
ally and thoroughly discussed. General
Woodford declined to be interviewed
on the subject.
It can be said that the President not
only gave General Woodford a cordial
reception, but warmly congratulated
him upon his conduct of American in
terests in Madrid. The President as
sured him that his work in Madrid dur
ing the critical crisis met with his en
tire approval.
It was learned to-night that the ad
ministration had a purpose in transmit
ting to General Woodford the ulti
matum of the United States to Spain
in open English, instead of in the State
Department cipher, which is usually
employed in cable correspondence with
diplomatic representative? It was ex
pected by tlie President that the mes
sage to Minister Woodford would be
laid before the Saga^ta ministry be
fore it was delivered to General Wood
ford, and in this he was not incorrect,
as 'events proved. The message was
delayed many hours in delivery, and
Minister Woodford afterward learned
that the ultimatum had been in the
hands of Sagasta and had been con
sidered by the Cabinet long before he
lear-ed that it had arrived. Thus it
was that the Spanish Government was
enabled to give him his r ,ssports be
fore he had an opportunity to deliver
the ultimatum formally to the Madrid
Government.
The fact that the ultimatum was not
presented to the Spanish Government
was entirely satisfactory to the ad
ministration, as it was In accordance
with the expectations of the President.
Consul General Bow^n, whose head-.
quarters were at Barcelona, arrived
here to-night in company with General
Woodford. He, too. declined to make
, any statement for publication.
SAMPSON'S
VICTORY MAY
END THE WAR
Having Acquired the Spanish
Islaods, It Will Tak;e Time to
Decide Upon Their Future.
NEW YORK. May B.â The Herald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: Optimistic military and naval men, encouraged by the ease
with which Admiral Dewey annihilated the Spanish vessels in Manila
harbor, are confident to-day of an early ending of the war.
Anticipating that Admiral Sampson will be equally successful
when he meets the Spanish Squadron in Porto Rican waters, the
consensus of opinion among them is that the war will be over with
in thirty days. These prophecies, however, are predicated on the
theory that Admiral Sampson will meet the Spanish fleet, which is
overdue at Porto Rico.
With Admiral Dewey's successes in the Pacific repeated by Ad
miral Sampson in the Atlantic there is little doubt that the back
bone of the war will be effectually broken. With two reverses to
her navy like the one she suffered at Manila, Spain must realize
that it would be utter folly for her to make any further attempt
to prevent the United States from driving her out of Cuba and Porto
Rico, and when no further resistance from sea is possible at these
two places, it will be comparatively a simple matter for the United
States to take possession of both islands and maintain peace and or
der until a satisfactory form of government can be established.
As long as Spain keeps what vessels she has left home, and does not
molest our commerce, the United States will be satisfied to consider the
"war ended when the Spaniards are driven from Cuba and Porto Rico.
It does not follow that the demolition of the Spanish squadron
will bring an end to the military and naval operations of the United
States, nor will the evacuation of Cuba and Porto Rico by Spain
put an end to active work by our military and naval forces. There
is something else to be done besides driving Spain from this hemi
sphere. A new government must be established in Cuba, the starv
ing must be fed, and peace and order must be maintained in Porto
Rico. The United States has given notice to the world that it does
not want Cuba. Besides driving the Spanish troops out of Cuba, the
United States has the task of evolving order out of chaos after the
Spaniards have departed, and this may mean the employment of a
large military force for an indefinite period.
It may also be necessary to keep our vessels in Cuban waters for
some time after -we have ceased hostilities with Spain. The islands
will necessarily have to be under a military form of government,
pending an election by the people of the island to determine the
form of government they want. This cannot be accomplished in a day
or a month, and the probabilities are that the United States army will
be engaged in police duty, Jn f he island of Cuba for months after
actual hostilities with Spain have ceased. The same may be said of
Porto Rico and the Philippines. Although the disposition of the Phil
ippines is still a mooted question, there is a growing sentiment in
favor of holding this possession in the Pacific permanently. As to
Porto Rico, there is not the slightest doubt that when the American
flag is once planted it will never come down. The feeling here is that
we have been in search of a coaling station in the West Indies too
long and the necessity for such possession is too great to admit of
our relinquishing control for a financial consideration after we have
acquired it.
WAR REVENUE
BILL DELAYED
Many Amendments Un
der Consideration in
Committee.
Bond Proposition Will Be De
bated at Length in the
Senate.
Hawaiian Annexation Resolution to
Bo Introduced in ihÂ«
House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 8.
The expectation is that the war rev
enue bill will be received in the Sen
ate from the Committee on Finance
about "Wednesday, but its report may
be delayed for a day or two beyond
that date. The fact is that the com
mittee has found so many changes con
sidered desirable from its standpoint
that progress has necessarily been
slow. This has proved to be true with
out regard to party lines. The Repub
licans have suggested many more
amendments to the bill than have the
Democratic members, and many of
those suggested by them have been of
such importance as to require careful
attention and much time. There are
many matters yet requiring considera
tion and until these shall have been
voted upon in committee, it will be im
possible to fix a day for reporting the
bill.
Whether the bill shall carry a pro
vision for a new Government loan on
the bonds depends entirely upon Sen
ator Jones of Nevada. So far as it can
be learned he has not yet made known
his position in the committee, and the
other members profess to be ignorant
of the subject. The understanding on
the outside is that he will oppose the
bond feature, and that, consequently,
when the bill is reported this provision
will be eliminated and probably an au
thorization for the issuance of green
backs substituted lor it.
Whatever the verdict of the commit
tee on the bond clause, the bond ques
tion will form the basis of the Sen
ate's consideration of the bill. This
subject will in any event be debated
at length in the Senate. It is generally
conceded that even though the com
mittee displaces the provision, the
friends of the bond policy will be strong
enough to restore it in the Senate if a
vote is taken. The opponents of bonds
hold that strength of the bond provi
sion is due to the fact that the state
of war exists and they are hopeful
that war may come to a close before
it will be necessary to vote upon the
bill. They do not indicate any purpose
of holding the bill in the Senate with
this purpose in view, but they now
assert it to be their intention to de
bate the bill at length, or at least to the
extent necessary to present their views
fully to the country.
The Republican amendments are
directed to the improvement of the
details of the bill and to the elimina
tion of many small items and the in
sertion of others which will bring more
revenue. The Democratic members of
the committee generally are assisting
their Republican colleagues in this
matter and admit that the bi.i is being
improved by the process, but they in
sist that as th *y have so far been en
gaged on Republican amendments that
party should take the responsibility for
the delay that has occurred.
It is said that one or two days more
will be necessary for the perfection of
the measure according to the Repub
lican plan. How much more time will
be necessary for the Democratic sug
gestions cannot be foretold. It would
not, however, be very surprising if the
â  bill should not be taken up for debate
before the last days of the week.
The definite programme for Hnusa
procedure during the present week is
fixed.
On Tuesday the committee on foreign
affairs will probably report a joint res
olution providing for the annexation of
the Hawaiian Islands. It will have the
support of all Republican and somÂ«
Democratic members of the committee,
and, furthermore, in view of what
seems a recently growing sentiment
here favorable to a policy of coloniza
tion, its passage by the House this
week, without very strong resistance,
is likely.

TRAP OF
ENEMIES
Close Call of the Morrill
and Vicksburg From
Destruction.
Lured Under the Guns of Santa
Clara and Only Saved by
Bad Marksmanship.
KEY WEST, Fla., May B.â
Only poor marksmanship on the
part of the Spaniards saved the
Vicksburg and the cutter Mor
rill from destruction in Havana
harbor yesterday morning. For
over half an hour they were un
der the fire of the guns of the
Santa Clara water batteries, but
both escaped without material
injury, although shrapnel from
eight-inch guns exploded all
about them, and both now show
the scars of the Spanish bullets.
The wily Spaniards had arranged a
trap to send a couple of our ships to
the bottom. They baited it as a man
would bait a trap. A small schooner
was sent out from Havana harbor
Bhortly before daylight yesterday morn-
Ing to draw some of the Americans into
the ambuscade. The ruse worked like
a charm. The Vicksburg and the Mor
rlll, in the heat of the chase and in
their contempt for Spanish gunnery,
waiked straight into the trap that had j
been set for them. Had the Spaniards
their souls in patience but i
five minutes longer, not even the bad
gun practice would have saved our
Bhips, and this morning two more of j
our vessels would lie at the bottom,
within two lengths of the wreck of the
Maine.
Friday evening the Vicksburg and the
Morrill, cruising to the west of Morro I
Castle, were fired upon by the big guns
of the Cojimar batteries. Two shots '
were fired at the Vieksburg and one
at the Morrill. Both fell short and j
both vessels, without returning the fire
steamed out of range. It would have
been folly to have done otherwise. But j
rday morning the Spaniards had ;
better luck. The schooner they had
sent out before daylight ran off to the ;
eastward, hugging the shore with the
wind on her starboard quarter. About
three miles east <>f the entrance of
the harbor t;ht> came over on the port j
A li^ht haze frinr-ed the horizon
und she was not discovered until three
miles off shore, when the Mayflower:
made her out and signaled the Mor
rill arid Vicksburg.
Captain Smith of the Morrill and;
Commander Lilly of the Vicksburg im
mediately slapped on all steam and j
started in pursuit. The schooner in- j
Btantly put about and ran for Morro
Castle before the wind. On doing so, j
she would, according to the well con
ceived Spanish plot, lead the two Arner
lean warships directly under th? guns!
of the Santa Clara batteries. These
works are a short mile west of Morro, |
and are a part of the defenses of the '
harbor. There are two batteries, one '
at the shore, which has been recently !
thrown up, of sand and mortar, with
wide embrasures for eight-inch guns,
and the other on the crest of the rocky
eminence which juts into the gulf at
the point. The upper battery mounts
modern ten-inch and twelve-inch
Krupp guns behind a six-foot stone
parapet, in front of which are twenty
feet of earthwork and a belting of rail
road iron. This battery is considered
the most formidable of Havana's de
fenses, except Morro Castle. It is
masked and has not been absolutely
located by the American warships.
It is probably due to the fact that the
Spaniards did not desire to expose its
position thai the Vicksbursr and Mor
rill are now aiioat. The Morrill and
Vicksburg were about six miles from
Hi" schooner wh<.-n the chase began.
They steamed after her at full speed,
th" MorrilJ leading until within a mile
and a hall Santa Clara batter
i<-s. Commander Smith of the Vicks
burg was the first to realize the dan
ger into which the reckless pursuit had
led th- m. !!â¢â¢ concluded it was time to
halt, *and Bent a shot across the bow of
the Bchooner. The Spanish sl-ipper in
stantly brought his vessel about, but
while she was still rolling in the trough
of the sea, with her sails flapping, an
eipht-inch shrapnel shell came hurtlinp
through the air from the water battery,
a miie and a half away. It passed over
the Morrill between the pilot house and
the smokestack and exploded less than
fifty feet on the port quarter. The
small shot ratti'-rl ;i^;;inst her Bide. It
was ;< 11. Two more shots fol
lowed in fjuick succession, both shrap
nel. Â« >ne burst close under the star
board quarter, filling the enerine room
with the Bmoke of the explosion of the
Bhell, and the other, like the first,
passed over and exploded just beyond.
The Spanish gunners had the rantre
nnd their time fuses were accurately |
set. The crews of both ships were at I
their puns. Lieutenant Craig 1 , who was
in charge of the bow four-inch rapid- |
fire pun of the Morrill, asked for and
obtained permission to return the fire.
At the first snot the Vicksburg, which
was in the wake of the Morrill, sliphtly
in shore, sheered off and passed to
windward under the Morrill's stern.
In the meantime Captain Smith also
put his helm to port and was none too
Boon, for as the Morrill stood off a solid
eight-inch shot grazed her starboard
quarter and kicked up tons of water as
i 1 Ft ruck a wave 100 yards beyond.
Captain Smith said afterward that this
wna undoubtedly an eight-inch armor
pir-rcing projectile, and that it would
have passed through the Morrill's boil
ers had she not changed her course.
All the guns of the water battery
WfTP now at work. One of them cut
tho jacoh's ladder of the Vicksburg
adr'ft and another carried away a por
tion of tho ricking.
As the Morrill and the Vicksburg
sfr-.inif-rl away their aft guns were used,
but only a few shots were fired. The
Morrill's six-inch gun was elevated for
4000 yards, and struck tho earthworks
repeatedly. Tho Vicksburg fired re
peatedly shots from her six-pounder.
The Spaniards continued to fire shot
and shell for twenty minutes, but the
shots werv ineffective. Some of them
wore so wilil that they aroused the
American sailors to jeers.
The Spaniards only ceased firing
when the Morrill and Vicksburg were
completely out. of range. If all the
Spanish gunners had been suffering ,
, from strabismus, their practice could
not have been worse.
But the officers of both the Morrill
and Vicksburg frankly admit their own
recklessness and the narrow escape of
their vessels from destruction. They
are firmly convinced that the pursuit
of the schooner was a neatly planned
trick which almost proved successful.
If any one of the shots had struck the
thin skin of either vessel it would have
offered no more resistance than a piece
of paper to a rifle ball.
The accurate range of the first few
shots is accounted for by the fact that
the Spanish officers had ample time to
make observations. The bearings of
the two vessels were probably taken
with a range finder at the Santa Clara
battery, and as this battery is prob
ably connected by wire with Morro,
they were enabled to take bearings
from both points, and by laborious cal
culations they fixed the positions of the
vessels pretty accurately. With such
opportunity for observation it would
have been no groat trick for an Amer
ican gunner to drop a shell down the
smokestack of a vessel.
As soon as the ships sheered off, after
the first fire, the Spanish gunners lost
the range and their practice became
ludicrous. If they had waited five min
utes longer before opening fire. Cap
tain Smith says, it would have been
well-nigh impossible to have missed
the target.
Later in the day the Morrill cap
tured the Spanish schooner Espana,
bound for Havana, and towed the prize
to Key West.
On Friday the French school shin
Dubourdieu, carrying thirty guns in
all, entered the harbor of Havana. She
was stopped by the Morrill, and two
salutes were fired by the Annapolis be
fore she showed her flag.
PRAISE OF THE
ENGLISH PRESS
FOR BRAVE DEWEY
LONDON, May 9.â The comment on
the battle at Man. as the details
come in, is universally flattering to
Commodore Dewey and the American
navy.
The Times says: "The destruction of
the Spanish fleet was complete, as com
plete as any achievement recorded in
naval annals. Commodore Dewey show
ing himself worthy alike of the great
traditions of the United States navy
and of his kinship with the race that
; produced Nelson."
The Standard says: "Commodore
Dew 7 h^s evidently taken as his model
for dispatch writing, that laconic Brit
ish sailor of famous memory, who re
ported a decisive naval victpry thus:
Engaged en err. â¢ yesterday. Captured
ships as per margin.' "
The Daily News says: "Commodore
Dewey's dispatch ,in their conciseness
and modesty, are in accordance with
the best naval traditions. The battle
establishes a record among contests of
the kind, for one of the combatants de
stroyed the whole fleet of he other
without himself surfering any loss
whatever. The victors carried the
whoie Job through in a thoroughly
workmanlike manner. It is especially
worth noting that the discipline of the
American ships is reported to have been
perfect; for n:any Spanish authorities
and some independent critics thought
that this mi^ht be a weak point on the
American side. The. excellence of the
American tactics and the superiority of
marksmanship are likely to be a per
manent factor in this war. The chief
lesson i "iich the battle of Manila en
forces as what everybody knew before,
namely, that under modern conditions I
of warfare, no amount of personal
bravery can pos: ly make up a de
flc iency in weight and large metal.'"
ARMY TO BE LANDED
IN CUBA AT ONCE
Washington Post Declares the Inva- !
sion of the Island Is Not to
Be Delayed.
WASHINGTON, May 8.- -~ â Â» Wash-:
ington Post to-morrow will say: Be- 1
tween 60,000 and 80,000 men will be
landed on Cuban soil at once. They
will wear the uniform of the United |
States, and they will not return until !
they have defeated the Spanish forces j
on the island and the American flag !
floats as proudly over Havana as it j
does over the ruins of the Cavite fort- j
ress in Manila harbor. This is the idea j
of the military advisers ~? the admin- ;
istration, and the President approved
the plans.
The first section of the army to in-
I vade Cuba will be the 15,000 or 18,000 I
troops that are now assembled at New i
Orleans and Tampa. They are all reg- J
ulars, and most of them are men who i
have seen actual fighting on the plains. ;
They are seasoned, disciplined, effec- \
tive. They will be followed at once by j
another army of 50,000 volunteers, who
will be concentrated at Southern ports
as quickly as the trains can carry them, â â 
and will be transported as fast as the ;
necessary ships can be collected.
It is estimated that it will take at j
least three hundred vessels to carry j
this immense army to Cuba. Nearly ,
everything that floats has already '
been secured by the Government, and j
last night the wires wer^ hot in all \
directions, directing contracts to be j
closed immediately in all the principal
seaport towns.
Other details of the great expedition
have been Arranged. Within forty
eiÂ»jht hours there will be 2000 wagons at
Tampa and 12,000 miles. Several hun
dred ambulances will also be hurried to '
Tampa. Th^y may be needed. Battles ;
are not all like the one which has just
been fought in Manila Harbor..

Authorities.
Promptly Arrested After Mail
ing Information to a Span
ish Official at Toronto.
In the Intercepted Letter He Tells
About Relief for Dewey and
Plans of the Navy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Rlggs House,
Washington, May 8.
Chief Wilkie of the Treasury Secret
1 Service to-day expressed his unquali
, fled belief in the guilt of the man ar
i rested at his direction last night as a
. Spanish spy. All the circumstances in
! the case, many of which Mr. Wilkie
I sets forth, lead up to this irresistible
'. conclusion. He preferred that the story
of the man's arrest should not have
been made public at this time, but he
feels, now that an incorrect version has
leaked out, that it is just as well that
the correct story should be told. The
! man's name is not Kawlings, as origi
i nally announced, but George Downing,
j apparently about 33 years of age, five
| feet seven inches in height, of athletic
; build and Bohemian in appearance.
| Mr. Wilkie tells an interesting story of
I the man's doings lately and of thesteps
! which led up to his arrest.
"Downing," he says, "is an English
man by birth, but is a naturalized
American, and was formerly chief yeo
1 man on the cruiser Brooklyn. His dis
charge from that ship occurred about
two months ago. Our information
shows that last Friday he had a con
ference with Lieutenant Carranza. who
was a naval attache of Spanish Minis
ter de Bernabe, and who was then at
Toronto. He furnished Carranza gen
eral information about the navy, and
particularly about the Brooklyn "navy
yard. After one and a half hours' talk
he came to Washington at the direction
of the lieutenant. He left Toronto Fri
day afternoon for this city. Before
leaving Toronto Carranza gave Down
ing an address which apparently that
officer furnished in Montreal, to which
he was to send all information he ob
tained. Downing- arrived here yester
day afternoon and went directly to
918 E street, where he had stopped no
longer than a week ago. When he left
be told the landlady he was going to
Virginia. Shortly after reaching the
house he went out again to the post
office and dropped a letter into the box
for the address in Montreal which had
been given to him.
"I should say right here that our
officers recognized Downing as soon as
he arrived at the railroad depot and
kept a strict watch on his movements
all during the afternoon and evening
up to the time of his arrest. The let
ter which he mailed was promptly
intercepted and its contents examined.
It contained a statement as to certain
matters In Washington, said the writer
would soon be able to forward some
important information about the Hoi- :
land submarine boat; gave a summary !
of the Bteps for the relief of Admiral
Dewey and promised datja as to the :
movement of American colliers. Down- j
ing also said he intended to go to Nor
folk (which place he hoped to reach !
Tuesday), and expected to obtain im- j
portant information. The letter was !
signed simply with the initials 'G. G. !
We were well satisfied that the man
was a spy, and set about to secure his
apprehension. We communicated with
Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn of the
War Department, to whom we gave a j
summary of the information in our pos
session, and then with Judge Advocate
General Leiber of the army, who ad- j
vised that the man be arrested and
turned over to the military authorities.
Downing returned to his room during
the evening, after dining and reading
the news bulletins.
"Accompanied by Captain Sage of the
Eighth Artillery, a corporal and a pri- ''.
vate, by my own officers and by a
policeman, we went to Downing's
house, where we secured him without
trouble. He offered no resistance, but
appeared frightened and much sur
prised at what was taking place. He
was handcuffed to the private, who,

he is under guard. We have turned

BEARS REPORTS
TO GEN. MILES
Captain Miley En Route
to Washington From
Tampa.
Result of the Meeting Between
Dorst and Cuban In
surgents.
Breaking Out of Yellow Fever at
Key West Causes Uneasiness
Among Soldiers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TAMPA. Fla., May B.â Captain J. H.
Miley, senior aid de camp to Major
General Shafter, left Tampa very
quietly last night for Washington to
report to General Miles.
Captain Miley's visit to Washington
has an important bearing on the future
course of events here, as It Is said on
good authority that he bears with him
the report of Captain J. H. Dorst as to
the results of the latter's meeting last
week with General Delgado of the Cu
ban insurgents near Havana. Captain
Miley also has Lieutenant Colonel Law
ton's report on his meeting at Key
West on Friday with oflicers of the
American blockading squadron, Major
General Shafter's recommendations as
to the plan of campaign In the contem
plated Cuban invasion, and plans of
Lieutenant Colonel Ludlo*v, chief of
engineers, regarding fortifications, etc.,
at the point of landing in Cuba,
Captain Miley will return to Tampa
immediately after his mission is ac
complished. The work of preparing the
transports has been delayed a good
deal by the non-arrival of material,
and it will be Wednesday, perhaps
later, before this work is accomplished.
But outside of the delay in the prepar
ations, no American troops will be
landed on Cuban soil until the question
of superiority in the Atlantic is settled !
between Admiral Sampson's squadron j
and the Spanish fleet, and settled de
ciaively. High army officials make this j
statement.
They say it would be taking needless !
chances to send an army into Cuba be- j
fore the Spanish fleet is disposed of,
and until the meeting of the American
and Spanish fleets takes place no one |
here believes orders to move will be re
ceived.
Services were held at both the Tampa
and Port Tampa grounds to-day by the
rf-pimental chaplains. There was no
drilling and thousands of soldiers at
tended the services. The sermons in
every case were of an intensely patri
otic character.
Reports of the breaking out of yellow
fever at Key West among the prize
crew of the Argonauta have caused
some uneasiness among the soldiers
here, probably in view of the fact that
two companies of the Twenty-fifth
Regiment arrived from Key West yes
terday and are now In camp here.
Should these reports prove true it is
probable that a rigid quarantine will be
established.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON. May B.â Secretary
Porter made the following statement
to-night concerning the authenticity
of certain alleged comments by the
President on this week's war specials
of prominent newspapers:
Inquiries have been made so frequently
that it seems that some official state
ment should be made concerning them.
The quotations alluded to are bogus, not
only in text, but In substance. The Presi
dent made no such comments either to
representatives of the press or to In
dividuals. Since his inauguration he has
adhered strictly to the policy of not
talking for publication, and this will con
tinue to be the invariable rule in the fu
ture. Any other course would be In
judicious, for reasons which need not be
dwelt upon. The same applies to Mrs.
McKinley, who has several times re
cently been misquoted as having granted
authorized interviews.
The President and administration, of
course, rejoice in all the reputable suc
cesses of American journalism, of which
we have many fine specimens nowadays,
but self-laudation and exaggeration de
tract from, rather and add to the bril-
liancy of these achievements. Our papers
should prize truth not less than boldness
and push.
INVASION OF
CUBA DELAYED
Troops Not to Be Landed
for at Least a
Week.
New Plan of Campaign For
mulated by Army and
Navy Leaders.
Invading Army Will Bo in Two Divi
sions, One Commanded by
General Lee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, .'ay B.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President
McKinley has decided to put off the in
vasion of Cuba for at least a week.
The plans for the movement b joint
forces of the army and navy against
Havana have be^n again changed. It
is understood the primary cause is un
certainty In respect to the movements
of the Spanish fleet. The blockading
squadron hat been greatly ,'eakened by
the departure of vessels with Admiral
Sam son, and althoug . there are still
i^Lout forty-five American ships in the
neighborhood of Cuba, tl-2 return of
Admiral Sampson with the rest of the
fleet will be awaited before attacking
the city.
Several important changes will also
be made in the r.rmy now gathered in
the vicinity of Tampa before the in
vasion of Cuban territory. The War
Department wants to feel confident
that the troops will be able to defeat
the Spaniards in one quick and de
cisive battle.
A long consultation was held yester
day by the leaders of bot:. army and
navy, and I am told that the exact
plan of campaign was finally decided
upon. General Shatter, Colonel W. H.
Lawton and Captain Dorst held a con
ference yesterday at Tampa, when the
entire Cuban situation was carefully
talked over, and plans for landing
troops d- ided upon. Captain Dorst
went into the interior of Cuba and has
made definite arrangements with Gen
eral Gomez for the co-operation of
United States and Cuban land forces.
There is a strong p r ba' lity that the
invading army will be in two divisions.
General Lee will undoubtedly command
one of these divisions, and either Gen
eral Coppinger o- General Wade the
other. The entire army will be under
command of Major General Shafter.
NO YELLOW FEVER ON
THE CRUISER NASHVILLE
KEY "WEST, May B.â Considerable in
dignation is expressed here over the
story lately sent north that there is
yellow fever on the Nashville, con
tracted from the Spanish prize Ar
gonauta. The captain and officers of
the ship as well as Commandant For
sythe of the naval ptation, brand it in
unmeasured terms as false and with
out foundation.
Interesting details are being added to
the story of the entrant^ " 'VÂ« French
frigate Dubourdieu into Havana yester
day. It is said that after the fleet re
leased her she was seen transmitting
heliograph signals to the Cuban shore.

BAKERSFIELD, May B.â Thomas Will

broke his neck.
THERE IS
MORE WORK
FOR DEWEY
But He Will Not Proceed
Until the Troops
Arrive. ,
Several Forts Remain on the
Philippines Which the Fleet
Must Soon Reduce.
NEW YORK May B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
In anticipation of the dispatch of troops
to Manila, the Commissary General of
Subsistence has directed the prepara
tion and shipment to San Francisco of
60,000 rations, sufficient to last 5000 men
four months.
The cruiser Charleston, It was defi
nitely determined by the Naval War
Board to-day, will not start for the
Philippines before next week, so that
she will act as a convoy to the troops
and supply ships.
Acting Admiral Dewey, the conqueror
of Manila, still has considerable work
to perform before the destruction of
Spanish power in the Far East is com
plete. Iloilo, capital of the Island of
Panay, which is fortified and gar
risoned by Spanish troops, remains to
be taken, and there are one or two
points in the Philippines which the
guns of his fleet will be called upon to
reduce. Confident, however, that
Spain's power in the Philippines has
been broken by the victory of Manila,
the authorities have directed Rear
Admiral Dewey t, remain with his
squadron in the harbor, where he is
now anchored, until the troops which
will be sent to his assistance reach
their destination.
As an encouragement to the officers
under Dewey's command to continue
their gallant work, I understand that
there is some talk in official circles of
the advisability of rewarding their
bravery by promoting them.
Section 1506 of the Revised Statutes
provides that "any officer of the navy
may, by the President with consent of
the Senate, be advanced not exceed
ing thirty numbers in rank, for eminent !
and conspicuous conduct in battle or
extraordinary heroism; and the rank of j
the officers shall not be changed, ex- j
cept in accordance with the provisions
of existing law and by and with the
advice and consent of the ienate."
If the President, as now seems highly
probible. takes ~d vantage of the au
thority conferred upon him b. this law
it will be possible for him immediately
to promote Captain Frank Wildes,
co ?..aÂ».Jing the Boston, to flag rank;
to jump Captain J. U. Coghlan, com
manding the Raleigh, from No. 34 on
the list of captains to No. 4; Captain '
C. V. Gridley, commanding the Olym
pia, to No. 5, and Captain N. M.
Dyer from No. 40 to 10. There are two
officers of the grade of commander in
cornmanl of ships of the Asiatic sta
tion, Commander Asa Walker, in com
mand of the Concord, and Commander I
E. P. Wood, commanding th~ Petrel, j
Commander Wall r is now No. 40 on i
the list of officers of his grade, and if !
he should be nominated for advance
ment he -M be promoted to the tenth
point, while Commander Wood would
be. made th-"> forty-fifth officer of the
grad_ of commander, instead of the |
seventy-fifth. It is not likely that any- i
thing will be done by the President |
with reference to the officers of the
Asiatic squadron until the mail reports i
from Rear Admiral Dewey are re
ceived.

REVOLUTION IS THREATENED IN ITALY
ITALIAN
RIOT ENDS
IN BATTLE
Four Hundred Persons
Killed and a Thou=
sand Injured.
Desperate Conflict Between a
Mob and Troops on the
Streets of Milan.
LUGANO, Switzerland, May B.â lt
has been a terrible day at Milan. About
1 o'clock this afternoon a veritable
battle occurred In the Via Somtrairi.
' Thousands of tile and chimneys were
hurled from the roofs upon the troops,
who were compelled to retire.
A similar fight took place in the Via
Torino, and it is believed that no fewer
than 400 were killed and 1000 injured.
A Swiss merchant who has arrived
hare from Milan describes the events of
Saturday as completely anarchistical.
According: to his account, the leaders of
the agitation evidently had well ar
ranged plans. Columns of rioters
emerged from all the gates of the town
and congregated on a center, where
they rapidly constructed barricades.
When they were dislodged by _ the
troops they mounted to the roofs and
rained tiles and chimneys down upon
the soldiers.
The gates of the town were held by
troops in the evening and through the
night, so that workmen employed out
side were unable to return to their
homes. In this way the rising was de
prived of additional help from without.
During the night the city was in
complete darkness and funereal silence.
Artillery, cavalry and Infantry bivou
acked on the Piazza del Duoma. where
re-enforcements were constantly arriv-
Ing.
Late news this evening from Milan
says the Secolo has been seized and its
editor arrested. The postal telegTaph
offices have been closed and all dis
patches of mail stopped. The public
buildings are guarded and artillery has
been placed in position on the Piazza
del Duomo. Many fugitives from Mi
lan have crossed the frontier into the
canton of Tlcino. and to Fontana,
among them being the editor of the
Italia, del Popolo, the incriminated Re
publican paper, who eluded the police.
Eight thousand troops are quartered in
the city.
ROME, May B.â Another portion of
the 1873 reserves and a portion of the
reserves of 1874 have been iered to be
under arms by Tuesday. The city is
now quiet.
ROME, May B.â The Government's
dispatches received up to 6 p.
m- Bay tranquility prevails through
out the kingdom. At Milan the
rioters at the Porta Ticinez have
been completely suppressed; re
enforcements continue to reach the city
and many arrests have been made, but
General Tama has ordered all the fac
tories to reopen to-morrow.
Other dispatches from Milan report,
on the contrary, the erection of a fresh
barricade by riotous mobs in the Via
Bertani at the Porta Ticinez and the
Porta Garibaldi. According to these
accounts the troops are compelled to
use arms to disperse the rioters, and a
lieutenant and several soldiers were
grounded.
Generally speaking, the agitation con
tinues, but it is less intense. The au
thorities have ordered all Socialist and
Republican clubs to dissolve. There is
a rumor current that the rioters have
driven back a train under the impres
pion that It was conveying soldiers.
Lieutenant General Bava Beccaris,
Commanding the Third Army Corps
<Milan), telegraphed the Marquis di
Ttudlni, the Premier, this evening,
Baying:
"The revolt In Milan has been sup
pressed and all resistance is now
ended."
LONDON. May B.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily News says:
Lieutenant - General Bava - Beccaris
wired from Milan at 6 o'clock this even-
Ing (Sunday):
"After new and serious attempts, the
rebellion has been quelled by fusillades
and cannonades and perfect calm has
been restored. I have ordered the
Shops and manufactories to be opened
to-morrow."
Later he telegraphed: "Unfortunately
fresh attemots at rebellion have been
made, and he cannons are still roaring,
but It will soon be over."
Court-martial will be constituted at
Milan to-morrow (Monday) to judge
the rioters arrested. I learn that the
rioters of yesterday thrice unsuccess
fully attacked the general telegraph
office at Milan with a view of cutting
off the city when all other expedients
failed. General Bava-Beccaris used
cannon to destroy the barricades, and a
number (about 100) were killed on
Saturday.
The Government has established the
severest censorship in revising and
stopping all dispatches containing what
it considers danperous matter. I learn,
however, that the rioters at Milan suc
ceeded to-day (Sunday) in occupying
the central station and delaying the
departure of reveral trains.
General Bava-Beccaris now ha.Â» su
preme power. No praise couM be too
high for the discipline, endurance ami
jat'ence ol the soldie s under the most
trying conditions. Not ona moved a
finger until the command was given,
eltboufeh almost all were Injurod Oy
flying missiles, some bleed.y badly.
Soon the fight from the Core:> Vcnezla
spiead all over the center of the town
to the Piazza del Duomo, the Via Ter
rino, the Via Carlo Alberto and the Via
Ordfld were centers of riot. Oaa oaemed
to hare returned to the famous days
of 1848, with the rattle of caval.-/, the
incessant cracking of rifles, thJ dis
cordant cries and words of command
and the bugle signals. Full particulars
are not known as they are not allowed
to pass, but surprising was the quick
ness with which the barricades were
formed in popular quarters, especially
on the bridges over the canals. Carts,
carriages and street cars were over
turned and piled up with furniture
from the adjacent buildings, to the
noisy joy of the crowd.
Distressing scenes occurred all over
the city â wives searching for husbands
and mothers for sons, with explosions
of grief after vain search or when find
ing them wounded or dead. In the pop
uiar quarters the mob resisted until
nightfall.
It is said that no such serious oc
! currence has taken place before in
Italy. The events have even surpassed
i the terrible riots in Turin, when the
! capital was transferred to Florence.
: General Bava-Beccaris showed how he
felt his responsibility and acted
promptly, firmly and energetically. In
fact, before night the troops had de
' stroyed all the barricades and were
, camping in the streets and squares. No
part of the city was without its com
plement of troo"ps. while from the sur
rounding provinces re-enforc;ments
were sent in immense numbers, wlost
iof the English and American people
i left Florence on account of the riots.

CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL
PARK, Ga., May 8. â It was given out
officially to-day that 40,000 of the volun
teer army will be mobilized just as soon
as they have been mustered into the
Government service. With the ten reg
iments of regulars now here filled to
war strength, the army at this point
will number 50,000. It was also an
nounced that Major General Fitzhugh
Lee, Major General Joe Wheeler and
Major General James H. Wilson would
be in command, the purpose being to
form the volunteer men into three
army corps.
The following recently appointed
Brigadier Generals, ex-colonels of the
regular army, have been assigned to
the volunteer army here: A. S. Burke,
late of the Twenty-fifth Infantry; Gen
eral Sumner, late Colonel of the Third
Cavalry; General Snyder, Colonel of
the Ninth Infantry. Other assignments
can be expected at any moment.
The first installment of equipments
for recruits arrived to-day and was
distributed. Recruits are now com
ing in rapidly. One hundred reached
here to-day, and information from re
cruiting officers is to the effect that all
the recruits required will be obtained
in a comparatively short time.
It has been decided to locate the camp
of the volunteer army on the west side
of Lafayette Road, near Chickamauga
Creek, and a force of men has been at
work preparing the ground and get
ting it ready for occupancy. The rail
road company will begin to-morrow
putting in an additional spar and erect
ing additional depots for handling of
recruits and their equipage.

SONOMA'S MEMORIAL CHURCH
Methodism Gains a Model House of Worship Through
One Man's Generosity,
SONOMA, May B.â Rev. Owen E. Holte, pastor of the Memorial M. E.
Church, preached an interesting sermon in the new edifice to-day. The
church was dedicated on Sunday last with appropriate services.
This is one of the early churches of California, having been built In
1853. It was removed and rebuilt in 1893, and in December, 1897, the contract
was let for additions and for remodeling the entire structure. This work
has been done through the generosity of Mr. James McMakin. Mr. Mc-
Makin is one of the very early settlers of Sonoma Valley, and haa been
prominent in its history and as a business man in San Francisco as well
during the past fifty years.
This beautiful church is a fitting tribute to his character and to that of
his deceased wife, who will long be remembered in the valley for her charit
able life.
Mr. and Mrs. Merriam gave the church a $500 organ, and Mrs. Merriam,
the daughter of Mr. McMakin, has put in two very handsome memorial
windows in memory of her father and mother. Several other expensive art
glass windows have been put in; one for Judge Shattuck and one for
Judge Ackers.
the present administration, as the in
surgents of the Philippines are quite

islands for the United States as soon as
he receiver, the necessary troops and
supplies from San Francisco.

Spanish Ship Sunk With All on Board
for Opening Fire After Hav
ing Surrendered.
LONDON, May 9.â The Hongkong
correspondent of the Daily Mail gives
the following additional details of the
battle of Manila.
"There was an act of treachery on
the part of the Spanish ship which
lowered her flag and then fired at a
boat's crew sent to take possession of
her. She did not hit the boat, but our
guns were turned on her and tore her
to pieces. She went to the bottom with
all on board. Several vessels close in
shore behaved in the same way and
shared her fate."

PRAISE FOR THE HERALD
AND CALL SERVICE
Only Accurate Description of the
Great Battle Was Written by
Their Correspondents.
NEW YORK, May B.â The Herald to
morrow will say: "The graphic ac
count of the battle of Manila, which the
Herald published yesterday from its
special correspondent, who stood beside
Commodore Dewey on the bridge of the
flagship Olympia during the entire en
gagement, is followed this morning by
another important dispatch cabled by
our correspondent from Hongkong,
and giving additional details, which
will be read everywhere with absorbing
interest. It is a most timely sequel to
the unparalleled dispatch which the
Herald printed yesterday, and which
gave to the public of two hemispheres
the only full, detailed and accurate de
scription published of the great naval
battle written by an eye-witness in the
thick of the fight.
"That this is the verdict of the press,
as well as of naval experts and the gen
eral public, is shown by the i inions <. !
newspapers from the Atlantic sea
board to the Pacific Coast, which were
printed this morning. Thus the New
Orleans Picayune pronounces it as the
'only complete account received by any
American newspaper,' while the Chi
cago Times - Herald says that
compared with this report all others
published by our contemporaries were
insignificant and incomplete and made
up in padding what they lacked in
facts.'
"The San Francisco Call speaks In
the same enthusiastic strain. 'Thug
another triumph,' it declares, 'has been
achieved by the Herald's news service,
which, for the purpose of gathering and
disseminating news of the war with
Spain is now without a competitor wor
thy of being called a rival.' To which
the St. Louis Republic aptly adds: 'It
was natural that Commodore Dewey
should cable his appreciation to the
Herald.' "
TRAIN PLUNGES DOWN
A STEEP EMBAVKMENT.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May B.â By the ac
cidental turning of a switch here this af
ternoon an excursion train from the Ak
ron road was wrecked, three cars shat
tered and one man, Rizen Fry of Louis
ville, Ohio, killed and two others were
injured.
The train had come in from the east
and the south in the morning; with visit
ors to Camp Bushnell, in this city, and
was one of thirty-seven trains which
came in as specials during the day. It
had seventeen cars packed to the guard.
As the engine left the track it plowed
down a steep embankment and turned
over In a ditch. The engineer and fire
man escaped with slight injury by
jumping.
As the engine rolled over it pulled with
it three of the cars, which were com
pletely destroyed. The first was turned
on its side in the ditch and the frightened
passengers were pinned to their seats, af
ter having been given considerable shak
ing. The second car landed against a
freight on the side track ar.d was split
open, while the third car was torn from
its trucks. When the concussion oc
curred Rizen Fry was standing on the
back platform of the first car. Constans
Hoeffler and Fred Bickerhoff of Louis
ville was painfully bruised. Several
others were slightly scratched.
TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE
LOSE THEIR DWELLINGS
DULUTH, Minn., May : Fifty frame
buildings in Minnesota Point, just above
the ! ship canal, were burned this â¢ after
noon. An hour after the fire started 2000
people were homelss. The fire took twelve
frame store buildings fronting. on lower
Lake avenue, just below the "Under the
Hill", district, and swept from there back
to the lake shore. The district was popu
lated by the poorest people in the city. ,
â¢ There was no particularly large individ
ual losses. The total is .. thought to be
over $100,000. Among the sufferers were
fifty : families of Jews/members of a col

the war with ' Spain. - There were ; narrow
escapes from death, but it is believed that
, everybody, was rescued.
SAN JOAQUIN
BOYS OFF TO
THE FRONT
At Stockton Ten Thousand
People Cheer as They
Depart.
Great Demonstrations Through
out the Valley in Honor of
the Volunteers,
STOCKTON, May B.â Sunday in the
San Joaquln Valley la usually a day of
rest and worship. To-day the church
bells, which In peace call to divine ser
vice, rang out an adieu to the soldier
boys of the Sixth Regiment on the way
to do or die at their country's call.
Through the valley, from Fresno thun
dered a train over the Valley Road, on
its sides the inscription, "Remember
the Maine." At every station bells
were rung and ovations given thd boys
aboard. Eight coaches were filled with
the full companies of visalia, Fresno
and Merced.
An hour before their arrival here
Companies A and B of Stockton, with
regimental officers, the Grand Army
post, school children and county of
ficials moved on foot alon~ Jalifornia
street headed by a band. Church bells
joined in the acclaim, and when the
train arrived anvils and whistles
greeted the country boys. The 500 men
were reviewed by officers before the
line of march was taken up to the wa
ter front.
Ten thousand people greeted the
soldiers and their escorts when Main
street was reached. Truly, it was a
warlike scene. It was with difficulty
that the police cleared the streets for
the troops to pass. Flowers and cheer
ful good-byes were showered upon the
men.
At the water front where the boat
was waiting, the people were massed
for blocks, and there final good-byes
were said. The scenes at the parting
were pathetic in some cases and cheer
ful in others. Where one woman
fainted another was seen to give her
husband an approving tap on the
shoulder and an encouraging word.
This caught the spirit of the crowd
and the cheers which greeted the wo
man's pluck, drowned the strains of
"Yankee Doodle" with which the band
was inspiring the crowd.
Once on the boct the troops were ad
dressed by local orators, and the cap
tain blew his whistle in vain for all but
the passengers to leave. The volun
teers were cheered by the vast throngs
on the wharves and the echo came back
in thunderous volume. At 8 o'clock the
boat got under way and music and guns
gave a final eend-off. The boys
swarmed on the decks and handker
chief signals were waved until the boat
disappeared in the darkness of the
channel. t
The boat with its 500 recruits will
make slow time to-night, and, it is cal
culated, will arrive at San Francisco
at about 6 o'clock in the morning.
FRESNO, May B.â Company C, N. G.
C, which left by the Valley road at 2
o'clock this afternoon, to be mustered
into regular service, was given a fare
well demonstration which surpassed
any public celebration ever held in
Fresno. Thousands of people were in
the city from neighboring towns. Flags
were everywhere to be seen, stirring
music filled the air, and the boys in
blue were cheered all along the line to
the depot. Martha Lodge, A. O. U. W.,
gave a farewell luncheon in the armory,
and at the depot General Kittrell made
a ringing speech to the departing
guardsmen. The whole crowd gathered
at the station to witness the leave-tak-
ing.
Company C was escorted to the train
by Company F, the only company in
the Sixth Regiment not called out, and
the boys seemed very much disappoint
ed at having been slighted. The Hun
dred Thousand Club and Union, and
Confederate Veterans were in line. At
the station little children pinned bou
tonnieres on the breasts of the soldier
boys. When the train pulled out there
was vociferous and prolonged cheering,
waving of handkerchiefs and shedding
of tears by loved ones left behind. The
Visalia and Bakersfield companies were
on the train and they were given a
rousing reception.
Company F marched back to the ar
mory, looking dejected at being left
at home. It is said Governor Budd did
not call out Company F because its re
port was not satisfactorily made out.
The company is one of the best in the
regiment and to-morrow the field offi
cers of the regiment will have a per
sonal interview with the Governor to
try to induce him to complete the regi
ment by sending for Company F.
VSALIA, May 8. â Thousands of peo
ple from all over the country collected
here to-day to give Company E a rous
ing reception and escort it to the Val
ley road depot on its way to San Fran
cisco to be mustered into the service.
Ninety-three officers and men compose
the company that started at noon for
Stockton under Captain Stewart, who
has given up his position In the United
States Land Office here to lead his men
to war.
Never was there more patriotism dis
played than over this departure of the
home guard. The citizens turned out
en masse. Lodges, fire companies, old
soldiers and city officials joined the
parade that escorted the boys to the
train. One notable feature of the par
ade was the mar hing side by side of
Union and Confederate veterans.
School children by hundreds marched
with flagrs and flowers. Tulare sent
over its band and a train-load of peo
ple to assist in the demonstration. The
Valley road train was decorated with
flags and buntii , and on each Bide
of the car containing most of the
guards was a banner on which was
painted in large letters "Remember the
Maine."
BAKERSFIELD, May B.â Company
G, Sixth Regiment, Jnety-two strong,
departed at 7:30 this morning for San
Francisco. It marched to the depot
shortly after 5 o clock, led by two brass
bands and folio r ed by hundreds of
people, the crow increasing to sev
eral thousands before the departure of
the company. All came to oi2er a fond
farewell to soldier friends and rela
tives. It was difficult to tell which was
most plentiful, tears or flowers. Each
soldier was loaded down with floral to
kens.
The Impressive scene was climaxed
by the formal presentation to the com
pany of a most beautiful silken ban
ner by the ladles of Bakersfield. Hon.
T. TV. I ckhart made the presentation
speech, and so thrilling was his elo
quence that there was hardly a dry
eye in the great throng. Captain Cook
responded, and, while he lays no claim
to being a speaker, the crowd ap
plauded wildly every sentence he ut
tered.
The coaches in which the company
rode were beautifully decorated with
flowers and the national colors. As
the train pulled out, the boys waved
their caps from the windows, which
called forth a mighty yell from the
crowd.
AUBURN, May 8. â Dewey's great
naval victory was celebrated here last
night by the booming of cannon and
other displays of patriotic enthusiasm.
Edward Lochre, wwhilew T hile handling a giant
cap, was quite badly injured, and may
lose an eye.
SACRAMENTO, May B.â Company E.
Second Regiment, N. G. C, left for San
Francisco at 2 o'clock this afternoon to
enter the volunteer service of the Unit
ed States. Probably 10,000 people turned
out to see the boys off, and a continu
ous demonstration was conducted along
the line of march. The city officials,
led by Mayor Land, marched in the pa
rade, as did also the local military or
ganizations and the Grand Army posts.
INFANTRY AND
ARTILLERY.
One of the pleasing incidents in connec
tion with the arrival of Company E, Sec
ond Infantry, and Battery B, Heavy Ar
tillery, from Sacramento last night was
the expression of patriotism shown by
the Servian Benevolent Society, who met
the troops at the ferry as the society
was returning- from a picnic and barbecue
held at Sausalito.
The society, accompanied by a brass
band, escorted the troops to their quar
ters, corner of Tenth and Market streets,
where the honors of a passing salute
were tendered. Company E was later
transferred to the armory, corner of Page
and Gough streets, where the two com
panies from the Sixth Infantry also are
quartered.
All of the infantry have been amply
provided with blankets and are reason
ably well cared for, having no complaint
to make of their treatment after arriv
ing here. Battery B, however, did not
fare so well and the men have already
commenced to realize the rigors o.* a
soldier's life in the service of his country.
They complain of a scarcity of blankets
and many of them will be able, hereafter,
to tell the difference between a nice soft
bed and the soft side of a hard board
from practical experience.
The officers and men of Company E,
Second Infantry, Sacramento, are:
Captain John F. Lucey, First Lieutenant J.
A. McMartln. Second Lieutenant J. L. Hughes,
First Sergeant W. D. Bessey; Sergeants George

SACRAMENTO. May B.â An alarm

A few minutes before the alarm a
mighty volume of flame shot up

There were a hundred people on Fifth

came thundering along.
The Metropolitan Theater is a com

From Mrs. A. "W. Smith, 59 Summer
St., Biddeford, Me.:
"For several years I suffered with
various diseases peculiar to my sex.
Was troubled with a burning sensation
across the small of my back, that all-
gone feeling, was despondent, fretful
and discouraged; the least exertion
tired me. I tried several doctors but
received little benefit. At last I de-
cided to give your Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound a trial. The ef-
fect of the first bottle was magical.
Those symptoms of weakness that I
was afflicted with, vanished like vapor
before the sun. I cannot speak too
highly of your valuable remedy. It is
truly a boon to woman."
From Mrs. Melissa Phillips, Lex-
ington, Ind., to Mrs. Pinkham:
"Before I began taking your medicine
I had suffered for two years with that
tired feeling, headache, backache, no ap-
petite, and a run-down condition of the
system, I could not walk across the
room. I have taken four bottles of the
Vegetable Compound, one box of Liver
Pills and used one package of Sanative

Volunteer Troops at the Presidio Receive
Their Friends.
Friendly Interest Manifested by the Regularsâ More Soldiers
Arrive From the Interior.
The camps of the First and Seventh
Regiments of Volunteers was the
Mecca toward which San Francisco
turned yesterday, and from early morn-
Ing until retreat sounded and camp
was closed at night, civilians of all
ages and both sexes paid homage to the
brave boys In blue.
During the morning hours the guards
endeavored to keep the sightseers
without the regimental lines, but so
many had journeyed out to see friends
and relatives in the ranks, that finally
Colonels Smith and Berry concluded to
relax discipline somewhat and allow
their men to receive their friends. The
result was that everybody on the res
ervation flocked Into the company
streets and the men found that Sun
day afforded them but little chance to
rest.
The members of the two regiments
early begun to fraternize, and the most
cordial relations soon existed. They
exchanged visits, discussing the
chances of being called in -^ active ser
vice, and speculatinr on which regi
ment would be the first to start for
Manila. The regulars, too, found much

to interest them at the camp, and those !
who were nut on guard duty spent
most of the day with the volunteers.
They were heartily welcomed, and or- |
dera were issued allowing them to come j
and go whenever they saw tit.
The youngsters were anxious to profit
by the experience of the regulars, who
gave them much valuable advice re- j
gardlng camp life. They took the
volunteers in hand, taught them how j
ild their blankets recording to ;
regulations, open up the tents and in
numerable other little things the men
must learn, and when once learned add
materially to their comfort and wel
fare.
During the forenoon Generals Dickin-
Bon and Barrett, Colonel Burgin of the ;
Governor's staff. Colonels Macdonald, ;
Miles, duff, Stanley and Barrere and j
Major Duhrmann of the National
Quard called upon Colonels Smith and ,
Berry at their headquarters, and later i
in the day Colonel Miller, Third Ar- j
tillery, accompanied by Lieutenants
Barol and Woodward, Lieutenant '.
â¢1 MorriÃS, Fourth Cavalry, with
Lieutenant Nolan* rode over from the
barracks and paid their respects to the
officers of the two regiment. Captain
Baldwin of the Commissary Depart- !
ment also visited the camp and dis
cussed the problem of feeding the men
and the officers.
Thus the good feeling between reg
ulars and volunteers â officers and
men â which began on aturday," was j
more firmly established. The regular!
officers are loud in their praise of the
personnel of the two regiments, and do
not hesitate to say that the officers
field, staff and line â are most efficient, i
They recognize the fact that with so i
recruits who have absolutely no !
knowledge of military duties or discip- i
line, the volunteer officers have a hard j
task before them in converting the raw
material into perfect lighting ma
chines, but they are satisfied that they
are fully equal to the task.
On the other hand Colonels Smith
and Berry, and their subordinate offi
cers, keenly appreciate the good will
manifested toward them by the regu
lar officers, and thank their good for
tune In being quartered so close to the
Third Artillery and Fourth Cavalry.
They are particularly indebted to Cap
tain Carrington and Lieutenant Nolan
for the able manner in which those two
officers have performed the onerous du
ties placed upon them.
Captain Carrington has labored al
most unceasingly by day and night
since he received his first orders from
Washington to muster In the troops,
and the rapidity with which he has per
formed the work has excited the admi
ration of every officer and man in the
National Guard. Every moment he
was not engaged, yesterday, in super
intending the â¢ insterlng in of the artll
lerv batteries. Captain Carrington put
in at the camp conferring with the
commanding officers and arranging for
the accommodation of the additional
troops. In the afternoon he had the
battery from Sacramento sent out to
the barracks for examination, and he
i=s now ready to handle the two Infantry
battalions when they arrive to-day.
As for Lieutenant Nolan, he has
earned everlasting gratitude for the
manner in which he dispatched rations
and camp equipage to the troops after
their arrival at the Presidio. It is no
small job to provide for 2000 men. even
if given ample time, but Lieutenant
Nolan undertook it at a moment's no
tice and performed the work most
satisfactorily. The only thing that
bothered him Saturday was to get
bread. Flour there was in plenty, but
there were no dutch ovens to bake in,
and the accommodations at the Pre
sidio Barracks were entirely inade
quate. However, he overcame that dif
ficulty yesterday by contracting with
downtown bakers to deliver a sufficient
quantity of bread daily to satisfy the
demand v.til other arrangements can
be made. Camp ovens will be provided,
and Colonel Smith has discovered a
first-class cook in his regiment who
will be detailed to educate a number of
men in the art of bread-baking. Colo
nel Berry will also adopt this plan, and
In a few days the men will partake of
bread of their own making.
It was amusing to watch the boys
preparing their meals over the field
stoves, which are not intended for the
preparation of fancy dishes. Most of
the boys are only amateur cooks at
best, and their struggles with refrac
tory steaks, jacketed potatoes and wash
boilers filled with steaming coffee
taught their civilian friends a highly
prized object lesson in camp life.
One thousand pairs of blankets were
issued to the soldiers Saturday, in ad
dition to those they took into camp, so
they have no trouble on that score. To
most of them It came rather hard to
roll up in their blankets on the hard
ground. Yesterday a large quantity of
straw was hauled from the barracks,
and last night the boys were made more
comfortable.
The greatest annoyance the soldiers
have to endure is the dust. The camp
is located on the eastern extremity of
the immense drill ground that is des
titute of vegetation and across which
the wind sweeps with almost hurricane
force. The tramping of the great
crowds yesterday ground the top cover
ing of clay and the sand underneath
into dust, which was blown in stifling
clouds over the camp, filling the tents
and causing the men to comment audi
bly on the weather. ..
Colonel Morris, when he visited the
camp, was quick to observe this disa
greeable feature, and informed the offi
cers that he would send the post

The First Regiment has already sub

at the camp as soon as the requisitions
have been approved and filled. To-day
the Seventh, after being mustered Into
the United States service, will, through
its quartermaster, submit similar requi
sitions for supplies.
Captain Baldwin, the purchasing
commissary in this city, is shipping a
large quantity of rations to the post
commissary at the Presidio, who will
issue them to the volunteer troops as
required. The contractor who furnishes
fresh beef at the Presidio will also sup
ply fresh beef to the camp.
The volunteers are armed with tne
"Springfield, .45," and although It
may not be the highest form of mili
tary rifle extant. Its accuracy has for
years been the boast and pride of the
army in every field that has heard its
bark. Even to-day among military
men it will, without doubt, hold Its
place as the best shooting piece at all
practicable distances.
The State tentage now In use at the
camp is not in the best of condition.
The wall tents used by the officers and
the common tents used by the enlisted
men will soon be replaced by new tents
to be issued by the Government from
stock now on hand, or to be made, at
the general depot of the Quarter
master's Department, 36 New Mont
gomery street. In addition to this sup
ply of wall and common tents, each
man will be issued a half-shelter tent.
These tents are about six feet long and
are used exclusively for actual field ser
vice.
A regular army officer was heard to
remark yesterday, when asked what he
thought of California's volunteers:
"I am greatly surprised to see the ma
terial of w'-ich the California National
Guard is composed. This looks more
like a camp of regulars than a camp of
volunteers."
This morning a battalion of the
Fourteenth United States Infantry,
commanded by Major Charles F.
Robe, U. S. A., will arrive from "Van
couver Barracks, Washington.: It is
expected that these tr- ops will tem
porarily occupy the barracks made va
cant by the transfer of the First United
States Infantry to Tampa, Fla. The
battalion consists of Companies C. L),
E and F officered by Captains WU
liam M. McCammon, Frank Taylor and
John Murphy; Lieutenants William S.
Biddle, James Mitchell, Charles R.
Krauthoff, P. L. Miles and Ora E.
Hunt.
General Thomas M. Anderson, with
the headquarters band, and Companies
A and E, Fourteenth Infantry, sta
tioned at Skaguay, Alaska, have re
ceived instructions from General
Henry C. Merriam, commanding the
Departments of the Columbia and Cali
fornia, to proceed without delay to
Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and
thence to San Francisco. General
Anderson, who was recently appointed
brigadier general, will be placed in
command of the regulars and volun
teers encamped at the Presidio. He
will form a brigade of the troops con
centrated in San Francisco.
Captain Carrington has received or
ders from Washington to organize a
hospital corps for the volunteers, con
sisting of two stewards, two acting
stewards and fifty-eight privates. The
First already has an excellent sanitary
corps in the field under the supervision
of its surgeons, and this will be used
as the nucleus for the new corps.' The
Seventh also has a fine corps of
twenty-three men, all of whom are
practicing physicians, druggists or
students. This corps was not brought
up with the regiment, much to the dis
appointment of the members who had
disposed of their practice or business
in anticipation of bei*-- called Into ser
vice.
When Captain Carrington received
his orders, he conferred with Surgeon
General Hopkins, and the latter, after
a brief talk with Colonel Berry, tele
graphed to Los Angeles to the corps
to come to L>a-^ Francisco at once, and
the men will start this morning. They
will be added to the corps, which, Cap
tain Carrineton thinks, will be one of
the most efficient ever organized.
DOINGS OFTHE FIRST
An Eventful Day to the Vol
unteers in Camp at the
Presidio.
Promptly at s:4s o'clock yesterday morn
ing the long and unbroken rattle of the
drums sounding the first call for reveille
awoke the soldiers of the First Regiment
of the United States California Volun
teers to their second day of duty. At the
first tap of the drum the men turned out
from their camps with the alacrity and
precision of regulars. Ten minutes later
the call was sounded for company forma
tion and the men fell In and answered
their names to the sergeant's roll-call.
Then followed a short drill in the manual
of arms, and at 6:10 o'clock the men and
officers sat down to their first breakfast
in camp with such appetites as they had
never had before. At 7 o'clock the sick
call was sounded, and these of the men
who needed a physician's attention r>Â»Â»
ported to the hospital, where Captain
Rethers and his corps of wide-awake
assistants were ready to prescribe for
them.
yesterday brine Sunday there was a
church call at 10 o'clock, and those who
desired to do so were permitted to attend
church, being issued passes so that they
could j?et through the lines. Guard
mounting was at 8:45 o'clock, and the as
sembly was sounded fifteen minutes later
The routine duties of camp life made the
forenoon pass very rapidly, and when the
call for dinner was sounded at noon men
and officers alike were only too glad to
partake of the substantial meal that
Uncle Sam provided for them.
Just as the sun sank to rest out beyond
the blue waters of the Golden Gate and
the evening gun from Fort Point boomed
out its salute to the flae, retreat was
sounded and the men gathered in their
respective company streets to prepare for
supper, which was served a half hour
later. After supper until tattoo the men
amused themselves by visiting each other
in their tents, singing songs, telling jokes
and availing themselves of the many
things that help to brighten the life of the
men who serve in the ranks. At 10:45 the
call to quarters rang , out upon ; the night
air, and the noise and bustle ; of camp
life quieted down as the men sought their
tents preparatory to turning â¢in > for the
night. Promptly at 11 o'clock the wel
come sound . of taps was . blown and the
lights from many lanterns were imme
diately extinguished, and the quiet and
peace of night settled down upon the
sleeping soldiers. This is a brief outline
of the daily life of the volunteer soldiers
of (Tie First Regiment, who have sworn
allegiance to the Government and whom
Uncle Sam is rapidly turning into perfect
fighting machines.
The scenes in the camp at the Presidio
yesterday were such as will not soon be
forgotten by those who witnessed them.
Every man who wore the blue, it mat
tered not if there were no chevrons upon
his sleeves or straps upon his shoulders,
was a hero In some one's eyes. It may
have been a loving mother, a devoted
wife, an admiring sister or a faithful
sweetheart, but in every instance some
heart beat in sympathetic response to the
one beneath the blue, and while the sense
of separation was painful the knowledge
that the son, husband, brother or lover
was doing his duty more than recom
pensed for the heart's sacrifice and the
severing of sacred ties. Down in the
company streets the soldiers showed girls
through their quarters, while along offi
cers' row every possible courtesy and at
tention was shown by Colonel Smith and
his officers to the visitors. j
â¢ The men are rapidly getting into . the
ways of camp life and they take to the
exacting routine with ; the best of good
will and display the greatest desire to
master the many small details that make
up camp life. They have been supplied
with blankets, their rations are whole
some and bountiful, and in a few days
when everything has been placed upon a
perfect military basis of operations they
will have ceased to remember that they
were ever civilians. Colonel Smith, whom
the men have already dubbed "Fighting
Jim Smith," has shown such executive
ability and displayed such a genius for
managing military details that he has
only increased the love of the men and
officers and tneir confidence in and re
spect for him. â - â¢
Many of the men and officers came into
the city yesterday to see their families
and friends. Colonel Smith left the camp
in the morning for several hours and
Lieutenant. Colonel Duboce assumed com
mand during his absence. In the morn
ing Colonel Duboce, Surgeon Rethers
and Captain O'Neill made the inspection
of the camp and found everything in ex
cellent shape and condition, and the men
showed the greatest desire to acquire all
details regarding the placing of their
company streets and tents in shape.
Captain T. F. O'Neill, Company M, was
officer of the day yesterday, and Lieuten
ant O'Brien, Company H. officer of the
guard The guard consisted of thirty
eight privates, three corporals and ono
sergeant. The band quarters are just
back of Colonel Smith's tent, and the
kitchen and officers' mess is just to the
right of headquarters at the end of offi
cers' row. A telephone has been placed
in Colonel Smith's headquarters for the
use and convenience of the officers. The
guard tent had several prisoners In it
yesterday, but their offenses' were of a
minor nature, having been committed
largely through ignorance of military
Fill OS
One member of the regiment will be dis
charged on account of disability. He was
seized with an epileptic fit and it was
some time before he could be resuscitated.
He said it was not the first spasm he had
ever had but the surgeons think it would
be inadvisable to continue him in serv
ice, especially if the regiment is ordered
away. , â ' .

Colonel Smith issued an order yesterday
that in future the families and friends of
the enlisted soldiers should visit the camp
only on Tuesdays and' Fridays, between
2 and 3 o'clock. The order, the colonel
said, was not intended to cause any incon
venience to the relatives and friends of
the soldiers, but to give the men a chance
to attend to their duties without lnterrup-
Forty-seven cases of illness and acci
dents were reported to the hospital dur
ing the day. None of them were of a se
i nous character. ' Most of them were of
minor complaints due to the change in the
mode of living for the men. A few bruises
and trifling cuts due to slight accidents
were dressed.
THE NEED OF THE HOUR
Rev. Oliver C. Millar of the Church of
the Holy Spirit, 2127 Jackson street,
preached yesterday from the textâ l Cor.
xvi:l3: "Watch ye; stand fast in the faith,
quit you like men; be strong." In part he
said:
We must watch and fight as well as pray.
In thlÃ life nothing good is obtained or main
tained without contending for v Our text
is a quotation from the address of the Phil
istine general to his soldiers before going into
battl" "Be strong and quit yourselves like
men, that ye be not servants; quit yourselves
SiUe men and fight." What a soul-inspiring
summons it is, not to be servants while in
humanity and injustice triumph over u;>.
Sturdy manliness and supreme murage are the
need of the' nation to-day. These are not born
o' crmmercial life, nor during peace, 1.-it on
fcloi'dv battlefields. The stirm* admonition
of the Holy writ tpeaks to-day 10 our Imtir.ll:
â¢ 4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood strivlns
against sin. Bolh we as a nation and our ene
mies have sinned, and there :s only one thing
that will put away sin. and that is blood.
This is why we should believe In this w;>r.
It was inevitable. God sent it. and he will
accomplish his own purposes through It. It
has been now thirty-seven years since r,ur iant
war We read In the Book of Juiced this
PlÃntncant sentence: "And the land ir.vl rest
for forty years." This rest wa? thf> price ..f
flccovxd Peaceful pursuit Jo not give sym
metrical development to national life. After
periods of prosperity and rest, war seems to
become a necessity. The most lovlnÂ«r disciple
of Jesus has said: "Hereby perceive we the
love of God, because he laid down bis life for
us: we ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren." Again, speaking of the heroic
lives of the saints, the same disciple says:
â¢And they loved not their lives unto death.
Let us in the strength of Jehovah the God of
battle, defend the precious legacy of our
forefathers, who fought and labored that we
might enter into their labors. Everything pre
cious to the life of our nation was bought
with blood, and by blood it must be maintain
ed. Let us prove ourselves worthy to main
tain the blood-bought legacy of our heroic desJ.
But let ub be sure to go into the conflict with
prayer and with faith in God. as did our fore
lathers of whom it may well be said. me
world was not worthy." We must either Da
patriots or paupers. Let us not partake or
the blessings of liberty and not raise our
hand to maintain It. Let us flght for our
firesides ard our children, lest they be
scourged beneath the lash of inhumanity ano
oppression. Ours is a Just cause and there
fore has the promise of a just God. Let us
honor him and he will honor us. Give thanks
to him for our victories and ex-en the stars
in their courses that fought against Slsera
will fight for us. The essential principle of
the heroic life is faith; It catches sight of the
highest good and pursues it at all hazard.
America has a heroic ancestry, and dara
not degenerate under the influence of a cursed
money-getting, pleasure-loving spirit. Let us
catch the words shouted down the ages from a
myriad of heroic lips now speechless forever,
and yet never dying: "Quit you like men, bÂ«
strong!"
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
Extracts from a sermon preached by
Professor Warren H. Landon of the Theo
logical Seminary at San Aiiselmo in Cal
vary Presbyterian Church, San Francis
co yesterday from the textâ Mark xvi:ls:
"And he said unto them. Go ye into all
the world and preach the gospel to every
creature."
This was ChriÃt's last command. There Is
In It no home missions or foreign missions, as
distinguished one from the other, but the
evangelization of the entire world. If the Bible
knows anything about home or foreign mis
sionary work, that is home missions which lies
nearest Calvary, where Christ was crucified,
and where the Christian Church began, namely,
Syria, Persia and Egypt and the like, foreign
i mission countries being those more remote,
i such as this new continent upon which we live.
Missions originated with Christ. Dr. Van Dyke
lof New York has well said: "The missionary
enterprise Is not the church's afterthought. It
Is Christ's forethought. It Is not secondary
and optional. It Is primary and vital."
"All the world," says the text. "All na
tions," says Matthews' account. "All nations,
says Luke's gospel. "In Jerusalem and In all
Ju'dea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost
part of the earth," says the account in Acts.
j Either Christianity Is a religion for the entire
I world or its founder was mistaken.
But what has this last command of Christ to
do with us? What relation to us as Individuals?
What relation to us as a church? That depends
mainly upon our relationship to him who gave
the command.
Why have some men gone from California to
New Orleans and to Tampa, and are ready to
! sail for Cuba, while others of us remain In San
i Francisco attending regularly to our business
! as If there was no war with Spain? Because
i they had enlisted and were bound by their oath
to yield prompt obedience to the orders of their
commanding officers, whithersoever they were
pent. They enlisted not for service at home
or abroad, but for service wherever the Gov
ernment directed. So we see some bound for
Cuba. We see some bound on our naval vessels
for Porto Rico. We are likely to see some
! sailing for the Philippine Islands. It seems to
i me something like going Into all the world,
I some to the far east, some to the far west,
wherever the enemy Is, and wherever the Gov-
Inent directs. Where has there been any
tation? Where any lack of enthusiasm in
army or in the navy?
â¢ what rig-ht, then, do we Bit still when
;ays go? By what right do we halt when
â¢ays advance? I believe the whole church
Is* to ask the question, who is captain
i? Whence came the orders the Christian
is bound to obey? This is a missionary com
mand given by a missionary commander. The
great "go" of our text was spoken by one
who went first himself. The Son of God stayed
not In heaven to issue orders to go forth. He
came hither himself on a mission world-wide
in its scope. What battles he fought! What
victories he won!
Our nation is engaged at the present time
in a foreign mission enterprise. Why should
this nation be at war with Spain? She has
not raided our borders. She has made no un
just demands upon us. It was not for the
purpose of acquiring territory. Some of the
excitement which precipitated the conflict may
have been caused by so-called "Jingoism,"
some by "yellow Journalism"; but underneath
all is the spirit at work, a spirit of self-sacri
flrc for humanity's sake. This nation has
gone beyond Its own borders in the interest of
another people for humanity's sake. It is a
foreign mission enterprise under another name.
We are fighting, not for our own country, but
for another people, in whom we have some
commercial interest, but no other Important
interest except our interest In humanity, in
righteousness, in Justice. Well will it be If
there is awakened by this war a still deeper
and wider interest in humanity, an interest to
he shown not by sending out cruisers and bat
tleships, but by' sending forth in greater num
bers the embassadors of peace under the ban
ner of the cross, an interest to be shown by
withholding the evil and sending forth more
of the good, an interest to be shown as
the Congo convert would have It shown. He
wrote the following ietter to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, said to have been the first one
ever written in English by a Congo native:
"Great and Good Chief of the Tribes of Christ.
Greeting! The humblest of your servants kiss
es th*> hem of your garment and begs you to
send to his fellow servants more gospel and
Mi. In the bonds of Christ. Ugalla."
>s not only from England but also from
and other American ports to destroy

us but believes there ought to be a
obedience to the last command of
BOYS IN BLUE
ARE HONORED.
Owing to the fact that a number of the
young men of the First Christian Church
in this city have volunteered to go to the
war and that there is also on board the
battle-ship Oregon one of the young men
of the church, the congregation yester
day morning passed the following resolu
tion:
WHEREAS, The spirit of patriotism has
prompted some of the young men of our con
gregation, to wit: Brethren F. S. Brown, A.
C Wagner, Edward Norton and W. E. Flu
hart to respond to the call of our President for
volunteers to defend and uphold our beloved
lias in the cause of humanity: therefore
R.-solved, That it is with great regTet we see
these brethren so from us to expose them
selves to the dangers of war, though we can
but recognize the nobility of spirit which
prompts thorn thus to respond to their coun
try's call.
Resolved. That the sympathy and the pray
ers of this church are with these young men,
that God may protect them from the dangers
of war and return them to us in safety.
Resolved. That we commend them to God
and to the word of his grace, which !s able to
build them up and give them an inheritance
among all them that are sanctified.
Resolved, That these resolutions be spread
upon the records of the church and a copy
transmitted to each of these young mem
RED CROSS EXECUTIVE
MEETING.
OAKL.AND. May B.â Mrs. G. D. Abbott,
president of the Red Cross Society of this
city, has called a meeting of the execu
tive committee for Monday morning at 10
o'clock in the Ebell Society rooms. A
delegation from all affiliated societies
educational, beneficial, social and relig
ious organizationsâ are requested to be
present. They have issued a call for
comfort baps, good rending matter and
$2000 in cash for "the California Volunteers,
who, it is expected, will leave on Saturday
for Manila. Donations may be left at
Bowman's drug store, Broadway and
Ninth street, and Wheeler's grocery store,

PREPARING FOR
THE MATINEE.
The managers and attaches and per
formers of the Orpheum Theater are hard
at work preparing specialties for the
monster benefit performance to be given
on Thursday afternoon for the benefit of
the i.cd Cross fund. The members of the
orchestra will excel themselves on that
day Special music will be the order and
Director E. M. Rosner and Leader B.
Jaulus are already preparing selections
and arranging for rehearsals.
The musicians are enthusiastic and they
promise many startling features. The
Orpheum orchestra is well known to every
theater-goer In the city and it has never
been known to make a failure yet.
-THE CALL'S" PRAISES SUNG.
ALAMEDA, May B.â The San Francisco
Call was in gTeat demand in our city this
morning and all who were fortunate
enough to secure a copy were loud in
their praise of the grand achievement of
that paper in giving to the people such a
graphic pen picture of the great naval
engagement at Manila. The hand of the
paddist, so visible In the columns of its
contemporaries, could not be seen in The
Call's account, which came direct from
the â¢"n of an eye-witness who stood
upon*the bridge of the Olympia with the
gallant Commodore Dewey, throughout
the entire engagement.
A novel and simple cure for the head
ache la announced. It is for the sufferer
to walk backward tor about ten minutoa.

DID IT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU
That a man is judged as much by the
clothes he wears as from the company
he keeps? It is true: â But does that
account for the sudden appearance
recently of so many stylish, tasty and
comfortably dressed men on the
streets? â Not altogether: â If you will
pick out seven-tenths of the men you
meet wearing satisfaction's smile and
perfect- fitting clothes you will find,
upon inquiry, that they were fitted out
at our establishment.

OUR. GUNS AND BUSINESS.
WHEN Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet in
Manila harbor a week ago he did more than
sink a dozen men-of-war and batter down as
many forts. He gave trade throughout the United
States a mighty stimulus, which is just becoming ap
parent. All commercial reports from the East now
abound with allusions to the impetus given to all
sorts of business by those deadly American guns. In
the first place, as soon as the result of the battle
became known there was an influx of buying orders
in Wall street for both long and short accounts,
London being a large buyer, and we are told that
"a new sense of national strength and energy was
immediately developed, and that the commercial com
munity has come to the conclusion that the possible
effects of the war have already been discounted, ex
cept perhaps in a few lines."
Nor is this all. Industries have received a wonder
ful stimulus from the conviction that the war will not
last long, and that it will go our way. Besides the
great demand for steel plates and other iron products
an.l ammunition the Government has ordered 2,500,
000 yards of woolen cloths, 125,000 blankets, 3,000.000
yards of cotton goods and great quantities of provi
sions and other supplies, and meanwhile reviving con
fidence has multiplied other demands. In addition
to these items the iron trade has been stimulated by
large orders for the construction of warships and
merchantmen for foreign countries. Those works
which produce steel rails, plates, farming utensils, etc.,
are being pushed to their utmost capacity, and some
are refusing orders. Textile works have also r-nreived
heavy orders besides those from the Government, and
the wool market Is showing the effects of this by
more steadiness than it has exhibited for some time,
with a slight increase in sales. The sensational ad
vance in wheat also helps things along, for high
wheat always goes hand in hand with general pros
perity.
All these things tend to revivify trade throughout
the whole country. The railroads seÂ«m to be deriving
their share of the benefits, for there has been an aver
age advance in railroad shares of $2 70 since that
little exhibition of Americanism in Manila harbor a
few days ago. The business failures are again
smaller, those for the week being 240, against 245 for
the preceding week. The bank clearings, however,
dropped down to a gain of only 5 per cent over the
same week last year, this being the smallest increase
for some time. Still we are told by Bradstreet's that
"evidences accumulate that the corner has finally been
turned in the trade situation, and that circumstances
which have hitherto been regarded as disquieting
have begun to give way to more cheerful conditions
or are beginning to be recognized in a truer and more
reasonable light. While it is claimed, and perhaps
â with justice in many cases, that the changes yet noted
are largely sentimental, and little that is tangible is
to be cited in the direction of improvement, it is not
to be forgotten that the dullness and even depression
ruling for some time past was likewise largely senti
mental and it is now beginning to be admitted by
many had even less of a basis to rest upon than the
present unmistakable signs of improvement."
So much for the country at large. On this coast
there are few new conditions observable. Wheat con
tinues to attract general attention by its ground and
lofty tumbling, the advance last week being sharp
enough to satisfy almost anybody. Merchandise con
tinues in steady demand and almost all fluctuations
are in the direction of higher prices. The staple gro
ceries are all firm, and higher figures are announced
for quicksilver, cordage and several kinds of oils, the
advance in the two first being directly caused by the
war. In produce we have an improved market for
dried and canned fruits at rising prices, advanced
quotations for several descriptions of provisions and
a wonderful market for all kinds of grain, millstufls
any hay. In fact, throughout the whole long list of
commodities quoted in the market reports of The
Call meat is the only line that shows a decline, and
this is due to the dry weather, which has caused
free shipments of cattle and sheep to this market for
want of sufficient pasturage. There was a slight
break in hay a few days ago, but this was local and
momentary, being due to excessive receipts from out
side the State in one day.
Helen Gould is an American woman of whom the
country has reason to be proud. Probably if it were
permissible she would be shouldering a rifle herself.
As she can't do this she is buying rifles for other
patriots to shoulder.
The spectator of the future prize fight who shall
neglect to have his life insured will be guilty of crim
inal disregard for his heirs.
Th|E OBESE DEMOCRACY.
WE arc seldom called upon to record a more
soul-inspiring instance of municipal patriot
ism than is disclosed by the published results
of an examination of the membership of the Demo
cratic General Committee elected a few days ago by
the regular organization of the local party. Out of
some 450 committeemen it is stated that over 160
hold positions under the municipal government. Had
the Sullivan faction made this charge in a general
way we should have discredited it. But it seems to
be supported by proof. A list of the names with the
particular offices held has been published.
While it is quite true that no person should be j
amused to hear of Democrats holding office â seeing j
that office-holding and Democracy are synonym
ous â we must confess that the presence in the Dem- j
ocratic General Committee of 160 patriots serving j
their country in peaceful capacities which pay a salary j
is calculated to tickle not only our risibilities, but the j
risibilities of the people generally. Evidently these
gentlemen do not propose to let anybody in on the
good things of the municipality. Having the Demo- j
cratic "works," it is their purpose to keep them. If j
an occasional Democrat manages to breach the party j
organization this year it will not be their fault. In j
any event these 160 self-sacrificing fellows will all be
provided for.
We do not wish to be understood as objecting to
this. On the contrary it is a pleasure to distinctly
approve the proceeding. The fact that the Demo
cratic local organization consists almost entirely of
office-holders, determined to hold on by controlling
it, will do more to bring Republican success in the
coming municipal campaign than any other bit of in
formation that can be published. We are, therefore,
not only gratified to know that the regular Dem
ocracy is made up of the bread and butter brigade,
but we are under distinct obligations to the Sullivan-
Fhelan Democracy for making the fact public.
A great deal of immoderate laughter must prevail
in the vicinity of Livermore these days. Mr. Buck
lay was a raw potentate, but he never presented quite
so raw a front as this. Colonel Sullivan declares that
Agriculturist Rainey is responsible for the new Gen
eral Committee. But we doubt him. If Colonel
Rainey had a hand in the making of that body he
should be summoned before the Lunacy Commis
sioners at once. The old man is certainly daft.
It is quite plain that Providence has it in for the
Democrats this year. With its moth-eaten accouter
ments and serried ranks of pap-suckers the General
Committee will make a weaker showing than the
Spanish made at Manila. Like the jumping frog of
Calaveras, after he had been fed on bird shot, it will
not be able to jump. It will simply stagger about,
breathe hard and lunge.
THE CHARTER ELECTION.
IT is time for the citizens of San Francisco to give
serious attention to the duties imposed upon them
by the approaching charter election. The issues at
stake are of far-reaching importance. They concern
the establishment of a new system of government for
the municipality, and therefore affect to a greater or
less extent the interests of all.
The first duty is that of registration on the part of
all who are not registered. The registration office
closes to-morrow, May 10. The time for attending
to this duty, it will be seen, is short. It should be
performed at once, for while it is possible for the
dilatory to put the matter off until to-morrow, the
duty is one that should be done to-day.
The classes of persons who must register in order
to have the right to vote on the charter are:
First â All persons not registered at the last general
or special election, but who were entitled thereto.
Second â All persons who were registered, but by
moving out of their "special election precinct" or
otherwise have lost their right to vote.
Third â All native male citizen not registered and
all naturalized citizens (not registered) who have be
come such prior to February 26, 1898, and are other
wise qualified according to law.
It is desirable from every point of view that all
citizens should vote in this election. Whether the
charter is adopted or rejected, the decision should be
given by a majority vote of all. On neither side
should the issue be permitted to go by default
Popular indifference to municipal issues has long
been one of the defects of our civic life. San Fran
cisco would be a much better city if our people had
always shown a true and wholesome interest in local
political contests. There should be no indifference
displayed in this instance. The form of government
under which our municipal affairs are to be carried
on for a long time to come is to be determined by
the vote cast on May 26, and surely no man who has
the welfare of the municipality at heart can be in
different to such an issue.
The duty of the time and of the day is plain: See
that your name is on the Great Register, study the
charter and prepare yourself to .rightly fulfill the re
sponsibilities of an intelligent citizen by voting on
election day.
JUDGE MAGUIRE'S REPUDIATION OF
DEMOCRACY.
JUDGE MAGUIRE'S denial that he said the
seizure of Spanish merchant ships was "nothing
more than piracy," and his admission that he
said such seizure was "no better than piracy," sug
gests a further examination of the Judge's somewhat
tortuous political course.
In 1887 he formally and forever withdrew from the
Democratic party, State and national. His reasons
were given in the following letter:
[From the San Francisco Bulletin, Friday,
January 28, 1887.]
JUDGE MAGUIRE ABANDONS THE DEM
OCRACY.
Boodle and Bossism Too Much for Himâ Socialism
of a Certain Sort More Suitable to His
Fancy, Etc.
The following letter from Judge Maguire to the
California State Democratic Club may create some
thing of a political breeze:
SAN FRANCISCO, January 27, 1887.
To the Officers and Members of the California
State Democratic Clvb â Gentlemen: I hereby tender
my resignation as a member of your club.
In withdrawing permit me to return thanks to the
officers, past and present, for many courtesies which
they have extended during our long and pleasant
association.
Let me also assure the members, with whom my
relations have always been most cordial, that my
withdrawal is not prompted by any personal con
siderations, but that it is to me a painful act of duty
to political principles and convictions with which
the present policy of the Democratio party is not in
accord.
As this resignation 1b the final act which severs
my connection with the Democratic party, State and
national, it is but just to you, and to all others who
have stood shoulder to shoulder with me in the poli
tical battles of the past, that I should fully and
frankly state the reasons which have moved me to
this serious step.
Earl/ in life I learned to reverence the name De
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 9, 1898.
mocracy, as representing all that is sublime in the
political history of past ages and as connecting the
best of political principles.
The party bearing this sacred name being out of
power at the time I reached my majority I naturally
entered its ranks, hoping and expecting that it would
ever be the aggressive and intelligent champion of
liberty, equality and justice, -wherever and whenever
these vital principles of social happiness might be
either neglected or assailed.
Finally our party triumphed, but alas! It has
brought no relief to our suffering people. The bene
fit of that triumph has amounted to no more than
the distribution of a few official prizes to the friends
and relatives of wealthy aristocrats and to the
henchmen of political bosses. There are, of course,
exceptions, but this has been the rule.
Wealth is still the standard of respectability. Just
as it was under Republican administrations, and the
rights and wishes of the great Democratic masses
of the country are Just as completely ignored.
Rival bidders for the affection of monopolists, the
great national parties have become like as two peas,
both in actions and principles.
The great intellectual statesmen, the men of prin
ciple and courage, once the glory of our country,
have been retired from our Federal Senate, and the
people have practically ceased to be represented
there. The chamber which once held that highest
body of earthly legislators is now a sort of national
stock exchange, wherein seats are sold to- monopo
lists and to wealthy seekers after social standing. In
the matter of sanctioning this iniquity honors seem
to be easy between the parties.
The entire solid area of our great country, includ
ing the natural opportunities of all our people, the
natural resources without which ncrne of our people
can live, has been made the exclusive private prop
erty of a few thousand alien and domestio landlords,
who, by virtue of the absolute control which they do
thus, as owners, exercise over the only means of
living of our landless millions, are robbing the latter
continually of from one-half to four-fifths of the
fruits of their labor, and are daily driving them to
lower and lower depths of slavery and helpless
misery.
This is a system of human servitude just as com
plete as chattel slavery, and in many respects more
atrocious; yet the so-called "Democratic party,"
while claiming to be the friend of the laborer, ex
pressly defends this system and bids for the support
of those who profit by it. But these are not the only
matters In which the party has been recreant. In
the late Democratic State Convention an emissary
of certain railroad corporations, who acted as a car
rier of messages between his masters and the com
mittee on platform, caused that committee to elim
inate a resolution condemning the election of the
president of the Central Pacific Railroad Company
to the United States Senate, and also caused the
committee to eliminate Senator Reddy's resolution
upon the Chinese question, which, prior to his ap
pearance, had been adopted. This railroad emissary
received as his reward for this successful service a
Democratic nomination for Congross. It is but Just,
In defense of the people, that I shiruld add he was
not elected.
I will not recount the painful history nor dwell
upon the deplorable condition of our local Democ
racy. It Is difficult to speak of this branch of the
party In the language of polite correspondence. Let
it here suffice to say that our local Democracy is
under the acknowledged dominion of a man who has
been publicly charged with having openly and no
toriously purchased votes on last election day. This
charge has been strongly supported by the sworn
and recorded testimony of several citizens; yet, al
though this crime against the elective franchise is a
blow at the very heart of our liberty, a crime more
dreadful In Its consequences than murder or open
treason, no citizen has yet manifested sufficient con
fidence in the Democratic officers who are charged
with conducting public prosecutions to even file a
complaint against the alleged offender.
In face of this public charge and of other equally
outrageous doings, as If to wantonly humiliate the
State Democracy and commit It to the ratification of
such iniquities, the chairman and other members of
the State Central Committee publicly serenaded this
man, and the chairman thanked him and eulogized
him for his statesmanlike services to the party dur
ing the campaigns. And so I might go on, ad libi
tum, ad nauseum usque, but It is unnecessary.
As a self-respecting man I would feel justified and
bound in honor to withdraw from a party which has
fallen to such levels; but there is another and potent
reason for my immediate withdrawal, which is, that
a new national party is being formed for the pur
pose of restoring the natural rights of the great
landless Democracy of America.
It is founded upon the idea that all men have an
equal right to live, and, as a necessary consequence,
that all men have at all times an equal and inalien
able right to the use of the natural elements which
God made and gave freely for the subsistence of
human life; that to secure these rights governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the goverrred; that all American
citizens are entitled to equal opportunities with re
spect to the great natural resources of our common
country; that no speculator in the natural rights of
his fellow-men should be permitted to prevent
American citizens from making homes upon land
which he does not want to use; that no landlord â
alien or citizenâ should be permitted to collect toll
from American citizens for allowing them the privi
lege of using the natural and indestructible powers
of our soil; that the rental value of land, which re
sults In all cases entirely from the presence, enter
prise, virtue and industry of the whole people, be
longs to the whole people, and should, as a matter of
common justice, be taken for public use; and that
no tax or burden of any kind should be Imposed
upon commerce, agriculture, manufactures or other
Industries or upon any products of human labor as
long aa this rental value of land â which is the
margin of productionâ shall be sufficient for public
purposes.
To the new party, founded upon these principles,
which I conceive to be the very soul and essence of
true Democracy, all of the time which I can hence
forth give to the political service of my country will
be devoted. I shall therefore in the next political
campaign do all In my power to secure the election
of Henry George or some other land reformer to the
Presidency of the United States, unless the Demo
cratic party shall in the meantime become demo
cratic by adopting the principles which we have
espoused.
Having deliberately resolved to pursue this course
I desire that my position may be fully and exactly
understood, so that my actions and relations with
respect to political matters shall be neither Incon
sistent nor ambiguous.
Sincerely trusting that our social relations may be
as pleasant In the future as they have in the past, I
remain, very truly and respectfully yours,
JAMES G. MAGUIRE.
San Francisco, January 27, 1887.
In the campaign of 1888 there is no trace of him.
It was waged locally by William D. English, the
same chairman of the Democratic State Committee
whom he berates in connection with Buckley. In
1886 the Judge had bolted the ticket and opposed
McCoppin for Congress. In 1890, the Democratic
party meantime not having changed its principles
or professions, the Judge was back in the organiza
tion. In 1892, still no change in the party to meet
the views of his letter, he took the nomination of
the unregenerate Democracy for Congress and held
office ever since in the same party which he damned
and quitted in 1887! As chairman of the Metropolitan
Temple meeting he sustained the Buckley organiza
tion, which he denounced in 1887, and although the
Democratic party has never declared against the
private ownership of land he seeks its nomination
for Governor.
When he left the party it was under the most sol
emn determination not to return to it unless it de
clared in favor of permitting American citizens to
make homes upon any land that the owner was not
using at the time the said citizen desired to squat
thereon.
Will the party take this position now?
Refusal to grant citizenship to a Spanish resident
whose home had been in San Francisco for at least
a dozen years may seem a little harsh, but it was the
only proper course to be taken by the court. The
man could not speak English, and anybody who
would live here so long and not have interest enough
in the country to have learned its language is unfit
to be a citizen.
It is true that San Francisco makes more noise over
bulletins from a prize-fight than over those from the
seats of war, but there is more thinking over the
latter.
ADMIRALS AND
THEIR FLAGS.
The grades of admiral, vice-admiral,
rear-admiral and commodore have only
existed by law in our navy since July 16,
1862, and the first two, created especially
for Farragut, Porter and Rowan, ceased |
to exist with the death of these officers. ]
As early as November 15, 1776, Congress
established the relative rank between '
army and navy officers, namely: Admiral \
with general, vice-admiral with lieuten
ant-general, rear-admiral with major
general and commodore with brigadier
general. It failed, however, to commis
sion any naval officers to those grades,
and the title of commodore given to such i
officers as John Paul Jones, Hull, Bain- â 
bridge, Decatur and other heroes of the i
early wars was merely complimentary,
and without warrant of law. The highest
lawfully recognized title up to 1862 was
that of captain, and our navy officers in ;
command of squadrons abroad have been
subjected to annoyances, which, to mili
tary men, are very serious when they '
meet with foreign commanders holding
ranks higher than that of the American
commander-in-chief.
Farragut wad the first American naval
officer flying an admiral's flag in Euro
pean waters and it has not been seen
there since 1867. From 1777 to ISOB the flag
officer's flags were cut to the shape of
that of the present commodore's flag â of
blue, red or white bunting, according to
seniority of the officer, and they had thir
teen white stars placed in three parallel
rows with four, five and four stars in
each row. In 1858 the flags were changed
to plain blue, red orwhiteof parallelogram
cut and were the same for commodores
and rear-admirals, the rli-Uinrtion being
made in that commodores carried it at
the fore and rear-admirals wore it at the
main. Farragut hoisted his flag as the
first and senior rear-admiral in the United
States navy on board the Hartford, Au
gust 11. !Sfi2. After the introduction in
ISils of the grades of admiral and vice-ad
miral the flag officers' flags were made as
shown in the accompanying illustrations,
that of the admiral and vice-admiral be
ing blue with four and three stars, re
spectively; that of rear-admiral being
blue, white or red. according to seniority,
and having two stars, while that of the

The Russian armored gunboat Kraby,
of 1492 tons, has passed through her
trials, which, however, did not apparently
como up to requirements. With Â£642
horse power the vessel made 14.54 knots,
while the contract stipulated 15 knots
with only 2000 horse power.
The British cruiser Europa, built by
Thomson at Glasgow, left that yard re
cently for Portsmouth to be fitted out,
and averaged fifteen knots with 3500 horse
power. She is 11,000 tons displacement
and is to make a speed of 20 1 /fe knots with
16,500 horse power; and the Indications
are that the ship will exceed her contract
speed.
Three thousand workmen in the Toko
suka dockyard are threatening to go on
a strike. Their wages are only four
sevenths of those obtained in private es
tablishments, and the constant rise in the
price of commodities makes it difficult to

request to the authorities for an Increase

The Austrian Minister of Marine has
asked the Legislature to sanction the
building of five armorclads, five cruisers
and sixty-eight torpedo boats. The pres
ent modern navy consists of ten armored
ships, seven cruisers, eleven torpedo gun
boats, sixty-five torpedo boats and four
river monitors on the Danube. The old
navy includes se%*en corvettes, six gun
boats and four dispatch vessels, nearly
all of which are built of wood.
The Creuaot establishment In France
began In 1876 the manufacture of armor
and has since then turned out 52,000 tons
of armor and 9600 heavy gun forgings.
The armor-plate plant Is contained In one
building 1410 feet In length by 164 feet In
â¢width and another building 908 feet by 82
feet. Its 100-ton steam hammer can be
heard In operation at a distance of seven
miles. There are several other hammers
of smaller size, and in addition two hy
draulic presses, one of 6000 tons and an
other of 1200 tons, besides three forging
presses of 8000. 2000 and 1200 tons have
been put up during the past five years.
The Terrible, sister ship to the Power

series of trials, which consist of seventy
two hours' continuous steaming under
10.000, 14.000 and 18.000 horse power. These
are more than the British admiralty has
as yet demanded from any ship, and the
London Times states that if this series
of progressive trials are successful she
will enter upon a seventy-two hours' con

orable comment among naval officers. Ad
miral Farragut had left Washington for
a visit to California and Porter who was
the vice-admiral, succeeded to the duties
of Farragut during the latter s absence.
Porter was envious of the popularity and
rank of Farragut, and solely to Perpe
trate a small piece of spite work ordered
a. radical change in the flags, by which
no distinction was made between the
three grades of admirals They were
made of red and white stripes alternat

never made use of this new bunting. It;
"s told that while on his dying bed set
tling up his affairs he expressed the wish
"not to place that 'Bremen bunting' upon

In 1576 a general orde.r from the Navy
Department restored the flags with the
four three, two and single stars, and the |
two latter are now in use.
The President has not the power to
promote an officer to a grade that does
not pxiÂ«t hence Commodore Dewey s pro
motion will, for the time being be to that
of rear-admiral. Congress will without
doubt re-establish the grades of admiral
and vice-admiral, and the President will,
in all probability, recommend Rear-Ad- j
miral Dewey to become either an admiral
or vice-admiral. It would mean a good
deal to that gallant officer, for the honors
and emoluments would be considerable.
The salary of an admiral is $13,000 yearly,
whether at sea, on shore duty or unem
ployed. As a vice-admiral the sa '5- r y.J^
$9000 at sea. $SOOO on shore duty and $bOOO
if unemployed. Rear-admirals receive
only $0000. $5000 and $4000. according to ser
vice, and commodores have to be satis
fied with salaries of $3000, $4000 and $3000
There are no perquisites of any kind, and

WANTEDâ A NEW WAR SONG.
WHO will write the new national
song that will inspire our men on
land or on sea to rousing deeds of
patriotism; that will fire their
hearts with valor, stir the noblest
impulses of their natures In defense of
their country and make them forget
wounds in the deeper thrill of a patriotic
melody charming them with foretastes of
glory? Of such is the "Star-spangled
Banner," "The Battle Cry of Freedom."
"Dixie" and a host of others, called
forth by the exigencies of war, but re
maining with us steadfast as the flag
they indorse during the tranquil seasons
of peace. Some of these were as unex
pected and unpremeditated by the makers
of the songs as by the public upon whoso
tender mercies they were droppedâ and
the question arises, were they inspired
for the occasion by some occult power,
an atom of genius that would out, or
were they the result of hard brainwork,
which Holmes declared to be only another
name for genius? â¢
Take for example that magnificent lyric
"The Star-spangled Banner," which Con
gress adopted as the national hymn, and
which would seem sufficient to our wants
for all ages, and look at its interesting,
even wonderful, history, since it was writ
ten eighty-four years ago by a sleepless
American at the bombardment of Fort
McHenry when the British fleet was pre
paring to attack Baltimore in the closing
war scenes of 1814. Frances Scot Key,
whose grandsons are living in Chicago
to-day unknown and unhonored save by
a few Baltimoreans, wrote the song dur
ing the long watches of the night when
he was a prisoner on the Minden, with
his friend Dr. Beanes, for whose release
from the British ha was capitulating.
All night the two menâ with John J.
Skinner, a friendâ paced the deck of their
guarded vessel, waiting for daylight,
when they could see if their flag had
struck to the British troops. The song
was written on the back or an old letter
and completed during the nljght. Key
first read It his uncle, Joseph H. Nichol
senâa man of cultivated literary tastesâ
and who was in command of a company
of volunteer artillerists in the defense of
Fort McHenry. a soldier full of patriotic
ardor. And he it was wno gave it to the
world, for he carried it to the printing
office of Captain Edes, and gave it to an
apprentice in the absence of the captain,
and ordered a certain number of the song
published. It was done at once, printed
on one side of a neat sheet, with a deco
rative border, and handed out to any one
who wanted It. The city of Baltimore was
wild with excitement over the defeat of
the British and business was suspended.
Judge Lawrenson seventy years after re
called the circumstance. "I stood in the
crowd before the printing ofÃce and heard
people say, 'Here s a song, but where is
the tune?' " It was a boy of 12 years who
furnished the tune â Judge, or, as he was
then called, Jimmy Lawrenson. It was
an English air, oddly enough. "Anacreon
in Heaven." He died at the age of 90, and
shortly before his death said:
I stood on a printer's high stool that
day and was the first to sing, "Oh, say,
can you see by the dawn's early light?"
and I have been singing It ever since all
those eighty years and more, twice as
zealomsly as I ever sung the doxology."
And that single line is sculptured on the
monument which is now ready to be
erected over the grave of Francis Scott
Key, its distinguished author.

In 1862 George F. Root wrote many
memorable war songs, and whether they
were inspired by genius or the demand
of the public or the needs of patriotism
It is certain that all these requirements
were united in them. His "Just Before
! the Battle, Mother." was composed
â  especially for Jules Lumbard, the famous
j war singer, who when patriotism lagged
i and men refused to enlist roused them to
I the highest pitch of enthusiasm by his
I power of song. On the day that Mr. Root
composed "Just Before the Battle.
Mother," he gave it to Lumbard in the
grounds of the old courthouse. It was
during the enlisting of soldiers and thou
sands were assembled in the place. 1 hat
j night he sang it there from the original
manuscriptâ which he still hasâ and tha
] bands tÂ«->ok up the air and the crowds
I Joined in the chorus with him.
â¢ * *
"Dixie" is one of the most fetching and
I inspiring melodies ever sung in any land.
; It was considered during the war a song
i of the rebellion, but it was nothing of the
I sort. The Southern people, with a fine
appreciation of its melodious catch line,
simply adopted it after it had been writ
ten by a Northern man. Dan Emmett. for
Bryant's minstrels, two years before the
war and in the city of New York. But
Mrs. John Wood introduced it into New
Orleans in 1861. when Susan Denin
marched at the head of a hand of zouaves
on the stage of the Varieties, singing "I
Wish I Was in Dixie!" The audience
went wild with enthusiasm, and from
that time "Dixie" became to the South
what the "Marseillaise" is to France. It
was the Washington Artillery that had
the time aranged to a quickstep. Carlo
Patti was the leader of the first orchestra
that played "Dixie."
The new song will grow spontaneously,
taking its author by surprise. It will not
be the result of any fine meditative line of
thought, but an eruption of bottled-up en
thusiasm that fills an atmosphere with
the smoke of genius. When that has
cleared the crystallized poem with its at
tendant music will be th^re. There are
â oldiera and soldiers â soldiers of pence
and soldiers of war. He is a soldier who
can make a song to quicken the pulse
and nerve the heart that is going into
battle, who can help lift lagging feet by
the march of hlÂ« tnurtcâ -M. L. Rayne

sold at I to 5, and at no time was the
Buck in the race. .

one for an ordinary day and the betting
brisk both in the morning and afternoon.

AT INGLESIDE
There was royal sport at Ingloside
Coursing Park yesterday. The fleet hares
and well-conditioned hoi/ids, together
with the even drawing of the card and
excellent management, gave the 4000 peo
ple present an opportunity to witness
some of the finest racing of the season.
Several of the courses were exceptionally
long, and the two "grandstand" finishes
raised the enthusiasm of the crowd.
Yesterday was the second anniversary
of the inauguration of coursing at Ingle
side and the purses paid, amounting to
$775, as compared with those of two years
ago, which summed up only $150, are evi
dence of the increased popularity of the
great Irish sport on this coast.
The betting was heavy on each of the
events on the card, and the backers of
"long shots" proved themselves the best
euessers. The final in the all-aged stake
was won by J. Dean's Connernara, beat

THE MINISTER
AND THE WAR
Rev. W. H. Rader De
fends Free Speech in
That Regai\a
Says That There Should Be
Less Pugilism and More
Patriotism Here.
The Soldier and Battleship as Sacred
as the Preacher and. tho
Pulpit.
"The American Pulpit and the War"
was the subject on which Rev. William
Rader discoursed at some length last
evening. Dr. Rader, in his remarks, did
not defend sensationalism in the pulpit,
but contended that the minister had as
much right as the editor to express his
views on me subject. He also said he
thought the soldier, during time of strife,
is as sacred as the preacher, and thÂ«
battleship as sacred as the pulpit. He
lives. Should the men never get a smell
of powder or hear the whistle of a bul
let there will be much that the Red
Cross can do to ease the sufferings of
those who are called away.
In addition to the medical supplies
that the Surgeon General asks for to
add to that provided by the army regu
lations of the United States, there will
be much that will be acceptable.
Canned and preserved fruits, beef ex
tracts, stimulants and all the delica
cies the sick crave for will be wanted in
great quantities. Donations of goods
of that sort from merchants, manufac
turers and producers would be accept
able by the committee and they will
all be added to the hospital stores of

CHARITY'S CAUSE.
Berkeley's Red Cross So
ciety Sets to Work With
Patriotic Vigor.
BERKELEY, May B.â The spacious au
ditorium of the Frst Congregational
Church was crowded to its utmost ca
pacity this afternoon at the meeting of
the Berkeley Red Cross Society. The
meeting was presided over by Professor
Warring Wilkinson, vice-president of the
society. Several vacancies were filled in
the list of officers and committees, C. A.
Noble was elected corresponding secre
tary, vice James Bunnell, resigned; Mr.
Lipman vas made chairman of the
finance committee, to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of Father
Phillips. Mrs. E. H. Davenport and Mrs.
C. C. Plehn were added to the materials
committee and Mme. F. V. Paget to the
nurses' committee.
Professor Thomas R. Bacon made a
Btrong appeal for funds with which to
provide bandages and various comforts
for the soldiers who are to leave for the
Philippines. The Berkeley society hopes
to raise at least $600. The audience re
sponded to the appeal with a generous
contribution. _ _
Rev Robert Mackenzie of San Fran
cisco 'spoke cm the Red Cross movement
and the universality of its work. "The
Red Cross movement." he declared, "is
not an appeal for soldiers, our country
has plenty of soldiers, but an appeal for
men who 'will follow the soldiers to dress
their wounds, to minister to their needs
and to revive the discouraged; and the
war we are now engaged in is a war not
of conquest, not of self-defense, but a
war of altruism."
Professor Thomas R. Bacon urged the
Importance of the part the Red Cross
Society must take in caring for the
wounded during the war. "Spanish medi
cal administration Is as crude as Spanish
naval administration," he declared, "and
judging from recent events the wounded
of both sides will have to rely for help
not on Spain, but upon us."
Chaplain Wallace of the United States
Navy spoke in vigorous terms of the
principles involved in the war, which he
declared is the most glorious and based
upon principles more just and grand
than any war ever fought. He declared
that the war for Cuban independence
should have been fought twenty-four
years ago.
"By forcibly preventing filibustering In
Cuba during these years." he said, "we
have practically aided the Spaniards in
withholding freedom from the Cubans,
and now it is time Indeed for us to right
matters."
declared it would be better if there wfre
less pugilism in San Francisco and more
patriotism.
A synopsis of his sermon follows:
What should be the attitude of the pulpit
toward the war, is an important question raised
by many thoughtful people. In answering the
question I do not presume to defend but to in
terpret the pulpit.
The sermon is not a delicate expression of
truth; it has been the Instrument of power.
It is a sword which has Hashed in many bat-
The preacher is a citizen. Moses preached
the decalogue, the prophets preached their
messages of fire; Jesus erected his pulpit un
der the open sky, and upon the decks of fish-
Ing boats. Paul made hiils and prisons his
rostrum, and Savonarola, Peter the Hermit,
Bernard of Clairvaux, Beecher and Spurgeon
and Brooks stood in the great crisis and
preached their sermons.
The pulpits of Philadelphia fired the morning
gun of the revolution, and during the civil
war the pulpits of the North cannonaded the
conscience of the South.
The American pulpit has always been patri
otic Bishop Simpson was the adviser of Lin
coln and Henry Ward Beecher faced eggs and
opposition in England. Last week three cheers
were given In Dr. Behrend's great church in
Brooklyn, and Dr. Griggs' sermon in the La
fayette avenue church was followed with a
most remarkable demonstration of patriotic
approval. Dr. Storrs, the most eminent Amer
ican preacher, delivered a strong sermon in
defense of the President and the administra
tion and nearly every prominent divine in the
country answers to the policy of the Presi

reality. It is the national surgery. The Gos
pel does not defy force.
War has always been regarded as an Instru
ment of God. Warriors have been worshiped,
and the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" is
sung more often than "Rock of Ages." It was
believed in olden times that the starry hosts
enlisted in the armies of the chosen people.
John Ruskin see? the torn remnant of a pre
cious canvas against the roof and uses it as an
illustration of the evolution of great art. Lord
WolÂ»eley said of the soldier: "He must believe
that his duties are the noblest that fall to
man's lot." "As much as lieth in you," says
Paul, "live peaceably with all men."
I submit that peace wag exhausted between
Spain and the United States. War for the de
fense of liberty for the oppressed, and for po
litical righteousness is right, or the brother
hood of man is wrong.
Among the duties of the pulpit in such a
war I should mention the interpretation of the
moral grounds, and a candid statement of thes
grounds. In war. lines between the sacred and
secular are destroyed. The soldier is as sa
cred as the preacher, and the deck of a battle
ship as sacred as the pulpit.
The minister must get down from his pedes
tal, and so must every man who lives amone
his ideals. He must face the facts. It is good
to cry peace, but not when there is no peare.
No question of biblical criticism is as im
portant as the outcome of this war. The pres
ent Gospel is the Gospel of the principles In
this conflict. Let us not have jingoism, but pa
triotism. It were better if we had more pa
triotism and less pugilism In Pan Francisco.
The pulpit has Just as much right to speak oti
this question as the editor. Any man who
would muzzle it alms a blow at free speech.
KNIGHTS OF HONOR.
Prescott Lodge has a set of officers who
cannot get rusty in the work, as they
have to initiate at every meeting. Two
applications were received last week.
Center Lodge expects to have seven
candidates to Initiate at Its next meet
ing. The grand officers have been invited
to perform the work.
Grand Dictator Archibald visited An
chor Lodge last Monday. This lodge will
initiate five candidates at its next meet-
ing.
At the meeting of Yerba Buena Lodge
last Monday after the business had been
disposed of W. F. Oeding gave a recita

young men on their duty to the country
at this time, and E. A. Falvey spoke in
a patriotic strain.
Fortuna Lodge received a fraternal
visit last Thursday from Far West Lodge.
Addresses were delivered by John Plaih,
P. D., and E. A. Battis, reporter of the
visiting lodge, anti by Deputy A. A.

The Features of the Game as Seen on
Other Diamonds Over the
State.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Manager McGucken and his band of
ball-tossers from San Jose opened up at
Recreation Park yesterday afternoon
with the San Franciscos. and were de
feated by a score of 10 to 2.
Although the sun was most generous
with its supply of light and heat, the
cold wind, which seems to be one of the
attractions at Recreation Park at this
time of the year, was very much "down
East" in type. Furs and whiskers would
in no way be out of place, especially
toward the latter part of the game, when
the wind really had a Klondike appear
ance. It made no difference to the 2500
fans present, however, for they re
mained the entire game, not a soul leav
ing until the last man was out.
The wind was greatly acrainst the
pitchers, or rather against Mr. Iberg,
and therefore it narrowed down to a
proposition as to which club could play
the livelier game.
The San Franciscos proved superior in
that regard, putting up a grand contest
both at bat and in the field.
San Jose seemed to have a chance for
about four innings. Then those hard
hitting "Frisco" boys woke up, and with
a couple of well-placed hits. intermingled
with two bases on balls, a misplay by
Foleyâwho after stopping a hit stood
stupefied with the ball in his handâ
them four runs. They were never in
danger after this inning, yet kept up the
good work, scoring two more runs in the
fifth Inning and four in the eighth.
"Ham" Iberg, the "great," was in very
poor form, giving six bases on balls, be
sides being touched up for thirteen hits.
The players say that â "Ham" was so anx
ious to beat the Friscos, owing to the
number of his old comrades now playing j
in thÂ© team, that it made him nervous. I
The trouble, however, was "Ham's" in
ability to locate the plate. He continually
kept giving batters two and three balls,
and then had to put the ball over, when it
was Invariably hit hard. It must not.
however, be overlooked that the "Frisco' |
team as it lined up to-day, is a mighty !
hard club to beat. A pitcher has got to j
be on his mettle when he faces this ag- i
gregation, or thÂ«? base-hit column will be
full to overflowing. They played a superb
game, and there is no reason why they
should not continue to do so. At bat they
are demons, and if they can keep up the
gait they struck in yesterday's game
those Gilt Edge "wonders" from Sacra
mento will have to look to their colors.
In Krug they have a great pitcher. San
Jose made but two hits olf his delivery,
and in one inning he retired the side on
three pitched balls. His speed and con
trol were wonderful, considering the fact
that he had not pitched a game In two
â¢ weeks. If he can keep up the. pace he
struck yesterday Iberg and Harvey will
no longer be his superiors.
The features of the game were the
pitching and batting of Krug, the fielding
of "Blockers" Hanley, who in the seventh
inning let a ball go through his legs with
the bases full, allowing all hands to score,
the batting of Hammond and Egan's
three-base hit. McGucken played the
best game for San Jose, accepting four
chances in the outfield without breaking a
leg. Following Is the score:

ONE MORE FOR OAKLAND.
STOCKTOX, May B.â Stockton was too
weak this afternoon for Oakland's heavy
batters. Both clubs put up good ball. It
was defeat with honor, and at tne end of
the fifth inning it was evident that
Stockton would have a hard time to play
out even. There was good fielding on both
sides and many of the outs m;L.y In
marked to the credit of the outfields.

A FINE GAME AT SACRA
MENTO.
BACRAMENTO, May B.â The finest
game of baseball played here since the
Gilt Edges walloped the Baltimores was
that between the Gilts and the Fresnos
to-day, and while the visitors won out
by a score of 4 to 3, It was owing to a
lucky bunching hits in the seventh and
not to superior play. The features of the
game were two double plays by More and
Early of the Fresnos, a home-run by
Borland and the phenomenal backstop
work of Mangerlna. Score:

The crack local handball players who
patronize Phil Ryan's San Francisco
court at SSS Howard tsreet have been
mystified by the arrival of Pierre Eli

succeeded in sending three of the best
San Francisco players to grass. The
French player will play the Irish, or
rather th* American game, or he will use
the racquet against their hands and de
feat any two of the crack players In this
city.
This athlete madp his npppnrnn^r> at the
San Francisco court yesterday, and in the
presence of a large crowd walked away
with half a dozen of Phil Ryan's crack
players. He can land the little ball just
where he pleases without the least ap

day George Fishburn, a wealthy railroad
contractor from "Xestle Brae," Sum

THE CURSE OF OAKLAND.
Rev. E. R. Dille, D.D., Condemns
Fabiola's Benefit Day at the
Racetrack.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 8.
Rev. E. R. Dille, D.D., pastor of
the First Methodist Episcopal Church,
delivered the following prelude to-night
to hie regular sermon:
"There id no public or quasi public
instituUnn upon which Oakianders
1 roY with more prule than upon our
Fabiola Hospital. It is one of the fair
Â«b jewels in Oakland's crown Its
growth and prosperity during- the veavs
of its existence reflect the greatest
credit upon its unselfish promoters and
upon the city, which is ever ready, I
am sure, to give it generous and un
grudging support. I have been fami
liar with its work for the past ten
years and have freely borne testimony
to the excellence of its management
and to its high character as an institu
tion. But there is another institution
in the environs of our city which is the
antipodes of the Fabiola, for while one
does a world of good the other does a
â world of evil; while one is Oakland's
blessing and pride the other is its
6hame, curse and disgrace, and it is to
me and a large number of our citizens
a source of profound regret that there
should be any relation between these
two Institutions or that their names
should be associated in any way. The
Fabiola Hospital has everything to
lose, the Emeryville race track every
thing to gain, by an unholy and un
natural alliance even for a single day
In the year.
"I am sure that I need advance no
argument to-night to prove that gam
bling is a vice that is doing more to
destroy our young men in California
than any other, with a single exception
â the drink hahit; and that the worst
form of gambling to-day is that con
nected with the race tracks and pool
rooms. Betting is the soul of horse
racing and a thievish desire to get
money without earning it is the soul of
betting.
"I do not doubt that there are a few
men who delight in horse-racing as an
honest sport and for the sake of the
Improvement in horseflesh that it is
supposed to promote; but the number
of such habitues of the race track is
ii.finitesimally small compared with the
number who frequent the races f or the
6ake of gambling, and dishonest gam
bling at that. How many trials of speed
do you suppose there would be if there
tvere some method not yet discovered
by which betting on the result would
be wholly prevented? And how many
races does anybody believe to be hon
estly run?
'â¢Everybody knows that the racing
at Emeryville and Ingrleside is a swin
dle from start to finish. There is too
much money Invested to allow- the re- :
puits of the investment to depend upon
chance; wherever there is a pool box i
there is a certainty an:l the rsu*e has j
been fixed, as the Little Pete disclos
ures showed. A tip of a few dollars to !
a Jockey will cause a horse to lose a I
race, especially if he is a favorite upon
â¢whom the fools have staked. That is i
why sure thing gamblers wear fine
linen and wear diamonds as big as
walnuts and can afford to buy up a i
board of lady managers occasionally
Just as Dick Croker in New York I
bought his way into the swell clubs of I
the metropolis. The truth is that vice
in all its forms â drunkenness, lying, I
cheating, stealing â are inseparable ad- j
Juncts of the racecourse. Human birds
of prey flock to it from under the
whole heaven and gorge themselves to
the full. Hundreds of millions of dol- j
lars are invested in the race tracks of
this country and the gambling enter
prises connected therewith. And it is i
universally conceded that the Ingleside I
and Emeryville race tracks receive
their chief income from the gambling
privileges connected therewith and
cruld net live without them. Why at
pome of the great racecourses the
starters and judges receive larger sal
aries than do the Judges of our State
Supreme Court. The bookmakers at j
the tracks pay the racing associations
$100 a day, and the telegraph and tele
phone companies pay $1500 a day for |
the privilege of sending news from the i
track to the poolrooms all over the
country.
"Now as a crime breeder I unhesi
tatingly affirm that racetrack gam
bling, in and out of poolrooms, is the
worst gambling evil in the land.
"The Louisiana lottery, with all its
ramifications, its vast wealth and pow
er, constituted no such menace to the
public morality, no such source of pri
vate and political corruption, no such
burden upon the commercial prosperity
of the country as does the racing in
terest. In the heyday of its success the
lottery robbed the people of $34,000,000
in a single year, while the chance of
â winning its capital prizes was but one
in 70,000.
"But, according to the New York
Times, the enormous sum of $2,898,372
â¢was stolen in one year with which to
play the races, to say nothing of the
honest money wagered. It is estimated j
that $200,000,000 is staked annually and
lost upon them. A little while ago the
Clinton ordinance proposing to limit
the- niring season in San Francisco to
forty-eight days in the year was beaten
in the Board of Supervisors by the
same arguments that have induced the
Fabiola managers to stand sponsors for
Emeryville â for the racetrack gamblers,
like hell and destruction, are never
satisfied. And yet Just before that ac
tion was taken Welburn had robbed the
United States treasury to play the
races, and Just following that action
it was developed that Widber had rob
bed the city of $116,000 of its public
funds, which had gone into the insati
able maw of the same institution. And
these are but monotonous repetitions
of the story of January, and Tilley, and
Cassenbohm. and Melville, and Page,
and Flood, and Bcores of others who
have robbed the public treasury or the
cmmereial institutions of these cities
r"ind the bay within the past few
years t->t -> line the pockets of the emi
nently .espectable gentlemen who try
to give their nefarious business a color
of respectability by holding out a gold
en lure to institutions like the Fabiola
Hospital.
"Yes. the racetrack, which is a
greater burden upon our com
mercial Interests, a greater draw
back to our material prosperity
than the dry year and tha war
combined, Is aspiring to Join the Four
Hundred, for Mammon wins its way
! where Seraphs might despair. And it
j proposes to get into respectable society
by the use of a small portion of its ill
gotten gains. A January or a Widber
or a Welburn will steal enough from
the public treasury in a month to en
able it to bribe into silence and con
nivance several great Christian chari
ties, since money covers a multitude of
sins.
"The Louisiana lottery purchased for
I itself immunity from proscription, year
: after year, by building a great library
for New Orleans, by subsidizing the Y.
M. C. A., the churches, the public chari
ties and'the State treasury. But at last
' public conscience was aroused, an non- i
est Legislature and an unbnbable
Christian Governor were elected and ;
the foul thing was banished inH>neot
Its offer to the State of a $25,000,000 (
bribe.
"If Mr. Williams wishes to make a
; donation to the Fabiola, why does he
not do it outright? Why does he re
quire the managers to so advertise and
approve his gambling scheme that they
become particeps crlminis in every j
crime it produces, and so that If their â 
own sons are ruined by it. they are i
estopped from any protest?
"I have no doubt any saloon or gamb- ,
ling hell in Oakland would give the I
ladies a night's receipts if they would |
i stand behind the bar and mix drinks, ;
or preside at the gaming table; and I ,
: should like to be Informed In what re
! spect this De by day is morally on a
I higher plane.
"Here 1b an institution that has been ;
' recently driven from New Jersey, j
1 Rhode Island, Minnesota, Delaware, i
â â  Pennsylvania and Illinois, and coming
to our coast brings from the East a
' horde of human vampires in its train.
:An institution that has impoverished
and ruined multitudes, corrupted thou
sands of young men, and degraded j
; childhood and womanhood. And yet
ou society queens in Oakland take this
moral leper, this pariah, to their hearts \
â  for sweet charity's sake.
"Its charity is precisely like that of
a man who should come to me and say,
: 'you give me $100 every morning, and I
: will give your sick family one dollar :
every evening.'
"Oakland gives the race track at ;
least $250,000 a year, and it gives back
a paltry four or five thousand on con- j
dition that we give it a certificate of
respectability.
â¢Says the Monitor, the organ of the j
Roman Catholic Church on the coast,
'gambling is rife in San Francisco and
Oakland because the peonle are will
ing to see their women degraded, their
young men debauched and their old !
men dishonored by the minions of hell
whose habi-.^ is the race track.'
"Ladies, th re is a difference in j
money; a $5 gold piece handed you as ;
the fruit of a son's honest labor is one <
thing, but the same coin handed you j
as the price of the dishonor of a daugh- j
| ter would drive you Insane with hor- â 
i ror.
"Blood money is awful coin. Even â 
the hardened Pharisees would not re- ;
ceive it. and even the betrayer of Christ
flung it from his covetous grasp.
"I predict that all the money the
Fabiola Hospital receives from its
Derby day as a bribe to connivance j
and silence will be the most dearly got
ten revenue it ever received, for it will
cost it, I fear, the sympathy .of the |
Christian public and the blessing of i
God." _
MRS. YULE REPLIES.
President of the Fabiola Asso-
ciation Is Indignant.
The announcement that Rev. Dr.
Dille intended to express his views on
the Fabiola Derby day at the race
track drew a large crowd to the First
M. E. Church to-night. Although the
notice of the address contained no hint
of the nature of the criticism, it waa
more than surmised that the Derby day
plan of raising Income would be sev
erely condemned, and the surmise
proved to be correct.
Fabiola has long been the pride of
the charitably inclined in this city. It
has always been the boast of *ac man
agement that the institution Is abso
lutely non-sectarian, is open to all
schools of medicine and that it dis
penses unfettered charity to all who
are unable to support themselves dur
ing sickness. Any attack on Fabiola
is sure to bring forth a defense from
the ladies who manage the institution,
many of whom are leaders in Oakland
society.
Mrs. John Yule, president of the
Fabiola Association, was shown the re
marks of Dr. Dille to-night and was
asked for her opinion.
"I have been president of the Fabiola
Association for many years," said Mrs.
Yule, "and have frequently been called
upon. to explain certain features of our
work, but this is the first time I have
had to meet such an argument as that
advanced by Dr. Dille. I am at a loss,
in the first place, to know why Fabiola
should be singled out for this attack.
Nearly every charity in San Francisco
has been made the beneficiary of a
special day at the race track, and yet,
although Dr. Dille /has been in San
Francisco for the past five years, I
have not heard of his having 1 con
demned any of the institutions over
there for partaking of the generosity
of the race track people. Next week
there is to be a day at the track for the
purpose of raising funds to build a
tunnel through the hills into Contra
Costa County. "Will that project also
come under the ban? Will Dr. Dille
condemn that and say that a curse will
rest on that highway because it was
helped by the racing people?
"Fabiola is not a religious institu
tion and never professed to be. All are
welcome, and its policy is as broad as
the broadest definition of charity.
Nearly everybody in this city helps it.
Among its friends are people of all
creeds, and we have not forgotten that
we were helped some time ap â > by a lec
ture kindly delivered for us by Rev.
Father Yorke. In this instance we feel
particularly grateful to Mr. Thomas
Williams for making it possible for us
to have such a substantial benefit. Our
best society attends these events and
there is no doubt that much of the
day's proceeds would not be taken in
if it were not for a charitable purpose.
Fabiola does not receive any betting
money, but receives the total gate re
ceipts paid by people to s,e the races.
I am very sorry Dr. Dille has ad
dressed such language to the ladies of
Fabiola. and think our work deserves
encouragement rather than discourage-
Last year Fabiola day netted the hos
pital over $4000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 9, 1898.
NOW SHOWING
THEIR HANDS
Davis and Pardee Each
Has a Distinct Pro
gramme.
County Against the State, and
State Against the
County.
SineÂ© Lou Brown's Vialt More Has
Been Heard of HiÂ» Aspira
tions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 8.
Events of the past week clearly show
the nature of the campaign being made
by the friends of the respective gentlemen
who are anxious to succeed Governor
Budd. The next month will probably
show what support Dr. Pardee and W. R.
Davis can expect from this county and
also from the balance of the State.
It is now very evident that the Davis
people are making a campaign of such a
nature as it Is hoped will exercise a
marked influence throughout the whole
of the State, while not neglecting the pos
sibilities of this county. Mr. Davis was
a prominent member of the State League
of Republican Clubs when it was organ
ized in 1596. He is now the president of
the league In this county. Last Friday
night a meeting of the leaders of thee
State league waa held at the Palace Ho
tel, and in some manner or other consid
erable mention was made of Mr. Davis.
One of the speakers, H. A. Powell, who
was a Presidential elector two years ago,
openly complimented Mr. Davis on the
good work he had done in the campaign
for McKinley. Among those who were
present from Oakland were Frank A.
Leach, Murray* Laidlaw and a few others.
Colonel Stone, who presided, threw out a
suggestion of the advisability of the State
Central Committee working in harmony
with the State league for the purpose of
advancing party interests. It was finally
arranged tnat at the convention of Re
publican leagues to be held in San Fran
cisco on the last day of this month a del
sgatlon should be invited from every- bona
tide Republican club in the State. Not a
word was said about Dr. Pardee, and no
cmc from his camp appeared to be pres
2nt.
Another sidelight on this Interesting
situation is found In the fact that Mr.
Davis is president of the Alumni Asso
ciation of the University of California,
and it is his duty to arrange for the an
nual banquet to be held In the middle of
next week. Mr. Davis has pledged that
the banquet shall be a more elaborate
affair than any that have preceded it. He
has named as his committee two dele
gates from each of the classes that have
graduated since 1573. These committee
men have been chosen from all portions
of the State, with the natural result that
the name of W. R. Davis is extensively
circulated. There is. of course, no poli
tics In this, but under the circumstances
the occasion is certainly an opportunity
that has not been neglected. Nearer home
a few genuine Davis clubs have made
their appearance, and there is much spec
ulation as to the influence they will
wield within this county. It is plain,
however, that the Davis people prefer to
recruit strength in the State at large and
hope thereby to influence Alameda
County.
On the other hand the programme of
the Pardee men seems to be to obtain all
the strength possible in Alameda County,
with the hope of influencing the rest of
the State. The greatest efforts of those
who are favorable to Dr. Pardee are cen
tered in local organizations. Feeling con
fident of electing a majority of delegates
to any county convention the Pardee men
are doing all in their power to induce the
County Central Committee to so arrange
the call that delegates to the State Con
vention shall be elected at a special coun
ty convention called for that purpose.
They argue that only by this means can
Alameda send a solid delegation to the
State Convention. In the Seventh Ward
the Young Men's Republican Club has al
ready indorsed Dr. Pardee. The Young
Men's Republican League of Alameda
County has not and will not take up any
particular candidate, but it has passed a
resolution indorsing the convention plan
of electing delegates to the State Conven
tion. Now it is stated that an attempt
will be made to unite the regular Seventh
"Ward Republican Club with the Young
Men's organization in that ward, though
it is hardly likely that the regular club,
which, it is well known, is almost solid
for Pardee, will go outside of its usual
course and accept the indorsement al
ready made by the Young Men's Club.
It is daily becoming more apparent that
L. H. Brown is not without friends in
Alameda County, and he is known to
have some warm allies on the County
Committee. As both Davis and Pardee
are from the same wing of the party, it
goes without saying that there is a large
element that Is anxious to take up a third
man. and Lou Brown appears to be gath
ering them under his wing. He waa in this
city a couple of weeks ago, and since his
departure his name has been mentioned
more frequently. Any estimate of chances
in this county that ignores Brown is not
complete.
Up to the present time the contest has
been carried on in a very friendly man
ner. Nothing has yet been Injected Into
the campaign between these two gentle
men that savors of personalities or petti
ness. Occasionally some Irresponsible has
attempted to get some expression of opin
ion before one of the clubs, which would
have produced unpleasantness, but such
members are no more representative of
the respective factions than were the hot
headed few who turned Colonel Fair
banks' picture to the wall representative
of the Oakland militia.
In the past two years especially there
has been much opposition shown, against
the holding of several primaries, and it
is noticeable that some of those who are
now favoring the holding of the primary
and a convention for State delegates
were among those who one, two and
three years ago were most prominently
opposed u> such a system.
In many respects the contest closely
resembles that of two years ago, when
Judge Frick and Mr. Hilborn were run
ning for the Congressional nomination.
The latest bills for supplying water to
the City Hall, which are based on meter
rates, have set the average citizen to
thinking. Since all water Is of equal
commercial value, whether used for di
luting whisky or irrigating a. lawn. It is
rather difficult to understand why it
would not be fair to producer and con
sumer alike for the Council to authorize
a uniform meter system throughout the
city. There is nothing In the law to
justify such an Intricate system of book
keeping and surveying aa is necessary
under the present schedule to arrive at
the chargeÃ for water in each individual
instance.
At this time there is a special value set
on water for household purposes, another
value for washing windows and side
walks, another value for visitors, another
value for school children, unother value
for irrigating lawns, another one for
horses, cows, pigs, chickens, bakery
shops, breweries and street sprinkling.
There is also a clause permitting the
companies under certain conditions to
charge meter rates, as in laundries and
public parks. Many of these values have
to be determined by measuring the length
of sidewalk, the superficial area of
houses, the size of lawns, the number of
stories to a dwelling, the number of baths
and closets it contains and many other
calculations.
Again, if a bill is disputed, the dis
putant has to deposit $5, the City Engi
neer has to survey the premises to see if
the water company's measurements are
correct, and if he decides that thoy are
the J5 becomes his.
It is not easy for the average citizen to
understand why all these complications
should be. There Is only one source of
supply to each house or dwelling, as con
sumers find to their mortification when
they neglect to pay their rates. Why is
it not possible to have a meter through
which all the water must pass, whether
used or wasted, and to fix a uniform rate
for all such water? The gTeat complaint
of the water companies is that so much
water is wasted. But by a uniform meter
system, citizens would have to pay for
every gallon wasted and if the companies
are sincere in sending out notices as at
present, that there Is a danger of a scar
city of water it would not seem unreason
able to expect them to indorse so simple
a plan for saving water, for most cer
tainly consumers would practice economy
when they saw its effect on their pocket
books. STUART N. BOOTH.

IT DISCLOSES
THE HAND OF GOD
True Explanation for Our
Ships Enjoying Such Im
munity.
Rev, V. Marshall Law's Unique) Ex
planation Concerning the Battle
of Manila..
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 8.
At this evening's services at the Church
of the Advent, Rev. V. Marshall Law de
livered an address upon me immunity of
our men and ships from harm in battle.
He said:
Among all the reasons which I have seen
given for the United States troops passing
scathless through the great battle of the Phil
ippines no one. it seems to me, has touched aa
yet the true explanation for our men and
ships enjoying such singular Immunity from
harm In that battle. It has been ascribed to
poor gunnery and worse guns, to over-e.xclte
ment so that the Spanish aim was disturbed
and various other reasons. But to my mind
it discloses the hand of God. Our cause Is the
cause of humanity. This war was not under
taken to satisfy a desire for conquest nor the
desire for an extension of the territory of this
country, but it was undertaken to set the op
pressed, the starving women and children free
from massacre and rapine. As such it is God's
cause, and God always makes a majority for
the side on which he Is engaged, be the forces
great or small. It Is true that in nearly evÂ«ry
war but this there have been two fairly well
defined sides. Some right could be claimed by
either belligerent. But when our arms under
took to rescue the oppressed, the helplessly
downtrodden and the starved It engaged to do
battle for Christ's little ones. The kins: of
heaven has been with us from the beginning,
and Admiral Dewey's marvelous naval accom
plishment was but the hand of the Almighty,
who by the turn of the currents of the sea
which are in the hollows of his hands has pro
tected our ships as with a hundred armor
plates and suffered not the winds and the
waves to deflect our shot and shell.
At a recent banquet where our Bishop was
present he voiced a reflection which I may
amplify as follows: If when Columbus set
foot on these shores an angel had hovered over
his grandiloquent landing and planting of the
standard of Spain, and had told him In pro
phetic annunciation that In four hundred
years the armies of this new country would
humble that same flag In one mighty battle
on the other side of the globe, and that the
very name of Spain would be a hated by-word,
how impossible would this have seemed to the
haughty Genoese as he looked over our barren
shores, where the American Indian and the
wild beast held undisputed dominion! Here
again is the working of God in history, and
we do well, as you know we have done to-day,
to invoke in this church the help of the 'God
of righteous battles and to offer thanksgivings
for victory in the words of our matchless
ritual, which is never found lacking in suit
able language to express human dea'.re and
thanksgiving for a people who truly love Him
who Is at one and the same time the creator
of the universe and the friend of little chil
dren and helpless women.

the graduating class at the unlversity
are rehearsing for a unique spectacular
performance to be given next Saturday
afternoon (class day) under the trees in
"Ben Weed's Amphitheater." on the hill
side adjoining the college campus. The
nature of the performance, which will in
clude a mysterious pageant and a class
dispensation, in which graduates and pro
fessors will be joshed, is being kept a
secret. The seniors declare, however,
that the celebration will eclipse all pre
vious class day performances in the line
of startling effects, and that the cos
tumes in particular will create a sensa
tion. The 200 members of the graduating
class will participate.

NOTICE TO MARINERS.
A branch of the United States Hydrographlc
Office, located in the Merchants' Exchange, is
maintained in San Francisco for the benefit of
mariners without regard to nationality and
free of expense.
Navigators are cordially invited to visit the
office, where complete sets of charts and sail
ing directions of the world are kept on hand
for comparison and reference, and the latest
information can alway3 be obtained regarding
lights, dangers to navigation and all matters
of interest to ocean commerce.
The tlmeball on top of the building on TÂ»lÂ»
rrapb. Hill Is hoisted about ten minutes before
noon, and Is dropped at noon. 120 th meridian,
by telegraphic signal received each day from
the United Btate* Naval Observatory at Mare
Island, Cal.
A notice statin* whether the time ball wÂ«Â»
dropped on time or giving the error, if any. Ie
published thÂ« same day by the afternoon pa-
Der* and by the morning papers the following
Say. J- T. MoMILLAN.
Assistant In Charge.
EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, If any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow In inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. ThÂ« word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" ts inclosed with leobara of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce, an
opposite result.

NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN
The Only Members of the
Guard Remaining in
San Francisco.
Signal Men Who Are Anxious
to Do a Little More Than
Escort Duty.
The Colonel of the Fifth Infantry
Rested on Merita When He
Offered His Sorvioos.
During the past week but little has oc
cupied the attention of those interested
In National Guard matters outside of the
work of enrolling volunteers from the
ranks of the two regiments, the First and
Seventh, selected to lill part of the State's
<juota in response to the President's call
for men to meet the land and naval forces
c Spanish Government.
There is great satisfaction in the fact
that the rejections for physical causes
â¢her causes, principally in the First
Regimen:, did not exceed 22 per cent. It
shows that considerable attention was
; aid to the admission of men in the ranks
of the several companies of the regiment.
The removal of men of the First from
this city leave- it at this time without
any National Guardsmen except the ca
det company attached to the First, those
members of the First who were not ac
d and are still members of the regi
ment, Troop A, cavalry, and the Signal
Corps. .
What is to be done with those men or
the twelve companies who were not ac
cepted has not yet been determined, but
It is probable that the companies will be
recruited so that there will be another
regiment of infantry In this city instead
of skeleton companies. That, however, is
a matter which will not be attended to
until the work of furnishing the State 3
quota shall ihave been disposeu of.
THE FIFTH REGIMENT.
When it became known that the First
and the Seventh Infantry regiments had
been selected for the securing of men
for the two regiments of Infantry of vol
unteers and that the Fifth Infantry had
riven the cold shoulder there was a
great deal of dissatisfaction In the ranks
and the feeling was quite strong- in the
several companies against Colonel v. ts.
anks, it being claimed that he had
not been sufficiently active in the matter
of securing recognition. It has since been
made known to the companies that Col
onel Fairbanks had, like Colonel John S.
Mosby offered his services to the proper
: declaring that his com
: v to follow him. Like
: his claim on his merit as
waited, but he was not
:. Notwithstanding this explanation
there is still a great deal of dissatisfac-
In the ranks, and there is talk in
some of the companies of the members
removing from the locality in which they
: ov are in order to obtain a discharge
from the service of the State on account
of removal. There is a possibility that
i ra will be smoothed over ami that
the men will not retire from the guard.
TROOP A. CAVALRY.
During the past two weeks the members
of Troop A, ('rivalry. Captain Burnett
commanding, have been unusually active
preparing themselves for the field in case
there should be a call for them. The
members are all active young men und
they are anxious to go where they could
engage in cavalry charges and distinguish
themselves. On drill nights i
good attendance and sine- the enthusiasm
inspired bj the war has taken possi
em they have been paying a great
deal of attention to tactics.
THE SIGNAL rnRPS.
Last Saturday, after the Signal Corps
of the Second Brigade had concluded its
duty as escort to the Seventh Regiment
of the National Guard, the meh under
command of Captain Perkins returned to
the armory, exchanged full dress for Ber
vice uniforms, and after lunch went out
by the Point Lobos road to the ocean
beach for v practice march. On the way
out and return by way of the Presidio j
there were a number of company evolu- â 
tiona which were well executed. This
corps, like other branches of the National
Guard Is annoyed by reason of the fact
that it has not been called into service.
The services have been offered to the \\ ar
Department as well as to the National
Guard authorities. The men say that in
times like these their services should be
specially in demand for the purpose of
transmitting messages In those countries
w here telegraphic communications are
not as plentiful as in the United States,
and that they are not only willing to go
anywhere, but are anxious to go where
they can do more than escort duty.
Yesterday, by way of practice, several i
::s were established, one in thia
city, another at Alameda, another at Leo- ;
ua Heights, another at San Lorenzo and \
Mill another at Halls, Aiameda County.
It was the purpose of the members of the
corps to signal the progress of the relay
race to this city. The heliograph worked
all right between the stations in Alameda
County, and during the forenoon the San
Francisco station was discovered and an
answer sent, but In the afternoon a mist
covered the bay and shut <>ut the flashes.
Flag signaling between Leona Heights
Uameda was f. .r the Baxne reason out
of the range of possibility. Between Leo
no Heights and Halls the men had good
practice.
ANNUAL STATIC SHOOT.
Those members of the gvard who will
not bo taken Into the State"s quota are
somewhat anxious about the State shoot
which, according to regulations, must
be held this month. As near a~s can be
made out, from the somewhat obscure
regulations which have not yet been
amended to make them comprehensive,
this is the month for skirmish liring. The
amended orders or regulations for firing
have not yet been Issued, although there
was a meeting of Inspectors of riile prac
tice for the purpose of discussing the
matter sonic time ago. Nor lias the order
lor the shoot yet been issued, so that the
men are in doubt if they will have to
shoot under th< old regulations or under
the amended ones, that is, if they are
to be amended.
THE NAVAL MILTTIA.
The commanding officer of the Naval
Militia, Captain L. H. Turner, having re
turned from a business trip to Alaska,
is anxious to go with his men to the
front, but as no action has yet been taken
by the authorities at Washington in re
gard to the naval force <>f this State, the
officers and members of the militia are
waiting orders. In the meantime all the
men are engaged several times a week
perfecting themselves in drill, both for
ship and shore duty. There is just a
possibility that the officers and men may
be assigned to duty on one of the coast
defense vessels, but it is only a remote
possibility.
A TASTARDLY CRIME.
George Stevens Charges Henry Vice
With Throwing Carbolic Acid
in His Face.
George Stevens, a plumber living on
Brftdy street, was taken to the Receiving
Hospital early yesterday morning with
his face badly burned by carbolic acid,
and he had a narrow escape from losing
his eyesight.
He stated that two days ago he had
a Quarrel with Henry Vice, who lives in
the lodging house at 812 Hush street.
Stevens was in the lodging house early
yesterday morning calling upon a friend,
and as he was leaving he passed Vice and
George Shine, who were talking together.
Just as he passed, Vice threw something
In his face, and he shrieked with pain.
Policpma.il Hutchlngs was notified and he
took Stevens to the hospital, where it
was found that his face had been burned
with carbolic acjd.
Vice is well known to the police, and
Crtectives were searching for him y.-stor
dav. but were unable to find him. When
arrested a felony charge will be booked
against him.
Stevens declared there â¢ s no woman
in the case. The only can.- * for the quar
rel was about Vice using btevens room
rwithout his permission.
TROOP SHIPS
FOR MANILA
Several Vessels in Port
That Can Be Put in
Commission.
To Transport Nine Thousand
Men Nine Vessels Will
Be Necessary.
Lively Work Required to Secure
ThÂ«t I*umb=r and Oot Them
Away on Tlma
"If troops are to be sent to Ma
nila at once what vessels are going to
carry them?" was the main topic of con- i
versatlon on the water front yesterday, j
Not only are the National Guardsmen In- j
terested In the question, but the general |
public as well. In consequence every pos- |
slble carrier was examined by eager
crowds during the day, and hundreds of
the militia were scattered over the front j
from Meiggs wharf to the Mall dock and '
gathering in groups in front of ocean-go
tag steamers. All of them wanted to get ;
a look at the City of Peking, and much j
disappointment was felt when the day
gradually wore away and there was still j
no sign of the big liner.
Word was sent to Captain Smith at
Honolulu to rush the Peking up, and it
was generally supposed that she would
reach here last Friday, although her â 
schedule did not call for her appearance \
until Saturday.
Still, she may have been detained at the
islands or she may even be in quaran
tine. Smallpox and the bubonic plague
are prevalent at Hongkong, and a case ;
of either one or the other may have de
veloped during the voyage.
The vessels in port or expected here i
during the next forty-eight hours that
could be used as transports for men,
horses, munitions of war and coal are the |
Australia, Mariposa, Ohio, City of Pu
ebla, Leelanaw. City of Peking, City of
Sydney, Progreso, Washtenaw and Wll
lamette. Of these the Australia Is ready
to be fitted out at a moment's notice, the ;
Ohio is discharging at Harrison street
wharf, the City of Puebla is to sail on
Wednesday next for Puget Sound ports,
the Leelanaw is discharging coal at Mis
sioil street wharf, while the City of Syd
ney is on her way here from Panama and ,
the Progreso, Washtenaw and Willamette
from Puget Sound.
The Martposa was moved to the re
finery yesterday to discharge the sugar
she brought from Honolulu, and unless j
she is pressed into Uncle Sam's service
will begin loading general cargo for Aus
tralasian ports to-day. The Ohio and (
naw were brought out here from the
East for the St. Michael trade, and it
would not take long to fit them out to
carry a large number of troops. The
Progreso carries 3000 tons, the Washte
naw 4000 tons and the Willamette 2400
tons of coal. They are now on their way
here with black diamonds. The big Aus
trian collier Burma and the Nor
wegian whaleback Titania are now ;
on their way from Nanaimo, B. C, with
about 10,000 tons of coal between them, I
bo they would fill up the American steam- ;
> re I'rogreso. Washtenaw and Willamette
in short order. The latter vessels aro
bringing down Seattle coal, but as the
Nanaimo article is a much better fuel
for steamers Uncle Sam would be sure to
s.-nd it. As men experienced in the pas
_ r trade say it will require at ieast
nine vessels to move 0,000 troops to Ma
nila, it Will thus be seen that if It comes i
to pending the men away in a hurry the
Government has not a groat number ot i
vessels to pick and choose from.
Many of the business men on the water
front hare been left short handed by the
call to arms. There is not a store on East
street but what has lost one or more of
the assistants, but every one of them was
given leave at a moment's notice, and in
nearly every case their pay goes on juat
the same. At the Ferry Cafe "Teddy"
Osborn's brothers got the summons while
th<y were at work behind the counter.
"Off you go." said "Ted," and without de
lay Will and Arthur changed their coats
and marched to the armory, where they
were sworn in. They are now In camp
with the rest of me boys at the Presidio.
Will and Arthur are in clover, as they not
only draw full pay from their brother, but
will also draw a small sum from the
United States treasury each month. With
"Ted" it is different, however, as he now
has to stand a double watch in order to
even up with the expense sheet.
Captain Chisholm of the British ship
Blackbraes has arrived in San Francisco
to superintend the repairs to the Wllls
cott. The latter vessel was caught In a
hurricane while on her way from Japan
to Portland and was dismasted. She put
in here in distress. Captain Mitchell will
take the Willscott to England as soon as
she Is repaired and chartered.
Frank Conley. while skylarking at the
' Rlsdon Iron Works yesterday, fell on a
piece of iron and broke his jaw. Dr. Green
. attended to him at the Harbor Receiving
! Hospital.
The river steamer George M. Stoney,
built for the Hayne party that went to
Kotzebue Sound on the bark Alaska, will
have her trial trip to-day. She will carry
about thirty people and their baggage on
: a very light draught, and will be used on
the Kubuck River. She will be taken up
on thp hark Northern Light and will be
turned over to the Hayne party at Kotze
bue Sound. Captain Ludlow, formerly of
the whaling bark Mars, will go up as
master of her and M. Eckley will be the
engineer. The George M. Stoney is a pro
i peller boat and is the first of her kind
! built on this Coast. As the propellers are
j greater in diameter than the draft of the
vessel they are covered by a water-tight
j box, which the wheel fills as soon as it
begins to revolve, and thus gives a solid
body of water in which to work.
Another river steamer for the Kubuck
will also have her trial trip to-day. She is
called the Kotzebue, and will act as a ten
der for the barkentine Jane A. Falkin
burg. ______^_^____
SHAKKEY TO "ACT."
The Pug-ilist Will Appear in "The
Ensign" This Week.
Friedlander, Gottlob & Co. have con- )
tracted with Tom Sharkey to appear at !
the California Theater to-night and dur- j
ing the week as one of the sailor boys !
who fights the enemy on the steamer j
San Jacinto in the naval drama "The
Knsisjn." Sharkey will not alone have a
thinking part. He has been given some
lines in the play and will end up by a ;
round with William Baker, who defeated
Stelzner. Sharkey was for some time
mapter-at-arms on the Philadelphia and
knows all about a war vessel. It Is said ;
that Sharkey contemplates adopting the i
stage as did" Corbett and Fltzsimmons. !
The sailor lad has had numerous offers :
to star, and he probably will do so after i
his debut in this city.
T<>-nisht he will appear in his regula- ,
tion sailor costume, and he is on the stage ;
In every act.
"Confessing Christ."
Rev. H. T. Shepa.rd of the Olivet Con- i
gregational Church at Seventeenth and j
Noe streets spoke on "Confessing Christ" j
Last evening before a large and inter- â¢
es'ted congregation. In part he said: i
"As the world grows older the thought of ;
a heavenly power and a life hereafter
i serms to be deeper embedded in the j
: minds of all liberty-loving and civilized
human beings. The teachings of the Al- !
mighty are given more thought, and as
we wend our devious ways through life
we silently think of religion and its
teachings, and in time we are brought !
within the circle which is purity itse-lf, !
for where the thoughts of God exist
all must be pure. At some time we con
fess our belief for him who is our Savior :
and pass the remainder of our lives In ;
peace."
PATRIOTIC WOODMEN.
Redwood Camp at its last held meeting
decided, in view of the fact that a num
ber of the members had enlisted to serve
the country and defend the flag, that the
assessments and dues of such members
not voluntarily paid by the relatives or
friends of the soldier "Woodmen should
be paid out of the general fund of the
camp. It also favored the raisinr of a
fund by special per capita tax of 25 cents
to pay for special nurses on the field for
sick or wounded Woodmen.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAT 9, 1898.
PERFORATED
THE TARGETS
At Shell Mound Many
Good Scores Were
Made.
Marksmen of All Classes Com
peted for Medals and Glory
Besides.
The Regular Monthly Shoot* of Va
rloub Verelns and Other Riflo
and Pietol Clubs.
If by some unforeseen accident tfie tar
gets at Shell Mound had been suddenly
' changed into a row of Spaniards, or in
j fact any other human beings, yesterday
I there would have been a few funerals to
j follow. The second monthly shoot of the
! Independent Riflemen, the San Francisco
! Schuetzen Verein monthly medal shoot,
the monthly medal and competition shoot
| of the German Schuetzen Club, the month
!ly bullseye shoot of the Norddeutsche
! Schuetzen Club and the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club all lined up to the points
'â¢ of position on the range, and the scores
( made by many proved that there are
crack shots in the various organizations.
1 From early in the day until late at
i night the crack of the rifle and pistol
could be heard, and at the close of the
game there were many who regretted that
; the day was over and another month
i must elapse before they meet to com
pete in their monthly exhibitions and
medal competitions. Although the wind
was slightly high, it did not seem to
i Interfere with the marksmen, and as the
; day was bright and clear the trouble so
! often experienced of having the targets
shaded was not noticeable. The scores
follow:

FINANCES UNDER
THE NEW CHARTER
k Deficit of More Than a Million Dollars
Each Year.
in Annual Increase of Expenditures of More Than Half a
Million Dollars.
In order that the voters of the City and County of San Francisco might
be fully informed upon the financial provisions of the new charter which will
be voted upon at the coming election. The Call asked Auditor Broderick to
make an estimate of receipts and! expenditures under it, making the same
showing that would be made to any accredited official who might ask for
It. The following table gives the Auditor's figures and puts the whole mat
ter clearly before the reader. â¢
It must be remembered that in this table there is no estimate for In
crease in street lighting, water supply, hydrants, lighting public buildings,
repairs to or building hospitals, new parks or zoological gardens, purchase
of sites for schoolhouses or for the acquisition of public utilities.
According to this table it will be seen that there will be an increase In
expenditures provided by the new charter over those under the old system
of $593,435. It is estimated that during the present year there . will be a
deficit of $100,000. This added to the present appropriation makes a grand
total to be raised of $6,183,988, and as the total amount that can be raised
under the new charter will be but $5,062,200,. it will be necessary to raise,
either by taxation, increased license fees or continually amending the char
ter, the sum of $1,121,788 in order to keep things running.
Following is the table as prepared by Auditor Broderick:

made under provision of the new cnarter.

HIS CHARTER VIEWS.
Mayor Phelan Before the Second
Unitarian Church.
Mayor Phdan addressed a large audi
ence last night at the Second Unitarian
Church. His subject was "The Charter-
Its Good Qualities and Why It Should
Become the Fundamental Law of This
Community." The Mayor went Into the
subject of one-man power at some length.
He thought that instead of Inaction, unity
of purpose would result and the best ends
be obtained.
Bribery and corruption also received a
large part or the Mayor's attention. He
6aid that these two undermining and
ovll practices were the cause of the pol
lution of politics to-day and that with the
new charter purity would be secured of
necessity, since the restraints in the fun
damental law of the charter are such as
to mako fraud or corruption practically
impossible.
The Mayor concluded with an appeal to
civic patriotism and the needs of it in this
city.
A LARGE ENTRY LIST.
Many Pretty and Nohle Dogs That
Will Pose for the Children's
Hospital Fund.
F.i tries for the dog show to ba held by j
the 6an Francisco Kennel Cluo closed at ,
midnight last night. There were then 600 j
entile* and the mails were yet to be ]
heard from. Entries made by letter post
ed before 12 o'clock last night would be
received, and so far the list of dogs that \
will be on the benches will exceed in ;
numbers any show yet held. The show i
will open on May 18 at the Mechanics' |
Pavilion and the proceeds will be devoted
CO the funds of the Children's Hospital. I
SHABKEY AT SUTBO'S.
The crowd yesterday was all at the Su
tro Baths to see "the pride of the navy"
ewim. Sharkey was matched against Leo !
Ratto for 220 yards, and the decision was !
what Sharkey thought it ought to have j
been for the Friday night fightâ a draw.
The other races out there were merely
preliminaries to tue event of the after
noon, nevertheless some exceedingly good
swimming was done.
C. P. Huntington visited the Park Mu
seum yesterday and expressed himself
much pleased with the exhibit. He pre
sented the museum with six valuable pic
tures, one of them being of particular in
terest, that of a landscape entitled, "For
est and Lake," by J. J. Mylchrist.
The young artist was born without i
arms, and the picture was painted with
his toes.
John Daggett, late Superintendent of i
the Tnited States Mint, added to his large
collection of Northern California Indian
relics and curiosities in the museum
about 200 more specimens, consisting of
baskets, culinary utensils, war imple
ments, costumes of buckskin, some efab
orately ornamented with beads, stone Im
plements and deer antlers.
The Chutes yesterday had the averagâ¬
attendance and the living pictures pleased
the many who saw them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 9, 1898.
A WHEEL AHEAD,
BAY CITY WON
The Club's Fourth Successive Victory Over
the Great Relay Course.
Fannan, the Los Angeles Wonder, Snowed Marvelous Speed,
Garden Citys Finished Second, Olympics Third.
At the game of cycle relay racing the
Bay City Wheelmen are simply unbeat
able. For the fourth successive time the
team of ten men from this club placed to
their credit yesterday the annual 100-mile
relay race promoted by the California
Associated Cycling Clubs, the Derby
event in wheel racing on the Pacific
Coast, and having won the Varney cup
by their victories in the first three they
now have possession of the handsome
Leavitt & Bill trophy, a beautiful $250
cup, which will make an elegant addition
to their silver closet.
The race was from this city to San Jose
via San Mateo and Menlo Park and
thence back to Alameda via Milpitas and
Centerville, each of the ten couriers
riding his allotted ten miles of the total
100 covered. The five clubs entering teams
were the Bay City Wheelmen and Olym
pic Club Wheelmen, San Francisco; Gar
den City Wheelmen, San Jose; Reliance
Club Wheelmen and Acme Club Wheel
men. Oakland.
The men lined up facing Starter Jack
McGlynn a few minutes before the ap
pointed time, and there was considerable
excitement among those interested, owing
to the alignment of the men. They were
spread across Larkin stret about five feet
apart facing south, and it was evident
FURMAN WINNING THE GREAT RELAY RACE
that the minute they were off all five would
make a dash for the cable slot on the
right-hand side, and If all made It about
the same time there would be a big
smash-up.
Harry Fowler of the Bay City Wheel
men was the first off whpn the word was
given, and bumping over the cobbles land
ed right side up on the slot, inches ahead
of Launcelot Smith, the Olympic flyer.
Hardenbrook of San Jose and Ferris,
Acme, had to fight for their positions, the
latter finally falling back, while Rosen
helm, Reliance, rather than take chances
of a spill, held back for the last position.
They were soon out of sight down
Ninth street, cheered along by their ex
cited friends and club mates all the way.
Then the crowd at the start quickly dis
persed and drifted downtown to await
the bulletined results of the first few
relays, and then crossed over to Alameda
to see the finish about 2 o'clock In the
afternoon.
The first relay, leading out of the city
and over the Six Mile Hill and the San
Bruno, Is usually productive of a good
many accidents owing to the turns, the
grades and rough character of the sur
face. But the bunch got through yester
day with but one accident of moment.
Rosenhelm had a bad fall near the end
and lost about four minutes for his club.
This setback lost the Reliance boys all
chance of winning the race, for a stern
chase is a long one and they never made
up for that accident on the first relay,
finishing as they started. In last place.
Ferris punctured his wheel, bui borrowed
another and continued. Hardenbrook
was credited with beating Fowler two
seconds across the tape, though some
thought the judges were rattled and that
the decision should have been reversed.
The order and time made was as fol
lows:

On the second relay, ending at San
Mateo, Tony Delmas maintained the Gar
den City Wheelmen's slight lead and in
creased it twenty-five seconds. The
Olympics had a mishap here which coat
them third place. The bunch got along
well together, and crossed some bad
stretches of road approaching San Bruno
at a cracking pace. Delmas was in the
lead slightly, with Felix (Bay City) and
Tantau (Olympic) close up. Tantau's
front wheel "kissed" Felix's rear tire and
down he went, bruising himself consider
ably, but fortunately not breaking his
â¢wheel. Schleuter (Acme) swept by Tan
tau and gained third place, but the
plucky Olympian was soon remounted
and off again to regain lost ground.

There was a speedy lot on the third
course from San Mateo past Belmont and
Redwood to the outskirts of Menlo Park.
They were all light, swift riders, calcu
lated to scorch over the smooth roads
thereabouts at lightning speed, and they
did it. Ben Noonan gained 10 seconds
here for the Bay Citys over the Garden
Citys' lead, and the San Jose boys were
in front for the last time in the race.
Noonan was but 15 seconds back of first
place, and led the Acme and Olympic
men I*4 and 2 minutes respectively. Re
liance was here 7 minutes behind the
leaders.
After the race Thorn, through his
father, who is also an enthusiastic wheel
man, filed a protest stating that Noonan
had been paced, an infringement of the
rules. The Bay Citys laugh at this pro
test and term It a boyish trick. Presi
dent Kerrigan said: "If we had a man
In our club fast enough to lead and pace
Ben Noonan, we would have had him on
the team and not skylarking along the
road as a pacemaker. Ben Noonan don't
need pacing to beat any man on the third
relay." Thorn, when auestioned about
the matter by a Call reporter, could not
give an explicit statement, but said he
paw a big fellow in front of Noonan and
thought he was pacing him. The Bay
Citys declare the allegod "big man '
might have be^n a tourist, and as Thorn
was in front of Noonan all the way, he
could not have been vary certain about it.
Noonan punctured his wheel two miles
from the finish and rode that distance on
a flat tire, and was still able to beat the
time of all others.

naud (Bay City) started 15 seconds behind
Clark (Garden City), but caught him In
less than a mile and beat him out a full
minute. Clark made a poor showing,
dropping his club back from first to fourth
position. The honors of this relay easily
rest with young Russ. whose father is
the treasurer of the Olympic Club. He
rode the course n minute and a half faster
than anybody else, and brought the Olym
pic colors up to second place.

The fastest time of the entire race for
any one stretch of ten miles was made
over the fifth relay by Frank G. Peck of
Yuba City, one of the speedy Bay City
men. His time was 25 minutos flat, and
he finished as strong as he started. Peck
is a rider who has developed within the
past year and was "discovered" by the
Bay Citys on one of their racing pilgrim
ages to Sacramento last spring. He was
looked upon as one of the swiftest riders
of their team yesterday and did not belie
his reputation.

Peck was closely pressed, however, as

tute for Roy Bridgeman of the Garden
City team, pressed him closely.
The sixth relay led the men through the
streets of San Jose, and had many sharp
turns and crossings, but all got through
without a mishap except Walter David
son (Bay City). The chain slipped from
his wheel, and here was where the value
of the "trailer" was illustrated. His club
mate, Bert Menne, was only a block away
and soon caught up. They effected a
rapid change of mounts and Davidson
was on his way again, having only lost
about half a minute by his mishap, which
he had to spare, so that his club was still
ahead at the end of the sixth.

The seventh relay was productive of
some excitement. Before the men started
an accident happened to Sampson, Acme.
He was riding toward the start to take
up his position and made too sharp a
turn, falling and sustaining severe
bruises to his hands. But he rode out
the relay as good as any of them.
John Davidson, brother of Walter of
the sixth, was off In the lead, followed
by his trailer, John McGillvray of ama
teur baseball fame. Fifteen seconds later
he was followed by Stanley (Olympic),
with his trailer, A. Bozio. Both David
son and McGillvray claimed to have
turned in their seats and seen Bozlo
pacing Stanley, to which effect Davidson
protested to the referee, Captain H. T.
Emery, at the finish. So to even up mat
ters Bozlo and Stanley protested David
son on the grounds that McGillvray paced
him. There the matter rests for action
by the racing board.

wanted to pace Bozlo (Olympic) away
from Bob Black, the Bay Citylte. To
this Charley Craft, the Bay City trailer,
strenuously objected, but had to warn
Stevens off three times before he would
quit. Bacon (Reliance) made a meri
torious ride here, and B. J. Smith, the

hold up his end easily, lost over three
minutes. Bozlo punctured his tire near

Leandro Wing tried the trick wh e h has
won him many a race, that of jumpng
away from his contestants and securing
a lead which could not be overcome. Bui
he encountered a new experience, lhia
opponent could "jump" as fast as he
could, and as soon as \\ ing would let up
be would glance up to find a smiling, in
quiring face alongside of him from the
owner of which never a word escaped
but who looked as if he wanted to sa> ,
"Well, you see, I'm still with you.
Wing soon tired of this game and
slowed up, and before they had reached
Elmhurst C. M. Smith, who beats the
locomotives at their own game down San ,
Jose way, was up with them, having
caught up over a minute's lost time in
spite of the pace they were setting. Wit
nesses claim that Smith was paced up
by Gail Hardenbrook of his own club,
who rode the first relay, but ttoe^ Racing
Board has not been officially notified of
ai Aro > und e the corner into Central
avenue tney swung, Furman, Wing and
Smith in the lead, followed by halt a ,
dozen trailers and such otheri as were
able to keep up the gait. It was as
pretty a finish as could well be wished I
for Wing let out his links two blocks ,
away from the tape, but he was "baked :
and the effort soon died out. Uing is
said to be suffering from a severe cold I
and was handicapped in his breathing
to some extent. .
Then "Bunt" Smith moved up a few
notches and tried to assume the lead, but
that big fellow with the crimson and gold
collars over his massive shoulders was
there and somehow "Bunt" could not
gain on him. They swept through the
throngs of people crowded on each Bide
of the street and yelling and cheering for
their favorites. A block from the tape
Furman decided to reach it first, and im
mediately daylight began to show be
tween him and the bunch. With a dash
he was off and down the street on a
sprint that electrified the spectators
Tearing after him came the others, but it
was no use. Not even the mighty Wing
nor the invincible Smith, the locomotive
chaser could contend with that sprint.
'Hooray!" yelled the Bay Citys gath
ered at the tape, and the race was won.

The crowd did not disperse until long
after the finish. They wanted to get
close to this wonder from the South and
have a good look at him. So Furtnan
held a levee on the sidewalk, while Doctor
Dodge took his packet away from him
and conveyed it to Mr. Forderer. the
President of the Board of Trustees of
Alameda, standing near. In the packet,
which each club furnished, was a dupli
cate letter from Mayor Phelan of this
city to Mr. Forderer, as follows:
Mayor's Office,
San Francisco, May 3, 1898.
Hon. Joseph Forderer, President of the
Board of Trustees, City of Alameda â Dear Sir:
<>n May 8, IS!>S, five contestants will start from
this city on a bicycle relay race around the
Bay of San Francisco with a letter similar to
