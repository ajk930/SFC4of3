ON BOARD THE HERALD-CALL DISPATCH BOAT,
OFF PORT ANTOXIO, via Kingston, Jamaica, June 13. â Fur
ther details of the fight at Guantanamo show that the Spanish lacked
the courage to attempt to earn- the ridge by a bayonet charge. They
adopted bushwhacking tactics, which made the men on the ridge
weary, though they showed unflinching courage throughout the
whole engagement.
Captain G. F. Elliott of Company C, who is an old warhorse,
stalked about camp giving advice to his men, who smiled in re
sponse through the flashes of the rifles.
First Lieutenant J. E. Mahoney of Company E, when a man
fired accidentally, strode to his side, restraining him in one breath
and encouraging him in the next.
Lieutenant-Colonel R. Y. Huntington, calm and watchful,
passed through the gloom with Adjutant H. L. Draper and Quar
termaster Charles L. Macawley, going the rounds as though night
attacks were merely a matter of ordinary detail.
Surely soldiers never had better examples than those which
their officers afforded. Daylight was slow in coming.
The Cuban colonel, who acted as guide and scout, said: "The
Spanish will make an attempt to carry the ridge with a rush at day
break."
The marines replied that they hoped that light would come
soon, so that they might be able to see the Spanish uniforms at
close range. The defenders of the ridge grew very impatient at the
slow arrival of dawn. When the darkness finally began to melt
away the marines could see the Spaniards dodging about in the
green lines of the thicket. As their firing grew hotter the Spanish
uniforms became scarcer. Then came the news of the death of Ser
geant Charles H. Smith.
The Spaniards removed their dead and wounded, but blood
stains in the nearest positions which they had occupied during the
night told that the volleys fired by the marines had been effective.
The Marblehead at 6 o'clock Sunday morning signaled that
the enemy was seen over to the right. The twelve-pounder in the
camp of the marines was trained in that direction and opened fire on
what proved to be a body of infantry.
The Texas arrived after sunrise, and as the Spanish firing was
increased, it was concluded that Colonel Huntington wanted rein
forcements. Captain J. R. Phillips landed forty marines with two
Colt automatic guns. Twenty marines from the Marblehead fol
lowed, and the Marblehead moved slowly southward, throwing
shells in the direction of the enemy's flank.
The guns from the Texas were dragged slowly up the zigzag
path to the earthworks on the crest of the ridge occupied by the
camp.
Colonel Huntington decided that it would be useless to sacri
fice his men by keeping them where they were. While one com
pany deployed in skirmish line and moved against the enemy, the
main body retreated under cover to a position behind the earth
works, where the guns from the Texas and two field pieces are now
mounted.
One man from the Herald-Call dispatch boat remained all
night with the marines, and with the others mounted the slope. At
io o'clock in the morning the Spaniards opened fire with one gun
directly across the bar from our position on the ridge, and also
opposite the Texas and Herald-Call dispatch boat Somers N.
Smith. They aimed at the Texas, the Smith and the collier. This
gun commanded the camp. Before the Spaniards found the range
the Texas opened fire from both broadsides, shelling the brush
north of the camp of the marines at short range, and also shelling
the gun which just began firing from such an unexpected quarter,
northwest of the bay.
The collier Abarendos opened with her three-inch gun on the
Spanish position in the mountains. That Spanish gun was silenced
in five minutes. Then, moving southward, the Marblehead opened
a flanking fire on the Spaniards who were engaging Colonel Hunt
mgton's skirmishers. Between the roar of the big guns could be
heard the splutter of the automatic pieces. The rifle bullets hummed
across the deck of the Texas, one striking near Captain Phillips
while I was talking with him. The Panther was struck by bullets
frequently. On the ships the only man who suffered was the Cuban
pilot on the Marblehead, who was shot in the leg. The Marblehead
was still firing at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
At that time Colonel Huntington's skirmishers were still away,
striking their tents in the advanced position. It was the general
opinion that the marines could hold their position, but only by stiff
fighting. The men were all worn out by fatigue and loss of sleep.
Troops are expected here to-day, and if they have not been sent the
delay can only have been caused by criminal negligence at Wash
ington.

SPAIN READY
TO CONSIDER
PEACE OFFER
Eager to flccept Arjy Proposal
TJ)at "Does Not Emanate
From the Enemy."
BRUSSELS, June 13.â A special Madrid correspondent of the Petit
Bleau of this city has telegraphed an Interview which he claims to
have had with Senor Morino, the private secretary of the Spanish Pre
mier, Senor Sagasta, in which the secretary is quoted as having form
ally declared that the Spanish Government would now accept any
peace proposal which was submitted "on the express condition that it
does not emanate from the enemy." But the Premier's secretary is
said to have added:
"The international mediation which would be especially welcomed
on the part of Spain would be in the case of the initiative being taken
by France or Austria."
tack, had worked all day to get his hospital ready for the wounded.
He paid no heed to the Spanish bullets which cut through the can
vas of his tent. When his task had been completed, as a steady vol
ley from the Spaniards swept over the ridge, he walked out to see
how the men were faring. When he
was fifteen feet from the hospital a
Mauser bullet pierced his temple. He
was carried to the shelter of the trench
which marines had dug on first landing
and laid there in a sheltered spot. His
case was hopeless from the first. Half
an hour later Lieutenant Neville hur
ried Into camp saying: "Where is Sur
geon Gibbs? Ona of my men Is
wounded."
The hospital orderly saluted and said:
"Surgeon Gibbs died a moment ago,
sir." Surgeon Gibbs' mother lives in
Richmond. He was a volunteer of a
few weeks' standing and was extremely
popular. He was absolutely fearless.
First Lieutenant W. C. Neville and
Second Lieutenant M. J. Shaw of Com
pany D were cut off from the main
body for the night, while the post held
by the marines was aflame and an al
most continuous rattle showed tha
desperate engagements In advance and
to the right. The lieutenants defended
themselves successfully and fought
their way slowly back toward camp.
They abandoned Sergeant Charles H.
Smith's body only when it became
plain that many lives must be sacri
ficed in bringing it away under the
withering fire.
Once several guerrilla skirmishers
passed almost through the marines'
camp on the edge of the crest and dis
appeared to the northward. They were
quickly lost in the peculiar darkness of
the tropical brush. Sometimes the
range was so short that our officers
were using their revolvers, firing when
they saw flashes.
Admiral Sampson early last week re
solved to await no longer the coming
of American troops before seeking to
establish a landing spot at some point
not far east af Santiago. He decided
to seize Guantanamo Bay, owing to its
many advantages as a rendezvous for

admiral on Wednesday communicated
his decision to Commander McCall of
the Marblehead who, with the Yankee
and St. Louis, left Santiago at 4
o'clock on Thursday morning to carry
out the plan.
As I have indicated In previous dis
patches, Admiral Sampson has been
Impatient over the delay In sending
troops to aid in the capture of San
tiago. It has been his desire to estab
lish a base on the southern coast of
Cuba, and Captain Cervera's course In
seeking a refuge in Santiago harbor
seemed to him to make that the best
point from which to direct American
operations.
It became evident to the admiral,
however, that he would be left without
a base indefinitely if he continued to
wait for the arrival of troops and he re
solved to select some advantageous
point forthwith. The blockade of San
tiago seemed likely to continue for
some time, and the United States had
no base of supplies nearer than Key
West. The fleet was much in need of a
safe harbor on the southern coast,
where warships could coal and trans
fer provisions from the provision ships.
Coaling at sea, although skillfully ac
complished by Commodcrre Schley's ves
sels off Santiago, is very precarious In
rough weather. This made it impera
tive to secure a harbor where the col
liers, supply ships and torpedo ships
could safely He in all kinds of weather,
and where troopships could lie when
they should arrive. In view of this sit
uation the selection of Guantanamo
Bay was most natural. Its advantages
for American purposes are second only
to Santiago, and no Spanish fleet with
such a skillful commander as Admiral
Cervera would have to be reckoned
with after the land defenses were de
stroyed.
Guantanamo Bay is about forty miles
from Santiago and is admirably suited

to Sampson's purpose. It Is one of the
largest and finest harbors on the en
tire coast of Cuba. It consists of two
land-locked bays, one of which could
easily accomodate a large number of
ships. The inner ba- is separated from
the outer by a narrow tortuous channel
navigable only with great care. On the
Inner bay is situated the town of Cai
manera, garrisoned by 3000 Spanish
troops and protected by a fort and sev
eral gun boats.
The fort Is quite a pretentious mili
tary structure, built on a small tongue
of land which puts across the channel
between the outer and inner bay. It
completely covers the entrance, and
ships in entering must pass within fifty
yards of its guns. It is built of yellow
stone. The extensive barracks adjoin
ing seem in good condition and present
a much more formidable appearance
than the castles which frown above
the entrance to Santiago harbor.
Knowing the value of Guantanamo
Bay to the Americans, the Spaniards
made as powerful and desperate a re
sistance as they could.
NOW WELL
ON THE WAY
TO CUBA
Over pifteen Thousapd
Troops Sail prom
Key West.
Arriving at Santiago on Thursday,
No Time Will Be Lost in TaK
ing That City.
WASHINGTON, June 13.â The first army of invasion
to Cuba is now well on its way, thirty-two transport steam
ships, bearing over 15,000 officers and men, convoyed by bat
tleships, cruisers, gunboats and auxiliary craft, sixteen in
number, having actually sailed from Key West at daybreak
this morning.
An authoritative statement to this
effect was made at the War Depart
ment to-day, setting at rest all reports
that the expedition was on Its way, or
had landed last week. The authorities
made the announcement for the reason
that the time for secrecy was passed
as the scout boats had made sure that
the path was clear before it and that
no possible menace could come from the
Spanish ships or troops, even should
the enemy know that our forces were
now advancing against them. With
the expedition off officials here feel that
there will be a period of comparative
inaction for a few days.
By Thursday at the latest the trans
ports will be off Santiago and a large
American army will make its landing
on Cuban soil. Admiral Sampson has
cleared the way for this undertaking
and little danger is apprehended In
getting ashore. It will be after that,
when the advance is made, that the
actual developments may be expected.
By that time it is likely the American
commanders will be in direct cable
communication with the authorities
here. Admiral Sampson has taken the
shore end of the cable landing at Guan
tanamo and a force of cable experts
are rapidly restoring the line to work
ing order.
The progress of this work has been
so satisfactory that one of the leading
officials of the State Department said
to-day that it was hoped that direct
cable communication would be estab
lished by Thursday. It will put an end
to the dearth of official information
concerning Important movements and
will enable the authorities here to keep

this size for at least sixty days. Every
detail for the landing of this party has
been worked out by the engineer corps
of the army. It will be a laborious pro
cess at best, and will take a full day
or more. The point of landing has been
bo chosen that there is little danger of

Will insure ample protection until the
troops can care for themselves.
The Spanish Cadiz fleet is almost as
much <>f a mystery to the naval officers
here as was Admiral Cervera's flying
squadron during the two weeks im
mediately preceding its inglorious
bottling up at Santiago. To-day a re
port came that the squadron was unfit
for Bea. That would have been credited
except tli it the department has had in
formation aa late as Saturday to the
effect that the squadron was already at
eea and was about to depart. About
a week before that it had been told that
the Cadiz fleet had sailed. Having in
mind these conflicting reports, the War
Board scarcely knows where to give
credence, though it would seem to be
an extraordinary circumstance that the
least doubt could exist as to the pres
ence in or absence from the harbor of
a populous city such as Cadiz of a whole
BQuadron of warships. However, the
weight of opinion seems to incline to
tlif presence of the fleet at Cadiz, owing
to the bad condition of the ships. It
may be noted, however, that although
acting vi I(| n this belief, as shown by
the beginning of the military invasion
iba, the War Hoard is taking no
chances of a surprise, and, by means
of BCOUts, has provided for securing
y warning of the approach of any
â  force to the seat of war.
The news of the attack by the Rpan

PLANS OF POWERS TO
TREAT FOR PEACE
Spain Seems to Be Banking on a Pos
sible Combination Against
the Unites States.
PARTS. June 13.â The Temps this af
ternoon publishes a dispatch from Ma
drid in which it is said that the com
munications exchanged by high offi
cials at Madrid, Vienna and Berlin do
not treat directly of peace, but that
"an important view of the situation
may arise out of Germany's hostile at
titude to the development of American
Intervention in the Philippine Islands."
In connection with the reported in
tention of the United States to occupy
the Ladrone and Caroline Islands, it hi
pointed out in the dispatch that Ger
many has long desired Ponape as a
coaling station.
As the Spanish Cabinet does not con
sider the moment at hand to discuss
peace, the dispatch continues, "The
war party and the press interpret the
international pour parlers as an indi
cation of an understanding and a com
bination possibly leading to European
co-operation against the United
Suites."
MADRID, June 13.â A semi-official
note issued to-day emphatically contra
dicts all the American reports of opera- i
tions In Cuba and even denies that the
Americans have effected a landing in j
Gu.tntanamo Bay or elsewhere. The
note concludes: "The European powers
will make a mistake in imagining that
Spain Is discouraged and at the end of i
her resources. On the contrary, Spain
is full of hope and determined to con- j
tinue the war."

JOE LEITER
FORCED TO
THE WALL
Now the "Young Napoleon"
of the Wheat Pit Is
Unloading.
Financial Backers Desert Him and
He Is Compelled to Be^in
Liquidation.
CHICAGO, June 13.â This has been a
day of excitement and wild rumor in
the Chicago wheat pit. A reverse that
looks like a Waterloo has come to the
"young Napoleon of finance," Joseph
Loiter. At first there was a wild tum
ble of prices on the boara, July wheat
selling down 1 cent from Saturday's
close, while September lost 4%c and
December 3%c, but all made a little re
covery before the close.
It was given out that Leiter had or
dered his deals all closed and a selling
rush was the result of the execution of
this order, accompanied as it was by a
flood of rumors concerning the stability
of the big bull movement which for
months has been the important factor
on the Board of Trade dealings. One
of these rumors was that Leiter had
been deserted by some of his associates
in the campaign. In the meantime
prices were becoming demoralized.
Letter's wheat was being tumbled and
later in the day Leiter made no at
tempt to conceal the fact that he had

Grief on the Floor of the Chicago Wheat Pit.
sold out all his holdings in futures,
probably 5, >,i) 00 bushels of
wheat, it i line out that he had trans
ferred most of his trades in futures to
other well-known business houses and
that they were pretty well protected
by margins, so that whatever losses
there were would fall upon Leiter. His
cash wheat, one report said, was trans
ferred to Armour, but a later story was
that it would be "trusteed" and handled
in such a way as to prevent the slump
which would be inevitable if all were
thrown on the market at once.
Before the final close the panic partly
subsided and July reacted 4 cents, Sep
tember selling up 1% cents and De
cember making 2 cents raliy, selling a
shade above September, where it was
1 cent under Saturday.
None of the principals on the Leiter
crisis were willing to discuss the causes
which led to his abdication, and the
most plausible explanation that can be
offered at this time is, therefore, cir
cumstantial and speculative. The ffrst
indication of approaching dissolution
in the Leiter regime came this morn-
Ing, when the announcement was made
that all his cash and June wheat had
been transferred by Allen, Greer & Sel
lar, Leiter's brokers, to Philip D. Ar
mour and that the September option, of
which Leiter '.vat a heavy holder, had
been transferred to Lamsun Bros.
These reported transactions gave rist
to conjectures that soon developed into
a panic. At the outset it was rumored
that Leiter waa trying to get out of the
market, but the fact that Allen, Grier
& Sellar had transferred their trades to
Lamsun Bros, instead of selling out di
rectly, aroused the suspicion that Lei
ter was hard pressed and was endeav
oring to dispose of hia immense hold
ings without disclosing the causes of
his sudden withdrawal from the pit.
After the close of business Saturday I
millions of bushels of September wheat j
"puts" were sold in the vicinity of 71Vfec,
Lamson Bros, apparently having large
orders for this line.
Shortly before the opening of the I
Board of Trade to-day brokers, sup- j
posed to be acting for Leiter, were !
ready sellers. The "put" price was :
speedily reached ar.d Leiter, if the i
Lamsons arc acting for him, was en
abled to dispose of millions of wheat i
on the sale of "puts," whereas if the
actual wheat had been sold in the mar
ket there would have been even more
of a break. Had Allen, Grier & Sellar
made the sales, the street would have
suspected a ruse, but coming from
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 14, 1898.
Lamson Bros., there was no such indi
cation as to the identity of the seller.
It is estimated that during the day
from eight million to ten million bush
els of Leiter wheat, optional and visi
ble were sold to the account of the
"young Napoleon."
This is supposed to have consisted
chielly of options in September, July
and June wheat, stored in Minneapolis,
St. Paul, Duluth ami Cli*<*ago. It was
stated on the floor that the bankers of
the Northwest, who bavi oeen carrying
the Northwestern bull clique; refused
to carry their burden for a longer time,
and that calls had been made by North
western dealers, particularly the Min
neapolis interests, for margins down to
90 cents. These, it is said, were fol
lowed by calls upon Leiter here to mar
gin his wheat holdings denvn to SO cents.
Mr. Leiter had about 4,0'j0,000 bushels of
cash wheat on hand, much of which he
is said to have disposed of at a loss.
Later it was reported that L. Z. Leiter,
when asked by his'son for more money,
had refused to be drawn further into
the wheat deal and thus compelled the
latter to let go a large line uf his hold-
ings in order to satisfy his warehouse
creditors and marginal demands.
Representatives of the Northwestern
interests appear to have precipitated
the crisis by coming to Chicago Satur
day and learning that L. Z. Leiter
would not advance any more money on
his son's account.
Mr. Letter's friendl Insist that he has
not made an assignment, but It is ad
mitted to-night that the Leiter inter
ests has been "trusteed."
Joseph Leiter could not be located to
night. L. Z. Leiter was seen, but posi
tively declined to say a word.
Joseph Loiter entered the market
April Â£0, 1897, and Immediately after
ward, the pressure of a tremendous
power was felt, but no man knew
whose was the hand. Leiter's first or
der was negotiated by Broker George
B. French. It was for 100,000 bushels of
May wheat at 70% cents per bushel
Then orders came thick and fast. The
cheapest wheat bought by Leiter was
500,000 bushels, bought June 18, 1897 for
September delivery, at 64% cents.
The deal ran fourteen months, during
which time the price of wheat was
down to 64% cents in June, 1897, and up
to $1 So in May, 1898. It involved at
one time an interest of more than 35 -
000,000 bushels of wheat.
The Illinois Trust ' and Savings
Bank probably will be selected as trus
tee for the Leiter grain and will place
one or two broker representatives in
the market. Accurate figures as to Mr
Leiter's holdings when he decided to li
quidate are difficult to secure. The best
estimates Indicate that he had 12,000 000
bushels of wheat in Duluth and Min'nÂ«Â»
apolis, 2,000.000 bushels en route to
Europe and 2,000,000 bushels in or en
route to New York. Mr. Leitor W \U not
make an assignment and court proceed
ings for the settlement of his grain ac
count will not be necessary.
John J. Mitchell, president of the 1111
nois Trust and Saving Bank, said to
night: "Mr. Leiter has not failed and
will not fail. No assignment in the set
tlement of his affairs will be necessary
L. Z. Leiter having been acquainted
with the status of Joseph Leiter on the
wh^at market, detrmined that the deal
should stop now, co steps for a settle
ment were taken immediately.
"The banks are well protected find
there will not be a dollar lost. I know
that no bank lent money on this wheat
at over 80 cents on the bushel. Most
of {he Chicago banks were lenders,
also those In Minneapolis and Duluth
and some in New York.
"The question of selecting: a trustee
has not been decided. It may be found
that a trustee is not necessary. Prob
ably one or two brokers will be chosen
to represent the interests of the cred
itors in the market. But these matters
of detail will not be settled before the
end of this week. The wheat to be dis
posed of will not be handled so as to
produce uncertain market conditions.
The banks can afford to hold it if neces
sary, and there is nothing in the entire
transaction to occasion alarm."

MINNEAPOLIS, June 13.â The big
break in wheat to-day caused much ex
citement on 'Change and among the
grain men. Leiter's failure to carry
the load which he attempted to handle
may have been expected by some, but
to the great majority it was a surprise.
The statement that Northwestern
banks would, be affected by the action
of Leiter is not true, at least to any
appreciable degree.
C. A. Pillsbury, asked In regard to
his opinion of the break, its causes and
results, said:
"The cause of the break In wheat to
day was that Mr. Leiter attempted to
carry too heavy a load and put the price
of wheat too high. If lie had never at
tempted to put the price above $1 40
he would probably have won out great
money, as it was legitimately worth
that, but when the market did not
come up to his expectations he kept in
creasing his load, and I understand
there was nearly 7,000,000 bushels sold
in Chicago to-day on his account. Of
course, offerings of such, an enormous
quantity of wheat on the market at
one time depressed prices, and it is
strange to me that it has not depressed
then more. And while this is being
sacrifi.d on the market prices will be
temporarily as much lower than they
legitimately should be as they have
been higher than they legitimately
should have been. Wheat is worth le
gitimately 25 rents more than It closed
at to-day, and in my opinion will be
selling at about that much when the
liquidation owing to the scare is over.
In a few days the mills will be as eager
for wheat at a dollar a bushel and up
ward as they have been apathetic con
cerning it at $1 40 and upward."
President Chamberlain of the Se
curity National Bank said the banks of
the Northwest were nut put to any in
convenience on account of Mr. Leiter,
as he has no dealings with them. The
most persistent rumors connected
Messrs. Pillsbury and Peavy of this
city with the deal. The latter gentle
man, however, claimed to be totally
ignorant of the cause of the break.
Mr. Leiter has some wheat in Minne
apolis and Duluth elevators, which is
the only interest the two have in com
mon. Leiter is said to own moat of the
contract wheat â  in Minneapolis and
Duluth in public stocks, and the
Leiter cash interests will be a feature
in cash trading for some time to come.
It is true also that Minneapolis will be
drawn upon for export wheat from now
on, or till the decline is checked.
LEITER'S DOW.JFALL
LONG PRhDICTED
San Francisco Shorts Who Cleared
Up Big Money on the
Break.
The all-absorbing topic on 'Change
yesterday was Joe Leiter's Waterloo.
Many had foreseen this result over
eight months ago. Nevertheless this
same young man caused tropical plants
to thrive in the gardens of the" profes
sional bears, r. That the end would be
disastrous nohf^e at- all familiar with
grain specular/on denied, but when was
the end to come? Certainly not until
after he had driven July so high that
the shorts would require a stepladder
to reach it. As is always the case the
unexpected happens. However, Leiter
must be given due credit for the good
his pluck has done. Had it not been
for him wheat never would have
reached the high figures it did. He
forced foreigners to pay dearly for their
supplies. This brought to American
wheat producers many dollars that
would never have been theirs without
Leiter. His manipulation of the deal
has never been equaled, his great fault
undoubtedly resting in his over confi
dence that the growing crops would not
be as large as the trade generally an
ticipated. Weather ; conditions were
against him this season as strongly as
they were favorable to him last year.
The announcement* on 'Change that
Leiter had assigned caused a momen
tary flurry, December wheat breaking
to $1 31&. The effect was of short
duration. Many shorts took advantage
of the depression and filled outstanding
contracts.
Harry Wise bulled the price from
Jl 31^2 to $1 34 covering shorts. He has
been the Letter of the local market, but
not like Leiter. He sold out his long
contracts around $1 70 for December
and sold short a very heavy line. Those
contracts ho closed up yesterday through
Cutter & Moseley. It is undoubtedly
a fact that he cleaned up $7G,UUO on the
down turn. E. A. Bresse is crediteJ
with making $20,000 during the past ten
days shorting wheat. The trade ap a
whole is very much pleased that Leiter
has dropped out of the market, and
hereafter speculation will be free from
manipulation. Wheat has had a very
heavy break. It is more than likely .1
fair-sized rally is not far off. Armour
is credited with taking all of Letter's
spot wheat. Hl- does not generally buy
if his purchases have a sinking ten
dency. At all events prices are low
enough, conditions fully considered.
STORY OF MANILA'S FALL
DUE TO A MISTAKE
Frank Admission of the New York
Herald That Its Correspondent
Was in Error.
NEW YORK, June 13.â Under the
caption "A Mistake About Manila," the
Herald to-morrow will say: The Her
ald printed yesterday a dispatch from
its Washington correspondent stating
that Embassador Hay had sent to the
State Department information from a
British source that Manila had fallen.
It is with regret and no little embar
rassment that the Herald is obliged to
deny the accuracy of the story. It was
received by the Washington corre
spondent at an hc-ur too late to attempt
the usual official verification. It came
from a source usually trustworthy and
reliable.
The Herald would not knowingly
print an untruth, and, having been led
into error, makes the correction as
speedily as possible.
Germany's Alleged Designs.
LONDON, June 13.â The Singapore
correspondent of the Times says: "Let

Captain-General Augusti were exciting

SEATTLE, June 13.â Several thousand
interested spectators crowded Yesler
wharf this morning to witness the depart
ure of the steamship Roanoke. The ves
sel steamed out of port shortly after noon
with 225 passengers ;iru i heavily laden
with freight for Dawsan. The Roanoke
is operated by the North American Trad
ing and Transportation Company. It is
expected to reach St. Michael within ten
days.
Unusual importance It attached to this
initial trip, as it is expected the Roanoke
will be the first steamship to bring down
returning Klondikers and their millions in
gold. In July last the Excelsior, followed
two days later by the Portland, was the
treasure ship that first Impressed the
world with the wealth of the Yukon gold
fields.
The steamer Weare wintered at Circle
City and in all probability is now at Daw
son taking aboard miners with their bags
of dust. It will follow the breaking ice
down the Yukon and be the first boat Into
St. Michael, arriving about June 25. There
a transfer will be made to the Roanoke
and the return run made to Seattle, the
vessel reaching here between July 8
and 10.
The passengers on the north-bound
Roanoke come from every section of the
country and include a number of women
whose husbnnds or fathers are located
along the Yukon. Two notables are J. C.
McCook, recently appointed T'nited States
Consul to Dawson, and Acting Vice-Con
sul W. H. Rurke. Captain J. C. Barr,
who has charge of all the company's
river tni-ami^iips. is aboard.
Among the other passengers are H. G.
Steel and Charles P. Burnett, special cor
respondents for The Call. The latter will
remain in St. Michael during the summer,
while Mr. Steel will return on the tl
arc ship Roanoke. It is designed to ob
tain from the first gold seekers -to come
down the river complete details of their
winters experiences in the gold fields.
The story of the spring clfan-up will be

TACOMA, June 13.â Unheralded and
accompanied by his wife only, ex-Sec
retary of State John Sherman of Ohio
arrived in Tacoma to-day, and it was
not until his name was seen on the ho
tel register that any one knew of the
illustrious visitor's coming. Seated in
an easy chair in his parlor this even
ing, the well-known Ohioan appeared
strong and well. His generally vigorous
appearance indicates that he is still
sturdy ami full of energy. Mr. Sherman
explained that his jaunt to the coast
was one of pleasure only; that after a
rest of a few days he intended to sail
for Alaska, "just for the trip," and his
entire time would be spent in enjoying
freedom from work.
"I am out of the harness," said the
Ohio diplc-mat, "wholly free from offi
cial cares and intend only upon enjoy
ing my outing.
"Yes, large sums are necessary in
time of war," he replied when ques
tioned about the forthcoming bond is
sue. "Money must be available when
needed, and In sufficient quantities."
This was as near as the visitor came
to making any comment upon the ad
ministration policy.
"Dewey won a grand victory," said
ex-Secretary Sherman, when the Phil
ippines were spoken of, "but it is unfor
tunate that our poslstion Is such as
now exists. Occupancy or, more prop
erly, permanent acquisition of these isl
ands â in fact of any Spanish territory â
is in conflict with the very theory and
past policy of our nation. The declara
tion of war of itself indicated that we
are not to be looked upon as waging a
war of conquest."
The Senator Incidentally mentioned
the Hawaiian Islands, and made no se
cret of his opposition to the whole
scheme of annexation. Said he:
"A coaling station is needed in the
Pacific. I appreciate this, but after
providing this in the Hawaiian Islands
we have pone as far as we should go
along this course."

NEW YORK, June 13.â Tommy Ryan of
Syracuse met and easily defeated Tommy
West of this city to-night In the four
teenth round of a twenty-round contest
for the welter-weight championship of
the world. Ryan outfought his man at
every point and might have ended the
contest much quicker hnd he cared to.
West was game to the core and took an
awful hammering. Ryan's backers laid
odds on their man and took all the New
York money in sight. The referee,
Charley White, let the bout go as far as
humanity would permit, and when at last
he sent the men to their corner! and
awarded the fitiht to Ryan th< re was gen
eral satisfaction among 1 1 iâ¢ - .-ji. .tutors.
Ryan looked exceedingly tit and well
and said he weighed 147 pounds. West
was also in splendid shape and weighed
132 pounds.
The men got to work immediately and
there was fast fighting for four rounds.
when Kyan sent the blood flying from
West's nose. They kept up the pace un
til the eighth without material damage
to either man. In the eighth Ryan let
drive with hia right and landed on the
solar plexus. After a clinch West jabbed
the left on the fare and put Ryan down
upon his hack. When they came to the
center of the ring agsUn Weft sent Ryan
down again with a right swing on the
jaw. Ryan sot up quickly, and after s
little sparring, swung his rlirhi on Wwt'l
head, driving West through the ropes.
\\ est was up in two seconds.
Round 9 was easy, but in the tenth
Ryan soaked his right over the heart and
West wineod. West came up wobbly in
the eleventh, and Ryan kept jabbing" hj*
sore nose. Ryan got in blow after blow
from then on, and West was smeared
with blond. West came up gnmely in the
fourteenth round, but was unable to pro
tect himself, as Ryan landed at will, tab
bing him on the stomach and face, wast
to.ik his punishment in the gamest man
ner Imaginable Ryan let up a little and
looked at the referee, as much as to say:
"Why don't you stop it. Charley?"
White did not Interfere, and then Ryan
smashed West a couple of times, send
ing him to the ropes. Referee White
then went between thorn and stopped the
bout, after many of the spectators had
called on him to do so. White awarded
the bout to Ryan, and the latter walked
out of the ring without a mark on him.

Official Story of the Great
Victory at Manila Sent
by Mail.
Among* Those Whose Bravery Is
Praised by the Admiral Is
Correspondent Stickney.
WASHINGTON, June 13.â The Nary Department to-day made public the
following letter received from Admiral Dewey, this being its first mail advices
from him since he reached Manila:
"FLAGSHIP OLYMPIA, CAVITE, May 4. 1898.â The squadron left Mir3
Bay on April 27, arrived off Bolinao on the morning of April 30, and, finding no
vessels there, proceeded down the coast and arrived off the entrance to Manila
Bay on the same afternoon. The Boston and Concord were sent to reconnoiter.
* * * A thorough search of the port was made by the Boston and the Con
cord, but the Spanish fleet was not found. * * * Entered south channel at
10:30 p. m., steaming in column at eight knots. After half the squadron had
passed a battery on the south side of the channel it opened fire, none of the shots
taking effect.
"The Boston and McCulloch returned fire. The squadron proceeded across
the bay at slow speed and arrived off Manila at daybreak, and was fired upon at
5:15 by three batteries at Manila and two near Cavite and by the Spanish fleet
anchored in an approximately east and west line across the mouth of Bakor Bay,
with their left in shoal water in Canacac Bay. The squadron then proceeded to
the attack, the flagship Olympia, under my personal direction, leading, followed
at a distance by the Baltimore, Raleigh, Petrel, Concord and Boston, in the order
named, which formation was maintained throughout the action. The squadron
opened fire at 5:41 a. m.
"While advancing to the attack two mines were exploded ahead of the flag
ship, too far away to be effective. The squadron maintained a continuous and
precise fire at ranges varying from 5000 to 2000 yards, countermarching in a line
approximately parallel to that of the Spanish fleet. The enemy's fire was vigor
ous, but generally ineffective. Early in the engagement two launches put out
toward the Olympia with the apparent intention of using torpedoes. One was
sunk and the other disabled by our lire and beached before an opportunity oc
curred to lire torpedoes.
"At 7 a. m. the Spanish flagship Reina Christina made a desperate attempt
to leave the line and come out to engage at short range, but was received with
such a galling fire, the entire battery of the Olympia being concentrated upon her,
that she was barely able to return to the shelter of the point. The fires started
in her by our shells at this time were not extinguished until she sank.
"The three batteries at Manila had kept up a continuous report from the be
ginning of the engagement, which fire was not returned by the squadron. The
tirst of these batteries was situated on the South Mole Head, at the entrance to
the Pasig River; the second, the south bastion of the walied city of Manila; and
the third at Malate, about half a mile further south.
"At" this point I sent a message to the Governor-General to the effect that
if the batteries did not cease firing the city would be shelled. This had the effect
of silencing them. At 7:^o a. m. I ceased firing and withdrew the squadron for
breakfa>t.
"At 11:15 a. m. I returned to the attack. By this time the Spanish flagship
and almost the entire Spanish fleet were on fire. At 12:30 p. m. the squadron
1 firing, the batteries being silenced and the ships being sunk, burned and
i. At 12:45 P- m- the squadron returned and anchored off Manila, the
Petrel being left behind to complete the destruction of the smaller guns which
were behind the point of Cavite. This duty was performed by Commander E. P.
Wood in the most expeditious and complete manner. The Spanish lost the fol
lowing vessels:
"Sunk â Reina Christina, Castilla, Don Antonio de Ulloa,
"Burned â Don Juan de Austria, Isla de Luzon, Isla de Cuba, General Lezo,
Marquis del Duero, El Correo, Valesco and Isla de Mindano (transport).
'"Captured â Rapido and Hercules (tugs) and several small launches.
"I am unable to obtain complete accounts of the enemy's killed and wounded,
but believe their losses to be very heavy. The Reina Christina alone had 150
killed, including the captain, and ninety wounded. I am happy to report that
the 'Jjmage done to the squadron under my command was inconsiderable. There
wÂ«i* none killed and only seven men in the squadron very slightly wounded.
Sc/eral of the vessels were struck and even penetrated, but the damage wasof the
slightest, and the squadron is in as good condition now as before the battle.
"I beg to state to the department that I doubt if any commander-in-chief
was ever served by more loyal, efficient and gallant captains than those of the
squadron now under my command. Captain Frank Wilder, commanding the
Boston, volunteered to remain in command of his vessel, although his relief ar
rived before leaving Hongkong. Assistant Surgeon Kindleberger of the Olympia
and Gunner Evans of the Boston also volunteered to remain after orders detach
ing them had arrived. The conduct of my own personal staff was excellent.
Commander B. P. Lamberton, chief of staff, was a volunteer for that position,
and gave me the most efficient aid. Lieutenant Brumby, flag lieutenant, and
Ensign W. P. Scott, aid, performed their duties as signal officers in a highly
creditable manner. The Olympia, being short of officers for the batteries. Ensign
H. H. CaldweH, flag secretary, volunteered for us and was assigned to a sub
division of the five-inch battery.
"Mr. J. L. Stickney. formerly an officer in the United States navy and now
correspondent for the New York Herald, volunteered for duty as my aid and
rendered valuable service.
"I desire specially to mention the coolness of Lieutenant C. G. Calkins, the
navigator of the Olympia, who came under my personal observation, being on the
bridge with me throughout the entire action and giving the ranges to the guns
with an accuracy that was proved by the excellency of the firing. On May 2, the
day following the engagement, the squadron again went to Cavite, where it re
mained. * * *
"On the 3d the military forces evacuated Cavite arsenal, which was taken
possession of by a landing party. On the same day the Raleigh and Baltimore
.secured the surrender of the batteries on Corregidor Island, paroling the garrison
and destroying the guns. On the morning of May 4 the transport Manila which
had been aground in Bakor Bay, was towed off and made a prize."

WATER FIGHT'S NEW PHASE
CITY COUNCIL TO MEET THE
MONOPOLY.
Failing to Fix Upon a Suitable
Price, They Will Next At
tempt to Decide by
Arbitration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 13.â The City
Water Company to-day sent a commu
nication to the City Council giving a
complete inventory of its property. The
communication was addressed to City
Attorney Dunn. The company ex
plained that it did not expect the muni
cipality to take over all property. in
cluded in the inventory, as it did not
consider that it came within the pro
visions of the contract under the term
of improvements. For Instance, the
corporation declared it did not expect
the city to purchase any of the prop
erty owned by the Crystal Springs
Land and Water Company, which is
auxiliary to the City Water Company.
In explaining why the company had
none of the original plant of the city
turned over to it thirty years ago, the
communication states that time and in
creased service have demanded that the
old plant be entirely taken out and later
inventions and improvements substi
tuted.
The communication was not dis
cussed, but was referred to a joint meet
ing of the stockholders of the water
company and the City Council, to be
held to-morrow in the Council chamber.
The object of this meeting is to ascer
tain if the Council and the water com
pany cannot come together on an
agreed price for the plant. There is not
the slightest possibilty of this being
effected. But the conference must be
held under the terms of the water com
pany's contract with the city, which
United States District Judge Olin Wel
born has held to be legal and binding
in every particular.
Mayor M. P. Snyder has not been in
vited to participate in this joint meet
ing, but he will be there, and, unless
ejected, will, if occasion demands, offer
suggestions and talk upon the subject
under discussion. If the Council and
the company fail to agree, which is
practically certain, the next step under
the contract is to leave the matter to
arbitrators to determine. This is what
the water company will demand. It
also will demand that the result;; of the
arbitration be binding on both parties.
Just how this can be done cannot now
be foreseen. Before it can be made
binding city bonds must be verted. If
the voters deem the price agreed upon
by the arbitrators too high they will
defeat arbitration by defeating the
bonds. Then the whole matter will be
left in a worse complication than be
fore.
Despite the fact that it is generally
believed the consultation to-morrow will
not result in any agreement, citizens
are manifesting great interest in the
outcome. The Council chamber will be
crowded during the sessfons. President
Herman Silver of the City Council will
preside. The water company directors
claim that in holding this session and
entering into it prior to the expiration
of their lease they are making a con
cession to the city and doing something
they are not legally required to do.

REFORMS FOR
THE ISLANDS
New Philippines Tariff
Being Arranged.
PREPARATIONS PROCEEDING
BUT CHIEF AGUINALDO MAY
MAKE SOME TROUBLE.
Leader of the Insurgents Is Expected
to Demand That the Natives
Be Given Their Inde
pendence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlpprs House.
Washington, June 13.
Colonel J. F. Evans of San Francisco
is in daily conference with Secretary
Gage concerning the Philippine tariff.
The account published exclusively in
The Call last week on the preparations
the administration has been making
for the Government was accurate in
every way. These preparations have
gone far and are now reaching the de
tails of a tax-reform administration.
There will be such a reconstruction of
methods and such a lightening of bur
dens that with the strong and progres
sive and yet lenient rule of Amerfca
the inhabitants will be far freer than
Spanish subjects ever were under the
most favorable circumstances. Even
they will be far better off for a long
time than iÂ£ they were Independent,
providing that they have any desire to
become independent.
President McKinley and his advisers
in the Cabinet and in Congress, it is
said, have come to no formal and final
determination as to the disposition of
the islands. It is said by friends of the
President, however, that he believes the
islands will become the property of the
United States and that they will be
kept.
The War Department's reason for dis
patching a big force of soldiers to the
island is now apparent. There is a
possibility that Aguinaldo after show
ing his strength, may not desire to lay
down his arms peaceably and surrender
to the American commander. Agui
naldo has not in any of his utterances
that have been recorded on this side of
the world suggested that he desired to
surrender these rights to the American
< ;<>\t j rnment and raise the American
flag over the islands. He has talked of
a protectorate of the United States and
an independent government under it.
In such a plan the United States would
undertake to defend him from all for
eign aggression, but would secure no
benefit except coaling rights, perhaps,
and probably a large part of the trade
of the islands.
This is not the plan of the United
States. The Philippines must become
the property of this Government abso
lutely, both for their own good and for
that of the United States. America is
now determined that a commonwealth
on the American plan is to be raised in
the Pacific, with American civilization
and American progresstveness. Any
thing less will be rejected by the ad
ministration and by the people.
Tt is just at this point that the ad
ministration fears trouble, it is be
lieved that the Philippine insurgents
may consider their position identical
with that of the Cubans. The United
States has waged this war professedly
to free the Cubans. Aguinaldo may say
when the terms of peace are being de
cided or even before that his men are
fighting for independence too and that
the United States has helped them in
the same way and should not expect to
take the islands away from them any
more than to annex Cuba.

HAWAII WILL
NOT BE SEIZED
But Ultra An nexationists
Are Persistent.
AIDED TO SPREAD THE LIE
THE WASHINGTON EVENING
STAR DULY SUBSIDIZED.
While the Newlands Resolution. Is
Being Argued in Congress a
Speculator Is Doing
Fine Work.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, June 13.
To-night's Star and other ultra an
nexatlonista are persistent in declara
tions that President McKlnley will
seize Hawaii as a military necessity in
case Congress fails to pass the resolu
tion for annexation. This lie has been
exposed time and again. The Call cor
respondent can state on the authority
of a Senator who favors annexation
that the President does not now and
has never entertained a thought of op
posing the will of Congress. He re
alizes that it would be revolutionary
for the executive to usurp this legisla
tive function. Neither do these East-
em newspapers believe that he will do
such a thing. If they felt assured that
President McKinley would arbitrarily
seize the islands as a war measure, de
spite the action of Congress, they
would not be so anxious concerning the
fate of the resolution. Their anxiety
and hard fighting gives the lie to their
statements of the President's policy.
The Evening Star of Washington is
the chief annexation organ. Its editors
have become rich by gas and street
railway stock speculations. The Star
has in the past been facetiously termed
the "Evening Trolley." I asked a well
known newspaper editor of Washington
to-night if he could explain the Star's
overzealous support of annexation, and
he replied: "I understand that one of
it's editors is related by marriage to
President Dole, and secondly, it is gen
erally believed here that at least one
of its editors is a holder of Hawaiian
sugar bonds. A stockholder in the Ha
waiian Sugar Company, who lost
heavily in the recent slump in that
company's stock, has been in Washing
ton all winter and spring urging an
nexation. It is he who has furnished
the Evening Star with ammunition to
fire at those who oppose annexation."
The Hawaiian resolution will un- I
doubtedly pass the House on Wednes
day, and it is expected debate will be
gin in the Senate on Thursday. How
long it will continue no one can tell.
There at least a dozen Senators who are
anxious to speak at length and the
question is will Senators who are anx
ious to avoid the hot weather be willing
to remain? Senator White leaves on
Sunday for Los Angeles, whither he
will accompany hip wife and children,
but he will return immediately via San
Francisco.
ARGUED IN THE HOUSE.
WASHINGTON, June 13.â Newlands
(Silverite) of Nevada to-day addressed
the House in advocacy of annexation.
The pending resolutions were intro
duced by him. He was interrupted by
Cannon (R.) from Illinois, who pre
sented and asked unanimous consent
for the passage of an emergency bill to
appropriate $417,151, now carried by the
sundry civil bill, to pay the Bering Sea
award, but Bland (D.) of Missouri ob
jected. Cannon said the time for pay
ment would expire on Friday and the
sundry civil bill would not pass before
that day.
Newlands spoke at length in favor of
Hawaiian annexation as essential to our
commercial growth and necessary to the
protection of our Pacific Coast. The Phil
ippine and Hawaiian Questions, he de
clared, were entirely distinct. He was op
posed to the former as involving a policy
of 'territorial expansion, while the latter
was purely one of territorial defense and
commercial expansion.
Bell of Colorado followed, opposing the
resolutions. He attacked the existing re
public as being an oligarchy and the offer
of the islands for annexation as being
made by a few in utter disregard of the
wishes of the vast majority of the people
who reside in the islands. He contended
for the right of all people to be governed
in accordance with their will. Continu
ing, Bell argued that the population was
undesirable and that the location of the
islands in the tropical climate made it
unlikely that a people resident there
would ever be desirable as a component of
American citizenship. The conduct of
American missionaries and others who
had gone to Hawaii was attacked as hav
ing resulted in a successful conspiracy to
deprive the natives of their property and
self-government. The existence of leprosy
in the islands was commented upon as a
drawback to annexation. Bell concluded
by saying the annexation of Hawaii
would be accepted by the world as a vir
tual abandonment of the Monroe doctrine,
because It would be a reaching out and an
establishment of American institutions
beyond the boundaries within which the
Monroe doctrine originally spoiled and
that the latter could not occur without re
ciprocal rights being conceded to Euro
pean powers.
Pearson (R.) of North Carolina advo
cated annexation.
Henry (R.) of Indiana spoke for the
resolutions on the ground of strategic val
ue. Illustrating this value, he declared
that Dewey, after his great victory at
Manila, would be helpless and beyond the
possibility of aid from home were' the Ha
waiian islands controlled by hostile
hands.
Bland (D.> of Missouri followed in op
position, directing his remarks to a plea
for delay in disposing of the Hawaiian
question until after tne conclusion of the
war. He protested against urging annex
ation as a necessary war measure and
begged the House to pause in what seem
ed and what promised to be a mad
course of wild legislation under pretense
of it being essential to the proper con
duct of the war. The very fact, he said,
that the Government was sending out
expeditions and withdrawing all ships
from the California coast showod how ab
solutely secure was that coast and how
unnecessary was the present emergency
upon the part of the friends of annexa
tion.
In brief speeches Barrows (R.l of Mass
achusetts and Stewart (R.) of New Jersey
spoke for the resolutions and Smith (D.)
of Arizona in opposition.
Kirkpatrlck (R.) of Pennsylvania ar
gued in support of the power of Congress
to annex the islands. Mann (R.) of Ill
inois spoke for the resolution.
At the conclusion of Mann's speech,
upon request of Cannon, the House
passed the emergency bill appropriating
$473,151 to pay the Bering Sea award,
which will be due June 17.
At 5:18 o'clock the House adjourned.
Canvass of the Senate.
â WASHINGTON, June 13. â Senators
Lodge and Elklns made a partial canvass
of tho Senate on the Hawaiian question
to-day, and they say they are satisfied
that a sufficient number of advocates of
annexation will be in Washington to make
a quorum of the Senate and to insure the
passage of the House resolution through
that body. They count upon prolonged
daily sessions until action is had. The
annexationists have received renewed
assurance of the earnest support of the
administration, and hope on this account
to control practically the solid support of
the Republican side of the chamber. They
count upon eight or ten votes from the
I Democrats.

PICTURESQUE
STAMPEDE TO
DAWSON CITY
Ten Thousand Gold-Seek
ers Camped at Bennett
and Linderman.
Sam Wall, Now Returning to the
Klondike, Tells of Tragedies
Along the Trails.
BY SAM W. WALL.
LAKE BENNETT, May 81.â Truly
the world has seen nothing eince the
Crusades so pi -turesque as this stam
pede into the north in search of gold.
Each season seems to develop a feature
that forms a more blood-stirring pict
ure than the preceding. When I came
out over the ice in March 1 met a pro
cession extending in single file along
the trail the whole length of Lakes Ben
nett and Linderman. A few of the
over-eager and energetic had alone
reached the lower lakes. Every man
was harnessed to a sled. Above every
sled was spread a sail. The sails were
made of all manner of things, from a
llannel shirt or a w. ite sheet of can
vas, through the scale of colored and
striped to the black rubber blanket.
With the wind blowing with them fill
ing their sails and driving a heavy fall
of snow, every man, instead of pulling,
exerted his strength to prevent running
over the sled in front. Occasionally a
sled got away and turning off the trail
went careening over the wide surface
of the lake until some obstacle over
turned it.
I thought this procession of sailing
sleds, extending as far as one could see
through the mist of snow in both di
rections, was the most remarkable
thing the stampede would see. But
there was still another more striking
just at hand. "When I left the lakes
and began to climb up through the de
file of the mountains that forms the
White Pass I still met this army, still
with its sails spread, filing down.
Horses, oxen, dogs and men were in
the line, struggling now through the
snow and over the rocks, here and there
a sled with its load overturned or fallen
Into some deep crevasse and lost. For
these the marching thousands had no
time, but moved on past and down, the
broken spaces being quickly closed and
the sails showing again continuously,
one above another, until, on the far
summit, they stood in relief against the
sky or were half obscured in the clouds.
The winter that then encompassed
everything is now confined to the
mountains. On the summit of Cbilkoot
Pass there are still unknown depths of
snow. At the scene of the great snow
slide it is probably forty feet deep. The
day before I passed over it the bodies
of two other victims were taken out and
it is more than probable still others
will be found there. Down below, at
Dyea and Skaguay on the one side and
at the lakes on the other, the snow has
gone and the ice on the lakes is break
ing and passing. The thousands who
in March were hurrying over the ice in
an effort to get as near the foot of the
lakes as possible or were climbing down
the west side of the mountains are now
camped on the shores of the lakes,
making ready to sro down just the mo
ment the ice releases the stream.
At the head of Lake Linderman is
Linderman, the town. Fully 5000 peo
ple are camped there. Seven miles
further down, beyond the little neck of
water that divides Linaerman from
Bennett, is the town of Bennett, where
6000 more are encamped. Between Lin
derman and Bennett and down the
whole length of the chain of lakes the
shores are fringed with Klondikers and
the whole region is one big boat yard.
Sawmills at both Linderman and Ben
nett and others at different points along
the shore fill the screaming air with
sawdust and turn logs into lumber at
25 cents a foot. All manner of boats
are under construction, from the little
dory designed for a man with a short
outfit, to the big barge upon which
horses and cattle with tons of hay and
other provisions are to be carried down
to DawÃon. The ice about the shores
of both Linderman and Bennett is
melted and, with the direction of the
wind, great floes move to this side arid
that. At one time there may be a wide
avenue of water on the Bennett side
that will invite the eager Klondiker to
launch his boat in the hope of getting
a milo or so further on his journey.
Tho wind shifts and slowly the wide
avenue closes, the great floe touches the
chore and all within the space is
crushed. Only yesterday a barge that
started on its way thus prematurely
was destroyed and much of the twenty
tons of provisions it contained was lost.
Rotten as the ice is and has been for
weeks still the more reckless and wit
less have ventured on It until within a
few days. Ferrymen have carried these
out from the shore to the ice and they
â¢would make their way over it as far
as possible. But so unsafe has the ice
become and so many fatalities have
occurred recently that it is no longer
trusted, and those who insist on travel
ing are taking to the side hills. This
is very rough goinÂ«? as there is no trail
and one must struggle over the rocks
and through the underbrush with only
"general directions" for a guide.
A number of deaths by drowning be
cause of venturing too far over the rot
ten ice are reported. These reports,
however, are very unreliable and place
the number much too high. For in
stance a story to the effect that seventy
persons had been drowned by the
crushing of boats in the ice gained wide
circulation along the lakes. I find that
there is no more truth to it than there
was to the story of the death of "Swift
water Bill." On leaving Bennett to
move further down Bill called back to
a friend "If anybody asks for me just
tell 'em I'm drowned." Out of that
grew the entertaining obituaries .of
"Swiftwater Bill."
That many have been drowned, how
ever. Is known. A man with a pack
on his back was seen by people of Lin
dorman to drop through the Ice a few
('ays ago shortly after being ferried out
."nd starting on a trip to Bennett. A
dog team and two of a party of four
went through at Caribou Crossing a
few days ago. The two drowned were
Dun Richards and Thomas Barnes. The
other two of the party were ahead of
the team and escaped. The sled was
heavily loaded and went through,
breaking the ice for such an area that
the men attending It went down. The
lead dog kept its footing on the ice for
some time afterward with the weight
of the sled and the other dogs hanging
to him, but he was finally dragged
down. The bodies of Richards and
Barnes were recovered and burled by
their friends with proper ceremony on
the Island in Lake Bennett.
Many deaths no doubt have occurred
similar to that referred to in Lake Lin
derman, no actual knowledge of which
may be had. A mile east of Bennett
and a hundred yards out from shore a
dog is lying beside a hole in the fast
thinning ice. He has boen there for
several days. No one may venture on
the ice to reach him and he refuses to
answer calls from the shore. Beside
another such hole in the ice in Lake
Linderman, plainly visible from shore
when the ice floe is in, lie a man's hat
and a stick.
The weather is beautiful. The sun
is as warm as it is at this season in
San Francisco. The mosquitoes are
here, busy and multiplying. Daylight
extends practically througn the twen
ty-four hours and work goes with it in
very many of the busy boat yards that
form almost the one industry of these
little cities on the lakes. Linderman
and Bennett are without doubt the
busiest towns of their size in the world
to-day. No idle individual lives within
their boundaries.
The town of Linderman, as it comes
into view from the hill top where the
trail leads over the divide from Long
Lake, looks like the cajnp of an army.
P.ennett is also little more than a city
of canvas, but no such view is had of
it. When the ice shall have passed out
leaving the way clear this big army
will fold its tents and the two cities
will sail and fade away. My notion 1b
that that day will present a spectacle
the equal of any of those that have pre
ceded it in this remarkable drama.
The Northwest mounted police are
taking many precautions as against-fa
talities and accidents that may be ex
pected to follow the movement of so
many men, not only not in concert and
without organization, but every man
competing with every other for pre
cedence. When they move there will
be a flotilla of about 4000 small boats on
the water, all headed in the same di
rection, all striving to reach their desti
nation, if not first at least as near the
front as possible.
To prevent a crush an order is out
from Â«he police headquarters limiting
the number of boats that shan leave
on any one day. This oraer may have
some effect, but how it may be en
forced it is difficult to see. Boats are
being inspected also and those that are
taking passengers are required to have
a certain seaworthiness. Canvas, sec
tional and other boats of doubtful
stamp are forbidden to take any but
their owners. Every boat is being
numbered by the police, its number in
black, six inches in length, being
painted on the nose of the craft and
the names of all those who go with it
registered. This is a precaution to
enable the authorities to follow the his
tory of boat and occupants after they
leave here.
The stampede is practically at a
standstill east and south of the moun
tain tops. Every vessel that comes
north brings a certain contingent of
men bound "in." but the number is
scarcely appreciable in this crowd. The
trails on the south or "outward" side
of the mountains have already become
muddy and full of trouble for packers,
and along the whole length of both the
Skaguay and Chilkoot trails is strewn
with dead horses and dogs, the traveler
being scarcely at any time out of the
sight and, most of all, out of the stench
of one or the other. At one place on
the Skaguay trail there are the bodies
of a dozen horses piled together. Many
of these were crippled and ..illed during
the winter, but for the most part they
make up the wrecks :e of last summer
and fall that have lain under the snow
all winter and are now uncovered by
the sun to the great distress of those
who have to pass this way.
The falling off in freight transporta
tion has relieved a great number ot
horses of their occupation and they are
roaming about Dyea and Skaguay pick-
Ing up a precarious living where they
can. Many of these will be taken down
the river to Dawson. Both Dyea and
bnaguay, however, are living in the full
hope of a return or resumption of the
stampede, deeming it almost certain. to
follow the arrival of the first treasure
ship at San Francisco. Almost all the
traffic is going over the Chilkoot trail â
that is by way of Dyeaâ as the Skag
uay trail is reported to be almost im
passable. Building is still going on in
the rival town of Skaguay, and her peo
ple are cheerful in the hope of the pro
posed railway.
Dyea has completed her dock and
wharf, by which deep water vessels
may now discharge direct there at any
Ftnpre of the tide, and the day of the
lighter is done. Freight is transported
in wagons from Dyea to the canyon
and from the canyon by means of the
Chilkoot Railroad and Transport
Company's wire trolley and by pack
mules to the summit. Even the Indians
no longer use their own shoulders for
this purpose. From the scales to the
summit there are no less than four dif
ferent wire lines. For, especially dur
ing the winter, while the snow made it
comparatively easy, very many hauled
their own goods on sleds as far as the
scales and entrusted them to the trolley
from there to the su mit.
The carriage of goods of every de
scription over this formidable moun
tain pass by means of overhead wires
in another of the odd and interesting
things developed by the great stam
pede. The Ohllkoot Railroad and Trans
port Company claims to be able to
carry 175 tons of freight from Canyon
City, at the very foot of the mountain,
to and over the summit in one day.
It can run through the twenty-four
hours if necessity requires. The method
is very simple. A fixed cable is sus
pended by means of towers. On this
buckets are suspended and travel by
means of wheels, grooved so as to fit
to and ride easily over the wire. Lower
down and nearer the bucket a clutch is
fixed that takes hold of a traveling
wire which carries the bucket along. It
is the principle of the cable car re
versed, having the wheels overhead
and traveling upon a suspended track
with the moving cable a little lower
down and immediately above the car.
The towers upon which the wire ropes
are suspended are placed about one
hundred yards apart on ordinarily
level gTound, but there is no attempt
to follow the undulations of the land.
The buckets ride from hill top to hili
top, there being one place where over
a mile of. rope is suspended from towers
THE SAN FHANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUKE 14, 1898.
on each side of a deep ravine. It seems
to be a very simple solution of the prob
lem of carrying freight over these
mountains. The Chilkoot company, as
it is called for short, is building a
tramway from Dyea to connect with
the end of the wire at Canyon City and
will extend its wire shortly to the
lakes on the west side of the mountain.
At present freight is still transported
by dog sleds over the snow on the west
side to the foot of Long Lake. A port
age of two miles has to be completed
there by pack horses. With this fre
quent change, wagons from Dyea to
Canyon City, wire from Canyon City
to the summit, dog sled down to Long
Lake and thence by pack animal to
Linderman, the rate of transportation
is but 7 cents a pound â late 48 cents.
With the disappearance of the snow
and ice on the west side pack animals
will have to be resorted to to the foot
of the mountains, where boats will take
the place of sleds through Round, Deep
and Long lakes to Linderman; or, as
an alternative, the old summer trail
will be followed.
In carrying the war edition of The
Call over the summit a train of twelve
buckets was employed for the papers
alone. In order to make time as well as
to make certain of the proper transport
of the packages I myself got into a
bucket immediately following the train
and so rode over the canyons and
mountain tops to the summit.
My party down the river will con
sist of two others, good rivermen, be
sides myself. Our boat is completed
and we will make the start immediately
upon the water way being opened. We
expect to make the run to Dawson, as
one of this big flotilla of little boats, in
ten days.

for pecuniary aid for the Cuban cause,
which he concludes as follows:
"If we have not money with which to
meet our obligations we expose our
selves to discredit and dishonor among
our brethren of the United States who
have Joined with us to nght for us, and
the impression which we would convey
would be an unfavorable one. That

beautiful example of abnegation, union
and discipline which the Cuban patriots
have given to all the world should ap
peal to the patriotism of every Cuban
in this and other countries. I trust that
they will all hearken to the call of duty
and continue to contribute their pe
cuniary aid to the cause of Cuban in
dependence and .liberty, each in propor
tion to his means and ability, that we
may complete our mission in good faith
and in good standing."

MONTEREY'S NAVAL
RESERVE DEFRAUDED
Manager of a Benefit Entertain
ment Departs With Box
Office Receipts.
MONTEREY, June 13.â William Lan
sing, a man announcing himself as a
retired actor, recently appeared in
Monterey, coming here for his health,
he said, and was engaged by some of
the younsr people to coach them for
amateur dramatics. The little company
made such rapid progress under him
that It offered to give a performance
for the benefit of the Monterey Naval
Reserve. The performance was a great
success financially, but Lansing, who
had charge of the box-office receipts,
was very slow in settling. When at
last he could delay settlement no longer
he decamped, carrying all the receipts
with him.
Besides the amount belonging to the
Naval Reserve, Lansing took a large
sum due the printers both here and in
Pacific Grove for advertising matter,
and J. W. Bagley, owner of the theater
in which the performance was given,
the costumera and others were left un
paid. Steps were at once taken for the
arrest of Lansing, but up to this time
he has not been found.

CROWD.

to Love.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
GREAT BEND, Kans., June 13.-In
the public square, fronting on the prin
cipal business street of this city, a
murderer was lynched at 8 o'clock this
evening by a mob of probably 500 per
sons. It Is estimated that at least 1000
of Great Bend's population of 2500 per
sons witnessed the tragedy. The vic
tim was John Becker, a white man, 50
years of age, who, on April 8, killed
Myrtle Huffmeister, the 16-year-old
daughter of William Huffmeister, a
farmer living midway between Great
Bend and Ellinwood.
Becker was employed by the farmer
and professed passionate love for the
daughter. The tragedy followed the
girl's refusal to accept his advances.
When the girl came to the stable in the
evening Becker shot her to death, send
ing eight bullets into her body, after
which he set fire to the farmer's
stables. At first it was reported the
murderer had shot himself and had died
in the flames, but later it became
known that he had fled and search was
instituted. On April 13 a posse of farm
ers captured the murderer near St.
John, Stafford County, and for safe
keeping he was taken by the Sheriff to
Hutchinson, there having been many
threats that he would be lynched if
brought here.
This morning Becker was brought
from Hutchinson to be put upon his
preliminary examination. Early in the
day farmers from the neighborhood of
his crime began coming into town and
by 6 o'clock this evening the streets
were thronged. Then, when it became
known the murderer had been granted
a change of venue to Lyons and that
Sheriff Abeer would take nis prisoner
east on the Santa Fe train this even
ing there were signs of threatened
trouble, as a big crowd began to gather
at the railroad depot. Sheriff Abeer,
appreciating the danger, took Becker
Into a buggy and started for a cross
ing east af the city, intending to flag
thetrain there. By this time the crowd
at the depot was openly threatening a
lynching.
When the train pulled in the purpose
of the Sheriff's strategy had become ap
parent to all. The would-be lynchers,
quick to act, boarded the train and
rode on. When the Sheriff at the cross
ing saw the train was crowded to the
guards he did not flag it, but hurriedly
drove back to Great Bend with his
prisoner. At Dartmouth the lynching
party left the train and started back
to this city, having hired all the con
veyances available there. Sheriff Abeer
had hurried back and lodged his pris
oner at the County Jail.
A few minutes before 8 o'clock the
mob was swarming round the jail. Evi
dently believing that he could outwit
the lynchers by flight, the Sheriff
rushed Becker out of the jail to his
buggy, but he had no sooner done so
than he and his men and the prisoner
were surrounded. The Sheriff, aided by
his deputies, made a stubborn defense,
and the prisoner, realizing the fate that
threatened him, fought desperately
with them. After they had fought their
way back almost to the entrance to the
Jail, the mob, through sheer force of
numbers, prevailed. Securing the mur
derer, it bore him away to the public
square.
A rope was drawn around Becker's
neck, and after he had been beaten al
most to insensibility the rope was
thrown over a limb of a big tree and he
was drawn up. Some one in the crowd
gave the body a push, and as the mur
derer was being drawn up, his body re
peatedly swung back, scraping upon the
trunk of the tree.
The Sheriff and his men kept close
upon the heels of the lynchers, but they
were hold back for fully fifteen min
utes, when, it being apparent Becker
was dead, the mob quickly melted away
and the murderer's body was cut down
by the Sheriff and the Coroner.
Though revolvers were drawn and
threats were made, no shots were fired
by the Sheriff and his men in their
struggle against the lynchrrs. Many of
j the lynching party must be known to
j the county peace officers, but to-night
there is no very strong talk of arrests.
The sentiment here seems to be that if
i ever a man deserved lynching Becker
I did.
Becker Is said to come of a prosper
ous family at Marlon, 111. Attorney W.
"W. Duncan was here from Marlon to
defend him, and it is stated that insan
ity was to have been the murderer's de
fense.

k Po^ e SS F?ancS ff Â° rola :. St r t -;TROOPS WILL EMBARK ON THE TRANSPORTS TO-DAY
The troops composing the sec
ond expedition to Manila will go
aboard the four transports that
are to convey them to the Philip
pines to-day. With the excep
tion of the First Nebraska Regi
ment all of the infantry troops at
Camp Merritt have been ordered
to break camp at 7 o'clock.
Colonel Bratt's command will
follow later in the day and move
about noon.
The troops that will leave
Camp Merritt to-day are: Tenth
Pennsylvania, under Colonel
Hawkins; First Colorado, under
nel Halo; First Nebraska,
under Colonel P.ratt; two bat
talions of regulars from the
Eighteenth and Twenty-third
Infantry, under Colonel Bailey; a
detachment of Engineers, under
Lieutenant Connor, and two bat
teries of Utah Light Artillery,
under Captain Young.
The reason of the early hour
set forthe departure of the troops
is that they may reach their
ships before the streets become
blocked with the day's com
merce.
General Otis stated that there was no
given line of march to be followed by
the troops, but that they would act as
separate detachments and act inde
pendently in marching to the wharves.
It is, however, probable that all of the
troops will go down Golden Gate
avenue to Market street and down
Market to the water front. Once
aboard the transports General Greene
will assume command. The vessels
will pull out from their wharves as soon
as the troops are aboard and anchor
in the stream to-night.
At 9 o'clock to-morrow morning Gen
eral Greene will report to General Mer
ritt for sailing orders and final instruc
tions, and it is safe to say that by noon
to-morrow the second expedition to
Manila will have passed through the
Golden Gate.
OTIS STILL COMMANDS.
How a Buffoon Chief of Police
Did Not Capture Ca^p
Merritt.
Green flre, fringed with red, white and
blue, shot from the eagle eye of Chief
Lees yesterday morning after reading
how one of his minions had been belted
over the head with a gun Sunday, be
cause he undertook to disarm a sentry
of the First Colorado Infantry. Things
had reached a pretty stage when a com
mon soldier could bowl out an obstreper
ous policeman without experiencing the
its of the City Prison. He would
see if Uncle Sam's guardians wÂ«r*
rior to the police force.
Long the Chief pondered over the mat
ter. Those soldiers must be taught to
bow to the mighty Chief, that was cer
tain. But how should he proceed to sub
jugate the army? First he would Bee what

galore.
That settled It. The General had the

re must be no quarter shown the
warrior. When his camp was invaded he
must surrender at once and uncondition
ally. Hut that would be easy: Lees would
resume his most terrifying frown, shoot
few glances from his hypnotic eye
and Otis would capitulate.
Summoning his first assistant bluffer,
Captain "Wlttman, the hero of many a
<weat-box battle, the Chief unfolded his
plan. Together they would go to the
general, and If their combined ferocity
Sid nnt fetch him, then he was different
from anybody they had practiced their
l.la^k art upon.
Sallying forth from the City Hall the
two hoarded a McAllister-street car and
an hour later were ushered into the
:^e of their victim. Lees was cold

Witt man was also coldâ at least his feet
wereâ and uncomfortable. General Otis

The ancient Chief began to get nervous
and began to hedge. To be sure he had

Inally, seeing that Wittman's condition

soldiers.
General Otis was pleased with the sug
gestion. While his men had absolute con

THE PRESIDIO CAMP.
riiird United States Artillery
Is BHng Rapidly Recruited
to Its Full Strength.
A board of officers for the examination
3l regular army officers entitled to promo
tion is in session at the Presidio.; The
Doard Is composed of Major Field, Cap
;ain Sedgwick Pratt. Lieutenant David J.
Rumbough, adjutant of the Third Artll
ory and recorder of the board, and Sur
jeons "White and Mosely. They are to ex
imine First Lieutenant Francis J. Ker
lan of the Twenty-first Infantry and
First Lieutenant W. 11. Sage of the
Twenty-third Infantry for promotion to
the rank of captain, and such other offi
cers as may come before them. The
rigidity of the mental examination, which
lometimes lasts two or three weeks, will
;e considerably abated on account of the
ark of time, but the physical examina
;ion â will be much stricter than in time of
>eace. However, Lieutenants Kernan and
â Sage will in all probability pass. A can-
Jldate for promotion who Is mentally
lualified but who cannot nil the physical
â¢equirements is retired on three-quarters
jay of the grade for which he is an appli
:ant.
The Third United States Artillery Is rili
ng up very rapidly. The recruits are turn-
Ming over each other in their rush to join
this fine regiment. An extra clem has
teen detailed to assist Lieutenant Aber
lathy, whose recruiting office Is la the.
Phelan building, in examining and enroll
ing the recruits. Yesterday morning there
were thirty waiting at one time to oe en
listed.
The Third Artillery men are congratu
lating their old commander, Colonel Mil
ler, now brigadier general, upon the fine
brigade that has been assignjd t) him.
It is compoGo.l entirely of regulars, wiih
the exception of two compar.leH A and D,
of the California Volunteers Heavy Artil

the usual number in a hrgads being not
over thief.
Troops L and M of the Fourth United
States Cavalry were in 1890 skeletonized
under Secretary Proctor's order. The
men were distributed among other troops
ot the regimrnt, while the officers were
ruta'red. They have now been fully re
organized by the transfer of fly; experi
enced men from each of the ten troops,
and the addition of ISO recruits, "..his
gives to each of the two troops twenty
five thoroughly trained pri/ates and non
commissioned * officers, and seventy-live
new men. They lave receive 1 their full
equipment, and expect their horses in a
few days, after which they will soon be
put in good fighting trim.
Companies G and C of thÂ« Sixth Cali
fornia Volunteers, in command of Lieu
tenant Colonel Johnson, have received or
ders to move to Benicia Arsenal. They
will go to-day. The remaining four com
panies, upon receiving their complete
equipment, will go to Fort Point.
Thirty men from HeaJdsburg yesterday
applied to Lieutenant Abernathy in tht

Third Artillery, and nearly all passed lhÂ«
required examination.
RED CROSS APPEAL.
A Call for Lunches â The Press
Club Art Show.
Mrs. John F. Merrill, president of the
locnl Red Crops Society, appeals once
more to the generous public. At 12
o'clock to-day 4300 volunteers will em
bark on the transports that will convey
them to scenes of peril. As a parting
sign of our hospitality, thp society Is de
sirous to give them a parting feast on
board ship before their departure. There
fore, It is earnestly requested that pa
triot I", people will send to the ferry food
of all kinds to help the ladies carry out
the noble plan.
At a late hour last evening cheering
news was received from the ladies in
charge of the art exhibition that has been
held in the rooms of the Press Club dur
ing the past two days. Over $600 had
been received by the sale of pictures to
a generous public, and more money was
pouring in. due to the irresistible appeals
of sweet-faced young ladies and eloquent
persuasive powers of Auctioneers Arthur
W. Spear Jr. and Samuel M. Shortridge.
Last night closed a beautiful and re
munerative exhibition. As was stated in
Sunday's Call, the crowd that filled the
charming club rooms was both fashion
able and critical and yesterday was a
repetition of the initial exhibition.
Through the efforts of a bevy of artists,
Mrs. N. Clark, Annabell Lee and Miss
Caro Cook the exhibition was made pos
sible, and to them is due the thanks of
the Red Cross Society and the fortunate
visitors who carried away artistic gems
at a low figure.
During the afternoon. Ezra Kendall and
Mr. Phillips of the Orpheum, Louis Mor
rison of the Alcazar, Mr. Meldon of Mor
osco's and Mr. Mack of tho Clay Clement
Company were present ready to respond
in behalf of those who had the affair in
charge.
Those fortunate enough to be present
were given a treat.
Another grand benefit is being arranged
in aid of the Red Cross Society. This
time it is by the Mechanics' Institute and
will be in the form of a splendid recep
tion to Minesota's pride, the First Regi
ment of Volunteers. Everything is being
done by the committee in charge to make
tne evening of Friday, June 17, a memor
able one in the annals of local history.
The big Pavilion will be handsomefy
decorated for the occasion with flags and
bunting and will wear a gala appearance.
The Sorosis Club has been generous in
Its donations to the cause. Every week
necessaries have been received, much to
the delight of the ladies in charge, at 16
Post street.
Mrs. Henrietta Zeile and Miss Henrietta
Zeile have kindly donated $20 and $10 re
spectively.
More postals are asked for by Miss
Burke to supply the Incoming troops.
Nothing has proved more acceptable to
the boys in blue than an opportunity to
apprise loved ones in the East of their
health and reception in this State.
The subscriptions received up to date
amount to $42,549 95.
WILL SAIL. TO-MORROW
Steamers With the Second Ma
nila Expedition Aboard to Go
Into the Stream To-Day.
The transport fleet, consisting: of the
China, Colon, Zealandia and Senator, was
all ready for the reception of the troops
last evening, and It Is the intention to
get all the men on board at an early hour
this morning, so that they can spend to
day in getting somewhat accustomed to
the ships and their quarters and to prop
erly stow their Immediate belongings.
The First Colorado Volunteers, the two
rtah batteries of light artillery and half
a battalion of the Eighteenth regular in
fantry go on the China; a portion of the
Eighteenth and Twenty-third regular In
fantry regiments on the Colon; the Tenth
Pennsylvania Volunteers on the Zea
landia, and the First Nebraska Volunteers
on the Senator.
Owing to the delay In making the
needed repairs to the boilers -of the Mor
gan City, that steamship will be held tor
the third expedition. This unexpected oc
currence throws out the Idaho Volunteers
until the sailing of the third fleet, about
ten days hence.
After all the troops are on board the
four transports will pull Into the stream
and remain there until they receive orders
from General Merritt to sail, which will
be some time between 1 a. m. and 1 p. m.
to-morrow.

THE NATIONAL GUARD.
Major General Dickinson Is
Endeavoring to Have It
Entirely Reorganized.
Major General Dickinson of the Cali
fornia National Guard is a general with
out an army, owing to tr.e fact that the
guard has been almost completely dis
organized by the enlistment of its mem
bers in the United States volunteer ser
vice. According to the recent opinion of
Attorney General Fitzgerald these
guardsmen have ceased to be members of
the National Guard, and in view of that
fact the Attorney General suggested that
to maintain the organization the volun
teers should be granted a leave of ab
sence by the Governor, thus following a
precedent established by several Eastern
States.
Major General Dickinson, who is aim
ing to rehabilitate the National Guard by
enlisting recruits to fill up the depleted
ranks or by reorganizing it entirely, held
a protracted if not somewhat heate. con
ference with Governor Budd yesterday
afternoon at the State militia headquar
ters. General Dickinson has obtained
from Judge Advocate Dwyer an opinion
that the Governor cannot grant a leave
of absence to the guardsmen who have
enlisted In the volunteer service. In that
event General Dickinson's scheme can be
worked.
The matter haa been taken under ad

Nashville 6:30 p. m. June 10 would arrive
in this city this evening:. .The Southern
Pacific Company has information that the
Tennea* c troops will not arrive until to
morrov The command, 1200 strong, left
St. Loui.* .ast Saturday. The train is run
ning in four sections. From the fact that
the First Tennessee has been assigned to
General King's Third Brigade it is in
ferred that the regiment will go to Camp
Merritt.
The army authorities In the Phelan
building have been advised that a troop
of Nevada cavalry is en rmire to this oity.
The Southern Pacific Company is in
formed that four carloads of Wyoming
troops left Ogden for this city yesterday
afternoon.
SHODDY CLOTHING.
Troops in Camp Merritt Annex
Have a Grievance.
Throughout all Camp Merritt is heard
loud condemnation of the clothing sup
plies just issued. The goods are of poor
est shoddy, without shape, and without
fit. The blouse that goes over a head for
the first time without a half dozen rips
and tears is the exception and not the
rule. Though the men are too manly to
kick, they think it far from just that they
be compelled to pay from their none too
generous clothing allowance full prices
for the stuff they axe compelled to take.
A branch of the commissary that the
Montanas, individually, have a grievance
against is the rations department. On
Sunday bacon was issued to them that
was unfit for food. As a result the per
centage of sickness in the Montana regi
ment has increased.
Brigadier General McArthur yesterday
afternoon paid an Informal visit to the.
officers of his brigade, the Fourth. To
morrow, or the next day at the latest,
he, with his staff, will have established
his headquarters to the lot next on the
west to the present camp of the First
North Dakntas. Though General McAr
thur has not yet caused official notifica
tion to issue, it is understood by the
officers of his new command that he has
assumed the responsibilities of his of
fice.
Since the final formation of the provi
sional brigades. Colonel Kessler has had
command of the Fourth pending the ad
vent of Brinsuller General McArthur. Col
onel Kessler was at a loss for a time to
quite understand his position; though. act-
Ing brigadier of the Fourth, his regiment
was part and parcel of the Third Brigade,,
and he its ranking officer.
The Fifty-first lowa Volunteers yester
day put in a solid afternoon with regt
mfntal and battalion drill and drill in the
manual of arms. The men have been
schooled in every exercise known to the
manual, and their drilling now Is on a
par with that of the troops of the regu
lar army.
Colonel Loper, of the Fifty-first lowa,
was much disappointed yesterday in re
ceiving news to the effect that the Forty
ninth lowa had been ordered to Major
General L^e's command for Cuba instead
of to California for the Philippines, as
they had all confidently hoped.
Colonel I^oper has detailed his lieutenant
colonel as instructor of the guard, to be
gin his duties at once.
The health of the lowa troops is above
the camp average, though a number of
thorn have succumbed to bad colds and
numerous petty complaints.
Private Fred Se.ney, Company I, First
South Dakota, is seriously ill from quinzy
and has been removed from camp to the
French Hospital.
The First Montana boys yesterday
morning repaired in a body to> the Sutro
baths where, as guests of the manage
ment, they put in two hours in the tepid
water of the tanks. On Sunday Private
Seaman won the inter-regimental swim
ming tournament, and now wears a hand
some silver medal in token of his prow
ess.

THE BACON WAS BAD.
Montana Men Made 111 by Eat-
ing Unwholesome
Food.
Company B, of the First Montana went
up against some over-ripe army bacon
yesterday morning with results disastrous
to themselves. The bacon was part of a
lot that had been in the commissary depot
for many seasons. It had been shipped
to New Orleans on the breaking out of
the war and brought back again when the
troops began to assemble here, so It was
well seasoned.
The company cook noticed when ho
sliced It up that It was almost too nimble
to stay in the frying pan, but he failed to
report It to the regimental commissary
and served It up for breakfaÃt.
All the members of Company B were
made sick, though they no more than
tasted the bacon, so sick that many of
them vomited. Soon after breakfast the
regiment was ordered to fall In for a
march to Sutro baths, but the men of
Company B rebelled. They said they were
too 111 to march, and Colonel Kessler was
sent for.
The colonel went to the company street
and ordered the men to fall In, which
they did. The officer said he had been
told the men had refused to obey orders,
and after warning them of the serious
ness of such an offense, asked that those
who refused to obey orders step to the
front.
Not a man moved, and the colonel ex
pressed his gratification that the men
from Butte were willing to submit to the
orders of their officers. 0nÂ« of the men
asked permission to address the colonel,
which was readily granted. He explained
that the men were Blok from eating un
wliolefitfiue bacon. They had. not beÂ«a
ablÂ© to retain their breakfast, and were
too weak to make the long march.
Colonel Kessler told his men that they
were always at liberty to make com
plaints to him whenever their rations
were of poor quality, or they had any
other grievance, and he would. see that
it was rectified. He then excused the
men from the march, and instructed his
commissary to have the bacon returned
to the depot. He also issued orders to
the company cooks to report at once
whenever they found poor rations had
been issued.
THE OFFICIAL ORDERS.
Direction Given to Regiments 1
Commanders by Major Gen-
eral Otis.
Following is a copy, verbatim, of the
orders issued last evening to all of the
troops of the next expedition excepting
the Nebraakans, the Idaho battalions and
the engineering corps under Lieutenant
Connor:
Tour regiment â will break camp at 7 o'clock
to-morrow morning and will take up Its march
to steamer Zealandia at Pacific Mall dock, ar
riving there at 9 o'clock, preparatory to placing
your troops on steamer. Teams will be fur
nished you to transport your baggage, and you
â will leave In camp an officer, a non-commis
sioned officer, and ten privates to load the
same as teams report.
It is probable that It will require the better
portion of the day to remove all baggage to
the steamer. Upon arrival there you will re
port to Brigadier General Greene for Instruc
tions. By command
MAJOR-GENERAL OTIS.
JOHN S. SEHON, Assistant Adjutant General.
Major General Otis informed the com-
manding officers of the NebraskanÂ»thathe
would receive his orders "not before
morning."
THE PHILIPPINE POLICE.
Orders Against the Enlistment
of Natives in the United
States Army.
As Indicative of the Government's policy
toward the insurgent natives of the Phil
ippines the following circular, written on
the 11th inst. but not delivered until yes
terday afternoon to all commanders of
expeditionary troops, is of paramount in
terest:
"Headquarters Independent Department
of the Pacific.
"San Francisco, June 11, 189 S.
"Acting upon information this day re
ceived upon the subject of enlistment of
natives of the Philippine Islands, the ma
jor general commanding directs you that,
for the present, no such natives be en
listed either in our regular or volunteer
regiments. Very respectfully,
"JOHN L. SEHON,
"Assistant Adjutant General."
Patriotic Home Helpers.
The executive committee of the Patri
otic Home Helpers held an enthusiastic
meeting at the Occidental Hotel yester
day afternoon. A great many applica
tions for help were made by the wives
and families of the soldiers who have
gone to the front.
In addressing the meeting on the ob
jects of the association Judge Patterson
said:
In the execution of the purposes of the cam
paign, it Is the duty of the Government and
every citizen of our country to aid and protect
not only those who actually engage In the con
flict, but to assist and provide for the depend
ents of the latter. Under our form of Govern
ment much of this work is necessarily left to
the Individual citizen, and to civic organiza
tions. In view of this fact, and with a pa
triotic appreciation of the responsibilities rest
ing upon them In the present crisis, our citi
zens have organized and have done great and
good work under the flag of the Red Cross
for the men who have enlisted.
But ther.e are others making great sacrifices
on behalf of the nation and of humanity and
who cannot be directly assisted and cared for
by the Red Cross organization; they are the
needy and deserving families of the enlisted
men; and It is to reach and aid these natural
and deserving wards of the nation that the
society of "The Patriotic Home Helpers" has
been formed. We cannot all go to the front,
but we can all do something for the cause.
Exhibitions of patriotism and courage are not
confined to those In actual battle. Great deeds
of heroism and sacrifice occur at home In such
times.
We have about 7000 men who have responded
to the call for troops. Naturally there will be
many dependents left In distress. The pay of
the soldier is only about $15 per month. It will
be some time before he can remit this little
cum and generally he will need It all for him
self. The necessity for funds is therefore im
mediate. Those who cannot contribute money
may be able to send food or clothing, and
those who cannot do that much may be able
to assist In procuring employment for the
members of dependent families. '

Hon. W. W. Morrow, president; Hon. James
D. Phelan, first vice president; Major W. B.

Death of a Recruit.
Private Damann, Company X, Four
teenth Infantry, died at the French Hos
pital late yesterday afternoon of pneu
monia. The unfortunate soldier was only
taken to the hospital late last week. He
had been sick for several days but had not
reported himself upon the sick roll of the
company, so that he was In a serious con
dition before any one was aware of his
illness. Damann was a new recruit,
having joined the Fourteenth only a few
weeks ago. Private Damann was a native
of Faribault, Minn., where his mother
resides. He was a waif, who In his own
small way gave his mite, his allâ his life
for the stars and stripes. He will be given
a military funeral and laid to rest In the
National Cemetery.

NEW POLICE STATION.
The Commissioners Decide to
Establish One at Camp
Merritt.
The Police Commissioners have decided
to establish a police station at Camp
Merritt.
Yesterday the Chief of Police visited the
camp and selected a spot for the erection
of a temporary station. Sergeants Tobin,
Perrin and Duncan will alternate as sta
tion keepers. They will have eighteen
men under them who will be compelled to
stand watches of eight hours each.
Patrolman Fell, who was struck over
the head with a bayonet by a sentry for
refusing to "stand back" when ordered
to do so, has been relieved from duty at
the camp. Fearing that he would be
killed if allowed to remain at the camp.
Chief Lees wisely ordered him removed
to the Seventeenth-street station.

fornia.
Colonel Peney hopes to get an organiza*
tion of 100 colored troops accepted and.
mustered into the United States service
under the second call for troops from this
State. Under the third call he expects
that a twelve company regiment may be
mustered in. The Colonel says two com
panies have been recruited at Pasadena,
three at Los Angeles, two at Fresno, two
at Red Bluff and one each in San. Fran
cisco and Sacramento. He says the troops
will be able to endure the climate of the
Philippines, and, in fact, be more service
able there than white troops. The colored
organization maintains headquarter* at
1655 Market street.
War Incidents.
There have been enrolled 308 recrulta for
the First California Regiment since last
Wednesday, and if all are accepted this
number will more than fill the regiment
to its maximum. The physical examina
tion will be begun to-morrow morning at
the recruiting office in the regimental ar
mory. Page and Gough streets.
Ex-Congressman A. Caminettl has ten

TO CELEBRATE
BUNKER HILL DAY
THIS YEAR WILL SURPASS ALB
FORMER EFFORTS.
An Elaborate Programme Prepared,
Los Gatos to Be the Scene of a
Magnificent Display.
Preparations for the forthcoming cele
bration of the battle of Bunker Hill oa
Friday, June 17, at Los Gatos. were com
pleted last right at the meeting of the
executive committee of the four .--ocierieÃ
having the affair in hand, viz., Bunker
Hill Association, Native Sons of Vermont,
Sons of the American Revolution and tho
California Society of Pioneers. From
present indications the joint observance
of the day will f ciipse all previous sforts
in that regard and the committee has la
boied assiduously to bring about such a
result.
It was stated that three trains will leave
Fourth and Towrisend at 8:30 Friday
morning and for the convenience of peo
ple who live across the bay the narrow
gauge train will leave Fourteenth and
Webster at 8:15. On arriving at Loa
Gatos they will be met by members of i?ie
local Board of Trade, memhcn of the
Grand Army of the Republic, Patriotic
Sons of America, and' various other so
cieties. The parade will be formed at the
depot and will march down the main
street and at Church street countermarch
to Bunker Hill Park, which will be spe
cially dedicated to the occasion. A distin
guishing feature of the day will be the
raising of a Bunker Hill flag made to rep
resent, the original.
A communication, was read from H. C.
Corbin. adjutant general, stating that the
request for the firing of salutes from the
forts In the harbor had been approved by
the Secretaary of War and had been so
ordered.
General Merritt wrote that the kind in
vitation to attend the exercises had been
received, and although he WTmself would
be unable to attend no doubt some of his
staff would be present.

AID FOR THE RED CROSS.
IT is evident, from what has already been needed at
the hands of the Red Cross Society, that the future
draft, before this war is all over and permanent
garrisons are sent afar and larger navies manned, will
be immense.
No mathematics can measure what has been already
accomplished here. It is apparent that we have
been much more in evidence than the people
East. Perhaps this is because the troops from many
interior States have been concentrated upon San
Francisco, while those moved from the interior
toward the Gulf and the Atlantic have been rendez
voused in many far-scattered camps, and there has
been no concentration to excite interest and stimulate
sympathy. This has been the means of affording a
contrast very favorable and flattering to California.
The same family may be getting letters from members
in camp here and at Tampa. The letters from Cali
fornia will tell of towns in committee of the whole
from the State line to the Golden Gate to receive the
tired recruits with every manifestation of fellowship
and brotherly good will. They will tell of the food
and flowers that awaited them on landing in San
Francisco and the kindness in camp that warded
homesickness away, while the letters from the other
camps will have only the perfunctory attentions re
quired by the regulations to tell about, and there will
be but little to say of such cheer and comfort and
homelike touches as have been lavished here.
What has been well begun must be well done to the
end. With larger calls there must be more extensive
preparations. The treasury of the Red Cross must be
filled and kept full. To this end the means so suc
cessfully resorted to during the Civil War should be
put in action here. As San Francisco it tho metro
politan center, the peopk of this city should institute
and carry to success a great Red Cross fair. It could
be made a historic and art exhibition. In the his
toric section the history of this State could be illus
trated by whatever tells the story of the two sovereign
ties whose jurisdiction of this soil preceded ours. The
history of our occupation would be grouped in such
a way a3 to show the rise of every civil subdivision,
of counties, of towns and cities. Another historical
phase would begin with whatever sets forth the re
ligious history of California; objects from the 'old
missions; the early history of the great religious
bodies; their pioneer churches; the first synagogue
and the first rabbi who read in it the scroll of the
Pentateuch; all this would bring together for the
first time and crystallize into form an interesting
feature of our life.
The art section could borrow from the very rich
private galleries of this and other cities. It is prob
able that there is more money invested in California
in works of art in proportion to our population than
In any other State in the Union. These treasures can
be exhibited with good effect upon the taste of our
people, which will be refined and advanced by the
lesson.
In addition to these features there may be interest
ing outdoor affairs, of which more may be said here
after.
In this way the Red Cross Society may be per
manently equipped for anycall to be made upon it Tlie
great and patriotic public will prefer to do it this way
and be relieved of many and repeated appeals for
money in counting rooms, stores, shops, churches,
lodges and public offices. Men will give once for all
at such an exhibition more than the aggregate of do
nations made under circumstances of personal solici
tation. The relief, then, will be two-sidedâ that to
be extended by the Red Cross and that to the public
in the manner of the giving. Let this be seriously
considered.
Unless flags are flying from every available pole
this morning, houses and stores decorated with the
national colors, San Francisco will not be paying
proper attention to the fact that it is flag day, and that
the stars and stripes have reached the dignity of 121
years. To be sure many flags have been flying for
days/ and people have been busy about patriotic em
ployments, but there is room for more flags and an
excuse for livelier demonstration.
There is no particular reason for thinking that with
Manila in the hands of the insurgents there will be
nothing for American soldiers to do but 101 l around
camp smoking cheroots. The insurgents themselves
are not people in whose constancy one may entertain
a sweet and abiding faith.
Admiral Camara is doomed. He can come over
here and take his medicine or stay at home and wait
for it to be carried to him, but the dose is being pre
pared, and it will be fatal.
President Patton of Princeton is patriotic. The cir
cumstance is rare and pleasing as the announcement
of it is alliterative.
fIDMIRfIL DEWEY'S REPORT.
ri DMIRAL DEWEY'S official report to the
/ \ Navy Department on the action at Manila Bay
confirms in every respect the story of the vic
tory as told by The Call. It contains but one new
item of information, and public interest in it will be
due mainly to the fact that every loyal American will de
sire to read the account given of the great achieve
ment by the heroic commander himself.
It will be noted that the admiral is most just and
generous in the commendation and praise given to his
men and the officers who under his leadership directed
them during the action. "I beg to state to the de
partment," says the admiral, "that I doubt if any
commander-in-chief was ever served by more loyal,
efficient and gallant captains than those of the squad
ron now under my command."
In the list of those whom the admiral selected for
the honor of direct mention by name L J. L. Stick
ney, the correspondent of the Herald and The Call.
Of him the admiral said: "He volunteered as my aid
and rendered valuable service." Thus it will be seen
our representative at the battle not only watched the
combat closely as a war correspondent charged with
the duty of giving the first report of it to the public,
but he found time also to assist in the victory as aid
to the commander-in-chief, thus performing double
service during the whole of the eventful day.
In his letter describing the battle Mr. Stickney said
nothing of his own service as aid to the admiral.
That, therefore, is the one feature of news in the re
port. This it will be noted is quite different from the
course pursued by the correspondents of yellow jour
nals when by any chance they are within the hearing
of the guns of battle. In the Manila fight it happens
there were no yellow correspondents at all. It is safe
to say it will be a long time before any of the Ex
aminer fakers ever receive honorable mention in an
official report.
It is doubly gratifying to The Call to be able to fol
low up the story of the victory as given by Mr. Stick
ney with that of Admiral Dewey, in which Mr. Stick
ney himself received due honor for his own patriotic
and courageous sen-ice during the action.
THE GEARY-STREET FRANCHISE.
THE petition of the Geary-street Cable Company
for a renewal of its franchise is a source of great
anxiety to a boodle morning contemporary. Not
only does this authority produce a daily "argument"
to show that the Supervisors have no power at this
time to advertise the franchise for sale, but it quotes
copiously from the law to prove that if they attempt
to do so they will be guilty of malfeasance in office.
The interest thus manifested is more than pathetic;
it is calculated to move the heart of a stone dog,
which is about the most immovable thing on earth.
The franchise of the Geary-street company will ex
pire in 1903. The act of 1897, providing for the sale
of railway franchises, forbids the renewal of any now
being exercised until one year next preceding their
expiration. If this law is complied with the franchise
of the Geary-street line cannot be advertised for sale
until 1902, unless in the meantime the company now
holding it abandons it, which it may, of course, easily
do. If the sale of this valuable property can be post
poned until 1902 it will come under the provisions of
the new charter and may be so weighted down with
restrictions as to make its purchase undesirable. The
effort of the Market-street company, which has suc
ceeded to the rights of the Geary-street company, to
effect a sale at this time may thus be readily under
stood. Whether a renewal of the franchise and the
construction of an electric line to be managed by
the Market-street company would be in the interest of
the public and residents of Geary street we do not
know. It is apparent that it would not be in the in
terest of The, Boodler. That is sufficiently attested
by its present anxiety.
If The Boodler were as friendly with the "Solid
Eight" in the Board of Supervisors as it was prior to
the Spring Valley cinch of last year probably it would
not so vigorously oppose the renewal of the Geary
street franchise. But ever since the "eight" declined
its assistance in holding up the water company a feel
ing of hostility has existed which has been greatly
augmented by the attempt of Mayor Phelan, The
Boodler's especial protege, to oust the Supervisors.
There is no chance to make money out of the Geary
street franchise. Even if the Southern Pacific were
disposed to restore The Boodler to its payroll at
$1000 a month it would not do so on account of any
opposition it might make to the renewal of this fran
chise. All the corporation need do in the premises is
to pave the way legally and the Supervisors will do
the rest, irrespective of what The Boodler says or
thinks.
Hence The Boodler may as well cease from trou
bling. There is nothing in the Geary-street franchise
for it. That privilege belongs to the "Solid Eight,"
and that aggregation of statesmen will not divide.
If the Market-street company wants the franchise
it can abandon its present privilege and ask for an
other. Being the owner of a track, roadbed and cars
it can bid more than any other corporation at the
sale. The Railroad Commission is not a very fruitful
field for the exercise of its talents, but if The Boodler
desires to be restored to the payroll it should confine
its efforts to that locality. There is no chance to
break in via Geary street.
Why the Spanish statesmen continue to talk like
fools is one of the great mysteries of war. Their nervÂ«
in rebuking the United States Government for "in
stigating rebellion" among a population capable "of
pillaging, devastating, violating and torturing" sur
passes all human understanding. In these terms the
Spanish exactly describe their own methods of war
tare. They have set the example, been the instiga
tors, and yet blither nonsense about being horrified
at the muss they have stirred tip. Perhaps the Span
ish are trying to paVe the way for a plea of insanity.
If so they can have all of Spain for an asylum, but it
would never do for armed lunatics to be permitted on
the high seas.
An English correspondent writes to his home paper
commending the American soldier, but expressing
distaste for the uniform. If the uniform is comfort
able its appearance is a matter of secondary import
ance. The man inside of it will do the fighting.
Young Letter will get no sympathy over his fail
ure. A Providence, which still seems to have benign
streaks in it, naturally throws obstacles in the way of
any man's scheme for possessing all the wheat on
earth.
Spain says \t can continue the war in Cuba two
years. But it can't. Long before the expiration of
this time it will have nothing to say about affairs in
the island save to pass regretful remarks.
Germany manifests anxiety to know what this GovÂ«
ernemnt intends doing with the Philippine*. An ex
cellent plan would be for Germany to wait and see.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 14, 1898.
THE WOES OF W. F- HARRITY.
\A OST men and women living outside of Perm
/ \ sylvania have probably forgotten they ever
* * heard of William F. Harrity, and are oblivious
of the fact that his personal fortunes were once mat
ters of national interest. They will receive it as news,
therefore, that he has risen again above the horizon,
and his woes are once more the subject of high de
bate and mad language in the great circles of poli
tics.
Mr. Harrity first achieved fame as the conductor of
the Democratic campaign which resulted in the elec
tion of Cleveland for the second term. He was the
national committeeman from Pennsylvania when the
campaign of 1896 was going on, but, being a gold
man, he was turned down by the Democratic State
Convention of Pennsylvania last year and a silver man
chosen in his place. From this action of the State
convention Mr. Harrity appealed, on the ground that
che convention had no authority to remove him. The
issue raised an interesting point in the practice of
politics and for a time the discussion over it waged
long and loud.
The chairman of the Democratic National Com
mittee, Senator Jones, is a man who believes in the
healing power of time. He holds to the belief that
any fire will die out after a while if you let it alone,
and that it is therefore foolish to risk burning your
hands in trying to extinguish it. He let the Harrity
controversy alone for a year. It was never settled.
Now it has burst out again with as much fury as ever,
and it appears the new flaming forth is due to the
pernicious activity of Colonel William J. Bryan.
According to the Washington correspondent of the
Philadelphia Times Chairman Jones, having been
stirred up on the issue after the lapse of a year, sub
mitted the question by letter to the various members
of the national committee. Of the first replies re
ceived a large majority were favorable to Harrity, and
it appeared he would be retained in his place. Then
Bryan interfered, and by letters and otherwise took an
active part in the fight against the gold man, with the
result that the aspect of the situation has changed and
the woes of Mr. Harrity are more woeful than ever.
Reviewing the controversy from the Washington
standpoint the Times correspondent says: "Mr. Har
rity's friends here gave up hope of his retention in the
committee after Mr. Bryan entered actively into the
contest and expressed his willingness to accept the
responsibility for Mr. Harrity's removal. The con
servative leaders of the party do not hesitate to de
clare that a mischievous practice will be established,
but they seem powerless to prevent it."
The interest which the general public has in the de
feat of Harrity lies in the light it throws upon tfie con
dition prevailing in the national Democratic council.
For some time past Gorman and Hill and other emi
nent Democrats have been assiduously working to
drag their party out of the slough of free silver and
Bryanism in time to enable it to take the field in the
Congressional elections this fall with a fair chance of
success. The defeat of Harrity shows that these ef
forts have been unavailing. The Bryanit? leaders are
in the saddle and the Democratic donkey is not able
to dismount them. Colonel Bryan may go to war,
but he will still show enough activity in politics to
keep his opponents in the party out of its councils
and out of authority.
RAILROADS IN THE ORIENT.
rROM recently published statements concerning
the export of American locomotives to foreign
countries it appears the Orient is the largest
purchaser in the market and that railroad extension
in that portion of the world is going forward at con
siderable speed. They also show that our locomotives
are in good demand and that we have a chance for
an increasing trade in railway material of all kinds
with the newly awakened people of both China and
Japan.
A representative of the Baldwin Locomotive Works
is quoted as saying his c^opipuny within the last two
months has received orders for 107 locomotives, 83 of
these for railroads in Eastern China, 10 for New Zea
land, six, curiously enough, for SpaLi, two for Argen
tina, one for Mexico and five for Egypt. The
Schenectady Locomotive Works report an order of
thirty-eight engines for Japan, the Brooks Locomo
tive Works five for Japan and the Richmond Loco
motive Works seventeen for the Finland-Russian
state railway.
Thus of the 167 locomotives for which foreign or
ders have been given to the various works named no
less than 126 are for the Orient. An order from a
single company for eighty-three locomotives for
China is in itself significant of the rapidity with which
industrial changes are going on in that old empire. It
is clear that our trade interests with the Chinese are
expanding rapidly and that it will be folly if we do
not take steps to promote and foster them by every
means in our power.
In making these inroads into foreign markets our
industries are handicapped by the lack of American
shipping. Our manufacturers and our farmers would
compete with their rivals for the rich trade of the
Orient on better terms if they had equal advan
tages in shipping. This marked development of the
Oriental market ought therefore to prove a strong
incentive to Congress to hasten the enactment of
legislation favorable to the upbuilding of our mer
chant marine. A one-sided growth is never healthy
nor durable. If we are to promote our industries at
home and make the United States the manufacturing
center of the world we must also promote our indus
tries on the sea and make our shipping equal to the
demands of our commerce.
It would seem that at this time a man educated, fed
and clothed by the Government, as Schwerin was,
ought to be glad of the opportunity to show a fitting
gratitude by offering his services to the nation whose
ward he has been and whose pay he drew until his
relative, Huntington, snatched from the perils of
naval life, with its chances of court-martial and the
grand bounce. But now duty calls even to Schwerin.
He ought to volunteer to rejoin the navy rather than
linger about the Pacific Mail dock hampering the
outfitting of ships. This would show his good will
and not put him to any inconvenience, as the offer
would be rejected in less time than would be required
to make it.
The Victoria man who wired to Sagasta for letters
of marque so as to be able to go after ships loaded
with Klondike gold is probably a joker. However,
he ought to have the hose turned on him, an opera
tion which would be the same intellectual grade of
jest.
Admiral Camara would better stay in Spanish
waters. At least, he has the privilege of remaining
on the surface of them.
.General Greely's sweeping order against the trans
mission of war new 9 cannot keep people from
guessing.
In addition to their war-paint the ships of the navy
are being covered with glory.

The Consul General for Guatemala
Replies to an Attack in the
Bulletin.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., June 13, IS9S.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: In
last Saturday's Bulletin appeared an i
article in which It was stated that I was I
boasting of being of Spanish origin. It :
also contained absurdities of a similar na
ture, all of which were intended to make
my sojourn here unpleasant and to raise
susceptibilities against me. This article,
like all others, which are infamous,
calumnious and cowardly, does not bear j
any signature, nor are the names of .the ;
persons given who are said to have ac
cused me. However, I know very well
that it originated with the same three
persons, only one of them being a
Guatemalan, who through envy and by
political intrigues have attacked me in
the Bulletin since September last. As all
their other attacks resulted in naught i
they now try this new calumny with the i
most venomous intentions, characteristic!
of degraded people. So far I have treated \
al these attacks with the contempt they
deserve, but since they begin to touch
upon such a delicate point, I have to
protect with the greatest /energy against!
what my hidden enemies publish about
me, by declaring that I always used the
greatest reserve whenever conversation >
turned upon the existing war, and that I I
always preferred not to speak about it at !
oil, thus as was becoming to my official i
position, which I know very well how to'
uphold. This very position does not pec
rait me to be very explicit in the matter; !
but l profess- my greatest sympathies for
this great country, which every day I !
learn to love more, I am here by my own I
free will and visited San Francisco three
times and New York twice before I was
appointed Consul, and did so because l\
liked the Americans.
My enemies say that I publicly declared
to be a Spaniard; if so ft will.be an easy
matter to bring witnesses, who neces- 1
sarily must have" heard my declaration,"
but I defy them, as they will be at a loss
to procure one.
Lastly, I mention that there Is no
Guatemalan colony here at present, either
prominent or not prominent. Outside of
two or three true gentlemen, who are;
friends of mine, there are none, as all the
families which used to live here have re
turned to Guatemala. I am, dear sir,
very respectfully yours, ?

Consul-General for Guatemala.
THE PROBLEM OT THE FUTURE.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: In con- '
nectlon with the acquisition by the Unit
ed Stairs of the island territories of Ha
waii, the Philippines and Porto Rico,
there are consideratlonsiiot to be lost sight
uf that arc- Infinitely highor and of far ;
greater import than the mere extension of
our commercial empire and the enlarge
ment of our facilities for uefense*against
a foreign foe. If we terminate the pres
â¢ in government by which the Inhabitants ;
of those respective islands are controlled,
ami do not vouchsafe to them the right
to govern themselves, then this nation
must assume the responsibility of gov
erning them. This carries with it the ne- i
cessity 01 civilizing them, of protecting ;
them against internecine strife, provid
ing for their maintenance against the
greed and rapacity of predatory political
adventurers, commercial cormorants and
conscienceless land grabbers, and lastly,
of educating and christianizing them. :
Does this nation want to assume such a
burden of responsibility in the face of the
fact that there are now within the'bor
ders of the Union hundred.- of thousands
of men and women who are more in need
of the aid of advance civilisation to fit !
them as citizens of a christianized na-
Uon than are those islanders, judged from
a standpoint of legal and moral recti- i
tude? Should, this Government annex Ha
wail by seizure or otherwise, and make
conquest of the Philippines and Porto
Rico, would we, by our treatment of the ;
natives, add to the odium we have
brought upon ourselves as a nation by
.our policy toward the American Indians'"
One would scarcely think so: and yet it is
painfully apparent that in all the talk
new rife about these islands becoming
the property of or a part of the Uriited
States there is no expressed consldera- i
tion for the welfare and advancement of !
the natives. It is all for expansion of i
trade, extending commercial and t.rrito- I
rial empire, and enlarging and strength
ening our defenses against encroachment
by any of our ambitious neighbors of the
Eastern hemisphere. In a word, the
animus is selfish greed, which is greatly
to be deprecated and deplored, seeing :
that we are professedly a Christian na
tion. The question that should be up- ;
permost with us in this matter is. Do the ;
natives of these islands want to come
under the government of the United
States? JOHN AUBREY JONES.

JUDGE MAGUIRE'S LETTER.
Even His Friends Think He'd Better
Keep Out of Print.
Excited by the general hareh tone of j
the press criticisms upon his celebrated j
"piracy" remarks anent the Government |
seizing Spanish ships conveying supplies |
to the enemy, Hon. James G. Maguire |
: flew into print in last Sunday's Call, and I
we're of the opinion that when he cooled j
off he was sorry he allowed his anger to '
run away with his judgment. The Call ;
answered his letter on Monday, and we :
advise our readers to endeavor to read
both productions. Here is an extract from !
The Call's answer:
"Judge Maguire's letter in its manner is I
an index to his intellectual methods and ;
I his mental stature. He conceives that
I we hold him up to be seen by himself be- |
cause he "was born on a farm." We con- i
fess the infelicity of not knowing that he ''
was born on a farm, but we admit It since
Ihe takes pains to advertise it. He has ;
j been so constantly an office-seeker and
office-holder that it was natural to sup
pose that he was not born at all, but just
nominated for an office and raised on a
salary."â Hollister Free Lance.
We believe that It was Martin Van
Buren who gave a friend the advice,
"Walk forty miles rather than write a
letter. The epistolary art may have
advanced to a point that letter-writing is
less dangerous than it was thought to be
by Van Buren. Still, there is good sense
in the advice, and we commend it to the
consideration of Congressman Maguire,
who has recently written a three-column
letter to the San Francisco Call. He
should not have done so. Nearly every
public man Is misrepresented and ma
ligned by the journals published by hia
political opponents. It should not be so,
but that it is true is unquestionable". If
Congressman Maguire Qnda any satisfac
tion in his reply to The Call, we are free
to say we do not think his friends will.
Congressman Maguire will find It a wise
policy to satisfy his friends and ignore
his journalistic enemies. His friends are
satisfied, but if the Congressman's dis
position to write letters is not checked
we are uncertain how long they will con
tinue in that mind.â Vacaville Reporter.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Almirante O'Higgins, armored
cruiser built for Chile by the Armstrong
Company at Elswick, completed her trials
April 20. She made a continuous run
of twenty-four hours under three-fifths
boiler power and developed 10,600 horse
power. Six runs over the measured mile
course gave an average speed of 21.7
knots, a little less than anticipated. The
O'Higgins is of 8500 tons displacement, 411
feet 9 inches in length, 62 feet 6 inches
beam, and her engines will develop 16,000
horse power. She carries an armament of
four 8-inch quick-firers, ten 6-inch, four
4.7 -inch, ten 12-pounders, ten 6-pounders
and four machine guns, all quick firers.
The Kiangnaw arsenal on the Woosung
River, throe miles above Shanghai, em
ploys 2500 men in the manufacture of guns
and projectiles under the management of
three Englishmen. Several 12-inch guns
have been turned out. besides a large
number of smaller caliber, and are said
to be equal to work done in Europe and
the United States. The arsenal has also
a small dry dock, 300 feet in length, and a
railway connects the arsenal with the
proving grounds at Whangpoo. The loco
motive hauling the guns out for testing
was built by Chinese mechanics six years
ago, and Is doing all that was expected
from it.
A new dry dock was opened at the dock
yard at Sebastopol May 18.
The British cruiser Terrible is under or
ders to make a run from Portsmouth to
Gibraltar under 10,000 horse power. She
is expected to make the run of 1160 milea
in sixty-eight hours. After a stay of
twenty-four hours at Gibraltar she is to
return to Portsmouth under 15,000 horse
power and make the run in sixty-two
hours.
A battle-ship was launched at Bt. Pe
tersburg May 18 in the presence of the
Czar and Czarina, and the keelplates of
the armored cruiser Gromoboi of 12.336
tons and that of a small cruiser were
laid. ,
In the recent competition for armor
contracts for the Russian battle-ships
Peresviet and Oslabia, the Carnegie Com
pany at Pittsburg fairly outbid European
competitors. The bids per ton were in
order as follows from the several
countries: England â Vickers. $583 %;
John Brown, $569 38. France â St.
Chamonds, $490 and $569: Chatillon, $486 to
$o3G 50; Marrel Freree, $530 70 and $382 for
thick and thin plates. Germanyâ Krupp,
$stj2 50; Dillingen, $559 30; Witkowitz, thin
plates, $152 20. United Statesâ Carnegie,
$530 45. The Russian Government prof
fered the contract to the last firm if it
would accept it at $500 per ton, and the
offer was accepted. This incident dis
closes the fact that there ia to all ap
pearance no combination between Euro
pean armor manufacturers, but that the
American success may lead to such a
combination In order to shut out competi
tion from this country. It is also evident
that European armor manufacturers ex
act greater profits from their plant or
else that owing to better system Carne
gie is enabled to overcome the difference
in wages paid. The most satisfactory evi
dence is that our navy is getting its ar
mor at 80 per cent of the cost paid by
Russia, as the contract just awarded to
Carnegie and Bethlehem allows only $400
per ton for three battle-ships, whereaa
Russia pays $500.
The San Martino, armored cruiser built
by Orlando Brothers, Leghorn. Italy, for
the Argentine Republic, has just had her
trial under natural draught and made a
speed of IS knots. She is a sister ship
to the Spanish armored cruiser Cristobal
Colon, and to the Garibaldi in the Argen
tine navy, of 6540 tons, 13,000 horse power
and a speed under forced draught of 20
knots. Her armament has been changed
from two 10-inch to four 8-inch quick
firers. and she will also carry ten 6-inch,
six 4.7-inch, ten 2.2-inch, ten 1.4-inch and
two machine guns. All the guns are

The Austrian naval programme pro
vides for fifteen battle-ships, seven sec

ers, fifcon torpedo avisos and ninety tor
pedo boat destroyers and torpedo boats.
An annual expenditure of $27,000,000 up to
1909 is asked for, but Austrian finances
are not in a healthy condition, and the
ambitious naval programme will not ma
terialize.

driver of automotors. She took her ex
aminers, who were a state engineer and
two experts appointed by the Prefect of
Police, on her car through the Bols de
Boulogne and around Paris. She drove
at the regulation maximum of speed,
which is sixteen kilometers, or about ten
miles, an hour. According to those who
are supposed to know, automobilism is
now fast supplanting the bicycle craze in

Speaking of his name General Fitzhugh
Lee said not long ago: "It has been a
heavy load. I have had the reputation
of a lot of ancestors as well as my own
to look after. Whatever good 1 have
done has been credited to them, and what
ever evil has been charged to me and
magnified, because people said they had
a right to expect much better things of
a man of my blood and breeding. When
I was running for Governor of Virginia
John AVise said that if my name had been
Fitzhugh Smith I never would have se
cured the nomination. I replied that I
had known many good men named Smith,
and would have been as proud of that
name as of the one I wore. In that way
I got the votes of the Smiths in Vir
ginia, and a letter from a man who told
me 'never to forget John Smith, our first
settler, who killed Pocahontas.' "

WILL GLORIFY THE FOURTH.
JOHN J, BARRETT, Who Has Been Chosen Orator of
the Dau bu the Fourth of Julu Committee.
At a meeting of the literary committee of the Fourth of July committee
yesterday afternoon John J. Barrett was unanimously chosen as orator of
the day. The arrangements for the literary exercises have not as yet been
entirely completed, but no trouble will be scared to make thf-m exceed even
the successful entertainment given last year. It Is probable that Metro
politan Temple will be selected, although there is some doubt as to whether
it Is large enough, ;ih last year hundreds were turned away. Mr. Barrett is
a rising your.g lawyer, and ha* already addressed several large public
meetings in this city and vicinity.
The general committee has now got down to hard, active work, and If It Is
enabled to carry out half its plans this Fourth will be a memorable one.
One of the most successful events last year was the regatta, and Grattan
Phillips, chairman of the regatta committee, Is already among the rowing
dubs and Whitehall boatmen to arrange for a day's sport on the bay which
will totally eclipse any previous efforts made in this direction. The general
committee la still considering the advisability of opening a subscription
list, but many of the members prefer Beelng the celebration carried out on
the $3000 donated by the Board of Supervisors.

SALTER D. WORDEN
WILL NOT HANG
MEDICAL EXPERTS REPORT
THAT HE IS INSANE.
Governor Budd Says He Will Accept
the Report of Scientists and
Conirnute the Sentence.
The commission appointed by Governor
Budd to investigate the mental condition
of Salter D. Worden has found after an
examination of the evidence that Worden
baa an Inherited predisposition to insan
ity and that he comes from what doc
tors call neuropathic stock. Governor
liudd says he will commute the prisoner's
sentence to life imprisonment.
The commission having duly considered
the manifest intelligence, high standing
and sincerity of the persons from whom
the above evidence has been obtained, ac
cepta these statements as true and holds
that the legitimate conclusion is that
Worden was insane and irresponsible
when the crime of which he has been
convicted was committed.
The report ends as follows: "Your com
mission would recommend, in view of the i
fort going evidence, and the conclusions
ed therefrom, that the sentence of j
de.ith should be commuted to that of
imprisonment for life; and further, that
owing to the dangerous form of insanity I
from which Salter D. Worden is surfer
ing, the welfare of society in general and
the welfare of this diseased and unfor- ;
tunate individual demands that he should
be continuously imprisoned during the re
maining years of his life.

Hospital."
"I shall probably act favorably upon .
the report thru has been filed in regard to
the mental condition of Salter Worden," \
said Governor Budd yesterday afternoon,
"and any further than that I shall not
discuss the matter to-day."
The report saves the life of the train
wrecker. It says in substance that Wor
den's mental condition is such that it
would be un.iust to execute the death pen
alty, and therefore life imprisonment is
recommended.
Dr. Gardner of the Xapa Insane
Asylum, who recently returned from the
East, collected a mass of evidence in the
shape of letters and affidavits from the
relatives and acquaintances of Worden
living in Syracuse, N. V., his former
home, and immediate vicinity. This evi
dence he turned over to Dr. Clark of the
Stockton Asylum, and Dr. Hatch. State
Commissioner of Lunacy and general su
perintendent of the State hospitals, and
the report saving Worden's neck was the
result.
THRISTIANS AND MISSIONARIES
The Alliance Is Holding Interesting
Sessions at the U. P. Church.
Tfie sessions of the Christian and Mis
sionary Alliance held at the United Pres
byterian Church, at the corner of Golden
Gate -avenue and Polk street, yesterday
were well attended, and interesting ad
dresses were delivered by different dele
gates.
The principal address at the meeting
held in the morning was by Rev. A. D.
Simpson of New Tork, who spoke from
the subject, "The Faith of Abraham."
Dr. Simpson Is the president of the alli
ance, and the close attention paid his ad
dress proved the love his hearers bear
toward him.
In the evening Rev. Mr. Simpson was
again called upon for a sermon and took
for his subject, "The Second Coming of
the Lord." He spoke of the second com
ing of God as applied to the foreign mis
sionary work. Rev. D. W. le Laehour,
the superintendent of the alliance mis
sionaries in China, followed Dr. Simpson,
speaking In the same line. lie called the
attention of the congregation to the great
field open for missionaries In the Philip
pine Islands, which have hitherto been
closed to Christian workers. At the con
clusion of his discourse volunteers were
called for who were willing to go to Ma
nila and engage In the missionary work,
and a number signified tfieir intention of
offering their services.
LOST HIS HANDCUFFS
Policeman Murphy Has an Exciting
Encounter With Two Soldiers.
Officer Dave Murphy had a lively ex
perience with two Boldiers last night. The
boys in blue engaged in an altercation
with a bootblack who has a stand at
Stockton and Sutter streets, and when
Murphy attempted to quiet them, one of
them drew a bowie knife and made a
lunge at him. The policeman quickly
drew his club and knocked the soldier
out. The latter's companion also at
tempted to stab Murphy, but was pre
vented by the vigorous use of the club
in the officer's hand. Murphy then start
ed to handcuff the men intending to take
them to the City Prison. Scarcely had
he placed a cuff on the wrist of one of the
soldiers when the other struck him, almost
knocking him down.
Murphy requested a citizen who was
standing by to run to the nearest patrol
box and send in a call for the wagon.
The citizen laughed at his request, and
severely criticized the officer for arrest
ing the soldiers. Just then the two men
Jumped to their feet and ran down~Stock
ton street, taking with them the hand
cuffs of the policeman. They, however,
dropped their knives, which Murphy
picked up, and subsequently turned them
over to Lieutenant Birdsall of the Cen
tral Station.
Two Inquests.
OAKLAND. June 13.â Coroner Baldwin

WELCOMED
THE FRAWLEYS
"Number Nine" Creates
a Furor.
A NEW FARCICAL PLAY
LEWIS MORRISON IN "A CELE
BRATED CASE.
"Under the Polar Star" at the Grand.
Other Attractions That
Are Crowding the
Theaters.
A splendid house that overflowed into
the foyer, scores of people turned away
and a genuine ovation that lasted several
moments after his first entrance, was the
reception accorded T. Daniel Frawley
upon his reappearance with hi 3 new
company at the Columbia last night. It
certainly repaid Mr. Frawley for all the
enterprise, hard work and talent he has
devoted to the entertainment of the peo
ple of this city. The first nighters were
there in full force and were appreciative
enough to satisfy the most exacting
management.
Mr. Frawley introduced his new sup
port in a farcical play in three acts, from
the German of Oscar Blumenthal and
Gustav Kadelberg, entitled "Number
Nine, or the Lady of Ostend." The scene
is laid in a private house in London.
The plot turns upon the miseries caused
by the enterprise of animatoscope fiends
at Ostend, who succeed, through the ef
forts of a pretty and designing young
woman. In getting a rendezvous with
Richard Whortle.s (Edward M. Bell) and
"Ted" Blake (Mr. Frawley) in painfully
embarrassing situations. They are shown |
in the "living' pictures" at London and
Berlin, in love-muking scenes on the
beach at Ostend, and their efforts to es
cape the consequences uf their acts are
extremely ludicrous.
Mr. Bell, known as "Hoodoo Dick," a â 
young married man prone to late hours, !
escapades and invariable detection, fol- j
lowed by deep penitence, presents a piece ]
of very capable and highly enjoyable act
ing. Mr. Frawley's part is well suited to
him, being that of a handsome, young
and impulsive Irishman, who can fall in
love at the legist provocation and whoso '
boast is that he has a "castle in County
Clare, in which the nobility once stop- j
ped, when there were kings in Ireland." I
His handling <>( the slight brogue he
uses was a work of real art, and his de
velopment of the character such as could
well be expected from him. It is one I
bubbling with fun and genuine wit and
humor, that was duly appreciated.
Miss Madeline Boughton, as Dorothy
Whortles. the suspicious and jealous I
young wife, made a very favorable im
pression, particularly in the first and sec
mi.i acts. Miss EleaJnor Carey's character
of the trouble-creating mother-in-law was
excellent, and the same may be said of
the part of Samuel Edwards as Joseph
Carboy, the gay old father-in-law with I
an abiding taste for night larks with any
body but his wife present. His comedy i
is genuine and of the taking kind. Miss I
Fanchon Campbell is a dainty and pretty
member of the company and will doubt
less make many friends.
One of the best make-ups that have
been seen here for a long time is that of
Theodore Roberts as a typical British
bruiser, rounder and ex-champion "every
thing." In figure, voice and action he fit
ted the part to perfection.
Mr. Frawlev has certainly used good
judgment In the selection of his support,
and theater-goers can confidently look
forward to dramatic treats during the
company's season. Aside from some ex
cusable nervousness on the part of the
strangers, everything went nicely. The
settings were very pretty nnd natural and
were brightened by the wealth of flowers
that went over the footlights.
The play goes during the week.
At the Orpheum.
The attendance at the Orpheum last
evening- was good and the entertainment
was satisfactory to the audience. One of
the new attractions is Miss Fannle "Went
worth, recently from England. In fact,
it was her first appearance on this conti
nent, and her efforts as a vocalist and
pianist were warmly greeted. Wli^n
Ezra Kendall appeared the reception he
received showed that he was a well
known favorite with the people. The Sa
Vans received a cordial welcome after
their trip to the southern part of the
State. Carlin and Clark, German come
dinns. just from New York, caused con
siderable amusement in their specialties.
Next week the Orpheum promises a num
ber of new attractions that will be well
worth seeing.
The Tivoll.
The attendance at the opening night of
"An American Hero" at the Tlvoli proved
that the management made no mistake
when they decided to run the play for an
other week. The opera Improves upon
acquaintance, the third act especially go
ing off with added eclat. Edwin Stevens'
Father Bernard transformed into the Si
cilian Count is sidesplitting, and when he
does the waltz In the approved South
Park style the house is convulsed. Th>
opera will run during the remainder of
the week. "All Baba" is in preparation.
Grand Opera-House.
"Under the Polar Star" was the at
traction at the Grand Opera-house last
night. It was an elaborate scenic pro
duction and more than pleased the big
audience that witnessed it. There were
several recalls during: the evening and the
play was so well received that "standing
ropm only" should be the notice during
the remainder of the week.
Max Yon Mitzel as Silas Rodman, pro
jector and patron of the Rodman Arctic
research expedition, and George P. Web
ster as Dr. Achille Rabon, the scientist of
the expedition, were particularly good,
while Fred J. Butler as Alexas. the Si
berian guide and hunter, won the hearts
of many in the audience. Maud Edna
Hall and Landers Stevens sustained their
roles well and the remainder of the cast
was acceptable. "Under the Polar Star"
was well mounted and staged and was
under the direction of H. Percy Meldon.
At the Alcazar.
"A Celebrated Case" has apparently
lost none of its attraction, as the Alcazar
was crowded last night at Its' initial pro
duction by Mr. Lewis Morrison and Miss
Florence Roberts, assisted by the stock
company. The performance was an even
one throughout and the different char
acters were ably sustained. As Lazure In
the prologue and Count de Mornay in the
play Mr. Morrison showed an excellence
of contrast between the coarse and brutal
murderer and the polished villain that
wa.s marked and striking. Miss Roberts
made a most favorable Impression as
Adrlenne and at the end of the second act
of the play received a curtain call and
two splendid floral pieces. Miss Gertrude
Foster as Madeline Renaud and Valen
tine de Mornay had an opportunity of dis
tinguishing herself and she did not
neglect it. She was particularly effective
in the third act of the play when snÂ« dis
covers the identity of the necklace.
Wright Huntinyton did well as Jean
Renaud, the gallant soldier and galley
slave, but in his excitement at the close
of the play he made a faux pas by using
the word "wife" instead of "daughter,"
which caused a ripple of laughter. Wal
lace Shaw made a hit as the Irish ser
geant, and Mrs. iiates, Mrs. Adele Clark,
Clarence Montalne and Frank Denithorne
sustained their parts creditably. Little
Hazel Purdy deserves a word of praise.
The play was well mounted.
At the Chutes.
Henri Maurice Cannon, the corpulent
Swiss who boasts of an eight-foot waist
and a 38-lnch calf, is creating a sensation
at the Chutes. His receptions every af
ternoon and evening are attended by hun
dreds Interested in obesity and on Sunday
ever 7000 people visited the Ilaight-street
grounds. In the free theater little Minnie
Berlin, a wonderful child bawtone;
Charles and May Stanley In "Mrs.
O'Grndy's Wash Day"; Joseph Bovino,
contortionist, and other vaudevillians pre
sent a varied programme. The Animato
scope shows an interesting picture of Mr.
Cannon perambulating around the Chute
grounds and there are a number of new
animals in the zoo.
MYSTERY OF A SUICIDE.
Frank McCabe Ends His Life for No
Apparent Reason.
Frank McCabe of the firm of R. F. Mc-
Cabe, pmoto-engravers, took a dose of cy
anide of potassium at about 9 o'clock last
night and died a few hours later.
McCabo was only 21 years of age, and
his friends are at a loss to know what
motive impelled him to take his uwn life.
He was married about a year ag"o, was
the possessor of a comfortable home and
a partner in a good business. His father
has noticed that he has been acting
strangely for borne time past, but never
imagined that he intended committing
suicide or had any serious trouble. Last
night his wife hoard him groaning in his
room and found him writhing in the ag
onies of death. Df. Coffey was immedi
ately called in and did all in his power to
alleviate the man's suffering, but the
deadly drug had already done its work
too well.
A FATAL MIDNIGHT
COLLISION
AN ELECTRIC CAR DEMOLISHES
A DIRT WAGON.
Three Passengers of the Car and the
Driver of the Wagon
Injured.
A disastrous smashup occurred at 11
o"clock last night at Fourth and Ken
tucky streets between an electric car and
a dirt wagon. Car 113(5 of the Potrero
line was rapidly approaching the city
filled with passengers in charge of Motor
man B. Jacobs and Conductor Deegan,
and when near the corner of Fourth Ja
cobs saw a heavy dirt wagon, driven by
John Johnson of 223 Perry street, on the
track ahead. The motorman gave an
alarm on his bell, but Johnson did not
heed it. It was impossible to stop the car
to avoid a collision, although the brakes
were appli-d, and the front portion of the
car collided with the wagon, hurling its
driver cm his head and completely de
molishing the vehicle. Three passengers
in the front seats of the car were thrown
heavily to the ground and received nu
merous bruises. Jacobs' escape from in
jury was almost miraculous, lie stood at
hi.s post and, although suffering a heavy
shock, Wits able to continue his trip.
Some time was spent In removing the
wrecked wagon from the track and dis
lodging wood from beneath the car be
fore it could be moved.
Officer J. Reagan was in the vicinity
when the accident occurred and hurried
to the spot. He found Johnson in an un
cnsi'lous condition, bleeding profusely
from numerous wounds and bruises. He
and the three injured passengers were
sent to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Frank T. Fitzgibbons found that
Johnson had sustained a fractured skull,
a concussion of the brain and possibly in
ternal injuries. Seraphine vergnet, a
cook living at 711 California street, was
also severely injured. It was found that
he had received a concussion of thu brain
and possible internal injuries. His com
panion. Etnile Rossino, had his back
sprained, and David Hanley, a ship fitter
living at 533 Illinois street, suffered a
sprained leg.
Johnson was on his way to the dumping
ground with a heavy load of dirt when he
was injured.
Other passengers were well shaken by
the impact, but not injnred. The car
was badly wrecked and on the return Mp
was taken to the car house.
It is feared that Johnson will die and
but little hope is expressed by Dr. Fitz
gibbon for \ ergnet.

MINISTERS SOON
MAY TRY HIM
Edwards Davis Courts
an Investigation.
READY TO ANSWER CHARGES
â â â â â
THE SIGNATURE OF ONE MAN
NEEDED TO BEGIN.
Some Interesting Papers Bead at
the Various Denominational
Ministers' Meetings
Yesterday.
Edwards Davis, the notorious preacher
who has astonished the church-going
world by his sensational actions, will soon
appear before a Jury of brother ministers
and give explanation for his erratic con
duct while nastor of the First Christian
Church of Oakland and since severing his
connection with that institution.
At a meeting of the Christian ministers
yesterday a committee composed of Rev.'
W. A. Gardner, W. S. Berry and A. R.
Hathaway was appointed to consult with
the erring man, with a view to giving him
an opportunity to appear before an inves
tipatlng tribunal and show why he should
not be expelled from the ministry. After
the session had adjourned the committee
repaired to a lower hall in the Y. M. C. A.
building, where it met the much talked of
Individual. He showed his willingness to
appear before the body by signing a paper
prepared by the committee. The signa
ture of J. Â Wishart is needed to the
document, and just as soon as it is ob
tained the trial will begin. The latter has
proved an obstacle to the carrying on of
the investigation, as he has Strenuously
refused to attach his name to the paper.
It is said that the main reason why Wish
art refuses to sign as representative of
the Athenian church is that the charges
they mah.e against the much-abused
preacher are general, wuereas Davis is
trying to hold him down to specific
ones. Pastor Sawyer, who succeedc-d to
the pulpit of the deposed pastor and who
it is said has resigned, also signed the
agreement.
At the Presbyterian ministers' meeting
E. Woodward Brown read a paper on "To
Serve God Is to Serve Man." He said that
to serve God well was to serve man, jus
tice and brotherhood well, and that men
are most good when they are appreciative
of uod's goodness.
j.t was decided that the committee on
Jewish work be dismissed, not because
they were lacking in interest, but that
their labor wus a subject to bo taken up
by the presbytery.
Rev. S. R. Yarrow of Sausallto read a
strong essay on "The Phenomenon of
Christian Conversion and Its Relation to
the Progress of the Kingdom" before the
Congregational ministers. He pleaded for
a historical study of the results of the
use of conversion in the church. The aim
of the reader was to bring out the im
portance of the idea of conversion be
cause he thought it would make clearer
the different methods whereby the church
gets its adherents.
The Methodists held their usual inter
esting meeting in another hall. Rev. J.
L. Whftton introduced a discussion on
the methods of ministers to draw listen
ers to their churches. He alluded to the
desire of the present day preachers to
dwell on such subjects as the righteous
ness of America's conflict with Spain and
completely ignoring the gospel. He
touched on church Institutions, which
brought up a debate at the conclusion of
the paper.
Dr. Bovard said he did not approve of
ministers chasing after the institutional
church fad, while Dr. Locke believed that
everything making for peace and right
eousness bears the Influence of Christi
anity. He did not consider that a man
ought to be discarded because the crowds
follow him or because the masses were
interested in him. He thought the
church ought to be the liveliest thing in
San Francisco. It ought to be a Chris
tian church. That multitudes living in
narrow alleys were without places to
amuse thf-m and that the work should be
wide enough to entertain all. It should
be as broad as the wants of the people.
The Christian church should be able to fill
all the wants It meets. If a man wants a
little money he ought to be able to leave
his watch to procure It. and it should be
an employment office, and every effort
should be'made to serve God.
A committee, composed of Dr. Ham
mond, Chaplain Macomber of Angel
Island and Dr. Locke, was appointed to
draw up suitable resolutions expressive
of interest in the four Methodist chap
lains who are serving in the United
States volunteer army.
SHE WANTED TO DIE.
A young woman named Marie Esqueba
is locked up In a padded cell in the Re
ceiving Hospital pending an examination
as to her sanity. The unfortunate
woman was employed as a domestic in
the family of Mrs. Bennett, of 62 Rausch
street, and recently her employer sus
pected that she was losing her mind. Yes
terday afternoon she became violent, and
attempted to strangle herself with a
handkerchief. Fearing that she would
make another attempt on her life, Mrs.
Bennett had her taken to the Receiving
Hospital.
The Chinese Flag.
The standard of the Celestial Empire Is a
very queer looking affair. It represents the
most grotesque of green dragons on a yellow
ground. The latter Is suggestive not only of
the national complexion, but also of that of
a sufferer from biliousness. To remove this
unbecoming tint from the omplexion use

â¢peedily regulate your liver, prevent malaria,
and remedy dyspepsia, nervousness, rheuma

STOREKEEPING WISDOM,
A Far-Sighted Salesman Will Give You
What You Ask For.
The merchant who does business with
his eyes open considers no trouble too
great which will please old customers and
bring in new ones.
He insists that his salesmen fehall be as
polite to a washerwoman as to the wife
of a bank president.
He does not make a hypocritical pre
tense of selling goods below cost, for ho
knows that nobody will believe that he
keeps a store for fun.
He cultivates a memory for names and
faces. He realizes how well men like to
have their identity recognized.
He is obliging in exchanging goods, and
his delivery wagons make their rounds
promptly.
If he be a grocer or a druggist he takes
pains to keep his shelves well stocked
with articles In constant demand, and
he does not try to coax patrons into pur
chases that they will regret afterward.
He does not represent to the buyer who
a.^ks for Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey that
some crude distillation, laden with fusel
oil. will answer the same purpose. The
wise merchant knnws better. He under
stands that the imitations of Duffy's
Whiskey are always worthless and some
times dangerous. He would not imperil
his reputation for fair dealing by offering:
anything instead of what the public asks
for.
The reputable dealer hands the only real
Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey over the
counter without discussion.

NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
' NEW YORK, June 13.â The slump in the j
Stock market to-day was a surprise to most
epeclative observers who looked for an ad
vance In prices after the apparent abandon
ment of last week's persistent attempt to se
cure a reaction. The underlying cause of to
day's violent decline was not very clear, and
many suggested solutions of the puzzle found
currency. Superficially there was evident some
sympathy with the dropping of the bottom out
of the wheat market, and there were very
heavy sales of securities on the New -York ex-

and the railroad companies are, of coureÂ« de
pendent for their prosperity on the prosperity
of the population they serve. Furthermore*
such a shrinkage In values as that In grain to
day involves a large liquidation of collaterals
and it was this that caused the chief damage
.to prices of stocks. Weakness permeated pretty
much the whole list, but was especially marked
In the Grangers, People's Gas and some of the
high-priced specialties. This acute wiling
pressure from Chicago Rave rise to some per
plstent reports of a pending large failure in
Chicago In the grain trade. But there was also
an Ingenious suggestion to the effect that a
large speculative combination In Chicago was
manipulating the market with a view to going
long on wheat while going short on stockÂ» on
the prospect of inevitable rumors of crop dam
age before harvest time. Damage to the crop

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June . 18.â Enormous liquidation
for Joseph Lelter caused a general rout of the
bulls In the wheat pit to-day. Weakness In
markets abroad and some Indications of grad
ually clearing weather In the West, more es
pecially In the Dakotas, Nebraska and Kan
sas, started wheat very weak. For an hour
it continued to decline, every drop of 4 cent
a bushel bringing out shoals of stop-loss or
ders. In that time. September wheat had lost
3%c of Its value, as it stood at the close of
the session Saturday. December, the next
most active delivery, declined 3%c In the same
time. The nearby deliveries, however. in
which the trading was very much smaller,
miflered severely. July dropped 7%c and June
Be. During that time it was a mere hunt for
buyers In the pit, and for a long time It was
a question as to how to get rid of wheat
rather than a question as to how much could.
be got for it. It became current gossip about
12 o'clock that Joseph Leiter had transferred
his open trades In wheat to others than the
brokers that have hitherto been doing his
trading on the floor. His trades In June, it
soon became definitely known, had been trans
ferred to Armour A Co.. and his September
trades to Lamson Bros. & Co. As that was In
terpreted as a sign of financial weakness, the
effect upon the market was very depressing
The previous decline had been so severe and
the market "bad been relieved of such a grnat
quantity of long wheat, however, ' that the
prominence that might otherwise have been
looked for at such a suggestion as the mere
possibility of Lelter being In financial diffi
culty was averted, although a further decline
was, of course, inevitable. July declined to
75c, a dror) of 11 cents compared with the
close Saturday. September fell to 69% c and
December to 69c, One of the weak factors
of the day was the utter demoralization In the
Northwest, where a combination, of which
Leiter was at the head, had been holding July
so stiffly . â  The break there was more than
doable what it was here. â  Minneapolis and
Duluth gave indications: of a panic the former
getting 21% cents below Saturday's close, and
Duluth 23 cents lower. Near : the close the
panicky . feeling here gradually wore off â  and
there was; some recovery from bottom â¢ prices.

A lICH ESTATE AT STAKE
TW) WIDOWS AND MANY CHIL
DREN INVOLVED.
A Long Struggle Is Expected
tver the Possessions of the
Late Julius L.
Franklin.
T^o petitions will be filed with the
Cou ty Clerk to-day which will Intro
due a will contest involving the diptri
but n of at least 1500,000 and the fair
nar> of Mrs. Pauline Franklin, the
wid w of Julius L. Franklin, who died
aft : a protracted illness on the 18th of
I> mber, 1597. The petitions reek with
ser-vtlonal matter. The petitioners are
Be amin J. Franklin, Mollle Wilson and
Ea * Porter, the children of Julius J..
Fr klin by a former marriage with an
In lan woman, which, according to the
al ;ations of tho petition, was never dls
60' ed or annulled. Benjamin J. Frnnk
lii is represented by Felix 11. Merzbach,
ii Ille Wilson by Julius Solomons, Jo).n
F Riley and Crlttenden Thornton of
c mael.
V will was left by Franklin and in It
1j recognized the offspring of his first
rarrlage as his own children, but they
*ere practically disinherited. To remedy
' c alleged wrong done them they have
;ow petitioned the Superior Court to re
voke the probate of the will. The second
etition Is for the removal of Mrs. Paul
ne Franklin as executrix of the estate
it the decedent for false returns In the
nventory.
About three months ago two petitions
were filed by the attorneys for the con
testing heirs which foreshadowed the
contest of to-day. At that time The Call
published exclusively a story concerning
the existence of these chlidren by the first
maniaKe, which was then generally un
known. The Indian mother had disap
peared from public ken many years ago
and there was much doubt expressed
l'Uh as to the uncertainty of her exist
ence and to the locality of her residence.
The attorneys for the petitioners now
claim that Mrs. Mary Franklin is not
only living, but that they have been in
communication with her for several
weeks, and it is their intention to in
troduce her at the trial. It will be re
membered that Mrs. Mary Franklin, the
â r of the contestants, was Julius
Frinklin's first choice as a spouse. It
a daughetr of a Chinook chief-
Bin, that captivated the susceptible
when he was a trader In furs in the
tlvated and unsettled wilds of Brit
â  Columdia.
first sensation in the contest is the
ration that Julius Franklin at the
of thÂ« making and signing of the
will w;ls of unsound mind and was mi
i mpet.-nt to make the will. The cause of
kindness is said to have been
'iisenpc, from which Franklin ha<l
red <'uring many years prior to his
o>ath, and which had, as it is averred,
akened him In mind and body, that
he was incapable of rational effort.
The second allegation in the petition is
of a more serious nature, and, if proved, i
v . make the children of the first mar- :
rhe Inw-ful heirs of the deceased. '
test reads that Julius Franklin
was married to Mary Franklinâ she with
tod of a chieftain in her veinsâ in
that the marriage was never dis-f
iied. and notwithstanding
marital obligations he willfully de
ll and abandoned her in INTO. "This j
was the time when Franklin made sucn I
Iden change in his mode of living.
He then quit the forest, the hut and the
Indian camp, surrendering the freedom of
his open-air life for commercial pursuits
in Portland. With him he took his three
childrenâ Lena Franklin, Benjamin J.
Franklin and Mollle Franklinâ and the
rudiments of an education were
' them. The mother remained sur- '
rounded by the scenes of h<-r native heath
and the people of her tribe. Latterly she
drifted to Portland, where she now lives.
The marriage of Julius L. Franklin and
â¢ Fnmkiin is spoken of in the con- S
La a pretended one. It recites how ,
â â 'I, leaving his wife in igno- i
ranee of his own and his children's where- I
abouts, contracted another marriage. He'
then established a new home, to which he
brought the offspring of his union with
his first wife.
.As The petition reads, they were treated i
with great kindness until the birth of
the first child of this second marriage,
when a course of discrimination in favor :
of her own child was begun by Mrs. Paul
ine Franklin.
It is claimed that this 111 treatment
continued until the mind of the father
was poisoned against the children of the
flrÂ«t union and his affections alienau-d
from them; that by means of a constant
srrjent the father was led to believe
that they were nndutiful. rebellious dls
obedient and lacking In filial affection.
Another Bensational charge in the peti
tion is ihut Mrs. Pauline Franklin re
peatedly threatened in the presence of
Mollle Wilson, one of the petitioners, that
if Bhe could help it. the latter would
- Inherit a dollar of her father's
money. All this oppression and opposi
tion, as staied in the papers to he Hied
â¢. culminated In the election of Mol
lle Wiison from her fa.aer's home. The
father was thereafter oollged to see his
daughter in secret, which he did on sev
eral occasions, confessing to her h in
ability to alter the condition of affairs
It is charged that all this expressed an
tipathy on the part of Mrs. Pauline
Franklin â¢â â â  by her desira to pre
<he heirs of Julius Franklin by his
first wife from inheriting any of their
father*
The second petition Is for the removal
of Mrs. Pauline Franklin as executrix.
In February of this year Mrs. Pauline
Franklin ss executrix named in the last
will and testament of Julius Franklin re
turned an inventory which showed an
of S2M3 In value. This the peti
r; assert is ridiculous, that the es
tate left by the deceased was at least a
half million dollars. It is alleged that
various largo interests in commercial en
terprises are not mentioned In the in
ventory at all. No accounting of the In
terests of Julius L. Franklin in the busi
f Franklin A Metzger is mentioned
and various other concerns In which
Franklin was known to have been a
partner.
With the filing of these two petitions a
legal war has begun for the effects of the
man. Which Mrs. Franklin the law
will uphold is a a matter of time and
Judicial ascertainment.

CHIEF LEES
AS A JURIST
Passes on the Validity
of an Ordinance.
WILL NOT ENFORCE IT
REFUSES ASSISTANCE TO THE
LICENSE COLLECTOR.
He Will Not Arrest Offenders Who
Violate the Law Which
Regulates Chinatown
Guides.
The recently enacted ordinance requir
ing all Chinatown guides to pay a quar
terly license of $10 Is being openly violat
ed. The attention of Chief of Police Leea
has been called to the matter, but he re
fuses to act or lend any assistance to
License Collector Bonnet. Chief I^ees is
jealous of the record Bonnet has made
since he has been In the license office.
Bonnet succeeded Fred Lees, a son of
Chief Lees, and In consequence the of-
flee is being made to suffer. Since the
day Bonnet assumed charge of the office
he has not received any assistance from
the police department. While Fred Lees
was License Collector he had all the po
lice assistance he wanted, but Bonnet's
requests axe ignored.
Bonnet was instrumental in securing
' the passage of the law to protect strang
ers from being robbed and swindled by
opium fiends and vagrants, who infest
Chinatown and pose as guides. Upon the
payment of the license each guide is
given a number that he must expose on
his shield. If any complaint of extortion
or misbehavior is reported the license of
ficials know who the offender Is and he is
refused a renewal of his license at the
end of the quarter. The respectable
guides who pay the license are now bit
terly complaining because the law is not
enforced. Opium fiends and vagrants
continue to act as guides and are safe
from police interference.
Chief Lees will not assist in enforcing the
law because he believes It unconstitu
tional. It has generally been believed
that the duty o*. ne Police Department
was to enforce the laws as enacted and
allow the courts to pass on the question
of their constitutionality. Chief L.?es in
the present instance lias assumed the
right to pass on the ordinance ana his
decision Is that it is unconstitutional. Ex-
Judge D.J. Murphy differs, however, from
the learned Chief. When Bonnet com
menced the enforcement of the ordinance
Judge Murphy was retained to make a
test case. After a thorough considera
tion of the ordinance he gave the opinion
that it was perfectly constitutional and
that it would be a useless waste of time
to appeal to the Superior Court from a
verdict of conviction rendered in the
Police Court against one of the offenders.
Judge Murphy with his years of experi
ence, both as a practitioner. District At
torney and Superior Judge, is overruled
in his opinion by the senile Chief. There
is one consolation, however, and that is
that Chief Lees will shortly give way to a
Buccespor, who will be content with the
enforcement of the laws ana not set him
self up also as judge and jury.
"I know that some of the licensed
guides are complaining that the law is
not rigidly enforced, " said Bonnet, "and '
I am sorry to have to say that such Is
the fact. The Police Department will not
render me any assistance, and it is impos
sible for me to catch all the offenders.
When the law went into existence fifteen
of the guides came forward and paid their
licenses. I detailed two of my deputies to
go into the Chinese quarter at night and ,
cause the arrest of any and all guides
who had not taken out licenses. We ar
rested about a dozen of them. They
were all convicted and after paying their
fines took out licenses. We nave thirty
six guides now who are paying the license
and four more of them have filed appli
cations for permits.
"If Chief Lees would only condescend
to assist in carrying out the law it would
not take long to round up all the offend- :
ers. But that he won't do. He will not :
give me any assistance. He won't even
Instruct the patrolmen to arrest the of

my deputies. I have two deputies in
Chinatown until 1 o'clock every morning,
and if they see a guide who has not a :
license, they ask the policemen to arrest.
him. The Invariable answer iÂ« 'You will
have to get a warrant.' I went to Chlei
Leea to ask him for assistance. The an
â wer he gave me was that the violation i
of the ordinance was only a misdemeanor |
and that a policeman had no authority j
to make an arrest for misdemeanor un- i
less the offense was committed in his (
presence. I would like to understand just
what the learned Chief understands by !
presence. If one of my deputies calls the
attention of a patrolman to a guide es- i
corting a party through the quarter, and j
that the guide is unable to show a license i
when asked for it by the patrolman, I
think the misdemeanor comes pretty close '
to being committed in his presence. The j
Chief has some peculiar ideas, however, i
and a peculiar way of doing things. Why
he should take upon himself the respon- [
slbility of passing on the constitutionality j
of the ordinance is something- I cannot
understand. I am seriously handicapped
by the refusal of the Chief to lend me i
needed aid in enforcing the law, but I
Will continue on, doing the best I can
under the circumstances. I trust and
hope that the new chief, whoever he ]
may be, will show more consideration for |
the license office than does Chief Lees." |
"I think the law is unconstitutional," I
said Chief Lees, when questioned about
the matter, "but still If the License Col
lector swears out warrants against the
delinquent guides I will have them
served."
Refused to Testify.
As was expected, the cases of John
Joseph Sehl of Seattle and Charles Ham
mersmith, charged with shooting at each
other at 242 Post street, were dismissed
by Judge Mogan yesterday. Suhl was
put on the Btand and refused to testify
against Hammersmith, and Hammersmith
followed suit when asked to testify
against Sehl.

MURDERER BOWLES
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY
UKIAII, June 13.â Patrick Bowles, who
shot and killed his brother-in-law, C. S.
De Spain, and fatally wounded James
Sklffington near Comptehe yesterday, has
been arrested. He was found at the
house of a friend near the scene of the
double homicide. #
Further particulars of the crime were
received here to-day. There was a dance
at Peterson's Hotel on Saturday night,
and Bowles, De SpaJn and Skifflngton at
tended. At the supper table Bowles and
Skifflngton got into an altercation and
they left the dining-room to fight It out.
In the hallway Bowles struck at Skifflng
ton with one hand and drew a revolver
with the other. De Spain attempted to
prevent Bowles from uning the weapon,
but Bowles llred, the ball striking Skif
flnjrton near the heart. Bowles wheeled
and fired at De Spain, inflicting a wound
that proved fatal within five minutes.
Bowles and his wife have been at
Bwords' points for some time, and De
Spain took sides with his sister Un

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» CalL
WITH THE FLEET OFF SAN
TIAGO, Wednesday, June 8 (via
Kingston, Jamaica, June 9. Delayed in
transmission.)â $200,000
worth of ammunition was expended on
Monday's bombardment, but apparent
ly it has not checked Spanish activity
on the earthworks.
On Monday afternoon the lookout men
| on the Brooklyn saw a boat approach-
I ing from a point about four miles west
of El Morro. The Vixen went out to
meet it and brought to the flagship
three insurgents, who asked for a ves
sel to shell a Spanish fort with which
the insurgents were then engaged near
i the shore.
The Marblehead, which had been do
: ing target practice, was sent on this
i mission and soon scattered the Span
j lards, with the result that the insur
i gents captured the Spanish camp, the
| tents and a quantity of ammunition.
I One of the Marblehead's shells killed
! a Spanish captain and a lieutenant,
i fatally wounded a surgeon and in
! jured several soldiers.
While the work of arming and feed
: ing the insurgents is pushed vigorously
j the Spaniards in Santiago are reported
! suffering from an incipient famine, and
! a Cuban officer off shore yesterday as
serted that the guerrillas were deserting
in force to the insurgents. Yesterday
I Lieutenant Commander Delehanty,
; with the gunboat Suwanee, armed 3000
i Cubans with rifles, ammunition and
â¢ machetes. To-day he landed 3000 rr t fles,
i 30,000 rounds of ammunition, a large
i consignment of machetes, a quantity
; of medicine and several tons of bread
I and bacon.
The Cubans are very active, express
ing the greatest confidence and prom
: ising to maintain a close blockade of
I Santiago on the land side. The in
surgents represent their number as
- rapidly increasing. Certainly they have
shown their ability in the neighborhood
: of Guantanamo, where they have got
possession of the railway and telegraph
; terminus.
The insureents say they watched
Monday's bombardment from the hills
at the rear of Santiago and that as
many as 300 Spaniards were killed and
several guns dismounted. Terrible ex
ecution was wrought by the 12-inch
shells of the Texas. If their statement
can be relied on the Spanish garrison at
Santiago is on half rations and the
town itself is even much worse off. the
military authorities refusing to sell cit
izens provisions at any price.
On Sunday night, June 5, Ensign
Palmer took the New York's launch on
harbor picket duty and another launch
was sent from the Oregon. Ensign
Palmer was obliged to go wlthip 150
yards of the batteries. The Spaniards
opened a heavy fire, but Palmer kept
his position, regardless of the shells.
His orders were not to go nearer than
a mile from shore. Ensipn Palmer and
the crew got back safely. When Ad
miral Sampson heard of the shooting
he said to Palmer:
"You were ordered not to go nearer
shore than a mile."
"Those were my orders." replied
Ensign Palmer, "but sir, I was also
told to see that no torpedo boats came
out. With only two boats I could not
be sure that none came out unless I
went right under the batteries."
The admiral replied: "You were per
fectly right, Mr. Palmer. That's the
kind of stuff of which officers of the
UniteQ States are made."

COLONEL FINIGAN
ACCUSED OF PERJURY
Warrant Issued for the ex-Turfman's
Arrest at the Instance of
His Wife.
BAN RAPAEIv, June 13.â A warrant was
Issued to-day for the arrest of Colonel P.
A. Finipan, the "millionaire pauper," on
a charge of perjury. The colonel's wife,
who is suing him for divorce and alimony,
is the complainant. Finigan was In San
Francisco and the warrant was put into
the hands of an official, to be served as
soon as possible.
The complaint alleges that on May 17,
1897, the defendant appeared before At
torney J. \V. Cochrane, a notary public,
and swore in his petition to be adjudged
an Insolvent debtor; thai he was indebted
to C. C. Bemis, the San Francisco capital
ist, in the sum of $7000 borrowed money;
"whereas, in truth and in fact," reads the
document, "the said Peter A. Finigan
was not then or there or at any time in
debted to said C. C. Bemis in the sum of
seven thousand dollars or In any other
sum for money borrowed or upon any
Other account whatsoever."
To-day the Finigan case came up be
fore Judge Angellotti in another form,
that of. a hearing on Finigan's petition to
be released from further insolvency pro

insolvent ten days in which to file his an
swer to the opposition of creditors.

Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 13.
The regular meeting of the directors of
the Blind Home will be held to-morrow
night and there will be a vacant chair.
This vacant chair is causing considerable
anxiety to gome of the employes of the
institution, while Superintendent Jack
Hays does not feel any too comfortable.
Colonel Smith of the First Callornla
Volunteers, which is now about half way
to Manila, was a director of the Home
for Adult Blind, and it is not known
whether Governor Budd will appoint a
successor to him or not. In fact, the
Governor has not yet given any intima
tion that he has recognized there is an
actual vacancy. The present members
are John R. Glascocl:. Colonel James,
Attorney Shaw and H. O. Trowbridge,
who will take his seat for the first time
to-morrow. Colonel Smith is out of the
State and did not, so far as Is known,
make any arrangement regarding his of
fice during hie absence. If anything has
been done in the matter it is not known
to Superintendent Hays. As the position
of superintendent as of all other em
ployes depends on the votes of three of
the five directors, and as Mr. Trowbridge
will take his seat to-morrow, the pros
pects of there being still another director
Is one possessing great interest.
Mr. Hays Is of the opinion that the
Governor should not appoint a successor
to Colonel Smith, believing that his show
of patriotism In taking service in the na
tional army deserves all possible cour
tesy. The superintendent does not think
that Governor Budd will make another
appointment.
The business of the Blind Home, how
ever, is large and requires close personal
attention on the part of the directors. It
is a State institution, annually disburs
ing a large sum of State money. Under
these circumstances it is not considered
improbable that the Governor may deem
it necessary to appoint a full board and
take proper means to show Colonel Smith
that naming his successor was no dis
courtesy. As no one can tell how long
the volunteers may remain away, it is
more than likely that a new director will
be commissioned.

Eva: Every afternoon about 5 o'clock I begin to gape and
yawn and I yawn and gape and yawn till bed-time. If
I nip one yawn in the bud the next follows almost im-
mediately and is bound to be a regular jaw-breaker.
May: I had such an experience myself one time, and I re.
member asking the doctor whether one should try
to keep from yawning, and he said no, that the act of
gaping gives to the blood more oxygen and acts by
mechanical pressure on the heart and lungs. If one
has chronic gaping it is a symptom which should cause
the affected one to look after her general health, for
it is a sure sign that something is wro'jg.
MRS. MOORE : It is pretty well understood that yawning is an
ailment that comes from indigestion or lack of tone in
the system and may be cured by taking a Ripans
Tabule before retiring. After a few days of this treat-
ment the tendency will disappear.

BEER RIVER
WILL RUN LOW
Schooners Must Be of
Lighter Draught.
PACTOLIA'. STREAM DAMMED
WAR TAXES WILL MAKE MEN
MORE TEMPERATE.
Brewers and Tobacco Manufacturers
Notified by Collector Lynch.
That the Tax Begins
To-Day.
When the news came that President ;
McKinley had signed the war revenue i
bill yesterday afternoon there was a sen
sation principally in beer and tobacco
Some retailers of the nectar of
Gambrinus immediately placed orders for
new glasses cf smaller canbnr than those ]
then in use, in order to cut down the |
quantity of steam sold in schooners to a I
war footing, and the time of fighting will i
soon be indeed a time of thirst. In some '
resorts small caliber glasses were put In \
use yesterday, and they were a decided ;
disappointment to the beer-drinking pub- )
lie, for they are Disproportionately small ;
and will meet not only the war tax of a â 
dollar a barrel but enough more to pay |
ior a good free lunch thrown In.
Other beer retailers nave retained the old
schooners so dear to the sight of the
thirsty patrons, with glass bottoms weigh
ing about a pound and a half, and thick
all over in proportion. It Is a variety of
faith schooner, for the holder of it be
lieves that he Is getting a great Quantity ,
of the rt-iidish brown fluid which neither j
cheers nor intoxicates â much. In order
to meet the tax the head of foam In the :
glass, or the white military collar as it Is
called. Is higher than ever, and is known
as the maior's collar.
Cigars will be made smaller, and plug
CO will be no longer of the dimen- j
â iona of a brick. While it may not be ad
\isable to increase the retail price of the
articles toe revenue on which will have j
the honor of paying the expenses of the
Bpanish war. the quantity In the beer I
s or the tobacco bag may be les- I
sened. which will be equivalent to a les- j
sened consumption of the taxed articles.
â¢ nal Revenue Collector Lynch and !
his office were as busy as bees yester- I
day afternoon in notifying the dealers
and manufacturers thnt the bill would go

SENT TO PRISON FOR LIFE.
Theodore Park Haynes Sentenced by
Judge Wallace â Murderer De
nounces His Counsel.
Theodore Park Haynes, the aged slayer
of Police TJrutenant Burke, was sen
tenced to Imprisonment for life at Fol
fom by Judge Wallace yesterday. J. N.
E. Wilson, who represented the convict,
made' a motion for a new trial on statu
tory grounds. The court denied the mo
tfon, and then Judge Wallace, turning to
the prisoner, asked him if he had any
thing to say prior to the passing of sen
tence. Haynes arose and with tremulous
voice denounced his counsel, whom he
. charped with having neglected his case.
."They did not summon the witnesses I
wanted," he said. "All they did was to
obtain 'money by false pretenses." The
argument had little effect on the court, as
â¢oma.such outbreak had been expected
from the murderer, and sentence was then
passed.
On motion of Attorney Wilson a stay of
five days was p-.-anted the defendant in
order that h* might be taken to the
shanty In whlcn he lived to enable him to
gather up such articles as he considers of
value.
AGAINST CHINESE LABOR.
Efforts +o Have Soldiers' Uniforms
Made by Free White People.
Shortly after It became known that
Chinese were employed In the making of
uniforms for the soldiers who have been
called to the front. Labor Commissioner
E. L. Fitzgerald at the request of the
Tvorking men and women of this city sent
letters to several of the Pacific Coast
representatives at Washington asking
them to do all in their power to induce
the War Department to give the work to
white people. Yesterday he received the
following answers:
Dear Sir: Judge Mag-ulre has just sent me
your note of the 25th ult. regarding the em
ployment of Chinese labor, etc., in the manu
facture of clothing for our troops. I fully
agree with you, although If we are to annex
the Philippines, etc.. It Is hardly necessary to
make any serious kick, for we might as well
get ready for the future. However, holding the
views that I do upon all these subjects. I have
been able to vigorously protest against the em
ployment of such labor. There can be but one
Justification for It, viz.: the necessity of pre
paring the troops for the field, and I think you
have shown that there In nothing In that
claim, and your plain way of putting it ought
to help our people materially. Yours very
truly, STEPHEN M. WHITE.
TROOPSHIPS READY
TO PUT TO SEA
WILL MOVE TO MISSION BAY
TO-DAY.
A Dearth of Steamers Suitable to Tow
All the River Boats That Have
Been Built to the Yukon.
i
Everybody connected with the trans
ports China, Colon, Zealandia and Senator
will be glad when the sun sets to-night
, and the vessels are out In the stream.
The troops are to be marched to Broad
way wharf, where the Senator is lying.
Pacific street wharf where the Zealandia
is ready to go to sea and the Mall dock
where the finishing touches are being put
on the China and Colon, during the day
and as soon as the men are on board the
lines will be cast off and under their own
'â  steam the fleet will move down to Mission
! Bay, where they will anchor until the
; sailing hour.
On the China the question of a Caucas
ian or Mongolian crew in the engine room I
!is still being agitated. Yesterday several
i members of the trades unions were work
: ing In the matter trying to get the Gov- |
! ernment to send out white coal-passers ,
aiid firemen in place of the Chinese, but ;
with very little success. Captain Bea
liury openly favors the coolies. "The last
time we experimented with white lire
men," said he yesterday, "nearly all of I
them came aboard drunk ami we had |
[ half of them in irons for the nrst twenty
! four hours. The Chinese may not be as
good workers as the white men, but they
ure faithful."
Of the fleet that is to follow the China,
Colon, Zealandia and Senator little is j
known as to when It will get away. The i
City of Para is on the drydock and after :
being overhauled will go to the Mail dock ,
to be fitted out for the voyage to Manila. I
The Morgan City went on ttie California !
drydock yesterday ami as soon as she is
overhauled she will go to either Lombard |
street wharf or section 4 of the sea wall. |
The Ohio and lndia.ua will be accom
modated in the neighborhood of the Mor
gan City. The work of getting her ready |
will be rushed and If all goes well they |
may be ready to sail about the Mth inst.
"The Government has been making a j
great mistake in sending these vessels ,
away in bunches," said a well-known j
shipping man yesterday. "The Zealandia
could have sailed several days ago and j
she should have been dispatched at once. |
There Is only one wharf at Honolulu I
available for the transports to coal at.
Now If they go In a body each one has |
to wait on the other, whereas if the Zea
landia had sailed two or three days ago
she could have been coaled and out of the
way when tl.e China arrived. The next I
in would proV-ably be tne Senator and as i
soon as she was coaled the Colon would
Ibe the only vessel to wait for. By work
ing it in that way the troops would reach
Manila a week "earlier and Uncle Sain
would be a great saver on the item of ex- |
penses."
The bookmakers and gamblers who j
dally visit the Sausaiito poolrooms were
very much disgusted yesterday. In order
to get across the bay in good time the i
bookmakers guaranteed the North Paci- |
fie Coast Company $nO a day for a 12:30 j
p. m. boat. This has been running for |
a few weeks, but yesterday the JM guar- j
antee was not forthcoming, and President ;
Stetson at once ordered the boat taken
off. The order was issued at 11:30 a. m., !
and an hour later when the gamblers I
showed up there was no boat. There was
between thirty and forty of them, and
the railroad company was caJled Borne
hard names. Finally the tug Millie was
secured, and the entire party was taken
to Sausalito at 50 cents a head. The tak- ]
ing off of the 12:30 boat will be a big i
blow at the poolrooms as there is no boat
between 11:30 and l:4f> p. m.
Captain Howard of the Oceanic Steam
ship Company has been appointed su
pervising inspector of Government trans
ports. He will officially examine the
China, Colon, Senator and Zealandia be
fore they leave for Manila.
The ship Sterling, which left San Fran
cisco April 27 for the salmon canneries |
in Southwestern Alaska, was totally |
! wrecked in Bristol Bay on May 20. The i
following account of the disaster is from I
i a private letter dated Nushagak, May I
23: "We were shipwrecked last Friday, j
The Sterling struck on a bar In Bristol
; Bay and sank to her second deck. She
; had fifteen feet of water in her when the
| captain left her. All hands and the grub
[ and clothes were saved. The Sterling has :
I gone to her gTave with ibO tons of coal, |
57.000 empty cases for the canneries and
pome machinery aboard. She struck in
three fathoms of water and lies in two
fathoms at low water. Captain Anderson
was not to blame as the charts show from
â¢ seven to ten fathoms of water where she .
, struck.
"The vessel had 142 Chinese and seven
: teen sailors, besides th-. captain, first and
i second mates, carpenter, cook, cabin buy
â  and the writer aboard, and they all grot
off without any trouble. The ship struck
about 5 a. m. Friday. The crew and pas
sengers had nearly 100 miles to go over
land to catch the steamer President to
continue the trip, and- some of the men
1 suffered from the cold. The steamers
President and Polar Bear went to the
wreck and saved what provisions they
could, but that was not much, as the
ship was breaking up."
There will be an exodus of river boats
for the Yukon during the next few weeks,
: and there will have to be some hard
; work done to secure proper steamers to
1 tow them. The Rideout went out in tow
of the Tillamonk. and the tug Rescue
took out the James Eva. while to-morrow
! the Dirigo starts oni with the City of
; Dawfion in tow. The latter vessel belongs
: to the Alaska Transportation Company
while the Diripo is under charter to the
California-Alaska Navigation Company.
j The combination name about through the
I delay in finishing: the transportation com-
I pany's steamer Aloha. As soon a* she Is
! ready to sail she will tow the California-
Alaska Company's river steamer Queen
of the Yukon to St. Michael.
Information has be'en received by the
1 Oceanic Steamship Company from the
: Postofflce Depart mr-nt that the mails for
dispatch by the Moana to Australian
ports will arrive tv-re at 5:45 tomorrow
evening, and the steamer will, therefore
sail at 10 p. m., Instead of 2 p. m.. as
! heretofore announced.

Later she was sent to the City and Coun

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 14, 1898.
A CINCH IN
BALL PARKS
Central and Recreation
Controlled.
NEW PARK TO BE BUILT
A WEALTHY PROPERTY-OWNER
INTERESTED.
Trouble Still Continues to Be a
Feature of All League Meetings,
Notwithstanding Other
Reports.
BY JOE CORBETT.
Despite the fact that appearances
would indicate the relations existing be
tween the proprietors of Recreation Park
and the managers of the various teams
as being of a very pleasant nature, dis
sension and dissatisfaction have sprung
up between them very recently which
bid fair to terminate in the formation
of a new and independent league.
The trouble originated at a meeting of
the league representatives, held some few
weeks ago, and since that time has
gained such gigantic proportions that an
I open rebellion of the managers against
President Bert, Air. McNeil, who controls
Central Park and the Sixteenth md Fol
som street grounds, and Mr. Raver, who
| controls Recreation Park may be expect
led at any moment. It appears that an
: agreement had been made when the two
; leagues consolidated to the effect that
I should Recreation Park, after a fair trial,
i prove to be a frost, the games were to
be transferred to Central Park. It was
decided among the managers that a
change waa expedient, and so at a meet
ing of the board it was proposed that
Central Park be given a chance.
To the surprise of all It was learned
that Mr. McNeil had no time for base
ball, which when translated means that
! the proprietors of the only desirable base
ball parks in the city had combined and
that the teams must play at Recreation
| Park or not play at all.
Such is the difficutly confronting the
; poor, trapped managers vet they are not
Idle. Among them are a few who propose
1 seeing this thing to the bitter end, and
ilf necessary will withdraw from the
I league.
I learned at a meetinp of the league of
. flclals last night that a new and beautl-
I ful ball park Is to be constructed, front
ing on one of the principal street car
lines. The gentleman who owns the prop
| erty has signified his willingness to ex
pend hundreds of dollars in making the
I grounds the be.st in America, and If an
j agreement is not reached very soon be
' tween the league magnates baseball will
I again pass into oblivion, only however
1 until the new grounds are completed.
It certainly is to be regretted that after
; so much wrangling before the consollda
j tlon a new trouble maker should step in,
' just when things were about on a substan
i tial footing. The combining of forces
j will, I am afraid, prove a death blow to
baseball on the coast. People are sick
and tired of all this wrangling, and It
j would be well for that "combine" to heed
, the cry.
Then again It would be well for them to
' realize the danger of great opposition, for
I a new and grand park is soon going up,
I where players and managers will have an
I equal chance and the avaricious none.
His Wandering Boy.
The father of Robert McCarthy, 812
Page street, reported at police headquar
ters yesterday afternoon that his son had
stolen $25 from him and had gone away
with another boy, probably to the coun
try to pick fruit. Robert Is 11 years of
age and of dark complexion. The police
have been notified to be on the lookout
for him.
In the Divorce Courts.
Lizzie Hempstead was granted a divorce
from Frank C. Hempstead on the ground
of extreme cruelty yesterday. Cornelia
Kohlsaat was granted a decree of divorce
by Judge Hebbard from her husband,
Cecelio Kohlsaat, on the ground of ex
treme cruelty. The defendant was or
dered to pay Mrs. Kohlsaat alimony In
the sum of $20 a month.

new headquarters, at 2ti Goa.ry street.
Charles S. Forbes called the meeting to
order and fifteen out of the eighteen
members answered the rollcall. After
the adoption of a sot of by-laws to gov
ern the organization Thomas B. O'Brien
read the following address to the voters
of the city:
As we look backward to the channels of po
litical history 1" this city we may easily
observe the tide miirks of public opinion pro

conservative, thoughtful and reading class of
citizens who constitute the Republican party
within th ih county are vehemently demanding
that the mercenary iÂ»illtical boss, for revenue
only, must be eliminated from the control of
the party upon Whose muster rolls are em
blazoned the Immortal names of Lincoln,
Grant, Gartield, Hayes, Harrison, MeKlnley
and Rlalne.
The time is opportune for the Citizens' Re

Itching
Scalp Humors
Cutioura Works Wonders in
Cleansing the Scalp and Re-
storing the Hair.
I waa suffering tortures from a diseased
scalp. I was scratching my head from morn-
ing till night. Little pimples broke out all
over my bead. I bad no rest. I got a cake of
CunccÃA Soap and a box of Cutioura (oint-
ment). I washed my head about once a week
with hot water and Coticuha Soap, and then
applied the CrmccÃA (ointment) as a dress-
ing. I only used one box of ointment and
one cake of soap, to be cured. Now, my head
hasn't a pimple on it, and my hair Is growing
splendidly. ADA C. HARRELL,
Feb. 21, 1898. 330 Grand St., Jersey City, N. J.
I was troubled with dandruff so that it made
my hair fall out so bad, I got discouraged. I
purchased abox of (ointment) and a
cake of Cutioura Soap. The formor I rubbed
well into the scalp twice a week, and then
sham i with warm water and a good lather
of Cuticcra Soap once a week. My hair is
growing out thick once more, and free from
terrible dandruff. Miss ADA JAYES,
Feb. 30, '98. 82 Webster Aye., Chelsea, Macs.
I had a bad scalp humor, and thought I
would go frantic with itching. I lost consid-
erable of my hair (of which I had an abun-
dance, and waa very proud). I tried several
remedies but they failed. I tried Cuticuka
Soap, relief immediate, and itching is com.
pletely gone. ' Mrs. M. JUDAN,

In any community, those who turn the scales
In political contests are not greedy and selfish.
They do not vote merely for personal reasons.
They are Interested In men and methods. In
principles and policy, In peace and prosperity.
In a government for and by the people. It
Is equally false to assume that all political
workers are actuated only by selfish motives.
Political workers are not to be classed as bum
mers and leeches, for among them can be
found no more devoted or unselfish In the cause
of religion, philanthropy or education. If
there Is any reproach to make It Is not upon
men who fulfill their political duties In cau
cuses, oonunlttee-ropnii In a convention, on the
platform, at the polls, but for those who
are too iiuiifferent or too selfish to discharge
them. In his address upon the field of Gettys
burg, Abraham Lincoln said: We are resolved
that these dead shajl not have died In vain,
that the nation under God have a new birth
of freedom and that government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the people shall not
perish (rum the earth. If the party, locally,
have been led away from these principles It
Is the duty of those whose words may Influence
to lead It hack to the Magna Charta of self
jrnvernment. To the Republican party In this
city there have flocked, during the past few
years, many birds of evil omen, undesirable
tenants, who are making the house f>o fnul
thnt they are driving out the rightful owners.
Theseundesirnble acquisitions the masses of the
rarty would only be too glad to get rid of for
the party's good. To the man of Impartial mind
there Is scarcely an Imperceptible difference be
tween the integrity of the plain people in one
party or another. A wise, sagacious, political
leader should ever aim to prove to them, the
plain people, that whatever policy he may coun
sel. It should be from the highest motive of dis
interested Justice, and that under no consider
ation should he evince a vulgar greed to rob
his neighbors or seize their property. I'nder
Democratic boss rule taxpayers of the eountv
cower beneath the menace of Its Intolerable
lash.
The phenomenal corruption of the Boards of
Supervisors and Education, which has depleted
the working funds of both those departments
Is a hideous ppecter in the public eye. The
citizens and taxpayers cry aloud for redress
and gaze with alarm upon their lamentable
condition under the regime of so-called Demo
cratic reform. The Justice of their complaint
has no standing In the council of the rulers ap
proved by themselv<* at the ballot box. The
chain of unbroken evidence of Democratic mis
rule In nation. Ptate and county, wherever and
whenever that party has been intrusted to gov
ern for the past thirty years. Is visibly distinct
in the records of history. I^ike vice, '-It Is a
monster of such frightful mien, that to be hated
needs but to be seen." A detailed narrative of
its Infamous record, under the present municipal
government, would be dull, nauseating and
languid reading, and, like threshing old straw,
produce no material result because the press of
both parties has repeatedly excoriated the mal
administration of the present incumbents In
office. The patient Is terribly afflicted. What
Is the remedy? The Citizens' Republican party
saw the evil and prescribed a soothing tonic In
Its platform to alleviate the Intense fever In
the. public pulse: "We denounce the attempt
of any one man, be he millionaire or pauper,
to hold the Republican party in the hollow of
his hand, to control Its organization or ac
tions and to dictate Its nominations. Self-inter
est Is a dangerous level to be applied in the
conduct of political affairs. Every Republican
has a right to a vote In the councils of the
party, and while we recognize the desirability
and, indeed, the necessity of able leadership,
we declare no organization can or should exist
under the self-will domination of any single
Individual. Such attempts have prior to this
campaign failed." We reiterate and adhere to
those principles to-day. Eliminate the vulgar
mercenary boss who is ever the obsequious
crawling sychopant and slave of corporation
money, then and not until then will the people
govern themselves. The Citizens' Republican
committee vows Its undying hostility to all
political Hessians of the Kelly sans culotte
type and counsels him not to Intrude Into the
councils of decent Republicans, but. like the
cobbler, stick to his last, pursue his latest pro
fession â that Is, a broker for the evicted deni
zens of Qulncy street.
Chairman Forbes then announced the
following committees:
Financeâ A. G. Knight, Arthur Spear,
T. B. O'Brien, G. W. Bayreuther and J.
F. Crowley.
Executive committee-^M. W. Coffey, O.
W. Bayreuther, T. B. O'Brien. J. J.
Nicholson, John Gardner, Samuel Bruns
wick. J. J. McCarthy, Bert Wren, D. J.
O'Brien and John S. Parry.
The committee then adjourned until
next Monday evening. After the meeting
the executive committee held a short ses
sion and elected M. W. Coffey chairman
and John S. Parry secretary.
TEACHERS WILL BE PAID.
All Outstanding Demands Passed,
but There Will Be Money.
There was a special meeting of tho
School Board yesterday for the purpose
of passing demands which â would other
wise be in danger of going over Into the
next fiscal year and thereby adding to the
list of municipal creditors who have
been loÃers on contracts that went be
yond the one-twelfth act.
The list of - demands amounted to
$7726 27, and after come objections from
members of the board the full amount
was passed. Included in the amount waa
an item of $720 which represented the
salaries of lumber experts, three of them
at $10 a day, and this was stricken out
of the budget in the first consideration
and was then passed by special motion, so
it all went anyway, and by to-morrow the
creditors can draw their money.
As soon as the creditors nave been
paid the teachers' warrants will be issued,
and as the treasurer has announced that
he will borrow from the other funds to
make up the deficit in the salary fund,
the teachers will be able to collect at
once, instead of having to wait as waa
the expectation.
During the meeting Mr. Hammond com
mented upon Mr. Waller and that gentle
man resented it, and personalities passed
between tho directors until Mr. Gallagher,
who was in the chair, called order with
his gavel. It was feared there would be
a fight, so the board adjourned to com
mittee of the whole and in privacy the
directors discussed the various items.
After twenty minutes they all came out
smiling and everything went through
without trouble.
The only demand now outstanding is
that of the superintendent of the Mission j
High School, and as there is no money
in that fund and his is not a statutory
office there will have to be some ma
neuvering before ho can legally collect.
ABTJSED HIS WIFE.
Mrs. Besorde Severely Beaten by Her
Brutal Husband.
Mrs. Besorde, living at 674 Bryant
street, was attacked by her husband, who
is a fruit dealer, last night and severely
injured. The unfortunate woman says
that she waa preparing supper when her
husband entered the house, and after
calling her several vile names struck her
in the face, knocking her against a table
He then seized her by the throat and
flung her against the stove, severely
bruising her arm. The injured woman
was taken to the Receiving Hospital
where her arm was dressed by Dr v'
Timothy Fitzgibbon. * '"â¢

THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUKE 14, IS9B.
THE DAY AND THE FLAG.
This Is the Birthday of Old Glory and San
Francisco Should Remember It
To-day will be sacred to the American flap, not only all over the United States and wherever Americans live
but particularly In San Francisco. It Is the one hundred and twenty-first anniversary of the birth of Old Glory
This city is noted for its liberality and patriotism. There Is not anywhere else a monument to Francis Scott
Key, the immortal author of the "Star-spangled Banner." The foresight and patriotism of the late James Lick gave
Golden Gate Park the beautiful monument to the author of our great national song. The monument was made In
Europe at a cost of nearly $100,000.
It Is fit that the city where this monument exists, the city where dwells Emma Frances Dawson, author of
"Old Glory," and the city where thousands of soldiers now debouch upon the avenues and camp upon the tented
fields should rejoice that the stars and stripes float over the homes of freemen.
Every house in San Francisco should be decorated to-day with a flag or flags. Every citizen who can afford to
buy the national emblem should wear one somewhere on his coat, and the young should be told the story of the flag
the history of American heroism and the principles of free government.
It was on June 14, 1777, that Congress decreed that this nation, then but a babe among nations should have a
flag of Its own. Pince that time Immortal glory has gathered about the stars and stripes, and deeds of heroism
have made it respected wherever liberty exists.
As early as 1776 Washington displayed a flag, which was the Union Jack, with stripes representing the colonies
while nearly every colony had a flag of its own. But after Congress adopted the flag no other colors were seen In the
land of the free and the home of the brave.
Representative men, from the Governor of the State down to those known specially in San Francisco have in
dorsed The Call's Idea that the day should be universally respected as the birthday of the flap Schools will have
special exercises, the monument of the author of "The Star-spangled Banner" will be draped with flags and em
bellished with flowers, and throughout the city there will be countless evidences that the masses remember the emblem
of their country's freedom and glory.
MAYOR PHELAN ISSUES A CALL TO CITIZENS,
San Francisco should celebrate the anniversary of the flag and
thus maintain her reputation for loyalty and patriotism. The national
anthem is the ''Star-Spangled Banner,' 1 and I do not know that any
other American city contains a monument to its author, Francis Scott
Key. Living in our midst is Emma Frances Dawson, the author of r 'old
Glory, ' ' and to-day the city contains an army ready and eager to carry
the flag to the remotest country where duty calls. Therefore, this is
a singularly appropriate place and time to celebrate the anniversary.
No proclamation has been issued calling upon the people to celebrate,
so what is done must be done spontaneously, and every citizen of his
own motion should wear the flag and display it from his house or place
of business .

Rooker and Brown while attempting to
break into a house in the rear of 10
Waverly place.
Rooker and Brown about 3 o'clock ob
served Blx Chinese acting in a suspicious
manner in front of the house. One of
them remained on watch outside while
the other five disappeared. The two of
ficers proceeded to investigate, and the
lookout ran along Waverly place. Rooker
gave chase and as the Chinese turned tho
corner of Clay street Rooker fired a shot
in the air to intimidate him. It had no
effect and as Rooker swung round the
corner the Chinese wheeled round and
fired a shot at him, but his aim, too, was
bad.
Sergeant Harper happened to he near
by and hearing the shooting ran in the
direction and he and Rook*>r overtook the
Chinese at Dupont street and soon had
the handcuffs on his wrists. They re
turned to 10 Waverly place and on going
to the rear, accompanied by Brown, round
the other five Chinese". They were
promptly placed under arrest and an In
vestigation showed that an attempt had,
been made to force an entrance into the
rear building by removing the bars with
the help of a "jimmy."
The six were taken to the City Prison,
where they gave the names of *Ah Loy.
Ah Gem, Ah Jung, Ah Quong, Ah Chow
and Ah Foo. When searched a revolver
was found upon Ah Loy, a large dirk
knife upon Ah Gem, a revolver upon Ah
Jung, a dirk knife upon Ah Quong, a re
volver and dirk knife upon Ah Chow and
Ah Foo. Besides they had two "jim
mies," a saw. several candles and two
bars of wood, all for use in breaking Into
a house.
Each was charged with attempted bur
glary; Ah Loy with assault to murder in
firing the shot at Rooker and the other
five with carrying concealed weapons.
They are a villainous looking lot.
They were arraigned in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday morning and at their re
quest the cases were continued for a week
to enable them to get counsel.
Wang Tong. a merchant from Santa
Rosa, called at police headquarters yes
terday and reported that an attempt had
been made to break into the residence of
his father-in-law on Sacramento street
opposite Waverly place yesterday
morning, but the burglars were scared off.
He was spending his honeymoon at his
father-in-law's residence and as all the
marriage presents were there it was
thought that the burglars had been after
them. The police think that the six high
binders under arrest made the attempt,
but being foiled, went to 10 Waverly place,
where they were captured.
Acted in Self-Defense.
The charge of murder against Captain
Antone Christiansen of the schooner Re
liance was dismissed by Judge Joachim
sen yesterday as the evidence showed that
he acted in self defense. On June 4,
Gustav Forstman went aboard the Re
liance to assault Christiansen because he
had cast off the lines of his boat which
was anchored near. Forstman struck at
< 'hristifinsen. and to protect hlmselt
Christiansen picked up a pair of large

with them, causing his death.

SHORT AND
ENERGETIC
CAMPAIGN
Major McLaughlin's
Plan of Battle.
PARTY VICTORY ASSURED
STATE MACHINERY NOW IN
WORKING ORDER.
Active Operations Should Begin About
August IâCheering1 â Cheering Results
of thÂ« Oregon
Election.
Major Frank McLaughlln, chairman
of the Republican State Committee,
cannot call to mind a time in the his
tory of California when the prospects
of Republican success in a State elec
tion -were brighter than they are at
present. He cites many reasons for his
belief that the party will win a Rreat
victory in the election next November.
When asked yesterday when the
members of the State Committee would
be called together for the purpose
of designating a time and place for
holding the State convention, and*for
the further purpose of opening a vigor
ous campaign, he replied:
"It is the judgment of the leading
men of the party that the campaign
should be brief and energetic. The
members of the committee will be sum
moned to meet some time between the
middle of July and the first of August
and then steps will be taken to fix the
apportionment of delegates and name a
time and place for the meeting of the
convention to nominate candidates.
"I am not in favor of a long cam
paign," continued Major McLaughlin
''Considering that our party machinery
is in perfect working order there is no
necessity for opening the campaign at
this time. In fact, we are in close
touch every day with county com
mittees throughout the State. Our ma
chinery has been kept in motion all the
time. Our rooms have never been closed
since they were opened. We are not
obliged to organize early and arrange
a vast deal of preliminary work. Not
a day passes that we do not receive
letters from interior committees. The
responsive work is not neglected.
Literature is supplied and information
given.
"Formerly It was the custom to
abandon headquarters after election
and organize anew for the succeeding
- campaign. This required time to se
: cure rooms and get in touch with com
mittees throughout the State.
"The outlook for a Republican vic
tory in California was never more
promising. Members of the party are
sanguine and enthusiastic. The Oregon
victory is cheering. As an example of
enthusiasm and energy not'- the atti
tude of the Republican League of
Clubs. These organizations were never
in better shape and more confident of
winning out. The success of our fleets
on the ocean and our armies on the land
will add strength to the Republican
party. We will be ready to open the
campaign in ample time. We are or
ganized so effectively that the cam
paign once begun can be conducted
without a halt to a victorious finish."
F. X. SCHOONMAKER ARRIVES.
The Distinguished Republican Orator
Returns From a Stumping
Tour in Oregon.
F. X. Schoonmaker, the distinguished
Republican orator, who was in this city in
1596 and made a number of speeches in
the interest of the gold standard, arrived
yesterday morning from Oregon, where
he has been following out the same line
and from the sweeping Republican vic
tory his efforts have been crowned with
surprisingly good results. In an inter
view Mr. Schoonmaker, who is an exceed
ingly pleasant and affable gentleman,
said: "The result of the elections in Ore
gon surprised even the most sanguine,
and the victory was indeed a magnificent
one for the gold standard. I went to Ore
gon at the earnest solicitation of one of
my best friends, Congressman Tongue,
who was seeking re-election in a district
which had given Bryan a majority of 1700
in IS!W. I could not resist the entreaty
and did what I could to help him along.
How successful we were the reports show
and it would not surprise me to see the
Republican majority reach 12,000.
"It was a clean cut issue on the money
question. The campaign wm fought on
those lines and even the discussion of the
silver question was forbidden by the local
committee. Naturally the public speak
ers found themselves considerably cir
cumscribed and I. for one, found it very
hard to keep within the prescribed limits
as there is so much that is interesting to
be said about silver. On one side were
arrayed the gold Republicansand the gold
Democrats, and on the other a fusion of
every other party that exists under the
Fun. There were 16 to 1 Demierats, 16 to 1
Republicans, Populists, middle of the
road men and so many others I really
cannot remember them all. The result
was never for a moment left in doubt in
my mind, for ours was a good cause. It
was the grand majority which surprised
us all.
"I believe that the result in Oregon will
have an effect on the elections this year
in all the other States and I look for the
utimate and complete triumph of the
gold standard in the United States."
ELECTBIO CABS ON TAYLOB.
The Market-Street System Connect
ing the Turk and Ellis Street
Lines.
Chief Constructor H. H. Lynch of the
Market-street system of street cars
started a gang of men on Taylor 3treet
yesterday morning on the block between
Turk and Ellis streets taking up the old
rails that had done service on that street
when Reuben Morton owned the Turk-
Btreet line and when the "change cars for
Lone Mountain" had its transfer point at
Taylor and Turk. These old rails w-re
taken up yesterday and in their stead a
new track will be put down between ihe
two streets mentioned for a line which
will connect with Turk and Ellis by elec
tric power. How the connections are to
be made Constructor Lynch does not vet
know. All he knows is that the two
blocks mentioned have been ordered to be
put in condition for use of cars. Whether
the line will be continued down Sixth
?treet or not remains securely locked in
the breasts of the wise ones In the tall
building at Market and Montgomery
It is said, however, that an electric line
will be run down Eighth street in the
future to connect with the Bryant-street
inc. It Is noticed that the MaYket-streot
line has taken a sudden move in prf-ttinp
all of its old lines into shape as well as
asking for several franchises over new
lines. It is thought that the charter
lately adopted has something to do with
this general desire to put old lines in or
der and reach out for new.
