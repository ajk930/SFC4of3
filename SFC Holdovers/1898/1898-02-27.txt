The President Is Still Hope

Settlement.
Members of Neither House Will
Follow Him if Any Party in
Spain Destroyed the
Maine.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â The idea of demanding a
mere money indemnity for the dastardly destruction of
the Maine is not popular in Congress. It is not thought
the country will be satisfied to consider this as it would a
commercial question. The only circumstances under which
a money indemnity would be regarded as adequate would
be if Spain should prove conclusively that the act was
that of a private citizen and could produce and punish the
culprit.
The complicity of any political organization or fac
tion of Spain, though an enemy to the present ministry
and even to the crown of Spain, would place the responsi
bility upon the Spanish Government in a way to preclude
a. money settlement.
A proposition held to be clear by well-informed men
about Congress is that if it is shown that the explosion
occurred from external causes the immediate assumption
will be that it was the act of Spain. The burden of proof
to correct this assumption, if it be wrong, will then lie
upon Spain. If she could prove conclusively that the
crime was committed by an individual, and that the man- j
ncr of its accomplishment was such as to acquit the Gov- j
ernment of negligence or connivance, a humble apology
and the payment of indemnity would suffice.
A matter that causes the situation to be looked upon
with extreme gravity in Congress is the difficulty that
must be experienced in qualifying the responsibility of
Spain for the disaster. The presumptive evidence is gen
. erally held in Congress to be that no one could have ex-

ploded a mine under the
Maine without the conniv
ance of the authorities. The
accident theory once dis
posed of, as it has been dis
posed of, it is believed this
country will be forced to the conclu
sion the crime was the act of Spanish
officials.
It is believed that the present
Spanish Ministry, if convinced that
the explosion was not the result of
an accident, would be willing to
make any sort of reparation, and
would do this with every show of
humility which the dastardly char
acter of the crime would demand, but
it is feared that the state of public
feeling in Spain and among Span
iards in Cuba will not admit of the
Ministry doing whot their better
judgment and sentiment of justice
and propriety would dictate. It is
not thought the Sagasta Government
can have anything but the greatest
abhorrence for such a crime, but the
Ministry is not felt to be strong
enough to deal with the matter as it
should.
Little doubt is entertained in
Congress that if the Maine was de
stroyed by intent it was the work of
Weylerites, aimed as much at Sa
gasta and Blanco as at the United
States. It is no exaggeration to say
there is a show of impatience over
the reported consideration by the
President and members of his Cab
inet of a proposition to demand a
money indemnity. The claims now

Department for losses sustained by
American citizens on account of the

lions. The claimants and their
friends in Congress grow more im
patient each day at the hesitation
of the State Department in pressing
these claims. The explanation of

tion and the inference is that the

PRESIDENT M'KINLEY
TALKING INDEMNITY.
It Is Clear That the Administration
Will Avoid a War With Spain if
That Is Possible.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: Mature and judicial
consideration of all the facts, and pre
parations to meet any possible contin
gency, continues to be the policy of the
administration in connection with the
Maine disaster. No new light, official
or otherwise, developed to-day as to
the initial cause of the great calamity,
and the authorities are patiently wait
ing, with such fortitude as they can
under the circumstances, for the final
report of the court of inquiry before
definitely deciding on any course of ac
tion.
The settlement of the serious ques
tion without a conflict with Spain is the
main point of discussion between the
Authorities pending the receipt of the
court's conclusions. It is manifest from
many quarters that the President, while
fully appreciating the temper of the
country, does not consider the matter
beyond settlement through the medium
of" diplomacy if the Spanish Govern
ment will receive in the proper spirit
the demand which is made on it.

THE MAINE'S ARMOR BELT
WAS BLOWN CLEAR INBOARD.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26. â A Key West special to the Herald says:
I have just received from Havana valuable information as to the
Maine disaster. In advices from there I aia informed that the last
examination of the wreck made by the divers on Thursday revealed
the fact that the forward part of the Maine's port armor belt was
broken completely off. The broken section was founu in the debris
of the wreck, and nearly a dozen feet aboard.
To be exact, the distance from the afterpart of the detached
metal to the forward part of the ruptured belt is 11 feet 4 inches.
The forward part of the belt is bent inboard and upward. The
plate bulges in sharply at the point where the broken section is de
tached.
This armor belt tapers from a ten-inch thickness at its top to
a four-inch thickness at its base. It is of the best Harveyized
steel, and when it was being put in place I remember that Assist
ant Naval Constructor Street, now dead, told me the metal was so
hard it was necessary to anneal the plates at points where the bolt
holes were to be cut. I mention this as showing the strength
and hardness of the metal.
It is hardly necessary, however, as no one can conceive how
even a plate of butter could be bulged inward by an internal explo
sion. The detached section of the armor took with it its armor
bolts and rubber washers. The washers were closely examined
and were found to be intact except at the point of rupture. This
is regarded as significant, my informant believing that the gases
generated by an inside explosion would have melted the rubber.
The wooden backing of the armor is splintered, showing a blow
from the outside.
Three six-inch powder cases were recovered from the wreck on
Thursday evening. These cases, originally cylindrical in shape,
are telescoped in the way you crush an opera hat. The horizontal
seams are split open. This is corrugation, indicating that the
charges were intact when pressure was brought to bear.
I have received a fuller description of the appearance of that
uplifted keel. The Maine was fixed with a double bottom, and
between the bottom and the inner skin ran a series of strengthen
ing plates. Of these the first on the port side has been hove up
ward to a point level with the water line of the wreck. This sec
tion of the hull was identified by the strainer for flooding that spe
cial compartment, and which, the explosion lifted into view, to
gether with the sluices for running water from the first long
itudinal into the bilge. .

HAVANA, Feb. 26. â I
learned last night from a
source, the accuracy of which
cannot be doubted, that, in
addition to taking the evi
dence of divers yesterday,
several other important wit
nesses were heard. They
were produced before the
board of inquiry at the in
stance of Consul - General
Lee, and their testimony
was in effect that they had
heard remarks made by cer
tain Spaniards which, in
their opinion, indicated a
deliberate plot against the
Maine.
The witnesses were Cu

one, who is an Italian, but

Their evidence was taken by
the board through Consular

was impossible to learn
either their names or the names of
the persons implicated by their tes
timony.
Official circles are thoroughly
stirred up by cable dispatches from
New York and Washington indicating
the great importance attached to the
Herald's recent dispatch concerning
Naval Constructor Powelson's testi
mony. One result already manifest is
the increased stringency of the censor
ship.
Strong efforts were made yesterday
by the representatives of other New
York newspapers to persuade Powel
son to deny the character of his evi
dence before the board. Mr. Powel
son, however, refused to be quoted in
any way. and in explanation of the
consistent attitude of silence which
he has maintained, simply cited the
strict orders of the department.

VALUABLES
Owners of Cliff Castles to Save

Possibility of Destruction
by Spanish Guns.
BOSTON Feb 26.â The millionaire owners of the cliff castles at
Newport are' taking early precaution to save their most valuable prop
erty from the possibility of destruction by hostile guns. They are alive
to the necessity of removing their works of art and costly bric-a-brac
gathered from many lands, and the safe deposit companies and big
storehouses inland are to receive much of it before many more days
have passed. Telegraphic orders have come to servants during the
past twenty-four hours for the removal of the pictures ana silverware,
and some is being shipped to New York to-day, while still more is
going to country homes in various parts of New England and the
Middle States.
Many Millions invested in mansions on the edge of the cliffs cannot
be removed at all. or even protected from an enemy's fleet, for the deep
sea of the south shore is unguarded and the marble palace of the Van
derbllts, the princely home of the Goelets, the palatial cliff "boxes" of
the Lorillards would only serve as targets for the long-range guns on
war vessels passing along the coast five to seven miles off shore.
There is from $25,000,000 to $30,000,000 invested in houses alone on
the Newport cliffs, all visible a long distance at sea, and in the event
of war the wealthy owners fully realize that insurance risks become
doubtful, and they would have to suffer the entire loss if. bombarded.
Newport, as well as its costly cliff mansions, is also unprotected from
an attack on the sea side, though its harbor may be guarded by torpe
does.
The wealthy summer colony will take Its chances, but such men as
Belmont, Wetniore. Van Alen. Vanderbilt, Lorillard, Havemeyer, Whit
ney, Payne, Bennett, Brice, Palmer and Drexel are casting anchors to
windward and will, if possible, afford less amusement to the lively
crews of passing Spanish warships.
this morning, was shown upstairs to
the room of Consul-General Lee,
where they remained in close consulta- !
tion for several hours. Consul-Gen
eral Lee rarely goes to the Consular
office until after breakfast, at about v j
o'clock. The fact that Senator Proctor |
sought a conference immediately in the
hotel, instead of seeking it later at the
Consulate, is regarded as significant by
people who profess to see graver pur
poses than tarpon-fishing in the Ver
mont statesman's arrival.
It may be of some interest to know
that Captain Eulate of the Spanish
cruiser Vizcaya was not long ago com
mander of the navy-yard in Havana.
He was in charge when the Competi
tor was captured and presided at the
trial of the captain and crew. He rec
ommended to the authorities in Madrid
that the prisoners be shot.
The Colonial or Autonomist Govern
ment has appointed Manuel Rafael An
gulo to act as delegate in New York
to negotiate the proposed commercial
treaty with the United States. His sal
ary is $9000 a year, according to the
official gazette.
The rebels continue to display great
activity, and without fighting any im
portant engagements manage to keep
large forces of Spanish troops contin
ually moving.
Senor Calvez y Delmonte, formerly
eclitor of a Separatist paper in New-
York, has arrived at Havana and been
appointed Judge of Guanabacoa. Thje
Colonial Government has stated its
willingness to grant important
appointments to persons accepting au-
tonomy.
The Naval Board of Inquiry has con
cluded its first work Â«jf investigation.
Most of the salient evidence available
is undoubtedly now in* its possession.
Yet there is no reason to expect an
early report. The board cannot justly
be said to have been slothful in its
work, but is has been exceedingly de
liberate. Indeed, the impression here
is growing, as already indicated in these
dispatches, that there is a distinct pur
pose, doubtless inspired by high au
thority, to gain as much time as can
be safely done without actually expos
ing the board to the charge of dilatori
ness in the prosecution of its task.
The belief that this -is the purpose of
the administration is strengthened by
the arrival here this morning of Sena

tor Proctor, former Secretary of War.
His coming at this time has caused
much comment, both among Ameri
cans and Spaniards. When I saw Sen
ator Proctor this morning he pro
tested emphatically that his visit had
no official significance whatever; that
the only business he has in hand is bus
iness of a purely private nature; th.it
he has been tarpon-fishing in Florida,
and is in Cuba chiefly for his health.
Consul-General Lee seems anxious
to verify what Senator Proctor says.
When I told the Consul last night that
the Senator would arrive this morning
he appeared surprised and admitted
it was the first information he had re
ceived on the subject. Lee promptly
added, however, that the fact that he.
the Consul-General, had not been in
formed was the best possible evidence
that no official significance could rea
sonably be attached to Senator Proc
tor's visit.
Despite these statements. Senator
Proctor's well-known relations of in
timacy with the President, his record
in the Senate and the War Department
and his reputation for coolness and
good judgment, cause Americans in
Havana to accept his explanation with
some degree of incredulity. Persons
who have known the Senator for years
to-day remarked that he does not look
like a man who needs travel for his
health. Mr. Proctor, in fact, appears
particularly robust. It is even pointed
out that there are other localities in the
tropics which under present condi
tions, may justly be regarded as more
nearly ideal health resorts than the city
of Havana.
THE NAVAL COURT
HAS LEFT HAVANA.
Will Resume Its Sessions to Take
Testimony at Key West, Prob

HAVANA. Feb. 26.â The lighthouse
tender Mangrove sailed at half-past 3
this afternoon for Key West with mem
bers of the Naval Court of Inquiry on
board. Their purpose is to make a
leisurely run to Key West and resume
the sessions there on Monday morning.
In all probability four or five days will
be long enough to secure all the testi
mony in Key West, and at the expira
.tion of that time Havana will again be
come the scene of investigation. It is
believed now the board will not be sat

isfifd to submit its report until it has
had a better opportunity of actually in
specting the bottom of the wrecked
ship. This will not be possible, of
course, until the more powerful wreck
ing apparatus now en route from New-
York has arrived here and had time
enough to raise the shattered ship, at
least partially, and clear â¢ away the
mud from around her hulk.
The concluding session to-day was
one of considerable importance. Cap
tain Sigsbee was recalled to go over
certain portions of his previous testi
mony.
Consul General Lee visited the Man
grove shortly before she sailed and
conferred briefly with the members of
the board, i He was not there as a wit
ness, but rather as the escort of Sena
tor Proctor and his traveling com
panion, M.. M. Parker of Washing
ton. The party first visited Captain
Cowtes on board the Fern and then
came over to the Mangrove in one of
the Fern's boats. Senator Proctor was
presented to the members of the board
and then, after a brief informal con
ference with Consul General Lee, dur
ing which the members of the court
referred to the prospects of their early
return here, the Generaf and Senator
went ashore and the Mangrove headed
down harbor and had soon passed
Moro Castle.
The greater part of to-day's session
was again devoted to Ensign Powel
son, who had been recalled to elaborate
his previous testimony. The board ex
amined him in great detail and put the
expert young constructor through a
series of technical questions. Mr. Pow
elson used elaborate drawings to illus
trate his testimony and showed a thor
ough . knowledge of the subject, an
swering all questions put by Judge Ad
vocate Marix and Captain Chapman,
who for a time assumed the role of
questioner.
Senator Proctor and his Washington
friend visited Dr. Brunncr to-day un
der Consul General Lee's escort. The
vaccinatrbn marks were not so recent
as they ought to have been and so the
distinguished Senator had to submit his
arm to the lance of Dr. Brunner, who
is no respector of persons. Even Sen
atorial dignity had to yield to vaccine
virus, and it yielded gracefully.
Only three bodies were recovered to
day. The platform to be constructed
for the use of the divers is not yet
ready, and the work consequently was
not so successful as was hoped. One
body, that o,f J. W. Johnson, was iden
tified later through tattoo marks on
the arms.
Fred Holzer, reported dying in an
earlier dispatch, died in the hospital to
day.
ARCHBISHOP IRELAND
ON THE NATIONS CRISIS.
If Guilt Is Brought to Spai i's Door,
Justice Mu.;t Be
Done
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â Archbishop
Ireland, who is in this city, said In an
interview to-day on the Spanish ques
tion:
"I have fully considered everything
that I have seen in the papers and
while at Washington I talked to the
officials of the Government, and in my
opinion nothing has yet come to light
that would, in my judgment, call for a
rupture between the United States and
Spain. Certainly, if guilt is brought to
the door of Spain full retributive jus
tice should be the order of the day.
Liberal indemnity, apologies and full
reparation ought to be preferable to
the legislators rather than that course
which would entail the country into
the consequences of war.
"The attitude of the administration
is dignified, worthy of this great na
tion. War scares and the clamors of
war do not move it. It awaits the ne
cessity of war, meanwhile making
ready. Mr. McKinley will not rush the
country into a needless conflict. Should
the honor of the country demand that
Mr. McKinley sign the proclamation of
war, he will do it with the same love
for peace, the same courage and the
same trust in the God of our nation
that characterized Abraham Lincoln
nearly forty years ago."
"What is the attitude of the Catholic
church at this time?" was asked.
"The Catholic church assumes no at
titude of any kind. She has not been
called upon the scene. The fact that
Spain is a Catholic nation matters
nothing. The question is not one of re
ligion. If there is a question at all, it
is not one of national and international
right and nothing else."

ARMY AND NAVY
Long's Request for More
Seamen Has Not Been
Acted Upon.
When the Bill Is Reported It
Will Be Speedily Passed
by Congress.
War Department Makes Arrange
ments for the Two New Regi
ments of Artillery.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Secre
tary Long may have to wait until the
latter part of next week or longer for
the legislation which he has asked au
thorizing the enlistment of 1500 addi
tional seamen. Chairman Boutelle of
the Naval Committee received the Sec
retary's letter this morning, but he did
not think the necessity for legislation
was so urgent as to warrant him in
calling a special meeting of the Naval
Committee to consider the draft of the
bill the Secretary submitted. When I
saw Boutelle late this evening he said
he had not given the matter much con
sideration, and he did not know wheth
er he would call a special meeting for
Monday or no-t. He consulted with
Speaker Reed and with Senator Hale,
chairman of the Senate Naval Com
mittee, during the day, but he would
not say that any programme had been
agreed upon. Should his committee
meet and report tin;- bill there is no
question whatever as to its speedy pas
sage through the House under a spe
cial order from the Committee on
Rules.
One matter that prevents Boutelle
giving much attention to the request
of Secretary Long for more sailors is
his great anxiety to get the bill for
the relief of the survivors and the heirs
of the victims of the Maine disaster
through Congress as quickly as pos
sible.
Representative Cannon, chairman of
the Committee on Appropriations, is
opposing the consideration of this bill
at present.
The officials of the War Department
have completed all the preliminary ar
rangements for the immediate execu
tion of the bill, which is expected to be
come a law within the next few days,
providing fur two additional regiments
of artillery. There will be no difficulty
whatever in securing men, applications
for enlistment having been received
far in pxcess of the number required,
viz., 1610 men. -&reat care will be taken
in the recruiting, and only the best
men will be accepted. Under the law
all the new men must be citizens of the
United States. It is probable the ranks
will be recruited to a large extent from
men who have already served one or
more terms in the army. As fast as
recruited they will be gathered at the
recruiting rendezvous and held to
await the action of the, general com
manding. The principal rendezvous for
recruits arr at Fort Slocum, New York;
Washington Barracks, Columbus Bar
racks, Ohio; Fort Sheridan, 111., and
Jefferson Baraeks, Mo. The present
intention is to transfer experienced
non-commissioned officers and men to
the new regiments as a nucleus for
their organization and to fill their
places by promotion and recruits. With
the two new regiments there will be
seven regiments of artillery, and the
total strength of the army, including
the hospital corps, ordnance and engi
neer battalion and the West Point de
tachment, will be increased to nearly
27,000 men.
MERCHANTS CONSPIRED
TO DESTROY THE MAINE
Three Spaniards of Havana Alleged
to Have Bought Explosives
From the Government.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â A special to
a morning paper from Key West, Fla.,
says: I have to-day received private
information from Havana that con
vinces me that the de struetion of the
Maine was the work of three Spanish
merchants.
They have stores on Muralla street
between Habana and Villegas streets.
These men obtained the torpedo or
mine from sone one connected with the
Spanish Government, and gave it to
one of the three conspirators.
The four were to receive $10,000, al
though only a part of the money has
been paid. One of the men employed
was a. well-known diver of Regla, the
best In the harbor.
The spot selected to place the bat
tery, connected by wire with the mine
or torpedo, was over a bank called
Bajo de Santa Cataline, close to the
Maine.
This information comes from a
source that gives it great weight. I
have reason to believe that this clew
will lead to the detection of the per
petrators of the Maine outrage.
The information that the mine or
fixed torpedo was operated from Santa
Catalina wharf comes to me from two
sources as well as the statement that
the men engaged in the work were
poorly paid for the hideous success.
Santa Catalina is a huge old hos
pital built out in the water across from
Havana. It has been abandoned for
some time and its deserted vastness
would afford all the opportunity want
ed by a set of skilled divers to operate
from. Here the conspirators met niÂ«rht
after night and planned the destruc
tion of the battle-ship.
They had but a Bhi t distance to Â§ro
after leaving the wharf, and as the
air pump was worked inside out of
sight, and as the diver moved be
neath the water it was impossible for
the watch on the ship to observe the
movements of those working to place
the mine.
More Wreckers for Havana.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â At the
office of the Merritt & Chapman
Dredging and Wrecking Company to
day it was said that the wrecking tug
Underwriter of Boston and the derrick
Chief would start from here to-day for
Havana to assist in the work of re
moving salvage and raising the wreck
of the Maine. Captain Kearn Feeney
said the company sent seventy-five
men to Havana to aid in the work of
raising the Maine, and that this week
the Big derricks, the Reliance a.nd the

Monarch has a lifting capacity of 200
tons and the Reliance 175 tons.

.NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â A Key "West
special to the Herald says: The most
important expedition that has gone
Into Cuba since the insurrection began
has just been successfully landed'from
the famous filibuster Dauntless by
"Dynamite" Johnny O'Brien and Dr.
M. Nunez. This was, in fact, a double
expedition, landings having been made
in Santiago de Cuba and then in Pinar

West arrived from Miami this after
noon, having on board besides O'Brien
and Nunez J. C. Carlaya, Emilio Nu

Hernandez, F. Alonzo and Frank
Plaguchi. These men were taken up at
10 o'clock this morning at Bay Hunda,
a small key about thirty miles from
here. The Dauntless came clos^ up to
that key just before daybreak this
morning and dropped them there, and
then steamed away for some northern
port, where she will be likely seized by
United States officials.
"Dynamite Johnny" O'Brien was
highly elated when I saw him this af
ternoon. He refused to admit he had
been aboard the Dauntless, but freely
admitted he had been in charge of an
rmportant and successful filibustering
expedition.
"We gave to General Calixto Gar
cia," he said to me, "five hundred thou
sand rounds of ammunition, a largo
number of modern rifles and dynamite
enough to blow up many Spanish forts.
More than, that, we gave him three ex
pert electricians with wires and bat
teries necessary for firing dynamite
safely and successfully! We landed
considerable quantities of clothing,
shoes, physicians and medicines. The
medicine is in charge of four trained
nurses, who are protected by Red
Cross passports and who will nurse the
sick and wounded insurgents. About
forty volunteers left our expedition to
join Garcia's forces. We were met by
a body of cavalry numbering perhaps
200, for we are sure our goods got into
the right hands this time. This land
ing was made without interruption on
the morning of the 20th.
"Five days later we made the land
ing in Matanzas Province, where thirty
men took charge of 400,000 rounds of
ammunition, several cases of rifles,
quantities of dynamite with electrical
accessories, clothing, provisions and
medicines. All this has no doubt
reached General Diaz before now. We
were so secure of our position in the
east that we remained where we had
made the landing for twelve hours, and
then turned our noses toward Bay
Hunda. Our homeward run was with
out incident, but we had two scares on
the run for Cuba. I can't tell you when
and where it was, but the first night
after we took the expedition aboard we
came near poking our way into serious
difficulty. We were just about to run
out from behind one of the keys when
the lookout saw a finger from the flash
light strike the sea a quarter of a mile
before us. We slowed down, and an in
vestigation showed a warship of the
United States not far off.
"Had we not seen the flashlight five
minutes would have carried us into
full view of the ship. As it was we soon
slipped away unperceived. Off the
south coast of Cuba we sighted what
we took to be a French man-of-war.
We were seen, too, but no notice was
taken of us. Later on we caught a
glimpse of a Spaniard, but as we had
no business with him we did not speak
him. you may be sure. As he showed
a disposition to hug the shore, we were
compelled to run out to sea, and in that
way lost twenty hours, but it is all
right. When we next approached Cuba
we found the coast clear, and running
to the place of landing agreed upon,
found Garcia's cavalry awaiting us.
After that our expedition was without
incident.
"We knew nothing of the destruction
of the Maine until picked up by the
City of Key West to-day. We were
shocked, indeed, but Spanish
character, were not greatly surprised.
I am convinced that should we send
another warship on a 'friendly' mis
sion to Havana it would meet the fate
of the Maine. Dr. Nunez and I leave
on the Mascot to-night for Port Tam
pa and will proceed directly to New
York."
Dr. Nunez and the Cuban junta have
plans all made for sending 3000 men,
armed and equipped, into Eastern Cuba
just as soon as they can go openly.
That can only be when war between
Spain and the United States has been
declared, and Dr. Nunez believes such
hostilities are imminent. He said in
conversation with me:
"We know that Havana is In a riot
ing mood and we are constantly ex
pecting a demonstration against the
Americans in the city. A plot was laid
not long ago to assassinate Consul-
General Lee. It was Intended it should
appear to be the work of a crank and
blame was to be cast upon the Cubans,
just as the palace is now attempting to
cast upon us the blame for the destruc
tion of the Maine.
"We learned of the plot through one
of our Havana agents and promptly in
formed General Lee, who took steps to
protect himself. I am told he went to
General Blanco arid told him that the
plot was known" to him. I fully believe
that General Lee's life is in danger, as
is also that of every other American in
Havana. When the rioting begins,
however, the end of Spain in Cuba will
have come."
Doubtless Patriotically Mad.
MADRID, Feb. 26.â The Naclonal, in
a paragraph headed, "Madman or
Spaniard ?" says: "We are informed
that a distinguished officer of the com
missariat recently called at the resi
dence of the representative of a nation
which has been greatly prominent
since the war in Cuba. The officer's
manner aroused the apprehensions of
the diplomat, who refused to see his
visitor and informed the authorities,
who intervened and sent the officer to
a military asylum, declaring him
'Doubtlessly patriotically mad.' " The
diplomat referred to by the Nacional
is evidently United States Minister
Woodford.

Vessels Being Pre

NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â A Philadelphia special to the Herald says:
The monitor Miantonomah and ram Katahdin ate to be put in commis
sion at once. A "hurry order" to that effect was received at the
League Island Navy Yard to-day, and a force -of men was immediately
put to work upon the monitor to make a few alterations that are nec
essary. The Katahdin loads her stores befr/re steaming away. Both
vessels are to be ready for sea by Tuesday, and between now and then
there will not be a moment of idlness upon either. Even to-morrow
will not be observed in the hasty preparation for war.
The Columbia and Minneapolis have also been ordered to- prepare
for sea. Both cruisers have been in commission for some time, but it
was not until to-day that the order for sea preparations was received.
In sixty hours they can be ready for active service. The work of put
ting stores aboard them will not be begun until Monday morning.
The Miantonomah has been at League Island since March, when she
was placed out of commission and her men distributed among ships in
active service. To put the ship in fighting trim it will be but a matter
of a few hours. For the first time ship visitors were not permitted mi
board for fear of their interference with the progress of work. "Our
orders are imperative," said one of the men in charge; "we cannot per
mit anybody to run around here." The monitor will have over 200 men.
in her complement, and it is expected that they will arrive from
Brooklyn on Monday.
On board the Minneapolis and Columbia preparations are going qui
etly on. The general impression aboard the Minneapolis and Columbia
is that both ships are to go South, although their destination is knmvn
only to the Navy Department.
Down at Fort Mifflin the activity is pronounced. This morning the
naval tug was called into service to take a party of seamen and gun
ners, in addition to several officers from League Island to the magazine
there. Heretofore but one or two officers and several seamen have been
taken to Fort Mifflin each day in the steam launch.

the pending question, as grave as it is,

He thinks that if war came it would be
precipitated by Spain's attitude and
not by that of the United States. That
the administration still regards a
peaceful settlement of the matter on an
indemnity basis, whatever the decision

further confirmed by Secretary Sher

The venerable Secretary spent some
time with his former colleagues and
talked freely with them concerning the
entire Cuban question, and the Maine
disaster in particular. He made it
clear to them that an indemnity would
be demanded in proportion to the cir
cumstances hereafter to be developed
by the decision of the court of inquiry
as to the extent of Spain's responsibil

disaster would be dealt with as casus

The extent of Spain's responsibility
hinges a great deal upon the question
whether there are any mines in Havana
harbor. The Spanish Government,
through Senor Dubosc of the Spanish
legation here, has positively declared
that there are no mines in the harbor.
The authorities here are not prepared
to deny the accuracy of his statement.
The secret archives of the military arvl
naval divisions of our War and Navy
departments do not contain any proof
of the existence of such mines. Al
though it has been stated that Captain
Sigsbee, some time before the disaster,
reported that the harbor was full of
torpedo mines and there was one di
rectly under the Maine. tTie statemtM '
is emphatically denied at the Navy D<

FOR WAR
ASSURED
Mr. Hanna in Consultation
With New York
Bankers.
The President Told He Can Have
All the Gold He Wants to
Put Into the War
Chest.
NEW YORK. Feb. 26.â Senator
Hanna's visit to New YoTk was
a dual one. He had private bus
iness of a very pressing nature,
and he also came to secure for
President McKinley thp assur
ances of the financial world re
specting: a bond issue. These he
received last night at one of the
most important financial confer
ences ever held in this country.
It was held in an uptown club,
and among those reported pres
ent were President J. Edward
Simmons of the Clearing House,
President Henry \Y. Cannon of
Chase Bank and President Per
kins of the Importers' and Trad
ers' Bank. Represpntatives of
several trust companies and
larger insurance companies
which are heavy investors were
also present. The group which
met Mr. Hanna was empowered
to speak directly or indirectly for.
99 per cent of the invested capi
tal of this country.
Mr. Hanna was given to understand
in unmistakable terms that the ad
ministration could depend upon all the
money support necessary to carry out
any plan of action which might be de
termined upon. A series of bond is
sues aggregating $500,000,000 was sug
gested as a possibility, and was ac
quiesced in by the assembled financiers.
The bankers who participated are
averse to discussing the conference or
its conclusions, and in some cases posi
tive denials have been made. The fact
that it had taken place and was so har
monious had much to do with bringing
ab>.ut comparative steadiness in the
market to-day.
Mr. Hanna, when interviewed to-day,
paid: "My mission here has no bearing
: "ii the great national question which
(I- uppermost in everybody's mind at
present as to whether or not the de
struction of the Maine was caused by
accident or design. I had the impres
sion when the news of the accident first
reached us that it was the result of
f'ime cause on board ship, and I have
not yet changed my opinion. I love
the United States first, and I am not
in favor of needlessly precipitating
thf country into the horrors of war.
"I feel secure with others of my fel
low citizens in President McKinley's
judgment concerning the situation. He
is eminently qualified to solve the prob
lem which confronts us and is not likely
insider it superficially. The man
who does view it superficially is not fit
to be a legislator or an executive. It
is a singular fact that those who are
now inflammatory in their utterances

most eloquently about freedom for

relieving the sufferings of the Cubans.

rnpo. The actual loss in specie and legal
tenders was $7,418,400. but this was par
tially offset by an increase of $2,353,700
in specie, making the net loss for the
week $5,065,700. The specie apparently
went into half a dozen of the larger
banks.
"It is interesting to note that of the
I entire cash reserve of the New York
I banks, at least 68 per cent is held in
< the form of specie. The loss in. cash
was brought about by the heavy ship
i ments to the interior and payments
! into the treasury, but the full extent
of the former is not shown in the
j statement. While the larger part of
I the money now being withdrawn from
New York is doubtless in response to
increased demands due to better trade
i conditions, some of it reflects the un
settled state of excitement prevailing
as regards the future.
"But the New York banks generally
lose a portion of their excess balance
at this season of the year. In 1897,
between the latter part of February
and the end of March, the excess re
serve fell off $11,000,000. The loss dur
ing February, this year, has been
twelve and three-quarter millions. The
reserve, however, is now about one
half of what it was twelve months ago,
so that the loss affects the market
rather more acutely.
"Still, the sensitiveness of the situa
tion and our strong position as regards
international balances are well shown
in the fact that even the light increases
in rates last week have started gold
imports. A continued firm market will
only emphasize this factor. For the
moment the demoralization of the stock
market, the heavy liquidation and real
izations have contracted the loan item.
There is nothing, however, indicating
that money is going to be excessively
dear, even should complications arise.
A study of. the past week's operations
illustrates perfectly the direction in
which relief can be looked for. In
other words, our money loaned abroad
can be made instantly available "
Russell Sage gave out the following
authorized interview to-day:
"From all the information received
there is little doubt in my mind that
our warship was blown up by outside
agencies, and if the naval commission
so reports the time for action has
come. There should be no wavering.
This Government must demand the
fullest reparation, and that without
delay. Whatever action for war or
otherwise President McKinley may
take he should and will have the full
est support from both rich and poor,
Republicans and Democrats. There is
no question as to where the rich stand.
In the Civil war, wtien it broke out, I
bought Government bonds, and I did
the same thing in 1564. So did other
rich men. We had confidence in our
Government. If the necessity arises
now I will do the same thing again
generously, and so will other rich men
that I know of. I am an American,
first and last, and propose to stand by
the flag.
"Party lines will be dropped. As to
the stock market, that has got to take
care of itself for the present. The
ticker is now a secondary considera
tion. The honor of the Government
comes first. I speak not only of my
own views, on this point, but those of
other moneyed men with whom I have
talked. Another thing, the families
and dependents of every sailor killed
on the Maine must be taken care of.

SENTIMENT OF
FOREIGN PRESS
English Newspapers Do
Not Believe War
Is Near.
But They Praise the Firm
Stand Taken by the
President.
El Pais Says the War in Cuba Will
Only End When Spain Sends nn
Army Against Uncle Sam.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 26.â Sensational dis
patches, purporting to report alarm
ist utterances of President McKinley,
Secretary Long and other officials, are
beginning to affect public opinion on
this side of the Atlantic, and create
the impression that possibly there may
be truth in the reports which allege
that the loss of the Maine was not due
to accident, as at first believed here.
Although war between the United
States and Spain is still regarded as
Improvable, the disposition in the city
is to regard the apprehension respect
ing Cuba as altogether exaggerated.
The Statist points out that this is a
grave mistake, "as, apart from the
sentiment, the material losses inflicted
upon Americans by the anarchy In
Cuba must not be belittled."
The Statist believes, however, that
President McKinley is strong enough
to resist the pressure, and congratu
lates him upon the 'firm and states
manlike qualities which the immediate
responsibilities of his position have de
veloped," and upon the honorable and
noble prnciples which he enunciated at
Philadelphia when he quoted Washing
ton.
"At the same time," continues the
Statist, "we realize that the President
cannot afford to quarrel with his sup
porters if the latter press war."
The Saturday Review is of the opin
ion that the 'affair is gravely threat
ening," and comments upon the sileneo
of the Court of Inquiry into the loss of
the Maine as being "ominous," as in
the "nervous anxiety of President Mc-
Kinley and his Ministers to avoid a
rupture with Spain, they would ob
viously have hastened to publish any
thing which would help to stop the
mouths of Senators Mason and Allen,
who, with the assistance of certain
newspapers, are yelling for instant war
in the best jingo style." ,
Proceeding, the Saturday Review re
marks: "Secretary Sherman, having
been silenced by the simple process of
not allowing him to know anything, the
executive has lately kept the secrets
admirably, but it is shrewdly suspected
that the pacific position of President
McKinley is largely owing to the. re
ports of his naval advisers to the effect
that America is not in condition to go
to war with Spain with any certainty
of an immediate and overwhelming
success. The Spanish fleet is not to
be despised, and South American re
publics have not displayed any love
for their northern sister. But all this
will not prevent the jingoes forcing the
President's hand if a scrap of evi
dence implicating the Cuban authori
ties becomes public."
The Spectator is certain that the
United States Government, "whether
moved by information from Europe or
being only desirous of peace, is anxious
CONSUL-GENERAL FITZHUGH LEE.
to avoid war." Still, apart from the
loss of the Maine, the Spectator thinks
that the harrowing consular reports
from Cuba may so fire the Americans
that they will insist upon their Govern
ment ending such miseries within
American waters.
The Spectator then proceeds to re
peat the reported war preparations in
the United States, and concludes: "But
grave persons everywhere in the Union
are waiting for evidence and are not
Inclined for war unless the honor and
policy of the country really require
It."
Advices received here from Madrid
siviw that while the revolut ionary or
gans, such as El Pais, ar>' shrieking
denunciations and threats, the respon
sible newspapers have adopted ;i con
ciliatory attitude. For instance. El
Liberal, in a leading article, made a
sympathetic reference to Washington's
birthday and expressed approval of
President McKinley's Bpeech at Phila
delphia, considering it to be a "rebuff
for those seeking to embroil the
T'nited States and Spain." and express
ing the hope "that the President's ac
tion will be in accord with his words."
In conclusion El Liberal says:
"Time will tell, but for the present we
ought to cry a truce to suspicions and
animosities in honor of the memory of
the great man who. in addition t<Â« lay
ing the foundation for the liberty of
his people, contributed as few others
have done to the redeeming and dig
nifying of human conscience."
The Ministers declare that the pes
simistic views of the Spanish pn-ss are
"only the echo of the sensational state
ments made by certain American
newspapers."
SPANISH PAPERS
PLEAD FOR PEACE.
CopyriÃMfii. iw. by Jamrs Gordon Bennett
MADRID, Feb. 26.â The tenor of dis
patches from Havana published in
some of the American papers muses
the utmost surprise here, where Amer
icans until now have been considered
"onl f.nd calm in their judgments. Borne
papers publish a list of serious reports
published in the New York papers cf
l?te, one after the other being proved
untrue, and many comment especially
upon the Herald's tone. Public Beoti
mfnt here is quite calm. The Min
isterial statement issued, after regret
ting the credulity given to false re
ports, says that no incident has oc
curred which can alter the friendly re
lations between Spain and the United
States, and that the unfortunate disas
ter to the Maine, even if the explo
sion came from a malicious hand, can
lead to no complications. El Liberal,
Senor Sagasta's organ, after referring
to the troubles as adjusted, says that
the all-important Question is the
prompt pacification of Cuba; that it is
urgent and cannot be delayed.
The Globe heads a leader with Gen
eral Woodfords ringing words printed
in English. "Peace Forever." The Im
parcial, generally a jingo, even talks
of peace and urg"es action toward as
suring it. It says: "Everything now
depends upon our soldiers in Cuba to
quell the war. It matters little what
expeditions are sent out from the
United States, our troops in spite of
them should be able to extinguish the
opposition in two and a half months
before the rainy season. Diplomacy has
smothered all other difficulties, if the
war in Cuba does 'not terminate it is
the fault of our soldiers. If a war oc
curs with the United States It is the
fault of a few journalists."

Bodies From the Wrecked
Maine Should Be
Recovered.
Arrangements Made for Send
ing the Remains to Key
West for Burial.
It Is Believed That the Corpses of
Jenkins and Merritt Can Be Identi
fied by the Uniform.
Special Dispatch to The CaJL
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 26.
In the absence of news from Havana
on any subject other than the disposi
tion of the dead bodies, the official
mind turned to-day to an analysis of
the Spanish statements, made with
more or less degree Of official sanction,
respecting the total absence of sub
marine mines from Havana harbor,
and it was regarded by the Navy De
partment as negativing the mine theory
of an external cause of the explosion,
just as recent letters put an end to the
exploding boiler theory as an internal
cause for the disaster.
Nothing was heard to-day from the
court of inquiry, and the department is
still ignorant of its plans. In fact, the
only news coming direct from Havana
to the Navy Department during the
day was contained in the following
dispatch from Captain Sigsbee:
â¢â¢HAVANA, Feb. 26. â Have succeed
ed in making arrangements by which
bodies may be sent to Key West in
hermetically sealed zinc cases. Refer
to Forsythe for burial in Key West.
Probable that bodies hereafter cannot
be recognized. Probable that bodies
will not .remain intact. Condition of
bodies requires immediate action. Jen
kins and Merritt may be recognized by
uniform. Can secure health permit at
Key West to land the bodies there.
Divers cannot get down aft after
bodies this morning. Much debris.
Will clear it away. Wainwright placed
in charge of wrecking matter."
The following reply was sent:
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â T0 Sigs
bee, Havana: Referring to your tele
gram of this date, send bodies that
may hereafter be recovered to Key
West for burial. Send by Bache.
"LONG."
To Key West a dispatch was for
warded as follows:
"WASHINGTON. Feb. 26.â T0 Naval
Station, Key West: Sigsbee ordered to
send bodies that may hereafter be re
covered to Key West for temporary
burial. Will arrive in hermetically
closed zinc cases. Make necessary ar
rangements. Bodies will arrive by
Bache. LONG."
It is believed at the department that
there are probably in the neighborhood
of fifty bodies remaining to be dis
covered and extricated from the wreck.
Only One Boat at Havana.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The dis
patch boat Fern will be left /or the
present to safeguard American inter
ests in Havana harbor and Lieutenant
Commander Wainwright will represent
the Government in wrecking opera
tions. Secretary Long told me to-night
that he had not determined when to
dispatch the Montgomery or Nashville
to the relief of the Fern. It is the gen
eral impression that no orders will be
issued for the dispatch of a ship on a
peace mission to Havana for some time.
FITTING
OUT THE
WARSHIPS
Vessels of the Navy Now
Being Prepared for
Action.
Monitors Are Also Assigned by
the Department for the De
fense of Various Ports
on the Atlantic.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Be
sides providing for the naval defense
of the port of New York, the Navy
Department inaugurated measures to
day for replenishing the magazines of
men-of-war attached to the North At
lantic station, and for securing a large
supply of coal. Secretary Long issued
orders soon after his arrival at the
Navy Department this morning to
Captain Nicol Ludlow, commanding the
Terror, directing him to take his ves
sel from Hampton Roads to New York,
and to remain there until further or
ders. Captain Ludlow appreciates the
reason for the orders is the desire of
the administration to protect New
York. It is believed by the Navy De
partment that the only contingency to
be feared in the event of hostilities
would be the sending of an armored
cruiser to an undefended port to do as
much damage as possible and then get
away. It is proposed by the authori
i ties to keep the North Atlantic squad
; ron in Florida waters, and it is, there
; fore, considered advisable to have
Charleston and Port Royal defended
by the Amphirite, Baltimore, Washing
ton and Norfolk by the Puritan, which
will drop down to Hampton Roads
within the next two weeks; Philadel
phia by the Miantonomoh, which will
shortly be placed in commission, and
New York by the Terror.
These monitors, the department be
lieves, can take care of any cruisers
which might be sent against the ports
named. The department's scheme for
the defense of ports along the New
England coast has not yet developed,
but it is expected within the next week
that precautionary measures will be
adopted. It was admitted at the de
partment to-day that the movement
of the the Terror was the result of the
departure of the Spanish cruiser Viz
caya from New York yesterday.
"The department proposed," said an
official to me, "to send the Terror to
New York, and would have done so
several days ago had it not been that
it did not care to menace the Spanish
visitor. Had the Vizcaya's captain an
nounced that he intended to remain an
indefinite period in New York harbor,
the department would at once have
sent the Terror."
I understand that orders to fill the
magazines of the vessels of the North
Atlantic squadron are in accordance
with the department's desire to be pre
pared. It was said to-day that many
of the ships had thus been engaged
in target practice and had thus shot
away many rounds of ammunition.
The department proposes to assemble
all additional supplies of powder and
shell at the New York and Norfolk
navy yards and at the Key West sta
tion, where ships will take them on
board.
Although it is generally believed that
the navy has not sufficient ammuni
tion to fight a battle, I was informed
to-day there was enough on hand to
fill up all of the ships of the navy, with
a little to spare as a reserve.
Commander R. B. Bradford, chief of
the Bureau of Equipment, appeared
j before the House Naval Committte to
j day and urged that the committee ap
: propriate $100,000 to be immediately
â¢ r 'lable for the purchase of coal for
the naval ships. Commander Bradford
explained that the appropriation made
* for the present fiscal year would soon
be exhausted and that additional
money would soon be needed.
In case the committee should author
ize an appropriation and it should pass
there is reason to believe the depart
ment would immediately purchase
large quantities of coal to be shipped
to Key West and other points picked
out by Commander Bradford on his re
cent trip along the Florida coast. I
understand Commander Bradford has
urged upon- Secretary Long the neces
sity of securing coaling stations
as the most important necessity in case
of a naval war.
Shipments of guns from the Wash
ington gun foundry to the Brooklyn
Navy Yard, orders for which were is
sued yesterday by the Navy Depart
ment, as told in the Herald this morn
j ing, will begin next week, me foun
dry will equip guns with sights and
! generally put them in condition for im
| mediate service before shipping them.
j The first lot to go will consist of twen
ty-two 5-inch guns and mounts and
j ten 6-lnch guns and mounts. Four-
I teen of the 5-inch guns were manufao
i tured for the cruiser Chicago and six
of the 6-inch guns for the cruiser At
lanta. In case of immediate emergen
', cy it is recognized by department of
ficials that it would be impossible in
j the present stage of repairs to the Chi
cago and Atlanta to arm them and the
weapons intended for them would con
sequently be placed on auxiliary
cruisers. _^_^^_________
WILLIAM TALKS
OF THE DISASTER.
Germany's Emperor Evidently Be
lieves It Was Solely Due to
an Accident.
BERLIN, Feb. 26.â With the carnival
ball on Tuesday, the season's big court
fetes ended. At this ball, which was
attended by the whole of the Embassy
and 2000 guests, court etiquette is al
ways relaxed. The Emperor chatted
with the Embassadors and others quite
informally. His Majesty conversed at
length with United States Embassador
White and spoke admiringly of the
children of Mrs. Wlborg, a niece of
Secretary Sherman. He said it was a â¢
revelation to himself and the Empresi
to meet such well-bred American chil
dren, as the latter are generally be
lieved in Germany to be lacking in
manners. "*.nt," the Emperor added,
"if the Wiborgs are the typical Ameri
can children, then the latter have been
grossly maligned." His Majesty also
spoke of the American comic papers
and the excellent drawings in them.
The conversation turning upon the
loss of the battle-ship. Mr. White
thanked the Emperor for his telegram
of sympathy sent to President McKln
ley, particularly because it was sent in
English and was thus understood bjr
every one in America.
Emperor William pooh-poohed Count
Yon Aran's remarks in the Reichstag,
criticizing President McKinley for his
alleged lack of courtesy in not fram
ing his reply in German, saying the
cases were not similar. His Majesty
further remarked that the disaster wag
doubtless due to an unlucky accident
and not to the work of a Spanish fa
natic, adding that all the evidence
pointed that way.
Incidentally, the Emperor said he
had been misrepresented by some
American newspapers as to his dislike
for Americans. On the contrary the
Emperor said he liked many traits in
the American character.
HASTENS THE WORK
ON THE PRINCETON.
Chief Constructor Hichborn Pays a
Visit to the New Gunboat.
NEW YORK. Feb. 26.â Chief Con
structor Hichborn reached Camden
late this afternoon and made his way
quietly to the shipyard of John Dia
logue & Son at Kaighns Point, where
the gunboat Princeton is being built.
He and Mr. Dialogue held a consulta
tion privately, left the office and went
unaccompanied aboard the Princeton.
After the inspection of the gunboat
Hichborn left the shipyard at once,
reached Philadelphia by the nearest
ferry, and no one seemed to know what
became of him. In fact. Mr. Dialogue
seeemed unwilling to even admit his
visitor's identity, but finally did so.
The Princeton has been lying in the
Delaware, receiving but little attention
for several months.
"The Government was in no hurry
for the boat," explained Mr. Dialogue
to me to-night, "so we attended to pri
vate work. Last week we received or
ders to make some alterations in the
placing of guns, and have been attend
ing to them."
"What had the Chief Constructor to
say about the Princeton to-day?" I
asked.
"Nothing, only that the Government
wants her," he added.
"Did you fix a time for delivery?"
"Not definitely: she is practically
ready for sea," said he, "all except re
pairs."
"Will she be finished and ready for
sea in a week?" I asked.
"In very little over that time," he ad
mitted. "An extra force will go to
work Monday morning, possibly to
morrow."
Mr. Dialogue is at tHe shipyard to*
night as a result of Hichborn's visit.

DEFENSES FOR THE SEABOARD
SAN FRANCISCO
HARBOR IS NOW
WELL PROTECTED
But the Work of Strengthening the
Fortifications Proceeds, and One
More Big Gun Is Hauled
to Fort Point.
The army leaders no longer try to
withhold the information that war
preparations are progressing. Activ
ity is the rule at all the military garri
sons of the country. The work neces
sary for the defense of San Francisco
is going forward with commendable
rapidity. There is still talk among the
timid and easily excited that a Span
ish fleet could stand six miles outside
the heads and cause great destruction
of property by throwing high explo
sives into the city. The fact is not
taken .into account that on the bluff
back of Fort Point there are five 12
inch modern high power guns. Each
gun, a rifled breech-loader forty-two
feet in length and weighing fifty-eight
tons, can throw a steel projectile
weighing 1000 pounds a distance of ten
miles. This formidable battery could
be trained on any ironclad that should
attempt the shelling of San Francisco.
A Spanish fleet outside would have
more than the guns of the land to en
counter. The battle-ship Oregon, the
cruisers Charleston, Philadelphia and
Yorktown, and the coast defense ves
sel Monterey could steam out and en
gage the enemy. . The business of
shelling the city of San Francisco at
long range would be attended with con
siderable peril to the shelling party.
The engineer, ordnance and quarter
master corps of the United States army
are working together to hasten the
work of putting in new guns. One of
the 10-inch breech loading rifles for the
Fort Point disappearing battery, which
arrived at the Southern Pacific freight
yards last Thursday, was placed on an
immense truck early yesterday morn
ing and hauled a good part of the way
to the point of destination. The truck
was drawn by forty horses. The gun
Mas taken from Fourth and King
streets, along Fourth to Market, thence
to O'Farrell and out to Polk street,
along Polk to Vallejo, thence to Van
Ness avenue, along the avenue to Green
street and thence along Octavia, Un
ion, Greenwich, Fillmore and Francisco
to the Presidio reservation.. The weight
of the gun is thirty-four tons and the
contracting draymen, Morton & Co., !
had to be careful of the street pave
ment and the car tracks. When these
two guns are put in place there will
be five in the disappearing battery.
From the Fort Point position the fire
of five 12 and five 10 inch rifles could be
directed against an enemy's war fleet
seeking to enter the harbor of San
Francisco. The 12-inch rifles planted
on the high bluff at Lime Point, Just
across the channel, could join the guns
at Fort Point in standing off the en
emy. Should a large fleet menace the
city the fire of the big rifles could be
supplemented by the dynamite guns,
the mortars and the 15-inch smooth
bores. There should be no alarm about
San Francisco. As matters stand to
day the city is well defended. The"
chief requirement is a forec of trained
artillerymen to handle the modern
guns. Much work in the way of elec
trical apparatus and range finding
methods remains to be done before the
guns can be worked up to the modern I
methods of operation, but the guns are
there and the ammunition is on hand.
The rifles can be trained for direct fire
and a good many military men of ex
perience believe that the direct fire
principle is better for actual conflict at I
short range than the modern system of
calculation by the range finder.
Quite a joyous commotion was caused
in army circles of this department yes
terday by a report that the House of i
Representatives had passed the bill au- 'â 
thorizing the creation of two additional '
regiments of artillery. There is hardly i
a doubt that the bill will pass some
tint* this session, but there was a feel- I
ing of disappointment when it was i
found that the measure had not been â 
called up in the House.
Increase of the artillery by two regi
ments will promote Lieutenant-Colonel I
E. B. Williston of the Third and Lieu
tenant-Colonel William Sinclair of the
Fifth to the full rank of colonel. The
majors who will be advanced to the
grade of lieutenant-colonel are: W F I
Randolph. Third; Tully McCrea, Fifth-
Frank G. Smith, Second, and James G
Ramsay, Fifth. The captains who wili
be advanced to the rank of major are-
Frank W. Hess, Third Artillery :
George W. Crabb, Fifth; Charles Mor
ris. Fifth; J. W. McMurray, First-
John W. Dillenback, First; James B
Burbank. Third; Samuel M. Mills
Fifth; John P. Story, Fourth; William
P. Voss, Second, and George G. Gren
ough. Fourth Artillery.
The addition to the army of two I
THE DISPATCH BOAT FERN.
regiments or twenty-four batteries of
artillery would probably give this de
partment four more batteries. It is
understood that a detail will be made
from each battery of the existing five
regiments to form the nucleus for the
new organizations and that the present
regiments will receive recruits equal to
the number contributed to the new or
ganization?.
Since it seems settled that the in
crease of the artillery will be allowed
there is a growing sentiment in favor
of reorganizing the infantry regiments
in accordance with modern military
tactics. The system of infantry regu
lations in the United States army was
cast aside many years ago by European
armies. It is obsolete and wholly out
of place since rapid fire guns of long
range have been accepted in place of
the old muzzle-loading muskets. The
infantry desire the new battalion or
ganization of three battalions to a regi
ment. Each battalion should consist of
four companies and each company of
200 men, making the battalion 800
strong and the strength of the regiment
2400 men. The regiment would then be
about equal to the brigade strength
during the war of the rebellion. Since
the introduction of quick-firing breech
loading magazine guns with a deadly
range of 2000 yards troops must be de
ployed in long thin lines. The day of
massing is gone. The modern battle
unit is the company of 200 men. In
extended order 800 is the greatest num
ber that one man should immediately
command. The scheme of reorganiza-
tion was recommended by Generals
Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Schofleld
and by many other officers of distinc
tion. As a measure of economy in or
ganization the plan is highly commen
dable, as the number of effective men
would be largely increased without
adding to the number of commissioned
officers. Since the United States is pre
paring for war it is held that a reor
ganization of the infantry is essential.
In this particular line the National
Guard is a step in advance of the re
gular army.
General Shafter, commanding the De
partment of California, has directed
that detachments of troops shall leave
Angel Island, Fort Mason and Fort
Baker to-morrow and proceed to the
Presidio for the purpose of mounting
guns on the reservation. The troops
will report to Colonel Miles, command
ing the post at the Presidio.
Lieutenant William S. McNair, Third
Aritllery, has been directed to report
to the commanding officer of the Pre
sidio for duty in mounting guns.
Lieutenant Babbitt of the Ordnance
Corps visited the fortifications at Fort
Point yesterday and examined the guns
and carriages.
The detail of troops from Angel Is
land. Lime Point and Black Point is
made becauso the batteries of the Third
Artillery permanently stationed at the
Presidio cannot perform all the duty
required at the fortifications.
PRIEST RECEIVES AN
INFERNAL MACHINE.
Father Weber's Remarks Anent the
War Crisis Excites
Some Crank.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â Father Web
er, whose recent declaration at Rond
out, that in case of war between the
United States and Spain, it would be
come the duty of Roman Catholics to
fight on the side of Spain, has been
officially requested to leave the diocese.
This fact was given out to-day by
Father Connolly, secretary to Arch
bishop Corripan, who explained that
had Father Weber belonged in this dio
cese, instead of in the West, whence
he came, he would have been subjected
to shÃrp discipline.
A package addressed to Father
Weber, containing an infernal machine,
was received at the Kingston postofflce
to-day. One of the clerks noticed that
a black powder came from the poorly
wrapped packing. He carefully opened
it. After the lid had been removed a
box was discovered. It was arranged
in two compartments. Attached to the
lower portion of the box lid was thick
sandpaper and in the upper apartment
matches and about a pound of powder,
which would have been ignited by the
removal of the lid quickly. The powder
was between layers of cotton and a
substance thought to be dynamite was
in the bottom of the box.
The package was sent from Wash
ington.
Torpedoes Being Planted.
PORTLAND, Me., Feb. 26.-It is evi
dent from appearances that some o'
the torpedoes which have been stored
at Fort George, in Portland harbor
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1898.
are being planted in the harbor. For
several nights a tug has made trips
to the old fort and lights have been
seen moving about above the chan
nel at the entrance to the harbor. If
such operations are in progress it is
being done under direction of the local
board of Government engineers, who
are silent in regard to the matter. At
Portland Head is a torpedo operating
station cut from solid masonry and
extending to the water's edge.
MUCH DEPENDS
UPON THE REPORT.
Before Increasing the Navy Con-
gressmen Desire to Know How
the Maine Was Sunk.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â Members
of the Senate and House Committees on
Naval Affairs are anxiously awaiting
definite information regarding the sink
ing of the battle-ship Maine. The out
come of the investigation will* have an
Important bearing upon the action of
the committees toward increasing the
naval establishment. The sub-commit
tee of the House having the present
appropriation bill in charge has decided
to postpone for the present considera
tion of the increasing clause until a full
report comes from Havana,
Upon this will largely depend
whether the Maine Is to be replaced
and other battle-ships authorized. If
the theory of accident prevails many
members of Congress will be inclined
to oppose the provision for more ves
sels on the ground that we are not y*Â»t
fully acquainted with the safest meth
ods of caring for those we havp. If
it is shown the Maine was sunk by an
outside explosion it is probable not only
will there be a far superior ship to the
Maine authorized, but one other high
class fighter.

Heavy Shipment of Shot
and Shell From Water
town Arsenal.
Twenty=Five Carloads of Ammuni=
tion for Heavy Guns to Be
Hurried to Southern
Ports.
BOSTON, Feb. 26. â Twenty-five
freight cars are being loaded at the
Watertown Arsenal with shot and
shell for Southern ports. The work of
loading was begun shortly before noon
to-day by a dozen men, and up to a
late hour this evening three cars had
been packed. The work will be con
tinued until the last car is loaded.
The shot and shell are for 3-inch, 10
inch and 12-inch rifles and 12-inch
mortars.
Major James W. Reilly refuses to
talk. Even Major Reilly's closest
friend could not ascertain what his
special secret order from Washington
was, so that his silence led every per
son at the arsenal to believe the order
was of the utmost importance. One of
the lieutenants at the arsenal was
known to call at the quartermaster's
and commissary's office in Boston
during the morning hours, and that
visit was a significant one.
Up to noon everything went smoothly
about the spacious grounds, but about
that hour the hug<= gates between the
Fitchburg Railroad tracks and the
sidetrack entrance to the arsenal were
thrown open. About a dozen men' had
been ordered to that section of the
ground situated on the west side of
the erecting shop. Among them were
four or five soldiers connected with
the arsenal. They had been there a
short time when Major Reilly put in
an appearance. About eight or ten of
the freight cars were then backed on
to the arsenal sidetrack under the su
pervision of H. C. Fisher, freight
agent for the Flu hburg Railroad. This
move gave the men the impression
that something unusual was about to
occur, but Major Reilly kept his own
counsel.
The first order given was to take
from the old storehouse a derrick
which had been there for years. It was
brought to one of the freight cars and
then set up beside the track. The shot
and shell were then lifted into the cars
one by one. They weigh from 300 to
1000 pounds, so the work was hard and
tedious. The major superintended the
work during the greater part of the
afternoon. The ammunition is stored
in different parts of the yard, some be
ing in the south storehouse near the
officers' quarters, machine shop, and
about the grounds. The material
which is shipped will carry a distance
of from six to ten miles. The 8-inch
is intended to carry six miles, the 10
inch eight miles and the 12-inch ten
miles. The loading of the freight cars
is the first outside sign of the activity
that has been displayed at the arsenal
Bince the Maine disaster. There seems
to be no doubt in the minds of the
hundreds of men employed there that
war is inevitable. Not since the Civil
War has such a large order for shot
and shell been received at this place. It
is expected that an extra force will be
put at work immediately in order to
finish the work on gun carriages
which are under construction. The
shipping will be done under the direc
tion of the Fitchburg Railroad of
ficials, and it is said that the twenty
five cars will be sent in different direc
tions aJong the Atlantic coast in the
South.

STRENGTHENING
THE DEFENSES
OF NEW YORK
Submarine Explosives to
Guard the Harbor and
Approaches.
Torpedoes and Big Guns to Be Added
to the Batteries and Complete
Protection Afforded Against
Any Outside Foe.
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â 8y order of
Brigadier-General John M. Wilson,
chief of engineers, active steps are be
ing taken for the defense of New York
harbor with the available supply of
submarine explosives. The greatest
secrecy is maintained in connection
with the work, and it cannot be
learned how large is the number of ex
plosives already in position in the har
bor and on hand at Willets Point. I
am t*ild, however, that it is sufficient
to do a great deal of damage to a hos
tile fleet if judiciously disposed and
operated.
Submarine defense Is understood to
be well advanced at the entrance of the
Long Island Sound, the eastern ap
proach to New York, and the depart
ment is also in possession of facilities
for the protection of the Narrows and
lower bay. Electro-contact automo
bile torpedoes will play a large part
in the defense of the city. The elec
trical apparatus which operates them
is easily portable and weighs much
less than the explosive itself. The ex
plosive is provided with a rudder and
connected with the electrical battery
by a charged wire, which is long
enough to reach from the hidden loca
tion of the battery to the hostile ship.
After the explosive is planted in the
water its rudder is adjusted so as to
direct its course, and it is then pro
pelled, being still governed b-" the elec
trical apparatus, and its location is
made visible above the surface of the
water only by a tiny flag or "war
nose." The stationary mines are
planted just under the position occu
pied by a passing keel, and may be
fired either by simple contact or by a
charge from the main battery. The
planting of the stationary mines does
not involve the employment of many
men or much apparatus and may pro
ceed without amusing the suspicion*
of craft lying: near at hand.
In the opinion of the engineer and
ordnance experts of the War Depart
ment the harbor of New York is in a
fair state of defense although the planÂ«
of the department are yet very far from
being accomplished. The department
is endeavoring to follow on general
lines the recommendations of the Endi
cott board, in whose â  opinion were
necessary for the proper defense of the
city eighteen 8-inch, two 14-inch, forty
12-inch, twenty-seven 10-inch and fif
teen 8-inch guns and 144 12-inch rifled
mortars, distributed around the ap
proaches to the city. There are now in
position at Fort Hancock the fortifica
tions on Sandy Hook, two 15-inch and
one 8-inch pneumatic guns, two 12-inch
guns, four 10-inch guns and a mortar
battery of sixteen 12-inch mortars.
At the western end of Long Island
(Ports Wadsworth and Lafayette) some
10-inch guns are In position and four
batteries of 6 and 8-inch guns. On
Staten Island five 8-lnch guns and four
10-inch guns are nearly in readiness.
At the eastern entrance to the harbor
(Forts Slocum and Schuyler) are bat
teries of somewhat less strength than
those at the Narrows. The lack of
rapid-fire guns is greatly deplored by
the department. These guns, on ac
count of their relatively great power
and their rapidity of fire, constitute a
highly important element in coast de
fense. Their emplacements are com
paratively inexpensive and can be
rapidly constructed whenever the guns
and carriages are available.
The guns in position are inadequate
ly supplied with projectiles. There are
I said to be about 1000 projectiles on
Governors Island, and there are prob
i ably 1000 elsewhere in the country. Sev
eral outstanding contracts for projec
tiles are nearly ready for delivery, and
the department Is in position to rap
idly furnish itself with sufficient sup
plies from numerous manufacturers in
this country and by purchase abroad.LONDON ON

LONDON, Feb. 26.â London Is in the.
throes of the hottest campaign in its
history, the contest for seats in the
London County Council completely
throwing into the shade even the keen- j
est-fought general parliamentary elec- j
tions. For three weeks past the fight
has been ragring alike in Belgravia and
Whitechappel. Nightly there are scores
of meetings attended by Cablfiet Min
isters and "front benchers" of both i
parties. Peers and peeresses, common

mats, judges, doctors and labor agita
tors are all involved. For the 118 seats
to be filled on March 3 there are 240 .

National issues have been included in
the fiKht in a manner hitherto unknown
in municipal politics, until it has be
:ome a square battle between the Un- .
ionists and Liberals, under the titles
moderates" and "progressives."
Both sides have been attempting .to
draw an analogy between the opposi
tion's aims and those of Tammany
Hall, parading Tammany as an awful
example of the corruption which may :
ipected in London when the other \
a gets into power. Barrels of j
y are being spent on both sides, i
tiangs of roughs have been hired to
break up meetings and hundreds of
disreputables are being brought into
<m from elsewhere to imperson
>ters who are at present at sea or
otherwise incapacitated from voting in
person.
James Bryce, member of Parliament
for the South Division of Aberdeen,
Liberal, author of "The American Com
monwealth," etc.. and the president of.
the Board of Trade in the Rosebery
Ministry, has been in the thick of the :
fight, telling everyone what he knows
about Tammany. Referring to the
charge of Sir John Lubbock, M. P., for
London University, Liberal-Unionist,
that the extravagance of the munici
pal government of New York under
Tammany is due to commercial enter
prise and financial speculations, he j
said:
"A more strictly practical body of :
men than the boss and his henchmen :
have not existed in the world whether
for salaries or jobs."
The campaign is not lacking in amus
ing incidents. John Burns, the labor
leader, in a recent speech, referred to
the peeresses who have been canvass
ing in th^ Battersea district as "scented
.lis."
i Hi Tuesday, after a hard day's can
vass, Lady Denbigh dropped into the
London County Council tea room to get
I of tea. Mr. Burns was in an ad
joining room and Lord Denbigh, slap
ping him on the shoulder, invited him
into the tea room, to the delight of all
the councilors, and said:
"Allow me to introduce you to one \
of the 'scented Delilahs.' "
Lady Denbigh shook hands heartily '
with the discomfited Mr. Burns and
thanked him for all the nice remarks i
he had been making about her.
By the way, Mr. Burns' "scented De- .
!iiahs".include the Duchessof St. Albans,
thf* Marchioness of Londonderry, the
Marchioness of Bristol, the Countess of
Denbigh, the Countess of Jersey, Count- i
ess Waltengrave, ' Countess Cadogan,
the fountess of Onslow, the Countess
of S.rlbourne and a hoet of high-born
society dames.
The lists of candidates for seats in
the London County Council is Interest
ing and ought to make the new Council
a second guild Chamber. The candi
dates include nine Peers, four sons of
Peers, ten Barons, three privy Council
ors, eight officers and members of the
House of Commons and clergymen in
profusion, twenty "gentlemen" and a
sprinkling of doctors and lawyers.
The War Office scheme for the re
form of the British army, which was
explained in the House of Commons
on Friday by W. St. J. Broderick, Par
liamentary Secretary of the War
Office, seems to have greatly satisfied
the various factions. An essential fact
is that the scheme adds 23,000 men to
the army, the largest increase ever
proposed in Great Britain in times of
peace. It offers a certain number of
vists on a special payment of one
;:,g daily to partake in minor wars
or emergencies, enabling the War
, (ffice to dispatch 10,000 men on expedi
uithout calling upon the main
reserve. It increases the pay of all
efficients over the age of 19 by three-
The amount hitherto deducted
for rations, and promises that increas
ed effort will be made to procure
employment for reservists. Militia and
volunteer officers also become avail
able for the imperial service.
Great importance is attached to the
proposal to decentralize the war office
by conferring larger financial and initi
ative powers upon g-cneral officers,
thus obviating constant reference to
the war office. Another reform is the
resumption of big maneuvers, which
were dropped twenty-six years ago.
The whole additional coet will be 52,000
,-000 annually.
The present year promises to witness
the biggest boom In shipbuilding ever
knntvn and doubtless the ship-builders
of the T T nited States are arranging to
participate in the consequent demand
finished iron. steeL and machinery
of all descriptions. An idea of the
enormous amount of work on hand can
be formed from the fact that the Clyde
;i!one now has orders of 581,000 tons,
apart from the four big Cunard freight
boats which are said to be in nego
tiation.

RIVERSIDE, Feb. 26.â The morning
session of the Young Men's Christian
Association Convention began with a
paper by Grove F. Ekins of Sacra
mento, entitled, "Our Young Men of
To-Morrow Are the Boys of To-Day. "
Mr. Eklns spoke of the urgent need
of taking care of the boys before they
become tainted with sin. A paper by
W. E. Howard of Los Angeles on edu
cational work followed. It was an ad
mirable description of the work of the
Los Angeles association along this line.
"Spiritual Result in Educational
Work" "was discussed In a paper read
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1898.
by H. J. McCoy. Mr. McCoy touched
upon many useful points, and a lively
discussion of the whole subject of the
educational work followed.
The convention then resolved itself
Into a business association. The time
of the annual convention was changed
from October to the third week in Feb

terey: Henry French, San Jose; George

Maraton, San Diego; S. E. Holdon,

The convention passed a resolution of
sympathy with those who are suffering
in Cuba at the present time, and rec
ommended that Individuals of the as
sociation co-operate for their relief as
far as possible. The committee on the
State committee's report recommended
the engaging of a State secretary and
pledges were made for that purpose.
The following were elected as mem
bers of the State committee: David

The evening session was held in the

discussed was "An Evening With
Young Men." This was followed by on
address by Professor G. C. Baldwin of
Pomona College, which partook of the
nature of a retrospect of the history
and work of the association.
The convention virtually closed to
night as far as regulnr work is con
cerned. To-morrow the delegates still
here will attend services in the fore
noon. The convention has been one of
the best ever held by the Young Men's
Christian Association of California, and
a great deal of work of a substantial
character for the welfare of the society
was accomplished.
SUNDRY CIVIL
BILL NOT COMPLIED.
But Cannon Held the Floor With It
to the Exclusion of Other
Business.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2f>.â The House
did not complete the consideration of the
sundry civil bill to-day, but Chairman
Cannon held the floor with it until ad
journment, refusing to yield to Boutelle,
the chairman of the Naval Committee,
who was anxious to secure consideration
of the bill reported by his committee for
the relief of the victims and survivors of
the Maine disaster.
About twenty pages of the sundry civil
bill were disposed of to-day. Many ef
fort? wore made by different members to
inject river and harbor items into the bill,
three of them being successful; amend
ments appropriating $300,000 for Cleveland
harbor; >200.000 for Wilmington. Del., and
increasing the appropriation for Boston
harbor from JWO.OOO to $250,000 were
adopted. As contracts for this work
were authorized they were In order un
der the rules.
The End Is Near.
March 8 will wind up one of the great
est sales of Furniture ever heard of at
the Fattosien Company, Sixteenth and
Minion. They have been doing a rushing
business the last two months known
as the dullest months in the year;
the low cut in prices did it. People must
not fail to see Smith's carpets, going at

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 26.â The petition of
George E. Barron for a termination of
the trust created by the will of his fa
ther. Edward Barron, was denied by
Judge Hyland to-day, and there is but
little chance of a compromise of the
contest of Edward Barren's will being
effected. The decision Is as follows:
The petition of George E. Barron, filed
in this court on the Ist day of February,
1898 asking for a decree terminating the
trust bequest of $100,000 to the petitioner
herein and the creating of a new trust,
is denied for the following reasons:
All of the beneficiaries interested In
â aid fund are not before the court.
That the contingent Interest of the un
born children of George E. Barron must
he preserved until the death ot George
Barron.
All the parties in interest have not filed
their written consent.
The trust Is a valid trust. Its purpose
is not impossible.
The will of Edward Barron placed
$100,000 in a trust fund for the benefit
of George E. Barron, who was to have
the income during life, and at his death
it was to be divided among his children.
If George Barron died without any
children the money was to go to his
brother or the latter's heirs. The bal
ance of the estate, valued at $1.500,000.
with the exception of $200,000 for W. R.
Barron, another son, was given to Eva

KNIVES IN PRISON REFORM.
L! NTIL yesterday it had been a considerable pe
riod since news had come from San Quentin
of one convict shedding the blood of another,
using for the purpose a sharp and ready knife. In
deed, a reasonable hope had arisen that the harsh
policy of 'denying to the convicts the boon of going
about armed for battle had found favor in the eyes
of the governing officials. This hope has been
crushed. Yet let us not look on the dark side. Let
us rather congratulate ourselves that there is still
deference to public opinion great enough to cause
the withholding from the convicts the comfort of
carrying revolver?, and that the blessed privilege of
lugging a slungshot through their daily routine is
not theirs. The public does not wish to be severe.
It remains out of reach of the gleaming blades, and
if there is anything in prison reform which makes
imperative the practice of allowing convicts a chance
to carve their neighbors, well and good. The public
does not profess skill in the science of penology.
But as a man even in prison has rights, it is clearly
meet and proper that it a portion of the convicts
are to have knives all ought to have them. The
tendency to show partiality has more than once cre
ated trouble among the inmates of restraining insti
tutions.
DAMSEL, DIMPLE, DAMAGE.
THE girl from whom nature has withheld the
boon of a dimpled cheek is apt to pine for one.
Helen Brooks of Denver came into the world
handicapped by the absence of this adornment, and
as she grew to years of indiscretion her yearning
to be thus ornamented developed into a passion.
Helen had visions of her own loveliness enhanced
and glorified as it would be by the presence of a
dimple, a cute little depression deepening with each
smile and seeming to radiate beauty as a hole created
in the placid bosom of a frogpond by the casting of
a pebble throws about itself a series of shimmering
rings. So Helen went to a doctor who claims the
ability to create dimples while you wait, and Helen
bought a dimple. She still has it, but it seems to
her a misfit. As she stands before the glass in con
templation of what should be her chief facial attrac
tion she is conscious of an inward pain. Sne pro
nounces the thing a scar.
To acquire a dimple is a simple matter. Anybody
may take a shoemaker's awl and punch into her own
damask cheek as many dimples as she thinks it will
conveniently hold. However, when a dimple comes
it is not a transitory affair. It has the element of
permanence. The only way to get rid of it is to
have the countenance amputated. Helen is not, ap
parently, a girl much given to habits of thought, but
that this course would be a greater mar to comeli
ness is probably clear even to her. Possibly Helen
got tired of seeing herself making dimpled grimaces
at herself every time she glanced at a mirror. It may
be that the sudden stoppage of the family clock
whenever she sought to read the time of day became
annoying. At any rate Helen sued the dimple ar
chitect and builder for damages.
It is to be hoped that she will recover the full
sum asked. It is unlikely, However, that she would
be wise enough to invest it properly, and therefore
a little friendly counsel in advance will not be amiss.
She ought to spend a part of the money in getting a
copy of that valuable work, "How Not to Be a Fool,
Even if One of Our Sex, and With Never a
Dimple," the joint product of Ruthie Ashmore and
Charlotte Smith. Of course the most faithful reading
will not remove the cavity already obtained, but it
may induce Helen to refrain from indulgence in
more freaks of idiocy until she sinks into a dimpled
dotage and is no longer responsible.
No report that men are dying by scores along the
Klondike trail serves to discourage the eager throng
bound in that direction. Each man goes with the
happy assurance that fortune awaits him, and that
the others whose bones bleach by the pathway once
were inspired by similar notions does not in the
least check the spirit of the gold-seekers. Human
faith is a queer thing.
Acquittal of the persons arrested for violating the
pool ordinance seems still to be accomplished with
the old facility. It may be explained for the benefit
of those not familiar with the matter that acquittal
in these cases is no indication of innocence.
Certain press correspondents have been warned to
leave France, and it might be a comfort to absent
themselves long enough to be able to express their
minds freely concerning the way people are acting
over there now
FOLSOM BOULEVARD BONDS.
I"" 1 HE fate which has overtaken the bonds author
ized by vote of the people of Sacramento
County for the construction of a boulevard be
tween that city and Folsom ought to sen'e as a no
tification to county officials throughout the State
that bond schemes must be carefully considered be
fore they are placed before the public. In the case
of the Folsom boulevard public sentiment in Sacra
mento County was almost unanimous. But at the
very outset of the bonding project the District At
torney rendered an opinion to the effect that it
would be impossible to carry it out on the lines pro
posed.
In their eager desire to put the scheme through,
however, the people appealed from their District At
torney to the Attorney-General, who adopted an op
posite view of the law. In accordance with the
latter's opinion the work was undertaken, an election
was held and the people voted to bond the county to
the extent of $75,000.
In due time the bonds were offered for sale. The
highest bidders were N. W. Harris & Co. of Chicago.
They offered $76,012 for the entire issue, conditional
upon its validity being indorsed by their attorneys.
Shortly afterward word was received that they had
submitted the question to Judge Dillon, the famous
bond lawyer of New York, and that he had pro
nounced the entire issue worthless on the ground that
under our constitution the property of municipali
ties cannot be taxed for county road purposes. This
was exactly the point raised by District Attorney
Ryan at the beginning and the point overruled by
Attorney- General Fitzgerald when he took a hand in
the controversy.
The result is that the popular scheme of construct
ing a boulevard from Sacramento to Folsom, a work
which the people favored by a vote of five or six to
one. has been brought to a standstill. What the
authorities of Sacramento County should have done
before entering upon the enterprise was to have se
cured opinions from other lawyers than the District
Attorney and the Attorney-General. It would have
paid them, as is now manifest, to have consulted
Eastern experts upon the subject. Had they pro
cured an opinion from some lawyer recognized as an
authority by the bond buyers a great deal of expense
and trouble might have been saved.
The matter will be taken to the local Supreme
Court before the boulevard project 13 abandoned,
however, and it is hoped that that tribunal will not
interpret the law as it has been interpreted by Judge
Dillon. The constitution is not at all plain, but it
must be confessed that if municipalities can be taxed
for county road purposes a certain inconsistency will
be introduced into the organic law. Counties and
municipalities are made by the constitution distinct
in many cases, and in none so pointedly as in tax
ation. The main point in the case ought to be, Would
the Folsom boulevard be entirely a county road?
If it is a county road in part only a new issue of
bonds might solve the difficulty.
A WORD TO MOYOR PHELAN.
\A AYOR PHELAN can best employ this day
/ \ of rest by passing in review certain acts of
his official life and testing them by the
standards of conduct which he accepts and honor
ably strives to live up to in private. A man so es
timable as a citizen should be equally estimable as a
Mayor. He who acts with decorum at home and
in the clubs should act with dignity in office.
Mayor Phelan knows right from wrong. He dis
tinguishes clearly the difference between propriety
and impropriety in all social affairs, and it is reason
able to assume that if he will give the subject some
consideration he will be able to decide with an equal
clearness what he should do and what he should
leave undone in the highest function to which he has
yet been called â that of acting as the chief execu
tive of the city.
Mayor Phelan of late has permitted himself to be
held up before the public as the friend and ally of the
most disreputable gang known to San Francisco.
He has allowed himself to be made the pet, as it
were, of yellow journalism and has shown a willing
ness to pose in that attitude before the public. He
has even stooped to become something like an ad
vertising agent and a solicitor of money for a dis
reputable newspaper, and has undertaken in public
and as Mayor to promote one of its schemes for ob
taining money from the people to be held "in trust."
When a committee was to be selected to take
charge of the entertainment to be given by the Min
ing Fair for the benefit of the families of the sailors
who were killed by the destruction of the Maine,
Mr. Phelan, as Mayor of the city, was of course ap
pointed a member of that body. It was supposed
that he would attend the meetings of the committee
in something of an official character and would act
for the municipality as far as that was possible in the
work with which the committee was charged. It was
therefore with amazement the members of the com
mittee saw the Mayor appear before them to solicit
that the money raised by the entertainment should
be given, not to the immediate relief of the needy
families of the heroic dead, but to a monumental ad
vertising fund to be held in trust by the New York
Journal as a self-appointed trustee.
The action of the Mayor in this affair is the more
regretted by his friends and the more condemned by
the general public because the monumental adver
tising fund for which he appeared as solicitor has
already become a scandal. The Call has published
the information that the New York Journal in seek
ing to get men to take up contributions for this fund
sent to a Seattle correspondent this dispatch:
"Can you get some one among the wealthy people
of your city who will organize local committee for
national monument to the Maine's heroes on basis
of 10 per cent on all sums he collects?"
"Wealthy people" who solicit money from a pa
triotic and generous people ostensibly for patriotic
jiurposes and with a seeming liberality of their own.
but with the secret understanding of a 10 per cent
rake-off, are not esteemed by public sentiment either
from a political or a social point of view. Mayor
Phelan as a citizen, as a gentleman, as a man of
honor in private life, would never ask popular con
tributions for a cause that appeals to the noblest sen
timents of humanity and then pocket 10 per cent of
all he obtained.
Why, then, as Mayor of the city and in his official
capacity does he allow his name to be enrolled with
such men? Why does he act with them? Why does
he personally urge that money to be raised in San
Francisco for the families of the nation's heroic dead
should be turned from their immediate relief and de
voted to a trust fund which "wealthy persons" are
collecting on a basis of 10 per cent?
Senator Proctor announces that his visit to Ha
vana has no significance. This statement invests the
affair with importance. It must be remembered that
the Senator has studied diplomacy and has at least
progressed so far as to state frankly exactly what he
doesn't mean.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1898.
THE GOLDEN WEST EXPOSITION.
THE movement started by The Call for the cele
bration of the semi-centennial of the admission
of California to the Union by an exposition of
the resources and industries of the whole of that
Great West whose progress and development have
been the result of Californian initiative has now so
far advanced that it is being discussed in detail, and
differences of opinion are beginning to appear.
These differences will not in any way militate
against the success of the enterprise. It was inevit
able they should occur. Men who are most har
monious with respect to a desired object do not al
ways agree as to the best means of attaining it. The
more keen public interest becomes in the proposed
exposition the more numerous and the more diverse
will be the plans suggested for carrying it into effect
and making it successful, and every step to be taken
in the movement from this time on will require con
sideration, discussion and careful judgment in de
ciding upon it.
At present the main difference of opinion turns
upon the question of the time when the exposition
should be held. The semi-centennial of the admis
sion of California falls in 1900, but in that year
there are to be an. exposition in Paris and a Presi
dential election in this country. To the minds of
some persons the election and the Paris exposition
are reasons for postponing our exposition until the
following winter or possibly until the following sum
mer. To the minds of others, however, it seems that
it would be well for us to hold our fete in the year
named because of the very facts that lead some to
object to it.
It is argued that a Presidential election will in
crease the life and movement of the people, and that
we would profit from the activity and might induce
all the Presidential candidates to visit the fair. It is
also argued that an exposition in California in 1900
would have the effect of retaining at home thousands
of persons who would otherwise go abroad, and
would thus be beneficial by preventing the drain of
wealth from the country that results from wholesale
pleasure-seeking in foreign lands.
Nothing of the difference between these divergent
views is vital to the project itself. At a meeting of
citizens called by Mayor Phelan to consider the mat
ter this aspect of the enterprise was fully discussed
and the problem was very wisely left for future so
lution.
The committee adopted a resolution declaring it
to be the sense of the meeting that a fair be held
commemorative of the fiftieth anniversary of the ad
mission of California into the Union; that a commit
tee of fifteen be appointed by the Mayor to devise a
plan and submit it to a meeting of citizens subse
quently to be called, and that they be given discre
tion in determining in what year it would be most ad
vantageous to hold such exposition and as to the
character and scope of the enterprise.
This resolution amply covers the situation at pres
ent. The essential thing is to provide for an expo
sition which will serve as a commemoration of the
admission of California to the Union and spread
abroad the fame of the great thing? that have been
accomplished in the Golden West during the fifty
years of American occupation. In that project all en
terprising citizens can join, and it is encouraging to
note how many are doing so and how warm is their
interest in the work.
TO the relief of all lovers of truth and fair play the
farcical investigation of governmental charges
against Emile Zola has come to an end.
That the novelist should have received an ad
verse decision was to have been expected, and
those who followed the case closely were therefore
not surprised at the action of his judges. If the
trial has served no other purpose, it has made patent
to the world the astonishing state of corruption that
exists in the French nation, and it needed no prophet
to foretell that M. Zola would find it possible dur
ing the course of his trial to substantiate the state
ments made by him in his letter assailing the Gov
ernment.
The Dreyfus case is not one which concerns France
alone. It is one which concerns the whole civilized
world, for it must touch every man's sense of justice
when he asks himself, Is it possible that at the end
of the nineteenth century, in a free country, a man
may be cruelly sentenced upon evidence which
would have been considered insufficient for a lettre
de cachet during the last century, and would not
even be thought grave enough in a despotic state to
send the prisoner to Siberia? Emile Zola has de
monstrated that it is possible. Without any motives
of self-interest and at personal bodily risk he cham
pioned the cause of Alfred Dreyfus. Those who
know and admire him are aware that he did this
not because he felt that Dreyfus was innocent, but
because he knew it, and to have remained silent at
so important a time would have been foreign to his
principles.
The French Government has by its action in M.
Zola's case exposed itself to suspicion. It has
pleaded "reasons of state 1 ' for failing to obtain ma
te! ial evidence, for closing the doors whenever deli
cate and confidential matters were touched, and for
stopping investigation at a point when it was mani
festly incomplete.
Now France is calling out for the honor of the
army. It can only be said if this is really affected the
blow to the republic will be terrible. As the Panama
canal scandal defiled political life in France, so has
the trial of Emile Zola discredited law and justice in
the republic. We do not know what remains which,
a Frenchman can respect except his army. If that
now fails the desire for a change of government may
become irrepressible. Nor is this all. If it is seen
coming the temptation to divert the attention of the
country by foreign war will be well nigh irresistible.
A nice question of ethics has arisen at the City
Prison, and it is to be hoped that it will be settled
in accordance with approved principles of diplomacy.
A white man whom circumstances have forced be
hind restraining bars objects to being locked up with
some Chinese who pine under similar misfortune. It
is unfair to punish a prisoner in any way not pre
scribed by law, yet the protesting white man should
remember that the Chinese are probably experiencing
pangs as keen as his own.
There was once a man who had the ill-fortune to
be kicked down three flights of stairs and into the
street. When he gathered himself up from the pave
ment he remarked, as though a great light had
dawned upon him, "I can take a hint as well as any
body; I'm not wanted here." One difference be
tween this individual and Councilman Woodward of
Oakland seems to be that the latter fails to grasp a
situation which was readily discernible to the intel
ligence of the former.
When Uncle Russell Sage openly indulges in war
talk'it may be concluded that the good man is prepar
ing to get on the bear side of something.
THE ZOLf? AFFAIR.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
A. J. Waterhouse is not only a hu
morist with a happy faculty of drag
ging from almost any set of circum
stances material for a laugh, but he
can employ a facility of expression in
setting forth the sober truth. "When
he says in one of his weekly letters
that School Director Waller was heard
to remark that two San Francisco
school teachers, female, had been seen
drunk In the street, there is only one
of two conclusions to be reached. The
first is that the teachers were ob
served in this condition; the other,
that Waller lied. I cannot think that
even a Waller makes out a very good
case for himself in either event. Since
the election of that person to *a i>o=i
tlon for which he was in no way fitted
there has been but one chance lor him
to do a generous and gracious act, and
his mental and moral equipment seems
to have prevented him from grasping
it His early resignation would hays
been appreciated as Indicating a de
sire to promote the cause of education
and avert disgrace from the schools.
There Js something almost reprehen
sible In the conduct of the local pick
pocket. His persistency in extract
ing the purse of the stranger and bor
rowing the watch of the visitor with
evident intent not to return it, is bad
enough. The real lack of considera
tion, however, is manifest toward the
police. Anybody desirous of infor
mation can ascertain by inquiry at de
tective headquarters that the pick
pocket has been chased to other fields;
that he went so swiftly as to cause
his coattails to crackle like the week
ly wash hung out in a gale; that he
will never come back, and that his one
fear is for the law as applied by the
police of this city.
There are reasons for fearing the de
cision of Judge Dillon in relation to
the invalidity of bonds Issued for the
proposed Folsom boulevard is based
on law. One reason for believing this
is that Judge Dillon is an able man.
He was for years on the United States
Circuit bench in lowa, and had the rep
utation of being a jurist of srreat acu
men and profound knowledge. He re
signed because a private practice urged
upon him offered many times the in
come of the Federal position, and went
to New York, where he took charge of
the Gould interests, and accepted also
the post of lecturer at Columbia Law
College. The second reason is that so
many laws are bad, and apparently de
signed to prevent progress. It is a
strange thing if the people who want
a road and are willing to pay for it
cannot have the privilege.
It is hard to understand why, when
for a hungry man to pick a crust from
a garbage barrel constitutes him an of
fender worthy of arrest, a man rated
at $60,000 can do the same thing and go
free. Of course it's all right, because
Judge Campbell says so-, yet I believe
the law. should at least be exactly re
versed. No rich man has any right to
assume the guise of a beggar nor to
garner crusts a decent tramp might ap
preciate. If it is wicked to annex a
discarded and not wholly attractive
scrap of bread when the impulse to do
so comes from a vacant stomach, it is
doubly wjcked when the act can be
traced to sheer meanness. Far be it
frc/m me to encourage the practice
whatever the motive, but I would sen
tence the famished individual driven to
it to a short series of square meals,
but, taking th<? other fellow, dump him
into the barrel, with the less noxious
refuse, head up the barrel and roll it
into the bay.
"Soapy" Smith's desire to be Chief
of Police of Alaska may be merely his
expression of belief in the old idea that
setting a thief to catch a thief is good
detective policy. If there is any virtue
in this scheme it follows that the big
ger the first thief, the quicker the sec
ond will be caught. Then with "Soapy"
in the former role there would be ab
solutely no show for escape. I have
known "Soapy" for many years. There
was never a queerer compound. He is
genial" and generous, enjoys a fight,
pays his debts, gives his last dollar to
whoever wants it and steals the first
dollar the next man is rash enough to
expose to view. I cannot regard it as
probable he will attain the honor he
seeks. He is asking too much. If the
people in a community not beyond the
vigilance committee period refrain from
hanging him he should regard their
consideration as a distinguished favor.
It does not seem to me that Bateman
Brothers are showing the public the re
gard that is due, and even that they
are putting that excellent and benign
body, the Supervisors, to unnecessary
trouble is tolerably clear. They have
been, granted until October 1 of this
year in which to finish their contract
to erect the Hall of Justice. Anybody
who has observed the ability of these
gentlemen not to push the work which
should have been complete last fall,
must conclude that they intend to fin
ish it when, as the crude but emphatic
expression is, they get good and ready.
An extension to next October simply
means that when that month arrives
the Batemans will be in a position to
accept another extension. This involves
useless formality. They might as well
have been given an extension to termi
nate with .'the rolling up of the heav
ens as a scroll. Perhaps I ought to un
derstand why a city tolerates such
foolishness, but I don't. There was
only one proper course to pursue, and
that was to annul the contract the mo
ment the fact became plain that Bate
man Brothers were ignoring its terms,
and exact from them every prescribed
penalty. There is no particular obli
gation to allow the Batemans to hand
down to their heirs and assigns for
ever one certain contract for making
a monkey of a large municipality.

forbearing, had taken note of the fact
that in that gallery the "Foto" stalked
shameless ; and unafraid. What else
could a Providence, bent upon perform
ing its duty and possibly under heavy
bonds, be expected to do?
It is always a pleasing thing to see
a good man get his dues, and there
fore I hail with acclaim the pardoning
of Major Moreland of Pennsylvania. If
he happen to find this out he will ap
preciate It, for amongst our mutual
joys Is that of being strangers. The
major In 1896 found himself in posses
sion of $450,000 belonging to somebody
else. The police noted the proximity
of the major to the cash, his clinging
disposition, and made bold to arrest
him. I happened to remark the inci
dent, and as about that time our own
Judge Wallace was sending purlolners
of purses containing 45 cents to serve
twenty years, feared the major would
have to be careful of his diet and not
expose himself to draughts or have dif
ficulty in living long enough to sur
vive his term. But in Pennsylvania
there is respect for the truly great. The
major got three years, as he was tired |
and willing to rest a while. Now that |
he has been in prison two-thirds of the
time he indicates a willingness to come
out, and the Governor accommodates
him. The major made one mistake.
He should have stolen half a million.
I hope he will bear this in mind and
not be guilty of another $50,000 short
age. Such indiscretion for a second
time might be enough to place him be
yond the pale of executive regard and
clemency.
"â¢God help Spain," exclaimed Admiral
Gherardl. -I hope the solicitude of the
gentleman will be of no effect. It may
be true that Spain will need help, but
she will not deserve it. Besides, if
this country undertakes to lick Spain
it does not want to go against odda
when the situation is naturally in its
favor.
Colonel Mosby is a much older man
than he would have been had he been
hanged at the time he first merited the
distinction. He is entitled now to all
the disrespect due a certain sort of old
age. When the colonel says that Spain
was right in the Virginius affair I take
the liberty of saying he talks as if his
recent accident had knocked out his
brains instead of an eye. He adds that
the United States or England would
have done the same thing as Spain,
wherein he wantonly slanders two na
tions, neither of which has done anything
to deserve it. England may at times
have a strange conception of her rights,
but she does not do more than maintain
them as they appear to her. The United
States, acting on the principle now
advocated by Mosby, would have re
duced her population considerably, and
I do not see how the Mosby feet could
have reached the ground save through
the breaking of the rope. For the
Virginius affair, a matter recently ex
ploited anew in the daily press, there
was no excuse. It was murder, and
the bodies of the victims were treated
to indignities such as might have been
expected had the captors been Apaches.
That the matter was settled on a
monetary basis has been a shame to
America ever since and accounts in
great measure for the Spanish notion
that we are an Inferior people. Colonel
Mosby indicates a willingness to lead
an army against the Spanish, but I
would rather have It led by somebody
else, almost anybody who might be
mentioned. But if war come, and hÂ«
get into hostile territory and suffer th*Â»
indignity of capture, the vision of his
own head adorning a pole, a jest for
the rabble, may not comfort his last
moments particularly, but it will work
within him a change of heart and dis
sipate the clouds of senility which seem
to have obscured his vision.
If Representative Mahaney of New
York ever comes out this way he can ex
pect at least one newspaper man to
hunt him up and do it with the object
of grasping his hand. Mahaney's at
tack on the heartlessness of the absurd
four hundred who danced merrily soon
after the Maine went down was a de
served tribute to their inutillty, Ido
not suppose they care much. It is not
probable that they read the papers
and certainly the Congressional Record
never intrudes in the sacred realm
where they fritter their lives away.
However, some member of the Guild
of Idleness might stray into the rudo
world, and by seeing a copy of Ma
haney's remarks be led to conclude that
he was not held in high regard, and so
induced to hurry back again.
Some time ago announcement was
made that the Rev. Mr. Wilson was en
deavoring to establish a home for re
spectaÃle girls. The plan struck me
as being an excellent one. There ia
no reason why the respectable girl
should not have a home. Undue at
tention seems to be paid to the girl
who is not hampered by the possession
of respectability. She can always find
a home. There are good women in
plenty who are consumed of anxiety to
rescue her and thus win a star for the
crown they expect to wear. I must
confess to a regard for the girl who
has managed to be upright. If she
happens to be without a place of shel
ter she should have a place provided.
It is no wonder as she sees arms ex
tended to her erring sister if she re
pine at her own lot. "feven in this ad
vanced age there should be some con
sideration for the one who still clings
to the rigid idea that there is merit
in being governed by propriety^ But
I do not see anything more about the
projected home. Is it possible that
charity awaits the time when the girls
shall no longer be among the respecta
ble?
Distressing reports come from the
South that there is an epidemic of kiss
ing in Atlanta. Still, strange as it
may seem, there is nothing said about
a panic such as usually accompanies
an outbreak beyond the control of
science, and there is a total absence
of quarantine restrictions. These, if
in force, could not be of the or
dinary kind anyhow. They would have
to be directed, not against attempts
to leave the stricken city, but against
frantic endeavors to break in. No fa
talities have yet been recorded, an in
teresting fact since it disproves the
malevolence of the various microbes
which are supposed to be transmitted
during the process of osculation.
Evidently there is a false impression
extant concerning the integrity of re
porters. Ido not see how this has
arisen. From an experience of yeara
I have gathered the notion that report-
ers are hard to buy. They have many
opportunities to sell themselves, but
they do not do it. I have lately heard
the charge from a lawyer that any re
porter could be bought. The man has
an idea now that he erred, or else his
mind is not subject to ideas. It struck
me as a peculiar charge anyhow, to
come from a lawyer, member of a craft
which is for sale to the highest bidder
always, and not reckoned a worthy
member until worth purchasing. I re
member a man named Johnson, who
was a reporter for me long ago on the
Denver Republican. He is dead now,
but there others of his type. He used
to get very drunk, but in the intervals
was a model of industry. Johnson was
the mining reporter. One day he
heard of a strike in a placer claim near
the town of Boulder and went to see
the owners about it. There were three
owners. One I have forgotten. The
second was a pillar in the church, but
should have been a pillar in the pen
itentiary. The third was a. poor pros
pector who worked while his partners
supplied a grub stake. Johnson found
the first two, but they begged him to
say nothing of the discovery. When
he wanted to know why, thoy ex
plained that the working partner was
in New Mexico; if he heard of the
strike he would want a full share;, if
they could keep him in the dark ha
w >uld sell out for a song. The prop
osition, I am glad to say, did not ap
peal to Johnson favorably. It seemed
to him an attempt at robbery and to
make himself accessory. Then the pal?
delicately broached the subject of a
brlbo. Would $500 be any object? Thia
whh (II J kn**w about it thon. John-
Bon turned In his copy, giving a full
account of the strike. He was wear
ing a Hhfibby overcoat at the time. The
facts were related to me by the "pillar, 1 '
who made a great show of indignation,
but failed to blush, and did not ap
pear to be pleased when I gave him
an opinion as to his moral status. There
are exceptions, of course, Just as there
are honest lawyers; but the reporter
who can be induced by the offer of
money to be unfaithful to the paper
employing him is despised among his
fellows and put upon the same plane
as the upright gentleman who offers
the bribe and shudders at the venality
of the press.
THE STRANGE PART OF IT.
I love to hear a certain learned friend of mine
orate
On our modern institutions and their dire, de
generate state.
When he talks about the drama, how he scores
the coryphees!
And asks how long the public will permit such
things as these!
He speaks of our performers as mere pigmies
in an age
Where there is no chance of viewing real
genius on the stage.
And the plays are less than trifling and the
wit which men should prize
To buffoonery has weakened, which must
needs demoralize â
But he goes to see 'em.
And the novels that are published! How he
puts 'em 'neath the lash
And wonders how the people can endure such
tawdry trash.
The authors and their managers without ro
morse he scores
And declares that they're "pernicious" or "un
mitigated bores."
He vows that they are callow save In cases
where we find
Too much sophistication for the really well
bred mind.
And he wishes for a' bonfire which as sustfn
ance would claim
Most volumes that have been and are becom
ing known to fame â
But he buys 'em.
And when he talks of politicsâ that's when his
flinty Ire
Into the tinder of my dull Intelligence strikes
fire.
He shows how politicians with their mechan
ism bold
Have quite usurped the places that nt.i'i;.
should hold.
And how Home wily people will by plots and
tunning snares
Rank with the great and righteous Jn the
national affairs.
With scorn he. tells me how these politicians
bad have made
What should be patriotism Into usury and
trade-
But he votes for 'em.

He rode in an English saddle, but the

INTENSE SUFFERING
From Dyspepsia and Stomach
Trouble.
INSTANTLY RELIEVED AND PERMANENTLY
CURED.
A New Discovery, But Not a Patent
Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remark-
able cure of acute stomach trouble and
chronic dyspepsia by the use of the new
discovery, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: The patient was a man who
had suffered to my knowledge for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate
seemed to sour and create acid and
gases in the stomach; he had pains like
rheumatism in the back, shoulder
blades and limbs, fullness and distress
after eating, poor appetite and loss of
flesh; the heart became affected, caus-
ing palpitation and sleeplessness at
night.
I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As
an experiment I finally bou%ht a fifty-
cent package of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at a drug store and gave them
to him. Almost immediate relief was
given, and after he had used four boxes
he wag to all appearances fully cured.
There was no more acidity or sour
watery risings, no bloating after meals,
the appetite was vigorous and he has
gained between 10 and 12 pounds in
weight of solid, healthy flesh.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold in drug stores,
yet I consider them a most valuable ad-
dition to any physician's line of reme-
dies, as they are perfectely harmless
and can be given to children or invalids
or in any condition of the stomach with
perfect safety, being harmless and con- j
taining nothing but vegetable and fruit |
essences, pure pepsin and Oolden Seal, j
Without any question they are the
safest, most effective cure for indiges- '
tion, biliousness, constipation and all j
derangements of the stomach however j
slight or severe.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold j
by druggists everywhere at fifty cents
tor full sized package. J
Moondyne there were not a few specta
tors who thought that the course was
so evenly contested that two flags
should have been ordered raised.
The course between McKinley and
Mercy May, although decided in favor
; of the former, was not received with
general approval.
In the puppy stake the course be
tween Mira Monte and Arrow, al
i though decided in favor of the last
1 named dog, should, in the opinions of
several experts, have been declared in
favor of Mira Monte.
But a judge's decision is always final,
and it is not considered sportsmanlike
to question it. Certainly, Mr. Bull de
cided without fear or favor, and, taken
as a whole, his awards were very sat
! isfactory and pleasing to the spectators.
The slipper made several blunders,
' but the mishaps were caused princi
pally by a new pair of slips which did
not work to the satisfaction of the gen
tleman who handled the leash. Doubt
less Mr. Taylor of Denver will show
vast improvement in slipping dogs
when he will have had a little more ex
perience. v:vÂ»;:
The hares astonished the local sports.

"duffer" the short-tails that ran before
the dogs were in fine condition, and
gave their pursuers a grueling run
from end to end of the big field, sev
! eral of them gaining their freedom by
I entering the escapes.

STANFORD WINS
THE THIRD GAME
Baseball Pyrotechnics and
Plenty of Bad
Plays.
The Alumni Nine Is Treated
Again to Some Bitter
Medicine.
College Men Sport on the Mud and
Dream of the National
Game.
When the umpire called play on the
Stanford-Alumni baseball nines yester
day afternoon at Central Park, there
were by actual accounting 200 specta
tors In the stands. Before half the
game was finished this number had
thinned down by half. At the close of
the ninth inning not more than 60 read
the score on the boards â Stanford, 19;
Alumni, 11.
From the standpoint of attendance
the college games this year can hardly
be termed glittering successes. Enthu
siasm is even lacking, and the players
act as if they wished it was over long
before the nine innings have been con
cluded. The game yesterday began by
the Alumni going out In one. two, three
order. Then Stanford worked the
stick for two runs. In the second in
ning the Alumni again failed to score.
It was now the Cardinals' time to cover
themselves with mud and glory, and
they certainly achieved gigantic Suc
cess, as to the first, by some beautiful
base sliding and, as to the second, by
shoveling up a pile of eleven runs.
Nothing but Red men coursed the
bases. Five balls, the aggregate cost of
which amounted to the money received
at the gate, floated over the several
fences, and broke the hearts of the
managers.
Losing balls was a trick, the key to
which Stanford's nine did not hold ex
clusive of all others. When the Alum
ni came to the bat in the third inning
they in turn began chasing from bag
to bag, and, aided by the errors of the
college men, they scored nine runs.
From this point the game dragged on
slowly for two hours and thirty min
utes. Twice the continuance of the
game was put in jeopardy, once when
the supply of balls gave out, and the
second time when a rain cloud threat
ened to drop on Central Park.
The game was featureless except for
the abundance of errors both sides
made.

SEBVIANS AT WAR.
Editor Piskulich Is Not Seriously
Injured by His Coming in Con
tact With Radulovich's Hand.
"Carrying the war into Africa" is but
child's play compared with the volcano
liable to break out between the Croatian
factions in this city when Editor L. W.
Plskulich of the Hrvatska Sloga returns
from his trip in the Slough City.
The cause of Editor Piskulich's sudden
departure to Stockton a few dayS ago
was given in The Call Thursday. Since
then his manager, J. R. Callahan, gives
another account of the fray, which is that
the good right hand of Radulovich did
not come in contact with the editor's face
but fell short several inches. The only
damage done to the Hrvatska Sloga was
the breaking of two panes of glass in the
office window.
But from present appearances this little
skirmish is only preliminary to a great
battle that is likely to take place on the
return of the editor from Stockton. In
the meantime Manager Callahan will in
voke the strong arm of the law to have
Radulovich "Jugged" for battery and an
attempt to commit divers offenses against
the peace and dignity of the colony of
Croatian* in the City and County of San
Francisco.
Be the outcome or the present trouble
what it may. it iÂ» certain that the Ser
vian colony iP split open, and all over the
sudden death of Samuel Martinovich, a
wealthy Montana miner, who was as
phyxiated in his room in the New Europe
House, on the night of his arrival in this
city. Martinovich was a man of means,
as the Coroner found among his effects
a draft for $1600. but not one dollar in
coin This is what has brought about the
trouble in the colony, as the friends of
the dead man allege that some person had
been to his room and took care of his
loose coin.
In this kettle of fish the names of R#.
dulovich, Bakulich and Piskulich are all
mixed up in a general mess over the
<k-ath of Martinovich.
And as ea<h faction has its friends it
is evident that a social split will follow,
if nothing more. Now that Callahan, the
manager of Hrvatska Sloga, has drawn
his Hibernian sword, there is apparently
no end to the Servian war short of com
plete annihilation of one or the other of
the warring faction*
In the meantime a sharp lookout is be
ing kept for the return of Editor Pisku
llch from the Slouch City, as he may stop
at Bonicia and procure from the United
States armory a few gatling guns. The
end is not yet.
MISSIONARIES
FOR THE KLONDIKE

Shortly after the Klondike excitement
in this city there arrived from the gold
fields Father Rene of the Society of
Jesus, who had been a tireless missionary
in the wilds nf Alaska.
In that country he was the assistant of
Father Tosi. who was prefect apostolic
of Alaska, hut on the sudden death of
that holy man one morning as he was
celebrating mass, Father Rene was ap
pointed to his position. He left this city
some weekfi ;igo and went to New York,
and from that city he sailed yesterday

FOUGHT OFF A BRUTE.
Olga Schnitzleln, a Pretty Girl,
Swears Out a Warrant for the
Arrest of Carl Hayes.
Olga Schnitzlein. a pretty girl 16 years
of age. whose parent? live at 933 Clay
street, swore to a complaint In Judge Joa
chimsen's court on Friday, for the arrest
of Carl Hayes on a charge of attempt-
Ing to commit a criminal assault upon
her. The bonds were fixed at JT>OOO.
The girl is employed by Mrs. Ros
enberg, 1518 Fell street, to take care of
her young children. Hayes is employed
by a grocer on Devisadero and Fell
streets and on Wednesday afternoon he
called at Mrs. Rosenberg's to deliver
some groceries. There was no one in the
house at the time except Olga and one of
the small children. She opened the door
and taking two of the parcels from Hayes
went to the kitchen, Hayes following her.
Learning that she was alone in the house,
Hayes attempted to assault her. He put
his hand over her mouth to prevent her
from screaming and she fought desper
ately for a long time, as she thought. She
managed to finally get away from him and
began to scream for help, which made
Hayes run out of the house.
She went to the park and meeting a
park policeman told him of what had oc
curred. He said he could do nothing, and
advised her to swear out a warrant in one
of the courts in the morning. Later she
told Mrs. Rosenberg, who Instructed her
to go home and tell her father. He went
gunning for Hayes Wednesday night, but
could not find him. He accompanied his
daughter to the Police Court on Friday,
and is still vowing vengeance against
Hayes.

DARK NICHTS
IN EACH MONTH
How the Funds for Street
Lights Will Be Saved
to the City.
Supervisors Are to Exercise
the Most Rigid Sort of
Economy.
A Suggestion or Mayor Phelan's That
Was Not Greeted With
Favor.
Until the end of the fiscal year San
Francisco will be without street lights
for one-third of the time, in order that
the deficit in the street light fund may
not become too great. This was de
cided at a meeting of a committee of
the Board of Supervisors having this
matter in charge held yesterday.
Heretofore four nights a month.
namely, the night of full moon and the
wo nights preceding 1 it and the night
following: have been designated as
periods when the gas should be shut
off, but in the face of a threatened
deficit it has been found necessary to
increase the number of dark nights.
Four nights will be added to the period
of darkness before full moon and two
days to that thereafter.
The matter was discussed thoroughly
before the committee yesterday. Rep
resentatives of ' las Company stat
ed that by shnttiug off the gas for the
extra six nights a savingof s23.s92could
be effected, and that the estimated de
ficiency of $27,583 would be materially
reduced.
Mayor Phelan wanted to know
whether it would not be possible to
shut off the lights in the hilly and out
lying districts for a longer period than
ten days, but it was represented to him
that such a proceeding would be an
encouragement to burglars and foot
pads, and he did not pursue the sub
ject any further.
Dr. Rottanzi of the Finance Commit
tee stated that every effort would be
made to cut down the deficits in the
various funds, and that if rigid econ
omy was practiced the shortage for the
present year might be reduced to a
large extent.
It was decided to hold another meet
ing of the Street Light Committee
previous to the meeting of the board
to-morrow, and it may be possible that
the number of nights of darkness will
be slightly increased.
FANCY DRINKING GLASSES.
Nathan Dohrmann's Porter Ar-
rested for Carrying Away the
Company's Property.
Otto Pottkammer, * porter in the em
ploy of Nathan Dohrmann & Co., at 122
Sutter street, was arrested yesterday by
Police Officer J. B. Freel upon the charge
of stealing the property of the company
while acting as a porter.
Pottkammer had led something of a
dual life, in this, that while he was en
gaged as a porter during the daytime he
was a partner in a Barbary Coast saloon
known as the "Qoldfield," at the junction
of Kearny street and Montgomery ave
nue. This place he attended during the
night time, dealing out foaming steam
beer to the class of customers that pat
ronize the ragged edge of the tenderloin.
He had been employed in the firm for
the past three months, and got the job
on the representation made by him to the
firm that he had a sick wife and a large
family of helpless children depending on
him for support. Through this means he
secured the sympathy of the managers of
the firm and worked himself into thoir |
good graces. How long he might have
continued to enjoy this is problematic,
were it not for the sharp eye of Officer ;
Freel, who detected in the barroom of the I
"Goldfleld" a class of drinking glasses |
wholly out of keeping with the charac
ter of the place, as they were of the very
best description of French flint, with gold
rims. Vases in keeping with the style of
the drinking glasses were placed on the
shelves behind the bar as an attraction
to the surroundings. These articles being
foreign to the fixtures of a Barbary Coast
saloon excited the curiosity of the officer
to that degree that he started in to in
vestigate, with the result already told. A
further consignment of stolen goods was
found in the rooms of Pottkammer's
best girl, "Dutch" Lena, in the Cashman
House on Broadway, between Kearny
and Montgomery streets. Here the
choicest of the stolen goods were found,
including fancy boxes, vases, cutlery.
etc.
As soon as Officer Freel had locked
Pottkammer up in the California street
station he notified Nathan Dohrmann of
the arrest and the discovery he had
made. The information was doubted at
first and the veracity of the officer ques
tioned, but when he gave a description of
the goods found and a history of the man
charged with the taking of them a nota
ble change came over the minds of the
proprietors.
When questioned In the prison regard
ing the matter Pottkammer admitted hia
guilt, but said that he purchased a por
tion of the goods and stole the remainder,
alleging that he considered them of hut
very little value. "It is nothing more than
any other man woulrl do under similar
circumstances," he said.
Money Loaned on TJ. S. Bonds.
The sum of $12.M0 was loaned out of the
sinking fund of the city and county on
United States bonds at 3 per cent per
annum for thirty days.
The bonds of the I'nited States. State
of California or those of the city and
county are the only securities on which
the sinking fund may be loaned, and
there is now a sum 'exceeding $110,000
available for loans of this character.

TO MURDER

Fired Upon.
Shot at Repeatedly by
Two Men While Out
for a Drive.

Footmen.
BRAVERY OF THE KING.

Before Her During the
Fusillade.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATHENS. Feb. 2f>.â The King was re
turning from Phalenum at "> o'clock
this evening in a landau, accompanied
by the Princess Maria, when two men
who were bidden in a ditch alongside
the road opened fire with guns upon the
occupants of the carriage. The first
shot missed, but the second wounded
a t"'>"tman in the arm. The coachman
whipped up his horses and the royal
party dashed away at a gallop. The
miscreants fired seven more shots after
them, none of which took effect, and
the Kins and the Princess returned to
the palace unhurt.
The King says that one of the assas
sins was dressed in gray clothing, ar.d
his Majesty declares that he could
easily Identify him.
When the second shot whizzed past
the carriage the King arose and stood
in front of his daughter, in order to
shield her. one of the horses was
slightly wounded. One of the assail
ants knelt in the middle of the road
and aimed straight at the King, who
noticed that the man's hand was shak
ing. The shot missed and the King had
a rlear view of this man, who, his? Ma
jesty says, was barety 20 years old. He
continued to fire after the carriage un
til it was out of range. His compan
ion did not leave the ditch.
As soon as the news became known
all the leading politicians hastened to
the palace to express their congratula
tions over the escape of King George
and the Princess Maria. The action of
his Majesty in shielding the Princess at
the risk of his life has aroused great
enthusiasm.
A cadet who was on horseback some
distance behind the royal carriage heard
the Bhooting and galloped to the scene
in time to see the. King's assailant
fleeing in the direction of Hymedus.
Strong parties are searching the dis
trict for the assassins.
M. Delyannis and M. Kalli, former
Premiers, were among the first to ar
rive at the palace to offer their con
gratulations. At half past 9 o'clock the
metropolitan held a thanksgiving ser
vice in the palace. The Queen knelt.
Bobbing, throughout the service. A

All of the diplomats and personages
of prominence have called at the pal
ace. His Majesty said to them that the
subversive propaganda of certain jour
nals had brought about deplorable re
sults. King George and his eldest son,
Frince Constantino, have been very un
popular since the overwhelming defeat
inflicted upon the Greek army by the
Turks last year.
Shortly after midnight the police
were on the track of the club of which
the Kinp's assailants are members. The
assassins were chosen by lot. It is ex
pected several arrests will shortly be
made.
VISALIA YOUNG
LADY DISAPPEARS
Miss Meta Baker Sought in
Vain by Relatives and
Friends.
Special r>ispatch to The Call.
VISALIA, Feb. 26.â The fire bells in this j
city were rung for a short time at mid
night last night. The alarm was given to [
summon help for the purpose of searching
for Miss Meta Baker, an estimable young
lady, 22 years old, who had suddenly dis- j
appeared from her home.
Miss Baker had left home in the after- ]
noon to go for the mail. As she did not
return her mother thought she had called
to Bee a neighbor. But when darkness i
came all the family became alarmed, es- j
peclally when it was found that she had
not been to any of the neighbors' houses, i
The young lady's brother drove out to j
the home of a friend in the country and
a force of over fifty men went out in al! ,
directions with lanterns and remained out j
most of the night, but without success.
This morning it was learned that a girl :
answering the description of Miss Baker !
had purchased a ticket for San Fijincisco i
and had gone north on the Valtey road I
passenger train that leaves here about 1 j
o'clock in the afternoon. She had no bag- ;
gage, no grip and not even a wrap. Of- j
fleers In Stockton and San Francisco were j
notified of her disappearance and this
afternoon her brother boarded a train for j
Stockton in search of his sister.
Miss Baker never exhibited any desire ]
to leave home before. Her parents can
ehe no reason for this action. She- has
been In ill health for about a year, and
it is thought she left while suffering from
a fit of mental aberration. She is small
of stature and looks younger than she
really is. She taught school in lowa be- i
fore coming here with her mother two
years ago. Her sudden disappearance has
caused a profound sensation and great '
sympathy is expressed for the afflicted :
family.
When the disappearance of Miss Baker
was reported at police headquarters in j
this city it was intimated that the young !
lady had been mentally deranged for \
many months past. Captain Bohen has j
given instructions that a strict watch be j
kept for the missing woman, but as yet ;
no special detectives have been detailed i
on the case. It is the general supposition j
that Miss Baker has gone to Ssiockton.
FITZSIMMONS SAYS
HE WILL MEET M'COY.
CLEVELAND, Feb. 26.â Champion Bob
Fitzslmmons expresses a willingness to
fight Kid McCoy. Fitzsimmons says:
"I will fight McCoy any time he puts
up enough money to make it worth my
while. McCoy and Ruhlin have no more
right to fight for the championship than
a yellow flog. I will fight McCoy any
second he puts up thÂ£ stuff. McCoy is
a miserable upstart. He has been a little
successful and it has made him daffy.
The Kid has the swell head and he thinks
he is in the heavy- weight class. I will
â how him how to fight if he has the long
Â»reen to back up his bluff."

SAN JOSE. Feb. 26.â That the ticket
selected by the New Charter Club is
i an exceedingly strong one and virtually
! invincible is shown by the attitude as
sumed toward it by the Mercury, the
acknowledged organ of the "gang."
While perfectly willing to wound, it
; dare not strike any one of the gentle
| men who have been made part of the
I city ticket by the friends of the new
charter and of good government. By
i reason of the known probity and abil
j ity of each and every one of
! the candidates named the Mer
cury has been forced into a position
where It must put up men of straw as
a target for its peculiar style of men
j dacious warfare.
For the past two days it has devoted
columns to vilifying certain individ
uals who have long been lending ef
ficient aid to the cause of good govern
! ment, but who have not been nor have
sought to be leaders, as the organ of
the gang has endeavored to make the
: people believe. It has also brought into
! the fight the name of at least one j
j person who is not a member of the
I New Charter Club at all, and has i
| thereby hoped to bring discredit on
that organization. It has also, by in- j
j nuendo and indirection attacked the |
1 New Charter Club as a whole by mak- j
ing deliberate mlsstatements concern- j
i ing it. But throughout its many col- |
umns of unfair criticism and malicious !
abuse it has not had the temerity to j
assail a single one of the candidates j
named by the New Charter Club.
No one who understands the relations I
existing between the "gang" and the |
Mercury under its present management i
; is in any decree surprised at the stand '
the newspaper has taken. Had it taken I
' any other course than opposition to j
; the g(X>d government movement there j
would have been cause for wonderment
by the people of San Jose.
There is one thing to be said in fa
vor erf the Mercuryâ people always j
know where it will stand when there
is an issue up in which the "gang" is
interested. In the course of an article
to-day the "gang" organ says:
"Many of the members of the New j
! Charter Club either live in the suburbs
i or outside of the city."
This is denied by the president of the !
club. It is true that three members [
are not actual residents within th^ j
: present limits of the city of San Jose, j
but they hope that under the admin- j
lstration of the officers who will be
: elected through the efforts of the New j
Charter Club and kindred organizations ;
there will soon be a Greater San Jose, ;
and that they will be residents within
Its boundaries.
At one point in this same article the
feeling of bitter animosity toward the j
New Charter Club is manifested by a j
reference to that organization as a
| "combination of political blather
skites."
The Mercury is doing all In its power
to foment trouble and discord among
the members of the New Charter Club
and between that organization and oth
er bodies which are working in co-op
eration with it, but up to the present
time its efforts are without success and
without hope of success. All that it
has accomplished has been to impress
upon the people at large the strength of
the New Charter Club ticket, and to
announce to the public that the "gang"
is "agin it." In all its vaporings not
one word has been said against the
honesty or integrity of any individual
connected with the New Charter Club.
Petitions in the interest of the candi
dates of the New Charter Club were
placed in circulation to-day. Every
candidate, no matter how nominated,
must file a petition with the City Clerk
at least twenty days before the day
of election. It is believed the New
Charter Club petitions will be ready,
with the necessary number of signa
ture?, for filing early next week.
All citizens who have moved since
the last election are being urged by
the members of the New Charter Club
to reregister before March 12.
It is now the general report that the
"gang" will be back of the following
candidates: C. J. Martin, for Mayor;
J. W. Cook, for City Clerk; J. N. Ew
ing, for City Treasurer; J. D. Miner,
for Councilman-at-large. Cook and
Ewing are incumbents of the respec
tive offices for which they are named.
NICARAGUA BELIEVED TO
HAVE DECLARED WAR.
Cable Company of Panama Refuses
to Accept Messages for Costa
Rica.
Copyrighted. ISSB, by James Gordon Bennett.
PANAMA, Feb. 26.â The action of the
cable company here, with reference to
messages for Costa Rica, leads to the
conclusion that war has been, or soon '
will be, declared between Costa Rica j
and Nicaragua. A notice to the public
was posted yesterday, to the effect that
messages for Costa Rica would be re- I
ceived only at the senders' risk, in t
plain language and subject to censor- i
ship at San Juan del Sur. The cable j
company posted this afternoon another
notice stating that no messages would J
be accepted for Costa Rica until fur- j
ther notice.
The posting of this notice has caused
great interest here as it is generally
understood to mean that Costa Rica's
reply to the diet of the Greater Re
public of Central America is unsatis
factory and that the relations between
Nicaragua and Costa Rica have been
definitely severed. This leads to the
conclusion that war has been declared
between the two countries, or that a
formal declaration of war will be made
within the next few days.

WILLIAMS. Ariz., Feb. 21â That
section of the Santa Fe Pacific be
tween this point and Ash Fork known
as the "Hill,' on which the late tunnel
disasters occurred, came near being
the scene of a frightful wreck. The de
tals, meager and unsatisfactory, have
been unknown untid to-day, when the
fiend who attempted to wreak his ven
geance on the railroad because he was
ejected from a freight train was
brought to Williams from Congress,
where he was captured after a hard
chase by the Sheriff.
When the freight train in charge of
Conductor Low was ready to proceed
westward from Crowley a boxcar pas
senger was discovered crouching be
tween the cars and was ejected from
the train. As he alighted on the
ground he cursed the crew and the
railroad company, avowing that he
would have revenge, and had it not
been for the timely arrival of the track
walker his revenge would have been
the demolition of the westbound ex
press, No. 1, which was due in fifteen
minutes. The track walker made the
terrifying discovery that several yards
of track had been blown up and that
ten feet of the rail was missing and a
piece over a foot in length was found
fully 200 feet from the scene of the ex
plosion. There were evidences that
enough dynamite had been used to
cause wholesale destruction. The sec
tion man found two sticks of dynamite
under the head of the switch stand.
He flagged the train and immedi
ately reported his discovery and Sher
iff Cameron was notified. The Sheriff
followed the culprit to Ash Fork and
thence to Jerome Junction, where he
lost him in the darkness. He was lo
cated later at Congress, where he was
arrested. The railroad is determined
that he shall be punished to the full
extent of the law, and besides District
Attorney Clark, E. L. Doe of Flagstaff
was retained aa prosecuting attorney.
Oscar Gibson and J. E. Jones of that
place represent the defendant.
Public feeling runs very high and
had the fellow been captured at the
time of his crime he would have fared
badly at the hands of the train men
and the citizens, who plainly showed
their feeling at the trial. The express
train was unning down hill at the
rate of fifty miles an hour and had it
crashed into the break in the track,
with two sticks of dynamite ready to
explode when it passed over, the loss
of life would have been appalling.
Such a crime but a few years ago in
Arizona would have been the signal
for a lynching, but in these later days
justice is allowed to take its course.
At the hearing it was shown that the
dynamite used by the man was ob
tained by him from the rock blasting
near Ash Fork, where he had been em
ployed a short time before. He seemed
to thoroughly understand its use and
evidently was prepared in case he
should be thrown from a train. At the
hearing he showed no feeling what
ever and did not seem to realize the
extent of the crime that he had com
mitted, having the idea that he was
justified in his revenge. His only re
gret was that his diabolical scheme
had not been successful. After the
evidence was all in he was placed un
der $5000 bonds to await trial. He was
escorted to the train and taken to
Flagstaff.

Findings of the Court Martial
Forwarded to the Navy
Department.
The Officer Detained Under Arrest
on Board the Monterey at
San Diego.
Sperlal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 26.â The trial by
court-martial of Lieutenant-Com
mander Charles A. Adams, executive
officer of the Monterey, on the charge
of intoxication was finished yesterday.
The finding and decision of the court
have been forwarded to Washington
for approval, and it will be at least
two weeks before the final result of the
court-martial is known even to the of
ficers directly interested.
Lieutenant-Commander Adams, who
is considered a very able officer, and
was popular with the crew, was acting
captain of the Monterey for a day, two
or three weeks ago, and while in that
capacity, it is reported, he became in
toxicated. He was under the influence
of liquor when Captain Clark returned
to the ship, and met Captain Clark at
the gangway.
Captain Clark was so indignant over
the flagrant conduct of Lieutenant
Commander Adams that he ordered him
to his room, where he has since re
mained under arrest. He will be kept
under that restraint until the finding
of the court is heard from at Wash-
ington.
Lieutenant Commander Adams was
once before placed under arrest and
confined to his room for intemperance.
That was about four months ago, when
he arrived from the East under assign
ment to the Monterey, while the moni
tor lay at Portland. He is said to have
become intoxicated almost as soon as
he went aboard, as a result of which
indiscretion he was contined <*Â» hU
room.

SIX DAYS IN A LIFEBOAT.
Almost Dead From Exposure When
Sighted by the Steamship
Rotterdam.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â The Holland-
American line steamer Rotterdam, from
Rotterdam, arrived at quarantine to
night with third ofli.vr George Uns
worth and nine seamen of the overdue
French liner La Champagne, who were
picked up from a lifeboat on Thursday,
February 24, in latitude 40.l north, lon
gitude 57 west.
The men when taken aboard the Rot
terdam' were in a helpless condition,
having been in the ship's lifeboat for
six days and nights. They were all
more or less frostbitten. Unsworth said
that La Champagne broke her tail-end
shaft on Thursday, February 1", at 5
p. m., in latitude 45:57. longitude 51:52.
The steamship being in a helpless con
dition Captain Perrot anchored. The
steamship was on the edge of the New
foundland banks, and. there being a
possibility of her not being picked up
in her position, Captain Perrot decided
to send a lifeboat in Ft-arch of assist
ance.
On the morning of the 18th, the life
boat being fully provisioned, Unsworth
and his crew of nine men left the ship
in the hope of Intercepting some pass
ing steamship. The weather proved
tempestuous, with intense cold. A sharp
lookout was kept for passing vessels,
but none were seen. The crew kept to
the oars and for six days worked with
might and main, but, owing to the cold
and exposure, became wellnigh ex
hausted.
On the 24th, at 1 p. m., the Rotter
dam bore down and stood by and with
no little difficulty rescued all hands.
La Champagne experienced strong
head winds up to February 17, when
the tail-end shaft gave way. When the
accident occurred th- best of order pre
vailed. The steamship was perfectly
tight and not mak:M; any water. The ;
passengers, on bei.g informed of the
accident to the mnchinery, were per
fectly calm and the best of order pre
vailed.
La Champagne carried 304 passengers,
48 being cabin, 53 second_ cabin, 203
steerage and a crew of 175.
DIERSON MUST
PROVIDE BEANS
11l Luck of a Man Who Con
tracted to Supply Folsom
Prison.
Held to His Agreement, Though the
Price of the Staple Has Gone
Skyward.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FOLSOM, Feb. 26.â The meeting of
the State Board of Prison Directors to
day was attended by Chairman Fitz
gerald and Members Wilkins and Ray,
Director Devlin being absent from the
State. D. Dierson of Sacramento ap
peared before the board, and asked for
a modification of his contract for Bayo
beans. The unexpected demand for this
commodity by reason of the Klondike
excitement had rendered it almost im
possible to procure the quantity con
tracted for, and the price at the pres
ent time had gone up to $3 25, the con
tract price being $1 57. The board ex
pressed sympathy for Dierson, but be
yond that he received little consolation.
The board could see no way to release
Dierson or to modify his contract, con
sequently he will be compelled to sup
ply the State with beans on the con
tract price.
"vvhen the question of considering the
proposed bids on the contract for a new
boiler to be used in connection with
the rock crusher came up. Chairman
Fitzgerald said that, as some misap
prehension seemed to have arisen as to
whether the board should make any
distinction between an Eastern ana
California-made boiler, he suggested
that new specifications be drawn, pub
lication for bids be again made and the
present bids rejected, returned to the
respective bidders and not given pub
licity. The motion was carried, after
which the board went into executive
session and adjourned after auditing
the February claims.
OPENS PRISON GATES
FOR PETTY OFFENDERS.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26.â The decision
given by Judge Van Dyke yesterday that
the Police Courts of this city are ille
gally constituted has precipitated a seri
ous state of affairs, and will probably re
sult in a demand for a new law by the
next State Legislature. The Police Judges
were elected as City Justices also, and
thus occupied a dual position. Yesterday
they took up the criminal business of the
city as City Justices when they learned
that their positions as Police Judges were
invalid. To-day the question of their
standing as City Justices is raised.
They were elected under an amendment
to section 103 of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure, which provides that cities of over
15.000 inhabitants and less than 34.000 shall
elect one justice, and of over 34.000 and
under 100,000 shall elect two justices.
When they wtre elected there had been
no census taken showing the population
of Lob Angeles to be over 100,000, but sub
sequently a census has shown it to be
over 100.000. The question now raised is
whether they have been legally in office
since the taking of the census. It is con
ceded that after their present term the
city cannot have City Justices.
I nder the decision declaring the Police
Judges illegally in office the chaingang
must be done away with, a number of
persons now serving sentence can be re
leased by habeas corpus proceedings, and
many other results of a like nature fol
low.
ZOLA YET
HOPEFUL OF
REVISION
Believes Others Will
Carry on the
Campaign.
However, He Will Take
an Appeal From the
Judgment.
Policy of the French Govern
ment Is to Stop All Fur
ther Agitation.
M. MELINE SO DECLARES.
And Now His Cabinet Is Stronger
Than Ever and Will Safely Meet
Coming Elections.
Copyrighted, IS9S, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. 26.â Z01a has accepted
his sentence without evincing surprise.
"After all," Zola told us journalists, "it
is more logical perhaps and better as
iit is. Persecution has always been the
handmaid of truth." He is not dis
i couraged, and believes firmly that the
i campaign for revision â so hateful has
the opposition been from the point of
â  view of this special object of "revolu
i tionary measures" (that is the expres
; sion he uses) â will be continued by
â  others. He has decided, however, to
j profit by the right of appeal against
the judgment, and if the Court of Ces
sation admits the ground, which seems
! doubtful in spite of the numerous
; points of appeal taken by the defense,
all will commence over again before
another court and another jury, but
; this cannot be done immediately, and
there is general lassitude. The need of
quiet is preached almost without dis
tinction of opinion by the greater part
of the press, with the exception of
journals which can only thrive upon
agitation. This sentiment has reached
such a degree that the mot of the situ
ation was said on Thursday, from his
chair, by the President of the Council,
M. Meline, replying to the numerous
interpellations the Zola trial called
forth in the Chamber.
"The conclusion to deduce is that it
is necessary that this should stop to
day," cried M. Meline amid the ap
plause of the Chamber. "The role of
the Government will be to bring about
a cessation of the agitation on the part
of all and to make all accept it,"
This declaration procured for the
Cabinet the greatest majority it has
been able to obtain since the com
mencement of this dangerous affair,
and so often brought before Parlia
ment, where it excited those violent
signs you know.
Mellne's Cabinet is stronger than
ever. It will safely meet the approach
ing elections. The arm of the War De
partment which Socialists would have
liked to have employed against him has
burned their hands, and the imprudent
intervention of their chief, M. Jaurez,
who wanted to make the witness-box
of the Court of Assizes a political ros
trum, and was only saved from com
promising seriously his personal posi
tion, has taken their weapons out of
their grasp. So true is this that the
announcement has already been made
that certain candidates who have
wished to present themselves as Social
ists pure and simple must cut loose
from certain compromising sections
and openly adopt a more refined line
of conduct.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â The House

DASHED ASHORE
ON THE FLATS
Disaster to the Alaskan
Steamship Oregon
at Juneau.
Passengers Suffer Greatly From
the Cold Before She Is
Floated.
City of Topeka Speaks the Overdue
Scotia, Which Reports All
Well.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 26.â The steamship
City of Topeka arrived here to-night
from Juneau, Alaska. The officers of
the Topeka report that during a ter
rific windstorm at Juneau last Sunday
the steamship Oregon was blown
shore on the Juneau flats. She was ly
ing in Juneau harbor at anchor when
the gale struck her, and after strain
ing at her anchors, for some time she
began to drag, and then a tremendous
sea hurled her upon the flats. Several
horses were thrown against the side of
the vessel as she struck, and some were
killed.
All day she lay in that position, the
passengers suffering terribly, as dur
ing the gale a terrible snowstorm
| raged. The thermometer registered 8
degrees below zero and the wind was
piercing cold. When the gale abated
;at high tide the vessel was floated.
! Fortunately the flats are soft and the
Oregon suffered no injury.
On the way down the Topeka spoke
I the Corona and brings word from Cap
; tain Goodall that she can be /aised.
j Divers found no large holes in her hull
j and what leakages were found had
I been stopped and the water pumped
I out. Everthing was in readiness when
i the Topeka left to raise her.
On Thursday the long overdue
i steamship Scotia was passed, bound to
Seattle from Skaguay. She reported
all well. The steamship Rustler had
returned to Juneau from another un
successful search for the bodies of
those who perished in the Clara Ne
vada disaster.
Juneau has a coal famine and there
is only sufficient fresh meat in town
to last from the arrival of one boat to
that of another. The weather has
been something terrible for a week
past, cyclonic gales have been blowing
continuously and the thermometer has
been from zero to nine below.
STRIKERS NEED
FINANCIAL AID
Appeal to Be Made to the
American Federation
of Labor.
Believe That the Prospect of a War
With Spain Will Cause Fac
tories to Reopen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Feb. 26.â The New Bedford
strike council issued a call this morn
ing for an important meeting to-mor
row afternoon, when questions of the
gravest importance in the progress of
the strike will be considered. The lead
ers of the strike realize that the fight
cannot be maintained â without financial
aid, and it has been decided to appeal
to the American Federation of Labor,
which never assists until formally ap
pealed to. It was thought the strike
could be maintained by voluntary con
tributions, but although the sum real
ized this week far exceeds that of any
previous week during the strike, the
amount is insufficient to carry on the
fight.
At the meeting to-morrow it will be
decided to delegate Secretary Samuel
Ross of the Spinners' Union to go to
Washington on Wednesday. The spin
ners have not yet touched their re
serve fund, for the mule spinners are
so well organized that they are being
supported by outside comrades. The
case is different with larger bodies, but
the feeling is that with the American
Federation of Labor behind the strikers
the operatives will be able to hold out
long enough to win their battle. The
war talk has entered largely into this
feeling of buoyancy, and the leaders
look for such a jump in the cloth mar
ket that the manufacturers will be
forced to open up on the old prices.
In the discussion of the situation this
morning there was but little hope held
out for a settlement. Good judges say
that should the American Federation of
Labor take up the fight the strike will
be prolonged to such a length that it
will either wear itself out or come to
an end through some unexpected event
which cannot be foreshadowed.
Attempt to Murder a Chinese.
VENTURA, Feb. 26.â Chinatown was
the scene of an attempt at murder last
night. Chu Toy. a cook in the Santa
Clara House, was slashed with a knife
and cleaver across the face, arm and
body. He was horribly mutilated, but
will live. His assailant, whose name is
not known, cannot be found by the of
ficers.

Budd Arranging a Convention o: K'.presentative
ijusiness Men of the West to Prepare for
the Coming Event.
Aivvi?ifiO?!tlcn, the grandest ever held
in the .West, â¢â ill celebrate California's
fiftieth anniversary of Statehood. That
."much, is assured. A committee of local
citizens has, with Mayor Phelan at Its
' head, taken hold of the matter, and the
-members are now engaged in making
preliminary arrangements.
Yesterday Governor Budd announced
that he was preparing to make person
al requests of the governors of adjoin
ing States to co-operate in the great
proposed exposition, and make the fair
one in which the whole western part
of- the continent would be interested.
The Governor's invitations will not stop
wjth ' the adjacent States, but every
State in the Union will be asked to
make a representation at the fair. Gov
ernor Budd has announced his decision
of calling a convention of the leading
merchants, manufacturers and repre
sentative business men of the State to
arrange for the fair, and the Governors
of other States will be asked to send
delegates to that meeting.
Mayor Phelan and the members of
the committee he appointed applaud the
proposition of the Governor to call such
a convention as he proposes.
Every business man of the State is
enthusiastic on the exposition proposi
tion, and that enthusiasm is rapidly
spreading over the neighboring States.
The fair is assured, and the plan now
is, to make it even a more gigantic one
than at first proposed, and. make it na
tional in its scope.

WILL INVITE CO-OPERATION OF ADJOINING STATES.
Governor Budd Will Ask California's Neighbors to Take Part in the
Proposed Exposition.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. ,26. -Governor Budd, iv
speakiug to-day of the proposed exhibition for 1900,
said : ''I am heartily in accord with the project and
have in preparation letters addressed to the Govern
ors of various States inviting their co-operation. My
idea is to have them send delegates to a conven
tion which shall select a committee to act in conjunc
tion for the general good of the scheme. I believe
it should be a matter in which the entire State should
be interested, and I shall devote myself to the suc
cess of the enterprise and do all I can in furthering
the best possible results."
a with the States of the Union
meets the general approoation of the
!â¢ â 'pie of the Golden West.
That idea of peace and work should
be welcomed by all, especially at this
â¢ nt when the people are excited
over the war S''are.
"We approve "f the project presented
by the editors of The Gall, who, though
they give plenty of information about
the disaster that has befallen the
American nation, still they beg to re
. ihe public that there la something
nobler and more beneficial for the in
t< rests of the country than the talk of
war.
Besides a great number of foreign
ers who will v;sit this city, the most
important benefits of the San Francisco
Exposition will be the increased rela
tions between the Western and Eastern
â¢States.
With a few months' preparation we
had the Midwinter Fair in 1894. With
two years before us we can prepare for
1900 a wonderful Californian fair, where
our State will be able to show all its
splendid resources, which caused it tv
be called the American Italy.
The Italians, who have such a great
interest in the agricultural and mining
industry of the Pacific Coast, and who
transformed millions of acres of desert
land Into gardens and .vineyards, will
nnt surely be the last in supporting the?
great enterprise.
As for us. we will do our best in the
columns of L'ltalia to help the propos- d
exposition, BO that this mighty project
Will prove to be an eventful and glori
ous triumph for the Pacific Ccrast.

A Great Exposition in 1900 Will. Be
of Benefit to the
West.
MONTEREY, Feb. 26.â Charles R.
Few, president of the Board of Trus
tees of the city of Monterey, said:
"VH.;iara in favor of the exposition.
in 1900, and I think it should be a big
one. The biggeY the better, for Cali
fornia is a great State and should show
her greatness in an appropriate man
ner. It should be an exhibition of suf
ficient magnitude to attract the atten
tion not only of America but of the
world. Of course the World's Fair of
1900 will occur in Paris, but there will
be large numbers of people who will
have neither the time nor means to at
tend it who would gladly find a coun-
ter-attraction nearer home. People
from Australia, Xew Zealand, Japan
and China would come to San Fran
cisco rather than Paris, I believe, if an
equally good exposition was presented
in the California metropolis, and every
person who comes into our State ren
ders it just so much benefit.
"The Midwinter Fair was of incalcu
lable benefit to the State in advertising
its products and resources to the world,
ami in other ways. An exposition car
ried out Â°n the lines The Call suggests
would certainly prove a far greater
success. I think I voice the sentiments
of all the citizens of California's first
capital, Monterey, when I say let us
have the exposition."
MEETING WITH
APPROBATION
The Fair Will Give Profitable Pub-
licity to the Resources of
the Pacific Slope.
The proposition of holding: a grand
exposition in 1900 at San Francisco to
celebrate the semi-centennial admis
sion of California into the Union is
meeting with approbation. It is pro
posed to make this a Pacific Coast ex
position, and one that â will far out
reach the Midwinter Fair in grandeur.
Suoh an exposition, if not managed by
a few selfish individuals like the Mid
winter Exposition, would be of man-
fold benefit in giving profitable pub
licity to the resources of the Paeifi.
Slope and especially of California.-

The members of the Board of Health

per yesterday, in which a trusted em
ploye of the department was charged
with having blackmailed a Chinese

Finally the spectators seem to be on
a moving vessel, passing by the great
Brooklyn navy-yard. Suddenly the
Maine flashes before him, glorious in
its immaculate whiteness, the stars
and stripes waving in the breeze as
The ire of the Health Board is par
tlcujarly strong because no effort was
made by the paper to verify
the false statements it published,
and the board was placed in a
position of having appointed a man
who was represented as ready at any
or all times to take money as a re
ward for protecting those who trans
gress the law.
What make:- the <-ase particularly ag
gravating is the fact that it was in
sinuated that crooked acts have been
common among the inspectors of the
department and that an investigation
might develop a serious scandal.
The paper, not content with tak
ing the word of a disgruntled
Chinese, brought in the name
>f Health Officer O'Brien, who was Bald
to bo carefully and cautiously inves
tigating before making any public ex
pose.
The story, as misstated in the paper,
was to the effect that a heaith
inspector in full uniform had called at
the establishment of Sing Kee, a Chi
nese merchant doing business on Sac
ramento street, near Dupont, and de
manded a bribe to save the Chinese
from arrest for having sold a quantity
of onions that were unfit for food. The
Chinaman was represented as a man
of wealth and also a man of standing
in the Chinese business community, yet
he was credited with having paid and
quoted with saying that he had paid
$3o as a price of his liberty, and to pre
vent himself from being taken to jail.
The real facts of the case are these:
A quantity of onions arrived from Aus
tralia by steamer a few days ago con
signed to a man named Peterson. On
account of their bad condition the con
signee refused to accept them, and as
neither duty nor freight had been .paid
they were sold at auction. Sing Kee
was the purchaser. A few hours later
the Chinese, who is always looking for
a bargain, sold the onions to George
Brorsen, a buyer for 1). Keefe & <'â¢>.
In the meantime Inspector Billy Jordan
of the Board of Health had been com
plained to about the odor of the onions
and had ordered them dumped into the
bay.
When Brorsen callprl for his onions
he was given a receipt by Jordan show
ing that the onions had been thrown
overboard. This receipt was handed
to John W. Gale, manag-r of the house
of D. Keefe & Co., who proceeded to
demand from Sing Kee the return of
the $30 that had been paid for the on
ions. Being acquainted with Inspec
tor William Finnigan of the Health
Department he asked the latter to look
into the matter.
Finnigan, after ascertaining from In
spector Jordan that the facts as stated
to him were correct, agreed to accom
pany Gale to see the Chinaman. Gale
and Finnigan called together at Sin.-?
Kee's place of business and Gale made
a demand for the return of the money,
claiming that P.rorsen did not know
the condition of the onions at the time
he purchased them. Inspector Finni
gan informed Sing Kee that he had
violated the law in selling the onions
and under the conditions the Chinese
merchant agreed to return the money.
The inspector Mas highly indignant
yesterday when he read the charge that
hud been made against him, and at
on^e called upon Health Officer
O'Brien. He admitted that he was
present when the money was paid, but
characterized as a lie the statement
that he had signed a fictitious name to
the receipt. He stated that he had
not signed the receipt at all, but that
the paper had been signed by Mr.
Gale when the money was paid by the
Chinaman. He demanded a full in
vestigation of the matter, and with Mr.
Gale went before a notary public and
made affidavit to the facts as they had
occurred.
Among the members and employes of
the Board of Health the story is re
guarded as a shameless attempt to
make a sensation at the expense of the
reputation of Inspector Finnigan.
Though Sing Kee is quoted with
having charged a Health Inspector
with exacting blackmail from him he
evidently believes that Mr. Gale of D
Keefe &- Co. is responsible, and had his
attorneys draw up papers yesterday
for a suit in the Justice Courts de
manding the return of the $30.

the scene is one of life and discipline.
Instantly there is deafening applause.
The audience bursts forth in a deep

composite mass of men, women and
children of many nationalities, whose
[ of whom were personal friends of the lit

ALLOWED A
FUGITIVE
TO ESCAPE
Captain Reed Under
a Most Serious
Charge.
He Is Accused of Assist
ing an Alleged Embez
zler to Get Away.
Through an Alleged Misunder
standing Fred Simpson
Eludes the Police.
WANTED IN MARSHFIELD.
"Refused to Allow the Detectivies
to Come Aboard of His
Steamer.
Captain Reed of the steamer Arcata
is liable to find himself In serious
rtrouble.
Several days ago Chief Lees received
POLICE ON THE TRAIL OF A FUGITIVE.
Detectives Gibson and Wren attempted to board the steamer Arcata as she was passing A^eiggs wharf last Friday evening.
Captain Reed would not stop for them, and in consequence Frank M. Simpson, agent of the Coos Bay, Roseturg and
Eastern Railway and Navigation Company, wanted on a charge of arson and embezzlement, made his escape.
a dispatch from the police of Marsh
field, Or., asking him to arrest Fred
erick Simpson, charged with embezzle
ment.
"He is badly wanted," read the dis
patnh. "Do all in your power to arrest
him."
A short time afterward another dis
patch was received stating that Simp
son was aboard the Arcata, which was
due in this city last Friday morning.
Detectives Gibson and Wren were, de
tailed to arrest the alleged embezzler,
and, after a short consultation, they
agreed to board the vessel before it
docked, so as to preclude the possi
bility of escape. Accompanied by Ser
jreant Fltzgibbon Gibson hired a small
boat and rowed out in the bay, intend
ing to board the Arcata.
As they hailed the v.-ssel the captain
refused to t.-^ke them aboard, notwith
standing thai they told him that they
were officers of the law. Gibson at
tempted to fasten a hook attached to
his boat to the Arcata, when Captain
P.pcd in an angry manner ordered him
to "cast away" under penalty of being
forced to do so.
Foiled in their efforts to board the
v-ss 1 Gibson and his fellow officer
Btarted for the Vallejo street wharf, in
the hope of heading off Simpson after
the steamer docked. Detective Wren,
â¢who wa? awaiting the arrival of the al
leged f-mbezzW, boarded the Arcata
as it reached the wharf, and asked the
captain to point out to him the mueh
â wanted embezzler. Captain Reed, it is
claimed, singled out the wrong man,
allowing the real culprit to escape. The
individual whom Reed said was Simp
son readily proved his innocence and
was allowed to ro. In the meantime
Simpson left the steamer and made his
escape.
Captain Reed last night visited police
headquarters and endeavored to excuse
his action by claiming that he did ii"i
know th.it Gibson and Fttxgibbon were
police officers. Chief Lees severely rep
rimanded him for his conduct, and in
formed him that he will consult the
District Attorney with a view of secur
ing a warrant for his arrest for aiding
and abetting a fugitive to escape.
WILL MAKE
A FLAT RATE
So the Trans-Missouri Roads
Notify the Traffic Con
ference.
On Sinfjle Tickets They Will Charge
Full Fares With a Rebate of
Twenty Dollsys.
CHICAGO, Feb.' 26.â At the meeting
of general passenger agents of the
Western roads here to-day to dfvipe
â ways of conducting the transcontinen
tal rate war, the trans-Missouri roads
gave notice that beginning March 6
they would put into effect to North
Pacific Coast points from the Missouri
River gateways the same rates as are
now in effect via St. Paul. For parties
of three or over they will make a _flat
rate. On single tickets they will charge
full fares, giving the passenger a re
bate order for $20. payable on reaching
destination. This view disposes of the
question of meeting the cut through
the Missouri River gateways. A com
mittee was at once appointed to pre
pare a plan of action for the roads
east of the Missouri River to pursue.
The report of this committee will be
considered Monday. The meeting to
day declined to take any action on a
proposition coming from the Canadian
Pacific road, through a trunk line com
mittee, for a settlement of the matters
In dispute.
In effect, this proposition was that
all rates should be restored March 14
and be maintained pending the result
of a conference to be held March 17.
The Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific roads would not consent to enter
tain the proposition, because It in
volved a fresh recognition </f Canadian
Pacific differentials, and restored to the
Canadian Pacific all the advantages it
possessed on that point prior to the rate
war. The other roads would take no
action on the subject until they heard
from their Eastern ally, the Grand
Trunk. They recommend the trunk
line co-mmittee to submit the proposi
tion to that road for an expression of
opinion on the subject, and when it is
heard from the Western roads will then
be in a position to take action in the
matter.
Railroad people in San Francisro are
at present lying low and waiting for
what they hardly know. The .situation
is one of great uncertainty, and much
il>'pt j nds on the action that will be
taken by the Southern Pacific at the
conclusion of the traffic meeting now
being held in Chicago.
Yesterday the Canadian Pacific office
on Market street had a lar^e sign in its
front, advertising the cut-rate schedule
ti> New York and Chicago, and Mr.
Stern, the local agent, said that even
with the reduced fares but a few hours
old the increase of business has been
most noticeable.
The general impression along the
street seems to be that the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe will be forced.
sooner or later, to enter the fight. The
i "anadian Pacific at the present rates,
will have practically all the travel to
itself.
Though the Southern Pacific may not
desire to enter into competition with
the Canadian Pacific at the reduced
rates In the latter road's own territory
yet the loss it will sustain on its Shasta
route by the war started here will force
It to take measures for its own protec
tion as it cannot afford to lose the
splendid business it has been doing for
some time past between this city and
northern points.
The other northern roads refuse to
consider any proposition looking
toward a compromise that will restore

VETOED THE MEASURES.
The Mayor Disapproves of the Pro-
posed Limits of the
Pound.
Mayor Phelan sent two veto messages
to the Board of Supervisors yestf-rriay
relative to measures that have recently
been passed by that body. The first re
lated to order No. &9. establishing a ter
ritory in which a public pound may be
maintained.
The other message vetoed the permls-
Bion granted to the California and North
west Trading and Mining Company to
maintain a sign In .front of the premises
at 402 Kearny street. The Mayor's rea
son for the veto was that if such privi
leges were granted to one merchant they
must be granted to all, and that such
signs would be a great disfigurement If
generally allowed.

RICHMOND WANTS SCHOOLS.
Several Children Compelled to Roam
About the Streets Because There
Is No Accommodation
for Them.
Richmond district would be a bad place
for a man to go to advocate the zoo prop
osition,- inasmuch as the people in that
section of the city are sorely In need of
better school facilities for their children.
As it is now, there are over 300 children
of school age who are deprived of the ad
vantage of obtaining an education in the
public schools of the city. The injustice
of this managementâ or. rather, misman
agementâls chargeable to both the Board
of Supervisors and the Board of Educa
tion, at least the residents of Richmond
so hold. They claim that the wants of
the district were fully and fairly repre
sented to both boards before the annual
appropriations were made last year. The
Increase In the population of the Kicn
mund district was presented to them and
a request made for additional school
buildings, but no heed was taken of the
request and in consequence a number ot
the children are compelled to alternate
between the forenoon and afternoon in
their attendance at the schools, while
several are compelled to remain away al
together. , ,
During the past three months several
meetings of the parents and others have
been held to protest against this treat
ment. At some of those meetings reso
lutions were passed requesting the Board
of Education to add two class rooms to
the Richmond sehoolhouse as a part con
cession, but no heed was taken of this
request and the condition remains as it
was one year ago, while the increase in
the number of school children still contin
ues.
At the last meeting of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club a committee was ap
pointed to take charge of this matter
and not permit any lapses to occur when
the next appropriation is being made for
the school department.
The closing of the City Cemetery has
been hailed with joy by the Richmond
people, as it removes one of the great
drawbacks to extension of the building
up of the district westward. The exten
sion of time given the undertakers bav
ins the contract for the burying of the j
Indigent dead until next July is not op- j
posed, as the time will be but short. The j
Chinese having purchased a cemetery
of their own in San M&teo County will
stop those people from burying any more j
of their dead on city soil. The several j
benevolent societies who were accorded
the privilege of using the City Cemetery |
have discontinued interring their dead in I
that place for some time past, conse- i
quently only the city's dead will be I
placed there' between now and next July.

WHY THE LADY
QUIT HER JOB
Baroness yon Zieba Has
Another Inning in
Court.
Jack Chretien Appears as an
Expert on Theater Con
tracts.
Judge Barry Intimates That the
Noble Lady Is Worthy of
Her Hire.
Baroness Yon Zleba, bearer of a
proud and ancient name, but now a
singer in the humble music halls of
San Francisco,. had another inning yes
terday before Justice Barry in her suit
against the management of the Thalia
Theater. The Baroness was elegantly
gowned, haughty of mien and gazed

disdainfully at the witnesses on the
other side when evidence was given
that might hurt her case.
She had the best of the day, how- ]
ever, and if the court's rulings are any
criterion the Thalia management will \
have to pay her the wages claimed. '
Several exciting â¢fcenea occurred, prin- I
cipally caused by the lawyers, before
the case was submitted to Judge Barry.
Jack Chretien, of le^al and theatrical
fame, caused one diversion. He was
produced as a witness by the defense
and took the stand with all the assur
ance born 'of long acquaintance with
the stage.
The dispute between the music hall
management and the musical baroness
hinged on the question as to whether
she had a right to perform at other
places of amusement while under con
tract to the Thalia and Mr. Chretien
was expected to testify that it is the
custom for performers to give their en
tire time to houses where they were en
gaged.
Mr. Chretien tried to answer, but was
greeted with a chorus something like
this:
"We object"â "lncompetent"â "Your
honor â 'Not an expert."
Then while the lawyers argued and
wrangled and quoted the statutes the
placid Chretien read a copy of The Call
and waited for them to finish. Between
objections and exceptions he managed
to say that it was the custom for peV
formers to hold only one engagement
at a time, but Justice Barry intimated
that the testimony cut little figure and
that If a contract had been entered Into
between the Brothers Schwartz and the
Baroness Yon Zieba she was entitled to
some compensation for charming the
patrons of the place.
The Baroness herself took the stand
at one stage of the proceedings and
when asked why she had left the Thalia
declared "Because Mr. Schwartz was so
insolent to me."
The lawyers finally disentangled
themselves from the legal labyrinth in
which they had been lost and submitted
the case as they said on its merits.
His honor decided that the legal prob
lem was a deep and intricate one and
withheld Judgment until to-morrow
morning.

the show is over. His life is made a bur
den to him by the number of requests
that are continually made for free ad
mittance by those who desire to have a
good time without paying for It, and the
schemes that are put up on him to gain
an entrance would fill a book. But long
experience In the business has made him
a rather smooth article himself, and it
has to be a pretty clever ruse that 1b suc
cessful.
The other night, as he was standing In
his accustomed place watching the audi
ence file in to listen to the Bostonlans, a
well-dressed young fellow rushed up to
him, and, grasping him by the arm, 9ald:
"Mr. Frledlander. Just step inside with
me for a moment, will you? I want to
show you something." Friedlander,
thinking that something was wrong with
the house, complied, and the two passed
in together. As soon as they got inside
the young fellow, pointing to one of the
seats at the side of the dress circle, said:
"You Just stand here a) moment and
sook." He then went over and took the
seat while Friedlander stood and watched
him. The stranger seated himself, and,
picking up a programme, commenced to
scan it, while the manager continued to
stand and watch as he had been bidden.
After about ten minutes had passed Mr.
Friedlander became impatient, and walk
ing over, touched the young fellow on the
shoulder and said, "I have been standing
there as you directed but have seen noth
ing. What does this proceeding mean?"
"Seen nothing," exclaimed the young
man. "Have you not seen the smoothest
piece of work of your life? Have you not
seen yourself worked by a stranger for
an admittance and a seat? Now, leCs
get down to business. Are you going 'to
have me thrown out and get the ha ha
all along the line, or are you going to
give me the reward due for such a mag
nificent exhibition of nerve and allow me
to remain?"
"You may remain." said Friedlander,
after a moment's careful thought.
The story got out through a couple who
had entered at the same time and, oc
cupying seats directly back of the one
filled by him of the nerve, witnessed the

Companies Can Be En

An Interesting Decision RecÂ«ntly
Rendered by Justice Cox of
the Snpremo Court.
May hotel guests use the office
phone?
According to authorities they cannot
âat least at their own sweet will. As
sociate Justice Cox, of the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia, has
lately decided what Is known as the
Hotel Fredonla telephone case, which
has attracted much attention.
It s^ems that the proprietor of the
hotel procured a telephone for his pri
vate business, and signed the usual
contract. The guests of the hotel used
the telephone for their wants. The
company notified the proprietor that
the phone would be removed unless
the contract was complied with. The
proprietor applied for an injunction to
prevent the removal. Judge Cox de
cides that the telephone company has
the right to have the contract com
plied with, and may terminate the use
of the phone if the agreement is vio
lated; that the proprietor could not
permit the phone to be used for other
purposes than those mentioned in the
agreement, and should not allow the
guests of the hotel to use it for their
private business, such as calling for
stock reports, ordering theater tickets,
etc. The Judge says:
The telephone company Is obliged to
maintain a ppecial plant and is entitled
to charge for all services rendered. All
that the law requires is that the company
shall not discriminate between its pa
trons, but must serve all persons on the
same terms. The explicit terms of the
contract made between the parties In W6
are that the telephone shall be for the
subscriber's use only, and on a breach of
the terms the contract is violated. When
the subscriber allows others to use his
telephone it is an abuse of the time of the
telephone operator. Tt is also an in
fringement on the rights of the telephone
company. Furthermore it is an Infringe
ment of the rights of other subscribers.
The guest of the hotel does not have his
telegrams sent free of charge, nor does
he secure the service of messengers and
the use of carriages without pay. Why
should he be allowed to use the telephone
without paying for its use?
The case seems to be one of great
interest to all telephone companies and
has been very generally noticed in the
newspapers throughout the United
States.

Managers of the fair nre working with
unabated interest to make the event
a success in every detail. The pro
gramme will be diversified and enter
taining throughout, special arrange
ments having been made for unique
features and novelties.
The preparation for the benefit of the
families of those killed in the Maine
disaster have been completed by the
members of the citizens' committee, and
to-morrow night will be given one of
the greatest and most diversified pro
grammes that have ever been rendered
in this city. Thousands of. merchants
of the city are endeavoring to assist,
and in consequence the donations that
have been made are very numerous.
On Monday night the free list will be
entirely suspended and every one is ex
pected to pay for his ticket. The man
agement of the fair have been generous
to a degree, and the entire proceeds of
Monday are for the worthy cause.
One of the special features for Mon
day night will be the representation of
the "Battle of Winchester." Tents will
be pitched around the grand stand and
Company M of the National Guard,
under the command of Captain
O'Xeale, will present vivid pictures of
life on the tentflelds. After the con
clusion of this special number the en
tire audience \vill unite in singing the
national anthem. Everybody who at
tends on Monday night will be pre
sented with a copy of the anthem, and
it will doubtless be sung as it never
has been before.
The professional talent that has vol
unteered is almost more than can be put
on, and the programme will last for
over two hours. The Lazello Broth
ers will appear in their marvelous
Spanish rings act. and the Martels will
be seen in their famous bicycle riding,
and in the afternoon Mrs. Martel will
give a special exhibition for the ladies.
Blockson. the mimic and banjo player,
will appear, as will Antonio, the cele
brated juserler. There are a number
of other specialties, and among them
the Acme Quartet will sing familiar
selections under thr> direction of Pro
fessor Rogers. The salute will be
fired by Captain John Holtum, who will
use the cannon from which he catches
the cannon ball. The Union Iron Works
will have on exhibition on Monday
night and afternoon models of the war
ships of the United States navy. Over
seven hundred tickets have been sold
to these works alone.
M. C. Lawrence, the greatest bicycle
trick rider in the world, who has com
pleted an engagement at the Orpheum,
will also appear, while G. M. Schilling,
the one-armed athlete, will give an ex
hibition. He is now on a walking tour
around the world.
From the way in -which the tickets
have been selling the largest crowd
that has ever been inside of the Pa
vilion at any one time will be present
j on to-morrow night.
The Stanford colors were predomi
nant at the Mining Fair yesterday. Stu
dents began to arrive early and made
the building resound with their college
j cry. In the afternoon President De
i nicke escorted Professor David Starr
Jordan, president of the university, to
the grand stage, and in a very happy
address introduced him to the audi
ence. Another fortunate coincidence
was the meeting of the State Board
of Trade at the Mining Fair, and the
i members were invited to occupy seats
| upon the platform. Among those who
i were present were W. H. Mills, General
| N. P. Chipman, E. W. Maslin, J. A.
] Filcher and others.
Professor Jordan took as his theme
I tn e necessity of a home government for
Alaska, and spoke in part as follows:
"It is not my intention to-day to
dwell upon California's mining indus
tries, for you have an exemplification
before you of the gold of the State;
| rather would I address you upon the
. necessity of popular laws* for the Gov
â  eminent of Alaska, to which all
| thoughts are now tending, and to which
i Ran Francisco is the natural gateway.
; Alaska is a territory many times more
! extensive than the United States, yet
; it lacks the stable government afforded
I to every portion of the United States,
! and the protection by law, and Federal
1 and State processes accorded to other
1 States. In reality the only rule, or
law, that prevails is that dictated by
| the Greek church, or the agent of the
| commercial companies residing within
j certain small limits'.
"When I was in Washington a few
1 weeks ago, and talked with President
McKinley he expressed his desire to ex
tend to that territory all the benefits
of the United States Government, and
' throw around it all safeguards. In the
i absence of power he has to await the
! action of Congress, but there is no rea
! son why any portion of the United
| States, no matter how far removed,
1 should be deprived of the benefits af
' forded to the citizens in the most po-pu
lous centers. Legislation is needed to
correct these evils, and the sooner the
i minds of our legislators are Impressed
with the necessity of immediate action,
i in giving to Alaska the same form of

Upon the conclusion of his remarks
j President Jordan received an ovation.
j The audience appreciated his efforts,
: although his address was delivered in
a hall very difficult to talk in, and when
he descended from the platform he re
.! celved many hearty handshakes.
The managers of the" affair have add
! Ed a most interesting bird show to the
j exhibit. This is similar to the well
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1898.
known exhibits common in Europe.
The birds are entirely full blooded
birds from prize-winning stock of the
leading European exhibitors. The
classes comprise clear yellow, buff and
variegated Norwich, crest and crest
bred; clear yellow, buff and dark York
shire, a breed which has superseded the
Belgian, always a delicate bird. York
shire cinnamons, yellow and buff, with
the gold and silver lizards, are other
classes. The latter are a favorite breed
with European fanciers, the gold bird
and silver being always paired togeth
er. And with the crest-bred class a
crest is always paired with a crest bred.
One of the most beautiful in color is
the Yorkshire cinnamon, of which there
are two colors, yellow and buff cinna
mon, several of which in this exhibit
are from a bird which was unbeaten at
three of the leading English bird
shows. The cinnamon class is a favor
ite one in England; one breeder having
won .over 1000 cups and prizes at the
bird shows in this class alone.
The owner has spared no trouble or
expense to acquire a magnificent col
lection of fancy canaries, and this is
the first time they have been exhibited
in their entirety. A half-dozen cages
of representative specimens were, how
ever, loaned to the Chamber of Com
merce in Los Angeles, and attracted so
much interest that upon their removal,
at the request of the superintendent,
they were replaced by a few others, as
so many people attending the Chamber
of Commerce daily to see the birds
would otherwise have been disappoint

LOYAL TO THE
ADMINISTRATION
The Maine Disaster Discussed
by the Union League
Club.
Some Stirring and Patriotic Resolu
tions Were Unanimously
Adopted.
A special meeting of the Union League
Club was held in its rooms in the Palace
Hotel last night to express sentiments on
the Cuban cause and Maine disaster and
confidence in the present administration.
The meeting was presided ovei by the
Hon. Tirey 1... Ford, wbo made a few
opening remarks. In which he explained
the object of the meeting- and expressed
his confidence In the present administra
tion. Genera! N. P. Chipman, in behalf
of the executive committee, presented
the following resolutions, which were
unanimously and enthusiastically adopt
ed:
The members of the Union f League Club of
San -.Francisco cannot be Indifferent to the
momentous responsibilities' and the exceed
ingly delicate and trying circumstances sur
rounding our Chief Executive, and In view of
which he Is called upon* to maintain the na
tional honor and at the- same- time, If possi
ble, to avert the dread arbitrament of war.
Deeply impressed by the gravity of the sit
uation and mindful of our' duties and respon
sibilities as American citizens we declare:
That we have an unfaltering" confidence In
the wisdom and patriotism ;of President Me-
Klnley and in his ability to direct the des
tinies of the republic, in so far as the duty
may devolve upon him. with that dignity and
high -sense of honor which should characterize
a great and powerful and self-respecting- na
tion..
That we have mke confidence. in the Ameri
can Congress, ami believe that It will, as it
ever has done, boldly and patriotically, meet
any emergency that may present itself; and,
that the people of this country may. safely look
to both the executive and legislative arms
of our Government for an honorable solution
of all International questions, which -have
arisen or may arise hereafter, in accordance
with Justice and the best traditions of our
history as a nation.
That while the better sentiment of the.civ
ilized world to-day deprecates war as a means
for the settlement of International differences,
we recognize the fact that a just cause for
resort to the conflict of arms may arise; and,
should such cause appear at the present crisis,
we believe It to bo the duty of Government
to meet the Issue with promptnss and with
all its power. 1
Nevertheless It Is our duty to abide with
self-possession the result of the Investigation
now proceeding at Havana; and, as was re
cently said by ex-President Harrison,' "Stand
about our Executive, strengthening him In'
calm assurance, that. -this great - country de
sires only what is right and can wait until
the facts are known before It â  Issues its
proclamation." Should It appear, however,
from such investigation that the Government
of Spain was directly or Indirectly respon
sible for the destruction of the battle-ship
Maine, and for the cruel and awful holocaust
of her brave and heroic crew, it is our firm
conviction that, in such case, a mere money
Indemnity should not be permitted alone to
efface the Indignity and Insult shown to our
flag nor to wipe out the memory of the mur
derous and atrocious assnsMnatlon of our
sailors; but that national honor and national
safety for the future and national dignity de
mand, swift and unmistakable punishment of
the people guilty of such unparalleled treach
ery; and we further declare that in our belief
the people of the Pacific coast stand ready to
respond to any call that may he made by the
authorities at Washington In defense of our
flag whenever or wherever or for whatever
cause assailed.
Short addresses on the lines of the sen
timents expressed In the resolutions were
made by General Chipmnn. A. G Booth
Morris M. Estee, H. C. Dibble and other
members of the oluh.

MILT YOUNG A
STAKE WINNER
Took the Malewansky
Stake in a Drive From
His Stable Mate.
Obsidian the Top-Heavy Fa
vorite Finished a Close
Third.
Four Favorites Turned Down â Poor
Fields and a Light Crowd In
Attendance.
The threatening weather and a very
scant and hungry looking card kept
the attendance down at Ingleside yes
terday. The sport was marked by lack
of enthusiasm, and but very little coin
changed ownership. The special at
traction offered was the Malewansky
stake for two-year-okls at four fur
longs, and was captured by the Corri
gan entry, Milt Young, with his sta
ble-mate, Frank Ireland, at his throat
latch. The Burns & Waterhouse colt,
Obsidian, was a top-heavy favorite in
the betting, and after being put
through the mill by Frank Ireland,
Milt Young cut off soon after the start,
came fast under Lonnle Clayton's hard
urging and won by a nose in :50Vi- The
favorite was beaten by a neck for the
place by Frank Ireland.
The winner is a good looking bay
colt by Montana Regent-Lucerne, and
in all of his preceding races has been
coming fast at the end. But for be
ing cut off he would have won hand
ily.
The going was slippery and some
very warm favorites fell by the way
side, Captain Rees, the jumper, and
Royal Fan being the only ones to cap-
ture purses.
By Holly's Fordham colt, Fortunate,
was an odds on favorite for the first
event on the card, a six furlong sell
ing sprint. He was Inclined to sprawl
about in the sticky mud going from the
start, and though finishing strong the
last part, was outfooted and beaten
less than a length by Jack Martin, the,,
Texas mud lark. The winner was 6
to 1 in the betting.
A change of trainers seemed to have
worked wonders with Charles A. The
black horse at odds of 5 to 1 in the six
furlong sprint that followed, made most
of the running and in a mile drive at
the finish, led the second choice, Ben
amela, past the Judges by a good mar
gin. Daylight, the 3 to 2 favorite,
looking, a bit too high, was a good
third.
The mile and a quarter hurdle event
was a tame affair. Captain Rees, the
Corrigan entry, a 4 to 5 favorite, ridden
by Huston, waited on Tortoni for over
half the distance, when he skipped to
the front and fairly rolled in. "Stew"
Peters made his move the last quar
ter with Major S, and took second place
from Monita.
After quite an extended vacation the
big Torso colt. Odds On, again came
out of his retirement, and was made
a 7 to 10 favorite in the betting on the
fifth event at seven furlongs. His odds
later lengthened to even money from j
the force of a heavy play on Dr. i
Marks, the second choice. The favor- I
lte met with hard luck at the outset, [
being badly cut off. M'atomba showed i
plenty of speed to the stretch, where i
the Doctor, ridden by "Skeets" Mar
tin, went to the front and driving at
the end, led the favorite out a length.
Moringa once more finished third.
The made-up race for two-year-olds
over three furlongs went to the 9 to 20
favorite, "Royal Fan, ridden by Jones.
In front from the start she won hard
ridden from Master Buck.

It stands to reason
That all the rent money you are paying into
greedy landlords' hands is lost to you forever.
It would be foolishness to ever expect to get
any ot It back. Now, how much better it
would be to get something for that money
.'. .. you are paying out.
â  HOW WOULD A HOME SUIT?
: How would you like to be able to mo\-e into
'-Ââ . a handsome modern little home and feel
â â .that every monthly installment you are pay-
;\ ing Is hastening the time when you can b*Â»
independent of any landlord â when you can
.-â¢ view the coming of the Ist of the month
: with the greatest unconcern? And if you
' could do all that on the very same rent, money
you are now paying wouldn't it be worth
â  while investigating? Jacob Heyman is now
.'".. building on the Heyman Tract cottages of 4,
â¢ -â 5 and 6 rooms. They are well built and mod-
ern in every respect, and can be had on terms
. equal to rent money. The first opportunity

creating new markets, augmenting and
extending existing markets for the prod
ucts of the fields, orchards, vineyards,

be planned: but, on the contrary, the
State Board of Trade will lend all aid
within its power to any effort made in
the direction -of making a great exposi
tion in celebration of the semi-centennial
anniversary of the statehood of the State
of California.
Resolved. That the foregoing declara
tions be made the subject of special con
sideration at the regular meeting of this
hoard (.n the Sth of March; that all per
sons Interested be invited to attend the
regular meeting of the hoard, and that
a special invitation be extended to the
Governor of the Btate, to the executive
committee of the California Press Asso
ciation, to the editors and proprietors of
ail journals published in the State of Cal
ifornia, to members of the Boards of j
Supervisors or delegates appointed by
them, and to interested and patriotic citi
zens throughout the State.
THE RAINS HAVE
BEEN VERY LIGHT
Forecaster Hammon Is Still
Hopeful of Abundant
Downpours,
Climatic Conditions Not Changed In
the Last Twenty-Four
Hours.
The present rainstorm seems to be as
timid about making: its debut as a society
maiden who makes her first entry fin a
! dramatic production, but it is to be hoped
I that when it does make its triumphal ap
! pearance it will be as generous in its fa
vors as the aforesaid debutante is of her
meager histrionic abilities after Fhe has
! once played to an audience composed of
her patient and sympathetic friends.
Although Forecaster Hammon predict
ed copious rains during Saturday, just
barely enough moisture fell to save his
reputation as a prophet, and unless he
succeeds better in his prognostications
| for Sunday he will find himself without
: honor even in his own country.
Mr. Hammon said: "The conditions
have not changed one particle in the last
twenty-four hours except that the storm
has approached a little bit nearer to the
coast line and will push in still further.
The wind has been high southeast from
San Francisco north all Thursday and
Friday, and the barometer has been fall
ing slowly but steadily during that time.
It is unaccountable and upsets all previ
ous precedents how the conditions have
remained so constantly favorable to rain
and yet so little has fallen. This city js
right on the edge of a storm which is
centered on the Oregon coast, where
there have been abundant downpours,
and yet only .02 of an inch fell here yes
terday and that was all precipitated in
the early morning. The Sacramento Val
ley fared a shade better and had .08 of an
inch, while along the coast north of San
Francisco one-half an inch fell. I am
still of the opinion that within the next
twenty-four hours there will be plenty of
rain.
"The conditions at present are not such
as will make rain in the San Joaquin Val
ley, but the region north of Tehachapi
will get rain when San Francisco does.
1 am confident that this storm will not
leave us until it has plentifully besprin
kled a considerable portion of this State
and assured the usual good crops for Cal
ifornia, I earnestly hope that the flood
gates of heaven will be opened and bear
me out in my forecasts, which are found
ed on the conditions as they actually ex-
A Dead Woman's Effects.
Benard Cediey, 1513 Fifteenth avenue.
South San Francisco, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Low's court yesterday
for the arrest of Henry Gpsper, his
brother-in-law, on the charge of grand
larceny. When Cediey's wife was buried
about two weeks ago there was a dis
graioful scene at the grave, as Cediey
wanted to get possession of the rings
that were on his dead wife's fingers.
Gosper removed the furniture from
Cediey's house the same day, as he
claimed it all belonged to his sister, and
now Cediey wants him arrested.

A WARNING
TO KLONDIKERS
Unreliable Solicitors at
the Entrance Gates of
the City.
Smooth - Tongued Sharpers
Who Seek to Trap the
Unwary.
Strangers Borne Off to Unscrupulous
Houses and Unmereilully
"Bled."
Now that the Klondike rush Is fairly
on, it is but timely that a word of
warning be spoken for the benefit of
the hundreds who are flocking to San
Francisco t<> outfit for the frozen north
â let them beware of the wily "capper"
who daily plies his trade at the ferry
depot.
When the great rush was in its in
cipiency San Francisco's merchants,
with their accustomed push and ener
gy, advertised the city far and wide
as the foremost outfitting point on the
coast. The great natural advantages of !
the city were told and told again, facts, j
figures and plain statements were
brought before the prospective miner
everywhere, and the eyes of the world
turned toward the city of the Golden
Gate as the natural outfitting point,
and as a result they are coming from
north, east, south and west; coming
singly and in parties; by train, ship
and caravan, all eagerly looking to
ward San Francisco as the last halt
ing ground before the perilous journey
is begun.
This advertising was carried on by
legitimate and enterprising business
men, who contributed liberally toward
it without mentioning any individual
house, but only the cty as a general
point, and it has been taken advantage
of in a most shameful way by scurri
lous and unreliable merchants whose
only stock in trade consists of an im
measurable amount of nerve and a
supply of useless goods w-hich can eas
ily be foisted upon the unwary and in
experienced by glib-tongued salesmen.
To resort to legitimate methods of
advertising wouid be entirely out of
the question with these dealers, as an
advertisement would only be a danger
signal to warn people away, so they
have resorted to the old method which
has been worked so many times that
the only wonder is it was not aban
doned and thrown aside long ago as
worn out. The plan is this: A num
ber of "smooth articles," silver tongued,
loudly dressed and decked with the
most approved designs of paste dia
monds are picked up from any old place
â the County Jail or State Prison pre
ferred. These men are supplied with
stock circulars, business cards and re
commendations of good character and
stationed at the ferry depot. As soon
as a stranger arrives en route for Klon
dike he is immediately spotted and :
pounced upon by a horde of sagacious
"pullers" who paint their own charac
ters in the rosiest hues. The gullible
onp is then borne off in triumph to
shoddy cheap-johns, the front of which
is hidden with flaring posters and a
display of goods, the use of which in
the Klondike is as inexplicable to any
one who knows the first thing about
that region as the method by which
they could be brought there.
Once inside the bucolic one is re
ceived with open arms, and assured
that if he does not carry off half thp
stock of the store, with a few of the
fixtures thrown in by way of good
measure, he will perish before he is half,
way to the gold regions.
The plan is generally successful, as
these people are the smoothest of their
kind, and the unwary customer carries
away a stock of goods which would be
useless to him anywhere, and for which
he has paid in good gold coin about
three times the value. He is then
smilingly turned loose, given a supply
of cards of the house which he prom
ises to distribute among his friends,
and safely dispatched to a third-class
lodging-house controlled by the same
people.
The proprietor then rubs his hands
in glee, divides the spoils with his
capper, and the trap is again baited for
a fresh victim.
The only safe method for strangers
to avoid being robbed by these unre
liable dealers is to take things slowly.
Pay no attention to any solicitor, how
ever oily his tongue, and look around
for a few days before purchasing any
thing. The reliable houses are easy
to find; they cannot afford to divide
profits with a solicitor and do not at
tempt to sell useless goods at exorbi
tant prices.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
Kidney and Bladder Troubles Quickly Cured.
You May Have a Sample Bottle of the Great Discovery,
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, Sent Free by Mail.
Men and women doctor their troubles
so often without benefit that they get
discouraged and skeptical. In most
such cases serious mistakes are made
in doctoring and in not knowing what
our trouble is or what makes us sick.
The unmistakable evidences of kidney
trouble are pain or dull ache in the
back, too frequent desire to pass water,
scanty supply, smarting irritation. As
kidney disease advances the face looks
sallow or pale, puffs or dark circles
under the eyes, the feet swell and
sometimes the heart acts badly. Should j
further evidence be needed to find out
the cause of sickness, then set urine
aside for twenty-four hours; if there !
is a sediment or settling it is also con- j
vincing proof that our kidneys and j
bladder need doctoring. A fact often j
overlooked is that women suffer as j
much from kidney and bladder trouble
as men do.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root is the die- |
covery of the eminent physician and i
scientist and is not recommended for
everything, but will be found just what !
is needed in cases of kidney and blad- |

along the route uptown he was greeted
with applause.
"I am on a visit to my people," said
the general to a Call man to-night.
"This tour haÃ no special significance,
than to unite In stronger bonds
than ever all those who are marching
beneath the banner of the Salvation
Army. During my trip across this con
tinent I have been treated cordially
and have been received by all, till I be
gin to feel as if the labor of years has
not been altogether in vain. I am
anxious to see whether the first prin
ciples of the army are being faithfully
adhered to, and if the sole, object for
which the army was organized is being
carried out.
"The object of the Salvation Army is
to labor among the lowest classes of
society in all countries, and to try and
elevate them. It is an easy matter to
drift away from the slums to drawing
rooms and other comfortable places,
but the army's field is among tho
lowly, We began humbly, as all the
world knows, and we need to keep
humble. It takes me all my time keep
ing my people among the classes where
help and Christianity is most needed.
"A great deal of progress has been :
observed by me in the I'nited States '
since my visit here three years ago and j
the wnrk never looked more prosper- j
We are to-day more international ;
then ever and people seem to under- I
stand as never before that there is t
nothing more English about us than
thfre is American or German. We are |
everybody's and the international head- I
Quarters are in England for the pres- |
ent; because that is the most conven
ient place. By and by when this great
country becomes more densely popu
lated and Japan and China become
civilized, if not Christianized, New
York or Chicago or Washington may
be a more convenient headquarters
than London.
"We change about all the time and
T have never yet heard an officer of the
army boast of his individual nation
ality. Officers are drafted from one
country to another according to fitness, j
There are American officers in England
and English officers here, and the same
is true of officers speaking every lan
guage.
"The Volunteers? I do not wish to
reopen that subject. The details lead
ing up to the leaving of the army by
my son Ballington have been given to
the world and I have' no detente to
make. 1 met him in New York and we
conversed in the presence of others. I
did not meet my son alone â he declined i
to meet me. Ido not know his attitude j
and only God can understand the depth '
of anguish such an estrangement has
caused and is causing me. I do not
know what is the feeling among the
Volunteers and my son declined to tell
me. However, since I took the hand of
your President at Washington I have
seen that the feeling of loyalty in the j
Salvation Army to its principles is j
stronger than ever before,"

PHOTOGRAPH OF
AN OLD BULLET
Unique Application of Alonzo
Bradford for the Post
office.
A Sonvenir of Fort Donelson Was
Something New in Pe
titions.
Oakland Office San .Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 26.
The following paragraph shows what
William E. Curtis, Washington corre
spondent of the Chicago Record, thinks
of one of Alamede County's applicants
for office:
"The most unique application for of
fice that has been filed under this ad
ministration comes from Alonzo Brad
ford, who wishes to be postmaster at
HaywardH, Cal. Accompanying his ap
plication is a letter of recommendation,
signed by a large number of Repub
lican politicians and citizens of the
place, together with an X-ray photo
graph of his left knee. The photo
graph shows that a bullet entered his
knee at the joint, pushed up the knee
cap and lodged between the bones of
the upper and lower parts of the leg.
The bullet is still there, it being im
possible to dislodge it by probing, and
the only way in which it can be re
moved is by amputation of the leg.
Mr. Bradford stated that the bullet was
received at the battle of Fort Donel
son, and that he had carried it ever
since. Mr. Bradford was postmaster
under the Harrison administration." j
When Been at his house he said:
"Yes, I sent that picture on to show
them how I was fixed and that I still
carried one of Jeff Davis' bullets
around with me. I did not have the
photograph made at first with the idea
of sending it to Washington, however.
The ball has caused me considerable
trouble at times and I wanted to have
it extracted, if possible. So I went to
a doctor of San Francisco, who put my
knee under the X ray to locate the
ijullct.
"I sent the picture to Washington to
the Fostrnaster-tieneral on my third
of this month, together with three peti
tions containing a long list of names
of Haywards people. I also sent a
photograph to Congressman Hilborn
with a letter explaining the situation."
George Oakea already had the office
when this reached Washington, but it
opens up a new field for applicants for
Federal positions.
Attempt to Break Jail.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â Jailer Harn
merton of the City Prison believes that
he frustrated a wholesale jail delivery
yesterday morning. While making his
rounds he saw whitewash upon the
floor. Looking more closely he saw
that paper was sticking to the ceiling
of what is known as the new jail. It
is directly under Judge Allen's cham
bers and only separated by a pine
board floor. The prisoners had secured
a knife and cut the tongue out. They
had. rfplaced the board and covered it
up with paper stuck with soap. The
officers feel certain that they know the
ringleader, but Avfll pive out no names
at present.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, IS9B.
WILL THE VETO
BE FINAL?
Water Rates May at Last
Be Fixed by the
Courts.
A Doubt as to the Value of
Councilman Henneberry's
Resolution.
Pressure Being Brought to Bear on
Woodward to Change His
Vote.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 26.
Indignation over the action of the
majority of the Council in fixing water
rates has given place to calm thoughts,
and now the people of this city are
busy collecting legal opinions regarding
the validity of a resolution and the
value of the Mayor's veto when at
tached to a water-rate ordinance.
A thorough study of the water rates
as fixed by the committee after proper
consideration and taking of testimony
and the rate as arbitrarily fixed by the
Henneberry schedule shows that ac
cording to the water companies' own
figures they will receive in the event of
the infamous job being eventually suc
cessful nearly twice the income they
received last year. One proprietor of
many blocks has figured up that the
income for the allied companies if they
have their way will for the year com
mencing July 1 be not less than $600,
000. The significance of this can be
understood when it is remembered that
the very highest income ever received
by the Contra Costa Company when it
owned the entire Council and had no
competitor was but $404,000.
Yet. in the face of this statement the
agents of the companies are still de
claring that Oakland should be gen
erous to them because it is a good thing
to keep them both in the field.
Mayor Thomas has stated in to-day's
Call that he will veto the ordinance
when it comes before him and there is
some doubt as to whether his veto will
be effective or not in killing the meas
ure. The consensus of opinion of sev
eral attorneys, including that of City
Attorney Dow, is expressed in the fol
lowing facts:
The State constitution provides for
the fixing of water rates by municipal
bodies, but makes no mention of the
authority of the Mayor in the premises.
It also provides that under proper con
ditions cities can frame charters for
their own government. In the charter
by which Oakland is governed to-day is
a section providing that all ordinances
must go to the Mayor for his approval
or rejection and that if he does not take
action on such ordinances within ten
days of their final passage they become
a law by reason of their passage by the
Council.
The water rate ordinance which will
come up for final passage next week
will be sent to the Mayor and he will
veto it. Not being able to secure the
necessary eight votes to pass the meas
ure over the veto the ordinance will be
killed. The agents of the water com
panies declare that in such an event
the Mayor's veto will be of no value
because the Council is authorized by
the State constitution to fix the rates.
This view of the matter is contro
verted by several attorneys. They de
clare that if it be optional with the
Council to fix the rates by resolution
or ordinance, that having taken the
ordinance method, the ordinance must
go through the proper form of pro
cedure as prescribed in the charter,
and if vetoed by the Mayor is a dead
letter.
Then the question arises that, the
ordinance having been disposed of, will
the resolution which has not yet been
rescinded and which was passed last
Monday night hold good? City Attor
ney Dow advised the Council before a
vote was taken that any attempt to fix
rates in such a method without taking
VERY LIKE AN ELOPEMENT.
OAKLAND, Feb. 2fi. â Society was surprised to-day to learn tnat one
of Oakland's belles had been married over a month, and that Miss Eveline
Remillard is Mrs. George F. Chevalier.
The Remillards move in the highest circles of local society, and Miss
Remillard is the only daughter. She has for several seasons been a prom
inent figure at social gatherings, and is one of the most brilliant of Oak
land's younger set. No cards were sent out and no mention of the mar
riage has been made, but the event was solemnized at the Church of Notre
Dame dcs Victoires in San Francisco early in January. The groom is Mr.
George Chevalier, a member of the firm of wholesale liquor dealers across
the bay, and is quite wealthy.
"Mr. Chevalier preferred a quiet wedding for business reasons," said
Mrs. Remillard to-day. "My daughter also favored a ceremony that would
be very quiet. There was no elopement about it or any great secrecy. It
was simply a quiet wedding. My husband and I were present and Mr.
Chevalier's immediate relatives. We had no objection to the marriage. In
fact, it was an arrangement highly satisfactory to both families. They had
been engaged for some time and the wedding was not surprisingly sud
den to any of Ã¼b. No cards were issued, but that wae due to the wishes
of my daughter and Mr. Chevalier, 1 '
any testimony and without any consid
, eration as required by law would be in
valid, and he also said he would not
defend the resolution if it should be
i taken into the courts. To-day he re
; peated that opinion.
It was stated to-day that the Mayor
had not the power to revoke the ap
! pointment of a Councilman after hay
: ing once made it. Although he ap
j pqinted a Police Judge and revoked the
i appointment the revocation simply
i changed the name of the Judge, making
: him a Justice of the Peace, but did not
: put him out of office or in any way
change his standing. In the matter of
i the Councilmen it is different. Having
i made the appointment "for the unex
pired term" the appointee has the same
powers as any other Councilman, and
can only be removed by the process of
law, namely, impeachment for mal
feasance in office. The Council meets
again next Monday night, but although
j the water rates will not come up, there
I will undoubtedly he a large crowd on
1 hand to give an ovation to the mem
bers who are ho grossly violating their
trusts by saddling an illegal steal upon
the city.
Throughout all the talk and argu
ment made by the agents of the water
I companies, not one of them has re
ferred to the fact that the rates as es
tablished by the committee provide a
clear" interest of 6 per cent on the in
vestment, and in addition allow J25.000
which the law does not demand in the
â  interest of the corporations.
Extraordinary pressure is being
1 brought on Councilman Woodward to
induce him to change his vote when the
ordinance comes back for final passage.
NÂ«> one has much hope that such will
be the case, but there is of course a
1 chance that he may vote with the five
I who are mindful of their obligations.
HELD COURT IN PRISON.
John W. Lynn Attempts to Jump
Through the Court Room
Window.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â When brought
into the Police Court this morning
John \V. Lynn, who shot his wife five
times and then feigned iusanity for so
long, made a dive, to go through a win
dow of the, courtroom. The cracking
glass attracted the lobby, and three or
four men grabbed Lynn before he could
repeat his effort.
He seemed to possess superhuman
strength and fought like a demon,
throwing off the men and officers with
apparent ease. Clerk Hennessey
grabbed the man by the throat and
locked his arms behind him. The offi
cers then handcuffed the fellow, and he
was? led downstairs and locked in his
iron cell.
After the docket had been called
Judge Allen, Clerk Hennessey, Bailiff
Mitchell and other officers repaired to
the tank, where court was held, and
the case against Lynn continued until
March 12. Lynn was represented by
his attorney.

OAKLAND, l'eb. 26.â Mahara's Min

Caught in the Act.
OAKLAND, F.b. 26.â L,ouie Miller
and Oscar Mason, two young men
about 23 and 24 years of age,
were arrested today after steal
ing a bicycle from the rack of the
Y. M. C. A. just as they were ready to
board a train for Sin Francisco. The
police had it thete-^or a decoy, as were
several others, all of which were

Oakland News Items.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â A secret indict
ment was returned by the Grand Jury
last evening about 6 o'clock. It is sup
posed to be for J. W. Harbourne of
Alameda for forgery. Bail is placed
at $5000.
A Broken Arm.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 26.â While working
on a scaffold this afternoon in a building
at the West End, doing some plastering
Joseph A. McOowan of Taylor avenue
fell to the floor and sustained a double
fracture of his right arm. His f..,,t
slipped in some way and he fell some dis
tance, coming down with full force on
the arm. The ulna and radius bones were
snapped and tin- wriÃt was dislocated,
making a painful injury which will lay
him up for some time.
It is said that women criminals have
larger hands and feet than average wo
men.
CAN'T WEAR FULL DRESS.
NORMA L. CROWNER, Who Is Afraid That, Owing
to the Bite of a Dog on Her Left Arm,
She Will Not Be Able to Appear Decol
lete When She Grows Up.
Little 10-year-old Norma L. Crowner has been bitten by a ferocious bull
dog, the property of Horace L. A. Gerrish of Alameda, and from him she de
mands solace in the not unreasonable sum of $5000. While hydrophobia
threatens, Miss Crowner is farsighted enough to perceive that another ter
ror awaits her. The deep indentations made by the bulldog, as portrayed
in the photo taken a month after the operation, show that it will be impos
sible for Norma to blossom as a bud should when she grows up and
"comes out." The bud must wear low-necked waists and short cut sleeves,
and Norma's chances of making a hit are evidently sadly impaired by the
disfiguration, not to mention the shock theretofore appertaining. Therefore
the complaint, drawn up by Attorney F. Blandin of San Francisco, sagely
concludes:
"By reason of the bite Norma's left arm will be permanently scarred,
thereby rendering it impossible for her ever to appear in public in society
dress â all to her damuge in $5000."

Latest Doings Among the

How the Missionaries Enjoyed

A. P. Alexander Would Like to
Organize an Immense

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 25.
Tens of thousands of members of the
Congregational churches and Sunday
school pupils who subscribed to the
South Sea mission work of the Morning
Star will read with interest the follow
ing letter from A. P. Alexander, who
sends island news to The Call when
ever opportunity offers. The latest
news has come from the Marshall Isl
ands by way of China:
MOLOWONLAP, Marshall Islands.
As another opportunity has presented
Itself for sending a letter to my homo
friends, I as usual have taken advantage
of it.
After sending my last letter on Novem
ber 19 we raised anchor and made for the
Archer, which had come up outside of the
reef and dropped anchor. We did not
reach her until Into in the afternoon. She
is the same size as the Morning Star, but
can make from eight to ton knots
an hour. The captain very kindly gave
us a cra'.e of onions which were greatly
appreciated by us after our many din
ners composed of canned vegetables. By
5 p. m. jw were off for Arno, which place
or lagoon wÂ« did not reach until Monday
morning early. In trying to anchor at
this place wo broke our anchor, and had
to get out another which wo had on
board We remained at Arno Monday
and Tuesday, visiting the stations and
carrying workers to them from other sta
tions, while their workers wo took with
us for a short rest. From Arno we went
on to Mejuro, and here we had a fine an
chorage. We spent Thanksgiving at thiri
place, and had our Thanksgiving dinner
on board the Star, which consisted of
chicken soup, roast turkey, boiled onions,
mashed potatoes (canned), cranberry
sauce (canned), mince pie, nuts and cof
fee After dinner Captain and Mrs. Bray,
Miss Olin, Floyd Brock. Clarence Wickoff
and myself went in the long boat ovef
to the English (New Zealand) trading
station for a little visit. That night w-.
had a good downpour of rain and caught
plenty of water with which to wash.
The' next morning we left for the upper
station, which we reached shortly after
noon but owing to its location anchored
about three or four miles away, opposite
"Worths station. We saw Captain Worth
only for a few moments while he was
aboard the Star, but could see that he
was greatly changed. Monday morning
we took the schools on board and were
again under way. this time for Aur.
which we reached the next mprning at
10 45 As there was not much to do there
we raised anchor and reached this place
(Molowonlap)at 4 a. m., December 1. Here
we found a German schooner, and after
going aboard her and visiting with the
captain and officers returned to the Star,
where 1 am now writing to home friends.
I wish it were possible for me to give
all the children from the Sabbath schools,
both in Oakland and San Francisco, a
day's outing on at least one of these
little islands in the South Seas. It would
be a missionary object lesson they would
long remember. The Queer huts, many of
them hung with mats braided by the na
tives themselves; the odd-shaped canoes
darting over the water, perfectly man
aged by these native islanders, yet if we
were to attempt to take a ride in one
without their help we would probably
find ourselves in the water. I have taken
a number of pictures with my camera,
and hope to take home with me (im
prisoned In my camera) many of these
lovely scenes I have been so thoroughly
enjoying, so that the children may be
able to form some idea of the work on
these islands, even though they may not
be able to visit them for an "outing."
KUSAIE.
When I wrote my last letter, I really
thought it was my last chance of writ
ing home, but when I arrived in Kusaie
on our return trip. Captain Melander was
here with his trading schooner, just about
to sail for China, so I can send a line
by him.
After writing from the Marshall Islands
we went to a number of islands and then
back to Jaiuit, leaving there a week ago
to-day (Thursday) and reached here on
Saturday about 3 p. m.
The way we get our water is to take our
life boat (metal) and long boat (wood) up
the river and fill them full of water;
then tow them out to the ship and pump
the water out of them into the tanks.
To-morrow 1 t-xpect to go ashore in the
afternoon to siiend Christmas eve and
Christmas day ashore. The folks on
shore are planning to have Christmas
trees for the scholars, and also a good
time on Christmas day. In the morning
they will commence with a breakfast
about 8:30 or 9, followed by a grab-bag,
into which each one has placed some
small article. This will be followed with
games and other festivities, which will
consume the greater part of the day.
I am looking- forward to having a good
time, the only drawback being that 1 am
so many* miles from home and home
friends.
The many letters I took with me from
friends and scholars in the Sabbath
schools on both sides of the bay have
been a groat comfort to me. We watch
for the mail bag to be opened with great
interest. By the time this letter reaches
San Francisco the Star will be on its
homeward way, nearing Honolulu, and
each day lessening the distance between
us. ARTHUR P. ALEXANDER.
MALE SHOPLIFTERS.
Two Men Working the Stores of Ala
meda â Some Clothing Stolen.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 26.â A couple of men,
apparently from Oakland, have been
working the stores of Alameda recently
and taking advantage of the inattention
of the proprietors to help themselves to
things that attracted their fancy. On
Thursday they called at a clothing-store
on Park street, and while one of them
asked for some goods that required the
proprietor's presence in the back part of
the store the other presumably helped
himself to several pairs of trousers lying
in a pile in the front part. He must have
hidden them under his coat, for the pro
prietor noticed" nothing especially out of
the way until he began thinking the mat
ter over, and on making an investiga
tion found the trousers missing.
Two men answering the description of
this couple also visited the store of Julius
Brown, on Webster street, and attempted
to steal several pairs of trousers. Mr.
Brown was waiting on another customer
in the rear of the store, an 1 the thieves
coolly started to make up a pacKhg< of
the clothes. Mrs. Brown was in the rear
room, from which there is a peephole into
the store, and chahcing to look through
this, she saw the fellows in the very uct
of stealing the goods. She at once
alarmed her husband, who started after
a policeman; but the men ran down Web
ster street and escaped. Two fellows an
swering their description have been no
ticed on the Oakland cars coming this
way lately, and they are believed to be
the thieves.

regain her room by crawling out of the
window, over an air shaft and into the
window of her room. In some way she
missed her hold and fell to the ground.
She was picked up unconscious and taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where it was
found that she had sustained fractures of
both clavicles and the base of the skull.
The doctors have no hope of her recovery.

TOWNE'S PLEA
FOR SILVER
The Eloquent Minne
sotan Addresses a
Crowded House.
He Learned to Revere
Lincoln, but He Cannot
Tolerate Hanna.
Says Goldbugs Prevented Rec
ognition of Cuban
Patriots.
FEELS SURE OF VICTORY.
Firmly Announces That Silver Forces
Ara Certain to Win Their
Battles.
Ex-Congressman Charles A. Towne
of Minnesota spoke to a large and en
thusiastic audience at Metropolitan
Temple last night, his theme being the
silver campaign and its purposes.
Mr. Towne is a man of far more than
average ability as an orator. His man
ner is largely that of a well-trained
actor, his voice has great compass and
power, and his conclusions are an
nounced with firmness and dignity.
Though his speech lasted for more
than two hours, few people left the
house, and he was interrupted by fre
quent bursts of applause.
"This sliver campaign has only just
begun," was the way he opened. This
statement at once showed that he was
a fighter, for he followed the asser
tion with the declaration that Bryan
had really come out of the campaign
triumphant and that the defeated
members of the great silver party,
nearly 7,000,000 in number, had the air
of victors rather than of men who had
lost a cause. They were beginning
again, he said, to fight for human free
dom.
The speaker held that the great
trouble with MeKinley is that he is a
goldbug. "He appointed a goldbug for
his Secretary of the Treasury," said
the speaker, "then recommended to
Congress the plans of the Gold Demo
crats of Indianapolis. Does this look
like bimetallism? In fact, there is
nothing in all the conduct of the Re
publican party to remind one of its
glorious past. I learned to revere Lin
coln and they now give me a Mark
Hanna as a model. This degeneration
shows the extent of the degeneration
of the party. I am getting along all
right and I have lost no sleep because
I was defeated for Congress, for I ex
pect yet to be one of the great throng
that will help to escort to the White
H<>use the greatest Democrat the
country has produced since Abraham
Lincoln. I can well call Lincoln a
Democrat and Bryan a Republican, for
both were, like Washington and Jef
ferson, men who had faith in the peo
ple and whose doctrines are consist
ent with the ideas of a government of
thp people, for the people and by the
people."
A large part of the arguments of the
?vening were the well-known assump
:irms of the silver men that the appre
ciation of gold is steadily making a
race of slaves of all who are not the
owners of bonds.
A striking part of the address was
that wherein the speaker narrated his
experiences as a member of Congress
at the time the Cuban question was
before the House. He held that there
was a time two years ago when the
rr.untry could have done a great deal
to settle the question consistently with
peace and honor, but the gold power
that owns the bonds interfered, as in
thÂ«> case of the Turks and Armenians,
and prevented the recognition of the
belligerents.
"I do not hesitate to say," stated the
orator, "that some sort of a deal is now
on. as reported by the newspapers,
whereby Mark Hanna is negotiating
for peace in some way that will be
agreeable to the owners of Cuban
, bonds. It 1s said that the bonds are to
be indorsed by the United States Gov
ernment."
It was then attempted to show that
there is every reason to believe that
the steady depreciation of the products
of human industry, by reason of the
gold standard, will reach a point that
the people will not endure. He said it
was, according to great economists, not
a question of gold or silver, but merely
a' â¢ question- of how much the people
would suffer from the inequalities of
the. old standard before they would re
volt. â¢
At the conclusion of the address there
waa prolonged applause and much
cheering. The Democratic Central
Clute attended as a body, dressed in
white ducking.

Mr. Marshal left the theater on Fri
day night and started up Stockton street
toward Pine. When he arrived at the
stone wall surrounding the old Buckley
place, between gutter and Bush streets,
two men suddenly stepped out from the
shadows and one, presenting a pistol at
his head, commanded him to throw up
his hands.
Marshal obeyed, and the fellow's com
panion, who was armed with a black
jack, went through him, taking a purse
containing^ a small sum of money and
the other above-mentioned articles.
The matter was reported to the police.
BURGLARS ARE BUSY.
The Police Are Able to Make Several
Arrests.
Thomas Btanton and Thomas Roach,
two boys, broke into the grocery of L.
W. Schneider, Twenty-sixth and Valencia
streets, about 2 o'clock on Friday morn
rng. Mrs. Schneider heard them and be
gan to scream. They rushed out of the
place into the arms of Policemen King
and Young, who arrested them on a
charge of burglary.
Knutt Frass was discovered at an early
hour yesterday morning by Policeman
Feld trying t,o force open the lock on the
door of W. A. Weldon's carpet-beating

knife. He was sent to the City Prison j
and booked on a charge of attempt?!

booked against Salvini and Brown, and
the two others were booked for a public
institution. Since Sunday night they
twice broke into the Sonoma Packing 1 I
Company's warehouse at 1240 Battery
street, stole a lot of stuff an-1 destroyed I
a considerable quantity more. They also i
broke into a butcher-shop at Sansome

of the gang, and has been twice arrested
for robbery.
THEY WERE AFTER
GROOM'S SCALP
Ryan and Green Claim That
National Clubmen Have
"Welched."
Money Said to Have Been Brought
Back at the Point of a Revolver.
Everybody Talking, i
If the words of an eyewitness are to
be taken as true and there seems no
legitimate reason to doubt them,
"Fight Promoter Groom of the Na
tional Club had a very close call yester
day when he came to settle up finan
ces with Ryan and Green, the welter
weights who put up so game a battle
at Woodward's Pavilion the night be
fore. In fact, it is claimed that as a re- j
i
suit of the wrangling and an attempt of
Groom to evade paymerjt he was made
to come to terms at a revolver's muz
zle.
It seems that the articles of agree
ment provided that the two men
should have 60 per cent of the gross
gate receipts, but should be guaran
teed the sum of 54000. The receipts
were said to figure only $4800, and the
two men demanded the $4000 instead of
60 per cent of this sum when they
went into Groom's hat store in com
pany with Al Smith, Ryan's mana
ger.
A hot wrangle ensued, according to
the tale told by George Harting, the
club's timekeeper at the fight, and one
of the fighters grabbed up a sackful
of silver, whereupon Groom laid hold of
a sack of gold coin and started for the
door, but was forced to return at the
revolver's point. It is further stated
that the men were finally forced to take
the 60 per cent.
Smith denies that revolvers w^re
drawn, but admits that there was a
good deal of trouble over the money
question. He adds that Ryan is will
ing to fight Green again under the aus
pices of the Empire Club, but will never
again let the National Club men have
charge of a fight in which he engages.
Groom admits also that there was a
war of words, but asserts that the $4000
was only a paper agreement, and that
it was understood by both men that 60
per cent of the gross gate receipts were
to go in any case.
"I heard there were some wild stories
going round about Ryan and myself
having trouble with Groom and Gibbs,"
said Green last night, "but there is no
truth In them. There was no attempt
on Groom's part to leave the store with
a bag of money, nor were there any
pistols drawn.
"I simply went to the store to get
what was due me as a participant in
the fight and while there met Ryan.
Groom stated to us that owing to the
smallness of the house he could not
live up to his original agreement with
out loss to himself and partner. He
therefore offered us 60 per cent of
$4800, the amount realized. We ob
jected to his going back on his con
tract and told him so. Arguments
were of no avail, however, and seeing
we could do no better, we took the per
centage, amounting to a little over
$2800, eacb taking $1400.
"1 am a friend of both Groom and
Gibbs, and dislike to talk about the
matter, but as long as you are familiar
with the details I do so. I think that
they should have stood by their agree
ment, even though they did not realize
a large sum. Had they done so they

would â¢ have made a name among the
fraternity and gained the confidence
of the people. I took the amount of
fered, as that was all there was in
sight. I do not intend to take legal
steps, as the law gives us no redress."
Smith denies that Ryan will ever
fight Walcott. as the welter-weight
draws the color line. T t is admitted by
all local sports, count out or not, that
Green was a beaten man.

RAG TIME HOGAN
WAS ROBBED
Black Patti's Leading Man
Lost His Dia
mond.
Prize Fighter Tom Lansing and
His Friend Arrested on
Suspicion-
Rigid Search Failed to Reveal the
Whereabouts of the Lost
Gem.
Ernest Hogan, author of "All Coons
: Look Alike to Me," lost a $750 diamond
solitaire stud yesterday at the matinee
jof the Black Patti Company at the
: California Theater. He values the pin
highly, because he says he paid the
; price named to the widow of W. J.
Scanlan, the Irish comedian, when he
bought from her $15,000 worth of the
jewelry of the dead actor.
Hogan's story is that, while he was
waiting to go on the stage for the mat
inee at. the California Theater yester
day he was visited in his dressing room
by Sandy Sanborn, a friend of his, and
Tom Lansing, a prize fighter from Ken
tucky. There was present at the time
a colored man named Thomas Trice,
who sat on a trunk at the end of thp
room. Sanborn cam*' with his friend
for the purpose of hearing the Black
Patti and his friend Hogan sing and
went to Hogan's room, in order to get
seats for the performance. Hogan went
out to do his turn, and in the interim
had some one sh<r\v his visitors some
unoccupied seats in the dress circle.
When he came back he found that the |
diamond stud which he had left in the
bosom of his shirt hanging on a hook
was missing.
He at once raised an outcry in rag
time, and Police Officer Thomas R.
Flinn of the California Street Station j
responded. Hogan pointed out Lansing j
and Sanborn in the dress circle. Flinn j
called upon them to throw up their j
hands, and they complied. Then the i
officer searched the seats and the vicin- !
ity, after having first satisfied himself
that the diamond was not on the per- I
sons of the suspects. He then took the I
men to the California Street Station, ;
where they were obliged to strip and
submit to a more rigorous search in the \
presence of Lieutenant Esola. Nothing
but $1 50 in silver coin and a few love !
letters were found on the men. and the !
police generously refrained from perus- i
ing the letters.
The men's names were placed upon j
the small book, and they will be de
tained pending further investigation. I
When Hogan came into the station he ;
was confronted by Lansing:
"You're a nice fellow," remarked
Lansing, with a sneer.
"What's the matter?" Inquired Ho
gan, in evident trepidation.
"Why didn't you arrest the coon '
that was in the room when you went
nut?"
Mr. Hogan rolled his eyes for awliile,
and then replied: "He was searched."
Then he retired to another part of the
st^t|on and sat down near an officer.
"I've been here only a few months,"
remarked Lansing to a Call reporter,
"and I have put two men on my prize
ring record. If I ever meet that coon
in a dark alley he'll be the third man
on my record of knockouts."
After this episode Hogan was visibly
nervous. "I don't charge nobody," he
said. "All I want is to get my pin
back."
Hogan leaves the city to-day for the
southern part of the State, and he ex
pressed his regret that he could nat
stay to prosecute the case. When asked
why he did not procure the arrest of
Tom Trice, he replied that Trice was
an old-time friend of his; that he had
intrusted hundreds of dollars to Trice,
and had never found him unfaithful.
The men were released late last night,
as the evidence did not seem sufficient
to warrant their being held.
BAYS FOR A
BELOVED BARD
Dr. Friedrich K. Castelhun
Agreeably Surprised by
His Friends.
De Frieclrich Karl Castelhun, whose
seventieth birthday was so enthusiastic
ally celebrated last night by a large num
ber of German-American citizens in the
hall of the Sehlaraffia Club, 411 Bush
street, was born February 27, 1828, in
Nordheim, near the ancient city of
Worms on the Rhine, Germany. At the
age of IS he graduated from the Gym
nasium of Benshcim, where he received a
thorough classical education, and in 1847
came with his parents to the United
States. Here young Castelhun took up
the study of medicine and completed af
terward his medical education at the Uni
versities of Wurzburg, Vienna, Prague
and Berlin. After his return to America
ho settled in St. Louis, Mo., and became
soon a prominent physician. In 1575-76 he
lived in San Francisco, but returned to
St. Louis. In 18.55 he came again to San
Francisco and has ever since lived here.
Dr. Castelhun is one of the foremost
German-American poets of the United
States, and his poems appeared last year
in their second edition. There is much of
the grace, clearness and power of Schil
ler and Goethe in his verses, and to read
his splendid hexameters means to admire
them. Professor M. D. Learned, at the
head of the department of Germanic lan
guages in the University of Pennsylvania,
recently wrote of the distichs of Dr. Cas
telhun: "What makes them particularly
agreeable to my ear is the admirable co
incidence of rhetoric and metrical pause
at the caesura. I have been reading and
comparing some of Castelhun's distichs
with classical German examples and I
must bestow upon him the laurel."
Dr. Castelhun is essentially a politica.l
poet, or knight valiant in the service or'
religious, political and social liberties.
His poems are full of the best features of
the German character, the proverbial
honesty, the sincerity and reliability of
character, the deep love for the family,
the home, the old and the new country.
However, many of his choicest produc
tions could never be published in the
Fatherland, they being altogether too
democratic to suit those in power, ami
for this reason the collection of poems, a
handsome volume of 260 pages, had to be

REVOLUTION IN THE AIR: SAN SALVADOR READY FOR IT
"/ expect an uprising at any moment, but when they strike they will find me well prepared, for I will not
submit to being forcibly ejected!'
REVOLUTION is smoldering
â¢ jf*\ in Salvador, ready to break
â  ' .a ' \ into sudden flame. So gui
"â¢ ff J etly an( * secretly are both
â¢â ."â¢j^^g sides preparing for the out
.'. hT I break that the foreign press
' m' : is not even cognizant of the
: â â '.''. . fact that trouble is imminent.
:.:".'.â¢- â¢ .'â â¢ A professional revolutionist

.'â -â "' . â¢ ' munition for the revolution
ists; -Everybody is not aware that
there are "professional revolutionists."
Lilt is with no slight degree of doubt
that. I sought the man engaged in this
â  strange business, although I had been
foretold -of him and his trade by one
of the most prominent members of the
local S.ilvadoran colony.
-I found him short and stout, with
swarthy skin and hair in odd contrast
to. his twinkling blue eyes; just the
sort â¢of man 'one would label "doctor,
lawyer, merchant," but never "chief."
Or revolutionist. He greeted me in broken
Hispanio-Araericanus that gave token
.of. a New England ancestor. "It is
from my Yankee grandmother that I
get my â¢ business instincts," he ex
plained, later, on.
I had not counted business interests
lial in the make-up of a profes
sional revolutionist, but then nearly
â¢ ihing he said upset my precon
iceived notions of a "revolutionist."
k 'Revolution?" tie began, when ques
tioned. "My dear senorita, I assure
you as an honorable gentleman that as
far as I know there is not the slightest
clar.L'fer of n revolution In my country."
Then why," I said, struggling to
hlue all I knew about his secret mis-
Bion, "should President Gutierrez write
this statement?" And I proceeded to
read bJm an extract from the letter.
"Ah, I see you are well Informed, so
I will not deny that there may be a
revolution."
The fact that he had given his word
to the contrary but a moment before
did not seem to trouble him in the
slightest.
"And you are here," I continued,
Slowly, so as to fully enjoy his look of
Burprise, "to purchase ammunition for
the revolutionists?"
I!*- <lir] not look a bit surprised, hut
he stared at me in point blank anger.
J got frightened. But before I could
carry <>ut my resolution to run for the
door the bland senor recovered himself,
ami suavely assured me that he was
hero for his health. "But," he add^d.
with an ahom, "I have heard that there
is a gentleman here on .such a business
as you are pleased to mention."
"And this gentleman when he has
purchased thp ammunition will he go
back to fight in the revolution?" I
queried.
"He will go back to Salvador as
suredly, but he will not take an ac
tive part in the revolution."
"1 should think if he were heart and
soul in the cause he would wish to
fight."
"My dear s^norita, his duty is to at
tend to the business part of the affair.
Besides h<- might get killed, and that
would prevent his being of any use i n
the next revolution. Of course he Is
always taking great risks because if
the other side once get suspicious of
his real business they would kill him.
They would what you call assassinate
him."
"What are his reasons for allying
himself with the revolutionists?"
"It's a matter of business. A mer
chant sells his goods to the highest
bidder. This man manages the busi
ness details of a revolution for the side
that pays him best."
"How long has he been in this busi
ness?"
SAX FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1898.
EXTRACT FROM *A RECENT LETTER WRITTEN "BY PRESIDENT GUTIERREZ.
FROM PRESIDENT GUITERREZ' LETTER
ON THE APPROACHING REVOLUTION.
* * * I am prepared in case of
revolution, and I will make an exam
ple of those who disturb public order.
Meanwhile they are heaping upon
my head daily all manner of insults
through the local press, headed here
by the students. I shall take strenu
ous measures to suppress these scan
dals.
Even if a revolution does not break
out, I fear that the Presidential elec
tion will take alarming proportions.
I am fully determined to be neutral
in the election â that is to say, I shall
not lean toward any candidate.
No personal sacrifice will deter me
from maintaining public order during
the election.
"SANTA MARIA! WHAT SORT Of A MAN IS THIS PRESIDENT? OUT WITH HIM!" THEY
SHOUTED. EVEN WHILE THEY SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS AND POLICE BEGAN TO
CHARGE THE MOB.
"Oh, he has looked after half a dozen
affair?, some bier and some of no con
sequence."
"All in Salvador?"
"No. This will be the first one in
Salvador. It would not do to conduct
tho business for one country alone. He
would become known quickly and BO
be killed, what you call assassinated."
"And where were the other revolu
tions he was engaged in?"
"Oh, Guatemala and the other coun
tries down there."
"Then youâ l mean this revolutionary
agentâhas no personal feelings in the
However, I fear they will not wait
for the election, but use force of arms
to shorten my term.
Notwithstanding that my enemies
are convinced that I do not crave for
power, th&t I do not seek re-election
and that I uphold and always shall up
hold the principle of rotation in office,
yet the office-seekers and boodlers
are so anxious that they cannot wait
until my term naturally expires.
For this reason I expect an uprising
at any moment, but when they strike
they will find me fully prepared, for 1
will not submit to being forcefully

Right and justice are on my side
and they had best beware. * * *
matter? He is not personally opposed
to President Gutierrez?"
"Gutierrez! He is a fool, because he
has r.o business sense. But he is a
po.id fighter. He is too honest for those
people down there. No, this agent I
speak to you of is not opposed to Gu
tierrez personally. Only, you see, the
revolution gives him a chance to make
some business for himself. It pays;
you understand."
"Who hired this man to come up here
and buy ammunition?"
The senor smiled with an air that
spoke plainer than words: "What a
gudgeon she must think me!" Aloud
he simply said, "How should I know?"
"Oh," I replied, innocently, "I thought
you might have a faint idea. Of course,
you couldn't know positively."
"Well, there are men who want to
take Gutierrez's place in the chair of
the President, and. perhaps, one of
them hired him. Most likely the man
who will head the revolution."
Then he went on to tell me that the
students were playing the principal
roles In stirring up the revolution.
They did not realize that Gutierrez
was not responsible for the condition
of affairs. They are young and hot
blooded and anxious to have their
first chance in a revolution.
General Gutierrez should thoroughly
understand how to cope with the new
revolutionists, for he was leader of
the lnst revolutionary party that suc
ceeded in overthrowing President
Ezeta.
Although the presidents of the Central
American republics are supposed to
be elected every four years by popular
vote, the srrial! matter of law is over
looked and the President retains the
office as long as he sees fit or until
some other man is strong enough' to
oust him. The important question is
then settled by a revolution, the leader
of the winning side taking the Presi
dency and thus saving the people the
trouble of casting votes.
General Gutierrez, it is believed, was
influenced purely by patriotic motives
when he headed the revolution against
the Ezetas. It is said they had been
using, or rather misusing, their power
toward private ends, making conces
sions in return for financial considera
tions, etc.
A band of forty men met one night In
Santa Anna, elected Rafael Antonio
Gutierrez leader, gathered a thousand
recruits, and Ftormed the Government
stronghold. The Ezetas had heard mut
terlngs of the coming storm, had pre
pared themselves, and had forced into
their army twenty thousand recruits.
These men were duly armed and or
dered to Santa Anna. It looked as
though General Gutierrez would be
powerless to match his little band
against such apparently formidable
odds.
But it is one thing to lead a horse to
â water and another thing to make him
drink. Of the 20,000 Government re
cruits ordered to Santa Anna not 500
obeyed. The men took their arms and
drifted off to their various homes.
General Gutierrez and his followers
easily captured the fort, took posses
sion of the ammunition and made
short, work of all opposition.
When the Ezetas were ousted It was
naturally supposed that Gutierre*
would step into the vacant Presiden
tial chair. The victor, however, dis
claimed any wish to be President,
much to the surprise of everybody. As
far back as the memory of the oldest
Central American went there had
never been a man who had ever headed,
a revolution execept to gain power for
himself.
Gutierrez, the victor, like Cincln
natus of old, wanted to return to his
coffee plantation and spend his life in
peace and in rural pursuits. At least
he said so.
He suggested two of his generals as
best fitted to assume the responsibili
ties of the high office.
But on all sides the cry went up:
"Gutierrez! Gutierrez must be Pres
dent!'
It was finally decided that for a year
he should be dictator and he accepted
the trust. The revolutionists declare
it was the old trick of Caesar being of
fered the crown. At any rate to most
of his countrymen Gutierrez proved a
man of good common sense, thor
oughly just and honest, and brave in
battle. But time proved he was not
fitted to cope with the baseness and
intrigue of the Government depart
ments.
At the end of the year of dictator
ship he was proclaimed President in
spite of low mutterlngs of discontent.
At first they were almost inaudible,
but soon they swelled to a chorus that
went rumbling up and down the land.
Gutierrez discovered that each year
swelled the list of his enemies alarm
ingly. At the head of the discontented
now are the merchants, especially
those who love a President that in
clines for a consideration to wink at
smuggling. An honest President means
smaller profits for such merchants.
Then some of the office-holders at pres
ent are carefully watched to prevent
their filling their private pockets with
public money. Added to these are the
regular starved office-seekers, to whom
a change in government is hailed as a
chance for another lease of easy-going
life.

EVERYDAY LIFE IN HAVANA DURING THE WAR SCARE
A CITY OF PLEASURE LOVERS
WHO ATTEND BULL FIGHTS
WITH HALF A MILLION DEAD
OR MISSING AND DANCE AND
GAMBLE IN THE FACE OF
DEATH.
No City in the World Is Just Now So Much in the American Eye as
Havana, in Whose Harbor Our Noble Battle-Ship Was Blown Up
Last Week. Here Is a Vivid Picture of Life in the Cuban Capital
as It Is To-day. â¢ â¢
THIS sport Is purely Spanish. We
Cubans do not enjoy It, and who
knows that before long it may be
prohibited by an act of Con-
gress?" The speaker was a hand- j
lome man, -with a strong, thoughtful
lace, as he looked down into the bull
ring in Havana several Sundays ago.
Mazzintlni, Spain's great toreador, had
just brought a magnificent Mexican bull j
to his knees by a quick, daring thrust. ;
The thousands of spectators who lined
the amphitheater, tier upon tier, were
applauding frantically. Hats were be
ing shied, into the ring with reckless
generosity, only to be disdainfully
thrown back to the seats and scrambled
for by the owners.
It was not such a crowd as one sees j
In Madrid or Seville. As the first speak- j
er remarked, bull fighting, or bull
butchering, is not a Cuban sport; it is
essentially Spanish, and above every
thing- Spanish in Havana now hangs
the dread of Americans and their Con
â¢â gress'. â  Cubans love baseball. They do
,' not play ii now, because, silly as it
may seem, AYeyler forbade the game.
This only makes them love it all tha
more, Bays the correspondent of the
New York Herald.
All through the eager, excited crowd
on that Sunday afternoon sat sad-eyed
boys in the uniform of Spain, with their
Mauser rifles over their knees. Next
to, the president's box lolled half a doz
en officers high in command. It had
been rumored in Havana that there
was to be another popular outcry
against autonomy, and the sad-eyed
boy soldiers were there with their Mau-
eer Titles to see to it that the dignity
of the latest Spanish experiment for
holding the island was not insulted.
Poor autonomist ministers! They might
be hanged by the insurgents if they
â¢went -into the bushes to- talk "autono
my," and it takes Mauser rifles to en
force respect for them in the bull ring
of Havana.
The last bull is butchered and the
crowd riles peacefully out of the ring
and starts on a trot for the ferryboat
that runs across the bay, There was
no outcry, and Havana's narrow
streets swallow up its bull n'trhtlng po-p
uiatir.n only to disgorge it on the prom
enades of the Central Park when the
tights are lit and the military band
plays inspiring martial airs. Around
and around the park the crowds stroll,
smoking strong cigarettes or occasion
ally breaking ranks to eat ice cream
at one nt the numerous cafes.
All Havana eats ice cream. They
make it of the most unheard-of fruits
and eat It with delicate little sugar
wafers. The stroll is over by 11, and
then the city is wrapped in ita nerv
ous, fitful sleep. Away in the hills.
Within .uunshot of the city, lie the lynx
eyed insurgents, watching the lights of
the city as they darken in the streets
ami theaters; watching for an oppor
tunity to steal into the suburbs and
dash back into the bushes with qui
nine or cartridges.
Nrght after night the same scene is
witm-ssr-d; occasionally a train of cars
is blown up with dynamite and shots
are fired into the disabled train, but
Havana has ceased to be even dis
turbed by these events. An obscure
paragraph in a local paper gives mea
ger details, and the incident is dropped.
It is truly astonishing how aecus
*Â»xned one becomes even to the, most
tragic affairs of life. In Cuba people
are dying by hundreds.: The Arch
bishop of Havana has said that his
parish registers show over 500,000
missing since the war began.- Almost
every woman in the street wears deep
mourning; plantations are burned and
devastated; the tramp of armed men
and the rattle 'of gun carriages
awaken all from morning slumbers;
food Is scarce and becoming scarcer:
the bare pecessities of life are dear
and becoming deafer; yet the music
and the dance go on. There is money
to gamble at the clubs and pennies
for the poor to risk in lottery schemes.
Spain has spent Â£56,000,0.00 to put
down the rebellion; her representa
tives are pent up in Havana; yet- the
national pastime â the bull fight â goes
on every Sunday as if there were no
hungry, fiercely determined men in the
hills.
In fact, people are tired talking
war; in society they talk of something
else unless some novel incident oc
curs. Widows and mothers seem to
have drained their dregs of sorrow,
and go about sad eyed, but composed,
as if their grief were too deep for
tears.
At Key West I saw the father of
Qeneral Aranguren. He is an old
man, with an iron face and piercing
eye. Ho ?eems to live in a dazed
past. Every night he is about the
village postoffice awaiting news of
anything or anybody. Occasionally a
phantom of the past in the shape of
dome old friend comes before his eyes
and he breaks into boyish ecstasy. He
has one son under the sod and an
other "In the bushes," as they say
in Cuba. He doesn't expect to see the
second one again, so he dreams on and
plans to tell the story of his con's
death to the world.
What is left of Cuban society -wraps ]
itself in exclusiveness and awaits its j
time. The wealthy land owners at
the beginning of the war sought re
fuge in Europe or the United States.
Most of them ha< no thought of re
duced incomes. Then came burned i
fields and impoverished tenants; edicts I
of the Government forbidding th<; J
foreclosure of mortgages, but . always ;
taxes more and more. Incomes wore ;
reduced, many stopped. In order to
protect what they had, many once J
rich returned to Havana with scarce- j
ly enough to buy the coarser necessi- i
ties of life. But it is still an ex- I
elusive aristocracy, as proud as the j
first families of ruined Virginia, and,
like them, rebel to the bone.
There is no doubt about where the
native Cuban aristocracy stands in
this war. They were never frugal
people. On the contrary, the men ;
spent money like drunken sailors. Nor
were they good business men. The :
commercial control of the island
passed away from them years ago,
and the American, Spaniard, English- \
man and German became their mas
ters. Cubans complain of unjust dis- |
crimination against them by the Span- '
iards, but where they are pitted i
fi gainst each other in the end the
Spaniard wins. It is ability that tells
in the long run. Years of repression
and unjust discrimination have not
ruined the Hebrew. Several scions of
the old regime were comparing notes
on old times one evening in my hear
ing.
""Why," said one, "we sometimes <
came into Havana with big wagons
and drove out to the plantations a
whole band of music. We would then
invite hundreds of our kinsmen and
friends, and keep up a jollification for;
two, three aiÂ»l sometimes four weeks." \
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, StTSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1893.
After that T did not wonder why the
frugal Spaniard or thrifty Yankee got
the unper hand- in trade. â¢ ;
Just at present the most feared man
to. American tourists in Havana is Dr.
Brunner of the Marine Hospital Corps,
stationed in Havana for the" purpose
of issuing Health permits, without
which no one can land at any of the
ports in the States. Dr. Brunner does
his duty with strict impartiality; hence
his unpopularity in some quarters. It
is astonishing how prone we Ameri
cans are to evade laws and chuckle in
wardly at the performance. When we
cannot we are indignant and begin to
protest and splutter- about outrages.
There was a long line of expectant ap
plicants for clean bills of health when
I made my application.
As an act of kindness to those con
templating a visit to Havana it should
be stated that every one must be vac
cinated. If you go there without this
precaution Dr. Brunner will insist upon
having it done and will refuse to issue
a permit until a reasonable length of
time has elapsed to note the effect, us
ually twelve days. The first applicants
were a smart little bride from Charles
ton and her husband on their weddding
tour. They had been vaccinated a
month before and they were all right.
The next applicant was a drummer,
who tried to pass on the strawberry
mark in the middle of his back. Re
sult, the wholesale damnation of the
Government, vaccination, medical in
spectors and everything in general.
"Are these stringent regulations ne
cessary?" I asked.
"Why, of course they are," replied
the doctor. "I do not meddle with the
politics of the situation, but I have
made up my mind to one thing and that
is that annexation would be the great
est blessing to the United States from a
sanitary point of view. Within the last
century the Southern States have lost
more money and people by yellow fever
and smallpox epidemics, directly trace
able to this port, than the whole nation
would lose in five wars. If the United
States owned the island the city of Ha
vana would .be cleaned out, and made
as healthful as any place in the world
situated in the tropics."
This opinion is shared by all the
men of any knowledge of modern sani
tary methods with whom I talked. The
bay of Havana is pinched by two capes
at the mouth, and then expands into a
large basin. The tide does not ebb and
flow sufficiently to carry away the re
fuse matter now dumped into it. As a
result, the whole bay reeks with foul
matter; so filthy is the water that Cap
tain Sigsbeee washed the decks of the
ill-fated Maine every morning with
water brought, from the shcr<Â». The
city itself has only the rudest system
of sewers, although the water supply
is excellent, and was obtained some
years ago at an enormous cost.
The best troops in the Spanish ser
vice do not belong to the line, but to
that admirable corps of military po
: lice known as the Orden Publico. This
lis a corps d'elito, composed of young
; .soldiers, Spaniards to a man, all of
whom have been selected from the
; regular army on account of the
superior intelligence and physical
qualities. They perform regular po
lice patrol duty and do it with a de
', gree of dignity and courtesy that
; might well serve as a model for de
! portment for the Greater New York
! police force. Their uniform is d!s
! tinctly military, consisting of a dark
blue tunic faced with red. wide blue
i trousers with red stripes, and a jaunty
; cap, something after the fashion of the
i French fatigue cap, until recently
worn in our army. Ordinarily thtj
are armed with a huge revolver, worn
on the left side in a buff leather
sh< ath, and .1 short, straight sword.
They are all admirably set up, and
their arms, equipments and uniforms
are the very pink of perfection, in
striking contrast to the slovenliness
and dilapidation of weapons and cloth
ing that characterise the Spanish sol
dier of the line.
All tourists who have had occasion
to come into contact with an Order
SCIENTISTS TELL US HOW WE THINK
AT last scientists seem to be on
the point of finding out what
happens in the brain when a
person thinks. It has long been
known that the brain is the
thinking organ, but just how
the making of thought comes about has
been a puzzle.
The celebrated Cabanis solved the
matter off-hand by saying that the
brain secretes thought as the liver se
cretes bile. This terse saying passed
into common use, but soon came to be
recognized as a clever speech rather
than an explanation of the mystery.
Now, however, the most recent re
searches of the microscopists are mak
ing it appear that after all the saying is
not so far wrong, but that, correctly in
terpreted, it in some measure expresses
the facts. Of course thought, being in
tangible, is not properly to be com
pared with bile or any other physical
substance, but it appears that the pro
cesses In the brain which produce
thought, and without which thinking is
impossible, are strictly comparable to
those changes in the liver and other or
gans which produce the tangible secre
tions.
A committee of British physicians,
acting jointly, has for some years been
giving particular attention to this topic,
and their researches, though not yet al
together complete, already show some
very interesting results, which, taken
together with those of investigators on
the continent, let us see a long way into
the intricacies of the brain.
It has shown unequivocally, for exam
ple, that a brain cell, which is the really
important part of the brain, actually
loses part of its substance during ac
tion. The brain cells of persons and of
animals that have died during a period
of great exhaustion from over-exertion
are found to be greatly changed from
j the condition of the normal cell during
times of health and vigor. The cell of
the exhausted brain, instead of being
plump and full of nervous matter, is
found to be hollowed out of "vacuolat
ed," a cavity within Us substance hav
i ing formed and being filled with water.
| This means that a part of the cell sub
i stance has been actually consumed dur
i ing the time of brain activity, precisely
' as coal is consumed when one gets heat
I from a furnace.
It Is found, further, that if an ani
i mal whose brain cells are thus ex
] hausted is permitted to rest and to
! sleep its cells rapidly recuperate, new
| material being supplied from the blood
until the vacuolatlon has disappeard,
and the cell is practically as good a3
â  new again. This explains why sleep is
â¢ necessary to our existence. During
waking hours our brains are literally
; worn away, and sleep is the state dur
x uolico will cheerfully testify to his I
unfailing courtesy. It was this corps
which, equipped as infantry with Rem- ;
ircgtorr rifles, distinguished itself by the ;
masterly manner in which it handled
the mobs during the riots, without once i
having occasion to fire a shot..
Although the evidences of war to be !
seen in Havana are. scanty enough, it!
is amazing how frequently the insur- |
gents manage to run the guard of the
outposts and make rorays into the
Buburbs. Hardly a week passes that i
ing which the repair shops of the brain
make good the damage of the waking
hours. Thus the brain of a person who
suffers from insomnia is in the condi
tion of a locomotive which is run night
and day without going to the repair
shops; disaster must ultimately result.
It is not sleep alone, however, that
rests the brain cell, though sleep is ab
solutely essential to recuperation of the
brain as a whole. But not all parts of
the brain are involved in any one kind
of mental effort. The blood supply of
the brain is so arranged that by expul
sion or contraction of different arteries
parts of the brain may be flusheu wi.ui
blood and other parts dammed off, so to
speak, somewhat as .the various cur
rents of an irrigated field are regulated
by the gardener. And as rapid ilow of
blood is essential to great mental ac
tivity, this means that one part of the
brain may be very actively at work
while another part is restinsr and re
cuperating.
Thus it is that a person suffering from
brain fatigue may leave his desk and
go out into the fields with a golfstick,
or on the highways with a bicycle, and,
by diverting his mind, give the over
worked cells a chance to rest and re-
cuperate.
But it must not be overlooked that
such exercise involves other brain
cells,, which, in turn, become ex
hausted, and that, in the end, for the
recuperation of the brain as a whole,
sleep js absolutely essential. No recre
ation, no mediqine, no stimulant will
take its place. The man who does not
give himself sufficient hours of sleep,
or who is unable to sleep when he
makes the effort, is literally burning
away his brain substance, and can no
more keep on indefinitely in this way
than a locomotive can run on indefi
nitely without getting fresh supplies of
fuel.
In this new view, it appears that eaoh
brain cell is a sort of storage battery,
which can perform a certain amount
of work and then must be recharged.
This likeness to a battery is further
emphasized by the fact that the na
ture of the brain cell's work consists,
like that of any other battery, of the
sending out of charges of energy along
fibers that may be likened to wires.
Brain cells, when examined under
the microscope, are found not to be
simple globular bodies, like many other
kinds of cells. On the contrary, they
are irregular in shape, and when prop
erly stained, little wire-like fibers can
be seen jutting out from them in var
ious directions. It is along these fibers
that the messages come to the cell,
and other messages are sent out, much
as messages go and come from a tele
phone central office.
This likening of the brain to a tele
phone central office is a comparison
that may be carried to a remarkable
length. Indeed, no other comparison

horsemen does not make a night raid

notion of the method of brain action.
But until recently there was one phase
of the matter that could not be ex
plained.
How is it that the various messages
that are surging through the brain are
directed to proper channels, among
these multitudinous wires? When you
call up the central office, you give a
certain number, and the "hello girl"
connects your particular wire with that
number. When you are through talk
ing the girl breaks the circuit, and
you can no longer communicate along
that line. But is there anything simi
lar to this making and breaking of cir
cuits possible in the brain?
Astonishing as it may seem, the an
swer is, yes. There is precisely such
a series of changes in the circuits of
the brain cells as is effected by the
"hello girl" with the telephone wires.
The manner of it is this. Recent stud
ies of the brain cell, particularly those
made by the Spanish physiologist, Ra
mon Cajal, have shown that many of
the wires which lead out from a cell do
not go on uninterruptedly to a ter
mination in some other distant cell, as
they were formerly supposed to do, but
instead terminate in "blind ends." That
is to say, they point out toward other
cells, but do not reach them. Such a
fiber clearly cannot convey any mes
sage, because, like a telephone wire
that has been cut, it does not lead any
where.
But under certain conditions of stim
ulation a very extraordinary thing hap
pens. The "blind" fiber, under stim
ulus from its central cell, lengthens out
until it touches a fiber of a neighboring
cell, and, presto! with such contact a
circuit is completed and a message
flashes between the cells.
Manifestly, such coming together of
the "blind" fibers is precisely compar
able to the "hello girl's" connecting of
your telephone with another. And as
in the case of the telephones, so in the
case of the cells, when the communica
tion is completed the connection is
broken, the fibers retract and cease to
touch one another, and no further mes
sages can be sent.
Sometimes the telephone girl does
not understand your order, or , reports
that the number you want is "engaged"
and you cannot send your message.
Similarly, in the brain, it seems some
times as if certain circuits one wishes
to use-are engaged in other channels,
for how often does one "puzzle his
brains" to recall a fact or a name
which he feels that he knows perfectly,
but which will not come at command?
And then how, perhaps hours after
afterward, the elusive name will flash
before him as if the telephone girl of
his brain cell had at -last succeeded in
getting the right connfcÂ«rtlon?
When one reflects that each of these
wonderful brain cells is microscopic in
size, requiring, indeed, a high power
of the micro-scope to make it visible.

Reading of the disaster to the Maine

have passed since we, British soldiers,

of torpedoes.
Yet no international complications
ensued, and I doubt If the Government

â %ja be very much in the. way of navi
gation; also she was in a very dilapi
dated condition â nothing more than a
â  â ^derelict.
. : A message from the ocean had come to

with barnacles, swept by the heavy sea,

the coast of New South Wales, close to

Th^.re, strangely enough, though a
hopeless derelict, she anchored herself.
This sounds impossible, but any sailor
win understand how it happened. The
vessel with her cargo of kerosene had
been burnt at sea. Then she capsized,
but. the quantity of oil remaining in
her bottom had sufficed to keep her

AUTO-MOBILE TORPEDO READY FOR ACTION.
The automobile torpedo is a weapon
that is shot from a tube, generally
called a torpedo gun, and takes up its
line of progress by machinery con
tained in its body. There are many
forms ot these, like the Howell and the
Whitehead, for example, and some ex
traordinary results have been obtained
with both.
The Whitehead is discharged from
the tube by steam or powder, and just
as it leaves the muzzle a lock auto
matically opened releases the com
pressed air carried in a flask and sets
in motion the machinery. Three things
must.be done by it. It must go through
the. water at a high speed, preserving
Its linear direction; it must float at a
constant depth, and on striking it must
explode. The ingenuity and simplicity
of the mechanism which effects these
three things are really marvelous.
The Howell torpedo is based upon the
Well-known principle of the gyroscope.
Its gpegd and surety of direction -ere
usual ort board ship, was made fast. So
she drifted a.long, sweeping the depths
of the ocean with her pendent anchors,
and of course, as soon as she got into
shallow water, they held fast.
We discovered afterwards, from the
marks on the cases of kerosene, that
the .vessel was the John T. Berry, a
large American tvooden ship bound
from New York to China with a caigo
I of. kerosene, in cases. This was after
we had finished the wreck; at present
phe was right in the road of the traffic
along the Australian coast, a serious
menace to shipping. As the wreck
seemed: to be of considerable value, if
only . for the copper in her hull, a
wreekinjg company started operations,
and msde several futile attempts to
tow her into port. But she was moored
teo securely for all the tugs in Austra
lia^ iSdthing' would shift her. During
thf> operations a valuable steamer was
thrown by the heavy sea against the
wreck, and went speedily to the bot
tom- The incident disvouraged the
wreckers, and they retired from the
field.
The colonel commanding the N. S.

an occasion when the explosion of
in any number was fully justifi
able, and the Government, recognizing
the necessity for getting the wreck out
of the way of traffic, agreed with him.
Thus it happened that, one dark,
rainy night, we sailed from Sydney in
a little Government steamer, generally
used for lighthouse inspection, pleasure
s. and so forth. She was not
in any sense a man-of-war, and, there
ad no magazine. So we dumped

but wÂ° hail gales and heavy seas dur
ing the whole of .our operations. Our
little steamer was like a cork in these
stormy waters, but she was a stanch
sea boat, and except for the fact that
the soldiers, being landsmen, got "very
sick, nothing disturbed the harmony of
our voyage.
We found the wreck anchored about
four miles off the coast, but the diffi
culty was to get at her. Having in
mind the fate of the first wrecking
steamer, we dared not approach too
closely. Nothing but a portion of her
bilges and the straight line of her keel
showed above water; there was no pro
jection to which we could make a line
fast, and 'it was impossible for a man
to maintain his footing on the slippery
sea-washed bottom.
There was only one way to solve the
problem, and that was to sweep a line
under the wreck, and slide a torpedo
down it until it reached a point be
neath the capsized hull. So we filled
one of our iron drums, in shape some
thing like a floating buoy, with 300
pounds of gun cotton, a tremendous
charge, and started in to work. We ran
a strong hawser out with a boat, and,
keeping our position with difficulty,
swept it down across the bows of the
wreck. There it caught an the anchor
chains; we could get it no further aft.
It would have been better could we
have got a torpedo right under the cen
ter of the hull, but as this seemed im
possible we decided to fire the mine
under the bows.
At last, after endless delays, we had
everything In position, the mine sus
pended from the hawser and connected
by an electric wire with the ship. We
used a portable battery, in which you
turn a handle to generate the current,
and I can remember my anxiety as
I watched the officer whirl the little
handle around. We were only about one
hundred yards away from the torpedo,
and who knew what might happen
within a second. Were we to be
swamped by the sea raised by the mine
or sunk by falling timbers cast high
Into the air by the terrific explosion?
However, nothing very serious hap
pened. There was a muffled roar as
the current flew through the wire, a
column of water shot high in the air,
our little steamer rocked violently in
the swell, and it was all over. Th*- 1
provoking part of it was that there lay
the wreck, seemingh* quite undis
turbed by the occurrence, though we
found out afterward that we had loos

such velocity and in such a constant
plane that high speed and great
strightnoss of trajectory are secured.
There are many other forms, but these
two are employed in our service, and
the Whitehead is used by nearly all the
navies of the world.
The term "submarine mine" is ap
plied to defensive mines or to those
which would be used to obstruct the
channels of a river or estuary, or the
approaches to a fortified or unprotect
ed seaport. Colonel Samuel Colt, the
inventor of the American revolver, first
demonstrated the practicability erf
blowing up vessels by submarine mines
fired by electricity. In 1842 he blew up
the old gunboat Boxer, and in 1843 he
destroyed a brig in the Potomac River
while the vessel was under way, sail
ing at the rate of five miles an hour.
Many forms of mines were used here
and abroad, and they were successful

Every system of coast defense con

The next time we managed to get
the mine nearly under the center of
the ship, and the explosion showed
more tangible results. We blew a hole
right through the bottom of the hulk,

pieces of the heavy floor timbers flew

kerosene cases were scattered all over
the surrounding sea. The water began
to grow smoother, a thin oily film

the shock. Evidently we had opened
a way for the kerosene and air impris

What was more, we found the wreck
drifting freely about, her anchor gear
having parted.
By the time we had finished all this
work it was getting late in the evening
and it occurred to us that if we wished
to save anything of the wreck we had
better try towing her to the Bhore
and beach her at a convenient spot

proposition was not bo easy to exe

TORPEDO
ACCIDENTS.
THE torpedo Is a tremendously
offensive weapon, capable of
doing more damage in a minute
than a battery of heavy guns
could effect in a week. But the
trouble is that, like the monster which
FrankensteinÂ«so rashly created. It does
not discriminate between friend and
foe; with beautiful impartiality, it is
equally ready to destroy either.
This is more particularly the case
with the automobile torpedo, of which
the Whitehead is the best-known type,
intended for use by one vessel against
cerns itself with their distribution and
use, and every well-known harbor of
the world is at this day so mapped out
that the planting of these mines may
be done on a plan which promises the
greatest utility. Some of these are
constant depth mines â that is, such as
will float always at a certain depth be
low the surface, no matter what may
be the state of the tide; some are fitted
to explode on contact, and most are so
arranged that they may be exploded at
will by observers stationed at points of
refuge, in bomb proof and looko-ut sta
tions ashore.
It is by such a system as this that
San Francisco is guarded. Of course,
the Federal authorities carefully pre
serve the plan of the mines protecting
the entrance of the Golden Gate, and
only to a very few in the highest au
thority is the secret kne-wn.
Is the harbor of Havana so guarded
and so protected, and could the Maine

these submerged volcanoes, operated so
easily by the simple twist of a hostile
hand ashore?
another. This delicate and expensive
piece of mechanism is almost human
in its contrariness. Each torpedo con
tains In itself a complete compressed
air engine, which drives it along by a
screw exactly in the same way as a
steamer is propelled. And the theory,
which works out very prettily on paper,
HOW THE TORPEDOES AND SUBMARINE MINES COULD BE WORKED FROM FORT POINT
AGAINST A SHIP ENTERING THE GOLDEN GATE.
is that the torpedo, when fired from the
tube at a certain anglo, its engines ad
justed to run at a certain speed, and
its flotation so arranged that it will
keep at a fixed depth bypath the sur
face, will hit the enemy's vessel at
which it is aimed.
Any naval officer knows, however,
though perhaps he may not rare to ad
mit it, that the chance of the White
head hitting the object it is aimed at
is very remote. When two vesels are
moving in opposite directions at high
rates of speed It is difficult enough to
make good practice, evt-n with the
most accurate of guns. The combined
Bpeed of the two ships would be some
where in the neighborhood of forty
miles an hour, and it would be almost
impossible to so adjust a Whitehead
as to hit under these conditions. If
both vessels were motionless it would
be easy enough, but this is unlikely to
happen in real warfare.
It is no wonder that, under such cir
cumstances, naval experts are begin
ning to look askance at the torpedo's
presence on battle-ships. They ques
tion whether the weapon is likely to
prove worthy of the room it occupies
and the danger it involves. For some
time the use of above-water torpedo
tubes has been abandoned because of
the risk of explosion In action. Even
with all the torpedoes and their appur
tenances under water, the possibility of
a stray shell striking one of the fully
charged heads is by no means remote
Another thing is that the erratic
Whitehead cannot always be depended
upon to run straight; sometimes it
takes a fancy to dive to the bottom, at
other times it comes to the surface.
It has even been known to turn com
pletely around and make a bee line
back for the vessel from which it was
fired. These things, of course, have
only happened in practice, but there is
no reason why they might not be re
peated in real war.
Probably, therefore, the automobile
torpedo will soon be relegated to its
proper place on small torpedo vessels"
and the big ships will be freed from
such a dangerous Incumbrance. But
the fixed torpedo, or submarine mine,
as it sometimes called, comes under a
different category. Its value for har
bor defense is so great that its use is
more likely to be developed than dis
continued. It is quite possible, by care
ful surveying, to so plant the entrance
to a harbor with torpedoes that no hos
tile vessel can enter without bringing
about her own destruction.
Possibly this has been done in San
Francisco Fay, but of course the mili
tary authorities are secret about the
matter, and neither the arrangement

of the mine fields nor the position of
the observing station is known to the
general public. But I was privileged
once to investigate the torpedo defense
of an equally important harbor, that
of Port Jackson, in New South Wales.
The conditions of the two harbors are
somewhat similar; in each there is a
narrow, sharply denned entrance,
widening out into a broad bay. And on
the shores of each haven there is a
large city to be defended.
The navigable entrance to Port Jack
son is comparatively narrow, and, be
sides, is commanded on each side by
high hills, which bristle with those
terrible hydro- pneumatic guns. Each
of these weapons is concealed in a
shell-proof pit. from which it only rises
to fire, returning again automatically
to shelter. But on a height within the
harbor, commanding a close view of
the entrance, there is a still more im-
portant means of defense. Carefully
concealed amid the green bushes which
clothe the hill is a little casemate, and
here, looking out from a narrow open
ing, the officer in charge can observe
the approach of every vessel desiring to
enter the harbor.
The whole thing is wonderfully sim
ple. The officer sits before a chart of
the harbor, traced on ground glass, so
that at night it may be illumined by a
lamp from underneath. At his e--e is
a range-finder, with which he follows
the movement of an incoming vessel.
An automatic arrangement traces the
course of the vessel on the chart below.
She passes over a succession of tiny
squares, each representing so much of
the harbor. And within each of these
squares is a heavily charged submarine
mine. All that the officer has to do
when the enemy's ship arrives at a
proper point is to press a button, the
torpedo explodes .and the incident is
ended. In the same way he can, by
telephone, direct the heavy guns in the
battery below to be pointed on any
given spot. Then all he has to do is to
wait till the enemy's ship arrives on
this particular square on the diagram,
HOW THE REBEL SHIP AQUEDABAN WAS DESTROYED BY A TORPEDO.
DURING the Brazilian Insurrec
tion of 1893-94 President Peixoto
sent four torpedo boats to de
stroy the rebel ship Aquidaban,
which was lying at anchor under
the lee of Santa Cruz. The night of
April 15, 1594, was exceedingly dark,
and the Government torpedo boats en
tered the harbor without accident.
Spreading out, fan-like, the vessels felt
their way about seeking the Aquida
ban, Admiral Mello's flagship. The
boat Sampaio was the first to encoun
ter the enemy. A sharp fire was opened
on the torpedo boat, revealing the Aqui
daban. At once the torpedo boat went
full speed toward the enemy, circling
to bring its bow tube to bear. The
captain of the Sampaio himself pulled
the lanyard. The torpedo struck the
Aquidaban very far forward. The ex
plosion was exceedingly violent, but did
not change the ship's trim. Neverthe
less, the shock was terrific, and the offi
cer of the watch was thrown from the
bridge into the sea. No one was killed,
as there was no one in the forward
compartments.
Tha ohlo elnwlv sank till she took
and a touch of the button will send half
a dozen heavy shells hurtling toward
the attacking vessel.
This system, of course, is compara
tively safe for the defender, but even
in times of peace accidents may hap
pen through the vagaries of the elec
tric current. I remember one case
where a gallant young officer and half
a dozen volunteers lost their lives be

the autumn maneuvers. The Governor
of the colony was on a visit to the en
campment, and to make a display it
was intended to fire a couple of tor
pedoes. The mines, hanging one on.
each side of a large boat, were taken
out by a crew of some dozen members
of the torpedo corps. One mine was
dropped in the bay and the boat moved,
on a hundred yards or so before ex
ploding it.
On the heights above we stood watch
ing anxiously for the explosion, for the
upheaval of a magnificent column of
water. Beyond was the boat, looking:
quite diminutive. Watching through
my glasses I saw the officer give the
signal, and then, to my horror, the
whole after part of the boat flew high
in the air, fragments of human bodies
fell on the waters all around, and we
knew that a great catastrophe had
happened. Most of the men in the boat
were killed, and a few stunned and
severely injured were picked up.
The awful explosion was brought
about by the simplest of causes. In
connecting the wires with the battery
some one, who paid with his life for his
carelessness, had crossed them, and
the mine hanging by the side of hte
boat had been exploded instead of the
one sunk deep in the waters.
the ground in twenty-two feet of
water. A careful examination dis
closed the fact that the torpedo had
struck close to the bulkhead, which
separated compartments two and
three, about thirty-five feet aft from
the ram. It had blown a hole nineteen
of twenty feet long and 6 feet 9 inches
broad, and at either end the steel skin
of the ship had been torn. The tear
extended aft six feet longitudinally
past the bulkhead dividing the third
and fourth compartments. The water
tight doors in the bulkhead had been
lne.sened by the shock, so that the
fourth compartment, which was a very
large one, had filled, as well as the first
three. Inside everything was smashed
beyond recognition. The armored
deck had been driven out a little just
over the place where the explosion oc
curred, and numerous rivets in the
skin had been loosened. In all it was
calculated that she had taken on board
500 tons of water. On the starboard
side forward, forty feet from the ram,
was another hole, but smaller than
that to the port, as it was only three
feet in diameter. This may have been
caused by the head ot the torpedo
being driven right through the ship by
tha force of the explosion.

SHOULD THE STATE TAKE A HAND AND RESTRICT MARRIAGES ?
THE proposed Ohio law whereby
candidates for matrimony must
successfully pass a physical ex
amination before a medical
board is exciting all sorts of dis
cussion throughout the country. Some
people think it is simply another step
.indicating that the law is getting
deeper into the home and the individual
life of the people. They say, "What
next?"
In other quarters it has aroused
storms of violent opposition, protest
and derision. But through it all the
matter is being seriously and carefully
discussed by the Ohio legislators.

To start with, you cannot compel men and women
to submit to such a test. If you could, men and
women would not submit to the ban put upon them.
The law would be futile.
The result would discourage marital relations and
substitute illicit. Widespread illegitimacy would
take the place of the occasional defective or delin
quent mentally, morally, physically. To fix the re
sponsibility for children and thus provide for the r
rearing is more important than to exclude the possi
bility of congenital defects.
It Is better for the State to maintain hospitals and
asylums on account of mistaken marriages than to
become a universal father and mother.
Max Nordeau thinks otherwise. He is wrong. In
Europe every restriction on free marriage has re
sulted in failure, although there, under the paternal
system, such laws are easier to enforce. Legislation
of this kind is repugnant to American ideas. The
fittest will survive. Nature will eliminate the de
fectives. And from the point of view of the politician
I think nature should work more expeditiously and
save society from maintaining too many asylums for
mental, moral and physical delinquents.

HARVESTING ICE
on the
TRUCKEE RIVER
THE Truckee River furnishes San
Francisco with most of its ice.
The ice is not taken from the
large lakesâ Lake Tahoe and
Lake Dormerâ for the former
does not freeze at all. and the
latter freezes to a depth inadequate to
yield merchantable ice. The ice lakes
or ponds are mostly made by damming
the river, and the average-sized pond
covers 160 acres and is from four to six
teen feet in depth. There are no less
than ten of these ponds on the course
of the river, and two are in the arms
of canyons which embrace feeders of
the river.
The twelve ponds are controlled by
eight companies or firms, most of them
having their head offices In San Fran
cisco.
There would seem to be some kind of
agreement existing among them as to
the market price of ice, as there is one
concern in the river which has its
plant leased to a San Francisco Ice
company, who pay it $12,000 per year
merely to hold its plant out of
use, or $30,000 per year if it
wishes to fill its storage-house with
ice, and hold the same, subject to the
orders of the company. It is also stated
that where the plant people have
availed themselves of this offer, but
lew carloads of ice have been taken
from their house during the summer
Reason, and they have had, In winter,
to replace only this small quantity to
keep their storage house filled.
The thermometer goes down to 15 de
grees below zero along this river, and
â ice cutting begins early in December.
It starts early, just as soon as the wa
ter is frozen to a sufficient thickness.
In order that the ice may be gotten
under cover before snow falls. Snow is
a serious and depressing Incident to an
ice producer. A heavy snowfall, after
freezing has set in, may ruin his en
tire crop. It falls Upon the ice, sinks
the Ice sheet by reason of its weight,
below the water; the water rises to
the level of the surface of the snow,
and freezing again ensues. This proc
ess produces merchantably worthless
Ice. The Ice instead of being clear,
transparent, bright, is white, opaque
and dull. It is good enough for refrig
erator purposes, but is undesirable for
other kinds of consumption, and when
the pond gets in this condition the ice
Is not cut at all.
When snow falls, therefore, the Ice
producer hurries his crew forthwith to
clean it off, and many scrapers are
brought into requisition. The con
gealed precipitation is gotten off and
piled around the banks of the lake.
This is an expensive process, for It
costs about $100 an inch of depth to !
clear the snow from a pond of 160 acres, j
If the snow is 5 inches, therefore, the ]
cost Is $500, and if several of these falls j
occur before the ice is frozen deep [
enough to cut, the profits of the enter
prise for that season become very ma- ;
terially reduced.
Merchantable Ice must not be less '
than 8 inches nor more than 14 inches j
thick. It is then cut Into blocks 22x30 ,
inches in size, and for that sized block j
each inch of ice weighs twenty pounds. !
A block 12 inches thick, therefore, I
weigfcs Â£40 pounds. These blocks are j
cut from the ice sheet by a horse draw
ing over it a saw guided by a man, a?
a plow is guided, which saw cuts a

four feet of the bottom of the stratum.
This leaves the ice layer sufficiently j
prevention and that as a legislator he
is going to do everything in his power
to check it. His first step is to prevent
alliances that will result in inferior
progeny, and he holds that his pro
posed bill will bring about that much
desired object.
Men and women alike must submit
to this examination, and it is to be as
thorough as though the candidate was
applying for a life insurance or a place
In the regular army. No provision has
as yet been made for women doctors
on the examining boards, but the pro
moters of the bill say that is a detail
that will come later. At present they
are uniting their efforts to meet the
radical opposition to the bill.
But the Ohio unmarried people pro
ferred to above could be enforced. And where the re
strictions upon marriage are too rigid the result is
increased immorality and a larger number of ille
gitimate births, as witness France and other Euro
pean countries, where divorce is practically dis
allowed.
On the other hand, I believe that divorce laws far
less lax than oursâ laws permitting divorce for, say,
two or three causes onlyâ would tend to diminish
the number of ill assorted marriages and those in
imicable to the well being of society.

How to prevent the mar
riage of persons who ought
not to marry is a diffi
cult problem, and It Is un
likely that any legislation will solve it.
REV. W. H. MORELAND.
Moral suasion is the only force we can apply now
to dissuade the partners of an ill-advised union, and
that generally fails. An act of Congress will not
help the case, but will lead to deceit, fraud, immorali
ties and other evils.
It might be practicable to forbid the issuing of a
marriage license to a confirmed drunkard or to a
hopeless consumptive, and then the sworn affidavits
of reputable citizens would be necessary. But prog
ress along this line will be slow, and the surer prog
ress lies in the direction of deepening in parents the
conscientious sense of guardianship over their chil
dren and in children loving deference to the advice of
their parents.
In a true home, wherein children are wisely taught
and reared, the boys and girls, when they arrive at
years of choice, will be likely to select a fit partner,
who will be suitable on the ground of health, habits
and character.
The church can do more for the race along this line
than the state.
This Is a problem In so
ciology involving more
j thought and study than
I can readily be given to it
by the medical practitioner. The plan is so radical
that it will certainly meet with general and violent
opposition as soon as its purpose is made known. At
the present time, and under the existing conditions of
modern civilization, the public is not educated up to
the standard which would place marriage on a civil
service basis, and would compel those who contem
plate entering into a matrimonial contract to produce
official certificates as vouchers of their physical and
mental fitness to take such a step. The first effects of
the enactment of such a law would be almost revolu
tionary. I do not believe that an order of the Gov
ernment compelling the slaughter of all first-born
children would cause greater consternation than
would this.

them along an Incline to the top of
the long storage house. Midway the
elevator is a planer and steel brush
which shaves and cleans off the sur
face of the Ice as it passes, freeing it
of all refuse which may be carried upon
the top of it. This storage house is
quite an establishment. It is gener
ally about 300 feet long, 100 feet wide
and 30 feet high; such a house will
hold 20,000 tons of ice. There are
eight of these houses along the line
of the Truckee River, some not quite
so large, perhaps, and I estimate that
the entire Ice crop with which they
are stored is about 150,000 tons.
The elevator continues to drag the
blocks of ice, and presently they are
carried along a level platform and past
doorways, opposite which men stand
with iron prongs; as the blocks pass
they are thrust off the platform into
the door, when quickly they disappear

population all elements which might contribute to an
unhealthy, vicious or depraved progeny could only be
commended, and that the enforcement of such meth
ods would in due course of time so modify and im
prove the line of succession that a perfect race of
men and women would result.
Theoretically, this would happen: but it must be
taken into consideration that a law so far-reaching
in its effects would preclude so many that a compara
tively small minority would receive official sanction
to enter into the marriage state.
What steps would then be taken by the Govern
ment to compensate those who might be declared
matrimonially ineligible? What would be done in the
way of restricting and controlling those to whom the
privilege of creating a domestic establishment had
been denied?
These are questions for the sociologist and the po
litical economist to answer to the satisfaction of the
great bulk of the people before such a law can be en
acted.
In my opinion It will take centuries of time to
reconcile the human race to the imposition of such
a restriction, and if by some accident this bill should
become a law the inevitable result will be a social
upheaval which will eventuate in the increase of
pauperism, crime and illegitimacy.
I am against the proposed law.
Man Is a chemical com-
pound, with a mentality
superadded. It is through
the perversion of the lat
ter factor that most of his evils arise, and from this
truly physiological and scientific standpoint, the idea
suggested by Senator Parker and embodied in his
bill is absolutely correct.
Man is frequently termed the superior animal, but
a close intimacy with his frailties fails at all times to
indorse this conclusion.
Standing in the relationship which the medical pro
fession does to mankind no false sentiment, no mis
taken leniency, must dictate, guide or influence in
any wise the physician's position as un instructor to
his lay brethren. * The reproduction of species has a
divine foundation for its existence, but with the great
mass of humanity the only portion of. the divine law
recognized is "Be fruitful and multiply," which com

If man's superiority does not entitle him to a per
fect offspring, both as an individual and a species,
then he had better sink his superiority and become
classified with the so-called lower creation, for there

hard, and, though cold, one may keep

The ice harvesting season does not
last over eight weeks; but during this
time it gives employment to 500 men.
The ice plants do not all cut at one
time, for the reason that the ponds do
not freeze uniformly. Some with the
same degree of cold will freeze quick
er and deeper than others, owing to- va
riations in the exposure of their re<
spective positions and as to whether the
ponds are fed by the warmer waters
of the larger lakes; men, therefore,
move from place to place as work at
one place is finished and at another it
begins. Some plants cut two and even
three crops a season, but most of them
harvest but once, having storage ca
pacity for only one cut.

The stockraiser, in his reproduction of the animals
whose characteristics he has fully studied, takes
means and uses precautions to prevent the accentu
ation of any degeneracy which may De recognized,
his object being to produce equal or superior off

products.
When by means of legislation, if possible, but cer
tainly by some method, the reproduction of the ani
mal man, who is supposed to be made after the
image of his Creator, when such metho<*s are applied
to the perpetuation of his offspring, then and not till
then can we hope to successfully stamp out the long
train of degeneration, popularly termed "disease,"
which has been accepted, so universal is its presence,
as man's birthright, not man's misfortune; for we
must recognize beyond question that mas:, as a physi
cal success, is in no wise coequal with his predeces
sors, either in stamina or in the period or longevity.
Marriage means reproduction and reproduction is
simply the resultant of the union of physical forces
forces which must of necessity imprint upon that re
sultant the essentials which enable their union to
vitalize their offspring. The object of this union
should be the production of animal perfection. If
their parents are not as perfect as natures laws de
mand, then the union should certainly be intercept
ed,-for we aim not at civilization's apparent wants
and not at society's demands, but at the most perfect
type of human development.
This is the goal to which the best efforts of science
and humanitarianism should press, for ihe.i
we can substitute this perfect product for the
puny offspring of pseudo-sentimentality, which has
only the outer semblance, the perfect type to recom^
mend it and which we denominate "man," more from
social courtesy and popular usage than from any
physical claim these degenerates may have to the
title.
In conclusion, I am pleased that legislation, through
the Ohio Senator, is giving its attention to a line of
action which has for its object the restoration of
mankind to his architype, which, as the consumma
tion of creation, places him only a little lower than
the angels.
Marriage should be the unification of two primarily
physically perfect prototypes of man and woman.

two fictitious cases purporting to
be genuine decisions from an Arizona
court.
In the prospectus which preceded the
cases, attention was called to the simi
larity of style and substance between
"the Arizona reports and those of the
court of last appeal in Pennsylvania.
The writer of these fictitious cases so
well concealed his identity that even to
this day his name has not been made
public. Some of the Justices of the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court took of
fense at what they termed an insult.
One in particular, Justice George
Sharswood, became exceedingly irate
over the insinuation and was about to
institute proceedings to discover the
identity of the culprit who dared draw
likenesses between the Arizona Judic
iary and Supreme Court of Pennsyl
vania and then punish him for con
tempt of court. At that time it was
thought that the decisions were bona
fide products of the Arizona judicial
mind. Justice Sharswood was prevent
ed from taking action, however, by sev
eral of his brethren who saw the hu
mor in the burlesque phase of the cases.
The first case is written in a puTely
philosophical style, with a terminology
which savors of Kant and Liebnltz. It
is as follows:
Silas Tomkins vs. The Commonwealth.
1. A defendant may be convicted of
murder by poisoning on an indictment
which charges a murder by a clasped
knife.
2. It Is no objection to a conviction
that it nowhere appears on the record
that the Judge before whom the case was
tried was duly commissioned by the Gov-
ernor.
3. It is not an error to asK a prisoner
when called up for sentence: "What he
has to say why judgment should not be
pronounced," etc.
4. The course of the administration of
criminal justice cannot be stopped for 6
cents.
The opinion of the Court was delivered
by Ayle, J.
The defendant below was found guilty
of the gratuitous murder of a mother and
her ten children under circumstances of
useless and offensive barbarity. We were
quite prepared to hear his counsel argu
ing that his conviction was erroneous and
their client innocent. It is always so in
aggravated cases. But with the inno
cence of Tomkins we. as a court of error,
have really nothing to do. Law Is the
hypothenuse of a right angle triangle of
which logic and moral philosophy are the
two other sides. Though it touches them
each at one point, its general direction is
quite distinct.
Mistakes will happen, of course, In our
judicial system, as accidents do on our
railways; but we can do without neither
one nor the other, Each usually carries
its passengers in safety, and when the
wrong man Is now and then hanged or
blown up he must console himself with
the reflection that he is a sacrifice to the
necessities of society.
The second case is true Arizona style
and smells of powder, the knife and the
tomahawk:
With the law of this case alone It Is
our province to deal. We find here the
usual parade of exceptions and points
and assignments of error and a paper
book encrusted with authorities like bar
nacles. Everything that the ingenuity of
i counsel could suggest has been done to
lifuse and complicate the decision of the
c, in the hope, perhaps, that the pris
x, concealed by the dust of argumenta-
B, might escape in a sort of legal dls
se. But the eyes of Justice are too

duce would only result in
lying, perjury and corrup
tion. Besides, this thing of trying to improve the
race by legislation Is a mistake. The physical and
moral conditions that are beyond the reach of legis
lation.
Moreover, the basis of the proposed law is not sci
entific, or at least cannot be brought under the con
sideration and direction of science, for it is well
known that parents apparently delicate people have
sound and vigorous offspring, and on the othe*
hand that physical and intellectual weaklings are
sometimes born of physical and intellectual giants.
Finally, the right to enter the state of marriage is
a personal right, and secured to every man in the
constitution of the race, just as life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness are recognized as primordial
rights in the constitution of the United States.
It is impossible to see how such a law could be
practically carried out without social stigma upon
names and families. It would be an outrageous pro

j ity in pleading. At any rate, it is a mat
i ter in which the commonwealth alone is
! interested, to the extent of the value of
; the knife as a deodand. We cannot stop
I the administration of justice for 6 cents.
Another objection urged to this convic
j tion is that it nowhere appears that the
judge who tried the case was duly com
: missioned by the Governor. Of some
things the court is supposed to be in pro
found ignorance until instructed by coun
sel; but this is not one of them. Whether
â¢ or not we find time to read the elec
j tion returns, we are judicially bound to
! recognize the existence of our brethren of
i the inferior court.
The third error is somewhat more de-
I serving of consideration. The prisoner, as
appears by the record, was asked when
called up for sentence. "What he had to
say why judgment should not be pro
nounced," etc., instead of "Whether he
had anything to say," etc. The forms of
administration are doubtless the life of
the law. Except through them we have
no means of ascertaining the law itself.
A judge who should substitute his own
theories for received doctrines* would be
guilty of the grossest injustice to suitors
and the community. But we are unable
to discover in the present case any very
important variation from established us
age. It is true that the form used here is
rather abrupt and contains an Implied
sarcasm. Still the meaning was substan
tially conveyed and the ends of justice
sufficiently served.
In the case of Sargeant TB. Coffin, 12
Mass. 315, it was properly decided that an
' erection in a navigable river was a nui
sance; and in Smith vs. Mildmalse Adm.,
31 Ala. 410. it was held that notice to the
indorser of a note of its dishonor might
be waived. I need not refer to the rule In
Shelley's case, nor to the well-known
Woodworth Patent case of Wilson vs.
Barnum, 8 How. (U. S.). 253. These and
other decisions, which It would be mere
pedantry to cite, show that the. plaintiff in
error has no cause to complain of the
charge on the court.
The other errors are merely supernu
meraries, joined to the principal charac
ters in order to give them an air of ficti
tious importance on the stage. We shall
do the prisoner no wrong by disregarding
thorn. A criminal at his trial plays at
pitch and toss with the law for his life,
and, if he loses, he must pay the stakes.
It is too late to contest here the minor
points of the game which ought to have
been settled as it went on.
Judgment affirmed.
She Got the Best Eggs.
The other day a woman went into a
grocer's and said:
"I want three dozen hens' eggs. They
must all be eggs laid by black hens."
The grocer said: "Madam, lam will
ing to accommodate you, but you have
got the best of me this time. I don't
know how to tell the eggs of a black
hen from those of a speckled or a white
one."
She said: "I can tell the difference
mighty quick."
"If that is so, madam, will youkindly
pick out the eggs for yourself?"
She did so, and when the three dozen
were counted into her basket the grocer
looked at them and said, suggestively:
"Well, madam, it seems as though
the black hens laid all the big eggs."
"Yes," she said, "that's the way you
tell them."

To prove this statement before male
ing it I bore about with me for a sea
son during the past week a box of
curious appearance, which diverted the
lighter minds of .the community from
the study of the newspaper bulletins
to momentary speculation as to its use,
and my motive in loading myself down
with It and guarding it as the apple of
my eye. One side of the box was com
posed of a thin sheet of tightly
stretched white paper, which the light-
est touch would puncture, and this
paper and the circular hole before men
tioned transformed the chocolate box
into a. crude but thoroughly practical
and reliable vibration register.
"Talking is not my specialty," said
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department,
with a touch of grim humor as he ap
proached the queer little box.
I had scattered a mixed powder com

ored lycopodium on the paper top of
the apparatus, and then the Chief,
whose ringing voice means so much to
us when a conflagration threatens our
city, spoke the following words into
the circular aperture:
"What San Francisco needs at the
present time is a well-paid Fire De
partment and a week's steady rain."
While he spoke the powder behaved
in the most singular fashion, shivering
and jumping about as if bewitched,
and when he ceased it had resolved
itself into a series of black and cream
lines and waves and dots, which is an
excellent representation of an Egyp
tion scarabaeus.
Next I sought Mrs. Louise Hum
phrey-Smith, the well-known and
much-admired dramatic reader. Would
she speak a few words Into this mys
terious box? The whys and the where
fores having been explained, the lady
consented, and a very delicately out
lined picture of a leaf approaching in
form to the maple was the result of
this patriotic sentiment, spoken by a
feminine voice which is under perfect
control. "Should present events lead
to a war with Spain, we will all hasten
to uphold the honor of our country."
It was noticeable that in this case
the light and dark powders spread over
the paper with great evenness, the
light, however, coming to the top over
almost the entire surface.
Such was decidedly not the result
when Rabbi Voorsanger's sonorous
tones seemingly vivified the tiny par
ticles of mineral and vegetable matter.
There is something about the rabbi's
voice â the ideal pulpit voice â which
seems trumpetlike; it is so strong and
clear and far-reaching, and it sent that
powder all of a tremble, bringing the
heavy emery to the top and collecting
most of it at the end of the paper next
the opening through which he spoke.
"The explosion of the Maine," said
he, "is a calamity which the people of
this country greatly deplore."
I looked at the lines which his words
had made.
"A bit of algae fastened to a rock," I
declared.
"It looks more like a submarine ex
plosion," declared the rabbi.

I wish that together with the picture

cantatrice herself, with her loosened
blonde hair, her perfect pr6file, and the
smile with which she made us welcome.
She would sing "O, Promise Me" into
my vibrator register? Certainly she
would. And so she sang that world
wide favorite, and as her rich, full tones
poured into the opening provided, the
powder was agitated into a thousand
different forms, which consolidated
themselves at the close mto the sim

mounting that astonishing getup and

so was the voice in which he sang that
ever-popular "Dreaming, Dreaming,

Whether Mr. Barnabee be posessed

known to me, but certain it is that the
song made a perfect representation of
a greyhound's head for our edification,

CHINESE STUDENTS GO INSANE
DURING A RIGID EXAMINATION.
Nearly 14,000 Competitors Were
Locked Up in Little Cells
for Three Weeks-
SIX men were carried out dead and
two others went raving mad at Can
ton, China, recently, as the result of
their struggles at the examination
to secure the honor of Xii Yin,
which is equivalent to the degree
of master of arts in an American univer
sity.
There were 13,600 competitors, all sin
tsais, or bachelors of art. Only eighty
could hope to secure preferment. The
number of those who have died or gone
mad during the ordeal of examination is
not large, comparatively. One year thirty
six died and six became crazy. The ex
amination Is triennial. It lasts three
weeks.
Li Hung Chang, of peacock feather and
yellow jacket honors, began his career of
fame as a student at one of these ex
aminations. Success in them means the
opening of a brilliant career to the Chi
nese student, no matter how poor he is.
Rev. F. J. Masters, who formerly re
sided in China, describes some peculiari
ties of the triennial contest for scholas
tic honors. The contestants are locked
up in narrow cells. Men drop dead in
such cells every third year, in all the
provincial capitals of the empire. Hun
dreds of thousands of scholars are con
tent to dig and grind for long years, to
endure great privations, to travel long
distances at their own expense, to try and
fall and to try again, because this is the
only road to intellectual eminence, official
rank and national renown. This competi
tive system came into vogue in China
nineteen centuries ago.
There are primary schools in every Chi
nese village, which are supported by the
parents of the children. They are ex
clusively for boys. The schoolroom is a
spare hall in the village ancestral tem
ple or a room in a private house, at one
end of which is the shrine of Confucius,
before which the pupils must bow three
times. Among the tasks imposed upon
the pupils is acquiring knowledge of the
40,000 characters found in Khang Hi's dic
tionary, no two of whicn are formed
alike. The pupil begins work at R a. m.,
takes a recess at 10 for breakfast, and
then studies without intermission until
4 p. m. He has to study "the thousand
character classic" and the classic on
Filial Piety. I'ntil he is 9 or 10 years
old he is taught nothing and receives
nothing but strokes.
Later he ' learns the meaning of the
strokes, their root and combination and,
little by little, he is able to take in the
profundities of Chinese moral philosophy
and to try his hand at prose composition

thetical couplets.

or the slightest clerical error â throw the
man out, whatever may be the literary
merits of the composition. "I remember
once," said Mr. Masters, "seeing the
names of seventy-one slovens posted up
in Canton, with the disgrace-bearing
mark of the blue pencil attached." The
surviving manuscripts are handed to a
buard of copiers, who make a fair copy of
each paper In red ink. These copies, with
a norn de plume to conceal the writer's
identity, are the only papers that come
before the examiners. They divide the
work between them, making segregations
again and again till about 1000 survive,
and these are submitted to the imperial
commissioners, with whom the final dccl-
sion rests.
Great is the rejoicing of the lucky
scholar who finds his name among the
eighty winners.

of the house: the door is also "practi
cal," and can be opened and shut.
The story runs that the house was de
serted for such a long time that the.
steps. were covered by a gigantic spid
er's web, and the spectator is surprised
to see this' w-eb, which extends from
post to post and to the side walls of
the steps.. â¢ .-..â¢â¢
In the center of this gigantic web
is seen a spider's body with a woman's
head. The steps leading to the door
way of the house are open, and a per
son starts to descend, but stops -on see
ing the spicW, and retreats after tak
ing three or four steps down the stairs.
This adds greatly to the illusion, as it
looks as if it could not be produced by
a mirror. You can see both â¢ above
and below the head, and the steps may
be seen at any angle you choose. The
puzzling part of the trick is the ques
tion of the whereabouts of the lady's
body. â  â 
Reference to the explanatory illus
tration will give the secret â¢ eft the
trick: The mirror, lies at an angle of
45 degrees and. runs from the base of
the posts to the rear of one of the
treads of the lower step. The mirror
extends the full width of the steps. A
semicircular hole is cut out -of the cen
ter of the mirror, at the top edge; this
is to receive' the lady's head.

network of rope; the lady has simply
to affix the body to her head, and the
illusion is complete, as the body of the
lady is concealed behind the glass. The
mirror reflects the lower steps, so that
â¢this reflection really appears to be a
continuation of the steps, and the en
tire flight seems unbroken.
\\ hen the person appears at the door
and descends the steps, he must be
careful not to come below the line
of reflection, as his legs will not be vis
ible. The top edge of the glass is con
cealed by a rope of the web, as it is
directly in front of it, and for safety is
usually cemented to the glass.
In our diagram, No. 1 represents the
steps; 2, the mirror; 3, the web; and 4,
the lady. The trick requires the most
careful preparation and adjustment,
but when this is accomplished, the re
sults are extremely satisfactory.

SAD EXPERIENCE IN A HOTEL
Hotel-keepers have their trials, too.
A lady who lives in a New York hotel
is fond of animal pets and lately bought
a monkey, which she introduced into
her apartments. The monkey, though
pleased with his quarters, was anxious
to look further. He observed olosely
the habits of his owner, and noticed
that when she touched the electric bell
the door was presently opened. 'I will
try that," said he, and when opportu
nity offered he put his thumb on the
electric knob and kept it there. "When
the door opened there were five bell
boys outside. The monkey dived
through the mob of them and flew
down the hall, hotly pursued. Hard
pressed, he noticed an open transom
over a door marked thus: "Bath." He
flew up the door and through the tran
som, leaving the baffled bellboys aghast
in a group outside. Instantly ensued
a splash, followed by a piercing shriek;
as the door flew open a lady, scantily
draped in a bath towel, burst out on
the dumfounded bellboys and fled
screaming down the hall, with the de
lighted monkey perched on her shoul
ders and holding on by her hair. That
same afternoon the monkey's owner re
ceived word from the management of
the hotel that they could not consent
to the monkey's continued stay in the
house. "Rather have a suicide in the
house than that monkey," said the
management.THE GOVERNOR AND ACTING HIGH PRIEST OF ZUNI.

I had been with the Ho.man Opera
Company a good many weeks, at noth
ing a week, and I mean it, when my
first opportunity came. It was in Wil
liamsport. Pa., in 1X63. I was sitting
in the first entrance watching the stage,
as I had watched it night in and night
out, studying every b-it of business,
every change of costume, thinking
which role I should like to play, best,
when the stage manager told me Ben
Holman was ill. The opera was "'Son
nambula," an English version, and
young Holman had been singing Alles
sio, the basso, a good comedy part.
"I can do it," I said, without a mo
ment's hesitation. They all looked at.
me in astonishment, some in amuse
ment.
"O pshaw," said the elder Holman,
"you'd have to be rehearsed and you'd
have to learn the music. We've got to
have somebody now."
"Well, I can do it now,"- I answered..
"I don't want any. rehearsal and I know
the music."
That was true, too. I had learned
every part in the piece sitting there in
the first entrance watching the com
pany. And I got every langh, arid never
missed a word or a note. The next
night Ben Holman was cast for Caspar
In "Der Freischutz," the heaviest basso
part I know of. I sang it right through,
and the next night sang Devilshoof.
Ben heard what was going oh, and he
made an effort and came to the theater
to take his own part, but the exertion
killed him. He died not long afterward.
His illness gave me my opportunity.
I was with the Holrnans for seven
years, and when I wasn't at the theater
I was with them .at their lodgings. I
never left 'om, and kept right on trying
to learn every part in every piece in
their repertoire, studying until toward
morning, instead of skylarking after
the performance was over.
But all the time I realized that I
would never make a musician. I didn't
kppw the notes. I wanted to be an
actor. So I left the Holmans and went
to Crowe's Theater and played there m
legitimate comedy. I didn't get but $20
a week, but I was satisfied. I was.
learning something all the time and I
was sitting up. until 5 o'clock, plenty of
mornings, studying the old English
comedies, putting ice water on my eyes
to keep 'em open and pegging away at
rehearsals next day.
Not much "glamour" about that, eh?
I was taking every chance that came
my way and waiting for more, I was
studying all the comedy parts in the
range of old English comedy with the
hope, and on the chance, that I might
some day have an opportunity to play
them. I remember learning letter per
fect seven parts in a single piece, for
I couldn't tell which one of them I
mlsrht get a chance at, some day. â  â

passes In and out by means of the lad
der route, for outside doors are the ex
ception rather than the rule In Zunl.
As a result of this plan the houses, in
the center of the village are four or
five high, while only on the extreme
outskirts are s.lngle houses found. In
terior decoration or furnishing Is
scant in a Zuni house. Usually they
contain but one room, perhaps twenty
by thirty feet, although in exceptional
cases two and even three rooms- are to
be found. The side walls of the houses
adjoin an.d tiny doors connect one with
another, so that it is possible to go
quite a distance through the village
without going out-of: doors.
They have a- religion, if their odd be
liefs may be- so termed; but it is a re
ligion of fear rather than of love. If
they can but succeed in driving oiit
the various devils that beset them the
â bad. will be averted and the good will
take care of itself. Superstition rules
; them. The word of their priests is held
i. at all times in highest reverence and
â  is their supreme authority. They are
such a prospect? How many weeks
a,re they willing to work at nothing a
week â .with no part? How many years
are they willing to study, on a small
salary, with only expectations?
Why, a short time ago a young man
in my company objected to understudy
ing three or four parts. I reasoned
with him, and at last I got mad, think,
ing of my own experience, and I said
to him:
"My young friend, the last week I
was with the Hooley Comedy Company
I played nine parts in four nights."
That settled it.
When I made up my mind to give iip
comic opera and to devote my life to
comedy, I realized that I was giving up
a good deal of cash in hand for the
sake of possible recompense. I was
looking ahead to a prospect, of excel
lence and deliberately throwing over
an offer to have my name printed in
big letters as first comedian of the
Alice Oates Company with parts tha-t
would divide, honors fairly with her.
What is more, I was giving up $125 a
week for a salary of juat $65 per week,
but little more than half as much.
A good many young men would take
that extra $60 and immediate popular
favor. But I think it paid me not to
do it. I was ambitious; and I am
more ambitious now, to-day, than I
was then. And after I was married
my wife was mere ambitious for me
than I was for myself.
Ambition? I should say so. I fear
deterioration in my own work, In my
company, in my productions, as much
now as ever in my life. Why? Be
cause I am proud of what I have
achieved by work, sheer honest work,
work that has never flagged, and that
will not as long as lam acting. lam
determined people shan't say I "got it
by luck." It was work â and ambition.
"Crane's luck," said Joe Jefferson not
long ago, when somebody spoke of me
in that connection, "Crane's luck! Non
sense; it's Crane's work." And that's
just the reason why. l am not ashamed
to speak of it. I have never to my
knowledge said, "I can play that part
just as well as So and So." But I
have always played every part just as
well; just as hard, as I possibly could
and let the result take care of itself.
And what's more, I am just as afraid
of failure to-day as I ever was in my
life, j.ust as eager to guard against it.
That's all, my young friends. Once
started on the stage, don't sacrifice a
possible future for present cash. Don't
try to star just because you have madÂ«
a hit. Don't think about '.'the gla.
mour of the stage." Don't expect
anybody to make "the opportunity of
your life," ready to your hand. Study,
study,' study and wait your chance. '
Whether you should start or not de
pends largely on how anxious you are
to work. Don't you think so?

STRANGE MESSAGES SENT OVER THE TELEPHONE
C ( S~\ ONSIDERINO the fact that
111 millions of miles of wire
I and half the States of the
country are included in our
telephone system, and we
have something like 250,000 subscribers.
It isn't strange that some peculiar
things happen over the long-distance
lines," said the telephone man, as he
leaned back in his chair after connect
ing Omaha and New York just to show
how easy it is to talk across 1600 miles.
"The other day the papers printed a
story of how a bank president in Min
neapolis presided over a meeting of di
rectors in Lowell, Mass.," he went on.
"That. was correct enough, but It
wasn't such an unusual thing as one
might infer from reading the accounts
of it: It has become quite the regular
thing for a railroad or a bank director
who can't Â«*et to the regular place of
meeting to be connected with the meet
ing place by wire; b* the use of a large
transmitter he is able to hear every
thing that goes on, and to take part in
the proceedings almost as well as
though he were on the spot: I know
too, that the distance 'phone has been
used to close some of the largest com
mercial transactions that have taken
place in the country during the past
five years.
"The use of the long range telephone
for great business affairs seems natural
enough, for the high charges are trivial
compared with the interests involved.
But anybody who hasn't had a chance
to learn from being In the business
would be astonished at some of the
messages that go over the wires and
for which the senders pay good round
sums in the way of tolls. I suppose;
the reason for this is that the telephone*
is still comparatively new to most peo
ple; they look upon it with something
of wonder and they like to experiment
with it to see If It will do all that iÂ£
claimed for It.
"Here, for instance, Is a case that we
in Zuni, went to the village as a mis
sionary about ten years ago. She it
was who first reported the torturing
of the witch, to Captain C. E. Nord
strom, Tenth Cavalry, who (until his
sudden death a few weeks ago), was
Indian agent at Santa Fe. Captain
Nordstrom, upon the representations of
Miss Dessette, recommended that the
Interior department request the War
Department to order four troops of
cavalry to Zuni, post haste, arrest the
four Priests of the Bow, subdue any
uprising that might follow the arrest,
and then remain at Zuni until such
time in the future as would insure the
safety of the white people living there.
Miss Dessette said:
"I did not learn of the torturing of
the old woman until Monday, and she
was tortured first on the preceding
Friday. I took one of the teachers.
Miss Ferrote, with me, and found the
house by direction of a relative of the

poor woman. I knew she would not let
any of theZuniscomein. I found the old
woman, whose name is Ma-u-ri-ta, in
had last night and which is one of a
kind that we get six days in every
week. A Cincinnati man had come on
to New York on business. He had evi
dently Just left his train when he came
to the 'phone and called up his Ohio
house. There evidently wasn't any par
ticular reason for it, except his desire
to talk with his family. One after an
other the mother and five children
came to the 'phone and exchanged a
few sentences with the head of the
house. In such long distance work,
where the charges are high, it is cus
tomary for the operator to notify the
user of the wire at the end of each five
minutes of the time so that there won't
be any confusion about the cost at the
end. In this case the conversation kept
dragging out and the night manager
who had the wire notified the man
every five minutes, each time being met
with the repiy, 'I'll take five minutes
more.' The Cincinnati man was de
termined that every one of his family
should hear his voice, and he didn't
care how much it cost. Last of all the
baby was brought to the transmitter, a
youngster who could just lisp "Hello,
papa,' and then the man settled his bill
for $108 without a murmur, doubtless
feeling well repaid in having listened
to his baby's coo across that distance.
"Of course that's an extreme case in
the size of the charge, but in other re
spects it isn't an unusual thing, espec
ially with westerners. It seems to me
that about one in every ten men, wheth
er they come from Chicago or some lit
tle cress roads town, rush off to the
teleplujne the first thing when they
strike New York, and call up the wife
or sweetheart whom they have left be
hind at home. To the outsider their lit
tle home gossip or sweet nothings
don't seem to amount to much, but I
dare, say it makes life pleasanter for
thqSe who are interested, so nobody
elye can object to it.

a little stuffy room, up two or three
steps from the main floor of the house.
"She was lying in some filthy rags
and was badly frightened when I en
tered, doubtless thinking I was one of
the Indians coming to torture her. I
told her I was her friend and had come
to help her, but she did not believe me
at first. I then compelled some of the
members of her family to return to the
house and care for her after I had
washed her, bandaged her lacerated
arms and back and dressed her injuries
as well as I was able. She told me that
they had come for her on Friday and
taken her to a corral where burros are
kept, lashed her hands behind her back,
and then hanged her so that her feet
just touched the ground. Then they
beat her most unmercifully and in
flicted all sorts of fiendish tortures that
a savage mind can think of, until,
finally, to escape further torture for the
time being at least, poor old Ma-u-ri-ta
confessed that she was the witch. They
will confess to almost anything that is
required of them to be released from
torture.
"The priests charged her with having
caused the death of Wah-woh, who was
a somewhat notable creature, and with
other misdeeds usually attributed to
witches. The Zunis believe that the
witches can cause a plague of grass
hoppers, or other pests, or the .death or
disgrace of any one toward whom they
have a grudge. These Priests of the
Bow cause all the trouble, for they are
the ones who declare that there is a
witch and who seek her out. They in
variably select some poor old person
who is in the way. Any Indian who
has attained wealth enough to own a
wagon need have no fear of ever being
found a witch, as he is too important a
member of the community after that."
Miss Ferrote is also in the employ
of the Interior Department, in the
capacity of field- matron. She visits
all the houses in the village, treats the
sick, consoles the sorrowing, ministers
to the wants of men, women and chil
dren in a perfectly impartial manner
and is called "Mother" by the entire
tribe. Miss Ferrote, according to
Ka-pa-te-wi, or "Mormon," the pres
ent Governor of Zuni, is beloved by
every resident of the village, old and
young.
She said: "I dressed the old woman's
injuries, which were frightfully severe,
and have attended her repeatedly since
that time. So far as I know, no other
woman, except of her own family, has
visited her. I have never seen any
evidence of danger toward any woman
in the employ of the Interior Depart
ment since I have been here, and I do
not believe it exists. I am perfectly
sure that if the soldiers were removed
to-morrow I could go anywhere In the
village, day or night, in perfect safety,
except at night I would carry a stick
Chicago Exchange. A man In the city
had a fox terrier of which he was very
proud, while the dog was as complete
ly devoted to him. He had to go to
some place in Michigan on business
which kept him away for several days.
As soon as he had gone the dog began
to suffer from a severe attack of lone
liness. He wouldn't eat, and lay about
moping until the man's wife was
afraid the terrier would die before his
master's return. One night the man
went into the station of the town
where he was stopping and said that
he wanted to talk to his dog. So con
nection was made with his house and
the receiver was placed to the terrier's
ear. Instantly he recognized his mas
ter's voice and began to frolic about
and bark at a great rate. Two or
three times after that the Chicago man
repeated the performance and he
didn't mind the $10 or $12 that it cost
him in the least.
"There have been various fiction sto
ries written which involved proposals
by telephone, but I know of at least
one instance in which such a thing ac
tually occurred. The young man was
so pleased that when it was over he
told me all about it. He had been
courting a girl in an Ohio town, the
name of which it isn't necessary to
give here, had quarreled with her for
some foolish reason and had come east,
intending to sail for Europe. He had
been thinking the matter over on the
way, decided that he had been a fool,
and when he heard that another fel
low was after the girl made up his
mind to heroic measures. So he sent a
message to the girl asking her to come
to the telephone, but not giving his
name. When he came to the office to
keep the appointment he was the most
nervous fellow I ever saw, and I'll bet
that no man was ever more agitated in
the actual presence of his charmer.
But he managed to get through the
business somehow, and the result was

opinion that if the authorities at Fort!
Wingate had sent word to the four men
that they were wanted at the post,
they would have all gone in without
any one to arrest them. I certainly
do not feel any need of soldiers for pro
tection, and the young ladies in the
school express the same sentiment."
Mr. D. D. Graham, who has been In-4
difin trader at Zuni since 1880, said:
"I don't think there was any real ne
cessity for troops at any time, and do
not think so now. When Major God-i
frey arrived, only two of the priests l
were in the village. He sent for them
and they came. Deputy Sheriff Behil
of Valencia County was there with the
warrants. The two priests were asked
where the two others were and said
that they, could get them. Instead of
locking them up or imprisoning them 1
Major Godfrey told them to go after the
other two men, who were about twenty
miles out in the country. They went
and got them and all four of the men
who were wanted reported next day,
with their blankets, and accompanied!
the troops to .Wingate, whence they,
were sent to Las Lunas and placed in
jail to await trial, which will be thÂ»
latter part of this month. Ni-u-tche,
High Priest of the Bow, Ha-to-tse.
No-ma-see and Ke-a-se, lesser priests,
were the men arrested. Ma-sche, also
a member of the priesthood, is acting
high priest and is conducting thÂ»;
dances in the village now."
I asked Ka-pa-te-wi, the Zunl Gov-j
ernor, if the children would be with
drawn from the school if the troops
were to leave. He speaks fairly good,
English and among other things said:
"Troops make no difference 'bout send
boy and girl school. You ask Wash
ington (meaning the Interior Depart
ment) send 'nother womans for teach,
what no cut off hair, no jaw children;
then Zuni glad send all boy and girl
school. Miss Dessette she want Zunl
girl hair cut all around. She say if Zunl
girl. cut front ("bangs" are worn by all
Zuni girls and women), she cut off back;
hair all same. That what the matter.
Ask Washington send 'nother woman."
"Tu-ma-cha," or "Nick," as he is bestj
known, is the linguist of the tribe. Hei
was for many years interpreter for Mr. 1
Graham and is considered a smart In
dian. He said:
"We don't need soldier; soldier he nou
want to stay here neither. Mlsa Des-'
sette think if soldier stay, him scam)
Zuni girl to go to school. Soldier he no 1
want scare girl. I take my daughter J

SOCIETY.
TflE past week has been dull, stale
and unprofitable, as it is right
the first week in Lent should be.
Society is resting and interesting
itself in church and charity work
and incidentally preparing for
the regular summer exodus.
No social festivities will mark the pe
riod of sackcloth and ashes. During mid-
Lent small luncheons and dinners will be
in order, but until then rest, peace, quiet
for fashion's devotees.

MARIE WAINWRIGHT'S OPINION OF THE DRAMA.
Marie Wainwright's desertion of the so
called legitimate field of the drama, for
the more prosaic and infinitely more prof
itable branch called melodrama, has at
tracted no little attention this season.
Miss Wainwright admits that she could
not make "both ends meet" In the high-
class Shakespearean roles, In which she
appeared for so many years.
"Our taate for Shakespeare seems to be
in somewhat of a dormant condition," she
says. "When there are such artistic pro
ductions as Mr. Daly, Mr. Irving and
many of our own stars have given us, we
can hardly lay the blame at the door of
the long-suffering manager for the non
support of the immortal bard. But, alas,
we have fallen upon degenerate times,
and we actorn and managers must live,
and living for us means pleasing the ever
fickle playgoer, who must have what he
demands. Just now Shakespeare la not
his mood.
"A few years ago the situation was dif
ferent. The stage was not then flooded
with the farcical trash that is now inun
dating the good and legitimate. Unless
the public wakes up to its own degener
acy I cannot see what will become of the
drama. You see I take a rather pessimis

ATE THIRTY GEESE IN THIRTY DAYS
-andâ
HE'S READY TO DO IT AGAIN.
SOUTH BEND is proud In the citi
zenship of the champion goose eater.
His name is Charles L. Wurz. He
has eaten thirty geese In thirty days.
Each of these geese weighed eleven
pounds before cooking, and South
Bend epicures are amazed. In a month
he has eaten twice his weight in geese.
This was the song with which Wurz
cheered his drooping spirits. For a month
he ate goose morning, noon and night:
"Oh, it is my opinion, . ,
That stuffed with sage and lnyun.
No bird that flies is half so nice
As goose with sage and inyun.
Goose was with him sleeping and wak
ing. He wrestled successfully with the
problem, however and at the finish was
ten pounds heavier than when he began,
says the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Benjamin Rose, the man who took the
other end of the bet, lost $200 on Mr.
Wurz's remarkable capacity for bird.
Those who have successfully tackled
thirty small and Insignificant quail in
thirty days will be amazed when they
learn that Mr. Wurz not only won his
wager but that he has actually thrived
on the diet. _ ,
It was an ill-fated clay when Benjamin
Rose met Wurz a month ago and took
up the subject of goose as an article of
diet.
"Why," said Wurz, "I like goose bo
well that I could pet away with one a
day for thirty days."
"You are talking through your hat,
replied Rose. "Why. I know a man who
tried to eat thirty quail in thirty days,
and he got sick on the fifteenth bird and
gave it up. Thirty geese! Mt.
The discussion became warm. Both
men became heated. "I'll tell y;u what
I'll do," said Rose. "I'll bet you $200 that
you can't eat a goose every day for thirty
days." â¢
"Done. I win." sail Wurz.
Then the following agreement was
drawn up:
I am to be Riven 24 hours to eat one gooso
a day for 30 successive days. . .. .
I, Charles Wurz. aptve to eat each bird.
The geese, after beinK ricked, must weigh
no less than six and no more than 11 pounds.
All eating must be <!<ne in the presence of
duly appointed witness. â *, who are to be mem
bers of the Elks' Lodfre. "
If I fail to perform the above feat I hereby
promise to pay Benjamin Knf=e the sum of $20fl.
The agreement signed by Rose was as
follows:
I. Benjamin Rose, hereby wager Charles L.
Wurz the sum of $200 that he cannot eat 30
geese in 30 consecutive days, said geÂ«se to
â weigh not less than six nor more than 11
pounds.
These geese are to be selected by me. The

REVOLUTION IN THE AIR.
Continued from Page Seventeen.
in price and money is becoming pro
portionately scarcer. Gutierrez is held
up to the ignorant natives as the cause
of the present hard times. Change the
government and change the times was
whispered.
He has reiterated time and again
that he will set an example for future
Salvadorian Presidents by stepping
out of office on the day his term ex
pires. But the people, chafing under
the thoughts of waiting a year for that
event, have had their impatience
fanned into fury by the students of the
university.
And this Is how the revolution
started:
The residents of San Salvador awoke
one morning not long ago to find on
their doorsteps a little newspaper
teeming with burning denunciation of
Gutierrez, his policy and the Govern
ment. The name of the paper was
well chosen: El Latigoâ The Lash.
With all the fire and enthusiasm of
hot-blooded youth, the student editors
scourged the Government. They plied
the lash fiercely and furiously.
Next day notice was sent to the
rector of the university by the Govern
ment commanding him to see that the
paper was suppressed. A meeting of
the students was promptly called, and
the two young men who had edited
the sheet boldly admitted their handi
work.
The rector tried in vain to administer
reproof. His words were drowned by
the bravos, cheers and shouts of ap
proval that rang from the assembled
students.
Fired by enthusiasm, the editors de
clared that they would continue to
publish El Latigo even though they
were expelled for it.
The next morning the second number
of El Latigo appeared. The official
newspaper of the town was neglected,
and the citizens swallowed the burning
editorials in El Latigo with their morn
ing coffee. What action would the
President take against the irrepres
sible students? That was the one
question on every lip.
At nightfall the question was an
swered. All that day squads of stu
dents paraded the streets with flying
banners whereon was emblazoned
"Free Speech, Free Press." The youth
ful orators gathered at the street cor
ners and addressed the multitude,
grumbling over hard times. It was not
difficult to arouse them. Gutierrez had
long since lost favor in their eyes.
"Santa Maria, what sort of a man is
this President? Out with him!" they
shouted.
Unmolested by the Government the
students thus tried their eloquence on
the populace. Their blood was stirred
and interference on the part of the
police was all they thirsted for. because
it would have meant a set-to, fight,
bloodshed and a baptism of glory for
the cause.
At nightfall the students assembled
in front of the university buildings and
from there marched to Bolivar Park,
where all San Salvador betakes itself
in the cool of the evening. But this
night everything else was forgotten,
and the people thronged about the
|Matform erected for the occasion and
Applauded the editors of El Latigo, aa
they hurled defiance at the President,
fried and the back roasted brown. These por
tions, including the gizzard, must be eaten
by Wurz in the presence of duly appointed
â witnesses.
If Charles Wurz performs this feat I hereby
promise to pay him the sum of $200.
When the clock struck the hour of mid
night last Friday night Wurz had com
pleted his thirtieth goose, and Rose
handed over the wager of $200, at the
same time proclaiming Wurz the cham
pion goose-eater of the world.
Never for a moment during the long
ordeal did Wurz falter in his task. The
first ten geese disappeared like magic,
and the weight of the eater increased
perceptibly. Then Wurz went about his
task with more thought and deliberation.
He consulted his appetite with more care
and took more exercise. He tried in
every way to forget that he was eating
goose.
Rose took good care to see that every
goose was up- to the full weight and it
is probable that the- net gooseflesh eaten
by Wurz every day was fully eight
pounds.
What makes It all the more remarkable
is that Wurz weighs only about 165

Dr. and Mrs. Jordan were at home to
the students last Friday evening. A num
ber of well though out charades. In
which the president took a prominent
part, were given. These monthly "at
! homes" which Dr. Jordan and his wife
give to the students are very popular and
those who go once always make endeav
ors to attend others.
Delta T'psilon fraternity gave a musi
cale on Saturday evening and not since
the Kirmess, of happy memory, have so
the Government and the rector of the
university.
"Who shall bid us stop our paper?
Have we not the right of free press;
have we not the right of free speech?
Shall we maintain our rights? We will.
And you, fellow students, will you help
us?"
"Si! si!" madly yelled the students.
But while their shouts were sounding
on the air, mounted regulars and police
charged the crowd and captured the
editors, despite the frantic defense of
their spirited friends.
The prisoners were taken to Jail,
where they spent the night, thus pre
venting the appearance of El Latigo
on the following morning.
The next day the students were re
leased, after a law forbidding inflam
matory speeches, passed seven years
before, was read to them.
The rector of the university refused
to allow them to continue their studies.
Formal notices of expulsion were hand
ed them.
Immediately a mass-meeting of stu
dents was called and all but twenty de
clared that if the two editors were ex
pelled they would quit college with
them.
The rector remained firm, so the stu
dent body quietly marched out of the
building, leaving a handful to uphold
the dignity of the institution. The rec
tor is the only salaried man in the uni
versity at San Salvador, all the other
instructors giving their services vol
untarily, the lawyers and doctors con
sidering it an honor to be chosen to
instruct In the medical and law depart
ments.
The students who had voluntarily
marched out of the university rented a
suitable building, easily secured in
structors and soon had their own uni
versity in good working order.
That they would go to such lengths
shows how determined they are and
what a factor they will be in the forth
coming revolution.
A gentleman who has spent many
years in Salvador says that the fact
that everything has been compara
tively quiet since the discontinuance of
El Latigo and the desertion of the
State University only goes to show
that some definite plan of 'action has
been agreed upon by the dissatisfied.
Merchants are said to be waiting for
turbulent times to order their goods,
for then it will be an easy matter to
avoid paying duty.
Each little county in Salvador has
its contestant for the Presidential
plum, and that is a great point in fa
vor of Gutierrez, for they will be di
vided among themselves. The two
principal aspirants are Prudencio Al
faro, the present Vice-President, and
Carlos Melendez.
Another Important factor In the
contest is the question as to the where
abouts of the 20,000 stand of arms that
the Ezetas supplied their recruits dur
ing the Gutierrez revolution. Nobody
knows where those arms are secreted.
The probability is that each man hid
his crwn accouterments and that it will
be impossible for either side to lay
hands on them.
It may be a week, It may be a month
before the revolution breaks out.
Which side will win? Who can tell?

tionist. E. W.

Wurz and Rose are members of the
Order of Elks, and their -^uod qualities,
both in the personal and epicurean lines,
are well known. Here is his own story:
I did not find it any trouble to eat thir
ty geese in thirty days. I simply quit
eating everything else and gave my
whole attention to it. I did not suffer at
all from indigestion, as goose is very
agreeable to me. I found the greatest
trouble with the fried legs and wings, as
some of them were tough. Every goose
was up to the weight limit and
was eaten in the presence of reliable wit
nesses. I am ready, after a certain time,
to undertake the same task again for a
reasonable sum of money. I do not think
I would have any trouble in eating two
quail a day for thirty consecutive days.
At a recent meeting: of the directors
of the New River Company it was
etated that, with the exception of a rel
atively small quantity taken from a
main belonging to the Midland Rail
way Company, the whole of the water
used in the extinction of the great
Jewin-street fire in the city of London
was supplied from the pipes of the
New River Company. The total quan
tity drawn by the fire brigade was 13,
000,000 gallons, which is equal to a
weight of 67,000 tons. The whole of
this vast quantity of water was sup

A DESIGN IN FINE FLANNEL
QUEER PRACTICES OF THE
NEGRO VOODOO DOCTORS
THE mysterious rites of Voodoo,
instead of being upon the de
cline among the Northern ne
groes, seem rather to obtain a
firmer hold every day. Civiliza
tion would appear to have little or no
effect in deterring the colored race
from patronizing "voodoo doctors" and
squandering money on "conjuring
; speils."
â Such is the opinion of Dr. L. B. Or
chard, a well-known Southerner, who
has devoted some time and study to the
subject of voodooism throughout the
â cities on the hither side of Mason and
Dixan's line.
â  -"I can state of my own knowledge,"
says i>r. Orchard, "that there are now
in New York at least seven voodoo doc
; tors practicing among the colored peo
ple, apparently with considerable profit
. to themselves. In Philadelphia I know
of three voodoo doctors in the nelgh
. "borhood of South street alone. One of
the Quaker City practitioners of 'con
juring' has a national reputation
among the colored people. He Is Eben
ilassy, and his age must be about 90
years, although negroes will tell you
with awe that he has long passed hiu
. one hundredth winter.
' "I know personally of only one voo
doo doctor in Chicago, although I have
been told that there are many others.
Pittsburg rejoices in a female con
jurer. Chief of Detectives Roger
o'Mara introduced me to her some
years ago. She was then living in the
neighborhood of Grant street and do
ing a thriving business among the col
ored Lolk. But I believe the police have
elnce put a stop to her career.
â¢Despite the education which he re
ceives to-day, the negro is still a primi
tive being, and spells, magic and the
likeâ the stock in trade of voodooismâ
appeal forcibly to his credulous nature.
He does not stand alone among the
races of civilization, either, in this par- I
ticular. There are witch doctors among j
the Pennsylvania Dutch, and only last I
year a case was brought to light in Ire
land where the black art had been in
voked with fatal results.
"It takes considerable persuasive
power, plus a strong financial consider
ation, to gain admittance to the sanc
tum of a voodoo doctor in cities where
the police organization happens to be
active against such imposition. Money,
without other influence, will avail you
nothing. As for me, I have many
friends Cold acquaintances of ante bel
lum times) among the colored people.
With the aid of Georgia darkies, who
knew me or my kin, I have frequently
secured entrance where it would have
been mighty dangerous for any North
ern white man to attempt to penetrate.
"For instance, no later than ten days
ago, I was brought by appointment to
visit a New York voodoo doctor of
prominence in his profession. My col
ored guide led me to a flat house in
East Ninety-seventh street, in a block
specially favored by negroes of the
richer sort. The house was very neatly
kept, nor was there anything in the flat
dwelt in by our 'cunjurer' to hint at the
mystic performances which were gone
through within.
"The grizzled old doctor was Inclined
to be angry when he discovered that a
white man had come to patronize him.
Clearly he feared police espionage. But
after a brief talk about the South and
the discovery that we both hailed from
the district around Atlanta, he percen
tlbly relaxed. Then my mentor told
him that I wanted a spell â 'a cunjuh'in'
â pell'â he called itâ to charm back the

be mentioned to any woman. Lent or
otherwise, and at this time, when dinner
dances and balls and theater parties are
out of the question, it becomes doubly
fine from the attention that is put upon
it.
If you were to ask the most popular
fabric for the informal luncheon you
would be surprised If you were told that
it was French flannel, yet such is the
case. There is no material one-half^ as
much in vogue to-day for a very infor
mal waist, sacque or gown for a small

i once.
" 'Ah's done got fine chah'ms, suh?'
he said. 'Does yo' want d<- po' man's
| chah'm, er de gemman's chah'm?'
"How much is the gentlemen's
j charm?' I asked.
< " 'Gemman's chah'm five dollars, suh;
j po' man's chah'm two dollars fifty.'
"I took the gentlemen's charm which
completed my conquest of the doctor.
Having first obtained my money and
carefully examined it, to guard against
I mistakes, he drew the curtain at the
' end of the room in which we were
j standing. There was then exposed to
view as queer . looking den as it has
ever been my fortune to behold.
"The apartment was naturally In
clined to be dark, for it had no wln
i dow, and the only light came from the
i front room. Around the wall and dang
i ling by strings from the ceiling were
! curious objects â skins, skulls of bird
| and beast, odd bones and other name
! less relics. On a deal table in the mid
dle of the floor stood the "tuffed figure
of a great horned owl â one of those
fine fellows one c counters in the upper
parts of Louisiana, and especially ven
| crated by apostles of Voodoo. Over in
the most distant corner glowed an or
dinary gas stove and upon this was
a pot. What decoction the vessel con
tained, I know not; but it exhaled an
unpleasant, nauseating odor, and the
old 'doctor' varied his occupation of
preparing my 'charm' by stirring It
vigorously at intervals.
"Despite the commonplace gaa stove
I could not help recalling the witches in
Macbeth and their cauldron, as I gazed
at and smelt the Voodoo 'doctor's' mix
ture. I was not allowed to approach
any nearer than the dividing curtain to
examine the interior decorations of this
6x9 apartment of the black art. Every
time that I made a motion to cross the
prescribed limits my colored guide
twitched my sleeve by way of warn
ing.
"The 'doctor* went to a shelf and
I took down sundry bundles of what
; looked to me to be bunches of dried
: herbs. These he mixed in a small teacup
i and poured over them a glass of water.
Mumbling a few words (unintelligible
to me, and which I strongly suspect to
be gibberish), he strained the decoction
through a piece of cheesecloth bottled
the liquid portion, and presented it to
me with a bow.
" 'Dat ar,' said he, 'am de strongest
chah'm fo' love. Yo steep de young
lady's han'kchlef in dat chah'm, an' she
love you fo' suah.'
"The consultation appearing to be at
an end, I was forced to depart; but not
until I had made another effort to
study the 'fixings' of the inner room at
closer range. This time I positively
identified a coon skin, the skina of sev
eral rabbits and silver foxes, and what
looked like the skull of a dog. The old
'doctor' was suspicious of me to the
last and kept between me and the
cauldron.
"Two years ago I got a negro to get
me a love charm in Philadelphia, and
in that way opened up an acquaintance
with the notorious 'Doctor' Massy, al
ready mentioned. Massy's method of
preparing a love potion differed con
siderably from that of his New York
fellow-practitioner. Having first paid
over $2 by way of fee, the client was
called on for (5 more. This latter sum
was expended in purchasing five quart
bottles of whisky or rum and one
empty bottle. The full bottles Massy
placed in a circ'^ on the floor of what
he called his 'office.' Then he filled the
empty bottle with water, or with some
fluid that closely resembled water, and,

PECULIAR TADS OF SOME OF OUR PROMINENT MEN.
THE man of current affairs is almost Invariably a man with a. fad. De
pend upon It, he has his predilection for the acquirement of some one
thins, or the pursuit of some one pleasure, though he may not choose to
confess It.
Horace G. Platt has a penchant for inkstands. Not the plain, ordinary
inkwell of commercial usage, but those with a singular and engrossing
individuaJity. The Platt inkwells are nothing if not quaint, and a readable
little chapter of sentiment attaches to each of them. The attorney disdains an
inkwell that is not capacious, and will not suffer his collection to be invaded
by a flippant, shallow affair such as women ornament their escritoires with.
Mr. Plan's favorites are the Bilver and cut-glass inkwell, graven with his
name and a solemn owl's head, presented to him by his fellow directors of the
Bohemian Club, and a curious silver elephant's head.
Mr. Platt has another very pronounced fad. He turns a kindly ear when
ever a poet essays to sing hereabouts. In a word, no rhymester, whatever his
ability, need place his wares in the San Francisco market without the comfort
ing certainty that at least one copy of his book will be sold. Mr. Platt is as
certain to buy it as the fog is sure to roll in through the Golden Gate. He is
the patron saint of local poets.
Skulls and crossbcmes are the perennial delight of Consul Warburton,
Great Britain's representative In these parts. He is ever on a still hunt for
prehistoric races and aboriginal relics, and In every mound that meets his
gaze he sees possible plunder In grinning Jaws and bony craniums, awaiting
excavation and scientific discovery. It must not be imagined that the Consul
uses his finds for bric-a-brac, or that his back yard le* littered with the un
canny curiosities. He carefully examines their skullships, rejects those that
seem valueless on account of their too recent interment, and after duly label
ing them, transports them across seas to the British Museum. The Consul is
a genuine lover of curios in general and skeletons In particular.

Ambrose Bierce has an affinity for lizards and horned toads, and wields a
mysteriously powerful influence over these strange objects of his regard. At
one time the famous critic had the most interesting and intelligent collection
of trained horned toads in the country, but he went East, and in his absence
they pined away. At all events, Mr. Bierce's toadery is no more. Disaster also

neighboring cat lunched off it on a summer's day as it lay basking in the sun

lizard, which immediately crawled into position on the table and prostrated

Mr. Morganstern of the Baldwin Theater has a fad for the Maori green
stone. Twenty-five years ago he was presented with one by George Chaplin,
then leading man for Janauschek, and ever since that time Mr. Morganstern
has been addicted to the green stone habit. Never a ship in all this quarter
of a century has come- hither from- New Zealand without a small consignment
of these stones in her cargo to the Baldwin Theater's representative, who has
been sowing the emerald souvenirs broadcast among his many friends. The
New Zealand natives use them principally for spear points, but Mr. Morgan
stern wears his as a watch charm. It has served to establish his identity upon
more than one occasion.
Gustav Walter, who rakes Europe over for vaudeville eccentricities, is an
admirer of diamonds. He Is said to possess a diamond solitaire that would

Manager Thall of the Alcazar contents himself with photos of actresses.
None but the pretty need apply, either. His collection Includes lovely women

theatrical sweetness in pose and expression.
Neither gems nor pictured faces are the fad of S. H. Friedlander. He does
not long to scintillate with precious stones or be surrounded by histrionic si

elegant affairâ ls one that la made of the
very finest pale pink cloth, which Is part
wool and part cotton. It resembles a very
heavy cashmere and was called by one
shopkeeper cashmere and by another
half-weight.
This was fitted to the waist all around
except in front, where It was lightly
bloused, or, more properly speaking, hung
straight, depending for its blouse effect
upon the waist arrangement of the rib

a yoke of lace falling over It. The dressi

which Is sot rows of puffed ribbon. Puff

strapped with the same pink ribbon.
A very decided relief of color Is obtained
by the belt, which is of deep petunia vel
vet. It is tied in a bow in front, with the
ends hanging long over the skirt.
No skirt is prettier with such a Jacket
that a striped silk skirt, if one owns such
an article. Black and white striped
skirts are coming in and are always popu
lar favorites. Such a striped skirt looks
better with a waist of pale pink than a
black one, as the contrast is considered
by many of artistic tastes as entirely too
sharp.
In the chiffon ruffle are run rows of pe
tunia ribbon of very narrow width and in
the hair is worn a bow of petunia velvet.

Petunia, !t may be stated, 1b a shade
that while not purple, suggests it, and
which, while by no means a deep red, yet
reminds you of wine color. All attempts
to make of petunia a cream shade have
been futile, just as It Is Impossible to un
derstand white as "rose color," though
roses come white. Pale pink Is not ge
ranium, though you see many geraniums
In that shade. Plum color Is not green,
though there may be green plums.
In ordering goods by mail from the
shops it is well, when uncertain colors are
mentioned, to Inclose a sample or to ex
actly specify the shade, or the greatest
confusion sometimes arises. In "forget
me-not blue" for instance, how many peo

is desired?
As one Is not alwayÃ. the hostess at a
luncheon party, it may be well to know
something about the waist which one can
wear. Many women go to Lenten lunch
eon in a church gown, but where no
church-going is intended afterward there
is a choice of pretty, informal and com
fortable waists.
Of course, when you speak of an "Infor
mal" waist, something loose is meant or
semi-tight. In a fur-lined cape or a big
winter wrap, a woman can run In for the
luncheon hour In one of th^se Informal
waists without criticism. Ijj fact, they
are positively fashionable for Lent.

The story has been traced to a very

L. S. B. Sawyer has been adding to his valuable collection of books and

Attorney W. H. L. Barnes Is devoted to the study of astronomy, and haÃ
maps galore of the starry firmament. Not many men In the United States
know more about physical geography than he. The well-known lawyer-oratoT
has a revolving globe to whloh he turns when he needs recreation, and whose
miniature surface he has traversed countless times in imagination. Starting
from the port of San Francisco in a splendidly equipped yacht with auxiliary
steam and provisions for a year's voyage, Mr. Barnes traces his course over
the waters, of the earth, spreading sail and casting anchor wherever fancy dic
tates. And he affirms that when that yacht of his gets back into the bay
again he is always refreshed in body and mind for the Journey he has made
without leaving his office chair.
Alexander K. Coney, Mexican Consul, Is of the opinion that very nearly
every other man, woman and child In America has a fad for foreign stamps.

Mr. Coney has yielded to his correspondents, and is now regarded as a sort of

Frank S. Johnson, say his friends, dearly loves a dogr fight. Nor Is his fad
for pugnacious canines his only bellicose tendency. To en-gage a couple of
street gamins in a friendly fisticuff encounter delights Mr. Johnson, who has
been known to forget his lunch hour while a fascinated onlooker at ragamuffin
pugilism. A neat punch on an antagonist's solar plexus will send Mr. John

George C. Pardee, Oakland's ex-Mayor and oculist of this city, shares Mr.
Barnes' liking for astronomy. When not engaged in mending the eyes of his

ly fitted at the back and sides and is laid
in folds in front. Over the folds is tied,
coming from the side seams, a very nar

The yoke is laid in small plaits, one
touching the other, and it is bordered
with very broad white lace, which falls in
double ruffles over the shoulders. The
collar is of turquoise velvet, and there are
bands of velvet upon the wrists. The yoke
is further decorated with the very tiniest
bands of the velvet, put on apparently un

proved an exceptionally clever pupil â
so much so that after a few lessons aha
boldly started out as a hypnotic healer
on her own account and did quite a
thriving business "suggesting" to peo

her new avocation and caught minnows
in plenty, but at last the day cams

catch something very near akin to a
whale, and that was an Oakland capi

well, and who came to her for raesmerlo

that on principle) treatment.
Here was the lady's opportunity, at
least she thought so. She exerted her
power to the utmost, and without her
patient's knowledge made him com
pletely subject to her will. She was
kind enough to "suggest" to him among
the other things which she brought to
his attention while he slept the sleep
of the passive "subject" under her Cir
cean spell, that he should no longer
fancy himself ill, but should look upon
himself as a well man from that time
forth, and he obeyed her, at least to
all appearances he did.
She also suggested, however, that he
should express his gratitude to her for
her kindness in curing him by writing
her a check for $500 and present her
with a set of diamonds to match the
sparkle of her handsome eyes. And he
did.
Then she went a step fartherâ in
fact, she determined to make him a
stepfather to her rather overgrown "lit

such an arrangement would be most
desirable. The result is an engagement
which is to end in a marriage in the

WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
The old familiar question, What is
electricity? that is asked in every text
book on electricity, and is answered by
saying that it is an imponderable fluid
capable of traversing the air, the earth
and especially all metals, and for com
mercial purposes flows through iron or
copper wires In an invisible fluid state,
has no foundation in fact; but ad-i
vanced electrical scientists to-day re-:
cognize no such theory and are free to '
admit that the exact nature of elec
tricity is unknown. The sources of
electricity, such as are termed frlc
tional electricity, hydro electricity,
pyro electricity, magneto electricity,
thermo electricity, animal and vegeta
ble electricity, etc., are not different
kinds of electrical force. Electric force
or energy is of one kind only, no mat

A NEW STORY OF CARABAS.
THE Marquis of Carabas, he
whose fortunes were made by
Puss in Boots, had one son, a
brave lad named Arthur. One day
Arthur called Puss in Boots to
Join him, and together they went
to the King's stables, where two fine
horses were waiting, ready saddled.
"Come," saJd the Prince, for it will
be recollected that the Marquis of Cara
baa married the King's daughter, "let
us be off."
"And where to, master?" asked Puss,
. who was still active, although quite old.
"I am going to find my beautiful
cousin Gwendolin, the only daughter of
the oldest son of the miller, and to
save her from a dungeon, into which
she has been thrown to be held for a
ransom by some robbers."
The Prince said no mcrre, but rode
bo hard that Puss found much work
: keeping up. Soon the Prince and Puss
â¢were beyond the lands of Carabas and
, traveled in a strange country. At sun
; down they found a tollgate across the
road. Beside the tollgate was an inn.
The Prince drew rein and entered the
: Inn for refreshments, but Puss wait
', ed outside, and talked with some horse
i men "who had just arrived. He had not
asked many questions when he learned
that they were the robbers. He was
about to warn the Prince when the
captain of the robbers said:
"Not so fast. Puss. We know that
you are going to try to take the lovely
Gwendolin from us. We will deal with
you now and with the Prince a little
later."
So saying the robber captain aimed
a blow at Puss with his sword, but
Puss jumped from the horse like a
flash and ran and hid in the inn stable.
A few minutes later he saw the rob
bers surround the Prince, and, al
though the Prince was brave, there
were so many robbers that he was soon
a prisoner and was tied hand and foot.
The robbers thought that now they
had made their fortunes, for the Mar
quis of Carabas would be sure to pay
a large sum for the ransom of his
.son. They drank much wine at the
Inn. "While they were sitting at the
â table they kept their eyes on the
Prince, that he might not escape.
Puss now put on the skin of a lion,
that he had found In the stable. He
first stuffed it with hay, that it might
seem large. Then he jumped in and
â¢walked toward the robbers. They were
frightened at what they supposed to
be a live lion. Puss made his voice
â¢large and roared. At the same time

showing the lion's teeth, and the rob
bers all ran away. Puss freed the
prince and they once more mounted
,their horses to ride on, laughing at the
terror of the robbers.

barred with iron. The keeper, who was

Jumped from his horse and scratched
up the flinty road with much vigor with
all four feet, until the horse could go
under the gate by kneeling, and soon
the Prince and Puss were cantering
over a lonely road toward the castle
where Gwendolin the Beautiful pined
in a dungeon.
The castle was guarded by an Ogre,
the son of that Ogre whose castle Puss
had given to the Marquis of Carabas,
PUSS READY TO GO WITH THE PRINCE.
and he kr.ew Puss and the Prince as
they neared the castle. He shouted at
them in a terribly voice:
"Hence or die!"
"Wait here, dear Prince," said Pusa,
"while I drive on."
Putting spurs to his horse. Puss
dashed up to the castle and was across
the drawbridge like a flash before the
Ogre could draw it up. The Ogre, mad
with rage, tried to catch the cat, but
could not and Puss once more found
a safe hiding-place, this time in the
Ogre's great chest. The Opre hunted
everywhere in vain. Finally he went
to sleep. "When Puss heard the Ogre's
heavy breathing he crept out of the
chest and ran through the gloomy
castle until he found a stone passage
that led down to the dungeons.
But the iron door was locked and it
could only be opened by a magic word.
Puss knocked softly on the door at
first for fear that the Ogre would
awaken. Getting no answer he knock
ed louder.
"Who is that?" asked a faint voice,
which was no other than Gwendolin's.
"I am Puss in Boots. Hurry and
give me the magic word that I may
open the door of your dungeon, for
your cousin, the Prince, has come to
rescue you."
THE BUMPKINS, THEIR WILD ANIMALS AND THE "GOTE HILL BAND" HAVE A "SIRKUSS" PARADE.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, STTKBAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1898.
The Ogre heard the voices and would
have run to the dungeon had not the
drawbridge of the castle fallen just
then with a dreadful clatter. The same
word that opened the dungeon door
lowered the drawbridge. The Prince,
who had been waiting outside the cas
tle, now made boldly in, blowing a
golden trumpet to challenge the Ogre
to battle.
In an instant the Ogre darted toward
the door of his armory to get his big
club of iron, studded with knots of iron
and sharp spikes. Puss had been there
already and had locked the door and
had thrown the key down a deep well
in the court yard.

the furnishings of his horse being all
of polished leather and solid gold, she
thought that she had never viewed any
man half so brave or so handsome.
But just then she espied the Ogre, who
was fully sixteen feet high. He was
running toward her with mlghtv strides
and the ground shook under his tread.
"Ha! ha! pretty <swendolin," he
roared, in a voice like that of a wild
beast, "you shall not escape so. Back
to your dungeon!"
"Save me, my Cousin Arthur," cried
Gwendolin, wringing her pretty hands.
"Fear nothing, Gwendolin," answered
the Prince, bravely, as his steed reared
wildly at the approach of the Ogre.
Spurring his horse to the top of its
speed over the rock-paved courtyard
floor the Prince did not wait for the
Ogre. High towered the Ogre above
the Prince as they drew near each
other. The Prince's horse stumbled and
the Ogre reached forward his huge
hands to seize the Prince. Puss ran
and placed his sword between the
Ogre'e feet and the monster fell on tHe
pavement, where the Prince speedily
overcame him.
When the robbers heard that the
Prince, aided by Puss in Boots, had de
feated the Ogre, they fled from the land
and have not returned to this day.
The Prince gave the castle to his
cousin, who reigned there, like a Prin

The Prince married her and Puss in

ABOUT THE COMPETITION.

quiries of many sorts have been re
ceived.
One girl writes to ask whether any
age limit has been fixed to determine
who may be eligible to compete. A boy
suggests that, when the two competi
tive pages shall have been published,
the first composed by the girls and
the second by the boysâ or vice versa
tile decision shall be reached by ballot.
This query and suggestion may be an
swered as follows:
The contest being devised for the
boys and girls, it would possibly be
well to fix eighteen years as the age
limit. Further suggestions are, how
ever, awaited. The majority will rule
in naming the terms of competition.
The decision concerning the relative
merits of the pages representing the
girls and the boys might be rendered
by ballot, but, very likely, after the
pages are published the boys and girls
will be impatient to get the decision.
Balloting is slow. Jurors, selected by
some method to be suggested, would
give their opinions with little delay
comparatively.
Many parents have written that their
boys and girls are interested and, al
ready, in their homes, are getting ready
to write in the competition. The drift
of opinion, so far, is in favor of story
telling. The advocates of fiction are up
to date, two to one, as compared with
those who consider essay-writing the
better test. The class of matter to be
ENTERING THE ROBBER'S CASTLE
published is the subject of lively dis
cussion. Some of the communications
â¢will be published soon â as soon as the
expression of opinions has become more
general.
Boys and girls are requested to -write
only upon one side of the paper, and to
write their names and postoffice ad
dresses plainly. All boys and girls re
siding in Pacific Coast States or Terri
tories are invited to send in their views
and suggestions. The following are the
principal points to be considered:
1. What age limit shall be fixed for
competitors'.'
2. Shall the boys or the girls be first
to publish their page?
3. How shall the judges or jurors be
chosen?
4. What class of matter is best adapt
ed to test the ability of the writer to be
interesting?
No story or essay should contain more
than 600 words. The idea is to get as
many articles as possible upon the two
pages. By prescribing the length this
can be carried out. At least six arti
cles by boys and six articles by girls
will be published and more if possible.
Next week progress will be reported.

CHAPTER XVIII.
THE fateful night had come, when
the final attempt was to be made
to rescue the White King, and to
carry him away, before the very
eyes of his enraged savages.- This
was the night when the savages'
witch doctor would offer up a half
score of savage victims upon fires, to
celebrate his birthday, and every sav
age In the tribe was assembled by
command of the witch doctor, who was
the real ruler of the savages.
Fires had been blazing in the camp
where the white men were, and above
the tree tops the savages had seen,
with awe and wonder, a dark object
flitting, and had shivered with fear, as
the object had mounted the sky, only
to be followed by the appearance of
similar objects. The hearts of the
savages were full of dread, but they
were also burning with hatred of the
white men.
Round rose the full moon, round and
beautiful,, above the top of the table
mountain. Its light fell upon the vil
lage of the White King, and brought to
view, In the center of the King's vil
lage, a large space enclosed with a
ring of stones. Within this ring were
four piles of faggots and four stakes.
At the outer edge of the ring were the
shivering wretches who were to be
burned alive.
They were to die that the curse
brought by the coming of the white
men might be set aside. Among them
â were young girls, daughters of chiefs,
and two little children, for the witch
doctor had said that all ages must suf
fer that all ages might be free of the
curse. The girls and children wailed
in their fear, but the warriors who
were to die were proud and still.
The White King was squatting in
front of the piles of faggots, and near
him, but moving nervously about, like
a caged panther, was the tall and pow
erful witch doctor, whose eyes were
always upon the King. The light of
torches, carried by the chiefs of the
several tribes, who were to light the
sacrificial fires, fell, flickering upon the
faces of savages from all parts of the
land, for the news of the coming of
the white men had been carried far
and wide, and the entire people were
enraged.
Near the king was a man of great in
telligence â Kemoria â who, trusting to
his color and the darkness to give him
protection, had fearlessly entered in
among' the savages, well knowing that
death might follow if he were discov
ered, but he was nevertheless deter
mined to play the great part that night
that had been assigned to him by Harry
Ostend. Come success or come death,
Kemona would not fail to do his share.
At the opposite side of the ring was
another man who was fully. as daring
â Koti â the savage who had been Bin
nie's second in the command of the
savage army that won the victory at
the battle of the Marwise River.
When the moonlight fell full upon the
victims of the night the savages
brought logs and placed them by the
piles of faggots, that the fires might
burn the longer. Kemona placed one
log at each faggot pile. Why did he do
this? Was the savage awakening in
PUSS FINDS A SAFE HIDING PLACL
him? He and Koti had their war clubs,
and in each club were concealed pistols
and cartridges.
The witch doctor ordered that the
fires be now lighted. He said, in a loud
voice, that he would not use the stakes
to tie the victims this night, but that
the unlucky ones would be thrown, pin
ioned. Into the flames. This being his
birthday, he would give them a chance
to escape -by the burning of their bonds.
A hoarse cry went up from the waiting
savages, and the torch-bearing chiefs
hesitated to light the tires as they
looked up.
"Give me a torch," shrieked the witch
doctor, with rare, "I will light the fires,
though all the skies should fall upon us,
and the mountains should bury the
land from sight."
But, lo! in the sky was -now a won
derful sight. Across the face of the full
moon, even as the witch doctor defied
the skies, passed a dark globe that car
ried beneath it a mass of fire. From
the globe came flashes and loud explo
sions. At once all the thousands of
savages were upon, their feet and
shouting In dire chorus that the curse
had fallen upon the land. â¢
Down, down from the lofty heights
of the sky came, slowly and majesti
cally, the dusky globe, with flaming
brands that the savages supposed to
have been kindled in the sky.
Not a moment paused the iron-nerved
witch doctor, although he was as much
puzzled by this strange apparition as
were fhe savages over whom he ruled
with steady hand. He placed the torch
to the four piles of fagots in quick
succession, and the twigs burst into
flame.
Even then embers fell on his head
.and shoulders from the visitor from the
sky, searing his skin, but he was too
JUNGLE IN THE FROST.
Illumined with the highest art was the chilled window pane,
For there the fairy, Frost, had toiled all night with might and main;
And there were minarets and towers of many cubits span.
Such as are seen where tinkling trains go into Ispahan;
And giant plants that grow in shade by Orinoco's flow;
And over flowering valleys lorded summits crowned with snow.
Amid the pictures which the deft, aerial fingers drew
Was a dim Jungle where tall canes and densest foliage grew.
'Twas seeming twilight, for the sun, slow leading on the day.
No golden arrows yet had sent upon their flaming way.
Athwart the jungle something moved. Between the cane bright eyes
Peered at me; and a rustling sound filled me with new surprise.
Was 't then a dream? Or was it real? Was this a tiger's lair
To which on flying carpet I had journeyed through the air?
But tiger ne'er was dressed in white; and, lo! the sudden sun
The jungle lights; and from it smiles my baby, Romping Fun.
haughty to show that he was dis
turbed. Now a strange occurrence
jarred the nerves of the frightened
savages beyond endurance. From each
of the four faggot fires proceeded ter
rific sounds that followed explosions.
Following the noises came a rain of
faggots and burning brands and
torches. The sacrificial fires had been
scattered and torn to fragments, and
fire and ashes covered the heads of the
people, who began to flee in every di
rection.
The horrible black globe continued
to descend from the sky. The blazing
fire that it brought was the only light
excepting the white glare of the moon
by which the savages could see it. Many
refused to move, thus showing
their superior courage. These were
gathered about the witch doctor. Be
neath the black glo~be were two boys
with white faces. They held in their
hands dark objects, from which they
poured forth, with noises that made
the woods reverberate, an unceasing
stream of fire in fierce flashes.
In all the ways through the forest
were heard in horror-stricken tones the
dismal death songs' of the savages, and
barbaric chanting, heralding the doom
of the King of the savages and of their
land.
When the dark globe had fallen to
the level of the tree tops the witch doc
tor stood as if petrified for a moment.
But he roused himself and cried to
those around him:
"Our doom may yet be set aside If
the King is not allowed to leave our
land."
His right hand flew to his long and
keen knife of bone. As agile as a
lion, he sprang toward the White King
to strike him down. The King heard
and saw the wLtch doctor, and his
blood was on fire, for he knew that
his only choice now was between death
and rescue. He must first fight for
his life. His own knife was fn his
hand. The savages, aghast with sur
prise, saw their witch doctor and their
King battling ferociously, each intent
only upon the other, and both seem
ingly forgetful of the presence of the
white men and of the doom of the
whole people.
The witch doctor was about to con
quer. The King has fallen, and the
sharp knife of the witch doctor is about
to fall. One more second and all is
over. The King will be no more, and
the Cruise of the California is a failure.
Is it true? That depends upon the
acts of the two white faced boys who
were "under the black globe, and who
are now upon the ground, Bfnnie and
Sam.
Not all, for Kemona and "Koti have
forced their way to the middle of the
circle of the raging savages, and there,
back to back, two against an army,
they are firing their revolvers in a des
perate struggle to keep back the bar
barians.
Blnnie and Ned see the witch doctor
look up and realize that he , has lost
his last chance, for the White -King
has struck him down and has leaped
into a basket that hangs below the
black globe. While Koti and Kemona
are making a heroic battle, the two
boys, strictly obeying Instructions, also
step into the basket, and Binnie cuts
a rope that held the â  globe to the
ground, and so the King departs from
Koti and Kemona drive back their
enemies, who are so disturbed by the
events of the night that they have lost
heart. Then Koti and Kemona speed
back to the white men's camp.
Two hours later all the white men,
having with them the White Kins
whom they have rescued, are on the
top of the table mountain, and are
making a rapid march toward the
Marwise River, where they will find
war canoes to take them back to the
California, as she lies at moorings. In
the yacht they will reach San Francis
co without other adventures.
So the prophecy of the witch doc
tor was fulfilled and the White Kins
was lost to view as he went toward
the sky.
Even while their King was being car
ried away toward the sky the savages,
who had lost him, felt the ground trem
ble beneath their feet. A horrible roar
ing noise â the sound of an avalancheâ
at the same time smote their ears.
The moon was suddenly hidden behind
driving clouds and the darkened sky
above them was rent by flashes of
lightning. An earthquake set In mo
tion masses of rocks upon the moun
tain nearest the village, and these
rushed down with fearful speed upon
the doomed people. Where the chief
village of the Afarkise was there is
now only ruin. c
So ends the story of the first cruise
of the California. _ . D. H. W.

MARY AND THE KITTENS,
BY MARION DEWEY.
O, our household Mary's a very mean
miss;
She pulls kittens' tails and makes them
go "siss!"
The poor little creatures, they tremble
with fear
Whenever the sound of her footsteps
' draws near.
She pinches their tails and she beats them
with brooms.
And she hunts them unmercifully out of
the rooms.
But one kitten, Buffy, her favorite. It
seems.
Invading her window, breaks In on her
dreams.
In the night, at that window, she hears a
queer sound,
And she trembles for fear that the burg
lars are 'round.
But it's only her Buffy, who now In the
night
Takes revenge for his wrongs, which la
only but right.
For she kicks him and beats him and
pull 3 his poor rail,
And none of his spits are of slightest
avail.
But Mary has good points as well as the
bad;
And when at the kittens she isn't too
mad _j .
She showers attentions on Buffy Bob
dear,
And catches him up by the tail, nose or
ear.THE TIVOLI, "THE GEISHA,"
"ROBIN HOOD" AND
"SHALL WE FORGIVE HER?"
I notice with regret that the Tivoll
has been getting the cold shoulder all
round lately. Stijce "The Geisha" noth
ing seems to succeed there. Of course,
at the present time the Tivoli is suffer
ing from the Bostonians, an honorable
ilon, but earlier productionsâ "The
Pearl of Peking." for oneâ have been
glittoringly good and have fallen on
few ears. The piece that has been run
ning the past week, "The Vice-Ad
miral," a very model of German comic
opera, has sone absolutely begging. I
confess the performance left something
to be desired, but there was a lot in it
that was valuable; and one of those
Ftunning finales should have been a
feast in itself for anybody who cares
tor. the unadulterated essence of the all
but l-'si art of musical comic opera.
" The <r-M?h;i" spoiled the Tivolite. Ever
the run of that jolly Anglo-Japa
;n;isterpiece nothing else has been
enough for him; he has used the
llenciea of "The Geisha" as a club
with which to smite the shortcomings
; of her successors. So the Tivoli man
agement has been practically driven to
r revival of the success of three months
ago. I wish the enterprise joy. No one
> shouted louder than I in acclaim of the
Vreisha" production; the clinging
jingle of the music and the lyrics, the
;-â¢:. -grace of the pictures and the general
I work of the company prejudiced
I rodigiously in favor of the little
eld opera house around the corner. I #
; ied the adulatory adjective for all I
worth that week, and gave the
press agents a hard run in the race of
praise; and I can row confess in mod
esty that they were beaten at their own
game. But doubtless they were handi
capped by the truth. Nothing can be
more painful to a press agent than for
him to find that his rosiest flights of |
fabrication are nothing stronger than !
mere fact.
If local pride Is ever to bÂ« considered
In the theater we have an institution!
to gloat over in the Tivoli, the ancestor j
of cheap opera in America. The Tivoli i
used to stand alone as the house that j
; gave the most for the least, but the J
popularity of cheapness has spread, j
Philadelphia and Boston now pride
themselves on inexpensive music. The
Castle Square Opera Company of Phil
adelphia, an organization in direct
model of our Tivoli, has established it
self in New York, the home of the most
expensive opera in the world. And this
little company with its little prices has
sriadly welcomed by the public and

not indulge in coarse jeers. The j
is generally a pretty safe place
te visit, and one to be encouraged so
â â¢â â¢'long as it sticks to the present policy
,can and, as nearly as is possible,
-^-gitimate performances. The town
owes the Tivoli a debt for the first
hearing of nearly all the later comic
\ operas and many of the grand operas.
No house in America has ever given
-like performances of grand opera at a
Kum within a dollar of the Tivoll's
prices. I am told by Mr. Leahy that
the coming serious season will be a
record breaker in enterprise. Monto
riari and Agostini, who were respon
sible for almost every pleasurable rec
ollection of the late Italian season at
the California, are engaged to appear
in "Manon Lescaut," the two "Bo
hemes" CPuccini's and Leoncavallo's),
and several other new operas that are
now being arranged for.
Although the Bostonians have ex
perienced anything but pecuniary
slights in the last two weeks, there has
been a general complaint from the peo
ple who have filled the Baldwin at
every performance of "The Serenade"
that that opera is a long fall short of
"Robin Hood." So the good-natured
Bostonians will revive "Robin Hood"
to-morrow night; and the long line of
ticket-Beekers that has strung from the
box office since the opening of the seat
sale definitely settles the commercial
fortun-es of this revival. And it is not
too optimistic, I think. In view of every
previous performance of the work by
these singers, to anticipate the artistic
success as well. "Robin Hood" was
built for the Bostonians, and it has
fitted them closer than their cuticle,
defying changes in the cast and' that
familiarity of tune which so often
breeds oblivion. Its popularity as a
performance is unparalleled. The
bumblest organ-grinder and the nickel
tn-the-elot music box have long since
-conje to regard its choicest melodies as
unprofitable chestnuts; it would be
worth the life of a concert-singer or a
person in private life to sing "Promise
Me" or "Brown October Ale." And yet
the line lasts at the Baldwin box office,
and we will all go and be crushed
while we listen for the hundredth time
to the tunes that have grown old
young. There is an attraction in
"Robin Hood" that Is Impertinently
lasting. At the moment I have no Idea
what it really is. Perhaps I will find
out Monday night.

covers that she does not care suffi
ciently for him to become his wife.
If all this be true it will be hard on
somebody else besides Mr. Irving. As
stated in these columns several weeks
ago, an enterprising metropolitan
vaudeville manager has been advertis
ing Miss Barrymore's father, the de
bonair Maurice, as "the father-in-law
elect of a son of a British knight."
However, Barrymore comes out of his
vaudeville experience with a joke. The
men who run continuous performance
he calls the i-need-theerevery hour

George Bernard Shaw, the accom
plished play assassin of the Saturday
Review, did not receive the usual press
invitation to the premiere of Pinero's
"Trelawny of the Wells," and upon tel
ephoning to the manager was told that
"three lines of adverse criticism would
be no use to the theater." However,
Mr. Shaw attended the second night,

When Modjeska opened a fortnight's
season at the Fifth Avenue Theater,
New Tork, in "Marie Stuart" most of the
critics gave their first night "prefer
ences" to Charles Frohman's produc
tion of a farce called "O Susannah!"
But William Winter of the Tribune and
Rankin Towse of the Evening Post
devoted each a column to Modjeska,
who, in their opinion, is still the great
est actress in America and one of the
greatest in the world. They note that
her temperament has been somewhat
softened by time, but .they are agreed
fhat no other actress ever has played
in the past or does play now Schil
ler's Mary Stuart with the supurb
identity that Modjeska gives the part.
One of the topics of conversation
between acts at the first night of
"Mary Stuart," says the Commercial
Advertiser, was the long acquaintance
between Mme. Modjeska and her com-
patriot, Sienkewicz, author of "Quo
Vadis." The Polish novelist paid a
visit to this country some twenty years
ago, during Avhich he wro-te several
short stories, all based oh his Amerir
can impressions. It is said that he was
interested in the celebrated Polish ac
tress, and that it was her presence in
California which drew him to the New
World, and which resulted in his
charming California tales, some of
which have been published in English.
Some of the gossips even went as far
as to point out his feelings for Mme.
Modjeska as the basic motive of his
psychological novel "Without Dogma.'*
Modjeska's two weeks' engagement at
the Fifth Avenue was in all so success
ful that she will play a return season
next month.
After two disastrous seasons as a
star Wilton Lackaye is "at leisure" for

The Rev. John Talbot Smith, a Ro
man Catholic priest, who is understood
to be, in his clerical associations, very
close to Archbishop Corrigan, has writ
ten a play entitled "The Black Cardi
nal," which is to be produced by Frank
B. Murtha shortly at a prominent New
York theater.
Of course, "The Black Cardinal" is
not the first play ever written by a
priest, but it will be particularly Inter
esting to note just now, when much
that is presented on the stage is found
offensive, even by the lay mind, exact
ly what kind of a drama meets with
the approval of the churchâ and
whether the public will take to it.
Father Smith's contribution to the
stage is a historical romance, and its
plot is founded on the struggle between
Napoleon I and Pope Pius VII, a strug
gle full of interest and teeming with
dramatic incidents. The student of his
tory will recall that Napoleon at one
time imprisoned the Pope and carried
off with him to Paris a large number
of the cardinals. Among these latter
was Cardinal Consalvi, a renowned dip
lomat, who had been Pius' secretary of
state. Later on, when the Emperor di
vorced Josephine and married Marie
Louise of Austria, thirteen of the car
dinals, headed by Consalvi, refused to
attend the wedding ceremony on the
ground that Josephine's divorce was
not valid. As a punishmr-nt for his
boldness In thus' defying the Emperor,
Consalvi was exiled to Lyons and for
bidden to wear the red robrs of nls of
fice. Hence the title of the play.

with the Booth and Barrett combina
tion. Booth was one of her first theat
rical advisers, and gave her strong en
couragement. In London she acted
with George Alexander and John Hare
before taking up the new tendency. She
succeeded in establishing an independ
ent theater in London â the New Cen
tury Theaterâ and her progress in New
York will be watched with interest, as
nearly all the. "popular" metropolitan
critics are wildly opposed to Ibsenism.
Forbes Robertson, whose Hamlet,
according to the consensus of London
criticism, is the best in the history of
modern acting, will shortly make a
tour of Germany, appearing with Mrs.
Patrick Campbell and an English com
pany in several of Shakespeare's plays.
He will carry no scenery, as the Ger
mans, who have long been reckoned
among the most enthusiastic of Shake
speareans, always keep their best
theaters well equipped for productions
of the bard. Mr. Robertson will include
Maeterlinck in his repertory, using a
translation of "Pelleas et Melisande,"
recently effected by Miss Laurence
Alma Tadema and J. W. Mackail, a
famous Latin scholar. The interest at
taching to the appearance of Mrs.
Campbell and Mr. Robertson in this
beautiful little tragedy will be consider
ably heightened by the fact that Hum
perdinck is composing the incidental
music for the production. Modern Eng
lish drama will be represented by "The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray," which Mr.
Robertson considers its masterpiece,
Mrs. Campbell playing Paula, the part
she created.
From London comes the news that
"The Cat and the Cherub," with Hol
brook "Blinn in the principal part, has
just celebrated its 100 th performance.
Mr. Fernald has nearly completed an
other play which young Blinn will pro
duce in London whenever the run of
the Chinese piece shall have come to an
end.
The relation between the actor and
the critic is at best a delicate one, and
the less social intercourse there is be
tween them the easier it is for the critic
to be fair with his readers. Miss Da
venport's recent hospitable production
of "Joan of Arc" in Boston is a good
example of the point in question. She
wanted the play judged by the best
critics in the country, and several
weeks in advance of the premiere she
sent invitations to nearly all the big
critics of the big cities. Acceptances
were numerous, and a large wing of
one of Boston's swellest hotels was re-
quired for the entertainment of the
critical guests. A midnight banquet
was given an hour after the conclusion
of the performance, and it is to be im
agined that the good cheer nearly
choked the visiting critics, for the play
had been such an out and out failure
that their telegraphic reviews had dealt
with it in no gentle terms. If such an
occasion should arise again perhaps it
would be better to make it a Dutch
treat.

play nor the intrinsic merit of the act
ing is a considerable element in the im
mediate success of the piece. It is true
that good plays succeed even at the
time; Corneille, Racine and Moliere
were usually immediately successful,
but excellence insures cmly a very mod
erate success at first. Thomas Cor
neille, the unknown brother of the fa
mous Pierre, had a greater temporary
success than his great brother. "Ari
ane" was played oftener and attracted
much larger crowds than "Les
Horaces" or "Cinna." "At the theater
the man of talent," says Sarcey. "de
feats the man of genius, although in
the course of centuries the genius and
and the man of mere talent are put in
their proper places."
What counts more than intrinsic
merit, continues the French critic, is
the conformity of the play with the
turn of mind, the sentiment and taste
of the crowd. At different times there
are different kinds of plays which are
popular. At a time when the classic
tragedy was the only form acceptable,
a poor play with that form would suc
ceed better than a good play of diver
gent form. No matter how much the
tragedy bored, respect inclined the
crowd to admiration, and they clapped
their hands by tradition.
The operetta began with master
pieces of its kind, hut when the type
once became popular anything of the
kind would succeed. Good comedies,
good vaudeville, given at that time
would not succeed. "The crowd was
like the man of whom La Bruyere
speaks who appreciated and cultivated
prunes exclusively, and prunes only of
one species. He picked them devotedly
from the tree and said, 'Taste that!
What perfume! What meat! What
taste! That is a prune, a real prune.'
'It is an operetta,' said the public, and
ran to it as to a fire." Revolutions in
public demand come, but no one knows
how.
Sarcey says that the skill of the actor
does not count as much as the adapta
tion of the actor to what the world be
lieves beforehand to be good. A come
dian who has failed for years, though
an artist, suddenly educates the crowd
to understand his quality, and when
they learn it well they applaud every
time he appears and anything which
resembles him.
"Mme. Bernhardt displayed a tender
ness, eloquence and grace and evoked
in this role of the blind, loving and suf
fering woman an- emotion, a sympathy,
which are. indescribable," says the Lon
don Times of her part In d'Annunzio's
tragedy, "La Ville Morte." The play,
however, is said to be monotonous and
morbid, with more talk than artion,
a work that reads better than it plays!
Being- without life, it seems insincere.
It sometimes shakes the nerves, but

"The most convincing line I ever read

Commenting on Barnum's circus,
which did a phenomenal business in

writes:
"One of the hardest things for the

given in the matter of admission. Lon
don audiences are so accustomed to
pay extra fees for almost everything
they see after gaining admission to the
large exhibition that they scarcely re
alize until after they have left the
building that the shilling or two shil
lings or more which they have paid for
their admission ticket and reserved

has paid for a view of everything?

Alcazar.
Says the press agent of the Alcazar
in his own English:
"Ludicrous farce after three weeks
cf immense business gives way this
wrek to a drama of the most peculiar
type. It is neither comedy, emotional,
sensational and much less melodrama
tic; yet the essence of the four faces
of the drama are blended into one
intensely interesting story, dramati
cally told. Misapprehended character,
in other words false honor and false
modesty are the singular elements
which, when produced in London and
New York, set the theater-goers of
those head centers astir and the play
'False Shame,' so wonderfully well
conceived by the great English writer,
F. A. Marshall. So important were
four of the leading roles considered
by managers that Harry Montague,
John Gilbert, Clara Morris and Fanny
Davenport were included in the cast
made up of some of the most able per
formers that have done a dramatic
turn. It is this play which has been
In active preparation for several

in its history be put on by stork at
popular prices, or even played by a
stock company, and to the Alcazar
stock company both press and public
will patiently wait to see what con
ception that clever little company will
give to the most difficult play they
have ever had assigned to them."
Morosco's.
"Saved From the Sea," a sensational
natutical melodrama of the English
persuasion, will be the production at
Morosco's.
In the first act the good ship Ocean
Waif plows the ocean main. A num
ber of melodramatic scenes occur on
deck, terminating in the blowing up of
the vessel. As the hull disappears be
neath the cruel waves the hero and he
roine are discovered battling for life,
but are rescued by ov a of the boats. In
act two there is a sensational break
away bridge scene and generous sprink
ling of comedy. Later on there is in
troduced a stone quarry, shrouded in
fog, which lifting discloses a scene in
waving corn fields.
The story of the play has been cre
ated from the strange circumstances
surrounding the case of John Lee, who,
having been condemned to death in the
British courts, had his sentence com
muted because three attempts to hang
him proved unsuccessful, the gallows
upon each occasion refusing to work.

TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS.
The first State normal school was or
ganized about twenty-five years ago In
this city, and after a short time was re
. moved to San Jose. Some years later San
Francisco re-established a normal for the
purpose of preparing for her own teach
â¢ ers the graduates from her high school,
and thus protecting the attendance at the
â¢ latter, for otherwise the graduates of the
â¢city grammar-schools would have gone
1 directly to the normal school at ban. Jose.
The San Francisco normal, then, was re
garded as a post graduate course to the
: high schools. In this way the students
were enabled to remain at home under
. parental influence, rather than board
. : away for three or four years while fitting
- themselves for their profession.
-- From time to time the San Francisco
: ' normal has passed through various peri
'â¢;â¢ ods of opposition, rising mainly through
'.misconception of its aims and work.
;â  However, in spite of this spirit the
V sell""! has steadily progressed and
proved of great benefit to the city by rais
'.â¢'â¢ ing the standard of teachers' require
ments in the department and endeavoring
- to suppress the old custom of appointing
teachers without merit, through political
influence.* -~. V.
â â 'â¢ For the past ten years the Boards of
Education have been in the habit of giv
â¢ '.- ing five or six positions to the , highest
pupils in the normal school, thus secur
â â¢'. ing the best material for the department.
, . As a rule these prize pupils have shown
..themselves hfghly successful in their
â¢ work and a credit to their training. This
-" year, however,, the custom was with
':. drawn.
. In 18S9 Mrs. Mary W. Klncaid, then act
ing as principal of the school, was elected
â¢ to the principalshlp of the Girls' High
;.â¢ School. In her stead Miss Laura T. Fow
â¢.'; ler, one of our oldest and most practical
â¢educators, was then placed in charge of
\ the Normal department. .Some four or
'â  five years ago the Normal severed its
.â¢"â connection with the High School and be
;.'â¢â¢ came independent. Since then the school
â¢ â â â  has for short, periods been under the di
rection , of Albert Voder and then of
:'. 'James. G. Kennedy, who was an able
.';'-teacher, but unfortunately died after
-.' three months' service. Later Miss Fow
â "â¢ ler became principal of' the Normal,
which position, she has ever since held.
Miss* Laura T. Fowler graduated from
'.-Packer College in Brooklyn, N. Y. She
.- ; has taught more than thirty-three years
. In the ban Francisco department, where
â  she served faithfully In all the grades,
first as a class teacher and then as in
.= spectress and principal. Miss Fowler was
one of the first women principals in the
â  city. The long list of able teachers all
. -over the State -whom she has trained and
. graduated bears witness to her thorough
â¢ methods and the earnest character of her
.' 'work.
â¢ .. Until the present year the attendance
at the San Francisco Normal was limited
â¢ . to 100 pupils, but this year it was thought
. advisable to extend the number to 125. In
speaking of the change Miss Fowler said:
â  -". "I do not agree with this decision, for I
; hold that, if any change, the school
â¢ should be limited to . a less number, be
cause better results can be obtained in
, Individual training with a smaller num
â¢ - ber of students. I think that a good work
â¢ man of any kind cannot be produced by
training in the- mass, but only by sepa
-.-rate individual work. Therefore I con
y"elder the average State Normal School
; . too large to bring- about the best results.
,'-. : . If the money for these normals could be
â  used to establish more of these schools
â¢â¢.'_ of less size the people would be better
accommodated, students better trained
. and â  the State would certainly receive
. ' a greater return for Its expenditure."
-. .The expense of the Normal is merely
â¢ nominal, for not only is there a certain
â }â¢ income from the tuition fees of High
; .School graduates from other parts of the
â¢ State, but also as a certain, part of the
school is always engaged in practical
outside -work the faculty is necessarily
email.. All the students are divided into
-."two sections, and these are sent during
â¢â  alternate months into the public schools
âof the city, where they gain practical ex
.. perience as student teachers. As a rule

Mips Fowler considers this experience of
. immense advantage and superior to all
= other : forms of training, because the
young teachers are brought face to face
â  with all phases of child life in various
..â¢â¢parts of a great city, whereas the aver

AGRICULTURE IN THE SCHOOLS.
The fact that the vast majority of pu
pils who attend the public schools must
of necessity become farmers, mechanics
merchants and ordinary "hewers of wood i
and drawers Of water" never seems to oc
cur to the boards of education who have
devised the school curriculum.
While I am in favor of an education of
the broadest kind for every man or !
woman who can obtain It, yet there are !
comparatively few who can hope to at- I
tain it. The tendency of the common I
schools is to direct the minds of the !
scholars toward literature and the pro- I
fessinns and to cause a dislike to the â¢

If agriculture and the practical side of
farming, such as the making of butter
and cheese, the maintaining of the fer
tility of the land, the different breeds and
characteristics of farm animals, and
growth of plantsâ if these subjects were
taught it would invest farm life with a
new interest and uplift the general senti
ments held in regard to it. The country

nobler conception of the vocations of

their country homes for the city. What
is needed is a text book on this subject
which wnuld fully cover the ground and
be written in unscientific language. The
agricultural papers especially should agi

upon the attention of the people. When
this is done a great benefit will follow,
which will be felt by all classes of the
community. G. 11. BENNETT.

THE SCHOOLS OF LOS ANGELES.
A recent report of the schools in the
city of I.os Angeles shows that there are
to-day fifty-seven school buildings, eleven
of which were erected rwo years ago. Al
ready, however, the school population is
so increased that ten more buildings are
deemed necessary.
Los Angeles is justly proud of its edu
cational facilities and its school system,
whose excellent maintenance is largely
due to the careful supervision of the
County Superintendent. Spurgeon V
Riley, ably assisted by City Superintend
ent Foshay.
Ten years ago the value of all the
school property in the city, not including
the State Normal School, was ohlv about
1280,000. To-day the increased value is
estimated at $1.204.7.7), and this figure does
not count in the value of all the appa
ratus and the school libraries. Besides
this there should be mentioned the largely .
increased amount paid out yearly for
salaries to the 42S teachers. The number
of children was shown by the school cen
sus last May to be 23,384.
The salary of the Superintendent of
Schools is $3000 a year, that of the deputy
superintendent $210> and that of the prin
cipal of the High School $2500. The sal
aries of the teachers range from $130 a.
month down to $45 a month paid to kin
dergarten assistants. While the salaries,
viewed by the principals, are not greater
than those paid in equally large cities in
the East, the salaries paid the Grammar
School teachers are larger.
Pupils passing through the primary and
grammar departments, which are divided '
into half-yearly classes of twenty weeks
each, are then eligible for tho high school
Graduates from the latter are admitted
Thursday night In the Alcazar Social
Hall, and there was a large number of
ladies and gentlemen who responded to
the invitations extended by Fred Raabe,

Mamie McCarthy danced an oriental
dance; Master J. Kreling favored with
negro -songs; C. Bailey gave a barytone
solo; "Hen Bolt" was sung by James Don
ohue; Sheriff R. I. Whelan amused with
comic songs, and Miss Madeline McAvoy
Bang ballads. After the programme the
guests were invited to an au joining room,
where there was a banquet awaiting
them. Dancing until a late hour fol
lowed. Supreme Representative J. W.
Rourke and other grand officers were
present.
Fred Raabe, who was chairman of the
Fred Raafec, P. G. D.
committee of arrangements, is a most
active member of the order, with which
he has been connected for seventeen years.
He has been through all the chairs of
Keystone Lodge twice, has been past
grand dictator, and is at present one of
the trustees. He is also a member of
Eagle Lodge of the Odd Fellows, a mem
to all State universities and colleges, as
the school ranks among the highest of its
kind, in the State. It was originally in
tended for 525 pupils but the number has
swelled to 1200. The structure itself,
which was built eight years ago. Is a fine
specimen of the Romanesque style of ar

county for the study and discussion of
educational problems of the day. These
meetings have been continued and are a
source of much strength to the schools.
New methods and ideas in teaching are
carefully investigated by us, and if found
worthy are heartily accepted. An or
ganization of the School Trustees of the
county has recently been effected and is
proving helpful in bringing the schools
into more prominence before the people.
In some districts, also, mothers' meet
ings are being introduced by the teachers,
thus drawing the home and school into
closer and more harmonious relation and
enabling teachers and parents to better
understand the method of treatment most
valuable to the children under their con
trol. In San Diego, Escondido, Coronado
and National City the kindergarten has
been established as a part of the public
school and is very popular there.

lucky Accident That Transformed it Into
One of the Richest and Most Beautiful
Sections of the South.
RIVETtSIDE is the youngest county
in the State, but not by any
means the least important. The
county was organized some five
years ago out of portions of San
Bernardino and San Diego coun-
ties, since which time its growth
and progress have been phenomenal, and
to-day there Is a steady building up along
all lines which augurs well for the future,
and promises to place the county in the
foremost rank, both as to population and
resources.
The area of the county is about 4,000,000
acres, but a considerable portion of this
territory is a desert waste. This desert
portion lies in the eastern end of the
county, and while of no value for agri
culture or horticulture, it is filled with
valuable mineral deposits, which are be
ing developed and which promise to make
the county as famous for fine mines as
has the western end made it by its match
less oranges and other fruit crops. It is
in the western end of the county where
are found the famous orange groves and
fine farms and orchards from which the
present revenue of the people is secured,
and which have brought the county so
prominently before the eyes of the world.
It Is in the west section that the citrus
and deciduous fruits grow In great abund
ance, and vast fields of grain are to be
found. Riverside County lays claim, and
Justly, to being the greatest orange grow
ing district in the world. Besides the
thousands of acres set out to citrus fruits
there are thousands also set to deciduous
trees, and some prize fruit of this" variety
Is grown. The last assessment report
chows that over 100.000 trees, citrus and
deciduous, -were set out during the year,
â which, on an estimate of 100 trees to the
acre, gives' the planting in that year as
1000 acres, additional, devoted to the fruit
industry. The returns of planting for
this year will not be known before, the
Assessor's report is received, which will
be several weeks yet. but those com
petent to judge put' the acreage devoted
to fruit .at 50 per cent greater than the
record of the previous year.
. The principal sections devoted to the
production of the citrus fruits are River

Th â  -.assessed valuation of the county
for the year 1897-98 was $11,275.725, of which
amount $10,414,039 was on city' and county
real estate, and the balance on personal
property and money. . This assessment
. was .somewhat lower than the previous
year, which, with reduction of the tax
rate of the previous year of 5 per cent
made the taxes collected lighter. The tax
levy for the year named was a total of
5204.265 78. . Less than $20,000 of this sum

The mineral resources of the county
hitherto practically undeveloped, have at
tracted widespread attention during the
past year. Hundreds of claims have been
located and tiled upon during that time
and numerous stamp mills have been put
up. Several cyanide plants for the re

and are now in operation. Gold, silver',

ones named being the most prominent.
The mountains are rich in mineral and
the great desert country will in time be
one vast mining camp. ,
In the matter of rairoads the county is
well supplied. There are the Santa Fe
and Southern Pacific linos, which, besides
their main lines, have feeder lines run
ning in all directions, tapping the rich
valleys and bringing the crops of the
county close to the consumer in every
instance. ...
The county is also one of irrigating
canals and they are not of the boom
kind, either, for running in them at all
times of the year are full heads of water,
which is used to make the plains to blos
som as the lose and the fields return val
uable crops.
This county also boasts of Its matchless
climate and here it is that hundreds come
each year to regain their health in the
Invigorating atmosphere, never too cold,
and with the heat of the summer tem
pered by the coast breezes, which blow
off the ocean only forty miles to the west.
The elevation of the settled portion of
the county varies, or rather ranges from
600 to 1500 feet above sea level, fogs are
seldom experienced and rains are . not
heavy and never of long duration, so that
the combination is one that commends
itself to those who seek health and pleas
ure.
The county has no public debt, but on
the other hand has a surplus in the
county treasury of $150,000. which will be
utilized the coming year very probably in
lowering the tax rate as well as the con
struction of public buildings. Good county
roads, bridges and such similar improve-
ments are owned by the county, and they
makp travel over them a pleasure.'
Besides fruit raising and mining, this
county produces quite a quantity of stock,
honey and lumber, while the granite quar
ries and lime kilns add materially both
to the industry and wealth. The popu
lation is about 17,000 and constantly grow
ing. During the past year there has been
a veritable boom in building operations,
and hundreds of homes were added to the
list in that time.
In short, there is in this county every
resource to make of it a foremost part
of the State, and everything needed to
provide thousands of families with com
fortable and profitable homes.
The past two years have witnessed a re
markable growth all over the county, and
one cannot go anywhere, almost, without
encountering neat homes and well culti
vated tracts, mostly in size ranging from
ten to forty acres each, for this is a
county of sirmll ranches and orchards.
During the present winter there has been
a large number of families who have
come in from the East, all with the in
tention of becoming permanent settlers,
and it is probable that the next census
will show the county to possess fully
25,000 population.
The city of Riverside is twenty-eight
years old, and it is a Question if one
could find anywhere a city of the same
prominence, wealth and beauty, that has
been built up in the same length of time,
or even, for that matter, in twice the
period. The success of the settlement has
doubtless had much to do with the pres
ent great standing of the southern part
of the State, for the reason that previous
to the demonstration here that this part
of the country was well suited to the
growth and perfection of the orange there
was little to induce the home-seeker to
locate. There was a good climate, of
course, but one cannot subsist on climate
alone, and there must be some profitable
industry upon which to base the founda
tion of cities and hnmÂ«s, and it was the
pioneers of Riverside that first biased
the way and showed to a waiting
people that the land of the coyote,
the horned toad and ant was of
some practical value, if only opera
tions were guided with wisdom and all
energies directed in the proper channel.
It was away back in. the 70s that a few
hardy pioneers, headed by John G. North,
Dr. Shugart and others, arrived on the
site where this city now stands, and after
an examination of the soil and facilities
for water, concluded to pitch their tents,
as it were, and begin to lay for. them
selves and families the foundation of
new homes. Water was the first requi
site to success, for it was evident at first

There i-s the prosy scientific theory of the "origin" of
masks, which nobody knows, consequently it is quite
safe to write yards on this subject. Some people have
thought that the object of the mask was, not to frighten
the cook, but to illustrate the Buddhist theory of "Met
empsychosis," which Is a fine word.
Here for instance, is & splendid one (No. 2). It Is the
mask iiKc-d by the devil dancers of Ceylon, and Is to be
particularly recommended in the case of very pious old
maiden aunts. This mask is supposed to be the" portrait
of a devil named Calloo-Coomare; he is a Ceylon devil,
and ought to be a very exciting person to meet on a
quiet, dull Sunday afternoon. It is painful to have to re

and ail his works.' T as they ought, actually worship Cal

that without water it would be impossi
ble to produce any kind of crops, so
canals were projected, and after many
discouraging trials finally completed.
Thou came a long series of experiments
In crops, In an endeavor to find out which
crop would do the best and be the most
profitable. The land, in character, was
new to these people, and they did not
understand it. They found a great .mesa
spread out before them, dry and burning
In the sun's rays, and whether it was of
any value was a Question that would
take much experimenting as well as dis
appointing delays to determine.
Where the city of Riverside and its
32,000 acres of matchless orange groves
now startd, was then a barren plain upon
which sparse sagebrush and cacti grew
with difficulty, if one was to judge from
the very stunted appearance of the
growth.
Undaunted, however, by the seemingly
Insurmountable trials and numerous fail
ures, those same sturdy pioneers stuck
by their self-appointed task and the
present Riverside, with its miles upon
miles of orange groves, acre upon acre
of verdant alfalfa fields, numbers of neat
and modern homes, thrifty city and well
regulated drives, and $5,000,000 worth of
property, is the result of their pioneer
efforts and intelligent work in the few
years since the first house was built.
Several crops were tried by the earlier
settlers, and no success came until some
one hit upon the fact that this was the
true home of the orange, and that the
tree and fruit could and would grow
here In such a manner as to make its
cultivation not only a pleasure, but a
profit as .well. At first a few trees were
set out as ornaments, and these â  soon
showed that there was more In the busi
ness of growing oranges for profit hero
than the use of the trees for ornamental
purposes, and from that time dated the
upward progress and success of River
side.
Not only did Riverside demonstrate to
the world that here was the place to '
grow good oranges, but here it was that
the world-famous Washington navel, or
seedless orange, was first grown In this
country, and to-day the crop of this
variety sent to the market is in the neigh
borhood of 2000 carloads annually.
From the time that it was shown that
the orange could be profitably grown the
settlement took on a healthy growth, and
so it has continued until now there Is a
settlement of 8000 people, with the num
ber increasing at a very rapid rate, es
pecially in the last year or so.
The name Riverside is coupled with that
of high grade oranges, so that either
words stands, in fact, for the name of
the place, and will continue to stand to
gether, for while other sections are pro
ducing good fruit none have as yet sur
passed the mother colony. Riverside Is
now and has always been the banner sec
tion for producing oranges. The ship
ments last year were 2500 carloads and
this season the shipments will reach the
4000 carload mark to a cartalnty, with a
probability that this figure wiil be passed.
Fully one-third of the orange crop
grown in the State this year will be sent
to market from here. The value of this
crop will reach considerably beyond |2,
000,000.
The orange crop is not the only pro
duction for which the settlement or col
ony is famed, for there is a large pro
duction of lemons, as well as berries of
all kinds. Then there is the deciduous
fruit, which is also Quite a product,
though not considered to any great ex
tent as a regular business.
It is upon the orange that the city
stakes its reputation, and to show the
excellence of the fruit grown, it may be
stated that a.t the New Orleans World's
Fair the three gold medals for citrus
fruit 3 were awarded to Riverside growers
in competition with the world. Again at
the late World's Fair, held at Chicago,
Riverside was awarded the first prize for
the finest county citrus exhibit, and in
the California State citrus fairs of sev
eral seasons past this city has captured
about all the first prizes, both for in
dividual and county exhibits, thus demon
strating the undoubted fact that her
fruits lead. Â»

Riverside City is the county seat of
Riverside County, it is forty-five miles in
a northeast direction from the Pacific
Ocean, and is about sixty miles east of
Los Angeles, and can be reached on either
the Southern Pacific or Santa Fe rail
roads from that city, or the East. The
city has a fine and sightly location on
the banks of the Santa Ana River, and
the site chosen is one of great natural
beauty, as well as being well adapted to
the location of what the city in time will
prove to beâ one of large size. The found
ers of the city who laid it out wisely
chose a site that would accommodate
their plans for a city of homes. In 1883
the then quite good-sized town was in
corporated as a city, having at the time
a population of about 2500, and an as
sessed valuation of $1,000,000. The city
trebled its population in the next ten
years, and the assessed valuation was in
creased in the same period to over $6,000,
000. In 1593 the city was made the county
seat of the new county of Riverside.
A recent writer in a pamphlet gotten
out by the local Chamber of Commerce
aptly hits the mark when he states there
are few. if any. more beautiful cities of
its size in the world.
Though the public buildings and private
residences are of superior construction,
it Is not to them that Riverside owes her
prominence. Rather is it her miles of
beautiful avenues and streets, tree-lined
and flower-bordered and sprinkled daily so
as to make. 'driving a pleasure, that have
secured for Riverside the reputation of
being one of the most charming cities of
the Pacific Coast. â¢
Besides its ninny attractions as a place
of sojourn for Visitors and as a home for
the resident. Riverside is a business cen
ter of distribution and supply for a large
and fertile back country, Âr.e that is rap
idly filling up with population.
Riverside as a city is possessed of push
and enterprise and it is not alone the pri
vate individual who has contributed to
the growth and beauty, for the dtiaens as
well as the officers of the city, have unit
ed in public enterprises which place the
city in the front rank as a modern one.
There is probably no city of its size in

for instance is supposed to lepresent a lish. The rude,
untutored savage has engraved a pattern on it inlaid it
with white enamel. Aspinal's for preference, and dec
orated it With cassowary feathers. It is made of tortoise

anybody, from fathers downward, at fifty paces The
same may be said of No. 3. This is also of tortoise shell,
tem has just been put in at a cost of $100,
000. Miles upon miles of streets are lighted
and the system also supplies about 4000 in
candescent lights to private parties, while
power Is sold to several mills and manu
facturing establishments. The city has
one of the most complete sanitary sewer
systems to be found anywhere, and all
the business portion as well as a large
share of the residence part of the place is
witin the sewer district.
The domestic water supply is a very
complete as well as ample one. The water
is artesian, and is brought from near
Mound City, fourteen miles distant, in a
large underground pipe system. The wa
ter is under heavy pressure and no purer
supply is to be found in the State. The
system has a capacity sufficient to meet
the wants of the city for a great many
years to come.
A couple of years ago the city authori
ties submitted the question of issuing
$150,000 worth of bonds to improve the
streets to a vote of the people, and the
money was voted by a large majority.
With these funds ths Trustees have
paved and macadamized several miles of
streets. All the main business streets
have been asphalted and the main drives,
among them the famous Magnolia ave
nue, have "been macadamized. Miles of
curbing and sidewalk work has also add
ed to the beauty of the city.
The magnificent water system of the
water company from which the water for
irrigation is taken is probably the great
est attraction the city has, however, for
the man who contemplates investing. This
system, with its inexhaustible supply of
water, has nearly fifty miles of main can
als and fully 200 miles of distributing
laterals and pipe lines.
The average amount of water run in
the canals is not far from 4000 miners'
inches. In addition to this system there
is the Gage canal system, which supplies
water to the Arlington Heights and
Highgrove tracts. These are. the newer
settled tracts of land east of the old part
of the city, and comprise 12.000 acres of
land, and the system has an inexhaust
ible water supply.
In the past year there have been seven
new packing houses built at a cost of
$25,000, which brings the total of that class
of houses up to eighteen in the city, all of
which are busy at the present time In
handling the orange crop.
During the year just closed there has
been building improvements, including the
above packing houses, put up in the city
amounting in value to fully a hundred
thousand dollars, and the good work is ;
still on, for the Southern Pacific Com- ,
pany has just laid the foundation for a ;
$6000 passenger depot, and the first work :
on the foundation of the new Hotel Glen
wood, which is to cost $100,000, and to be
one of the finest hostelries in the State,
has been done and the contracts. for fur
ther work on the buildinjr will be opened
shortly. Other notable as well as costly !
improvements made this season have been
the new line of track laid by the Southern
Pacific Company In the suburbs of the
city. This work cost several thousands
of 'dollars. The Santa Fe Company also
expended, considerable good money in im
provements. They have practically re
built their passenger and freight depots
and relaid all their track within the city
with heavier rails and ties.
As an indication of the financial stand-
Ing of the city the last year's assess

slender stems of wood and stiffened by a piece of brown

that the wearer for the timo be has it on is "taboo," and
money raised by taxes last year was $45,
64199. The bonded debt of the city is
about $125,000. The tax levy of last year
was all collected, with the exception of a
couple of hundred dollars.
The city has eight school houses, which
cost in the aggregate fully $150,000. One
of these the High School building;,
is a handsome brick structure three sto
ries high and cost about $75,000. Thirty
flve teachers are constantly employed in
the schools and something like 2000 pupils
are enjoying the advantages offered by
the schools for obtaining an education.
Riverside is proud of its schools, which
it maintains at the highest standard.
Professor P. L. Lord is principal and Miss
Eugenic Fuller is assistant, both being
educators of established ability and rec
ognized reputations. The High School has
about 200 pupils and a corps of teachers
for the various branches which are usu
ally taught in such schools. The school
provides for a four-year course in Eng
lish, Latin, history, mathematics, science-,
in short, fits the pupils for entry into the
universities of the State. During the past
few years this school has graduated a
large number of pupils, many of whom
have reflected great credit both on their
high school and city, when they entered
the university. A fully equipped kinder
garten school is also run in connection
with the public schools and its cost is
paid out of the school funds.
A ten months' term of school is main
tained each year in all the departments.
During the past year the growth or in
crease of school children has been so
great that a new schoolhouse had to be
built, and the trustees provided one at a
cost of $6000. This has four rooms, all of
which are fully occupied. This increase
of school children is one of the best evi
dences of the rapid growth of the city.
Good schools make good men and women,
and Riverside Is bound to have the best
of both, no matter what it costs. The
excellence of the school system has been
the means of inducing many a home
seeker to locate here.
There axe sixteen churches in the city,
and nearly every denomination is rep
resented. The church membership Is
about 3000 and about $150,000 Is invested in
church property. The Young Men's
Christian Association has an active so
ciety here of several hundred members
and a fine building, which cost $25,000 and
which the Â«oclety has about free of debt.
Like all well-regulated American cities
Riverside has representative lodges of
about all the leading Becret orders, and
most of them have large and active mem
berships. The Masonic fraternity is rep
resented by a big lodge and the Odd Fel
lows also have a fine big: lodge. This so
ciety also owns its own hall, which is a
substantial three-story brick structure
which cost $25,000. There are large lodges
of Knights of Pythias, Maccabees, Wood
men, Workmen, Foresters, etc., and the
various leading secret orders for women
are also represented by active lodges.
A public library containing over 8000
volumes is one of the institutions of the
city that its people point to with pride.
There is also a fine modern opera-house,
with a seating capacity of 1500. The build
ing in which it is located costÂ» between
$50,000 and $100,000 and is one of the finest
in the city.
The newspapers of the city, of which
there are three or four, are as well edited
as any that can be found anywhere in
a city of this size. They are the Daily
Press, Republican in politics and the
property of an incorporated company
(the same company conducts the Press
and Horticulturist, a weekly publication);
then there is the Daily Enterprise, Demo
cratic in politics and the property of M.
R. Plaisted. He also conducts a weekly
paper. All the publishers have type-set
ting machines, which goes to show that
they are up to date.
The hotels of the city are the Glenwood
Hollyrood and Rowell, the latter being
temporarily closed. At the present time
the hotels are full of guests. Besides the
hotels the city contains and supports sev
eral restaurants.
In the matter of railroad facilities this
city is well supplied, for it is on the main
line of the Fanta Fe from the east to San
Diego, and the Southern Pacific Company
has its hne built Into the city and is se
curing right of way for the extension â  f

There is considerable doubt, however, in our mind wheth
er similar privileges would be extended to the wearer of
such a mask in this tyrannical country.
No. 1 is what we are tempted to call a hlgh-falutm*
mask. At all events, it measures from "head to foot"
something* over five feet. We have two views of it; the
first is a full-face, the second a profile. The mask proper
consists of colored wood- the beak of a bird points down

all through trains through the city. Sev
eral trains a day run between the citY
and San Bernardino, Colton; Redlands,
I.os Angeles, San Diego and Santa Ana.
In fact, one can find a train for almost
any of the places named every hour In
the day. The city has about twenty miles
of street car lines, which at the rresent
are operated by mule power, but arrange
ments are under way to utilize electricity.
The busy season In the city is from De
cember 1 to July, when the fruit crop is
being moved east to market. During tno
months in the time named several hun
dred men find employment in the packing
houses and oranpe groves, and at the
present time this line of industry is qul.e
lively, for it takes a large number or
hanris to pick, pack and prepare for mar
ket thirty-five carloads of oranges a day.
The wages paid in this work varies con
siderably according to the expertne^s of
the operator. Pickers are paid mostly by
the box and good hands make from 51 v
to $2 50 a day. Packing is all done by the
box and the average wages of packers
who are mostly wimen, is $2 50 a day
Box making is another big branch of tne
imtlness. The makers aro paid So cent;
per hundred boxes and experts make goof
wages at that figure. Ordinary hands
around the packing houses, men who do
the loading, are paid about *2 a day.
Among the more important manufactur
ing establishments in the city are a
creamery of largo capacity, an iron foun
dry, machine works, a fertilizer works
planing mill, tannery and grist mill. Be
sides thefe. all kinds of trade are repre
sented by large establishments.
An active Chamber of Commerce is one
of the institutions of the city and since its
leorganlzatlon some months ago It has
done a great deal of good work in pre
senting the advantages of the city and
county to those who sought such informa
tion. The chamber has well appointee
rooms devoted to exhibits of the products
of the city and country, among which aro
oranges, lemons, pomelos (or grape fruit
as generally called), a great variety
of deciduous fruits, all the different ktmla
of dried fruits, grapes, honey and many
other products, every one of which Is
grown in the county. This exhibit give*
the visitor a fine Idea of tha magnificent
lesources of the county, showing how di
versified are its products and the excel
lence of them.
Every reader of this article will bÂ« In
terested In knowing something about tha
cost of land and property in this city-
Unimproved lands sell for from 175 to
$500 an acre, according to location and
water right, for be it remembered that
water is everything here. Land without
water is of little value, and where there
is a fine level piece of land with ample
water supply the buyer will have to put
up close to the highest figure above
named. Lower lands, which are not so
suitable for citrus crops, range far lower
in price, but the best is the cheapest, if
one contemplates growing oranges or
lemons. Growing orchards sell from $500)
to $3000 an acre. The choicest come high,
but are cheapest In the end. Toung and
unbearing orchards can be bought quite
reasonable, but there is a loss of time
before they bear, which means that in
terest costs bring up the price in the
end. A good bearing grove in a good
frostless locality can be bought for $1500
an acre, and It is cheap at that price,
when it is remembered that such or
chards produce valuable crops each year.
The visitor to this city is not met at
every turn with unsightly kept, places or
streets. Every one. including the authori
ties, vies with each other in keeping hi*
premises in the neatest condition possible..
and this is one of the conditions which
has brought many a settler here. The
streets are hand swept every day, and
all gardens and orchard lands are kept

the resident, as well as the visitor, can

Riverside has two banks, which take
care of the funds of the people. These
have a paid-up capital of over $200,000.
and deposits amount to over $1,000,000. A
well equipped fire department keeps the
insurance rates at a low standard, and
a paid police department, under charge
of a City Marshal, looks after the peace.
The city is one of the sixth class and
is governed by a board of five Trustees,
a City Clerk. Marshal, Treasurer, Re
corder. Attorney and Health Officer. The
Trustees are E. F. Kingman (president),
J. A. Simms. Bradford Morse, S. La Rue
and H. W. Bordwell. The other officers
are Marshal F. P. Wilson, Clerk W. W.
Phelps, Recorder J. C. Chambers, Attor
ney W. A. Purington, Treasurer M. S.
Bowman and Health Officer Dr. W. S.
Ruby. There are no saloons In the city
and none are allowed to do business, &â 
a prohibition ordinance governs.
Arlington Heights, which is the prin
cipal suburb of the city, contains 6000
acres of watered lands, which He between
the upper canal of the Riverside Water
Company and the foothills. Of this area
about half has been planted to oranges
and lemons. The water for this tract is
obtained from the Gage canal system
mentioned above. This water supply is
obtained partly from the Santa Ana River
and partly from a remarkable system of
artesian "wells. Through the center of
Arlington Heights for a distance of six
miles runs Victoria avenue, that beautl
fri cl'-'i-e w^'ch for a lone distance paral
lels Magnolia avenue. What the latter
is to Hiverside city proper Victoria ave
nue is to Arlington Heights. The groves
on this tract are all young, but no finer
can be found anywhere, and the English
company which improved the tract has
sold a considerable amount of it, and the
purchasers have built fine residences,
which, dotted here and there among the
vast field of trees, give the tract a beau
tiful appearance.

mail steamer Walla Walla is also be
hind time. The Santa Cruz is loaded
with coal and general merchandise, and
the chances are that Captain Olsen,
finding his vessel unable to make any
headway, hove her to under whatever
little canvas she could carry and waited
for the storm to blow itself out. She
has no passengers on board, and. has
been used as a freight boat between
here and the Sound since the rush to
Dyea and Skaguay began.
The storms wViich have raged in Alas
kan waters have thrown the schedule
of the Pacific Coast Steamship Compa
ny into great disorder. The vessels
have been all delayed by stress of
weather, and until a new time table can
be arranged they will leave as follows:
The Walla Wala, sailing from San
Francisco March 2, will connect at Se
attle with the Queen, leaving on the
sth. and the Al-Ki on the 7th. The
Umatilla, leaving here on the 7th. will
connect with the Victorian, leaving Se
attle on the 10th, the Cottage City on
the 11th and the Australia on the 14th.
After those trips the vessels will run on
a new schedule which is now being pre
pared.
Oscar Speight, the well-known trans
fer man at the ferries, is in mourning
for the loss of his pet Scotch terrier.
Oscar was sick for a couple of days
last week, and left his pet In care of
the man in charge of the turn- table at
the foot of Market street. While the
animal was playing around with him it
got in the way of one of the cars and
had its hind feet cut off. Officer Dowd
and two- or three others who are always
around the ferries tried to save the ani
mal's life, but when mortification set in
they put a rope around the dog's neck,
tied a stone to the rope and threw it
overboard. When Oscar returned to
work all that was left of his pet was
the collar.

CLARKE WINS A BIG SUIT.
Judge Hebbard Gives Judgment
Against the Heirs of D. M.
Reavis for a Fortune.
Judge J. C. B. Hebbard rendered Judg
ment on Friday for $125,165 65 in favor of
C. W. Clarke against Ann E., J. J., M. A.
and D. M. Reavis and Frederick Holt,
administrator of the estate of Nellie B.
Holt. An additional judgment of $23,
288 25 was given on a number of promis
sory notes, together with interest. The
action In which the Judgment was given
was Instigated June 8, 1896, and Involved
the right to certain insurance policies on
the life of D. M. Reavis, who died In
May, 1887. In August of the same year
Clarke collected $35,000, the amount of
three policies, and paid to D. M. Reavis
Jr. $2500, to which he was entitled. As
the elder Reavis in life had many busi
ness dealings with Clarke he became in
debted to him in the Bum of $75,000. For
security for this fortune advanced Reavis
assigned to Clarke the insurance poli
cies mentioned and advanced notes for
the balance. By September, 18S7, the $75,
000 indebtedness had grown to $81,703 32
and owing to subsequent amounts ad
vanced Reavis and his wife made a new
note to cover the entire amount of their
Indebtedness to Clarke. Subsequently
the amount of the indebtedness grew to
the amount of the judgment and suit
was brought to compel its payment and
Judge Hebbard held that the claim of
the plaintiff was a Just one and ordered
that Judgment be entered as prayed for.
Judge Davis Will Try the Case.
Judge E. A. Davis of the Superior
Court of Tuba and Sutter counties will
hear the case of the Evening Post Pub
lishing Company against the Associated
Press on March 12. Judge Davis, on ap
plication of the litigants, was appointed
by Governor Budd to hear the case, and
he will hold court in this city.
LIKE A DUMB, DRIVEN BRUTE.
An Italian's Mode of Disciplining a Disobedi
ent Daughter.
The arrest of Theresa Servent and her appearance before the Insanity
Commissioners yesterday has brought out a pitiful story of a girl's suffering
and a father's brutality.
Theresa Servent Is not Insane. It doesn't take an Insanity Commission to
decide that. She has been discharged from the Receiving Hospital, where
she had been detained, for there is not a trace of brain sickness about her.
11l bodily she has been and still Is. And that illness had robbed her of
appetite and made her disinclined to talk.
There's a woman who lives next door to the Servents out at North Beach
who has all the tender forbearance, all the merciful sympathy of an
Apache. She watched sorrowful, black-eyed Theresa grow more and more
listless daily. The girl was like a dumb animal In her suffering. She longed
only to creep away, to be let alone. It occurred to the woman, who spent
most of her time at the Servents' house, that it would be an exquisite joke
to tease and torment Theresa. So shÂ« prodded and pricked and goaded the
sick girl. Why didn't she talk? Why didn't she eat? Why wasn't she like
other girls? " 'it's a nice sister you've got,' she said to me,'* Theresa's
brother remarked, indignantly, "and the room was full o' people. 'She can't
talk; she can't eat. Better send her to Napa. She crazy.' "
Every taunt, every prick of crude Italian ridicule made the girl draw
more closely Into herself. Her mother was dead; her father under the In
fluence of the family's evil genius. If Theresa had been reticent, sad, timid
before, she became utterly mute now. Her head and her heart ached. An
animal would have seen her misery, and at least permitted her to suffer in
silence. But to this Italian woman the sport of persecution had become
precious. If Theresa stirred under the lash of her tormentor's vicious^
tongue It was an encouraging sign that blood had been drawn. If the girl
crouched in dumb misery, striving to be deaf and blind to the presence of the
unfeeling Italian shrew all the more necessity for perseverance.
For months Theresa endured this petty torture, her mental skin pierced
with numberless tiny, poisonous darts. She was too sick, too humble, too
forlorn to rebel. But the other morning, when Signora Rose blithely recom
menced the attack, started again playing on the delightful string of this sick
girl's tortured nerves, Theresa turned in desperation upon her tormentor,
as a suffering animal will at last expend all its feeble energy in a last pro
test against being disturbed in Its agony. Theresa fell upon Signora Rose,
the bane of the Servent household., and beat her. Long disuse and a natural
timid Ignorance had deprived Theresa of woman's natural weapon, the
tongue, and In this extremity she used her fist like a man. Here's to
Theresa!
But Theresa had to reckon now with Servent; Servent, the brutal
father, who had ingeniously manufactured a whip of wire, which hung in
threatening significance prominently before the pretty dark eyes of this 19
year-old daughter, to flog whom the instrument of torture had been In
vented. Servent, who had demanded and received every penny of this poor
child's labor during the summer months when the canneries were open;
swallowing in his capacious paternal pocket the ten or twelve dollars a week
Theresa earned, and never buying for her a single article of clothing, never
permitting her the luxury of a dime of pocket money out of her own.
"She have one pair of shoes the father bought." says Theresa's brother.
"The res' her clothes she have when she come from Italy, one year now."
Servent was infuriated. You will observe that fathers whose consciences
are least active as to paternal responsibility are the greatest authorities on
the filial respect a daughter owes the author of her being.
Servent himself works from time to time as odd jobs present themselves;
but he has all the Italian's complacent optimism as to the present and the
future.
After the canneries were closed Servent had found a place as maid for
Theresa. But the girl was too ill to work, and besides she was in sensitive,
pitiful fear that her ignorance of the art of cooking would be discovered.
Her own incapacity frightened her more than the thought of hÂ«r father's
wire whip. She came back home and Servent. trebly infuriated at her sick
ness, her long, dumb forbearance and her sudden revealing of a spark of his
own temper; above all by her failure to add to the family's revenue â decided
to be done with her.
On Thursday at noon a wagon drove up to the Servents' door. Into it
Theresa was bundled. She did not object. She is as humble, as amenable,
as timid as a frightened lamb. They told her that they were taking her to
the doctor's. So they drove along and presently alighted. Theresa Servent
was put into a cell with a tiny window and left alone. This girl cannot
speak a word of English. She waited and submitted in helpless, ignorant
docility to being detained. Just once, though, during the long afternoon,
she spoke a word in Italian to a woman there, whose language she had
recognized as her own. asking that her brother be sent for. Then she
subsided into mute, patient waiting.
At half past six in the evening, Angelo Servent, his day's hard work
over, arrived. He saw his sister.
" 'Where am I?' she says to me. 'What is this place? Where is the
doctor?' " Young Servent told the story yesterday.
"It is a prison, I tell her, and that her father he say she crazy.
" 'Oh, what a father I got!' she say. She cry likeâ like anything. She
say she die if she stay there all night, and I say she no stay there the
night."
Nor did she. The people at the Receiving Hospital permitted Theresa to
go to her brother's home for the night, and together they appeared be
fore the Commissioners Friday morning, when the girl was discharged.
Theresa Servent sits listening while her brother tejls of their father's as
tounding cruelty. Occasionally she answers a question in her soft Italian,
but as a rule she sits wth drooping shoulders and lowered eyes. She's
ashamed, miserably ashamed. Her lips have a sorrowful droop and her
eyes the pleading gentleness of a dog's begging for sympathy, or the next
best thingâ to be let alone.
Angelo Servent. the brother. Is in a passion of resentment; his broken
English being all too inadequate to express his rage.
"If she go back to the father," he says, "she no more my sister. She
stay with me. If she can workâ she crazy to go to workâ all right. If she
no can, it take no more for two to eat than for one. I no more respect
for father like that; put girl In crazy house 'cause she seeck, n' 'cause
that bad woman she joshâ joshâ Josh all the time, no give girl a rest. An'
that girl she 'frai>i, so 'fraid my father she shake when she see him."
So Angelo Serv.-nt, senior, has disciplined his daughter clear out of his
world. She was ill. a nuisance, no longer a provider, no longer a source
of revenue. The Indkins stone the sick and bury the old alive. I've even
heard that those among them who were hopelessly ailing begged that their
agony might be shortened, asking themselves to be buried, knowing that
their time had come. But I never h< .ml of a stoic, civilized or barbarian,
who craved a mad-house; nor ever before of a father who chose Napa as
a solution for the dilemma of a sick daughter who could not work.
Theresa Servent has worked since she was a child of 6. After her own
mother died she worked about the house and the farm near Genoa as a
grown woman might. At 16 she was sent from home to toil for strangers.
And since she has come to America she has earned many a dollar. It no
more occurs to this Italian girl to shirk work than if does to a patient,
mild-eyed beast of burden to revolt against its two-footed master.
Theresa Servent will go to work again, when time and immunity from
worry and a little medical treatment shall restore her health. And in this
will lie Servent's greatest punishment. For of the good American dollars
this thrifty, patient, humble worker will earn, not one will ever again find
its way into the pocket of the brutal, passionate, despotic Italian peasant
Uer father. MIRIAM MICHELSON.
A CLEAR CASE
AGAINST HIM
The Mint Employe Who Stole
Gold in the Toils of
the Law.
He Abstracted Some of the Waste
and Melted It for Sale to Gro
cers and to Jewelers.
William M. Clarkson. the disgraced
Mint employe, was taken before United
States Commissioner Heacock on Friday
morning. Me was represented by Thomas
D. Riordan. The Commissioner fixed the
bonds of the prisoner at $5000 and named
March 2 as the date for the preliminary
examination. Clarkson was then taken
back to the County Jail.
Clarkson still continues to asseverate
his innocence. His denials are coupled
with innuendoes that the detectives and
the witnesses have conspired against him,
but the detectives say that they have evi
dence outside of that sufficient to con
vince any intelligent jury.
The complaint against Clarkson charges
that while an employe of the Mint in the
rolling department he was entrusted with
$70 of gold bullion, which he embezzled
and appropriated to his own use.
No complaints have been made against

Grocer Martin Eggers, who informed the
authorities that he received nuggets from
Clarkson, or against William D. Carter
a blacksmith at 304 Golden Gate avenue,
in whose forge Carter says that Clarkson
melted some of the stolen gold.
The case was first taken up by Nick
Harris about a year ago, at that "time a
Secret Service United States Treasury
agent. The Mint officials had discovered
th;H more than the average amount of
waste was reported in the Mint opera
tions and the conclusion was inevitable
that some one was stealing the gold The
employes were watched, but nothing de
veloped save the fact that the wastage
account had increased from the normal
quantity to about $1200 above normal dur
ing the past year and a half.
Too Much Opium.
Joseph Brown, an "opium fiend," was
convicted of vagrancy by Judge Conlan
yesterday, and the Judge sentenced him
to six months in the House of Correc
tion. Brown pleaded not to be sent there,
as he could get all the opium he wanted
there, and he wanted to break himself
from the habit. The Judge postponed
sentence till to-morrow, and meantime
will see Sheriff Whelan in regard to
Brown's assertion.
Will Not Leave Her Alone.
Levi P. Gordon, ex-policeman, is again
in trouble, and a warrant is out for his
arrest on the charge of disturbing the
peace. The complaining witness is his
divorced wife. He has been persistently
annoying her., and Friday night he called
at a house on Post and Larkin streets,
where she was stopping, and raised such
a row that he was thrown out, and yes

The newly organized Tailors' Union,
which is known as local No. 2 of the
Journeymen Tailors' Union of North
America, is determined to bring about a
better state of things in the tailoring line
if possible, and proposes to do this mainly
through the introduction of the union
label.
E. S. Christophersen. who organized
this union was present at the Friday
meeting of the Labor Council, and in a
short address to its members made some
assertions which startled the members.
"If many of you could see the places
where your clothing is made," he said,
"you would think twice before wearing
it, and in speaking of this I refer not only
to the ready-maae goods, but the prod
ucts of some of the best custom tailors In
the city. In organizing this new union
it was my duty to ferret out all the tailor
shops in this city, and many of them arÂ»
the vilest of dens. After climbing two or
three (lights of stairs I would never doubt
that I was in the vicinity of one of these
sweatshopsâ the odor makes this evident
at a distance of 100 feet in any directionâ
but the buildings are as a rule so dark

A gentleman, whose business is a constant strain upon
his nerves, relates that one night recently he was unable
to sleep. On previous occasions he had observed a bene-
fit arising from the use of Ripans Tabules. On this
particular occasion, believing that heroic, measures were
necessary, he took three. The result was really surpris-
ing. The effect was as quieting as though the medicine
had contained a narcotic, which every one knows it does
not. There was an immediate feeling of ease, rest and
quiet, extending in a few minutes over the entire system,
and sleep came as naturally as to a child.

Institute to-morrow evening, when a
number of paintings and sketches by .
J. Greenbaum will be placed on exhibi

the regular spring exhibition, and have
individual displays by local artists from
time to time until next fall, when the
big exhibition will be held. Mr. Green
baum has placed 132 paintings, sketches,
studies and drawings in the spacious gal

EXPLANATION.
The arrow fties with the wind. The top flg
cres :u Etatlon indicate maximum temperature
for the days: those underneath it, if any. the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow In inches
and hundredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, e*jual
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coiist. When
the pressure is high in the interloy and low
along the coast, and the isobars intend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a '"'hirh" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and th^ pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
tn summer and colder weather in winter The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

As for the sharp falling of the bonds, a
rise in the money rate is naturally coinci
dent with a fall in governments. .For another
thing, the banks which became depositories
for the Union Pacific payment to the Govern
ment had to give the Government bonds as
security, and the demand thus created made,
retcrd prices for the bonds. Now the Gov
ernment is withdrawing its deposits ' and re
issuing the bonds to the banks, thus making
them available in the market.

' owing to short- supplies' of Merinos in the
hands of English manufacturers; .A fair quan
tity was sold above the JaM "rates. : A disin

sheepskins and a quantity was Fold. The ar-
I rivals to date for the next" series aggregate

CHICAGO, Feb. r 26.â For a few moments
after the start wheat compared with the weak
ness â¢ it " developed later, waÂ» fairly steady.
July started %c .-lower to ' %c, higher at from
89^c to 89V4C and .May &p . lower at $1 03.
Letter's brokers appeared to have- some sup
porting orders in July 'at the start, and for
this reason 1 that month showed steadiness when
May weakened badly. Trading in May was
very slight. There were a good many more
selling orders than the limited demand could
take care of, the result being a decline to
$1 Ol'/i. The continued Increasing production
of contract wheat by , the mixers apparently
affected M~ay. Liverpool was from %d to :%d
lower, and crop reports from California -and
India, especially â  from the latter country, 'we're
very favorable. The weakness which developed
in May soon was reflected in July. There was
a good deal of selling out by people who have
been â 'tailing" on the Letter campaign, , and
who had become discouraged by the recent
downward turn to the market and prices, In
spite of the Letter support, declined steadily.
At around 88VÂ»c for July the market hesitated
for a time. A period of dullness and .narrow
fluctuations set in, but about half an hour
from the close developed fresh weakness.
Under - renewed selling of . longs/ July getting
down to BS%c, â ' and May, which had - rallied
to- $1 02, declining â¢to $1 01'%. Shortly : before
the close Letter's brokers again gave the mar
ket ' Borne- support, this time In May. the buy-
Ing of a ; line of about 100,000 bushels being
sufficient to cause a rally In : that opUoii â¢ to
$102%, which, was the closing price. . This
rally also, influenced July to a limited extent,
stopping the selling pressure,- and starting a
little covering, under > which the ; price \ got
back to 8554Â©86H C Â» where It closed. .

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK", Feb. 26.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:
The stock markets here were again better
to-day, but still unsettled. Americans were
bought lens confidently to-day. Money rates
have hardened on the further fall in New
York ekchange and the continued demand for
gold, which raised the price of bars to
77s 9\d.
Two Stock Exchange failures were an
nounced to-day. â  owing to operations In
Grand Trunks and Western Australian mines.
It Is rumored that the Chinese loan will be
brought out here by England. This Is Im
portant, If true, because It means a lock-up of
money earlier than If an outside bank did It.
I also hear a report that the Gre<Â»k . loan
guaranteed by the powers may be a 24 per
cent loan and issued at about 98, but I cannot
confirm this.

THE PENSION FRAUDS.
The question of pension fraud* con
tinues to attract the attention of the
prt-Ba, but there is not much evidence
t>iat Congressmen are greatly disturbed
ovei the matter. That certain upyjli
cants for pensions are worried, how
ever, was shown last week by the com
munication which the Weekly publish
ed from a "brave defender of the na
tion,", whose sixty days' exertions as a
guard at a railroad junction in Mary
land made him deaf. The other
clay the World gave a list of cases in
which disbarment and other penalties
had been inflicted on pension- attorneys.
They show how these pension sharks
work. Some of them-rob the pensioner
of most of hia pension,, relying some
times for the silence of the latter or) the
frauds of which they have been joint
ly guilty. Others have forged signa
tures to applications and the names of
officials; manufactured false affidavits;
blackmailed dishanest pensioners, ob
tained pensions for unmarried women
on the allegation that they w%re sol
diers' widows ; collected money on
vouchers for soldiers who were dead;
and connived with examiners at false
ratings. These are characteristic
crimes of some of the men who have
done most to make it necessary to ap
propriate this year $140,000,000 for pen
sions. The New York Sun began print
ing the list of pensioners a few days
ago. Within a day it was discovered,
by neighbors of an old soldier who was
dead, his wife being also dead, that
seme one was still collecting his pen
sion. Could there be better evidence of
the advantage of publishing these lists?

Rejane having captivated Berlin with
"Madame Sans-Gene," the Germans
have discovered that Marshal Lefebre's
wife was a German, daughter of the
Wurtemberg Sergeant Danzel, and
born at Honenasperg. Lefebre married
her when he was a mercenary at Stutt
gart. ____^___^__

MAY IMITATE
OUR SYSTEM
American High School a
Model for Eng
land.
Professor Brown Traces the
History of Secondary
Education.
Adverse Criticism by a University
â¢ PedÂ«goÂ£rue on Present Methods
of Teaching Literature.*
In a lecture at Berkeley yesterday
morning to a class of active and pros
pective teachers, Professor Elmer E.
Broxvn ventured to forecast the de
velopment of secondary schools ln Eng
land. "Our poor mother country," he
l": said, "has not yet risen to the idea of
the American high school, that Is a
high school for each county, because ln
the past England has achieved such
success with her town and city sec
ondary schools; but It ls more or less
â  probable that England will follow iv
our footsteps."
Continuing his historical study of
eecondary education Professor Brown
traced the transition from the old
grammar school to the academy and
college. The movement was discussed
in the educational history of Mary
land. The extending of State aid to
colleges, and the rise of the university
idea, toward the close of the last cen
tury, marked a great change. For
the first quarter of the present cen
tury, the greater part of this State aid
â¢Was given to the academies rather than
to the colleges. All the while a de
mand was growing Tor the pushing of
education still lower; this was the rirst
Indication of a demand for State sup
ported primary education. This was
riot fully realized, however, until many
.years later.
; In Massachusetts a system of State
pispvisjon for academies began before
the old grammar schools had disap
peared and continued until after the
of the modern high
. schools. This temporary development,
from a system approximately similar
: to. the present system of public sup
:port; to a system of private initiative
dpnstitutes an exception to the general
! course of development which has pre
vailed in this country, from private
Initiative to public support.
The speaker summarized the his
tory of State aid to secondary educa
tion in the colonial times by s-tating
.that only six of the original thirteen
; Btates^-Xew York, Georgia, Virginia,
.. Maryland, Massachusetts and Pennsyl
vaniaâ gave such support.
.'VMr. T. L. Heaton dwelt upon the ne
cessity of making a change in the
present method of teaching literature
In the schools. "The best method of
studying a play of Shakespeare's, for
j example," he said, "would be to take
â  the. children to see it played. ThÂ«=r> n
â  ; close critical study of the play should
â ;be- made and after this is completed
the class should see it played again. I
have been able on several occasions to
test this method by taking a class to
see a play acted by good actors, ana
! the results have been most gratifying.
If this plan la impracticable the teacher
:Bhould: Bhould first read the play, which is a
matter of no little difficulty. After a
.. bareful critical study, parts should then
. be assigned to the pupils, and the play
: ih.ould be reread. The study of the play
should be preceded by a brief outline
by the teacher and a few question*
aimed rather to arouse interest than
to-, obtain information. Too much
Jtttehtion is paid in the high schools to
diagraming and parsing, to analyzing
figures of speech and trying to discover
just why Shakespeare did thus and so.
?uch a method is entirely wrong. The
imagination of the child should be ap
pealed to, for literature appeals di
rectly to the imagination. At present
m our schools we are appealing too
much to the eye, or rather too little to
the ear. The nature study as at pres
ent carried on in the schools, while it
educates the eye, neglects the ear."
CANADIAN PACIFIC
CASTS THE GANTLET
Gives Notification That To-
Day It Will Start Cutting
Local Rates.
ThÂ» Matter One of Retaliation Thai
Is Likely to In-volve All
trie Roads.
Tha war of rates which has been in j
â¢xistence for several days in the territory '
of the three northern lines has at last .
reached this city, and no doubt will soon ]
Involve the Southern Pacific as well as
the other lines.
Thursday the Canadian Pacific an- j
nounced that commencing on Saturday ;
they would make a $40 rate from San |
Francisco to New York, via Victoria, !
first-class, and $30 second-class. This rate â¢
1b $2 lower on first-class tickets than the
fare to New York, via Portland, over ;
the O. R. and N. and Northern Pacific, >
and $39 lower first-class and $37 50 lower
second-class than the rates In vogue over
the Canadian Pacific before the com- j
mencement of the war.
M. M. Stern, general agent of the Can- j
adlan Pacific in this city, said that at the ;
Inception of the war the Canadian Pacific '
made a rate of $40 and $30 on through tray- i
el from Eastern points to its Puget Sound j
terminals. This cut was met by the two i
other northern lin-js, and it was under- I
Btood that San Francisco was not to be j
Interfered with, but the war was to be i
confined to the territory further north.
The Canadian Pacific, while refusing to
advertise a cut rate from this city, learn- I
ed that the other lines were constantly j
breaking their tacit agreement and sell- !
Ing tickets on through travel from tliis
city to eastern points on the reduced \
schedule pertaining on the northern ]
lines. As remonstrance proved of no avail,
it was finally decided to take the present I
step in the way of retaliation and cut
everything all along the line. The $40 and
$30 rates, which will go into operation to- j
morrow, will carry trafnc from here to
Victoria by the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's vessels, where connection will ;
be made with the Canadian Pacific.
Vice-President Stubbs of the Southern !
Pacific absolutely declined to express any ]
opinion on the probable action that will j
be taken by his company, as the meeting
of the managers of the various trafnc as
sociations which was to be held in Chi
cago was postponed till yesterday, and on
the result of that conference depends the
ultimate action of the road. lie did say,
however, that he understood that the

FOUGHT TWO
EX-CONVICTS
William Madden and
Joseph Nablet, Alias
Joulet, Arrested.
They Attempted to Brain Po
liceman Barnes With an
Iron Bar.
Suspected of Being Implicated in
Recent Burglaries in the
Western Addition.
Owing to the numerous burglaries ln
the Western Addition the policemen ln
that district have been receiving spe
cial Instructions to keep a sharp look
out for any suspicious characters and
to arrest them unless they could give
a satisfactory account of themselves.
About ten days ago Policemen Mul
cahey and Burkholder arrested Andy
Johnson in the early hours of the.
morning, and when searched a murder
ous looking weapon was found ln his
possession. It consisted of a solid
piece of Iron about five inches long
and two Inches in circumference, and
was bound with leather. Attached to
It was a leather handle and a blow
from the weapon would have crushed
In a man's skull. He was convicted
of carrying a concealed weapon and
ls now serving six months in the Coun
ty Jail.
About 4 o'clock yesterday morning
Policeman Barnes saw two men acting
in a suspicious manner In the vicinity
of Jackson and Devisadero streets. As
he approached them they began to
walk rapidly away in the opposite di
rection. Barnes called upon them to
stop and one of them wheeled round
and threw a piece of iron bar at him.
Barnes saw the missile coming and
dodged in time to save himself from
being felled to the ground.
Barnes drew his revolver and threat
ened to shoot if they did not stop.
This had the desired effect upon them
and they decided to come to a halt.
Barnes covered them and managed to
put the handcuffs on them. "When
searched a "jimmy" was found In one's
pocket and several skeleton keys in
the other's. They were sent to the
City Prison In the patrol wagon and
were put on the "small book" pending
further investigation.
They gave their names as William
Madden and Joseph Nablet. They were
recognized yesterday by several de
tectives as ex-convicts. Nablet's true
name Js Joulet, and he is considered
a most dangerous crook. The men
will be detained untjl it can be seen if
some of the people whose houses have
been enterd by burgiars by the- use of
a "Jimmy" can identify them. If not
they will be charged. with having burg
lars' tools in their possession. â¢
The police believe that Madden and
Joulet are the two men who broke
twice into the residence of Mrs. Han
r-ock, 1836 Turk street, two or three
weeks ago and carried off a large quan
tity of silverware and other articles of
value. :
LAW AND JUSTICE.
The Supreme Court Releases Mrs.
Long and Her Daughter.
The Justices of the Supreme- Court yes
terday gave a decision in a case of habeas
corpus by which they combined both law
and justice. Some time ago Mrs. S. C.
Long and her daughter, who reside In
Riverside, were indicted by the Grand
Jury, the charge being perjury. When
the case went to trial the defendants en
tered a demurrer by which they showed
that the indictment was faulty "and con
sequently inoperative. This was sus
tained by the Judge of the Superior
Court, but the latter put his foot into a
muss by directing the prisoners to be re
turned to the custody of the Sheriff, to
await the action of the next Grand Jury.
The Judge did give them the privilege of
depositing $200 bonds each, which they
were unable to give. The hardship this
order worked upon the accused will be
understood when It is known that the
next Grand Jury will not meet until some
time next fall, and ther<> was nothing for
the two women to do under the order but
to stay in Jail for many months.
Through their attorney they made ap
plication to the Supreme Court for a writ
of habeas corpus, and the Justices, on
learning the facts, immediately directed
the Sheriff to release the prisoners. Hpto
arose another difficulty, for the women
had been brought to this city, and they
were without means of getting back to
their home. The Sheriff was desirous of
having the order of discharge made out
at once, but those in the court, knowing
the helpless condition of the women, told
him that the order would be mailed to
him, and he was thus obliged to take the
women back to their home.
WALLER DID NOT PLEAD.
Argument on the Accused School Di
rector's Demurrer Will Be Heard
Next Saturday.
School Director Samuel L. Waller did
not plead yesterday to the Indictment
charging him with having offered to ac
cept a bribe from Eli T. Sheppard on the
understanding that in return he would
appoint the latter's daughter to a posi
tion in the School Department. .When the
case was called in Judge Cook's court
Attorney Peter F. Durihe, who represents
the accused, moved the court to dismiss
the indictment on the ground that it was
illegal. The point raised on which the
motion was based was that the Indict
ment was Illegal for the , reason that
Grand Jurors A. F. Price and A. W.
Spear, who are not on the assessment
roll, were prvsent when the lndfcment
was found. "Under the statute," said
Mr. Dunne, "the participation of any per
son other than the lawful Jurors and the
District Attorney in the finding of the in
dictment is fatal to the validity of the
proceeding." Judge Cpolf said that Judge
Belcher had already decided that Price
and Spear were lawful members of the
Grand Jury, and in consequence he would
overrule the motion. Dunne then took
another technical tack and .filed a gen
eral demurrer to the indictment, alleging
that it did not state an indictable offense,
and that its terms were not sufficient to
warrant a trial. A continuance was
granted until next Saturday at this point
and on that day argument on the de
murrer will.be heard. .
TO STIMULATE INDUSTRY.
A Representative of the Proposed
Business League in This City.
Charles Truax, the accredited repre
sentative of the National Business
League, an organization called into ex
istence immediately after the last politi
cal campaign by a number of merchants
of Chicago for the purpose of instituting
a department of commerce and industry
at Washington arrived in the city yes
terday on a mission from the headquar
ters of the league, for the purpose of se
lecting three desirable business men to
represent the proposed department In this
city.
The main object of the organization is
to effect the revision of the interstate
commerce law so as to furnish better
protection to shippers and prevent dis
crimination; the opening of commerce
with the South and Central American
States and Mexico and the forming of
plans for better communication, including
Improved waterways between the East

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The Mining Fair Sends
Investors Through
the State.
Montana Company to Dredge
the Trinity on a Large
Scale This Year.
The value to the raining Industry of
the Mining Fair, which now enters on
its last week, cannot be measured by the
casual visitor. It cannot be measured
even by the mining men directly con
cerned In it and most familiar with it.
But its value will be great, and it will
repay manyfold the time and money In
vested by enterprising citizens of mining
counties, business men and others Inter
ested in the prosperity of the mining in
dustry.
Its benefits cannot be directly traced
any more than can the benefits of any
sort of advertising. When a man buys
a bottle of pain killer In a drugstore the
enterprising manufacturers of it who
have proclaimed its name and virtues
will never know what advertisement
caused the buy-ei* to call for that brand.
The. man may have remembered it from
boyhood. It is ho with the special efforts
that Southern California and other agri
cultural sections have made to draw
homeseekers from the East. Population
and property increase, but not many
new homes and orchards could be pointed
out as the result of this pamphlet or that
exhibition or excursion. The benefits of
the Mining Fair will be similarly lost In
the growing mining boom which the fair
is doing a great deal to accelerate. Hun
dreds of Californlans have acquired a
new and more intelligent Interest in min
ing, and v.ill be more ready to join the
thousands all over the State who are
putting little or large sums of money
Into mining ventures. Many will most
readily turn to the counties that have im
pressed them with attractive exhibits of
their riches.
A few specific Illustrations can be
easily found, however. One can hear at
the fair of two men from Scotland who,
after examining the ores in the Placer
County exhibit and making some In
quiries, boarded the train a week ago for
a trip, to Placer County. Last week an
Eastern man became much interested in
some samples, of iron ore from Shasta
County, hunted up the man in charge of
them and started un a quiet trip to
Shasta County. Some samples of slate in
the Calaveras County exhibit have result
ed in G. W. B. McCarty giving a bond
on a slate proposition near Copperopolis.
"There is no question about the benefit
of our exhibit," s-vs H. \V. H. Penniman,
who is in charge of the Calaveras County
display; "but it Is hard to point It out.
Every day men study over the ores and
ask questions, but do not tell their names
or intentions. A great many nave quietly
noted- the names of mines, their location
owners from the cards on the sample* of
ores, evidently with an intention to in
vestigate them; but when a man is look-
Ing for a mine he doesn't sa.y much about
It 7 '
That is the way with all ihe county
exhibits, each of which is supplemented
with attractive and conservative descrip
tive pamphlets and each of which has
surely attracted the particular interest of
many individual mining investors. One
machinery firm has sold several engines
of a particular style through having them
on exhibition. But the bulk of the bene
fits of the enterprise will be lost to defi
nite view. They will be felt like the
sunshine. -
John C. Jens, the well-known mining
engineer and president of the Pacific
Mineral Development Company, left this
city on Saturday, the 19th inst., for Bel
fast, Ireland, and London on business
connected with thÂ« company, tie will be ,
absent about two months, and then he
will devote his time to the extension on ;
an extensive scale of mines In Caiaveras
County.
Last spring William McKay, car ac- |
countant of the Southern Pacific Com- I
pany, at Fourth and Townsend streets, i
and Charles E. Snook, District Attorney ;
of Alarrieda County, grubstaked three
prospectors In Arizona. These parties
made three locations in Yuma County.
about 38 miles from Yuma, In which ]
McKay and Sno.ik had a half Interest.
Recently McKay and Snook bought the
Interests of two of the prospectors, and
started C. J. Clark to work developing
one of the claims. A few days ago they
received, an average sample of ore from
a three-foot ledge, and had it assayed by
Thomas Price &. Son, anfl It assayed I
$111 68 per ton gold and a percentage in
stiver. The other two claims are equally j
promising. This is a sample of how many
San Francisco business and professional
men are going Into mining these days.
The owners of the Rellofontaine mine
at Grass Valley axe negotiating for the
purchase of the ten-stamp mill of the
Federal Loan and contemplate moving '
it to the former mine.
A new pump, built in Chicagro, having
a capacity of 70) gallons a minute at a
depth of ir.oo feet, has arrived at the Al
lison Ranch mine. Nevada County.
The following from the Trinity Journal
is one of the many indications of an ex
tensive development of river dredging in
this State in the near future: "C. C. Oil
man of lowa and Q. McNeil, president of
the Montana Dredging Company, who
have been examining the river at Low
den Ranch with a view to putting in a
dredger, left Sunday. The gentlemen
were thoroughly satisfied with the result
of their examination and will put In a
J.WMH) plant this spring. They will put in
a dredging machine near Poker Bar. The.
first installment of machinery will arrive
next week. This will be the first time the
river has been thoroughly worked by
modern methods and we predict that the
operations will be successful and that the
coming season will see this method of
mining conducted on a large scale. The
opportunities are better here than in any
part of the State."
The following from the Trinity Journal
concerns one of the great number of Cali
rornia mines that are being slowly devel
oped on small capital: "M. A. Brady, one
of the owners of the Lappin mine at
Dead wood, was in town this week and In-
Â£ or . ms u , s that that property is looking
better than ever. The arrastra recently
purchased by the company has been thor
oughly repaired and is now running with
a capacity of one and a quarter tons a
aay. it is the intention of the company
to ma Ke the development of the mine pay

of ban I- ranclseo, who has been driving

14f5 feet a deposit of native copper was
struck, though the main ledge had not

phides carrying gold and silver, as well
as copper, were reached. The ore to re
ported to be of the same character as
that of the Iron Mountain, and the de
posit is extensive. This development adds
another to the promises that copper
mines and smelters as extensive as the
Iron Mountain enterprise will before long
be added to Shasta County's Industries.
J. P. Hitchcock and F. E. Hudson have
struck It rich in the Electric Light, near
Simoni's, two miles south of Shasta,
wnich they lately leased from Harry
Hill. They went in 30 feet to secure drain
age and then ran a 30-foot crosscut on
the ledge. The vein is three feet wide,
and the average assay is $100. One assay
goes $193. Lowest assay, taken out in the
dark and containing much wall rock,
went over $19. They have over fifteen tons
of high grade ore on the dump. â Shasta

The Martposa Gazette hears that the
Compromise mine of Marlposa has been
bonded- by a representative of John W.
Mackay.
. Hoisting machinery has been placed at
the end of the 1200-foot tunnel at the Am

days.
Petitions have been filed in the Circuit

A new ten-stamp mill has gone to the
Slate Range, ninety miles from Mojave ;
and forty miles from Randsburg, for the
Meredith mine. The mine sbows a ledge
seven feet in thickness, and part of it is
rich, all paying for milling.
Holbrook & Hunt, who have recently
worked the tailings at the Belden mine !
by cyanide process at a profit, have mov- j
ed to the Tierakoff mine, near the West !
Point bridge, owned by Mrs. A. B. Mar- i
chand. where they will continue in the
same profitable work. The cyanide pro
cess is comparatively new to Amador
County, and the above mentioned good
results obtained therefrom should be an
inducement to mining men to investi
gate.âAmador Republican.
A company of San Francisco capitalists
composed of M. Blaskower, J. Drosseur,
H. L. Coook. A. Heynemann, L. Levison
and others have formed the Consolidated
Oden Mining Company with a capital
stock of $1. 310,000, to work the drift min
ing property near Grass Valley. It. is
proposed to sink an inclined shaft.
Harlow Kimball and others, who have
been prospecting a gravel claim near the |
Magnolia mine, a short distance from
Goodyear's Bar, recently struck some
very rich gravel. We are Informed that
from ninety-two carloads of dirt $1050 was
realized, over sll a load.â DownievilleMes-
The machinery at the Alice mine has
been sold and will be shipped to Mexico.
After considerable experimenting it has
been found that this machinery is iin
sulted to the reduction of the rich but
refractory Alice ore, which must be
tnated by the cyanide process.âRiver

The Empire, in sinking below the 2200
level, has come into very good ore. This
property has been a producer since IS;>7,
and its product is not diminishing with
age. There are forty stamps in opera
tion The Orleans, adjoining the Empire,
is running a drift, which has reached 360
feet for the Rich Hill ledge on the 800
level Three eight-hour shifts, air com
pressor and electric power are pushing
the work. The property comprises eighty
three acres. At the Golden Treasure, a
property on which after years of Idleness
work was recently resumed, the shaft has
been unwatered and crosscutting both
ways is going rapidly forward. The old
tunnel has also been cleaned and is being
driven on the ledge.â Transcript.
The work of construction now on the
new line of railroad from Daggett to the
borax mines, twenty-six miles away, is
being pushed rapidly. The borax works
are shipping forty tons per day and the
road is a necessity. A thlrty-two-mule
train is at present hauling the product of
the mines to the railroad.
Since the new underground machinery
was installed at the Providence mine,
Nevada County, the work of sinking the
shaft from the 1800-foot level has been
going merily on. At a depth of 1930 feet
a level has been cut and drifts will be
run both ways on the ledge, which, by
the way, is large and of good quality.
The shaft is about twenty-six feet below
this level, and will be continued until the
2000-foot level is reached.
In the first twenty-seven days after
starting the Burleigh drills in the tunnel
of the big Eureka drift mine above Forest
Hill, Placer County, Felix Chappellet Jr.,
with his double shift of men drove 205
feet of tunnel. The greater part of the
distance was ordinary slate rock and the
balance in very hard rock. The tunnel
was in 2355 feet at last accounts.
F. J. Esler is a firm believer in the
bright future of the Virginia Dale Dis
trict. He came in last evening, and with
him came two little gold slugs. The most
notable one contained SllO. It represented
with $40 one week's work with a dry wash
er. Ike Reed was the man who did it.
He. had a placer claim at Dale and an old
dry washer. He shoveled his own dirt,
turned his own crank and cleaned up $150
in seven days. The ground covered in
the time was 15x20 feet of surface, the
dirt being only one foot deep to bed rock.
And Reed has a whole lot more just such
ground and there are lots of others yet
undiscovered.â San Bernardino Times-

WHIST.
WHIST AS PLAYED BY EXPERTS.
We have been asked from time to time to
publish a few of the systems of whist play
that are used by some of the leading clubs of
the American Whist League. If we should at
tempt or undertake to publish them all. it
would tax our space beyond the limit for many
months to come. No whist team of any num- I
ber of players can ever do themselves or their |
club Justice wltnout they thoroughly under- j
stand cne another in every particular, and In
every play they make beyond the possibility
Of a doubt from the time they lay the first
card on a table until the last.
We are pleased to give our readers this week
the system used by the great Albany Club
team of Albany, X. T. This team has made a j
record second to none in this country, and we j
take pleasure in saying the captain of this ;
team was one of the original founders of and
one of the old guard of the American Whist
League.â E. Le Roy Smith.
ALBANY WHIST TEAM SYSTLM
THE ACE LEAD.
The ace Is led from the lollowing combina
tions:
A., K. and three or more others.
A., Q., J. and others.
A. and five or more others with a sure card
of re-entry.
Note.â With ace and five or six small and no
re-entry card, lead the fourth best.
THE KING LEAD.
The king is led from all the combinations
given In the Trist system of American leads.
THE QUEEN LEAD.
The queen is led from the usual combina
tions given In the tables of Amercan leads,
except the queen, jack, ten. (From this com
bination the ten is led.)
THE JACK LEAD.
The Jack Is led from all the combinations
given in the Trist system of American leads.
THE TEN LEAD.
The ten i^ led from the queen, Jack, ten com
bination onlyâ four or more In suit. (Note â
From king. Jack, ten and others lead fourth
best.)
WITH HONOR TURNED.
Governed by the holding, any irregular open
ing lead Is a positive "call" through the.
honor turned.
THE DISCARD.
The Drayson system of discarding as found
In the "Art of Practical Whist." fifth edition.
CALLING FOR TRUMPS.
Always "call for trumps" with five or more
unless developments show It unwise before
! "call" Is completed. If completed partner
1 must lead them unless fourth player has also
j "called."
; ORIGINAL LEAD HOLDING FIVE OR
MORE TRUMPS.
Always lead trump If there is not an honor
turned â reserving the right to stop after one
round. (Noteâ This, calling for and leading
trumps from the above holdings has been,
rigidly enforced for ten years and found to be
; trick-winning.)
THE TRUMP ECHO.
On the lead of ace. queen or jack led orig
inally, or at any time when it Is believed to
j be from strength from above combinations,
echo holding three exactly. On the lead of a
1 email trump, echo holding four or more.
An echo in plain suit, with any trump led,
1 says at least four.
The Albany team has followed thts line of
trump leading and "calling" rigidly for ten
j years against all styles of play, and the team
' is unanimous In the firm belief that at least
| five tricks are gained by this system when
three are lost.
The captain of this celebrated team says In
i a personal letter to our whist editor: "We
i play the old-fashioned Trist. Cavendish, Pole,
j Drayson game. We don't, believe in "top of
nothing,' 'common sense,' 'Invitation,' 'Foster'
or 'Howeir leads. In all of our recent matches,
as well as from close observation for the past
ten years In playing with and against all
; styles and systems of play, I believe the win
. ning game is the rigid hard-and-fast number-
I showing leads, with no false card plays or at
tachments."
THE GREAT ALBANY-ST. PAUL MATCH.
It ts well to state here that one of the great
est whist matches that ever took place was
between the St. Paul team, with the great
John H. Brlggs as captain, and the Albanys
at the midwinter meeting at Detroit, Mich., in
February last. Up to the present writing these
two teams have no superior â If an etjual. For
the benefit of our readers who are students of
the game we intend in a few weeks to give
several illustrated deals, with the play of
every card, as it took place In this match after
the defeat of the St. Paul team.
Captain John H. Brlgga la writing to
the Minneapolis Times on the St. 1 aul-
Albany match Â»ays: "An examina
tion of the records shows that both Albany
and St. Paul made the same, opening leads in
thirty-five of the forty-eight deals. In four
deals the same suits were opened, but with
different cards. In only nine deals were the
opening leads from different suits. Neither
6ide gained any advantage by the different
opening leads. Conventionally the games of
Albany and St Paul differ very little. Albany
leads the ten and St. Paul the queen from
queen, Jack, ten suit. From king, jack, ten
suit Albany leads fourth best, while St. Paul
leads ten. St. Paul often leads the "top ef
nothing.' while Albany leads the fourth beat.
In trumps, Albany echoes with three trumps
upon the lead of an ace, queen or jack. St.
Paul occasionally does the same. Albany al
ways calls when holding five trumps, a play
which St. Paul players think in the long run
result disastrously. The ftlay cost Albany
nothing and gained very little for them. Al
bany called on the first lead, with this hold
ing, trumps, nine, eight, seven, six, three:
long suit, five cards to the- Jack. They use tha
high card callâ the eight or a higher card.
After trumps were out I noticed that Albany
echoed In an opponent's suit on two occasions,
when they had only two small cards of tha
suit. Apparently the piay Is an echo declar
ing no more of that suit. With the exception
of a few more minor points, the games of both
teams are the same.
"Now, as Albany did not gain by a different
line of opening leads, nor by a different sys
tem. It must follow that they played a bet
ter game than their opponents. While I think
that Albany was more favored by fortune
than was St. Paul, the result was not dic
tated by It. Albany won because It played
a steady game. I think that I can do no one
an injustice when I say the St. Paul players
'limuled out' many a trick. Deal six. In addi
tion to other features, was favored with a re
voke by St. Paul."
