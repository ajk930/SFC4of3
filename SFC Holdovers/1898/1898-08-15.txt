VOLUME LXXXIV.-NO 76.
CABINET PONDERS
OVER DISPOSITION
OF PHILIPPINES
Its Action Will Depend Upon the
Reports From Merritt and
Dewey.
Belief That the People of Cuba Soon Will
Request Annexation to the United
States.
â¢ â  â¢ WASHINGTON, Aug. 14.-The White
; Bouse, War Department and Navy De
partment t -day resumed their usual
.Sunday quiet, a condition which has
'not prevailed since the Maine was
â¢blown up in Ha\ ana harbor on Feb
" ruary 15.
The President believes that the most
â¢ serious problem which the peace com
mission will be called upon to deal with
is that of the F;-lipp<â Before the
commission assembles, it is hoped, the
: affairs of Cuba and Porto Rico will be
found in such process of adjustment as
:to lea little for the commission to
consider under that head. The abso
. lute relinquish- lent by Spain of all sov
ereignty over the islands in the West
Indies will cave only the property
â¢questions to be settledâ that is, what
: Spain shall take and what shall remain
captures of war.
â  The greater questions growing out
'of the war as relating to Cuba and
â¢ Porto Rico will have to be dealt with
by the United States alone. The fact
.that the Philippines will present the
difficult problem in the peace negotia
tions has caused the administration to
â give it a great deal of careful attention.
â '".-. Several suggestions have been made
as to what shall be done, one being the
'.; retention of the bay, city and harbor
..of Manila, just what the protocol gives
temporarily. Another is that Subig Bay
; 'and sufficient territory for a naval and
.- coaling station be secured and the
bujlding up of an American city at
that place begun. Still another idea
â which is bein<" conisdered is the reten
. tjon of the island of Luzon, the ad
â¢ vocates of that plan believing that
' there would be trouble between the
" governments which occupied a portion
.of the island with a line of demarca
tion such as would exist in case Manila
â¢and the bay. only were retained: T"!"*
'â¢'island of Luzon is " the largest of the
group arid contains about 3,000,000 peo
ple,, who are said to be the better class
in the Philippines.
..-.' It is believed that the administra
" tion and the commission will be greatly
] influenced by the reports which Ad
miral Dewey and General Merrltt will
make on the subject. Their reports are
expected before the commission meets.
The final determination as to the gov
" ernment of Porto Rico and the settle
ment of the government of Cuba are
.' problems for settlement, but the im
pression prevails that these islands will
' become quite rapidly Americanized and
â¢ every encouragement for them to do so
.-.â  will he given. Porto Rico will be under
" military control for the present. Cuba
.. also will be similarly governed, but it is
' " probable that American reforms in the
â " matter of government will be such that
'.. the people of Cuba will see the advan
.; tage of becoming annexed to the United
â¢â¢; States. It is thought that the sanitary
â¢'. improvement of Havana and other
.'cities, the management of the munici
": palities and liberty offered the coun
:â¢ "try's people will be of such a character
v as" soon to convince the people that the
: . changed conditions are for their good.
.â¢â¢ There has been little doubt about soon
.... settling ttfe transfer of Porto Rico,
'> ..which will be treated at once as an
. American possession.
\. ' No more troops will be sent to Gen
â¢ eral Merritt unless he asks for them.
â â  .- It is believed at the War Department
.that the 16,000 men now there are suf
".- -ficient to garrison Manila and the
:'â  ground which the United States will oc
: -cupy for the present.
â¢.' All of the troops that were with Gen
eral Shafter in the Sanitago campaign
'/'will be out of Cuba by Friday of this
Vrweek. General Shafter will accom
pany them to Montauk Point. There
â¢ will remain at Santiago five regiments
'â¢' of lmmunes to do garrison duty. It is
'.. -yet possible that a battery will be sent
:' -to Santiago to take the place of the bat
â . teries which are to be removed. Gen-
: eral Miles has about 15,000 men in Porto
"Rico. They will be sufficient for the
â¢ "occupation of the island and perhaps
/â¢more than needed after the Spanish
.' -evacuate. The remainder of the troops
'-:' will remain in the various camps to
â }' whic'i they have been assigned for the
â  â¢' present, though some-thing may be done
:/ looking toward diminishing the num
".- \Jjer when it becomes apparent that they
"..lire no longer needed.
â  ; ' The Government will dispose of the
.. " transports that have been in use as fast
â â ''. as they can be released and are no
.:â  â  longer required for service. All yes
â¢ ' sels of the navy that can be spared
:= from service in the West Indies will be
.â  ordered to ports in the States, where
, the men will be given brief holidays.
'â¢â â¢.'.The big battleships of the fleet will be
v .put in the drydock as Boon us possible
â¢ . and undergo such repairs as may be
.. -necessary. â  There is Bcarcely a vessel of
.'â -'â¢the navy that does not need repairing.
' -It is expected that the large dock in the
â : â '. New York yard will be ready to receive
the ships in about two weeks.
' ' The auxiliary vessels of the navy
which will not be used for the per
:. manent navy will be disposed of as soon
as they go out of commission probably
.; 'being sold at auction.

American General, if he desires to
avoid further shading of blood, to re
main where he is."
This was the reply of the Spanish
commander Colonel Nuevlllus, to Gen
eral Wilson's demand for the surren
der of Aibonito, made last night. A
fight is certain to occur unless orders
to prevent are sent from Washington.
ITALY'S CONGRATULATIONS.
First Nation to Felicitate America on
the Return of Peace.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14.â The United
States Government to-day received the
first congratulation from a foreign
power regarding the termination of the
war. The congratulations came from
Italy, through the Italian Minister,
Baron Fava. He communicated an ex
pression of congratulation on the sign
ing of the preliminaries of peace to
gether with the wish of the Italian
Government, that after the war, con
ducted with such conspicuous gallantry
by the United States, this country
might enjoy the benefits of peace. Em
i bassador Fava in presenting the views
of his Government expressed the hope
â¢ that the-"- would be communicated as
i soon as possible to the President.

HOSTILITIES AT AN END.
Governors of Cuba and Porto Bico
Carry Out Peace Instructions.
MADRID, Aug. 14.â The Governors
General of Cuba an*l Porto Rico have
acknowledged the receipt of the news
of the suspension of hostilities between
the United States ;tnd Spain, and an
nounced the carrying out of the orders.
MADRID PRESS MOURNS.
Dissatisfied With the Terms of the
Peace Protocol.
MADRID, Aug. 14.â El Pals to-day
prints the text of the protocol signed by
the United States and Spain with
mourning borders, and says:
"Spain without colonies is reduced
to the role of a third-rate power."
El Impartial says: "Peace will not
bring to Spain even the rest she so
much needs after three years and a
half of war."
1:1 Nacional says bitterly: If Spain
had at least been vanquished only after
; , furious and heroic struggle she could
resign herself. Peace with the United
States will only be a momentary res
pite from our misfortunes."
LONDON, Aug. 14.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
"The comments of the press on the pro
tocol are a veritable funeral hymn on
the destruction of the Spanish colonial
empire. Some days ago the desire for
peace made the people close their eyes
to the price, but now upon reading the
protocol, they realize that the cost is
the loss of that empire which Spain had
conquered with so much glory and that
Spain now falls to the second rank
among nations. The public mind is
stunned and there is general mourn
ing.
"General Blanco telegraphs that Ha
vana is greatly agitated by the news
of the signing of the protocol, and that
there is much anxiety to learn the con
ditions, which have not yet been pub
lished. Some uneasiness is felt re
garding the effect the news of the
protocol may have on the Spanish votes
in Havana. Many newspapers ex
press grief and despair that the men
â¢who brought disaster on Spain by lack
of foresight, organization and ability
should continue to govern the country."

MADRID, Aug. 14.â Reports

tacks were roade by the in
surgents at varioos points.
During the engagement fif
teen Spaniards were Killed.
The American commander
gave the authorities three
hours in which to capitulate.

A scene on the main street of Sampaloc, the suburban residence of most of the Consuls and better class of the foreign

about Manila, and on every occasion summer afternoons, Sundays and holidays it is crowded with of
the city in the various kinds of turnouts to be seen in the Far East-English, French, German and American, the
latter predominating. An American or European horse, however, is rarely seen, the small Manila or China ponies,
which thrive well in the country, being exclusively used for draught and riding purposes.
URGE SALISBURY
TO STAND FIRM
London Editors Bitter in
Criticism.
PEOPLE CRY FOR ACTION
CITE THE UNITED STATES AS
AN EXAMPLE.
Standard Declares the Time Has
Come for the Country to Dic
tate the Course of the
Ministry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 14.â A dispatch to
the World from London says: An im
portant section of the Ministerialists is
indignant and chagrined at the con
tinued rebuff and humiliation in China.
Parliament having been prorogued, the
only means of expressing the dissatis
faction erf the supporters of the Govern
ment now is through the press. The
Standard, a semi-official Government
organ says:
"There has been too much surrender.
The time has come for the Ministers to
determine on and to carry through a
line of action which shall secure effect
ual protection to imperial interests and
prestige, it is for the country to spec
ify what that action should be. The
Government are its trustees and it Is
its duty endowed as they are with am
ple means, to see that its reputation,
its power and its commercial prospects
do not suffer disaster."
NEW YORK, Aug. 14.â A dispatch to
the Tribune from London says: Par
liament has closed with debates on
England's China policy which have
caused dismay among the Government
followers and with the appointment of
a Viceroy for India which has filled
the forward school with delight. By a
singular coincidence the same issue of
the Times which contained the report
of Mr. Balfour's speech, with halr
splitting polemics on spheres of influ
ence and the "open door" principle,
recorded M. l'a\ioff's success in veto-
Ing the Neu Chang loan in spite of
Lord Salisbury's offer to guarantee
China against the consequences of
currying out the contract.
Tin- chief function of the vigilant
China correspondent of the Ti nefl
seems to be to compel the Queen's Min
isters to reverse their statements of
diplomatic policy and to confirm his
dispatches the day after the event, as
Mr. Balfour has dune once more. There
is much dissatisfaction among the Con
servatives in Parliament over the lail
ures of British diplomacy in China and
old-fashioned Tory journals like the
Standard are outspoken in warning the
Government that clear, vigorous, reso
lute action is needed In order to avert
lasting damage to British prestige and
interests and ruin to the Unionist party.
The English people are in fact weary
unto death of empty phrase making.
They cry aloud for stirring action of
the American order. What they clearly
understand Ifl the fact that whether
the principle of the open door applies
to tariffs, spheres of action, railway
concessions, or what not, Russia in the
last six months has been acting with
masterful energy in the far east, and
by sheer audacity and bullying has dis
placed British influence.
M. Pavloff in the last instance has
torn up one English railway contract
and Mr. Balfour does not know what
will happen in the case of another rail
way concession which lies within the
British sphere of influence. Russia,
Germany and Prance are virtually co
operating against England, and small
fry states like Belgium are taking part
in the diplomatic campaign against
Meanwhile Lord Salisbury has gone
to the Continent, Mr. Balfour is pining
for golf, and Parliament has broken
up for the long vacation.
UNCLE SAM MAY HELP
OUT SPAIN WITH COIN
Likely to Pay for the Transportation
of Cervera and His Sailors to
Their Homes.
NEW YORK, Aur. 14.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President Mc-
Kinley and Acting Secretary of the Navy
Allen will consider this week the method
to be adopted for sending naval prisoners
to Spain. It is desired to send Admiral
Cervera and his men to their homes with
all practicable dispatch.
Spain will have to go to very heavy
expense to transport the army in Cuba
home, and it is possible she may not be
able to raise the money to pay for the re
turn of the prisoners at Annapolis and
Portsmouth. In this event there is reason
to believe the United States will place a
contract with a steamship line for the
transportation of Cervera and his sailors.
The cost would be about 5100.000.

BERLIN, Aug. 14â The Rome corre
spondent of the Cologne Gazette says:
The condition of the Pope no longer ad
mits of disguise. His health has
gradually gone from bad to worse and
his Holiness is now a decrepit old man,
who rarely speaks. His voice Is of the
weakest, thinking tires him and pray
ers confuse him. He has been observ
ed to commence the same prayer ten
times without noticing the repetitions.
ROME. Aug. 14.â The Pope's extreme
weakness has produced great commo
tion and excitement among the mem
bers of the Sacred College. It Is re
ported that France, Germany and Aus
tria, as being chiefly concerned in the
acession tv the Papacy, have ordered
their representatives not to leave Rome.
The Pope's physician thinks there Is
no danger if the Pope is able to pull
through the hot weather. All the mem
bers of the family of the Pope have
hurled to Rome.
His Holiness on Friday insisted on
getting up, but soon had to be carried
to bed again in a state of partial col
lapse.

AT THE FRONT WITH GENERAL
WILSON'S COLUMN, FIVE MILES
BEYOND COAMO, PORTO RICO, Aug.
12, 12 o'clock evening: (delayed in trans
mission). â General Wilson moved one
Lancaster battery out to the front this
afternoon for the purpose of shelling
the Spanish position on the crest of the
mountain at the head of the pass
through which the rorvl wind?. The en
emy occupied a position of great nat
ural strength, protected by several lines
of intrenchments and a battery of two
howitzers. The Spaniards were eag-er
for the fray, and earlier in the day had
fired upon Colonel Biddle of the Engi
neer Corps, who, with a platoon of
Troop C of New York, was reconnoiter
ing on their right flank.
As our battery rounded a curve in the
road 2000 yards away the enemy opened
an artillery and infantry fire. Four
companies of the Third Wisconsin,
which were posted on the bluffs to the
right of the road, were not permitted
to respond to the infantry fire. The
guns advanced at a gallop in the face
of a terrific fire. They were unlimbered
and were soon hurling shell and shrap
nel at the enemy at a lively rate, strik
ing the emplacements, batteries and in
trenchments with the rhythmatic reg
ularity of a triphammer. The enemy
soon abandoned one gun, but continued
to serve the other at intervals for over
an hour. They had our range, and their
shrapnel burst repeatedly over our men.
One shell burst, the fragments killing

Captain Lee and Private Slaer of
Company F were wounded by Mauser
bullets.
Captain Paget, the British army of

for the purpose of observing the opera
tions in the field, distinguished himself
by aiding Dr. Woodbury.
In about two hours the enemy aban
doned the other gun and the men be
gan to flee from the intrenchmenta
toward a banana grove in the gorge.
Our guns shelled them as they ran.
One gun was no\\i ordered to advance
to a position a quarter of a mile fur
ther on. It had just reached the new
position when Spanish infantry re
enforcements filed into the trenches and
fired down a deadly fire upon our men,
compelling the battery to retire at a
gallop. Then both the enemy's howitz
ers reopened and shrapnel screamed
and Mausers sang. Another gun gal
loped from the rear, but our ammuni
tion was exhausted.
Lieutenant Haines was shot In the
body by a Mauser Just before his gun
retired, the ball following a rib. The
orders issued for two companies to ad
vance were countermanded and the fir
ing soon ceased.
Colonel Bliss went forward to the
enemy's line with a flag of truce and
explained that peace negotiations were
almost concluded and that their posi
tion was untenable and demanded their
surrender. The Spanish have no com
munication with the outside world, but
the commander asked until to-morrow
in order that he might communicate
with Governor General Macias.
General Wilson and staff viewed to
day's action from a hill at the right of
the battery. The enemy's guns were
fired from a high elevation with low
velocity. The Spaniards had the
ranges as accurately as they had at
Santiago. Their position from the front
is almost impregnable.
Estimates of the strength of the
enemy range from 500 to 1000. Their
position is five miles from Aibonito.
MLACIAS WOULD NOT QUIT.
HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL,
WILSON AT COAMO, Aug. 13, noon
(delayed in transmission). â The orders
to advance given to General Ernst's
brigade were countermanded upon re
ceipt of the President's order to sus
pend hostilities.
General Wilson this morning sent a
party with a flag of truce to notify the
Spaniards of the suspension of hostili
ties, but the flag was not respected.
This was by order of Governor General
Macias. As General Macias has no
communication with Madrid, he may
thus cut himself off from official noti
fication of the situation, although na
tives have been sent through the Span
ish lines to spread the news that a ces
sation of hostilities has been ordered.
The soldiers of the American army
generally receive the news of peace
with delight, .. though some are dis
appointed that there is to be no further
fighting, and many officers express re
gret at the suspension of hostilities In
the midst of the campaign.

PONCE Porto Rico, Aug. 13 (even

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FREPN'O, Aug. 14.â The conflagra
tion that devastated a large area in the
packing- house district In Fresno at
midnight, wad Dot got under control
until daybreak this morning. The agf
. g;r<>gate loss i^ now variously estimated
from a conservative standpoint -it from
5300.000 to $450,080.
The buildings, together with their en
tire contents, destroyed were: The For
eyth Seeded Raisin Packing Company's
establishment, Phoenix Packing Hou?e,
Union Ice Works (partially destroyed).
National Ire Company's establishment,
Farmers 1 Warehouse, Einstein Wars
" house, Hobbs & Parsons' Warehouse
(partially destroyed) and the residence
ot John Doyle, yardmaster.
In addition to the buildings enumo-
rated, the Southern Paeinc"s loss will
be considerable. Several strings of
freight car? standing along the sides of
the packing houses and the warehouses
were ;â  mass of Barnes before the force
of railroad p.. en couid haul them away.
The freight aepot of the Southern Pa
cific was on fire several times, but a
large force of railroad men were sta
tioned, there and they managed to
save it.
Gartenlaub & Pratt of the Phoenix
Packing and Raisin Seeding Company
etate that their loss will amount to $70,
000 approximately. This piant was par
tially covered by insurance. The Ftock
alone in this packing house was valued
at $;;0,000.
Forsyth's loss is placed at $li".000.
>A Forsyth was in Santa Cruz
when his business pla^e was destroyed.
Then? was an insurance '>n the build

M. W. Muller of the Farmers' Ware
house estimates his loss at 25,000. The
grain was all insured. The insurance
n grain is low, and for that rea
son it is believed that i; was insured to
nearly its value.
The i": ; s t.i the Einstein Warehouse
will foot up to abnui the same as the
Farmers' Warehouse Company.
It is in | â¢ stimate the loss
to the ice company, but their loss will
be a very heavy one, as large quanti
ties of wood and coal wer â  consumed.
The loss of Hobbs & Parsons will be
between $30,006 and $50,000. They s-uc

The Southern Pacific's loss wil' also
be large, but even an approximati m
could not be made this morning,
ty-five or thirty tars were burn ..
of them being loaded with grain
aha raisins. A large number et ties
â¢were also destroyed and the *raok was
burned in a number of places A num-
C third-class sleepers were also re
duced to ashes.
Only the low, compact structure of
the Hiibbs <Â£ Parsons' warehouse and
the fire-proof construction of the Bur
leigh building prevented the fire from
ping the entire line of packing
houses on both Bides of the track.
The loss nt the two principal pack
ing houses of the district is a severe
blow to Fresno. It will be the means
of throwing hundreds of needy men and
women out of employment at the only
time when they usually find this class
of work in abundance. The. loss of
nearly sixty carloads of raisins in the
is warehouses and packing estab
lishments will not injure the raisin
business in this section in the least.
The canning crop will bo packed and
seeded by the remaining places.
No action has been taken thus far
toward rebuilding in the burned dis
trict.

for the express car.
The car was provided with two mes

four men had put out all lights, and met ;

returned the lire and about fifty shots
were exchanged, but no one was hit by

shooting into the group.

London Times Sees in the Outcome
the Struggle More Than the
Mere Conquering of the
Spanish Foe.
Special EHspatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 15.â The Times this
morning comments editorially upon
the universal recognition of the gener
ous part which President McKinley has
played', throughout the war between
the United States and Spain, and says:
If foreign observers might presume to
have an opinion upon his conduct, it
â  would probably be that President McKin
ley has kept his finger constantly upon
the national pulse and has known how to
stimulate and direct national thought
without too markedly outrunning its
' movement. Everything has been done in
the open, every move has been discussed
as a possibility all over the United States
before the Government was irrevocably
committed one way or the other, and the
result of the cautious, tentative policy ia
that where he stands at this moment, the
President has the whole American people
at his back. : ' ,; â 
We do not know that there can be any
higher statesmanship for a President gov
erning under the constitution of the
United States.
It is noteworthy that while tne Span
iards, who are usually regarded as chival
rous, romantic and medieval, have turned
first to the financial aspect of the situa
tion, the Americans, who are usually sup
posed to be intensely patriotic, have as
yet hardly given a thought to the finan
cial or economic side of the question.
What occupies the American people at
this moment is not the cost of the war,
not the value of their acquisitions, nor
the balance of the profit and loss account.
but the moral result of the struggle and
the nature of the ideas which U stimu
lates. â¢::' ; >v
Whether Bryanism is dead or. only sleep
ing, whether the smaller issues of party
warfare are suppressed by large and
worthy conceptions of national policy or
only thrown for the time into the back
ground, there can be no doubt that the
war has had and will have a profound
effect upon American ideas and aims. Not
only has It renovated the Idea of national
unity, impaired by the great civil strug
gle, but it has supplied that sense of con
tact With external forces which is prob
ably one of the most potent influences in
favor of maintaining the national spirit.
The Antilles themselves introduce' a
novel element into American life and open
up Questions upon which parties may
differ greatly and worthily. This in itself
is a gain, and one which was. more or loss
conscientiously sought when the war was
undertaken. The perilous unrest spoken
of by the New York Times was a real
national evil, which sprang directly, so
far as foreigners can judge, from the dis
appearance of clear, intelligent party is
sues. That unrest, we may assume, has
vanished and been replaced by new anx
ieties or solicitudes which may become
acute, but are very unlikely to become
Beyond the Antilles lies a more difficult
questionâ Philippinesâ and that gues
s or Bolicitudei which may become

syond the Antilles lies a more difficult
3tJonâ the Philippinesâ and that ques
tion docs- not end with the Philippines
themselves. These islands may be taken
just now as a symbol of American
awakening and of the entry of the re
public upon a new career which, Philip
pines or no Philippines, she is hence
forth bound to follow.
Records Broken at Gilroy.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 14.â Over the Gilroy
course to-day Hunt Smith broke two ama
teur one mile records. On the first trial,
with a flvinsr start, he broke the first
record, the time being 1:49, against 1:. > 1-5,
made by Smith some weeks ago. With
a standing start the mile was made in
2:06, the former record being 2:12 1-5, made
by Charles Franklin. The tandem record
was also broken. The flying tandem
time was the same as Smith s, beating
the former record of 1:52% of llaggerty
and Williams.
EXTRAORDINARY PLETHORA
OF GOLD AT WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14.â Here is an anomalous situation. The
war is ended, but the money provided by the sale of bonds to carry
It on has scarce begun coming into the Treasury. This means, to
begin with, that but half of the four hundred millions authorized by
Congress will ever be issued. The issue of a hundred millions of
TreaHury certificates has not been made and but a small percentage of
the money from the sale of the two hundred millions in bonds has
come to the Government, and yet the gold in the Treasury to-night
amounts in round numbers to $197,000,000, while; the cash balance is
$268, 000,000. Thus at the end o~f the war, lasting 113 days and costing
about a million and a half dollars a day, the amount of gold on hand
exceeds the high-water mark of 18!)0 by more than ton millions and is
about twenty-five millions in excess of the amount on hand at the out
break of the war.

President McKinley Finds It Diffi

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 14.â The Herald's
â Washington correspondent sends the
following: President McKinl< is not
finding the task of selecting the five
American commissioners to meet the
men to , toe apolnted by Spain an .easy
one. ' Borne of the men he .'would likl
to appoilnt are reluctant to serve. It is
realized that the disposition of the
Philippines, no matter what Is done
with them, will probably become a
leading political issue and men in politi
cal life are reluctant to make their in
dividual records bo definite on the ques
tion in advance of the great political
parties lininr up on it.
The President is finding it particular
ly difficult, I am told, to obtain Demo
cratic representation on the commis
sion. The Democratic conventions
have taken strong grounds against
holding any territory in the Philip
pines and leading Democrats are re
luctant to serve on " the . commission
where the action would be dictated by
a Republican administration and which
might put them in opposition to the de
clared policy of their party.
I understand the President is consid
ering the question of naming a military
man or a naval officer of high hank as
one of the members of the commis
sion.
NOTORIOUS GANG OF
COUNTERFEITERS CAUGHT
Secret Service Men Capture Plates
and Dies and a Quantity of
Bogus Money.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15.â Information
has been received by the Treasury Secret
Service from Detroit, Mich., of a gang of
counterfeiters whose operations have
given the Government considerable trou
ble. They are Charles, Edward and David
Johnson. Through the efforts of Detec
tive Webb, the department has secured
some of the important paraphernalia used
by them. Chief Wilkie regards the ar
rest as a most important one, as he iden
tifies the men with the issues of Han
cock and Wlndom $2 counterfeit bills,
which have been circulated freely in the
West and East during the past .eight
years. .
j\t the headquarters of 'the gang the
officials recovered [!â <â  face and back
plates from which the Hancock counter
feit-was made, and also the plates tor
making the large and small seals on these
bills. There were also .taken Ilftys2 Han
cook and 500 $5 Wihdom billsâ latter
being regarded as the best all-round coun
terfeits discovered for years.
Charles Johnson, who. is said to be at
the head of the gang, is about ' 63 years
old, and according to the statements -of
the secret service officials here, he has
spent considerable time in prison for
counterfeiting.

PINE CREEK RICH
IN VIRGIN GOLD

NEWS CAUSES A STAMPEDE
KUSH OF PROSPECTORS FROM
SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA.
Miners Employed on Discovery Claim
Take Out Sixty Dollars a Day
in Gold Nuggets to
the Man.
Special Disiatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Aug. 10 (via Seat
tle Aug. 14). â What is regarded as a
most important discovery of rich placer
diggings is reported to have been made
on Pine Creek, a small stream emptying
into Atlin Lakf, a feeder of Lake
Tagiflh. The discovery is located in the
Northwest Territory, Canada. The
news has caused a great stamped* from
Juneau and other Southeastern Alaska
points, and it is estimated that at least
1000 prospectors have started for the
location.
As reported here, the find was made
two years ago by George Miller of this
city, about the time the Klondike strike
was made. Miller allowed his discovery
to lie dormant and went to the Klon
dike. Last June he returned, and, tak
ing a few friends into his confidence,
revisited the place and staked out
claims. Walker Carter, who has just
returned from the diggings, Bays:
"I Baw four men shovel in twenty-six
ounces in two days, one pan from bed
rock containing $4. This was oh Dis
covery claim. I'ine Creek is about fif
teen miles long, and will average sev
enty-five feet in width. The current is
very rapid. The diggings are what are
known as bar diggings or summer
placers. Discovery claim is about eight
miles from the mouth of the creek.
Bedrock is only five feet from the sur
face, and is of a slate formation. Mil
ler has five men at work shoveling into
sluiceboxes, and ho pays them $12 a day
each, settling every night with dust
taken from the boxes. The men are
taking out $60 a day to the man. The
grave] shows from 20 to 150 colors.
Captain Strickland of the Canadian
mounted police and several men are al
ready on the ground, and have staked
claims for themselves and reserved the
Government claims. When I left thirty
three claims had been located, and the
balance erf the creek is reserved by the
Canadian Government.
"When I was coming out to Juneau I
met a large number of prospectors
going into every bay along Tagish Lake
trying to find the ppot which they had
heard of, but whose location they did
not know."
The news has caused great excitement
in Janeau, and every boat leaving here
is crowded with prospectors. The gold
brought in from the new diggings is
âlike thnt from the Klondike--very
course, but it is said to be worth $2 an
ounce more.
STRANGE DROWNING
OF A TACOMA MAN
William Deming Smith Mysteriously-
Lost From a Small Vessel
at Blame.
TACOMA, Aug. 14.â William Deming
Smith, manager of the Alaska Packers'
Association's Puget Bound canning in
terests, met a mysterious death at
Blame yesterday. His body was found
in the Sound under circumstances in
dicating drowning, and a Coroner's in
quest has been started to determine
the cause.
Some time ago Smith's company sold
the steamer Puritan to men who in
tended taking her to Alaska. This
agreement failed and the steamer was
anchored 150 feet off Blame dock. Yes
terday afternoon Smith hired a small
boy to row him out to the steamer to
K<-t some papers that he wanted to
transmit to San Francisco. There vas
nobody aboard the steamer. He went
aboard, and the boy, after waiting a
long time, became alarmed and started
to investigate.
On the farther side of the Puritan
was a sloop 100 feet away. A man on
the stoop knew nothing of Smith's
presence on the boat or of his
disappearance. He and the boy search
ed the Puritan, but could neither find
him nor give any evidence as to his
disappearance.
An. alarm waa given, and on the
theory that Mr. Smith had fallen over
board dragging parties were organized.
This morning his body was found. The
general impression is that death waa
due to heart trouble, and that he fell
overboard during the attack.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
OGDEN, Utah, Aug. 14.â Ogden peo
ple are very much exercised over the
workings of one J. Landos, a healer,
who is curing the lame, the halt and
the blind in a miraculous manner, and
as rapidly almost as they can be
brought before him.
Landos came to Ogden a month ago
to recuperate, and about ten days ago
allowed himself to aid a sick man, with
the result that the man arose and
walked. Since that time people have
been flocking; to his rooms, and to-day
there are many prominent and well
known people in Ogden who are mov
ing about apparently well and who
were, some of them, practically given
up by the physicians.
The wife of a prominent attorney is
one lady who was confined to her bed
for three weeks and had suffered. two
operations. Landos visited her and
after a few minutes she arose and is
apparently completely cured. Others
have had their hearing and eyesight
restored, and the whole city is talking
of the wonders.
Landos is said to have come to Og
den from Denver and Pueblo, Colorado,
and is traveling to the coast. He is
a strong, vigorous, healthy man, dark
complexioned and about ,six feet tall.
He makes no claims or pretensions of
being the Christ, and dresses and acts
like any ordinary citizen.
Strangers are coming into Ogden
daily to visit him. His treatment con
slPts simply of laying on of hands, and
his hands do not touch the body except
about the face.
MANLY
Men are seen at a glance. There is no
hesitation, no holding back, no trem-
bling limbs, no sign of weak knees.
These are men to be proud of. Men to
be admired by all. Manliness is indi-
cated in the walk and in every action
of the whole man. In the puny mortal
you may not see at a glance how weak
he is, but he knows the sad truth.
STRENGTH
For the weak "Hudyan"â that won-
drous remtdio-treatmentâ is the one
thing that sheds hope on their paths,
for "Hudyan" has made over 20,000
men out of hopeless wrecks. It reaches
every case. The boy who has had vices
may be unfit to work, but "Hundan"
sends new life and vitality into his
system. So with men.
AND VIGOR
When the improper use of any organ,
say the liverâ it makes no differ-
ence what it may â causes weakness,
the "Hudyan" treatment repairs all
the damage done. It helps stunted
growth, too. Send and ask for ab-
solutely free testimony about it. Then
ask for medicaj advice, too. All free.
Why not have it? Could not be bought
for any amount of money elsewhere.
One place in the world can you get
"Hudyan."
Those who have Mood taint in either
the tertiary, the secondary or the primary
form should ask for "30 day blood cure"
circulars. They are free, too, bear in
mind. "30 day cure" is effective always.
It leaves the system as pure as It was
whin you were born. â¢ No after effects.
Don't forget. All circulars and all ad-
vice free. â¢ â¢

}"â  1.0,S ANGELES. Aug. 14.â There has
"JJCPn a noticeable change in the sentiment
\i of the people of the south during the past
:twenty-four hours. They are not now so
-unanimously in favor of the selection of
'"â &' -Governor from this end of the State.
â  Having hud time for reflection they ad
â '.rnit the necessity of nominating a man
.atrong enough to carry a heavy vote from
San Francisco, and they fully realize that
'â¢this Can he accomplished only by the se
lection of a man -who is In close touch

MRS. DUNMNG'S LIFE
: â¢ IN SAfy FRANCISCO
THROWS NO LIGHT ON HER MY3
TERIOUS DEATH.
Evidence Goes to Show Tliat She Was
'-.' Intentionally Poisoned, but
Her Friends Know of No
Enemy.
' The death of Mrs. John P. Dunning,
formerly of San Francisco, and of her sis
t< r, .Mrs. John D. Deane, at Dover, Dela-
â¢ ware,- -from eating poisoned chocolates j
â¢â¢received by mail, supposedly from this ;
â ...city",, has caused much speculation among ;
-.â¢people who knew the Dunnings very well.
Jfor nearly two years the couple boarded !
at- the Victoria Hotel, Mrs. Dunning first
.. conning- there as a bride in Ism*. Subse- j
.qy.ea.-tiy them went housekeeping on !
J&ush street. Then Mr. Dunning, who j
â¢'.was'- connected with the Associated
"..press, v.as sent to Samoa on ;
-"a special mission a.nd his wife returned j
.temporarily to her parents' home in Dela
. ware.' where the first ohlid, a daughter, j
â¢was born. After Dunning' s return to this j
* city his wife rejoined him, and prior to '
. -.going to housekeeping a second time, they !
â¢"boaTued for one month at the Renton â¢
â¢ Hotel, on Sutter street. They then took !
â¢ â n bouse on California street, near Pierce, j
"â¢â¢ and remained there until Mr. Dunning j
' wfis- obliged to go away again on another
'-.pews gathering undertaking for the Asso
â¢â¢'crated Press, some months ago, when the
â¢â  w!fo. once more went to her father's home \
â¢-Jr. the East. It was while visiting him i
. that- she met her mysterious death. None .
â¢of th^ deceased's many friends can give j
â¢â¢any 'clew to the mysterious poisoner.
-." The statement that the wranner of the
â â /"candy-box was postmarked San Fran-!
.-.cisco, puzzles the mail authorities here. I
â¢It 'is not the custom to postmark third- !
.-â cTass mail, the stamps simply being can- â 
â  : celled."
..' .The -possibility that the candy was ac- I
'.cidÂ«ntally poisoned at the time of its
â 'â¢;m.a'nufacture is denied by local manu
" â <3Ctu"rers. Louis Saroni, one of the best
'.-â¢posted .men in this line of t'isiness, said:
'."It" is not even possible that the process
. Of 'manufacture could have poisoned the
. -'iliocolates. There Is no coloring matter
'â¢â¢"uFf'd;" or very little of it, in the
' manufacture of this kind of confection
ery.' If the coloring or dye for a fifty
, pound batch of painted candy were swal
.- To-wed by any one in its pure state, the
iiresu-lt- would be no 1 more serious than a
â  lew 'days' illness. No tin, or other cor
.' roding utensils are used in the prepara
â¢tioTi of candy for market. The accidental
â¢ â poisoning theory will not do. If the
'chocolates were poisonous It was because \
.â¢â¢'they .had been deliberately made so by i
.â some- designing person. It would be the j
easiest thins in the world to dip the !
"chocolates In a noisonous solution, and |
â . .after-allowing them to dry, to r< :oat them
v-V?ith- melted cake chocolate. Anybody
"could 'do. There are other kinds of
â¢â¢â  candy that could not be tampered with
. -In. this -way. Mary people know how to i
â¢:'maJie "chocolate creams in their own !
"kitchens. It would be the best kind of
'â¢.candy for a poisoner to utilize." " .

will be feJt goes without saying when it
becomes known that at this time Its mem
bership la over 1900 and that there is every
assurance that this number will be in
creased before the time for action arrives.
It is the ambition of its officers and
members to place the league at the very
head and front of the social Republican
clubs of San Francisco. It was brought
into existence solely in the interests of
the Republican party, and its past and
present success is due to its strict ad
herence to the first determination to keep
fcree from all factional questions and en
tanglements.

WOEFUL LACK OF PRACTICE
GOOD ANT> BAD BALL COMES
IN STREAKS.
The Game Interesting at Times but
the Poor Showing of the Friscos
Was Disappointing to the
Audience.
By Joe Corbctt.
Yesterday's game at Recreation Park
demonstrated beyond doubt that It Is im
poÃsible to size up a ball team. Last
Sunday the San Franciscos played an ex
cellent game, and left the impression that
from then on they would cut quite a
figure in the championship race. Yester
day these hopes were dissipated, fur they
played inferior ball.
It all comes from lack of practice, and
I have touched on this point bo often that
it has become aj "chestnut" even with
me.
There 1b no use talking, and thereseems
to be no use of criticizing the team, for It
ever plays the same.
To-day it does well, to-morrow It plays
poorly, and so it has been all the season.
The material is there, and if compelled to
practice it would do well, but what Is the
use of wasting- words?
Yesterday they were defeated by tnÂ»
Oaklands. the score standing at the end
of the same 7 to 3.
It was an lnU-restlng game at times,
but the poor sunport accorded Shea, who
was doing excellent work, easily marred
the beauty of the contest.
The Oaklands, In fact, outplayed and
outbattfd their opponents despite the
rather ragged umpiring of Sweeney on
balls and strikes, and In consequence
easily won the game. The score follows:

â WATSONVTLLE VS. ATHLETICS.
Sugar Beets Play TheJr First State
League Game.
WATSONVIL.LE, Aug. 14.â 1n the pres
Â©nqp of 2000 people the Watsonville Club
made Its first appearance on the diamond
here to-<3ay as a member of the State
League. Their opponents were the hard
hitting Athletics of San Francisco. Pre
vious to the commencement of the game
the Watsonville band escorted both clubs
from the hotel to the baseball park. At
the head of the two clubs, in a carriage,
were President Eugene Bert of the State
League, accompanied by his wife, and
league officials. The Watsonville Club
make 9 its initial appearance in a State
League under favorable ciTcumstances.
For many years she has maintained me
best amateur nine in the State. Now
that shÂ« is Ui the league she Intends to
maintain and support one of the
best clubs, ln said league. Financial as
sistance is more than plentiful and every
person has the craze badly. Santa Cruz
County, the smallest county in the State,
now has two good clubs in the big league.
President Bert said to-day that the large
audience present at the game was
the most pleasant and courteous he had
seen anywhere in the State. The gate
receipts were $210, and this is not unusual
here. On arrival at the park the two
clubs put up good practice work for half
an hour. The Athletics went to the bat
first and McGlaughlin was the only one
to cross the plate. Neither side scored
ag-ain until the last half of the sixth,
when Franks of the "Watsonvilles made a
long drive, which brought A. Struve in
from second. At the end of the ninth
inning the game was a tie. All through
thtso innings each nine had put up gut
Its members are young business men,
who are not politicians in the general ac
ceptance of the term, but whose sole in
terest is the welfare of the Republican
party. They are not candidates, nor are
any aspiring for political office, the ( r aim
being tne good of the party and to secure*
clean politics.
That the leaguo is true to its colors
and thoroughly alive may be inferred
from the fact that it was the first and
only Republican club to indorse and issue
to its members in the last campaign a
complete Republican ticket, and it was
one of the first to indorse the Hon. Wil
liam McKinley for President. Ever since
its organization the league has been on
edged ball, particularly Donlin of the
Watson who, as usual, covered lots
of territory in an admirable manner. The
"babies" of the league, without having
much practice and less than a week's
notice of their membership in the
State League, successfully demonstrated
to their opponents that the "Sugar
Beets" are warm members. In the first
half of the tenth inning, with one of the
Athletics out and two on second ana
third bases, "Sunburst" Kelly of the
Watsonvllles fielded a ball and threw It
to Catcher Struve to put out Riley. who
was running in from third, but instead of
â¢ going In Struvc's hands it passed about
three feet over his head. Riley scored
and was Immediately followed i by Stultz.
In the last half of the tenth the Watson
vines made a gallant effort to score, but in
vain. Score:
ATHLETICS.

THE close of the war with Spain again changes
conditions, but hardly back to where they were
before the war. In fact, they probably never will
get back there. Heretofore the United States has
been a nation aside; henceforth it will be one of the
world's group, with universal, not sectional interests,
and with a greatly broadened field of commercial ac
tivity. From this time the attention of the country
will be more or less diverted from the monotonous
fostering of local trade to the expansion and exploita
tion of a vast and continually increasing ioreign com
merce with transmarine countries. Cuba, Porto Rico
and the Philippines will be opened up to our goods
as never before, and new industries must be created
to fill these new conditions. Unless all signs fail the
United States is on the eve of remarkable commercial
expansion.
Wall street sees this, and with its traditional
shrewdness is already discounting it by resuming the
purchase of railway and other shares. The public,
which has held aloof so long, is now reappearing in
the street and taking hold. The granger stocks have
been the favorites, owing to the fine crop prospects,
which indicate large railway earnings this fall. Gov
ernment and railway bonds continue active, with a
tendency toward firmer prices. The bank clearings
do not show any particular activity in general trade,
the gain last week being 5.8 per cent over last year.
On the other hand, the smallness of failures indi
cates that business is on a safe and conservative
footing, those for the week being 157, against 214 for
the same week in 1897 and 258 in 1896.
In the extreme East there are decided indications
of an increase in business. The foreign demand for
wheat and corn is better, in spite of a small advance
in the former cereal. The iron trade, both East and
West, showed a marked improvement during the
week, with increasing activity all along the line. Cot
ton has advanced, the inquiry for woolen goods is
decidedly better, and all textile works report more
motion. The fluctuations in general merchandise are
generally toward higher prices and include advances
in oats, lard, beef, coffee, lead, rubber, copper and
cotton, besides thai in wheat already mentioned.
There have been no depreciations worthy of note.
The money markets all over the country are reported
in good condition, with an abundance of funds and
all the gold coin the country can stagger under, with
lots more to flow in from Europe during the coming
fall. No reckless speculation is visible anywhere, and
the commercial reports unite in saying that rarely has
the financial horizon been as cloudless as at present.
All this is general. It is an aggregation of con
ditions, a common average throughout the country.
Individually speaking, trade is almost featureless.
There is no boom in anything, and no single line ex
hibits any especial activity. It is what is called in the
jargon of commerce "a percentage basis." The Unit
ed States is now running along on the lines of the
ordinary merchant, who falls behind on some goods
and rtins ahead on others, but is averaging up a good
percentage of profit on the whole proposition. This
is a healthy state of trade, and is the best and safest
to win on.
Here in California the conditions are practically
the same as elsewhere. Regarded as a whole the
trade situation is without especial feature, but the
aggregated lines are averaging up well. During the
past week there have been no marked depreciations
in anything except two or three lines of canning fruit,
and this happens every year at this time and lasts only
a week or so. or during the brief period when all the
fruit in the State seems to be ripening at once. An
almost unprecedented hot wave rested over the State
for some days, but although the thermometer ranged
from ioo to 115 and even higher in the interior val
leys no serious damage to fruit or anything else was
reported. As far as the leading items of produce are
concerned; wheat shows a small gain for the week;
the other cereals are dull and not materially changed,
hides are quoted rather steadier, dried fruits arc stiff
and wanted for Eastern account, provisions are more
active owing to large Government orders for cured
meats; wool is quiet and hops are dull: butter, cheese
and eggs are higher; fresh fruit is still selling at good
prices in spite of the temporary congestion already
noted, and the only thing to show any marked weak
ness is the American hog, which has persistently de
clined in price for a fortnight and is utterly devoid
of backbone at the close.
These few points pretty well cover the trade situa
tion at the moment. Everybody is looking forward
to a good fall trade, and there is nothing in sight to
indicate anything else.
Colorado gentlemen in quest of Senator Wolcott's
seat should bear in mind that it was held at a pretty
stiff figure when the incumbent took it, and
that times are hard.

THE FARCE OF THE WEEK-
WHILE the peace negotiations between the
United States and Spain will constitute the
serious business of the drama of the week, and
rumors of war between Great Britain and Russia will
furnish the gloom and intensity of menacing tragedy,
the gathering of the Democratic clans, tribes and
factions at Sacramento will provide an entertaining
farce for those who like hilarity and do not object to
noise.
Although the gathering is to be made up of Demo
crats it is not certain whether the assembly will turn
out to be a Democratic convention or a Populist rati
fication meeting. The issue is not one of importance,
and the result either way will not seriously affect the
commonwealth or the changes of the moon, but the
proceedings will nevertheless be worth watching.
When the Populists set their Maguire trap for the
Democrats they baited it with the office of State
Treasurer. Everything else they took for themselves,
but they left that position with its control of the State
money as a temptation for those they were after. It
is now to be seen whether the crowd at Sacramento
will grab for the treasury and be content or will set
up a full ticket and demand everything in sight.
It is not likely there will be much of a fight, though
there will surely be plenty of noise. The racket of the
cats in Mr. Foote's back yard which has so disturbed
him of late will be as nothing to the racket which will
be raised at Sacramento; and Billy will doubtless wear
a deeper scowl this week than Henry did when it
was announced to him last week that he is morally
and probably legally responsible for some 400 cats
on Green street.
There is a breed of apes known as the "howlers,"
from whom Democrats differ only by slight degrees
of development, the process of evolution having not
yet gone far enough to wholly separate the primeval
relations between them. The howlers, according to
the Encyclopedia Britannica, are the most bulky of
American apes, and are those whose muzzles are most
projecting. They are stupid animals, but have a won
derful power of voice. Some of the species, it is
added, are brilliantly streaked with red and yellow.
It is in habit rather than in outward form and
show, however, that the relation of howlers to Demo
crats is most clearly seen. In each tribe of the species
there is always a leader. Whenever he howls all the
others hasten to gather around him, and each one
grabbing another's tail begins to howl also, so that
in a short time after the leader has given the signal
the chorus beats a cat chorus out of hearing.
The grabbing of tails has of course a good deal to
do with the raising of the chorus. It is not a formal
ceremony merely. It will be readily understood that
if a tail be rightly twisted the accompanying howl
will be much increased in tension. At Sacramento,
for example, if some Foote or Harney howler be
in position to catch the Maguire fellow by the tail
about the time he is going to raise his voice, it may
be accounted as certain the resulting screech will
raise the keynote of the campaign so high the Iro
quois Club will have to climb over one another to get
half way up, and the Examiner won't be able to reach
it even with a siren.
Altogether there is going to be fan at Sacramento,
with noise enough to take the edge off the rumors
of war in the Orient. Read The Call and 'get the
news of all the proceedings.
MfIGUIRE OND THE FUNDING BILL.
WHILE Maguire's cunning or luck has enabled
him to be successful thus far in the manipula
tion of men and the pulling of political wires,
he has been singularly unfortunate in his efforts to
formulate an issue on which to go before the people
as a candidate for Governor. His party leaders have
withdrawn the silver plank from the campaign, and
he for reasons of his own has pitched into the rub
bish pile his single tax programme.
Being thus in danger of appearing before the public
as a candidate of two parties with no platform, ho
made an earnest effort in his speech in this city to
frame some kind of a structure to stand on. He se
lected the funding bill as an issue, struck a stately
attitude on the subject and proceeded to declare that
he would have succeeded in defeating the iniquitous
measure had it not been for the betrayal of the peo
ple's cause by the Republican Congressmen from
California.
Maguire's pose as he told of his fight for the inter
ests of California against the octopus was like that
of Falstaff when he told of his fight at half swords
for an hour with twelve men in buckram. It required
only a very plain tale to put down the boastful Fal
staff. and a story equally simple destroys the boasting
and the vaunting of Maguire. Congressman Barham
told the story of the passage of the funding bill in
The Call yesterday, and it causes Maguire's intended
campaign thunder to fizzle out like a broken fire
cracker.
It will be remembered that Maguire in his desper
ate effort to make capital for himself out of the fund
ing bill had charged that Barham was largely respon
sible for its passage. Barham refuted the statement
by quoting the account given in the Congressional
Record of the proceedings relating to the measure.
As the bill came from the Senate it was objectionable
to Mr. Barham and other Republicans, notwithstand
ing it had received the sanction of Senator Morgan,
who has long held the position of leader in the fight
against the railroad. Mr. Barham proposed an
amendment declaring that nothing in the act should
waive or release any right, lien or cause of action al
ready held by the United States. The amendment
was submitted to Maguire, who suggested the in
sertion of the word "right," wliich is found therein.
When the question of adoptingthe proposedamend
ment came up in the House it was then possible for
Maguire to have defeated the bill had he chosen.
He was present, but he made no objection. Mr. Bar
ham therefore very pertinently says:
"Mr. Maguire knew perfectly well that unless
my amendment was consented to I would vote
against the bill, and there were at least twenty other
Republicans who would also have voted against the
bill, and it would have been defeated. He will prob
ably explain why he did not say 'I object,' and kill
my amendment and thus defeat the whole bill."
This exposure of Maguire's double dealing on the
funding bill deprives the demagogue of any possi
bility of making a winning fight on that issue. The
fact that after remaining silent and permitting the
bill to pass he now comes home and .endeavors to
make glory for himself by slandering his colleagues
in Congress will add to the shnmelessness of his rec
ord. The words which from his mouth might have
defeated the bill, but which, for reasons of his own.
he refrained from speaking, will now be a common
cry in the campaign. Wherever his candidacy is put
forward among men who believe in straightforward
politics and are opposed to demagogues, there will
arise a universal cry "I object."
It is not yet too late to punish those who starved
our soldier boys on the transport ships.
Call no man a good citizen until you have found
out whether he ,has registered or not. â  '
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 15, 1898.
DO NOT FORGET TO REGISTER .
T~\ EGISTRATION closes to-day. For the bene
tâS fit and convenience of the large number of
persons who have not yet registered the books
will be kept open until midnight. Up to the last min
ute of the time allowed by law an opportunity will
be afforded for citizens to secure themselves in the
privilege of voting at the coming election.
For causes hard to understand there has been
something like an apathy among a large number of
people with regard to politics this year. The regis
tration has been slow and the number registered is
far below the full vote of the city. There is nothing
in the situation to justify this indifference to public
duties. The issues of the campaign are not so ex
citing as those involved in the Presidential struggle
of two years ago, but they are sufficiently important
to arouse the minds of earnest men. Moreover, they
affect to a greater or less extent the welfare of every
citizen. Certain it is that when the campaign begins
in earnest and the full scope of the issues at stake is
made plain all who have now in their indifference
neglected to register will regret it.
If we are to have good politics and good adminis
trations in the city and State, good citizens must
register. As a matter of fact no matter how good a
man may be socially or in business he can hardly be
accounted a good citizen if he neglects his political
duties. The "push" and the "pull" will be registered
to the last man. The bosses will have their full force
at the polls. What are the good citizens going to do
about it?
It costs nothing to register. It imposes little or no
inconvenience. It interferes with no man's business.
All should attend to it. Each should assure himself
in the right of an American citizen to cast a vote for
those whom he desires to represent him in the gov
ernment of the city, the State and the nation.
STUDIES OF ThjE FUTURE.
AMONG the articles relating to war issues in the
magazines and reviews for the month the two
most notable are: "The Spanish War and the
Equilibrium of the World," by Brooks Adams in the
Forum, and "Distant Possessions â The Parting of
the ways," by Andrew Carnegie in the North Ameri
can Review. The conclusions of the two are
diametrically opposed, and the methods of reasoning
are widely diverse. Both, however, give expression
to the sincere thoughts of able men, and are deserv
ing of much more consideration than is usually given
to the fleeting literature of monthly publications.
Mr. Adams declares there are now dominating the
world two great forces whose impulses have started
movements that may be interfered with to some ex
tent, but cannot be checked or turned aside by states
men. One of these is causing a steady drift of com
mercial and industrial empire westward. The other
is forcing the peoples of the world into ever larger
combinations. As a result of the first the United
States will find itself eventually the center of the busi
ness of the globe and intimately concerned in the
afi'airs of all nations. As a result of the second there
will be some form of coalition between the British
and the Americans made necessary to resist the pow
erful combinations now building up in Continental
Europe.
Arguing from these propositions Mr. Adams
strongly urges the annexation of the Philippines at
this time, in order that we may have a point from
which to protect our growing commercial interests in
the Orient, and he also advocates an Anglo-Saxon
coalition. Should such an alliance be brought about.
hr says: "Probably human society would then be
absolutely dominated by a vast combination of peo
ples whose right wing would rest upon the British
isles, whose left would overhang the middle provinces
of China, whose center would approach the Pacific,
and who would encompass the Indian Ocean as
though it were a lake, much as the Romans en
compassed the Mediterranean."
Against the conclusions of this growing prophecy
of the future Mr. Carnegie sets the reasoning of a
practical man of business dealing with the problem
from the standpoint of American interests as they
exist to-day. He points out that Europe is at this
time an armed camp, not because the home terri
tory of any nation is threatened with invasion, but
because of aggressions made by all in Africa and in
Asia. If we annex the Philippines or enter into any
sort of coalition with Great Britain we will involve
the republic in wars, the end of which no man can
foresee, and the results of which certainly will not
tend to the maintenance of our republican form of
K< vornment and our democratic institutions.
Moreover, Mr. Carnegie points out that distant
possessions are a source of weakness rather than of
strength even to Great Britain. We, with our vast
and rich territory at home, have nothing to gain by
them, but much to lose by reason of the cost of gov
erning and defending them. We have a continent to
populate and develop. Within the limits of our con
tinental domain we are safe from foreign attack, and
while we retain that position we can play a com
manding part in the world without seeking the alli
ance of any other power.
When the excitement of the war is over the people
like Mr. Adams, who are now so eager for a coalition
with Great Britain and the entrance of this country
into the scramble for possessions in the Orient, will
have a chance to take a second thought of the issue.
When they do the more intelligent among them will
surely perceive the wisdom of the reasoning of Mr.
Carnegie, Judged from the standpoint of American
interests, the true policy of the nation to-day is the
same as it has been in the past, to preserve our se
curity on this hemisphere safe from any danger of
complications that may involve us in European strife
and war.
This is the last day for registration, but remember
the opportunity will not close until midnight, and so
long as the lamp holds out to burn the vilest sinner
may return and save his franchise.
If reports of how our boys were treated on the way
to Manila are true there should be numerous enforced
vacancies among the commissioned officers of the
various regiments involved.
There is to be a real live Lord Mayor in New York
soon, but a little later there is to be one in San Fran
cisco. The effete East shall never be permitted to
beat us.
Murderer Cheesman of Oakland pretends to glory
in the prospect of being hanged, but this will be
found another instance of distance lending enchant
ment.
With the treasury full of money and the army full
of men longing for a chance to right we are more
unprepared for peace just now than we were for war.
Maguire's record on the funding bill vote gives
every citizen a right to meet his claims in the coming
campaign with a prompt "I object."

"WHISPERING" GAVIN'S DELEGATES.
Motley Crowd of Office Seekers and "Push" Politicians Appointed to Rep
resent San Francisco Democrats.
Now that the McNab-Gould-Alford
Committee of One Hundred has com
pleted its self-appointed task of ap
pointing delegates to represent the
wishes of 30,000 Democratic voters of
this city at the State convention, it
may be of interest to these same
voters to know who the men are who
have been delegated with the power
to give voice to the popular willâ of the
bosses. Not because the knowledge can
in any way change the fact that the
delegates were appointed without the
consent or approval of the voters, but
because it may be interesting in the
same way that it might be interesting
for a condemned man to know the
name and personal characteristics of
the hangman to whom has been dele
gated the task of ushering him into an
other world.
The list of delegates comprises 154
names, all of them selected without
reference to the wishes of the voters
whom they are to represent. It is not
necessary to go over the entire list, as
many of the names and many of the
men are familiar to a majority of the
residents of San Francisco. They need
no introduction, therefore, as their po
litical history is well, if not favorably,
known. There are others, comprising
over two-thirds of the entire number,
whose names are given herewith for
the purpose of allowing the reading
public an opportunity to know the
! manner of men to whom has been dele
gated the power of representing the
wishes of one-half the inhabitants of
the metropolis of the Pacific Coast in
the selection of candidates for the ex
ecutive and judicial offices of the State
of California. The list follows:

"Cease." and the red flame dies away.
The thunders sleep, along the gTay
Smoke-shrouded hills the echoes fall.
"Cease firing!" Close the columns fold
Their shattered wingsâ the war-worn troops
Now "stand at ease"â the ensign droops,
The chargers' heated flanks turn cold.
"Cease firing!" Down with point reversed
The reeking, crimson saber drips;
Cool grows the fevered cannon's lips â
Their wreathing vapprs far dispersed.
"Cease firing!" From the sponson's rim
The mute black muzzles frown across
The sea. where swelling surges toss
The armored squadrons, silent, grim.
"Cease firing!" Look, white banners show
Along the graves where warriors sleep-
Above the waves where men lie deep
In pure soft flutterings of snow.
"Cease firing." Glorious and sweet
For country tis to die â and comes
The Peace â and bugles blow and drums
Are sounding out the Last Retreat!

6-lnch quick flrers of 45 caliber length;
seventeen 3-inch quick firers of 50 caliber
length, throwing shells of 13 pounds, and
six 3-pounder Hotchkiss. The six-inch
guns will each have 180 rounds of ammu
nition, the 3-inch will have 300 rounds to

The Pactolus, a British cruiser of 2135
tons, 7000 horse power and 20 knot speed,
I has recently gone through her 30 hours'
j coal consumption trial with unsatisfac
tory results. The ship, in conformity to
the peculiar practice in England, was fly
ing very light, drawing only 14 feet,
I whereas her load draught is to be 17 feet.
â  With 251 pounds of steam and 168 revolu
! tions the engines developed only 3265
horse power against the calculated 3500.
Worst of all the coal consumption aver
aged 2.74 pounds per horse power per
hour. The ship is fitted with water-tube
boilers of the Blachynden type, which in
this instance were a decided disappoint
ment as to efficiency and moderate eco
nomical coal consumption.
The Albatross, torpedo-boat destroyer,
was luunched at Thorneycroft's yard July
19, all complete, ready for steaming. Tho
vessel is of 360 tone displacement, 227 feet
in length. 21 feet 3 inches beam and 8
feet 5 inches mean draught with 80 tons
of ooal on board. She has three water
tube boilers to carry 250 pounds of steam
and with 400 revolutions is calculated to
develop 8000 horse power and a speed of
32 knots. Another boat, named Express,
was launched at Laird's yard in June
which !b calculated to make S3 knots
with 7700 horse power. She hs or the same
length as the Albatross, but has nine
inches more beam and has muclf finer
lines, displacing only 300 tons.
The dockyards in Great Britain are
unusually busy and shipbuilding Is being
pushed with great activity. The keel of
the battleship Formidable was laid at
Portsmouth March 21. and up to July 23
there had already been worked 2200 tons
material Into the hull, being at the rate
of 550 tons per month. At the same yard
2000 men are working on the battleship
Canopus.
The Russian naval programme is, ac
cording to a published statement by Lord
Charles Berepford, as follows: One hun
dred and seventeen millions dollars is to
be expended during the period of IS9B
1904 upon the construction of eight first
class battleships, six first-class cruisers,
ten second-class cruisers, one submarlnÂ©
transport, one torpedo transport, twenty
torpedo-boat destroyers and thirty tor
pedo boats. The battleships will all bo
of 12.900 tons, 368 feet in length. 72 feet 6
inches beam and 26 feet draught and to
have a speed of 18 knots under natural
draught. One Is being built by the Cramps
at a contract cost of $4,358,000, to be deliv
ered in thirty months; four are being
built at the Government yards in Russia,
one in France and two are still unassign
ed. Of the first-class cruisers of 6000 tons
and 23 knots speed, Cramps are building
one, two hare been placed in France, two
are being built by a Belgian firm at
Nicolaieff, and builders in Germany have
been Invited to bid on the remaining large
cruiser and one of the 3000-ton cruis
ers, of which latter nine are still to be as
signed. Six torpedo-boat destroyers of 312
tons are building at the Neroskey works,
St. Petersburg, and six of the same size
in France; they are all to have a speed
of 29 knots under natural draught. Ger
man shipyards have been offered a
chance to bid on eight boats of 350 tons.
Finland is building four 150-ton torpedo
boats to steam 29 knots under forced
draught and the remainder will be built
in Russian yards. The total of this naval
programme is 76 vessels of 199.744 tons.
There Is quite a number of battleships
and cruisers not yet placed and the
builders of the Oregon should have an,
opportunity to compete with Eastern and
foreign shipbuilders and furnish vessels
to serve as samples of what constitute*
efficiency in working and in construction.

gates to the Democratic State Con
vention which assembles Tuesday
afternoon began to arrive to-day.
. The evening trains brought a contin
â¢ giÂ»nt of party workers and reinforced
. the : army of aspirants for State posi
tionÃ how in the field.
:â â¢.â¢ The chief interest of the ho-ur relates
to the temporary organization of the
convention. Singularly enough the two
leading:, candidates for the position are
Los Angeles men, and from the general
tenor of remarks this evening it seems
that George B. Pnttor. is likely to be
â "chosen to fill that hono- although his
opponet. Isadore D. Dockweiler, has
soirre enthusiastic friends. But Bouth
ern'Cti.liforn:a delegates who know both
meri. say that Patton possesses such
.. Splendid ability as a presiding officer,
and. is such a clear and ready talker
.that the natural demand? of the con
".veriti.on will likely favor his choice.
Harney Fight Engrosses Attention.
It is. obvious that the contest from
San Francisco concerning recognition
of the Harney and McNab elements of
the party will engross the early atten
tion of the convention. To-morrow the
Sacramento local delegation will cau

Budd May Be Chairman.
. .'While it is pretty generally acknowl
edged that Patton or Dockweiler -0111
'.'be temporary chairman of the conven
tion, it seems highly probable that the
. .hqqors' of permanent chairman may be
â  â  tendered to Governor Budd.
â¢Intelligence was received here last
â  night from a source that cannot be
questioned that early this afternoon
Judge Maguire and Governor Budd held
'â :]tt long conference In the rooms of the
loiter at the Palace Hotel, San Fran
. Cisco. It is : â  that there was
tree exchange of views on convention
.topics, and Incidentally the question of
j ling recognition to the Harney
deles ted by the primaries was
'discussed. Judge Maguire desired to
â  .hold 'himself free from any contact with
â  this; contention, but did express a per
â¢ -sonar wish that Governor Budd should
â  .â¢bre^o.me' the permanent presiding officer
of the- convention and give the fusion
-'movement his fullest and most unre-
Mrve9 support, it is believed to-night
-.that Magulre and Budd reached an un
derstand! OK that Insures the Governor's
H'-Wli-on for permanent chairman. The
Oakland delegation caucused last night
and agreed on M. v. Tarpey for tempo
rary chairman, and indorsed Governor
JBudd. for permanent chairman of the
â  Btate- Convention.
Word, comes from Log Angeles that
the delegation from that county hns
adopted . a resolution urging Stephen
M. White to stand as a candidate for
the United States Senate. A similar
resolution will be presented to the State
Convention.
McNab on the Inside.
One phase of the contemplated fight
over the seating: of the two contesting
Ban' Francisco delegations has been
definitely determined. Secretary Troy
of the State Central Committee stated
to-night that the delegation appointed
by the Committee of One Hundred
would be played upon the printed tem
porary roll. This in effect means that
tho Gould-McNab-Alford delegation
will be given seats on the floor of the
convention hall and will have a voice
in the naming of the temporary chair
man. As the temporary Chairman has
the appointment of the committee on
credentials this gives the programmers
a distinct advantage, as It will give
them a solid block of 154 votes to cast
in favor of their candidate for the tem
porary chairmanship.
It is quite possible that when the con
vention is called to order friends of the
Harney delegation will seek to secure
the adoption of a motion excluding
both delegations from participation in
the temporary organization of the con
vention. Whether juch a motion will
be entertained or not is exceedingly
questionable, and from present indica
tions it appears that their fight for rec
ognition will have to be made when
the report of the committee of Creden
tials is read.
HARNEYITES FIRST
ON THE BATTLEFIELD
Country Democrats WIJI Advise
Harmony and Urge a Com
promise.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. l-1.-The Harney
ites believe in the old adage that the ear
ly bird catches the worm an<l they are
out looking for the worm. ThÂ«y intend
making a fight to the bitter end against
delegates appointed by the Committee of
One hundred, and are firm in their belief
that the Democratic State Convention
will give them the contested seats.
But few of the Interior delegates have
arrived and but little work will be possi
ble before to-morrow night. The senti
ment of the delegates now on the conven
tion ground is that foiÂ» the Bake of har
mony and peace in Democratic rank 3in
Snn Francisco some means should be de
vised to bring the factions together. If
the feud is carried on in San Francisco it
means the loss if many hundred votes
that would otherwise go to the local
ticket. It Is mainly a local Qgbt, but the
underlying poini Is Drrno<-ratic principle.
While matters may not turn out to suit
both factions there is one thing certain
and that la that on State politics they will
l><- united. The local differences at tin
two Frisco delegations will nut cut any
figure in tho Stau? flplit. Delegates of
both sides say that no matter v.-hat may
be the result of the contest, they will go
home fipht.iiig- for th^ Stiite nominpfs. In
San Francisco affairs there is a different
story to tell.
An effort will he made to bring the war-
Ing factions together and have them dls
contlnue a fight that will not locally avail
either si.)>\ The Barney pÂ».-oj>lp believe
that if they <lo not giÂ«t the seats In the
State Convention they will at least re
ceive half of them. Some of the Snrra
mr-nto delegates think that for the best
interests of the State ticket both sides
THE GODLD-ALFORD-McNAB SLATE.
The Harney faction of the Democratic party of this city has re
sumed Its fight against the Oould-Alford-MeNab combine with great
vigor, and in order that the country delegates may be thoroughly fa
miliar with the schemes of the triumvirate the following circular will
be handed to every member of the convention before the opening
session:
THE SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRACY.
Which Is the Regular Organization?â The Question in a Nutshell.
Is it right and democratic that three menâ Gavin McNab, F. H. Gould
and W. 11. Alford, members of the State Central Committeeâ with a bag
ful of proxies, through one man, \V. H. Alford. the chairman, shall ap
point a committee of nlr.e men, who shall appoint a county committee of
100 men, who shall appoint a delegation to the State Convention of 154 men,
â¢who shall nominate for office only themselves?
Th<- offices to be nominated for by the San Francisco delegation to the
State Convention are four: Ist, Congressman from Fourth District; 2d,
Congressman from Fifth District; 3d, Railroad Commissioner; 4th, Mem
ber Board of Equalization.
Now OBSERVE THE PROGRAMME:
For Office No. Iâ Congressman Fourth District. The programme is,
Gavin McNab of the committee of three and the committee of nine or
James H. Barry of the committee of ono hundred.
For Office No. 2â Congressman Fifth Dis-trict. The programme is, Wil
liam Craig of the committee of one hundred.
For Office No. 3â Railroad Commissioner. The programme la, "William
Hinton of the committee of one hundred.
For Office No. 4 â Member of Board of Equalization. The programme
is, John H. Grady of the committee of one hundred.
Therefore, none but these self-constituted trustees of the party can
receive nominations. The chosen one hundred will choose from the one
hundred and take care of tho one hundred. Who represents the remain
ing 34,900 Democrats of San Francisco? And all this in the name of vir
tue and reform!
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 15, 1898.
should bo given equal chances, that is.
give each faction a one-half vote on every
proposition.
John F. MeGovern, secretary of the
Harney County Committee, and Sammy
Kohlman, arrived hero on the afternoon
train to look after their side of the fight.
They found but little work for them to do
as the delegates are slow in arriving.
The reported excessive heat here has
kept many away who would have other
wise been on the lighting ground
to-night. The weather to-night is cool
end there are indications that the climatic
warm spell !s over for the present. The
political warm spell will succeed the other
inside of the next twenty-four hours.

Serious Injury.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14.â Bert Reed, a son
of Mayor D. C. Reed of this city, met
with a serious mishap -it La Jolla to-day.

ly five feet. He weighs over 200 pounds
and could not check the momentum of his
fall in such shallow v/ater. His condi
tion 1b considered, very serious.

ALIVE WITH POLITICIANS.
Gossip About the Chairmanship
Around the Hotels.
Every gust of wind seemed to blow
politicians into the hotel corridors last
night. From Mendocino and Humboldt,
San Diego and Tulare, the bourbon dele
gates collected and fought cut the pros
pective battle, the theater of which will
be Sacramento.
What seems to be the all-absorbing
topic among the southern delegates is the
fig.it over the chalrmahship. Mayor Syn
der of San Diego is working for I. B.
Dockweiler. George S. Patton. Doekwell
er's opponent, arrived last night and ha
will not throw up the sponge until an ad
verse decision is reached.
To-day at Sacramento the Los Angeles
delegates will hold a caucus to decide up
on their choice for the chairmanship. As
the other Southern representatives have
not advanced any candidate it is thought
that the support of this entire delegation
will be given the L.os Angeles delega
tion's choice. Whether it be Patton or
Dockweiler complete support from the
unsuccessful candidate to the choice of
the caucus seems assured.
George R Cole, the San Bernardino at
torney, who is out for the Democratic
nomination for Justice of the Supreme
Court, was around the California Hotel
yesterday afternoon, consulting with tho
managers 01 the convention and the dele
gates who were at the State Committee
headquarters*
Judge Hughes of San Diego, another as
pirant for judicial honors, was also siz
ing up the situation and preparing td
make his light before the convention.
Among other visitors at the headquar
ters were Congressman Castle of the Sev
enth Dl3trict and E. C. Farnsworth of
Vlfalia. The latter is also after the nom
ination for Judge of the Supreme Court.
MANWARING'S SUCCESSOR.
Members of the Republican County
Committee are now discussing the suc
cessor to the late chairman, Charles TV.
Manwaring. Out of respect to the mem
ory of their deceased fellow-member, the
eommltteemen refused to talk about his
successor until after the funeral, which
occurred yesterday.
T. D. Riordan. vice-chairman of the
committee, is mentioned as the probable
man for the vacant position. Mr. Rior
dan thinks his long service in the Re
publican party of this city should be rec
ognized an(J that he should be made
chairman and given charge of the work
of the municipal campaign which Is now
approaching. â, â
There is opposition to Mr. Riordan.
however. J. P. Ahearn. another well
known, hard working Republican, is a
candidate. Jack Chretien is also men
tioned as a possibility. If Rlordan is not
chosen two or three other gentlemen Will
announce their candidacy.

RIGHT BOWER
WINS THE STAKE
The Erratic Greyhound
Defeats Theron.
HE WAS A ONE TO TWO SHOT
BIT OF FASHION TAKES THE
SAPLING HONORS.
X V. Sullivan's Crack Youngster Pro
tested as Not Complying With
the Age Requirements of
That Class,
' ' The erratic Right Bower, who has
brought woe to the hearts of countless
bettors on local coursing fields, surprised
. the wise division at Union Coursing Park
yesterday. He won the final round of
the op"en stake handily with odds of 2 to
1 against him. He was hardly considered
a possibility for the stake In the earlier
rounds until he beat Cavalier, with odds
of 5 to 2 against him. In this he led a
' scant length to the hare, which he picked
up on the run.
He next retired Liberty Bell to the ken-
â  n< : !s, and then met Minneapolis. The
â Bower did all the work In the earlier
â  stages of the course. Minneapolis then
â  went In and the Bower played behind.
â  She killed too soon to offset the lead he
hud secured.
â¢The final brought the Bower and Theron
together in the hands of Slipper James
Wren. The betting opened with the
Bower a slight favorite, and changed
â  . gradually until it was 2 to 1 against him.
â¢ The heavy bettors played Theron as a
â¢ certainty on public form, while the pikers
â  and men who had watched the work of
the dogs during the day favored the fawn
. and white dog. The course was quickly
â decided. The Bower led from the slips,
and with hardly a swerve picked up the
. hare and killed, winning the stake.
In the sapling stake. Bit of Fashion,
owned by E. V. Sullivan, showed remark
able speed throughout. In all her races
â¢ â¢be lea from five to ten lengths. In the
. final round she was pitted against Rol
licking Airs. A strong hare was released
and Bit of Fashion commenced to open
â  a gap at once. First she led by about
three lengths, which she gradually in
â . creased to ten. She worked the hare all
.' over the field, and hardly allowed her op
ponent an opportunity to score.
' Immediately after the course R. E. de B.
Lopez protested the winner on the ground
. that she was over twelve months of age,
which is the limit for saplings. Both
he and Mr. Sullivan were required to lodge
â¢$25 in the hands of the stewards until
the matter Is finally adjusted. Mr. Sulli
van bought Bit of Fashion recently and
accepted the pedigree offered by her for
mer owned. Volunteer, a full brother of
hers, won the sapling stake at Ingleside
a fortnight since, at which time no ques
tion of age w^s brought up.
The hares throughout the day were
good, many escaping. The weather w.as
"' favorable, the fog passing well above the
field. The results follow:

were sprung on the betting talent, the
most important being the defeat of the
English dog- False Flatterer by the rank
outsider Rush o' Hill, the latter dog be
ing the short end In the long- odds book
at the tempting price of 100 to 1. Promise
Me was also a great surprise and showed
â wonderfully Improved form over his last
few performances, gaining a place in the
stake.
The sport throughout the day was close
and exciting, the decisions by Judge Grace
were just and promptly given, and should
the management still retain for some time
the possession of the coursing grounds
there should be no reason why we should
not see this winter a more succesful

of the transport and the six devotea
nurses are now in the balanceâ ready to
go If wanted or to stay at hÂ»me.

A HARD LIFE
ON THE SYDNEY
Soldier Boys Given Only
Two Meals a Day.
WERE NEARLY HALF STARVED
HABD TACK AND DECAYED
CANNED GOODS.
The Transport's Hospital Crowded
Throughout the Voyage and
"the Brig Never With
out a Prisoner.
The Mall Company's steamer City of
Sydney would have reached port early
Saturday had not her steering gear i
broken. She was going at a good clip
when the accident i.appened. and the en
gines had to be stopped until repairs were
j made. The soldiers who went to Manila
i on the Sydney had a terrible time of it.
j The least Blip was punished with twenty- j
, four hours In the brig, and' what that |
meant in the tropics can hardly be imag
ined. The prisoners must have suffered
i horribly. The water was so hot that It
! could hardly be drunk, and such a thing
! as Ice was never heard of outside the of
llcers' mess.
The soldier boys only got two meals a
day on the Sydney. The Ilrst, composed
of "hard tack and coffee, was served at
7:30 a. m.. and the second, of "hard tack,"
corned beef and coffee, was served at 5 !
! p. m. Toward the latter part of the voy- !
' age all the canned provisions became :
I "blown" by the heat, and the commie- i
i sariat had to doctor the stuff so as to j
i take away the smell before It was served ;
â  out to the men. During the entire trip
I the hospital was always full, and when â¢.
! the vessel reached Manila half the sol- ;
â¢ dlers were on the sick list.
The gunboat Bennington arrived from i
! Puget Bound yesterday. Captain Moser, j
' who Is In command, is to proceed to San i
i Jose do Guatemala to join the Albatross ;
i on that station.
The American ship Florence lost one
I of her crew overboard during the voyage
Ito San Francisco. On April 7 H. Presoott
' went out of his mind and, jumping over*
â  board, was drowned.
The bark Agate has reached port after
i a long passage of 177 days from New ;
' York. She brought out thirty-one male
and two female Klondikers. They are ,
â  not quite as eager as they were five
months ago to reach the land of gold.
The bark Invercauld had a rough pass
' age from Cardiff. On April 15 some seas
broke overboard that did considerable
; damage, besides spoiling all the fresh i
! water. On June 4 the steering gear car- i
rled away, and it took gome time to repair j
â  the damage. The accident happened while !
the crew was wearing ship.
The overdue bark General Falrchlld ar
â â â  rived from Newcastle, N. S. W., yester- j
â  day. The long pasage was due to light i
I winds and calms. Five per cent relnaur
1 ance was paid on the Falrchlld's cargo.
IMPRESSIVE FUNERAL
OF C. W. MANWARING
CEREMONIES HELD AT THI
MASONIC TEMPLE.
Many Prominent Masons and Politi
cians Present â Eloquent Eulogy
by Charles Bundschu.
The funeral of the late Charles W. Man
' waring, for many years chairman of the
i Republican County Commltee and mem
ber of the Republican State Central Com
mittee, was held yesterday afternoon
from King Solomon Hall, Masonic Ter
n pie. The attendance was large and
aside from personal friends and relatives
included a prominent delegation from
i Scottish Rites L-odpe in full regalia, the
Pacific Lodge F. and A. M., of which de
ceased was a member, and the Republl-
I can County Committee. The obsequies
1 were conducted under the auspices of the
Pacific Lodge, with \V. K. Lutz as acting
master of ceremonies.
The ceremonial remarks by the latter
. were very touching and were followed
by an eloquent eulogy delivered by
i Charles BundschU, for whom the deceas
ed had acted as confidential clerk and ac
countant for the past fifteen years. He
spoke of the dead man's sterling qualitiea
as a man and friend, his business abtli
i ties and his unusual success and loyalty
lln matters political. Mr. Bundschu'a
panegyric was ?o earnest, heartfelt and
, appropriate that it brought tears to the
I eyes of many of those assembled.

WILL RACE THE TROTTERS.
The Golden Gate Park Driving Asso
ciation to Hold a Racing
Meeting.
The members of the Golden Gate Park
Driving Association held a meeting last
night at 1200 Market street for the pur
pose of making arrangements for hold
ing trotting and pacing races on Admis
sion Day, September 9.
E. Aigeltinger presided and about sixty
well-known local horsemen were present.
The meeting was quite enthusiastic
and many applications for membership
were presented and referred to the com
mittee on Investigation.
It is a rule of the association that only
members can enter horses at the biennial
meetings, and the animals must be driven
by their owners.
The object of the meeting is simply so
ciability and an opportunity to prove
which of the gentlemen drivers who ap
pear dally in the park owns the best
norse. , Â
The proceeds of the sale of privileges
etc., will go as heretofore, for the im
provement of the speed track in Golden
Gate Park.
After considerable discussion It was de
cided to hold the meeting at the Ingle
side track, on September 9 and 10, as,
owing to the numerous entries already
guaranteed. It would be impo3lble to
pull the races off in one afternoon.
E. Aigeltinger, F. O'Kane and Dr. Dal
zell were chosen a committee on track,
and C. Capp, Dr. Dalzell and F. W.
Thompson were appointed to look after
the printing. _ _
J. C. Kirkpatrick, J. Chesley, E. Stew
art and F. O'Kane were appointed a com
mittee on arrangements and to attend to
the disposal of the privileges.
It was decided that the purses offered
would amount to $90 to be divided be
tween the first, second and third horses
in each race.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Aug. 14.
Although Alameda County held a pretty
lively primary yesterday it can hardly
bo supposed that it will not be exceeded
In "life" by the pr^at battle programmed
for next Wednesday. As between the
Pardee-Davis contest and the Metcalf-
Hilborn, the conditions are somewhat dif-
THE PRINCIPALS IN THE BATTLE FOR CONGRESS
Dr. Pardee has. for some years,
i . . -of the local
; :1 machinery, while Mr. Davis has
not been heard ol â  local politics
Binee he was Mayor many years ago. Mr.
Hilborn has had an organization for many
years and has used it with success on
many occasions. Mr. Metcalf, though
known all over the county, only com
menced to organize a few months ago and
has rapidly â  : a plan of < ampaign
that has proved a great surprise to his
tfrieji.ls. While Mr. Hilborn was rather
complacently laying back on his oars and
relying on recounting his past career and
lecturing on the navy, Mr. Metcalf and
his army of friends were actively making
b. canvass on the direct Issue. While Mr.
Hilborn was at Washington his friends
here practically did nothing for him.
Most of them had received Federal re
wards for fealty to him in the past and
their hands were tied. Then the retire
ment from active politics a year ago of
hls : gnat friend and former supporter,
frank A. Leach, helped further to dis
integrate Mr. Hilborn's old support.
The. shrewdest politicians are saying to
day that the victory of l'ardee presages
a Victory for Metcalf, and If appearances
are not more than usually deceptive the
prophecy will prove to be true. During
the last few days of tho primary cam
paign that ended yesterday it was very
evident that practically the saai'*organi
zation was working for both* Paidee and
Metcalf, and while it is, perhaps, not to
be expected that Metcalf s victory will bf>
as sweeping as that of Dr. Pardee his
hardest workers declare with marked con
fidence that he will secure enough votes
to nominate in Alameda County. He can
dq this and still leave a handfull for Mr
Hilborn. There are 112 delegates to the
resaional convention, and of these
Aluineda sends sixty-eight, which is
-eleven more than is necessary for a
choice. The claims of Mr. Hllborn's
friends are strongest in regard to the
Forty-sixth Assembly District. This <lis
t-rk-t includes the Hay wards, Livermore
aird Centerville districts, but only sends
ufric delegates, so that should Air. Met
calf-lose this he would still have two
: i spare.
jr's vote was not a large one
for a Republican primary preceded by
a long campaign. It was small
oompared to the Frick-Hilborn primar"
of two years ago. Yesterday :*731
Ist, Two years ago nearly
14,000- voted at the primaries.
The. result of yesterday's primary was
a. surprise to many. more politicians than
will admit it. The value of organization
trap*-' proved. To put it as one of Mr.
'Davis-' friends expressed the situation
last night, "The opposition to Pardee did
too much -talking and too little working."
It was an object lesson in practical poli
tics.. Alameda County has during the
.past four years developed into a "young
man. 8 county." The old method of allow
ing t.h. ir elders to do all the thinking
In politics has passed, and the young men
appear to have everything their own
way. . Dr. Pardee corraled most of the
â  Â«"uve. youns Republicans of the county.
He worked with them and through them,
and .rilled the county with their enthu

grace-holders Raking nominations, but
as each Ji.as given a commendable admin
istration to their constituents there can

band Mr.. Davis made a campaign that
might- have won two years ago when
there -was not such a demand for politi
cal- enthusiasm as at present. It was
too .staid and perhaps not "broad"

any discussion on that point must neces
sarily be superfluous.
The story of yesterday was really told
In this paper several months ago, when
it startled Oakland of publishing the fact
that Frank Leach's paper, then support
ing Davis, had been purchased in the
interests of Dr. Pardee's gubernatorial
candidacy.
.sow a word about the Pondirky Club
that did such good service at the prima
ries for Dr. Pardee. The "Pondinks," as
the members call themselves, appear at
present to be the stronghold of the Re
publican party In this county. Two years
ago, the club was organized in a little
cigar store on Ban Pablo avenue mainly
for the purpose of supporting Sam P. Hall
for Superior Judge. Their purpose was
gained and It was thought that the club,
which at Its inception was regarded as
somewhat of a Joke on account of Its
name, would share the fate of a piece
club after election. This was not the
case. Like waterfront litigation, it grew
and grew and Bert Swan and Al Williams
and a hundred others found that they had
something on their hands that was new
and not anxious to die. The club encour
aged candidates and condldates encour
aged the club, and I believe that to-day
that one club can control 2000 votes. It is
vastly superior to the ordinary ward
clubs, because it knows no geographical
boundaries. Its hundreds of members can
go anywhere without trespassing and there
are enough of them to enthuse a political
Klondike. In fact, judging by yesterday's
primaries, not to bo "in" with the Pon
dinks Is to be "out of it."

CUT HIS THROAT.
An Unknown Elderly Man Ends His
Life With a Razor.
OAKLAND. Aug. 14.â An unknown el
derly man cut his throat from ear to ear
with a razor early this morning in a barn
on the May ranch on the Decota road
south of Hay wards. He had called at the
ranch and asked to be given the privilege
to sleep in the barn. This? was granted,
and this morning he complained to one or
the hired men on the place of feeling
bad. He said he wished some one would
put him out of the way or he would kill
himself.
The hired man did not place much im
portance In his threat and left him, but
when hi' returned about an hour, later
he found the old man had cut his throat
with a razor and was dead.
Deceased had the appearance of being
about 8u years of age. He was unshaven
and poorly dressed.

BERKELEY, Au?. 14.â At the last meet-
Ing of the Board of Trustees, Health Offi

diphtheria, now prevalent in the region
of Eighth street and Charming way,
! were due to the wretched sanitary condi
tions of the houses in that district, the
I residents having no facilities for dispos
ing of sewage. At his recommendation
the board has ordered the construction of
a sewer on Eighth street from Dwight
way north to within XX) feet of 'Channing

LEFT HOMES IN MISERY.
Mrs. Martha Allen and Martin Bowers
Desert Their Families.
Th<Â» -water front has Its stories of domestic Infelicity as wen as the
aristocratic portions of the city. In many of the latter cases money
salves the wounds, but In the majority of others the cup has to be drunk
to the dregs.
As the result of one runaway, aman and a woman are happy forthetime
being, while two homes are wrecked and six people are miserable. Of the
latter four are children not yet old enough to fully realize their loss and
their parent's shame.
Gilbert Allen, now employed on the United States transport Arizona,
and hie wife Martha and their two children, lived at 45 Dohono street.'
Martin Bowers, a carpenter and bridge builder, now working 1 for James
McMahon at Salinas, up to a few days ago lived with his wife and two
children in the -Mission. Bowers and Mrs. Allen became acquainted and
friendship Boon ripened into love. Allen, according to his wife, was too
much givi:n to grumbling and she had to go to Bowers for sympnthy.
The upshot of it was that she left h^r husband and children, Bowers de
serted his family and both are now living at Salinas, where they can enloy
each Others' company undisturbed. The woman has all Allen's furniture
and personal effects as well as the children's clothen stored on Mission
t In the name of 1.,. Powers. Mrs. Bowers is In even a worse predica
ment, as she has her two children to support and does not know how to
do it.
"My wife was old enough to know better," said Allen when talking
about the matter on FolÃom-street wharf yesterday. "We have been
married eleven years and our children are 8 and 6 years old. We got
along all right, although she called me a grumbler. She had over $500 of
my money Bared up. I believe, and that she took along with her.
"Everything was going along v usual when I Wt for Portland last
February. Twice I sent her money with whfch to pay the bills and then
my letters wore returned unanswered. About the middle of May I left
the American ship George Stetson and came back to the city. I found my
wife had moved to 114 Langdon street and Bowers was living with her.
The fellow actually had the gall to ask me home to supper in my own
house. For the sake of the children I forgave everything and Bowers
cleared out. While I was at the ferries getting my trunk my wife took
the children and went to the Brunswick Hotel. I waited around for two
days before I found where she was and then she told me the youngest
child was sick and that she would live with me again If I would behave
myself.
"Well, she came back and I said, 'Martha, let bygones be bygones and
make a fresh start. Let's store our furniture and go to Portland and
stay all summer with your mother.' She agreed to do this and as soon as
our little one was better we stored our goods at Wilson's on Market street
and we all went to Portland. She stayed with us there just one week and
then she came back to San Francisco and rejoined Bowers. When I came
to the city it took me a month and three days to find them. They had
taken my furniture out of the warehouse and were living as man and wife
at 304 A Bryant street. When they heard I was on their track they broke
up the house and stored the furniture at 1145 Mission street in the
name of U Powers.
"I have seen my wife since then and told her she can keep the furni
ture it she will only give me my personal effects and the children's
clothes. This she refuses to do and I suppose I will have to go into the
courts to compel her. She is now living at Salinas and Bowers visits her
from Saturday to Monday. Bowers' brother is helping the deserted woman
in the case, I believe."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 15, 1898.
MR, DALTON
TO EXPLAIN
City Equalizers Have a
Few Questions to Ask.
BROSNAHAN IS SUSPICIOUS
A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER SEES
TOO MUCH POLITICS*
Street Railroad Matters Will Fur
nish a Lively Session
on Next Tuesday
Night.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 â¢ Broadway, Aug. 13.
Next Tuesday evening: the City Council
fitting as a Board of Equalization, will
take up the matter of the street railroad
; assessments. There have been several
! changes made by the County Assessor
\ since last year, and Councilman Watkln
j son claims that many of the reductions
! are entirely unwarranted.
Councilman Brosnahan openly charges
that the reductions were made by Mr.
Dalton for political effect, and next Tues-
day evening the Assessor will appear and
make his own explanations.
Councilman Heitman is inclined to be
very sarcastic regarding the position of
the City Board of Equalization, the City
Auditor and the assesment roll. Mr. Snow
is both Assessor and Auditor, and the
charter provides that he shall not make
an independent city assessment but shall
accept the <'ounty Assessor's figures.
Notwithstanding this, both city and coun
ty governments sit as Boards of Equali
zation and separately pass upon the as
sessments. This dual work always leads
to trouble.
Mr. Snow being Auditor as well as As
sessor, has the authority to take from the
roll property that should not be there,
because of its having been once assessed.
On this ground, he has positively refused
to obey the resolution of the Council
pasÃed last night to put the Seventh-street
local line on the assessment roll because
it is already assessed by the State Board
of Equalization, and he has been served
with n certified copy of such facts by
State Controller Colgan. Mr. Heitman be
lieves that all the work of the city equal
izers might be offset in the same manner,
and he declares that the work of equaliz
ing is simply a farce.
Councilman Pringle, who is a candi
date for the Assembly, takes Issue with
Mr. Snow, and says that the matter is
one for the courts to decide, and that he
favors the property going on the roll for
the purpose of getting a Judicial decision
on the point which has been fought over
annually In this city since the railroad
was built.
The Board of Equalization can only sit
next Tuesday and Wednesday evenings
before its life expires, and both sessions
are likely to be lively ones.
An effort will be made to increase the
assessment of the Haywards electric road,
and this is partly due to a feeling of bit
terness against the road on account of Its
position m regard to certain street Im
provements In East Oakland.
CORONER NOT NOTIFIED.
Case of Lizzie Donally, Who Was
Burned to Death, Will Never
theless Be Investigated.
OAKLAND, Aug. 14.â An Inquest will
be held by Coroner Baldwin to-morrow
evening In the case of little Lizzie
Donally, who died last night near Pleas
anton from burns received while trying
to Ignite a bonfire. She Is the daughter
of Michael Donally, who works on the
Hearst ranch.
The child was 7 years old and at the
time was playing in company with LJzzle
Hlguera. She had procured some matches
and was about to light the fire when her
dress of light fabric Ignited. She ran
toward the house and was soon enveloped
In flames. Dr. W. A. Hersheiser was
summoned and managed to alleviate the
child's sufferings considerably, but was
unable to save ncr life.
Dr. Hersheiser evidently did not regard
the cas6 one for the Coroner's Investiga
tion, for Coroner Baldwin was not noti
fied and did not learn of the death until

INFORMATION
FROM MERRITT
CABLED FOR
Necessary to Know ii
He Wants Troops.
â¢IUST WAIT ANOTHER WEEK
GENERAL MERRIAM RECEIVES
WASHINGTON ADVICES.
The Soldiers at Camp Merritt Are
Very Much Disappointed and Are
Becoming Restless and
Impatient.
WASHINGTON', August 14.
Major General Merriam, Com
manding Department of California,
San Francisco: The Secretary of
War has caused inquiry to be made
of Major General Merritt as to his
needs for further forces. You will
hold the Arizona and General
King's forces in readiness to siiil
at once should it he so ordered.
I shall advise you as soon as pos
sible. By order of the Secretary
of War,
H. C. CORBIN, Adjutant General.
The foregoing telegram, in answer to
General Merriam's inquiry of the "War
Department as to what disposition should
be made of the remaining Philippine ex
peditionary forces, was received yester
day morning at military headquarters
and was at once transmitted to Brigadier
General Miller at Camp Merritt.
It means that nothing definite will be
known from General Merritt for at least
a week. The telegram to him from the
Secretary of War will have to be con
veyed from Hongkong to Manila and the
answer brought back by a dispatch boat,
which received the message of the Secre
tary nf War Saturday night and at once
started on its trip.
There is a possibility that General Mer
ritt may call for the balance of the ex
peditionary forces, and in that event tne
Arizona, Scandia and the City of Sydney,
which arrived Saturday night fr:>m Man
ila, will no doubt bo sent forward some
time next week. On the other hand Gen
eral Merritt may conclude that with his
present forceâ ll,ooo on hand and
more to arrive in a few daysâ he will
have enough troops to control the situ
ation, which has bfen materially changed
since the cessation of hostilities.
AFFAIRS AT THE PRESIDIO.
Officers Regret That Exagger
ated Reports Have Been
Published About the
Sol-diers' Scrimmage.
The officers of the Kansas, Tennessee, j
lowa and New York r-^Kirrn nts regret I
that exaggerated reports have been pub
llsbed concerning the alleged riot of Fri- i
day night. In which it was mailf to ap- 1
pear that the Second Brigade Regiments j
â¢were going to "rub it Into ' New York.
It Is true that as a result of excessive ;
â¢guying there is some friction between
the New York boys and those of the other ;
regiments. The demonstration on Friday
night resulted in nothing more than a few
officers losing their heads and calling- out
an unnecessary force to drive the men j
back to their camps. At all times there j
â was a prevailing spirit of fun in the af- '
fair. The only man hurt was a soldier
who resisted the guards, when ordered
back to camp, and the Presidio guard
never appeared until the soldiers had all
dispersed to their quarters. The n
published have served only to curtail the
liberties of the men and to somewhat
widen whatever breech there may have
been.
Assistant Surgeon Lieutenant Henry
Page, who has been ordered to sail on
the Arizona was formally assigned to the
Third Battalion of the Twenty-third In
fan try yesterday, and ordered to report
for duty at once. The same ord^r also
assigned for Immediate duty to the Third
Battalion of the Eighteenth Infantry As
sistant Surgeon De Mey.
Private Dee Ford. Battery D, California
Heavy Artillery, who died at the P.egi- j
mental Hospital on Saturday night of ty
phoid fever, was buried yesterday morn
ing in the Presidio cemetery.
Private William A. Williams, Company
M, Twenty-third United States Infantry,
â  died at an early hour yesterday morning
â¢at the Division Hospital of pneumonia
following measles.
â¢ Battery A. Third Artillery, which has
been ordered to prepare to go to Alaska
for duty there this winter, has moved Its
camp from Fort Point to the site formerly
occupied by the Battalion of Engineers.
Military Baseball.
The baseball teams of the Seventh and
Eighth California Reginv-nts played an
exciting game at the Golden Gate Recrea
tion Grounds yesterday afternoon. The
hitherto invincible Southerners were van
quished by a score of 7to 4. Tr*- Seventh
Regiment is not satisfied with the result
ami the teams will niAi a 1 one of the
down-town parks jiext Tftinil;.
The baseball team or Company 11,
Twentieth Kansas, yesterday defeated a
picked nine from the First New York
Regiment by a score of 24 to 15.
The game between the teams of the
Fifty-first lowa and the First Washing
.ton yesterday afternoon at the Presidio,
for the benefit of the R<vl Cross, was won
by the Washingtons, the score being 13
to. 10.
GOOD SCORES MADE
BY SEVERAL CLUBS
RIFLEMEN HAVE FAIK SPORT
AT SHELL MOUND.
Gus Schulz, John TJtschig, Louis
Bendel, J. E. Gorman, A. B. Dor
rell and Others Go to the
Front.
.Nearly all of the prominent riflemen of
this .city were at the Shell Mound range
yesterday and some very good scores
â¢were made. The Norddeutscher Schuet
zen Club's monthly bullseye contest for
cash prizes resulted in J. I)e Witt carry
ing oft the befit money on 307 points or
a.s shown by the measuring- ma
chine. This contest also gave to Gus
Schulz the beautiful gold medal presented
by Captain L. Siebe, the proprietor of
the park and" range, for the three best
bullseyes made for the year ending at
date. Louis Beildel, of the Germania
Schuetzen Club, who is in the second
champion class, was the high man of the
day, making 442 rings. John Utschlg, of
the first champion class, made 425, but
he held up his record In the champion
class of the San Francisco Schuetzen Club
by running up a string of 443 rings.
In the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club,
the first class men had things all to them-
Belves, laying the champion class men in
the shade. J. E. Gorman ran up a beau
tiful score of 41, Columbia target count,
followed by A. B. Dorrell with '.2. Henry
Kroeckel, secretary of the Stockton Pis
tol and Rifle Club, with his wife., were
guests of the Columbias. He is now
sergeant of Company A, stationed at Al
catraz Inland, and was one of the first i
to enlist when the war broke out. Ser
geant Kroeckel is one of the best all
round rifle, pistol and revolver shots in
the t-an Joaquin Valley, and his perform
ances yesterday showed that he coVild
make things lively for the men of the bay.
Mrs. Kroeckel has recently taken a great
interest in this sport, and in time may
compel her husband to share honors at
the range. The principal scores of the
| day were as follows:

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
THE DIVISION COMMANDER
READY TO PROCEED.
A Report Showing- the Number of
Guardsmen Who Paraded on the
Fourth of July.
"I am ready to proceed with the reor
ganization of the National Guard," said
Major General Dickinson, in reply to a
question as to the prospects of building
up the guard npain. "But Just at this
time nothing can be done because the
Governor, who is onÂ« of the Board of
Liocation, is Euffering from an attack of
rheumatics.
"There has not been any change in the
proposed plan. It will be three ten com
pany regiments. That will leave room
for those who have volunteered, to return
to the guard upon being mustered out of
the service of the United States.
"The proposition Is to recruit each of
the ten companies, at this time, to the
minimum, that is to say fifty-three, rank
and file. That will give 1590 exclusive j
of the members of the Signal Corps of the j
three brigades, the troop of cavalry, the j
Liowell High School Cadets and those of
the naval millta who were not enlisted for
scouting service. This numerically, it is
thought, will be sufficient to preserve or
der and peace in the State if there should
arise an occasion for calling out the
guard.
The replies to the circular letter sent
out some time since by the division com
mander for the purpose of obtaining ex
act statistics of the condition of the guard
in the State at this time are coming in,
and it is expected that before the close of
the month they will all be received, so
that the Board of Location will have cor
rect data upon which to work.
The Fourth of July parade reports show
that on that day in the Frst Brigade eight
brigade officers and a like number of field
and staff officers paraded with 462 men. In
the Second Brigade but eighty-four men
paraded and in the Third but fifty-one
men were on parade. The Naval Milita
paraded 416. including ten officers, a good
showing for that branch of the service.
The report shows that there were 1029
present and 428 absent at roll call at the
several places of rendezvous.
There is more actlyiity in the Naval
Militia at this time than there has been
for a long time. The men are prompt at
drill and they turn out numerically
strong. They are being drilled in the
gun exercise;*also in infantry tactics, and
they are becoming very proficient. There
have been many applications of late fur
uiimiss^'n into the several divisions.
The matter of target practice which was
neglected during the war fever will be :
taken up a??ain in September, so it is said, !
and under new rules which it is thought i
will be formulated shortly to meet all the
objections that have been presented to
the old ones.
Her Imprisonment Not Voluntary.
The story of the imprisonment of Mrs.
Rogers In her room at the old Latham
mansion, C3S Folsom street, has brought
fr'im that lady strong denials that her
confinement to her room is voluntary.
"I am practically a prisoner in my
room," said Mrs. Rogers last night. "I
did not fasten my door from the inside,
af has been charged. The lock has been
sprung in some manner from the outside,
and 1 have been unable to open It. The
attitude of Mrs. Brouillard In this matter
has bordered on malicious persecution,
for which thf-re is no excuse.
"I have been five months in the house,
and owe but three weeks' rentâ a matter
of .?'*. 1 offered to pay for one week of
this some time since, but it was refused.
I wil take the matter to the proper au
thorities and have it settled at once."
Coming Golf Tournament.
A golf tournament open to ladies and
gentlemen is to be held on the San Ra

A FREAK THAT FAILED
The Police Decline to Allow Albert
ConstaotiQ Ferdinan to Bury
I-jimself fllive.
Albert Constantln Ferdinan, the freak who wants to bury himself alive
for a wc-ek, while in a hypnotic state, burst into tears yesterday, when
Captain Spillane and Lieutenant Hanna told him that his exhibition could
not go on. He had a grave dug on the vacant lot on the northeast corner
of Market and Larkln streets and was congratulating himself upon mak
ing money out of the gullible public, when a man in blue informed him
that he was wanted at the Southern police station. He pleaded with the
officers to change their minds but it was useless. Then he went back to
the vacant lot and received the sympathy of his manager and a few
friends he has made in the city since coming here. He threatens to apply
to the courts to-day for an order enjoining the police from interfering
with his desire to bury himself. A crowd had gathered on the side-walk,
but after the signs were torn down by the police they soon dispersed.
The police base their action on section 51 of Ordinance 1587, which pro
vides that: It shall be unlawful for any person to commit any act that
amounts to a public wrong; that openly outrages decency; that is injuri
ous to public morals, or public health, or -uiblic safety.
Ferdinan is paiticuarlly incensed at Chief Lees. "When I spoke to
the Chief," he said, "he told me there was no law to interfere with my
exhibition, and he told me to go to the Board of Supervisors to get a per
mit. Then I was advised to get a license and did so and also got a permit
from the Board of Health and now the Chief says my exhibition cannot go
on. Why did he not say so at first and it would have saved all the ex
pense 1 have been put to."
THE SAIST FRASTCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 15, 1898.
SEVEN DAYS
THEY LIVED
ON KISSES
George Abel Tried the
Butterfly Life.
MET A LADY ON THE TRAIN
LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER TOR
A WEEK.
The Father of the Girl Was Dis
pleased and the Wealthy
Rancher Paid for His
Escapade.
A week's try at living a butterfly life
cost George H. Abel, a wealthy rancher of
Colusa County, considerable mental â wor
ry and several hundred dollars In cold
rash, besides other money spent on Mlsa
Lorena Mikesell, a charming young lady
from Upper Lake, whose companionship
he had enjoyed for seven short days.
Mr. Abel, who was recently divorced
from his wife, to whom he Is paying a
large amount monthly as alimony, came
down to the city from Maxwell sonio
weeks ago and on the train met Miss
Mlkesell. It was a case of love at first
sight on the part of both, apparently, and
an arrangement was soon reached where
by the two might be together. Rooms
were engaged at a well-known hotel on
arrival in San Francisco, and here Mr.
Abel ami Miss Mikesell lived for a week
as man and wife.
During the sojourn at the hotel Abel
purchased for Miss Mikesell elegant cloth-
Ing, jewelry and knicknacks and when by
mutual consent both parties left for their
respective homes the presumption was
that everything had been arranged to the
satisfaction ot both parties. Such was
not the case, however, as Mr. Abel soon
learned. But a few days had elapsed
after his return to Maxwell when Mr.
Abel received a call from an attorney
who demanded, on behalf of the father of
Miss Mikesell, reparation for the wrong
done the daughter. It is rumored that
threats were used to extort money from
the rancher. At any rate Abel signed a
note on August 6 promising to pay Miss
Mikeseil the sum of |700 six days after
date.
When the note fell due It was not paid,
and on Friday It was taken by R. J. Hud
son, a lawyer from Colusa County, to
J. Rauer to be sold at a discount. In
vestigation on the part of Mr. Rauer as
to the value of Abel's signature brought
to light the information that the ranch
er's check was good for $50,000, and fur
ther inquiry showed that Mr. Abel was
in the city and willing to pay the note
with the exception of fioo, which he
claimed he had already given to Hudson.
The attorney acknowledged that a por
tion of the note had been paid him, and
Mr. Rauer. acting as agent, received the
BOO from Mr. Abel. Miss Mlkesell and her
father were in the city with their attor
ney and the money was paid over to the
lady Friday afternoon.
Mr. Abel, not wishing to run the risk
of b^lng again called upon to pay for the
pleasant companionship of the young
lady, demanded from Miss â Kesell a re
ceipt releasing him from all demands.
The request was granted and yesterday
morning the father, daughter and Mr.
Abel met in Rauer's office and the desired
document was plpned, sealed and deliv
ered. Miss Mikesell cashed a check for
$500 at the Bank of California and took
the evening train for her home, while Mr.
Abel, with his receipt safely guarded, left
for his ranch, rejoicing that his troubles
were at an end.
TRADE UNION NOTES.
Harry M. Saunders Elected Business
Agent by the Building Trades
Council. Â
At the last meeting of the Building
Trades Council Harry M. Saunders was
unanimously elected business agent. Mr.
Saunders has for many years been the
business agent of tho Carpenters' Dis
trict Council, and has been remarkably
successful in his efforts to settle little
differences existing between employer
and employe which might otherwise have
taken on the serious aspects of strikes
or boycotts. For the past six months
the Building Trades Council has been en
deavoring to find a man who cottl-i do
this same work for It, and although sev
eral prominent labor workers were given
a trial all were found unsatisfactory,
and an arrangement was entered Into
whereby Mr. Saunders could enter the
employ of the Building Trades Council
with the privilege of returning to the
district council at any time should his
work In the new field prove unsatisfac
tory. He has the hearty indorsement
and good wishes of all union men in the
city, and especially of the memners of
Carpenters' Union No. 22, of which he
has been a member for many years.
His work will consist in ventilating all
fMsputei. of workmen on buildings ntnl
th' Inspection of working cards la all trie
building trades.
The Labor Council held its weekly
meeting last night with its new dvm
dent, S. L. Robbins, in the chair. Cre
dentials were j. resented by L. Hechirijtrer
of the Brfwury Workmen's Un'o-i and I).
Daggctz and J. R. Welch of the Printing
/â¢ressmen'r! Union. The committee on
Tjsbor nay celebration reported that
tickets were out and arrangements gen
erally so far progressed that the success
of the day was assured. A number of
visiting printers were present and ad
dressed the meeting.
Anti-Civil Service League.
The Anti-Civil Service State League at
their last meeting appointed a committee
to confer with the Congressional delega
tion In relation to their proposed bill to

TERRIFIED BY
BOLD BURGLARS
Residences on Van Ness
Avenue Visited.
TWO BLOCKS ARE SELECTED
POLICE TJNABLE TO DISCOVER
THE PERPETRATORS.
The Last House Ransacked Was That
of Joseph Anspacher, Which
Occurred Last Saturday
Night.
The residents on Van Ness avenue, par
ticularly on the blocks between Eddy and
O'Farrell streets, are terrorized by the
intrusion of burglars into their homes,
and although the police have been noti
fied repeatedly no arrests have been made.
The latest burglary reported was at the
house of Joseph Anspacher, Sll Van Ness
avenue. The family left the house about
7 o'clock Saturday night and returned
shortly after 10 o'clock. On entering the
bedrooms they were painfully conscious
of the fact that some one had been in
the house during their absence. Bureau
drawers had been emptied of their con
tents and a careful search mode for
money or jewelry. The bedding had also
been overturned and searched for the
same purpose, and Mrs. Anspacher's jewel
box had been broken Into pieces and
rilled of Its contents.
The burglars had not entered thÂ© dining
room, and it is supposed they had been
scared away. A gentleman who occupies
the flat above had a call from a friend
between 9 and 10 o'clock and the friend
went to the rear door. The gentleman
opened the rear window and told him to go
around to the front door. That is what is
believed to have scared the burglars. It
i.s supposed they had effected an entrance
by using a skeleton key on the front door.
They took away with them, besides other
things, a bunch of keys including two
pass keys to the front door, and all night
a policeman kept guard on the house,
Mr. Anspacher having notified the Central
Police Station of the burglars' visit.
About two years ago Mr. Anspacher's
house was visited by a burglar three times
In one night. On the third visit Anspacher
took a shut at him as he was moving
around in the back yard.
Thursday night Mrs. Schlessinger, who
keeps a boarding house at 803 A r an Ncsa,
was awakened by a noise at her bedroom
window. She was terrified to see <'i man
with a bullseye lantern trying- to open the
window from the out Fide with a "jimmy."
She was so paralyzed with fear that she
could do nothing but stare at the man
for a moment, but recovering herself she
uttered a piercing scream and the burg
lar fled.
About two weeks aero the residence of
Dr. Taylor. 928 Van Ness, was visited by
two burglars. They attempted to break
in the rear door, but the screams of the
servant girl, who was in the house alone, i
brought assistance and the burglars fled, j

DESERTED TO
SAVE A LADY'S
GOOD NAME
Chivalrous Act of a
Young Artilleryman.
A MYSTERY SOLVED AT LAST
RETURN OF A DESERTER TO
FIGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY.
The Extenuating Circumstances in
the Case of Eugene D. Giber
aon, Whose Sentence Has
Been Remitted.
Among the orrlers issued from military
headquarters on Saturday last was one
stating that "in the case of Private
Eugene D. Giberson, Battery G, Third
Artillery, guilty of desertion, and sen
tenced to forfeit all pay for eight months
And to perform hard labor for that time,
Central Merriam. in view of extenuating
circumstances attending the absence of
the accused from his battery and of his
voluntary return to the same in time of
war, as well as his good record in all
other respects while in the service, remit
ted the sentence and ordered the private
to return to his battery."
â¢ The story of Giberson's career since he
came to the Pacific Coast is brief, though
it Is full of romance and forms a most
â¢interesting chapter in the young man's
biography.
Giberson, who is only 22 years of age,
comes from a most estimable and refined
family of Cleveland, Ohio, where he was
educated. He is a graduate of the Cleve
land high school, and for two years at
tended the St. John's Military Academy
in that city. Bright, Intelligent, active,
handsome and well-equipped In every way
to fight life's battle, he came West in
1894 to seek his fortune. The Midwinter
Fair attracted him to San Francisco. One
day, while taking in the sights at the fair
in company with a young lady, he met
the wife of a military officer to whom he
was introduced by his companion. She
â¢was a strikingly handsome woman, highly
cultured, refined in manners and fascinat
ing in conversation. She was several
years older than young Giberson, but she
â¢at once manifested a deep interest in him.
' In the course of time their acquaintance
grew into a very warm but innocent
friendship. The lady assisted the boy â he
â¢was then not much over eighteen years of
ageâ in every way, especially in his stud
ies, talked to him about his prospects in
life, encouraged him in his ambition to
make his mark, and endeavored to map
out for him some particular pathway to
pursue in the accomplishment of that
laudable object. It was finally determin
ed that a military career afforded the best
opportunities to win fame, and perhaps
fortune, and young Giberson, encouraged
by his fair patron, enlisted as a private
in Battery G of the Third Artillery Regi
ment, with a view of sooner or later be
coming a candidate for tha second lieu-
tenancy.
His battery- was stationed at the Pre-
Eidio. and now young Giberson was near
his friend, who resided at the post. She
continued to take an interest in his ca
reer, and as a result they frequently met
and took long walks along the romantic
pathways of the Presidio reservation.
Perhaps it was indiscreet on the part of

PRIVATE EUGENE D. GIBERSON.
His Sentence for Desertion Is Remitted on Ac
count of Hlz Chivalrous Conduct to a Lady.
the lady, who, being innocent of any evil
doings, had no idea that she had made
herself the subject of unpleasant gossip.
Finally, her husband became aware of
her friendship for the young man, and
threatened divorce proceedings unless it
was terminated. This fact Came to the
ears of Giberson. who realized that he
was imperiling the fair name of a lady
whom he honored and respected. For
several days he was deeply troubled over
the situation, and the more he thought of
it the more serious it seemed to him.
One day Private Giberson, who had
been an artilleryman for ten happy
months, failed to answer to his name at
roll call. He had disappeared from the
Presidio.
There was no more gossip about his
lady friend. His departure had put an
end" to all talk, and she soon regained her
former position in the esteem of her
friends and acquaintances.
Giberson went to Honolulu, a.nd engag
ing in business as a photographer, mak
ing a specialty of "groups." met with ar
tistic and financial success.
When he heard of the breaking .out of
the war with Spain, his patriotism led
him to at once return to his country to
surrender himself, and. If given the op
portunity, to offer his services to fight
for the flag.
A quiet sensation was created at the
Presidio the day he returned and grave
himself up to the authorities to be dealt
with according to military law. Up to
this time his disappearance and the cause
of it had been a mystery at the post, and
it was not solved until he was tried fur
desertion by court-martial three weeks
ago. It was an Intensely interesting and
dramatic trial. Giberson was defended by
Lieutenant Benver X. Smith of the Utah
Light Cavalry, who in a most eloquent and
touching plea, brought out the fact,
without naming the lady in the case, tnat
the boyish artilleryman had deserted In
order to preserve the good name of an
estimable woman who had sincerely be
friended him. and that he had now re
turned in time of war to fight for his
country if given a chance.
These are the extenuating circum
stances that were brought to the atten
tion of Major General Merriam after the
gallant young man's conviction, and they
caused the general to remit the sentence
of the court and restore him to duty.
The petition that was presented to Gen
eral Merriam In Giberson,' s behalf was
Bigned by sixteen well-known officers,

nearly all of whom were conversant with
the facts in the case. Had the petition
failed the young maji in all probability
would have appealed to President Mc-
Kinley for a pardon through Senator
Hanna of Ohio, Senator Cannon of T tah
and the Hon. Elijah Farr, a prominent
attorney of Utah, these three influential
men being warm friends of the Giberson
family. Private Giberson has been at
tached to Company X, Twenty-third In
fantry, and when he reaches Manila he
will rejoin his batten.
THINK THEY HAVE
TWO SMOOTH CROOKS
EDWABD BURKE AND GEORGE
KING ARRESTED.
For the past week Detectives Thomas,
Gibson and Egan have been looking for
three pickpockets and all-round bunko
men who are supposed to hail from the
East and last evening- the officers suc
ceeded in landing Edward Burke and
George King, whom they suspect or Do
ing members of the gang.
The names of the suspects were placed
on the detinue book at the Central Sta
tion and before the men are definitely
charged an attempt will be made to cap
ture the third party. The gang has been
nperattrg in Sausalito, Alameda and Oak
hind for over a month, but the officers at
those places were unable to secure any
clew which would lead to their capture.
An occasional trip to this city in the
evening brought the evildoers under the
eyes (9 the police force here and the de
tectives were detailed to make the arrest.
A 'good description of the men was .se
cured and last evening when Burke and
King stepped "ft the ferryboat they were
handcuffed and taken to the station, both
protesting their innocence. ThfÂ» two men
are well dressed, young, and well appear
ing which suits the description furnished
the' officers, and the latter have little
doubt but that they have the right men.
The operations of the crooks have been
carded on in a very quiet manner, leav
ing little chance for detection. They are
ted with being as clever articles In
the bunko line as have been on the coast
for some time.
ROBBED AT
THE POINT
OF A PISTOL
Peter Grant Held Up
on Howard Street.
RELIEVED OF HIS VALUABLES
HE SUBSEQUENTLY TRIES TO
STRANGLE THE ROBBER.
Meets Him on the Water Front
and Is Prevented From Kill
ing Him by a
Citizen.
Pete Grant, a Bailor, was held up by
a lone robber at Second and Howard
streets, a short time ago and robbed of
$14 S5.
The robber was armed with a revolver
and placing the muzzle against Grant's
forehead, threatened to kill him if ho
made an outcry. He then went through
his pockets, taking all the money he had
and a cheap silver watch.
Last evening Grant saw his despoiler
walking along the water front, and ac
costing him he demanled the return, of
his money.
The robber laughed at him. and threat
ened to "break his jaw" if he again spoke
to him.
Angered at what he termed the audac
ity of the robber, the pugnacious sailor
grabbed him by the throat and proceeded
to strangle him. A citizen who was pass
ing at the time, being ignorant of the
cause of the trouble, seized Grant and
prevented him from strangling his de
spoiler. After Grant had released hi&
hold on the robber's throat the latter took
to his heels and made his escape.
Grant was subsequently taken to police
headquarters where he told his tale of
woe to the Chief of Police.
According to his story he was walking
along Howard street, and when near Sec
ond lie was approached by the stranger,
who was armed with a revolver. Placing
the weapon to his head he ordered him
to throw up his hands under penalty of
being made a subject for the Coroner
Thinking that the stranger was playinj
"a joke on him" Grant attempted to grab
the revolver, when trie ominous click of
the trigger brought him to a realization
of his predicament.
With an oath the robber threatened to
blow his brains out if he resisted, and
then proceeded to search his pockets. Af
ter taking his money and watch the des
perate robber ordered him to move on
or suffer being riddled with bullets. Grant,
realizing he was in the hands of a des
perate man, lqst no time in complying
with his command.
While strolling along- the water front
last evening he recognized the man who
had held him up, and he determined to
get even with him. Grant declares that
if the citizen had not Interfered he would
have strangled the thieving stranger. He
describes him as being about 35 years of
age and had a stubby red beard. He was
poorly dressed, and on the night of the
robbery he wore a dark slouch hat, which
was pulled down over his eyes.
A description nf the robber was at once
sent to the Harbor Police Station with in
structions to arrest him.
TO THE MEMORY OF
THE VIRGIN MARY
ASSUMPTION DAY TO BE APPRO
PRIATELY HONORED.
Services Are to Be Held To-Day in
the Various Catholic Churches
Throughout the City.
The feast of the Assumption will be
solemnly celebrated to-day in all the
Catholic churches throughout the city.
Masses wifl be said as on Sundays, com
mencing at 6 o'clock in the^norning with
the usual low, and concluding at 10:30
o'clock with the solemn high mass. Ves
pers will be observed In the evening and
a panegyric on the life of the Virgin pro
nounced.
The day is one of the strictest obliga
tion, and the church insists that all its
members that can possibly attend must
be present at mass and offer up their
prayers at the shrine of the mother of
Christ. To allow those who from the
pursuits of life are prevented from at
tending services in the churches to-day
special devotions in commemoration of
the feast were solemnized yesterday in
many of the churches.
At. St. Francis Church a solemn high
mass was celebrated at 10:30 o'clock and
a panegyric delivered by the Rev. Father
Carraher. In it he drew a vivid picture of
the life and virtue of Mary, outlining her
devotion and purity, and concluded with a
discourse on the mystery of the Assump
tion. In the evening, at the celebration
of vespers, the pastor delivered an inter
esting and instructive lecture on the sub
ject of "Mary, Queen of Heaven."
To appropriately commemorate the
event the altar of the Virgin, situated in
the sanctuary immediately to the left of
the high altar, was beautifully adorned
with white Bermuda lilies, exoticgrowths,
candelabra and a myraid of flickering
lights.
At St. Ignatius Church this evening, in
addition to the celebration of the As
sumption, a special lecture by Father
Meller will be delivered immediately af
ter vespers and will mark the close of the
retreat which has been in progress for
the past week under his direction. The
object of the retreat was to give a
thorough preparation in religious duty to
those desirous of fittingly honoring the
feast of the Assumption. Hundreds who
accepted the conditions exacted received
communion yesterday morning, and as
many more will kneel before the altar
this morning to receive the holy eucharlst
In the name of the Virgin.
Special music has been arranged for the
solemn high mass to be celebrated at 10:30
o'clock, and will be rendered by a spe
cially augmented choir of over ttlty
voices. The altars, especially the \irgins.
have been beautifully decorated, and tho
church proper will present a maze or
color and light. Immediately after bene
diction this evening the Papal blessing,
which will conclude the services, will be
pronounced upon the members of the
congregation by Father Moeller.
BLAZE IN A DWELLING.
Fire Destroys a Tenement-House on
Franklin Street.
Fire broke out in a three-story irarne
dwelling .-it SOS Franklin street last night,
and for a timo threatened to destroy the
entire block. The building is occupied as
a tenement house and is owned by a Mrs.
Coyle. She occupies the lower flat, while
the other two are occupied by Mrs. Bruhn
and Mrs. Freund.
Shortly after S o'clock a coal-oil lamp
in the middle flat exploded, setting Tire to
the lace-curtains. The flames communi
cated to the wall, and in an Incredibly
short time the entire house was ablaze.
An alarm was sounded from box 82, but
by the time the fire department reached
the scene, the flames had communicated
to the barn adjoining, owned by Frank
Schussler. By dint of hard work the tire
department extinguished the blaze, but
not until the dwelling and barn were re
duced to ashes. The loss is estimated at 1
$1000.
The Hebrews and Spain.
Rabbi Isadore Myers delivered the first
of a new series of Sunday lectures at the
Bush Street Synagogue last evening on
"The Jews, America and Spain." In the
jr-ouxae ol hia remarks he entertainingly
e- viewed the treatment accorded the Jews
by Spanish rulers and emphasized the sig
nificant fact that since the expulsion and
persecution of the Hebrews, the wealth,
power and glory of Spain had departed.
The punishment meted out to that tyran
nical country in the late war by America,
the speaker believed, was just visitation
of Divine wrath.

AND A BOY INJUBED.
Alexander McPherson, While Wheel
ing, Collides With a Buggy and
Is Rendered Unconscious.
A death and an accident occurred to
mar the enjoyment of hosts of pleasure
seekers at Golden Gate Park yesterday.
Early in the afternoon when crowds were
pouring into the vast enclosure, the
sound of a pistol shot, coming from the
direction of Strawberry Hill, startled
many of the gathering. The body of an
unknown man, weltering in his own
blood, was soon afterward found in the
thick underbush. Tho body was that of
a man apparently about 35 years of age.
A gaping bullet wound in the right tem
ple, and a revolver clutched in the stif
fened right hand told the story of suicide.
The body was removed to tue morgue to

Not long after the finding of the sui
cide's body an accident occurred on the
main drive of the park that almost cost
Alexander McPherson, a iad of fifteen
years, his life. Young McPherson, who
resides with his parents at 216 Chattanooga
street, left his home to take a snin on his
wheel in the nark. He was riding along
the drive, not far from the music stand,
when he collided with a buggy driven by
James Tyson of 6 California street. The
shaft of the buggy struck the boy on the
back of ihe head, glanced and almost
tore his right ear away. The lad was
thrown violently to the ground and ren
dered unconscious. Tyson immediately
went to his aid. An ambulance was sum
moned and the unconscious boy was re
moved to the emergency hospital. It is
thought that he will recover.
