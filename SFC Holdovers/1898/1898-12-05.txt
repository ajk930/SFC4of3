NEW YORK, Dec. 4. â In a blinding rainstorm to-night
the massive block of buildings on Broadway, Nos. 253 to
259. and included between Murray and Warren streets,
was almost destroyed by fire. Within three hours more than a
million dollars worth of property was destroyed. The fire began
in the five-story brick building occupied by the men's furnish
ing firm of Rogers, Peet & Co., on the southwest corner of
Broadway and Warren street. Adjoining the Rogers-Peet
building and south of it was the magnificent white building of
the Home Life Insurance Company, and next to this was the
brownstone building of the Postal Telegraph Company, erected
at a cost of millions only a few years ago.
Within a few minutes after the discovery of the fire the
Rogers-Peet building was a roaring furnace, and an alarm had
been turned in which brought more than a score of engines to
the scene. It was but a short time when the flames had eaten
through the wall of the Home Life and were roaring high above
that Jofty structure. Thousands of people had gathered on the
scene, and the blinding glare of the flames lit up the lower part
of the city. Even in the downpour, the great crowds of people
grew, and the police were called out from many stations and
kept the people back for blocks. Great showers of sparks were
carried in all directions by the gale that blew sixty miles an
hour. It was a picturesque fire.
The Home Life Insurance building was occupied by that
company and by a large number of prominent men in various
lines of business. Every effort was made to save the valuable
papers stored in some of the offices, but many of these were
lost. The offices of the Rapid Transit Commission were on the
ninth floor of this building, and it is believed that all the plans
and schemes of work with which the commission have been
working this many years have been destroyed. In the Postal
building as well there were many serious losses of a private na
ture, and when the flames reached the operating room of this
structure, which they did within three hours of the outbreak,
the one or two solitary operators who remained at their posts
were compelled to flee for their lives, leaving unsent messages
at the keys.
The fire burned even more fiercely in the Home Life build
ing, owing to the great height of this structure, and in an in
credibly short time the upper half of this magnificent building
was in flames.
The water towers in the sheets were able to throw their
heavy streams only into the lower part of the structure, and the
firemen, though they worked with great bravery and untiring
energy in the blinding smoke and heat, could do little in the face
of such a fierce sweep of flames and gale. It was only a question
of time when the Postal building, so far as the upper stories
were concerned, went the way of the others.
The estimate of the losses by Chief Bonner, after midnight,
was a million dollars with a probability of a still further loss
should the fire continue to make anything like rapid progress.
At that hour he believed he had the fire under control within
reasonable limits. At 2 o'clock, however, it was still burning
fiercely in front, and, although not observable by the thousands
of people, was burning still more fiercely and extending lower
down in the rear.
An insurance man roughly estimates the losses at about as
follows:
Rogers, Peet & Co., building, stock and losses to other
tenants, $350,000.
Home Life Insurance Company, building and losses to
other tenants, $500,000.
The Postal Telegraph Company, building and losses to ten
ants, $100,000.
Losses to surrounding buildings, $50,000.
Chief Bonner thought that this estimate, on the basis of a
million dollar loss, was about as near correct as was possible to
make.
The Rogers-Peet building was the property of the Hoffman
estate, and was one of the historic buildings of Broadway. It
was erected thirty-five years ago.
The fire started in the rear of the
asement of the building occupied by
ogers, Peet & Co., clothiers, about
30 o'clock. Two policemen, standing
lithin half a block of Warren street,
card a lqud explosion and a moment
.ter saw a thin line of smoke curling
p from the side of the Rogers, Peet
: Co. building.
At that time the rain was falling In
The San Francisco Call
torrents and the wind blew a pale. An
alarm was sent in, but before the first
engine turned into Broadway Rogers,
Peet & Co.'s basement was a roaring
furnace, with great flames bursting
through the floors above and rushing
fiercely to the roof. Within ten min
utes five alarms had been sent in,
bringing engine after engine to the
scene.
SAX FRANCISCO, MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1898.
TWO OF THE TALL STRUCTURES IN THE PATH OF THE FIRE.
By 10 o'clock, so rapidly and fiercely
did the flames make progress, there
was nothing but the shell of the Rog
ers-Peet building left, with mountains
of flame roaring a hundred feet in the
air and encircling the adjoining struc
ture, the Home Life Insurance build
ing. In that blinding rain the firemen
worked, stretching the black and slip
pery lines of hose through the building,
fighting the flames from every side.
Soon a great wave of fire swept
across Warren street and caught the
United States Life Insurance building
at the west corner of Broadway, num
bered 259 and 261. The woodwork on a
dozen windows was afire in a moment,
and from that time on several streams
were played on this building to save it
from destruction.
When the Warren-street wall of the
Rogers-Peet building fell, at 10:30
o'clock, a dozen firemen were directly
beneath. Several of the men were
struck by bricks, but none was more
than slightly injured. Acting Chief
Perle fell, but wag dragged to safety
by some of his men.
Just before 11 o'clock the Home Life
Insurance Company's building, sixteen
stories high, at 255 and 257 Broadway,
caught fire. The firemen already had
their lines in this building up to the
seventh floor. They were greatly han
dicapped by the many stories. Flames
had eaten their way through the side
wall in many places and the huge white
structure burned fiercely. The ele
vators made trips up and down and in
this way many of the effects of the
offices were saved, but the men run
ning the cages were finally compelled
to flee for their lives.
The three top floors were on fire
almost simultaneously. The smoke
was dense. Flames shot high above
the roof and over the massive
brownstone Postal building. Every
body at work in the structure had
been ordered out of this building
long before. Desperate efforts were
being made to save it. The interior of
the Home Life Insurance Company
building was by this time a furnace.
From the windows of the six or eight
upper stories the flames were pouring
in masses. In the rear nine stories
were afire and the Fire Department, so
far as this portion of the building was
concerned, was absolutely powerless.
At 11:15 the Postal building, of four
teen stories, caught fire. Chief Bonner,
who had charge of the firemen, took the
elevator and went to the roof to give
personal directions. At this time there
were a few operators, who had ignored
the orders of the fire chief, two or three
clerks and a few boys at work in the
building in the stifling smoke, and mes
sages were sent until the flames came
and all were forced to rush for their
lives. The unsent messages were left
at the telegraph keyÃ.
Chief Bonner had under his direction
all the engines stationed in the fire
houses below Twenty-third street. In
addition five hook and ladder com
panies, Including water towers, were at
the scene. Most of the men worked in
the lower parts of the building to save
adjoining buildings. Only a few gangs
were with the fire chief on the top of
the Postal building.
They fought with all their strength
to keep the flames back. But notwith
standing all their efforts, at 1 o'clock
this (Monday) morning, three floors of
the building had been partially de
stroyed. The fire was then working its
way downward. Chief Bonner thought,
however, that he had it under control.
He did not expect it to <ret much below
this.
The fire started from three exolo
sions. What caused the explosions
no one knows.
The firemen could not find out. They
thought gas had escaped in some man
ner in the basement and so resulted in
the explosion and fire.
The Postal Telegraph Company of
ficials say that all their wires have
been burned out and that they have no
connections from their building.
The Hardware Club's headquarters,
which were on the top floor of the Pos
tal building, were ruined. Their loss
is heavy.
The Home Insurance building was
one of the handsomest on Broadway
and was supposed to be absolutely
fireproof. Its summit was 280 feet
above the sidewalk. Leading archi
tects of the country submitted plans for
its construction.
At 2:30 o'clock Chief Bonner went
home, saying that the fire would burn
itself out in a short time and that it
could not spread and was practically
out.
SCHOONER'S CREW
LOST IN A STORM
Attempt to Leave a Sinking Vessel
and Their Lifeboat Is
Capsized.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â The Nova Sco
tian schooner Walleda arrived to-day
from Gonaives, and reports that during
the height of the hurricane on November
28, in latitude 36.22, longitude 7.3, she
sighted a dismantled schooner of about 700
tons flying signals of distress. It was
nearly dark at the time, and the crew
could be seen on the decks gesticulating
frantically for assistance. The Walleda
bore down on the stranger, and got close
under her lee and hailed her. They
shouted that the vessel was sinking, and
asked to be taken off.
Captain Kemp told them that his boats
were stove in and useless. They said they
would come to the Walleda in their own
boats. During this time the Walleda laid
to, but found that she was rapidly drift
ing to leeward, and went about on quar
ter tack, and after several tacks managed
to cross the bow of the wreck and again
drifted down to the leeward position. The
Walleda hailed again, but got no answer.
In the meantime another three-masted
schooner came to her assistance and as
sumed a position to the windward of the
wreck. Both of them stood by until day
light. When morning broke the wreck
waa seen to be deserted and the boats
gone. It is supposed that the unfortunate
men had attempted to lanuch their boats
during the night, which capsized and all
hands were lost.

PICQUART APPLIES
FOR A COURT RULING
Wishes to Know Whether He Is
Amenable to Military or Civil
Jurisdiction.
PARIS, Dec. 4.â Colonel Picquart. now
in custody and awaiting trial on a charge
of having committed to his counsel docu
ments that hau come into his possession
in the military department of the secret
service, has applied to the court of cassa
tion, now engaged with the Dreyfus af
fair, to declare whether he is amenable to
military or civil jurisdiction. His appli
cation is based on various articles in the
Code of Criminal Procedure.
Henri Roehefort, editor of the Intransl
geant, having declared in that paper that
General Horace Porter, United States
Embassador to France, recently said
England financed the Dreyfus syndicate
with a view of dividing and weakening
France. General Porter, on being shown
the paper, said that Rochefort's statement
was a fabrication, pure and simple.

SHIP ABLAZE FROM

Steamer Dalrearli, From Brazil, Re
ports the Loss of an Un

NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â The German
steamer Dalrearli, from Rio de Janiero,
which arrived to-day, when in latitude
37.45, longitude 70.52, came alongside of a
ship ablaze from the stern to the fore
mast, while a large, yellow-funneled Ger
man steamship was standing near the
flaming wreck. Nobody could be seen on
the deck of the burning vessel, nor were
there any boats struggling amid the
waves, so it Is probable that the crew
was rescued by the steamship, which was
waiting to note the end. After steaming
around the wreck twice the Dalrearli
proceeded on her way.
The steamer by the burning ship was
either the Werra or the Fulda of the
North German Lloyd line. Both vessels
sailed in company from this port last
week, bound for Havana,

contract of the Northwestern for a large
quantity of steel rails for delivery early
next spring has again aroused Interest in
local railroad circles in the proposed ex
pansion of the Northwestern from Cas
per, Wyo., to Ogden. Coupled with this is
the fact that surveying partis are known
to be in the field west of Casper. This
extension has been annually discussed for
ten years past. In 1888 a large bonus was
promised to aid the enterprise. There is
a general Seeling that this year will see
some positive action.
Surveys of at least three different routes
are on record at the office of the Secre
tary of State, and all are feasible. They
are known to be in control of certain
persons in Ogden and those persons are
in close touch with the Northwestern
management. One of these routes leaves
Ogden by the way of Osrden Canyon, and
the other two are by the way of Weber
Canyon, which is also the Union Pacific
route. All the surveys keÂ«;p well to the

FELL HEADLONG
TO DEATH FAR
DOWN BELOW
Fearful Fall of Charles Shaugh
nessy Down an Elevator
Shaft in the Palace.
Some Mystery Surrounds the Manner of
the Accident â Broken Panes of Glass
Lead to Complications in
the Case.
Charles Shaughnessy, one of the night
elevator men at the Palace Hotel, was
instantly killed last night at 10:40
o'clock by falling down the elevator
shaft from the third floor. Just exactly
how he met his death no one can tell,
for as far as can be learned there were
no eye-witnesses to the sad tragedy.
The first intimation that any one had
of the accident was a sound like that
of falling glass. There were several
people in the lobby at the time and
they rushed to the elevator. On looking
in the shaft they saw what was ap
parently a lot of broken dishes, and
it was first thought that some one of
the waiters had dropped a tray. The
elevator was at the top of the shaft
on the sixth floor. Gradually, as the
eyes of those who peered into the bot
tom of the shaft became accustomed to
the darkness, the form of a man was
seen. Shaughnessy lay upon his back,
with his left leg resting on the iron
brace that supports the framework of
the shaft. The back of his head was
crushed to d; pulp.
Night Clerk McDermott at once noti
fied Manager Warren of the hotel, who
immediately telephoned for the ambu
lance. By this time many guests and
the waiters and bellboys, attracted by
the noise, had gathered. Nearly all
guests In the hotel heard the crash and
came from their rooms alarmed.
Shaughnessy's body was taken from
the shaft and Dr. J. D. Whitney, who
had been summoned, made a hasty ex
amination. He said death had been
instantaneous. His neck was broken.
The bottom of the shaft is of wood and
the floor had been broken by the force
of the impact.
A. Akergren, employed in the hotel as
a private detective, came rushing on
the scene a few moments after the
noise had been heard. According: to his
statement he was the last person who
saw the unfortunate man alive. He
was on the sixth floor and rang: for the
elevator to go to the third floor. He
says that Shaughness" came up to the
sixth floor and took him down to the
third, where he let him off. Akereren
stated that he then left the elevator
and turned Into the hallway. As he
did so he heard the noise of the fall
and rushed back. The door of the ele
vator was open. The heavy plate glass
above the door was broken and lay over
the floor, shattered into a thousand
pieces. Akergren rushed to the first
floor, thinking that the elevator had
fallen.
The most mysterious part of the sad
accident, for which no one seems to be
able to account, is how the glass came
to be broken. The glass was in one
solid piece about seven by five feet. It
had been completely shattered and
broken outward, for nearly all of it
was on the floor, showing that some
thing had struck it. Between the top
of the elevator door and the glass there
is a strong frame which would not per
mit of a body passing between it and
the elevator. The explanation advanced
by some is that Shaughnessy, who had
PBICE FIVE CENTS.
a habit of standing in front of the ele
vator with his back to the door when
waiting for a call, was doing this on
the third floor, and that without his
knowing it the elevator started, and
that when some one rang he stepped
back into the opening. This is not
plausible, for if it were true it does not
account for the broken glass.
This same elevator on another oc
casion became unmanageable and ran
from the first floor to the top of the
hotel. Some are inclined to believe
that Shaughnessy was standing on the
landing of the third floor, that the ele
vator started and he sprang to get in,
and in doing so was caught and drag
ged upward and thrown through the
glass, and that not having had time to
close the door his body when it struck
the floor fell through the door again
and down the shaft. On its face this
is a plausible solution, but it would be
impossible for a human body to be
dragged between the frame of the door
and the elevator, and this would have
had to have been the case before
Shauffhnessy could have fallen through
the glass.
Detective Akergren stated that the
elevator did not stop at the fourth
floor as he came down, and yet Thomas
Morcum, a bellboy on the fourth floor,
who heard the noise and who rushed
to the elevator shaft immediately, de
clares that he found the door on the
fourth floor open about six inches and
that he closed it. The glass plate was
about a sixth of an inch in thickness
and it would have required a heavy
blow to have broken it. Akergren says
when he left the elevator and turned
into the hall he had barely gotten
around the corner before he heard the
noise of the fall, so that the time be
tween leaving the elevator and that
when Shaughnessy. fell to his death
was hardly enough for the elevator to
have got to the fourth floor, and yet
the door on the fourth floor was open.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â The annual
report of Charles G. Dawes, Comp
troller of the Currency, for the year
ended October 31, 1898, has been sent
>ngress. With respect to the con
dition of national banks during the
year, as shown by the five reports re-
Quired from the banks, the Comptroller
says:
Xotwistandirtg that the number of banks
in operation on September 20, 1898, is less

ber 19, ISM, the amount of individual de
ts, loans and discounts and total re

balance due other banks ana bankers
showÃ an increase of $r,2.6L7,.^S 09 and
United States deposits of $59,023,01:) 27.
The Comptroller states that he does
not review in their details the plans
for the modification of the currency
and banking systems, which are now
the subject of economic and general
discussion throughout the country, but
confines his discussion to the general
principles underlying all of them, be
cause they seem to ignore the interests
of bank depositors, with %vhose protec
tion the Comptroller is peculiarly
charged. He states that those plans
which are now most generally discussed
may be considered as based upon the
following propositions:
Firstâ That the disproportion between
outstanding currency liabilities of the
Government payable in gold and the gold
held for their redemption should bÂ« less
ened by a contraction in the amount of
these demend currency liabilities.
Secondâ That the void in circulation
caused by such contraction should be
filled by an extension of the circulation
of national banks, which circulation, re
deemable in gold, is ultimately to depend
for its chief security upon a first lien upon
the commercial assets of the Issuing
banks.
He states that the assumptions which
seem to underlie these plans are these:
Firstâ That unless we are to have a cur
rency contraction, some radical extension
of bank-note issues is absolutely neces
sary to the securing of the proper adjust
ment of Government currency liabilities
to its gold reserve, by which adjustment
the greater safety of the gold standard is
tubserved.
Secondâ That through this radical exten
sion and change in the present form oÂ£
bank-note issues alone is elasticity to bu
secured in our currency.
The Comptroller discusses the ques
tion of the elasticity needed in bank
currency, commenting upon the great
elasticity of the check and draft cir
culation of the country. In this con
nection, and as embodying his recom
mendations on this branch of his report,
he eavÃ:
While in this country, with its ex
tended system of banks and its great de
velopment of the check and draft system,
some degree of elasticity in banknote
issues is desirable, it is not essential that
it should be an amount so large as to
make necessary for its Becurlty an in
justice upon the depositor, and thus, by
interfering with the check and draft sys
tem, defeat one of its own prime objects.
The general principles and regulations
under which such elasticity might be ob
tained are not in any way Inconsistent
with the principles and arguments we
have endeavored to set forth. As cover
ing the6e general principles, and as a con
clusion from the views hereinbefore ex
pressed, the Comptroller would make the
following recommendations in regard to
the present laws governing the issue of
national bank notes.
Firstâ The existing banknote system,
based upon deposit of Government bonds
as security, should not now be abandoned.
Secondâ For the purpose of allowing
elasticity to banknote issues to protect
the banks and the community in time of
panic, a s=m;ill amount of uncovered
notes, in addition to the secured notes,
should be authorized by law under thÂ«
following limitations: They should be
subjected to so heavy a tax that thÂ«v
<ould not be Issued in normal times for
the purpose of profit, but would be avail
able in times of emergency. The tax
should be so large upon the solvent issu
ing banks as to provide a fund which,
in eonm otion with the pro rata share of
the assets of an insolvent bank, would bo
Fufflclent to redeem the notes in full with
out necessity tig;,' any preference of note
holders over depositors of any Insolvent
issuing bank. The tax should be so large
as to force this currency Int9 retirement
as soon as the emergency pusses.
Such a currency could be usrd only to

lessen the evil effects of the too rapid
liquidation of credits which are collapsing 1
under a linancial panic, but could not be
profitably used as :f* basis of business
speculation and inflation. It should be to
the business community what the clear
ing house certificates are to our cities in
times of panicâ a remedy for an emer
gency, not an instrument of current busi
ness.
The Comptroller discusses the Ha
waiian and Porto Rican banking and
trade situations. He says:
The foundation for the greater growth
of trade between the United States and her
colonies must be speediiy and firmly laid
in proper banking law*, "which will result
isi enabling her merchants to do business
with the people of the colonies without
the disadvantages existing Jit present.
Our present national banking laws do not
authorize the establishment of American
international or American Intercolonial
banks, nor could any national bank estab
lish a branch in a territory or colony sue h
as Porto Rico or Hawaii, even if our pres
ent laws unchanged were extended ov.>r
It. While it is questionable whether Con
gress Should legalize the establishing of
foreign "OT colonial branches by national
banks transacting business under the
present law, that it should at least pass
laws authorizing, under proper restric
tions, the general incorporation of banks
organized to carry on international and
intercolonial banking, as distinguished
from domestic banking, admits of no rea
sonable doubt. Unless some such legisla
tion is provide^ the American exporter
and Importer, In fads trade with America's
own colonies, will be compelled to endure
all the disadvantages under which, in all
South American markets and in many
other markets of the world, he now laN>rs
in his competition with foreigners enjoy
ing superior banking facilities.
His recommendations in connection
with this branch of his report are made
as follows:
The determination of the relation of any
new banking system to the existing banks
and domestic credits of Porto Rico. <lif
fering as they do from those of this coun
try, involves many difficult questions; and
legal provisions for the appointment of a
commission especially charged with the
examination of the conditions of domestic
banking and finance on the islands, and
with the recommendation of the proper
form of laws in connection therewith, is
respectfully urged upon Congress.
In view of the conditions and necessities
of our trade with our new territories of
Porto Rico and HRWaii, and with other
South American countries, as well as with
those other territories over which our
country must exercise a more or less ex
tended measure of control, the Comptrol
ler earnestly recommends the passage of
laws authorizing the incorporation of
banks organized for the purpose of carry

branch banking.
SAYS THE ALTON ROAD
HAS NOT BEEN SOLD
John J. Mitchell, One of the Largest
Stockholders, Makes a De
cided Statement.
ST I.OUIS, Dec. 4.â The Republic to
morrow will say: John J. Mitchell, one
of the largest stockholders in the Chicago
and Alton Railroad, denies that there is
an option on that railroad or that it has
been sold. In this respect he said last
night: ,
"There is not a word of truth in it; at
least, so far as I know, and, if there were
I would know it. By that a mean if the
c'.inrollirig interest of the Alton road has
passed into new hands I would be prompt
ly informed of it. The controlling Inter
est is for sale, of course, if anyone will
pay the price asked."
What that price was Mr. Mitchell would
not say.
"Has anyone an option on the stock?"
"No; most emphatically no. And. what
is more, no one ever will."
"Hhs there ever been a bid for the con
trolling interest?"
"Yes, there wns; but it was not a satis
factory one. As I said before the stock
is for sale If we are paid what we want
for it. The bid was made to the Illinois
Trust Company, with wtnch my nephew
is connected. If any deal was made at
present it would be made through that
company, but up to Saturday nipnt there
waa none."
"Did the Kansas City nnd Pittsburg
people, through President Stillwell, make
the bid?"
"No." said Mr. Mitcnell impatiently,
"there never was anything in that."

was almost an hour working his way from the "Union depot Â£o his
parents' home at 76 Pike street, only a few blocks distant.. The re
ception under the parental roof was simple, but earnest. It was the
happiest moment of their lives for Patrick McDermott and his wife.
The news of "Boots' " arrival spread rapidly and in a few minutes
the McDermott house was crowded almost to suffocation by people
anxious to get a glimpse of the lad. The doors had to be locked
to prevent a further jam. for nearly every boy in the ward was
there. "Boots" was loud in his praise of the people of San Fran

IN CHIHUAHUA
Cattle Plunger Located
in Mexico.
DEPOSITS MONEY IN BANK
ACCOMPANIED ACROSS THE LINE
BY AN ATTORNEY.
Fugitive Is Closely Shadowed by De
tectives and Will Be Arrested
Upon the Arrival of
American Officers
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 4.â A dis
patch to the Journal from Chihuahua,
Mexico, says: Grant G. Gillett, the
missing Kansas cattle plunger, whose
sudden disappearance so startled the
financial world, arrived in Chihuahua
on November 23, and left on the morn
ing of the 24th for Durango, where, it
is stated, he deposited a large sum in
the bank. He remained only a short
time in Durango, when he bought a
return ticket to Chihuahua.
Two prominent business men of this
city came up from Durango on the
same train with him, and said that he
bought a flrst-class ticket and rode in
a second-class coach as far as Ror
reon, where he took the Pullman.
The gentlemen got into conversation
with him, and he said he had made
considerable money in Colorado in the
general merchandise business, and he
was in Mexico with the view of invest
ing in ranch or mining property. He
conversed quite freely upon various
topics, referring occasionally to the
cattle business. He was well dressed,
and wore several beautiful diamonds.
At Jiminez he was met by his attor
ney, C. R. Troxel, and the two entered
into low conversation and remained to
gether until they reached Chihuahua.
They arrived here last Monday and
went to the leading hotel, where they
registered. The man was undoubtedly
Gillett, as his signature corresponded
with his signature to a document held
in this city.
Troxel left on Tuesday on the stage
for the West, presumably to the min
ing camps in the Sierra Madre. Gil
lett is still in the city, but his where
abouts are unknown except to the de
tectives, who are closely shadowing his
every movement.
The report that Gillett had been ar
rested and held in custody here is un- I
true. The Jefe Politico says the Mcx- !
lean authorities have not seen him, and :
know nothing of his whereabouts. He '
will be arrested immediately upon the '
arrival of the - authorities from the
States, who are expected to arrive soon 1
fmm El Paso. Their baggage is all in i
this city, and on one of their trunks is
a tag with the name C. R. Troxel.
Three letters which have arrived at
the hotel for G. G. Gillett have mys
teriously disappeared.
COLONEL IRISH WILL
RETAIN HIS PLACE
Not to Be Deposed From the Position
of Naval Officer of San
Francisco.
WASHINGTCrN. Dec. 4.-Callfornians
have lately called .on the President to
urge various candidates for naval officer
at 3an Francisco. This Is one of the best
places In the Government service and
pays a salary of $5000 per annum. Mr.
Loud's candidate Is Dr. McGraw of San
Jose, while Senator Perkins and Repre
sentatives Barham and Hilborn, as well
as the California State Central Commit
tee, some months ago, Indorsed "Billy"
Hamilton.
The Call correspondent understands
however, that the President's disposition
at this time is to retain Colonel Irish In
office and he has intimated as much to
the friends of other candidates. Colonel
Irish s services in behalf of the gold men
in the last Presidential campaign are ap
preciated by the administration. His
term of four years expired one year ago.
but it is probable he will continue in of
fice during the rest of President McKin
ley s administration.

PEACE TREATY
WILL BE SIGNED
WITHIN A WEEK
Both Commissions So
Predict.
PRIVATE SESSIONS HELD
NO DEMAND MADE FOR A COAL
ING STATION IN CAROLINES.
Spaniards Not Endeavoring to Renew
Opposition to Cession of Philip
pines, for That Question
Is Settled.
Special Dlsr>atch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. 4.â The United State*
and Spanish Peace Commissioners held.,
private sessions to-day. Afterward
representatives of both sides predicted
confidently that the treaty would be
signed within a week unless unfore
seen complications arose.
The American Commissioners *ay
there is no foundation for the. reports
circulated in the United States ami
cabled back that President McKinlev
has forwarded to the American Com-
missioners instructions to insist upon
Spain, yielding a coaling base in the
Carolines, and that the Spaniards are
endeavoring to renew their opposition
to a cession of the Philippines. Both
commissions recognize that the latter
question is settled.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â Advices
from Judge Day, of the Peace Com
mission, received during last night's
Cabinet meeting, are of a gratifying
character and hopeful for the signing
of the peace treaty within a reasonable
time. The members of the Cabinet ex-"
press satisfaction at the progress be-,
ing made and say neeottations are pro
gressing smoothly. There are various
details, however, concerning which the
chairman desires to learn fully of the
President's wishes, and it was an. in
quiry of this character which formed >
the burden of the latest communication i
from Paris.
SPECULATION IN CUBAN
AND PHILIPPINE DEBTS
MADRID, Dec. 4.â The Government
has not reached a full decision reeard
ing Jhe Cuban and Philippine debts. -
but the Official Gazette to-day pub
lishes an announcement that the draw
ing for the redemption of the Cuban
bonds will occur on December 10.
The speculation in the Cuban and
Philippine debts on the bourse has
seriously displeased the Cabinet. The
rise in those securities Is attributed to
the report that the Government will
devote the indemnity received from the
United States to the colonial indebted- -
ness, regarding which no decisive steps
have been taken by the Ministers.
An official dispatch from the V'zcayasÂ«
Island in the Philippines announces,
that the insurgents have doubled their
attacks on Iloilo. The Government ad
vices say: "The rebels have their
guns trained on the city and fire on
our troops nightly. Our troops main
tain a spirited fire and have killed a
number of the enemy."

Bessie Bailey's Case
Proves Annoying.
MAY NOT BE INVESTIGATED
â .
OFFICIALS DECLABE SHE DIED A !
NATUBAL DEATH.
Seem Loth to Believe That the Girl's j
Sudden Demise Should Put Them
to the Trouble of an
iJL *. Inquiry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RAX JOSE, Dec. 4.â The cause of j
3essie Bailey's death is still a mystery. !
While the people on the outside are i
inclined to hint at foul play the phy- j
Blcians and managers of the asylum
believe death resulted from natural '
causes. Dr. Hood of Elko, Key., and |
Dr. Ware of Colfax, who are reported â 
as having said that a criminal opera- '
tion was performed on the girl, are I
coming in for no small share of criti- j
cism by those interested in the asylum. I
So confident are Managers Curnow,
Gould and Hale that these two physi
cians are mistaken that the case may
never be investigated.
There are many peculiar features j
about Bessie Bailey's death, but during |
her confinement in the asylum she was
always very mysterious. The girl was |
continually getting into trouble. Eddie I
Herbert, an attendant, was caught in j
the vicinity of her room in his stock- j
ing feet and he fled from the place on
â¢ bicycle. She was always mixed in ;
scandals with employes of the institu
tion. The story that sh*? to.ld Dr. Ware '
of the operation being performed is a
â¢ample of her tales â so the asylum ofti- i
cials declare.
The statement by Dr. Hood of Elko, j
jho held the autopsy on the girl's body, j
\ nat an operation had been performed, ;
is discredited by Dr. Curnow, chair- j
man of the board of managers. No
such testimony was given at the Coro
ner's inquest, as far as can be learned, ;
and Coroner Morgan, in a letter to Dr. :
Sponogle, says:
"All the organs of the body were in i
normal condition."
Evidence of an operation, Dr. Curnow j
says, could hardly be discovered three
days after death, where the body had j
been embalmed.
At the asylum all sorts of stories are
afloat among the attendants. Tney
throw no light upon the case, except
perhaps to prove the indiscretion of |
Dr. Leonard Stocking, first physician
. of the asylum. The stories are that
the doctor took unusual interest in the i
young lady, watched her case care
fully and spent considerable time in her
, company, remaining in her room on
some occasions as late as 10 o'clock at
night. When Bessie Bailey wanted
some money for delicacies the doctor
gave it to her, and on several occa- j
slonÃ he ordered chicken dinners for j
h^r. Dr. Stocking denies all this. Dr. |
Sponogle Bupports Dr. Stocking and j
Bays that nothing of the kind ever took
place that he knows of. The medical ;
director admits he had heard Dr. Stock- |
ing had practiced hypnotism upon Miss
Grant and Bessie Bailey.
It is believed at the asylum that a i
mistake was made when the press dis
patches stated that Cyrus Timmons, i
. the girl's uncle, said he did not know
\ she was coming to him. Letters at the ;
asylum prove differently. But there is i
some mystery as to M. C. Berry of 1110, i
la. Some time ago he wrote to Bessie |
Bafley and asked her to come to him j
and he would take care of her. He in- j
closed a check for $30, which he said |
he owed her for work she had done in I
his family at Santa Cruz. No such !
person is known at Santa Cruz.
Dr. Sponogle says the girl was i
troubled with a weak heart and death !
probably resulted from natural causes. !
The high altitude would affect her I
heart, and this, with the large dose of j
bromide of potassium, may have caused
death from failure of the heart. This i
is Dr. Curnow'g opinion, also.
While the board of managers is in- !
cljned to pass the affair over without â 
an investigation it is thought public !
opinion will demand that it be looked |
into. It is even asserted that last sum- |
mer's investigation will be only a side- ]
enow compared with the circus that i
will result from the investigation. !
Affairs are being conducted in a lax !
manner at the institution and it is said i
employes and patients are allowed con- j
Biderable freedom.

MERCHANT AH YEE'S
STORE AT AUBURN
Scene of the Brutal filling of a
Pioneer* ChiQaman.
In this modest structure one of the most horrible murders in the
history of Placer County was committed. Ah Yee. was a merchant,
who had lived In the county over forty years and was reputed to be
wealthy. He bought practically all the gold dust that was disposed
of in Auburn, and was believed to have kept this dust and his money
in a room at the rear of the store. On Friday night robbers entered
Ah Tee's place, felled him with a hatchet and then decapitated him
with an ax and made away with his treasure. No tangible clew to the
identity of the murderers has been discovered.
RESCUED FROM

PICKED UP BY THE ALERT
FACED STARVATION AFTER THE
WRECK.
Steamship That Went to Their As
sistance Almost Lost Through
Crashing Upon a
Beef.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Disratch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Nov. 29 (via Vancouver,
Dec. 4). â The steamer Alert which
went to the rescue of the ship
wrecked passengers of the steamer
Detroit, who were stranded upon the
shore of Shelter Island, short of provi
sions and in danger of starvation in
case of a storm, reached them last Sat
urday and returned in safety with all.
The Alert took a food supply for use
should she be delayed by the weather.
The ship struck a reef about a mile
from shore, and only the favorable cir-
cumstances of daylight and calm water
prevented a catastrophe as serious as
that of the ill-fated Clara Nevar 1 last
winter. Had the accident occurred at
night nearly all, if not all on board,
would have been lost in all probability.
As soon as the Alert got into the chan
nel here a wind arose and a heavy
storm came on.
The passengers were knocked off j
their feet "or seats, and those playing
cards at tables were tumbled over the j
floor by the force of the collision |
against the rocks. The Detroit at last j
accounts had disappeared from her '
perrh on the reef, having previously j
listed heavily, and has been knocked to ;
pieces by wind and waves. She can no ,
longer be seen, and is a total loss.
The passengers signed a statement â 
expressing their appreciation of the el* 1
forts made by Captain Latham to get. j
them out of their perilous position and
ashore, and of his efforts to promote i
their comfort on the island and to get
help to them. The Alert was sent out j
to the rescue by the customs author!- !
ties here.
Interest in the Atlln and Porcupine I
Creek diggings is still lively, and if
there Is any difference the interest ts ,
growing, though that is hardly possi
ble in Alaska. No one has reached the
roast from Dawson since the news of
the big fire was brought out on the
steamer Ora. Navigation has closed,
and winter has come down from the
sky. Doubtless some are now on the I
way out. When winter settles down a
little harder travel over the snow and
Ice to Atlln and Porcupine will begin.

SANTA CLARA, Dec. 4.â A short
time ago Mayor Druffel of this place
sent out circulars to the various cities
of this State requesting an opinion as
to the desirability of organizing a
League of California Municipalities.
Responses favorable to the holding of
a convention of representatives of the
cities were received from a maioritv
of the municipalities, and he was re
quested to fix upon a date and place for
the convention. Mayor Druffel has is
sued the call for a convention as fol

SANTA CLARA. Nov. 21.â A favorable
response to my recent circular letter, ad
vocating an association of municipalities
having been received from the greater
number of cities of the State. I am en
couraged to hope that the same will be
a success.
It seems best and most convenient to
all concerned that the meeting should be

December 14, at 10 o'clock a. m., would
be a proper time and Pioneer Hall an
appropriate place.
I sincerely trust that a representation

Inasmuch as we desire to amend laws !
in relation to municipalities, try and get
your corporation counsel interested in
the coming convention; also your City
Engineer, Health Officer and Chief of Fire

much good.
There will probably bo no limit to the

attendance of all city officials is earnestly
solicited. Kindly auvise at your earliest
opportunity whether a representation

Team of Oakland.
VALLEJO. Dec. 4.â T>Â»e Reliance foot
ball team of Oakland defeated the Far
raguts of Vallejo here to-day in a hard
fought contest, the score being 10 to 0.
The visitors were headed by Frank Frick,
who played a splendid game at halfback,
nbly supported by Platt and Deacon. The
lattrr was fullback, and his punting was
a feature of the game. In the first half
riatt kicked a beautiful field goal just
before time was up. In the second half
Deacon circled his field and scored a
touchdown, but missed the goal. Peter
Smith, captain of the Olympics, umpired
the game and gave general satisfaction by
his prompt and just decisions.
It was the Farragut's lirst game of the
season, and, considering that they had
several new men in the team, they mado
a splendid showing.

WINTER SESSION
OF CONGRESS TO
CONVENE TO-DAY
National Legislators Must Coq
sider Many Problems Caused
by the War.
Territorial Government for Hawaii and the
Nicaragua Canal Will Follow in the WaXÂ«
of Appropriation Bills.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. â The
curtain will ring up to-mor
row at noon on the closing
session of the Fifty-fifth Con-
gress. The war and the fruits
of the American victory carry in their
wake many problems which the na
tional legislators must solve. But
though many questions may press for
solution the brief _ space covered by
this session, which expires by limita
tion on March 4, precludes the possibil
ity of much being accomplished beyond
the passage of the regular money
budgets, the legislation for the in
crease of the regular army which the
administration deems necessary to
meet the obligations Imposed upon the
nation as a result of the war, and prob
ably the enactment of a law to give a
permanent Territorial government to
the Hawaiian Islands.
This covers all the Important legisla
tion which the Congressional leaders
expect to see enacted at this session.
It Is almost the unanimous sentiment of
the members that no attempt shou'd
be made to legislate concerning the
possessions acquired by the war with
Spain at this session. There are earnest
advocates of the Nicaraguan canal
who will strive to secure the passage
of a canal bill now, and in this they
may possibly be succesful, but neither
it nor any of the measures like the
pooling bill, anti-scalpers' bill, etc.,
which have strong friends, will be al
lowed to interfere with the bills the
passage of which is deemed absolutely
necessary to prevent an extra session.
The leaders at both ends of the Capi
tol have put their heads together at the
beginning of the session and are bent
upon the Idea of avoiding an extra ses
sion. With this purpose In view the
appropriation bills are to be given the
road at both ends of the Capitol and
pressed through with all possible haste.
Two sub-committees of the Appropria
tion Committee of the House have beon
at work for a week. The deficiency bill
to meet the extraordinary expenses of
the army and navy during the six
months from January 1, 1898, to July 1
is ready to submit to the full commit
tee to-morrow and the regular District
of Columbia appropriation will be
ready by the end of the week. It Is
necessary that the former should be
come a law before the holiday recess,
which this year Is to be shorter than
usual, and Chairman Cannon hopes to
see it through the House and into the
Senate before the end of this week. The
Democrats of the House have not dis
closed their position, but it is not be
lieved they will seek to obstruct any
appropriation bill necessary for the
maintenance of an army now In the
field. Should there be a disposition to
open up and prolong a debate upon the
conduct of the war upon this bill it
is safe to assume that the Committee
on Rules will be Invoked to bring in an
order of closed debate.
Intense interest is manifested in the
President's message, which will be sub
mitted to Congress to-morrow, on ac
count of the many Important questions
it will have to deal with, and no Presi
dential message in years has been
listened to with the eagerness and in
terest with which the reading of Presi
dent McKlnley's message will be heard
to-morrow. The reading of the mes
sage will occupy probably two hours.
The first thing in order after Speaker
Reed calls the House to order to-mor
row will be a call of the roll to de
termine the presence' of a quorum.
Concerning this there is little doubt,
as members are arriving by every
train and the hotel lobbies are already
thronged with them. A quorum hay

Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â Thirty-one
men started in a six-day bicycle race
in Madison -square Garden at five min
utes after 12 o'clock this (Monday)
morning. The starters are all in ex
cellent condition and the plank track,
ten laps to the mile, is in perfect order.
The attendance at the start was not
large owing to the stormy weather.
When the numbers of the racers
were distributed the referee could find
no one who would take "13," Irish,
English, American, French and Russian
riders seeming to be afraid of it.
Hence no '13" will be represented.
At one minute after 12 o'clock the
riders were called to the scratch and
the following responded: Charles W.
Miller, American, and winner of last
year's six-day race; Joseph H. Rice,
American, second man in last year's
ing been developed committees will be
appointed to await upon the President
and the Senate to inform them that the
House is ready to proceed to business.
Pending the arrival of the President's
message several members elected to fill
vacancies caused by deaths or resigna
tions will be sworn in, and immediately
after the reading of the message is
completed the House will adjourn out
of respect to the memory of Messrs.
Love of Mississippi and Northway of
Ohio, who died during the recess. On
Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest the
House will plunge Into Its work. Chair
man Cannon will have the deficiency
bill ready and it will occupy the atten
tion of the House to the exclusion of
everything else for the remainder of
the week.
SENATORS WILL SOON
SETTLE DOWN TO WORK
WASHINGTON,. Dec.
express a determination to take up the
work of the session vigorously in the
beginning with the hope of Retting well
advanced before the holidays and they
are counting upon taking up the ap
propriation bills at a very early date
for the purpose of preventing an extra
session due to any failure on the Dart
of the national budget. It is expected
that the army deficiency bill will reach
the Senate during the present week,
the understanding at the north end of
the Capitol being that the House will
dispose of it within a very few days
after assembling. The committee on
appropriations will bring it in early for |
the double purpose of having it passed ;
quickly and of testing the feeling of
Senators on questions connected with
the war. The first day's session will
be given up almost entirely to the
message, and there is great interest
manifested in hearing the minutest de
tails of the President's recommenda
tions. After the reading of the mes
sage the Senate will adjourn until the
next day. All plans for legislation of
general scope await the promulga
tion of this document, and as a con
sequence, one hears far less than usual
of measures to be introduced.
It is impossible to say what matters
will occupy the week after the disposal !
of the message, but it is probable that ;
some speeches may be delivered upon !
the policy indicated by the message, j
and also that the calendar may be
taken up. There are many measures \
which have been reported, and there
will be no difficulty to find employment \
if the Senate is disposed to settle down j
to routine so early in the session.
During the closing days of the last
session, Senator Morgan gave notice
of his intention to call up the Nicara
guan canal bill at the beginning of the
present session. He unquestionably
will redeem his promise and would
doubtless seek the first opportunity but
for the possibility of change of senti
ment in favor of having the Govern
ment undertake the entire responsibil
ity of building the canal. All the indi
cations are that this question will be
one of the most important subjects un
der consideration during the session.
Opposition is developing to the bill
which the Hawaiian commission will
bring in and for which early consider
ation will be asked. There is a con
siderable contingent in the Senate op
posed to constituting the islands into a
territory because of the apprehension
that they may be converted into a State i
and deliberate consideration of the sub- .
Ject will be asked.
While it is quite too early to reach
definite conclusions, there are decided
indications of a disposal on the part of
the Senate to confine the session's work !
to routine Treasures and the appropria- \
tlon bills, and it need surprise no one |
if the close of the session would dem
onstrate that this general policy had
been pursued.

A DRUNKEN ROW
SENDS ONE MAN
TO HIS DEATH
Francisco de Froncke Shot by a
Man Who Says He Was
Froncke' s Friend.
Antonio Rosso, an Italian Fisherman, Ar
rested for the Murder, Admits He
Fired the Fatal Shot.
As the result of a quarrel between two
Italians in a restaurant, at the corner of
Broadway and Front street, Francisco di
Froncke, a barber, lies on a slab at the
Morgue and Antonio Rosso, a fisherman,
is locked up at the Central Police Station
on the charge of murder.
The shooting took place at the corner
of Broadway and Montgomery street. !
There were no witnesses. After Rosso |
fired at his man he attempted to escape, I
but ran directly into the arms of Special j
Officer Burge, who, attracted by the !
shots, immediately ran in the direction j
from whence they came. Both men had |
been drinking and were considerably the
worse for liquor, and Just how the trouble
started is not known.
According to the story of the people in
the restaurant at Broadway and Front
streets the men entered the place separ
ately. They were to all appearance stran
gers. They took different tables and
gave their orders. While eating they be
came engaged in a war of words, and both
were very angry. At one time they seemed
about to come to blows, but were prevent
ed by the attaches of the house. Froncke
presently arose from the table and left
the place. Rosso followed, and, while
no one saw them, it is presumed that tne
quarrel began in the restaurant was con
tinued up Broadway until Montgomery
street was reached, when the fatal shots
were fired.
Froncke was hit in two places, the
right temple and the right shoulder. He
died almost instantly. Deputy Coroner
Hal'.et was notified /by Policeman Peshon
and the body was removed to the Morgue.

The Madrid correspondent of the Stan

On the body was found a Colt's revolver
of forty-one caliber with one of the cart
ridges discharged. Examination of the
gun shows that this had been fired for
some time. Rosso claims that the mur
dered man fired three shots at him. but
with the pistol found on Froncke as evi
dence to rebut his story he will have a
hard time to prove his assertion.
The- gun with which Rosso killed
Froncke was a cheap one, and from it
four shots had .been fii*ed. The murderer
claims that he shot but twice at his vic
tim. At first he would make no statement
to the police, but later acknowledged that
he had killed the man, who, he claimed,
was a friend of his. He was so intoxi
cated that the police place no confidence
in what he says. The general belief is
that the two men met each other while
out on a debauch, and, becoming engaged
in a drunken brawl, the murder followed.
Antonio Rosso, the murde r, is 23 years
of age. He was taken by Special Officer
Burge to the Central Police Station im
mediately after the snootin" and a charge
of murder was entered against his name.
Rosso'a story, told in an incoherent man
ner, was as follows:
"I met this man w..0 was a friend of
mine and we had several drinks togeth
er. Then we went down to Front street
and Broadway, where we drank wine for
some time. We finally quarreled and he
threw an empty glass at me. I resented
this and went outside and dared him to
come out on the street, where we could
settle the matter. He followed me out
side and drew a gun and fired three shots
at me. He did not hn me but I returned
his fire with two shots."
Swatwood, to-day. Engineer Herbert
Wayne was thrown down the hill and sus
tained internal injuries, and Fireman
Jerome Posten was badly scalded.

near Grand Forks, B. C, last week. A
grading outfit was excavating a large
open cut when it came upon a five-foot
vein of copper sulphides of an exceedingly
rich character. Work was continued on
the cut. which is intended to be sixty-five
feet deep, with the result that the orÂ«
body is increasing in width and richness
as depth is attained.
This important strike was made on the
Colcifer claim up the north fork of
Kettle River, and five miles from urand
Forks. Little attention has been given
to that part of the Boundary Creek min
ing district because the ledges found here
tofore have not been as well defined as
those in other sections. The uncovering
of such a large ledge by graders has
awaked renewed interest in that locality
and explorations have been started to find
other ledges. Assays of the Colcifer
ledge run high in both copper and gold.
The property is owned chiefly by Colin
Campbell of Grand Forks.
RETURN OF AN INSANE
ENGINEER YEOMAN
During the Voyage From Cuba He
Jumped Overboard, but Was
Rescued.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â Among the pas
sengers who arrived to-day on the Ward
line steamer Seneca from south side Cu
ban ports were Surgeons Byrnes of the
Cincinnati and N. V. Barclay of the Gla
cier, having in charge W. W. Seymour,
engineer yeoman of the Glacier, who is
suffering from insanity. He will be taken
to the navy hospital at Washington. Dur
ing the voyage he jumped overboard in
an attempt to commit suicide, but was
rescued.
The officers of the Merritt & Chapman
Wrecking Company, who have been work
ing on the Spanish warships sunk at San
tiago, were also on board. They express
the opinion that the Cristobal Colon can
not be saved.

1898 BREAKS THE RECORD.
IT is customary in trade to base comparative con
ditions on the heaviest previous business year until
a new record-breaker occurs, when that, in turn,
it taken as the basis. These record-breaking years
occur every now and then and are dispersed along the
commercial highway of the country like so many mile
stones, and are commemorative of exceptionally pros-
perous times. For several years past the year 1892
has been the basis of comparison, as that year made
â¢ the best average up to the present time. But we are
now told by those whose business is to collate com
mercial statistics that hereafter 1898 will be the basic
year. It seems rather odd to us in Califronia that
1808, which has been our "dry year," should have
been the most prosperous in the country's history,
but if we are to beheve the figures of the commercial
statisticians, it has broken the record in the volume
of trade, though it is behind other years in the plane
of values. In other words, prices have been low, but
the amount of business has been very large.
If this be really true, it destroys the popular theory
that war is destructive to business, for during four
months of the year the United States was engaged in
an expensive war with Spain. Indeed, it was observed
throughout the whole course of the war that outside
of Wall street the business of the country was hardly
affected by the war, one way or the other, and The
Call pointed out at the time that a foreigner might
travel from one coast of the country to the other with
out knowing that a war was in progress if he could
be kept away from the newspapers. The foreign and
internal trade of the nation went on as usual, and the
people were as tranquil as a cow chewing her cud.
A? the year goes out certain favorable conditions
are apparent. The iron and steel trade are excited
over the placing of orders for from 500.000 to 700,000
tons of steel rails â more than 25 per cent of the coun-
try's annual production â at prices which, though not
too satisfactory to manufacturers, indictate a stable
cc ndition of the trade. The boot and shoe business is
looking up, leather is steadier and hides are higher,
and the early advent of winter in the South has
caused a marked improvement in the cotton market.
The exports of flour and wheat from Atlantic ports
last week were 7,484,000 bushels, against 6,500,000
bushels for the same week last year. The lumber
trade seems to be improving, and the recent advance
in prices is maintained, while reports from the pro
ducing districts show that the heavy output has been
satisfactorily handled. The general jobbing trade of
the country has been checked here and there by se
vere storms, but this is transient and incidental to the
season. . The sales of wool in November were 39,875,
000 pounds, against 34,122,000 for the same week last
year, but they were effected only by concessions on
the part of sellers. Manufacturers of woolen goods re
port rather larger orders, and the general opinion is
that the. 'wool trade has seen its worst days, though
ho marked improvement in prices is looked for un
til the present enormous stocks become materially re
duced. The failures last week were 281, against 306
for the same week in 1897, while the record for the
month of November is said to be the best in this re
spect in the history of- the country, and shows a grati
fying condition of financial soundness. The bank
clearings continue to show a gain over those of last
year, the increase last -\Â»eek being 15.8 per cent. The
uncertainty connected with the Peace Commission
unsettled Wall street during the early part of the
week and led to some selling of our securities by for
eign holders, but that was a mere passing cloud. On
the whole the country seems to be going out of the
year with flying colors.
Locally there is little new. The lack of rain still
hangs like a cloud over the State, and while last
week's shower helped the pasturage in the northern
part, the San Joaquin Valley and the southern portion
of the Sta'e derived little benefit from it. Aslongasthe
dry weather lasts the interior banks and merchants
will be indisposed to advance seed to farmers, and
this acts as a drawback to business generally. What
the State needs more than anything else at the mo
ment is a good soaking rain, and when it comes there
will be a general unloosening of purse-strings all along
the cqmmercial and .agricultural line. There is no
contraction of credits anywhere, and money is in
abundant supply at the regular rates of interest, but
capitalists, both individual and corporate, are dis
posed to go slowly until they are satisfied of favorable
results from their advances.
The tendency of prices during the past week was
generally favorable, to ferjaie'rs. .. There was no decline
i\\ any Article ofproduce^ and several advanced. There
is very â¢little speculation St: -t.be foment, and business
js proceeding on conservative and safe lines.

THE WORK BEFORE CONGRESS.
AS a rule comparatively little important legisla
tion is undertaken at the short session of Con
gress. That which is to be held this winter,
however, may prove an exception to the rule. Cer
tainly there are gr,eat issues to be ddeafl f with. The
fact that the Senate is not fully under the. control of
sound money men may prevent any attempt to enact
a. currency reform bill, but with that exception there
is hardly any important measure of needed legisla
tion that might not be accomplished this winter.
Some of these measures, like that providing for the
construction of the Nicaragua canal, have been long
before the public. Others like the proposed legisla
tion for the promotion of American shipping have
been given an increased importance by reason of the
rapid expansion of our commerce, which is now car
ried on in foreign ships. Still others, like the demand
for the establishment of a parcels post, are new. All
of them, however, are supported by a strong popular
sentiment, and it is reasonable to expect that at least
some of them will be provided for by .the legislation
of the session.
The action of Congress will undoubtedly be largely
puided by the message of the President. It is re
ported he will recommend an increase of the army
and the navy, the construction of the Nicaragua
canal, a careful consideration of th: policy to be
adopted with regard to the government of Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines, but will not recom
mend any financial reform at this time.
While these reports are more or less authentic, they
will not in any way detract from public eagerness to
read the message itself. Mr. McKinley is a conser
vative statesman, well fitted to direct the affairs of the
nation at this critical juncture. It is still freshly re
membered how he saved the country from committing
the blunder of recognizing the so-called Cuban re
public, and the people have, therefore, ample confi
dence that his abilities and his patriotism will enable
him to settle up all the issues and responsibilities
growing out of the war with Spain without commit
ting the United States to any policy adverse to its
highest interests. ' . :,
Certainly Congress assembles for its short session
at a very critical period of our history. It is likely
to be marked by debates o- the highest themes that
can engage the attention of statesmen, for such will
be those involved in devising a government for
Hawaii and for the islands freed by our arms from
Spanish tyranny. We shall see what our Senators
and Representatives can s do with the great oppor
tunity before them.
NEW YORK BEATS LONDON.
A HAPPY coincidence has brought it about that
the year in which the United States first re
vealed themselves* to other nations as a great
world power of commanding naval and military pres
tige should also be marked as the year when for
the first time New York outranks London as a com
mercial city. The commercial triumph is, in fact,
the more surprising of the two. No one ever doubted
that we could sweep the Spanish from the seas and
drive them from the colonies they misgoverned, f bu^
it was not at all expected that the honor of being; the
world's commercial metropolis would be shifted from
London to New York before the year was over.
The figures and reports on which the claim of New
York for supremacy are based are official. Mr. Van
derlip, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, is quoted
as having said recently that the annual report of the
Commissioner of Navigation would show the total
value of London's trade in 1895 was $i,i23.59i;630t
New York's showing for the same period was $803,
321,190. In the following year New York gained
$137,980,338, while London advanced only about $27,
000,000. In 1897 the figures for New York were $976,
898,235, a decrease from the preceding year, while
London showed another slight gain. But 1808 has
proved a banner year. Exports of merchandise have
advanced fully $450,000,000, a greater gain than has
been shown by any preceding twelvemonth. Imports
of merchandise have not advanced, but there have
been heavy imports of gold to put the figures up. Al
together New York's foreign trade for 1898 will not
be less than $1,300,000,000, while that of London is
computed at $1,202,207,847.
Of course the contest will be close for some years
to come, and the fortunes of trade will vary. London
will be ahead one year, and New York another, but in
the end the advantage of New York will be so great
that mere temporary fluctuations and changes in the
commercial world will not affect her supremacy. She
will be in the near future what London has been for
so many years of the past, the commercial metropolis
of the world.
It is safe to say that if ever New York loses the
supremacy she has now attained the loss will be due
tc the opening up of the Orient and the development
of great commercial cities on the Pacific. San Fran
cisco in this respect is the child of destiny. The in
dustrial progress of the United States has brought
the mercantile center of the earth to our Atlantic
coast, and the progress made in the Far East may
bring it to this coast at a time much earlier than is
now expected.
THE BRIGHT SIDE OF A BLIZZARD.
RARELY has that vigorous and buoyant Ameri
can optimism which with a "frolic welcome
takes the sunshine and the storm" been better
illustrated than in the comments of the New Yofk
Mail and Express on the recent fearful storm that
swept over the whole country from the Dakotas to the
Atlantic coast. Our contemporary not only saw a
bright side to the blizzard, but found it so radiant
that it burst into a rhapsody of sparkling prose.
The storm, it will be remembered, was one of the
severest of recent years. Upon land and sea the de
struction of property and the loss .of life were great.
The Mail and Express itself describes it as "a grand
all-star combination of cyclone and blizzard." One
storm wind started from the south and the other from
the far west. The two united in New Jersey,' and
from there made a swift and terrible advance. Way
farers caught in the blizzard were frozen on the high
ways, many destitute persons died of the cold in their
unwarmed tenements, and on the sea the number of
wrecks was appalling.
After viewing and reviewing all these disasters the
Man and Express cheerfully advised its readers next
morning after the storm to turn "from these distress
ir.gr recitals to contemplate the beauty touches which
the great cyclonic blizzard has given to the visible
world." As an inducement to a study of these beauty
touches the genial and irrepressible optimist said:
"The storm king is a scenic painter of surpassing
genius. With his airy brush and his wealth of wjiite
he has given the outlines of castles and palaces and
fairy dwellings to the monotonous structures reared
by man. The trees, decked with feathery plumes and
glittering icicles, are like giant flowers from some en
chanted clime, and the distant hills loom skyward as
if they were terraced banks of habitable clouds. All
of which means that it was a royal storm, gorgeoifs
and beautiful, fitly heralding the approach of the ex
hilarating delights of winter."
Californians will not begrudge the East such win

ter delights* and if the people there find them ex
hilarating, so much the better. There is no
accounting for tastes. We can hardly re
frain from something of envy, however, for
the cheerfulness of the happy liar who,
after the passing of a blizzard, can rise up and swear
that he likes it. Every American has the nerve to
boast of the prevailing weather of his locality, and
declare the climate to be unsurpassed, but they are
few indeed who can survey the work of a winter
blizzard and shout with rapture, "It was a royal
storm, gorgeous and beautiful."
WHATEVER ground a woman may have for
complaining that her natural "rights" are de
nied her, when she turns criminal the basis of
her' logic fails. As a criminal she has privileges no
male could think of claiming. She is apt to be re
garded as a heroine. At least she arouses a maudlin
sympathy and escapes punishment. As to her privi
lege of slaying the man who may have wronged her,
or have been simply her companion in evil, no serious
question arises. ' There may be an arrest, a perfunc
tory performance at court, which is merely a trial of
patience and a waste of time. Under present condi
tions in cities around the bay any woman may kill
any man she feels an impulse to kill, and fear no
penalty more serious than her conscience can mete
out.
In direct defense of her honor, as of her life, human
judgment would sustain any woman if she slew her as
sailant. No such circumstance has marked the numer
ous murders committed here by women. Usually they
have been cold-blooded, deliberate, and so without
excuse, that, with the tragedy reversed, the woman the
victim, the man the assassin, the gallows would have
been the end for him. The plain citizen does not
crave the probability of being eliminated from the
material world even by the gentle hands celebrated for
a natural tendency to rod: the cradle rather than press
a trigger.
Since the execution of Durrant, the monster who
was hanged after a three years' fight, the law against
murder has seemed in a degree effective. There has
grown up a restraining habit of dropping thugs and
killers through the trap, reforming the individual and
making him useful as an example. No similarly be
nign influence has been brought to bear upon the
woman homicidally inclined. She has been taught
that she has nothing to fear from any violence, and
that a fit of hysteria and a gush of timely tears will
wash away her guilt. This is not fair to either sex.
If the Shattuck woman had been hanged, as she
richly deserved, for luring Harry Poole into ambush
and shooting him, the man-killing habit would not
have taken so firm a hold upon femininity. But this
woman, heartless, brutal and cunning, was not pun
ished. On the contrary, the court permitted her to
go, for the District Attorney, having convicted her
once, saw the futility of undertaking the farcical pro
ceeding again. Her sentence in the first place had
been twenty-five years, yet there was not about her
deed the first color of justification. The only woman
who has been punished was Mrs. Worthingtcm. Pen
niless, friendless, weak in mind and body, gpadefi to
"the act by her Husband, she excited' no sympathy, ihe
episode was not romantic nor the central figure a
beauty with lachrymal founts on tap. She did not
understand the science of applied hysterics. All the
rest of the list have escaped.
It is with no desire to appear harsh we call atten
tion to the recent tragedy in which the bride of a
month sought the presence of" her husband, Arst arm
ing herself, and sent a bullet into his heart andanpther
through his brain. She claims this was done in self
defense. If it was, the fullest opportunity should be
given her to prove it, and if it was not, if she sought
this man with intent to kill him, the penalty should
be as quick and as severe as it would have been for
him had he slain her. The mocking of justice has
continued too long, for the rustling of a skirt may
mark the approach of an assassin as truly as may the
stealthy tread of the midnight footpad. It is high
time for the distinction to be wiped out. The bullets
sped by the hand of a bride carried death with them.
How is such a deed less black because not the work
of a man?
Whatever fate may have in store for this self
created widow, it is certain that her career affords a
dreadful lesson to foolish girls. She had been mar
ried without parental consent. The husband was
perhaps in many respects her equal, but he was in
capable of providing for her, and this she knew. In
order to marry she was forced to lead a double life,
deceive her parents, and exist in a constant fear of
exposure. A marriage which must be kept as secret
as a thief keeps a robbery has in it no element of
good, and the girl becoming a party to it is treading
on dangerous ground along a path which can lead
only to disgrace.
There has as yet developed nothing to show that
either mentally or physically the man was the stronger
of the two. He did not seem as one who could in
fatuate and beguile. In these illicit alliances the
error cannot always be put upon the man, though for
his share of it he dwells in trembling fear and goes to
his grave. She has a share also. To hold her blame
less h a grievous wrong.
A girl who has the protection of a home does not
need to be protected by a pistol. When she resorts
to it, let the consequences be visited upon her.
A gentleman who was killed while on a hunting
trip it is now suspected shot himself deliberately,
since it is discovered that his life was heavily insured.
Needless to say, the insurance companies do the sus
pecting. To the average judgment the good that
money can do a dead man is hardly worth reaching
after.
Whether a woman has a right to kill a man who
happens to have acquired her ill will has come to be
a pressing question, and might as well be settled right
now. A man may be imperfect and yet commit no
capital offense, and a woman as executioner is out of
her element anyhow.
The Shenandoah arrived in port with a story of a
meteor which had flashed flamiag across the sky. and
a reporter recounted the yarn as a "long fiery tale."
Perhaps he did not mean to do this, but either the
scribe or the type machine was peculiarly honest.

WOMON (\S A CRIMINAL.
ENGLAND'S EDITORS IN DIRE DANGER.
The Author of the Immortal Words, "Not Simply .Hoisted, but Nailed "Till
Prosecute Them if They Say Anything Abouf^is Painful Old Con
tract With the Southern Pacific.
In this era of fraternity, when we are even talking of an alliance with
the British, our cousins over the sea will surely permit us a laugh at their
unconscious humor. They have heard there of the ''gale of the Examiner's
good will to the Southern Pacific, and the subjoined excerpts from the
Westminster Gazette Bhow how fully they have grasped the situation:
The Exnminer and the San. Francisco Call have for many year? added to the
gayety of the American press by their censelef* quarrtflings and bickerings. They
are perpetually flying at .one another's throat and sometimes nno and then the
other pets the upper hand. The Call is at present parformtng a. lively war
dance on the body of its rival. It alleges to have upearjhed a very pretty piece
of blackmail on the part of its rival, an. l its crowing is "particularly vociferous. It
flecltfrea that "William R. TT'earst. the proprietor of the Examiner, was at one
time promised $30,000 in Installments from the South Pacific Railway on the
understanding- that he would from that time consult the interests of the railway
and cease from all hostile criticism. This agreement was. signed in 1592 and for
a time, according to The Call, the Ronth Parifte and the Examiner had a
community of interests. Shortly after, however, the parties in this contract
quarreled, and although the affair was arranged at the time, the evidence of the
questionable transactions has now by some means passed into the hands of The
Call, which is not slow to rake th? ashos nf an old scandal on the head of its
rival. The text of the agreement has passed Into its hands and it :-. forthwith
gives it in full as follows, under the title of "The Purchase of Heargt:"
The company [Is to en.loy immunity from hostility tn thÂ« oolumnÃ of the Examiner,
andl Is not to be the victim of malicious attack or criticism, or of misrepresentation:
that the Examiner will not seek to create hostile sentiment In the minds, of this" commun
ity against the Southern Pacific Company, or any of the interests It represent*, and that
while not stipulating as aralnst all criticism, it agrees that criticism Shall not proceed
from any motive of malice or malignity, ami that- mich criticism as may he found neces
sary to keep and maintain the confidence of the public to the- extent t{iat any public sen
timent may have been created from Other sources, is to avoided as much p.s possible.
Round the typewritten agreement, which purv>or+* to be a rough copy, are
scribbled the comments of the managers of the Examiner. One of thorn agrees
to the entire, document except a few w.prds in brackets. Another says that "cer
tainly nothing else . would be satisfactory," whjle a third a,sks, "How does this
conform to your understanding?"
Although more than six years old the document is still a very pretty cudgel
for one newspaper to belabor its rival with. Unfortunately the answer of the
Examiner Is not to hand.
Meanwhile The Call, with the view of slinging another bolt at its rival, has
published photographs of what in American sjp.ng is. ca.^ed thQ Examiner's cold
pig. This Is the colloquial expression, for the unsold returps p{ a newspaper,
and the cartload in the cruel photograph is meant gently to convey that the Ex
aminer has not such a big circulation after all.
The fun came In where the editor took It all back. He recanted on the
authority of Creelman, a correspondent whose aversion to the truth is paid
for at space rates. Possibly Creelman could tell the truth, but Indubita
bly he never does so. He was an accessory to the horrors of the war be
tween China' and Japan, creating most of them himself and portraying with
elaborate detail thrilling series' of events which never occurred. In Cuba
he conducted the campaign, the presence of the officers being wholly super
fluous and rather annoying. He was an eager target for Mauser bullets,
and told with much elaboration the sensations of a brave man under fire.
So when Creelman was Instructed to call upon the editor of the Gazette
and to tell him what was what the editor Imitated Davy Crockett's coon.
Creelman added this to universal joy:
To the Editor of the Westminster Gazetteâ Dear Sir: There is not a word of
truth In the statement published in your columns based upon the San Francis
co Call's charge that the San Francisco Examiner had many years ago made
an agreement with the Southern Pacific Railroad by which the proprietoror man
agers of the Examiner were, in consideration of a payment of a sum of money,
to refrain from hostile attacks on or criticism of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company. The whole story Is a pure falsehood uttered by the San Francisco Call,
which is a mouthpiece of the Railroad Company, which now bitterly attacks
the Examiner because the Examiner has for years maintained an ear
nest anti-corporation attitude. This railond and its allied "trusts" on the Pacific
Slope first sought to shield themselves from honest criticism by attempting to
crush the Examiner. They supported the Examiner's rival, excluded the Ex
aminer from the railroad trains, and exerted their Influence in every possible
manner, public and private, to silence it. These facts" are well known in the
United States, and are repeated here now simply to meet a statement calcu
lated to deceive people in England who aro not familiar with American af
fairs. The whole Pacific Slope has been for years in the grip of a corrupt
and tyrannical corporate clique, headed by the Railroad Company, which has
Inspired the attack to which you give eurrencv. The Examiner has led a pop
ular uprising apainst this despotic system. The railroad and its accomplices
failed in their efforts to crush the Examiner. They then tried to caiole it with
advertising and favors. Failiner in this they are now trying: to discredit it.
The Examiner is In no way affected by such an obviously false attack, and the
conspirators have had to go a loner way from San Francisco to find a newspaper
other than their willing organ willing to publish this stuff. The Examiner is brinsc
iner a suit aprainst The Call for libel and Judgment is assured. I am instructed by
cable by William R. Hearst, the proprietor of the Examiner, to deny specifically
every part of the story printed in The Call, and to hold to strict accountability
in the courts all persons who repeat it. Faithfully yours.
JAMES CREELMAN.
Temple Chambers, Temple avenue, E. C, November 14.
The editor was scared. The threat of libel fetched him. The ridiculous
folderol of Creelman, of course, could not be. understood In London. How
could they know there the Examiner was a discredited arid purchasable
sheet. Its virtue a jest and Its record a scandal? So the editor said this:
[We are very glad to publish Mr. Creelman's letter. Our paragraph was in
tended to bo asummaryof a newspaper controversy which has excited some in
terest in America, and we were careful to explain that the statements were ex
parte allegations subject to the answerof the other side. Mr. Creelman's letter
certainly puts an entirely different color upon the statements made In The
Call.-Ed. W. G.]
So he will not be sued for libel. Happy man. He wouldn't havQ been,
and couldn't have been, but the bluff worked well.
But Creelman had a pull with some other papers. He caused the Even
ing Dispatch of Edinburgh to fly to the rescue of Hearst as a man who
was opposed to the Southern Pacific, but he did not tell it that he was so

wrote a communication in which he said â but why quote Creelman? There
are Aesop and Munchausen to draw on. Creelman was instructed to make
a general denial of the charge that Hearst had sold his toleration and he did
it. He forgot to. deny that the E-xamlner circulation is largely by way of
the garbage crematory, but still he did very well. "We congratulate Creel

.An almost forgotten act of naval heroism
Is retold of Admiral Lyons of the British
navy. Lyons was a lieutenant. 21 years
of age, on the seventy-four-sun * ship
Mlnden In the East Indies, fighting the
Dutch. One of the strongholds was Fort
Marrack In Java, which the British cap
tain considered too strong to capture by
his force of 450 men. The fort mounted
64 guns and had a garrison of 800 soldiers
but Lyons conceived the idea that he
could capture it, and contrary to orders
he, with three midshipmen and thirty-one
sailors, effected a landing in two boats
made a dash against the fully prepared
fort and drove the soldiers out,. alter
which he spiked the guns and returned
to his ship with a lons of only three
wounded. His captain was furious an,!
Lyons narrowly escaped a court -murtlal
but when. the admiral of the Beet heard
of the exploit he promptly promoted T.lou
tenant Lyons and a few years later he
was made a captain.

caveat consists of. a petition, specification,
drawing and affidavit of invention. The
fifing of a caveat does not secure any ex
clusive right of sale, the patent secures
that. If you have a valuable invention

should first secure a caveat or place the

attended the Polytechnic School at Vi
enna, and was a student of chemistry unv
der Professor Meissner. He becam a
greatly impressed by a demonstration o,\
the reaction produced by rubbing to
gether peroxide of lead and sulphur. It
struck him that the reaction might be
greatly intensified when substituting
phosphorus for sulphur. Irinyi was not
seen for several' days by .his fellow-stu
dents; but when he rejoined them he had
his pockets full of matches, which he
struck on the wall, all taking fire. He
sold his invention, it is recorded, to a
merchant named Romer for about $3500.
GEKMAN MILWAUKEE.
The theater, art and science have found
a home in the German city of America-
One German and three English theaters
offer to the public an abundance of varied
pleasures, and all eminent in intellect and
art are accustomed to stop in Milwaukee
on their American travels. A public li
brary, as well as a picture gallery and a
museum, offer gratuitous instruction to
every one. In the fall there is an annual
industrial and agricultural exhibition.
Which with each year receives a greater
abundance of contributions. Dozens of
German glee clubs and athletlu dissocia
tions, serve for social intercourse. As
might be expected, the English language
is used in the conduct of business, al
though at least from 50 to Go if not a
greater, per cent, of the people have com
mand of the German language, which is
taught in the public schools.
in almost every business, in nearly all
the commercial houses, which are for the
most part conducted by Germans, the
German language is used along: with the
English, and so ignorance of German is
regarded as great a fault as ignorance of
English, if not a greater one. Recently an
attempt was made to remove the German
language from the curriculum of the pub
lic Bchools. but the inquiry instituted for
this purpose produced a result very vexa
tious to the investigators. The over
whelming majority of the non-German
parents decided in favor of ha%'ing their
children taught the German language.
Thus Milwaukee, in this case also, nas
made good her reputation as, the Ger
man city of America.â Prom the Chau

Elaborate Plans of
Mrs. Hearst.
A PEERLESS SAN FRANCISCO
TAMOTJS ARCHITECTS TO DEVISE
A MASTERPIECE,
With Unequaled Possibilities, It Is
Hoped to Produce the Most
Beautiful City in the
World.
Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst, whose love for
California and all things Callfornlan Is
deep and broad, has found a fresh field
for her benefactions. If carried to Its
logical conclusion San Francisco, a city
â without a peer in all the wide, wide
â¢world as to location, will be archi
tecturally the most beautiful city on the
globe.
Bounded on the west by the broad
â waters of the Pacific Ocean and on the
north and on the east by the bay bearing
its name: diversified with noble hills and
under the shadow of Mount Diablo and
Mount Tamalpafs, it presents topo- ]
graphical possibilities that delight the I
architect striving for artistic effect.
Through the munificence of Mrs. Hearst '
the leading architects of all nations are
to be asked to submit plans, not neces
sarily one plan, which would make this,
the metropolis of the empire State of the
"West, the most modern and beautiful city
in all the world. The idea is a develop
ment of her propositions for the em
bellishment of the University of Cali
fornia, of which she is a regent. Noting
the necessities of the State's greatest
institution of learning and at the same
time, owing to its location, its possibili
ties as a setting for the brightest gems
of architecture, she determined that the
master minds of the world should design
the buildings that some day will shelter
the students of the State's seat of learn
ing. ..,-;, - Â . â 
To carry out this great scheme she pro
vided a fund of $150,000, with which de
signs were to be procured from all the
great architects. Famous designers are
In this city studying the ground over
against the Alameda foothills and draw
ing inspiration from it for an ideal uni
versity. With the matchless view of the
Golden Gate in all Its varying moods,
from the early morning until the brilliant
coloring of the setting sun, they expect
to produce designs in keeping with the
surroundings.
Mrs. Hearst's present idea is merely an
amplification of tÂ»us. Instead of calling
for designs for a building or series of
buildings she asks for designs for a city.
With all its natural advantages San
Francsico presents a grand field for the
display of architectural genius. The plans
of Mrs. Hearst, as superficially outlined 1
by her, are not for to-day nor to-morrow,
but for twenty, fifty years nence.
The plans would first call for improve
ment below the surface of iz.e streets to
the end that the healthfulness of the peo
ple might be secured for all time. This
would include all manner of conduits and
would be of the utmost importance in the
upbuilding of a modern metropolis.
The improvement of the city proper
would be on broad lines. It is not pre
sume! that designs would be submitted
for one building or for 100 buildings, but
for whole streets making harmony of
skyline and presenting an unbroken
front. This could not be brought about
in a day. It is contended, however, that
in twenty years of these wonderful times
more can be accomplished than in cen
turies of olden days. The development of
the city proper would present less for
midable obstacles than the buildings.
The water front affords opportunities
for a great boulevard: Golden Gate Park
has not attained its highest development
and other parks, as yet in the natural
state, can be made artistically beautiful
and restful to all the senses. Telegraph
Hill and Russian Hill, in the northern
portion of the city, and Rincon Hill in the
south, all present great possibilities from
the architects' point of view. There are
opportunities for boulevards throughout
the city which able architects will be
quick to note, and it is these suggestions
that are desired.
Regent J. B. Reinstein has caught the
spirit of Mrs. Hearst's ideas and ardently
longs for the development of this new
San Francisco. In responding to the
health of that good woman on Saturday
night he said in part:
We should attempt to formulate a plan now,
â while the city 1* young. We should have
en Meal for our city which would turn to best
advantage our picturesque hilltops and our
splendid harbor frontage. Mrs. Hearst had Sit
contemplation the establishment in the univer
sity of a department of architecture and en
gineering, where young men should be trained
specially for the carrying out of this ' plan
for the beautiflcation and fitness In every re
spect beneath and above the ground of this
city of ours.
So she proposes now the opening again ef a
â world-wide competition for the establishment
of a great plan for San Francisco, and urges
particularly those gentlemen who are visit
ing this city to take advantage of the occa
sion to study its possibilities.
In an interview yesterday Mr. Reinstein
eloquently enlarged upon the possibilities
of Mrs. Hearst's scheme. He repeated the
compliment he paid her at the banquet,
when he called her the first lady of the
land.
"In mentality and the power to grasp
great projects there is no woman on the
continent her equal," he said. "At the
forthcoming session of the Legislature the
new charter adopted by this city will he
ratified and will change our form of gov
ernment. With an intelligent Board of
Public Works, and given a plan under
which they can act intelligently, there is
no reason why this should not be the most
magnificent city in the world. Its pictur
esque location and the climatic conditions
in which its people live afford it great nat
ural advantages. It is the gateway to the
Orient, and with our possessions in the
Philippines has years of great prosperity
and possibilities before it."
Across the bay. nestling among the
foothills near Niles Canyon, is Verona, the
home of Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst. For
some years her manager has endeavored
to induce her to build an ornamental
gateway in keeping with the place. To all
his solicitations she has had but one an
swer. She could not afford the expense.
The woman whose contributions to char
ity have been enormous could not find it
in her heart to spend a small amount for
herself. Her thoughts are all for the good
of the people at large.
DANGER NOW REMOVED.
Wreckers Have Done Good Work on
Baldwin Walls.
The work of razing the walls of the
Baldwin Hotel continued yesterday,
though the force of wreckers was much
smaller than during the week. A con
siderable portion of the fifth story on the
Powell-street side was pulled down. The
crowd of onlookers was greater than it
lias been for several days past and the
detail of police had difficulty in keeping
the curious out of harms way. Thou
sands of persons who wished to take the
outward bound Powell-strr-et cars were
compelled to bo to the corner of klhs to
embark. Three police officers were sta
tioned at the turntable to enforce the
order, and they had their hands fu I.
Only one car at a time was permitted to
run down to the terminus and when the
wreckers were pulling on a mention of the
ied fp.ntuÃ* .-ill the cars were
stopped above the corner. So far not a
=inirlc person has been injured during the
tearing down of the dangerous wood-
fnrec of laborers will be put to
work to-day on and in the ruins. One
nan* will begin tearing down the firewall
hetw.-en the hotel and the annex. This has
to be done before the remainder of the
Market-street wall can be razed. Other
*angs will be at work pulling down the
Powell and Ellis-street walls. The
wreckers will place a donkey engine on
Market street to do the pulling ana Blx_
MRS. TRUETT DIED
OF A BROKEN HEART
(~\ t"T at her Twelfth-street home Mrs. Inex Truett lies dead of a broken
1 heart, and upon the six children, whom she hae left to mourn her, has
death of the mother the life of the father, E. M. Truett of the White
Sewing Machine Company, was cni6hed out by an elevator under the side
walk in front of the Y. M. C. A. building, on Ellis street. He had gone
to the basement to close the elevator doors and in some manner he be
came entangled In the never-too-certain machinery and two hours later his
crushed, bleeding body was carried home to the wife who awaited him.
And from that dread moment began her decline. All of the loving sym
pathy of her five daughters and of the faithful son, who was at her side in
the time of iher greatest sorrow, availed nothing. Her sorrow at the loss
of her husband, with whom she had fought through years of hardest adver
sity, and with whom she was only just ready to begin the enjoyment of
their years of labor and hardship, was not the grief that is soothed and
softened by tender condolence. There was but one solace, one lasting,
eternal relief, and that came to her peacefully on Saturday night, a week
almost to the hour, after the death of her husband.
To mourn her she leaves five daughters and two sons, one of whom, M.
S. Truett, is in New York, and has yet to hear of the bereavement that has
come to him. The daughters all reside in this city and were with their
mother at her death. They are Mrs. William F. Flynn, Mrs. J. C. Sepul
ba and Edith. Marian and Grace Truett. Her son, A. D. Truett, holds a
responsible position with Cluff & Co., the Front-street merchants.
Mrs. Truett was one of the pioneer women of the State. In the early
months of 1852 she left her New Orleans home and with her parents sailed
around the Horn for the new El Dorado. They settled in the mines, and it
was not until '58 that she met Mr. Truett, who had also come out in the
early '50s to dig his fortune out of the hills of the Sierras. Later in the
year they were married and ten years ago came to live at 132 Twelfth
street. Of late years the husband had been connected with the White
Sewing Machine people and had also managed a furniture establishment
of his own. By dint of hard work, in which his faithful â wife was always
an equal sharer, he had built himself up a modest fortune, and was about
to leave business cares to his children for the enjoyment of his later
years, when fate's hand drew him to his untimely death. Into this the
wife has shortly followed, and to the children is left the example and the
profit of the years that were theirs.
Deceased was 53 years of age and a native of New Orleans. Inter
ment will take place on Wednesday afternoon at Cypress Lawn Ceme
tery.
cables are to be used on the upper por-
Uons of the walls which are too sohÂ£ to
be hauled down by the hand crab, which
has been used heretofore. Just as soon
a" the top walls are down a couple of
hundred men and a score o f teams will
be employed in digging ou t an* cart*?,*
away the debris wh eh now fills the whole
frtofior of the ruined structure. The
wreckers now declare that all danger to
Ttreet-car and foot passengers on the
streets around the wreck has been re
moved.
THE FARRAGUT'S SUCCESS.
A Marked Contrast to Many Torpedo
Boats Built in Eastern fards.
The success of the Farragut in attaining
the high speed of over 30 knots ie another
! triumph for the contractors and a credit
\to the Pacific Coast. The new torpedo
' boat's achievement demonstrates the fact
< that the" mechanics in this city can turn
i out the best all-around war vessels, from
i the ponderous armored battle-ship of 10.
' 000 tons down to the comparatively small
i boat of 240 tons, of any in the country.
! There is a vast difference between these
; two extremes of war vessels specified, and
especially in their machinery. The Ore
gon's motive power weighs 1009 tons and
\ developed 11.111 horsepower, giving eleven
hor?<-~<vwer to each ton, while in the Far
ragut the weight is only 120 tons, but the
horsepower about 5600â 0r one-half that of
i the Oregonâ which shows nearly flfty
! horsepower per ton weight of engines and
! boilers. It is obvious that in order to ob
' tain so large a power from so small a
: quantity of material the design must be
perfect and the material and workman-
I 'inotSTa'iiM for felicitation is that the
! Farraput came v- to the requirements on
! her second official trial, and that no se
rious accidents on her builder's trial nor
: on the first official effort have raised any
doubt a" to the craffs future usefulness. ;
Eastern builders have not been so fortu
nate a"d none of their boats have "lipped
into the navy so easily as did the San j
talle shows the torpedo- i
boats built for and accepted in the navy
Several more are long overdue from the ,
contractors, some of tnem yet undergoing

The trial speeds of the Ericsson, Davis
and Farragut are the unofficial figures.
As to the records of these thirteen
boats, that of the Farragut is the most
satisfactory in having run its race with
only one mistrial. The Hereshoff Bros
at Bristol. R. L. veteran builders of the
fastest small steam craft in this country,
built the Cushing, Dv Pont. Gwin Morris,
Porter and Talbot. and some of these
boats had several unsuccessful trials. The
Gushing and Dv Pont had three trials, and
the Porter developed defects after pre
liminary acceptance, which had to be
made good. The Ericsson, built at Du
buque, lowa, made half a dozen vain at
tempts to reach her contract speed and
was finally accepted. The Foote, McKee.
Rodgers and Winslow were built at Bal
timore. On the first trial of the Foote
three men were scalded, and on the second
effort she slipped into the service. The
Rodgers required five trials, during one of
which bursted tubes scalded five men, and
during two prior attempts to reach the
required speed the machinery broke down.
The McKee was accepted during the late
war without coming up to the contract.
The sad accident of the Davis, built at
Portland, when seven men were scalded
to death, was followed by a second suc
r^ppful trial. The Mackenzie, built by
Hillman. Philadelphia, is not yet accepted.
Her first trial resulted tn the scalding of
four men and a bad break in the machin
ery, and she has not yet come forward
for another endeavor to get up to the
contract speed.
Accidents to torpedo boats while trying
to come up to the requirements are by no
means confined to this country alone, and
some pretty bad casualties to men and
breakdowns of machinery occur abroad;
but It is a matter of much gratification
that in the first attempt to produce such
a phenomenally. speedy craft as the Far
ragut no accidents whatever have oc
curred.
LIEUTENANT NOLAN ILL.
The Tacoma Will Sail for Manila
With Mules This Week.
The many friends of First Lieutenant '
James Nolan of the Fourth ' Cavalry will !
be sorry to learn that he is dangerously i
ill with .- pneumonia at , j the Presidio. !
Lieutenant Nolan contracted a severe '
cold some time ago and neglected to take '
the proper care of himself. On Wednes- i
day he was forced to take to his bed and I
has been in , a dangerous , condition evei
since. He is being attended by Surgeon >
Major Moseley, U. S. A., and a specialist I
from the city. At present he has a I
trained nurse in attendance and every- '
thing possible is being done for him. His I
physicians hope for the best, and yester- !
day they considered that -there ' was 5 a '
silent improvement in his 'condition. ,.. â  -,
The transport Taooma will . probably
sail for Manila this week with 100 j
mules .on board. -At Honolulu ninety i
more of the animals will be taken .
on The expedition will be under the !
command of First Lieutenant O'Shea
of the . Fourth Cavalry. The â¢â  Tacoma ]
has been â¢ at â¢ the - Union Iron Works
for the past two -months being fitted out j
for â  the voyage. One Â» trip has already ]
been made by the vessel to Manila with
horses and mules. Lieutenant ', Cameron j
of the Fourth Cavalry was : then in com-
Private Hills . of the Seventh Regiment, !
who was left behind when his command
went away, died in the division. field hos- j

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1898.
BAY PIRATES
PROFITABLY
RAID A SCOW
Left Only a Pair of
Trousers.
TOMCAT DEWEY SAVED THEM
A GOOD DAY ON THE BAY FOR
LOST ANCHORS.
Again the New Ferry Wharf Destroy
er Berkeley Opens War on
the Files of Her
Slip.
The United States transport Tacoma. a
sailing ship used to carry livestock for
the Government, has been refitted/till she
is a floating palace stable, with all the
modern Improvements. Electric lights for
Illumination; electric fans and blasts for
driving pure air among the horses and
mules far down between decks, padded
stalls for the protection of the animals
when the ship tosses on the stormy seas;
little grain cars that run along their tiny
track between the rows of stalls, carry
ing to each horse his twelve pounds of
hay and two quarts of oats per day; can
vas hammocks, which are slung under
the horse and the halyards made taut to
support him when he is weary of stand
ing or is seasick.
The Tacoma came yesterday morning
from the Union Iron Works and is now
moored at Beale-street wharf.
In her former trip to Honolulu the cargo
of horses suffered considerably from heat
and the rolling of the vessel. Then dark
ness of their quarters also contributed to
their discomfort and uneasiness. Now,
for the next trip a perfect system runs
through the whole vessel. The 200 stalls
are about three feet wide, just sufficient
: room for the animal to stand in one posl
j tion, but he has his hammock which will
â  support his body when it is his watch be
j low. The upper stalls are lighted by large
I windows, but those on the lower deck
I are provided with electric lamps. During
i calm days the animals will be exercised
I on deck.
Connected with the Tacoma are twenty
eight soldiers of the Fourth United States
Cavalry and thirteen packers, under com
mand of Lieutenant Shay, U. S. A. In
about ten days the ship will sail for
Manila with 200 mules on hoard.
As a result of the fire on board the
ship Shenandoah it is found that consid
erable damage was done, the wooden lin
ing of the lower hold having^ been burned
out.
Some time Saturday night the scow
Witch of the Bay was entered by un
known visitors and her cabin despoiled of
everything portable except the cook's
trousers. That officer explains the sav
ing of this article of his wardrobe by the
fact that his black cat, Dewey, a frightful
looking feline, whom nobody dare tackle,
was sleeping on them. Captain Hedge lost
$1 10 and his clothing. Mate Peterson was
relieved of his uniform and his purse con
taining 65 cents, while Cook Rube is out
$4 50 and all of his fine raiment except the
unmentionables referred to.
Yesterday Captain Whitelaw made a
good drag haul. It was the bower anchor
of the Italian cruiser Etna, which she
lost while unmooring ship a few days ago.
It Is of cast steel, weighing three tons,
and worth over $1000. Attached to it are
thirty fathoms of chain worth about $600.
The schooner W. F. Jewett did a little
fishing on her own account while getting
up anchor off Meiggs Wharf Saturday
afternoon. The weight of their anchor and
chain appalled the laboring crew. The
winch groaned and creaked as the usually
light mud hook slowly came up. When
it was in sight the mystery was explain
ed. Their anchor had dug up a companion
from the mud of the bay and had brought
it to the surface. With Its ten fathoms
of chain it weighed about 2000 pounds and
had evidently been lost a long time.
The new ferry boat Berkeley had an
other setto with her slip-piles Saturday
night. She was coming In with a huge
load of passengers about 8 o'clock, and
on nearing the landing on this side the
passengers! crowded on to the forward
end of the feoat. This lifted the after ena,
hoisting the then acting rudder sufficient
ly out of the water to render the vessel
unmanageable. She ducked her head low
like an enraged bull and charged the out
er point of the slip, clipping about a dozen
piles off close to the water's edge.
INFLUENCE OF THE HOME.
Eloquent Address at St. Mary's
' Church by Rev. J. McCorry. *.;
' "The Corner-stone of the Republic," was
the subject ; which the ' Rev. ; J. McCorry
chose for an eloquent sermon last evening
at St. Mary's â  Church. The preacher in
expanding the text cited the home as the
great social organization â¢; upon which the
destiny of the l entire nation -; rests.
"In the home." he said. "Is found the
truest sympathy. From *it ' emanates the
love of country 9 which ' characterizes -' the
nation, both individually and collectively/;
The internal discords . in ; France - were
pointed to as the outcome of ;a' lack of
patriotism which should be engendered In
the home, r From ' its \ total ; absence the
Government ' is continually - racked I. with
anarchy, murder and 5. moral â  and ~ mental
depravity, v . 'r^TOHBBP*JS r |*Sf fK ' . *- : .";
-< "The great safeguard of nations jp not
in standing armies and superbly equipped
navies; the best and the greatest fortress
is the door of the home."
The " lecture was *.: concluded r with a
: touching :; description ?. of r: the r, futility 'â  of
earthly Â» ambition r for ( the 5 consummation
of â ; earthly :. goods. ; A description of hlÂ» {
early boyhood, the devastation caused by
the "Great Reaper" among his friends
and relatives, formed the closing of one
of the most eloquent addresses ever de
livered within the historic old church.
BROOMHANDLE ARGUMENT.
Henry Moeckel Hits Henry Marcus
Because Ho Would Sing.
Martin Marcus is a baker and also fan
cies he is a singer. A few nights ago he
obtained employment in a bakery on
Jones and O'Farrell streets, and during
the early hours of the morning would
give full play to his vocal powers. The
neighbors complained to his employer
that their slumbers were disturbed by the
noise made by Marcus, and Saturday
night the foreman. Henry Moeckel. was
Instructed to stop Marcus in his vocaliza
tion.
About 4 o'clock yesterday morning Mar
cus burst forth in song and Moeckel told
him to "shut up." Marcus declined, and
they began calling each other offensive
names. Then a fight was in order, and
Moeckel armed himself with a broom
handle, while Marcus drew his knife.
Moeckel hit Marcus on the head with the
broomhandle and Marcus slashed Moeckel
on each arm, but only succeeded In mak
ing a scratch.
Marcus was taken to the Receiving
Hospital in the patrol wagon and Dr.
Zobel found that his skull was slightly
fractured. Moeckel was arrested by Po
liceman Prowse and locked up in the City
Prison on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon. He was released yester
day afternoon on $500 bonds accepted by
Judge Low. He claims self-defense.

Glen Park Attractions.
Several thousand people visited Glen
Park yesterday. The attractions in the
vaudeville theater were well attended
and were exceptionally good. On the pro
gramme were the names of Master Ray
mond, "the Yellow Kid" of "Hogan's
Alley"; the Marrillias, in their Irish com
edy sketch; Idaline, the world renowned
dancer; Edward O'Connor, the Irish co
median; Whelan and Lynton, in their
great success. "Life's Lights and Shad
ows"; the Leons. in a double trapeze act,
and the "Troy Trio, the world's famous
fire kings." An intermission occurred in
the programme, during which time Toney
Ryan, the mad musician, entertained in
the new cafe. The balloon ascension and
parachute jump by Professor Conlon was,
as usual, successfully accomplished.

DIRECTORS MEET -TO-DAY
THE GRAND JITBY ANTICIPATES
MORE JOBBERY.
Expects That an Attempt Will Be j
Made to Railroad a List of
"Subs" Into the Depart
ment.
The Board of Education wfli assemble
in regular meeting: again this afternoon
to s^e what can be acne for sidetracked
substitutes and other .matters. The red
hot tirade of Director .Gallagher against
Grand Juryman Irving. In which Gal- j
laÃhor found fault with Oie Grand Jury â 
for dipping uninvltedly into School Board j
rottenness, had the. effect orf standing off j
the proposed job until a more propitious
lime, and it is thought that this after
noons meeting may develop something in
teresting. With that contingency in vi. w
Mr. Irving proposes to be present at this
afternoon's meeting, and the indignant
Gallagher will not require the medium of
the newspapers to make his opinions J
known. :
It is likely that the first Jegal action of
the combined teachers will lÂ»e taken to
day toward forcing the board to rescind ;
;ion holding back November pay. A ,
delegation of the merchants fr.^m whom ,
Director Bantel has purchased extra fur- j
niture amounting to a number of thou- i
Funds of dollars will also be on .hand to .'
see and ask what there will be lef\ in the
iry to satisfy their claims and out
standing commissions.
For a goodly portion of the overs took
of supplies now on hand no bills fc aye
been sent in to the department and no ac- i
count appears on the bill books. Ev\Â°n ]
the Directors cannot understand why this |
is so, and at the meeting of last Wednes- ]
day Bantel was asked to furnish state- â 
me'nts. He declined to do so, and the \
made a peremptory demand,, to \
which Bantel in reply consigned them all I
to a hotter locality. The Grand Jury j
made the same demand upon him
and has got* in return the same satisfac
tion, and, giving up hope of getting
- in any outer way. the experts are
resent making the rounds of the
pchools checking up the principals' requi
sitions with the furniture and supplies on
According to the expert's report the dâ¬-
Octt which the present board will leavÂ» to
us Bucceroor amounts to nearly ISQG.trw.
As an excuse for this enormous short-tgxr i
thÂ« L'ircotoisâ all but Wallerâ are eiv.ro- V
in,,' that there was a shortage of 010.000 |
when iHfly came into office. Waller s: ys
It was $105,000. As a matter of fact, the
expert's investigation Into the oooks has
e'eveuped the fact that the sho.'.age
amounted to only $6000, and that there was
money available in different fund* to
more than cover that.
I pon the list of appointees that it is '
expected will make Us appearance to-day
the jury has- fixed its attention. It is
Btmngly suspected that one or all of the
young ladies who paid $50 each for ad
copies of the teachers' examination
questions will be railroaded through for
the position which has been paid for,
and it is this sextet that the jury is after.
There is one important phase of the
general crookedness that characteriees
the last of the year's transactions of the
School Board that the jury has not yet
thoroughly investigated, but which will be
tak.-'ii up fully before the searchlight is
turned off for the season. It Is the ques
tion of night schools. From figures ob
tained it is developed that there is in at
tendance at the night schools an average
of six pupils to each teacher. The young
idea that is taught to shot by the light
of the midnight oil is given everything
thÃt comprises the day curriculum, but
the only class that is sufficiently well at
tended to warrant the expense that these
institutions are to the city is the class
In mathematics.
The fact that it requires one teacher
to Instruct six pupils, docs not become
patent upon reading the reports that are
sent in to the department by the princi
pals. The attendance is reported on an
expanded ratio. If there be six present
at the evening's roll call, a thriving at
tendance of thirty or more is written into
the regular reports, and the deception be
i-'imps a part of the records upon which
the school expenditures are based. This
condition of affairs has been in existence i
almost since the night school system was
inaugurated as a part of the plan of
legalized Jobbery. There Is some exnif
for the principals and teachers who turn
in the fraudulent reports. Some of them '
have paid a good fee for their jobs and
a complete attendance is necessary In
order that they may hold them. The di
rectors demand that the attendance be
kept up at any cost, as the night schools
compri^' their most profitable channel
of expenditure. If it transpires that the
day school does not need and cannot be
convinced that it needs one of Director
Bantel's numerous donations of furni
ture or supplies, the stuff is fired into the i
night school and so accounted lor. If the I
day schools do not need one of Director
Hammonds patent tin roofs the night
school probably does, and Director Ham
mond's patriotism in serving the public
without a salary is again fitly rewarded
Hammond's I^arkin-street tin roofing
agency, by the way. and the fat con
tracts that have found their way there
from the department, are other things
that the jury has in its mind's eye as
possibly being fruitful propositions for
Investigation.
To-day, however, all Interest is centered I
in the regular meeting, as It Is strongly
surmised that it is to be held for Irregu
lar purposes, and Interesting develop
ments are looked for.
THE SUNDAY PAPERS.
H-ev. E. A. Woods Lectures on the
Supplement question.
At the First Baptist Church last night
R< v. E. A. Woods delivered a lecture on
'â¢The Sunday Papers." He deplored the
magnitude of the weekly supplements, yet
confessed the inability of any one, lay or
secular, to alter the state of affairs. "I
do not intend to butt my head against a
stone wall." said he, "for the Sunday
supplement has come to stay. It com
menced twenty years ago and has been
growing year by year. An improvement
has certainly been effected and in its evo
lution toward a safer goal we may hope
for progw."

A RAID ON BEER AND STOUT.
Daniel Tweedie's Bottling Establishment on Eighth Street Broken
â¢ Into and Looted by a Gang of Boys.
THERE was high revelry in the
neighborhood of Harrison and
Eighth streets yesterday morn
ing and for hours three police
men were kept busy endeavoring to
arrest the revelers and throw them
into prison.
Daniel Tweedie's bottling estab
lishment at 409 to 419 Eighth street
was seized by the Sheriff Saturday
and his official lock was placed on
the door. The fact soon spread and
yesterday morning a gang of about
fifty young men. and boys gathered
about the place and broke open the
rear door. Some of tlvm had provid
ed themselves with jacks and In a
few minutes they were swarming over
the place, filling the sacks with bot
tled beer and stout and dragging
them away to places of safety.

SANDBAGGED
AND ROBBED
OH THE FRONT
Frank Shipman Des
perately Assaulted.
NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH
HIS BATTERED BODY THROWN
INTO THE BAY.
Rescued by Two Apprentices From
the Ship Peleus and Resuscitated
at the Harbor Hos
pital.
Two unknown men sandbagged Frank
Shipman, a discharged soldier from Com
pany D of the Eighteenth United States
regular infantry, shortly before 7 o'clock
last evening as he was walking along the
water front near section 3 of the seawall.
After relieving the semi-conscious man of
$90 and a gold watch and chain the foot
pads threw him into the bay, from which
he was rescued by two apprentices of tne
British ship Peleus.
Shipman was walking along the water
front last evening watching the ships as
they lay at the wharves and paying no
particular attention to any one. When at
section 3 of the seawall he noticed two
men approach him, but merely glanced
at them and they at him. Immediately af
ter they passed him he felt a stinprtng blow
on the neck, and knew nothing more un
til he found himself in the waters of the
bay. He set up a shout for help, which
was heard aboard the PeleuÃ.
Apprentices H. W. Lovegrove and A. C.
I-andale lowered a boat, and with consid
erable difficulty succeeded in rescuing tne
half-drowned man. The police were noti
fied and Shipman, but half conscious from
the blow and the water he had taken in,
was removed to the Harbor Hospital.
Drs. r'itzpibbon and Scannell worked with
the victim for some time, and within a
couple of hours had him as good as new,
barring a Boreness of the neck, where the
sandbag struck him.
On the 26th of last month Shipman ar
rived in San Francisco on the City of
Para. His time of service in the regular
army expired in October, and the war be
ing "over he determined to visit his fam
ily. When the Para arrived Shipman took
a room at the New Western Hotel and
has been in the city since then having a
good time and seeing the sights. He had
considerable money with him, spent It
freely and drank a good deal.
Shipman can give no description what
ever of the men who assaulted him, so the
police have no clew upon which to work,
SHALL MIDNIGHT SEE
THE BALLROOMS CLOSE?
WILL the society women of San Francisco emulate the example of
their Quaker sisters a -d place a time limit on social functions in
this city?
That is a question which promises to seriously engage the atten
tion of the leaders of the smart net for Borne time to come, or until a solu
tion of the problem is reached. Already the women of Washington are
discussing the advisability of following in the footsteps of Philadelphia,
and it is more than likely that the coming season at the national capital
will witness a revolution in social circles quite as radical and far-reaching,
in its way, as the change in the national administration's foreign policy.
Of course it may be argued that San Franciscans do not require as much
sleep as less fortunate creatures who are obliged to live in the East, or
that the salubrious climate of California precludes the possibility of evil
resulting from keeping late hours, and thus dispose summarily of what
might prove a vexing problem. But, on the other hand, it may be decided
that the Philadelphia idea is a good thing, and that to accept the new or
der will be really only the proper thing to do.
The society leaders of slow-moving Philadelphia may after all attain the
distinction of having inaugurated a great reform for which future genera
tions will do them honor. Midnight may soon come to be recognized as the
hour when all gayety shall erase through the length and breadth of the
land, and the society young men who have heretofore been obliged to con
tent themselves with three or four hours' sleep between the hours of pleas
ure and business during the social season may find more time to devote to
the demands of nature.
The reform wave has not yet reached San Francisco, but the mur
muring of the breakers can be heard in the distance, and those who direct
the destinies of society in this city must prepare to grapple with the prob
lem which seems to have struck a responsive chord in the East.
Will San Francisco society women continue to dance until 2 or 3 a, m.
and sleep until noon, or will they curtail the hours of pleasure to give the
young man a chance, as well as to protect their own health? That is the
question.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1898.
ried out armfuls. and when the gang
finished their job very few bottles
were left. A trunk on the top floor
was also broken open and its oon
tents stolen.
A telephone message was sent to
the Southern Police Station shortly
before noon and three officers were
dispatched to the scene. By that
time the gang had disappeared, but
two small boys and n young man
who were discovered crossing a
vacant lot adjoining the bottling es
tablishment with half a dozen bot
tles among them, were arrested and
put in "the tanks," pending further
inquiry. They declared they found
the bottles in the vacant lot and
were not among those who entered
the place. A young man. who gave
hie occupation as a ballplayer, was
also arrested. He was considerably
under tho influence of liquor and the
officers believed that his "jag" was
the result of the stolen beer and
porter. A charge of "drunk" wa^i
entered against him so as to de
tain him pending further inquiry.
The officer found three sacks
filled with the bottled liquor and a
case hidden away in a corner of the
vacant lot anu sent them to the
City Prison. How many bottles were
stolen will not be known till the
proprietor is consulted to-day.
but are making every effort to find the
guilty parties. Wnen the apprentices
from the Peleus pulled Shipman from the
water he wore no coat nor vest. A search
of the dock resulted in these articles of
clothing being found and the police believe
that it waa the intention of the footpads
to take them, hut fearing detection left
them behind. Shipman's cries for help,
when in the bay, were very feeble and
barely heard aboard the Peleus. It
is probable that when he struck the cold
wateY he partially recovered conscious
ness and owes his life to that fact.
"TOASTED" THE DIRECTORS.
Rev. John Wilson Makes the School
Board Crookedness the Theme
of His Sermon.
As a prelude to his sermon at Howard
street Methodist Church last evening, the
Rev. John A. B. Wilson grilled the
Board of School Directors and arraigned
them bitterly for their arbitrary action in
holding back the pay of the teachers for
the month of November and giving the
preference of first payment to the mer
chants, who have realized fat profits
from their dealings with the department.
The reason for this favoring of the mer
chants, he said, was because they not
only had votes, but recourse to the Di-
rectors' bondsmen, while the teachers had
neither. Concerning the board, Rev. Mr.
Wilson said, in part:
I presume that all who read the morning pa
pers on Thursday were astonished by the in
formation that the School Directors of this
city had by vote indefinitely postponed the sal
aries of the teachers of our public schools for
the month of November. It is known that with
about l(Kw teachers to pay and an expense ac
count for this purpose of $90,000 the Board of
Supervisors are allowed $110,000 per
month, which by the one-twelfth act
cannot be exceeded. Had the salaries
been allowed the bills would have
reached $167,000, $57,000 In excess of the legal
limit, and so those who should have been first
paid were by vote denied their warrants. The
tradespeople and contractors have their redress
upon the bondsmen of the directors, which, I
believe, the teachers have not. And the busi
ness people have votes also.
It Is dreadful to think of what goes on in
this city; corruption is charged in almost every
department. The charges against the School
Department are made everywhere. Is it not
time that something be done before the ruin
of our city is complete? Should not its fair
fame be sufficiently precious to somebody io
cause a halt or, at least, an honest inquiry
Into these alleged dishonesties? Is it true that
a JISOO fence has been put about school prem
ises at a cost of $15,000? I want to know if It
is true. If so. who profited by the steal and
what is the city going to do about it? And If
not true, then let them be punished who reck
lessly assail the reputation of our public offi
cers.
If this gangrene invades the department of
pullc Instruction that Is a good place to begin
proceedings. And 900 educated women of
blamÂ«iÂ«Bs reputations and 100 men of like char
acter will make good leaders for a successful
crusade.
An Imposter.
A middle-aged woman calling herself
Mrs. Green Is Imposing on the charitable
people of this city and the public Is
â warned that she is an lmposter. She has
already duped a number of people In the
Western Addition. She represents that
she Is a native of Carlisle, England, and
that her husband died on the steamer
Coptic during her last trip from Hong
kong. She exhibits a bogus application
for a foreign money order and tells her
credulous listeners that it is an order
which she cannot get cashed, as she has
no acquaintance to identfy her at the
Postofflce. No person by the name of
Green died on the Coptic and the Post
office authorities say no advice for a
money order for Mrs. Green has been re
ceived.
ROBINSON IS
ENJOYING LIFE
IN CHICAGO
Ex-Captain of Police
Looks Prosperous.
SISTER JULIA'S STATEMENT
MEETING HIM, SHE REFUSED TO
SHAKE HIS HAND.
Positive Denial of the Report That
He Had Been Killed
in the Recent
War.
Ex-Captain of Police Robinson is in
Chicago. The whereabouts would not be
of much interest except that It was re
ported that he had been shot and killed in
the recent war with Spain. According to
Sister Julia, who has charge of the Shel
ter Home on Harrison street, she met
"Handsome Bill," as he was familiarly
known to his associates, in tho Windy
City.
Meeting her on one of the principal
streets, he doffed his hat in the usual
Chesterfeldian way and attempted to
shake hands with her. As Sister Julia re
fused to take his proffered hand he be
came indignant, and in sarcastic tones
asked her if she did not recognize him.
"I could not forget you, Robinson," re
marked the plucky' woman. "Your face
is like a nightmare to me."
Without deigning to reply, Robinson
quickly left her.
When seen last night at police head
quarters, where she frequently visits In
quest of lost children, Sister Julia read
ily agreed to tell of her meeting with Rob
inson.
"When I left this city, only a short time
ago," she remarked, "I did not think that
I would meet the ex-captain of the City
Prison. I had heard he had left the
United States, and was led to believe that
he had joined the army shortly after the
first call for volunteers. To my surprise,
after I had reached Chicago I saw 'Hand
some Bill,' as the boys caffed him prome
nading one of the principal streets. He
was fashionably dressed, and, to use a i
common expression, looked like ready |
money. He accosted me and, extending \
his hand, announced that he was glad to
see me. I refused to shake hands with
him, and after telling him what I thougnt
of him I walked on.
"He seemed surprised at my refusal to
recognize him, and as I walked away he
looked at me as though he would like to
'do me up.' I did not see him after that
and was thankful for it. I am bitterly
opposed to him for his actions while he
was captain of the Cuv Prison and for
that reason I refused to speak to him." ]
Shortly -after his dismissal from the
Police Department Robinson informed his
friends that he was going to Dawson City,
where he claimed he had an interest in a
large mino. He suddenly left the city
and when inquiry was maxle about him it
was said that he was in Victoria working j
in the interest of the Spanish Govern- |
ment. Latterly It was reported that he
had joined the army of volunteers and was
fighting for the stars and stripes. From
the statement of Sister Julia it would
seem that "Handsome Bill" Is enjoying
life in Chicago.
SUNDAY NIGHT
AT THE CALIFORNIA
The California Theater went back to
the old farce-comedy groove last night
and presented "A Boy Wanted" to an au
dience that filled all the seats and
crowded the aisles. The piece is wild,
silly and acrobatic and the company is
violently competent. A special feature is
a fistic combat between the soubrette and
the "boy" in which the latter is done to
a finish in the third round. The Sabbath
audience was In sympathy with the show
and the applause was noisy and frequent.
ROUGH ON THE SUPERVISORS.
Rev. Mr. Coombe on the New Charter
and Civic Regeneration.
The Rev. Philip Coombe, in his sermon
at Richmond Congregational Church, ex
pressed the hope that the Board of Super
visors under the new charter would be an
important factor in the great movement
for civic regeneration.
"I believe," he said, "that there is a
great deal of hope for us through govern
ment under the new charter. The meas
ure will provide home rule. The various
commissions now appointed by the Gov
ernor will be named by the chief execu
tive of the city, who is best qualified to
know its needa. The Mayors in the past
have been generally good men, but that
encomium cannot be passed upon the Su
pervisors. The people will have greater
power than before, for the granting of
franchises and other proposed ordinances
must first be submitted to the voters.
"Our hope for civic regeneration lies
also in the fact that the charter will
make known to the Supervisors what
their duty is and always keep it before
them. They will be limited to legislative
powers, their former judicial and admin
istrative prerogatives being placed in the
hands of the judiciary and the Mayor.
They will understand that they are not
the servants of corporations, but of the
people. All the money that is paid for
the Government of the city will be used
for that object only, and not squandered
in other directions.
"Our hope in the Supervisors lies In the
fact that we will have better protection
for health and morals than before. The
good government of the new charter in
New York has lowered the death rate in
that city.
"We should grasp the opportunity of
having good government. I believe that
In the future these men will do their
whole duty. Let us hope that we are
going to have in San Francisco a city
that will be an honor to California and
a credit to the United States.''
AT THE PARK AND CLIFF.
Immense Crowds Gather at All the
Pleasure Resorts.
Thousands upon thousands of pleasure
seekers thronged the park and beach yes
terday afternoon, while the Chutes, CHIT
House and Sutro's Baths were crowded
almost to the limit. The drive at the
park was the largest for months. Among
the most attractive rlg-s that "did" the
drives was a handsome drag drawn by
four dashing horses, which contained the
prominent architects who are privileged
to propose plans for the University of
California buildings âD. Despardelle,
Stephen Codman, Austin Wlllard Lord, J.
Monroe Hewlltt, E. Bauharin and Regent
J. B. Relnstein.
Notwithstanding the great gathering
and number of vehicles on the drive, no
serious accidents occurred. A party of
cyclists from Newark got tangled up and
three of the number suffered a few
scratches, but this was the only Incident
that approached an accident. Among the
most important donations received at the
museum this week are: One Insignia or
decoration of the "King Kalakaua Order
of Honor," Hawaii, very rare, as only a
few were conferred, presented by M. H.
de Young; one ancient bond In the sum
of two hundred and forty (240) pounds,
issued in Prince George County, Mary
land, on December 14, 1727, together with
a large and curious seal of the same place
and date and such as they used to put
on Important documents of that period,
presented by D. F. Verdenal of New
York; two lnrge steel shells and one large
stone projectile from Fort Phillpe, Cavite,
Manila Bay, and one wooden stand taken
from the wreck of the Spanish warship
Ulloa, destroyed by the .American fleet in
Manila Bay. May 1, 1898, presented by J
D. and A. B. Spreckels.
C. W. Vosmer, who met with a shocking
accident while making a balloon ascension
at the Chfites some time ago, did not at
tempt to again soar among the clouds
yesterday as advertised. His physician
advised against the exhibition and Fred
Harper, Vosmer's associate, consented to
inspire^ the multitude. Harper made the
prettiest ascension of the season. The
balloon when the ropes were cut soared
straight toward the heavens for about
3000 feet and then the daring aeronaut cut
the parachute loose. So straight had the
balloon made the ascent that the para
chute dropped just outside the grounds,
or rather tangled on a trolley wire, and
Harper was obliged to drop about twelve
feet to the ground. This he accomplished
without accident. In two weeks Vosmer
will make an ascension, and doubtless on
that day the Chutes will be well patron
ized. -"

TRIED MONOXIDE.
A Young Woman Turns on the Gas
Without Fatal Results.
Mrs. Ruby Hall, who occupies rooms
in an uptown restaurant building, at
tempted to commit suicide last night.
She placed one end of a drop light tube
over a gas jet and opened the stopcock,
then she got into bed and placed the other
end of the tulje in her mouth. Before she
became unconscious she repented her rash
act and attempted to leave the room, but
fell on the floor. A moment or two later
her sister discovered an odor of gas from
Ruby's room, and opening the door saw
what had happened and gave the alarm.
Doctors were summoned, but there was
no occasi6n for their services, as the
young woman had not inhaled enough of
the deadly monoxide to imperil her life.
This is the third time the woman has at
tempted to destroy herself, and her sis
ter says that every time she gets mad
she tries to end her life. On two former
occasions she had quarrels with her hus
band and took poison, but did not suf
fer any. great inconvenience because of
the small dose taken. The alleged rea
son for the attempted suicide last even
ing is that she is tired of living. About
a month ago Mrs. Hall left her husband
and went to live at her present abode.
When the other occupants of the house
discovered that Ruby had attempted sui
cide they immediately dispatched mes
sengers to her husband, and he came to
her bedside. There is no danger of the
woman dying.
Accuses a Young Girl.
Marian Gallagher, 14 years of age, was
arrested yesterday at her mother's resi
dence on Walnut avenue by Detective
Cody and booked at the City Prison on
a charge of petty larceny. The girl was
employed by Mrs. Sutherland, who rooms
in Mrs. R. "W. Beattie's lodging house,
1007 I^arkin street, for the past four
months, and it is alleged that she stole
silk waists and articles of jewelry from
her employer and other roomers. Some
of the articles were found- at her mother's
house.
Stabbed Five Times.
While trying to save his nephew from
being severely beaten, Thomas Bowman
was last night stabbed five times In the
back by Mike Cooney, who is said to be
employed in the Superintendent of
Streets' office. Bowman was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where it was found
that he was not seriously injured. His
assaila.nt was not arrested.

WHITEWASHED By
WATSONVILLE
It Was the First This
Season.
LANGE AND MERTES AS STARS
THEY DO SOME VERY CLEVER
WORK.
One of the Prettiest Exhibitions of
the National Game Ever Put
Up in a San Francisco
Ball Ground.
By Joe Corbett.
The great Gilt Edge collection has
played many games of ball this season.
Of this number the majority have
been victories. But of all the setbacks
received at the hands of opposing teams
none was more complete in every par- I
ticular than that of yesterday, when the
Watsorivilles, the tail-enders In the cham
pionship race, shut them out without the
semblance of a run, the score at the end j
being 13 to 0. The defeat was one in which j
no questions as to possibilities might |
arise. It was a defeat thorough In the !
extreme, and it was a defeat over -which '
haseballdom will expatiate for some time
to come. In reviewing the line-up of the
two teams, however, it would be well to
notice that the Watsonvilles have among
other names those of Bill Lange, Sandow
Mertes and Chance. The team was there
fore unreasonably strong, and to these
m.-n, including Balsz and McCarthy, is
due the lions share of applause. They
were demons throughout the entire con
test, pitching, batting, playing and run
ning bases as only clever players can.
I do not wish to leave the impression
that the other members of the team did
nothing, for they filled their positions to
a man perfectly. The others played,
however, so brilliantly that to them be
longs, as I said before, the greater por
tion of whatever glory the fans propose
bestowing upon tht-ir famous cocoanuts.
KaJsz, in the box, was a hurricane by
himself. Three scattered hits were all
these men, who on Saturday hammered
Mr. Whalen into almost every nook of
Recreation Park, could secure off him.
Chance, who did the backstop work,
played beautifully, and was, by the by,
accorded a grand reception on his first
trip to the batter's box. Lange and
Mertea gave as pretty an exhibition of
base running and stealing as I would care
to see, while McCarthy played third base
in true National League style.
Nobody paid any attention to the result
o! the game after it had passed the fifth
inning. The men whom I nave mentioned
were Riving performances in too superb a
manner to leave time for other reflec-
The Gilt Edges, poor unfortunates,
we will say, did the best they could, but
this reflects no credit on the work of Fee
pies, Doyle or Lockhead. These gentle
men played miserably, but Doyle, owing
to the fact that he twirled his cohorts to
victory on Saturday, can be excused and
sympathized with. He retired as grace
fully as circumstances would admit of in
the middle of the game, and then the con
test was Irretrleveably lost. Keilly sue
â¢ i him, and then Lockhead succeeded
Reilly. and the contest was stripped for
nf its interest. The leaders were up
against too strong a combination and were
beaten from the very start. Besides this j
fact they played poorly and the Watson- |
villes did nothing but fool with them.
This is so particularly of Lange. who stole
I base while the catcher was tossing
the ball back to the pitcher.
Mi-rtes also worked a clever trick in
conjunction with Lange, which brought
. iwn great applause from the multitude.
With Lange on third and himself on first,
he deliberately walked toward second and
was, according to programme, caught in
between the bases. While the players
were endeavoring to run him down Doyle
dropped the ball for an instant, but long
enough, f^r Lange was across the plate
and Mertes was back safe on iirst.
Doyle's error spoiled the original play,
yet' it was the idea that caught the crowd.
Altogether the afternoon was an en
joyable one, thanks to Lange, Mertes and
the others mentioned. The attendance
must have been near 7000. The score is

worship with a deeper cense of religious
fervor. The erection of this projected
Etructure means much to the community,
as It marks a decided step onward of the
Episcopalian faith. It is the outgrowth of
an insignificant mission, founded thirty
two years ago at a time when San Fran
cisco was just evolving from an uncertain
camp (founded by gold hunters) into a
great metropolis.
The ceremony of laying the stone was
participated in by representative clergy
men from all the Episcopalian churches
throughout the city and adjoining towns.
It was conducted under the personal di
rection of the Right Reverend W. F.
Nichols, the representative head of the
Episcopalian church In the diocese of Cal
ifornia.
On him devolved the honor and the duty
of sealing the sacred relics in their tomb
of stone. Immediately before the massive
block was lowered Into position in the
foundation an interesting service was
conducted. The choir, consisting of thir
ty or forty young boys, the clergymen of
the various churches and a number of
specially selected singers, assembled in
the old" church on the opposite corner,

and, at the appointed time, led by the of
ficiating Bishops, issued forth from the
old wooden structure, chanting the Bacred
hymns of the church. As the little pro
cession, robed in white surplices, passed
through the portals of the old build
ing and neare-d the site of the. new, the
surging mass of humanity surround
ing and obstructing lta course, gave way
before the advancing, uplifted cross.
Immediately to the right of the building
where the ceremony of laying the stone
was to be conducted, and running parallel
with the front wall, was erected a gallery
for the accommodation of the members of
the choir and the assisting clergymen.
After a preliminary service the Bishop
descended the stairs leading to the north
east corner of the foundation, where the
stone was to be sealed, and after pro
nouncing the sacred words dictated by
custom and the church, the mammoth
block of stone slowly descended to its
allotted position. As It went down those
assembled around it either doffed their
hats or bowed their heads. After the
huge block had been struck three times
in accordance with custom by the Bishop,
a silver trowel was handed him and the
stone was securely sealed Into position.
Upon the conclusion of the ceremony
addresses were delivered by Sidney M.
Smith, the Rev. W. H. Moreland and
Bishop Nichols. The ceremony was con
cluded with a prayer for the success of
the construction, the adornment and en
tire completion of the building and the
efforts or the new pastor elected to fill
the position recently made vacant by the
election of Rev. W. H. Moreland as Mis
sionary Bishop of the northern diocese of

HANDBALL TOURNAMENT.
A New Pacific Coast Champion Comes
Out With a General Challenge.
The tournament handball game now be
ing played at Phil Ryan's court at 858
Howard street has been the means of
drawing renewed attention to the game
that was popular long before some of the
other American outdoor athletic sports
made their appearance in the arena.
By the tournament in this city a new
champion has come to the front in the
person of James Harlow, a San Fran
ciscan, aged 24 years, who has issued a
challenge to any handball player on the
Pacific Coast for any amount that may
be put up, the game to consist of the
standard one of the best five out of nine
aces. The young challenger is a splendid
specimen of the native athlete and has
confidence in his ability to best the oldest
and most scientific player on the coast.
The third of the series of the tourna
ment plays was concluded yesterday at
Ryan's, in which Colonel J. R. Bockman
and E. McDonough of the Ariels defeated
Dr. W. H. Slebrest and D. J. Sheehan of
the Olympics. The concluding and final
issue will be played on next Sunday after
noon, at which it is expected a large
crowd of spectators will be present to wit
ness the grand windup of the contest.
The result of yesterday's games, including
those of the tournament, are as follows:

OLIVET CHITRCH CASK
Pastor H. T. Shepard Explains Why
He Sues His Congregation for
His Salary.
The following letter is from Rev. H. T.
Shepard of Olivet Congregational Church,
corner of Seventeenth and Noe streets in
this city, who recently began suit against
the directors of that institution:
To the Editor of The Call: During 1897 the
pastor was criticized for being wonderfully pa
tient and he held the church to no fixed sal
ary and helped them pay street assessments of
about $700; also to pay delinquent taxes and
various small debts. The church is In debt
to three pastors, and the present suit ia
brought because of failure since January, 1898,
to pay the lowest living salary which was
pledged by both directors and church, $65 per
month, to the present pastor, that he might
meet his expenses, while paying pact debts
of the church, contracted before he came.
The church of 113 members is confessedly
able to pay this and the suit Is brought, not
against the faithful treasurer of the corpora
tion or against any loyal members or directors,
but only through them as officers of the cor
poration, who are expected to require delin
quent members to do their part with pastor
and loyal members to support the church.
At the beginning of the prestnt year the pas
tor tendered his resignation, feeling that he
had made all the sacrifice that was good for
the inexcusable delinquents, and consented to
withdraw it only upon the unanimous vote of
the church and directors and also upon a con
tract to pay $65 per month in the future. Just
two-thirds of the salary of the two former
pastors. H. T. SHEPARD.

A stenographer for a large law firm in Boston had a rather
common experience : "My work," she said, vis very nervous and ex-
acting, and, I used to leave the office utterly exhausted. At night I
would often have* the most horrible dreams, and sometimes wake up in
a cold sweat. Once I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed clutch-
ing the bed clothes frantically with both hands. I became so dis-
heartened that I finally told my employer I must give up my position,
but he laughed, and said he wanted me to stay, and then suggested
that I try his remedy for such troubles. He gave me half a dozen
Ripans Tabules and told me to take one after dinner and another
before going to bed. I did so, and rested better that very* night
Now, whenever I feel nervous, I take just one Tabule before retiring
and I sleep right through till morning, and get up thoroughly rested
and ready for business. For a sleep-producer and a auieter oi tin
serves, these Tabules are simply wooderful/'

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
SENTIMENT IN
LIEU OF LAW
IN ALAMEDA
Mrs. MentePs Fate Is
Food for Guessers.
THE FALLMER PRECEDENT
LOS ANGELES USED TO CLUB
OAKLAND'S SILURIANS.
Local Ordinances Enforced by Turns.
No Chinese Lottery This
Week, but Plenty of
Cigarettes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Dec. 4.
Last Christmas a pretty young murder- i
ess was released from the County Jail by
one of Alameda's typical juries. This
Christmas another fair young mur
deress will be in the County Jail,
and Oakland is guessing as to ,
what extent the first case will j
be taken as a precedent for the second. !
Both crimes were the sameâ each girl shot !
her lover dead on a sidewalk in Alameda. j
It being always admissible to apply pre
cedents to current issues, the public can- ,
not be blamed for doing so in the inter
esting cases of Mrs. Mentel and Miss Fall
xner.
A close comparison of these two cases
Would seem to justify the Judge at the
preliminary examination at once discharg
ing Mrs. Mentel. Up to this time nothing j
has been said about her character to
prejudice it, but everything concerning !
her reputation is such as to make it ap- :
pear that slip is a model young woman, j
Clara Fallmer did not have such favorable !
testimony before the jury. She did have j
a Chinese lover from whom she borrowed j
the pun with which she killed poor La-*
due. But she- was young and pretty, and I
it was Christmas eve when the jury wont j
Into its room to consider its verdict. And
who could be supposed to follow the law
on Christmas eve?
From present indications it will be about
Christmas eve when Mrs. iientcl's case is |
submitted to the Judge a.tterA\er prelim- j
lnary examination. Judges, as a rule, are
not as sentimental as Jurors, because, be- |
ing lawyers, they set a professional value ;
on the arguments of professional men.
Unless a sweeping change has come over \
the average Alameda County jury in the :
past few months, it would actually seem
advisable for Mrs. Mentel to be set free ;
at once and not to subject her to a long
and costly trial which would be but a j
good advertisement for her should she af- !
terward go on the stage or write a book. I
"Until after the trial the details of the !
case may not be discussed. But their pos- j
Bible effect on a jury is subject for specu- j
a ifÂ°ail that has been said by the parents
â nd friends of Anna Mentel be true, the
foundation has been knocked from under
t ne system of training young people tha-t
has hitherto been supposed to be eminent
ly proper. Anna, we are told, was never
away from home in her life after 8
o'clock, and was always safely tucked
away in bed before 9, unless in company
with her father, her mother or her
younger sister, she went to a theater.
This beautifully puritanical method of |
living was practiced unbroken until just j
one month ago, on which occasion Anna j
went to visit a lady friend in Berkeley !
for three days, so she told her mother, ;
It now appears that a portion of those
three days Anna was in San Jose getting
married to the man she has murdered. If
all this be true it is a revelation that in
one month such a girl could develop into
a deceiver of her parents, a secret wife
and a murderess. This suggests one more
cruel thought. If Anna were deceptive
for one month, why not for a year or
years ?
This is an entirely original view of local
Juries, for recently the Enquirer thus
complimented men who convicted a hu
ma'i beast:
"In view of the reputation Alamtia. j
County juries have for rendering verdicts
not in accord with public sentiment. It is I
but due to the twelve talesmen in this !
case that their names be published. Here i
If. the list: D. W. Pratt. William B!ij3,
Charles Tock, N. T. Boyle, M. Borges,
L. T. Brown, Hiram Bailey, William
Peru. J. Tyson, Henry Hanschildt, H. W.
Brunsnn, John Harrington."
The execution of the local ordinances in
Oakland resembles a checker-boardâ
eometimes a black square, sometimes a
white one. l month ago the City Council
during a spasm of virtue passed an ordi
nance making it Â« misdemanor to sell cig
arettes in the city, of Oakland. It went
further. It made It a crime to give one
away within the city limits, and also
made it criminal to smoke one in a public
place. This ordinance went into effect
and for a few hours afterward not a ciga
rette could be bought in Oakland. It was
well known, however, that nearly every
cigar store and many quiet basements {
harbored a Chinese lottery joint, but these
had been unmolested for a couple of
years, and not until the racing season
commenced did the police with a flourish !
of trumpets swoop down on the Chinese j
gamblers. One might almost think that
the bookmakers had prayed for the raid
on the Chinese at that particular time.
For two weeks no one has been able to I
buy a Chinese lottery ticket, but all over j
town cigarettes can now be bought in any
quantity. When cigarettes will be again
suppressed and Chinese lotteries ply their
trade unseen is a query of supreme inter
est to many pecple "on the street" in this
city.
At a gathering of nrominent gentlemen
a few nights to discuss park sites
some very bitter things were said of Oak
land and some very warm compliments
were paid Los Angeles. So plainly was
the contrast drawn between the two cities
that an idea almost new took possession
of the gathering. It was that if Oakland
is to be stirred to doing anything in the
way of improving itself, It must be done
largely by educating its people to the
contrast between their city and the south
ern metropolis. Rev. Dr. McLean rather
surprised his friends by stating that he
harl just borrowed money to pay his
taxes and he would willingly borrow more
for the same purpose if he were being
taxed to pay for permanent improve
ments. The reverend doctor made one sig
nificant remark. Doui.Uess the early his
tory of Oakland was passing through the
doctor's mind when he said: "It may
be unfortunate that that beautiful point
to the north of Lake Merritt belonged to
a family of the name of Adams, but
the city should not be prejudiced by that
fact. If" the name be unpleasant, then let
us buy the property and give it some
other name, so that we shall not hear the
name of Us present owner quite so much."
Mr. Marshall told some vÂ«ry painful
truths when he said: "The wealihy people
of Los Angeles have contracted the habit
of giving something to their city before
they die. The wealthy men of Oakland
have not yet contracted the habit of giv
ing anything while they live or of leav
ing anything when they die." Unfortu
nately this is true, for outside of the
Chabot Observatory and the clock in the
City Hall tower presented by Dr. Merritt
nearly a generation ago, what is there in
the municipality to commemorate the vast
wealth made here by the Carpentlers
Adamses. Moons, Merritts, Delgers and
the other millionaires who have passed
away ?
Alameda is not greedy politically; she is
merely ambitious. She wants her people
to be prominent in every department of
State government and in other places
where people are constantly in the public
eye. This remark is suggested by the fact
that at this time she has a man "men
tioned" for each of the following places:
Recorder Spear for San Francisco Harbor
Commissioner, Councilman Pringle and
W. Nat Friend for Secretary of the Code
Commission, Judge Pringle for Commis
sioner of the Supreme Court, James M.
Oliver for clerk of the Senate, Rev. Bar
ton Perry for legislative chaplain. Hod
Church and Frank Barnett for deputy
ships in one of the State departments.
Deputy District Attorney A. A. Moore Jr.
for the Attorney General's office, and
there are others.
In addition to these ambitions Alameda
County now has a Supreme Justice, a
Commissioner of Immigration, a Labor
Commissioner, a Deputy Labor Commis
sioner, a Prison Director, a Mint Super
intendent, a Prison Warden and various
minor- plums, so that aJtogether it is not
surprising that Alameda is considered in,
politics as an ambitious county. After so
gracefully yielding to Mr. Gage at Sacra
mento she cannot be called grasping.
At intervals Alameda asks for a branch
Receiving Hospital. The request Is not
unreasonable, and probably no other city
of its size is without some such institu
tion. A few nights ago a young woman
with a serious wound in her head was
brought to the Oakland hospital in a fur
niture wagon, in which she was driven
two or three miles over (he rocky marsh
road from the city across the encinal.
Alameda has the finest municipal building
in this county, and it is a disgrace 10 the
county that there Is not provision for pre
venting such indignities to citizens as are
seen whenever an emergency arises.
STUART W. BOOTH.
CAPTURE OF KELLEY.
Arrested for Drunkenness, He Is
Held on a Felony Charg-e.
OAKLAND, Dec. 4.â George Kelley was
arrested this morning on a charge of an
assault with a deadly weapon. The police
and detectives have been on the lookout
for this man since last July. One even
ing during that month Keiley, "Doc"
Walsh and a man named Roden, called
for free drinks at the Long Wharf Saloon,
West Oakland, and being refused they set
upon a bartender. Julius La Fleur^ with
iron rods and nearly beat him to death.
Before the police could be summoned the
fellows made Â«rood their escape.
Shortly thereafter Roden and Walsh
were captured in Sacramento. At their
preliminary examination on charges of
assault with deadly weapons they were
released.
Kelley kept out of sight until last Wed
nesday, when he was arrested for drunk
enness at Seventh anÂ» Myrtle streets.
His time at the CÂ«Â»- Prison expired this
morning, when he was Immediately turned
over to Constable Edward Weidier, who
lodged him in the County Jail on the
charge first mentioned.
TRANSFORMATION OF
OAKLAND'S NARROWGAUGE
BBOADGAUGE TBAINS NOW BUN
ON WEBSTilxt STBEET.
Cars Fitted With Modern Conveni
ences and Much Better Time
Made.
Oakland OftVÂ« San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 4.
The practical transformation of the
narrow-gauge local system into standard
gauge was inaugurated this morning, and
broad-gauge trains were run on Web
ster Btreet.
The cars, while they are by no means
new, are far superior to the old narrow
gauge coacheÃ. They are fitted with all
modern conveniences and add much to
the comfort and safety of the patrons of
the road. The locomotives used are also
in good condition, having been con
structed from engines that were found
too light for the overland service.
The heavier traffic has naturally neces
sitated the strenghtening of the mole and
approaches, and to obviate all danger
new piles have been driven where they
will do the most good. It is a matter of
only a few years, however, when there
will be practically no trestle between the
mole and the shore, as the filling in and
work of reclaiming the marsh lands and
fiat at the mole is progressing rapidly.
The cars formerly used on the narrow
gauge locals are decidedly better equipped
than those now in commission on the
Alameda trains, and it is understood the
former Oakland cars will now be used
on the locals in Alameda. It is not un
likely, however, that the Alameda nar
row-gauge will eventually also be trans
formed, since rumors to that effect are
floated periodically.

ANDREWS MAY TAKE
BERKELEY COLLEGE
/
BERKELEY, Dec. 4.â Much interest was shown to-day in the faculty
and student body of the University of California when it was learned
that President E. Benjamin Andrews, formerly of Brown University,
had resigned from his office as Superintendent of the Chicago public
schools. The news Is understood to have a very important bearing: upon
the question of the presidency of the University of California.
When the present head of the faculty at Berkeley handed in his resig
nation recently, the Board of Regents, in looking for a successor, took into
consideration the names of several eminent professors and presidents of
Eastern colleges. Among these none was more prominently mentioned
than President Elisha Benjamin Andrews of Brown. But at that time he
was just commencing his work as head of the Chicago public school sys
tem. Other candidates were accordingly sought for, among them Presi
dent Hyde of Bowdoin and President Gates of Amhurst.
Dr. Andrews' resignation, handed in yesterday to the Chicago Board
of Education, peaces the whole matter in an entirely different light, and
makes him the most available candidate to succeed President Martin J.
Kellogg. The time of his resignation was also very opportune, as the
committee of the Board of Regents Is to'meet before the end of this month
to settle upon its recommendation as to who shall be Berkeley's next
president.
President Andrews is a Bcholar of more than national fame, and one of
the leading educators of the East. He is 54 years of age, and an aggressive,
original student. In 18R3 he became professor of history and political econ
omy at Brown University, and five years later was elected to the same of
fice at Cornell. In 1889 he was chosen president of Brown, which position
he held until this year. He is the author of "Institutes of General His
tory" and "Institutes of Economics," and a member of the Rhode Island
Historical Society, the American Economic Association and the Ameri
can Historical Association.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1898.
HIS HEARSE
WAS HIS ONLY
FUNERAL TRAIN
Mentel Buried With
out Ceremony.
RELATIVES SHOW NO GRIEF
MUBDEBESS' CLAIM OF SELF
DEFENSE NOT JUSTIFIED.
Autopsy Physicians State One of the
Shots Was Fired After Mentel
Had Fallen With a Bullet
in His Brain.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 4.â The body of Wil
liam F. Mentel, the young man who was
killed in this city by his bride of a month,
was interred to-day in the Masonic ceme
tery in San Francisco. No ceremonies
preceded the burial and no mourner fol
lowed the body to its last resting place.
The remains were interred in a plain
redwood coffln. The only embellishments
were four handles devoid of ornament
and a nickel plate on which was en
graved the name and age of the deceased.
This morning Mrs. James Kerwin of San
Francisco and Miss Johanna Mentel, sis
ters of the murdered man, took a final
look at the corpse, the undertaker closed
the coffln lid and his assistants carried it
to the awaiting hearse. â¢
The relatives of the deceased will make
no special effort to assist in the prosecu
tion of the woman who murdered the
young man. Since the death of their
parents, Mentel and his sisters have grad
ually drifted apart, and at the time of
the tragedy there was little in common
between them. His brother-in-law, J. L.
Ansel, voiced the family feeling in his
testimony last night at the Coroner's in- j
quest. He said he presumed young Men
tel had all he could do to attend to his â 
own business, and that he (Ansel) and j
his wife had found their time fully occu- !
pied doing the same. He knew nothing j
of the young man's affairs and was In- j
different as to his fate.
The autopsy physicians were Indignant i
at a statement published in a morning j
paper crediting them with the assertion
that from the course of the bullets it
was their opinion that the woman must
have been lying down when she fired the I
shots. No such testimony was given at '
the inquest. Dr. E. M. Keys, one of the j
physicians, stated to-day to a Call re
porter that all the doctors present at the I
autopsy agreed that the woman was
standing when she fired.
"From the course of the bullets and
the nature of the wounds any other the- >
ory is preposterous," said the doctor, i
"Any assertion that we gave out the
statement that the shots were flred by a
person lying on the ground is absolutely '
false."
The doctor said that the first shot to j
take effect was the one that passed
through the head. He stated that the '
bullet that inflicted the flesh wound rang- I
ing from the left nipple to the fleshy por
tion of the right shoulder was fired af
ter deceased had fallen to the sidewalk. ;
He bases this assertion on the fact that j
the bullet was found imbedded just under 'â 
the skin of the shoulder. He said it j
would have passed through the skin had !
it not come" in contact with some hard
surface. The deceased ten sugntl\ oil
his right side, and the physicians claim i
that his shoulder was resting on the !
stone sidewalk, which checked the bullet j
in its course. The leaden missile is flat- j
tened on the point, but no other portion of |
it shows evlden.ee of having come in con- j
tact with any hard substance. The au
topsy showed it had not struck any of
the bones.
Young Uriue's Sad Death.
OAKLAND, Dec. 4.â The death of Mrs.
Elmer Blair, which occurred on Thansgiv
ing day at the home of her grandfather,
James Stephens, near Chico, was doubly
sad on account of her youth and being a
bride of but two months. She was former
ly Miss Worley. The young woman having
heard of several railroad accidents had
telegraphed on Monday to her husband
to learn whether or not he had been in
jured, he being employed on the railroad
at Rocklin. Failing to receive a prompt
answer she was suddenly taken 111 at the
telegraph office, and was taken to the
Stephens residence, but she grew worse
and her nervous attack developed Into
spinal meningitis.
Death of Martin Mendenhall.
OAKLAND, Dec. 4.â Martin Menden
hall, another pioneer, died at his home
near Llvermore a few days ago. His ill
ness commenced over a year ago with a
cancerous growth on one of his hands,
and, though treated by specialists, the
disease afterward reappared on his rigÂ».i.
side, and during the past seven months
he was contlned to his bed, suffering ex
cruciatingly. Deceased was a native of
Qwvne County, Ohio, aged 70 yars. In
'49 he came across the plains to California
with ox teams and engaged in cattle rais
ing. He leaves three childrenâ Mri. Clara
Carey, Mrs. Edward Allen and Mcs. Dora
Brock, ali cf Livermore.
Luther P. Fisher's Funeral.
OAKLAND. Dec. 4.â The last request of
the late Luther P. Fisher, made in a
letter which was found after his death
last week, wherein he tabooed the use of
a casket and hearse, will be Ignored, and
the funeral will take place to-morrow
morning at 10:30 o'clock from the First
Congregational Church. Dr. Mooar will
officiate, and will be assisted by the
pastor, Rev. Dr. Brown. These arrange
ments were finally decided upon last
night when Miss Lucy B. Fisher, daugh
ter of the deceased, arrived from Phila
delphia.
New Deputy Coroner for Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 4.â lt Is announced
that a change will te made In the office
of Deputy Coroner for Alameda as soon
as Coroner-elect Mehrman takes office.
At present the position is held by James
Fowler. Dr. Mehrman stated this even-
Ing that many appeals had been made to
him to change the Alameda deputy, and
that while he had the matter under con
sideration he had reached no definite con
clusion. Much influence has been brought
to bear to have him give the office to H.
G. Gallagher, and it is admitted by the
Coroner's friends here that If a change
in the deputyshlp is made Gallagher will
get the appointment.

SOLD WIFE FOB JACKKNIFE.
The True Story as Belated by the
Man Who Purchased the Wife.
A visitor here who had been fishing in
the lower waters of Cheat River in West
Virginia told the following story, which,
if it be without merit in every other par
ticular, has the merit of being true, says
a Deer Park dispatch to the Baltimore
Sun.
'*A party of four, two visitors and two
expert fishermen from this vicinity, went
into the wilds of West Virginia on Cheat
River to fish for bass. We met with one
old man over 70 years who had newr
seen a railroad train, although he had
lived within a few miles of the Baltimore
and Ohio ever since it had been con
structed. Another queer character we
met while we were encamped In the wild
derness was a little fellow who claimed
to be a Constable or some other sort of
a peace officer. He told us of two men
living in the neighborhood who had some
years previously traded wives, one giv
ing the other a jackknife to boot. We
questioned his veracity, but he vehe
mently declared his story was true, and
gave us the names of the parties.
"After two days' hard fishing In the
roughest stream I have ever tried to
wade. with poor success, we started
across the mountains on our return. We
had not gone many miles when we met
a man apparently 55 years of age. We
stopped to make some Inquiry in refer
ence to the roads, and, recalling the
Constable's story, asked the stranger If
he had ever heard of two men
In that neighborhood who had ex
changed wives, one giving the other a
jackknife to boot. He replied that he
knew all the parties very well, and said
he knew all about the jackknife trade,
as it was called, but that the story
was often told incorrectly. W T e asked
him if he would give us the true version
of the affair, and, remarking that we
were strangers, he agreed to tell us what
we were anxious to know. This is the
story he told us, and I think it lays the
'Strange Scheme of Randolph Mason' in
the shade. %B*H to the story.
" 'Christian Maslin and Eliza J. Dodson,'
said the stranger, 'were married In the
year 1870, in Fayette County, Pa., by one
Isaac Justice. Ine young people settled
down and began housekeeping in Pennsyl
vania, where they lived together about
two years. Maslin was somewhat dissi
pated, and in consequence things did not
go smoothly wita the couple. After two
years of married life in Fayette County,
Pa., they returned to West Virginia and
separated, the young wife returning to her
father's home. The husband settled down
to farming, or what they call farming in
this country. Maslin hired as his house
keeper a sprightly young woman named
Louisa A. Grimes, who remained at the
head of his cabin establishment for about
three years. At the end of "that time Mas
lin was desperately in love with the
housekeeper, and wished to marry her,
but Maslin's wife, who was living in the
same neighborhood, was in the way.
" 'At this time Maslin met me, Samuel
M. Williams, and told me he wished to get
rid of his wife. I a"ked him why he did
not sell her. Maslin replied that he would
sell her quick enough if htf could get any
one to buy, and aslted me what 1* would
give. I happened to have at that time an
old rusty jaokknife, and told him I would
give him the knife for his wife. He sÂ»ald
tie would take it, and the deal was made
right there. The next day Maslin and I
went to the County Clerk and I got a li
cense to marry Mrs. Maslin. whom I had
purchased, and he got a. license to marry
his housekeeper, Grimes.
" 'At this time Mrs. Maslin was
employed by Andrew Sinkler. We
all met at his house on February 28,
1R74. and were married by Preacher Sam
uels. Maslin and his housekeeper, wife
No. 2, still live together, and have a large
family. Mrs. Maslin and I lived very hap
pily together for two years. At the end
of that time she returneu home and staid
there two years, and then returned to me.
We lived happily until February, 1898,
when she again left me and went to live
with her brother.
" 'About two years ago there was a
great revival in the German Baptist
Church in our neighborhood, and I be
came a member of that church. Some of
the officers of tne church heard of my
strange story, and the matter was in
vestigated by the church authorities,
who decided that I must get a divorce or
leave the church, as our marriage was
unlawful, and they said it was a clear
case of living in adultery. I am now on
my way to consult a lawyer to get me
out of this scrape. I don't know what is
to become of Maslin.'
"From the simple way In which this
man told his story it seems never to have
occurred to him that any law had been
violated or that any wrong had been done.
Maslin Is stilf living with wife No. 2.
and seems to have no fear of punishment
here or hereafter."

THE r OLD KIND OF DOCTOB.
Many of us remember the old country
doctor and can recall his shrewd,
beaten face, "frosty but kindly." A few
of us have seen him in his gig drawn by a
spirited and energetic horse. Next to Lie
pastor ho was the most Important mem
ber of the village community, and within
a circle of ten miles everybody knew "the
old doe," and he knew everybody and
everybody's horse and dog. Usually he
had a college degree, and retained a
pretty good taste in literature. His pro
fessional training was acquired by an ap
prenticeship to his predecessor, supple
mented perhaps by "walking the hos
pitals." Possibly he was not very scien
tific, but some of his remedies were of
wondrous potency and reached down
clear to where you lived and stirred up
the foundations of things as the pastor's
theology stirred up the conscience. He
gave no sugar-coated pellets, but good
Calvinlstic pills of his own compounding,
of a searching and uncompromising qual
ity, "trying the hearts of men" and cal
culated for what Virgil (or is it Horace?)
refers to as "the robust entrails of tne
mowers." The large ones, as we remem
ber, were roundish masses of material of
a putty-like consistency and dark color,
and were called "boluses." Boluses were
not administered to children.
T T nder a humorous and whimsical and
sometimes crusty exterior the old doctor
concealed kindliness and sympathetic in

GET BANCROFT'S
MANY VOLUMES
Regents Anxious to
Secure His Library.
A WORLD-FAMOUS COLLECTION
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ITS
NATURAL HOME.
The Opinion Freely Expressed That
It Should Never Be Permitted
to Be Sold Outside the
Stat*.
The Bancroft Library, one of the most
valuable of its kind In the world, may fin
ally find a place In the University of Cali
fornia, where, it is generally conceded, it
properly belongs. Regeiits of the uni
versity have had a number of conferences
with Librarian Rowell of the State in
stitution of learning, and they will bring
every Influence to bear in order that the
valuable manuscripts may not be lost to
the students of California.
The library, which is the property of
Hubert Howe Bancroft, is valued at from
$230,000 to $500,000, and has been on the
market for some years. Several Eastern
colleges have been mentioned as possible
purchasers from time to time, but a sale
has yet to be consummated. The ma
terial Is chiefly in manuscript form, and
was used in the compilation of the his
tories bearing Mr. Bancroft's name. Some
kindly critics have made the assertion
that the original material is better than
the finished product, which was com
piled by all sorts and conditions of people
irrespective of their* qualifications for the
work. The library is contained in a brick
warehouse on Valencia street, near
Twenty-seventh. It is simply stored
there In a fireproof building. There Is no
thought of making it available for
students or others. The data it contains
was compiled at great expense of both
energy and money. It covers the entire
history of the Pacific Coast, and for that
reason is the desire so strong that it
should remain here for all time where its
value would be duly appreciated and
where it would be sacredly treasured.
Discussing the matter vesterdfly Regent
Ernest A. Denicke, who is doing yeoman
duty for the university, said: "The
matter of the purchase of the Bancroft
Library has never been discussed at any
meeting of the regents. We all appre
ciate the advantage, however, of securing
this great collection, feeling that to let it
go out of the State would be a great
public calamity. We have no fund avail
able for its purchase, as our book fund
amounts in the course of a year to but
a few thousand dollars. There are only
two ways that I can see by which we
may secure the library; either by the
Legislature apportioning sufficient money
or by some public-spirited man purchas
ing it and presenting it to the university
in his name.
"As to its value, that is something that
cannot be fixed readily. There is nothing
like it in the world, so there is no pre
cedent by which its value can be deter
mined. It is not like an ordinary collec
tion of books such as may be found in
any stationer's shop and which may have
a certain well-defined commercial value.
In common with all persons who have the
good of the university at heart, I hope
some means may be devised that will
place all this valuable historical ma
terial at the disposal of the boys and girls
who are being educated at Berkeley."
A MILLION MILLION.
What Might Have Happened if Fath
er Adam Had Had a Mathe-
matical Bent.
Professor Wagstaff, whose very name
suggests a pleasing first cousinshlp to
Shakespeare, Ras lately been amusing
himself and his audience at Gresham
College by speculations as to what
might have happened If the father of
our human race had given up delving
and taken to figures. Let us suppose
that Adam had set himself to count a
million million, or, in figures. 1,000,000,
000,000. We will imagine that he could
count three in a second, which, though
not exactly rapid ciphering, will be
found ample, if taken continuously.
Now, if 6000 years have elapsed since
the gracious amenities of Eden formed
the cradle of humanity, Adam vToula
have been working for 189,216,000,000
seconds and have reached a total of
567,648,000,000 figures. In other words,
his task of counting a million million
would still have been unaccomplished
by over four hundred thousand million
digits. All of which goes to prove
what? There are many possible con
clusions. The first is, of course, that
Professor Wagstaff is a very ingenious
and by no means melancholy mathema
tician; but that hardly needed
proof. A second deduction, which we
advance with all humility, is that if
Adam had only had habitual recourse
to harmless dissipation of this arith
metical kind, instead of betraying mar
ital weakness and a fondness for fruit,
his descendants would have been very
much better off morally and spiritually,
though not perhaps In material com
forts. And a third conclusion, emi
nently gratifying to those who refuse
to believe that there is any serious dis
cord between religion and science, is
that Professor Wagstaff, no doubt a
man of distinction in scientific attain
ments, accepts without demur Bishop
Ussher's chronology.
According to the divine the world was
created in 4004 B. C. and that, added
to the 1898' years which have elapsed
since the Christian era, makes in round
numbers the 6000 years on which the
whole calculation depends. Some way
ward "scientists" have dogmatically
affirmed that the world has been wag
ging along a good many more centuries
than Ussher supposed, although there
is a serious difference, it is true, in
this matter between the astronomers
and the geologists. So, after all, per
haps. If Adam had been reasonably in
dustrious. He would have had time to
accomplish his task, unless his brain
had given way under the strain. Most
of us have such vague ideas as to the
meaning of large figures that it is as
well to be reminded by so happy an il
lustration how many units go to the
making of a million. The only other
conceivable fashion in which such in
struction could be acquired is to be
come a South African "boss" c.-f mines
and diamonds, and that process, much
as we may desire it, is, fortunately or
unfortunately, not open to the majority
of us. â London Telegraph.
CONCERNING EABS IN SCHOOL
BOOMS.
Defective hearing Is a symptom fre
quently seen in the schoolroom about
which teachers should know something.
Pupils are sometimes considered back
ward and stupid whose worse fault is
their deafness. This Is not as common,
probably, as defective sight, but it is
quite as apt to be neglected and to lead
to disastrous results. Head colds, dis
eased conditions of the pharynx and ton
sils, and discharges from the external ear
are all common with children in this cli
mate, and are all prolific sources of per
manent deafness.
The teacher is in a position to detect
this symptom early, and should Investi
gate every case of apparent Inattention
and stupidity, especially if it is notced
that this is accompanied with persistent
mouth-breathing. The teacher can easily
inform herself about a child's hearing and
quite accurately; thus a child should be
able to hear words spoken in a clear, low
voice twenty feet away, and should be
able to hear a watch tick three feet from
either ear. Children with defective hear
ing should, of course, be seated near the
teacher's desk. Parents' attention should
always be called to this symptom, for it
is usually possible to cure it when early
treatment is instituted. Neglected, it is
very sure to become permanent.âSanita
rian.

MAJOR MOORE
CHARGED WITH
BASE CONDUCT
Made Dishonorable Proposals to
Several Lady Typewriters
in His Office.
Ex-Collector Wise Is in Washington to As
sist in Taking the Scalp of the Special
Agent of the Treasury.
The Custom-house volcano has belch
ed forth a scandal, the biggest one that
has been known for years. It is not
in the Chinese Bureau this time, but
it was bred within the most sacred and
innermost rocesses of the office of Ma
jor Horace A. M ore, Special Agent of
the treasury.
The news comes from Washington
and is of sufficiently grave import to
justify the belief that the major will
lose his official head, not from any po
litical cause but because of a serious
moral delinquency. He is charged with
conduct unbecoming an officer of the
United States Government in this that
he made Improper proposals to a lady
typewriter, whom he locked in his office
and cursed and abused her in a brutal
manner because she refused to accede
to his demands.
Ex-Customs Collector John H. Wise
is now in Washington and Is in pos
on of all the facts bearing upon
the case. What makes the matter yet
blacker is the fact that this is not Ma-
Jor Moore's first offense. He appears
singularly susceptible to lady
typewriters, and the door-locking epl
sode just mentioned is checked up
against him as the latest of three at
least.
The story told by the typewriter sev
eral weeks ago to her nearest friends
bears the mr ress of truth. The lady
is a church member in good standing
and bears an unassailable reputation.
She is alone and without a dollar in the
world. Through the influence of
friends she secured a position in Major
Moore's office in the Appraisers' build
ing, and, being an accomplished sten
ographer, no fault was found with her
work until after she had spurned the
dishonorable proposition made to her
by Major Moore.
She relates that one day when Gen
eral Vernon and Messrs. Gassaway and
Charming were out of the office the
major turned the key in the lock and
attempted to carry out his base de
signs. The lady resisted and so for
cibly that the major was obliged to un
lock the door and release her from the
perilous predicament in which he had
placed her.
She was too good a woman to keep
the dreadful affair a secret, and, smart
ing with indignation, humiliation and
shame, she related the distressing in
cident to her friends, among whom was
Rolla V. Watt of the Young Men's
Christian Association. Her poverty
prevented her from leaving her situa
tion and by the advice nf her friends
she continued at her desk, but she and

' the major did not speak except on
j business.
Not long after the affair of the locked
door the special agent informed Col
lector Jackson that the typewriter was
incompetent and that he had no use for
her. The Collector, suspecting nothing
wrong, and not having heard of the
amorous exploit of the major, ordered
her discharged. Her friends at this
Juncture saw that it was their duty to
reveal the truth and they told the Col
lector the story of the persecution ot
the woman. They told him further
that alter she had rejected the major's
advances the major cursed and swore
at her whenever they were alone, prob
ably with the object of driving her
from the office. They assured the Col
lector that if he deprived the lady of
her position he would become morally
a party to a crime.
Colonel Jackson, without a moment's
hesitation, countermanded the order
and advised the young woman to re
main where she was. In order to place
her where the major could not abuse
her without being heard and seen her
typewriter was moved from the ma
jor's private office to the outer room,
in which are the desks of Messrs. Gas
saway, Vernon and Charming.
The strangest part of the story is
yet to be told. Major Moore was vis
ited by a prominent friend of his em
ploye, a lady, and was chided for his
ungentlemanly actions. In response to !
her remonstrances he declared that he !
was infatuated with his typewriter and i
that he could not help making love to
her.
Former amorous episodes of the ma
jor have been common talk in the Cus
tom-house for many months. About
two years ago the major had an au
burn-haired typewriter in his office and
she complained to Collector Wise, who
assigned her to another department.
The matter was the subject of an in
vestigation, but it is said the report
was throttled before it could get start
ed on the road to Washington. Only a
few months ago the major fell in love
again. This time the object of his so
called affection was the tppewriter of
a prominent Federal official upstairs.
She complained to her employer and
refused to go to the major's office any
more to assist him in his work.
There is also a typewriter in Los An
gelesâbut that is another story.
Ex-Collector Wise does not love the
major, and there are others. Where
fore the story of his multiple love is
related in the corridors of the White
House and in the hotels of Washington,
and the wise men in po-litics say the
affair will end in the departure of the
major from the too-stimulating climate
of California.

Chief of Police Lees visited Chinatown
yesterday to see for himself what might
be done to put down the reign of terror

others will be adopted.
The Chief was piloted by Lieutenant
Price and expressed himself entirely
satisfied with the work so far done by
that officer and Lieutenant Esola, A
number of the highbinder dens which
have been broken up were visited, and

the Chief remarked that it looked as if
the hatchetmen had moved. The Chief
also went into a numuer of the so-called
merchant clubs with a view to seeing
what might be done to stop the gambling

BURGLARS IN A GUNSTORE
Entrance Effected to Ladd's Store by a Rope From the Third Story
of the Hobson House and by Forcing Open the Rear Window.
A DARING burglary was commit
ted in E. H. Ladd's gun store,
421 Kearny street, between 8
o'clock Saturday night, when the
store was closed, and 6 o'clock yester
day morning, when evidence of the
visit of the burglars was discovered.
The police were notified and Detec
tive Cody and Policeman Colen were
detailed on the case. They were not
long in recovering the property sto-
len. but have not yet been able to dis
cover who the men were that commit
ted the burglary.
The. strangest part of the case Is the
mode of ingress adopted by the bur
glars. They got Into the Hobson

Held Yesterday.
IMPRESSIVE AND SOLEMN
INVOCATION BY FATHEB WY
MAN OF THE FAULISTS.
Large Audience Assembles to Wit
ness the Ceremonies That Are
an Annual Feature of the
Organization.
Beautifully rendered and solemnly Im
pressive were the memorial exercises held
under the auspices of San Francisco
I>odge No. 3, Benevolent and Protective
Order of Elks, in the California Theater
yesterday afternoon. The first Sunday in
December of each year is set apart by
the Elks for the purpose of paying tribute
to the memory of members who have
passed away during the preceding twelve
months, and the ceremonies of yesterday
were but the carrying out of the annual
prjKramme. Seldom, if ever, has the oc
casion born marked by such deep interest
and thorough preparation. For the first
time in the history of San Francisco, if
not of the country, a Catholic priest was
numbered among those who took part in
the services conducted under the auspices
of a secret order, the Rev. H. H. Wyman,
the Paulist father, pastor of St. Mary's
Church, delivering the invocation.
The stage was simply but tastefully
decorated with huge bunches of white
chrysanthemums, potted palms and smi
lax, the latter also being gathered in fes
toons around the boxes and the proscen
ium arch. Raised on a platform in the
rear of the stage, so that it appeared to
be standing among the rocks of its native
wilds, it-ss a magnificent specimen of the
elk family, while at the front of the stage.
Its spreading antlers forming a sort of
frame for the altar, was an elk head of
unusual size and beauty, with twelve elec
tric lamps placed on the separate tips. A
white shaft fifteen 'feet high, made of
chrysanthemums and bearing the inscrip
tion "Lodgn No. 3, P. B. O. E.," occupied
a prominent position on the right of the
stage.
Tne theater was filled to overflowing
with members of the lodge and their
friends and visiting Elks from abroad. On

store, and made their way to the third
story to an unoccupied room in the
rear to the north â  : I of the building.
They had provided themselves with a
rope sixty feet in length and tied one
end of it to a waterpipe outside the
window. They made their way down
this rope to the rear of the gun store
and opened one of the windows with
the use of a "jimmy." There was an
Iron bar across the window, but they
succeeded in removing it. Inside they
attempted to break open the safe, but
the clumsy way they went about it
leads the police to beHevo that they
were amateurs at safecracking. They

IN MEMORY OF THE DEAD.
Oakland Elks Bob the Grave of Its
Victory.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 4.
Oakland Lodge No. 171, Benevolent and
only managed to break off the handle
and to destroy the combination.
Failing in their attempt to break
open the safe they turned their atten
tion to the stock and selected six Par
ker breech-loading guns, a dozen pock
et-knives, thirteen otter skins and a
field glass. They also stole $25 that
was in the cash drawer. In their
hurry to get away they left the rope
dangling from the third-story window
and it was the sight of it yesterday
morning at 6 o'clock that led. to the
discovery of the burglary.
Detective Cody and Policeman Colen,
after making an investigation of the
store along with the proprietor, made
a search of the Hobson House and dis
covered the stolen articles on a land
ing on the second story that faces a
well. The only thing missing was the
$25. The officers are on tlte hunt for
the burglars. There is a suspicion tnat
they were inmates of the Hobson
House and waited for the chance when
one of the rear rooms was unoccupied.
About ten years a^o, when the store
was occupied by Shreve & Co., it was
entered by burglars and considerable
stock stolen. At that time entrance
was effected by means of a rope from
the second story of the Mobson House.
The burglars' occupied a room on that
story, having engaged it to work their
ends.
Protective Order of Elks, held memorial
services at the Macdonough Theater this
afternoon out of respect to their depart
ed brethren. The auditorium was crowd
ed, ;ind the decorations were of the usual
appropriate order.
I George W. Reed, the exalted ruler of the
lodge, presided, and the order of exer
cises opened with a sacred overture, "The
Omnipotence," by F. Schubert, given by
the orchestra under the direction of
Louis Homeir.
The eulogy, "In Memoriam," was de
livered by George E. De Golia. who dwelt
briefly upon the good fortune of the
| lodge in losing but one brother during the
past year, Frank P. Thwaites, \%ho pass
ed away last June. The others wnose
memories were respected are: Julius
O. Frye. William A. Moore, John W.
Wood, Thomas A. Downey, Frederick H.
Meyers, James Vance, Hugo D. Schroeder,
Edwin H. Campbell and George W. Wat
son.
"One of the keystones of our order is to
write the faults of our departed brethren
on the sands." said Mr. De Golia, "where
the continual washing of the tide effaces
every traof-; but their virtues we inscribe
in indellible lines upon the tablets of love
and memory."
After responses by officers of the lodge,
Edward Benjamin delivered a stirring ad
dress on "The Order; Its Objects, Its Ori
gin and Its Traits of Charity."
During the services appropriate songs
were sung by the Male Quartet, and Miss
Mary Alveta Morse sang a soprano solo,
O, Divine Redeemer."

ture last night on the "History of the
Church." He followed out the progress

the church by Christ until the close of
the third century, A. D.
"There are four phases In which the
early history of the church may be most
advantageously considered," he said.
"First, that it was one; second, that It
was holy; third, that it was Catholic, and
fourth, that it was apostolic."
Dr. Spaulding then dealt at length with
the advancement of religion In regard to
each categorical division.
