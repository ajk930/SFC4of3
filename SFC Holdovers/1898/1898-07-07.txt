MURDER RUNS RIOT ON THE
DECK OF A SINKING SHIP
COLLISION WRECKS
LA BOURGOGNE AND
SIX HUNDRED PERISH
Frenzied Seamen Slay Men, Women and
Children in a Fi^ht for Possession
of the Boats.
NEW YORK. July 6. â The French line steamship La Bourgogne was sunk in collision
with the British iron ship Cromartyshire early on the morning of July 4, sixty miles south of
Sable Island. Of 725 souls on board 535 were drowned, including 207 first and second
class cabin passengers. All the first cabin passengers were lost, and of 300 women passengers
on the ill-fated vessel only one was saved.
That concisely tells the story of a tragedy that is stained with dishonor. Passengers and
crew were alike in the awful struggle for self that turned the deck of the liner into a shambles
and made the ocean a scene of deliberate murder of helpless women and men, and by the very
ones to whom they had intrusted their lives.
The crash came at 5 o'clock in the morning, when, in a dense fog. the ocean greyhound
struck the Cromartyshire and passed on in the gray light to plunge to the bottom, drawing down its
helpless victims in the whirling surge that marked the spot where she had floated.
In the few minutes that elapsed between the shock and the disappearance the greater hor
ror of the disaster was enacted. In an instant the quiet deck of the liner was transformed into an
inferno. Women who obstructed the way of strong men to the boats were struck down with
knives. The steerage had contained many Italians, and it seemed as though in the face of death

a thirst for blood came upon them. Right and left their weapons flashed and trampled bodies
marked their course.
The officers, who died as brave men, were powerless to control their mad passengers and
madder crew. The second officer of La Bourgogtie did the work of a dozen heroes. But his
efforts were almost immediately set at naught by the cowardice of his frenzied crew.
One raft on which forty women were placed had been made fast to the ship's side.
It was dragged down by the ship and all on it perished. Not one man would pause to cut the
lines and give them life.
When the ship had gone down the few boats that floated were surrounded by the perishing.
Some women caught the lines of one cockleshell, not endangering the occupants and merely
keeping their heads above water. In pure fiendishness the men of the crew cut the ropes and be
came murderers.
In other cases men who struggled to keep themselves above water by clutching the gun
wales were beaten back to death with oars and boathooks.
The British ship that had been in collision stood near by and for hours kept up the work of
rescue. Then she was towed into Halifax.
Marvelous was the endurance displayed by those who had been in the water for hours.
The officers of the Bourgogne to a man went down with the ship. One came to the surface
and was saved.
WOMEN SLAIN LIKE
SHEEP IN SHAMBLES
HALIFAX, N. 8.. July 6.â ln one of
the thick fogs which at this time of
the year hang like a pall over the
Grand Banks and Sable Island In the
North Atlantic, occurred, on the early
morning of July 4. one of the most ap
palling ocean disasters in the annals of
transatlantic commerce, and, in fact,
in the history of steam sailing of the
world. Without a moment's warning,
almost, the great French liner La
Bourgogne, with 725 souls on board,
was run dr>wn by the iron sailing ship
Oromartyshire and sank within a half
hour, carrying with her to the ocean's
bottom over 500 of her passengers and
crew, while the balance, who were not
draws down by the fearful suction,
struggled and fought for life until one
hundred and sixty-three were at length
rescued by the crew of the Cromarty
shir", which ship survived the colli-
The story of the fearful disaster from
the few officers and members of the
crew who were saved is yet to be told,
but if the words of the passengers who
were dragged aboard the Cromarty
shire and later brought into this port
by the steamer Grecian, are to be be
lieved, the last few minutes on board
the La Bourgogrne witnessed some of
the most terrible Rcenes of horror and
cruelty that have blotted the history
of a civilized race.
Instead of heroic discipline which so
often has been the one bright feature of
such awful moments the crew of the
steamer fought like demons for the few
life boats and rafts, battering the help
less passengers away fro: 1 their only
means of salvation, with the result
that the strong overcame the weak, for
the list of 163 saved contains the name
of but one woman. The disaster oc
curred at 5 o'clock in the morning on
Monday. July 4, about sixty miles
south of Sable Island, which lies nearly
a hundred miles off this port.
The Bourgogne had left New York
bound for Havre the previous Satur
day, while the Cromartyshire was on
her way over from Glasgow with a
crew of twenty-one men. Although
the transatlantic steamships have a
definite course the Bourgogne was, by
all accounts, forty miles or more to the
north of these lines.
The fog was very dense and the Cro
martyshire was calling along with re
duced canvas and blowing the fog horn.
Suddenly out of the fog rushed a great
steamer and in a moment there was a
| fearful crash, the iron prow of the
ship plunging into the port side of the
steamer just under the bridge.
The shock was terrific and tore a
| tremendous hole in the steamer while

The Cromartrshfre was rounded to,
and her master. Captain Henderson,
! was considerably relieved in finding
that she was in no danger of sinking.
Off to the eastward could be heard the
hoarse call of the steamer, and as the
fog began to lift all the boats- on the
ship were launched. Half an hour after
the collision the misty curtain went un

on board the Bourgogne. The collision
had come so suddenly and at such a
time in the morning that few besides
her crew were on - deck, but the shock
aroused nearly every one, and within
a few minutes the decks were crowded
At first it seemed as if there was
some attempt at discipline. A few of
the boats were swung off and some of
But l^ S th n / c [ S a " mv Â£ d to set into them.
But as the steamer began to settle and
list to pert the officers lost control of
the crew and a panic ensued.
Passengers and crew fought for the
boats and life rafts. The strong bat
tered down the weak, the women and
children being pushed far away from
any hope of rescue. Fists, oars' and
even knives wore used b*- some of the
demons to keep their places. The offi
cers seemed to have been powerless
over their own men and only four we're
saved.
The fight for life on the decks of the
steamer did not last long, for In a lit
tle more tlian a half hour she gave a
long lurch to port and went down.
As the ship sank beneath the surface
the vortex of the waters sucked down
everything on the surface within a cer
tain radius. When the suction ceased
those still alive saw about 200 bodies
come out of the water with a rush, as
if the sea were giving: up the dead after
having swallowed the ship. But the
struggle for life still continued after
the ship went down. Hundreds still
floated about, grasping for rafts, boats
and wreckage in frantic- endeavor to
keep above water. Even then many
of those in the boats, if the stories told
are to be believed, showed their bru
tality by beating off those who at
tempted to climb aboard.
By this time the small boats of the
Cromaityshire had come up and the
work of rescue began. The crew of the
ship worked heroically and saved every
one who had managed to keep above
water, but even then scores fell away
from boats, rafts and wreckage, ex
hausted, and were drowned. Ii was all
over in an hour, although for some
time great pieces of wreckage came
shooting up from the bottom, marking
| the spot where the great liner had gone
I down. But little attempt was made to
recover the bodies of any of the ill
fated passengers or crew, and the bat
tered hulk at the bottom of the ocean
will probably be their tomb.
In the afternoon the steamer Grecian
was sighted, coming from the west
ward, and a few hours afterward the
Cromartyshire was in tow and arrived
here this morning.
Strangely enough, Mr. La Casse is
the only man of the saloon and cabin
passengers who survived, while his
wife is the only woman of 300, not only
of the first saloon cabin but of the
whole' ship, who escaped. Mrs. La
Casse was roused from her berth by
her husband, who was on deck at the
time of the collision. When she
reached the deck of the listing steam
ship she saw the captain of the steam
er on the bridge and some of the offi
cers at other points endeavoring to di
rect the efforts of the crew to launch
the bodts. There was little response
to the orders of the officers. The crew
seemed paralyzed. Matters were quiet
and there was no panic at first,
though the decks were becoming more
and more crowded with frightened
people.
The steamer was listing and settling
and then a wild fear seized on the
throng and the people lost their reason.
Mrs. La Casse was separated from
her husband in the scramble, and the
steamer listed so badly, that she slid
down the declivity of the deck and into
the water. She had taken the precau
tion, nt her husband's direction, to put
on a life belt before leaving her state
room, and shortly after being thrown
into the sea she was seized by the arm
and drawn upon the life raft. Her
savior was her husband. A moment
later the ill-fated steamer disappeared
PRICE FIVE CEKTS.
and a whirlpool encircled the spot where
the noble craft had been. Everybody
around the vortex was drawn into It.
The water rushed areund, faster and
faster, and the unfortunates disap
peared v. Ith despairing cries.
Mrs. La Casse had been on the edga
of the maelstrom, but something threw
her outside of the whirlpool, and the
next she knew she was on the- life raft.
A boat containing forty women was
capsized and all went down in the
whirlpool. There was not t-ne man in
this boat, a*~ it was left fast to the
davits. Some of the women were try
ing to cut the ropes when the steamer
careened and capsized the boat.
Mrs. La Casse says that a moment
after the steamer was engulfed men,
women and children arose on every
side .of the whirlpool, ami the sight of
the faces and the arms and the sound
of shrieks was so terrible that she will
remember them to her dying day.
Mrs. La Casse says that when the
panic first seized the crew men fought
for positions in the boats like rav
ing maniacs. Women ! were forced
back from the boats and trampled
on by men, who made self-preser
vation their first object. Among
them were a large number of the lower
class of Italians and foreigners, who
in their frenzy stopped at nothing that
promised safety for themselves.
. So desperate was the situation that
an Italian passenger drew his knife and
made direct at one who, like himself,
was endeavoring to reach the boats.
Immediately his action was imitated In
every direction. Knives were nour
ished and used with effect. Women and
children were driven back to inevitable
death at the point of -weapons, the own
ers of which were experts in their use.
According to stories of the survivors
women were stabbed like so many
sheep.
The scene on the water was even
worse. Many of the unfortunates who
were struggling in the water attempted
to drag themselves into the boats or on
rafts. Th- were pushed back.
Here, too, knives were used freely.
Not all of the dead met death by drown
ing. Christopher Brunon saw a sailor
belonging to La Bourgogne strike a
passenger over the head with a bar and
kill him. The body dropped into the
water. The passenger grabbed the boat
in which the sailor was and attempted
to get on board.
Matte O. Zurich, a Norwegian, said
it did not appear to be anybody's duty
to look after the launching of- the boats.
Those on the port side were not touched
by the crew. People climbed into them,
waiting for the boats .to be launched,
but in a short time Uie steamer listed
so rapidly it was impossible to do so.
Zurich declares that two of the life
rafts upon which people were saved
were cut adrift by him. He was unable
to move them, but they tumbled over
board when' the steamer careened and
proved useful. The steamer slowly
settled down by the stern and star
board side and the water advancing
gradually drove the people forward.
Finally men, women and children were
walking about on the port bow. The
stern was deep In the water and the
bow in the air. The ship gave a great
plunge and hundreds of people were in
the water, grabbing at broken oars,
bits of canvas, etc., and struggling. Zu
rich went over the starboard side and
caught a raft, on which he climbed.
He thinks that had the . boats been
launched as soon as the steamer struck
several hundred who perished would
have been saved. Only one of the port
boats, a small one. was launched. That
was the boat the second purser escaped
in. Zurich saw one boat leave the
Bourgogne with only a few people on it
Fred Niftier, a Swede, lost his sweet
heart through the boats not being cut
away. The girl had on a life belt but
the suction of the sinking ship was too
powerful. i
He and the young woman got into a
boat with many others, waiting for the
sailors to launch it. The boat was
finally capsized and the girl was lost.
Niffler climbed on a life raft, which
upset, and live were drowned, for there
were many crowded on it. The others
climbed upon the raft.
Among the survivors are nine Assyri
ans and Armenians. There were 75
Assyrians in the party when it left
New York. All but eight perished, one
of the eight lost his wife and two
brothers and other relatives. Another
lost two daughters. Only one of thir
teen Armenians survives. The Assyri
ans were bound to their homes near
Damascus, and every one had from one
to two hundred dollars saved. They lost
it all, barely escaping in their trousers
and shirts. On board the steamer Gre
cian, which towed the Cromartyshire
with the survivors to Halifax, the As
syrians wept like children and could
not be comforted. The one surviving
Armenian tells a sorrowful tale of the
drowning of an Armenian priest and
his family, who had got in a boat, vvith
some thirty other people. When the
end came and the boat was abandoned
to its fate by the crew, who miile.no
effort to launch it, the priest stood up
and with uplifted hands prayed aloud.
Several French priests stood on the
deck during the sinking of the steamer
without making an effort to save them
seK'es and gave absolution to a large
crowd of passengers.
August Piyrgi was eager to give the
correspondent an account of his ex
perience. He was in the water about
half an hour and attempted to get into
a boat. He was seized wh^n he man
aged to get half in and thrown back
into the water. Again he tried to en
ter the boat, but the savages who
manned it were determined to keep
him out. He managed at last to get
in and to stay in. Clinging to the life
line of a boat not far away he saw his
mother, and as if his trials were not
enough he was forced to watch a man
shove her into the ocean with an oar.
She never rose. He said the man was
saved and was almost sure he could
recognize him.
Fred Niftier, a Swiss, was the moat
jovial and contented of all the unfor
tunate passengers. He lost all his
money and clothes, with the exception
of a pair of trousers and a shirt, but
he laughed and now and then cursed
the frenzied sailors with passionate
earnestness.
Niffler got into a lifeboat with some
others and remained there until he
reached the water, when he thought it
was time to leave. None of the sailors
ever attempted to let the boat loose.
He swam for a long time before he
was picked up. He saw an Englishman
attempt to get into a boat, but the men
in the boat, who were sailors of La
Bourgogne, hit him over the head with
the butt end of an oar. He fell back
and sank.
Christopher Brunon, a passenger, wag
thrown into the water and swam for
two hours before he found a boat. He
clung to this as his last hope. After
some time a man got hold of the same2
boat and together they managed to
ri^ht it. Under the seats they found
the bodies of four men and three wo
men who had evidently been drowned
by the capsizing of tin boat. Brunon
Bald the Beamen were cruel in their con
duct toward the passengers. He was
unable to get in the steamer's boais
when he came on deck, being shoved
away by the sailors. He saw many of
his friends being prevented from get
ting into the boats by the sailors.
Mehleni Secondi, an Italian steerage
passenger, is among the saved. When
ot on deck he found a raft with
five nan on it. The raft, however, was
tied and chained Cast to the deck and
no sailors were near to let it loose.
N( ne of the five men had knives. The
Bank rapidly and they were all
pitated Into the water. He was in
the water twenty minutes and alone,
the other five sinking before his eyes.
He came acroÃa a boat which he tried
to get into. He eventually succeeded,
but not before a desperate fight with
the crew. He was battered with oars
shoved with boathooks.
.Mrs. Henderson, wife of the captain,
was on board the Cromartyshire with
her two children. She tells a thrilling
Btory of the terrible experience. The
weather was foggy and she. had risen
from her bunk at an early hour, as
waa her custom when the weather was
bad. Shortly before the vessels came
ther she heard a whistle on the
port Bide. The Cromartyshire was
B< unding her fog horn at intervals of
Inute. Mrs. Henderson called the
attention of her husband to the sound
incs of the whistle, and a minute later
the mate, who was on watch, also de
tected the Bound. It came nearer and
nearer, and Mrs. Henderson stood by
the cabin in order to rescue her child
ren should a disaster occur.
Suddenly the huge hulk of an ocean
Bteai 1 up in the mist, going
about seventeen knots an hour. Almost
immediately there was a fearful crash
and Mrs. Henderson rushed below and
found her children awakened by the
shock. She dressed the little ones as
ly as possible and removed them
To the deck, expecting to see her own
ship go down at any minute.
Captain Henderson, as soon as the
collision occurred, ordered the boats
towered and the damage to be
ascertained. As it waa found that the
Cromartyshire was in no immediate
danger the Britisher put about. ThÂ«
: with which they had collided
was at that time unknown. A few
minutes later her whistle was heard
and several rockets were sent up. Cap
ii replied In a like man
thinking the steamer was offer-
Ing assistance, but in a few minutes all
was quiet, an<l those on board began
to realize the awful results of the col
lision.
' >n the morning of the collision Cap
tain Henderson was on th^ poop with
third mate, A. C. Stewart Bailor
- wns (.n the lookout, and First
r X ilia man was also on the fore
!;. The Cromartyshire was
making about five miles an hour, with
al sails set, nnr] taking in all the
time. Not a sound was heard until
â¢ Baley saw a large steamer
AN OCEAN GRAVEYARD.
The great disaster took place only a few miles to the eastward of Sable
Island, a spot that is known to seamen the world over as "the ocean
graveyard." It is but a low stretch of sand, and its borders are constantly
shifted by the furious seas that beat upon them and the treacherous cur
rents that come and go. Yet not a foot of the island that is now above
water but has some story of horror connected with it. Any old tar who has
visited th>> locality can spin yarns by the hour about the numerous ships'
crews who met their death on the sands of the "ocean graveyard."
It would be impossible to tell how many vessels have been wrecked on
the shores of Snble Island, but since the founding of the British Humane
Society, in 1802, a record has been kept of all the disasters that have taken
place there. They now number more than 200 vessels of all sizes, from the
stately liner to the humble fishing smack. Sable Island is about thirty
one miles in length and four miles in width. It has, however, undergone
many startling changes since it was surveyed by order of the British Ad
miralty in 1776. A portion of the island is washed away each year; in 1814
a section three miles long and forty feet wide was carried away during a
severe gale. Since the beginning of the present century it has decreased In
length about twenty-four miles and two and a half in width.
THE STORY TOLD BY THE
CROMATYSHIRE'S LOG.
HALIFAX, July 6.â The log of the Cromartyehire, signed by Cap
tain Henderson, is as follows:
"On July 4, at 5 a. m., we were In a dense fog, the position of the
ship being sixty miles south of Sable Island, the ship by the wind
on the port tack heading W. N. W., though under decided canvas and
going about four or five knots per hour. Our foghorn was being
kept going regularly every minute. At that time heard a steamer's
whistle on our west port side, or port beam, which seemed to be near
ing very fast. We blew the horn and were answered by steamer's
whistle, when all of a sudden she loomed through the fog on our port
bow and crashed into us, going at a terrific speed. Even thÂ« fore
topmast and maintop and gallant mast came down, bringing with it
yards and everything attached. I immediately ordered the boats out
and went to examine the damage. I found that our boats were com
pletely cut off and the plates twisted. The other ship disappeared
through the fog. However, our ship was iloating on her collision
bulkhead, so there seemed no immediate danger of her sinking.
"We set to work immediately to clear the wreckage and remove
our starboard anchor, which was hanging over the starboard bow and
in danger of punching holes in the vessel. I heard a steamer blow
ing her whistle on coming back and we answered with our foghorn.
The steamer then threw up a rocket and fired a shot. We also threw
up some rockets and fired several shots, but we neither saw nor heard
anything. Shortly after, or about f>:3o, the fog lifted somewhat and
we saw two boats pulling toward us with the French flag flying. We
signaled them to come alongside, and found the steamer was the La
Bourgogne, bound for Havre from New York, and that 6he had gone
down.
"We laid to all day and received on board about 200 survivors
from among the passengers and crew, reported to be in all about COO.
Several of the passengers were on life rafts without oars, and I called
for volunteers from among my crew and the surviving French sea
men to bring those rafts alongside the ship. Some of the passengers
and seamen from the sunken steamer assisted us and we jettisoned
some thirty-six tons of cargo from our forehold in order to lighten the
ship.
"At about 3 p. m. another steamer hove in sight, bound westward.
We put up our signals, *N. C (want assistance). Shortly after a
steamer bore down toward us. She proved to be the Grecian, bound
from Glasgow to New York. The captain agreed to take the passen
gers on board and also agreed to tow my ship to Halifax. Owing to
the condition of my ship I accepted the offer, and proceeded at once
to tranship the passengers and get ready our towline. At 6p. m.
we had made a connection and proceeded in tow of the Grecian toward
Halifax, having put a sail over the broken bow to take part of the
strain off the collision bulkhead. There was at that time fourteen
feet of water in the forepeak."
half a ship's length ahead on the port
bow. In an instant the Cromarty
shire's jibboom struck the Bourgogne's
bridge and the sailing vessel crushed
into the liner, staving a big hole near
the engine room. La Bourgogne
scraped the whole length of the Cro
martyshlre's port side and then she
veered off. La Bourgogne blew long,
mournful whistles for assistance. Third
Mate Stewart of the Cromartyshire
says that the Frenchman evidently
thought the Bourgogne had sunk the
colliding vessel.
At the time of the collision. Third
Mate Stewart says, La Bourgogne was
u.>ing at about the rate of eighteen or
nineteen knots an hour, through a
dense fog, shutting out everything
more than twenty yards away.
About three hours after the Cromar
tyshire picked up the survivors the
Allan liner Grecian was sighted and
took the Cromartyshire in tow. About
S o'clock that evening, three miles
away. Third Mate Stewart heard guns
and saw three rockets go up and a blue
light, the signal of distress, burning.
The Grecian signaled to the Cromarty
shire that she was going to assist the
vessel signaling. In a few minutes,
however, the light disappeared and no
more guns or rockets were discharged,
the vessel certainly having sunk. Pro
fessor La Casse, one of the survivors,
is of opinion that there was a third yes

HEARST'S SILLY
YARN LEADS TO
AN INQUIRY
GoverQmeot Will iQVestigate the
Charge That Captured Span
iards Were Beheaded.
W. ft. Hearst, acting as correspondent for his own papers, recently sent from Cuba the
story that one of his "special commissioners," who is also a Cuban soldier, had captured
and beheaded forty Spaniards. The yarn, ridiculous in itself, was made more so by the
silly embellishments. The statement, for instance, that the Cuban's face "glowed with
enthusiasm "; that he was " gracious and gentle"; that he " sniffed contemptuously " at
the idea that one of his race would do anything else than cut off the heads of captives,
stamped the narrative as fiction and inexcusable stupidity. But the Government seems to
have taken Hearst seriously and, doubtless, will brand his lie. If any Cuban, even a yel
low journalist, be fourd to be wantonly murdering prisoners, naturally the only proper
military course will bu it execute him. Is he be found to be merely a liar, as is doubtless
the case, there wit! tm nc result but a new exposure of Hearst methods.
NEW YORK, July 6.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Secretary Alger proposes to make a prompt investigation of Mr. Hearst's
charge that forty Spaniards who surrendered to a party of Cubans had
been beheaded. When I called the matter to his attention to-day he dis
credited the report.
"I have heard nothing of that character from General Shafter," he
said.
"Will you make an investigation?" I asked.
"Of course," he responded.
The Secretary took to his home a copy of the article written by Mr.
Hearst and will determine to-morrow upon the character of the action to
be taken.
Mr. Hearst's charge is not credited in official circles in the War De
partment.
"I have heard nothing of it," said Assistant Secretary Meiklejohru
"It is not true. I do not believe it."
Major General Miles was equally emphatic in his expression of dis
belief.
"I do not believe there is a single word of truth in the story," he
said to me. "If there were I would have received official notification."
Commissary General Eagan declared that the report undoubtedly
was false.
"In my opinion," said General Eagan, "Mr. Hearst's sole object in
writing such a story was to manufacture a sensation and obtain a
larger sale for his paper."
Notwithstanding the disbelief of the authorities, it was considered
wise to make an official investigation, so as to remove from the coun
try the stain which has been placed upon it by the charge that its
allies are murdering defenseless prisoners. It is expected that Secre
tary Alger will cable to-morrow to Major General Shafter directing him to
convene a court of inquiry to make a careful and thorough investigation
of the matter and to send a report to the department for his action.
Not only does Mr. Hearst's charge place this Government in an un
enviable light before the world, but the authorities say that it leaves the
door open for the Spaniards to make retaliation, and, further, will cause
them to die fighting rather than surrender to an enemy who may turn
them over to men who will promptly execute them.
Should the investigation confirm Mr. Hearst's charge, severe pun
ishment will be meted out to the men concerned. So long as the Cubans
are allies of the United States it is not proposed to permit them to mur
der defenseless prisoners and thus place upon this nation the stain of as
sisting in crime by reason of its relations with the insurgents.
It is the confident expectation of the authorities that the Cuban lead
ers will promptly disavow any connection with it, and that should it be
proved that some of the men under their command were concerned in the
reported execution of the Spaniards, they will mete out to them the punish
ment they deserve. If they do not, the United States authorities will take
the matter into their own hands.HAWAII TO COME
INTO THE UNION
ANNEXATION
RESOLUTION
IS PASSED
Senate Votes to Tal^e th)e
Hawaiian Islands Into
the Union.
Conditions Under Which the New
Territory Will Be Governed by
the United States.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, July 6.
Debate in the Senate termi
nated suddenly to-day, and the
Newlands resolution annexing
the Hawaiian Islands was passed
by a vote of 42 to 21. All the
Pacific Coast Senators, except
White, voted "aye." Early this
morning there was no indication
of a dissolution, but soon after
tl\e Senate met White. Pettigrew,
Jones and Allen held a confer
ence and decided that it was use
less to prolong- the discussion, in
asmuch as no other Senators had
expressed a desire to speak.
White. Jones. Pettigrew and
Allen had treated the project ex
haustively, and as no other Sen
ators cared to talk concluded
they would allow the vote to be
taken at once, as they did not
care to be put in the attitude of
filibusters. So Senator White
himself made the motion with
the result stated. After the vote
was announced Senator Davis,
chairman of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, telephoned the
news to President McKinley and
received the latter's congratula
tions. The resolution will be
signed by the President immedi
ately after its engrossment.
It is said that there will be no
formal ceremony in taking pos
session of the islands, bat it is de
sired that a warship may be as
signed to convey the President's
proclamation to the islands, and
that the Philadelphia may also
carry a commission to Dole as
Governor. It is quite generally
believed that Dole will be ap
pointed. Indeed, this is said to
be a part of an agreement already
entered into.
The annexation resolution pro
vides that our public land laws
shail not apply to Hawaii, but
Qongress shall enact special laws
u>v their management and dispo
sition, the proceeds to be used for
educational purposes, for the ben
efit oi the inhabitants. The Pres
ident is empowered to appoint
civil, judicial and military officers
to act until Congress shall make
provision for Hawaii's govern
ment. All existing treaties with
foreign nations shall cease forth
with and be replaced by such
treaties as may exist or such as
may be hereafter concluded by
the United States and foreign na-
lions.
The existing customs laws and
regulations between Hawaii and
the United States and other
countries shall remain in force
until Congress makes other pro
visions. The public debt of Ha
waii is assumed by the United
States Government, but the lia
bility shall not exceed four mil
lion dollars. The existing Ha
waiian Government shall con
tinue to pay the interest on this
debt as long as said Government
continues.
Diere shall be no further im
mi^ntion of Chinese into the
Hawaiian Islands, except under
conditions imposed by United
States laws, and no Chinese shall
be allowed to enter the United
Sta - es from the islands.
The President shall appoint
: live commissioners, at least two
of whom shall be residents of the
islands, who shall, as soon as
practicable, recommend to Con
gress legislation for Hawaii's
government, and $100,000 is ap
! propriated to carry the resolu
1 tion into effect.
AS THE VOTE WAS
TAKEN BY SENATE
White's Amendment Beaten and
Then the Newlands Resolutions
Passed, 42 to 21.
WASHINGTON. July 6.â The annex
ation of Hawaii is now accomplished.
SANFORD B. DOLE,
President of the b\ovja\\ar) Republic, Who Is to Be Governor of the
Territory of Hawaii-
so far as the legislative branch of the
(liivornment is concerned.
Quito unexpectedly the resolutions
providing for the annexation of the
islands were brought to a vote in the
Senate late this afternoon and they
were passed by the decisive vote of 42
to 21.
Early .n to-day's session of the Sen
ate conferences of the leaders on both
Fides of th<- chamber were held and a
tacit agreement was reached that a
VI te should be taken to-morrow or
Fr'.day at the late.st. The opponents of
annexation practically had concluded
their arguments, and as they had no
desin to keep the Senate in session by
purely dilatory tactics they announced
their willingness that a vote should be
taken ze soon as White, Pettigrew and
Allen hud finished their speeches.
Finally* at 5:30 p. m., the resolutions
themselves, in precisely the form in
which they were received from the
House of I Representative, were re
ported to the Senate and the rollcall
began. No- a sound was to be heard
in the chamber except the call of the
clerk and the responses of Senators.
When the Vice-President announced
the vote by which the resolutions were
passed a tremendous wave of applause
swept through the galleries, which the
Vice-President made no effort to
check. Those who had advocated the
resolutions expressed their pleasure by
shaking hands with one another, and
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 7, 1898.
on all sides evident relief -was shown
that the end had come. For a few
minutes so much good-natured confu
sion existed that the dignity of the
Senate was threatened, hut the Vice-
President quietly reminded the Sena
tors that the session was not yet at an
end.
The Senate concurred in the House
amendment to the peneral deficiency
bill, thus passing the last of the appro
priation measures.
At the conclusion nf Allen's speech
White offered an amendment striking
from the preamble of the Hawaiian reso
lutions the words "in due form" and in
scrtlnj? the words "by a treaty which has
never been ratified, but is now pending
in the Senate of the T'nited States."
Briefly commenting upon the dis
cussion of the situation Teller of
Cololado expressed the opinion that the
opponents of the pending resolutions had
acted in good faith and had consumed no
more time than had been necessary to
properly present their views.
In the course of a statement Davis said
he had never believed that the opponents
of the resolutions had been actuated by
any other than honest purposes and con
scientious opinions.
"I desire to say." paid he. "that I am
satisfied this earnest and able debate has
not transcended the proper parliamentary
limits essential to a full and free discus
sion."
After a statement by Hale, in which he
said he supported the resolutions, but not
as a war measure, a vote was taken on
"White's amendment. It was rejected â JO
to 20, the detailed vote being as follows:

Pettiprew then offered his amendment

rejected â 51 to L' 2.
Bacon of Georgia offered an amend
i mi'iit providing that the annexation reso
lutions should not be operative until they
i had been approved by a majority of the
electors of Hawaii. Defeatedâ 2o to 42.
Faulkner of West Virginia offered an
amendment providing that the duties of
the civil, judicial and military powers
; shall be exercised under authority of ex

AN OFFICER
DESCRIBES
THE BATTLE
Aboard the lowa During the
Crushing of Cervera's
Ships.
Furious Slaughter Followed by
Touching Courtesy to Cap
tured Spanish Officers.
NEW YORK, July 6.â ln anticipation
of the great battle between the Amer
ican fleet and the Cape Verde squad
ron, commanded by Admiral Cervera,
The Call, in combination with the New
York Herald, secured the services of
an expert naval authority on board one
of the battle-ships to write a technical
description of the fight when it oc
curred. During the engagement the
writer was at his post of duty and
could not possibly furnish his narrative
when The Call-Herald dispatch-boat
Golden Rod left the scene of action to
steam at full speed to Port Antcmio and
iile In the cable office a full account of
the battle, which The Call and Herald
printed exclusively on Tuesday morn
ing.
..nen the writer agreed to furnish
The Call and Herald with the" descrip
tion which follows he telegraphed: "1
will write the story unless Killed in bat
tle. If anything happens to me I trust
one of the other officers to be spared
will render The Call and the Herald the
service which they revest."
This account is, therefore, the first
technical description of the battle
printed anywhere. The Call regrets
that it is unable to give the signature
of the writer to the story, but strict
naval regulations prevent.
ON BOARD THE UNITED STATES
SHIP IOWA, OFF SANTIAGO, July 4,
by the Call-Herald dispatch boat Gol
den Rod to Port Antonio, July 6. â On
Sunday morning, July 3, our watching
ships lay rolli. in easy surges off the
harbor of Santiago. Their distances
fnun the guarded haven varied from
four to six thousand yards, and there,
with an unsparing alertness, they
waited for the promised dash which all
hoped for, but feared might never
come.
A little after three bells in the fore
noon watch the inspection of the ship
had been concluded, and as Lieutenant
Van Duser, the officer of the watch, was
relieving the navigating officer. Lieu
tenant Scheutze, then officer of the
deck, he heard a quick cry to call the
captain, followed by the shout, "There
come the Spaniards out of the harbor."
The trained eye of the alert officer
had marked the thin trail of drifting
smoke and before the signals "Clear
ship for action" had been given the
bows of the Spanish vessels, rushing in
"line ahead," were seen darting around
Socapa point for the open sea.
In a moment all was bustle and
trained energy. Men rushed to their
quarters, guns were trained and in less
than twenty seconds the whistling
shriek of the rapid-fire gun warned
the startled fleet of the hot work await
ing. In two minutes every gun on
shipboard was cast loose, manned,
loaded and ready for the long-expected
signal to fire.
At the yardarm of our battle-ship
a string of signal flags warned the
fleet that the enemy was trying to es
cape, but even before the answering
pennants of the other ships announced
their understanding of the message
all vessels were dashing to their sta
tions long before the allotted time, for
the emergency which had come at last.
It was a splendid spectacle. The
Spaniards with bottled steam cleared
the harbor's mouth seemingly in a mo
ment. Under their eager prows a col
umn of foam whitened the long billows
and ih.ir bubbling wakes left a furrow
as straight and sharp as a racing
yacht making a winning run for the
finish line. Their course was shaped
for the westward, but as fast as they
sped in their desperate break for free
dom, the faster flew the shells of the
pursuing Americans. Tho first heavy
sh<Ml from the lowa's battery fell short,
and then, by mischance, so did
the second, but afterward a rain of
shot fell upon the fleeing foe.
Not a whit behind in this eager fu
sillade roared the batteries of the Span
ish ships. Their port broadsides
flamed and grumbled, but it was a
splendid display of fireworks rather
than a successful effort to damage the
unharmed targets of the Yankee ships.
In fifteen minutes after they were
discovered four Spanish armored cruis
ers had cleared the entrance, and five
minutes later the torpedo-boat de
stroyers, hugging the beach and seek
ing the sheltering broadside of their
sister ships, flew into the turmoil of the
action.
At this time every gun of the Amer
ican squadron that could be brought to
bear was pumping projectiles into the
enemy. In an instant it almost seemed
one ship of the Vizcaya class burst into
flames, caused, undoubtedly, by a long
sure shot from the Oregon or Texas.
A minute later a 12-inch projectile sent
from a forward turret struck the Ma
ria Teresa near her after smokepipe.
A tremendous explosion followed. Then
phe was shrouded in smoke and was
lighted with lurid flames; and then,
when the powder cloud cleared away
she was seen helm hard a-port
rushing for the beach.
Twenty-five minutes after the first
ship had freen sighted half the Spanish
fleet had surrendered or was on fire.
As our vessels rushed toward them
every ship was hulled time and again
and it almost seemed from the sureness
and directness of our batteries as if -it
were target practice of a summer
morning, and not the annihilation of a
squadron. Even this interval would
have been shortened measurably, for
aiding them and hindering us was the
cloud of smoke which concealed and at
best only half revealed the wreck of the
enemy. It was a grand, sad sight â a
pathetic one to seamen, who know how
much patient thought and patriotic ef
fort had gone into the construction of
these splendid vessels, now lying
bruised and burning on the shores they
had hoped to defend.
There was no time, however, to in
dulge in emotions of sympathy or of
pity, for still rushing eagerly west
ward, closely followed by the New
York and at a further distance by the
Indiana, came the torpedo-boat de
stroyers. In hot' eagerness of destruc
tion we turned louse our smaller guns
on these loudly heralded and ineffec
tive craft, and finally by a lucky hit
dropped a 12-inch shell into the bow of
the leading destroyer. At the same in
stant the little Hint was rapidly clos
ing upon them, pouring a sickening
flre into their fragile hulls. The Glou
cester joined in this splendid assault,
and so sure and so effective was their
rapid flre of projectiles that both tor
pedo boats swung their helms hard-a
port, ran for slime and buried what
was left of them among the pitiless
rooks of the coast.
By a quarter past 10 we were in full
cry after the other Spanish ships, then
about four miles ahead, busy with hot
replies to the determined assaults of
the Oregon, Texas and Brooklyn. Bend
ing every energy to overtake the Co
lon, which was then live miles away
and perhaps two miles ahead in a di
rect line and a mile and a half further
inshore, we picked up the Hying Viz
caya. The game must have seemed up
to her then, f r with a quick turn to
starboard she ran shoreward, and we
saw in an instant that she was flaming
fore and aft. . . beautiful Spanish Hat;
Boating from her "-aft and another
higher still from her maintopmast
head showed her t<> be the flagship of
the second in command. She lagged
heavily In the water; no longer did she
carry the In me in her teeth and her
foaming wake was gone. When we
drew near we saw something had gone
amiss with her, for just as we swung
with a touch of our helm to give her
a finishing broadside the beautiful
Hags drifted from the truck and gaff
end and the white Hag of surrender
went up and the cheers of our ship
went with it.
We stopped our engines when close
aboard and hoisted cut our boats to
save her people. We received on hoard
250 of her crew. The Hist took another
hundred, and that was all that was
left of them, for the other hapless sail
ors were lying dead and wounded on
her burning decks.
The conflagration aboard this ship
was astounding, and even now, when
the opportunity for calm reflection has
com< it. is impossible to explain where
so much inflammable material could
have been collected on board an ar
mored vessel.
Through the air ports and gun ports
of the doomed ship quivering tires shone
with blood-red light upon the light
woodwork of the bridge and upper
deck, and long tongues of flame licked
the towering masts. Over the ship a
cloud of rosy light hovered, and when,
after a time, explosions of free powder
were added, great volumes of smoke
shut out the sky.
Several explosions of terrific force
followed, but notwithstanding this and
while the flames were still quivering
through every outlet and encircling the
hull our boats were busy rescuing
the unfortunate wounded and the more
lucky of the survivors who had sought
the water or shore as their only refuge
from a dreadful death.
When the Spanish captain of the Viz
caya, that courteous Eulate, of whom
we heard so much when his ship was
in the harbor of New York, was lifted
over the side and half carried aft, he
presented his sword to Captain Evans
as a symbol, but Evans, gentle as he
is brave, declined to receive it, and
waving it back with a friendly gesture,
he grasped the hand of the Spaniard
and welcomed his brother officer to the
hospitality of the ship.
Much affected by his reception- Cap
tain Eulate asked permission to meet
the lowa's officers and to each he gave
a warm grip of his hand and a friendly
word of gratitude before he was car
ried below. The Oregon and Brooklyn
joined in the attack, but were a little
too far out to get into the best of it,
and their efforts were directed more to
head off and catch the Colon than to
join in the general action. There was
wisdom in this, approved by all good
sailors, for they knew what work was
cut out for them and in what good
hands the other ships were left.
The glorious Texas, no longer a
"hoodoo," gave Its principal attention
to the Vizcaya. and one of her 12-inch
shells, smashi through the fire room
of the Spaniard, caused her to make
that quick turn to shore which at first
we did not understand. The New York
was so far to eastward that we had a
long chase and a stern chase before
she got into action, and she passed us
Just after the Vizcaya surrendered.
She made a splendid marine picture
aa she rushed eagerly in hot chase
after the Colon, and as she shot past
we gave Sampson cheer after cheer,
and cheer after cheer came back to us
from as gallant a crew as ever served
a gun or fed a roaring furnace.
Some of the crew had swum to the
beach, but finding the hostile shores

HUNTINGTON
HAS WON THE
BIG FIGHT
Secures Virtual Refunding
of Pacific Roads
Debts.
House Finally Passes the Amend
ment to the General
Deficiency Bill.
Call Office, Riggs House,
WASHINGTON, July 6.
C. P. Huntington, by perseverance
and hard work on the part of his in
struments In Washington, has finally
succeeded in staving off for another
period of years the Central Pacific's
debt to the Government. California's
representatives made a stubborn re
sistance, but it was Qseless, and Mor
gan's amendment to the deficiency hill
passed to-day by an overwhelming
vote.
Maguire, Hilborn, De Vrles, Barlow
and Castle vo-ted against the resolu
tion, Barham voted for it, while Loud
refrained from voting.
The amendment provides that the
Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of
the Interior and Attorney General, and
their successors in office, be appointed
a commission with full power to settle
the indebtedness up<,-n such terms and
in such manner as may be agreed upon
by a majority of them and the owners
of said railroad; provided, that any and
all settlements thus made shall be sub
mitted in writing to the President for
his approval or disapproval, v and un
less approved by him shall not be bind
ing.
The commission shall not agree to ac
cept a less sum in settlement of the
amount due the United States than the
full amount of the principal and inter
est unpaid and due at the time of said
settlement. The commission is empow
ered to grant such time or times of
payment by installment, and at such
rates of interest, to be not less than 3
per cent per annum, payable semi-an
nually, and with such security as tv
said commission may seem expedient.
Representative Maguire admits that
the action of the House to-day practi
cally amounts to a refunding proposi
tion, against which he has fought dur
ing his entire Congressional term, but
though defeated, he consoles himself
with the belief that the Califurnia peo
ple will not hold him responsible, but
will lay the blame at the door of the
Republican Congress.
There was a lively exchange of repar
tee between Maguire and Hepburn to
day, when the latter insinuated that
Maguire's opposition to the Pacinc
soldiers, they fought in a mad en
deavor to get on board the ship's boats
rather than surrender to an enemy
whom they knew to be pitiless. Every
oflicer and man on the lowa gave
clothes of some sort to the rescued sail
ors, and their reception must have
taught them that the despised Yankee
was not the inhuman brute their orii
cers had taught them to believe. The
paymasters' stores of the ships were
drawn upon lavishly to clothe the
Spanish officers and men, and when
alter a while they were dried and fed
it was interesting to note the relief
all seemed to feel, now that their long
suspense of BO many weeks was over.
At one time the lowa was engaged
with all the ships single handed. The
Spanish officers told us later that their
orders were to concentrate their lire on
her and every effort must be made to
disable her, as she was the most dan
gerous antagonist of all awaiting them.
But, as one of the Spanish officers
added, with a fine air of perplexity:
"We found that all the ships were
equally dangerous, and that after all
was said and done, it was four ships
against four, and one of these, the
Brooklyn, was much more lightly ar
mored and gunned than any of ours."
Reckoning up the data of this memor
able fight, which it was our good for
tune to take part in, we find that "in
less than twenty-five minutes two ,it"
their ships were wrecked; in less, than
three-quarters of an hour a third sur
rendered; in fifty-six minutes from the
time the first dashing Spaniard was
sighted all hands were piped down,
guns were secured and our boats were
In the water to save what was left c-f
the Vizcaya's crew.
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon of that
memorable Sunday the lowa arrived off
the entrance to Santiago, the Glou
cester keeping company with us after
speaking the Indiana and exchanging
cheers that made the welkin ring.
"When alongside the Indiana Captain
Kvans hailed his brother-in-law, Cap
tain Taylor of that ship, and told him
to send Admiral Cervera on board,
and he would put at his disposal the
vacant admiral's cabin of our ship. Th.3
gallant but defeated sailor came along
side in the Gloucester's boat and was
received with all honors due his rank
and station. A full marine guard was
paraded, bugles flourished a salute,
and when the official side was finished
the reception accorded him by the cap
tured officers of the Vizcaya showed
the affectionate regard with which the
fearless gentleman was held by those
who served under him. Captain Eu
late wore the sword Captain Evans had
refused to accept, and he pointed t<> it
with pathetic pride as he told of the
reception accorded him by the lowa's
captain. It was an affecting and heart
warming sight and made a fitting close
to a day that will be remembered for
the glories it yielded to our arms at
sea. ____________

WITH ADMIRAL, SAMPSON'S
FLEET, OFF SANTIAGO, Tuesday,
July 5, by the Call-Herald dispatch
boat Somers N. Smith, to Kingston,
Jamaica, "Wednesday, July 6. â In a
frantic effort to block the entrance to
Santiago harbor and save the city from
bombardment by the American fleet
the Spanish early yesterday morning
ran the Reina Mercedes ashore not far
from the wreck of the Merrimac.
This move was decided upon when It
became known that Admiral Cervera
would take his fleet from the harbor
and attempt to escape. There was a
feeling of temporary security in the
city as long as Cervera's fleet was there
to oppose the American fleet should
Admiral Sampson succeed in running
past the forts. "With the Spanish fleet
gone, however, the mines in the har
bor were practically the city's only de
fense against bombardment.
The Reina Mercedes, which had been
used as a hospital ship, was sent out
toward the mouth of the harbor and
there run ashore. Those in charge of
her did not succeed in their mission, for
the vessel does not block the entrance
of the harbor.
Admiral Sampson, when he learned
of the Spanish attempt to imitate Hob
eon's feat, decided to give his men some
target practice, with the Reina Mer
cedes as a target. He ordered the In
diana to throw a few shells into the
Spanish vessel. The Indiana started In
shore on this mission shortly before 12
o'clock last night. The battle-ship
crept slowly forward to escape detec
tion. When she had been maneuvered
to a commanding position she poured a
broadside from her batteries in the di
rection of the Reina Mercedes. It was
Impossible, owing to the darkness, vo
determine Just what was the effect of
the Indiana's fire on the Spanish vessel.
While making preparations for the
attack a shell burst below the Indiana's
forward deck, the explosion tearing a
hole through the deck. Fortunately
none of the Americans were killed.
Four hundred Spanish prisoners on
the Harvard mutinied and made a hos
tile demonstration against the Ameri
can sailors. The Harvard's captain, as
soon as he learned of the mutiny, re
solved to take firm steps. He ordered
his men to fire on the Spaniards, six
of whom were killed and twelve wound
ed. This had a quieter effect on
the prisoners and order was restored.
The American loss in destroying Cer
vera's fleet was but one killed and two
â wounded. All were on the Brooklyn.
The Spanish loss is estimated at 400
killed and 1600 taken prisoners. Five
hundred of the prisoners are wounded,
200 seriously and 300 slightly. Those
whose wounds are most serious have
been transferred to the Solace and Oli
vette. There are 700 of the prisoners
on the Harvard, 300 on the St. Louis,
504 on the Resolute, while other pris
oners are distributed among the other
vessels of the fleet. Admiral Cervera

tain ordered all his men below, had
the hatches closed, poured oil on the
decks, and applied the torch. He then
fired a pistol shot into his brain.
Captain Eulate suffered the heaviest
loss of any of the Spanish command
ers. More than half of the crew of the
Vizcaya were killed.
The naval battle lasted exactly fifty
six minutes, but during that time the
Spaniards were unable to inflict even
slight damage upon our fleet. Commo
dore Schley says the Brooklyn was hit
thirty-six times, but all the enemy's
shot fell harmlessly ipto the sea.
The men on Admiral Cervera's flag
ship were paralyzed with fear. After
they had run up the white flag and
while the Americans were approaching
the Colon to take them off the men
shouted "Viva los Americanos," at the
same time appealing for mercy. The
officers and crew, numoering 504 men,
were taken on board the Brooklyn, and
yesterday were transferred to the Reso
olute.
An attempt was made by the Oregon
to drag the Cristobal Colon off the reef
on which she struck. This only made
matters worse and the Spanish vessel
now is lying broadside on and fast go
ing to pieces.
Captain "Bob" Evans quickly
brought to terms some Cuban sharp
shooters, who, after the fleet had been
destroyed, were picking off helpless
Spanish sailors who drifted past on
bits of wreckage. These sharpshooters
also were firing at Spaniards strug
gling in toward shore. Captain Evans
landed some marines from the lowa to
protect the survivors, and sent word to
the Cubans that he would shell their
positions if they continued their guer
rilla tactics. This warning had the de
sired effect, and no further trouble of
that kind was experienced.
The work of rescuing the Spanish
survivors was directed by Lieutenant
Bell of the Harvard. The Chicago
naval reserves manned boats and
dragged the exhausted Spaniards from
the wreckage and the water. To get
the survivors back on board the ships
it was necessary to fill them with
brandy. Most of the Spanish seamen
were drunk during Sunday'? battie,
they having been \\*ell supplied with
liquor on the night before the fleet
made its dash for the sea. Constant
danger attended the rescuing of the
Spaniards, owing to frequent explo
sions on board Cervera's ships, all of
which were heavily stocked with am
munition. From Sunday noon until
yesterday morning the men in our fleet
were treated to a most remarkable ex
hibition of fireworks.
The Spanish survivors were practi
cally naked when rescued, but within
an hour clothing and shoes had been
provided for all. They had been made
quite comfortable by Sunday evening.
They will be sent north to-morrow on
the Harvard and St. Louis. Admiral
Cervera, I am informed, obtained his
first news of Dewey's victory after he
had been taken prisoner.
Captain Usher of the Ericsson made
a hard run to get a shot at the Vizcaya,
but the white flag was floating over
Captain Eulate's ship when the Erics
son came up.
"American shells had torn holes
through the Vizcaya's 12-inch plates,"
said Captain Usher afterward, "and
through them I could see naked men,
bloody and gashed, roasting in the
shelj. Her guns had been left shotted
and were going off by themselves from
the heat, but by care we were able to
get alongside. Her decks and sides
were red hot. Two men were climbing
down a davit tackle, and as the ship
rolled they would swing against her
scorching side, then swing back and
out again. I took 110 men oft the Viz
caya, all as bare as when they were
born. I know no worse sight than
naked men with bleeding wounds ex
posed. One swam toward me.
" 'Are you an officer?' I asked.
" 'No,' he answered, 'only a mournful
soldier.'
"From none of the wounded came a

From the third officer of the Infanta
Maria Teresa it is learned the Span
lards were overwhelmed by the inten
sity of the American fire.
"We could not breathe and were
blinded by fire. We knew from the
first we had no chance to escape."
Admiral Cervera's preparations for
dashing out of Santiago harbor had
been under way four days. Not only
did he have a large supply of ammuni
tion on board, but he had taken on pro
visions enough for a long voyage.
One of Cervera's officers. I am told,
declares that the attempt to escape
was done for its political effect in
Spain rather than the hope it would be
successful. Admiral Sampson has been
giving much thought to the possibility
of saving one or more of Cervera's
ships. The admiral to-day inspected
the wrecks and found the armor plates
of the vessels perforated with holes

Special cable to The Coll and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
IN THE TRENCHES, SAN
JUAN, Cuba, July 3, by The
Call-Herald dispatch-boat Som
ers N. Smith to Kingston, Ja
maica, July 6. â As far as the
Spaniards permitted the army
rested to-day. No advance was
made because no advance was
possible without artillery.
Little reply was made to the
constant infantry fire from San
tiago last night. The Spaniards
opened upon the entire line with
shrapnel and Mausers. Our
troops replied, and after an hour's
firing ceased. Only a few were
wounded. The chief effect was
to destroy the men's rest, which
they sorely needed.
The situation at present is this:
Santiago rises from the harbor to
the crest of a long hill. Three
quarters of a mile back from the
hill are the hills of San Juan, oc
cupied by our entire army. Our
troops took the hills before the
artillery had arrived. We cleared
them of the enemy's troops and
lost many men. Now that we
have them we cannot again ad
vance until the artillery has
opened the way.
Another such victory as that
of July i and our troops must
retreat. The situation is exceed-
ingly grave.
Judging from the quality and
quantity left behind them in the
trenches, the Spaniards are boun
tifully supplied with food. Their
fire is constant and heavy, show
ing no lack of ammunition. The
city . is protected by heavy
guns. We have only sixteen 3
inch guns, for the siege guns
have not even been taken from
the ships. It is as impossible to
take Santiago with the infantry
now overlooking its walls as to
open a safe with a pocket pistol.
I have been writing about this
campaign since it opened and cer
tainly I have not bee*n an alarmist.
Mistakes have been made, yet the
present does not seem to be the
time to comment upon them, and
thus cause needless anxiety.
The situation here now is crit
ical, alarming, and it would be
false to make it out otherwise.
The troops should never have
been sent here without the en
tire force of artillery at Tampa,
and until it arrives they can
neither advance nor retreat. They
can only lie on their faces or be
shot at if they rise. They have
been in most cruel heat and wet,
with frequent showers, for three
days. They are unable to move
about. They are under an un
ceasing fire. Even the strongest
and bravest cannot stand such a
strain long. Lack of speech, of
exercise, of food and of tobacco
and the incessant fire of bullets
and shrapnel will destroy any
constitution.
I went along the trenches this
morning and saw men lying in
the high grass, which was as wet
as a sponge. The dew had not
been out of the clothes they wore
since June 30. They had not
even had time to take them off
for a bath. Some of them had
been without food for forty-eight
hours. When the food did come
it was hardtack and coffee. Those
who smoke â and they are in the
majority â were suffering agonies
from lack of tobacco. Their
nerves were so unstrung in con
sequence that as a substitute they
were smoking grass, tea leaves
and herbs.
Overhead the fire was inces
sant. Ten men at a time manned
the rifle pits and were relieved
every hour. The rest of the com
pany or troop lay lower down the
crest, trying to sleep. Shrapnel
burst over them, killing and
wounding several. They were
under uninterrupted fire from
sharpshooters.
I do not see how men not made
of iron can stand such a state of
affairs much longer. It is not a
question of weeks, but of hours.
This may sound hysterical, yet it
is written with the most serious
and earnest intention. We are in
the face of possible disaster.
Nothing has been done by these
expeditions beyond proving the
heroic courage of the American
soldiers.
Truthfully, the expedition was
prepared in ignorance and con
ducted in a series of blunders. Its
commanding general has not yet
been even within two miles of the
scene of operations. That officer
rode to a hill two miles from San
Juan the day before the battle.
He was overcome by heat and has
been lying on his back the
greater part of the time ever
since.
General Wheeler, who refused
to remain in bed with his fever,
is here beside me, asleep on a
poncho with bullets passing over
him. â¦
There are Generals Sumner,
Kent, Lawton and Chaffee and
Colonel Wood. Never before
have so many commanding offi
cers lived so constantly on the fir
ing line; yet the man who is sup
posed to direct the entire expedi
tion is in a tent at the rear.
If he is ill, he should be re
lieved; if not, the present of
some man with absolute author
ity is necessary at the front I
am quoting what the brigade
commanders demand.
â¢ The commanding general's or
ders are disobeyed without a mo
ment's hesitation. I have heard
them countermanded in my pres
ence by colonels.
This is written with the sole
purpose that the entire press of
the country will force instant ac
tion at Washington to relieve the
strained situation. Here is what
is needed: First, artillery; but,
as that cannot arrive soon, the
navy must be urged until it acts.
General Pando with 6000 men is
at Santiago. Admiral Sampson
could do much by landing stores,
guns and quick-firing guns and
bluejackets and coming to the
rescue of the men along the hills.
He can bombard the city or lose
a few torpedo-boats and force his
way into the harbor.
He asked that the army should
come here. Well, it is here, hold
ing its own on the hills which it
captured with such loss.
The army needs artillery. It
needs some one in command who
is well, strong and able to stand
the hardships of a campaign. It
needs reinforcements and it needs
mules for transports. And it
needs all these things â now.

WARSHIPS DESTROY THE
CRUISER ALFONSO XII
NEW YORK, July 6.â A cablegram
to the Sun from Havana, via London,
says: The Spanish cruiser Alfonso
XII, which left this harbor to-day, pro
ceeded eight miles to the westward be
fore she was discovered by the Ameri
can blockading squadron. The latter
then gave chase to her. The cruiser
attempted to enter Marlel, but was
stranded at the entrance to the port.
The enemy fired 500 shots at her un
til they set her on fire. Detachments
of infantry and artillery hastened to
the shore and saved her crew and part
of her cargo. Two of the crew were
wounded. The cruiser is a total loss.

FIGHTING AT
SANTIAGO MAY
NOW BE OVER
Belief Expressed That Linares
Will Surrender Without a
Struggle,
Starving Spanish Soldiers and Officers
Enter Shatter's Lines for Food
and Shelter,
NEW YORK, July 6.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Santiago may surren
der to the American army without any
further engagement. A dispatch has
been received torn Major General
Shatter, in which it is stated that the
strongest pressure is being brought to
bear upon Linares to surrender to the
American forces without a battle. Gen
eral Shafter states in this dispatch
that up to the present time hundreds
of women and children have left San
tiago and came into his lines for pro
tection and food. A large number of
Spanish soldiers, including several offi
cers, one of whom is a colonel who par
ticipated in the engagement of July 2,
have deserted from the Spanish army
and entered the lines of Major General
Shafter. Women and children are be
ing fed and cared for by Miss Clara
Barton and her assistants.
According to the refugees who have
made their way to the lines of the
American army, conditions in Santiago
de Cuba are something terrible. Food
is extremely scarce, and there is a
great amount of suffering.
General Shafter states in hi 3 dispatch
that he has been informed that the en
tire business population of Santiago,
the foreign Consuls and Archbishop of
the city have all united in a strong ap
peal to General Linares to end the suf
fering and to surrender the city with
out further engagement. Officials on
duty at the War Department informed
me that in case General Linares re
fuses to surrender the city it is
thought that Major General Shafter
will not bombard the city for some
days, but will simply lake precautions
to "prevent supplies of any sort being
taken into the city. He will, it is
thought, succeed in his purpose of cap
turing the city without further blood
shed.

GENERAL SHAFTER'S HEAD
QUARTERS BEFORE SANTIAGO,
Tuesday, July 5, by Herald-Call dis
patch-boat Somers N. Smith to
Kingston, Jamaica, Wednesday, July
6. â General Shafter's men to-day are
having a second respite from the hard
fighting which began Friday morning
and continued until Sunday afternoon.
Flags of truce still fly over both
American and Spanish positions.
Few of the -merican officers knew
the reason when General Shafter or
dered them to do no more firing until
further n<?'ic:- It afterward transpired
that Colonel L^-.rst had plodded to San
tiago with a white flag carried by Ser
geant Lynch. General Shafter's emis
sary was not permitted to enter the
city, but was compelled to remain out
side while the communication he took
from the American commander was be
ing taken to the Spanish officials. After
a long wait a carriage approached the
point where Colonel Dorst was waiting
and a long conference with General
Linares' representatives inside foli
lowed. Colonel Dorst was informed
that the city would not surrender. The
Spaniards added that they would not
resume firing until the Americans had
withdrawn their flag of truce, but im
mediately thereafter they would begin
the battle where they had left off.
British Consul Ramsden, after the
conference, chatted with me about the
condition of the besieged city. I told
him that many men in the field were
anxious to enter Santiago, hoping to
get some good cool drinks. "We have
nothing of that kind left in the city,"
he replied with a smile. "There's plenty
of Spanish wine left, but that's about
all."
Mr. Ramsden said that flour was $36
a bag. chickens $2 each and other food
in proportion.
Assistant Naval Constructor Hobson,
I learned from Mr. Ramsden, has re
ceived the best of care from the outset.
When he was captured Admiral Cer
vera instructed the Spanish officers to
see that Hobson was made as comfort
able as possible. The officers have been
assiduous in their attentions and they
have become groat friends of Hobson.

EQUIPMENT
OF SOLDIERS
CONSIDERED
Deep Concern for Troops
Lying in Trenches and
Hospitals.
Sampson Loth to Risk His Ships
in Santiago Harbor Before
Forts Are Destroyed.
WASHINGTON, July 6.â By compari
son with what has gone before to-day
was very quiet at the War and Navy
departments. There were bulletins
posted in the former department, but
there were none of more recent date
than yesterday and, so far from indi
cating an impending battle, the general
tendency of these bulletins was to
| show that no forward movement is in
| absolutely immediate contemplation.
| Deep concern is felt here at the de
| privations and sufferings of our troops
1 lying in trenches and field hospitals
I surrounding Santiago, and there is
everywhere a disposition to insist that
herafter haste shall be made slowly
and that the equipment of our soldiers,
their commissary and quartermasters'
supplies, their ammunition and their
hospital stores shall be complete in
every respect before they advance
further. This is likely to be the rule,
even at the expense of time and in the
face of the criticism of an element that
has been vehemently insisting upon
rushing the campaign without regard
to cost in blood and money.
Confidence is felt that there will be
no friction between the army and navy
commanders and that the conference
between them will result in an agree
ment on a Joint plan for the prosecu
tion of the campaign. In the event
that this belief should not be well
founded the President is prepared to
act himself by orders from first hand.
There is much of force in the naval
argument that if Sampson is obliged
to enter Santiago harbor before the
forts are captured he will Jeopardize
the safety of the whole of the ironclad
fleet under his command, since by the
sinking of one of these ships in the
narrow channel, through a Spanish
mine or shell, the fleet would be left
helpless and exposed to destruction
under the guns of the forts, to which
they could make no reply, owing to the
elevation of the latter. On the other
hand the army officers seem to be justi
fied in avoiding the tremendous sacri
fice of life that would be involved in
again trying our soldiers upon the
Spanish defenses until they have been
materially reinforced in numbers and
strengthened by artillery.
Sampson did not report to-day to the
Navy Department, but the War De
partment sent over a very agreeable
message from Shatter announcing the
readiness of the Spaniards to exchange
Hobson and his men. It is believed
that this was accomplished some time
during the day, though notice of it has
not yet been received.
The fact that several of the vessels
selected for Watson's fleet were in the
thick of the engagement of July 3
promised to delay somewhat the de
parture of the Eastern squadron for the
shores of Spain. The vessels have con
sumed a good deal of coal and doubt
less have expended a large quantity
of their highest grade ammunition in
the furious attack on the steel war
ships of the Spaniards. It will be
necessary to replenish these stores be
fore the long ocean voyage is begun.
However, Secretary Long has given
rush orders for the preparation of this
squadron, and it certainly will be off
in the course of a few days.
The movements of the Cadiz fleet are
very puzzling to our experts here.
Weakened as it is by the sending back
of the torpedo-boat destroyers, the
Spanish squadron bound for the Phil
ippines seems destined to go to sure
destruction, as did Cervera's unlucky
ships when they headed westward
from the Cape Verde Islands. The
Spaniards are without doubt fully
aware of the inferiority of their fleet,
and why they persist in sending it to
be sunk in the Philippines is a mys
tery. The department was advised to
day that the squadron was passing
through the Suez canal, and as the ves
sels must have paid the heavy toll re
quired in advance, the indications are
now regarded as conclusive that the
ships are actually bound for the Phil
ippines. This belief stimulates the
preparations here for Watson's Bail
ing. He will strike straight after
Camara, who, In the end, is doomed to
be caught between Watson and Dewey.
Secretary Long regarded the report
that the Alfonso XIII had been de
stroyed while trying to run the Ha
vana blockade as the best news of the
day. It had not come to him in any
direct official way, but through a re
port from General Greely, chief signal
officer, who had received a cipher mes
sage, stating briefly that the Spanish
ship had been overhauled near Mariel
while trying to get through the block
ade, and was a total loss as a result
of the fire upon her. Both the Secre
tary and General Greely regarded the
report as authentic, but there was a
desire to get more details, as this has
been something of a spectral ship.
The Alfonso XIII was an iron gun
boat with one screw, one funnel and
military mast; square rigged, 2SO feet
long. 43 feet beam and 15 feet draught.
She had a displacement of 3090 tons.
She had a speed of seventeen knots
for short distances and an average
speed of fourteen knots; carried eight
een large guns, five machine guns and
five torpedo tubes. Her officers and
crew numbered 370.
Secretary Long is quite hopeful that
several of the Spanish ships of the
Cervera squadron can be saved, in
part at least, and possibly as a whole.
Assistant Secretary Allen shares in this
belief and thinks that the Cristobal Co
lon can be got off the rocks as an en
tirety, and that the hull, upperworks
and guns can be made available. She
was the best armored cruiser in the
Spanish navy, and if she can be floated
and repaired will make a valuable ac
quisition to the American navy. Allen
is hopeful also that the Vizcaya and
Oquendo can be saved in part. Infor
mation has reached the department'
that the hulls are not badly damaged.
The contract with the Merritt Wreck
ing Company is by the day, and may
be canceled at any time if the Govern
ment finds the salvage is not progress
ing satisfactorily. Two large wreck
ing vessels left Norfolk to-day to be
gin work upon the Colon, Vizcaya and
Oquendo.
Quartermaster General Ludington Is
; going to sell the first bale of cotton
i grown in the United States this year
| for the benefit of the United States
; hospital service, now so severely taxed
â by the war. A day or two ago Presi
dent McKlnley received from H. and B.
Beer of New Orleans the following let
ter:
"We express to-day to you the first
bale of cotton of the new crop, to be
disposed of in such a manner as you
see fit, for the benefit of the hospital
fund."
The President sent this note to the
War Department with instructions to
accept the cotton. The cotton will be
forwarded to New York, where It will
be auctioned off toward the end of the
week. The expectation is that the cot
ton will bring a fancy figure, in view
of the use to which the money is des
tined.
CREED TRIES
TO TAKE LIFE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAI'SALITO, July 6.â Ex-Marshal
John E. freed came again to the fore
as a prominent fighter In another fra
cas over the poolrooms, and as usual
his ever-ready revolver played a prom
inent role. In an altercation at about
2 o'clock this morning with M. A.
Hughes and "Teddy" Alexander Creed
fired a shot, but his arm was struck
up by a cane in the hands of Hughes
and what probably would have proved
a tragedy was thereby averted.
The accounts given by the various
persons interested conflict in many
points, but the general trend of the
story is about the same. The two men
were passing Broyer, Glynn & Hum
phreys' establishment, where Creed is
acting as night watchman. He says he
was awakened by their tearing down
the Fourth of July decorations over the
door, while both the others assert that,
they only tapped the wall lightly in
passing. Creed came out of the door
way with an oath, and Alexander
threatened to thrash him. The ex-
Marshal jumped inside the doorway
and thrust his revolver through the
aperture.
Hughes caught the gleam of the
weapon in time to strike Creed's arm,
and when the revolver exploded the
bullet passed harmlessly upward.
The disturbance awakened many
people in the vicinity, but the two men
passed on and few know the real
cause until to-day. When Trustee
Sylva heard of it this evening he said
Creed would be arrested to-morrow.
Hughes says Creed threatened to kill
him only a few days ago.
In consequence of this trouble the
poolroom disturbance has taken a new
lease of life and the Town Trustees are
making another effort to oust the rival
San Mateo faction. A communication
signed by Trustee A. Sylva, J. Thomas
and Li. J. Ambjornsen was at once
sent to General Dickinson, requesting
him in his capacity as president of the
board to inform the Western Union
Telegraph Company that the firm con
sisting of Glynn, Broyer, Humphreys
and probably others Is conducting a
poolroom business without a license
and in defiance of law and requesting
the company's aid in suppressing the
firm by refusing to give it telegraphic
communication. General Dickinson, it
is asserted on good authority, has
written to Superintendent Jaynes, men
tioning the communication received
from his fellow members of the board
and stating that the action of Glynn,
Broyer and Humphreys in disobeying
the mandate of the board has led to
trouble and turmoil. The superin
tendent is asked not to support these
men in the commission of a crime by
supplying telegraphic service.
From this it would appear that the
town is about to go through another
poolroom campaign.

PEOPLE ASKED TO
GIVE DUE THANKS
President McKinley's Proclama
tion Requests Devout Praise
for Victories.
WASHINGTON, July 6.â The President to-night issued the follow
ing statement:
"To the people of the United States: At this time, when yet is
fresh the remembrance of the unprecedented success which attended
the operations of the United States fleet in the bay of Manila on the
first day of May, last, are added the tidings of no less glorious achieve
ments of the naval and military arms of our beloved country at Santi
ago de Cuba, it is fitting that we should pause, and staying the feeling
of exultation that too naturally attends great deeds wrought by our
countrymen in our country's cause, should reverently bow before the
throne of Divine Grace and give devout praise to God, who holdeth na
tions in the hollow of his hands, and worketh upon them marvels of his
high will, and who has thus far vouchsafed to us the light of his face and
led our brave soldiers and seamen to victory. I therefore ask the peo
ple of the United States upon next assembling for divine worship in
their respective places of meeting to offer thanksgiving to Almighty
God, who, in his inscrutable ways, now leading our hosts upon waters
to unscathed triumph, now guiding them in a strange land through the
dread shadows of death to success, even though at a fearful cost, now
bearing them without accident or loss to far distant climes, has watched
over our cause and brought nearer success of right and attainment of just
and honorable peace. With the nation's thanks let there be mingled
the nation's prayers that our gallant sons may be shielded from harm
alike on the battle-field and in clash of fleets, and be spared the scourge
of suffering and disease while they are striving to uphold their country's
honor, and withal let the nation's heart be stilled with holy awe at the
thought of the noble men who have perished as heroes, and be filled with
compassionate sympathy for all those who suffer bereavement or endure
sickness, wounds and bonds by reason of the awful struggle, and above
all, let us pray with earnest fervor, that He, dispenser of all good, may
speedily remove from us the untold afflictions of war and bring to our
dear land the. blessings of restored peace and to all the domain now rav
aged by cruel strife the priceless boon of security and tranquillity.

THE GOD OF BATTLES.
CAPTAIN PHILIP of the Texas, after the San
tiago engagement, called his men to the
quarterdeck and there thanked God for an al
most bloodless victory. The air had just ceased to
vibrate to the thunder of guns, the pall of war hung
over the scene, when this brave commander sum
moned His crew. "I want to make public acknowl
edgment," he said to them, "that I believe in God
the Father Almighty. I want all of you, officers and
men, to lift your hats and from your hearts offer silent
thanks to the Almighty."
It would be a steely nature to which such a spec
tacle would not appeal, a strangely constituted human
being whom it would not thrill to his depths.
It is the history of war between peoples a degree
above savagery that the soldiers go forth confident
that they are right, and that above them there is the
shielding arm of the God of Battles. If it were not
so. they would not have the courage which impels
them willingly to rush to death.
The Napoleonic dictum that God is on the side of
the strongest battalions has been confirmed by mili
tary history, and was not idly spoken by the world's
greatest general. Yet when success crowns an army,
by land or sea, gives it victory and does not exact the
cost of valiant lives, the instinctive faith crystallizes
into a fervent belief. Captain Philip did himself honor
when he declared his principles, and people of every
shade of opinion will respect the manly and outspoken
declaration.
RIDING TWO HORSES.
BY a delegation favorable to fusion with Dem
ocracy on terms of political bargain and sale,
but weighted down with resolutions declaring
against fusion, the Populists of San Francisco will
be both represented and misrepresented at the coming
State convention of their party. We will, therefore,'
have a chance to see in that assembly of patriots a
dean, straight contest between principles and men,
between resolutions that speak clearly and men who
are not speaking except on the side.
A county committee, not a numerous body, that
chanpes itself in the twinkling of an eye into a county
convention and then proceeds to unanimously adopt
resolutions declaring against a particular line of ac
tion, after which it elects delegates known to be in
favor of that action, is certainly not very well fitted to
conduct the affairs of even such a party as that of
the San Francisco Populists. Men who undertake
to carry out a cut and dried programme should at
least see to it that the thing that is cut is the thing
that is dried, and not cut one thing and dry another.
Where is the profit to party leaders in laboriously con
structing a platform to stand upon when the time
comes and then intrusting it to men who will use its
timbers to practice on in sawing wood for themselves
or else swap it off for any old thing?
If the Populists of this city are in favor of the reso
lutions against fusion, they have been bunkoed on the
delegation to the State convention. If they are repre
sented by the delegates, then they have been bunkoed
by the resolutions. The local party is placed in a
position where it will have to ride two horses going
in different directions, and as a result as soon as the
circus starts up at the State convention the first act
of the show will be an exhibition of San Francisco
Populism in a grand tumbling act with its back in
the sawdust and its feet in the air.
In one respect, however, the fusiotJ-confusion out
come of the combined county committee-county con
vention meeting will not be wholly adverse to the
Populism of the city. The delegation and the reso
lutions, if not in harmony with one another, will
be well fitted to blend with the patchwork varieties of
delegates and declarations sent from other parts of
the State. It will be nothing out of place for city
Populists to shout for the middle of the road and then
take to the first bypath that affords an entrance to
the woods. They will not be lonely when they shout
nor when they turn aside. They will find the road
full of such shouters and the woods full of such
dodgers.
Americans who do not find Paris a pleasant place of
residence now are respectfully reminded that in va
rious parts of America houses may be secured at rea
sonable rates.
Hearst extols the conduct of a subordinate In cut
ting off the heads of forty prisoners, and yet when he
takes a regiment or two himself delivers them with
heads still on to Sampson and the other amateurs.
Perhaps this is humane, but it is not consistent
News comes that the machinery of the Pelayo is
out of order, but its condition is far better than will
be the case a little later. Compared with the machin
ery of the Vizcaya, for instance, it seems to be in
fair shape.
Linares and Pando have both been wounded.
Honor, however, is not satisfied. Spanish honor is
hard to satisfy anyhow, the initial difficulty being to
find it.
Perhaps Blanco imagines that hit determination
that Havana shall not be taken while he lives will
have a tendency to delay the taking.
THE SITUATION AT SANTIAGO.
TO the American people, flushed with joy over
the destruction of the Spanish fleet at Santiago
and sanguine of the speedy capture of that city
by the gallant army now surrounding it, the letter
from our special correspondent, Richard Harding
Davis, which we publish this morning, wjll come like
a blow as astounding as a clap of thunder from a
clear sky.
The blow, however, comes not from a foe, nor from
a captious critic, but from a friend in the warmth of
an earnest patriotism. It is designed to arouse the
American people from a dangerous feeling of over
confidence, and to stimulate the war authorities to
prompt action to relieve the troops at Santiago from
the conditions that now paralyze their energies and
baffle their courage.
The account given of the situation at the front by
Mr. Davis is not one of vague and general criticism
and fault-finding. It is not the report of a sensa
tional alarmist, nor of a fatuous critic of the ad
ministration trying to make political capital for the
opposition in the coming campaign. It is one of
direct statements and specific charges. The ring of
truth is in the tone of every sentence, and every word
has evidently been carefully chosen to express the
real condition of the situation. It is a letter to be
studied and then acted upon without delay.
Our troops now confronting a well armed, well
fed and desperately vindictive foe, intrenched in
strong works, are without heavy artillery, without
proper food, without tobacco, almost as essential as
food itself; without time, place or opportunity for
rest from the alarm of incessant attack from sharp
shooters, without vigorous support from the fleet at
the mouth of the harbor and, worst of all, perhaps,
without right leadership on the part of the command
ing general.
These statements are of a nature to rouse the in
dignation of the people. It was designed that they
should do so. Better that the truth should be known
now, however bitter it may be, than that the blunder
ing should go on at Santiago until some dire catas
trophe befalls the army and inflicts upon the nation
the humiliation of a defeat which neither patriotism,
valor nor self-sacrifice on the part of the brave men
at the front could avert.
Mr. Davis says: "The army needs artillery. It
needs some one in command who is well, strong and
able to stand the hardships of the campaign. It needs
reinforcements. It needs mules for transports. It
needs all these things now." Moreover, Mr. Davis
says: "This is written for the sole purpose that the
entire press of the country will unite to force instant
action at Washington to relieve the strained situa
tion."
Now Is the time for the people to speak and for
the President to act. Delay Is now out of the ques
tion. "On to Santiago" is imperatively the war cry
of the situation.
Wr-jEN THIEVES FALL OUT
** \ J HEN thieves fall out," says the proverb,
\A/ "honest men get their due." The saying
* may not be literally applicable to the dis
closures made by members of the Board of Education
since the breaking out of the recent dissensions
among them, but it is sufficiently apropos to be
quoted as a text for comment on the proceedings of
the board at its meeting on Tuesday evening.
More than one investigation lately made into the
manner in which the school fund has been expended
has furnished the public with pretty conclusive proof
that something like gross frauds have been practiced
by at least some of the members of the board. The
lumber deal scandals exploited by the last Grand
Jury are fresh in the public mind. Enough was made
known at that time to justify the popular demand for
the indictment of several persons implicated in the
scandals, and there was no little regret that indict
ments and prosecution did not follow.
Now comes the antagonism among the members of
the board itself producing charges and counter
charges that add new evidence of wrongdoing. At
the meeting on Tuesday evening Director Gallagher
submitted a written report on the work of the building
committee, which set forth sufficient facts to justify
him in asserting: "I have shown enough to call at
tention to the rank extravagance that prevails and to
the further fact that the chairman of the building
committee is proceeding in an entirely illegal manner
and that he has grossly mismanaged the affairs of his
committee."
Among the facts stated by Director Gallagher are
these: That much of the work now being done under
the direction of the chairman of the building commit
tee is being performed by "persons who have no con
nection with the department. They have not been
authorized by the board or any committee of the
board to do the work." That for a large part of the
work now under way no contracts have been let, or
at least none could be found on file when the inves
tigation was made. Finally, that two members of
the building committee, Mr. Drucker and Mr. Carew,
gave assurance to the investigator that with respect
to some important work which he specifies in his
report they have not at any time been consulted by
the chairman of the committee and have never given
their consent to the work-
After this report there came a discussion upon a
report of Chairman Burns of the building commit
tee, and further evidence of wrongdoing was given.
Director Drucker, one of the building committee, is
quoted as saying: "These things have never come
before the board and I will not stand responsible for
any such actions. I therefore now tender my resig
nation from that committee. Why, look at it! There
are acts of the chairman of the building committee
in which he has contracted for over $150,000 worth of
work, and in no instance has he either called a com
mittee meeting or consulted me regarding the busi
ness passing through the hands of that committee.
This won't do."
It may be gratifying to a slight degree to have Mr.
Drucker refuse to act any longer on the committee
with Burns and to say "This won't do," but such con
demnation is not sufficient. The things have been
done. It now remains to be seen what the Board of
Education, the Grand Jury and others having author
ity and responsibility in the enforcement of law will
do about it. The evidence of fraud seems to be abun
dant and easily obtainable. The prosecution should
begin at once.
CUBANS AS ALLIES.
TO pass judgment upon the value of the Cubans
as allies, and expect it to be final, would at this
time be an injustice. It can be said, however,
that according to what tttey have been able thus far
to do, they seem to be a disappointment. Their
principal part in the conflict will doubtless be in shar
ing the benefits.
But whatever the soldierly quality of the Cuban,
there have been a number of incidents showing that
personally he possesses unlovable traits. While con
demning these, it is but fair to remember that he has
suffered much, that hardships have worn him, oppres
sion embittered him, and in the matter of cruelty he
has been set an example by the Spanish. Yet how
ever plausible his excuses, it may be accepted that
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 7, 1898.
Americans will never take kindly to a people who
would massacre prisoners or subject the bodies of the
dead to indignity.
Reports show that marines had to be sent ashore
where the fleet of Cervera had been beached and
throw about the Spanish huddled on the sands an
armed guard. Otherwise the Cubans would have
butchered men who, according to all laws of warfare,
were safe by the protection of the white flags that
fluttered from the mastheads when the ships went
down. The men had been cast helpless and weapon
less through the surf, and the Cubans would have
turned the spot into a shambles.
In one case the body of a Spanish officer floating
m the wreckage was wantonly used as a target, and
the riflemen only desisted from the revolting act when
an American officer threatened to turn his guns upon
them. It does not appear that the United States fur
nished the Cubans with ammunition so as to enable
them to commit outrages, or that it is taking prison
ers so the islanders may enjoy a season of slaughter.
Either the Cubans will adopt different tactics or they
will find that the force now co-operating with them
will be used to subdue them into at least an imitation
of being civilized.
In the Cuban army is a creature named Honore
Lame. If he is a fair sample the army is an aggre
gation of bloody outcasts entitled to no measure of
sympathy, and the importance of crushing it is as
much manifest as the necessity for driving out the
Spanish. Lame boasts of having cut off the heads of
captured Spanish, of having looted the pockets of
corpses, and a correspondent named Hearst glorifies
the unspeakable deeds. Lame is also a yellow corre
spondent, naturally a braggart and liar, but if crimes
for which he should be hanged are to be heralded as
heroic, no wonder the rank and file learn to revel in
cruelty.
THE WRECK OF THE BOURGOGNE.
ANOTHER direful catastrophe at sea has added
to the dread fame of Sable Island and given
another warning against the excessive com
petition in speed which induces Atlantic liners to fol
low the perilous northern route because its compara
tive shortness permits a quicker voyage to be made
across the ocean. In this disaster upward of 600 peo
ple are reported to have perished, and among the
number lost is every woman, with one exception, that
was on board the ill-fated ship.
Since the captain of the Bourgogne and his officers
have gone down to death with their ship and their
passengers, there will be a general disinclination to
hold them guilty of blame in the accident. Neverthe
less, certain features of the disaster show that some
thing was radically wrong in the management of the
ship. Even respect for the maxim, "Speak nothing
except good of the dead," will hardly withhold men's
tongues from commenting with earnest severity upon
a wreck caused by a steamer rushing at full speed
through a fog â a wreck in which with fifteen minutes
of time to get the lifeboats ready, comparatively few of
the passengers were saved and all the women aban
doned.
It has been the custom of Atlantic liners to follow
the northern short route across the ocean in winter
and early spring, because at those seasons there are
comparatively few fogs and icebergs in the northern
waters. As summer advances, however, the floating ice
and the mists drift down from the Arctic, and then
the sea around Sable Island is one of the most dan
gerous parts of the ocean. The time had about come
for taking the southern route, but the captain of the
Rourgogne tried once more the short route. He
made his course also at full speed, and the result was
that when a sailing vessel loomed up before him in
the fog it was impossible for him to turn aside in
time.
The deeper horror of the catastrophe, however, was
that which followed the collision. There seems to
have been hardly a pretense of discipline on board the
ship. Since the captain and his officers remained
with the wreck and perished with it, there is a pre
sumption that they did their duty as best they could,
but were unable to check the rush of men for the
boats and the crowding aside of the women. That
they were unable to maintain order is, however, a
proof that the discipline on board had long been lax
in the extreme. The system, therefore, is as much to
be condemned as the captain.
As a rule all great catastrophes are illumined by
incidents of heroism that serve to lighten the horror
by proving the nobility of which human nature is
capable. In this case, however, there seems nothing
to relieve the dreadful aspects of the disaster. It is
all gloom, all weakness, cowardice, or worse.
(I SAN DIEGO MOVEMENT.
CERTAIN enterprising, public spirited men of
San Diego, feeling the importance of hastening
the beginning of work upon the Nicaragua
canal, have initiated a movement to that end which, if
well supported, as it deserves, will undoubtedly do
much to induce Congress to take prompt action on
the subject. They have organized an American
Nicaragua Canal Association and intend to estab
lish branches throughout the Union. Their object
is to get citizens in every section of the country to
bring whatever influence they may have to bear upon
Congressmen so as to arouse them to an understand
ing of the strength of the popular demand for the
canal.
The method proposed h simple in its nature, but
can be made very effective if taken up by the right
men in different sections and States. That the great
majority of Americans are in favor of the construction
of the canal is unquestionable. So long, however, as
the favorable sentiment is quiet and undemonstrative
it will have little weight with the law-makers of the
national capital. Most of them, in fact, will hardly
know or understand the full extent and strength of
it. A movement, therefore, which will lead to a clear
and forcible declaration of t the popular will on the
subject will be useful in encouraging the advocates
of the canal at Washington in overcoming the indif
ference of many who have given but little considera
tion to the subject, and in silencing the objections of
others who have been antagonistic.
It is to be hoped the San Diego plan will be well
received everywhere, and that the association will
soon be national in its scope. A few petitions from
scattered localities will have but little effect, while a
host of them coming from every State and from al
most every citizen of weight and influence will have
much. The issue has been well expressed in the cir
cular of the association: "Congress may act any way,
but there is no certainty about it. If, however, the
people unitedly demand this undertaking they will
get it, and that speedily."
It would seem by the trifling effect of the shots that
hit our boats at Santiago as if undue importance has
been attached to the circumstance that as a rule Span
ish gunners can't hit anything.
This time when Captain Eulate visits New York he
will not be under official obligation to visit the Mayor
and acquire another of those Van Wyck snubs.
Spanish prisoners on the Harvard were foolish to

"POLLIES" OUT FOR JOBS.
Some Men Who Would Like to Serve the State in Any
Old Office With a Good Salary Attached.
The political career of Whispering Gavin McNab, boss tailor of Tooley street,
ex-Buckley lambkin, and foe to organized labor, calls to mind the story of a
phantom dog. This ghostly creature used to appear on the highway of Ireland
and his ghostly shape would follow every passerby part of the journey. Phantom
McNab first trailed after the late William Higgins, then nosed his uncanny per-
son along the footprints of Farmer Buck
ley. The farmer chased him off, and then
McNab ambled in the wake of Sullivan
and Dwyer. But they "hefted" him
found him wanting, and dropped him.
But to lay a ghost is next to impossible,
With the persistency of the shadowy
canine, he spied John Daggett of Slskl
you, and Immediately Daggett was haunt
ed. Next he attached himself to Colonei
W. P. Sullivan, the Mayor's official man
of all work. This gentleman Is some
times known as "Shoot Low" Sullivan,
from the circumstance that he counseled
this method of aiming while working
men battling for their rights were the tar
gets. Now McNab is on the road again
attending Hallucination Alford of Tulare
and Frank Hood Gould, the Sherwood
Forest Democrat. He will remain wltn
them until there shall arise an oppor
tunity profitably to shift.
Speaking of McNab haturally suggests
others. There Is the lily of Kearney's
sand lot garden, John Placehunter Dunn.
He is chairman of Whispering Gavln>
puppet show of 100 figures, each war
ranted to dance at the pulling of the
string, like a thing of life. He was nat
uralized August 12, 1879. On November
1 of the same year he was acting as
Auditor of this city. Ever since he haa
either held a position or been in eagei
quest of one.
A patriarch among office holders, yet
one who can say with Othello: "I have
done the State some service," is Jamea
Denman. He may properly be referred
to now as James Jubilee Denman, as he
is about to celebrate the fiftieth anniver
sary of his introduction to the good things
of official life. He is unflagging In his
zeal, ready to accept any ofter coming
his way. It is understood that he could
be Induced to be a Congressman, a Rali
road Commissioner, Election Commission
er, and if the chance is not at hand, to
think a job as juryman better than noth
ing. Denman is rich, and like McXab
and Maximilian Parkhurst Popper, pro
fessional purifier, believes the laborer ig worthy of as pitiable hire as he can be
forced to take. He is a gentleman of respectability and dignity. The Tailors of
gentlemen mentioned did, mostly in the neck, and Is reaching out for it with an
agile arm and a long pole. ___________ ________ ___â
Richard Phenomenon Doolan.the "Pride
of the Mission," was the most aston
ished Individual in the city when he
awoke one Saturday morning, and found
that by some occult process he, one of
Buckley's most devoted, had suddenly be
come a reformer. But realizing that he
was a reformer he began to pull for a fat
ter snap than he hart. At the time oi
his political regeneration he was peace
fully occupying a stall in the Custom
House where the Federal crib is big with
fodder. He began to lay wires to be
come Assessor, which is not a bad job*
Unluckily for him the position had been
promised to Edward Longreacher Fitz
gerald, a person from Oakland. He has
the further distinction of being brother tc
a member of the famous Committee oi
Nine, seven of whose number lived in
the country, yet who kindly consented tc
appoint a county committee for this citj
and make laws for the same.
It is said that Boss Tailor McNab prom
ised Committeeman Fitzgerald that thÂ«
other Fitz should have the nominatior
for Assessor of San Francisco., even were
he a resident of San Diego Instead oi
Oakland. Also with that characteristic
family thrift the committeeman consent
ed to become a party to the scheme, and
vote acording to tht whispered instruc
tions of McNab. The brothers are bott
cared for now at the expense of the tax
payers, but they consult the oracle anx
iously to see if the future does not hold
a better reward for their patriotism.
In the meantime the "Pride of the Mis
sion" is wroth and goes so far in his
thirst for vengeance as to threaten tc
accept the nomination for County Clerk,
soothe his savage breast.

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, July 6.â Ex-Attorney
General W. H. H. Hart is at Willards.
J. F. Evans leaves for San Francisco to
morrow, thence for Manila, where, as
commissary of subsistence, with the rank
of captain on the staff of General Mer
Tooley street consider his presence on
their gang something in the nature of a
triumph. He will assist In the presenta
tion to Maguire of a gold brick.
Another natural leader of men, who,
for the nonce, is consenting to be led, is
Eugene Napoleon Deuprey. He is a legal
Samson untouched of Delilah's shears.
His name is a household word in some
households. He has a political history.
In IS9O he withdrew with a little band
of adherents whom Farmer Buckley had
overlooked in the distribution of pie into
the cave of Adullam known as Irving
Hall. There they formed a party of their
own with pie as the platform. Deuprey
invited Whispering Gavin to join, but
just then Gavin was trotting, ghost dog
like, at the heels of the Llvermore agri
culturist, and refused to break away. On
the contrary he replied that Buckley was
a good enough reformer for him, that
the malcontents had tried to reform the
Democratic party and had done so to the
extent of getting out of it.
Now Napoleon has consented to become
a candidate for District Attorney, an of
fice in which he thinks he would shin*.
When the other Napoleonâ the original
first stood face to face with Goethe, hÂ«
exclaimed "Voila un homme," which, be
ing translated, means "There is a man."
But could he have been at the Democratic
convention in Union Hall in 18&4 when
our own Napoleon was giving away nomi
nations without consulting the assemblage,
he would have looked with bulging eyes
and exclaimed: "There are at least two
men." On that memorable occasion Deu
prey handed to one favored friend the
nomination as County Clerk, and others
were put on the ticket to run for jobs
at Supervising. Nobody wanted them
there but Deuprey, but they went there
just the same, and Deuprey overruled the
howls of protest. Robin Hood, Claude
Duval, Dick Turpin and Captain Kidd
have gone to their several rewards. Deu
prey is still in the flesh, illuminating thÂ«
pages of Democracy's history. He wants
his reward without getting it as the other
ritt, he will establish and conduct a sys
tem of tariff and internal taxation to be
known as "military contributions."

SOLDIERS IN WASHINGTON.
The stairway leading up to the top or
the Washington monument has been im
passable with soldiers for a couple or
weeks past. Not one in ten of the soldiers
will ride up in the elevator, and the so:
dier who does take the elevator is called
a "slob" by his comrades. The men who
have had their hats thrown out of tho
windows of the monument by skylarking
comrades haven't appeared to enjoy thia
game very much, especially the searching
for their chapeaux after the descent.
It is not a characteristic of men who
comprise an urban population to run to
fires. The soldiers who are now flocking
through the streets of Washington don'i
pretend to metropolitan ways. This ex
plains why so many of them, when they
see a fire engine racing along the street,
take to their heels and follow it. There
has not been a miniature blaze in "Wash
lngton for several weeks Dast that has nor
been witnessed by a knot of panting sol
diers.
Thousands of the soldiers have rested
their weary limbs in the scats of the gal
leries of the two houses of Congress sinew
the camp was established acijos the way.
The men occupy themselves chiefly In
picking out the Representatives from their
own States, and when they have focusea
them in their vision they do not take their
eyes off them while they remain. It is
not to be supposed that the Representa
tive on the Moor do not know that thw
soldiers from their districts are watching
them studiously either. The Representa
tives know that soldiers write letters
home, especially when they haven't much,
else to do, and a good many of them have
done a bit of attitudinizing" for the benefit

TUT": forces that are to constitute
the fourth Manila expedition are
six troops of the Fourth United
States Cavalry and the Independ-
ont Nevada Cavalry troop, now at
the PresHio, all under the command of
Major Sanford C. Kellogg, Batteries A
and D of the Sixth Artillery, command
ed by Major Grugan; five companies of
the Fourteenth United States Infantry
under Major Robe: sixty men of the
Third Artillery under Lieutenant Aber
nethy, and recruits for the Hospital
Corps, Signal Corps and the Eighteenth
and Twenty-third Infantry Regiments.
These troops will .'ill sail on or before
next Tuesday, ond the steamers City of
Puebla and Peru. This confirms the
announcement made in yesterday's
Call.
This expedition will be in command
of Major Sanford C Kellogg of the
Fourth United States Cavalry.
Major Kellogg has a brilliant record.
Ho is a native of New York State, and
is 56 years of age. His first military
was pained as a member of
thirty-seventh New York State
i Regiment, from May 29 to Sep
tember 2, lsO2, and from that time he
actively served throughout the War of
the Rebellion, being promoted from
time to time for gallant and meritori
ous services on the field of battle. He
was on the staff of Major General
:e H. Thomas, and was in all the
battles in which that famous comman
der was engaged, among which were
Hoover's Gap, Chattanooga, Chicka
mauga. Missionary Ridge, Lookout
Mountain, Buzzards Roost, Resaca,
Adairsville. ("assville, New Hope
Church, Kenesaw Mountain, Peach
Tree Creek, the fights around Atlanta,
ending with the battle of Jonesboro
and the occupation of Atlanta; the bat
tle of Nashville, and the pursuit of
General Hood's army into Alabama.
H^ was several times brevetted for his
valuable and heroic services, his high
est brevet rank being that of colonel.
At the end of the war Kellogg was
appointed second lieutenant in the
Eighteenth United States Regular In
fantry, and a few months later was
promoted to a first lieutenancy. In
mber, I^TO, he was assigned to the
Fifth Cavalry, and in ISTI was made a
captain, and is now a major of the
Fourth Cavalry. In ISBI he was or
dered to report for duty on the staff of
Lieutenant General Sheridan, where he
remained until February, 1873. Dur
ing this period he was stationed at
igo, but participated In a recon
naissance of the Yellowstone River to
the mouth of Powder River, and was
engaged in several skirmishes with
Sioux Indians during the movement.
The companies of the Fourteenth In
fantry will sail on the City of Puebla,
and the Fourth Cavalry troops and the
Nevada Cavalry will go on the Peru.
No horses will be taken for the cavalry
on this expedition. The plan of ship
ping horses and mules on the sailing
vessel Tacoma is yet in abeyance, sub
ject to further consideration. Lieu
tenant Neal, Fourth United States
< Hvalry, yesterday Inspected the Ta
coma with a view of ascertaining the
I ability of transporting horses on
a sailing vessel. He will report his
conclusions to Major General Otis, and
his report, no doubt, will determine the
matter.

BUDD NAMES
THE OFFICERS
The Governor Appoints
the Line Officers of the
Eighth California.
Yesterday, by direction of Governor
Budd, Adjutant General Barrett named
the line officers of the Eighth California
United States Volunteer Infantry. The
Governor, Adjutant General and Colonel
H.nshaw gave careful consideration to
the selection of these officers. Few
changes were made from the original list
ur.a therefore the roster stands very
â¢ as it did when the companies went
Into camp under Colonel Henshaw.
The Governor is very earnest in his de
termination that capable officers shall go
to tho front with the Eighth Regiment.
Where changes were made good and suffi
cient military reasons were set forth for
change. The idea that the volun

said ,".s a tact, however that the Governor
will not tolerate ar.y insubordination or

tinous talk the offending organization will

ready to send in a company of stalwart
volunteers. Eureka is tendering a com
pany and many other towns are making
application for the acceptance of troops.
The effort of the Examiner to provoke
the volunteers to mutiny has not escaped
the observation of the military authori
ties. Nothing would give the Exu minor
more pleasure than a revolt among the
soldiers from this State, hence an awk
ward effort is made by that journal to
stir up strife and bad feeling in the regi
ment at Camp Barrett. The paper is hav
ing quite a war carnival of its own. The
staff correspondents, according to the let
ters of Willie Hearst, the boss of the
sheet, are on the battlefield of Santiago
picking the pockets of the dead and cut
ting off the heads of Spanish prisoners.
It is not surprising therefore that the
non-combatllnts of the staff should be
over in Fruitvale â working up a "special
EJxaminer mutiny among- the California
volunteers.

sued from State Headquarters yesterday.

AMAZED BY
YELLOW LIES
The Eighth Regiment in
Contact With Saffron
Journalism.
CAMP BARRETT, FRUITVALE, July
6.â As is generally known, the members of
the Eighth Infantry, California Volun
teers, come from many sections of the
State, the majority at a distance from
San Francisco. In their far off northern
homes they learned little of the ways of
yellow journalism, just enough, in fact,
to avoid it and to let it severely alone.
But since their arrival in Camp Barrett
they have been brought into contact with
it to a greater or less extent, and the ex
perience has cost them no end of worry and
aroused an unlimited amount of disgust.
For officers and men now realize that the
Examiner, with characteristic mendacity,
has been endeavoring to stir up mutiny
In camp and wreck, in part at least, the
pride of the California volunteer organiza
tion.
When the yellow yeller reached camp
this mnrning it was found to contain a
lurid tale of a general sweep of line offi
cers. No less than six captains, in camp
with their companies, were to be deposed,
while ten lieutenants were to be sent back
home without cause. The faker was mod
est; it only "turned down" half the offi
cers in the regiment and did not attempt
to give the names of the victims, whereas
if it had not been for a recent editorial
cyclone engulfing several of the most pic
! turesque prevaricators known to yellowr
| dom every officer in the regiment would
i probably have been slated and the name
1 of his successor given.
It was evident at a glance that the
â  writer was not u~ to the Examiner limit,
! but he did the best he could. For instance,
! he went on to tell how hair the companies
' were in a state bordering on mutiny and
! had the men declaring that if their offi
cers were not accepted they would refuse
t to be mustered into the service.
â  The whole article was cunningly writ
i ten with a view of inciting the men to
just the course the article outlined. The
object of this was most worthy of the
i source from which It emanated. It was
i nothing less than to wreck what prom
i ises to be one of the very best regiments
that ever responded to Uncle Sam's call
' to arms; to disrupt the National Guard,
i and to bring disgrace upon some of the
bravest sons of the State by dragging
them into a foolish revolt. And all to
satisfy the craving of the yellowest ot
! yellow sheets for sensationalism. But the
I wholesale decapitations have not been
' made. As will be seen by the accom
: panying roster two captains and a few
lieutenants have been dropped, but no
where near as many as the Examiner pre
dicted and there will be no revolt. The
i men of the Eighth Regiment are too
patriotic to let such a matter as the sub
stitution of one officer for another drive
them out of the service of their country.
They know, too, that such a step would_
only bring disgrace upon themselves and'
their birthplace, for were they to refusÂ»
to join the regiment there are scores of
towns ready and anxious to send men to
take their places without question and
without a thought as to who would
command them. The men in Camp Bar
rett would like to serve under the men
who commanded them in the National
Guard, but they will follow whoever may
be selected to lead them.
Captain Murray commenced the work
of mustering in the men by companies
this afternoon and by night four full
commands, embracing some of the best
blood in the State, had taken the oath
to bear true faith to the United States.
The first to enter the service was Com
pany D of San Rafael, making Captain
Elliott the senior line officer. Lieutenant
Meggett was not mustered in, but will
await his turn, according to seniority.
Company D presented 105 men to the mus
tering officer, and after they had been ad
vised -of the nature of the obligations
they were about to assume and warned
that If they wanted to back down then
was the time to do so (a warning none
heeded), the oath was administered. A
great cheer from their comrades greeted
them at the conclusion of the ceremony
and the men were marched to headquar
ters, where they signed the muster roll in
triplicate.
Company X of Colusa was the second
company to take the oath, Captain Ford
lining up 106 men before the mustering
officer. His lieutenants, Rutledge and
Denison, will take the oath in their
proper turn. The ceremony was identical
in each case, and after the last man had
subscribed his name Captain Partridge
lined up 105 of San Jose's sons for the de
fense of their country.
I Company E- of Santa Rosa, 106 strong,
followed San Jose, Lieutenants Holmes
and Bean taking the oath with Captain
Havens and the enlisted men, they being
the ranking officers of their respective
grades in the regiment. ,
To-morrow morning Captain' Murray will
continue the work, and he expects to
have the last man In the regiment sworn
in by night.
The examining surgeons finished their
work to-day, passing upon forty-three
men, of whom three were rejected. These
were extra men to fill vacancies In those
companies that were reduced below the
maximum. The surgeons have passed a
total of 1378 officers and men.six more than
the maximum of 106 to the company, but
the non-commissioned staff is yet to be
appointed, which will take most of the
surplus. It Is a singular fact that some
of the healthiest appearing men who
came into camp have been rejected on
account of heart trouble. The majority
of these came from the country districts,
and the surgeons attribute the prevalence
of valvular affection of the heart among
them to the continuous and heavy work
on farms. These men have never known
a day's illness, and were greatly sur
prised when told that their hearts were
affected.
Private Riley of Company D, who was
bitten in the hand by a spider two nights
ago while asleep, is somewhat Improved
to-day, although his arm is still swollen
to alarming proportions and he is con
fined to a cot in the hospital. About
midnight last night his condition became
so alarming that the surgeons were sum
moned and a priest Bent for. Riley be
gan frothing at the mouth and raved like
a maniac. He was finally quieted and
since then has shown a Blight but steady
improvement.
Mrs. B. D. Murphy of San Jose was
among the visitors to camp to-day. She
has two nephews in Company B, whom
she is very proud of, and wanted to see
them after they had become full-fledged
soldiers.
Colonel Carrington has arranged to have
band instruments sent over in the morn
ing and the regimental band will begin
practice to-morrow under Principal Musi
clan Gomez of Oakland. The several
towns from which the companies were
drawn have guaranteed. funds to pay for
the instruments. There are a number of
excellent musicians in the regiment, and
it will not be long before the Eighth can
boast of one of the best bands in the
volunteer service.
When the citizens of Oakland present
the regiment with a stand of colors,
which they have promised to do, it will
be well equipped.

THE GHOST TO WALK.
The Paymaster Will Visit the
Volunteers at Fort Point
To- Day.
What has interested the Boldlers of the
Sixth California more than anything else
since they have been in San Francisco,
outside of what disposition will be made
of them regarding their being sent to the
front or remaining here, is the exceeding
probability of a visit of the paymaster
to-day.
Since the Sixth was enrolled on the 7th
of last May not a cent has any one of the
sturdy soldiers from Sacramento and the
San Joaquln Valley received from the
Government. Notwithstanding the in
conveniences those soldiers have had to
put up with on account of not being paid,
they have served their country well thus
far, and will willingly continue bo to do,
whether they get paid or not.
They still have hopes of being sent
where they will be of more service to the
country than they are now rendering.
They claim to be as well disciplined and
as physically able to hold their own
in battle as any other organization of
volunteers now In the service. They come
from a portion of the State where In sum
mer the mercury runs high, and their
ability to stand excessive heat is one of
the things on which they base their
claim that they are just the right kind of
soldiers to fight Spaniards in a climate
where the air is oppressive, as it some
times is in the localities they came from.
Some of the members of the Sixth
have been asked how they stood the
march on the Fourth of July, and their
response was they did not mind it much
more than an ordinary battalion drill ex
ercise, although they marched from the
foot of Market street to Van Ness ave
nue, thence to Fort Point, where their
camp is located.

An insurance and collection agent fn Otsego Cotmtjv
New York, constantly recommends Ripans Tabules to every-
body whom he suspects of suffering from dyspepsia, and takes
pleasure in relating his own experience, as follows : " I have
been a sufferer from dyspepsia for a dozen years or more, and
have tried all kinds of medicines that were said to be good (or a
positive cure), but none of them afforded much relief. I hayÂ«
always been blessed with a keen appetite and have, perhaps, in-
dulged too heartily at times and suffered accordingly. Last
winter while traveling through an adjoining county I first
learned of Ripans Tabules, and was induced by a friend to try
them. They have done me a great deal of good, and I think
that I have fair promise of a permanent cure. If I would b*
rccular about my meals now, I am sure I should be well"

PLAIN CASE OF FRAUD
DAYMONT STEPS IN 2:20 AND
LANDS A RACE.
Pool Favorite Presented With the
Last Race, Although Flagrantly
Violating the Rules â Noces
and Comments.
There was good racing yesterday at
Oakland, yet ;i very raw attempt at
fraud came near going through. In the
â¢econd race, the 2:20 trot. Dexter D was
pulled bo plainly bets were declared off.
The last heat of the day was wrongly
awardod and should have gone to Butcher
Boy, Inasmuch as Rex Alto was driven
to a break and whipped In on a run.
thus coming under the rule as to gaining
on a break. True, had he kept his feÂ«t
he would have won it, but Sullivan actu
ally whipped bins when on a break, thus
violating the rule stating that horses
should be at onoe caught, etc. Just why
the heat was given to Rex Alto was not
explained.
In the main the racing: was excellent.
Primrose won the -:25 pace In 2:19. Starter
Cohen having a pecuniary Interest in
Much Better, gave up the bellrope to T.
J. Crowley. The scoring was rather
tedious, and fourteen times they came
down before the word "go" was sounded.
Peanuts, at a long price, was placed, and
I his party were down on him across the
board. Flu Aymon and Resort were
rank, the latter being left at the barrier.
! His owner protested the start, and thus
ties up the money thirty days. His cabo
â will certainly be lost before the hoard of
review.
Dr. Frasse landed the three-year-old
race off the reel in 2:2tfii. Durfee sat
behind Maud Murray the second heat,
but she waff only one place ahead of her
Other heat. Dos Mlnutoa was fast but un-
Bteady. It will be a long while ere he sus
tains his nomenclature.
Daymont won the 2:23 trot in 2:20 hand
somely, Lottie, the favorite, second and
â Wlnella third. The winner is by Lyn
mont and the property of D. K. Knight,
who greatly enjoyed his victory.
Rex Alto was awarded the last race, but
it looked to be Butcher Boy's under any
Bort of application of the rules. Mizner
could have got his horse through at the
far turn but for Sullivan's "pinching;"
then after carrying Rex to a break near
the finish it seems hard that the rules
were not interpreted and Butcher Boy
awarded the heat, as was certainly merit
ed. The time was 2:17 and Rex Alto step
ped the last end of it in 32 seconds âa
2:08 showing that he has a great deal
of speed. Rex was 7 to 10 in the betting;
Butcher Boy 6 to 2.
There were no unnecessary delays and
outside Mr. Thompson's shortcomings, the
day was a most enjoyable one despite the
chilly air and stiff breeze. To-day's card
is a good one.

FOOTE AND HIRSCH WERE GOOD FISHERMEN
They Returned With Large Strings, but the Man That Caught
Them Was Not Paid.
This is not an ordinary fish 6tory.
On the contrary, it is true. It con
cerns W. W. Foote and Charley
Hirsch, and each of the gentH-men
will gladly vouch for the correctness
of It. They were recently at Santa
Cruz, and having fed the fishes all the
way down, thought It Uiit just to get
even. Each hired a boatman and
went forth to denude the sea of its
scaly denizens. They insisted on hav
ing large boats, so as to be able to
bring in all their prey.
Success was notable. Hirsch got
back first. He was burdened and fes
tooned with fish. He had fish to burn.
Knowing himself to be the cynosure
of all eyes he beamed with pride. He
posed for a picture, and in the glory
of his finny decoration was caught by
the camera. "Oh, it's nothing." ho
said modestly. "Some people can
catch fish and some can't. I'm one
who can, that's all." Observers were
as much charmed by his lack of os
tentation as by his impressive string.
But his splendor faded when Foote
came marching home under the weight
of a salmon of whale-like proportions.
Foote told how he had struggled with
the monster, and had finally dragged
him near enough to gaff. Hirsch felt
measly, and tried to get the negative
of his own photograph and break it.
Before long a stranger arrived.
There was a business-like look In his
eye, and he smelled of the .market
IRISH SOIL WILL
SOON BE HERE
COMING FROM PHILADELPHIA
ON A SPECIAL TRAIN.
Its Arrival Will Be Signalized by a
Grand Parade of Celtic
Organizations.
The soil from Erin which Is destined to
form a part of the exhibit in the Irish
Fair at Mechanics' Pavilion will arrive on
a special train within a very few days and
will receive a fitting reception. C. D. Tay
lor, agent in this citj- of the American line
of steamships, received a telegram to-day
which reads as follows:
PHILADELPHIA, July 5, 1898.
The consignment of Irish soil, carefully
packed in casks, arrived in this city Sunday
night by tlu- sleumer Waesland of the Ameri
can Line, and was duly passed through the
custom house. After Inspection by a committee
of members of the Celtic organizations, who
volunteered their s> â â â  â  : 1 that purpose, the
toil was started on its long trip overland in a
Bpecial cur of the Pennsylvania Hallway to Its
destination in San Francisco, where you will
please turn It over to the management of the
Irish fair.
Philadelphia Agents, American Line.
Mr. Taylor at once communicated this
j message to President Jeremiah Deasy of
j the Celtic Union and Manager L. W.
Buckley of the Irish Fair, at the head
quarters in the Phelan building, and they
will immediately make arangements for
its proper reception here. The Waeslana
took the sod on at (jueenstown, instead of
having it sent, as most freight and ship
ments of Ireland go, via Liverpool, so
that the soil came direct from Erin to
an American port without stopping at
any alien place. It lias been carefully
gathered from the different counties of
Ireland, under the supervision of the
agents of the American line, and the offi
cers of the National Federation of Ire
land. It is the first shipment of this
kind that has ever crossed the continent,
and when it arrives it will have traveled
at least COX) or 7'jOu miles. Each barrel
is sealed and will have the custom housÂ«
receipts to attest to its authenticity, and
will have the certificate of the examining
committee in Philadelphia, and of the
steamship agents. It will be placed in
the annex until ready to be placed on the
floor at the west end of the balcony 01
the Mechanics' Pavilion to make up the
big 60 by 100 foot map of Ireland.
Nearly 100 ladies met last night in the

place. "See here, Poota," he said, "I
wanta pay for da salmon. I no runna
raka gruft schema."
Foote blushed and put a finger to his
lips. "Hist," ho replied. "Yon are
off your base. I paid for that sal
mon."
The market man, disregarding the
effort at secrecy, convinced the lawyer
that the wrong man had been paid,
which was even so. A conscienceless
subordinate had played the lawyer low
down. Demurrers wore introduced,
and overruled. The salmon had to be
paid for again.
"Well," whispered Foote, looking
about cautiously, "how much?"
"Ten cents a pound."
"Ton cents nothing!" exclaimed
Foote. "You charged Hirsch 7 cents
for his flsh. I'm a city Jay, but I
want a square deal."
So the cat was out of the bag, the
trophies of the briny main out of the
monger's stall.

worm having gnawed him seriously,
made a clean breast of It. He con
fessed that he had bought the. ual

gaff its cold and lifeless form so as to
make the bluff good. Nay, more. The
scales of the salmon having been dis
arranged during its struggles in the
net, Foote had had them dressed down
with a sponge, the intent being to de

Will of Mrs. Kerrigan.
The will of Mrs. Mary Kerrigan, who
died July 4, leaving an estate valued at
celve. Having made these revelations
Foote returned to the whirl of busi
ness and called an Oakland Council
man a liar. He did not mean it. ITIb
family motto is "Death Before Dis
honor," and he was trying to commit
suicide.-
The fact leaked out that the pair of
plotters had each been a party to the
dark schemes of the other. Foote had
said to Hirsch, who had an envious
eye on certain large flsh exposed for
sale: "Don't you see you haven't a
hook big enough to land them? You
would give yourself away." So Hirsch
compromised on a lot of fish of medi
um weight and Foote relied upon the
gaffing.
But Hirsch got a stroke of con
science, too. He portrayed the shame
less manner In which Foote had tried
to secure even a bigger iish than he
got, and had only been restrained
by the fact that the fish had
already been cleaned. "You know,
Mr. Foote," the stallkeeper had said,
mildly. "that the salmon when
yanked from the bosom of the deep
had insides." Foote considered the

Rumor has it that the exposure cost
the guilty parties dearly, but the con
firming of thiÃ would require investi

part of a flsh story.

A BRUTAL PARENT.
D. C. Vanier, a Cruel Child-Beater,
Threatens to Horsewhip One
of His Girls.
D. C. Vanler. who has just served a six
months' term in the County Jail for bru
tally beating his children, Is likely to get
himself into trouble again.
While serving his sentence his wife
procured a divorce from him and is now
living on Broadway, between Polk street
and Van Ness avenue. The eldest girl
is employed by a family on Octavia street
and Tuesday night her brother called
there and told her that her mother was
sick and wanted to see her. As soon as
they left the house they met Vanier, who
told the girl to coax her mother to re
marry him. She refused and Vanier
threatened to horsewhip her. The girl's
mother was not sick and Vanier had won
over the boy to tell his sister a falsehood
to get her out of the house.
The girl reported the matter at police
headquarters yesterday, and Officer Mo-
Murray of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children was Instructed to
keep a sharp lookout for Vanier, as it is
believed that he will attempt to carry out
his threat against tho girl
The case of cruelty for which Vanier
was sentenced was onÂ» of the worst ever
heard In a Police Court. He beat one of
his boys most unmercifully.

HE HAS A
LONG MEMORY
Engineer Curtis Under
Cross- Examination.
HAS HAD RESPONSIBILITIES
FITZGERALD'S SEARCHING IN
QUIRY.
Some Land That Has Been Purchased
by the Southern Pacific
During the Past
Year.
Engineer Curtis of the Southern Pa
::lnc Company occupied the witness stand
In Commissioner Heaeock's courtroom
yesterday afternoon and underwent a
further cross-examination at the hands
of Attorney General Fitzgerald. Al
though a great deal of ground was cov
ered during the session the examination
bids fair to last the remainder of the
week. The Attorney General has evi
dently made an exhaustive examination
Into the witnesses' direct testimony and
taken copious notes, from which he gath
ers material for further interrogations.
The threads of Tuesday's testlmony
were taken up at the opening of the day's
proceedings. The witness was asked
whether he was consufted about the con
struction of the bridges anu buildings on
the Arizona, New Mexico and Copper
opolls roads, to which he replied that he
had as assistant superintendent been
head of the division and in charge at the
timo of the construction. "When I went
to Arizona," said Mr. Curtis, "more than
half of the Southern Pacific was built."
"Is the bridge crossing the Colorado
River a part of the Southern Pacific of
California?" asked Mr. Fitzgerald.
"1 am not sure of that," answered
Curtis.
"Were you consulted In any way about
ihe construction of that bridge?"
"Not the bridge tnat was constructed,
but I was down there. Andrew K. Ste
vens was the superintendent at that time.
[ was consulted as to many other mat
ters."
"To what extent?" asked the Attorney
Genera!.
The witness then outlined the history
>f his labor on the road mentioned, stat
ing that he was constantly consulted, he
being the highest representative of the
Southern Pacific down there.
"What proportion of your time did
your duties occupy while you were di
vision superintendent of those two
roadB?"
"All my time: sometimes day and night.
I don't think I took my clothes off ex
cept to change one suit for another for a
month at a time."
"Was there not, at the time you speak,
a great many rows and a deal of jealousy
between the heads of departments?"
"I don't remember, but If there was any
and I participated I think I came out oh
top."
The Attorney General responded by
iaylng he didn't doubt It.
The witness was then examined on a
new tack. He was asked when he was
made general superintendent of the Cen
tral Pacific and Its leased lines, to which
he answered in 1881. He said he had
charge of the maintenance of construc
tion, supplies and property In general ap
purtenant to the track.
A lengthy examination was then gone
into about purchasing ties and about the
duties he performed as such official. He
was Interrogated as to the changes made
In the Soledad Canyon and he stated that
three were made owing to floods.
"When the first change was made," he
said, "I was superintendent of tracks,
and I think when the third change was
made I was engineer of maintenance of
way. As to the work. I think It was done
by the Southern Pacific and not by the
P. I. Company."
Judge Fitzgerald suggested that the
witness refresh hiÃ memory, as he
thought it was done by the Improvement
company.
"What rights of way have been pur
chased by the company during the past
year?" he was asked.
"A considerable piece of land wad nur
chased at Santa Clara, about a mljfc or
three-quarters in length, and $1000 e.n
acre was paid for it. An acre of land was
also purchased in Oakland, for which
about $30,000 was paid, and we bought a
I>iÂ»oe of land for the extension of our
yards in San Jose, for which I think we
paid $1000 an acre."
The witness told of a few other acqui
sitions and then branched on to the sub
ject of tunnels. Ho .Admitted having su
perintended and constructed tunnels 14
and 15 on the Central Pacific line in the
eastern part of California.
"The men who did the actual excava
tion,' he said, "were under Mr. Stro
bridge. I directed the workmen where to
place the timbers and had general super
vision."
"What did Strobridge do?" was nsked.
"The only thing I ever saw him do."
answered the witness, "was to come
around and scold the foreman because
they were not making better progress."
Further cross-examination will be made
at 2 o'clock to-day.
SWALLOWED CARBOLIC ACID.
Mrs. C. J. Joseph, Divorced Wife of a
Policeman, Is Tired of Life.
The divorced wife of Policeman C. J.
Joseph attempted to commit suicide at
her residence, 118 Sheridan street, yester
day afternoon by swallowing a dose of
carbolic acid.
Mrs. Joseph, with her two young chil
dren, has been living with her fnther and
brother since the divorce. Yesterday aft
ernoon the neighbors notified Policeman
H. O'Day that she had taken poison, and
he at once summoned the ambulance and
she was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
The usual antidotes were administered
and it is expected that she will recover.
She said she had taken the poison In a
fit of despondency. Everything had been
going against her. Joseph had married
again, and since his marriage had not
been paying her alimony and she had
spent all' her money trying to compel him
to do so. Besides, she had other troubles
and thought it better to end them all.

THAT IT WAS
SPITE WORK
Declares That He Has Only
Followed an Old Board
Precedent.
Drucker Asserts That He Was Woefully
Misled by His Friendâ Barrington Will
Talk Later.
The expose of tho methods that have
obtained in the conduct of the business
of the buildings and grounds committee
of tin- Board of Education, growing out
of the charges filed against Chairman
Burns of that vommittee by Director
Gallagher, h"s resulted in a great deal
of speculation as to the cause thereof. It
wus generally believed that very har
monious relation* existed between the ac
itor and his fellow committee
man, Drucker, and this was correct; but
it was not known that the latter gentle
-ince he has been a member of that
body has devoted no attention to the
work of the committee, save to sign
whatever bills were presented to him by
Burns without question. The result has
been that Mr. Drucker rinds himself in
a vi ry embarrassing position, and he is
not through bemoaning the fact that he
placed so much "confidence" in the re
liability and "good faith" of his colleague.
The awkwardness of his situation may
be better understood by the statement
of the fact tliat In the past fiscal year
Mr. Burns, in his quaint and quiet way,
has expended over $100,000 without, as Mr.
Drucker declares, consulting him or ob
taining Banction therefor. If Mr. Burns
saw a place wiiere some money could be
. whether it amounted to a few hun
or thousand dollars, he forthwith
and Mr. Drucker, on the state
ol the chairman that it was "all
automatically signed the vouch
â l went about the professional pur
; â  ctlve molar*.
Director Drucker, however, feels very
grateful to Chairman Gallagher of the
linance committee for "discovering" the
committee facts for him, although they
had been passing under his view for
eighteen months. Director Gallagher had
served on the building committee previ
ously and knew what was going on. Hav
ing a deficit In view and knowing that
something would "drop" when the time
came to pay the bills he concluded to
expose what lv terms the "gross mis
munaerement and illegal acts" of Chair
man Burns, which he proceeded to do.
Director Burns, during the trying two
hours' session, in which several of his fel
low-directors were jumping on his meth
ods and shattering his handmade plans
to improve the buildings and grounds or
the School Department, was literally
speechless and offered no comment on the
proceedings or answers to questions. He
was either too angry to talk or had noth
ing to say, but he found his speech yes
terday and very emphatically declared
that the whole business was firstly,
"tommy rot," and secondly, was an ag
gravating piece of "spite work," the
wherefore of which he declined to state.
He places his honesty and reputation
against that of his accusers and feels that
an effort is being made to manufacture
a scapegoat out of him. Furthermore, he
considers the source of these allegations
and says they do not amount to anything
for the reason that he has "done nothing
wrong and has only, followed a precedent
that has existed for twenty: years.'' He
had nothing to say in reply to Drucker's
sudflen bolt and had not made up his
mind whether he will resign or go on
about his business as heretofore.
"This whole matter is of no particular
moment to me." said Director Burns last
evening, "except that it is very disagree
able to have your supposed friends fly in
your face and try and cover you with
mud. It is only a piece of spite work,
and some day the inside of this business
may be made public. No. I will not say
whin the attack is due to. and these gen
tlemen may go on and make this state
ment cr that. I don't care what, but they
know that they are not giving the true
causes for their actions for the reason |
that what I have done as chairman of
the buildings and grounds committee has
been simply to follow a precedent that
has ruled In the board for twenty years.
I have committed no dishonest act and
my work will bear the closest investiga
tion, for I have had it done cheaply and
well. Will I resign as a result of this x
plosion? Well, I have not made up my
mind as to that. If these charges were
true it would be my duty to do so, but
knowing that it is only for spite and an
effort to job me I may conclude that the
best thing I can do is to stay with the
game. Drucker's allegations can go for
what they are worth, and that Is not
much. So far as committee meetings are
concerned, there have been none held
since the beginning of the year, for there
was nothing to be done. That is all I
have to say."
Director Drucker had regained some of
his composure yesterday, but still had
a large portion of dlsesteem for his erst- !
while friend, Mr. Burns, and had no hesi- !
tation in stating it.
â¢ i was absolutely astounded when these
matters were brought to my attention by
Director Gallagher." said Mr. Drucker,
when afforded an opportunity to explain
his present posltkJn.-'.."You see, I never
attended the meetings of the committee,
and there was none held until last Sat- :
urday night after Mr. Gallagher filed his
charges. In fact, there have been no
meetings held. If there were, I was
never notified to attend, and knew noth
ing about them. Mr. Burns has done the
whole work himself. Of course, you ,
know that the chairman of a committee !
attends to everything. Mr. Burns and I
have been close chums for the past two
years, and knowing him as I did, I |
placed the utmost confidence in him, be- ,
ing assured that he would not abuse this
confidence; but I find that I have been ,
grossly deceived and placed in a very
embarrassing position by one of my best :
friends. It is unpleasant to say this of
Mr. Burns, but it is true, and I must pro
tect myself In a case like, this, where
my reputation for honesty is at stake.
Between Burns. Inspector O'Brien and
Secretary Welch, I was nicely misled.
When the vouchers, etc., were presented
to me to sign, by either of the parties
I was told that everything was proper ,
and correct, and supposing that the,mat
ters had had the sanction of the board, I .
always signed, not doubting for a mo- ;
ment the truth of Mr. Burns statements.
1 can't investigate these matters myself.
If I did I could not attend to my private {
business, although I do visit the schools
occasionally. It fairly took my breath
away when I realized that, after spend- \
ing probably $150,000 last year. Burns had
before the end of the first -week In the
new fiscal year ordered $20,000 worth of ;
work done, and had arrangements to ex
pend $130,000 more, without taking the
trouble to let me know anything about
It. The worst part of It is that a great
deal of the work proposed was actually
needless, while at the same time there Is
a vast deal . of repairs the making of
which is Imperative. I am thoroughly
disgusted and -will have nothing whatever
to do with, such methods. Mr. Burns must
stand by the record he has made for him
self, it is not mine."
Chairman Gallagher was very subdued
when discussing the situation yesterday,
and seemed Inclined to smooth some of
the rough places for the man he suc
Â£?wira iii depriving of his chairmanship
powers and perquisites.
lv . 1 wish it understood," said he, softly,
that 1 do not accuse Mr. Burns of dis
honesty, but I investigated his conduct of
H?Â«t & -Si nt l . he com miÂ»ee and found
SSiit in n% co , Ii y 7 . at a P ace that would
result The big deneineey at i he en d of the
year. The fact hat he hod made read
to spend $20,000 at once, the greater part
of which was entirely uncalled for, caused
me to adopt the course I did. I did not
propose to be responsible for such doings
arid now that I have succeeded In placing
the board in a position where the labors
of this particular committee will be
shared by the whole board I am Batisfied.
For If there is anything of the kind done
in the future I will be protected I don't
know whether Mr. Burns win â¢ resign or
whether he will be asked to. I guess
things will go smoothly now."
President Barrington of the Board of
Education, who has had many a hot bat
tle with the majority in the board, is very
much interested in the present situation.
"1 can't conceive what has caused
Director Gallagher to make this sudden
change of attitude toward the members
of that committee, for as one of its form
er members and chairman of the finance
committee*, he knew what was going on all
the time. Neither do I understand why
Mr. Drucker should make the public
statement that he was ignorant of what
was going on. It does not seem possible
that he could be so. He and Mr. Burns
have been like two Dromios and were
together one or two days each week. Tho
natural inference is that they were not in
each other's company for. pleasure alone.
The assertion of Drucker that there has
been no meetings of the committee Is un
true, for I have attended them. The
committee for a long time has been Burns
and Drucker. as Director Carew has
persistently refused to have anything to
do with it or even to attach his name
to vouchers of any kind. What his rea
sons are for so doing I do not know. I
will not make any allegations outside the
board, but at the next regular meeting
I shall have some statements to make
officially, the facts of which I am verify
ing now."
There are many reasons advanced for
Drucker's sudden desertion of the com
bination of which he has for a year and
a half been a conspicuous member. By
his action of Tuesday night in throwing
all the blame for misdeeds upon his chum
Burns he- made it possible'for the minor
ity to disrupt the hitherto harmonious
nine and disgrace Burns. The best ex
planation comes from those who know
Mr. Drucker intimately, and it lies in the
assertion that he is "doing some politics"
for the promotion of his ambition to oc
cupy a higher official position in this city.
With reference to the status of the con
tractors who have done work or furnished
material on the oraer of Chairman Burns,
Director Gallagher stated yesterday that
as they were "innocent parties" their in
terests would be protected.
ACCUSED OF
COWARDICE
Burkes Brother Prefers
Grave Charges.
FORSAKEN BY HIS MEN
THE OFFICERS BROUGHT BEFORE
THE COMMISSIONERS.
Patrick Burke, brother of Lieutenant
Burke, who was shot and killed by Theo
dore Park Haynes, the eccentric tinker,
who has Bince been sentenced to life im
prisonment, is determined to "break" the
officers who accompanied the unfortunate
police official on his mission to death.
Last night he had them cited to appear
before the Police Commissioners to show
cause why they should not be dismissed
from the force for cowardice.
In the complaint Burke stated that
Marlowe, Wilkinson, Kennedy and Mer
chant, who were with the brave lieuten
ant at the time he was killed, allowed
his brother to be shot down without mak
ing the faintest attempt to protect him.
For the betterment of the police depart
ment he asked that the men be branded
as cowards and summarily dismissed
from the force.
The accused officers, accompanied by
their attorneys, appeared before the Com
missioners last night determined if pos
sible to save their stars. After the com
plaint was read Assistant District Attor
ney Dunn, who represented one of them,
asked for a continuance for two weeks on
the ground that he was not ready to pro
ceed.
"The charges against these men," he
said, "were preferred on June 29, but for
some reason I was not notified of the ac
tion of the dead lieutenant's brother un
til yesterday morning. On account of the
voluminous testimony which was taken in
the case 1 respectfully ask for a two
weeks' continuance."
Eugene Deuprey, who represents the
prosecution, announced that while he was
ready to proceed he had no objection to
a continuance, as he desired to give the
accused men a fair and impartial trial.
"All we want is a thorough investiga
tion," he remarked, "and if the defend
ants are as the complaint alleges, wo
ask that they be dismissed from the
force."
Commissioner Alvord announced that as
a rule be was opposed to long continu
. but as the testimony In the Su
perior Court would have to be considered,
he had no abjection to continuing the
cast for two weeks. He, however, re
marked that at that time the trial would
have to proceed, and he for one would
sit until It was finished, even if it re
quired his constant attention for five days
or more.
I am determined to sift this matter to
the bottom." he declared. "Both sides
want a thorough Investigation, and I in
tenfl to see that they get it."
Senator Wolf, who is also arrayed on
the side of the accused policemen, an
nounced that he was anxious for a con
tinuance. While doubting the power of
the Commissioners to compel the wit
nesses in the cam to appear before them,
he asked that they be duly summoned to
testily at the proper time.
Chief of Police Lees, who seems deter
mined to shield the erring officers re
marked that ne had subpenaed every wit
ness who knew anything about the case
Attorney Dunn apparently ignoring the
remark of the head of the Police De
partment, said that he had a number of
witnesses who did not testify at the pre
liminary examination in the Police Court
or at the trial in the Superior Court. They
had been duly summoned, he said and
would give evidence In favor of the ac
cused policemen.
On motion of Commissioner Alvord the
hearing of the case was continued for
two weeks. â¢
After the continuance was granted the
brother of the dead lieutenant announced
that he intended to do all in his power to
"break" the offending officers. "They
showed themselves to be cowards," he re
marked, "when they allowed my unfor
tunate brother to be shot down in cold
blood. They could have saved his life if
they were men, but they proved them
selves cowards and ought to be relegated
to obscurity. I have personally em
ployed Mr. Deuprey to prosecute them,
and hope that he will succeed in having
them removed from the force."

THE SA:N FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 7, 1898.
THE STORY OF HIS TRAVELS,
H. T. Smith, Diplomat and Humorist, Who
Sails for Japan To-Dau.
Hubbard T. Smith, of the United States consular service, leaves the city
to-day on board the steamship Coptic for Kobe, Japan, where he will bo
stationed for a year or two as Vice and Deputy Consul.
Mr. Smith returned in September last from a three years' term of duty in
Paris and Constantinople. "Regarding Constantinople," he said last night,
"some writer has stated that the best way to see Constantinople is to sail
up the Bosphorus some morning at sunrise or In the evening at sunset and
thenâ sail away without landing. Had I done this my impressions of the
famed capital of the unspeakable Turk would have been different from what
they now are. From the Golden Horn and Bosphorus, under the conditions
named, Constantinople is a dream city. The lofty domes, and the tower
ing minarets rising out of groves of evergreen cypress, the shores on either
side lined with white marble palaces and over ail a sky of indescribable
blue shot with innumerable rosy tintsâ the scene is one of sublime beauty.
But the instant the steamer touches the filthy dock and the traveler sets
foot on Turkish soil the vision is dispelled a thousand and one disgusting
odors salute the nostrils emanating from heaps of rotting re.fuse piled
along the streets. Stumbling over the wretchedly paved thoroughfares â
pavements are almost an unknown Quantityâ avoiding the groups of snarl
ing, lighting street dogs, jostled by the vendors of fruits, vegetables, meats
and sweets, the visitor finally reaches his hotel in a half dazed condition.
Fortunately once there he finds comfort and safety, for the European
hotels in Constantinople are llrst-class.
"My life in Turkey was during a most unpleasant but Interesting period.
The people of the United States will never be able to fully appreciate the
horrors of the massacre of Armenians, which took place in the streets of
Constantinople on the 26th and 27th of August, IS9G, when some six thous
ands of those wretched people were knocked in the head like so many cat
tle. The exact number of the victims sacrificed to Turkish hatred and
cruelty during that terrible period will never be known. In the official re
ports made to the Home Office by the British Embassy in Constantinople
the estimate was placed at five thousand men, women and children In the
city and suburbs alone. It Is needless to say that the European colony
lived in constant fear of a general uprising when all Christians would be
sacrificed Irrespective of nationality.
"Closely following the massacres came the war between Turkey and
Greece. Immediately after the commencement of hostilities all Greek sub
jects were ordered to leave Turkish territory within fifteen days and when
I tell you that some eighty thousand subjects of Greece reside in Con
stantinople alone you can imagine the commotion. Many left at once but
there were thousands who could not get away and their distress was piti
able. The British, French, German and American consulates were thronged
with people begging to be taken under the protection of the flag of some
friendly nation. France finally accepted the office of looking after Greek
interests in Turkey during the continuation of the war, but fortunately the
time allowed the unfortunates was extended again and again through the
influence of the respresentatives of other nations until the signing of the
armistice and much suffering was averted.
Had the Greek navy been allowed by the powers to take an active part
in the war the result might have been different. A prominent Greek official
told me that it was the intention of the admiral of the fleet to attempt the
passage through the Dardanelles in the hope of getting one or two of their
vessels into the harbor at Constantinople. Had one vessel alone succeeded
In passing unscathed through the strong fortifications at the Dardanelles
and reached Constantinople in safety the Greeks would have been In a posi
tion to dictate terms, for Ylldiz palace and the city would have been at the
mercy of the guns. Unfortunately for them the admiral of the combined
fleet of the powers threatened to sink the entire Greek fleet If a movement
was made toward Constantinople. As a consequence the Greeks had to de
pend on the little army of 55,000 men in the battles oh the Thessaly frontier
with some 200,000 Turkish soldiers. Small wonder then that the former
made such a poor showing. It was retreat or utter annihilation and they re
treated.
Mr. Smith Is the composer of that ancient but still remembered ditty
entitled "Listen to My Tale of Woe" and In response to a query as to wheth
er he had further inflicted the public in a musical way he said;
"The 'Tale of Woe' has been my most successful song. I have writ
ten several others however, that have become quite well known, among
them 'If you love me, darling, tell me with your eyes,' 'The Country Band';
â¢Swinging in the Grapevine Swing,' and 'The Song that breaks my heart '
Since returning to this country in September last I have written three new
songs, viz: 'The dear old Tombigbee,' which is on the style of the popu
ular ballad 'On the Banks of the Wabash,' an d two 'coon' songs, 'My
Little Mandy' and 'De Coaxin'est Man.' After I have been long enough
in Japan to become acquainted with Japanese music I hope to write some
novelties in a musical way."

night. The affair, which was more par
ticularly in honor of Colonel Carringtonis
promotion from captain to lieutenant

respect. In the large dining hall
tables were arranged in the form of a
hollow square and groaned under the
viands, which were anything but cam
paign rations.
Toasts were rendered as follows: "The
President of the United States," W. B.
Bradford; "The Guest of the Evening,"
Colonel Sumner; "The United Blue and
Gray," James P. Langhorne; "Our Ar
my," Inspector General R. P. Hughes;
"Our Volunteers," Adjutant General Bar
rett; "Our Heroes," Colonel J. F. Bur
gin. The toasts were all bright, witty
and interesting, and at their conclusion
the evening was given up to the
singing of patriotic songs and the
relating of war anecdotes. The Cos
mos Club has many members now
In the field, and anything of a patriotic
nature touches a warm spot in the hearts
of the members.

ANTI-RING
POPULISTS
Appeal to the Public to
Fight for Liberty.
OPPOSED TO THE RAILROADS

GANIZATION.
San Francisco to Be Purified and the
Railroad Commission
to Be Sus
tained.
The anti-ring Populists met In the As
sembly hall of the Parrott building yes
terday and prepared an address to the
public calling on the people of the State
to organize to tight for their liberty from
railroad monopoly.
W. T. Baggett, A. W. Thompson and
George "W. Monteith were appointed a
committee to perfect the plan of organiza
tion. The address is as follows:
To the Populists of California: A few years
ago the then untried bark of populism was
launched upon the stormy sea ot American
politics. Manned by a few honest and earn
est patriots It nailed the banner of liberty to
Its masthead and went forth to battle In the
cause of freedom and humanity. In the pros
ecution of its high aim it offered no reward
and held forth no Inducement of material gain
â simply asked the tolling millions to Join in
the redemption of the republic from the fate
ful domination of nionopoly and corruption.
Breathing the eternal spirit of true Ameri
canism, it called on all patriots to join in a
common movement of the common people for
the common good.
It knew no South, no North, no East, no
West; it recognized neither caste, race nor
creed, but believed in one nation for one peo
ple; it sought their happiness; it asserted their
equality and it demanded their liberty.
In the great American nation a million hon
est hearts responded to its call to arms, and a
million sincere patriots arrayed themselves,
around its standard. Men forsook the politi
cal associations of a lifetime and buried all
sectional hatred and party prejudice in a
united effort to better the conditions of those
who labor that they may live. These brave vol
unteers, in the great cause of human liberty,
sought the redemption of the republic from
the domination of the avaricious plutocracy
that held it in a thralldom of mtsgovernment
and corruption.
Its short life has been marked by crises, due
to the subtle efforts of its enemy, to accom
plish its ruin. Two years ago its good name
and party privileges were bartered to aid in a
battle upon a minor issue which left the party
in a state of hopelessness and helplessness
bordering upon demoralization and so much so
that it is now almost in the throes of disso
lution, with treachery in its ranks and cor
ruption at its guard line. Its future is of
anxious concern to two great parties, one of
which seeks its destruction, and the other its
absorption.
litre in California we see our State bound
hand and font by a conscienceless monopoly.
We see the departments of government cor
rupted, the halls of legislation disgraced and
the temple of Justice defiled. Our famers are
in servitude, fur their farms are made profit
less by the extortions of the monopoly. Our
mechanics are Idle and our merchants are un
paid. Our people struggle to exist; they face
starvation, misery and ruin, and in the midst
of a land more generously endowed by nature
than perhaps any other on the face of the
earth, their condition grows steadily worse ana
worse.
There is a single cause for this fearful con
dition and it Is found in the corrupt domina
tion of the Southern Pacific monopoly that
lies upon it as an Incubus.
While not moving one Jot from the great
princii'les of Populism in'-!u<led in our na
tional platform, we have no hesitation in say
ing that the duty of the hour is to redeem our
State from the destructive supremacy of the
old monopoly. The first duty of a man Is to
his family and his home, and our first duty
is to save our homes and ourselves from the
baneful influence that overshadows us so com
pletely.
Political differences must sink in the achieve
ment of a common purpose â the destruction of
the great political machine which dominate*
every department of our State government
and which cuts us off from every source of
relief. We must liberate California, and until
that is achieved we must forego no effort that
will accomplish that end.
Vpon the Populist party to-day rests a heavy
responsibility. The 60,000 Populists who voted
the ticket four - ears aco are Just as sincere
Populists to-day as they were then, and they
are ready and willing ' join in any move
ment that appeals to their intelligence, sat
isfies their judgment, and stirs their hearts to
action. No boss can successfully crack the
party lash over the head of a Populist. He is
an independent, free biTrn and liberty-loving
citizen, who will bow alone to the dictates of
reason. The Populist party has it in its
power to pave California; to secure upon the
official ballot a ticket that will command the
confidence of every honest man. It must not
alone propose measures, but it must provide
men who are competent and who can be de
pended upon to carry its measures forward to
success. Untried and unknown men will be
but experiments, worthy, perhaps, but until
tried not to be confided in
To win the great battle against the railroad
two things must be accomplished. The rail
road political machine must be destroyed and
provision made to prevent its being repaired
or a new one erected in its place. The days of
corruption and machine rule must be num
bered.
To practically accomplish this the State con
stitution must be amended, and to that end
an honest Governor and Legislature must be
elected; our judicial pvstem revised and salu
tary laws promulgated.
The Legislature Is the key to the arch. The
best men in the State must be induced to go
to the Legislatureâ men of sufficient course
to not only enact good laws, but who will Im
peach those judges and other officials who
have made the administration of Justice in this
State a scandal and a disgrace.
The Railroad Commission must be sustained
and its hands upheld, and when this is all
done the people must take into their own hands
the power to regulate their State government
whenever the necessity requires by being able
to directly annul a bad law, compel the en
actment of a good law, and remove at will all
unfaithful sonants.
The city of San Francisco Is the hotbed of
corruption; it must be cleanspd and purified.
As a result -we must elect an honest Governor
nnrt honest Legislature, two honest Supreme
Judges, three honest Railroad Commissioners
and sustain the New Charter. The men se
lected should be those who have been tried
and found true, for thpse are the vantage
points in the coming campaign. We can com
bine and conquer; we can divide and lose.
AVlfh the single purpose of elpvating our
party to' this former hl<*h standard we earn
estly apppeal to our State convention to take
that action which will redeem the State for
once and for all.
HE WANTED TO DIE.
James Emerson, an Old Sea Captain,
Attempts Suicide.
James Emerson, an old sea captain,
was found in an unconscious condition in
a room in a lodging house at 20 Eddy
street, late last night. Suspecting that
he had taken poison the landlady of the
house summoned a policeman, who had
him removed to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Bunnel, who examined him, found
that he was suffering from oxalic poi
son. After being relieved of thtÂ» drug
Emerson, who is 71 years of age, said he
was tired of life and wanted to die. A
few days ago he was discharged from
the County Hospital, where he had been
confined for some time.

or without removal. J. Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission.
THEY GOT HIS MONEY.

According to Erlich's story, he was walk
ing along the street, when his

DR. PIERCE & SONâ Gentlemen: Last Oc-
tober, while at Fort Bliss, El Paso. Texas, I
sent for one of your famous "Dr. Pierces Elec-
tric Belts." for Rheumatism, etc., and after I
using it only two months my complaints en- ]
tirely disappeared and I have not been troubled
with ony pain or discomfort since. I consider
your Belt to be the finest body-battery in ex- |
istence, aÂ« the electric current is both â¢powerful j
j and lasting. I purchased your No. XXX Belt,
and now, after using it several months, it Is .
as good as new.
I heartily recommend Dr. Pierces Electric
Belt to all sufferers. Yours gratefully,

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 6.- The sentimental ef
fect of Commodore Schley's victory was en
tirely dissipated to-day and the stock market
dropped back Into the condition of lethargy and
of waiting for developments which had marked
some time previous t>> this week. The
satisfaction cf the demand aroused by the
new? of the victory Is a s-triking demonstration
of the fact 'hat the war is little taken ac
count of in the stock market. Many observers
believe that its successful termination has al
ready been discounted and the only develop
ment in its progress likely to affect prices of
pecurities would be something unfavorable to
the success of the United States. The financial
collapse of Spain is felt to be Inevitable, and
the longer the strain is maintained the greater
the damage that will be Inflicted by the final
disaster. The bankruptcy of the Spanish Gov
ernment must Inevitably have far-reaching ef
fect in the financial vrorld and is bound to be
reflected in this country. evÂ»>n In face of
triumphs and prosperity, for forced liquidation
will seek the strongest market to realize in.
The effect of the Government loan on the
money market is also a:i unsolved problem and
beget? hesitation in speculative ventures.
There is bound to be continued uncertainty as
country's prosperity for the coming year
until t ire finally harvested, or
at leapt u:itil the dilaensi< ns and the prices
they will bring are known. The expectation
that a naval victory would awaken speculative
activity having been disc ":nttvl. to-, lay's 'lull

drawal to-day from the Bank of England of
Â£105.000 in German coin and of Â£10.000 for
Holland. in addition to the' Â£24.000 withdrawn ;
yesterday, has caused a sharp rise in discount ;
rates, and makes the bankers skeptical of a
further early reduction In the banks- discount ;
rate. For this reason the stock markets here
were dull and drooping to-day.
Bo far as Americans are concerned operators
here are discouraged by the persistency with
which Wall street sells on any advance here. I

Bradstreefs world's visible supply of wheat

Mountains, in Europe and afloat therefor, in ,
Australia and in Argentina amounted to 84,
i 804,000 bushels, 0,008,000 bushels smaller that, j

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 6â Continued fine weather,
lower Liverpool cables and the generally bear
ish sentiment of the trade started Wheat easy.
In the first hour there was a ROO'l deal of long
Wheat sold out and free selling for the short
account. Thoman's crop report for July was
made public and was considered bearish, as It
claimed that with all the damage reported and
admitted the yield indicated a production of
655,000,000 bush?ls. against 680,000,000 bushels
claimed to have been raised last year. Later
in the day there were a number of bad crop
advices received. This, together with reports
from different sections throughout the country
'â umplalning of the slow movement of the new
Wheat and the imperative demand from mill
ers, caused the traders to turn bullish. Early
sellers covered freely and prices took an up
turn. July closed 2V*c higher and September
rose T <jc.
fnfavnrahle crop news and an improved cash
demand were the bull influences in Corn. There
was a good speculative demand from both
shorts and prominent operators. July ad
vanced ~*'alc higher.
Sympathy with Wheat and Corn, a better
shipping demand, light receipts and buying by
July shorts caused the advance in Oats. July
left off lc higher.
Higher prices at the yard.", smaller receipts
than estimated, together with satisfactory re
[m rtÂ« from the South as to the yellow fever
situation, strengthened Provisions. There was
a good cash trade and the foreign demand was
slightly improved. Pork closed 20c higher, 5@
7Uc in lard and 12Hc i n ribs.

I CONQUEST OF THE PirLIPPINES.
The assertion made in some quarters
that it will taJte 50,000 United States
I soldiers to finish the conquest of the
I Philippines is absurd. About 20.000
j Spanish soldiers are said to be in the
islands now. This force was sent there
to quell the rebellion, and was in the
j islands long before the war with the
United States began. With the help of
Dewey's fleet 12,000 or 15,000 American
soldiers could capture these 20,000 Span
ish troops, even if the insurgents give
no aid. The insurgents, however, are
likely to afford some help. Possibly
after the Spaniards are driven out some
of the rebels may be a little trouble
some to the United States for a time,
but the peril from this source is not
likely to be formidable. A force which
can conquer the Spaniard z in the is
| lands can easily hold them afterward,
and an army of 15,000 probably would
be ample for this work, but the earlier
the army gets to the islands the easier
the work is likely to be. â St. Louis

OAKLAND. July 6.â As wns to be ex
pected, Dr. Pardee'a Oakland organ, the
Enquirer, rushes madly to thru candi
date's defense, who is smarting under the
exposures made of his method of doing
politics by The Call. Why Dr. Pardee
should tnke his candidacy seriously is
much more than the substantial Republi
cans of Oakland and Alameda County
can surmise. The man never has been
anything other than a job-chaser and a
peanut politician, and cares no more for

of the "Courthouse gang" of Oakland,

with the Non-Partisan nomination in his
pocket, he was nightly niakii ;
denouncing the Prod Campbell*,
ililes Doodys, the Mike bialllhans, the

Guy C. Karl, who does the smooth work
for the railroad monopoly on the Oakland
Fide of the bay.
When Steve Gage picked out Earl to
represent the old vrooman district he in
tended him as a reaching pole^f or new
lines. The Christian element was his
oyster. Through Karl new channels in
politics were to be opened. One of them
was Supervisor Mitchell, who will be re
membered as throwing down the people
last year in the Alameda Board of Equal
ization. This culprit was the creature of
Earl, the creature of Gage. Earl now is
the General B!.-: Pardee's cohorts.
When in the Legislature Karl could safe
ly be depended on by the railroad and
his slick work at Sacramento on behalf
of the monopoly is a matter of common
talk to-day.
Then there is Assessor Dal ton. who
always strikes so hard at the railroad
that In falling short he breaks his own
arm. Dalton was one of Pardee's candi
dates for the Council some years ago- He
went to thre railroad and demanded its
support in the First Ward, which is polit
ically owned by the railroad. He was
elected, and at once began an onslaught
on the monopoly. He caused the gates to
be put on the Oakland local trains to the
Immense profit of the railroad ev< r since.
})' caused litigation to be commenced
against the company fi kland
water front, the result of whicli was that
the city of Oakland lost every point by it,
and to-day as Assessor of Alameda Coun
ty he is compelled to acknowledge the
railroad's ownership by assessing to it
the entire property along the shore of the
city. As Assessor his levy has been so
muddled that by playing into the hands
of Supervisors Mitchell, Church and other
Pardee men his figures have always
been cut down, until to-day the railroad
bus less to fear in Alameda County in
shirking its legal responsibilities than in
any o.her eÂ«urty in the Stato.
These fellowsâ thes. boomers â
are slirk workers. They make more anti
railroad clap-trap than all the honest men
in the county, and yet the n suits of their
work never hurt Huntingtun's interests
here.
Their organ, the Enquirer, was acquired
for bulldozing the county candidatt

Then there is little Cuvellier, the rail

true that this little "jackanape" has
been suppressed somewhat and told that
his friendship acts as a boomerang. Nev
. ertheless, he is much in evidence in the
Pardee interest in railroad circles and in
non-partisan councils of the city. It is
understood that Cuvellier is to be given

This is the character of men who are
backing Pardee in Oakland. These are
some of the methods he is using to capture
the delegation from a county that should

used to call them, "the gang," will be able
to win out for him remains to be ascer

scheme will carry is a question, but when
calmly considered it can be termed little
; short of a political sacrilege to see the
influence of the banner Republican county
of California so badly smashed and dis
graced as it will be because of Pardee's
rough and high-handed politics. Alameda
certainly deserves better, and its loyal Re

A MOTHER'S
UNHAPPY LIFE
Fight for Three Pretty
Girls in Court.
WEDDED TWENTY-TWO YEARS
MRS. SCHAEFFER ON THE WIT
NESS STAND.
Peace Did Not Reign in the Wyo
ming Cattle King's Home
When She Left
It.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 6.
The first skirmish In the legal battle for
the possession of the children of the Wy
oming cattle baron, Joel J. Hurt, took
place in Judge Ogden's court to-day.
Alphonse Schaeffer. the present husband
of the children's mother, was present in
custody of a police officer, he being under
arrest for felony for attempting to use
his gun on Hurt yesterday in the Sheriff's
office.
Mrs. Schaeffer told her story this morn-
Ing and said that she married Hurt at
Rollins, Wyo., in September, twenty-two
years ago. Six children were born to
them, three boys and three girls, and In
1594 the parents quarreled. In July,
1595, Mrs. Schaeffer says. Hurt com
menced an action for divorce. She
filed a cross-complaint, alleging adultery,
and the Judge denied judgment to the
husband and awarded the decree to the
wife, as well as the custody of tho three
little girls. She says that she was ordered
by the court to remove the children to a
suitable place for their proper education,
and she complied with . the order. She
fled to Denver to avoid the scandal and
persecution to which she alleges her hus
band exposed her. She says her ex-hus
band is a dangerous man, and that in
April, 1596, he committed murder by kill
ing William Milne.
In concluding her evidence Mrs.
Schaeffer told of her happy life with Al
phonse Schaeffer, to whom she was mar
ried at Cheyenne in July of last year.
She says he is kind and dutiful and a.
good husband.
The oldest daughter, Jessie, was put on
the stand to corroborate her mother's
testimony regarding their travels through
Colorado and Mexico, and also to testify
as to the kind character of her stepfather.
Attorney E. M. Gibson, who appeared
for Mrs. Schaeffer, argued against the
admission of the amended decree that
awarded the custody of the children to
Joel Hurt on the ground that a decree of
one State cannot be used in evidence in
another State. He also objected to the
admission of certificates that bore date
July 1. because they were not carrying an
inland revenue stamp, as required by a
recent act of Congress.
Gavin McNab argued in favor of their
admission, and the court took the matter
under advisement till to-morrow morn
ing.
STEREOTYPERS' UNION
LOSES THE STRIKE
Chicago Newspapers Resume Publica-
tion, but in Greatly Reduced
Form.
CHICAGO. July 6.â President Prescott
I of the International Typographical Union,
j who came from Indianapolis to make an
investigation, decided that the strike of
the stereotypers employed on the Chicago
newspapers was illegal and that they
should have adhered to their contracts.
As the Stereotypers 1 Union is subordinate
to the Typographical Union, this decision
opened the way to the newspapers to re
sume publication. Accordingly all of the
morning papers were issued to-day, but
reduced in size â only four pagesâ the
I stereotypers' plates having been made by
i non-union men. The afternoon papers
also appeared in the same form, having
engaged new men. To-morrow the size
of all the papers will be doubled, and it
i is expected by Friday the usual number
i of pages can be got out".
As the newspaper publishers have
! agreed not to have anything to do with
the Stereotypers' Union hereafter, the
j 200 men who struck last Friday night will
have difficulty in finding work in Chicago,
as many non-union stereotypers from
other cities have come out and more are
said to be on their way.

An "Upturned Hulk Found Floating
245 Miles West of Coos Bay
Believed to Be the
Wreck.
Bp*o.lal Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, July 6.â The schooner No
mad, which sailed in ballast from
Shanghai for Seattle on December 7
last, has never been sighted since. Two
months ago The Call set forth reasons
for believing that the delayed schooner
with all on board had been lost. This
version seems to be substantiated by
the officers of the schooner Eliza Miller,
which has Just arried at Port Blakeley.
On June 23 Captain Christenson saw
the upturned hulk of a schooner float
ing 245 miles west of Coos Bay. This is
slightly west of the course of steam
ers plying between Seattle and San
Francisco. The keel was from 130 to
140 feet in length, perfectly straight
and newly coppered, with considerable
lead on the forefoot. Hall Brothers of
Port Blakeley, who owned and built the
Nomad, recognize the description as
the hull of their long missing vessel,
which was only built last August. A
tugboat will be sent out in search of
the wreck in a few days.
On board the Nomad were: Captain
John W. McAllep, his daughter and
two sons, from Seattle; First Mate C.
W. Soderstrom, Second Mate Charles
Looman, Cook Fred Holmes and Sea
men R. Visentine, R. Thompson and

Registration Progresses Slowly.
There has been a falling off in the reg
istration. When the Registrar's office
closed last night less than 10 per cent of
the voters of the city had registered. The
office is kept open until 9 o'clock every
evening to accommodate those who are
unable to get there in the daytime, but
few have availed themselves of the addi
tional facilities furnished them by Regis
trar Biggy. It is probable that many
voters do not know that the last registra
tion was cancelt-d June 1, and that all
citizens who desire to vote at the next
election will have to register again.

TO SCHLEY
Pettigrew's Resolution
of Thanks.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
SENATE PREFERS TO AWAIT
SAMPSON'S REPORT.
Stewart of Nevada Thinks tlie Rear
Admiral Was Unfortunate in
the Wording of the Jt irst
Announcement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 6.â ln the Sen
ate to-day Pettigrew of South Da
kota offered the following resolu
tion tendering the thanks of Co-n-
gxess to Commodore Schley for destroy
ing all Admiral Cervera's squadron and
asked that it be referred to the Com
mittee on Naval Affairs:
"Resolved, That the thanks of Con
gress and the American people are
hereby tendered to Commodore Win
field S. Schley of the United States
naval force operating against the Span
ish forces in Cuban waters for highly
distinguished conduct in conflict with
the enemy, as displayed by him in the
destruction of the Spanish fleet off the
harbor of Santiago, Cuba, July 3, 1898.
"Section 2â That the thanks of Con
gress and the American people are
hereby extended through Commodore
Schley to the officers and men under his
command for the gallantry and skill
exhibited by them on that occasion.
"Section 3â That the President of the
United States be requested *to cause
this resolution to be communicated to
Commodore Schley and through him to
the officers and men under his com
mand."
Commenting upon the resolution,
Pettigrew said the impression had been
conveyed to the public that "not Com
modore Schley but another man" had
achieved the great success.
"I know," declared he, "we sÂ«all be
obliged to remove that impression by
absolute proof to the contrary. All the
accounts of the battle agree that Com
modore Schley was in command of the
vessels of our fleet. He pursued the
last of the Spanish vessels sixty miles
and personally brought to an end
the most remarkable naval duel ever
fought."
Stewart of Nevada thought Admiral
Sampson had been unfortunate in the
wording of his official announcement of
the victory and in not giving in that
dispatch the credit due to Commodore
Schley. He thought it was due to
Schley that the credit be given him by
Sampson, but he believed the latter
would yet do Justice to the commo
dore.
Hale expressed great confidence in
the character and ability of Admiral
Sampson and Commodore Schley, and
said the conduct and achievements of
Schley during the historic battle had
been most admirable. He felt assured
that the little agitation concerning the
bestowal of credit which was now dis
turbing some minds would disappear in
the full light of the facts. There was,
he said, glory enough for all in the
destruction of Cervera's fleet, and he
had no doubt it would be properly dis
tributed.
Allen of Nebraska thought at least a
few days' delay ought to elapse before
action was taken upon the resolutio-n
and it was referred to the Naval Com
mittee.
At 5:05 o'clock the Senate went Into
executive session and at 6:15 p. m. ad
journed. _______________

HIS HEAD IN A SLING.
Mr. "White Hat" McCarthy Is Badly
Disfigured but Is Still in
the Bing.
While liie . ourth of July, with the news
of the annihilation of Cervera's fleet,
brought Joy to the hearts of millions of
patriotic American citizens, it over
whelmed a well-known citizen of San
Francisco â "White-hat" McCarthyâ in
deep trouble, nearly costing him his life.
Mr. McCarthy last evening appeared in
the court of the Palace Hotel with his
head in a sling. A white bandage, tied
around the back of his head and under
his chin, supported his jaw. A large
patch of court plaster ornamented the
bridge of his nose, and several spots, al
most as black as the court plaster, were
distributed over the balance of his coun
tenance. His customary trade markâ the
famous white hatâ was missing. It had
been lost in the shuffle, and had been re
placed by a slouch hat of a leaden hue,
similar to the war paint recently applied
to America's battleships.

THE PLAY OF
"HIT AND RUN"
Hard Baseball Problem
Explained.
SUBSTITUTE FOR SACRIFICE
ONLY A PLACE BATTER CAN DO
THE JOB.
A Scientific Nut for Star Players to
Crack When They Want Good
Practice â Its Great
Value.
BY JOE CORBETT.
I have been asked time and again why
batters, as a general rule, endeavor to
hit tn the direction of right field, after
a runner has been safely lodged on first
base. For the benellt of those who are
unfamiliar with this advanced method of
play, 1 will attempt to elucidate its prin
cipal point and the advantages derived
from its u.*e. I will also Live a little
advice â for you must know I make a
specialty of advising my contemporaries,
and this, by the way, I am told is the
bost thing I doâ regarding the correct
manner In which the play should be con
summated.
It Is known among baseball men, and
for that matter among those familiar
with It, as the hit and run. Its simplic
ity, no doubt, accounts for its name,
yet the play when attempted contains a
number of difficulties, which to most
batsmen, especially those not skilled in
the art of placing a ball, are hard to
overcome. The expression "hit and run"
Btgnifies that a man starts to steal a
base, and that the batter at the same
instant hits the ball. The idea I will en- '
deavur to convey in the following exam
ple: We will say, for illustration, that
there Is a runner on first base. How
should he attempt to pilfer the next
cushion? The instant he departs from
first either the shortstop or second base
man, whichever intends covering the bag,
will necessarily have to leave his posi
tion to intercept the throw from the
catcher which, as we are aware, is de
livered with the intention of heading off
the baserunner. in this particular ease
We will say that the second baseman
handled tbe threw from the catcher. In
so doing, he was compelled to leave his
position, as 1 mentioned above, and at
the same time leave a complete opening
between first and second bases. It is the
duty of the batter, therefore, if possible,
to hit the ball through that space left
uncovered by tho second baseman. If he
is successful, the baserunner continues
on to third, and he arrives snfely at the i
lnltla! bag with a base hit to his credit i
The play when properly made is most i
beatiful and scientific. It Is, however, at
tended with many difficulties, and Is, I
therefore, Beldom witnessed during play
at Recreation Park. With the batter
rests its entire success. He. on receiving
a sign from the runner, w.hich impli-s
I'm groins to steal, " must first discern
Win ther the shortstop or second baseman
Intends covering second, and in this h
very often fails. Afu-r satisfying himself!
on this very important point ho must ;
then direct the ball in that vicinity If 1
his conjectures are correct the play is
successful. If wrong it is a failure.
However, if he be in error in his con
jectures one success is assured; the
man that starts for second Invariably ar
rives at nit- dfstlnntion before an oppor
tunity is offered to retire him at that
base. This Is accounted for by the fact
that he starts to steal before the ball is
pitched, and consequently secures a lead
providing he is rjuick in carrying out his
part of the play, which should bring him
safely to second. Of course, if the batter
etrikes at the ball and misses, the play
thf-n reverts to its original stateâ a man
pilfering a base unassisted by the bat
terâand thf chances are in favor of his
being again retired. Then again, the bat
ter may hit the ball to the pitcher or to
one of the other inflelders on a lino, or
very hard, which is quite often the case,
and a double play results.
This misfortune, however, would not en
sue if a batter was careful not to swing
at the ball, us this style- of batting, es
pecially in scientific play 3, is dangerous
in the extreme.
1 have said rime and again that batters
should not swing at a ball, no matter
â what the situation, and permit me to em
phasize the fact that in attempting the
hit and run it Is almost suicide to re
sort to such tactics. I have seen the play
spoiled at Recreation Park at least fifty
times in this manner. This play, while
It may and does look simple, is a very dif
ficult proposition from the beginning. A
batter must first be capable of placing a
ball in either left or right field. This In
itself is an art attained only by unremit
ting practice and perseverence. He must
then acquire the equally difficult art of
picking out the right ball, because it Is
possible to place only certain balls.
It is useless for a right-hand batter to
try and place a ball on the inside corner
of the plate or close to him in right field,
and for a left-handed one to hit a simi
lar ball into left. It, of course, can bo
done, but with no results. What batters
should do in attempting this play In to
meet the ball, as snap hitters are the
only successful place batters.
If you have guessed which of tho two
men intend? taking the bag, a little
grounder of average speed is mII lint .6
rocer.Kary to complete the performance. I
As Uhji in no one close enough to in
tercept this grounder before it Is van
quished by the elders, why swing at the
ball and endanger the success of the play
â when a simple little tap will have >.ne
name effect? Then, again, let us say
that your supposition regarding the man
â who is to take the bag terminated disas
trously, or, in other words, that you
thought the shortstop was going to cover,
and in consequence, hit the ball in that
direction: but, instead, the second base
man took the base. Now, If you swung
at the ball and.it so happened that It
was hit hard, which generally is the
case, or near it, the chances of your as
sisting the opposite side in the comple
tion of a double -May are quite favor
able.
But, on the other hand, if you simply
met the ball and an easy hit resulted,
â while you undoubtedly would be retired
at first, keen consolation would , follow
the fact that you advanced the 'runner
to second base. Your easy hit, there
fore, if unsuccessful, terminates In a sac
rifice.
.The hit and run is the latest scientific
acquisition to the national game. It is
much more advantageous than the sac
rifice game; in fact, it is so far superior
that there Is no comparison.' Sacrificing,
however, is not entirely done away with,
and it is a much better and safer game
to play for those players who are not
proficient in place hitting. I will con
clude by reiterating a past statementâ
that snapping or meeting the ball is the
ecientific manner of batting, and without
this art players need never hope to en
gage In scientific plays to any extent, for
It would be almost impossible to do â  so
successfully.
HANGED HIMSELF.
A Chinese Prisoner Preferred Death
to Deportation by the Federal
Authorities.
Wong Look, a Chinese prisoner In the
County Jail, hanged himself yesterday
afternoon in his cell. He made a rope of
the lining taken out of the back of his
vest and fastened it to the grating In his
wicket. He was dead and cold when
found by one of the prison guards.
The deceased wad been awaiting trial in
the Federal Court on a charge of being*
Illegally In this country, having no cer
tificate of registration. He had recently
completed a long term of imprisonment
In the penitentiary at San Quentin for
burglary, and was arrested by the United
BtatPS Marshal on his discharge. He
would have been deported In a few days.

STATE'S VETERAN GUARDSMAN DEAD
Louis fl. Townsend, Architect and Soldier, Peace
fully Passes Away.
California's Veteran National Guardsman, Louis R. Townsend, is dead.
He passed away while reclining in a chair at his residence, 1164 HaJght
street, yesterday.
ile was beloved by every member of his regiment â the First Infantry,
whffh is now in Manila, where he might have been but for old age. His repu
tation ai a soldier was equal to his fame as an architect. As the designer
of Lotta's fountain, the decaying castle on Telegraph Tlill and many other
famous buildings in this city, he held a high place in his chosen profession.
Although 67 years of age, he was still a member of the National Guard.
He declined office time and again, caring more to be with his comrades in
the ranks. The position of lieutenant was thrust upon him many years ago,
and as there was no chance to refuse he had to accept the position. He,
however, only acted as such one term, when, at his earnest solicitation, he
wa-s again allowed to take his old position. As Corporal "Lew" Townsend
he was known throughout the State, and as such he always wished to be.
He was an expert with the rifle, and almost always l<-d competitors, carry
ing off many hundred medals. Despite his years, lie marched in parades and
was rarely absent from drill.
During the past year he suffered from asthma, brought on by being over
heated at the Sacramento strike. He was a member of the firm of Townsend
& Wyneken, architects. He leaves a daughter, Miss li. Townsend, who is
now on a visit to New York. His body now lies at lialstead's undertaking
establishment, from which place he will probably be interred under the aus
pices of fellow guardsmen who were left behind.
The deceased's record in the militia is unusually interesting. He en
listed on May 4. IKT.4. and was in active service forty-four years and five
months. Number of drills attended, 1771; number of parades, 443; number of
miles marched, 3106; number of encampments, 14; number of riots, 4. His
shooting from 1890 to the present year averaged from 43 to 48 out of a pos
sible 50.
SAN JOSEANS
ARE IN REVOLT
Bossism Is Becoming;
Intolerable.
WRECKING A HIGH SCHOOL
â 
STUDENTS WILL NOT RETURN
NEXT TERM.
Indignation Over the Ousting of Pro
fessor Smith and Mrs.
Clement Has Not
Abated.
Special Dippatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 6.â The action of the
City Board of Education last night is j
but the beginning of what promises to j
be a sensational turn in school affairs, j
The dismissal of Professor Smith from j
the High School and the election of
Charles B. Gleason as his successor has
proved to be the stirring up of a hor
net's nest. The abolishing of the office
of Deputy Superintendent of Schools
because Mrs. A. B. Clement refused to
give up her office to Miss Irene Han
kenson, who had been illegally elected,
shows how the "gang" will vent its
spite.
These were the sole topics discussed
In most of the homes to-day. The mat
ter of holding a mass-meeting to pro
test against these insolent acts of the
Trustees was discussed by a number of
Influential people. While Trustees
Wemple, Kenyon, Graham, Langford
and O'Neil were strongly denounced
Graham came in for the lion's share of
criticism. He is the tool of Rea and he |
it was who engineered the shameful
work done last night. From the very
beginning of the school trouble he has
bragged that Smith would never be re-
Instated and on several occasions he
j has offered to wager money on the
proposition.
Back of the trustees In their despica
ble action was the "gang's" organ, the
Mercury, which has aided in every
manner possible to defeat the wish of
the people. Instead of making a fight
for Smith and what was right it has
remained quiet.
The High School faculty Is the prime
cause of Professor Smith's discharge.
Petty Jealousy among the other teach
ers in that school has militated against
Smith, und in the last month the jeal
ous ones have been hard at work to
down him. Foremost in the lot is A.
E. Shumate, principal of the school.
While posing as a friend of Smith he
has been urging the board on and was
instrumental in bringing Gleason here.
For some time there have been ru
mors that all was not .going right at
the High School and a number of citi
zens, it is asserted, will demand an in
vestigation.
The Union Battlefield Veterans are
receiving bitter condemnation. They
first claimed Smith was unpatriotic and
had spoken disparagingly of General
THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 7, 1898.
Grant. For this they were denounced
by the Grand Army posts of the city.
The leaders of this gang-controlled or
ganization, W. J. VVollcott and Major
Starok, are political tricksters, who do
the bidding of "Boss" Kea among the
old soldiers.
In all probability Professor Smith
will start a private school. Last week
he had applications from over 150 of
his old pupilg. When the Board of
Education failed to re-elect Smith the
s-tudents of the High School voted
unanimously not to attend school next
term unless Professor Smith was re
instated. Since then they have repeated
this vow, and the majority of parents
have expressed themselves in sym
pathy with their children. Influential
people are taking up Smith's light and
the action of the board last night is
but the beginning of a struggle be
tween the better people and the "gang"
which has been running school affairs
to reward Its friends and punish its
enemies.
During th.j past year the condition
of affairs in the School Board has gone
from bad to worse. Superintendent
Russell's annual report shows that "a
financial crisis has now been reached.
The expenditures â teachers' salaries,
etc. â contracted for the ensuing year
amount to $130,922, while the receipts
for that year will only amount to $81.
899. This will leave a deficiency of
$49,020 to be raised by city taxes. A
levy of IS cents, same as last year, will
raise but $28,800, and on June 30. 1599,
there will be a deficiency of $20,220.
Statutes prohibit the expenditure of
more money in any one year than
raised in that year for that purpose,
and it will be impossible to raise money
by taxes. The apportionment of $15,000
for July. 1899, might be used, and yet
the department would be expending
$5000 more than the law allows, and at
the end of the year be $4000 worse off.
The July apportionment is for main
taining grammar and primary grades,
and if that is used teachers would have
j to wait until December for their salar
ies. Before allowing another claim the
board should make a cut of from $10,000
to $15,000 in annual expenses."
It was shown that from $12,000 to
$15,000 would be needed to finish and
furnish the new High School, while
there is only $1471 in the board fund
available. A 2-cent levy would raise
sufficient funds to furnish part of the
building so it could be used for school
purposes. â¢
This condition has been brought
| about by the old board, of which Trus
tees Graham, Wemple and Kenyon
were members. Yet In spite of this
the board has elected Miss MacKenzle
i Supervisor of Kindergartens at a sal
i ary of $75 a month and other unneces
sary expenditures have been made. The
position created for Miss MacKenzle is
purely a sinecure and not needed, as
there are only seven kindergartens and
seventeen teachers.
Another unnecessary expense, and
one that has been the means of mulct
ing the city in the sum of over $1000,
' is that of supplying the school house
| windows with "Model" hinges. This
! was done at the instance of Trustee
Graham. The "Model Hinge Company"
is composed of Police Commissioner
| Carmich.iel and other politicians. Dur
; ing the past year the hinges have been
I put into school buildings at a cost of
j $7R7, or $1 50 a set. These same poli
j ticians had the same hinge included tn
the new High School specifications
thus adding over $500 additionaf cost to
the building.

WASHINGTON. July fi.-In the Senate
to-day Frye of Maine reported frnm the
Committee on Commerce a bill granting

tania, owned by John Rosenfeld & Sons
of San Francisco. The bill, which con

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Chronic Eczema spread all over my bead.
I had two doctors and tried lotions, but re-
ceived little benefit. The dreadful itchiug.
became almost intolerable, and when I was
boated, the Eczema became painful, and
almost distracted me. Tried Cuticcra Rem-
edies, the Eczema rapidly disappeared, and I
am well Kith no trace any cutaneous disease.
J. EMMETT REEVES,
Feb. 22, '98. Box 125, Thorntown, Ind.
Was afflicted with an itching rash all over
my body. I could not plcep, but was com-
pelled to lie awako and scratch all the time.
My father and two brothers were afflicted with
the same thing. We all suffered terribly for
a year and a half. Three cakes of Coticdra
Soap and three boxes of Ccticuba (ointment)
cured the four of us completely.
Feb. 22 ,1898. RICHARD ANDERSON.
Geneva, Box Elder Co., Utah.
My hands were completely covered with
Eczema, and between my fingers the skin was
perfectly raw. I could get no case night or
day. I was in a rage of itching. My husband
bad to dress and undress me like a baby.
The best physicians' medicines gave me no
relief, and drove mo almost crazy. I used
the Coticoua (ointment), and five minutes
after the first application I teas perfectly easy,
and slept soundly all that night, and I have not
had the Eczema in two years.

JOURNALISM
Denounces Examiner

Stirring Address on " Lessons
From the War" to the
Catholic Truth
Society.
Rev. Father Yorke delivered an address
last night in St. Mary's Cathedral to the
Catholic Truth Society, on lessons from
the war, during which he took occasion
to vigorously denounce yellow journal
ism, and paid particular attention to the
Examiner and Bulletin.
The sacred edifice was crowded, and
among the congregation were a number
of soldiers from Camp Merritt.
The reverend father said he would
speak on lessons which may be drawn
from the present war with Spain, to
Catholics as citizens of the common
wealth and to the Catholic church. He
referred to the difference In the tone and
temper of the people after the wars of
the past, and said there would be the
same changes after the present war was
over. AYe v.a not see these changes, as
we were actors in them, but they would
be realized fully by those coming after
us.
Spain, i,e said, was not a Catholic coun
try, although it was a country win-re the
Catholic religion was almost exclusively
professed. Jm- instanced the difference, I
and pointed uut that lor the past 100 years
Spain had been run on principles entirely
inimical to the Catholic church. He
blamed the introduction of Freemasonry
into the country as the cause for this
chance, as it was well known that that
organisation was hostile to the church.
Protestant ministers had been preach
ing that the war with Spain was a su
preme struggle between Protestantism '
and Catholicism, which was an inlamoua !
lie. une-third of the soldiers that had I
offered their services to right the battles
Of their country were Catholics, and }
therefore he repeated that it was an in- j
famous lie to assert that this was a Pro- |
testant war.
They might expect that treatment from
Protestant preachers but they had a right
to expect different treatment from the
newspapers. In last Sunday's yellow sup
plement of one of the morning papers,
the San Francisco Examiner, the Catho
lic church wa.s symbolized as the devil
with the usual horns and hoofs.
Raising his voice the reverend Father
said: "You are not bound as Catholic men
and women to lake that paper into your
homes and have your children scandalized
by such pictures and such lmfamous lies
propagated about your church."
Continuing he said: "An evening paper,
the Bulletin, also contained an article
written by Henry C. Lee, asserting that
the Catholic church was the cause of the
decadence of Spain an# no reason was
given for the assertion except the ipse
dixit of an Ignoramus."
He praised the work of the Catholic
women who had ministered to the moral

and material welfare of the soldiers at
(amp Merritt. At first they were refused
permission to carry on their noble work
and it required a strung remonstrance to
the proper authorities before Catholic pnl
dlors were permitted to worship God ac
cording to the dictates of their own con
science. In this connection he took occa
sion to protest against the appointment of
Protestant ministers to all the regiments.
Hut he supposed it was the first chance
they had of getting a salary from Hncle
Sam and they were eager to grasp it.
The one great lesson to be drawn from
the war was that it was not a Protestant
war and if Catholics would bury thf^ir per
sonal jealousies and stand united no
Protestant preacher and no newspaper
would dare to claim that it was a Protes
tant war or that this was a Protestant
country.
THE TURNERBUND'S
SECOND SESSION
1 PATRIOTIC SENTIMENTS OF A
COMMITTEE REPORT.
The Delegates See Chinatown by Gas
light Under Police Protection
and Enjoy Themselves.
The second day's session of the North
American Turnerbund was hokl yesterday
at Turn Verein Hall, on Turk street, the
new president, Emil. "Wallber, presiding.
The members of the bund displayed
their patriotism shortly before the ad
journment of the forenoon session, when
G. Donald of lowa had concluded the
reading of a report of the executive com
mittee. Mr. Donald spoke of the attitude
of the turners toward their country,
America, and of America's war with
Spain. The turners were Americans, he
said, and with them their rallying cry
was now, "One flag, one country, one
honor." A few more rousing sentiments
were expressed by other members, all
breathing loyalty and patriotism as
against any and all European nations.
Thore was a good-natured fight on be
tween the friends who favored Chicago
and the supporters of Indianapolis as the
place in which to maintain the head of
fices of the Turnerbund. St. Louis has
been the headquarters of the union for
many years, and both Chicago and In
dianapolis are united in the belief that it
is time for a change.
The affairs of the bund pending the next
j meeting will be attended to by the Turn
Vereins in Indlanapous. By a vote of 254
'â  to 100 Philadelphia won against Chicago
; as the place where the next bund will be
held in 1900.
The German-American Turnzeltung of
Milwaukee has been again selected as the
official organ of the bund.
The question of paying off the deficit of
> $3500. which was incurred in Milwaukee
four years ago, occupied the attention of
, the convention some time. It was finally
! decided to levy an assessment of 5 cents
j per capita on the members, which will
more than meet the demand.
The manner of conducting the summer
! school and the number of pupils which
I would justify the formation of a class
; was debated on and it was finally decided
| that the school should be maintained.
J. T. Hill as a Defendant.
Judgment was rendered yesterday morn
ing by Judge Belcher in favor of the Hi
bernia Bank for the foreclosure of a
mortgage issued by John T. Hill, the well
known capitalist, to secure a note of $250,
000. The mortgage, which was executed
October 15, 1894, covered sixteen pieces of
real estate in this city. The principal and
interest now amount to $279,814 03, for
which sum judgment was given. The suit
was allowed to go by default, no contest
to the claim of the bank being made.
Electric Railway Company Sued.
Suit was filed yesterday by Mabel
Dougherty, tnrough her guardian, against
the San Francisco and San Mateo Elec
tric Railway Company, to recover $1000
damages for personal Injuries received
on March 12 last. Miss Dougherty was
run into and severely Injured by one of
the cars of the defendant corporation,
and she alleges that negligence on the
part of the motorman caused the acci
dent.

The receipts of the Internal Revenue
I Collector's office yesterday for stamps
! and licenses were, in round numbers, $30,
i 000.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
in Washington is kept busy interpreting
disputed points of law, and is daily send
ing forth bulletins for the information
of Collectors and the business public. The
following were received by Mr. Lynch
yesterday:
The following rules and regulations have been
issued by the Commissioner of Internal Reve
nue relating to tax on legacies and distributive
shares, under the war revenue bill:
The tax on legacies and distributive shares
w personal property accrues where passing
irom any person dying on or after June 13,
1890.
The law does not apply to estates now In
process of settlement, when the grantor died
before June 13, lSiiS.
The tax must be paid on a legacy before Its
distribution to the legatees.
No tax is due unless the whole amount of
said personal property passing from the dece
dent exceeds In value $10,000.
The fact that certain distributive shares aris
ing from the personal property of an estate
are represented by bonds of the United States
does DOt cnnstitut" ground tor holding such
â hares to ho exempt from tax on legacies and
distributive shares under the internal revenue
laws.
In all cases where legacy taxes are due the ;
executors, administrators or trustee should be j
immediately ncititip.l to make return. These I
rpturns should be made In duplicate. One copy
should be filed in the office of tho Collector !
and the other should be transmitted to this
office. Upon payment of the tax the Collector
or deputy colkctor will give a receipt or re
ceipts for the same In duplicate. If the Col- !
lector finds It necessary, in order to obtain the i
facts respecting liability to legacy taxes where !
the records are insufficient, he tan exercise the
authority vested In him and may summon the I
executors, administrators or other persons he
may deem proper to appear and testify under
oath.
TREASURY DEPARTMENT,
WASHINGTON, D. C. June 23, IS9B.
Sir: In reply to the several questions sub
mitted in your letter of the 14th instant, ad
dressed to Senator Teller, you are hereby ad
vised as follows:
Mining stock brokers and also persons doing
a purely speculative business In mining stocks.
strictly on their own account, doing no com
mission business whatever, are, in the opinion
of this office, subject to the tax of $50, if, as
It is understood, they are engaged in nego
tiating purchases or sales of stock "for them
selves."
Mining companies which, as you state, are
capitalized at from 1,000,000 to 2. 500.000 and
3,000,000 shares of a par value of $1 each, and
whose stock is selling at from 50 cents to $2 and
$3 per 1000 shares, are required to affix and
cancel a 5-cent stamp to every certificate of
this stock originally issued on or after July 1,
ÃBS, even though its face value is but $1.
On every transfer of a certificate of stock a
broker delivering the certificate should affix
thereto and cancel a 2-cent stamp, In accord
ance with the provisions of schedule A of the
act of June 13, IS9B.

CABLE TO THE
FARALLON ISLANDS
CONGRESS TO BE ASKED FOR AN
APPROPRIATION.
Secretary Wilson Says That Sixty
Thousand Will Be Sufficient to
Construct a Line.
There is every prospect that before very
lonp the Farallon Islands will be connect
ed with this city by a submarine cable.
Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber of
Commerce, yesterday received a letter
from Senator Perkins inclosing a commu
nication from James Wilson, secretary of
the Bureau of Agriculture, which is as
follows:
My Dear Senator: Replying to your letter of
recent date, transmittinK resolutions adopted
by the California Chamber of Commerce, pe
titioning ior the establishing and maintaining
of a telegraph-cable line from San Francisco
to the Farallon Islands. I have the honor to
Inform you that the matter was referred to
the chief of the Weather Bureau for Investiga
tion and full report. That official states that
such a line would be of some value to thw
forecaster in predicting weather changes, al
though it would not be nearly so valuable for
this purpose as the meteorological station now
being erected on Mount Tamalpais. Its chief
utility from a meteorological standpoint would
be in forecasting the fogs that move in from
the ocean. The marine and commercial intet
ests of San Francisco would derive the great
est value from such a line. Vessels coming
from the north, south and west could be sight
ed from the Farallon Islands many hours be
fore they reached San Francisco. Often ves
sels are becalmed off the islands, sometimes for
a period of a week. With telegraphic Infor
mation direct to San Francisco delays of this
kind would be obviated, as assistance could
be called for from San Francisco and the be
calmed vessels towed Into that port. Besides.

IF If Market, Jones ml McAllister Sts., /
\r \^ San Franriico. f
many Instances are on rpmrd of vessels with
valuable cargoes being wrecked on the rock*
In the vicinity of these islands. In Filch cases
the value of a cable line to San Francisco
would be incalculable. During war with an
other country a hostile fle^t might be report
ed from the islands in time to prepare fo%
defense. The life saving service could also
make good use of such a cable in connection
with their station already established on the
Farallon Islands. It will thus be seen that
a cable from San Francisco to these islands
would be of great benefit. The distance is
about thirty miles, and the cost nf constructing
and establishing such a cable would be about
J.Sn.OOO. A house would be required on the isl
ands for the use of the observers and operators,
which would cost about J3WK). The mainten
ance of the station, and the salary of the nec
essary observers, operators, and labor would
roriulre about $3000 per annum. An appro
priation of $r.o.<w would be sufficient for all the
J'iirposeÃ named, and other incidentals. Very
truly yours. JAMES WILSON, Secretary.
Mr. Craig at once sent the annexed re
ply to the Senator urging him to hasten
the appropriation of the money for the
cable:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.. July 6, 1898.
Hon. George C. Perkins, United States Sen
ator, Washington, D. C: San Francisco mer
chants, ship owners and indeed the whole State
would feel immensely gratified if the appro
priation iif $60,000 for cable to Farallones, re
commended by Secretary Wilson, was secured
before Congress adjourns. We have willingly
given to the administration our coast protec
tors and feel sure you will make special efforts
to secure for us this small boon of a cable to
the Farallones to be made immediately avail
able. HUGH CRAIG.

cisco.

The cost to Spain of the Cuban war
from February, 1895, to the end of 1897
is officially estimated at $240,000,000, be
sides the arrears due from the Cuban
