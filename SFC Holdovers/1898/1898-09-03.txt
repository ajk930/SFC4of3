PARIS, Sept. 1.-^The most pessimistic feelings exist. It Is the i
common belief that Great Britain and Russia are on the eve of war
and that the consequences of the Dreyfus scandal -will Involve
France in war with Germany.
High officers confess that the discussions that will follow revision
will probably entail war. but they say that would be preferable to

convinced most of tho.se. still Wavering..
In fact, the. general impression is that
the whole truth .has hot. been told. Al
most. the whole French â  press and
people are clamoring for. more light.
M. Cavalgnac, in fact, sums up the'
Bituation . in a telegraphed editorial to
the Autor ; ite. in which he says: â¢ .
"PuWic opinion insists that the naked
truth shall be dragged out of her well."
There :e no denying that xhe whole

Th>> change in public opinion! is suf
ficiently Indicated by the attitude of

NEW YORK, Sept. 2.â A special to the World from Wash

commanding the Seventh California Volunteer Regiment,
made the remark thaf'Alger is a d-d small man," It Is
likely be will be court-martialed, He Is within tho Juris

celve Colonel Schwarzkoppen himself,
who even when he became aware of it,
was unable to denounce i* owing to
the introduction of certain names.
M. de Blowitz arrives at this conclu
sion: "It is absolutely impossible that
Lieutenant Colonel Henry should have
attained the necessary professional
dexterity. The actual forger, therefore,
must be sought elsewhere, though it is
likely enough that Henry concocted the
phrases. Discovery would not be diffi
cult and would elicit the whole truth."
MORE FORGERIES
MAY BE EXPECTED
There Is No Telling Where
the Fraudulent Work
Was Carrie i Out.
Col. Henry Evidently Thought
Dreyfus Was Convicted on
Very FMmsy Evidence.
NEW YORK, Sept. 2.â A dispatch to
the Tribune from Paris says: Colonel
Henry's confession of forging the fa
mous document, upon the authenticity
of which General de Bolsdeffre, chief
of staff of the French army, in his im
passioned appeal to the Jury In the
Zola trial staked his own reputation
and the honor of the army, and Colonel
Henry's suicide in the fortress of Mont
Valerien have caused aji emotion
throughout France which has not been
witnessed since the fall of Sedan.
Colonel Henry a peasant's son, pro
moted from the ranks and Imbued with
all the instincts and low cunning and
narrow- personal animosity often char
acteristic of French peasants, had no
conception of the enormity of his crime
until overwhelmed by its detection.
This brave but infatuated chief of the
Intelligence Department of the French
army embodied the whole head and
front of Dreyfus' conviction, of Zola's
condemnation, of Esterhazy's acquittal
and of Picquart's degradation and im
prisonment.
Although the document which Col
onel Henry forged in 1896 cannot tech
nically have any effect on the Dreyfus
j trial, which took place in 1894, it is,
. nevertheless, with consternation that
j t"-day people ar<^ asking what sort of
evidence could Dreyfus have been con
victed on, if, in the Judgment of Col
onel Henry, It was so flimsy that he
thought it could not stand Investigation
without being propped up by official
forgery.
M. Cavaignac. the Minister of War,
I in his memorable speech in the Cham
ber on July 7, based his declaration
upon the authenticity of this formal
document, which was printed and
posted on the wallÃ throughout France.
After conversing with representative
Frenchmen of every class, and after
mixing with excited groups in the
i streets and cafes, it Is evident to an
. observer that the popular tide is at
] last turning in favor of a revision of
! the Dreyfus trial, no matter what the
j consequences may be. It is significant
! that such newspapers as the Gaulots,
I the Echo de Paris and Journals which
i are known to be in close touch with
the army now declare that the feeling
of military men is out and out for ro
vislon of the court-martial, and that
many prominent officers insist that it
is the honor of the army Itself which
necessitates such revision.
General de Bolsdeffre, who made the
monstrous threat to resign with the
whole t _neial staff of the army if Zola
was acquitted, has now, by his resig
nation, admitted that lie was the blind
dupe of a forger.
This inspires grave anxiety as to
whether or not the general staff has
been duped in other mattersâ that of
national defense, for instance.
Henri Rochefort, whn still cham
pions the validity of Dreyfus' condem
nation, is authority for the statement
that all the officers of the French gen
eral staff employed in Paris hav e ap
plied to be relieved of their present
duties and sent back to their respective
regiments.

RUMORS THAT COLONEL
HENRY WAS MURDERED.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 180S, by .Tames Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Sept. 2. â Among the many wild rumors flying about to-day is one that
seems too incredible to merit even notice, did it not show the state of the public mind.
This is the belief that Colonel Henry did not commit suicide. The Figaro to-day says that
when the Commissary of Police arrived at Mont Valerien he asked for Colonel Henry's
valise and the razor with which he committed suicide. He was told they had both been sent
to the Minister of War. Naturally, such a detail as a razor being sent to the Minister of
War makes many people ask why.
The Eclaire, referring to this matter, says: "This controversy has shown us long ago
to what depths certain individuals can descend, so we were not surprised to read that the sui
cide of Colonel Henry was perhaps a murder."

to expert test to ascertain whether any
more forgeries exist. There is every
Indication that the army and people
now demand that the prisoner on
Devil's Island shall have a new and
fair trial, but this cannot take place
for many months.
The movement in favor of a revision
of the Dreyfus case is growing stronger
in the napers which, until now, have
been hostile to the nrisoner of Devil's
Island.
OFFICERS WHO
ARE INDIGNANT
Threaten to Resign and
Force the Government
to Act.
General Pellfeux Is Furious at
Being Deceived and Speaks
With Brutal Frankness.
PARIS, Sept. 2.â Midnightâ lt is now
said that the Chamber of Deputies will
not assemble until October, by which
time it is hoped the storm will have
blown over.
Several officers of the highest dis
tinction, it is alleged, threaten to re
sign their commissions and to publish
the facts In order to force the Govern
ment to act. Among the crowd of
speculations and alleged revelations,
however, little that 1h actually new has
been disclosed. General Pellieux is
furious at having been deceived. He
says that during the Zola trial he re
ceived a letter lrom a juryman, beg
ging him for proof of the guilt of
Dreyfus. He learned elsewhere that
the jury wanted the report of Captain
Lebrun-Renaud, who Is credited with
having received a confession from
Dreyfus.
All of General Pellieux's demands
upon the Government failed to get any
thing but Colonel Henry's fnt-ired let
ter, which he (Fellieux) took on trust.
In his anger at this base ueceptlon.
General Pellieux has now written to the
Governor of Paris, asking with brutal
frankness to be placed on the retired
list, as he does not wish to be mixed up
with "men lacking all sense of honor."
MAJORITY OF CABINET
FAVORS A REVISION
PARIS, Sept. 2.â lt is said to-night that M. Brisson has given in
his adhesion to a formal revision of the rase. He is reported to be
urging a fresh trial. In this he has a majority of the Cabinet at his
back, always excepting M. Cavaignac, who remains as firmly con
vinced that Dreyfu6 is guilty, just as he was certain the document
forged by Colonel Henry was genuine. Of course, neither M. Brisson
nor his followers in the question of revision profess any doubt about
Dreyfus' culpability. On the contrary they claim to believe he will be
proved a traitor. This action on their part Is prob-.bly more Judicious
than sincere. There is a stubborn spirit abroad. Ey mere force of
facts many have been brought to believe in the illeKality of the trial
of 1894, but from this to admitting Dreyfus is innocent is a far cry.
The revisionists therefore do well to base their demands for a new
trial simply on the ground of judicial informality, and not on that of
the condemned man's innocence.
The Governor has begged him to recon
sider his decision.
M. de Pressense, a member of the
Chi. nber of Deputies and foreign edi
tor of the Temps, is organizing meet
ings throughout the country in favor of
revision.
M. Zola remains in hiding, but he has
written a letter of congratulation to
Madame Dreyfus.
Colonel Picquart Implores Maitre
Labbori, who was counsel for Zola in
his recent trial, to cease efforts to ob
tain his (Plcquart's) freedor... as he

when he will be liberated and can face
his accusers. Madame Dreyfus so far
has taken no action.
GERMANY'S SECOND
WARNING CAUSED SEARCH
NEW YORK, Sept. 2.â A special
cable to the Sun from Paris says:
About a month ago the continued
gibes of the French anti-Dreyfus press
led Colonel Schwarzkoppsn, formerly
German military attache at Paris, to
make a personal appeal to the German
Emperor to check the persistent at
tacks upon him. Colonel Bchwarskop
pen again assured the Emperor on his
honor as a soldier that he never knew
Dreyfus and never had any dealing's
with him while In Paris. The letter
â¢which it is alleged Colonel Panizzardi,
Italian military attache in Paris, had
written to him mentioning Dreyfus by
name was. Colonel Schwarzkoppen as
sured his sovereign, a forgery-
In response to this appeal Emperor
William Instructed Chancellor yon Ho
benlohe again to inform the French
Government of these facts, and to in
sist that the continued repetition of the
columny in France must cease. Count
yon Muensier, German Embassador to
France, returned specially to Paris on
August 10 and delivered the foregoing
message to M. de Lease. Minister of
Foreign Affairs. The latter informed
President Faure, M. Brisson, the Prime
Minister, and M. Cv.utiguse of the mes
sage. It was this second warning
from Germany that led M. Cavaignac
once more to search for all the docu
ments relating to the Dreyfus case.

after M. Cavaignac's long interview
with M. Sarrien both Ministers looked
ruffled. These and other Impromptu
Ministerial conferences were devoted to
an endeavor to convince the Mi/njster

grounds of a revision of the Dreyfus
case, which the whole country, includ

N. V.. Sept. 2.â Major General Joseph
Wheeler pave the following to the As
sociated Press to-day:
HEADQUARTEKS UNITED STATES
FORCES. Camp Wikoff. L. 1., Sept. I.â
The following is a sample of the letters
â we are constantly, receiving regarding the
soldiers in 'the camp: :
"In repard to my stepson, we feel very
uneasy about him on account of the
newspaper reports of the privation and
fiiilTormg inflicted on the private soldiers.
Although he. has ' never uttered a com
plaint, since he has been in the army, we
hear from other sources of the cruel and
horrible treatment inflicted upon our sol
diers under the pretense of humanity, for
our neighbors and the whole country are
In.' a state of terrible excitement. I
should not. be surprised -if the feeling
should lead to a revolution of some kind,
for I assure you I hoar on all sides the
most violent' and bitter denunciations of
the War Department and the administra
tion.- It is' lndeed a great pity that the
glory of our triumphs should be dimmed
by such a shameful thing as the ill-treat
ment and starvation of our own brave
soldiers, while the Spanish prisoners have
the best treatment that the country can
afford. 1 '
. It will be seen that this letter says that
not a word of complaint has been re
ceived from .this soldier, and so far as
my investigation goes no complaint has
been made by any of the brave soldiers
that have added glory to our arms in the
Cuban campaign. A great many anxious
-fathers, .mothers, brothers or sisters ar
rive here from all parts of the United
States to- look .after their relatives, who,
th^y say the papers tell them, are suffer
ing, and many' of them have heard that
their relatives, are In. a condition of
starvation.
â¢ Most of.' these people are little able to
expend the money for such a .lourney,and
they, are surprised when they come here
to find thpir relatives surrounded by
everything to eat which can be procured
with money, and. if sick In the hospital,
they are gratified and surprised to find
that they are given every possible care.
In reply to a direct request that I give
the exact facts as I see them, I will
state: â 
.. Every officer and soldier who went to
Cuba regarded that he Mas given a great
privilege to. engage In that campaign.
They knew they were to encounter yellow
fever and .other diseases as well as the
torrid heat of the country, and they were
proud and glad. to do so. They knew that
It was: impossible for them to have the
advantage Of wagon transportation which
usually accompanies an army, and yet
officers, and men were glad to go, to carry
their blankets and their rations on their
backs and- to be subjected, without any
shelter: to the sun and rains by day and
the heavy hazes by night. They certain
ly knew that the Spaniards had spent
years in erecting defenses, and it was
their pleasure, to .assault and their duty
to capture the Spanish works.
They were more than glad to Incur the
â¢hardships, and the dangers. They went
thereand did their duty, each man seem
ing to feel that American honor and pres
tige wag to be measured by his conduct.
The' brave, men , -Who won the victories
did not -.complain of the neglect of the
. Govern men-t, but on the contrary they
seemed grateful to the President and the
Secretary of War for giving them the
opportunity, to incur these dangers and
hardships. They realized that in the hur
â  rlqd organization .of an expedition by a
Government which had no. one with any
experience in such. matters it was impos
sible to have everything arranged to per
fection; and- they will testify that under
â¢the circumstances the conditions were
much nearer perfect than any one would
have rea.se n to expect, and that the.Presi
dent and Secretary of War ar^ others
who' planned and dispatched thesf expedi
' tlons deserve high commendation.
One;reason why our army was lacking
.in' some respects In equipage was that
.a- tflegram. was received- from Admiral
Sampson -stating that- if the army re
â ported. there Immediately It could take
the city at once, but if there should be
delay -.the fortifications of the Spaniards
would-, be so perfected that there might
be great difficulty in taking It.
On receiving this dispatch from Admi
ral Sampson the War Department di
rected the army to move at once, and,
as all connected with the army will re
call, the orders were received after dark
and the army was in motion, had trav
eled nine miles and was on the ships at_
daylight.' When : ihe expedition sailed for
Cuba it went .there escorted by a large
lleetof warships: : .
At that time ft was regarded an Im
possible-for a merchant ship to sail on
the ocean safely from any American port
to Santiago, .but. as soon as the Spanish
fleet; was destroyed so that it was pos
sible 'for unarmed ships to sail safely to
Santiago, the generous people of the Uni
' ted States subscribed money without lim
it and dispatched ship after ship loaded
with luxuries and delicacies for the San
tiago army, and everything that could
be accomplished for their comfort was
done by the President and Secretary of
War.
After the surrender had complet
ed and arrangements were perfected for
transporting the Spanish army to Spain,
the President and Secretary of War sent
shipping to Santiago and transported our
army to one of the most healthful loca
tions in .the United States. The point
selected by the Secretary of War was so
situated that thorough protection was
given the people of the United States
irom the danger of yellow fever con
tagion.
The soldiers upon their arrival at this
plr.ee received every care and bounty
which could be procured by money. The
iTosident and the Secretary of War <M
re?*ed that their health and comfort
should be cared for without reference to
expense, and in addition the peo
ple withir a circle of a hundred m!le3
vied with each other in shipping to them
car loads and steamboat loads of luxu
rieÃ of all kinds.
I have just finished ray daily inspec
tion- cf tbe hospitals. With rare oxceD
'i .us the sick are cheerful and improv
ing. I 1 aye nurses and doctors to caro
: them, and in all my many tourÂ«Â» I
have not found a single patient who
r>.;irle the slightest complaint. It is true
there has been suffering, and great suf
fering. The climate of Cuba was very
severe upon all our soldiers, but instead
of complaining, the hearts of those brave
men are filled with gratitude to the peo
ple for the bounteous generosity which
has been extended to them.
There is no doubt that there have been
Individual cases of suffering and possibly
neglect among soldiers not only In Cuba
but since their arrival at this place.
Nearly 20.000 men were brought from a
yellow fever district to the United States.
It would have been criminal to have land
ed them and allowed them to go promis
cuously among the people. It has been
stated by physicians that if it had been
done yellow fever would have spread
through many of our States.
To avoid such a catastrophe a point
which is more thoroughly Isolated from
the people than any other locality which
could be found was selected. By this
wise means the country has been saved
from a scourge oi this fearful disease.
Every one will realize that to land IS.OOO
men and put them on bare fields without
any buildings whatever could not be done
without some hardships. Over 5000 very
sick men have been received in the gen
eral hospital and as many more sick have
been cared for in the camps and yet only
about sixty deaths have occurred in those
hospitals.
Tents had to be erected and hospitals
constructed and preparations made to
supply those 18,000 men with wholesome
water, food, medicines, physicians,
nurses, cooks, hospital furniture, wagons,
ambulances and the other needs essen
tial to caring for 18,000 men, fully half of
whom are very sick or in a Â±e*i>le phys
ical condition. In addition to this, most
of the bedding and much of the clothing
were left in Santiago to prevent yellow
fever Infection. All of these deficiencies
have had to be supplied. We have but
one line of railroad to bring these sup
plies and sometimes Mere have been de
lays.

GENERAL SHAFTER TOO ILL TO
ANSWER SENN'S ACCUSATIONS.
NEÂ». YORK, Sept. 2. â The Herald correspondent at Camp Wikoff
says: Major General Shafter is ill and did not leave his tent in the
detention camp to-day. He had a severe chill early in the morning
and several others during the day. The surgeons say his illness is
the result of hard work and nervous strain in an unfavorable clim
ate, and that It is not at all serious.
When I called at his tent this afternoon General Shafter was lying
on a cot near the entrance. He could not receive me, and when I
asked through Major Miley of his staff whether he would say any
thing about the attack made upon him by Colonel Nicholas Senn, as
sistant surgeon, he sent back the reply that he was tired of contro
versies and did not care to say anything about Dr. Senn's declaration
that he was responsible for the terrible suffering of the soldiers in
Cuba.
Dr. Senn, in a signed statement, referred to the General as arro
gant and stupid, and said he was responsible for the extensive out
break of yellow fever during the Cuban campaign.

the approximated 220,000 men called for

HIGH-WATER MARK
OF THE GOLD RESERVE
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2--The gold re
serve in the treasury reached the highest
point in its history to-day with a total
reserve of $219,320,372. The highest pre
vious amount was $218,000,000, which was
recorded in March, ISBS. The reserve was
established In 1879 with $116,000,000. It first
reached $200,000,000 in October, 1&37, when
the figures were $2,000,000 above that mark.
The lowest point reached was $4,000,000 in
January, 185)5. In June, 1897, there was
$140,000,000, and one year later the amount
was $165,000,000.

When Toral Spoke of Surrendering

Province the Commander
Was Surprised.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 2.â The World
prints an interview with General
Shafter in which he is reported as say
ing:
"At Santiago we had to deal with
things as they were, not as they should
have been. Of course there was sick
ness. It was inevitable in a summer
campaign. But nobody was neglected.
The doctors were scarce at first, but we
had boatloads of them as soon as they
could get there. The doctors got sick
like the rest. They were overworked
and exhausted, but their ability was
unquestionable. Look at the low per
centage of deaths from wounds. It
never was lower in any war.
"The men who ordered a summer
campaign in a fever-invested country
are responsible for the natural and un-
avoidable consequences. Our men were
all unacclimated. They never had faced
constant sun. Many of them had never
slept out before they went into camp.
How could they be molded into proper
material for such a climate and such a
campaign? It could not be done.
"I am satisfied with the Santiago
campaign. When it is fully under
stood, with all its difficulties, it will re
ceive a just place in military history.
"I knew that the war was over as
soon as Toral spoke to me about sur
rendering all the troops in the eastern
province. I almost fell over. We
never had on the fighting line at any
one time more than 13,000 men, and
with these we captured 27,000."
"Did Cervera's men help in the San
Juan fight?" was asked, to clear up a
mooted point.
"Yes, Indeed. He had 1000 men
ashore from his fleet in the battle of
July 1. His chief of staff, Bustamente,
was killed. His marines and sailors
suffered severely. Cervera put them
all back on board July 2, and on the
3d he tried to get to sea.
"The Spaniards were down to their
last bit of rice when they surrendered,
but they declined on the flr*t day to
accept the rations offered to them.
They said that American charity hu
miliated them, but I noticed that they
came around for the grub on the sec
ond day."
"What is the condition of Santiago
to-day?" was asked.
"It is in a fair state of health," re
plied General Shafter. "Under the mil
itary governorship now in existence it
will soon be cleaned and made thor
oughly healthy. It is a pretty town,
but the surrounding courltry is in a
state of wreck. You can't imagine the
destitution of the island of Cuba."
"Did you see any reconcentrados?"
"Only a few. I fear that most of
them are dead. But the death rate
in Santiago has dropped from eighty
a day to thirty-five, and most of the
deaths are those of old people or
children who had not recovered from
the starvation which they had en
dured."

GENERAL PANDO
FLIES WITH CASH
Secretly Sails for Spain
With a Fortune.
HAS TWELVE MILLION FRANCS
MYSTERY CONNECTED WITH
THE DEPARTURE.
When the Spanish Soldiers in Cuba
Hear of the Removal of the
Wealth There Will Be
Trouble.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 189S, by James Oor
dun Bennett.
HAVANA, Sept. 2.â Having success
fully done everything in his power to
convey the impression that he was
sailing to Spain via New York on the
steamship Philadelphia, yesterday
morning General Pando instead secret
ly started direct for his native land
about ten hours later on the French
steamer Notre Dame dv Salut, it is
said, with 12,000,000 francs.
The secret was so effectively kept
that very few persons here have any
knowledge of it, and all the Havana
newspapers announced Pando's depart
ure on the Philadelphia.
Pando was no sooner aboard the ship
than he sent for Captain Pilllard and
intrusted the 12,000,000 francs to his
safe keeping, obtaining a receipt for it.
Pando then locked himself in his state
room and remained concealed until the
ship left the harbor, about 7 o'clock In
the evening.
There are many plausible reasons for
General Pando's conduct, though ex
actly which one moved him it is im
possible to ascertain. Much depends
on where the treasure he carried away
came from, but whatever its source,
when the army is seven months in ar
rears and the civil list four months, and
while both cry out for pay, it is obvious
that a dangerous amount of discontent
will be stirred up if the knowledge of
the transportation of any such amount
becomes public.
Although Pando had the reputation
of having considerable private wealth,
it is preposterous to suppose any such
sum could be realized on his property
here under existing circumstances. If
the amount taken was paid by Blanco
at Madrid's order, the army and civil
list conditions would make secrecy ab
solutely essential.

FOR INTERVENTION

YET FOOLING THE PEOPLE
CASTILIANS TOLD WE WILL
PAY THEIR DEBTS.
The Madrid Government Has Ceased
All War Preparations, and Ap
parently Belies Upon
Peace Arguments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 2.-The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Spain still hopes for Euro
pean intervention which will insure the
continuance of her sovereignty in the
Philippines.
Information to this effect from a con
fidential source in Madrid has been re
ceived by the authorities here. Why
any such hope should exist is the ques
tion, for the authorities say that the
international horizon at the present
time looks very clear, and there is no
danger of any European pressure be
ing brought to bear upon this Govern
ment.
It is believed that the hope for inter
vention exists more among the people
than among Spanish officials, who are
making public speeches to this effect
In the hope of reconciling the people to
the peace protocol. Spain is apparently
making no efforts to resume the war.
Information received from American
confidential agents in Europe shows
that the work of fortifying the coast
towns has ceased and that no effort iÂ«?
being made to complete ships under
construction. In view of this lack of
preparation on the part of the Spanish
Government the officials with whom
have talked say it is evident that the
Sagasta ministry intends to rely more
upon the arguments of its peace com
mission than upon further resistance to
the demands of the United States
It is expected that some attempt will
be made to make capital out of the dis
satisfaction existing amon? the Ameri
can volunteers, and to point out that
this Government could never have con
quered in Cuba without great sacrifice
of life. I und rstand that official in
formation received here is that the
Spanish Government is trying to make
people believe that they will not have
to pay the debt because of its beine
assumed by the United States in re
turn for Cuba and Porto Rico. There
is no intention on the part of the ad
ministration to assume the Cuban or
any other debt, and the peace commis
sioners will be so instructed.
The Spanish commissioners will not
it is thought, be in a hurry to complete
their work as every day's delay may
bring protests from a European Gov
ernment or some other complication
which will be of advantage to Spain
CRITICISM ON THE
CZAfTS PEACE NOTE
Immediate Disarmament Impossible
Owing to the Stand of France
and Germany.
ST. PETER3ITTTRG, Sept. 2,â The
Novoe Vremya, replying to criticisms of
the Cear's peace note, interprets them as
meaning that the "powers are to main
tain the relative positions they now oc
cupy and together seek the means of
rendering unnecessary the expensive and
purposeless armaments which are ruin-
IPJL nat| ons." The paper then adds:
There is no question of Immediate dis
armament or the resulting consequences
which . seem to disturb the French and
Germans."
LONDON, Sept. 2.â The Westminster
Gazette this afternoon announces that
owing to the absence of the Marquis of
Salisbury, Great Britain has not yet for
mally replied to the Czar's peace note!
"The British Embassador at St. Peters
burg has already communicated in cordial
terms the hearty sympathy with which
the note was read by the Acting Minister
for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Balfour, First
Lord of the Treasury. When the Mar
quis of Salisbury replies to the note," the
Gazette continues, "he will hail with
satisfaction and delight the Czar's initia
tive, assuring him of the determination
of Her Majesty's advisers to co-operate
heartily in promoting his great aim." â 
BERLIN, Sept. 2.â lt is the intention of
Russia, according to reliable information
obtained by the correspondent here of the
Associated Pre.ss, to convene a peace con
ference a month after .the adjournment of
the Spanish-American conference.
The Berliner Post, in a seemingly in
spired article this morning with reference
to the French reception of the disarma
ment proclamation of Emperor' Nicholas,
says: Germany must remain arm*d and
on guard until France is willing to con
vert her weapons into plowshares.

SEEKING THE ORIGIN
OF FEVER CASES
Marine Hospital Officials to Make a
Thorough Investigation at
Orwood, Miss. :
WASHINGTON. Sept. 2.â The marine
hospital service was officially advised to
day of the ten new cases of yellow fever
which have been, discovered at Orwood,
Miss. The officials are at sea as to. the
origin of the fever, -and have no definite
theories to work upon. They are -endeav
oring to trace the cases. There is a 'pos
sibility that the victims brought the
germs In their cloth.es to Orwood .from
some point heretofore' infected, but â¢ the
nearest one is Durant, where the-epi
demic touched last year, and even on this
theory the warm weather should have
brought out the fever. Orwood is far
from a railroad and the fever therefore
might not have been- brought by- that
mean*. A thorough investigation, is to be
made. There, is no disouiettng/ news
from any other points save Orwood.

were eagerly watching the effect and
their. sn;iles broadened, into audible

As the pieces of money jingled to the

fell to the pavement the- street became
a seething mass of humanity.- Men,
boys arid women {locked from the street
cars, shops and byways to participate

UNITED STATES COALING STATION ON PAGO-PAGO HARBOR.
Steps are now being taken by the naval authorities in Washington to construct a wharf end coaling station in Pago-Pago harbor, on the
island of Tutuila. Samoa. The work is to be of a very elaborate character, consisting of a wharf, steel sheds, tramways and every cr venience for
the storage and shipment of coal.
Tutuila, though the smallest of the three principal islands in the Samoan rroup, possesses in Pago-Pago the finest harbor in the Southern
Pacific. It is completely land-locked and runs inland, between high mountains, for three miles. There is deep water everywhere and sufficient room
to anchor the whole of our fleet in perfect safety. The United States acquired the right to erect a coaling station on the shores of this harbor by
the Washlngto- treaty of 1878, but the nation has never taken full advantage of its privileges. A few thousand tons of coal wera stored there, but
this has long since been removed and the light wooden wharf erected has fallen into complete decay. The recent alarming news from Samoa, com
bined with the desire to secure a permanent coaling station in the South Pacific, has, he wev?r, induced the administration to sanction the construction
of an establishment adequate to our naval needs.
SUFFERS FOR THE
SIN OF THE THIRD
STREET DEFAMERS
presQO Correspondent of the Ex
aminer Thrashed for an Of
fense of Y\\s Employers,
FRESNO, Sept. 2.â Fulton G. Berry, proprietor of the Grand Cen
tral Hotel and a capitalist of Fresno, thrashed P. B. Danky, local
correspondent for the San Francisco Examiner, in the lobby of the
hotel this ning at 7 o'clock. The trouble arose over an article
â which appeared In to-day"s Examiner concerning Charles M. Berry,
who was said to have lost $1000 In a poker game In San Francisco.
The article stated that he was a son of Fulton G. Berry, when, in
fact, he was a nephew.
La^t night Danky was Instructed by the Examiner to see Charles
M. Eerry or Fultoh G. Berry and obtain a statement from one of
them. Danky saw Fulton G. Berry, who asked him not to have the
article, state that Charles Berry was his son. Danky accordingly sent
the following telepram to the Examiner:
'Charles Berry not in town. His uncle, F. G. Berry, says he is
probably stopping at the Savoy House. Post and Powell streets."
Notwithstanding that the Examiner -was advised of the fact that
Fulton G. Berry was not the father f the poker player the paper
stated that Charles Berry was "the son of Fulton G. Berry, the capi
talist, politician and bon vivant of Fresno."
Mr. Berry met Danky in the lobby of the hrtel and holding him
responsible for the Examiner's willful mlsstateraent assaik-d him.
Danky was hit on the face several times before bystanders pulled
the angry hotel man away. Danky swore out a warrant for Mr.
Berry's arrest for battery and Mr. Berry pleaded guilty. He will be
sentenced on Tuesday.
When shown the telegram that Danky sent Mr. Berry admitted
that he was wrong, but he scores the Examiner for having willfully
published a falsehood to make a sensation out of a very ordinary
item, especially v.hen the paper was advised of the facts by its cor
respondent. Friends of both Mr. Berry and Danky are roasting the
Examiner on the streets to-night.

CLAY'S SUIT FOB DIVORCE.

the General by Hi<3 Wife.
RICHMOND, Ky., Sept. 2.â The petition
for divorce filed by General Casslus M.
Clay to secure a legal separation from his
girl wife, Dora Richardson Clay, recites
"that the plaintiff has treated the de
fendant in all respects as a dutiful and
faithful husband should and that he has
fully met and discharged sill the cove
nants of said marTi&ge contract, but that
the defendant did, without fault on the
part of the plaintiff, abandon him on July
3, 1897, and has since, lived separate and
apart '~om him."
Gene \ Clay prays for a divorce, and
asks Â«â¢â¢ a-t the defendant be restored to
her maiden name and given all proper re
lief, which is supposed to mean that he
intends to provide a liberal alimony. The
defendant's answer admits all the
charges. General Clay says that the girl
shall never want so long as he lives.

TACOMA, Sept. 2.â One of the most
exciting episodes of years in Lincoln
County was witnessed at Harrington
on Wednesday evening, when a
Sheriff's posses undertook to arrest two
men charged with cattie stealin;.r. They
were "Billy" Gibbons and I. H. Paul,
who a few days before had sold eigh
teen stolen cattle 'to John Bovee, a
butcher, at Ritzville. They had scarce
ly got out of town when an excited
rancher drove in to start officers on the
trail. He identified Bovee's beeves as
his stolen cattle and swore out war
rants for Paul and Gibbons.
Sheriff Thompson found that they
had crossed into Lincoia County,
whose oflieers were wired to hold th^m.
Deputy Sheriff McNamara of Lincoln
County headed a posse which sur
rounded them at Harrinjrton and at
tempted to arrest them. Revolvers
were freely used on both tides, but the
scrimmage was so lively that no one
was seriously hurt.
Gibbons was arrested, but Paul <jr>em
ed determined to escape or lie in the |
attempt. He and McNamara exchanged
several shots before Paul i-eached his
horse and rode away. By clewr ma
neuvering Paul got the posse started .
off in one direction while he took an
other. Last night the officers found
his trail and were chasing him.
Gibbons is just out of thr? Walla

Signal Failure of the Boss to
Obtain a Foothold in the

Populists Are Dissatisfied With the Fusion Plan
and May Nominate a Complete
Ticket.

: " RAN JOSE, Sept. 2.â rPolitlcs. went on
j with a dash" and a vim here to-day, and
all day long there were. two county.con
ventions in session â Democrats and
Populists^ .To-morrow there will be
another double performance, when the
Populists and tile Good â  Government
league conventions will finish their la
bors. '-'â â '.''.â â 
r The Democratic convention at Turn
Yen in Hall- was characterized by its
freedom from "Boss" Kea's influence,
and with the exception of two in
. stances, the . ticket named is' strongly
anti-ganp.- The exceptions are Bollin-
ger for Sheriff. and Itosenthal'for Town
ship Justice, . The convention was the
most- representative held in this county
In years, and is probably the first in
which the handiwork of the boss has
not been discernible: â 
Nicholas â  Bo.wden was chairman and
A. It. Denike secretary. The convention
was about 22U s;r<mg. Almost the first
business transacted was. the appoint
ment of a conference committee to
meet with a like committee â¢ from the
Populists looking to fusion. It consist*
eti of B. D. Murphy, chairman; G. D.
Millard, R. Trimble, Frank Taylor and
J. F. Lewis. â¢â¢ â¢ ;â â "â¢'
For over two hours the committee
was in session with representatives of
the Populist convention, the Silver .Re
publicans and the Gfjpd Government
League. "When ii returned it announced
that the Populists wished the office of
District Attorney and one' Township
Justice and the appointment of a com
mittee of- ten to meet a committee from
their body and name a legislative ticket
within ten days. The Good Government
League people wanted a straight anti
tang ticket, and suggested that L. J.
Chipman be named for Superintendent
of Schools and A. S. Klttredge for Su
perior Judge.
Here the first test of Rea's strength
In the convention occurred. The boss
had boaSt< d that the convention must
nominate Scheller for Judge, but a mo
tion that the convention accept Kit
tredgv for the office was carried by a
vote of 123 to 61. This also indicated a
spirit in favor of fusion.
The .platform adopted, after affirm
ing adherence to the State platform,
staled that the recent Republican pri
mary in the county demonstrated the
need of- a new primary law which
w.iuld make It impossible for such
gross frauds and ballot-box stuffing, as
was then perpetrated. Freedom of the
schools from all political aud sectarian
Influences was favored. It denounced
as "an outrage against decency and
pood government the interference of
scents of a political boss in the admin
istration of the affairs of the San Jose
High School, and the unwarranted re
moval of teachers therefrom because
they refused to become servile tools of
the boss and to prostitute their posi
tions :to further his corrupt political
ends."
The report of the credentials com
mittee stunned the Rea men. But few
gang men received appointments to the
convention, and Rea attempted to get
a representation in it by buyipg prox
ies; Some twenty-five or thirty had
been secured, but the credentials report
â  ran his henchmen to cover and they re
' turned' most of the proxies. As it was
â¢ .the entire delegation of five from Sara
toga, which Rea had secured by prox
ies, was: given one vote and four prox

Other 'proxies were not recognized.

PRANKS AT STANFORD.
Nocturnal Episode That Nearly Vio
lated the ''No-Rushing" Order.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 2.
"No rushing" is the order which has been
given out at Stanford, but that order was
nearly violated by a false alarm which
was spread this evening among the so
phomores by a large crowd of upper class
men. The sophomores, thinking the fresh
men were preparing, receded to a posi
tion near University avenue and got
ready for rushing. It proved to be merely
a body of upper classmen, but they
thinking to form a fitting finale, bore
down on the awaiting sophomores. The
crash proved an entire surprise. The
joke was learned too late, and juniors
and seniors were piled pell-mell in the
dust. Mr. Adams, editor-in-chief of Se
quoia, was among the first of the Jokers
to fail.
"1 am Bristow Adams, boys; I'm Bris
tow ," he cried as he fell.
"So. we Bee!" was the response, as the
sophomores removed themselves from his
carcass.
The crowd then proceeded to Dr. Jor
dan's house, and after giving him a rous
ing ovation returned to the hall. It is
doubtful whether the rush can be abol
ished.
BUYS TEHAMA LAND.
Charles Tait Purchases Half of the
Tyler Estate.
RED BLUFF, Sept. 2.â Details of one
of the largest land sales which has taken
place In this county In many years were
completed to-day, whereby Charles Tait
of Tehama purchased from the San Fran
cisco Savings Union a half of the famous
Tyler estate, about ten miles south of
this city. The other half of the ranch
is leased to Mr. Tait.
This estate has become famous as in
cluding the best land in Tehama County,
and also because of it having been in lit
igation for so long a period. John C.
Tyler brought suit against Tehama Coun
ty for damages Caused by the county
building a bridge across Elder Creek and
the embankments thereoi, causing the
creek to wash away land damaging the
Bite of his residence. The suit was
brought to an end by his deatn in 1897.
Soon afterward ...o magnificent resi
dence, costing $50,000, was destroyed by
fire.
The purchase price paid by Mr. Tait to
day was $40,000.
FOREST FIRE'S RAVAGES.

STOCKTON, Sept. 2.-Cnarles Ritter, a
seven-year-old son of a machinist, was
accidentally shot to-night while playing
with his two brothers. They had a shot
gun and did not know it was loaded. The
charge just missed the boy's hand, and
the powder with a stray shot or two in
jured one of his eyes so that it had to be
extracted.

The Relief Association of the Foresters

showing' what work had been done since
the previous meeting. These showed that
the association, which has for its object
the rendering of aid to Foresters In the
volunteer army and to any sick soldiers
who may need assistance, has established
two tents at the Presidio, at which each
day there are a number of ladies from
circles who attend to the wants of the
soldiers, particularly those in the hos
pital tents, furnishing them beef tea.
soups and delicacies. During the past
week they ministered to the wants of
from SO to 120 invalid soldiers each day,
and the gratefulness of those they attend
ed repaid the Companions for all the' la
bor expended. The members of the asso
ciation have cheerfully volunteered their
services, and all the expenses thus far
have been met by the courts and circles.
On the 16th an entertainment will be
given to increase the fund of the associa
tion so that the good work may be kept
up.

AN IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT.
We Fought Spain in Obedience to an
Impulse to Fulfill Our
Destiny.
War, said the Greek historian, often
breaks out on trivial occasions, seldom
from trivial causes. Now that the war
between the United States ar.d Spain is,
happily, at an end, it may not be un
profitable to consider some of its more
deep-seated causes and some of its less
obvious lessons. It would be unjust to
the passionate patriotism of a great na
tion to call the destruction of the Maine
a trivial occasion. But that catastrophe
has not yet been proved to have been due
to an external agency, nor, if an external
agency be assumed, is there any proof of
complicity either on the part of the
central Government of Spain or on that
of the Provisional Government of Cuba,
We may say then that, even if the de
struction of the Maine was the imme
diate occasion of the war, it was cer
tainly not its cause. It may have been
the match that ilred the mine, but the
mine was laid long before in those re
ciprocal movements of national progress
and decay which in their mutual reac
tion constitute the march of humanity.
We gc-t a stage nearer the cause, but
only a stage, when we say that it is to
be sought in the growth of the sea power
of the United States. But this cause
again is not ultimate, nor is it adequate
in itself to explain the effect. The sea
power of the United States is no craftily
prepared instrument of vulgar aggression,
but the natural and largely unconscious
expression of the deeper impulses of a
great nation bent upon fulfilling its des
tiny. Stretching across a great continent
from ocean to ocean, born of sea power
in her origin, nurtured by sea power in
her infancy, snatching her freedom from
the conflict of sea. power, industrial, com
mercial, progressive, and adventurous in
her civilization, the United States has at
last become conscious that sea power is
her appointed heritage, whether f<r weal
or for woe. Before that consciousness
had leavened the mass of her people a
generous feeling of humanity, a native
love of order and peace, an Inborn hatred
alike of anarchy and of oppression â not
unmixed perhaps with many less worthy
motivesâ brought her into sharp antag
onism with a power In hor Immediate
neighborhood which had for long gener
ations abused the privileges of empire and
morally forfeited its prerogatives. From
this point of view the war was a conflict
inevitable in the long run. between forces
which, on any theory of the moral govern
ment of the world, must be regarded as
| good and evil, respectively. Nothing but
a miracle or a cosmic catastrophe could
i have -livened the ultimate collision be
! twecn the growing sea power of the
j United States and the waning empire of
! Spain.
By sea power alone the transmarine em
pire of Spain has been undone; by sea
. powff alone, by the spontaneous and al
| most fortuitous return of a maritime race
jto its native element, the transmarine
I empire of the United States has been in
augurated. The result is a lesson 10 all
I powers which cither cherish transmarine
: ambitions of set purpose or yield because
they must, as the people of the United
States have founa, to expansive impulses
inherent In their polity and race. The
1 full Import of that lesson can hardly be
j discerned as yet. The foresight of a
statesman, tho insight of a philosopher,
even the imagination of a poet might well
! r>e taxod to read it aright; for it can
i hardly be that the collapse of the historic
' empire of Spain and the fulfillment by
i the United States of an imperial destiny,
j foreordained by the genius of her people
! to be expansive but not aggressive, will
[ be unattended by consequences of vitai
, moment alike to the Old World and the
New.â London Times.
"Australia's Greatest Kangaroo
Drive of the Year," in next Sun
day's Call.
QUESTIONS OF POPULATION.
In the United States and Canada the in
crease in population Is about 20 per cent
per annum, but this Is partly owing to
Immigration from other countries already
full. In South America, owing to the
general unhealthfulness of the country
and the mixed composition of the inhab
itants, the increase is only about 5 per
cent per annum, it being an acknowl
edged fact that mulattoes and half
breeds cannot rival the purer races.
The vast colonies of Australia aro fast
filling up, and there Is an annual increase
in population of about 30 per cent, and
thin, as in the case of the United States
and Canada, Is partly owing to the enor
mous Immigration from other parts of
the world. Still, In comparison with
England, Australia has at present a
small average population to the square
mile, a*id this is the country that con
gested Europe will look to as a harbor
for her surplus population. Africa has.
during the last few years been well ex
plored, and from all accounts the cen
ter of that vast continent seems to be
unfitted for other than the native in
habitants. Africa has an area of about
three times that of Europe; the popula
tion is roughly estimated at 205,000,000.
We will now come nearer home and
look at our own teeming population; that
of Ireland is 145 to the square mile, Scot
land 135. whereas that of England runs
up to about 487 to the square mile. The
population of the British Isles in 1891 was
37,550.7C4. The Increase in the population
of London has been most remarkable. In
1801 the 'census showed 804,000 inhabit
ants, in ISII there were over 1,000,000 in
is:>l there were 2,862.000, and in 18S1
8.815,534, while at the last census, in 1891,
there were 5,533. SO6, being an increase of
about 47 per cent in the last decade, but
many suburbs have been added since 1801.
Statistics show that the population of
this immense city, the largest in the

JOINT COMMISSION'S WORK
CONFRONTED BY A SBBIOUS
PROBLEM.
Dominion Not Disposed to Drive a
Fair Bargain in Adjusting
Trade Relations With
This Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
QUEBEC, Sept. 2.â The joint commis
sion of the United States, Canada and
Newfoundland, after ten days' work,
adjourned at 2 o'clock this afternoon
to meet again in this city on September
20. All of the American commissioners
excepting Mr. Kasson will return to
their homes or to Washington. Mr.
Kasson will remain in Quebec.
What the commissioners accomplish
ed up to this point or what they are
likely to accomplish in the future can
only be inferred from outward Indica
tions. Absolutely nothing has been re
vealed from within the meeting rooms
of the commission. From the very first
session until the adjournment the com
missioners on both sides have repeated
ly stated that the most friendly rela
tions existed and that the representa
tives of both Governments manifested
a disposition, even a determination, to
reach a final adjustment of the ques
tions of International disputes before
them. In fact, everything that has
transpired before the public eye in
connection with the conference has con
firmed these statements.
But there are questions which many
predict the commissioners will have
great difficulty In adjusting, if they are
able to adjust them at all. Some of
these difficulties are foreshadowed in
what has taken place here during the
past three days.
Three powerful industries of the
United States, by their representatives,
have appeared here, praying the Ameri
can members of the conference to make
no change in the duties now imposed
upon the Canadian products of lumber,
fish and pulp paper. The lumber inter
est is the most important of the three,
and it is known that between this time
and the reconvening of the conference
steps will be taken by the United
States lumber men to forestall any ac
tion on the part of the commission in
the way of opening wider the United
States markets fur Canadian lumber.
Another powerful industry yet to be
heard from is the agricultural interest.
The farmers of the United States, it is
known, will oppose most vigorously any
adjustment of affairs which will involve
a reduction of the duty on Canadian
agricultural products. Yet these are
some of the concessions the Canadian
Government desires.
If the joint high commission had
nothing to do btrt to settle the Bering
Sea question, the boundary lines of
Alaska, the fisheries or any group, or
all of the twelve questions enumovated
in the protocol, no doubt they could
do it, but the greater question of re
ciprocity has seemed to force itself be
fore the conference, and will be difli
cult to settle.
So far as known the only expression
from the United States in accord with
the Canadian view of reciprocity is that
coming from the Boston Chamber of
Commerce. These gentlemen told the
commissioners that they favored the
freest possible trade relations with
Canada and that they spoke for a very
large number of the manufacturing in
interests in the Eastern and northern
States. Against this came the protests
of the lumber men, who declared that
their industry alone gave employment
tc a number of American citizens as
large as the entire population of Can
ada and they desired the duty on lum
ber to remain as it Is.
A man closely identified with the
United States Government said to-day:
"Since I have been here I have care
fully observed the situation and have
learned that Canada expects the United
States to give her an exclusive prefer
ential duty in our market while they
propose to admit our goods only upon
the same condition that the products
of Great Britain are admitted. The
Canadian Idea is that in our markets
they are to have an advantage against
the rest of the world, while in their
market they will give us only on equal
opportunity to compete with Great
Britain. The kind of reciprocity which
the Americans favor and which the
commercial bodies of the United States
have nsked our commissioners to se
cure is the reciprocity which gives an
equal advantage in the respective mar
kets In the countries whioh are par
, ties to the agreement and that this ad
vantage should be exclusively enjoyed
by each country. Had these various
commercial bodies known at the time
they considered and passed their reso
lutions what kind of reciprocity Can
ada wanted, it is doubtful if any of
them outside of the Boston Chamber of
Commerce would have favored or
would have presented thpse resolutions
which are now in the hands of the com
missioners.
"Canada some time ago increased the
preferential tariff in favor of Great
Britain at 2% per cent, so to-day the
American goods pay 25 per cent more
duty than English goods. If reciproc
ity between nations, especially be
tween the United States and foreign
countries, is to be secured only In this
way, then the American Government
should add 25 per cent to Its prosent
tariff In order that It might make a
deduction correspond to that which
Canndn proposes, or 'â " other words, so
It would have something to trade on.
It is this attitude of the American
press and Canada's -^Ã¼blic men that
leads me to believe that reciprocity
with Canada is utterh' out of the ques
tion."

LONDON. Sept. 3.â The Daily â¢
Mall says this morning: "We â¢
learn that Mr. Balfour and the â¢
German EmbaEsador, Count yon -
Hatzfeldt, signed on Wednesday *
a document preliminary to a -
treaty which will give Germany -
a free hand in Asia Minpr and -
allow England to lease Dela,goa -
Bay from Portugal at a cost of -
between Â£2,000,000 and Â£5,000,- -
000. Germany will, as a further -
condition, support Great Brit- -
am's claim for the abolition of -
mixed tribunals in Egypt. Mr. -
Scomberg Kerr McDonnel, the -
Premier's private secretary, has Â«
left London for the Continent to -
submit to Lord Salisbury a copy -
of the treaty." *
LONDON, Sept. 2.â A report was
current here to-day that a treaty of
alliance between Great Britain and
Germany, on the lines of the speech of
Mr. Chamberlain, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, was actually
completed yesterday. This ~robably is
an amplification of the gossip relative
to the daily visits of Count yon Hatz
feldt-Weidenburg, the German Embas
sador, to the British Foreign Office
during the past fortnight, which have
been attributed to a desire on the part
of Germany and Great Britain to form
ulate a common policy in regard to
Russia and China. Another explana
tion of the German Embassador's
visits to the Foreign Office here is that
they relate to the mixed tribunals of
Egypt, the int-.rnational agreement on
the subject ending February. It is said
an agreement has been almost reached
by which Germany will support the
British views relative to the future
composition and powers of the mixed
tribunals.
It is said that as a quid pro quo for
Germany's support in Egypt, Great
Britain will recognize Germany's
claims to utilize Syria as an outlet for
her surplus population.
Syria is a division of Asiatic Turkey,
which Includes Palestine, and is esti
mated to cover an area of about 146,
000 square miles. It has a population
of about 2,750,000, mostly Mohamme
dans, but including about 350,000 Greek
Christians, 260,000 Maronites and Ro
man Catholics, 175,000 Jews and 48,000
Druses.
The Pall Mall Gazette this afternoon
says it has received from a source in
which it has every confidence informa
tion that the Anglo-German agree
ment was signed this week by Mr. Bal
four and the German Embassador in
behalf of the respective powers. Con
tinuing, the Pall Mall Gazette says
that while the agreement is restricted,
it embraces an offensive and defensive
alliance in certain eventualities.
The Pall Mall Gazette adds:
"This new and momentous departure
in our foreign policy comes as a nat
ural development of the European sit
uation."
The Pall Mall Gazette then quotes
the speech of Mr. Chamberlain made
at Birmingham on May 18 last, bid
ding for a German alliance, and con
tinues:
"Latterly It has been evident from
the tone of the semi-official German
press that the two governments have
been drawing closer, and finally there
were prolonged conferences between
Count Hatzfeklt and Mr. Balfour. The
departure of Count Hatzfeldt proves
that the object of the consultations has
been achieved. Besides, Mr. Chamber
lain has gone to America, Lord Salis
bury is prolonging his absence and Mr.
BRlfour leaves for his holidays on Sat
urday. Evidently the Ministers do not
expect to have a deal with crucial
questions of foreign policy."

stage of his journey." ..He was also ac
companied by the members of his fam-;
ily, Paris Kilburn and a '. number of
gentlemen who were delegates to the
State Convention from Los Angeles and

purpose of attending their .chief on his

to .Mr. Gage just prior to his departure
wore a number of prominent Democrats
. who have formed his acquaintance dur
ing his stay in the city. 'While it is
. true . that their "greetings and good
wishes . were of a personal nature' the
very fact of their presence there was
significant of the wonderful' magnetism
that enables Mr. Gage to draw -to' him
men of. all classes ' regardless of their
personal prejudices Or political beliefs.
Since, his arrival, here a week ago
Mr. Gage has met . niany hundreds of
men who are more or less prominent
â socially and politically,' and the impres
sion that he has made is .not to be
measured by words. Before the State
Convention chose him as the. party's
(lard-bearer- during the â¢ present
campaign .he was comparatively un
known in. the northern portion of the
State, yet" so rapidly has -he 1 made his
way into the hearts and-. affections of
the people here that his personal popu
larity is already as great as that of
almost any man north of theTehachapi
line. â¢' . â¢....:.:
Mr. ' Gage's popularity .in. his . own
home -will be testified to . by the mag
r.ificen.t reception" that is being prepared
for him- the citizens of Los Angeles
and the prominent: people of the south
ern portion of the State. The demon
stration ' will exceed anything of the
'kind ever tendered to a citizen of the
southland. It Is Mr.- Gage's intention
to shortly return to this city for the
purpose of. advising with the State
Central Committee snd with the party
leaders concerning the. conduct of the
campaign. He is so well and favorably
known throughout- the southern part of
the State that it will be unnecessary
.for him to make an extended canvas
there. It is his intention to devote the
greater part of his time between now
and erection day to making additional
friends in the northern districts.
If Mr. Gage wanted proof that the
fire he- kindled- at the. Macdonough
Theater, last week' is being kept alive
he certainly found 'it during the eighty
five .seconds that the Los Angeles ex
press stopped at the Sixteenth-street
depot. '. - ' â¢;. . â ; â

The decp^sed .was one of the most successful missionaries of his
church,- traveling 160,000" miles in his efforts to make converts. He was a

Colonel Trumbb, Bishop Clawson and Mr. Cannon left last night for

"Speech." W. Nat Friend spoke a few
words and assured Mr. Gage that Ala
meda was of one mind and that it
would do its whole duty as a Repub
lican county until the standard-bearer
of the party should-return to the north.
Mr. Gage wore the button of the
Young Men's Republican League of
Alameda County and said he should
wear it till the election. The bell was
already ringing, when he thanked the
delegation for their kind expressions.
He thanked Alameda for the manner In
which it had treated him and said: "I
shall never forget the magnanimity of
your county. It is no surprise to me
now that Alameda can always be de
pended upon to be loyal to the Repub
lican party. I can assure you .that
when the time comes for Los Angeles
County and. for myself to get behind
Alameda County- and her candidate we
shall do our very best to return .all the
compliments you have extended toward
the south."

Wright and Judge J. J. Allen.
DEMOCRATS LOSE
MANY VOTdRS
DECREASED REGISTRATION THE
CAUSE.
Figures That Prove Where the Loss
in Voting Strength Will
Be Felt.
From estimates compiled by Registrar
BiÃgy it appears that the total registra
tion for the present year is about ten'
thousand less than for the year 1896. Poli
ticians and political managers have been
endeavoring to find some means of- ascer
taining, how this remarkable decrease in
the voting strength of the city will affect
the coming election. The result of this
Investigation has been a demonstration of
the fact that the falling off In the regis
tration Is largely conlined to those dis
tricts' that have heretofore returned Deny
ocratlc majorities, the Inference ' being
that the Democratic and not the Repub
lican vote will suffer from the decrease
in t Tif number of registered voters.
The following table, which has been
carefully compiled, gives a comprehensive
review of the situation:

Pledged to Shanahan.
BAXF.RSFIELD, Sept. 2.â The Populist
convention completed its work to-day. W.
R. <'rawford was nominated for Assem

resolutions against fusion and Magulre,
and pledged support to Shanahan.
were mo guests of the latter during
their stay. President Woodruff was
taken 111 two days ago. A disease of
the kidneys and the Infirmities of old
age compelled him to seek his bed. He
was constantly attended by Drs. Win-
slow Anderson, McNutt and Buckley,
but without avail. A nurse was hold
ing his hand at his demise and the end
was s<> peaceful that it was not dis
covered until his pulse ceased to beat.
President Woodruff had passed the
four score and ten mark when his life
was closed. Born near the little town
of Farmington, Conn., on March 1,
1807. he received his education in the
schools -of his native town. In early
mnnhood he met Joseph Smith, the
founder of the Mormon Church, and
mi iron over to the new faith. From
a humble disciple ho arose, step by
Btep, until he was entitled to be called
Prophet, Srer and Reve.lator of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints of all the world. In 1533 he at
tained the ministry and was ever after
an enthusiastic believer whom prose
cution could only make more stead
fast. He followed his church through
all Its vicissitudes. Success first came
to him In 1539 at Far West, Mo.,
where, he was ordained one of the
twelve apostles of the Mormon Church
with the designa#on of the "banner of
the gospel."
THE SA:N FKAXCISCO CALL, SATUKDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1898.
SAN LEANDRO
MAKES A BID
Wants Alameda Repub-
lican Convention.
NO LACK OF CANDIDATES
OFFICE OF SHERIFF THE CHIEF
PLUM.
The Prospects Are That There Will
Be a Number of Independent
Aspirants in the "
Field.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 2.
An effort is being made to bring enough
pressure on the Republican County Cen
tral Committee at to-morrow's meeting
to induce it to call the county conven
tion at San 'Leandro. Many prominent
citizens of that busy little town have
taken â  the matter in hand and have
made an organized effort to obtain the
convention. There is, however, a strong
desire to have the convention held in
this city.
Much interest Is now being expressed
in the fight for the nomination for Sher
iff, and several independent candidates
have appeared. There is some talk of
organizing an entirely independent move
ment, but if this were done It would
only be for the purpose of seeking the
indorsements of Populists and Demo
crats.
The most active independent at this
time is Louis Schaeffer, who was nomin
ated by the Republican convention for
Sheriff four years ago and was defeated
at the polls. His defeat was largely due
to the independent campaign made by
ex-Sheriff Harry Morse, and in other
ways Schaeffer was traded off for the
benefit of candidates on other party tick
ets. This experience has caused Schaef
fer to make another campaign independ
ent of party. He has a petition which
contains twelve hundred names, and
seems very confident that the Repub
lican wave will not wash over his cam-
paign.
"1 am making an independent cam
paign," said Schaeffer to-day, "and ex
pect to be indorsed by the Populists and
Democrats. Already such overtures have
been made to me, and If such indorse
ments are tendered me I will gladly ac
cept them. I am opposed to primaries
and conventions as at present conducted,
and am therefore going it alone. I do
not think 1 was treated right four years
ago, and I Intend to try again. "
Sam Heller is another In ependent can
didate for Sheriff. Heller was once a Re
publican, but when McKillican, a Demo
crat, was elected, Heller was a good
enough Democrat to earn a deputyship,
and when Sheriff White, a Populist, was
elected, Heller was a cood enough Popu
list to hold a deputyship. i+e is now go
ing it alone. George Hunt would like the
Republican nomination, but he is handi
capped by the report that he was a dep
uty under McKillican, a Democrat, and
that he did all he could to knife the Re
publican candidate four years ago.
W. W. Camron. Chief of Police Rogers
of Alameda and Under Sheriff Harlow have
been Republicans all the time, and there
is no doubt that the party will find a
good party man strong enough to uphold
the ticket.
The middle-of-the-road Populists will
hold county primaries on September 10,
on the Assembly district plan. The county
convention will be held September 15. At
present the intention is to nominate a
full county ticket, although it will prob
ably be done on the understanding that
all resignations are to be handed to an
executive committee In case a plan of
fusion should be adopted.
According to R. M. Fitzgerald, the
Democrats are just now doing some tall
thinking.
"Democrats are very modest," said the
Prison Director, "but when the time
comes I do not think there win be any
scarcity of strong names. We do not by
any means concede this campaign to the
Republicans."
The Alameda County Central Metealf
Club has adopted by-laws and made ar
rangements for a meeting to be held
somewhere In this cov.nty on every
Thursday evening.
BARRY MAKES HIS BOW.
The Congressional Nominee Ad-
dressed a Number of North
Beach Voters Last Night.
James H. Barry, candidate for Congres
sional honors, made his initial bow before
a gathering of residents of North Beach
in Apollo Hall, 810 Pacific street, last
night. Two bonfires and a band of music
attracted about 200 voters to the meeting,
and for two hours they listened to the
virtues of James G. Magulre, some sing
ing and Mr. Barry. The latter came late
and half the audience had dispersed, but
those remaining were told at the outset
that he was not going to take up their
time in addressing himself to the import
ant questions of the campaign, as they
were doubtless tired. The candidate then
spoke for twenty minutes longer.
John J. Barrett also spoke at length,
and was frequently interrupted by an c-n
thusiastlc drunken man, who encored at
the- wrong time. Mr. Barrett dwelt on the
good deeds of the Democratic candidate
For Governor. Songs and music followed,
as did also a promise from Samuel Wal
ler, organizer of the Forty-third Assembly
District Democratic Club, that refresh
ments would be served at the succeeding
meeting. Raleigh Hooe, president of the
club, acted as chairman, and introduced
the speakers.
The following resolution was offered and
adopted:
Resolved, That we, the member? of thÂ» Forty
third Assembly District Democratic Club, de
clare our â wiliinKnrss to net In conjunction with
the Democratic Central Club and all other
Democratic organizations pledging their sup
port to James O. Masulre, for the purpose of
hitrmonlzinÃ all elements of the Democratic
party In the city and county of San Francisco.
Oakland Republicans.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 2.
The Young Men's Republican Club held
a well-attended meeting this evening, at
which W. R. Davis, H. D. Talcott and
others made eloquent addresses. M"r.
Da.vis gave an Interesting comparison of
our Government with the Governments of
foreign nations, where exist to-day a feel
ing of unrest and a state of transition.
He recited at length the many inconsis
tencies which go to make up the so-called
principles of the Democratic party and
the feeling of gratification throughout
California over the nomination of Henry
T. Gage for Governor. Mr. Talcott said
there could be no more fitting Indorsement
of President McKinley's administration
than to roll up Gage s majority at the
coming election to figures never before
reached.
The Fourth Congressional Fight.
The Fourth Congressional District Re
publican convention will be held at
Shiels building on O'Farrell street at 3
o'clock this afternoon for the purpose of
nominating a candidate for Congress
against James H. Barry, the Populist-
Democratic nominee. It is almost certain
that the nomination will be given to ex-
Assemblyman Julius Kahn. Ex-State
Senator T. C. Maher, at present a deputy
in the County Clerk's office, has with
drawn from the fight. The friends of H.
G. W. Dinkelspiel, another aspirant, say
that he is still in the battlefield, but it is
probable that he will withdraw before the
convention meets and give Kahn a
unanimous nomination.
They Want to Suceed Loud.
The time and place for holding the
Fifth Congressional District Republican
nominating convention has not yet been
decided upon. There is quite a fight on
hand In the district. An effort is being
made to "turn down" Congressman Loud
in the interest of Judge D. J. Murphy.
State Senator Ed I. Wolfe has a host of
friends working for him, and they say
that they will not cease Hunting until
the nomination is made. It is generally
believed that the convention will meet at
San Jose next Tuesday. Friends of Con
gressman Loud are confident that he will
receive the nominatjon and afe paying
little attention to the boasts of his op
ponents.
ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS.
Municipal Reform League Prepares
to Take a Part in the
Coming Campaign.
The Municipal Reform League held a
meeting at 632 Market street last evening.
C. G. Nagle presided. Various amend
ments to the constitution of the league as
it stood in 1866 were pasÃed.
The following resolutions were adopted:
Whereas, It haying again become necessary to
exercise our privileges as American citizens In
behalf of the public at large, we deem It neces
sary on this occasion to give expression to our
views upon the methods we shall pursue for the
advancement of the Municipal Reform League
of San Franrioco; therefore be it

enunciated by the great Republican party In
the campaign of :596; npprove of its territorial
expansion policy of the present campaign, and
demand that when the American flat one
floats over any territory It shall remain for
ever; therefore be it further
Resolved, That we pledge our support to the
State ticket of the Republican party and the
nominees of the several Republican district
conventions; therefore be it
Resolved, That to best subserve the Interest
of the Republican party we find that the first
step !s to protect the individual Republican In
municipal matters, hence it Is deemed advis
able to unify the desires of the several com
binations of this league tn San Francisco In
demanding a primary law so that organized
minorities of the Republican party may take
part In the elections of delegates to the several
conventions; condemn the gag law as applied
by the County Committee, wherein a time Is
specified to file a delegate ticket: that we de
nounce the methods used In making political
slaves of an unsuspecting people and we hold
the constitution of the I'nlted States and the
principles contained therein abeve the dictates
of the elastic conscience of a political boss;
therefore be it further
Resolved. That the Municipal Reform League

In Favor of Leaving the
National Association.
CLAIM IT OPPRESSES THEM
THIRtf ANNUAL GATHERING OF
STATE SPIRITUALISTS.
Reports of Officers Indicate Thct
the Association Is in.
a Healthy Condi
tion.
The growing tendency of Pacific Coast
associations to sever their relations with
national bodies in the same line of en
deavor, having headquarters in the East,
developed early in the proceedings of the
third annual convention of the California
State Spiritualists' Association yesterday.
The matter was brought before the con
vention by M. S. Norton, who claimed
that the California Association will never
prosper â  until it withdraws from the na
tional body and assumes control of the
societies in this State. After a general
discussion it was decided to refer the
matter to the Incoming board of officers.
The convention, which was held in Oc
cidental Hall, Larkin and McAllister
streets, was attended by delogates from
various portions of the State. Presi
dent C. H. Wadsworth presided over the
deliberations of the delegates. The re
ports of officers, agents and missionaries
of the association showed It to be in a
healthy condition, both In point of mem
bership and in finances.
There were a number of addresses In
terspersed with the business of the day.
Dr. H. C. Johnson spoke interestingly on
the theme, "Liberty of Thought and Lib
erty of Speech." Miss Roslna Rosine
contributed a vocal solo.
The last business of the afternoon was
an extended discussion of what Is known
as the Sleeper and Progressive Spirit
ualist Trust. This was bequeathed the
association some fifteen years since for
the building of a temple. It was in the
form of property, near First and Folsom
streets, and the morwy has never been
available. The discussion ended in the
appointment of a committee, consisting
of C. W. Bassett, M. S. Norton and R.
A. Stitt to investigate >.ie matter and,
possibly, suggest a way to carry out the
wishes of the donor, Mrs. Eunice Sleeper
of Mountain View.
Among the delegates attending the con
vention are:
San Joseâ W. J. D. Hambley, Joseph Taylor.
Dr. H. C. Johnson.
Holllsterâ Mrs. Rebecca I. Johnson, J. M.
Button.

COLONEL HENRY'S CRIME.
STUDENTS of human nature will find in the
career, the crime, the confession and the sui
cide of Colonel Henry of the Intelligence De
partment of the French army one of the most inter
esting problems ever submitted to the analysis of
psychologists. â  '. â¢
Every circumstance of the case, as well as every
salient characteristic ot Colonel Henry himself, is
well known. The whole tragedy has been played out
in the-. blaze of a publicity that attracted the attention
of the Â£iit.ire world, and back of all that is known
looms a vast mystery affecting not only august mdi.
. viduais, but mighty nations. Certainly a better set
ting for a. drama dealing with the deepest depths of
the human heart is not to be found in the history of
this century in any civilized land.
The career of Colonel Henry up to the time when
he was involved in the terrible meshes of the Dreyfus
affair was a most creditable one. The son of a
French peasant, he showed when drafted into the
army such soldierly characteristics that despite the
lack of influential friends his promotion was rapid.
â¢From the ranks he rose to the grade of a commis
sioned officer During the war with Germany he
was noted not only for gallantry, but for fertility of
resource. Twice taken prisoner, he twice escaped,
and emerged from the war with as honorable a
record as any patriot could desire.
His services immediately after the war were also
distinguished. In fact he seemed to be of the best
soldier type that the world knows â faithful, laborious,
blunt of speech, prompt to obey and fitted to com
mand. During his service with the colors in the
colonies he became afflicted with an incurable ma
larial, fever, and was thereupon transferred from the
army itself to the staff at Paris. There the curse
came upon him, and he entered upon the path of
crookedness and crime from which his soldier soul
could find no escape except by suicide.
Two incidents of the tragic last day of his life
illumine the inner depths of his character. He had
' denied the authorship of the forged letter with which
he 'was confronted and persisted in the denial until
his . commanding general told him to reply "on the
honor of a soldier." Then he spoke out, "Since you
put me. on; my honor as a soldier I confess." A few
hours afterward as he took leave of his wife he said,
"I have done nothing wrong; I feel no sting of con
science." Before the sun went down lv had cut his
throat and lay weltering in blood a suicide upon the
floor of his prison.
It will be in vain that the French officials ask the
world to believe that a man with such a record as
that 'of 'Colonel Henry committed this forgery
on his own initiative. The man's sense of
honor and of duty was clearly that produced
in some natures by excessive militarism. The type is
common, but in Colonel Henry's case the devotion to
the army, .its officers and its cause had reached an ab
normal development. Perhaps the malarial fever
may. have had some effect in weakening his brain
.and thus made him an easy victim to the in
trigue's of his commanders, but the dominant impulse
to his crijne must have come to him from the out
side, and from a source which he had learned to re
spect and to serve with a blind devotion.
Out of the confession and the suicide will of course
come a reopening of the Dreyfus case, and along with
that there will be a fuller understanding of all the
circumstances and all the actions of the extraordinary
case. . When that understanding is reached then
. Colonel Henry will probably be seen to be a martyr
to the superstitions of military discipline, and not upon
himself alone will fall the blame for the crime that
brought a shameful close to a career so long carried
on with honor in war and in peace.
There is nothing cheerful in the circumstance that
a leper has been found in a local laundry. People
are prejudiced against having their linen handled by
persons having this disease. And now that the leper
has been discovered there is no place to put her ex
cept a den to which a humane man would not con
demn a pig.
General Bermudez has been executed by order of
Gomez. He was a Cuban officer who between skir
mishes hanged his subordinates for the fun of seeing
them kick. Bermudez got only that which he de
served, and not enough of that. He should have
been executed several times.
.' ..' It takes no prophet to say that Jacob Neff will be
â the next Lieutenant Governor, and by a majority so
. mighty that his Populist opponent will wonder
whether there was ever more than one in the race.
Republicans are confident of winning, but not so
confident that they are going to sleep expecting to
awaken with certificates of election in their hands.
THE SAN FRAIS CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1898.
PLfIYING THE SNEfIK-
WELLS, FARGO & CO. have abandoned
the tactics of audacity in their efforts to make
The Call and the public generally pay the tax
imposed by the war revenue act upon their business,
and are now trying to accomplish the same unlawful
end by indirection. In other words, they have
dropped the boldness of a bandit and are now playing
the sneakthief.
On Thursday the officers of the corporation, whose
disloyalty leads it to light against the war revenue bill
and whose greed induces it to snatch stolen money
when it can, sent notice that unless The Call paid for
the revenue stamps for packages of newspapers
shipped by the company it would refuse to carry such
packages. That notice at once raised an issue The
Call was only too eager to meet. It declined to be
held up and bled by the disloyal corporation, and in
an editorial gave notice yesterday that it would carry
the case into the courts and make the fight for prin
ciple on behalf of the public.
This morning we have to announce that the presi
dent of the company has weakened. The prayers of
that pious official have probably been answered by a
warning of conscience that when one intends to vio
late the statutes of his country and rob his fellow
man it is best to do it on the sly and by some cunning
means that cannot be punished in court.
Accordingly, from John J. Valentine, president of
the company, there was received yesterday a back
down couched in these words: "Referring to my
communication of yesterday and the report of our
Manager Rowell to the effect that you insist upon not
furnishing revenue stamps for your shipments of
newspapers, I have to say that it is of course imma
terial to Wells, Fargo & Co. whether you furnish
the stamp or whether the price for service be
made to include the stamp, which is also within our
province; therefore we will perform the service as
usual and amend our rates for same so as to cause
you no inconvenience.
This letter, it will be seen, evades raising a test
case for the courts. Wells, Fargo & Co. will not
carry out the threat of Thursday to refuse to carry
packages for The Call. Fear of the law will prevent
them doing that, but they make a sneaking claim
that they will get the price of the stamps by a means
which the conscience of the president permits him to
practice when he wishes to evade his taxes and vio
late the laws.
The Call ha 6no hesitation in declaring this morn
ing that the sneak of yesterday will prove as impo
tent as the bluff of Thursday. The tax-shirking, dis
loyal company will no more stand to the new posi
tion than to the old one. Express charges upon pack
ages of The Call are not paid by The Call, but by
its agents, to whom the packages are sent. We give
notice to all these agents that if they fight this claim
of the company The Call will sustain them. If
Wells, Fargo & Co. charge them, or any one of
them, as much as one cent more than the rate they
have been paying according to agreement, let them
refuse to submit to the extortion, go to the courts,
and The Call will make the fight for them.
Wells, Fargo. & Co. arc wrong, and the president
knows it. It requires no great legal skill to under
stand the meaning of the war revenue act in the
clause imposing a tax upon the business of express
companies; it requires no very great piety to have
a conscience clear enough to perceive that to rob a
neighbor by a violation of law is an offense against
the Almighty as much as a violation of the Ten Com
mandments. The president of the corporation knows
these things. He knows his company has no stand
ing in the courts or in morals, and in the face of a
fight against it will not attempt to maintain the posi
tion.
It is very well known that with the exception of
the president, the local officials of Wells, Fargo &
Co. were in favor of paying the tax as the law re
quired, and would have instructed the subordinates
to do so had not a combination of express companies
in the East decided to shirk the tax and make the
public pay it. That combination was made in viola
tion of law. It was itself an illicit coalition, and a
conspiracy to defraud the Government or the people
or both was its object. The officials of Wells, Fargo
& Co. surrendered understanding and conscience to
the dictation of this combination, and as a result the
corporation has become involved in a disgraceful sit
uation which it can neither maintain nor escape from
without sneaking.
Dispatches from the East announce that the com
bination of express companies there has already gone
to pieces. The public .has only to stand firmly with
The Call and the claims now abandoned there will
be abandoned here also. If, however, Wells, Fargo
& Co. persist in raising the rate of charges so as
to take from the people the amount required of the
corporation by the war revenue, the people will not be
without a remedy.
Express companies operating in other States are
compelled by the laws of those States to pay a license
tax, which in every case is far higher than the stamp
tax levied by the nation for the purpose of defraying
the cost of the war. California hitherto has neglected
this source of raising a revenue. There is no reason
why Wells, Fargo & Co. should not be compelled
to pay a State license, and if the company insists
upon shirking its war tax and throwing the burden
upon the people, there will be a very potent reason
apparent to the next Legislature why that license tax
should be imposed this winter.
OUT GOES THE SEVENTH-
AGREEABLE to the clamor within its ranks
and without, the Seventh California will be
dropped from the muster rolls. Its going will
cause regret, for the Seventh is a gallant body of
men, an honor to the State, and should there yet be
a demand for active service it is the sort of regiment
California would be glad to have representing it at
the front.
It is worth remark that the managing editor of the
Examiner sent to the Secretary of War a demand
that the Seventh be permitted to lay down its arms.
So it is permitted. To be sure the determination had
been reached before the managing editor was
thoughtful enough to issue his ukase, and the fact
was published in The Call, but we direct attention to
the circumstance, making the prediction that the
modest sheet of the Hearstlings will claim all the
credit. "Let them be mustered out," and they were
mustered out.
The fact that this course had been decided upon be
fore Hearst's man got upon his hind legs and spoke
for the people of California must not rob him of his
share of the credit. Mind has an influence over
matter. The very circumstance that a mind, and
such a mind as Hearst's hopping understudy, had
been made up as to the fate of the Seventh simply
settled it. There was no necessity for heating the
wire with a fresh, warm thought. The work was
done with the mere thinking. It's what you can
telepathy, and under the guidance of a master it's a
great thing.
The Police Department never believed the Stock
ton story about the purchase of the fatal candy there.
No. The department will frankly say so itself.
THE SINGLE TAX AMENDMENT.
â¢ * PI MENDMENT No. 2" to the State con
/ \ stitution, to be voted on at the coming
* election, is the single tax proposition,
agreed upon by the propaganda of that idea, and by
the opponents of private ownership of land urged
upon the Legislature. It proposes to authorize coun
ties to appoint a Board of Freeholders to frame a
system of county government in the nature of a
special charter. In its operation this special charter
may relieve all forms of personal property of taxa
tion and confiscate land in private ownership by
putting upon it a tax equal to its rental value. Of ne
cessity private ownership of land will cease under
such a regulation. Land will belong to the commune.
It will cease to be used as security for loans, and its
confiscation will mean the confiscation also of all
mortgage equities existing at the time private owner
ship ceases. This amendment is Judge Maguire's in
direct and sinister method of accomplishing the con
fiscation of land. A very large number of people are
vitally interested in this question.
The report -of the Bank Commissioners for 1896
shows that there are in this State fifty-seven savings
banks, with 159,856 depositors. These depositors
are mainly the thrifty, economical and prudent class
among our mechanics, laborers and small trades
people. They had in the fifty-seven savings banks in
1896 $131,653,635 55, on which they draw 4 to 4V2
per cent interest. The average deposit per person was
$823 57. This money of these prudent people is
mostly invested in mortgages on land. A recapitula
tion will exhibit plainly the interest of every savings
bank depositor in the private ownership of land:
Number of savings banks 57
Number of depositors 169,856
Amount on deposit $131,653,635 55
Loaned on real estate 102,281,200 07
Real estate owned by banks 4,459,789 70
Invested in stocks, bonds and warrants.. 23,359,059 40
Loaned on stocks, bonds and warrants.. 6,556,781 79
Loaned on other securities. 143,155 50
Loaned on personal security 1,324,956 58
It will be seen, then, that of the money belonging
to these 159,856 depositors in savings banks $106,740,
989 77 is loaned on real estate mortgages or invested
in real estate for the benefit of those who earned and
saved it. Under amendment No. 2 the counties of the
State may adopt local option taxation, put all tax on
the land, and put an end to private ownership.
These 159,856 savings bank depositors to the extent
of their mortgage interest are the private owners of
land. Their equity in land will be confiscated the
same as the interest of the owner of the record title.
The savings banks are merely the trustees of their de
positors. When the public has confiscated the landed
security they have taken in behalf of their trustors,
the depositors, the banks will not have any means
by which to recover the money loaned on land, and
of necessity must default to their depositors.
Of the savings bank depositors 128,484 have % their
money in the savings banks of San Francisco and
are probably residents of this city. It is possible that
a large proportion of them are not land-owners in
fee and may be unaware that they have any interest
in the private ownership of land. To all such we
send this information that to the extent of their sav
ings deposit they are interested in the private owner
ship of land. Its confiscation is also the confiscation
and loss of their savings. That landed security is
the safest and most profitable to them is proved by
the fact that the banks seek that form of security and
resort to others only when compelled to do so by
the accumulation of deposits beyond the demand for
loans on mortgage.
There are other reasons grounded on the econ
omies of public administration why the people should
defeat Maguire's single tax and land confiscation
amendment No. 2, to which reference will be duly
made. The first reason, however, is that it is a sin
ister attempt to confiscate land titles and rob also
the thrifty laborer of his accumulated savings invested
for him by the bank in which he deposits.
THE MINISTERING ANGEL.
\A OST people who have taken more than a pass
/ \ ing interest in the war with Spain will re
* * member that shortly after the call for volun
teers it was announced from Washington with some
thing Ake a flourish of trumpets that no women
would be employed as army nurses. High authori
ties had decided that the presence of women among
the wounded was more pernicious than helpful.
Woman's ministrations, it was said, were excellent
themeÂ§ for poets, but they were not calculated to
promote the strength of armies. It was even said
that the illustrious Florence Nightingale was an
overrated creature of sentiment, and that among the
battling hosts at the Crimea she was more of a
nuisance than a blessing.
All that was the prevailing philosophy in lofty
circles about a hundred days ago, when the war was
in its first flush, when the soldiers were all healthy,
hearty and happy; when there were no wounded or
sick or dying; no pestilence raging in the camps, no
dread diseases threatening officers and privates alike.
It is different now. The glory of the war is over,
the triumphs of victorious battles are things of the
past. We have now to deal with the sick and with
the wounded, and where now is the resolve to ex
clude women from the hospitals and the camps where
the sick are lying?
All reports from the stricken camps tell us of the
work the women are doing there to nurse the in
valids back to life. Miss Helen Gould and her col
leagues, and the goodly host of the ladies of the
Red Cross, are much more conspicuous than the
officials who sa short a time ago decided that as
nurses they would be nuisances.
It is the old story â the woman rejected by the war
rior in his pride buckling on his armor is now wel
comed with grateful tears by helpless invalid and
hailed as the angel of the camp.
In relating the statement of a major general of the
army, whose achievements on the field have been
honorable, the Post calls him "Pecos Bill." This. is
more than an insult to Shafter. It is an insult to the
whole army, and is a coarse and inexcusable piece of
blackguardism.
â¦ â 
While there is occasionally fault to be found .with
the police, they are assuredly right in the effort to
send the forgers Becker and Creegan across the
bay, and it could almost be hoped the Supreme Court
would take this view of the case. Ââ 
Aguinaldo is said not to be taken seriously by the
European powers, but he may be taken seriously
Dy a lot of canvas-backed soldiers from the United
States and put where he will do the least harm.
Let the Czar try the experiment of disarming his
own soldiers, taking care to leave the guns around
where they can be readily grabbed.
Governor Budd probably shed his whiskers so no
body would mistake him for a member of the Popu
list side of the fusion scheme.
Retrial of the Dreyfus case may not mean the
clearing of the prisoner, but it will mean a crop of
suicides.

A BABY'S SHOE
A SACRED MASCOT
The Queer God of Fortune That
Is Worshiped at the
Alcazar.
In connection with the subject of mas
cots and "hoodoos," which are supposed
to brighten or cloud the lives of theatrical
managers, the revival of "The First Born"
at the Alcazar on next Monday night re
calls the history of a mascot, the golden
power of which inspires the awe and ad
miration of every one connected with that
fortunate home of amusement.
When Francis Powers, a commonplace
actor, wrote "The First Born" after a
protracted study of
the customs and
style of diction of
the Mongolians, as
illustrated in China
town in this city,
the efforts of the
management to re
new the old-time
popularity of the
pretty Moorish the
ater had proved fu
tile and the institu
tion was having a
death struggle for
existence with the
prospect of surren
ctroumstances very
story was read and
tion the extra ex
pense of producing
the play was under
the discou raged
management.
The quaint child of rowers' mina was
introduced to the public a year ago last
May. The public overlooked it as the
sport ignores the existence of a white
check on the floor of a gambling palace.
For a whole week that work of art was
played to empty benches. Even the crit
ics carelessly viewed it and overlooked
its merits. However, its promoters had in
it the faith of the shipwrecked sailor and
continued the play for another week on
the proposition that there was nothing to
warrant the presentation of a new at
traction, when they had a gem that the
theatergoers would not patronize.
They had a mascot and they believed
in it.
On the opening night of the Celestial
creation a baby's i shoe and glove were
found in the dress circle and taken to the
box office. Belapco was excited.
"It's a good omen," said he. "We are
playing 'The First Born.' This shoe must
certainly belong to the first born of some
proud father. It is a mascot. We will
Keep it."
Thall said "amen." and It was hung on
the wall of the office with silken cord to
bring good luck.
When the mother came to get her
baby's footwear, she was told the cir
cumstances and given the money to buy
a new pair of shoes and went away con
tented. Here Is what happened:
With the beginning of the second week
the public" awoke to the fact that the
Alcazar had not alone something in the
line of a genuine novelty that everybody
wanted to see many times, but a gold
mine in a little play. "The First Born,"
with its amusing and touching scenes of
Oriental life, its quaint music and char
acteristic odor of burning punk ran for
100 nights to crowded houses, making a
barrel of money for the managers.
All this time the mascot hung on the
wall.
It Is there yet, covered with dust and
cobwebs, a thing to wonder at and wor
ship, that even the decorators dared not
disturb when the office was renovated.
"Hands off" is the stern rule..
Its potency has remained steadfast, for
the Alcazar has prospered ever since that
baby shoe came into the life of the
theater. As a proof of its influence for
good Its guardians point to the fact that
within the year and a half since the ad
vent of the mascot, Lewis Morrison, who
xame here for a four weeks' engagement,
Tiad a remarkably successful run of 100
nights, and, furthermore, that business is
moving along with the new company at
the same old place.
Anybody coveting that mascot must call
at night with a "Jimmy" and steal it.
That is the only way to separate the
management from it.
The discovery has been made that metal
filings of any kind can be compressed
into bars which can stand as severe tests
as the original bars which supplied the
mines.

Proved and He Was Denied a

TriaL
:'; "Plaintiff's case, was prejudged â 
arid, predetermined, and lie was â 
tried fend convicted by seven v â 
â Judges, 'three of whom were preju- â¢
.diced .against- .him, I .am, there- -

.' partial- trial.- -It. is, therefore, or- â 
â 'deredthat a writ of mandate issued â 
herein,: as- prayed for."
:i is the -concluding paragraph In a
decision' handed down by Jutlgo Hunt
rday reinstating E. C. Kilpatrick as
principal of; the BuÃineaa Evening School.
Klipatrick's "Vtdtorjr over the lioard of
Education is, for him, twofold. He has
r.-ii his position, from which ho was
y r. moved, and the judgrment of
the court scores the official body guilty
of the illegal act: â  ... . .
When the case yent to trial the board
contended that the court had no Jurisdic
tion and that, it had no power to review
the acts of that body, especially in the
case of KilpMrick; as the board had de
termined that, the charges against the
teacher wore sufficient and 'sufficiently es
tablished to warrant his dismissal as
principal of the Business Evening School.
In this the court differed from the board.
Judge Hunt held that -as H Tjdge of the
Superior Court .he- had a rig'it to inquire
Into the legal sufficiency of the charges,
and whether, if proven, tiny constituted,
a statutory ground for the dismissal of
the teacher. If .such was not the case
It would be within, the. power of the board
to prefer auy. kind of a charge against
a teacher, go through a form of trial,
find the teacher guilty and remove him
from the department without authority
of law. Tbiere must be a legal cause for
al, however, and, as the removal of
trick was -without warrant, the
adjudged presumptive and
rqust . reinstate the' dismissed teacher
whether it so desires or not.
Kilpatrick. was -tried by the Board of
atlon on six counts. They charged
attempt at blackmail; that the- a
had stated that, he had Director Kagan
'â¢under his thumb": that he had criti
cized the Board of Education; had been
guilty of wipe conduct in plan
ning to .-,-. urefhe removal of teachers by
â¢ .'1 malicious reports
about iii. in, and 'finally demanded, on be
h'a-:f â  5 aton, compensation fur flve
ixirfqg the vacation period
â¢ of the .a were proved in
a satisfactory manner, but it seems that
the plan to discharge Kilpatrick was all
cut and dried, ana he was aismla
; â¢In.:ihe opinion of the court, none of the
charges â  lacking substantiation couid
. weigh- against the accused teacher. "Bui,
.furthermore,.- assuming that the charges'
if proven, would justify plaintiffs re
â¢ moval," reads; the' opinion, "ho was not
rded-a fair and impartial trial." The
charges against ' plaintiff were BUstained
by: a- vote -of 7 to; 3, one Director (Waller)
being excused . from voting and another
tor being absent. When upon the
trial by Ou- .bo^rd -Director Hagan was
cabled, to the stand as a witness against
Kirpatrick counsel for Kilpatrick objected
to his acting as' one of the judges. The
:tiony. however, was overruled, and
Jtagan's testimony was the only testi
mony! off ere.d -tn support of some of these
charges. ' . â¢ â¢
T.hu secretary' o"f the board testified that
before : the â¢ charges were filed he talked
â  with'Ragan .about filing them, and also
.with Gallagher, Burns and â  Waller, and
â  that they, all; thought that Kilpatrick had
been guilty oÂ£" unprofessional conduct, and
d thought .the charges ought to be
filed; Gallagher "and Burns also acted as
Judges and voted â¢â  to find plaintiff guilty.
Without' the vote at.e ither -of these three
'.men Kirpatrick could not have been re
moved from- the -department. It was ad
mitt.-d Upon the" trial in this court that
â while the. board .found ' Kilpatrick guilty
ypdh all.of-the charges, no evidence what
ever; was offered." in support of one of
them: ...."â â '
"It thus appears that upon one of those

THE AMERICAN SHIP BARING BROS.
Trouble between the officers and sailors during the voyag-3 to Japan culminated in a mutiny and
the vessel arrived at Kob? with six of the sailors in irons. The men v/tre sent to jail by the United
States Consul and the night of their release the Baring Bros, was set on fire and burned to the water's edge.
THE CHINESE
BUREAU IS
SUSPECTED
Coolie Brokers Get
the Testimony.
TELL-TALE LETTERS FOUND
SPEAK OF SHORTHAND TRANS
CRIPTS TO BE HAD.
Louis Quong of Dick Williams No
toriety Believed to Be Im
plicated in the Con
spiracy.
A scandal which may Implicate pome
person connected with the Chinese
Bureau was hinted at yesterday after
noon in the progress of an examination
which was taking place before United
States Commissioner Heacock. Certain
letters introduced in evidence intimated
that Chinese brokers encaged in the
business of landing 1 Chinese Illegally had
access to the transcripts of t< siimony
which are kept on file in the office of thn
bureau for the exclusive use of the
bureau and the Collector of the Port.
The letters, of which the orfes intro
duced in court were the translations, were
found on the person of Shew Hon, a cook,
arrested by Inspector Lynch while he was
in the act of conveying them to Chinese
immigrants on the Mail dock a few days
apo. The translations were made by Dr.
Gardiner, one of thf" official interpreters
for the bureau, and T.heir reading in court
caused quite a sensation.
Shew Hon was undergoing an examina
tion on a charge of having conspired to
land Chinese illegally, and the letters
were a part of the evidence of Inspectors
Lynch and Gardiner.
The first and most Important was ad
dressed to Tai Nin, one of the Chinese
who was attempting to land. The man
"Chow" whose name was signed to the
letter is unknown, but he is believed to be
Louis Quong, a Chinese slavebroKer, who
attained some prominence in the Dick
Williams case. Quong was present in
court yesterday as a spectator and ap
peared to be much interested in the pro
ceedings.
The following is the translation made
by Dr. Gardiner:
To Tai Ninâ Dear Plr: I ham thÂ» honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your highly esteem
ed communication together with the testimony
accompanying It. With reference to Soon Kee's
testimony, that should have been already at
tended to.
In two or three days when we
shall have obtained a copy of your
testimony given in the examination
from the white man we will see if
the testimony has been correctly
taken down. We will then proceed
accordingly, after which you will
lanu, as a matter of course. You need
feel no anxiety whatever. As to what
the American young lady asked as
to whether or not you were a Sam
Yup man that need not make any
difference. Of a certainty he will Jet
us have a copy of your testimony,
and everything can be adjusted ac
cordingly.
The Inclosed four slips containing new testi
mony, please hand personally to the different
parties and let them take their cue from them.
If you should not be acquainted with these
people ask Lee Lun of the village of Shuk
Kan (Nam Hoi District), and you will find out.
as Lee Lun Is with me In this matter. What
ever Is due you In the way of fros and trou
ble will be duly n.>t-ri.
Be sure and tell the different friends not to
let this fall under the eye of any white man.
CHOW.
Seventh month, eighth day, p. m. (August

The "white man" referred to in the fol
lowing is evidently the man who attends
to the Chinese baggage on the dock.
To Ah Ylmâ Pear Sir: Up to the present
your testimony 1b very good. I write so that
you need be no longer anxious. Whatever you
nnd the nthrrs may write, be sure not to let
the white man brlni? up, as he extorts $1 for
each letter. Whatever communication you
have for UK let Phew Hon bring up; besides he
never makes a break once In ten thousand
times. He surt and remember this. I would
have come down to inquire after your health
but for business affairs being so numerous.

Here follow the slips referred to.
Lem Tuk of Lung To, Heung Shan is to say
he has no brother-in-law and no maternal un
cle, go as to avoid much questioning.
Lee Lun of Shook Kan, Nam Hoi District,
Is to Bay he has no brother-in-law and no ma
ternal uncle: that his father died some six
years alter his return to China, which would
now be about ten years ago.
Be prepared to answer accordingly.
Wong Wan of the San Wul District is to say
he has no brother-in-law and no maternal un
cle.
This will avoid bad breaks.
Hon Qual Ho (female) father's name Ah
Wine; mother's name. Low Gum.
Kg Jung of Mm Fan, Kow K.jrryj District, Is
to say he has only one father and one mother
âno brother-in-law and no maternal uncle;
that his father died some twelve or thirteen
years after his return to China, which would
be now about four years ago.
Remember this computation of dates and It
would be all right.
On one of the envelopes was the address
In Chinese:
This Important letter to be Immediately taken
to the Mail dockâ to the immigration shed,
above to be delivered to Lai Tal N*ln.
Thomas D. Rlordan. defending Shew
Hon. strenuously objected to the Trailing
c! the letters or to their use as evidence.
He raised the point that on the admission
of the District Attorney that one of
the Chinese had been allowed to land
no offense had been committed, and that
therefore the case against his client had
no foundation. Commissioner Heacock
Overruled the objection, and decided that
thf letters were material. The case was
then taken under advisement.
Chief Meredith of thi; Chinese Bureau
was asked later in the day whether he
was aware that copies of the testimony
taken for the use of the bureau had
been furnished to the Chinese brokers
or persons representing them. He re
plied that such could not have been the
case. The testimony is private, and no
one !s allowed to see it except the
members of the bureau and the Collect
or of the Port.
"li Is under my charge." he said, "and
I keep it locked up j n m y desk, the keys
of which I alone have. When a steamer
arrives with Chinese on board one of
my inspectors and a shorthand report
er, either Mr. Hoyt or Miss Llssak, go
there with the interpreter, and the Chi
nese are questioned. Their statements
are transcribed into long hand and are
handed to me. I keep them until they
are needed for use in the examination
of the Chinese witnesses from town. This
is an important matter, for the discrep
ancies between the statements of the wit
nesses summoned from Chinatown and
the statements made by the immigrants
on board the steamer often prevent their
landing. The only other persons hand
ling these transcripts are the Inspectors
who take them to Chinatown in making
their investigations."
Mr. Meredith expressed the belief that
the writer of the letter to Tai Nin had
inserted the significant matter about
the testimony for the purpose of in
ducing Tal Nin to believe that he, the
writer, had access to the testimony and
could land him.
Special Agent Moore of the Treasury
Department has been at work on the
case for several days, but declines to re
veal what he has discovered. For the
same period of time Colector Jackson has
been unusually serious, although In the
best of health, and has not told any of
his celebrated after-dinner jokes. This
is portentous, and there is no doubt that
he has received information ponting to
an eruption In the bureau in tho near
future.
GERMANS SING YANKEE DOODLE
Berlin Press Proclaims Our Warlike
Deeds â Commends Moderation.
The signing of the protocol engrosses
the attention of the German press, the
more serious papers and nearly all the
periodicals appearing this week being
decidedly friendly to America, unani
mously taking the view that Spain has
only herself to blame and that the con
ditions imposed by the United States
are not oxcessive. Moderation in demands
Is also the motto of Charles Lyons,

his first installment of fall goods from
Europe and has an immense line of fine
English cloths in black and blue diago
nals, serges and Scotch cheviots from
which he makes suits to order from $15 50
up. He has also a line of elegant English

NEWSBOYS IN TROUBLE.
Two Have a Fight, and One Uses a
Knife Upon the Other.
William O'Brien and Joseph Lynch,
newsboys, had a fight at Powell and Eddy
streets yesterday afternoon, and Lynch
pulled a knife out of his pocket and
stabbed O'Brien In the left arm. The
blade closed with the force of the blow
and cut Lynrh's right thumb.
Both boys were taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where their wounds were
dressed by Dr. Bunnell. Lynch was then
taken to the City Prison, where a charge
of assault with a deadly weapon was
booked against him. He lives at 27 Russ
P Lynch is a much smaller boy than
O'Brien, and he said the trouble began
about 5 cents that he borrowed from
O'Brien. He paid him back the nickel,
but later O'Brien demanded it again, and
when Lynch refused O'Brien hit him on
the face. Lynch then^ pulled out the knife.
A Clash Between Attorneys.
Attorneys J. N. E. Wilson and Eddie
Gunther came near engaging in a fistic
encounter In Justice Groezinger's court
yesterday afternoon, as the result of a
wordy war over a trivial order of ex

guage and his opponent clenched his fists
and looked fierce, but hostilities were
averted by the prompt action of the Jus
tice In Issuing a "eace protocol.

MUTINY AND
INCENDIARISM
American Ship Baring
Bros. Set on Fire.
OFFICERS AND CREW AT OUTS
WHEN KOBE WAS REACHED SIX
I4EN WERE IN IRONS.
They Were Sent to Jail and the Night
of Their Release the Ship Was
Burned to the Water's
Edge.
The well-known American ship Baring
Bros, was burned to the water's edge
In Kobe, Japan, on August 12. There was
trouble between the officers and men, and
during the run from Kobe to Yokohama
the sailors mutinied. Six of them were
put in irons and later sent to jail. Four
of them were put back aboard when their
time was up, and they are now charged
with having soa the vessel on lire.
Some particulars of the trouble on the
ship were received hero In a private letter
yesterday. The Bating Bros, mailed from
New York In December of last year, and
arrived at Yokohama In the following
May. There was more or less friction
during the voyage, and several of the j
sailors tried to desert, but failed. The
second mate was arrested for cruelty on
the high seas, but the United States Con
sul dismissed the case. After discharg- i
ing her cargo at Yokohama the Baring j
Bros, sailed for Kobe and arrived there |
on July 23 last with the police Hag flying. |
The officers and men had been at outs
again, and when the police boarded tne
ship Harry Brady, O. Paterson, John
Hine, Walter Kaguster, Jerry Carnelich
and Juan Jule were In Irons and charged
with mutiny. They were taken ashore
and tried before United States Consul S.
S. Lyon. Captain Smalley and his of
ficers testified to the general bad conduct
of the men and to their attempt at run
ning the ship. The men were found
guilty, and Carnelich and Jule, as the
ringleaders, were sentenced to thirty days
in jail, and Brady, Hine, Paterson and
Kaguster to fifteen days each. The men
were to be put back aboard the Baring
Bros, as soon as their sentences were up
or as soon as the ship was ready for sea.
The men were sent to Jail on July 27. !
and on August 11, when the time of j
Brady, Hine, Paterson and Kaguster
was up, they were ordered to go back
aboard the snip. They refused, saying the
second mate had threatened to "fix
them." They refused to walk, so they
were carried aboard and locked up In the
forecastle. That night the Baring Bros,
caught fire, and the next day (August 12)
she was burned to the water's edge. The
four men were taken back to jail, and
will be tried for setting the Baring Bros,
afire. They deny having caused the loss
of the ship but admit that they would
have gone to any length to escape mak
ing the voyage to New York in her. i
Nearly half a cargo of matting, silks and
curios was burned up with the vessel, and
as there was no insurance the loss will
be very heavy on the owners.
The Baring Bros, was well known in
San Francisco. The last time she came
here from New York shipping was very
dull and she lay tied up at Main street
wharf for a long time Before a charter
could be secured. She was built In 1877
at Thomaston, Me., by Edward O'Brien
and was 216G tons gross burden, 243 feet
7 Inches long, 42 feet 3 inches broad and
29 feet 5 inches deep. Captain Masters
of the barkentine Gardiner City, who
died here a short time ago, was in com
mand of her for years, but resigned his
command to go Into the coasting trade.
On her last trip here but one the Bar
ing Bros, struck on the bar when mak
ing port and came near being wrecked.
The lumber dealers that have been
bringing rafts here In tow of tugs In
order to save the charter of vessels re
ceived a setback yesterday. The first
one brought here from Astoria broke In
two, but luckily not a great deal of it â 
was lost. Over two weeks ago another i
one crossed the Columbia River bar in !
tow of the tug Monarch, but only about j
a half of it reached here yesterday in
tow of the tugs Monarch and Rescue.
The rest of It is scattered for miles up
and down the coast. On August 31 the
Monarch and her tow encountered a
heavy northwest swell and then the raft
began to show signs of breaking up. At
8:30 p. m. of that date, when four miles
off Point Arena, it broke in two and the
ends began to fray out. On the Ist inst.
the Rescue came along and picked up the
remains and both vessels reached port
yesterday. The remains of the raft were
taken to the Mission .Bay mud flats and
will be broken up there.
Captain Metcalf, Lloyd's surveyor,
spent an hour or so yesterday looking
over the collier Czarina. It is the inten
tion of her owners to build up her well
deck in order to make more room for
freight. From the bridge to the fore
castle will be built up. thus making the
vessel Hush from stem to stern. This
will not only improve the Czarina's looks
but will add to her carrying capacity
She took away yesterday 500 tons of
freight for Seattle and on her return
will probably be laid up in order to make
the above alteration.
The transport Zealandia has arrived at
Nagasaki, Japan, and should reach here
about the 22d inst.

PROPER FOOD FOR
THE CONVALESCENT
RED CROSS SOCIETY'S NEW DE-
PASTURE.
Another Public Meeting to Be Held
by the Local Organization
on Saturday.
The Red Cross hospital tent at the Pre
sidio has been converted into a restora
tion tent (a diet kitchen), where soldiers
may receive suitable food for convales
cents. The Red Cross always tries to do
that which is most needed, and now that
the division hospital has been improved,
after consultation with the surgeons in
charge, the San Francisco society decided
to undertake this department of the work.
The tent is situated near General Miller's
headquarters, and is rapidly being put in
order, and will be the supply department
of the society's work at the Presidio. With
a first-class cook in charge of the broths.
It will bring needed strength back to
many of the soldier boys.
It Is now unnecesary for the society to
supply the division hospital with eggs and
milk, as it has done for many weeks, as
Major Matthews can now procure them
through the Government.
At the executive session of the San
Francisco Red Cross held yesterday it
was decided to ask the State Society to
officially apply to the National Red Cross
Society, asking it to request the < rovern
ment to supply suitable rations for the
hot climates our boys are in. It has been
found that pork and beans are "-ood ra
tions for the frigid zone, but are the
cause of much unnecessary sickness and
suffering in climates like Cuba and Ma
nila.
Charles "W. Moore, 1509 Webster street.
Is greatly Interested in this subject, ana
suggests that the parents and friends of
the First California, now in Manila, make
a united effort to obtain proper food for
the boys who are not yet ill and do not
get any of the Red Cross supplies, as they
are necessarily for the sick. Friends inter
ested in this work should communicate
with Mr. Moore.
Mrs. Moore visited St. Luke's Hospital
yesterday, and reported seven patients
there. Dr. WoolSey operated on one most
successfully yesterday. C. V. Glbbs con
tinues his kindness, and is now sunniying
a special nurse for one of the patients.
The Del Monte Milling Company has
volunteered to supply all cereals needed
in the restoration tent at the Presidio.
The public meeting of the San Francisco
Red Cross will be hold on Saturday at 2
o'clock, in Century Hall, on Sutter street,
above Polk. A full report will be given
of the work of the society during the past
two months. Mrs. Louise Humphrey
Smith will give a patriotic recitation and
Miss Carolyn D. Roper will sing "My
Native Land" (by Franz yon Suppe), ac
companied by Miss Inez Straueh. All
members of the society and interested
friends .are invited to be present.
Mrs. L. Baker sent a donation of $50 to
assist in furnishing the convalescent
home at the Presidio.
New Commercial Company.

pany Incorporated yesterday with a capi
tal stock of $1,000,000, of which $375,000
has been subscribed. The directors are

TOM TRACEY WILL
MEET
THE SAGINAW KID.
â¢ T-orri Tracey, the clever and gentleman
ly". pugilist from far-away Australia, will
not have -to take a. journey in the direc
tion/of.- the rising' sun because of the in
â¢ ability- of , the leading boxing clubs of this
' city- to secure him a match. The National
. Club, which is the leading organization of
Its kind west of the Rocky Mountains, has
'scored another great success in consum-
' â¢mating a- twenty-round contest between
JTtfacey and ''Kid" Lavigne. The match
. Wae mad"' yesterday, Lavigne telegraph
ing his .acceptance. The contest will take
â place In the .latter part of October, In
â  'â¢'Xyood.ward.'.s Pavilion. Lavigne may be
â¢a" few pounds lighter than Tracey, but
'the ''Kid- has. taken on weight so rap
liTly in the past year that the difference
'â¢ between' the two clever exponents of the
â¢\ gameâ i.. c., .so far as weight is con
â cerhed^will not help either man ma
terially; .From a scientific point of view
It should be- a .contest worth going a dis
tance â¢' to. see.
.â¢â . â¢â  'The National Club will introduce the
: <?l iu've'r : bbxers Frank McConnell and
George' Green to the crowd that will at
. tend the next' event of any importance
â¢at Woodward's Pavilion, that is. on the
.evening of the 23d inst. Green will train
At the Seal Rock House and McConnell
â  *will be. looked after, by Tom Tracey at
â¢the Alametfa training station. This con
tes.t' should certainly attract quite a
gathering of â  sportlovers to the Pavilion,
: 'asit-is seldom .in the annals of the ring
'that-.tW;6. such clever exponents of tne
' game have met in a contest of twenty
. rounds.. '.The ifatlonals have also matched
"Kid"' MciÂ£adden- and Fred Maynard, who
' will box. ten rounds. Dudley Evans and
â¢" Lon.'Agnow will box ten rounds on the
same evening..' â  .
â¢ .Sporting- men who take an interest in
' boxing are jnore than pleased to see that
the. police authorities now insist that the
â managers -.of boxing clubs must pad the
". .floors of their rings properly and re
frain ffo'm introducing boxers who are
â  ptiy-sieally unable to enter Into an ath
letic contest owing to lack of condition.
If not all it can be" safely said that the
freater. number of fatalities from boxing
aye been -occasioned by fighters striking
â¢ their heads on hard floors after receiving
â a' blow which temporarily stunned them.
Borne pugilists have died from exhaustion
â¢and heart failure, evidently the result of
Inferior training. Managers of clubs
should also instruct the- seconds of con
testants to throw up the sponge in all
â¢ instances' whi-ro one of the fighters is ho
palpably beaten that his hope of winning
. Is forlorn.- There are some men who seem
ingly t like a delight in seeing a poor, un
fortunate .-pugilist hammered to death.
It is the referee's duty to stop a contest
â wJien he sees that one of the contestants
Is helplessly striving without the least
hope of success to win a victory. By al
lowing.a contest to go on when It becomes
brutal the referee is morally responsible
for the death of boxing, which is certain
to come when n pugilist dies from the ef
fect of punishment received. Managers
of boxing clubs should remember these
things and insist on the boxers being in
lit condition before they are allowed to
enter a ring.
The Alpine Club will give an entertain
ment on Monday evening at its gym
nasium on Golden Gate avenue. The pro
gramme la a good one. It includes an
eight-round bout between Jack Granfield
nnd Charlie Johnston and two six-round
bouts between Jack Ennis and Jim Hig
g!ns and Jim O'Tool and Ed Toy. The
president of the club. Gus Herg<;t, writes
the sporting editor that the floor of the
ring will have two inches of boiler felt
padding and that the boxers engaged for
the occasion are In good condition.
Big Joe Kennedy and Jack Stelzner
have been matched by the Excelsior Club
to box twenty rounds in Woodward's Pa
vilion on September 31.
C. F. Crocker's Estate.
Henry T. Scott and Charles E. Green,
executors of the will of "the late Charles
F. Crocker, filed a petition yesterday for
the partial distribution of the $5,000.000
estate of the deceased. The executors
state that all the debts against the estate
have been liquidated and in consequence
no legal obstacle stands in the way of
the property being distributed to tho
heir? at law, the three children of the de
ceased. The petition will be heard on
Wednesday, September 14.
THE FIELD OF SPORT
THREE DAYS OF
SPORT
WITH THE HOUNDS.
Judging from the great Interest that
sportsmen are taking in coursing and the
rapidity with which the game is advanc
ing, it would not surprise leashmen to see
four coursing parks established within
easy distance of this city in a year hence.
ihe Union and Ingleside parks will in
augurate three days' coursing next week,
commencing with Friday and ending with
Sunday. At Ingleside there will be a
sapling, a non-winner and an open stake
run on the three days already stated. The
entrance fee will be $2 50 for the first two
stakes and Jii entrance for the open stake.
The prizes to be coursed for will amount
to JIiXK), and it goes without saying that
the sport will prove to be very torrid.
During the intermission at Inglesido
Park on Sunday next a large number of
dogs recently owned by E. V. Sullivan
will be sold by auction. The kennel in-
eludes such well-known dogs as False
Flatterer, Royal and Flying Buck, Mira
Monte, O'Grady. Sunburst, Fear Not,
Skyball, Flying Faster, Fly Away, Pre
tender, War Cloud and several brood
bitches. There are among the longtails
six beautiful youngsters by Lawrence
Bellâ Skyrocket, which doubtless will go
under the hammer, as will also Joker,
Bona D, Conqueror and Bit of Fashion.
Possibly False Flatterer, tlie Bucks and a
few of the well-known bread winners will
not be sold.
Mr. Bell, the well-known judge, who
was engaged by E. V. Sullivan under a
five years' lease to superintend his ken
nels at a salary of $125 per month and
board, etc., will doubtless remain on deck
as a part of the agreement entered into
between Sullivan and Bell, which stated
that Mr. Bell was to receive 23 per cent
of the coin received for the sale of all
dogs belonging- to the kennels. Now
that Mr. Kenna is said to have purchased
the property of Mr. Sullivan for a good
round sum, Judge Bell, according to his
contract, would come in for a nice little
share of the money accruing from the
recent sale. Among the kennels, which
include greyhounds and bird dogs so
called, there are three or four champion
English setters in Canada which Mr. Sul
livan purchased at a very high figure last
year. All sportsmen who love to shoot
are familiar with the names of Dash, An
tonio and Lock. They are now in Mani
toba, Canada, in charge of Mr. Bennett,
who went East purposely to run them in
the big field trial meetings, but the sud
den change in the Sullivan kennels may
alter Mr. Bennett's plans and it is doubt
ful if the dogs will ever return to Cali
fornia.
Arrangements have finally been con
cluded lor the three great stakes to be
run off at Union Park on Friday, Satur
day and Sunday, September 9, 10 and 11.
They embrace the Interstate Coursing
Club in second Produce stake, winner
guaranteed $250, runner up $125 and third
dug to receive $75. A champion stake,
limited to sixteen entries, entrance fee at
$10 each, will be one of the features and
a novel idea in coursing; a selling stake
will also be decided. Entrance fee for
the stake will be $2 50, and any dog en
tered may be claimed for $150, the prizes
won by the dog to go to the purchasers.
Time set for claiming of the dogs will
be immediately before the second round
and immediately before and after the final
race is run.
Owners can protect themselves by bid
ding in their own dog. Fifty per cent of
the amount realized in excess <>f the limit
of $150 will be divided as follows: Twen
ty-five' per cent to go to the Union Park
Association and 25 per cent to be divided
equally among the owners of dogs beaten
by the dog sold.
Bartel Bros, of Denver shipped on Au
gust 19. in charge of John Spencer, some
high class dogs to California. Among
them are Hughie, by Sir Sankey and Miss
Crookshanks. a half brother of For Free
dom, and said to be a wonderful per
former; two Wiprmore-Winning Style sap
lings and two Bohomian-P.oscobel sip
lings. They will be seen shortly at Union
Park.
Among R. L. Taylor's ptrinsr of sixteen
hounds are Master Denmark (Mainspring-
May Day), Chow Chong (Master Den
mark-Just In). lone Attls (Prince Terra-
Llzzle Dell), Nick Twin (Trales Jr.-Lady
H), Lizzie Dell (Norwegian-Snowball),
Lucerne (Master Denmark-Just In), Win
ning Lassie (Wigmore-Winning Style)
and Bonfire and Lady C.
A prominent attorney of this city has
purchased Lord Seattercash. by Lord
Neversettle-White Lips, and â¢will run
him shortly at Union Park. The dog ar
rived from the East recently.
The largest purchase of dogs ever re
corded was made recently by cable to
England. Some time since a commission
was sent to England to purchase some
crackajacks able to beat For Freedom.
AMONG THE LOCAL
WILLOW-WIELDERS
The fifth two days' match of the sea
son between the representatives of the
Alameda and Pacific cricket clubs will
begin to-morrow at the Golden Gate
ground. The Pacific team has been much
strengthened by the return to San Fran
cisco of H. H. Cookson. formerly one of
the mainstays of the Bohemian Club. It
is now about a year since Mr. Cookson
has been seen on a local cricket ground.
During that time he has visited British
Columbia, and feels sure that the San
Francisco clubs could make up a team
that would hold its own against any
eleven on Vancouver Island or the main
land. The cricketers there are anxious
to measure their strength against the
Californians, and next season arrange
ments may be made for a team to be sent
up north.
The Pacific eleven to-morrow will be
made up of E. F. Musson. captain;
(Jporgo Theobald, J. J. Theobald, Charles
Taylor, J. H. Harbour, Fane Sewell, H.
H. Cookson. T. W. G. Wallace. C. P.
Coles, J. H. McLean and 11. P. G. Gor
don.
The Alameda team will consist of R. B.
Hogue, captain; J. J. Moriarity, G. I.
Baugh, I. H. Spiro, J. J. R. Peel, J. H.
Saunders, A. Price, F. C. Driffleld, F. J.
Croll, B. Bird and V. Seebeck. F. Stahl
reserve.
September 18 and 25 it is proposed to
play a two days' match between repre
sentatives of the cities of Alameda and
San Francisco. The teams would be very
fairly matched and tho game should be
quite interesting.
Harold Richardson, a former member
of the Pacific Cricket Club, is now in
England, and has been playing in the
Surrey County second eleven. In a ro
cent match against Wiltshire he made
upward of fifty runs. E. A. Mutch, for
merly of the Pacific eleven, is now a
member of the Los Angeles Cricket Club,
as also is E. Cawston, formerly of the
Bohemians. W. S. Robertson, for a long
time the strongest player in California,
has fully sustained his reputation since
his return to Australia.
Guilty of Contempt of Court.
J. F. Turner was adjudged guilty of
contempt of court by Judge Troutt yes
terday and sentenced to five days' im
prisonment in the County Jail. Turner
fiiiled to conform with an order of court,
directing him to submit to examination
under oath concerning the estate of Al
fred Clarke in insolvency.

"ways" to arrange for the removal of
the club "ways" from Menotti's yard,
and for their erection on some suitable
site.
The hop In the club house set for Sep
tember 3 is to be consolidated with the
dance to be given on the 25th, and a
moonlight cruise to Petaluma draw
bridge substituted. As Commodore Dr.
T. L. Hill intends to sail to the oyster
beds to-morrow, the club cruise will be
in charge of Vice-Commodore G. T. S.
White.
On September 8 Commodore Dr. T. L.
Hill will sail to McNear's landing, and
on the 9th up to Napa City, returning
on the 10th to Vallejo, and on the 11th
witnessing the Corinthian small yacht
regatta off El Campo. The commodore
hopes to be accompanied by Port Cap
tain Dr. A. W. McKÂ«szie's launch Al
berta, the yawl Phyllis, and the sloops
Will o' the Wisp, Twilight and Cather
ine.
Last Saturday the launch Alberta, with
an ample supply of provender, started
for the oyster-beds, but spent the night
In the soft mud near Bay Farm Island.
On Sunday the party returned in disgust
to the olub house at Sausalito.
Last Saturday A. D. Naylor and G. T.
S. White started from Sausalito in the
sloop Twilight, but pot only as far as
Tiburon cove. On Sunday they returned
to Sausalito and took Measurer J. M.
Punnett and some ladles out for a sail.
Dr. Hill cruised in the sloop Cygnus to
El Campo. The schooners Chispa and
La Paloma were sailing in the upper
bay; the former came to anchor near the
Pacific Yacht Clubhouse, and the latter
made for Oakland Creek.
The Corinthian cruise to Petaluma
drawbridge last Sunday was very suc
cessful. The sloops Truant, Ella, Pride,
Aeolus, Edna, Amigo and Mignon got up
to tho bridge, while the sloops Thetis
and Freda and the yawl Nereid came to
anchor in the creek. Tho sloop Nixie
started from Tiburon, but dropped her
hook at McNear's.
On the 11th the Corinthians will hold
a regatta open to all yachts on the bay
not exceeding 24 feet on the load water
line. The yachts will be divided into
two classesâ first, yachts exceeding 10
feet, but not exceeding 24 feet; second,
yachts not exceeding 10 feet. There will
be no time allowances, and a single gun
will be the starting signal. Yachts should
reach Paradise cove on the forenoon of
the 11th, and their captains must report
on board Commodore C, AVesterfeld's
flagship Aeolus before 11:30 a. m., that
they may be supplied with racing num
bers and receive Instructions with re
gard to the course. Cups will be given
as first prizes and flags as second prizes
in each class. The regatta committee
having the races In hand is composed of
J. H. Hopps, P. J. Martensteln and W.
F. Dixey.
The Encinal Yacht Club ladles' cruise
to San Mateo, scheduled for Sunday and
Monday, has been dropped. The schoon
er Flora, formerly owned by Dr. C. L.
Tisdale, president, is now the property
of the boat-keeper of the Encinals.
About a week ago Dr. C. M. Pond and
Miss lln 11 went out for a sail in her; she
capsized, and all three had a narrow es
cape from drowning.
The Callfornias. under the command of
Vice-Commodore Edgar of the sloop Sap
pho, cruise to Martinez to-day, returning
to-morrow. The yachts expected to join
the cruise are the Embla, Idler, Mist,
Surf, Seafox, Regina, U & I, Bachelor
Gypsie, Hope, Verona and Royal. The
launches Ariel, Augusta and El Casador
may also take part.
All the clubs except the San Francisco
(which did not Join the association until
after the season had begun) have the
9th "open" on their programmes. The
South Bays will cruise to San Francisco
to witness the association regatta-

WHAT ANGLERS
AND
NIMRODS ARE DOING
Sportsmen who select Marin County In
which to hunt large game should remem
ber that the season when deer can be
lawfully killed will terminate on the 15th
inst. , which is one month earlier than
the general law allows.
The sportsmen of the Tamalpais and
Country clubs enjoyed a very successful
season, and the number of deer seen were
far in excess of former years, which
proves that protection assists very mate
rially to increase the deer family.
It was Judge Conlan and not Judge
Mogan, as stated In yesterday's Call, who
taught the game butcher, J. P. Corraea,
a well merited lesson by imposing upon
him a fine of $100 for having wild duck,
killed during the close season, In his pos
session. Corraea's attorney. It Is said,
will appeal the case, If the law speaka
the truth the transgressor will save to
himseif time and money by paying his
tine and doing better In future. Judge
Conlan will have the resnect and support
of the sportsmen of this city and State
for the action he has taken In punishing
offenders of the game laws. Other Judges
should emulate his example and put a
stop to the rapid depletion of game by
unprincipled market hunters by imposing
a line upon all offenders..
The California Fish Commission has
scored another victory by landing the
fourth llsh dynamiter in a manner that
he will not soon forget. For a long time a
gang of Portuguese have been destroying
lish of all kinds in the Russian River by
exploding giant powder in the deep pools.
Such of the finny tribe as they wanted
they would take away, but there wer â¢ a
lot of small fry and other fish that they
would leave floating on the water. So
great was the quantity thus left that the
stench of decaying fish could at times be
noticed for miles along the stream.
A deputy captured three of these de
stroyers recently and they were convict
ed, but the leader of the gang, Joe
Payo, managed to escape and it was not
until a week or so ago that he was cap
tured. On Saturday he was taken before
the Justice of the Peace in Ukiah and
found guilty by a jury. He was sentenced
to pay a fine of $50 or in default thereof
serve a term of 150 days in the County
Jail. The total fines of the four have
amounted to $1000 and it is believed that
this will be a lesson to that class of fish
destroyers,
Koss & Hewlett, commission merchants,
received yesterday from Charles Cooley,
who is hunting and fishing at Point
Arena, a beautiful spiked buck that
dressed 121 pounds. The hunter in a note
to Mr. Ross states that grilse of from
one pound to three pounds weight are
now running into the Garcia River, and
tnat local anglers are enjoying great
spooning for them near the river's mouth.
Johnny Coleman is expected back from
the East In a few days, but before his re
turn he will drop off at Boca and with his
friend, Fred Bushnell. he will whip the
Truckee River good and hard and also
pay his respects to White Rock Lake.
Dr. Chalmers is looking forward to
some grand fishing and shooting on Sal
mon Bay in Oregon. The doctor will also
try to locate some of the Oregon grouse
and pheasants.
Fish Commissioner Gould has been on
the Truckee River for some days past.
He will have all obstructions between
Truckee and Pyramid Lake removed this
year, and In his efforts he will bo assisted
by the prominent officials and sportsmen
of Nevada.
Phil Wand and Phil Fay are enjoying
great fishing and hunting at John Day's
resort In Mendoctno County, but they
have not as yet sent any venison steaks
to their friends.
W. Blanchard, an amateur, will shoot
a match with C. E. Thomas of Shasta,
25 birds at 25 yards, for $50. J. E. oteven
son, trap setter; A. H. Neal. jud^e. To
be shot at Colma to-morrow, September
4. The winner will be open to a match
with any amateur on the Pacific Coast
for from $.">0 to $500. Money can be found
with JamM Kelly at *>27 Folsom street.
The final shoot of the Golden Gate Club
will take place to-morrow at Pacific
Tournament Association irrounds, com
mencing at 10 a. in. The club meeting
will be held at 423-27 Market street on
September 12 at 8 p. m.
THE LINKS ARE
DRAWING
SOCIETY FOLK.
Golf is the king sport among society
folk at present, and It will not descend
from its royal pedestal until the wet
weather commences. The three centers
of activityâ San Rafael, Del Monte and
Oaklandâ are seething with golf talk and
the possibilities in the tournaments whloh
will be held during the next week.
The interest at Del Monte is on the in
crease. Every day the enthusiasts are
rounding the links, and some very good
work has been done by Instructor Rob
ertson in teaching the new golfstlck
wlelders the first rudiments of the game.
At San Rafael a club will be organized
this evening, In which one of the leading
members will be Judge William W. Mor
row. This organization will have its.
links in "Happy Valley," where the play
ing goes on from morning until night.
The Oakland club has arranged for a
series of events to be played on Admis
sion day. This club is the most active of
all the various bay organizations, and
numbers among its members the very
best players of the coast. The San Fran
cisco club, with links at the Presidio, has
done little work on home grounds, as
most of the members have been away for
the summer. The links are in pretty bad
shape, the result of the incessant drilling
of the soldiers on their territory.
The great days for golfers will be next
Friday and Saturday, when tournaments
will be held at San Rafael and Oakland.
On the former links a tournament for
gentlemen and ladies will take place,
suitable prizes being awarded the win
ners. At Oakland there will be an open
handicap. Some of the events will be
putting, driving, mixed foresomes and
ioresomes for gentlemen. Last Saturday
a team of OakTanders played on the San
Rafael links against the pick of that
club. To-day the same team will go to
Burllngame and meet the strength of that
settlement. The visiting teams will com
prise the following: Messrs. Bowles,
Pierce, McNear, Wheaton, Fitzgerald,
Greenwald and Miller.
The prominent golfers at the present
time number a legion, some of the most
noted of whom are: J. A. Folger, Mr.
and Mrs. F. Ryer, Mr. and Mrs. C. si.
Alexander, Captain Payson. Julius Krutt
schnltt, Mr. and Mrs. Will Tubbs, Fred
and Walter Magee, Mrs. C. B. Worden,
Miss Evelyn Wood, Miss Grace Barton,
Lansing fcellogg. Hugh Tevis, Henry
Simpklns, L. Brutruiere, Miss Carrie Tay

Morton Mitchell. Barton Parker. Mrs. F.
A. Frank, Dr. ArnolcTand Marcus Gerstle.
"Wills Filed for Probate.
The will of Dominico Righettl, who died
on the 29th Bit., leaving an estate valued
at $16,000, was filed for probate yester
day. The estate is bequeathed relatives
of the deceased. The will of Simeon
Step, who died on the 17th lnst., was also
filed. An estate vaJÂ«ed at about $5000 is
bequeathed George Henderick of this city.

SAN JOSE CYCLE
MEET ON
ADMISSION DAY.
Local wheelmen who are interested in
the racing game expect a good day's
sport at the annual meet of the Garden
City Wheelmen at San Jose next Friday,
In conjunction with the Native Sons' cel
ebration. The entries for the races closed
yesterday. There is a big field of start
ers, and as many of the cracks are en
tered and the track is in its old-time
form, record breaking may be looked for.
The handicaps will be announced by Han
dicapper Smyth in a few days.
The Terminal City Wheelmen of Stock
ton have recently elected the following
officers: L. F. Salbach, president; A.
Ruhl, vice-president; Fred Krumb, sec
retary; Carl Steinhart, treasurer; Otto
Salbach, collector; E. Tremaine, captain;
T. W. Hummel, trustee.
The regular monthly meeting of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs
will be held this evening at 8 o'clock at
the rooms of the Olmpic Club Wheelmen.
The amendments presented at the meet
ings of June and July will be considered
for final action.
The members of the San Francisco
Road Club held an enjoyable yacht ride
last Sunday. The club has two good men
entered in the San Jose races, Ralph
Robinson and M. G. r rancis, and much
is expected of them, particularly of Rob
inson.
George P. Wetmore has been seriously
111 for a week past, and had to be re
moved from his roojns at the Bay City
Club to a hospital. His condition is se
rious, brain fever being the diagnosis of
the doctors, and his many friends are
much concerned over his condition.
A. H. Agnew, the well-known racing
man, was, elected captain of the Acme
Club Wheelmen last Wednesday evening.
The annual meeting of the Bay City
Wheelmen was held Thursday evening.
The reports of the various officers show
ed the club to be In splendid condition.
A nominating committee, consisting of
James A. Watters, E. N. Crelgh, Gus
Fleissner, E. T. Mervey, Henry L. Day,
Joseph M. Nye Jr. and David McT. Mar
shall, was chosen to name the officers
and directors for the ensuing year. They
will meet for this purpose next Monday
night at the club house.
A great deal of interest in the joint
ciub run between the Olympic Club
Wheelmen and Bay City Wheelmen is
being manifested among the members of
the two clubs, and It promises to be the
largest affair of its kind held this sea
son. The destination will be Mission San
Jose, where the cyclers will be enter
tained by Messrs. Â»Â»iontealegre, Gallegos
and Salazar, members of the two- clubs.
The event will take place on Sunday,
September 25.
The annual 20-mile road race of the Cal
ifornia Associated Cycling Clubs for the
beautiful Baker & Hamilton trophy will
be held Sunday, September 18. The event
will probably be contested by the
Acmes, Bay Cltys, Olympics, Garden
Citys and Imperials.
The Olym- 1 " club Wheelmen will hold a
five-mile road race over the San Leandro-
Huywards course on Sunday, Septem
ber 11.
J. E. Wing will make an attempt
against the ten-mile record over the
Kruitvale-Haywards road to-morrow.
With proper pacing the general opinion
is that he will lower the existing mark
of 24:27 by a considerable margin.
E. J. Smith of the Acme Wheelmen has
been restored to the amateur ranks by
Chairman Welch of the racing board.
Smith can now compete at San Jose and
in the 20-mlle.
Chairman Welch states that his com
mittee will take a firm stand against al
lowing local men to compete in the com
ing indoor tournament at the Pavilion if
It Is held under League of American
Wheelmen rules. The association will
discuss this matter at Its mcetlne to
night. While the prospect of seeing
Michael, Bald and other cracks named
by the promoters is very alluring, the
impression seems to be that the best of
the men slated may not come, and if only
the second-raters are brought out and
no local men allowed to compete the ven
ture will prove a frost.
H. W. SPALDING.
DEATH OF THE WELL
KNOWN MASTIFF LOLA
Mrs. J. P. Norman's mastiff bitch, Lola
(A. K. C, S. 8., 37,547), died on August
31, leaving six pups to bewail their par
ent. This magnificent nnlmal was the
winner of more prizes than any other
specimen of the breed on the coast, and
was repeatedly awarded the special for
best brood bitch. The sympathy of all
dog lovers will be extended to the sorrow
ing owner, who regrets the loss of a de
voted and vigilant friend. Ptomaine poi
soning was the cause of death.
Misfortunes seem to dog the footsteps
of the Belmont kennels, inasmuch as
Chlno Don (A. K. C, S. 8., 40,560). J. p.
Norman's mastiff dog has also joined the
great majority. Among many prizes
gained by him, that for the best stud
dog was the one he could safely reckon,
on winning.
Another sound mastiff bitch has passed
away in M. D. Garrett's Bess 11. Al
though not seen of late on the bench, she
was formerly quite conspicuous, and
gained many prizes.
L. W. Neustadter has presented his
mastiff dog Tiger to H. Boyd. Tiger, it
will be remembered, is the dog that near
ly killed a Great Dane, twice as heavy
as himself, at Tahoe, to prevent the lat
ter from biting a little girl. Mr. Neu
stadter's account of the Incident presents
a vivid impression to the listener of the
mastiff's devotion to his young friend.
George Allender has undertaken the
training of two setters for the Derby, the
property of Mr. Post of Sacramento, and
will, next week, assume the charge for
the same event of Robert Gardner s two
setters.
Fred Butler has painted a truly lifelike
portrait of Count Gladstone IV, the Ver
ona Kennel's great English setter. The
painting will be placed on exhibition In
Vlckery's window on Post street on Tues
day next, and those who admire the char
acteristic delineation of animal life
should not fall to view this one. Mr. But
ler seems to have caught the "Count's"
expression to an iota.
There is a general complaint of the
scarcity of well-broken and well-bred set
ters and pointers. Plenty of specimens
possessing one or the other qualifications
are extant, but to find both in unison
seems to be at present an impossibility.
HYRUP STILL AT LARGE.
A Gay Life Led to Embezzlements
From His Employers.
The police have not yet been able to lo
cate Walter O. Hyrup, who is wanted on
charges of embezzlement preferred by his
employers, W. P. Fuller & Co., and it Is
believed that he has left the city.
Hyrup has a record. Six years ago ne
was employed in the claim auuitlng de
partment of Goodall, Perkins & 10., and
irregularities having been discovered n
his accounts he was discharged. Since
then he had been employed on a morning
paper and with the Market-street Rail
road Company, nnd his services had to be
dispensed with for similar reasons.
He has figured prominently in social
affairs in Alameda for some months, and
it is supposed that he embezzled from W.
P. Fuller & Co. to keep in the swim.

GOOD SPORT IN
PROSPECT
AMONG OARSMEN.
Now that the Oakland City Council has
appropriated $80,000 for dredging Lake
Merritt and improving Its shores, the
oarsmen of the bay can look forward to
having smooth waters on which to hold
regattas and championship races. On
completion of the projected improvements
It is hoped that a grand aquatic carnival
may be given next year on July 4 instead
of the usual Independence day celebra
tion. Oarsmen will be Invited to come
from Stockton, Portland, Astoria, Van
couver and Victoria, B. C. Dr. McDowell,
the well-known sculler of Chicago, will re
ceive an invitation. A conference with
regard to this project will be held be
tween the Pacific Association of the Ama
teur Athletic Union and citizens of Oak
land disposed to further the plan. The
regatta committee would take charge of
the aquatic events and would undertake
to furnish races such as have never been
seen on the waters of San Francisco Bay.
The members of the Alameda Boating
Club are much pleased at the success of
the senior barge crew at the Astoria re
gatta, and will give the returned oarsmen
a reception at the clubhouse to-night.
The committee in charge of the reception
consists of E. M. Hunter (captain), C. W.
Knowlos, Charles Pesoll, C. G. Ayers and
F. S. Cone. Invitations have been Issued
to the San Francisco rowing clubs.
The management of El Campo has made
a proposition to the regatta committee of
the Pacific Association for championship
races to be rowed there. Though the offer
is not entirely satisfactory, there is little
doubt that a championship regatta will
be held at El Campo early In October. By
that time the summer winds will have
ceased and smooth water may be ex
pected.
The Pioneer Rowing Club will hold Its
regular monthly meeting to-morrow, and
will elect several new members. C. Ochs
will row In the championship races, and
believes that he can beat A. W. Pape or,
any other skiff man. Sullivan will lend
his boat to Ochs for the races. The Pio
neers will have representatives in the
junior and senior skiff races and in the
Junior and intermediate barge events.
The Dolphins rowed their new barge
around from Twigg Bros.' yard to their
own boathouse on Sunday. She is strong
ly built, rows smoothly and easily and
turns rapidly. She is fast, and, though
somewhat cranky, an excellent boat In
rough water. The intermediate crew goes
out for practice on Tuesday and Thurs
day evenings and Sunday morning. It
consists of Victor Caglieri. bow; F.
Schwarting, No. 2; W. O. Patch, No. 3; A.
W. Pape, stroke; and E. Bartman, cocks
wain. The junior barge crew has been
broken up by the death of T. J. Hopkins
and the departure of E. J. Bartman, who
is now working on the steamship Austra
lia. F. Woernner and C. M. Farrell are
left, and two new men may be put in
to fill up the crew.
It is probable that A. TV. Pape will not
enter the championship skiff race at El
Campo. but will practice shell rowing.
T. R. Keenan has repaired Patch's shell,
and both he and Pape have permission to
use it for practice. Keenan will probably
enter for the senior shell championship.
A. Rothkopf has given to Pape the shell
that Len Hausler formerly used. Hausler
has not yet handed over the medal in his
possession to the Dolphin Club, but steps
will be taken for its recovery. It is pro-
Eosed that a series of three races shall
c held between Patch and Pape for the
medal. The Dolphins will hold a ladles'
day on Sunday, October 30. and will give
an entertainment in Native Sons' Hall on
November 2.
Sunday was a busy day at the South
End Rowing Club house. R. McArthur
and G. Bates were out in skiffs; the latter
will try for the junior skiff championship.
The junior barge crew will be made up of
C. Jenkins, bow; V. Koster, No. 3; W.
Barry, stroke, and a fourth man not yet
chosen. The Midgets will row in the
senior barge championship, and feel sure
that they can beat the Alamedas over the
El Campo course. They attribute their
defeat at Astoria to the fact that their
stakeboat had drifted down two lengths
and that on the way to the finishing line
they had to contend against a strong cur
rent, while the Alamedas gained greatly
on the turn and kept a good course in
slack water. The Midgets think they will
be handicapped by having to use an in
ferior barge, but expect to make up for
that disadvantage by superior condition
and better style. J. Foley will row In the
senior shells and C. C. Dennis will try to
defeat Pape. J. Lyons and M. Breen will
row In skiffs. Among the new members
of the club are Victor Koster, F. Crook
and John Williams, who are all athletic
men and enthusiastic about rowing.
The Ariels have two crews in training.
The Lynch crew is now made up thus:
E. McDonough. bow; A. Haughton, No. 2;
F. Lamonte. No. 3, and E. Lynch, stroke.
The Turners' crew consists of F. Loth,
bow; "W. Oechsle, No. 2; W. Haustein,
No. 3, and C. Haas, stroke. J3oth crews
are working steadily and Stevenson, their
coach, notes a decided improvement in
their rowing.
The Wilson crew, which defeated the
Dolphins at the last Xl Campo regatta,
has also begun to train. G. Steffens hav
ing met with an accident, his place at No.
3 has been taken by James O'ConnelL It
will enter the intermediate barge race.
W. McCausland will give up skiff row
ing and will devote his attention to shell.
He will work to retain the shell cham
pionship which he now holds. The Ariel
colors will be carried by Frank Wilson in
the senior skiff race and by J. Fickert in
the junior skiff event.
OARSMEN ARE GRATEFUL.
Members of Local Clubs Send Reso
lutions of Thanks to the As-
toria Regatta Committee.
The four San Francisco Bay clubs
which sent oarsmen to compete at the
recent Astoria regatta were the Ala
medas, the Dolphins, the Pioneers and
South Ends. In recognition of the kind
treatment and cordial reception of their
representatives, a committee composed
of leading members of these clubs has
drawn up the following resolutions to be

The prospects for. a- team., are fatrLy

than creation.- Cochran oegan his labors
in the spring and' he' will continue in the
same path until, the' end of the- .season.
Just now- there are grave doubts who will
and who will- not return, to. co.Ueee. The
students count on some gpod-men for tiio
line. The new acquisition. C.adwalader,.
formerly center of Yale, is. undoubtedly
the best line material that has been, en
rolled under the blue, and gold standards
for several years. The former Inefficiency
of the line on account of a lack of big
men to oppose the strength and weight of
the famous Stanford trio seems now in a.
fair way to be. wiped out. Greisberg is
slated to play one of the tenter posi
tions, Cadwalador another . and a Po
mona giant, about 210 pounds net, the
third place. This - wii. change the entire
order of things. For tackles there is a
strong belief- that Simpson and Pringlo
will again return to. the lime-crossed neld.
The candidates for end. are quite numer
ous and the material -.of, fair working 1

less experience are Hopper for. quarter.
Thane, Wolf, and Smith, who has just
entered from Hoitfs ' School. Captain
Percy Hall. the. bright., glittering, star of
the last intercollegiate game, is devoting
most of his time to the sifting of mate
rial and the plying of- a persuasive tongue
to induce the football possibilities to come,
out and try for the team. â¢ â  . â¢ , -.
The team that Stanford, sent to vic
tory last year is disrupted.. The nonpa
reil center. Burnett. Carle and Fickert,
has gone three, separate Ways, and there
is no possibility of a convergence at Palo
Alto or any other place this fall. Fick
ert, & post graduate, is disqualified on
account of the four years.* limit. Bur
nett is thinking of the insurgents at Ma.
nila, and Carle is holding out against
the protestations of a worshipful student
body. Rice and Thomas, the tackles of.
'98, are not at college. There Is some.ex
cellent substitutional material, but it
will have to be formed into a team,
which is a task of considerable labor.
Ballentine, Rusk, James, Bigelow, Car
son and Harrington are . names
that will possibly be seen in the line-up
of the Stanford eleven of '98. The. fresh
man class has not been exploited yet,
'for Stanford does, not really >>Kin its
fall semester until the. middle of Septem

University of Carfornia. .Harry Cross,

The third team which will play the col
leges in the early games of the season
will undoubtedly be- the Olympics, though
there is a faint possibility of it being the
Reliance. The entire matter hinges on
the question of. proportion of gate re
ceipts. The Olympic Club "will put a team
in the field if "the college managers will
agree to allow the club team the net
receipts of every game played. The
Olympians contend that it will be impos
sible to put in a team otherwise. The
expense is so great for them during the
season that they must have all the re
turns of the athletic club-college con
tests. Manager Pritchard of Stanford
has not yet returned to college, and no
meeting can be had until he arrives. An
other difficulty besetting the Olympic
Club is the tangle ovy election. The
manager of the team V'iH undoubtedly
have to come from the new board which
will not be elected until the latter part
of the month. But the football material iri
the club are ambitious, and they are talk
ing things over. There will be on the rolls
Smith, Sexton, Hobbs, Sheehy, Middh
mas, Code, Morse and a number of othf-r
heavy weights. The rub comes in the
search for lighter men for the ends and
back of the line.

from the mark. The filly has started in
eleven races, winning seven of them, and
being third once. T.ius It Wi.. be seen
that she Is well worth the sum it is hint
ed McCormick paid.
A rumor has gained currency that the

PENSION FRAUDS.
Notaries Public and Other Officials
Warned Against Laxity.
Owing to frequent and various viola
tions of the law and Pension Bureau reg
ulations by man- notaries public and
other officials, before whom pensioners
execute vouchers for their quarterly pay
ment of pension. Pension Commissioner
Evans has Issued the following circular:
Recent investigation had by this bureau to
ascertain the methods employed by public offi
cials In executing pension vouchers has demon-
Btrated an almost total disregard of the laws
and regulations governing the subject.
It is clearly evidenced, that the illegal, lax.
Indifferent and perfunctory procedure now ex
tant has become a menace to the proper and
safe conduct of the affairs of this bureau, so
far as It relates to the payment of pensions,
ami (.pedal efforts are contemplated to correct
th \Vn7ie F Vt l lis "believed that many officials who
assist In the execution of pension vouchers
have no conception of their criminal liability
in the premises, it is equally certain that many
others to secure an advantage in the numerical
number of their clientage knowingly and will
fully resort to violations of the law.
To the end that the former class may profit
by this notice, this circular is issued.
There can be no Justification in the prevalent
haste and laxity existing In many offices, by
which post-dating, false certification, false
claim and "stock" witnesses have become a
factor in the administration and acknowledg
ment of pension vouchers.
It is the intention of this bureau, where the
facts warrant such action, to Institute criminal
proceedings against the parties who Indulge
Fn these illegal and irregular- practices, and
they* are warned accordingly. â â 'â  -
By following strictly the Instructions printed
on "each voucher, the matters complained of
may be entirely remedied. Very respectfully.

dropped another game to Pittsburg, princl

like mutiny. Rusie pitched one inning,
but was too flick to continue. Meekln,
for some reason, would not take his place,
and Joyce went out to Seymour In right
field and tried to get him to go to the box.
Cy also refused, and while the argument
was going on Doheny volunteered. Al
though he pitched yesterday and went In

work, but was given miserable support.

"I am feeling perfectly well and have

the fight with McCoy, I have not made up
my mind whether to fight on October 1 or
not, and cannot tell until I have talked It
over with Considlne. I am still in the
business, though, and mean to give every
body a chance. I want to thank the mem

kindly expressions of sympathy with me
in my bereavement."

A Parson's Predicaments.
Rev. Charles uilward Locke lectured to
a large audience In Central M. E. Church
last night on "The Parson, His Parish,
His Privileges and His Predicaments."
While the first portion of the lecture was
interesting, the "predicaments" were far
more popular, aB Mr. Locke has a good
fund of anecdotes which he guarantees
to be true, but are none the less amusing
because they are true. The lecture was
given under the auspices of the King's
Daughters' circles.
IMAGINED HE
WAS A BOXER
Clever Ruse to Rob a
Stranger.
PANDERED TO HIS CONCEIT
ALEX. WHEATLEY OF LOS AN
GELES THE VICTIM.
Four Men Lured Him to a Boom,
Knocked Him Senseless by a
Blow on the Jaw and
Bobbed Him.
Alexander Wheatley of Los Angeles
until Tuesday night imagined himself
something of a boxer, but now he is of
a different opinion, and will think twice
before he offers to engage in a mlxup
with a stranger.
Wheatley arrived in the city Tuesday
night and started out to "do the tender
loin." While drinking in a saloon he met
James Green, Victor Legay, Tim Dona
hue and Michael Rackett, who spend
their time In looking out for a "good
thing." They had several drinks to
gether, Wheatley bearing the expense and
foolishly displayed lots of coin.
Along about midnight Wheatley con
fided to his newly found friends that he
was a "bit of a boxer," and nothing
would please him better than to have an
opportunity to show his proficiency.
Donahue said he would accommodate
him, and led him to a cheap lodging-house
on Dupont street, between Bush and
Pine, where a room was engaged.
Wheatley had about $300 in his vest
pocket, and when they entered the room
he pulled off his coat and vest and threw
them on the bed. Donahue threw off his
coat, and after Legay and Rackett had
been appointed seconds and Green ref
eree, Wheatley put himself in a fighting
attitude. Then something struck him on
the jaw, and he fell to the floor senseless.
When he recovered he was aione in the
room, and his money, his gold watch and
chain, a diamond collar button and two
diamond shirt studs had disappeared.
He did not report the matter to the
police till Thursday, and that night Legay
was arrested by Detectives Gibson. Wren
and Dlnan. Yesterday morning Wheat
ley called at the City Prison and identi
fied Legay, and a charge of grand larceny
was booked against him. Wheatley went
before Judge Joachimsen and swore out
â warrants for the arrest of Green, Donahue
and Rackett on a similar charge, and the
detectives are searching for them.
Wheatley suffered severely from the
blow on the jaw, which was badly swol
len yesterday. He is living at 1613 Myrtle
street, Oakland.
BRUTALITY OF A
POUND OFFICIAL
USED HIS REVOLVER ON A
CITIZEN.
Also Convicted of Using Vulgar Lan
guage and Ordered Into Cus
tody for Sentence With
out Bail.
Frank Tyrrell, a deputy poundkeeper,
was convicted by Judge Mogan yesterday
on the charge of using vulgar language
and was ordered Into custody without ball
to appear for sentence this morning.
The evidence showed that Tyrrell
Wednesday evening went into the butcher
shop of G. Tassi. 233 Fifth street, to cap
ture a valuable water spaniel belonging
to Tassi. The shop was crowded with
ladles at the time. Tyrrell grabbed hold
of the dog and Tassi protested. Tyrrell
pulled out a revolver and made use of
most disgusting language that shocked
the ladies.
Even in court Tyrrell made use of lan
guage that brought down upon his head
the wrath of the Judge. In convicting
him the Judge said that citizens must be
protected from a "big bully like you,"
looking squarely at Tyrrell, and he for
one would put a stop to it.
There Is also a charge of assault with
a deadly weapon pending against Tyrrell
in Judge Megan's court. The complain
ing witness is Gottlieb Katz, a resident of
the San Bruno road. Sunday afternoon
Tyrrell impounded a number of goats.
Including two belonging to Katz. Katz
followed his pets, and when they strayed
into a vacant lot he went after them.
Tyrrell rushed at him and hit him on the
head with the butt of his revolver, knock
ing him unconscious.
Not satisfied with that Tyrrell had Katz
arrested for battery. The case was tried
before Judge Conlan Wednesday, and was
dismissed. Katz at once swore out a
warrant for Tyrrells arrest on the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.

The "Pro-American."
Senor A. Rlbas has begun the publica
tion of a monthly Journal entitled "Pro-
America." It Is devoted principally to
the creation of better relations between
Mexico, Central and South American
countries and the United States, and ably
advocates the annexation not only cf the
Philippines, but of Cuba. The arguments
ure made from the standpoint of a man
who knows whereof he writes, and should
accomplish much in enlightening our
Latin neighbors as to the real aims and
policies or Uncle Sam. The paper is
handsomely printed, well edited and has
a healthy appearance in a business way.

"I had a strong- appetite for liquor
which was the beginning of the breaking
down of my health. I waa also a slave
to tea and coffee drinking. I took the
gold cure, but It did not help me."
This Is a portion of an Interview clipped
from the Dally Herald of Clinton, lowa,
It might well be taken for the subject of
a temperance lecture, but that Is not
our object In publishing It. It is to show
how a system, run down by drink and
disease, may be restored. We cannot do
better than quote further from the same:
. "For years I was
unable to do my
work. I could not
sleep nights or rest
days on account of
continuous pains in
my stomach and
back. I was unable
to digest my food.
Headaches ,â¢ and
painful ;.-.. urination
were frequent, | and
my t heart's action
became - i increased.
I left my farm and
retired to city
life, for I was a
confirmed Invalid,
and the doctors
said I would never
be well r again.
"Soon after I
happened to use
four boxes of Dr.
Williams' Pink
Pills for Pale Peo
ple and wince " then
F hnvu hppn frpn
from all pain, I Retired to City Life,
headache and dyspepsia. I eat heartily
and have no appetite for strong drink or
tea or coffee, and feel twenty years

.NEW TO-IJK, Sept. 2.â There wnn a brief
'-..period of a.tlyity nn the Stork Exchange this
... .mnrhinfr-and a brisk demand manifested for a
...few stocks: bat the dealing became more nnd
t more perfunctory as the day proceeded. The
â¢ rriarket was undeT the combined Influence of
:. the exhausting heat, the tightening money
mar'k-et and .the approach of the Labor Day
holiday. It had fallen into complete lethargy
by noon, and the governing committee was In
â  duced to' reconsider its refusal to close the
â¢ â  .Exchange on Saturday, and decided to sus
pend trading from 3 o'clock to-day until 10
â  o'clock next Tuesday morning. The announce
â  ment of this decision demonstrated that the
weakness of some stocks earlier In the day had
.â  been due to speculative short Felling shown by
â¢ the demand to cover shorts. Manhattan scored
.'. an extreme Improvement after marked early
weakness of I\, and Tobacco, after a loss of
nearly 4 points, recovered 1%. The early activ
ity, centered in the Pacifies, the preferred
stocks shewing special strength on the decls
' lon of the Northern Pacific directors announced
later In' the day to put aside a reserve fund
â  of ISjGOO.MO to Insure the continuity of pre
ferred dividends. The common stock fell off a
. point on selling by holders disappointed In ex-
. pec'tation- that the surplus would be distributed

.â¢ mon -.rtork'. rallied only feebly on the presl
â  dent's statement that consideration of dividend
â¢ on the common would be In order If business
â ' continue,! at Its present level. General Elec
tric' continued to show strength and closed at
. the .best at a net gain of IV Ba.lmore and
Ohio also renewed Its advance. The markot
â  generally, drifted to a lower level In the later
dealings, .due. to taking of traders 1 profits In
â¢ anticipation- of the three days' Interval of trad
ing.. The money mnrket hardened further, call
. loans Kcncrally being marked up to 3 per cent
.â¢ on the expectation that to-morrow's bank state

holdings and surpius reserve. The high money
rate was .not reflected In the exchange market,

ture was the sharp rise In Portuguese securities

Pelagoa Bay haa been leased to Great Britain.
There appears to be a substratum of truth to
the rumor, but It is Impossible to say any

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Sept. 2.â Bradstn-et> Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Prices have been
Irregular a:id at the beginning of the Â«(--k
the tone of speculation was reactionary. Large
interests were disposed to withdraw support
or to act on the bear side and there was more
or lees liquidation of the large bull account
open for the public. London also 6old, and
the flrmnese of the money market checked
speculative, buying In spite of the weakness of
exchange and the increasing probability of gold
Imports. The news that some gold was com
ing to the United States from Australia and
TSondon seemed, however, to diminish pressure
In the money market and arrested enforced
liquidation of Mock. Later on the market,
though still Irregular, exhibited a firmer tone,
advances being scored In the Pacific stocks,
while shorts covered in Manhattan, People's
Gus, Sugar and other portions of the list, which
had been depressed by bear selling. At the
same time London showed increased readiness
CO purchase heavily, although interests there
had advanced sharply on fears of a drain of
gold to the I'niteu Slates. The extreme heat
at the West was reported to have injured the
corn crop and on this the uranger shares were
quite heavy.
Transactions in bonds were smaller and some
of the more active investments and some of
the speculative j^peclalties have receded as to
price. On the other hand the railroad bond
litt shows other Issues which have advanced,
notably those of the Northern Pacific mad,
while new records have been made In some
low-pricod bonds like those of the Colorado
Midland.
Governments have been less active and the
older issues are fractionally lovrer, while the
new 3's foil from 105 V* to 104. rallying to l^H.
The decline was on the accredited delivery of
allotments of JIOOO and the Issue of notice of
allotment to subscribers for $4000 amounts of
new bonds.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
N'KW YORK, Sept. 2â R. O. Dun & Co.'a
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The smallest failures ever recorded in any
month for five yearn were those of Augrurt.
No other mor. h since the monthly reports were
commenced by Dun's Revfew exclusively has
shown defaulted liabilities an small within
$1,000,000, nnd the ratio of such defaults to
solvent business, represented by exchanges
through all clearing houses, only JIOB 70 In
$100,000, is smaller by 26.5 per cent than In any
previous month. The clearings having been the
largest ever known in August, and 23.0 per cent
larger than In 1892.
The enormous volume of business In a month
usually one of the most Inactive of the year
demands attention. Postponement during the
months of war of some contracts and purchases
which have now come forward explains part of
the Increase, and the strong absorption of se
curities explains part, but there has also been
a great decline in the average of prices of all
commodities, so that It takes a much larger
volume of business In tons or buÃln :.-â  to make
up transactions amounting to a million more
than In 1892. It Is therefore strictly true that
business Is larger than In the very best of all
past years, and yet there is every prospect of
much further Increase.
There Is no room to doubt that the wheat
crop, even though it may fall a shade below
some estimates, will prove the largest ever
harvested, and although Beerbohm estimates
Europe's crop at 232,000,000 bushels more than
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1898.
the last, that would be only about an average
yield, while other evidence is less favorable.
Foreign buying has been strong. Atlantic ex
ports for the week have been 3.326.57S bushels,
against 5,534.758 bushels last year, and Pacific
exports were 458,881 bushels, against 255.651
bushels last year. But receipts are increasing
at the West and the price has dropped 5 cents
for spot, though the September option is %<â¢
lower for the week.
The Improvement in the iron industry has not
only -continued, but becomes more Impressive,
because after enormous business eales have
satisfied the needs of: Great consumers lor.
months to come, the demand for products Is
so great that both materials and products
gradually advance In price. Bessemer pig has
risen to $10 55 at Pittsburgh local coke at.Chi
cago and anthracite foundry at the East are
strong, and also bars and plates advance a
share, with most structural and plate mills
filled with orders for months to come, and
25,000 tons of rails sold at Chicago for delivery
next year. The advance in tin-plates, in spite
of , production far greater than was . thought
possible not long ago, is evidence that the con
sumption of Fteol In that branch will be heavy.
The wire nail works also report. a better de
mand, and the output of Connellsvllle coke has
started up, training 10,000 ton? for the week.
The woolen mills have rather better orders
this week, but not' enough :as yet to warrant
running nearly full force, with " the price of
wool held at the West much above Eastern
markets, and by those markets about. 1 cent
hleher than the mills are bidding.
Failures for the week have - been 171 in the
United States, against 191 last year, and 22 in
Canada, against 25 last year. â 
BRADSTREET'S. REVIEW. " '
NEW YORK, Sept. 1 2.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: , The advent of September finds
full trades In full swing at the West anil
Northwest and more reported doing at South-
I crn Mississippi Valley points 'and in the East,
but the volume of business. in wools and dry
goods in the latter section is rather smaller
than expected. Early reports of large busi
ness doing; during August are confirmed by
aggregates of monthly bank clearings, which
show unprecedentedly large totals for that
month, little below, indeed, the immense
m nthly aggregates of last winter.
Reports from the iron and steel trade are in a
high degree favorable, the tonnage movement
being unprecedented^ large and the . line of
prices firm at the advtnoeÃ . recently scored.
Business in steel Is exceptionally large and in
the West particularly is limited only by the
ability of the mills to keep up with orders.
The Western crop situation remains practi
cally unchanged, cash wheat being lower, on
a rather larger movement of spring wheat, but
an active., demand for export has furnished
sustaining power. Corn has been ruled by. the
weather in surplus producing States, which Is
dry and hot, with a steadying effect on the
prices." The dose of the cotton year finds the
price of that staple slightly firmer on reports
of damage by rain to the crop in the South
Atlantic States. From other parts of the
South, however, crop reports continue quite
favorable and a yield at least equal to that
realized during the year just ended is looked
for by many. A better tone is evident In the
print-cloth markets this week and an advance
of 1-16 is reported; largely the reflection of a
more cheerful outlook at Fall River. Failures
In the United States are down to very low fig
ures, numbering only 164 this week, against
172 last week, 197 In 1597, 336 in 1556, 184 in 1895
and 227 in 1694.
Distributive trade is active in the West and
Northwest, with dry goods, boots and shoes,
i hats and caps, machinery, clothing and hard
ware In most active distribution by Jobbers,
and iron, steel and most of itÂ« products in
active demand and consumption by manu
facturers. An Increased business 'is reported
in the Southern Mississippi Valley, New Or
leans telling of increased activity In general
trade and large receipts of new crop cotton
and rice. On the South Atlantic coast heavy
rains, have hurt distributive trade and are
claimed to have materially Injured cotton crop
prospects. San Francisco advices are that the
Cnllfrrnla wheat croj. will not much exceed [
8.000.000 bushels, which is about one-third of
an average. About one-half of the usual fruit
crop is locked for. except in the case of rai
sins, of which a heavy yield Is expected. Au
trust was a pood month at Puget Sound cities
for both domestic and export trade.
Wheat shipments for the â¢ week, Including
flour, aggregate 3.6*7.040 bushels, as against
3,503,478 bushels last week. 6,2C4.fi47 in the cor
responding week of 1597 and 3.369. In IR?6.
Failures In the Dominion of Canada number
23. against 27 last week, 3R this week a year ago
and in 1896. 33 In 1895 and 29 in 1594.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 2.â ln the figurative lan
guage of wheat speculators the heavy receipts
at Minneapolis and Duluth gave the bullish
feeling a black eye. It did not matter that
Liverpool reported advance in the price of
futures or that New York sent word of nu-
merous "acceptances of last night's offers, and
that France was again bidding for wheat. -The
market here found sellers in the majority ; at
the opening and generally throughout the fore
noon. September wheat had sunk Into the rest
ful condition: usual with an : active " trading
month that has outlived Its best days and en
tered the thirty last days of its earthly career.
It was heard from only at long Intervals and
chiefly owed its occasional awakening to some
elevator man's broker offering . it . for sale, as
a hedge against wheat bought In the country.
A Nebraska grain dealer's association issued
a circular making an estimate of from 45,000.000
to 65,000,000 bushels as the size of the wheat
crop of that State. Nebraska considered la-it
year's crop a heavy one, but according to the
Government report the Nebraska wheat crop
of last year was only. 27,450,000 bushels. To
day's estimate gave the market another black'

WILL PROVE
IDA KING IS
HIS WIFE
C. A. Auburn Will Not
Yield to His Rival.
WEDDED THREE YEARS AGO
THE GIRL BRIDE SAYS 3HE IS
STILL SINGLE.
With His Motker-in-Law the Hue
brnd Leaves to Square Mat
ters in Stock
ton.
. .' Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 2.
. A young lady nearly 19 years of age is
causing much excitement in two cities.
She is either Mrs. C. A. Auburn or she is
not. Mr. Auburn declares she is his wife.
She is just as positive that she is not. Mr.
Auburn is the proprietor of an Oakland
hotel and his wife or Miss Ida Kingâ
whichever it isâ is at present in Stockton
basking in the smiles of another and de
claring that she has a perfect right â to
please herself In the matter. .
Mr. Auburn was in Stockton a few days
ago and found his wife with a rival. He
consulted the Chief of Police, but the
woman stoutly, denied that she had ever
married him and assured the Stockton
Chief that she could prove her statement.
Auburn also offered to prove that she
was' his wife, and has been in Oakland
the past two days getting together his
proof. He left this afternoon on the
Stockton boat, with a determination of
bringing- -home the young lady whom ho
claims as his wife. He was accompanied
by. Mrs. King, the young lady's mother,
â wllo has promised her alleged son-in-law
that she will identity the young woman.
'â¢My wife left Oakland last Saturday,"
said Mr. Auburn thin afternoon, "osten
sibly to visit friends at Pleasanton, she
having been rather ill for several days.
At Niles she changed her mind and went
to Stockton, sending word back to me by
a Boy who had accompanied her as far
.as Mies. In the meantime I had heard
i of' something that aroused my suspicions.
Fred Spinney, a railroad man, had been
hangingaround my hotel for several days
and I learned that he had left about the
. same time as Mrs. Auburn did, and I had
no doubt- but that he was following her,
â  so I hastened to Stockton, where I caught
them. It's not true that I had them both
.'arrested. No arrests were made, but we
â¢ went to ' the Chief of Police's office. I
made no attempt to shoot Spinney, but
I should have.". <.* , .
. â¢..A -stormy scene followed the meeting at
.the Stockton Chief's office when the
r young woman denied that she was Au
burn's wife or ever had been. In fact,
she claimed that she did not know Au
'â¢ burn. Spinney stated that he had known
â  her in Oakland for some time, but never
had any .knowledge that she was married.
Auburn stoutly asserted that she was
none" but -Ms wife, and would return to
. t i-LkJaiiJ â¢<â > bring her mother. to Stockton
â to bear â¢it this statement.'
Mr. Auburn to-day claimed that he and
.Ida King were married in Los Angeles
â¢ nearly three years ago, but upon being
pressed as to particulars he admitted that
the. marriage was by contract and that
. neither minister nor authorized judicial
officer officiated.
"Before we decided to marry," contin
ued Mr. Auburn, "we called .on a Los
.Angeles attorney named Millar or Mil
â  ler. I told him that perhaps we had bet
â  ter be- married by a minister, but this
' auorney- advised us it would, be all
rightâ perfectly legal and binding and
so we let it go at that and have, since
â¢ been living together.
"I <i<> not know what prompted Mrs.
Auburn to deny that we were married,
unless ft be that Khe grew angry because
I. went to -Stockton anÂ«l raised this rum
pus.- My wife is a young woman of rath
er peculiar temper. She- Is just as liable
to blacksnake me as she is to r,it down i
and. eat a taghale; but I'll say this for
!.â¢ r. ehe-'s ;ip cn.ifl â  and as hard a little .,
Worker as- ever lived, and I'll see that ;
this whole affair la straightened out with- :
out- injury- to her.
"Spinney .is no good, and it would be ;
wipe for. him to look out for himself, al- ;
though I really don't anticipate any fur- !
their trouble.
"\Vht-n her mother, Mrs. King, talks
to her-- and- Identifies her. she will in all
probability 'accompany us home."
Auburn claims that Fred Spinney has 'â 
hot .-seen' Mrs. Auburn at any time, dur
ing fhe. past .three years, but that prior
to tfujt -time he knew her well while the
King family, lived in Fresno, near which
town Mr-. King-owns an extensive ranch.
Miss: Ida. King is well known In this
city. At the time of her marrrage, or ;
alleged marriage, to Auburn at Fresno, !
jfh.c. was but 16 years of age. There has ;
alw-nvp be*>n more or less doubt among
ber frit-ivis as' to the nature of hr-r sup- i
posed marriage to Auburn, and his state
ment that- the ceremony was performed
by contract Is hot altogether a surprise
Thfl trirlis only 13. years old, and those
.Who know her-bept declare that Auburn's
estimate of her disposition is somewhere
near the truth.

Outsiders Will Not Get a Chance to

Commander Z. L. Tanner who 1s
charged with the task of arranging for
the erection of a coaling station at Pago-
Pago harbor, 1b very much easier In his
mind than he was a week or bo ago.
"It was stated," he says, "that $250,000
was to be spent on this work, and in con
meat until recently, â when it was given
to Samson's Market on Eleventh street.
About 1600 pounds of beef are supplied
daily. This morning the meat was found
to contain 'wtfiat appeared to be matter
ated blotches. Colonel Henshaw immedi
ately notified Inspector Pierce and Dr.
Dunn, and although Camp Barrett does
not come within Oakland's jurisdiction,
they procured several forty-pound cuts,
which upon microscopical examination
were declared to contain germs of tuber
culosis.
A board of officers was Immediately ap
pointed and the whole lot of beef was
condemned. During the day the Sam
son'a Market people replaced the con
demned meat by wholesome beef.
What adds seriousness to the discovery
is that the condemned lot was placarded
by the stamp of the United States Gov
ernment Inspector. Dr. Dunn stated this
evening that the contractor will be im
mediately prosecuted and that such steps
will be taken to-morrow.
DR. SHARI GETS OFF.
His Second Expedience on Charges
of Criminal Operation Besults
in His Release.
OAKLAND, Sept. 2.â Dr. C. J. Sharp,
who was charged with being criminally
responsible for the death of Mrs. Paul
Nelson, was to-day released in the Police
Court, the evidence being decreed insuf
ficient at the preliminary examination.
While it appeared from the testimony of
the medical experts who saw Mrs. Nelson
ehortly before her death, and who per
formed an autopsy after death, that a
criminal operation had probably been
performed, there was no evidence to con
nect Dr. Sharp with it. outside of tne
simple fact that he had attended the
woman before she was removed to Fabi
ola Hospital. No ante-mortem statement
had been obtained, and the woman's hus
band claimed to know nothing about the
alleged operation at all.
This is the second experience of Dr.
Shnrp. On a previous occasion he was
held to answer before the Superior Court
on a similar charge in connection with
the death of Annie Johnson, but at that
time he was acquitted.
RELIGIOUS MANIA
ATTACKED THEM BOTH
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER SUF
FERING FROM HYSTERIA.
Taken Into Custody by Oakland's
Police ana Will Be Examined
as to Sanity.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 2.
Mrs. Day and her daughter Daisy were
brought to the Receiving Hospital this
afternoon and charged with being in
sane. For some time the condition of
these two ladies has gradually become
worse, and the members of St. John's
Episcopal Church decided that it would
be ne<jessary for them to be officially
cared for.
Mrs. Day is about 40 years of age and
her daughter Daisy ia 18. They are both
suffering from hysteria and excessive re
ligious excitement. For several days they
have rapidly grown worse, although their
attacks are intermittent. It Is thought
that the daughter is suffering as much
from sympathy with her mother as from
actual Insanity. When taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital by Rev. Floyd Mynard,
rector of the church, they protested
against being kept in a room and made
all kijids of pleas not to be separated.
They then commenced to implore the ma
tron and the warden to accept salvation
before It was too late.
The case is very pitiful. Mdthef and
daughter are ardently attached to each
other and can talk for spells quite ra
tionally and then they will suddenly be
come hysterical and cry or sing and pray
with much emotion.
St. John's congregation has been look
ing after Mrs. and Miss Day for some
time, and they have been living with Mrs.
Blake at 562 Eleventh street. More re
cently they moved to another house and
the landlady was not aware that they
were victims of a mania until last night.
Complaint was then made to the rector
and ne informed the police, but as the
ladies were quiet nothing was done. This
morning they again became hysterical
and Rev. F. Mynard decided to have
them examined and cared for. They will
be examined to-morrow morning.

sequence I was beseiged with would-be
contractors, ail anxious to secure a share
of the spoil. As a matter of fact tho sum
to be expended will not nearly reach this
amount.
"No," continued the commander, "I am
not going to say what the cost of the
work will be. That would not be fair to
the firms which are to tender, and, above
all things, I wish to be fair. I have sent
out all the plans and specifications I had,
eight In number, to different firms, and
Invited bids for the work. Of course I
had not enough papers to go around, but
I have selected only reputable firms,
which have all the appliances for carry-
Ing out the work."
Commander Tanner will not specify the
firms to which he has given the valuable
opportunity of bidding for this remunera
tive contract, but he admitted that seve
ral companies on this < oast had been in
cluded, so that California will have a fair
chance to compete. The tenders, aa -an
already been stated, call for the construc
tion of a substantial wharf, with stool
piling, and coaling sheds ashoro. In addi
tion there is to be a large four-roomed
cottage for the caretaker, consisting
mainly, as is customary in Samoa, of a
wide verandah encircling the whole
house.
"This talk about fortifying Pago-Pago."
remarked tho commander, "Is nonsense.
Alt the garrison we Intend to have is the
caretaker, who will see that nothing: is
stolen from the station. The prestige of
the United States Is the best fortification
the place can have: no nation would dream
of attacking the station unless war had
Just been declared against this country.
And, If war existed, then the Immutable
law of sea power would come Into force,
and Pago-Pago would only be of use to us
as long as we had control of the sea."
It will be some time before anything
can be done In this matter. At least a
month must elapse before the bids of the
contractors can be received and adjudi
cated upon. The work of preparing the
materlnl must commence within ten
days after the acceptance of the con
tract, and even then it will be three or
or four months before everything is
ready for shipment to this far-away iele.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1898.
YEE CHEATS
THE NOOSE
One Murderer Less in
Alameda's Jail.
SAW NO HOPE FOR HIS LIFE
KILLED HIS PARTNER WITH A
HATCHED.
No One Knows How Enough Opium
Could Have Been Carried
Past the Sheriff's
Deputies.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 2.
There is one murderer less in the Coun
ty Jail. Chung Tee, realizing that there
was little hope of escaping the gallows,
took poison last night and died this morn
ing.
Nearly three months ago Yee chopped
his partner, Chung Sing, with an ax at
Pleasanton, inflicting fatal wounds. Yee
has been at the County Jail over two
months awaiting trial and daily growing
more despondent. A few days ago Quong
Mow, the Chinese who shot a man while
stealing his corn at Temescal two weeks
ago, was placed in the cell with Chung
Yee. The Pleasanton murderer, upon
learning that Mow, whose chances of dis
charge are said to be fairly good, came
to the conclusion that there was no
chance for him and he determined to die.
A few days ago Yee confided to his cell
mate that his father and mother and wife
and other relatives were all dead in China
and he might as well die too. Last night
he bought some milk, with which he made
coffee. Quong Mow expressed a desire to
share Yee's drink, but the latter per
emptorily stopped him, telling him it was
much too sweet for his taste. Mow paid
no attention to the incident at the time,
but this morning he says he has no doubt
that Yee had placed the poison in the
coffee, which caused him to sleep away
his life.
Dr. Porter was called to Yee early this
morning, but the Chinese was then close
to death. All the usual remedies failed
to keep him alive. The question interest
ing the jailers is how enough poison, os
tensibly opium or morphine, could get
into the jail to cause death. Yee has not
had a visitor for three weeks, although
his cellmate has all his meals brought to
him by friends. Dr. Porter is of the opin
ion that with the usual fatalistic idea Yee
had the poison secreted somewhere about
his person or his clothing, and that he in
tended to use it in case he was convicted
of murder. __^

Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Sept. 2.
Six hundred dollars has been paid out
of the city treasury and the Crane Com

A few days ago the Crane Company,
through its local agent, G. H. Jeffress,
made inquiries concerning the bill and
found that it had been conected. No

HUNTING A DEAD MAN.
Queer Predicament in a Suit to Quiet
Title to Property in Brooklyn
Township.
OAKLAND, Sept. 2.â The obscure death
of Peter Stone has caused two lawyers a
peck of trouble, and has placed Herbert
F. Patterson in the queer predicament of
trying to serve a summons on a man who
has been dead for the past three years.
It appears that about five years ago
Peter Stone contracted to buy from Mrs.
Margaret A. Daly a piece of real estate
in Brooklyn Township. Years rolled by
and payments ceased, so Mrs. Daly en
gaged Attorney Peri E. Allen of San
Francisco to quiet title. The papers were
filed in May. 1897, but Stone could no
where be found. Then Mrs. Daly changed
attorneys, retaining Frank P. Taylc >t
this city, thinking the matter had I en
neglected.
It then devolved on Patterson to locate
Stone. He traced his man's movements
during the past ten years and finally
learned that he had been stopping at Mrs.
Sands', In Lorin, but had left there, gone
to the County Infirmary and died nearly
three years ago and was buried in the
potter's field.
It was found also that Stone had left
certain papers with Mrs. Sands, among
At least a year will be needed for the
completion of the station.
Lieutenant Chambers of the civil en
gineering department of the navy, is to
supervise the construction of the work.
He will remain in this country, inspect
ing tht process of manufacture, until the
material is ready for shipment. Then
he will go to Pago-Pago with two as~
sistants and supervise the construction
of the whnrf and sheds. In addition he
will fee charged with the task of making
a complete topographical survjv of the
United States' land In this harbor, a
work which has hitherto never been per
formed. He will also provide for a wa
ter supply by tapping one of the moun
tain creeks above the station, and piping
for this pufpose Is to bo taken with the
expedition.
At least two local firms have been In
vited to send in bids for this work. A.
AY. Uurrcll of the California Bridge and
Construction Company admits that Com
mander Tanner has forwarded him a Â»et
of plans and specifications and asked for
an offer. "The plans." he said, "have
been intrusted to us under a strict prom
ise of secrecy, therefore I am not at lib
erty to disclose any details of the work.
Our engineer is now busy preparing the
estimates, and we t will have our tender
in before the specified date, the Bth of
thio month. I cannot give you any klc-a
of the cost at prevent."
At the office of the San Francisco
Tjvldge Company there is the same
of secrecy. The managers state that
they have been asked to put in a bid.
"We are working it out," said one offi
cial, "and shall certainly tender. The
contract should be of great benefit to
the Pacific Coast, since most of the ma
terial will have to be manufactured here.
and all the skilled labor required In the
construction of the wharf will be on
gaged in this city. A year's time is al
lowed for the completion of the coal
ing station, so that the men employed
will have quite a long period of profit
able occupation."

WATER BILL INQUIRY.
Novel Test for Investigating the
Leakage at Oakland City
Hall
OAKLAND, Sept. 2.â For several, weeks
Mayor Thomas and City Engineer Clem
ent have been digging about the City
Hall grounds in their efforts to reach
a solution of the cause for the big water
bills at the City Hall park. They have
been unable to locate any leak, and it is
concluded now that the meter does not
register correctlyâ the amount of water
for the month reaching a fabulous quan
tity.
It is proposed now to shut off the wa
ter supply to the City Hall and park en
tirely for a short time, and then, press
ing one of the cltys sprinkling carts
into service, they will measure the
amount of water passing through the
meter by having it run into the cart, the
capacity oj. the latter being known.
Oakland formerly paid $18 per month
for water furnished the City Hall and
park, but when the energetic little meter
was put In the bills. suddenly jumped to
over $100 per month.

With $45,000.

GAVE SSOOO TO THE POCTOR FOR
SAFEKEEPING.
The Attorneys Working for the Ex
tradition of the Grub-Staked
Miner From Colo
rado.
D. B. Davison. a Klondiker who met
With success, and others, hits come and
.gone,, and thereby hangs a tale. He re
turned fr.'in the ice-packod goldfieUls on
July J. 7on the St. Paul with about $45,000
to his credit. Soon after legal proceed
ing were brought by the Klondike Ex
. ploration Company, a Colorado corpora
tion.' to rocover the money which they
claimed Davison had appropriated, as he
was nothing more than a grub-staked
â¢miner. Davison fled after the service of
the summons and is now under arrest in
Seattle, awaiting extradition, which has
been applied for by the Colorado syr.di-
< ue. .from Governor Budd. Dr. V. G.
V Mizner and Reel B. Terry figure in tne
as friend and attorney of the shifty
i ;i>. ison.
I tavison was sent to Alaska by the
Klondike Gold Exploration Company un
der a written contract, by which he was
vi receive $100 per month and expenses.
He also had a one-eighth interest in the
corporation business. All locations and
.money derived from his operations in ths
.far north were to be the property of tiie
corporation. In March of this year Davi
' son located claim 17 on French Gulch: It
â¢was a. bench claim and proved a very
â¢valuable property, estimated by people
â who know to be worth in the neighbor
hood of (500,000, It is reported that lie sold
: this claim for $25,000 and extracted S3O UUO
â in dust. His pockets inflated with the
evidences of a cool 146,000 he left Dawsuii
City -and went to St. Michael.
â¢ .There he met the renowned Dr. Mizner
â  In his hands he plated $5000 for safe keep
ingâsome think because he feared trouble
Upon his arrival here. When he reached
â  t!iis- city Davison had the dust minted. It
was then that the Colorado company
K;irried of his presence here, and their
attorneys in this clt\ were instructed to
demand an ;u-countirtg. Accordingly a
'civil suit was brought which filled Davi
â ' son with several kinds of chiliing fears,
and. he' fled in the night to a colder clime
to. keep warm. Judgment was had by
â¢default.
. In the course of the legal proceedings it
wah evolved that Dr. Mizner had received
from the volatile miner Just $1669 and an
addition of $2000 from Mrs. Davison, who
had come out from Colorado in the mean
time to meet her husband. As Mizner's
Btory goes this $3500 he invested in a spec
â tacular' performance, the ill-fated Battle
â¢of Manila at Central Park, In the produc
tion of which tne money was dissipated
in the burning of multi-colored powders.
Mizner received $12<.i more from the wife
â which she intrusted to his keeping and
â which was expended. Thus $3000 of the
'company's money has assumed wings and
tccne none knows whither. Heel Terry was
employed as Daviaon's attorney to
. quash the summons which called the
latter into court.
â The belief is tha; Davison went to Se
attle to receive the rest of the money
â  which he obtained from the sale of the
diggings and the dust which he extracted.
Just how much Davison has tossed to
the four winds is not known, but the at

As .-oon. as the warrant for arrest was
Bworn out in this city it was telegraphed
to Seattle and the arr<~st was made. Upon
application to the Governor for extradi

tract under which Davison was sent to
tho Klondike was void as being in con
travention to the Canadian law restrlct
â  ing Importation of alien labor. Tho Cana
. f'.ian law is a duplicate of the American
contract labor law and the decision of the
â¢.Governor will be of great Importance;
â because if the contract is held void all
â¢Krub-s.take contracts will fall to the
ground. As Davison was a one-'-i^hth
owner In the corporation's stock it is con
â¢-.tended that this law does not apply to the
/contract of Davison and that be was not
v mnnual laborer within the interpreta

Amusements.
Labor day this year is both a State and
â¢national holiday, and the trades unions
have united to make. the celebration one
to be remembered. As this day was mode
'a holiday at the request of organized la
bor, the wag-eworkers think it but fitting
to let each Labor day mark some progres
sive step and call public attention to the
work- acomplished by the trades unions
and the necessity of a more perfect organ
ization of wageworkers. This year the
voice of organized labor throughout the
world will be raised in demand for a
shorter workdayâ more time to rest for
those at work and more opportunity to
work for the many thrown out of em
ployment by labor-saving machinery
A Joint committee was appointed "three

it has been working zealously ever since

The Oakland Exposition People In
terested in This Movement.
A fow days ago the Council of Associ
ated Industries held a meeting and set In
motion several projects that Its members
hope to have come before the next Leg
islature. Principal of the>;e Is the matter
of legislation looking to the creation of
pure food laws and a stricter enforcement
of tnose already on the statute books.
Good roads will also receive the consid
eration of the council, which is composed
of all of the leading commercial, Indus
trial and progressive bodies of the city
and country. That the recent meeting, as
well as the previous agitation, has been
of benefit may. be Judged from the follow
ing letter received yesterday by Junan
Sonntas from Charles D. Gray, manager
of the California Exposition of Home In
dustries, which will b held In Oakland
from Novenmber;l2 to December 3:
Considering. the good work being done by the
Associated Industries regarding pure food in
California, the directors of the California Etnte
Exposition, to l>e held in Oakland In Novem
ber, have decided to set aside a large space for
the purpose of exhibiting and demonstrating
pure food and food products of California, and
they cordially Invite your council of Associated
Industries and also the Board of Health of
your city to Join them in this movement for ad
vancement of California food and food pro
ducts. Trusting that you will take this mat
ter up at your earliest convenience and advise
us of the decision, I remain, very truly yours,

State Floral Society.
Ten years ago the California State
Floral Society came into existence, and
yesterday the anniversary was commem
orated in a quiet way by a social gather
ing at the meeting rooms of the organi
zation at 223 Sutter street. In ten years
the society has distributed nearly J-kVK)
â  n premiums and prizes to growers of
fancy and rare flowers, besides many
special prizes donated by friends. The
feature of yesterday's gathering was an
address by J. BurU Daw of the denart
r.i-iit of botany of the State University,
whose discourse was on "Perfumes and
Their Origin." Professor Davy diveit
particularly upon this Industry in Eurooe
and the methods of extracting perfume
from flowers. One reason for the indus
try being successful in France and not in
this country Is that labor is cheaper
there than here.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1898.
THE SEVENTH
CALIFORNIA IS
NOW HAPPY
Orders Are Issued to
Muster It Out.
THE SIXTH GOES OUT ALSO
PROMPT RESPONSE TO HUGH
CRAIG'S TELEGRAM.
President McKinley Referred the
Dispatch to the War Depart
ment, Which Acted at
Once.
As exclusively Intimated In The Call of
yesterday, in a dispatch received from
Washington, D. C, the Eighth Regiment
will remain in service, while the Seventh
and Sixth will be mustered out.
The troubles of the Seventh California
are nearly at an end. There was much
joy In the camp last evening, caused by
the announcement that a dispatch had
been received by Hugh Craig, president
of the Chamber of Commerce, from Ad
jutant General Corbln, saying that Mr.
Craig's telegram to the President in ref- j
once to the California regiments had been
referred to the War Department, and In
reply the adjutant general stated: "I Deg
to inform you that orders will issue to
day or to-morrow for the mustering out
of the Sixth and Seventh California regi
1 ments of volunteer infantry."
â  Tho result of the agitation in behalf
of the enlisted men of the Seventh in their
fight against Colonel' Berry and other
officers of the Seventh Regiment came
much sooner than was expected. It was,
no doubt, so promptly, accomplished by
President Craig'sMispatch and the appeal
of Senator White. Mr. Newberry, who j
started for Washington on Thursday to
make a special effort on behalf of the en
listed men, can now return to Los An
geles.
The Seventh Regiment, which comes
from Southern California, will return to
Los Angeles and there be mustered out
at Its armory. The orders for the muster
ing out will be received at military head
quarters to-day, and, of course, will be
immediately acted upon.
The Sixth Regiment, in command of
Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, is largely
made up of men from the Sacramento
Valley, and 1 will be disbanded in .San
Francisco. Lieutenant Colonel' Johnson
is stationed at Benicia with the regiment
headquarters and several companies of
the regiment, which are. doing garrison
duty and guarding the arsenal. No gen
eral desire on the part of the Sixth to go
out of the service has been manifested,
and to many of the men the order will, no
doubt, be somewhat of a surprise. Some
members of the- companies ...-. sta
tioned at Fort Point came over to Camp
Merriam last evening and held a sort of
jollification meeting with men of the Sev
enth, both uniting in singing "Home,
Sweet Home." However, there was no
great excitement caused by the muster
fng-out order, as it was the expected that
had happened.
Colonel Berry was not in camp last
evening, and the other officers refused to
discuss the matter for publication further
than to say that they feel deeply cha
grined at the outcome of this affair,
which ' they regard' under the; circum
stances as a. disgrace upon the regiment,
and at present would like to retaliate
upon the persons who have brought this
thing about.
"Ninety-five per cent of my men prefer
to stay in the service," said the colonel,
"rather than disgrace the Seventh by
asking for their discharge. It is the re
maining 5 per cent who are doing all the
kicking and who have been doing it all
along. They are that per cent of worth
less soldiers- who are to be found in every
repiment. To kick is all they care for,
and they would run If they got into a
fight. The men of this regiment are will
ing to perform the contract that they en
tered into vith the Government. They
will no doubt not kick if they snould be
mustered out, but they are not going to
petition the Government of their own
free will to be mustered out. The r^-ort
that I want to continue the regiment in
service because I am getting a good sal
ary is not worth considering. , M-self and
my officers sacrificed business interests
in going into the service for which our
salaries do not begin to compensate us.
Personally my salary does not begin to
meet my expenses, and, besides, I am
sacrificing business interests that would
more than amount to what I would get
in the service in ten vots. I Pi.all take
no further steps in this affair, but await
developments. I was visited to-day by
two prominent gentlemen from Los An
geles.'and they went over the camp and
examined the reports of the : air. : in fact,
they made a close Investigation' of the
whole matter, and they declared when
they left that there was no ground for
all the sensation that was belnsr made of
tne sickness In the camp."
FURLOUGHED SOLDIERS.
Warning to Convalescents to
Eat Nothing but the Sim
plest Necessary Food.
The following suggestive Instructions
wore received at military headquarters
yesterday afternoon from Adjutant Gen
eral Corbin:
"It having been reported to the. War
Department that many convalescent sol
diers who have received furloughs and
started for home have been taken ill on
the way. and to avoid further occurrences
of this kind it is suggested in the strong
est possible terms that all soldiers trav
eling homeward on furlouphs will exer
cise their best judgment in caring for
themselves, especially those who have
been ill with fever. Thc-lr appetites are
very keen, and unless they deny them
selves everything except the necessary
food of the simplest character the y n.re in
great danger of a relapse. This instruc
tion is sent out hoping that it may catch
the eye of those men en route and also
for the instruction of surgeons at hos
pitals. It is ordered that no man will
receive a furlough whom the surgeon in
charge believes to be unable to travel
alone, and that no furloughed soldier
shall leave a hospital without receiving
full instructions as to his diet while en
route to his home from his surgeon.
Presidio Notes.
Privates W. M. Holden and Louis Dunn
of Company I. Fifty-first lowa, died
yesterday at the Division Hospital.
The War Department has definitely de
cided that it will not muster out the
California Heavy Artillery tor the pres
ent. This probably means that Major
Rice's command may do duty at Angel
Island and Alcatraz. General Miller has
been notified of the decision of the de
partment.
Captain Granvllle Palmer, command-
Ing the Alger Battery, will leave in a
few days for the mountains to secure a
much needed rest. He has been sick for
some time, and his doctor fe^rs that he
is threatened with typhoid fever. During
his absence the battery will be under
the command First Lieutenant Clarke.
A board of survey appointed by Gen
eral Miller will convene this morning
to pass upon some clothing Issued to the
Nevada Cavalry, which Is said to be of
an inferior quality.
Grateful toth* French Hospital.
Brigade Surgeon W. O. Owen, U. S.
V.. commanding the Division Field H< -
pltal at the Presidio, has addressed a let
ter of thanks to the directors of the
French Hi pital for their benevolence in
receiving and caring for sick soldiers. In
tne address special courtesies are men
tioned, and the most profound apprecia
tion is warmly expressed. A copy of the
letter will be sent to the surgeon gen
eral's office at Washington. D. C.

RECLAMATION OF
THE ARID LANDS
Discussed by Irrigation
Congress.
GOOD WORK NOW UNDER WAY
SECRETARIES BLISS AND WIL
SON ARE IN ACCORD.
Senator Warren Says That Much Aid
May Be Received From Con
gress in the
Jfuture.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHEYEKNE Wyo., Sept. 2.â At the
session of the Irrigation Congress to
day Senator F. E. Warren spoke upon
what the congress is doing in aid of
irrigation. Senator Warren confessed
at the start that the discussion of what
the congress had not done in aid of ir
rigation offered a much wider field than
that confined to what had been done.
The desert land law was the first evi
dence of Congressional interest in re
clamation of arid lands by irrigation.
This act was followed by repressive
legislation, but during the past five
years a marked change hod occurred.
The Carey act was an evidence of this
change, but this act had been altered
by subsequent legislation.
However, there was a hopeful side
shown by the spirit and temper of the
last Congress. The upper house had
given much time to debate in favor of
national construction of reservoirs and
the larger canals. Senator Warren said
the time for investigation was past.
The field was now ready for actual
work and liberal appropriations to per
fect this work must be secured. The
progress made in preserving the forests
was a step ahead and the Department
of Agriculture with a Western man at
the head had made a good beginning.
Senator Warren believed the Govern
ment should water the lands.
Hon. E. F. Best of the Interior De
partment then read a paper upon "The
National Forest Reserves and the Re
lationship of Forestry and Irrigation."
Judge Kest said the whole heart of the
Secretary of the Interior was in this
problem of preserving the forests. He
said the preservation of the water sup
ply was the most important factor in
the problem. This was, in many in
stances, the sole motive for the estab
lishment of reservations. Judge Kest
spoke of the intimate relations between
the forest and the flowing stream, the
latter always being at the maximum,
when the former was undisturbed.
A very earnest debate followed, dur
ing which President Carey spoke in
high terms of the work of Secretary
Bliss as the head of the Interior De
partment.
State Engineer Mead of Wyoming, In
an able address, spoke on "The Obsta
cles to Settlement in r the Arid Region
and the Best Means of Overcoming
Them," and Judge Emery of Kansas
led the discussion on the topic, "The
Storage of Water." "Obstacles to Set
tlement in the Arid Region" was ably
handled by J. A. Johnston, superintend
ent of Water Division No. 1 in Wyom-
Ing.
In the debate upon this topic Mr.
Mead graphically portrayed the obsta
cles to settlement as experience had
shown them. Capital was needed to
make settlement by the poor man pos
sible and he believed that an easy way
to get It was to cede the grazing lands
to the State and let them lease them,
thus securing $4,000,000 a year to pro
mote irrigation. Mr. "Waitland of Utah
also spoke upon this topic, remarking
that the congress was losing sight of
the purpose for which it wa^organized,
viz.: the disposition of the arid lands.
At 5 o'clock the congress selected
Montana as the State in which to hold
the next annual meeting. The city will
be selected by the executive committee
hereafter. Adjournment was then had
until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The following were made members of
the executive committee of i^e congress
for the ensuing year: H. L. Kelloger,
Colorado; S. M. Knox. Illinois; J. H.
Churchill. Kansas; R. W. Sylvester,
Maryland; Thomas Knight. KuMouzi: J.

FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT.
Merchants' Association Sends a Rep
resentative East to Make
Observations.
At the suggestion of President Dohr
mann, now In New York, the board of di
rectors of the Merchants' Association has
decided to have L. M. King, superintend
ent of the public work department of the
association, proceed at once to the East
for the purpose of collecting 'nformation
relative to public works In Eastern cities.
Mr. King started last evening, and -will be
absent one month. During that time he
will, in Conjunction with President Dohr
mann. carefully examine recent public
improvements in New York. Philadelphia,
Boston, Washington, Buffalo and other
leading cities.
Special attention v.-ill be given to street
pavements, electric and gas lighting, sew
erage and drainage, street railways,
cleaning and sprinkling of streets, as well
ns other matters pertaining to municipal
government and administration. At the
end of this month President Dohrmann
will return, and a report of his observa
tions of municipal affairs in the most
progressive cities of Europe mid America
will be rendered to the Merchants' Asso
ciation, and recommendations for certain
municipal Improvements will be made to
the authorities of San Francisco.
Hale & Norcross Case.
The Supreme Court has gTanted a writ
of supprsedcaa in the Hale & Norcross
case. It has decided that the defendants
in the action of the H.ilo & Norcross Sil
ver Mining Company against M. W. Fox
et al. have the right to appeal from the
decision of Superior Judge Daingerfleld,
which he made to compel Fox as presi
dent and R. T T . Collins as secretary to
cancel an order of sale of stock belonging
to George Grnyson. In the Superior Court
it was decided that the levy of the as
sessment was Illegal and tho Pale of the
delinquent stork necessarily void. The
plaintiffs, however, endeavored to have
the lower court compel them to make the
transfer of the stock or be- punished for
contempt. A petition for a writ of super
sedeas was presented to the higher court,
tho contention being that the notice of
appeal acted as a stay of proceedings un
til the appeal should be determined. The
Supreme Court says that the question
cannot be determined by a mere inspec
tion of the order appealed from, but the
merits of the order mist be considered.
While tho motion to dismiss remains un
determined It is the duty of the lower
court to refrain from Its enforcement.

SEEKING TO TRACE THE POISON
Detectives Obtain New Clews, Only to Be Baffled
by New Mysteries â Revelations
Made to the Grand Jury.
The tragic mystery of which Mrs.
Cordelia Botkln is still the central
figure is as far from a practical solu
tton as it was when the authorities were
.Informed that a dreadful crime had
been conceived in this city. The police
have now, however, a logical and defi
nite basis upon whtch to build a case.
"Whether or not the incriminating evi
dence will point as a certainty toward
. the woman under arrest remains to be
..seen. -When tho Stockton episode and
all its ramifications faded into nothing
the authorities were forced to begin
again their search for testimony. As
â¢' the mystery prer-ents itself now the de
fectives know that the candy, which
was subsequently poisoned, was bought
at the .Market street establishment of
George Haas. There is a presumption,
. but nothing more, that the purchase
was made early in August, perhaps on
. the .third day of the month. Emma
Ilerber, the girl who sold the candy,
i!<~v*\s not believe that she can identify
â¢ the person who bought it. but she is
.willing to try and will be given an
â¢â¢opportunity by the police. This covers
the ground as far as the candy Incident
is i)>ncerned.
. The police have also another baffling
clew. It has been discovered that the
fiend who murdered two innocent wo
men bought the handkerchief at the
City of Paris. The dainty lace fabric
'was .neatly folded in the box of pois
oned confections. In one corner of it
was a price mark used in this city only
by the City of Paris. The records of
. this establishment show that on Aug
ust 4 pome one purchased such a hand
kerchief for 25 cents. No one at the
store has reason to remember the lncl
. dent. The clew is lost in the maze of
.a daily routine where hundreds of sales
are made and hundreds of people pa.^s
in and out without exciting attention
or comment. But Mm. Botkin is very
well known at the City of Paris. She
went there time after time and made
many purchases. Her face was a fa
. miliar one to more than one person at
the place, but they cannot say that
Eh<? bought the handkerchief. The trail
closes here and there seems to be no
way In which It may be found again
by the seekers.
The authorities have drawn from tho
. incident of the purchase, however, a
strong hope. The candy and the hand
kerchief were bought in the same
neighborhood, a' the City of Paris is
only two blocks distant from Haas'
candy store. The detectives argue that
' the poison was also bought in the
vicinity. A moft thorough inquiry was
made yesterday, but nothing was dis
covered. Every down-town druggist
was closely examined, but not one could
recall the sale of arsenic that might
6hed light on the case.
'. .Beyond these facts the police have
. very little else in the nature of evi
dence. The case of the prosecution, as
it how stands against Mrs. Botkin, may
be very briefly summarized. In the first
place she knew Dunning very well and
expressed on many occasions the deop
. est regard for him. These expressions
were made to her friends and in letters
to Dunning. There is no doubt that the
woman knew of Dunning's purpose to
return to his wife.
In the second place Mrs. Botkin dis
cusstd with every evidence of deep in
terest the subject of poisons and their
effects. This was done a few days be
fore the box of poisoned candy was
sent from this city. Mrs. Rauof and Dr.
Stone, the physician who attended Mrs.
Botkin at Stockton, heard the discus
sion and noted how particularly
the woman talked about arsenic and
â¢ Its effects. In the handwriting of Mrs.
Botkin and in that of the anonymous
â  letters and addresses there are certain
.peculiarities indicating that the same
person wrote all of the epistles and su
perscriptions.
: â¢ T.he Grand Jury is In possession of
BELIEVES SHE SOLD THE CANDY
Miss Emma Herber Thinks She Might Have Sold the
Confections That Carried Poison Across the
Continent.
Miss Emma Herb^r, the young lady who has been brought Into prom
inence through the fact that Phe is said to have sold Mr 3. Botkin the
bonbon box of candy that was con
verted to an unlawful end. Is a very
much aggravated and annoyed per-
Bon. Since her name haa been brought
Into the case she has been an object
of interest to every one who visits
Haas" candy store. Newspaper men
have tried to interview her, but her
solemn promise made to Chief Lees
not to talk she intends to obey.
She has not yet seen Mrs. Botkin
nor does she think she can identify
her as the person to whom she sold
the candy. "I sell about fifty or more
of those boxes a month," she said,
"and it will be difficult for me to
identify the lady as having bought*
one. I will not attempt to do it un
less I am sure of her. I do not care
to visit Delaware as a witness and
will object to going.
"It will be most difficult for me to
many people daily. The bonbon boxes
are . filled with fancy . candy and ;cost 75 cents. We have numerous calls
for such packages and >very little attention is paid to those 'who buy." ,
I these facts and is sufficiently convinced
of their importance to be almost ready
now to indict the woman for sending
\ poisoned confections through the mails.
J Such an indictment will serve tbe pur
; poses of the accused woman's defend
! ers. Mrs. Botkin does not wish to go
to Delaware, and her lawyers Insist
that she cannot be forced to go if she
be indicted on any charge of felony in
I this city.
It Is evident from these facts that the
police have only an indirect case at best
I against Mrs. Botkin. Unless the almost
i hopeless obstacles presented by the
City of Paris and Hass' candy store are
overcome and the purchaser of the ar
senic is found the case against Mrs.
Botkin must remain In a most unsatis
factory condition. The Chief of Police
has not yet changed his original posi
tion. A most horrifying murder has
been committed and certain suspicious
incidents force upon Mrs. Botkin the
necessity of an explanation. That ex-
NOTE AND HANDKERCHIEF SENT WITH BONBONS.
The strongest point so far adduced to connect Mrs. Cordelia Botkin with the murder of Mrs. J. P.
Dunning and Mrs. J. D. I>eane is the remarkable use of quotations, an idiosyncrasy which occurs frequently
in her known writings, in the note which accompanied the poisoned candy and in the anonymous letters. This
strange characteristic convinced the Grand Jury that she should be indicted and held pending the accumula
tion of evidence with which to convict her, if possible, of the double murder.
planation may be priven in a general
denial, which tho accused woman, over
her own signature, has made in The
Call.
LEES STARTS
ON A FRESH CLEW
The Handkercnief Bought at
the City of Paris.
Mrs. Botkin Known at the Store,
but None of the Clerks Re
member Her Purchases.
Another incomplete link in the Dunning
poisoning case was found yesterday by the
police. It was learned that the linen
handkerchief which was laid on top of the
deadly chocolates was purchased at the
City of Paris drygoods store. Whether
Mrs. Botkin bought the handkerchief is
yet to be ascertained.
Yesterday morning Chief Lees went to
the City of Paris and handed the hand
remember Mrs. Botkin. I wait on so
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 18Â»5.
kerchlcf to the clerk at the counter where
these articles are sold, and it was imme
diately recognized as a duplicate of stock
which had been on hand for nearly a
year. The Chief received duplicates and
sent a detective to other drygoods estab
lishments, but no other store in the city
had these identical goods. The prieemark
on the handkerchief la almost conclusive
evidence that it was bought at the City
of Paris. Nearly all the retail stores in
the city use printed pricemarks, which are
obtained from stationery-stores. At the
City of Paris, however, the clerks in the
several departments prepare the price
marks with rubber type. These marks are
consequently irregularly printed, and the
figures are frequently out of alignment,
which is not the case where they are
printed by machinery.
The manager of the store and also the
clerk in the handkerchief department un
hesitatingly express the opinion that it
was bought there by the person who sent
the poisoned candy to Mrs. Dunning.
But none of the employes of the City"of
Paris can tell who purchased the hand
kerchief.
At the request of Chief Lees. Manager
Ralney of the City of Paris ordered an
Immediate and systematic investigation,
to discover, if possible, the identity of per
sons who had bought handkerchiefs with
in the past sixty days. Cash tags, which
are made out in duplicate for every sale,
were examined by the bookkeeper, but
with no definite result. Since June 1 hun
dreds of handkerchiefs, singly and in lots,
have been sold by the six clerks in that
department, and when the purchase was
paid for no name Is on the salesman's tag.
Whenever a purchase is charged, sent
c.o.d. or delivered there is, of course, an
accurate record by which it can be traced.
Tho delivery clerk's books and the books
of the firm were rigidly examined, but
nothing to indicate that Mrs. liotkin had
bought a 25-cent handkerchief was dis
covered. Neither hnve there been any de
liveries to Mrs. Botkin or the Hotel Vic
toria, where she resided for several
months.
Any one of the six clerks in the lace
department of the City of Paris might
have sold the handkerchief in question,
but all declare . they would not be able
to identify any one who made a purchase
from them unless there were some pecu
liar circumstances in connection with the
sale, or the customer attracted special at
tention by strange demeanor. Mr. Hack
ett, W. Johansen, V. Kehrlein, George A.
Rice and Miss L. Gorman are the clerks
who wait on customers â  In the lace de
partment. They are all very positive tney
could not identify the person or persons
they waited upon a month ago. Mrs.
Botkin is not known to any of these
clerks and they do not remember selling
a handkerchief to a woman of her de
scription. Each clerk has sold from four
to six single two-bit handkerchiefs since
June 1. but they cannot recall a single
individual customer who made the pur
chase.
Mrs. Pc t.KJn was a frequent customer
at t he* City of Paris, and she visited the
store alineet dally. Two floorwalkers and
several cierks. remember her ' very dis
tinctly. Some time .ago a young man
emtilcyed ; at the , store was very friendly
with hÂ«r ; uni she called to . see him of"
tener than the proprietors thought neces
sary and -the young man was discharged.
The employes who- knew the ' accused
woman say that "she always came to the.
store alone, and they; do not remember
seeing her. -with another lady.
Chief Lees had men out scouring tho
city for a lady who was believed to have
accompanied Mrs. Botkln on a shopping
tour late in July. The Chief hoard a
iurnor th.it the â  imiJriHoned woman had
visited the City of Paris at the time men
tioned, ami that she was accompanied by
a lady. of Mrs: Seeley's appearance. It was
also reported that Mrs. Botkin purchased
a handkei chief â¢on that occasion. â¢ This
strange â woman has not been found. ,
MRS. BOTKIN IS
TO BE INDICTED
Quotation Marks Are Used
Against Her.
An Alleged Similarity in Dots Ap
pearing in Her Known Writing
and the Anonymous Letters.
The secret proceedings of the Grand
\ Jury in the Botkin case came to light yes-
I terday, and it Is given out as a certainty
I that the- alleged poisoner will be indicted
under section 347 of the Penal Code, The
indictment will be granted on the state
ment made to the jury by Chief of Police
Lees, the testimony of Mrs. Raouf and a
| remarkable characteristic which was
i found In the anonymous letters sent to
Mrs. Dunning and the chirography of
Cordelia Botkin.
In presenting the caso to the Grand
Jury Chief Lees made a long and fervid
appeal to the jurors to find a bill against
Mrs. Botkin. that she might be held a
prisoner until evidence strong enough to
convict her of the double murder could
be secured. In his speech the Chief sol
emnly declared he thought the accused
woman was guilty of the diabolical crime
with which she is charged, and said that
he only needed a short time to procure
indubitable testimony which would send
her to the gallows. He also informed the
jurors that Mrs. Botkin had admitted tho
authorship of one of the anonymous let
ters which had been sent from San Fran
cisco to Mrs. running.
Mrs. Botkin and her attorneys are
greatly surprised at the new turn In the
case, although the lawyers have repeat
edly expressed a desire that their client
would be indicted. The statement by
Chief Lees that the defendant had ac
knowledged ehe wrote the anonymous
letter is characterized as a deliberate
falsehood by the imprisoned woman and
her attorneys. Mrs. Botkin emphatically
declares that she never wrote one of
those letters, and states that she has not
admitted to Lees or any one else that
they were written by her hand.
Mrs. Rauof's testimony before the
Grand Jury was startling and sensational.
She did not actually swear that Mrs.
Botkin confessed to her that she sent tho
arsenic-charged chocolates which killed
the two unfortunate sisters, but she
strongly intimated that the accused
woman* made, admissions which practical-
ly amounted to an / acknowledgment of
giult. These admissions were â  mado
while Mrs. Botkin was under an intense
nervous â  strain and suffering from hys
teria. The nurse then told of Mrs. Bot
kin's pointed inquiries of Dr. T. W. Stone
as to the effect of arsenic and what quan
tity of the mineral poison was necessary
to produce -death. According to .; Mrs.
Rauof, the accused woman's questions re
garding, arsenic were made in a jocular
vein, and she Intimated Jokingly that she
might commit suicide. This evidence made
a strong impression on the grand Jurors
and when Chief Lees added ti.at Dr.'
Stone would substantiate Mrs. Rauofs as
sertions the effect was Instantaneous and
marked. - .
. The turning however, in the case
against Mrs.- Botkin, notwithstanding the
m Â°/ a^if, ff ? c 5 of . Mrs - Rauof 's statements
end Chief Lees' speech, is a peculiar
idiosyncrasy which appears In the
anonymous letter, the note inclosed in the
pox of candy and the known handwrit
ng of Mrs. Botkin. This characteristic
is the use of quotation marks.- The sig
nature to the note "With love to yourself
and baby" is . Mrs - C - and the initial a
quoted with two dots above and to the
left of the . letter and two dots directly
beneath the final stroke. - u'recuy
Mrs. Botkin was very fond of using
quotations in her letters, a-nd she in
variably used the old German method of
indlcatinir the words of another. When
the attention of the jurors was called to
this remarkable coincidence in the hand
writing exhibits they became - intensely
interested In the writing and made a rigkl
analytical examination of all the %vritin s
at hand. Very few people use Quotations
T?ntk.n manr itV and . the . fact that Mrs
Botkin has this remarkable character
istic, which Is also found in the note and
anonymous letters, convinced the jurors
that she. is in some way connected with
the heinous crime which has startled the
whole continent. '
Another strange element In this remark
able case Ifl the great difference between
the writing on the note and the super
scription on the wrapper which inclosed
the bonbon box. Local experts have
carefully examined the published repro
ductions of these writings and they ex
press the opinion thai they were written
by different persons. If this is the case
the poisoner either had an accomplice or
used a friend, who unwittingly contrib
uted to the death of Mrs. Dunning and
Mrs. Deano. It is barely possible that the
person who directed the box has beon
found by tho police. Chief Lees is known
tn have statements in connection with
the case which he refuses to give to the
newspapers or even give the names >f the
parties who made them. His object ir
keeping these things hidden is known
only to himself, and like all his official
acts passeth all understanding.
THE POLICE GROPING
FOR EVIDENCE
Examining 1 the Ink of Mrs.
Botkin's Letters.
Chief Lees put in the better part of
the morning with Kytka, the department
photographer and expert, who is prepar
ing bromide enlargements of all of the
documentary evidence that has oeen
gathered in for the Botkln caÃe. The
anonymous letters, the paper in which
the box was wrapped and the specimens
of Mrs. Botkin's script are now in shape
\
to introduce as evidence at the prelim
inary hearing In Police Judge Joachim
sen's court on Wednesday next.
The Chief has also been having a chem
ical analysis made of the inks used in
the different writings for the purpose of
discovering whether or not Mrs. Botkin's
letters were written in the same brand
of ink that the writer of the anonymous
letters and the director of the poisoned
candy used.
Detectives McVey, Gibson, Wren and
Dinaq spent the day inspecting the poison
sales lists of the different drug stores for
a clew to the person who bought the ar
senic that took Mrs. Dunning's llle. They
have not yet finished with their in
quiry.
Mrs. Botkin spent a day of nervous un
rest. The maudlin howls of a drunken
female lodger in a cell across the cor
ridor from the matron's quarters had
driven away her sleep in the night and
this lack of rest, coupled with the ef
fects of her recent inness, have left her
in a distressing condition. Her sister,
Miss Dora Brown, of late spends nearly
all of the day with the accused woman.
Chief Lees has had prepared copies of
all of thq prosecution s exhibits of evi
dence bearing on the case, and these,
with a transcript of the evidence so far
in hand, will be expressed to the Attor
ney General of Delaware.
Mrs. Botkin's Sunday will be spent in
the company of her son, Beverly Botkin,
who will arrive this morning from Stock
ton on the steamer T. C. Walker. Her
husband, W. A. Botkin, is expected to
arrive this afternoon on his regular
weekly visit.
Chief Lees has given rigid injunction to
all of the witnesses of the prosecution to
say nothing whatever to newspaper men
of whatever information they may have
concerning the case. This pressure has
been screwed down hard on Candyman
Haas, and he has instructed the bevy of
damsels who handle his wares to grant
no interviews. The approach of a news
paper man is signal for a general stam
pede to the basement. Mr. Haas posi
tively declines to give out any and all in
formation without first having permission
to do so from the Chief.
Lees* Ostrich-Like Caution.
Chief Lees is carefully guarding from in
spection, a letter written at Healdsburg
by Mrs. Cordelia Botkin to Mrs. Price,
proprietress of the Hotel Victoria at
Hyde and California streets. ' The reason
that the Chief assigns for this absurd se
crecy is that the letter contains matter of
the utmost importance, and that Mrs.
Price has asked him to not give it pub
licity through the newspapers. In an in
terview yesterday Mrs. Price talked
freely of the letter, and said that it was
simply a request that all of Mrs. Bot
kln's mail be forwarded to her at Healds
burg.

OPPOSED TO CIVIL SERVICE.
Lively Session of a Conference Com-
posed of Members of Various
G. A. B. Leagues.
Rep resent atlves from the Union Veter
ans' Patriotic League of California, Ger
fleld League, Harrison Camp, Army and
Navy Republican Veterans' League ac
cepted the invitation Issued by the Anti-
Civil Service League to attend a confer
ence at 405 Montgomery street last night,
and a spirited session resulted. James J.
Moore of the Union Veterans' Patriotic
League was elected cnairman, and J. S.
Ramsay, a representative of the Anti-
Civil Service League, secretary.
In opening the meeting the chairman
stated it was the purpose, of the. confer
ence to solidify the organization and dis
seminate the principles of the league
throughout the State.
A lively discussion then ensued, after
which a committee of two from each organ
ization represented was appointed to con
stitute a campaign committee, the mem
bers to be selected by the chairman by
the next meeting.
A nominating convention will be held In
the near future. It will I 3 composed of
delegates selected by the different organi
zations In the conference and those who
desire to affiliate.
A resolution was introduced by Mr.
Schubert that the conference indorse the
entire ticket nominated by the recent Re
publican State Convention. This pro
voked a spirited and animated discussion,
and the wisdom of puch action without
having the nominees declare themselves
on the civil service matter was severely
questioned. A number of members were
in favor of the candidates being requested
to appear and address the conference. It
was decided to lay the matter over to the
next meeting.

NEW COMEDY
THEATER OPENS
A Crowded House Greets
"The Leading Man."
IT IS A LAUGHABLE COMEDY
THE REMODELED THEATER 13
VERY PRETTY.
A Cordial Reception of the First Pro
duction, Recalls and Flowers
Galore and Everybody
Happy.
The New Comedy Theater, bright and
handsome as a new Easter bonnet, opened
its doors to the public last night under
conditions that made glad the hearts of
Managers Leavitt and Ellinghouse and
thoroughly pleased a fashionable and
critical audience. The alterations and
improvements are so complete that the
old-timo patrons of the former famous
Bush-street Theater could hardly realize
it. Everything is up to date, uniformed
ushers, cozy retiring rooms for ladies
and gentlemen and all things in the way
of comforts that could be expected. In
addition to this the curtain went up
promptly and the play was produced
without a hitch.
"The Leading Man," as presented f>y
the Pacheco comedy company, is an
original and decidedly amusing comedy in
four acts from the pen of Mrs. RomuaMo
Pacheco. The story revolves around the
compulsory exchange of names between
a wealthy young Callfornian, Robert
Fletcher, who stutters dreadfully, and
Frederick Maltland, a prominent actor.
The scenes are laid in two country houses
in "Westchester County, New York, and
the embarrassing and laughable situa
tions growing out of the efforts of the
two men and their Intimate friends to
maintain the deception create the major
portion of the fun. The comedy part is
greatly assisted by the introduction of a
doctor, who is a crank on the subject of
the curative powers of electricity, which
eventually heals the man with the im
pediment in his speech. In the seco/nd act
the leading man, Brigham Royce, is af
forded an opportunity to thrash a bully
ing pYize-flghter and put him out with
Fitzsimmons' pet blow, and the last act
ends with a fast, furious and funny solu
tion of the somewhat complicated puzzle.
Mr. Royce, as leading man, had a con
genial part and played it well, making
a very favorable first impression which
will no doubt be maintained. He has a
good stage presence and, above all, is
natural _
The hit of the evening fell to George
S. Probert as the effeminate and stutter
ing young California millionaire. The
part is a diffcult one. but was most clev
erly handled and won for the young man
unstinted approval. He has the rignt
kind of stuff in him to become a favorite
comedian among San Francisco P' ay
goers. Thomas M. Hunter, as the jolly
scheming husband with a young wife
who he Is disciplining, has a part that
is suited to him an 1 plays it satisfac
torily. Miss Hattie Schell. In the char
acter of a spirited and charming young
lady in love with the masquerading lead-
Ing man. was deservedly well received
and made friends with her auditors at
once. Miss Carina Jordan, in the trying
role of the unwillingly deceitful wife, did
not make of the part all that it is capa
ble of. Less effort in the matter of fa
cial expression would be an improve-
Stewart Allen, as a deserted and dis
gruntled husband; Harry St. Maur. as
the doctor with a fad; James Wlllard, as
the pugilist, and Kate Vanderhoff. as the
adoring wife of the electrician, were well
suited to their respective parts. Tho
minor characters were also pfoperly pre
sented.
â¢ "The Leading Man" was given a warm
and hearty reception, curtain calls and
flowers being plentiful.
The play deserves and doubtlt-ss will
have a successful run, and the new the
ater, as a candidate for public favor,
starts auspiciously.
