DISPATCH BOAT ALBEKT F.
DEWEY, OFF CABANAS, CUBA,
May 12. â (Via Key West, Fla., May
13.) â This evening a force of Ameri
can regular troops landed on Cuban
soil near Cabanas and fought a brisk
skirmish with a greatly superior
body of Spanish troops. The Span
iards lost about twenty killed and
wounded. On the American side one
civilian got a slight scratch.
The object of the expedition was to
land arms, ammunition, clothing and
equipments for the insurgents, but
owing to the Cubans failing to co-
operate, as was arranged, the muni
tions of war were not landed. Scouts,
however, were sent to the insurgent
camp after darkness had set in, and
a further attempt will be made to
land arms to-morrow at daylight.
The expedition, which left Key
West on Wednesday night, consisted
of companies E and G of the First
United States Infantry, numbering
150 men, under command of Captain
J. A. Dorst, of Miles' staff, and Cap
tain O'Connell. It sailed on the
steamer Gussie, and brought 600
rifles, 10,000 rounds of ammunition
and a large supply of food and cloth
ing.
The Gussie, which was accompa
nied by two newspaper boats, arrived
off Havana just after dawn this
morning, and was promptly stopped
by the blockading squadron. We ex
plained our object, and the commo
dore detached the gunboat Manning
as an escort.
Leaving Havana, we steamed west
ward for nearly forty miles, passing
Mariel. About a mile and a half
west of Cabanas the vessels stood
within less than a half-mile of the
shore and anchored. Immediately
several hundred Spanish cavalry ap
peared among the palms and under
growth, evidently quite aware of our
intentions.
There was no use trying to go
ashore in small boats while these fel
lows were there, so the Manning
opened fire with shrapnel at 600
yards. The sound of the guns
brought up the gunboat Wasp, which
was cruising a few miles westward,
and she also opened fire. This proved
too much for the Spaniards, and in a
few minutes we coula see them rid
ing at full gallop for the shelter of
the hills.
Later we found they had left plen
ty of infantry behind them under
cover of the woods.
A boat was lowered from the star
board side of the Gussie. A spirited
scramble as to who should get into
it took place. Every soldier was
eager to go. Finally Captain O'Con
nell, of Company E, and twelve sol
diers put off fqr the breakers. Be
fore the ooat was ten feet away from
the ship another followed. In it
were eleven soldiers and Lieutenant
Colborn of Company G. With mis
directed energy the soldiers tugged
on the oars, and, not being experts,
their progress was slow.
Unable to get over the reef, Cap
tain O'Connell hesitated, but Private
Messier, who was in the bow, solved
the problem by springing into the
water and wading ashore. His ex
ample was quickly followed by all
the men, they dragging the boat.
Many stumbled and went under qji
tirely, but all got ashore safely,
though soaking wet.
Lieutenant Colborn claims the
honor of having been the first United
States soldier in Cuba. It was a
close race between him and Private
Messier.
The men immediately deployed in
a skirmish line, plunged into the
bushes and were lost to view.
While another boat was being low
ered an attempt was made to land
horses. They were made to leap
overboard and then led with halters
by soldiers in a boat. The first
horse became unmanageable and
swam around the ship several times
b?fore he could be headed for the
shore.
While the landing of horses was
occupying the attention of all of the
ships there came the crack of mus
ketry in the brush 100 yards from
shore. Volley quickly followed vol
ley. The firing was Immediately an
swered by our pickets.
For ten minutes the firing was al
most continuous. None of the com
batants could be seen from the ships, j
but pretty soon rising smoke over the j
The San Francisco Call
trees indicated the whereabouts of
the conflict. The soldiers left their
boats on shore, abandoned them and
dashed into the woods to the assist

dently, judging from the firing, at-

tacked by a largely superior force.
On board the Gussie the excite
ment was intense, but perfect disci
pline was maintained. The one re
maining boat was loaded with fif
teen men and started for the shore.
The Manning and the Wasp took
positions 300 yards from shore and
began sending shrapnel over the
beach into the woods beyond. The
shells could be heard crashing
through the trees and brush, which
were set on fire in several places.
On the Gussie the men were or
dered to lie flat on the upper deck
ready to fire on any visible foe. A
few volleys were sent into the brush
over the heads of our boys on shore
to help out the shrapnel. In the
brush the rifles continued to crack
and on the water the guns of the
Manning and the Wasp boomed
steadily.
Foiled in their attempt to surprise
the landing party, the Spanish re
treated. Gradually the firing on
shore ceased, but the gunboats kept
shrapnel screeching through the
woods at intervals for half an hour.
Attracted by heavy firing, the An
napolis came to the assistance of her
consorts, but too late to get into the
game.
Evidently discouraged by their re
pulse, the Spaniards seemed have re
tired to a safe distance. Captain
Dorst, when the firing began, started
for shore in a small boat. A huge
breaker on the reef turned it over
and sent the captain and his com

panions into the water, whence they
waded ashore.
The presence of so large a force of
the enemy, however, made the land
ing of arms and supplies unwise, not
to say impracticable, so Captain
Dorst, after making sure that the
expected insurgents were not in the
vicinity, decided to re-embark.
Darkness was falling and it was
unsafe to leave such a small number
of men on shore, for at night the
gunboats could do nothing. Three
Cuban scouts were mounted and sent
inland to meet the insurgents and to
make an appointment for another at
tempt to-day. They rode along the
beach under cover of the underbrush
for a mile, and then took the path for
the interior. When they had gone
our soldiers returned on board the
Gussie.
Our only casualties were sundry
duckings from which the men suf
fered little inconvenience, and a
slight scratch to a civilian with the
party. While the engagement was
going on the Spaniards fired repeat
edly at the vessels lying near shore.
One buhet struck the pilothouse of
the Dewey and others whizzed mer
rily close by. The Gussie was struck
several times, but no one was in
jured.
INTENSELY BITTER
TOWARD AMERICA
NEW YORK, May 13.â The Herald's
European edition publishes an inter
view with Pierre Loti; a distinguished
member of the French Academy and
navy. Loti is intensely bitter toward
America, He accuses the United
States and England of brigandage in
the matter of the Philippines. He says
the Latin race must resist an Anglo-
American alliance, which is surely
contemplated.
ONLY SEVEN
THOUSAND
TO BE SENT.
Small Army Ex
pected to Hold
Philippines.
NEW YORK, May 13.â The
Herald's Washington corre
spondent telegraphs: Many offi
cers In both the army and navy
have expressed themselves as
very much opposed to the pro
posed plan of s ding an army
of only 12,000 men to the Philip
pines. Ad i ral Dewey, in his
dispatch to the Navy Depart
ment, has intimated that it
would take a large and efficient
army of men to establish and
preserve order among both
Spaniards &.nd insurgents in and
around Manila. The troops that
the administrate . have desig
nated for the Philippi: s are on
the whole unorganised and
v.'holly unfit to hold the respon
sible position to which they have
been ordered. The expedition,
as It now stands, will consist of
a force of 700f> men. It is planned
not to send ihe remainder of the
12,000 troops concentrated at San
Francisco to i ie Philippines for
r.t least two months. The bulk
of actual work will thus fall to
the lot of this first detachment.
The entire population of the
Philippine Islands Is In thÂ»
neighborhood of 18. 000,000 peo
ple. When It is considered that
the United States army will be
obliged to govern tins large
number an army of 7000 men
seems a bagatelle. With this
small army and with the as
sistance of Admiral Dewey's
fleet the United States might
possibly be able to capture Ma
nila, but not the rest of Philip
pine territory.
Army experts who have made
themselves familiar with the
conditions now existing in the
Philippines are bringing all the
pressure possible to bear on the
administration to have the relief
expedition consist of 25,000 men.
This army, they claim, would be
sufficient if properly officered,
armed and equipped to do and
maintain order in the Philip
pines until the close of tb.3 war.
They agree with the Herald that
there is no good reason why an
army of this size could not be
sent. The troops that are to be
mobilized in Washington will
have no actual service and will
be simply an expense to the Gov
ernment. Many advisers of the
President are now urging him
to send the men ordered to
Washington to Manila. Much
dissatisfaction is being expressed
over the delay in getting the
expedition under way. It will be
nine days before any troops will
leave the United States for Ma
nila, and in the meanwhile Ad
miral Dewey is left to hold hia
position as b< -t he can.

Washington, May 13.
This morning's session of
the Cabinet was the shortest
and the most important of the
present administration. Being
hastily convened at 1 1 o'clock
it was adjourned at 11:30.
Within that brief space of time
new war plans were formed
for both the army and navy,
SPAIN'S FLOTILLA NOW
WATCHING THE HARVARD.
ST. PIERRE, Martinique, May 13.â There is a flotilla of eight Spanisn war
ships and seven torpedo vessels in the vicinity of this island. It issupposed that
part of this flotilla is heading northwest. It is positively known that part of the
Spanish flotilla is cruising about Martinique, keeping watch on the United States
auxiliary cruiser Harvard. Spanish torpedo vessels have been running in and
out of Port de France all day. The commander of the Harvard, which is in the
harbor of St. Pierre, has asked permission to remain there seven days to make
repairs to some disabled machinery. The time asked for by the Harvard has
been granted by the French authorities here, but her commander has been noti
fied that when the repairs have been completed he must give twenty-four hours'
notice before leaving. Many flashes of light, presumably signals between war
ships, were seen off St. Pierre last night.
necessitated by the surprising
intelligence that the Spanish
Cape Verde fleet, instead of
being at Cadiz, was off the
French island of Martinique,
only 425 miles distant from
Sampson's fleet at San Juan,
Porto Rico.

plans were to outward ap

had not been hastily consid
ered, for late last night the
President was informed
through the agency of the
Herald and The Call that
one of their dispatch boats
off the Windward Islands
and their regular correspond
ent on the island of Martin
ique had finally located the
Spaniards. This information
was laid before the strategic
board immediately and they
spent most of last night in?
devising plans to meet this
new situation. Consequently,
when Secretary Long this
morning received a cablegram,
from the commander of the
scouting cruiser Yale, from St.
Pierre, island of Martinique,
confirming the Herald and
Call's intelligence, the plans
were already well matured.
Maps were placed before the
President showing thevarious
islands to the east, west and
south of Porto Rico, and the
exact location of the fleet off
Fort de France, Martinique,
and a table showing the rela
â¢tive distances between San
Juan and Martinique, the lat
ter point and Havana, and be
tween Hampton Roads and
Windward Passage.
It was quickly decided that
instead of ordering Captain
Sampson to wait until the-
Spanish fleet approached San
Juan he should be directed
to sail and meet it. The rea
son for this was obvious. It
was known that Admiral Cer
vera's torpedo boats Terror
and Furor, which touched at
St. Pierre, Martinique, latÂ©
Wednesday night, had been,
advised that the batteries of
San Juan had been reduced
and the entrance to the har
bor was guarded by Samp
son's vessels, thereby cutting
them off from their expected
base of supplies. It was
feared that the Spanish ad2
miral might change his course
and either sail south to meet
the Oregon and Marietta or
else seek to evade Sampson
by making for Havana via the
Windward Passage, the chan
nel between Hayti and Cuba.
It was decided that Sampson
had enough coal to last him
for a two days' trip and plen
ty of ammunition, and that it
was wiser to meet the enemy
and give battle rather than
take the chances of again
losing sight of them. Ac
cordingly Sampson was ca
bled to sail immediately for
Martinique and keep a sharp
lookout for the Spaniards.
The scouting cruisers Yale
and Harvard were assigned
to duty to the northwest of
the Windward Islands, the
Yale on the regular steamer
track between^Martinique and
Havana and the Harvard to
keep the^enemy constantly in
sight. The fast newspaper
boats now with Sampson will
also be of invaluable service
to him in this emergency.
So, all in all, any chance of
the Spaniards eluding us is
hardly worth consideration,
but to guard against any pos
sible mischance the flying
squadron at Hampton Roads
was ordered to intercept the
Spanish fleet should it sail
northwesterly for Havana via
the Windward Passage. The
Navy Department officials did
not admit that this is Com
modore Schley's destination,
but there is hardly a doubt of
it. It is 425 miles from San
Juan to Fort de France. If it
shall be decided by the Span
ish to remain there for several
days to coal Sampson's fleet
will give them battle when
they emerge from the harbor.
Our squadron, sailing at a
speed of ten knots an hour,
would cover the distance in
about forty hours, but if this
Spanish fleet is north bound
a battle on the high seas may
be expected to-morrow.
It is believed that the Span
iards will be able to obtain
coal at Martinique, alleging
that they are steaming for one.
of their home ports and,
therefore, exempt from the
operation of the neutrality
law, and that the French sym
pathizers with the Spanish
cause will readily furnish both
coal and other supplies. At
10 o'clock to-night a dispatch
from Martinique says that one
torpedo-boat is in the harbor,
the other six boats outside.
At this morning's brief ses
sion of the Cabinet the inter
esting and important question
was discussed as to what
Sampson should do in case
the Spaniards enter and re
main in the French harbor.
He would be short of coal,
probably, and could not stand
a long vigil. Besides if he
should patrol his ships before
the harbor of France this
would be likely to involve us
in complications with that
nation greater than were
caused by our seizure of the
Lafayette.
It was concluded, how
ever, that the Spaniards
would not tarry long at Mar
tinique, but would sail as
rapidly as possible for either
Porto Rico or Havana after
taking fuel from colliers.
From Martinique to Havana is
about 1600 miles as a ship
would sail via the Windward
Passage ; from Hampton
Roads it is about 1250 miles
to Port au Prince, Hayti, in
*bÂ» Windward Passage, so
that while Sampson's slow
moving fleet might be unable
to catch up with the Span
iards should they cut across
for Havana Commodore
Schley's ocean-going grey
hounds can stop them. Should
the Spaniards conclude to try
to reach Havana without go
ing through the Windward
Passage, but steam instead
round Cape San Antonio, the
western extremity of the isl
and of Cuba, Schley's flyers
would still be able to get
there before them, the dis
tance from Port au Prince to
Havana along the northern
coast being considerably less
than via the southern coast
around Cape San Antonio.
The conclusion is, there
fore, that the Spaniards can
not escape us and that their
fleet will be destroyed within
the next few days. Realizing
this, it was decided by the
President to postpone the in
vasion of Cuba by our land
forces until the Spanish ves
vels are disposed of. The
combined American fleets,
reinforced by the powerful
battle-ship Oregon, will then
bombard the Havana batteries
shell the city, while 60,
000 American soldiers and the
insurgent army will march on
the city from the rear. Alto
gether the prospects are that
the Spanish-American war
will have ended within a
few weeks and passed into
history. This is the belief of
army and navy officers and it
is shared by Washington peo
ple generally.
Among members of the
Cabinet the news of the
Spanish fleet was received
with great satisfaction. None
of them doubted the ability or
purpose of Sampson to de
stroy it His fleet is superior
at nearly all points, and the
result is the test of naval
strength will be awai.ed with
perfect confidence.

judgment. He has been kept

practicable as to events since

MERRITT GOES WITH
SECOND EXPEDITION.
NEW YORK, May 13.â General
Wesley Merritt, commander of
the Department of the East, who
has been appointed military gov
ernor of the Philippines, return
ed from Washington to his home
on Governor's Island late on
Thursday night. When seen to
day he said he probably would
not start for San Francisco for
at least a week. He has been
accompanied by his personal
aides. Lieutenants Strather,
Mott and Hale.
General Merritt said he would
not sail with the first expedition
for the Philippines. That will be
commanded by General Otis,
who will be in command at Ma
nila until General Merritt ar
rives. He will stay in San Fran
cisco to see that the second ex
pedition is properly equipped and
organized.
During the conference with
the President on Thursday after
noon, General Merritt expressed
the opinion that the army of oc
cupation should consist of at
least 10,000 men, and he thinks
that this suggestion will be fol
lowed. General Merritt does not
know who his successor in com
mand of the Department of the
East will be. He recommended
Brigadier General John I. Rogers
for appointment, but thinks he
will be sent with General Miles
to Tampa.

RIO JANEIRO, May 13.â A warship, whose name I cannot mention
because the Brazilian Government forbids the sending of information
about movements of belligerent vessels, returned to Bahia with her
engines disabled. An examination showed that the Injuries were slight

The Brazilian cruiser Tymbera has left Rio for Ba.,a to see that
the guarantee of neutrality is strictly observed at that port.
NEW YORK, May 13 -After an investigation of this dispatch the

that the warship referred to as returning to Bahia disabled was the
United States battleship Oregon, which arrived at Bahia with the Mar

Herald, sailed northward on Wednesday after the vessels had coaled
to their fullest capacity.

Speclnl Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 13.â The Call's
triumph, In bringing about the means
by which the practice of polluting the
drinking water of Sacramento will be
stopped, will not end with this signal
achievement. So thoroughly have the
people been aroused to the dangers of
present conditions that nothing will
satisfy them short of a pure water
supply. Trustee F. F. Tebbets, chair
man of the Water Committee of the
City Council, in speaking of the situa
tion, said this evening:
"Good for The Call for stirring this
matter up. No better service could be
extended to our people than this one,
which has resulted in not only eradi
cating an evil we have contended with
for years, but, in my opinion, has so
aroused the people that they will not
stop until pure, clear water flows
through the mains of Sacramento City.
I have made a study of the various
plans and suggestions offered for the
treatment of Sacramento River water
and have come to the conclusion that
the Warren filter will best answer the
purpose and meet the requirements of
our people. The Warren filter plant
usually consists of a settling basin,
one or more filters, a weir for control
ling the head, together with necessary
pipe connections. This system could
be applied to the present pumping
plant and in no manner alter the pres
ent system, save an alteration which
everybody will favor â that is, clear,
wholesome water. The plan I am in
fav:>r of will be no experiment, as
the: w e are over 100 of these filters now
in use in as many different cities
throughout the United States. I be
lieve that for $30,000 we could erect a
filtering plant In connection with our
present water works that would
furnish us with over 1,000,000 gallons
of pure, clear water a day.
"Now that we are about to submit

the clear-water proposition was dem
onstrated when the vote on it was
taken a few yeare ago, and now that
this plan will i n no manner affect the
city's ownership, but as a matter of
fact will increase her revenue, I am
sure that it will pass by an over
whelming vote. I have lived in Sacra
mento a good many years, and if dur
ing my present term of office I can
contribute my mite to the end of fur
nishing this city with clear water I
shall be satisfied with my work as a
public servant. The time is ripe for
this movement and I shall not stop
until every stone is turned in this step
of progress, advancement, health,
pride and luxury. Our river water
purified is the best water in the world,
and when the day comes that brings
to the homes of Sacramento a supply
that is clear, cool and sparkling, that
day will mark a new. epoch in our
progress."
Henry F. Brown, In speaking of the
project advanced by Dr. Tebbetts,
said:
"I am In favor of obtaining: a clear
water supply, and if the doctor's plan
Is reasonable and certain I shall do all
in my power to secure its adoption. If
for the expenditure of $30,000 we can
provide Sacramento with clear water,
and still maintain the city's proprie
torship, I think we would be recreant
to our trusts not to do it. Why, at this
time the poor people of Sacramento
are paying out enoug-h money every
month for the rental of filters to pay
the interest on $30,000 and provide for
a sinking fund as well! Take the prop,
osition of providing our public schools
with filters: Their original cost added
to the expense of maintaining 1 them in
proper repair would itself pay the in
terest on $30,000. On the other hand,
if we were to raise this amount by the
issuance of bonds the tax would fall
evenly, and where a hundred families
now rent filters at $1 per month, their
pro rata in providing for the interest
on the bonds would be so small that
they would not appreciate it. I am in
favor of clear water for Sacramento,
and as long as I am a member of the
Board of Trustees I shall do all in my
power to bring^it about. Now that the
principal source of our river defile
ment will be suspended, our people
have taken new hope, and will not be
satisfied until the full limit of our pos
sibilities in the matter of pure drink
ing water has been reached."

Silver Republicans Willing to Con

BpecJal Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 13.âT0-mor
row delegations of Democrats, Popu
lists and Silver Republicans will leave
here for San Francisco to attend the
meeting of the fusion committee of the
three parties which is called to meet
at the Palace Hotel on Monday at 2
p. m.
The Populists at this end of the
State are thoroughly alive to the fact
that their State convention has been
called too early, and that this fact
may materially interfere with fusion
arrangements. The Populist city and
county committees have both met and
requested that the State committee
postpone the date from July 12 to some
later time.
Amojig the Democrats here consid
erable dissatisfaction was caused by
the appointment of John W. Mitchell
as chairman of the Democratic end of
the fusion committee. Mitchell has al
ways been opposed to fusion, and his
pretended friendship for fusion now is
regarded with suspicion by those who
really favor it. His appoinment has
caused great dissatisfaction among the
leaders here.
One thing is certain: If the Popu
lists do not agree to change the date
of their convention the motive of hold
ing it so early will soon become appar
ent. It is believed that by pursuing
the policy they have the Populists in
tend to force the nomination of Charles
D. Lane and renomination of Charles
A. Barlow for Congress In the Sixth
District. Silver Republicans here seem
to be willing to concede anything that
is reasonable to bring about a union of
forces. They have no particular can
didates for any office, although they
expect several places on the State
ticket if a union is effected.

INVASION OF
CUBA AGAIN
DELAYED
War Department Suspends
the Movement of Our
Troops.
Its Action Necessitated by the
Coming of the Spanish Cape
Verde Squadron.
TAMPA, Fla.. May 13.â The sighting
of the Spanish fleet off Martinique, it is
thought, will cause another postpone
ment of the sailing of the fleet of trans
! ports to Cuba from Port Tampa. Some
believe that Saturday or Sunday at the
latest had been fixed as the date of em
barkation of the 4000 troops assembled
' here, and that with this end in view
| the work of preparing and loading the
I transports has been rushed night and
j day. Everything in the camp has been
! packed except the tents, and permis
sion to leave camp has been refused to
everybody.
All this hurry and preparation, it is
believed, was on the theory that the
Spanish fleet was at Cadiz, and, with
the rainy season In Cuba practically at
hand, the work of driving the Span
i iards from the island must be done
quickly. Now that there is another
chance for a decisive conflict between
j the American and Spanish fleets army
movements will wait until that conflict,
! which it is hoped will result in the de
i struction of the enemy, will actually
! take place. Should Admiral Sampson
i prove victorious no doubt is enter
| tamed here that orders will be"given for
I instant embarkation and the oppor
! tunity the army has been longing for
i will be at hand.
Trains bearing four companies of the
Sixth Cavalry, with their horses,
wagons and camp outfits, which â  ar
rived here from Chickamauga during
the night, were switched out to the new
camping grounds in West Tampa dur
ing the day. Several more trains are
on the way, including the Third Cava
lry, and the remainder of the Sixth is
expected in before nightfall. The Sec
ond Cavalry and^the four regiments of
infantry from Cntckamauga are not
expected before to-morrow. It is uar
derstood that General Wade and his
| staff will pitch their tents near the cav
alry site and establish headquarters of
the army corps at that point.
WASHINGTON, May 13.â Direct or
ders were given Ge feral Miles this
morning suspending for the present
the movement of the invading army
upon Cuba. General Miles has there
fore postponed his departure for the
South, and it is announced authorita
tively by the War Department that it j
cannot be stated with definlteness \
when he will leave.
The suspension of the movement of j
the fnvading army upon Cuba was in- ;
duced by the proximity of the Spanish i
Cape Verde squadron to Cuban waters. !
It is deemed by the department to be j
the part of wisdom not to risk the land- j
ing of troops on Cuban soil until VV t \mm
landing can be effected under th^T^"'
tection of a stronger fleet than is now i
available for the purpose.
Assistant Secretary of War Melkle
john announced to-day that the depart
ment acquired yesterday two additional
vemels for transport purposes. They j
are the Stillwater and Breakwater, i
both of New Orleans. The twenty-nine
transports now at the disposal of the I
War Department on the Atlantic are
capable in the aggregate of carrying ;
25.000 troops and 10,000 animate. As
soon as the department is prepared to j
start the army expedition to Cuba the
vessels will be concentrated at points
on the Southern coast and the entire
fleet will move to Cuba as a body, un
der suitable escort of warships.
The War Department to-day issued j
orders for the assembling of 29,087 vol
unteers at Chickamauga. These em
brace twenty regiments and five bat
teries from the following States: Wis
consin, Michigan. Minnesota, Indiana,
Illinois, Maine, Missouri, New Hamp
shire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Ver
mont. The troops are divided among

ON BOARD THE FLAGSHIP I
IOWA, OFF SAN JUAN DE PORTO
RICO, May 12.â (Via St. Thomas,
Danish West Indies, May 13.)â The
forts of San Juan de Porto Rico were
bombarded by part of Rear Admiral
Sampson's fleet this morning. The 'â 
enemy's loss is believed to be heavy.
The American loss is two men killed
and seven men injured. After three
hours' firing the admiral with- j
drew the fleet and said:
"I am satisfied with the morning's
work. I could have taken San Juan,
but I have no force to hold it. I j
only wanted to administer punish
ment This has been done. I came
for the Spanish fleet and no* for San
Juan."
Jhe men killed were:
SEAMAN FRANK WIDEMARK
of the New York.
GUNNER'S MATE of the
Ampbitrite.
The latter died from the erfects of 1
the extreme heat.
Of the injured men three were on ;
the lowa and four on board the New j
York. The names of those slightly |
injured on the lowa are:
SEAMAN MITCHELL.
PRIVATE MARINE MERKLE.
APPRENTICE HILL.
The injured on the New York are:
SEAMAN SAMU.SL FELLMAN,
seriously.
SEAMAN MICHAEL MURPHY.
Two other enlisted men are slight
ly injured.
All of these were injured by the
bursting of a shell on the New York.
This is a complete list of the killed
and wounded.
The American ships are uninjured.
The engagement began, at 5:15 a. i
m. and ended at 8:15 a. m. The !
town in the rear of the fortifications
probably suffered.
The ships taking part in the action
were: lowa, Indiana, New York, Ter
ror, Amphi trite, Detroit, Montgomery,
Waumpatuck and Porter. The ene
my's firing was heavy but wild, and
the lowa and New York were prob
ably the only ships hit. They went
right up under the guns in column,
delivering broadsides, and then re
turned. The line passed thrice in
front of the forts, pouring tons of
steel on shore.
It is impossible to judge the
amount of damage done to the build- j
ings and forts. They appear to be
riddled with shot; but the Spaniards
were plucky.
The after turret of the Amphitrite
got out of order temporarily during
the engagement, but she banged ;
away with her forward guns.
After the first passage before ' the j
forts the Detroit and the Montgomery
retired, their guns being too small to '.
do much damage. The Pqtter and j
Waumpatuck also 6tayed out of ,
range. The smoke hung over every- ;
thing, spoiling the aim of the gun- '
ners and making it impossible to tell
where our shots struck. The officers ;
and men of all the ships behaved I
with coolness and bravery. The shots
flew thick and fast over all our
ships.
The men on. the lowa who were
hurt during the action were injured
by splinters thrown by an eight-inch

shell which came through a boat in
the superstructure and scattered
fragments in all directions. The
shot's course was finally ended on an
iron plate an inch thick. Merkle
was struck in the arm and may lose
it. All were hurt by splinters. A
fire was started in the bow, but was
quickly extinguished.
Morro battery, on the eastern arm
of the harbor, was the principal point
of attack. Rear Admiral Sampson
and Captain Evans were on the lower
bridge of the lowa and had a narrow
escape from flying splinters, which
injured three men. The lowa was
hit eight times, but the shells made
no impression on her armor. The
weather was fine, but the heavy
swells made accurate aim difficult.
The broadsides from the lowa and
the Indiana rumbled in the hills in
I shore five minutes after they were de
j livered. Clouds of dust showed
; where the shells struck, but the
; smoke hung over everything. The
i shells screeching overhead and drop
; ping around showed that the Span
i iards still stuck to their guns.
At 3 o'clock in the morning all
| hands were called on the lowa, a few
j final touches in clearing ship were
made, and at 5 "general quarters"
sounded. The men were eager for
! the fight. The tug Waumpatuck
went ahead and anchored her small
! boat to the westward showing ten
1 fathoms, but there was not a sign of
1 life from the fort, which stood boldly
against the sky on the eastern hill.
The I>etroit steamed far to the east
ward, opposite Valtern. The lowa
headed straight for the shore. Sud
denly her helm flew over, bringing
the starboard battery to bear on the
fortifications. At 5:16 a. m. the
lowa's forward twelve-inch guns
thundered out at the sleeping hills,
and for fourteen minutes she poured
starboard broadsides on the coast.
Meanwhile the Indiana, the New
York and other ships repeated the
dose from the rear. The lowa turned
and came back to the Waumpatuck's
boat and again led the column, the
fort replying fiercely, concentrating
on the Detroit, which was about 700
yards away, and the batteries on the
eastward arm of the harbor. Thrice
the column passed from the entrance
! of the harbor to the extreme eastward
battery.
Utter indifference was shown for
the enemy's fire. The wounded were
quickly attended, the blood was
washed away, and everything pro
ceeded like target practice.
At 7:45 a. m. Admiral Sampson
signaled "cease firing." "Retire"
; was sounded on the lowa, and she
headed from the shore. The Terror
was the last ship in the line, and,
failing to see the signal, banged
away alone for about a half hour,
the concert of shore guns roaring at
her and the water flying high around
her, from the exploded shells. But
she possessed a charmed life, and re
luctantly retired at 8:15.
As at Matanzas, the unsatisfactory
condition, the smoke and the dis
tance prevented any important con
clusions being drawn. The town of
San Juan must have suffered, al
though protected by the hills, as high
shots must have reached it. No
traces of the bombardment were dis
cernible on the forts except small
fires, which were apparently extin
guished before the fleet left.
POOR MARKSMANSHIP
OF SPANISH GUNNERS.
Some Projectiles From the Batteries
Fall a Mile Beyond Their
Target.
ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH-BOAT DAUNT
LESS, via ST. THOMAS, D. W. 1., May
13. â The forts of San Juan de Porto
Rico have been bombarded by a por
tion of the fleet under the command of
Rear-Admiral Sampson. The remark
able feature of the bombardment was
the bad marksmanship of the Spanish
gunners', hardly a shot from the } forts
striking the ships. . Most of the pro
jectiles fell ; very wide. At the close
of ; the bombardment the fortifications
had a very dilapidated appearance, but
the gunboats were as active as ever. .
The United States monitor Terror had
a magnificent half-hour duel with the
forts. The batteries bravely threw
shot and ; shell at her until she seemed
to occupy the center of a great basin.
The Spanish gunners were crazed â¢ ;by
excitement and sometimes dropped
their shells a mile away. The Terror
fired one shot to the fort's ten 7 and
when the monitor retired she , did ;so
slowly contemptuously, still firing at
the Spanish forts. The Spaniards con
tinued to fire on her until she was
miles out of range. _
After the engagement the Dauntless
steamed among the fleet, whose crews
were cleaning the decks and polishing
the Runs The American ; sailors were
said to be not at all excited; : and were
going about their work as .if â : nothing
extraordinary had happened. ,^r

New York had several holes In one of

SPAIN DEPRIVED OF
A HARBOR OF REFUGE.
San Juan Fortifications Destroyed as
a Blow at the Cape Verde
Fleet.
WASHINGTON. May IS.â The Navy
Department was all excitement this
morning upon the receipt of the news
that Admiral Sampson's squadron had
begun the bombardment of San Juan
de Porto Rico, and fuel was added to
the flames when the news came later
that the Spanish flying squadron had
been sighted off Martinique, giving
promise of heavy fighting to come. The
fact that the admiral gave notice of
his intention to bombard San Juan, as
is reported from St. Thomas, is an in
dication that the movement upon San
Juan was not a suddenly conceived
project, but part of a well-matured
plan. Whether or not the orders to the
admiral included a bombardment is not
disclosed at the Navy Department. In
deed there is nothing in Sampson's re
port to indicate that he really did bom
bard the place. He merely attacked
the forts at the entrance of the harbor
and if any shells struck within the
town itself they were stray shots.
It is surmised that Admiral Samp
son's object in making the attack in
this fashion without a landing force of
troops in reserve to occupy the town iÂ£
it were captured was to destroy the
fortifications and make the harbor use
less to the Spanish flying squadron as
a place of refuge.
The fact that the Spanish fleet was
headed yesterday toward the westward
would indicate that it was bound
for the south coast of Cuba, but war
ships in these circumstances try to mis
lead observers ashore.
The information that the Spanish
squadron has been sighted off Marti
nique caused a decided sensation in
naval circles, as this brings close to
Admiral Sampson's squadron the for
midable collection of Spain's strongest
and most modern vessels. It is this
fleet which was reported to be lying at
Cadiz. Evidently the latter report was
inspired by Spanish strategy.
Martinique is a French island lying
about 500 miles east of Porto Rico and
700 miles from the eastern coast of
Cuba. It is one of the outposts of the
West Indies and is the natural point
at which the Spanish fleet coming from
I Cape Verde would first make a landing.
! It must now pass the French island of
i Guadaloupe to the west, the Danish
island of St. Thomas, a little further
west, on its course to Porto Rico unless
Sampson's fleet engages them before
that move is made. As they stand now
i the two fleets are about 500 miles apart,
'< which, by fast sailing, both fleets
| would cover in one day. The sailing
of one fleet would bring them together
in two days, if the other ren.alned sta
tionary.
IMMENSE DAMAGI
DONE IN SAN JUAN.
Number of Buildings Wrecked by-
Projectiles From the American
LONDON, May 13.â The Evening
News this afternoon publishes a dis
patch from St. Thomas, Danish West
Indies, saying San Juan de Porto Rico
surrendered at 6 o'clock yesterday
evening. The dispatch adds that im
mense damage was done to the city
and that a number of important build
ings collapsed. The lowa and Detroit,
according to this dispatch, fired 430
shots with terrible effect.
The dispatch says the Americans did
not attempt to take possession of or de
stroy the town, beyond razing the for
tifications.
All the American warships except the
Montgomery steamed in elliptical for
mation before the fortifications at San
Juan de Porto Rico, which fired
twenty to thirty guns, seven of which
were good ones. The fleet first fired too
low, but at the second discharge they
got the elevation and soon silenced
Morro Castle and set fire to the town,
driving the Spaniards from their guns
repeatedly.
The shore guns fred hundreds or
shots. The New York was hit once
and one seaman was killed and four
were wounded. The lowa was hit once
and two men were slights- wounded.
The dispatch winds up with an
nouncing that the American fleet under
Rear-Admiral Sampson is now outside
of San Juan de Porto Rico awaiting the
coming of the Spanish fleet, command
ed by Admiral Tervera. which was last
reported off Fort de France, island of
Martinique, French West Indies.

NEW YORK, May 13.â President McKlnley received a dispatch late
this afternoon, which came through Haytian sources, announcing the
complete capitulation of the city and fortifications of San Juan de
Puerto Rico. The dispatch was immediately communicated to Secre
tary Long, who presented it to the Naval Strategy Board, which was
then in session. I saw Secretary Long a few moments after the receipt
of the dispatch in question, but he did not say who sent it. He ac
knowledged its receipt, however, and supplemented the President's de
claration of faith in its authenticity.
The Strategy Board, immediately upon receipt of the dispatch, dis
cussed its contents, but nothing could be learned regarding its action.
It was stated by Secretary Long that the dispatch was not from Ad
miral Sampson and that the last communication he had from him
was the dispatch of this morning.
It is understood the dispatch came through representatives of the
Haytian Government in New York and was communicated to the Pres

from Cuba, bearing important dis
patches from General Calixto Garcia,
! commander of the department of the
East of the insurgent army, for General
Miles or General Shafter, commanding
the army of invasion.
Lieutenant Rowan, with a number of
guides, left Jamaica on April 23 to car
ry information to and confer with Gen
eral Garcia. He and his companions
crossed to Cuba in an open boat, land
ing on the coast near Pico OJo del Toro,
province of Santiago de Cuba, and a
little west of the city of that name.
They marched through swamps and
underbrush to the mountains, where
horses were obtained, and thence pro
ceeded to Bayamo. arriving at that
place five days later. They found
General Garcia quartered there with a
guard of several hundred troops, with
headquarters in the principal house
on the main street of the city, which
had been abandoned shortly before by
the Spaniards.
Lieutenant Rowan had a long confer
ence with the insurgent general, who
told him there were ]5.000 troops in his
command, scattered throughout the isl
and. These troops were, General Gar
cia informed him, well supplied with
arms, but lacked ammunition.
General Garcia expressed his joy at
the intervention of the United States.
When Lieutenant Rowan left the in
surgent camp he was accompanied by
General Henry Colazo and Chief of
Staff Colonel Hernandez. They struck
across the country and came out on the
north coast near Manation May 7.
Throughout the journey across the
Island, which was made at the widest
part, Lieutenant Rowan and his com
panions did not encounter one Spanish
soldier. They took a small sailing ves
sel and put out for Nassau.
There were six men on board the
i small craft and the journey occupied
â  two days. An awning and a hammock
: were used for sails and the party suf
| fered much hardship. At Nassau the
I British schooner Peerless was taken
for Key West.
Lieutenant Rowan will leave to-night
for Tampa to hand his dispatches to
the army commander. The substance
of these dispatches and of the lieuten
ant's conferences with Garcia are, of
course, kept secret.

want to tell the whole truth. Bird knew
all the time that I was going to murder
them.
The strange feature of the supple
mentary confession is that the mur
derer does not charge that there was
to be a division of the property between
Bird and himself, thus leaving the mo
tive of Bird a very vague quantity.
Frank Belew is calmer than he has
been in weeks and seems perfectly re
signed to his fate. Arthur Belew was
here to-day and will probably visit his
brother to-morrow. He made the fol
lowing statement:
"I rode up on the train to-day with a
former business associate of Bird. This
man told me that he conversed with
Bird about a month before the murder
and Bird said to him: 'In about a
month I will have plenty of money.' "
Arthur claims to have another wit
ness who heard the plans of Frank
Belew and Bird.

Blanco Reports to Madrid
on the Fighting at Carde
nas and Cienfuegos.
For a Wonder the Governor-Gen
eral Admits That Some Span
iards Were Killed.
MADRID, May 18.â General Blaneo's
dispatch describing the engagement at
Cienfuegos says:
"The Americans fired over 600 shells,
while they attempted to effeot a land
ing with large boats, towed by steam
launches. Some of the boats landed
their men, but the latter were energeti
cally and victoriously repulsed all
along the line. The Americans were
compelled to hastily re-embark and
withdrew with considerable loss, retir
ing in a westerly direction after five
hours' fighting. The attack was made
in combination with bands of insur
gents, who have been put to flight. Our
losses were only two killed and four
teen -wounded."
General Blanco's dispatch also says:
"At the same time they were attack
ing Cienfuegos an attack was made by
the Americans on Cardenas. One of
their larger ships anchored about a
mile from the quays and the enemy
then attempted to land troops, but our
forces, consisting of volunteers and
two companies of infantry, compelled
them to desist. Our gunDoats disabled
one of the enemy's destroyers and
compelled the remaining ships of the
squadron to leave the bay.
"The garrison had five wounded and
about ten were wounded on board the
gunboats. Little damage was done to
the town, though one shell fell in the
British Consulate. The attack had
been planned in co-operation with the
insurgent forces, who were recently de
feated at San Miguel. I have congrat
ulated both the troops and inhabitants
of the town on the strong proof they
have furnished of their loyalty to
Spain. Many of the Americans while
trying to disembark fell under the
Spanish, fire and at Cardenas two of
the inhabitants were killed by shots
from the enemy."
A dispatch received to-night says
that the American ships assembled be
fore Cardenas yesterday, but that her
garrison, which had been reinforced,
repulsed the enemy. Another dispatch
from Havana reports that various en
counters have taken place during the
last few days between the Spanish
troops and the insurgents, in which
the latter have been defeated.
KEY "WEST, Fla., May 13.â Four of
the men killed on the Winslow were
laid to rest in the City Cemetery at
sunset to-day. They were buried in
the shallow lime rocks, side by side
with the graves of the victims of the
Maine. The body of Ensign Bagley
will be sent home for interment.
The bodies were prepared for burial
in the local undertaker's room anfl all
the afternoon curious crowds loitered
about to see what was going on. NÂ«>
friends of the dead men were present.
Little groups of women gathered in the
rear of the room where the caskets
rested, while a constant procession of
visitors filed in and out to look upon
the blackened and disfigured faces In
the coffins.
\t 5:30 the procession started for the
cemetery, followed by a military escort
of marines and sailors from all the
ships in the harbor. Commodore Kim
ball of the torpedo flotilla in command
and seamen acting as pall-bearers. It
was an impressive scene as the four
hearses, followed by soldiers and sail
ors passed through the narrow, dirty
streets to the cemetery. Once arrived
there the bodies were quickly lowered
Into the graves. The Rev. Dr. Gilbert
Higgs Â°f St. Paul's Episcopal Church
read the burial service with a mixed
multitude crowded about.
When the burial services were ended,
three volleys were fired by the marines
over the open graves, and the bugle
stvnded the sad farewell.
The torpedo boat Winslow damaged
at the engagement at Cardenas came
hpre last night under her own steam,
in charge of Ensign Bailey, from the
Wilmington. It is believed the torpedo
boat can be repaired and may be ready
for active service again in a few weeks.
Two of the seamen aboard were badly
Injured They say that one of the
crew who was standing in the conning
tower had his coat literally shot away,

WASHINGTON, May 13.â Major-
General Fitzhugh Lee, who is spoken of
as the most likely man for the post ot
Military Governor of Cuba until the re
public is established, says that Car
denas, which was attacked by four
American gunboats, was an important
point strategically to be possessed by,
the United States forces.
"About twenty miles back In the
country at Jovellanos, I think it is," ha
said, ''all the railroads of Cuba form a
juncture, and, with Cardenas in the
hands of the Americans, the Invest
ment of Havana would be materially
advanced by the possession of that
place. No supplies could reach Ha
vana by the regular channels from the
interior, and, with the blockading fleet
in front of the city, its fate would soon,
be determined finally. In my opinion
the attack upon Cardenas was for the
purpose of getting at Jovellanos."
Referring to Ensign Bagley, General
Lee said: "He was a gallant lad, and
I am sorry he is gone. He was a.
worthy fellow and brave as a lion. I'll
bet he made a good fight. But we must
not take our losses too much to heart.
War means bloodshed upon both sides
and we are bound to lose many brave
lads before we drag the yellow ensign
of Spain from the ramparts of Morro,
Cabanas and others of the strongholds
of the enemy."
GOVERNMENT BUYING
COAL AT VICTORIA.
Contract for a Large Quantity of Fuel
Awarded to a Canadian.
Firm.
SEATTLE, May 13.â Although coal
has been declared a contraband of war
since the country took up arr i against
Spain the United States Government
has just closed a contract with Robert
Duns.nuir & Sons of Victoria for some
8500 tons of Comox coal. The bulk of
the fuel purchased by the Government
Is Intended for the Port Orchard naval
station, where it will be kept in bunk
ers for the coaling of United States war
vessels. The United States monitor
Monadnock, now lying at Port Angeles,
has received about 250 tons of coal from
British Columbia.
This is following out the policy of the
Government in the past to favor Brit
ish Columbia coal for the war vessels
that came to Puyet Sound. This has
been done for years although coal can
be purchased at Seattle for $2 less a
ton and steam tests made on the Gov
ernment ships show but 2 per cent in,
favor of the Comox coal in the highest
tests of the latter. The coal at What
com from the Blue Canyon mines
showed fully as well as the BritiÃh,
Columbia coal under steam tests.
Local coal dealers explain this trend
of Government patronage by saying
that years ago, before the mines of the
Washington coast had been opened,
the Government was compelled to pur
chase its coal in British Columbia. The
heads of the Bureau of Equipment got
into the habit of buying British Colum
h a. coal and did not change to Wash
ington coal when the opportunity wal
presented.

CHANCES OF
A SEA FIGHT
INCREASED
The Flying Squadron Sails
South to Join With
Sampson.
There Is Good Prospect of Battle
Between the Combined Fleets
That May End the War.
WASHINGTON, May 13.âConsider
able speculation has been Indulged in
to-day at the Navy Department as to
the prospects of a sea light between
Admiral Sampson's squadron and the
Spanish Cape Verde fleet. It is believed
that he will be able to Intercept them,
should they make a dash for Cuba, but
if they should get past his vessels they
would make it warm for our ships on
blockade duty off CienfuegOS on the
south coast. They could not stand for
a moment against the big Spanish
armored cruisers and yet are not fleet
enough to escape if they are sighted.
Should Sampson sight the Spanish fleet
it is not certain that he could engage
them provided the Spanish admiral
found it to hiÃ interest to decline the
engagement. The Spanish ships are
faster than anything Jn the American
squadron with the possible exception
of the New York.
If Sampson should fall in with them,
however, and find the Spaniards in a
lighting humor he would have the best
of it at far as chances can be calcu
lated from a simple calculation of the
respective number; of armored ships
and guns. The big battleships, Indiana
and lowa, though 25 per cent slower
than the Vizcaya class, far overmatch
them in offensive and defensive power.
Their armor belts and turrets could
not be pierced at a righting range of
2000 yards by the biggest gun mounted
by the Spaniards, while the 12 and 13
inch guns of our battleships could per
forate the Spanish armor belts. The
New York, however, Is inferior both in
offensive power and armor to the Span
ish vessels, though she might hold her
own by superior management and gun
nery.
If Sampson hap taken his whole fleet
the monitors Amphitrlte tnd Terror
would make up more than a balance of
power against the Spaniards, allowing
the cruisers Montgomery, Detroit and
Marblehead as a force sufficient . to
take care of the Spanish torpedo boat
destroyers. The latter, however, are
almost untried elements in actual war
fare, and some naval officers fear that
they are much more dangerous foes
than the ordinary strategists allow in
their calculations.
Secretary of the Navy Long this
morning received official advices from
Martinique, Windward Islands, that
the Spanish fleet had been sighted to
the westward of that island. Martin
ique is about 600 miles in a southerly
direction from San Juan, Porto Rico,
where the American squadron?, under
Admiral Sampson was in action yester
day. The Spanish vessels off Martin
ique compose the formidable squadron
recently collected at the Cape Verde
islands, and which sailed from there in
a westerly direction two weeks ago.
Upon receipt of this information Sec
retary Long immediately ordered
Commodore Schley at Hampton Roads
to put to sea at once with the flying
squadron, and it will sail to-day. While
Its destination is not known it is be
lieved that the squadron has been sent
In pursuit of the Spanish squadron.
It is learned that the Spanish fleet
was sighted on the morning of the day
before yesterday off the north coast of
Martinique and was again sighted yes
terday morning on the West Coast,
hull down, and the indications are it is
taking a full supply of coal at Mar
tinique to replenish the bunkers ex
hausted by the European trip.
NEWPORT NEWS. Va. May 13.â
Five vessels of the flying squadron, led
by the flagship Brooklyn, steamed out
of Hampton Roads this afternoon, and,
after passing the Virginia capes, took
a southerly course, going, It is said, to
augment Admiral Sampson's fleet, now
In the vicinity of Porto Rico.
The order directing the squadron to
put to sea came at midnight last night.
A few minutes later the signal, "Be
ready to put to sea at daybreak," was
flashed from the flagship. Back from
the men-of-war came the answer. In a
jiffy the men were summoned to the
decks and the work of making the ships
ready to sail commenced. Suppressed
excitement prevailed. The little steam
launches were hoisted aboard and decks
cleared. Then the men waited for the
signal to "weigh anchor."
Day broke, but the signal was not
hoisted. The day wore on toward noon,
and until the sailing flag was seen
small craft ran to and fro carrying dis
patches. Excitement gave way to im
patience, for the men had been lying
off Old Point Comfort for the last six
weeks, waiting for orders to go to sea,
and they were afraid they were to be
disappointed. But not so. At 4 o'clock
a signal ordering the battle-ship Mas
sachusetts, the Texas, dispatch boat
Scorpion and the collier Sterling to
weigh anchor was run up to the top of
the Brooklyn's military mast. Thirty
minutes later smoke "was curling from
the ships and they were plowing the
sea at a rate. of fifteen. knots. !
Hundreds of people, mostly the
guests at the hotels. Including the
wives and daughters of the officers of
the ships, stood on the dock and waved
godspeed to the men who were going
to do battle for their country. After
passing through- the capes the Scorpion
took the lead, acting as a scout.
The fleet will Join Admiral Samp
son's squadron. This statement came
from a reliable source. The ships
passed the capes at 7:15 o'clock. After
reaching the open sea, it is said the

Pears'
Get one cake

Nobody ever

I vessels took the middle course, pro
ceeding under full steam. The cruis
ers Minneapolis and New Orleans were
left behind, as was also the auxiliary
cruiser St. Paul, which is still an
chored in the harbor here, taking on a
! supply of ammunition.
At 8 o'clock to-night the Minneapo
lis hauled up her anchors and steamed
i out at full speed to overtake the squad
ron. It has been reported that the St.
Paul, Captain Slgsbee commanding,
and the New Orleans would not leave
before daybreak to-morrow, but late
this evening Captain Sigsbee received
orders to proceed at midnight. She
will join the New Orleans at Old Point
Comfort and both vessels will
then put to sea. They are ex
pected to overtake . Commodore
Schley sometime to-morrow even
ing or early Sunday morning. The
fact that the Sterling, laden -with 4000
tons of coal, accompanied the fleet, in
dicates that a long sail is contempla
ted. The arrival of the Hying squad
ron will greatly strengthen Admiral
Sampson's fleet.
There is another report In circula
tion to-night that a flotilla of Spanish
torpedo-boats has been sighted cruis
ing along the Atlantic Coast and that
the flying squadron has been, ordered
out to intercept the fleet and sink the
boats, but an officer from the St. Paul
says no credence should be placed in
the rumor. Commodore Schley left
under sealed orders.
ST. PIERRE. Martinique. May 13.â
One Spanish torpedo boat is at Port de
France. Six others are hovering around
the coast. The American auxiliary
cruiser Harvard will be allowed to re
main here for an indefinite period for
the purpose of making repairs to her
machinery, but must give twenty-four
hours' notice before leaving. Six Span
ish cruisers are reported to have been
seen off St. Pierre, but the report lacks
confirmation.
LONDON, May 13.â special dis
patch from Madrid says that immedi
ately upon being informed of the bom
bardment by the United States fleet of
San Juan de Porto Rico. Senor Sagasta
conferred with Admiral Bermejo, the
Minister of Marine. . who . forthwith
wired urgent instructions to the com
mander of the Cape Verde squadron.
MADRID, May 13.â There is great
excitement among public officials over
the news of the arrival of the Spanish
fleet at Martinique. It is now said the
ships went there on purpose to coal
and that two trans-Atlantic steam
ers loaded with coal were awaiting
them at Fort de France. Another Im
portant object of the fleet was to com
municate with the Spanish Govern
ment and ascertain the whereabouts of
the American fleet. Admiral Cervera ;
now knows everything which has trans
pired since his departure from the Cape
Verde Islands and he has full instruc
tions as to his future movements. The
fleet will leave Martinique immediately
for an unknown destination and it is
added that some days may elapse be
fore the Spanish ships are again heard
from. Great anxiety has been felt in
official circles here since the receipt of
the news of the bombardment of San
Juan de Porto Rico by Rear Admiral
Sampson's fleet. A dispatch received
from Fort de France, island of ' Mar
tinique, says enthusiasm is great
among the crews of the Spanish ships
there. Government officials refuse to
say anything about instructions cabled
to Admiral Cervera,
Many of the newspapers express sat
isfaction at the arrival of the Spanish
squadron at the island of Martinique,
while others question the wisdom of
opposing the Spanish ships to those of
Rear Admiral Sampson's fleet, which
is admitted to be superior to the Span
ish fleet The naval and military men
in' this city say they t would have pre
ferred to have Admiral Cervera steer
direct for the coast of the United
States and bombard American ports.
An unconfirmed rumor is in circula
tion and was flying about the chamber
to-night that "after its defeat before
Porto Rico the American squadron en
countered the Spanish squadron, which
inflicted considerable damage on the
enemy."
NEW YORK, May 13. â Senator
Chandler, former Secretary of the
Navy, was among Secretary Long's
callers to-day. When asked if the ap
pearance of the Spanisn squadron at
Martinique did not indicate that the
Spanish authorities at Cadiz had suc
ceeded In misleading us .he said: "Not
very much. It only succeeded in hav
ing Sampson throw away some of his
ammunition."
A special from St. Thomas to-day re
ports Admiral Sampson has left San
Juan to meet the Spanish fleet said to
be near the island of Martinique.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 14, 1898,
DID FRENCHMEN
MAN THE GUNS?
Suspicion That Lafayette
Carried More Than
Dispatches.
American Seamen Think Tht
Spaniards Were Peculiarly
Accurate at Cardenas.
But tho State Department Does Not
Believe the Steamer Took Contra
band of War to Havana.
Bpectal Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, May 13.â A dispatch
from Washington says: The possibil
ity of diplomatic complications be
tween the United Stat and France is
suggested by this question, which is
agitating naval officers at the capital:
"Did French experts man the guns
that carried death to live American
sailors on the Winslow?" The suspi
cion directed against France is due to
two causes â the recent blockade run
ning experience of the French steamer
Lafayette, which was released after
being held up by the blockading fleet,
and the improvement of the gunners
manning the guns on the Spanish
forts. The improvement is so notice
able, according to naval experts, that
it indicates the Introduction of new
and more experienced hands, when
considered with the previous work of
the Spanish gunners, who could not
send a shell within half a mile of a
man-of -war, much less strike a 140
ton torpedo-boat.
Reports from the American fleet
blockading the Cuban coast received
during the last four or five days have
credited the Spanish gunners with
much better markmanship than has
formerly been given them.
According to naval officers, the sur
prising efficiency manifested in the re
cent work could not be logically ex
plained by natural improvement due
to practice. Tile Spanish gunners who
have been bobbing away at the block
ading fleet for ten days prior to Tues
day were reported to be so bad as to
merit the deserved contempt of the
youngest powder monkey in the Amer
ican service.
Naval officers In gunnery argue then
that gunners who have brought havoc
to the little Winslow were not the same
as those who have been operating the
guns at Cardenas, Havana and Ma
tanzas during the blockade. They are
inclined to believe that the men who
did the work are new-comers, better
trained and more expert than the
Spaniards, and their deduction in
spires the suspicion against the
French line steamer Lafayette, which
by act of courtesy of this Government
was permitted within the lines of the
blockade for the ostensible purpose of
delivering dispatches to the French
Consul at Havana and deporting
French residents who desired to leave
the Cuban capital.
PARIS, May 13.â A semi-official note
Is issued this afternoon denying the re
port that a number of French artillery
men were landed at Havana by the
Lafayette, Which w-as allowed to enter
that port recently. The note adds:
France has not departed and will not
depart in any way from the rules of
the treaty.
WASHINGTON, May 13.â The State
Department to-day gave out tho follow
ing:
In view of widely published reports that
the French mail steamship Lafay
ette, which was recently permitted to
enter Havana and discharge her official
mail, had violated the neutrality under
which the privilege was accorded her by
the Government of tho United States, it
is authoritatively stated that the Depart
ment of State has been satisfactorily con
vinced that nothing of the kind was done;
that no merchandise whatever, no con
traband of war, and no gunners were re
cently landed at Havana by the La
fayette.
The statement was given out as a re
sult of representations received from
the French Embassy. The French Em
bassador has been sincerely anxloui to
maintain the good feeling existing be
twen this country and France, and he
feared that some recent publications to
the effect that the Lafayette had car
ried guns and ammunition Into Ha
vana in time might become accepted
as a fact. He also looked upon these
statements as reflecting upon the char
acter of the French Government, as
well as upon himself, as he had given
assurances that no contraband of war
was landed by the Lafayette. The Em
bassador's views were presented to Sec
retary Pay by Secretary Thiebaut,
First Secretary of the French Embassy,
Embaesador Camhon being confined to
his room by slight Illness. As evidence
of the complete sincerity of the line of
action relating to the Lafayette, the
Embassy took the unusual course of
showing, all the private dispatches pass-
Ing between the Embassy here and the
French Consul-General at Havana.
These, together, with the manifest of
the Lafayette satisfied Judge Day that
any published reflections on the course
of the French authorities were erro
neous. He assured the French officials
that the State Department had never
shared In these reports, and In order
that all misapprehension on the sub
ject might be cleared up he directed the
foregoing statement be made public.
HORRORS OF THE
WAR IN CUBA
Spaniards Appeal to the Insur
gents in Vain to Fight
the Americans.
NEW YORK, May 13. â A dispatch from Nuevitas, Cuba, by way of
Nassau, N. P.. says: Chaos reigns at Camaguey and famine at Nuevitas.
Every boat in this harbor, steam and sail, has been jammed into the nar
row channel, to be sunk at the first sign of an attack. Two thousand
soldiers guard the entrance, twelve miles from the city, and four old can
non have been mounted on an island in the harbor. People are starving.
Salt pork costs $1 50 a pound, rice 50 cents, and goats bring $100 each.
The Spanish commander told the starving citizens to go into the country,
as he could not feed them. Many soldiers arc joining the insurgents to
get food.
The conditions at Puerto Principe are still worse. The surrounding
forts are almost abandoned. A column of 5000 Spaniards started for
Moron, carrying a flag of truce. When fired upon by the insurgents the
commander sent word that he was no longer making war upon Cubans,
but went to the coast to fight Americans. General Lopez then replied:
"Spain cannot fight the United States without fighting us.
Their war is our war," and again opened fire.
The Spaniards lost 000 men in the four days' march to the sea.
Pacificos, spongers and fishermen are being pressed into the Spanish ser
vice. The Spanish columns on the way to the coast are burning all the
country homes. President Masso has ordered Generals Gomez and
Garcia to meet himself and Cabinet at Moron trocha, where there will be
a concentration of Cuban forces.
READY TO INVADE CUBA
AND THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, May 13.â 1n an Interview to-day General Miles said: "Every
arrangement for the Philippine expedition Is made. General Merritt will go
with the expedition and take charge of the troops when a landing at Manila is
made. He Is now in Washington, but will go to New York to arrange matters of
his department in the East preparatory to his departure. When will the expedi
tion leave? Soon as possible. It may go before General Merritt gets to San
Francisco. He will stop at Washington on his way to the Pacific Coast, and he
can follow the expedition if It has already left. I do not know the exact date

MAHER BEATEN
IN ONE ROUND
Joe Goddard Whips the
Irish Champion in
a Punch.
Sort of Pivot Blow Delivered
While Avoiding One of
Peter's Rushes.
Tims of the Sensational Combat Just
One Minute and Fifty-One
Seconds.
Bpectal DiÃDatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, May 13.âPugilis
tic history was made very rapidly at
the Arena to-night, when, in one min
ute and fifty-one seconds of combined
sparring and fighting, Joe Goddard, the
"Barrier Champion," retired Peter Ma
her with a sort of pivot punch -which
was delivered so suddenly that hardly
a spectator realized what had come off.
Up to the time he received his quietus
Maher looked like a winner. What few
punches had been landed were in his
favor. As a matter of fact, Goddard
landed the punch which proved so dis
astrous to Peter while trying to escape
from one of the latter's vigorous on
slaughts near the ropes.
It was evident that Goddard was in
the better physical condition of the
two. He looked several pounds lighter
than upon the occasion of his memora
ble encounter with Peter at Coney Isl
and, and displayed a shiftiness of foot
that was surprising in one of his years.
Maher took the initiutive, essaying
a left-hander, which fell short. Maher
finally landed with his left hard on
Goddard's jaw. Goddard swung for the
body and landed, but it did not amount
to much and a clinch followed. As soon
as the men broke away, Maher again
took the offensive, landing with his long
left on Goddard's face, the Barrier
champion retaliating with the right on
the body.
Maher rushed Goddard to the ropes.
There was a slight mix up. Suddenly
Goddard, who appeared to be breaking
away, brought his right around in a
backward movement. The end of his
glove caught Maher on the jaw, about
the face â whether on the Jaw, where
Goddard says it did, or on the cheek
bone, where Maher says it did, will
probably never be revealed. As Maher
received the punch he was partly trip
ped by Goddard. whose right foot cov
ered one of Maher's. Peter fell face
forward, striking the floor with a great
deal of force.
When Maher went down the specta
tors thought it was only an ordinary
knockdown, but the referee told off the
fateful ten seconds and Maher was
still on the floor. It was fully ten sec
onds beyond that time before he arose
to his feet. The time of the fight was
Just one minute and fifty-one seconds.
LIVES LOST IN A SAN
ANDREAS MINE DISASTER-
SAN ANDREAS, May 13.â A gloom is
cast over this community this evening
by the loss of twn citizens, while a third
lies hovering between life and death. The
three were victims of an explosion in the
Ford mine on the outskirts of town. They
were at the bottom of the shaft, at a
depth of 740 feet, when the accident oc
curred. Al Pettle. the survivor of the
trio, says:
"George Baird. the underground fore
man. Charles Palmer and myself had just
charged ajid touched off sixteen holes be
fore coming off the shift. All three
climbed on the skip and signaled to hoist.
Instantly one of the blasts was exploded,
the shock knocking- Baird and Palmer
from the skip. I fell back into the skip
and knew nothing more until brought to
the surface."
It is the general opinion of miners that
the accident was caused by a quick fuse
which exploded before the unfortunate
men had time to get out of harm's way.
All three victims of the accident were
married, their families residing her*.
George Baird was prominent in Native
Son circles, being a member of Plymouth
Parlor, Amador County. Charles Palmer
was a member of the local I. O. O. F.
BOKE IS NOT
EVEN CENSURED
San Rafael's Board of
Education Acquits the
Principal.
No Evidence in Support of the
Charges Against Him
Heard.
Dismissal or the Accusation An
nounced After a Star- Chamber
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 13.â The City
P.oard of Education, at a meeting held
to-night behind closed doors, acquitted
Principal George H. Boke of the local
high and grammar schools of the
charge of gross ineompetency pre
ferred by Vice-Principal A. C. Abshire.
The so-called investigation was con
ducted in a remarkable manner, no
evidence in support of the charges be
ing considered, and only the accused
man and his accuser being heard. The
doors were locked during the proceed
ings, and even District Attorney Mar
tlnelll was turned away by the man
on guard.
Professor A. C. Abshlre was first
called to present his charges. He read
them, the charges alleging executive
Inefficiency on the part of Principal
Boke, failure to lay out a proper course
of studies, a:id rank favoritism in the
promotion and graduation of pupils.
On being asked for specific instances,
Professor Abshire said that last fall
the teachers told the principal a certain
boy was not a fit subject for promo
tion, but the parents brought pressure
to bear on the principal and the boy
was promoted. Last year, when the
students from the eighth grade re
ceived diplomas of graduation, all the
teachers voted that a certain girl should
not be given a diploma, but the girl's
mother came and made a mother's plea
and the girl was promoted, not on
merit, but out of a spirit of sentimen
tality on the part of Principal Boke.
On another occasion two boys were
given diplomas of graduation, although
they la-eked nearly a year of complet
ing the course.
These boys, so Professor Abshire de
clared, received only an average of 30
per cent in their examinations and all
the teachers voted against their re
ceiving diplomas. The parents came to
6ee the principal and said they would
"make things warm for him if he dfd
not give the boys diplomas. Mr. Boke,
said his accuser, tried to compromise
with an offer of blank diplomas. This
being refused he offered proper di
plomas, to be returned by the pupils
in a short time. The parents still ob
jected and the boys received their di
plomas.
Professor Abshire said this practice
tended to demoralize the school, be
cause it put the senior class of this
year In a position at the end of the
first half-year to demand that their
records be raised, simply because of
their knowledge of the principal's
weakness.
Principal Boke was asked either to
affirm or deny the charges. He refused
and would not give any reasons. Ab
shire personally requested him to affirm
or deny in order that the pupils might
be brought forward as proof. Mr. Boke
clung to his original decision.
A copy of a statement signed by sev
eral teachers was produced and shown
to Professor Abshire. It was to the
effect that the course of study was as
good as It ever was. Professor Ab
shire replied that this subterfuge was
an evasion on its face, as the course
never was good. He said he could not
conscientiously sign the statement
himself.
When the principal and vice-princi
pal were requested to retire they did
so, Mr. Boke stopping to pull down the
window blinds in order that a crowd
on an adjoining roof could hear none
of the proceedings.
The board then continued lte star
chamber proceedings, to the tune of
hisses and catcalls from the crowd out
side.
In a short time it adjourned and went
home.
Dr. Jones, who Is known to be Mr.
Boke'3 defender, paid all the evidence
had been duly considered and It war
ranted a dismissal of the charges.
"Did you take the trouble to hear
anybody outside of Mr. Boke and Mr.
Abshlre?" queried a bystander.
With a flush on his face t^e chair
man pretended not to hear the ques-
tlon. _________

SMALL CROP OP WHEAT.
Dealer Predicts California's Output
Will Not Exceed 150,000 Tons.
STOCKTON. May 13.â The full effects of
the wheat crop failure are now apparent.
M. P. Stein, a large dealer, says:
"I am willing to go upon record as say
ing that there will not be more than 150,
000 tons of wheat harvested in California
In 1898, and the average California wheat
crop is between 750.000 and 800.000."
Captain J. W, Smith says there will not
be more than one-twentieth of a crop In
San Joaquln County, and that that Is a
conservative estimate. Perry Yapel of
the firm of Yapel & Co. of Rlpon says
farmers will not even raise seed. Some of
the summer fallow land will raise a llt
tle wheat, but there will be no barley at
all. It is being cut for hay now.
EXPLAINED BY
CHAMBERLAIN
Why England Desires an
Alliance With This
Country.
Great Britain May Be Con
fronted by a Combination
of Powers.
War Would Bo Cheap If the Stars
and Stripes and Union Jack
Should Wave Together.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 13.â The Rlg-ht Hon
orable Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary
of State for the Colonies, made an im
portant speech on public affairs at Bir
mingham this evening. Mr. Chamber
lain, after deprecating the constant as
sertions in certain quarters that Lord
Salisbury was "discredited," and the
Government "weak and vacillating,"
said:
"If foreign countries believe and act
upon these statements, they will find
themselves much mistaken, and that
courteous diplomacy and graceful con
cessions are not incompatible with a
firm maintenance of the country's
honor and interests."
He then declared he intended to
make a "plain statement of the facts,
unfettered by the mysteries and reti
cences of the diplomacy of half a cen
tury ago, which, without revealing se
cret negotiations, should be understood
by the people."
Mr. Chamberlain said he would ac
cept the judgment of the people as
willingly as that of the wisest diplo
matist in the world. Referring to the
policy of strict isolation that England
has pursued since the Crimean war, he
remarked that this had been "perfectly
justifiable," and added: "The time
has arrived when Great Britain may
be confronted by a combination of
powers, and our first duty, therefore,
is to draw all parts of the empire into
close unity, and the next to maintain
the bonds of permanent unity with our
kinsman across the Atlantic." (Loud
cheers.)
"There is a powerful and g-enerous
nation," said Mr. Chamberlain, "using
our language, bred of our race and
having interests identical with ours.
I would go so far as to say that, terri
ble as war may be, even war itself
would be cheaply purchased if in a
great and noble cause the stars and
stripes and the union jack should
wave together over an Anglo-Saxon
alliance. (Prolonged cheers.)
"It is one of the most satisfactory
results of Lord Salisbury's policy that
at the present time these two great na
tions understand each other better
than they ever have done since over a
century ago, when they were seperated
by the blunder of a British Govern
ment."
Mr. Chamberlain proceeded to draw
a gloomy picture of the situation in
China, "where we have to count with
Russia, as in Afghanistan, except that
we do not possess an army or a de
fensive frontier in China, and cannot,
therefore, injure Russia without an
ally. The fate of the whole Chinese
empire Is involved and our interests,
so- enormous that no more vital queÃ
tion was ever presented for decision to
the British nation and a British gov
ernment. Unless the fate of China is
to be decided without England's voice,
we must not reject the idea of an alli
ance with those powers whose inter
ests are similar to ours."

NEW YORK, May 13.â Five lives were

The rooms of the Cross Society
In the Claus Spreckels building are now
scenes of much activity. There is a
constant flitting: about of the ladies
who are in charge of the noble work
and the number of visitors looking for
information are on the increase every
day. The interest in the great work of
the society is gaining a stronger hold
on the business men of this city and j
checks for large amounts are received i
every day. School children have pa
triotically come forward with their
small donations and the amount re
ceived from them aggregates in the
thousands.
When the finances were summed up
last evening it was found that nearly
ten thousand dollars had been donated.
Besides receiving money, donations
have been piling in at a rapid rate
from ail parts of the State. They came
in such \axge quantities that the society
had to establish a wareroom for their
storage at 16 Post street. It is ex
1 that the large room that was
once occupied â¢ the Board of Trade
will not be large enough to hold the
donations, as at the rapid rate they are
piling in one week will suffice to crowd
it.
The executive committee of the so
ciety met yesterday and held a two
hour session behind closed doors. The
only information given out to the press
was that permission had been received
from the chief surgeon to erect a large
hospital tent at th- Presidio. Members
of the Red Cross Society will be in at
tendance and every effort will be made
to look out for the comfort of the brave
boys who will shortly leave for the
scene of hostilities. Another reason for
erecting the tent is to show the outside
world that the society is one of action'
and not words. It was also decided to
direct the purchasing committee to buy
Btoves and other comforts for the
soldiers who are stationed in the old
woollen mills at the foot of Van Ness
avenue. This was done yesterday.
Among the schools to send in their
contributions are the. following:

Major White, the regular army sur
geon at the Presidio, who was ap
pointed sur-et general of the expedi
tion that will soon start for Manila,
was busily engaged yesterday in ex
amining candidates for the hospital
corps. He found in the ranks men who
had graduated from medical colleges,
or who had practical experience as
druggists and also well drilled ii. sa.ni
tary work as members of the National
Guard organizations.
The major said that he had just re
ceived hia r.ppolntment from Washing
ton and was unable to as yet say what
he would do In accepting assistance
from the Red Cross Society. He ad
vised that the Red Cross people do not
expend any money until he could con
fer with them as there was a danger of
duplicating things that the War De
partment had already ordered.

Any matter which touches the public schools Is of greneral interest and
concern- No scheme which tended In any measure to cripple them would
be regarded with patience. The teachers themselves constitute a lar^e
and necessarily intelligent class whose desires are worthy of considera
tion. In the discussion of the proposed charter it Is therefore necessary and
proper to give full weight to the effect its adoption would have upon the
schools; whether It would tend to cripple them or add to their power and
usefulness.
The table presented below is complied by Cyril Williams, an expert,
whose familiarity with the subject will give to his figures a peculiar force.
It demonstrates that the provisions of the new charter will place a burden
upon the teachers, curtail the amount of money available for their ser
vices, and cause either a reduction in the number of teachers
or a reduction in the pay they now receive, which has not heretofore been
deemed too great. The table will bear careful study. It tells Its own story:
SCHOOL, FUND.
Appropriation for the fiscal year 1897-98, for maintaining public 5ch0015.. 51,200,000 00
Out of this appropriation was paid "back salaries of the previous fiscal
year amounting to 120,000 00
Leaving for current expenses a balance of $1,080,000 00
This appropriation was derived from the following sources:
From taxation $ 518,200 00
From the State and other sources 681,800 00
Total $1,200,000 00
The new charter, article VII, chapter 5, section 2, provides:
"Shall levy for the Common School fund a tax which, added to the
revenue derived from other sources, shall produce an amount of money
which shall not exceed thirty-two dollars and fifty cents for each pupil in
attendance during the preceding fiscal year."
The average daily attendance during the year ending June 30, 1597,
was 33,631 at $32 50 per pupil $1,089,767 00
(See Municipal Reports 1596-97. page 1152.)
The appropriation for current expenses for fiscal year 1897-98, as
shown above, was : $1,080,000 00
SCHOOL FUND SALARIES.
The new charter, article VII, chapter 3, section 9, reads:
"To provide for the prompt payment on not later than the fifth day
of every month of all salaries due and allowed officers, teachers and
other employes of the School Department. For this purpose the Auditor
shall annually segregate so much of the Common School fund as shall
not exceed twenty-eight dollars for each pupil in average daily attend
ance in the Public Schools of the city and county during the preceding
fiscal year."
The average daily attandance during the year ending June 30, 1897,
was 33.531 at $2S per pupil $ 938,868 00
The full amount allowed for all salaries at present, the superin
tendent, superintendent's deputy, superintendent's secretary, are not
paid out of the school fund, but out of the general fund, on an additional
appropriation; therefore deduct ihe salaries of the corresponding and
additional officers under the new charter, to-wit:
Four directors at $3.< Xx) $12,000
One superintendent at. 4,000 4.000
Four deputies at 2.4'J0 9.600
One secretary at 1,800 1,800
Total 27,400 00
Which leaves a balance of $ 911,468 00
This brings the amount to the basis on which salaries are now paid
out of the school fund.
For the month of April, 1597, the salaries paid were as follows:
Teachers, etc $58,976 00
Shop employes 602 50
Office employes 832 50
Total $90,410 00
â¢For twelve months these salaries would amount to $1,084,920 00
This shows that the adoption of the new charter will make an annual
reduction in the salaries of teachers, clerks, etc., of $ 173.452 00
GUARDING THE
CITY OF PEKING
Eighteen Men From the
Monterey on Duty at
the Steamer.
Almost a Riot Among the
Men Who Went North
on the Sintram.
Threa Men Kllied Â«nd One Died of
Natural Causes During thÂ«
Roanoke's Voyage.
The naval authorities are taking no
' chances with anything that will be put
aboard the City of Pektng. The big
steamer came down from Hunters Point
, dry dock Thursday afternoon, and yester
: day, before the work of putting stores on
her was begun, a guard of eighteen men
; was sent to her from the Monterey. Six
! of Uncle Sam's sailors were put in the
; lighters alongside the big liner loaded
with coal, six were placed on the dock
> to keep watch on all who went aboard
and six were stationed in the hold in
specting every bucket of coal as it was
dumped. The men keep an eight-hour
watch and then go back to the Monterey.
They do not like the job and would much
rather be fighting the Spanish than get
ting as dirty as blackamoors with coal
dust instead of with powder smoke.
Whether they like it or not, however,
does not make any difference, as they
will have to keep watch on the Peking
until the vessel is ready to sail.
The Peking will carry as many troops
, as she has accommodations for. No extra
; berths will be provided and the vessel
will get away the early part of the week.
â  The City of Sydney will have extra ac
! commodations put in the 'tween decks
and steerage and the Australia has al
most been fitted out in that manner. The
latter vessel will come down from the
i Union Iron Works to-day and when
docked at the Oceanic dock she will be
; practically ready to take aboard the
troops and supplies. If any precautions
are taken regarding the loading of the
. Australia, City of Sydney, Ohio and Con
emaugb, the guards will be soldiers, as
i these vessels have been chartered by
i the army authorities, while the Peking
is under charter of the Secretary of the
: Navy. The authorities are in hopes of
; getting all five vessels away within the
| next week or ten days.
The sailors on the Monterey are discon
solate. Big brown Jumbo, the ship's
mascot, has deserted. He was given
shore leave a few days ago and failed to
show up when his time had expired. Yes
terday a corporal's guard was searching
the highways and byways of the water
front in search of the runaway. Jumbo
is the dog that saved Â»he life of one of
i the crew a few days ago, and the men in
! consequence feel all the more the loss of
their pet. Anybody who runs across a
big brown dog with a collar bearing th<* j
name of the coast defense steamer, and
who will return him to the coxswain of
the Monterey's launch, will receive the
thanks of the entire ship's crew.
The schooner Hattie 1. Phillips sailed i
for St. Michael yesterday with two par- |
ties of gold hunters aboard. She was i
the remains of the Gloucester Mining !
Company, who came out from the East
on the schooner. They have with them !
the launch Eclipse, and on their arrivnl
at St Michael will turn the vessel over
to the agents of Cassidy & Snow, her
new owners. The other party is the Sun- j
flower Mining Company of Fort Scott. |
Kans and they are taking along with '
them'the launch Sunflower.
CaDttfin Whitelaw and his boat-builders
who went north on the ship Sintram to ;
put together stern-wheel steamers for the
Yukon trade are having a merry time \
of It at Captains Bay. According to the
Â«tory that came down on the steamer
Portland yesterday, the cooks are on ;
strike the boat-builders and engineers '
nrft almost in a state of mutiny and there j
was some talk about lynching Captain ;
Whitelaw unless a decided improvement
was made in the food supply and the
Â«ieenin* accommodations. "At Unalaska
four stern-wheelers were being put to
srpther for the Alaska Commercial Com
nany and at Dutch Harbor five more were
nearly finished for the North American
Trading and Transportation Company,"
said an officer of the Port and yesterday.
"In those camps everything was going
along smoothly, but four miles away in i
Captains Bay the men at work on the
Alaska Exploration Company's boats
were not making such good headway. In I

i to the quality and quantity of the foou.

| a result all the men in the kitchen struck,
! and then there was a general all-round
row. Captain Whitelaw did his best to
smooth matters over, but he had a hard
gang to handle and the majority, of them
did just as the >' pleased. When we left
Unalaska. things were coming to a crisis,
and either the men would be pacified and
finish their Job or else there would be
a general break-up in the camp. The men
were making threats against Captain
Whitelaw. and he was liable to receive
a rough handling at any moment"

FEEE DAY AT HOPKINS.
Bain and Murky Weather Keep the
Picture Lovers Away.
Yesterday was free day at the Hopkins
Art Institute. Contrary to custom and
on account of the portrait exhibit, the
second Friday of the month instead of the
first, was given over to the general pub
lic. But few, however, took advantage
of the privilege, the soft May rain and
general murky weather contributing, no
doubt, to keep the picture-loving publio
away.
The Htriking posters of the portrait ex
hibit, which are still In place, were great
ly admired, though much regret was ex
pressed that the general public were not
privileged to enjoy the elegant collection
of portraits and rare old china of last
week.

TO REMEDY A
GREAT ABUSE
Mr. Loud's Course Ap
proved by Secretary
Richardson.
Congress Should Investigate
the Cause of the Large An
nual Deficiency.
Advertising Periodical* Take Ad
vantage of the Second Class
Privileges.
The postal authorities of this city do
not take kindly to the proposition recent
ly made In "Washington that the number
of dally mall deliveries in the large busi
ness centers of the United States should
be cut down in order to reduce the alarm
ing deficiency in the Postoffice Depart
ment, which has existed for many years.
There are five mall deliveries per day
In San Francisco in the business districts,
and should this number be cut down to
four much hardship and inconvenience
will be inflicted upon the business com
munity. Daniel S. Richardson, secretary
for the postoffice In this city, said yes
terday that San Francisco merchants
had become so much accustomed to the
five daily deliveries that the lopping off
of even one of them would cause them
much inconvenience and would injurious
ly affect the business interests of the en
tire community.
The postal deficiency, he said, was large
ly due to the abuse of the second class
mail privilege. The mails are clogged, he
said, with serial novels and other trashy
publications. The class of literature
which gets the benefit of the second class
privilege is the lower order of literature
anu in no case the higher. Among- the
mass are a large number of papers
claiming second class rates that are pri
marily designed for advertising and free
olrcuiation in hotels and on railway
trains, and a class of publications repre
senting certain trades and industries. For j
instance, a grocery firm will issue a cat- ]
alogue of prices and add something to it j
to make it Just come within the require
ments of second class matter, thus oblig
ing the Government to distribute its ad
vertising. If these catalogues were
obliged to pay third class rates the firm
would pay eight cents a pound instead of
one cent a pound, which is the second
class rate.
"In addition to the abuses of the sec
ond-class privilege my impression is,"
continued Mr. Kichardson, "that the !
rates paid by the Government are !
too high for the transportation of i
mail matter in proportion to the rates of !
freight charged by transportation com- !
panles for other freight and requiring â¢
similar care. If the second-class privi- j
lege were restrictpd to legitimate newspa- j
I pers and periodicals the deficiency would ;
be speedily wiped out. The privilege
should be restricted and the rates puid
for transportation shouid be reduced."
Mr. Richardson showed some interest- j
ing statistics bearing on the matter. Dur- i
Ing 1896 there was a revenue to the Gov- I
ernment of $60,624,464 on 65,337,343 pounds i
of first-class matter. The revenue dur- \
ing the same year on 348,988,G4S pounds of I
second-class matter was $2,966,403. ,
The revenue on 7&.701.14S pounds of |
third-class matter was $10,324,0fi9, and
the revenue from 19,950,187 pounds of
fourth-class matter or merchandise was !
$3,129,321. From the years ISB7 to 1896, in
clusive, the total cost of transportation !
of second-class matter amounting to 2,097,- ;
640.300 pounds was $167.511.224, while the re- !
celpts to the Government to pay for the ;
same were only $20,y76,403. leaving a de- |
flclency of $146,834,821. It should be bornÂ© |
in nrtnd that this deficiency is for the i
transportation of second-class matter
only.
Mr. Richardson called attention to an
other important factor in the case, and
that was the fact that the Government
was getting all the long-haul matter and
the express companies are getting the !
advantage of all the concentrations of
weight and short-haul matter. Within
a radius of 500 miles the express com- j
panics are carrying second-class matter
for a fraction under a cent per pound.
Mr. Richardson added that the business
community were under a d<Â»bt of grati
tude to The Call for the stand it has ta
ken m this matter of reforming the abuse
which 1b responsible for the great defi
ciency. The editorial In yesterday morn- j
Ing's Issue of The Call was timely and to \
the point. A congressional investigation
should be had by all means.
The Stanford Estate.
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford,, oxocutrlx of the
will of her husband, the late Senator Le
land Stanford, filed a petition In the Pro
bate Court yesterday asking- that 12,363
shares of the capital stock of the Market
Street Railway Company, held by her
husband at the time of his death, be de
livered to her.

â¢NERVOUS DEPRESSION.
[A TALK WITH MRS. PINKHAM.]
A woman with the blues is a very un-
comfortable person. She is illogical,
I unhappy and frequently hysterical.
The condition of the mind known as
" the bines," nearly always, with wo-
men, results from diseased organs of
generation.
It is a source of wonder that in this
: age of advanced medical science, any
! person should still believe that mere
force of will and determination will
overcome depressed spirits and nerv-
ousness in women. These troubles are
i indications of disease.
Every woman who doesn't trader-
i stand her condition should write to
j Lynn, Mass., to Mrs. Pinkham for her
â  advice. Her advice is thorough com-
mon , sense, and is the counsel of a
learned woman of great experience'
Bead the story of Mrs. F. S. Bennett,
Westphalia, Kansas, as told in the fol-
lowing letter: â¢
" Deak Mrs. Pinkham: â I have suf-
fered for over two years with falling,
I enlargement and uleeration 'of the ;
womb, and this spring, being in such I
a weakened condition, caused me to |
flow for nearly six months. Some time '
ago, urged by friends, I wrote to you ''
for advice. After using the treatment
which you advised for a short time,
that terrible flow stopped.
"I am now gaining strength ; and '
flesh, , and have better health than I
have had for â  the past ten years. I
wish to say to all distressed, ' suffer- !
ing women, do not suffer longer, when
there is one so kind and willing, to ' :
aid you." : .

TriE FORTUNE OF WAR.
WHILE the voices of the people were still
sounding with glad acclamations over the
gallant feat of the Winslow on Monday in at
tacking single-handed three Spanish gunboats and
driving them to seek shelter under the guns of the
forts of Cardenas Bay, came the news of yesterday
announcing another daring feat of the same boat.
another victory for our flag, but gained at a fearful
cost to the vessel and her crew. The Winslow, badly
wrecked, lies in port awaiting repairs, and the greater
number of the brave men who so courageously won
fame for her are dead or wounded.
The service on which the Winslow was sent that
led to her destruction was of so venturesome a na
ture that at first reading it will seem to the country
that some one must have blundered. A careful study
of the situation, however, shows that such was not
the case. In sea fights as well as in land fights peril
is not to be avoided. There are times when a few
men must perform deeds of seeming recklessness in
order that some great benefit or advantage may be
gained for the army or the fleet which they serve.
Such an emergency occurred in the contest at Carr
denas Bay.
It is clearly wise on the part of our commanders to
destroy as many as possible of the Spanish war ves
sels now in West Indian waters before the main fleet
of Spain can unite with them. Several of these .Span
ish gunboats were in the bay at Cardenas. They con
stituted to our blockade and our operations in those
waters a menace which it was necessary to remove.
It was known that the principal entrances to the bay
were mined and that for our ships to steam boldly
in would be to invite the destruction of the entire
squadron. Another entrance had to be sought out,
and as a tnatter of course the vessel that led the way
had to be of comparatively small draught lest she
should strand upon the shoals.
The little Winslow was chosen to lead the way.
She found a passage deep enough for the tug Wilson
and the gunboat Hamilton, but the larger ships of
the squadron could not follow. The three boats held
on their course, found the Spanish boats at anchor
under the guns of the land batteries and at once at
tacked them. The feat was on a lesser scale but not
less daring than that of Dewey at Manila. The men
of the Winslow died not recklessly, but gloriously.
The occasion is one over which patriotism may exult
for the valor shown as well as mourn for the heroic
dead.
This is the fortune of war. The American seaman
drawing his inspiration from a long line of heroes
from the days of Paul Jones to those of Farragut,
and roused to emulation by the marvelous victory
achieved at Manila, cannot turn his back on any foe
however strong he may appear when the path of duty
leads straight forward. It is inevitable that at times
disasters befall the brave. Were it otherwise it
would not require bravery tc face the chances of war.
This first blow given to our arms in the struggle with
Spain warns us that it is not a holiday task our sol
diers and seamen have entered upon, but it will also
remind us that no duty it imposes will be too perilous
for our heroes to meet and overcome.
Somebody was certainly at fault when the volun
teers from Oregon were not met at the station and
given military escort. They were a gallant looking
lot; they have become soldiers for love of country,
and though they come from beyond the State line
they are all our boys just the same. There are more
of them to come, and the rest should not be slighted.
A correspondent sends to a New York paper the
story of the Srui Juan battle in which he speaks of the
women fleeing in yellow fear. Had he been showing
the unfortunate ladies a copy of the paper for which
lie writes details of things which never have hap
pened?
The man who sues for divorce alleging that his
wife took but one bath in five months should remem
ber that the water company has earnestly requested
citizens to be as sparing as possible of water.
Certain of the powers are said still to be deter
mined that the United States shall not hold the Phil
ippines. Spain can be counted among the number.
It cannot be denied that the volunteers sent up a
sigh of relief when they learned that it was another
Otis.
The Spanish fleet now in search of Sampson will be
sorry when it shall find him, .
THE FUN OF FUSION.
1-"HE first real political fusion of the year has been
effected at Fresno. In that county the Demo
crats, Silver Republicans and Populists have
struck palms and agreed to make a joint fight on a
common platform. The first knowledge gained by
the outside world of this Fresno compact is in the re
port made to the Populist State Committee by Mr.
Dore, who seems to have been its principal nego
tiator.
In the first place the Democrats agree not to have any
Democratic platform. This is an abstention that must
cost many a pang, for if there is any privilege dear to
the Democratic heart it is that of passing resolutions
and making State, county, township and precinct plat
forms. The Democrats agree to eat their tag, which
is a genuine hardship. The Silver Republicans never
had any platform or principles except a declaration
that the tail is bigger than the dog and should wag
him whenever it is fed. These two members of the
political happy family of Fresno agree to fuse with the
Populists on the Oregon platform, and, having no
other, to cleave unto that until death does them part.
Now the Oregon platform is the Populist platform.
The Democrats of Oregon fused with -the Populists
once and lost their identity. The Populists went to
the front, and in the so-called fusion now in operation
in that State they said to the few and scattering bands
of Democrats who had strayed so far fr&m their own
reservation that they couldn't find the way back that
they could take a seat inside the Populist lion by sub
scribing to the regular platform. As they had no re
course, they accepted the conditions. On this plat
form the Fresno fusion is made. It is the full Popu
list programme. It demands "a national money, safe
and sound, issued by the General Government only,
without the intervention of banks of issue, to be a full
legal tender for all debts, public and private; also a
just, equitable and efficient means of distribution di-
rect to the people through the lawful disbursements of
the Government, and that the volume of circulating
medium be speedily increased to an amount suffi
cient to meet the demands of business and population
of this country, and to restore the just level of prices;
and such legislation as will prevent, in the future, de
monetization of any kind of legal tender money by
private contract." The platform also demands the
initiative and referendum and the submission of "all
important national questions for an advisory vote of
the people." ,
The Populists were not content with the adminis
tration of this dose to the Fresno Democrats. Mr.
Dore reported to the State Committee that after the
Democrats and Silver Republicans had agreed to the
platform "a fair division of the offices was arrived at,
the Populists, however, stipulating for control of the
Board of Supervisors and of the offices governing
the levying of taxes and the expenditure of public
moneys."
The humor of this is exquisite. The Democrats
seem not to have seen it. Though they took their
platform medicine the Populists deemed it wise not
to trust them with money, and so stipulated for
control of the purse. But, after all, this is wise poli
tics. If the Populists hang on to the bait-can, the
other parties to this funny compact must wig when
they wag.
THE DISMISSED GRAND JURY.
THE Grand Jury dismissed by Judge Belcher
yesterday for incompetency is not likely to get
much sympathy from the public. The distress
of its members is of an eminently lachrymose char
acter. If a few of the desperate resolves with which
they are now acquainting the public had been exe
cuted while the jury were investigating the ferry
depot scandal, the School Department thefts and the
street paving frauds the disgraceful ending which has
overtaken them might have been prevented. Several
of the jurors say they were on the point of doing
something. It is a significant fact, however, that they
never were on this point until Judge Belcher an
nounced his intention of dismissing them.
It is childish for the jurors to charge District At
torney Barnes and his assistants with responsibility
for their failure to do their duty. Had they been de
termined, for instance, to indict the thieving contract
ors who robbed the State in constructing the ferry
depot â proof of whose criminality was presented in
abundance â neither the District Attorney nor his as
sistants could have averted the result. Had they been
intent on bringing the School Department rascals to
justice no power on earth could have stopped them.
Moreover, nobody would have attempted to stop them.
The bravest District Attorney or Superior Judge who
ever served the tax eaters would not have dared to
stand between an honest Grand Jury and the political
thieves of the Harbor Commission and School De
partment.
The people of this city will not be apt to credit what
is now being said concerning the desperate inten
tions of the jurors. Josh Biilings said he never
wagered a cent on a man who told what he would
have done had he been there. Nor will the public lay
any money on Grand Jurors who tell what they would
have done had Judge Belcher let them alone a while
longer. The fact of the matter is the dismissed Grand
Jury, although in session for six months, did nothing.
If its inactivity had been due to a lack of material to
work on, there would have been no occasion to de
mand its dismissal. But political thieves have been
unusually abundant for a long time. A finer oppor
tunity for the display of civic virtue was never pre
sented to a Grand Jury than has been presented to
this one. Yet its members completely failed to do
their duty.
What the disgraced jurors should do is to retire
from public view quietly. Anything they may now
say can only vex the public ear. They had a chance
to purify the political atmosphere and they neglected
it. What they might have done, what they were
going to do, why they did not do it, and who was to
blame for the internecine difficulties, are no longer of
public interest. The historical fact is, they quarreled
when they should have attended to business. The
"pull" of the predatory politicians was too much for
them. It is well that they are dead and buried.
THE SACRAMENTO WATER SUPPLY.
STEPS taken by the citizens of Sacramento and
by the State officials to procure a purer water
supply for Sacramento are a striking illustration
of- the benefits accruing to a community from a
prompt publication of existing evils and an insistent
urging of the adoption of an immediate remedy.
When The Call first exposed the dangerous condi
tion of the water supply at Sacramento the exposure
was met by the charge that it was an attempt to in
jure the city. Certain of our contemporaries started
the charge and tried hard to raise it to the degree of
a prolonged howl. It takes more than two coyotes,
however, to make noise enough to distract attention
from the clear voice of The Call, and the people of
Sacramento were not for a moment deceived. They
knew that the articles on the water supply were true,
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 14, 1898.
and that the object of The Call in publishing them
was not to injure Sacramento, but to save her peo
ple from danger of disease.
The first result of the publication was the awaken
ing of popular interest in the subject. This led to
discussion, and discussion brought about investiga
tion. All the statements made by The Call were
found to be true. The next step was to devise a
remedy. Men of intelligence and energy took up the
work, and as soon as Jhey began to move it was found
they would have ample co-operation from the State
officials in checking the evil so far as it is due to the
contamination of the water by the sewage from Fol-
som prison-
It was gratifying to note by the reports from Sac
ramento yesterday that the movement for a better
water supply has now so far progressed that a victory
for Sacramento is virtually assured. It is regarded as
certain that the Prison Directors at their next meet
ing will provide some way by which the sewage of
Folsom can be cared for without draining it into
American River. This will be a gain not for Sacra
mento only, but for all the region along the rivers be
low the prison, and may serve as a means for pro
moting sewage improvement in many other locali
ties.
Sacramento is to be congratulated upon the energy
of her Chamber of Commerce and her citizens gener
ally in dealing with the issue. The importance of the
work to be undertaken cannot be overrated. An im
pure water supply is a menace to every household in
the city. It is one of the most fruitful causes of dis
ease among men, and if the present impure supply
were continued there is no telling what a fearful cost
it might have entailed upon the people of Sacra
mento in the coming summer. Fortunately the evil
is to be no longer ignored. The remedy has been
devised and agreed upon. Sacramento will soon be
as healthful as nature made that locality before man
contaminated the pure waters of the rivers.
COUNSEL TO THE ERRING.
THERE is no longer need for considering the
Examiner seriously. From a newspaper it has
degenerated into a serial freak, to whose opinion
not the slightest importance attaches and whose
"news" no reader regards as indicative of anything
that has happened or is likely to happen. But a
freak becomes tiresome; the side-show and the voice
of the spieler pall. Would it not be well for the Ex
aminer when it has published as truth statements
having not the coloring of fact to refrain from
boasting? The public is ready to assume that the
verbose liars who represent yellow journalism
abroad will keep up their regular lick, especially as
the present affords no end of opportunity.
Recently a man named Creelman â as a correspond
ent utterly unreliable â sent word that he had broken
through the Spanish censorship and began to forward
"interviews" which all knew to be fictitious. Then
he announced that the fleet which Sampson had ex
pected to meet had returned to Cadiz. He let the
public know that he had given the United States the
benefit of this knowledge, and that Uncle Sam was
duly grateful. The location of the fleet was named
definitely, not as a rumor, a possibility, but as a matter
settled and certain. Yet it was an absolute lie, wrong
in itself and doubly wrong that some official might
have credited it and been led to disastrous course.
Happily the lie was discovered in time to destroyany
power for ill. But when news came to all the papers
showing the real character of the Creelman fake the
Examiner printed such of it as limited facilities per
mitted it to obtain, and at the same time bragged of
the achievement the real news stamped as a stupid
and malign fabrication. Such is the manner of it.
Its errors are not of ignorance wholly. The same
ambition which surges in the breast of a gold-brick
sharp every time he spies a greenhorn stirs the great
heart of the Examiner when a nickel is in sight. There
is no need to waste sympathy on the owner of the
nickel who permits it thus to be wooed away. There
is no use to advise the sheet to reform, but if it were
to cease by displays of red fire and blare of horn to
call attention to its own frailties it would abate a
nuisance and confer a considerable boon.
A GUN ASSEMBLING PLANT.
A PETITION has been addressed to the Senators
and Representatives of California in Congress
requesting them to use their best efforts to
bring about the establishment of a gun-assembling
plant for the Pacific Coast at Benicia. The petition
has been signed not only by leading citizens of
Benicia, but by such representative organizations as
the State Board of Trade, the Chamber of Commerce,
the Merchants' Association and the Manufacturers'
Association. It is therefore one that will compel at
tention by reason of the influential men who support
it, and our delegation in Congress can be safely
counted on to do what they can to obtain a favor
able consideration of it by the Government.
The petition, however, has a strength of its own
over and above that given it by the eminence of the
men and organizations who have signed it. The rea
sons why a gun-assembling plant should be estab
lished on this coast are many and all are strong. The
Pacific Coast frontage of the republic has ceased to
be the back door ol the nation. The whole trend of
events of recent years is toward the extension of
wealth, commerce and industry along these shores.
It is reasonably certain that within a comparatively
short time the principal energies of the nations will
be exerted on the Pacific. Our country must prepare
a strong front here where it will have to meet the ex
panding commerce and naval and military energies
of Russia, Germany, Great Britain and Japan. This
coast, equally with that of the Atlantic, will have to
be defended, and for defensive purposes there will be
required every form of plant known to modern war.
When it comes to the selection of a site for the lo
cation of a gun-assembling plant the claims of
Benicia cannot be overlooked. That point is ideally
situated for 6uch an establishment It holds a cen
tral position along the coast, is so landlocked as to
be safe from the attack of an enemy, and at the same
time is so directly connected with the ocean as to
make it a place where either the navy or coast defense
troops can promptly resort for guns when needed.
Further arguments for the establishment of the pro
posed plant at Benicia are to be found in the fact that
the Government has already there a suitable site for
the purpose. The reservation at Benicia includes 350
acres bordering on the waters of Carquinez Straits
at a point where the waters are' of sufficient depth at
low tide to afford ample facilities for the docking or
anchorage of the largest war vessels. On this site the
Government has now extensive barracks and shops.
It is within five miles of the navy yard at Mare
Island and possesses every advantage which could be
desired.
The petition should be strongly pushed. It is one
on which all Californians can unite. We need a gun
assembling plant on this coast, and Benicia is the
place for it. Moreover, it should be established at
once. The Government should act without delay.

over the Spanish fleet, to evince his pa

Dewey, in honor of the illustrious de

Yesterday afternoon Mr. Dunham had
occasion to go to the Occidental Hotel on
business, when he was agreeably sur
prised to meet an old friend who had just
arrived from the East. After mutual
greetings, he was on the point of inform
ing him of the new addition to his family
when the other commenced to speak in
glowing terms of the splendid American
victory in the Philippines, Admiral Dewey
especially coming in for a large share of
his admiration. Both gentlemen being of
an equally patriotic nature, the conversa
tion naturally became very animated, and
it was some time before Mr. Dunham was
able to venture the remark, "Well, we've
got a new boy up at our house." Con
gratulations were immediately extended.
"Yes," continued the proud father, at the
thought of the pleasant event, "Dewey

to his friend the name of the lad and his
own patriotic action in naming the baby.
The other individual, whose thoughts had

ministered to the Spaniards, replied: "You
are right, my boy, dead right, even if you
are a little ungrammatical. You know, it

NAMING THE BICYCLE.
Both the velocipede and bicycle have
given the French a lot of trouble to sat
isfactorily christen either machine. Be
ginning with the celerifere and veloslfere,
there has been a progressive movement
in the direction of "bicycle," "bicyclette."
"veloce" and "velo." The popular vehicle
1b also known under the name of "be
cane." In Spain It Is the veloclfers, ve
lodpedo and biclcletta. In England It Is
"wheel"; In Germany, "fahrrad or "rod."
In China It is "gaugma," meaning "for
eign horse," or "fei chal." "flying vm
chine." In the same country it is also
called "tzu tzun," or "carriage-that-goes
without-horse." With respect to names,
however, the Flemings distance all the
rest. Beginning by calling the bicycle
the "enelwiel" or "voetwiel," they have
developed the name into the mon
strous "gewielsnelrijuoetrappeudneusdre
kergestel. Those contemplating a bicy
cle tour in Europe had better skip Flan
ders or else ride around the country.

THE JEWS AS PATRIOTS.
Three thousand Jewish residents of Chi
cago on Saturday last gathered together
and took part in one of the most unique
demonstrations of patriotism In the
States since the war with Spain began.
In the Hebrew language, and according
to the forms of Moses, prayers were of
fered in the Jewish Tabernacle for the
protection and guidance of President Mc-
Kinley, for the success of our arms in
the warfare with Spain, and for the con
tinued welfare and prosperity of tho
United States Government. The exercises
were conducted by Rev. Israel Kupfer,
rabbi of the congregation, but the prin
cipal address was by William Zoloktkoff.
He declared that it was a peculiar and
providential happening that in a land of
liberty the Jews assembled- as respected
citizens of a great nation to pray for the
success of the arms of a nation that had
persecuted their ancestors.
"The persecution of the Jew," he said, '
"was the beginning of the decline of
Spain. To-day Spain ia tottering to ex
tinction, while the people she sought to
destroy are hopeful and strong. The Jew
who enjoys the freedom of this country
is willing to give his life to extend that
freedom to the possessions of Spain in !
this hemisphere, and he will rejoice in i
the downfall of the nation that once
drove his people from her shores."
Such demonstration as this will go far
toward setting at naught the absurd
assertion so often heard that "the Jews
are a nation without a country." It is |
very hard for some people to understand i
that Judaism in this day is a religion,
nothing more, nothing less. The Jews
are not a separate nation. The Jews of
America are as essentially American
citizens and are quite as patriotic and
devoted to the interests of the country as
the adherents of any other religion. â

INVENTIONS BY NAVAL OFFICERS.
Under the prevailing custom. in regard
to the use by the Government of inven
tions by naval officers, the Secretary of
the Navy has hitherto allowed compen
sation In such cases, the amount being
fixed pursuant to recommendations of ex
pert naval officials. The clause of the
naval apropriation bill which the House
has refused to accept provided that naval |
officers holding patents on any discovery
or Invention used by the Government
might go into the Court of Claims and sue :
for compensation. The orderly and gen- i
erally satisfactory adjustment of such i
claims by the chief of the Navy Depart- '
ment would thus give place to a series of
artinns in court, with the Government
practically in the position of defendant ;
and one of its employes, nurtured and
educated at the public expense, as plain- !
tiff.
It is clear that the greater proportion of
inventions and discoveries useful in naval
practice must be the output of men spe
cially trained and adapted for naval duty.
Being thoroughly familiar with the con- i
ditions of the problems presented they j
have been enabled frequently to work out !
satisfactory solutions where the most I
learned of landlubbers would have groped â 
vainly in the dark.
In regard to the right of compensation >
for inventions by naval officers of de- )
vices and improvements advantageous to !
the service the rule of the department hai> I
always seen that when officers have
beÂ«*n specially assigned to experimental
duty, with special facilities afforded to
them by ; he department, the product of |
their investigations and experiments is
the property of the Government.
But if an invention for the naval ser
vice be devised by an officer as a result
of independent effort and personal enter
prise, he is entitled to fuli ownership of
the fruits of his labors, secured to nim j
by letters patent. The Government must
pay royalty for the use of such an inven
tion, although in all probability the only
customer for it. ,
If naval officers are to be paid for im
provements in naval construction, arma
ment and equipment, due provision might j
be easily made for such payment with- i
out resorting to the courts or to the
duress of a rider upon an appropriation I
bill.â Philadelphia Record.
BOMBARDMENT RULES.
Under the rules of war which have been
approved by all civilized nations, there
are certain things which a belligerent
cannot do without laying .himself liable
to the charge of barbarism.
There are certain rules which must be j
followed in the bombardment of cities.
According to Theodore S. Wolsey, a rec- j
ognized authority on international law, i
great consideration for persons and prop- j
erty must be displayed in a bombard
ment. All pillage is unlawful, however
protonged the resistance; unnecessary
destruction of property Is forbidden: >
quarter must be given, and killing must
be stopped as soon as resistance ceases.
Churches, hospitals, establishments de- i
voted to charity, the arts or to scientific ,
use should be marked by flags and spared
as much as practicable. Notice that a
bombardment is intended Is usually given, j
that non-combatants may be sheltered !
from its effects. Moreover, it is only â¢
fortified places that can be shelled. For
a hostile fleet to bombard a city that was
undefended would be an atrocious viola
tion of the laws of war.
While Spain would not hesitate to resort"
to atrocities, it Is not likely that she i
would violate the rules of war in such a i
way as to make herself an outlaw among
nations. For that reason, even if our i
fleet should not Intercept the Spanish j
men-of-war that are believed to bo headed
this way, there is little danger of the
bombardment of any unprotected city on
our coast.â From the Cleveland Leader.
AMERICAN ECONOMY OF TIME.
When visiting the United States, Have
lock Wilson was particularly Impressed
with the labor-saving machinea in opera
tion in tho different factories as well as
with the order and method with which
the works are conducted. In making a
tour around one factory in Ohio, he was
surprised to find above each machine a
huge placard, with the words, "Tho Hon.
J. Havelock Wilson, M. P.. from Eng
land." Asked why this notice was neces
sary, the manager said, "Oh. it is purely
a business arrangement. By placing this
notice in the works each man knows who
is the visitor being- conducted around, and
does not need to ask his mates. Time is
thus saved." Mr. Wilson also observed
that the men were allowed to sit at their
work. The manager said that was also
a business matter. "We find that the men
can do 15 per cent more work seated than
standing."

ter will accompany the expedition to the
Philippine Islands, where his services will
be of paramount worth in the building of
fortifications, work with which he is thor
oughly familiar, having had considerable
practical experience in the building of the
fortifications at Fort Point, in San Fran
cisco harbor, where he was stationed for
some time. Lieutenant Potter arrived
yesterday.
Pursuant to telegraphic instructions
from the War Department, General Mer
rlam has detailed Captain Harry C. Ben
son, Fourth United States Cavalry, and
Second Lieutenant Charles R. Krauthoff,

est of the service to procure the number !
and kind of animals desired, and upon
completion of this duty return to their
respective stations.
It is said that about 400 horses and the
same number of mules will be purchased
at once. The price fixed for artillery
horses is $135 and tor cavalry horses $125

Captain Long will at the earliest day

officers has been shown by the men even
under the disagreeable circumstances that
they must be commended for their forti

when they march â  away, ; and is authorized to
take all necessary steps for that purpose.
I trust you will give this communication the
prominence which it deserves, and that it will
meet with the response that It should, for the
boys are of U3 and they go forth to protect
the honor of our country and its flag, and
are deserving of and will receive all the en

TROOPS ARRIVE
FROM THE NORTH
Battalion of Oregon Vol
unteers Camp at the
Presidio.
The first assembly call for drill was
just sounding in the camp at the Pre
sidio yesterday morning as the First B;it
talion of the Second Regiment of Ore
gon volunteers came marching into the
Government reservation. Despite their
long trip from Portland the four com
paniesâA, B, C and Dâ presented a most
striking and soldierly appearance. Lieu
tenant-Colonel George O. Yoran was in
command of the battalion, which wasr
marched to the western end of the cav
alry parade, where they wont into camp
just beyond the Fourteenth United States
Infantry. The men are line looking sol
diers, and are a magnificent body of physi
cal manhood. Tall, strong and brawny,
with a determined look upon their coun
tenances, they will no doubt give a good
account of themselves when they arrive
at Manila.
Major C. IT. Gantenboin reported a
pleasant trip, with no accidents or sick
ness. The battalion left Portland on
Monday night and came on a .special train
over the Southern Pacific. The other
eight companies composing the regiment
will leave Portland on Monday under the
command of Colonel Summers. T^iey
will arrive here next Wednesday morn
ing, and the two battalions will go into
camp beside their fellow soldiers, thus
completing the regiment.
The four companies are officered as
follows:
Company Aâ Captain. Herbert 1... Heath,
McMinnville; first lieutenant, Ralph Platt,
Portland; second lieutenant, J. A. Young, Mc-
Minnville.
Company B â Captain, John L,. May, Ashland;
first lieutenant. Frank B. Hamlin, Roseburjf;
second lieutenant, James K. Thornton, Ash-
land.
Company Câ Captain, W. S. Moon, Eugene;
flrvt lieutenant, Robert 1,,. Huston, Kujrene;
second lieutenant, Fred W. Halnes, Roseburf.
Company I>â Captain, Austin F. .prencott. 1*&
Grande; first lieutenant, George A. Hartmun
Jr., Pendleton; second lieutenant, Frank A.
Meade, La Grande.
Company A is composed of men from
Portland and MoMinnvllle, Company B
is made up of volunteers from Roseburg
and Ashland, Company C comes from
Eugene and Company D halls from La
Grande and Pendleton.
The old Springfield rifles -with which
the men have been equipped for drilling
purposes will be exchanged for the new
Krag-Jorgensen guns.
Assistant Surgeon H. W. Cardwell and
a detail of six men of the hospital corps
accompany the battalion.
The regiment is under command of Col
onel O Summers, who will arrive next
week. He served throughout the war of
the rebellion and has been prominently
identified with the Oregon National Guard
ever since its organization. Colonel Sum
mers, who is a successful crockery mer
chant, was recently appointed appraiser
of customs for the port of Portland.
The physical examination of the Ore
gon volunteers has been very strict. That
Borne of the rejected ones were accepted
in the regular army at Fort Vancouver
is Indeed a compliment to the physical
standing of the volunteers.
This regiment has been named the, Sec
ond Volunteers of Oregon in order not to
confuse the records wit.i those of the
First Regiment of Oregon Volunteers.
which served in the war of the rebellion.
The Oregon emergency corps had on last
Wednesday raised about $1000. and it was
decided to give the captain of each com
pany $100. The emergency fund will be
increased from day to day.
Company A is commanded by Captain
H L. Heath, Company B by Captain J.
L May, Company C by "W. 8. Moon, end
Company D by Captain A. P, Prescott.
Lieutenant Ralph Platt is the auarter
master of the regiment, and Lieutenant
F. S. Kelly the adjutant. The hospital
corps 1b under the command of Surgeon-
Captain H. W. Caldwell.
The battalion has its full complement
of men, being 438 strong. There are very
few raw recruits In the regiment.
WANT TO AID
ON THE FIELD
A Quartet of Physicians
Are Accepted From
Oakland.
OAKLAND, May 13.â The spirit of pa
triotism has become so manifest among
a section of the medical fraternity of this
city that there is danger of the wounded
soldiers being better cared for than the
sick of Oakland.
A week ago Dr. WoolÃey had four com
panions in his suite of offices at Twelfth
and Broadway. One-half of them have
already gone into service at the Presidio,
and the other half have had their services
accepted and aro waiting for commissions
from the army authorities.
This morning Dr. Harry Travers and
Dr. Ijiidlow assumed their duties at the
Presidio as members of the surgeon corps
of the First Regiment. Health Officer
Dunn and Dr. O. D. Hamlin also volun
teered their services and will leave for
Manila should any cavalry regiment be
t<< -lit nut.
Health Officer Dunn has been surgeon
major of the Fifth Regiment for two
years and has organized a complete hos
pital corps in this city. One of the most
interested in this work was Dr. Hamlin.
A few days np.o Major Dunn decided that
he could be of greater service to the army
than as Health Officer of this city, and he
expressed his intention of giving up his
private practice and his official position,
each of which is very lucrative, and of
peeking active service in the army. His
offer was accepted and he was informed
that when cavalry were ordered to Ma
nila ho would receive a commission. This
spirit of the major's affected Dr. Ham
lin, who also has a good practice in this
city. Ho made a formal offer of his ser
vices and it was accepted. There is only
a partition between the offices of these
doctors and Drs. Ludlow and Travers,
and the spirit of enthusiasm which start
ed in Pr. Woolsey's office worked along
till yesterday, when Drs. Travers ana
Tjtidlnw went to the Presidio and w^re
agreeably surprised to find that they
could stand the physical examination re
quired fur service.
This morning they bade fareweJl to
their friends and ore now with the First
Regiment at the Presidio.
War Incidents.
Hesperian Parlor No. 137, N. S. G. W..
has resolved to remit all dues, fines and
assessments against any member joining
the army or navy of the United States
to fight In the war with Spain. Rincon
Parlor No. 72 has adopted a similar reso
lution.
Court Golden Gate, of the Foresters of
America, will keep in good standlnp any
of its members who will serve the Gov
ernment and defend the honor of the
country during the war with Spain.
The Ancient Order of United Workmen
in the lodges of this city is showing the
patriotic spirit as well as other organi
zations. Franklin Lodge and Crocker
Lodge have each adopted resolutions to
keep in good standing any of their mem
bers who may volunteer to serve in the
army or navy of the United States dur
ing the war.
The Labor Council.
Beyond the usual lengthy discussions
on the labor questions of the day there
was little business transacted at the meet
ing of the Labor Council last night. The
musicians reported that the Golden Eagle
Clothing House had acceded to their re
quest and in future would employ none
but union musicians. The fight with the
management of the concert hall opened
in the old Bella Union is still on. The
printers reported that meir strike was
progressing .avorably so far as they are
concerned, although the gains arp such as
are not directly noticpuble on the sur
face. A committee consisting of E. L.
Clapp J. Hill and Ed Rosenberg was ap
point* d to act in conjunction with a sim
ilar committee to be appointed from the
Tvpof?raphical Union and the Building
Trades Council to arrange for a oall for
the benefit of the striking printers.
No one will use a fountain pen after
trying a "Koh-I-Noor" copying pencil. * j
Stole Valuable Jewelry.
Last evening a sneak thief entered the
residence of Mrs. Crawford, at 6 Walnut
avenue, and stWe a package containing
several hundred dollars" worth of jewelry.
Mrs Crawford suspects a young man who
visited her house under the pretext that
he wanted to see her son.
Suit Against an Estate.
Mrs. Julie Chapman commenced suit
yesterday against Josephine P. Jaudin,
administratrix of the estate of Arnotte
Schwob. to recover $500 claimed to be due
for services rendered the decedent dur
ing her last illness.

FAST DOGS CAN
CAPTURE
GOLDEN DOLLARS.
At Union and Ingleside coursing parks
to-day the long tails will be sprinting
for purses aggregating no less than $1700.
Ihe stake at Ingleside is for dogs that
have not won third or better during the
past six months. The entry embraces
fifty-two candidates, and among them not
a few whose eligibility to a so-called non
winner contest seems incompatible with
their well-known quality. They are dogs
of class, and out of their class solely
through some of the numerous chances
that make coursing a sport of class. At
Union Park two stakes will be run offâ
an open, all-age feature with sixty-four
contestants, and a puppy event wherein
the youngsters number an even two
dozen. The candidates are for the most
cart of excellent stock. The running at
both parks will begin at 12 o'clock, and
before the finals will have been decided
to-morrow night some top notch sport
will result.
The continued success of Connemara
and Moondyne has occasioned much re
mark of late. It has been conceded that
they are a remarkably valuable brace of
performers and a glance into the pa^t
shows thc-m to be all that is claimed.
Since the first of last July Moondyne has
appeared at Ingleside sixteen times, out
of which he has won four "iirsts," one
"second," three "thirds," and only oiu-e
has failed to land his initial course. Dur
ing the same period Oonnemara has run
fifteen times at Ingleside, scoring six
â¢â¢firsts" and one "second," and failing to
win the initial run twice.
The lield at Ingleside has been further
gone over this week and is in a condi
tion almost perfect. Since the nrst of last
July and exclusive of to-day's stake
there has been disbursed in prizes at In
gleside $20,400. By the first oi" next July
the amount will have passed beyon
There bids fair to be several har

There has been a notable change in th
personnel of the stake winners at Ingle
eide since, the opening of 189$. Of the win
ners of the all-age events between Jul
1 1897 and January 1, IS9S, the only ones
to lift a Ilnal flug since January 1 have
been Connemara, Rosette, Moondyne and
Seminole.
John Stout, the Sacramento coursing
enthusiast, has abandoned the sport, lie
left for Alaska last Wednesday.
J. Dean's trio, Mialmo. Moondyne and
Connemara, are being rested up for a
time. The black wonder will hardly run
again for several weeks, owing to an in
jured left foot, Incurred in the nnal course
last Sunday.
At the close of the rundown at Ing#*;side
to-day a consolation stake will be made
up for such dogs as fail to win their ini
tial course. The distribution of the money
thus brought about by both stakes will
leave scarcely a performer without some
reward. Â_... * .â
Picking winners at Ingleside to-day is
hazardous. Still, there should be a flag
in store for Signal, Fashion Plate, \an

prizes are of racb exceptionally tine qual

well afford to offer congratulations to the

STRIPED BASS CAUGHT
FROM OAKLAND BRIDGE.
The Fish Commissioners' deputies-
Cross and Nelsonâ have been engaged for
days in catching black bass fry
from Russian River.
The little fishes will be placed in some
waters which are considered "just right"
for this variety of game fishes. It is
presumed, however, that the shipments
will be made to such lakes and rivers as
are considered open to the anglers of the
State. It is a well-known fact that fishes
taken from public waters cannot lawfully
be planted in waters that are under pre
serve rule, consequently it is presumed
that the fry of the bass now being ship
ped from Russian River will not find a
home under preserve rule excepting, of
course, during the close season for fish
ing.
Al Wilson, the expert angler, hooked
and landed a fifteen-pound striped bass
while he was prospecting in Russian
River for large fish recently. He reports
that the baas made a gallant fight from
start to finish.
Anglers will be pleased to learn that
during the past week Quite a number of
etriped bass have been caught by fisher
men from the Oakland bridge. Andy,
â¢'the hermit of the White House," land
ed six or seven fish, the largest of which
tipped the scales at six and three-quarter
pounds. He states that ihe most kill
ing of lures is a bunch of wiggling spile
worms, attached to which is a strip from
the bcuy of a smelt or whitefish.
It is cad that the school of young steel
heads which was "camped" In the White
House pool at Point Reyes for several
weeks, has disappeared. Doubtless the
fry thought it was about time to seek
the cool waters of Tomales Bay. Charles
Precht, James Chesley and other expert
flycasters whipped the pool last Sunday
for hours without success.
Trout fishing on the Sacramento River
near Simms is now at its best. Messrs.
Bogard and Emmons caught two nice
baskets ot rainbows last Sunday.
John Gallagher, who is "anchored" at
Baird on the McCloud River, wrote John
Butler last Tuesday that he is enjoying
excellent sport, having landed several
two, three and some five-pound trout
since hie arrival.
Is'othiaj; has been heard from Trucked
this season, but as the water is reported
very low and clear trout fishing should
soon be at its best.
Paladin!, the well-known fish merchant,
and director general of the net fishing
interests of this coast, was arrested again
last Saturday for having striped bass less
than three pounds in weight in his pos
session. Judge Low postponed a hear
ing of the case until next week. But
as the evidence against the fish dealer
is as clear as crystal, it is a -foregone
conclusion that the transgressor of the
law will have to pay dearly for his brav
ery. Still there have been very clear
cases which the Police Court Judges were
unable to see through, even with the aid
of glasses.
James Watt and a friend caught a nice
mess of trout on Lagunitas Lake last
Thursday. Watt tested his new spoon
with remarkable success. He has named
it the Brooks spinner, in honor of the
doctor.

The Field of Sport
THE BENCH SHOW
WILL OPEN
ON WEDNESDAY.
The total number of entries to the San
Francisco Kennel Club's bench show
amounts to the respectable total of 564.
This is only a few under the record-
I breaker of last year, and, considering that
the war with Spain holds the interest of
the people' at straining point, the showing
is one to be proud of. â 
In the mastiffs a young novice will be
shown by C. A. Spreckels, the vice-presi
dent of the Mastiff Club. The secretary
I has secured Major, the winner in 1595, and
believes that he has a mastiff second to
n+> tie in this country. Mrs. J. P. Norman
shows the veteran prize-winner, Lola, but
the latter is in poor condition, and it is
not at all^unlikely that Mr. Geary, the
treasurer of the club, will emerge first
; In the winning class with his promising
young bitch, Juno.
In the Great Danes some fine animals
will be shown that have heretofore been
strangers to the ring. M. E. L. Living
ston's Commodore Dewey is a promising
puppy, and the two Caesars, owned by
Mrs. J. L. Carpenter and Dr. Jelllnck, re
spectively, are both sound young. dogs. Of
' course, the great light will be in the open
class, between the two challenge dogs,
Mrs. Roncovleri's Rex R and J. L. Cun
ningham's Ivan.
In the limit bitches the palm will doubt
less fall to Mrs. B. Bryon's Queen Olga,
who won first novice at San Jose with
plenty to spare.
In rough-coated St. Bernards will be
seen some new specimens of great prom
ise, among them R. 11. Elder's Senator
Bernardo and Mrs. G. C. Oxnard's Grand
Master.
In smooth-coated St. Bernards there is
little competition.
In deerhounds Dr. McNutt's Derby and
Clinton Worden's Highland Chief are of
high quality, and the doctor's Thora 111
will doubtless bear off the palm in the
I limit class.
In the greyhound classes competition
will be keen.
Altogether for quality of the exhibits
the forthcoming show will not have many
superiors in this country, and would
probably be second to the -Westminster
Kennel Club's show In New York and
to that alone. This is an achievement of
which this coast may well boast, and one
to which sportsmen can point with pride
when discussion with the East arises.
The premium list is a marvel, and can
compare in value of prizes offered with
the largest shows ever held in this coun
try and lose nothing by the comparison.
Above all, it reflects credit not only on
the club holding the show but on the
generous civic spirit of the gentlemen who
add such munificent inducements to ex
hibitors with entire disinterestedness.
Such liberal unselfishness one fails to find
in the Eastern shows.
The specialty clubs have not shown up
as well as usual. The Pacific Mastiff Club
looms up conspicuously with its long ar
ray of specials, all of which are calculated
to foster competition.
The Oakland bench show will probably
be postponed until September. It was de
cided at the last meeting of the Oakland
Kennel Club to postpone the show, and
the consensus of opinion among the mem
bers apparently favor the autumn as the
best time for holding it.
The Pacific Mastiff Club will hold Its
annual meeting on the 20th inst. at the
Mechanics' Pavilion. For a club that has
only been in existence for one brief year
this one has had a decidedly stormy ex
istence. But. like the animal it favors,
the Mastiff Club seems to strive on strife
and is much stronger now than when it
started.

WITH THE OARSMEN
AND THE SCULLERS.
Ihe Ariel Rowing Club will hold its re
gatta on the first Sunday in June, but the
programme is not yet quite settled,
though it is certain that there will be
some open events. The Alameda Boat
Club will send over some representatives
and possibly its new barge. Crews are
now going out for practice every night.
The senior crew is in training and goes
out on alternate nights. The "German"
crew is enthusiastic and intends to give
its opponents a hard race. The other ju
nior crews are also getting into good trim.
The Club intends shortly to give an order
for a new racing skiff. At present Frank
Wilson, the senior sculler, is using Phe
lan's skiff, but he finds the sculls light,
and intends to use a longer and heavier
pair. The oars for the new four-oared
barge being built for the Ariels will be
got from the East.
The entries for the A. B. Treadwell ju
nior medal for skiffmen close at the house
of the Dolphin Boating Club at 10 o'clock
on Sunday morning, May 15. The race
will take place on the 22d. Up to the
present there are ihree entries: Victor
Caglieri, T. J. Hopkins and C. M. Far
rell. The executive committee has been
instructed to buy pulleys and exercising
machines; and in order to offer greater
attractions to members at the clubhouse
it has been suggested that a piano should
be purchased. The following constitute
the committee for the nomination of offi
cers: J. S. Earls, Elkon Coney, Joseph
Farrell, C. M. Farrell and L. Duncan.
The South End Rowing Club picnic was
quite successful, and now that it is over
members will resume rowing and crews
will be organized. It Is probable that the
manager of El Campo will arrange for a
regatta there soon to extend over two
Sundays, all the barge races being- held
on one day and the skiff races on the
other The South End Rowing Club has
promised its support and will probably
enter representatives in every race. The
club entertains high hopes of Len Hausler
winning the Junior shell race, but fears
that it may lose the services of Dr. C. C.
Dennis, who is a lieutenant in the naval
battalion.
The Triton Boat Club is in a flourishing
condition as regards its finances, the
number of its members and the condition
of Its boats and clubhouse; all bills arc
paid and there is money on hand. There
are about a dozen applicants for member
ship The election of club officers is ap
proaching; the new board of directors
will take charge next month. Orders have
been placed for new boats.
The ranks of the Alameda Boat Club
have beÂ«n depleted by the enlistment into
the army of five membersâ B. H. and J.
G Hanks, Otto Meyer and E. H. Hen
ninger, all of the First Regiment, and J.
C Stamer of Company G, Alameda. Otto
Meyer was a particularly promising mem
ber of the Junior crew. John Lewis will
probably be the club representative in
outrigged skiff races this season. The
new four-oared barge, which was chris
tened some weeks ago, is finished, and
will be ready for use to-morrow; addi
tional braces* have been put in and it Is
now a strong boat.
THE LAST DAYS OF
COLLEGE SPORT.
Mourning is the costume of the Califor
nia track team. Cheated out of a trip
East, their cherished scheme of visiting
the three large cltieS in the north and" en
gaging in athletic combat with their
northern rivals having come to naught,
they are deploring the fate that deprives
them of a vacation at the expense of the
people. Plans had ben consummated for
field days with the Multnomah, Seattle
and Tacoma athletic clubs. Expenses
had been guaranteed and everthlng was
In readiness for an early departure, when
Manager Dozier received information
from the Multnomahs that their team
was sadly crippled by the enlistment of
men in the volunteer army, and conse
quently the team would be bo weakened
that it would b% useless to compete with
THE SAIS FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAX 14, 189 S.
the crack Berkeley team with any hope
of victory. As the Multnomahs are the
strongest aggregation of athletic talent
in the north, and as the trip was planned
principally for this meeting. It waa
deemed best to postpone at least for a
time the intended trip.
At one time it looked as if there would
be a rupture between Garret Cocnran,
the university football coach, and the ath
letic management. Cochran, with his
Eastern ideas, expected a greater en
thusiasm In matters of football. The in
difference displayed by the students in
the preliminary practice brought about
seemingly inextricable difficulties, but an
understanding has been reached and it
is now expected thnt nothing but har
mony will exist. <'uchran will return a
few weeks before the. opening of the col
lege and reeontinue preliminary practice
for the fall season.
At Stanford the students are in the
midst of their examinations and athletics
of every kind are relegated to a top shelf.
Nothing will be done at Palo Alto until
the beginning of September.

SOME OP THE HIGH-CLASS DOGS THAT WILL BE ON EXHIBITION AT THE DOG SHOW.
IN THE WORLD
OF BASEBALL
BY JOE CORBETT.
The battery work of Whalen and Pet
ers of the Stockton team was the feature
of last Sunday's game in Stockton.
White, centerflelder of Stockton, set the
fans wild by his wonderful fielding, mak
ing no less than six winning catches of
the "hair's breadth order" in last Sun
day's game against Oakland.
Henry Krug's desira for his release
from the San Francisco team was dissi
pated as a result of last Sunday's game.
"Hennie" has decided to remain this sea
son with the home club, where his pitch
ing should prove an important factor in
that organization's championship aspira
tions.
Russell of the Oaklands has made good
the assertion that he can pitch. He was
particularly effective against Stockton,
with men on bases, and fields his position
beautifully. As a battery pitcher he has
few superiors.
Harry Monahan, alias "Keegan," sub
stitute for Olympic Cyclers, San Fran
clscos and Bushnell Alert* Juniors, is of
the opinion that ball players would make
good soldiers and should be compelled to
enlist. The most remarkable thing about
"Keegan's" theories is that he can give
no reason why ball players should make
better soldiers than the ordinary creature.
It is hinted that these peculiar theories
of Harry's have been the cause of his
being placed on the substitute list. It's a
sad case. President Bert should take im
mediate action, or, as "Keegan" inno
cently says, "I will never play againâ
not if Manager Coffroth should pay me
in advance."
Payne's fielding and base running will
continue to be a feature of all games
participated in by the San Froncfscos, he
having settled his differences with Man
ager Coffroth of that club.
Manager Swing of the Oaklands cer
tainly made a "scoop" when ha secured
the services of Jim Sullivan as backstop
for his club. This player has a finÂ© rep-
JUNIOR LADIES
ON THE
TENNIS COURTS.
The ladies' Junior class of the "Cali
fornia Tennis Club" have been monopoUz-
I ing the courts during the week. On
J Wednesday afternoon they held their in
| itiai singles tournament, and it was a suc
| cess in every detail. Miss Eleanor Eck
j art won the tournament and with it a
' handsome prize. She easily demonstrated
j her superiority on the courts over her
, fair sisters. In the finals between Miss
1-Vkart and Miss Foster the best play
ing of the day was seen. However, after
a spirited contest, the champion, by
splendid volleying and superb judgment,
| won the set by a score of f> â 4.
The preliminary games resulted as fol
lows: Miss Ruth Foster defeated Miss
Edith Chesebrough in a love set. The
i playing of Miss Foster was too steady
'. and too accurate for her inexperienced
| opponent. But Miss Foster's playing
showed indications of future victories on
' tht courts. Miss Eleanor Eckart defeated
i Miss Helen Chesebrough in a love set.
1 Another one-sided match was that of
Miss Foster and Miss K.lna Middieton,
< in which the latter was defeated by a
j score of 6âl.6 â 1. Then Miss Eckart and
! Miss Clara Tickner stepped on the courts
i for Quite a closely contested match,
which, despite the score, proved to be
i one of the most interesting games of the
day. Miss Eckart won six games to her
opponent's two. That left Miss Eleanor
H< kart and Miss Foster to play for eham-
I plunshlp honors.
Next Wednesday afternoon the ladles'

as a catcher and batter. .' No use . talking '
â a ball manager has got to be on the

well be playing with the home club. Man

templates .building when he permitted
Ewing to step in and sign this â¢ "star"
player. However, the home club is pretty
strong behind the bat.. " ':
Every time "Hughes drops a game the
"fans" begin : to speculate as to his finish.
When he wins it's this remark: "My, but
Hughes is a great pitcher! He beat so
and fso ; yesterday; wonder how long ,he
will. keep up the good- work." 3hould he
lose, as -on yesterday, it's the same - old
story: "I told you so." Now a pitcher
cannot win all the time. If he could,
there would be no ball games. Yesterday's
defeat is nothing. . True, it would have
been much â¢ better for the -; club and for
his friends had he won,- yet it is cruel to
expect this young man to win every game
he pitches. - Already he has played in
three games against Boston. Out of those
games he has won two, < a : record ;to be
proud of.'- The management ; docs not ex
pect him to win every game; he : does not
expect .to. accomplish this feat, himself,
because: it is next to impossible. If this
be the case, as l am quite certain; it is,
why.'should Californlans: then expect him
to do things that . are not baseball?; Luck

There is some talk of conferring a honor
ary membership upon Ralph Bllven by
the directors of the California Tennis
Club. Bllven in the full ardor of his
patriotism enlisted in the volunteers as
soon as the Government made its first
call for help. While the club loses one of
its best players, the regret of his fellow
clubmen will be transformed into a sub
i-t:iutiai recognition of IJliven's loyalty by
the presentation of a life membership.

The interclub doubles are attracting
considerable attention among tile racket
wielders of the bay towns. To-day on
the Alameda. courts, the second game of
the series will be played between the first,
teams of the Oakland and the Alameda
clubs. There is a strong effort being
made to induce the Whitneys to be the
first representatives of the California
Club, but it seems hardly probable that
the San Francis*.-o champions will play
under the club's colors.
Owing to internal dissensions in the
California. Tennis Club, the Whitneys
have refused to appear on any court
carrying the club's standards. Should this
refusal continue, the California Tennis
Club will have some difficulty in finding
substitutes for them.

CYCLERS STILL
DISCUSS
THE RELAY RACE.
Although the annual relay race for IS9B
has passed and been won by the same
club for the fourth successive time, It Is
Btlll the principal topic of conversation
among the racing enthusiasts. Rumors of
protests have been rffe, but they have
( ended as they startedâ in wind. There was
also some talk about matching the Bay
City and Olympic teams to ride the dis
tance over again, this time on a track;
but the former club laughed at the propo
sition. President Kerrigan told them that
his club's team had been selected with a
view to its efficiency on the road; some
of them were not speedy track riders.
Further, he thought that the race would
develop into a case of follow-the-leader,
until the tenth relay, when there would
be a ten-mile race between Wing (Olym
pic) and Furman (Bay City), and that as
the latter was immeasurably Wing's su
perior the result would be a foregone con
clusion, and, such being the case, it would
not draw a crowd and the clubs would be
out money on the proposition.
Furman, who is a Postal-Telegraph op
erator at L,os Angeles, went back to his
key on Wednesday. He said before leav
ing- that, as Wing had plenty of time, he
could come down there and get a match if
he wanted it, -but expressed little expect
ancy that he would.
The Olympic team is still intact, and, al
though defeated, may take up the chal
lenge of the Reno Wheelmen and go to
Nevada some Sunday in the near future
for a match race at tifty miles, each man
to ride a relay of five miles.
Ex-Captain Joe Catanich of the Imperial
Cycling Club regrets that his club did not
put In a team now, as he thinks it had
racing men fast enough to land their col
j ors well up to the front. The San Fran
cisco Road Club is another organization
that should have entered the race. These
ciubs will find that their racing men like
! to be represented on relay teams, and are
j likely to desert and join other clubs that
do put in teams if their own club does not.
Witness the cases of the Black brothers
of the Golden Gate, now of the Bay City,
and Bozlo, formerly Imperial, now Olym-
Howard W. Squires of the Acme Club
Wheelmen, who rode the third relay last
Sunday for that club, has written a let
j ter to the captain of the Bay City "Wheel
men denying that he said anything that
could be construed as inferring that Ben
Noonan of the Bay City team was paced
on that relay. Squires says as far as he
knows Noonan rode a fair and square
race throughout the entire course.
Now that the relay is over the few re
maining unplayed games of the Cycle
Clubs' Baseball League will have to be
attended to. The finish is between the
Olympic Cyclers, Olympic Wheelmen and
Bay City Wheelmen! The Bay City team
will be out practicing to-morrow at the
Sixteenth street grounds.

The I'nion Coursing Park Association,
recognizing the bonds of fellowship in all
lines of sport, and being desirous of fur
ther cementing the same, has set aside

season there will be five two-days'
matches between the Alameda and Pa
cific clubs, three of which will be played
at Golden Gate, and two on the Webster
street ground at Alameda.
The opening match of the season was
begun last Sunday on the Golden Gate

Alameda clubs. The Pacific team batted
first, and, aided by scores of 45 from F.
Sewell, 46 from T. W. G. Wallace, 36 from
J. J. Theobard, and 22 from J. H. Harbour,
ran up a total of 213. At the call of time
Alameda had made 89 runs for 7 wickets, i
R. B. Hogues. 42. and J. H. Spiro, 23, be- I
ing the best scores. Sewell and Harbour !
bowled best for the Pacifies, and Croll ;
and Baugh for the Alamedas. The match
will be continued to-morrow, and unless
the last three wickets can add 45 runs to
the Alameda score the champions of 1897

GOV. STAN FORD CRITICISED
Legislation That Required "Explain
ing" at Great Cost to tho
Railroad.
, The examination of C. P. Huntingdon
Uv.\ls continued before Commissioner Hea-
B v ok yesterday, but as on former occa
sions no attempt was made to draw from
him any information regarding the man
ner in which a certain newspaper of this
city levied blackmail upon the Southern
racilic Company for a number of years,
the thousands of dollars necessary to
tnec-t its demands being charged on the
books of the company to the item of
contingent expenses.
It being the purpose of the present
investigation to ascertain, if possible, the
details of this contingent expense account,
the reason for the silence of the attor
neys on this matter, which is of common
knowledge, is not readily apparent.
The witness was interrogated ort other
Items involved in the sum of $6,000,000 paid
out by the company prior to 1886 and
charged up to contingent expenses. Hun
tin^ton said on Thursday that the greater
portion of this money had been used to
promote the very necessary work of "ex
plaining" to legislators the advantages of
legislation desired by the railroad com-
pany. ~â
"Human " nature has not changed since
ISS6, has It?" asked Judge Hayne at the
beginning of yesterday's proceedings.
"I cannot say that it has," replied Hun
tington. "I should say that about the
same methods of making explanations are
required now as were necessary then.
About the only difference is that we do
Dot have so much important business now
as formerly."
"Bow about the funding bill?"
"Well, that has been pending in one
form or another for a long time. I think
Congress made a great mistake in not
passing it."
'Did you have any explaining to do in
connection with that bill?"
"Oh, yes; we attempted to Instruct the
Congressmen concerning the value of the
conditions of the bill. We tried to show
them that it was a good bill."
"If it was a good bill why did they
not riisfe it?"
"I'll tell you. Where there are 100 men
who know what is right, there will be
but one of the number who will have
the courage to do what is right. For in
stance, me will Bay, 'Why should we
compel this great corporation to pay but
2 per cent, when the farmer and mer
chant are compelled to pay 5, 6 or -.7
per cent? No matter how fair the propo
sition may be they will get out of it on
some such excuse as that."
"Did you have any explaining to do
in connection with the San Pedro mat
ter?"
"Yes, we did all that we could In the
time that we ha<i at our disposal. It cost
us a lot of money to get up maps showing
the advantages of Santa Monica over San
Pedro, and wo did everything that we
thought the occasion warranted. But it
was useless â not because we were wrong
or In error in any of our statements, but

"Did y^u ever have to explain things

of the boards to which you refer. Judg

say that no one had ever explained things

by him "were too expensive."
When asked to what degree the South
ern Pacific Company entered into politics
In this State, Huntingdon treated his lis
teners to a long discourse on the folly and
cost of a corporation attempting to do
politics and its own business at the same
"When I was first elected to the presi- I
dency of the Southern Pacific Company of
Kentucky," he said, "I found that we :

The hearing was continued until Mon
day morning, and In the meantime Hunt
ington and his attorneys will decide
whether or not they will produce In court
a detailed statement of the cost of op
erating the lines of the Southern Pacific
system for the years ISOS aiid 1596. Attor
ney Herrin said yesterday that such a
statement would not be made unless It
was ordered by the court. He intimated
that even if such an order was made it
would require several years to prepare
the statement.
Mr Herrin further stated that the com
pany had offered the Railroad Commis
sioners its books, that a thorough investi
gation might be made by their experts,
and if the Commissioners insisted would
bring the books one by one Into court
and let them r^ad off every item. He
added that the books could not be copied
by 100 men in a year's time, because it
takes two or three hundred men constant
ly at work to keep a current record of
these transactions.
ARMED MEN ARE
IN POSSESSION
Behrend Joost Asserts His
Claim to a Quarry on
Corbett Avenue.
He and His S^on Martin and Peter
Walsh Arrested on the Charge
of Malicious Mischief.
Behrend Joost. his som Martin B. Joost,
and Peter Walsh were arrested yesterday
afternoon by Sergeant Shea and posse
on warrants charging them with malic
ious mischief. They were released on $40
cash bail each. There are also warrants
out for the arrest of "John Doe" and
"Richard Roe."
The complaining witness is Frank Mc-
Ginnis, a laborer, employed by the Bluo
Rock Contracting Company in a quarry
on Corbett avenue, near Falcon avenue.
According to McGinnis, the quarry used
to be owned by Joott, and recently he
applied to the superintendent for payment
of the amount due on the lease. Pay
ment was refused on the ground that he
was not the owner, so last Tuesday night
Joost and five men armed with rifles went
to the quarry, broke open the black
smith'- sbop and threw out the wagons
and implements and tore up the railroad
truck lor about fifty yards. Since then
Joost and three armed men bad eamjM 1
at the quarry and would not permit the
men to work or relay the rails.
Joost claims he is the sole owner of the
quarry and has a right to do what he
likes with his own property. "I leas.-d
the quaffy." he said yesterday, "to Na
than Crocker for two years on May 1, lsLÂ«3,
at a rental of $70 per month with the op
tion of a renewal for three years more.
Crocker now owes for rent $1650, and I
cannot collect a cent from him. In July,
1597, I assigned my interest in the quarry
i to William Lange Jr., but on May 9 last
| he retransferred the interest to me. so
! that I could get full possession. The
i Blue Rock Contracting Company is sim
â  ply Crocker. He is secretary and his
! wife and daughters are the directors. A
i friend of his, John Heany, is the prest-
I dent. I gave a trust deed in 1892 to Oh-
I landt and Buck and they foreclosed on
! it, obtaining judgment from Judge Bel
! cher, but the case is on appeal to the Su
preme Court. The quarry In question
' was not included in the trust deed, and
' I am determined to hold it against all
I comers. Tuesday night there were only
myself, my son and Walsh that wÂ»-nt to
i the quarry. We found the blacksmith's
! shop door open and threw out the wagons
! and things and then tore up the rails.

HARRY EMERIC
A CONTESTANT
Objects to the Probating
of the Will Left by
His Wife.
He Claims That She Was Un
duly Influenced by Her
Relatives.
Public Administrator Wanta to Hold.
tho Estate Pending the Con
troversy.
There will be a contest over the pro
bating of the will of the late Mrs. Eu
genic Emerlc, who left the bulk of an
estate valued at about $125,000 to her sis
ter, Lorena Myrtle Barbier. The papers
in the contest were tiled last evening by
Harry F, Emeric, the husband of the
deceased. Emeric claims that the most
of the property was deeded by him to his
wife and that owing to the undue influ
ence of her relatives she almost entirely
ignored him when drawing up the let
ters testamentary.
Emeric sets forth In his pleadings that
Lorena Myrtle Barbier had been friendly
toward him until January 26, 1856, and
that since that time she has
always evinced the greatest enmity to
ward him. He further alleges that Mrs.
Emeric was unduly Influenced by stories
told her by her sister, picturing him as
being bad, vicious and unfaithful.
Simultaneous with the filing of the con
test there was a petition Hied by the
Public Administrator, asking to be
granted letters of special administration
on the estate. Public Administrator
Freese sets forth in his petition that he is
acting at the request of the husband, who
realizes that the contest will be a long
one and that the estate will in the mean
time suffer unless some one is appointed
to look after it.

SOMPS AND HIS REVOLVER.
The Soda Water Merchant Causes a
Panic in a Saloon.
Emile Somps, a soda water merchant,
who has a somewhat dangerous proclivity
for brandishing a' loaded revolver occa
sionally, has been placed under police
surveillance for an exhibition of his dex
terity with the weapo" in ihe Auditorium
saloon Thursda; evening. He entered the
saloon early in the evening, and a.fter
a few words with Louis Fieb/er, one of
the proprietors, on business affairs â Fich
t> r having at one time been a customer of
Sompfl In the purchase of soda water â
n to abase the saloonkeeper for not
continuing to d^al with him. Fichter paid
no attention to him. and Somps seeing
that talking was of no avail deliberately
si>at upon him. This exasperated Fichter,
and he reached behind the counter for
a bottle to use as a weapon. Somps see
ing, and mistaking the meaning of the
move, drew a revolver and threatened to
shoot.
Although the word most uttered nowa
days and most thought of is war, firearms
in the nature of revolvers have little at
traction or fascination for frequenters of
saloons, and in a moment there were
about a docen or more revelers, includ
ing the barkeeper himsf-lf, making a mad
rush" for the door. Upon gaining the
street Somps quickly and mysteriously
disappeared.
The Wasp This Week.
Profusely illustrated and replete with
interesting and timely reading matter this
week's "Wasp" is more than ordinariy
bright. There are a number of splendid
half tones of the "Boys in Blue" from
Los Angeles on their way to the Presidio,
and a picture of Colonel Smith of the
First Infantry California Volunteers and
his staff. "The Dream of Governor
Budd " in which he saw Spanish spies
throwing loaded bombs at him, is im
pressably pictured. Uncle Sam taking
some of the tin soldiers down from their
high horses is also splendidly caricatured.
The dicussion regarding the changing of
the name of Balboa boulevard, which has
resulted in a clash between the Mayor
and the Supervisors, is pictorially trt-at
ed. Of the many literary features, the
expose of the optician humbug in Under
the X Ray; the Social Side Lights, which
tell of the amorous but prudent young
men in the local four hundred; the musi
cal criticisms by Professor Lucchesi and
a short story with a moral by Herbert
Manning Brace are well worth reading.
The financial department; the Plain Talks
to Public Characters, in which ex-Fore
man of the Grand Jury A. Gerberding
is addressed, and Hon. Lawrence Mul
rooney's letters on the wiles of machine
politicians are other features of the Wuap
this week.
Town Talk
This week has a splendid table of con-
tents: Guard stories by the
Saunterer, Phil Garlic's cynicisms and
"Our Opinion" of the Californian as a
soldier; an able review of the pantomime
and musical critiques upon various
events; a storiette from real life and a
bright bit of dialogue; portraits of prom
inent persons, including the dramatic so
prano, Cecile yon Seiberlich.
Matron Walsh Beinstated.
The Health and Police Committee of the
Supervisors yesterday voted to recom
mend the reinstatement of Mrs. Walsh
as matron of the City Prison, who has
been under suspension for being absent
from duty without permission.
Attracted by Posters.
The poster exhibition given by a num
ber of the prominent society ladies and
artists of this city In aid of the Eye and
Ear Hospital Is meeting with the most
flattering success. Over 1000 posters and
other objects of art are on exhibition,
and many of the best known local artists
and musicians are in constant attendance.
The managers have yielded to tho request
to keep tho doors open longer than at
first Intended. The hours are from 2 to
6 o'clock in the afternoon, but to-day they
will be open also from 7 to 11 o clock,
and on next Monday from 2 to 6.
ANIMALS ALMOST HUMAN.
Wonderful Performance of Shetland
Ponies, Dogs, Monkeys and
a Goat.
Norris Brothers' Dog and Pony Circus
at Central Park continues to grow in
popularity and the management has de
cided to remain another week. It is cer
tainly the most unique and highly enter
taining exhibition. The intelligence of the
ponies and dogs has been developed in a
wonderful manner, and they appear al
most human in obeying the commands of
their master. There are thirty little Shet
land ponies, about eighty dogs, a large
family of trained monkeys and one sol
emn looking goat in the company.
The opening act, a military drill by
eigth little Shetland ponies, is especially
good as is also the representation of a
minstrel first part, in which thirty dogs
participate. There are several clowns
among the dogs, and their antics create
much amusement. One of the features
of the show is the arresting of a recalci
trant dog by a monkey policeman. A pa
trol wagon comes dashing into the ring,
the policeman jumps out, seizes the of
fender by the collar, waves a club just as
a "cop" would and hustles him into the
wagon and off to prison. There is rope
skipping by a pony and dogs; ponies play
at see-saw; tight rope walking by a dog,
monkey and goat. Bareback riding acts
of various kinds. In fact, a regular cir
cus is given by these performing ani
mals. There is a very exciting leaping
contest by a pack of English greyhounds,
after which a email cottage in one end of
the tent is set on fire and a complete ani
mal fire department with hook and lad
der, truck and hose reel, come dashing In.
They mount ladders to the second story
windows, rescue a family of dogs who live
in the cottage, carry out the household
effects and finally extinguish the blaze.
HIS LIFE SAVED
BY A BANK BOOK
Terence McCabe Fires a Shot at
Close Range at John Reidy,
Hotel Keeper.
McCsbs Arrested and Booked on a
Charge of ABsaut to Commit
Murder.
Terence McCabe, a laborer, 50 years of
age, fired a shot at John Reidy, hotel
keeper, 1504 Kentucky street, yesterday ;
afternoon, and if it had not been for a
bank book and some papers that Reidy
had in his pocket he would have been a
subject for the Coroner.
McCabe had been living at Reidy'B ho
tel for several years, but recently had '
fallen In arrear for his board and lodg- j
ing. He worked at the sugar-house and I
a few days ago Reidy garnisheed his !
wages, which led to his dismissal from
the sugar-house. Since then he had been
drinking considerably and brooding over
his misfortunes.
About 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Reidy and a friend, Bert Swenton, were
pluying a game of cards in the bar, when
BfoCaba made his appearance. He was
under the Influence of liquor. Without
suying a word he walked up to Reidy and
deliberately fired at his side. The bullet
pajHMd through a Hibernia Bank book,
two receipt books and some receipts that
Reidy had in his coat pocket, and lodged
in the lining of the pocket. Reidy es
caped with an abrasion of the skin.
Before McCabe could fire again he was
uverpowered and detained till Lieutenant
Anderson and Policeman r. Meehan ar
rived and placed him under arrest. He
w;is taken to the City Prison, where a
charge of assault to commit murder was
booked against him. It is almost a mira
cle that it was not a charge of murder.
MORE SUPPORT IS NEEDED.
The Soldier Boys Must Realize Some
thing From the Floral Fete.
The fifteenth semi-annual fÂ«-te of the
State Floral Society Unless liberally pat
ronized to-day will, in all probability, be
a scant and somewhat doubtful financial
success.
Every effort has been exerted by the
management to obtain and represent the
entire floral wealth of the State and
place it before the public that the people
of this city might look upon the beau
ties of California, and at the same time
remember the boys in blue on the battle
field, to whom the proceeds of the exhi
bition, had it been a success, would have
been devoted. The object of the exhibi
tion this year was not founded simply
on showing the beauties of the State; it
was given for the Red Cross and wholly
for the sake and in the interest of hu
manity.
The volunteers who left California to
fight for the stars and stripes, it seems,
so the management thinks, are not being
v<ry dearly remembered by those they
left behind, and, unless the financial tide
changes for the better at Qoldea Gate
Hull this afternoon, it is rather doubtful
whether the object in view can possibly
be accomplished.
Among the attractions presented yester
day afternoon was a floral model of the
battle-ship Maine, being presented by Pel

NORTHERN MEN
BADLY BEATEN
Business Men Win a Clean
Victory at Basket
Ball.
ThÂ« Reeult Was Partially Owing to
the Weight of the Home
Team.
\
The champions ot the Northwest, the
Portlands of Oregon, were badly beaten
at basket ball by the business men in the
j Y. M. C. A. Gymnasium last night, and
! the latter team still holds the Pacific
1 Coast championship.
The Portlands lay their defeat to two
things: First, they were pitted against a
much heavier team, and, second, they
i were not at home on the floor. They
played a plucky game, however, from
start to finish, and their weak point seem
ed to be in their inability to get the ball
inside the basket. In all other ways they
j seemed almost equal to their opponents,
I but just as they were on the point of win
ning and there was nothing to do but
drop the ball into the basket, a wild
throw would send it hurtling outside the
lines, and in a twinkliner it would be up
to the other goal. This is partially ex
plained, by the fact that the boys from
the north play in a slightly dieffrent way
i from the local men. Here the men are
instructed to toss the ball high and let
it drop into the baskot. while the others
are accustomed to playing with a net
1 back of the ball, and endeavor to strike
the net in such a manner that the ball
will rebound into the basket. To make
; things easier for the visiting team a
screen was placed back of one of the bas
kets, while the other was fastened close
to the gallery wall. It is probable, how
i ever, that the screen was not at the ac
customed distance, as the boys could get
the ball anywhere but in the basket.
The teams lined up as follows: Port
landâJ. Viggers (captain), forward; H.
Gordon, forward; J. Miller, cen
ter; J. Mac Moneys, guard; LÂ«. My
ers, guard; Otto Stark, substitute.
Business Menâ W. Wilson, center; L. Ti
! tus, forward; C. J. Auger, forward; F.
I Batzer, guard; C. Bernhard. guard; 1.
Goodrich, forward.
At the close of the first half the score
stood 19 to 1 in favor of the Business
M*n the one point of the Portlands hav
ing been won on a foul. The men from
Oregon were not discouraged , however,
and went in to the second fully aware or
their defects and determined to correct
them if possible, but play as they might
it seemed impossible to get the ball into
the basket. Toward the end or the half
they were allowed twÂ« fouls. Captain
Viggers accordingly rrfade two shies at
the basket, missing each time. The ball
was caught by one of his men. who had
another fair chance, but he also missed,
< and in less than two minutes the ball lay
' snugly in the basket at the other goal.
When time was finally called the score
stood 31 to 4 in favor of the local team.
,4t is probable that a match will oe se
! cured for some time next week with the
Rushers, a much llgjiter team than the
Business Men.
TOO POOR TO BURY HIS CHILD.
A Sad Case of Destitution Made
Known to the Police.
A sad case of destitution was brought
to the attention of Captain Gillen of the
Seventeenth street police station yester
' day afternoon. It was reported to him
' that a child had been lying dead for a
1 week at 47 Lower Terrace place, between
Seventeenth and Douglass streets. Offi
cer Robinson reported that a man named
Hugh Scanlon resided at the place desig :
Dated with his wife and six children; one,
the seventh, a little girl aged thirteen
months, was lying dead, there being no
funds with which she could be buried;
and in addition to this sad state of af
fairs a little boy, aged four years, was
suffering from diphtheria. It was the
same disease which had carried away the
little girl one week ago. The father, who
is reported to be a har.l working man, has
been out of employment since last Christ
mas and as a consequence is so poor that
he could not procure medical attendance
for his sick children, nor had the means
i to give to the dead child the plainest kind
of a burial.
Some of the neighbors, however, re
j ported the family's condition to the sis
ters at Mount St. Joseph Home at Haight
! and Baker streets, from which Sister
Mary Theodore was dispatched. She has
taken charge of the little boy and pro
cured for him medicine and other neces
sities while Sister Clare from Fillmore
and Haves started out to raise a collec
tion to bury the dead child. Scanlon and
, the remainder of his family are in abso
; lute want.

"The Cathode, or X-Ray," its discovery
and vast influence on medical science was
the subject that Professor Abrams of
Cooper Medical College chose as the most

the series. After a minute and exhaus
tive discussion of the benefits the dis

ical science to a certain degreeâ the many

of disease and the many negative re

An Afflicted Mother.
From the Times, Paw Paw, 111.
A resident of this town who has lost
! two children during the past -six years by
violent deaths has been utterly prostrated
by the shjek. and seriously sick as a re-
sult of itL One child (aged 9) was killed
by a cyclone In '90 while at school; an-
other three years later, was run over by
a Burlington railway train. That griefs
and misfortunes may so prey on the mind
as to lead to serious physical disorders
has been well demonstrated in this case.
As a result of them, her health was shat-
tered and she has been a constant suf-
ferer since 1690. Her principal trouble has
been neuralgia of the stomach which was
very painful, and exhibited all the symp-
toms of ordinary- neuralgia, nervousness
I and indigestion. Physicians did her no
good whatever. She was discouraged and
abandoned all hope of getting well, t ' >nal-
lv however, a certain well-known pill
: wo s recommended (Dr. Williams' Pink
1 Pills for Pale People).
<^he supplied herself with a quantity of
them and had not taken them two weeks
| when she noticed a marked improvement

: the pills until seven or eight boxes had
! been consumed and she considered herself
i entirely cured. She can now eat all kinds
i of food, which is something she has not
'â â  been able to do for years. She is not

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath it, if any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When !
the pressure is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north i
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
bat when the "law" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is lm
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of i
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali- j
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected j
In summer and colder weather in winter. The j
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 13.â T0-day's stock mar
ket continued In much the same unsettled state
as was the case yesterday. Early depression
was reflected from London, where the profes
sionals, were selling American stocks on a ru
mor that the Spanish fleet was off Sandy Hook.
The improbable character of this report gives
an explanation to a decline which was on
vlnusly due to bear pressure. Apparently
there was a disposition also on the part of the
leaders of the bull element to stand by and see
a test of the market strength. The recent
large and sustained advance, it was thought,
had invited large buying on light margins by
the purely speculative element. This class of
holdings is a weakness for a bull movement on
account of its inability to hold stocks through
any decline. Occasional reactions of sufficient
dimension to force the liquidation of such ac
counts are therefore considered healthful In any
bull movement. The day's market did not Indi
cate that the volume of such accounts was very â 
large. In spite of a vigorous drive by the
bears, apparently acquiesced In by the bulls,
which resulted at one time in declines running
from 1 to 3 points, there was no very large
volume of stock dislodged and the bears has
tened to cover. Some very large financial Inter
ests are credited with having taken profits on the
recent rise and with being willing to see a re
action for the purpose of getting a gain. Com
mission house buying in the early dealings was
large and was quite effective in offsetting the
large selling for -London account. But offer
ings were no more than absorbed without car
rying prices above yesterday's level. After
the market had thus been tested business fell
Into dullness and assumed a waiting attitude.
Net changes on the day are extremely narrow
~ and are for the most part losses.
The bond market was quiet outside a few
speculative Issues and the tone was rather
heavy. Total sales, $2,600,000.
United States new 4s declined %c, old 4s reg

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. May 13.â The Boston Commercial
Bulletin will say to-morrow of the wool mar
ket: Under the demand encouraged by Gov
ernment contracts, coupled with the necessi
ties of a few mills for fine staple stock, â¢ the
| market In domestic wools has experienced con
siderable activity this week.
The bulk of the trade, however, .as last week,
comprises transactions in wool suitable for the
demands of the moment, and this fact, there
fore, - gives little encouragement to 'the - dealer
who Is looking for better business In the re-
establishment upon normal Sines of the ordi
nary trade. Nevertheless a distinctly better
â  feeling Is prevalent throughout the market.
I and although dealer* recognize the necessity
I for maintaining their, prices at all costs for
; some little time to come, they are now doing
i so with better grace and with more assurance
than hitherto.
The sales of the week are: 1,197.000 pounds
domestic and 425,000 pounds foreign, against
745,000 pounds domestic and 265,000 pounds for
eign last week, and 963,000 pounds domestic and
2,596,000 pounds foreign for the same week last
year.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: In the main
Wall street has devoted ', the ' present week to
an active bullish speculation, based \on , the
naval victory . at Manila and the ; expectation
of other successes, as well as on the evidences
of Spain's financial and military weakness and
the belief that the war will be soon decided,
even if peace is not at once assured. The ex
cited speculation in grain and the high : quo
tations recorded for wheat were also bullish
factors, mainly because. in conjunction * with
the prospect of another large wheat crop, s the
prices apparently Jnsure a very prosperous sea
son to the Western railroads. The stock mar
ket was not, however, â¢ without spells of hesita
tion, or even of slight ! reaction. London was
also a rather pronounced seller of stocks , on
the advance, professional . interests there . dis
posing of : considerable â¢ amounts < which were
bought on the .declines â in March and ; April. 1
I United ; States offerings were, however, well
I taken and ' the volume of transactions, includ
ing as : they did heavy buying orders through
commission houses, indicates that the public
I interest Vln â¢ : speculation -.'; has â¢ revived. -<\ The
passage of stocks from strong into weak hands
was, . however, a feature, and Its natural con
sequence, was that toward the end of the week
the market appeared. to be overbought and had
a disposition to , rest in the absence | of | further
favorable news and â to wait for ! developments
in connection with the campaign against Cuba
and Porto Rico. *â  This naturally provoked some
realizing by - professionals, â¢ as :. well :- as . bearish
activity by the ; traders. There was i more -or
less pool manipulation seen in the market, and
some of the â  sepcialtlee were j -the â  objects -of
revived activity of an artificial origin. Â»

period of time, for twenty-flyÂ« years past,
there has come * a lull and ; the reaction from
the abnormally high " prices, caused by the
squeeze in the May delivery, : which, however,
has left prices far " above " quotations for at
least ten years ! back. Telegraphic and cable
advices to Bradstreet' only accentuate the
already well-known * bullish nature of the im
mediate wheat situation, while on the other
hand, < owing: to the generally admitted good
crop situation, particularly: in this and other
countries, the outlook appears to favor some
what lower prices than those now ruling for
next . season's yield although above the aver
age of those : ruling for the past six years.
With the quieting down of interest In wheat
there has come a partial ; shifting of specula
tive ' interest to other grains, particularly corn
and oats and many classes of provisions, with
advances in nearly all . those llijes.
A rather mom confident feeling seems to per
vade the iron trade, which is reflected In frac
tional advances for leading makes of Iron and
steel. , Features of the â¢ week are very heavy
sales of piglron at many markets, but It is
again claimed that stocks have begun to accu
mulate at some points as a result of the â  con
tinued enormous production, which Is placed
at : 1,000,000 tons per month. Perhaps one of
the most Interesting features of the week, and
one especially : acceptable because of the hith
erto very depressed conditions prevailing. is
the reported slight Improvement in Inquiry
and In tone of the wool market at several cen
ters. The price situation is still one of great
strength, but particularly so In food products,
which are. with few exceptions, notably coffee
and sugar, higher on the week.
Wheat exports were larger this week, aggre
gating 3.682.543 bushels, against a total last
week (corrected) of 2.923.77.' bushels, arid com
paring with 2,IS3<W) bushels in this week a
year ago. 1,808,000 bushels 1n;1596; 2.397,000 bush
els In 1895 and 2.420.000 bushels In 1894.
Business failures In the. United States show
a slight gain for the week, numbering 250.
against 240 last week, 251 In this week a year
ago, 265 in 1896 and 210 In 1895. .
Failures In the Dominion of Canada this

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW Y<~>RK. May 13â R. G. Pun A Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Hostilities have lasted long enough to kill
many predictions but few Americans. The
European notion that the United States would
begin by having a bad half hour, the theorist
notion that "everybody knows a great panic
must follow the outbreak of war"; the com
mercial buyers notion that everybody would be
ready to sell everything cheap if war came;
the notion that It would pay to hoard money
until the emergency had passed have all been
made laughable already. The only panic was
when money lenders were wondering what im
possibilities the future might have in store
for them. The only hindrance to Industry has
been due to waiting of buyers who looked for
lower prices.
Nothing disheartening can be seen in the In
dustrial situation, except the closing of some
cotton mills owing to overproduction and the
fall of print cloths to 1.87 cents. Cotton has
not risen above 6.37 c and many stories of re
duced acreage are current, as a year ago, but
they do not weigh much In view of the actual
receipts of 10,600.000 bales. The sales of wool
have been only 4.0*5,000 pounds at the chief
markets for two weeks, against 14,530,400 pounds
last year, and 11,216.760 pounds In 1892, but
prices are somewhat more firm and there Is
more demand for goods apart from the large
Government orders.
The demand for boots and shoes, having
passed all records in recent months, has
abated and yet many orders are coming for
ward and just at the point where there is gen
eral change from one season to another.
Leather is rising, with no active demand and
hides at Chicago have advanced about 4 per
cent in spite of the fact that cattle slaughter
ed at the four chief Western markets this year
are considerably more than In any other one
year except in 1891 and 1894. The output of
pisriron. 243.440 tons weekly. May 1. against
233,339 April 1, shows practically no change, ex
cepting the increase oi 855 tons weekly in char
coal iron. Deducting the unsold stocks, which
Increased in April 23.516 tons, the apparent con
sumption in that month was 32.650 tons dally,
against ,?2,359 tons daily during the previous
four months. This general expectation of ex
pending demand holds prices steady for all
finished products of Iron and steel, and at con
siderable less of Bessemer pig: it is 10 cents
higher at Pittsburg. with other quotations
there, at Chicago and at Philadelphia prac
tically unchanged. Government orders are
heavy and yet cover but little of the con
sumption, though they go far to cause the
overcrowding of shipyards and plate mills, but
higher prices for wheat have Drought enor
mous demand for agricultural implements and
also for locomotives and cars. while very
many buildings in Western towns and orders
for many railroad and other bridges, for canal
Improvements at Chicago and for 25.i>00 tons
eteel rails at the East, make up a heavy vol
ume.
Money Is easier since the policy of contrac
tion has ceased, and only Â«L 700 .000 went to the
interior during the week, while the new loans
of the chief banks averaged 45 per cent of the
total to commercial interests as against 25 per
cent one week ago and 15 per cent two weeks
ago, with rates much lower than were quite
recently refused. The Government is paying
gold over the counter largely, because It needs
notes more than coin, and $7,000,000 gold has
been ordered during the week, 12,500,000 from
Australia, making J78.363.350 ordered, of which
about $11,000,000 has yet to come.
Failures for the week of May have been
$2,978,980. against $3,995,894 last year and $4,13*.
271 in 1896; manufacturing, $1,441,275, against
$1,Mfi,536 last year.
Failures for the week have been 24u in the
United States, against 264 last year, and 24 In
Canada, against 31 last year.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week |
there have been three arrivals from Washing
ton with 9100 tons of coal; three from British
Columbia, 8741 tons; one from Oregon. 600 tons;
one from Baltimore. 1600 tons; one from Aus
â¢ tralia, 1556 tons; total 21.697 tons. The de- <
' liveries are somewhat below, the amounts we j
have consumed, as our reserve is being re- :
duced by the coaling of the navy, and within
the next ten days several large steamers will
replenish their fuel prior to starting for Ma
! nila, hence our stocks In yard will become ma-
I terially diminished- by June' 1. Prices are not i
disturbed this week, ruling about the same as
last week; domestic grades remain unchanged. ,
If the Government should charter several more
of- our â¢ large steamers to send away from the |
Coast, it would naturally cause an advance in ,
coal freights from the North, which of course ;
! would be added to the present selling prices. ,
Furthermore, if Admiral Dewey's fleet should ;
( be retained at Manila for four to six months
(which is more than probable), the shipments <â 
j of coal from here must be large, and prices '
i must advance. There is considerable guess
: work attached to the shape that coal may as- j
: sume during 1898: higiÂ» prices are assured, no ',
j cheap foreign fuel can . reach us, as we have j
! no return wheat freights to offer. Coal freights |
j from Australia have advanced 4 shillings per
ton within thirty days."

HUSBAND
A Young Wife's Suit
for Divorce Is the
Cause.
Fred Reinhart Feels a
Bullet Graze His
Ear.
Mrs. Cuppers' Story of a Life
of Misery and Ro
mance.
IS NOT SEEKING RICHES.
Her Irate Husband Believes Ho Is
Discarded for a Wealthy
Rival.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 13.
Fred Reinhart had a marvelous escape
last night from a bullet fired by a jealous
husband. The missile gTazed his ear and
passed through his hair, and Henry Cup
pers, who fired the shot, made his escape.
He acknowledged to-day that he had
shot "his man" in the leg, but to-night
he cannot be found. He declares his
pretty wife wants to reject him to marry
a man worth $15,000.
Mrs. Cuppers is a very attractive young
woman. She has" been married six years
and is but 23 years old. For the past
three years she has been living apart
from her husband, of whom she lives in
great fear. The trouble of last night was
the result of Mrs. Cuppers bringing a suit
for divorce.
The divorce case has aroused much in
terest on account of the story given out
by Cuppers that his wife had run away
from him to marry a man who had (15,000.
The suit was filed by Attorney C. G.
I>odge a few days ago on behalf of Mrs.
Cuppers. She states that her husband
cc-s.-rted her and her little child more
than two years ago and has not since
contributed one cent to their support.
Mrs. Cuppers has during this time
worked steadily at any kind of day labor
she could obtain and has done well. Her
child is now an invalid in a San Francisco
homo-, and the mother is working in this
city and boarding with a Mrs. Donovan
at Lorin.
Cuppers has been employed in a sa
loon at Lafayette, in Contra Costa Coun
ty, and was served with the papers yes
terday. When he read the story in the
complaint he at once started for Oak
land on the warpath. He met his wife on
a public street and there was a scene.
Cuppers was angry, and when she saw
that a quarrel was imminent and a crowd
was gathering Mrs. Cuppers withdrew.
The papers in the suit were served on
Cuppers by a man named Lamb, and this
morning Lamb met Cuppers in Oakland.
Cuppers volunteered the information that
he met his rival for his wife's affections
last night and that he had put a shot into
his leg. Lamb communicated this in
formation to Mrs. Cuppers' attorney.
Cuppers could not be f'>und this evening,
but it la believed he has returned to his
work at Lafayette.
"I walked down Washington street last
night after I finished my work." said Mrs.
Cuppers to-night, 'and just as I reached
Seventh street 1 suw my husband In a
buggy. He jumped out anf. came up to
me with a paper in his hand. 'Did you
swear to this complaint?' -he asked.
"I toid him I "knew nothing about it. He
then tried to get me to tell him who my
lawyer was. I told him that that was
for me to know. After that I refused
to talk to him. He left and I took the
car for home. When I reached here it
was about half past S. I went in the
house and Mrs. Donovan started to take
her husband's dinner to him. As she
stepped out of the door Fred Reinhart
said to her, 'I am shot.' She asked in
alarm, 'What do you mean, Fred'" He
replied: 'That fellow has shot me,' re
ferring to Mr. Cuppers. 'Feel my faco
and head. The bullet either cut my face
or grazed so closely that it felt that
way.'
"She examined his head, but there were
no marks upon his face anywhere. Cup-
Eors disappeared and Reinhart soon went
ome. 1 have not Been him since, and do
not know what course he will pursue. I
know he is very adrerse to publicity, ow
ing to his people, and it may be that he
will do nothing unless Cunpers comes
back.
"We were married six years ago. Cup
per had three wives before, but I only
knew one of them. He is about 47 years
of age. He was at one time a trainer of
Max Fenner, the pugilist. Later he ran
the Sea.l Rock saloon. Kearny street, In
Ban Francisco. He always carried a re
volver and called it his 'brother.' He
said he might have need for it some time.
He used it in Ban Francisco once on a
policeman.
"My mother was at our house once
â¢when he threatened to kill me. She wor
ried over that and his treatment of me
until it resulted in the breaking of a blood
vessel, which caused her death two
years ago last December. The last time
she was at the house he threatened to
throw her out of the window if she ever
returned. Some time in January, Cuppers
sold all of the furniture and we went to
my father's house. ( ' March 17, two
years ago, he left me â Â£? we have never
lived together since, b.ace then I have
worked for my living, and almost all of
that time I have lived with Mrs. Dono
van, with whom I am now stopping.
"Cuppers has no funds to contest my
suit, and he thinks he will do all the
harm he can by talking about me.
"He once attempted to shoot me In the
Presence of Mrs. Donovan, who caught
im by the shoulder and pulled him
away. All I am afraid of now Is that he
will yet wroak his vengeance upon me.
He accuses me of trying to get a divorce
to marry Reinhart. If that had cut any
npuro I should have done It long ago. I
One venture of this kind is enough. I am I
willing to live single now the rest of my j
life."
TWO BAD MEN
FROM AUSTRALIA
J. Middleton and Stewart Bates
Are Locked Up on a Charge
of Vagrancy.
They Arc Accused of Plotting to
Drug and Rob a Stranger From
Guatemala..
â¢T. Middleton and Stewart Bates two re
cent arrivals from Australia, were booked
at the City Prison yesterday morning by
Detectives Gibson. Wren and Dinar, on a
charge of vagrancy. They \ narrowly
missed being charged with a more seri
ous offense.
iÂ« F t^ d Bye ?', a mlner from Guatemala,
IB the complaining witness against them,
and according to the story he told the po
lice he credits himself with some detec
tive ability. He said he was standing on
the corner -of Market and Kearny streets
Wednesday reading the war bulletins
when Mlddleton accosted him. They talk
to\,k hh r im nndÂ«n t d Â« m hÂ« ln f?^ d ' "pally^Middleton
iook jura to tne ferry, where he was in
troduced to Bates. Then they talked
horoe racing, an l Middleton got $10 out of
him to bet on the races. They met the
following day, and Bycra. to find ; out
what sort of men Middleton and Bates
were, told them that he had a friend,
Joseph Bargion, stopping with him at the
Empire lodging house on Commercial
street, near Kearny, who had $2000. They
snapped at the bait and said if Byers
would help them to get the money they
could all go to the Klondike. They sug
g#*ted a plan that Byers should get Bar
gion to go with him to a saloon, and after
they got him drunk they would give him
some knockout drops. Mlddleton left to
buy the drops and a bottle of rum, and
Byers instructed Bargion to notify the
police.
Bargion went to police headquarters and
told his story to Captain Seymour and
Gibson, Wren and Dinan were detailed
on the case. They arrested Middleton
and Bates in front of the lodging house,
and when Middleton was searched the
bottle of rum and a small bottle jof
knockout drops were found in his pocket.
A package of red pepper was found in
Bates' pocket.
A KLONDIKE TBIP.
Passengers Awarded Damages for
Breach of Contract and Then
Lost on a Technicality.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals yesterday reversed the decision of
the lower court in the case of Gaston Ja
cobi and others vs. Joel P. Geer and
others.
The action was brought against Geer as
claimant of the steamboat Eugene by
waiter M. Cary, Fred M. Lyons and Ed
ward J. Knight as interveuors, they al
leging a breach of contract to carry them
selves and baggage to Dawson City. The
agreement was made with the Portland
ami Alaska Trading and Transportation
Company to take the steamer Eugene in
tow of the Bristol and convey the pas
sengers' to St. Michael, from which point
the Eugene was to convey them up the
Yukon River to Dawson City. Instead of
doing so th?y were abandoned on the
coast of Alaska and were obliged to land
at Victoria For this breach of contract
they claimed $1000 damages each.
The lower court allowed them judgment
against the Eugene for $SOO each. The
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this
judgment on the ground that tne libel
lants failed to show that the Eugene ha 1
contracted to take the complainants from
Seattle to Dawson. AM that they showed
was that the contract was from St.
Michael to Dawson. But the Eugene
never entered upon the performance of
that undertaking, and did not take on
board either the passengers or their bag
gage. _
SHOULD RACING
BE FOR CHARITY?
Rev. Dr. Stebbins Opposes
Fabiola Day at the
Track.
Says the Relief of Human Sorrow
Should Not Be by
Gambling.
The war among the ministers over the
proposed "Fabriola day" to-day still goes
on.
Rev. Horatio Stebbins opposes Fabiola
day at the race track, and in the follow
ing open letter he takes exception to the
stand taken by Rabbi M. S. Levy, who
favors the work of the hospital and who
believes in charity from every source:
Rabbi M. S. Levy- My Dear Sir: A public
note by you. addressed to the Oakland Tribune
and copied into The Call of this date. Is my
Justification for addressing you thus.
Your honest purpose, dear sir, is to Justify
anil approve the course of the managers of a
humane institution In supporting the charity
entrusted to their care by the income of a
horse race. Do you not miss the whole ques
tion when you slip from the gambling saddle
and the betting- po^l to the praise of the noble
women of Oakland and the tender pities of the
hospital? Those women need no praise, and
the hospital stands In the open light of day
for the relief of human sorrow and pain. The
real question is: Should It be supported by
gambling? the nest of all vices, from lying,
to crooked money and suicide. Is gambling Im
moral? Was the Government wrong when it
drove out the lottery from Louisiana? Are j
the police force right when they raid the j
fan-tan games? Are Institutions dedicated to
humane beneficence to sanction gambling un- :
der the name nf chanty? If so, let us bring up
oar sons and daughters to the benevolent work, j
Instead of teaching thÂ»m to cheerfully and
gladly share their substance for the relief of
the pain and misfortune of the world.
And you and I, dear sir. devoted as we are.
or ought to be, to the true, the beautiful and
the good, let us get "Inside" and learn the
tricks of loaded dice and "gamboged" horses.
Why, wp could get more money so in a month j
than we can earn in a year! The treasury of '
the synagogue would overflow, and I am sure
that your generous, philanthropic mind would
lead you to give a part of it to me. Therefore, j
if institutions devoted to humane enterprise
are to be supported by gambling, condemned
alike by good morals and good laws, let you
and I be awake to the new opportunity.
But not so, wisdom, right, reason, truth and '
common sense! Very respectfully
HORATIO STEBBINS.

A RINGER AT THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Although there have been "ringers" In almost every form of sport un
der the sun, the game of handball seems to have been exempt from such
practices until lately, when there appeared on the scene in this city a per
sonage who has upset the programme. Some time ago a fine-looking gen
tleman, apparently a Spaniard, visited the various handball courts and
evinced a deep interest in the game. He was introduced as Pierre Eli
zalde to such local celebrities in the handball world as License Collector
Bonnet and James C. Nealon. by his interpreter, who invariably accompa
nied him. The latter explained that his master was a native of Basque,
France, was here on pleasure bent, and that while he had been sojourn-
Ing in Buenos Ayres he had become quite proficient in a game similar to
our American handball; but that a wooden bat was used by the player In
stead of the hands. It was more on the style of racquet ball, and when
the handsome foreigner, who had inspired much veneration among his new
formed acquaintances, was asked to join in a game of handball, he po
litely declined, but said, through his interpreter, that he would like to pit
himself against any two men, they to use their hands, and he would use a
wooden bat, just, as the interpreter put it, "to equalize matters."
James Nealon was inveigled into playing a game and induced his friend,
"Jack" Bonnet, to be his partner. Then the interpreter explained that his
employer was quite willing to add interest to the contest by putting up,
say ?200. Bonnet absolutely refused to risk any money, saying that he was
an amateur, but Nealon, thinking that he and "Jack" had a "cinch" a*id
that the foreigner had no chance whatever, offered to put up $50, and the
other $25 was gathered from several other sports who had seen EHzalde
play with Luke White, a mediocre exponent of the game, who had "put it
all over him." The game was to bo the best three out of four and play
began. The Frenchman lost the first game, and Nealon already saw him
self possessor of the former's fifty, and was inwardly chuckling. But the
end had not come and the next three games the foreigner gave such an
exhibition of handball playing, aided by his wooden bat, as has never
been witnessed before in this vicinity. When he had the game well in hand
and had Nealon and Bonnet "going," he literally played with the ball. lie
performed acrobatic feats, often hitting the little rubber sphere with his
syeÃ shut, and, in a word, he outclassed our two local champions at every
stage of the game.
They were simply "out of it" and the Frenchman took down the
money much to the chagrin of Nealon, who now says: "I didn't moinhd
the fifty so much, but Oi hate to be done up by a measly Spanish ephoy,
for I'll bet another fifty that's what he is."
It has been ascertained that Pierre EHzalde is the champion racquet
ball player of the world; but further than that his Identity Is unknown
and the passing of Nealon's fifty Is the topic of conversation in the hand
ball courts.

have a care about what they publish
or soldiers will be sent to smash every
thing In their offices. Editors of ob
noxious papers will be sent without
trial to Fernando Po, a penal station
on the coast of Equatorial West Af
rica.
In view of a probable revolution on
the next news of disaster, the Liberals
and Conservatives have promised the
Queen to support a dictatorial military
Cabinet under Marshal Campos, should
events demand it.
The political plan agreed upon, with
the Queen's assent, between Premier
Sagasta, Marshal Campos, Senor Sil
veia, the Conservative leader, and
Senor Montero y Rios, the president
of the Chamber of Deputies, is this:
As soon as the Cortes passes the bills
providing extraordinary revenues for
the war. Premier Sagasta will notify
the presidents of the two houses â Senor
Montero y Rios, of the Chamber of
Deputies, and Marquis Araijo, of tb,e
Senate, and ask them to suspend the
sittings indefinitely, or until a new
Cabinet has been organized.
Then for form's sake, the Queen Re
gent will consult the leading statesmen
and General Rios and the Presidents of
the Cortes. They have agreed to advise
her to retain Senor Sagasta as Premier,
but if he should fail to organize a Min
istry to instruct Senor Montero to ar
range a temporary administration to
prosecute the war.
If both Sagasta and Montero should
fail to find Liberal statesmen patri
otic enough to take office the Queen
will turn to Senor Silvela and ask him
to organize a Ministry to Include Mar
shal Campos and other generals as a
military reserve to keep the extreme
parties at bay. Should any reverse in
the war or a revolutionary movement
put the dynasty in danger then the mil
itary dictatorship is to be resorted to.
A dispatch to the World from Lon
don says: A Madrid dispatch reports
bread riots at Colamar, in which wo
men stormed the Octroi stations. The
riots continue in Logroni. Rich people
in Madrid and elsewhere_are trying to
allay the popular discontent by giving
alms and subscribing to relief funds.
MADRID, May 13.â The chief event
of the Cortes to-day was the question
ing of Senor Bores, who held a high
post in the Philippines for two years,
about the new risings at Panas, Cebu
and Manila. He gave evidence drawn
from the statements of passengers re
cently arrived and from private letters
received at Madrid.
Lieutenant General Correa, Minister
of War, contended, in reply, that the
risings arose from American incite
ments.
Senor Bores pointed out that he
referred to to those which began early
in April, before there was any idea of
war with the United States.
The main point in Senor Bores' state
ment, however, was the terrible con
dition of the Spanish troops at Ma
nila, between the double lire of the
Americans and the natives. This made
a great sensation.
Senor Molinas, deputy for Porto Rico,
protested against the bombardment of
San Juan, without notice, as an in
fringement of international usages. To
this General Correa replied that the
conduct of the Americans was "vandal
ism," and that the Government will
bring their outrageous action under
the notice of the powers. He echoed
Senator Molinas' eulogy on the bravery
of the Spanish troops and marines, and
promised that the Government would
send its thanks. In the Senate similar
observations were made.
SERIOUS STATE OF
THE ITALIAN RIOTS.
News Has Been Received of Fresh
Conflicts Between Peasants and
Military.
VIENNA, May 13. â News has been
received of fresh conflicts between the
peasants and military outside Milan.
The reports from Luino show that the
rioting there was more serious than at
first reported. The Duke and Duchess
of Saxe-Meiningen had a very narrow
escape from violence at the hands of
the mob and the pavement was cov
ered with dead and dying after the
customs officials fired at Pisa.
Three thousand petroleuses took
part in the riots at Leghorn. The riot
ers soaked the doors of the churches
with petroleum, intending to fire them,
but the troops frustrated the plot. It
is reported that the Government in
tends to call out 100,000 men in the Mi
lanese district. Milan is already held
by a large force, but the court-mar
tials there have given fresh proof of
the organized nature of the rioters.

TORPEDO WAS
LOADED WELL
Won the Opening Race
at Oakland at Odds
of 100 to 1.
Red Bird, Another 100 to 1
Shot, Finished a Close
Second.
Threes Favorites Met "With Defeat.
Lady Ashley Landed Cleverly.
Flandes Took *Â» Pur3e.
The opening race at Oakland yesterday
furnished a rarety In the racing line.
Torpedo, a son of Racine, with Gus Wil
son on his back and a 100 to 1 chance in
the betting, finished a scant length in
front of Red Bird, against which 100 to 1
was also laid. A rapacious set of specu
lators grabbed at all sorts of tips looking
for an outsider's victory, but very few
got aboard the two despised ones. It
was a cheap five and a half furlong
sprint, and the Montana horse. Loch
Ness, was sent to the post a 7 to 10 favor
ite, but failed utterly to exhibit any
speed. After the race, "I told you so"
yarns were much more plentiful than
holders of tickets on the winner.
The slight showers of rain had no per
ceptible effect on the track, for fast time
was hung out after two or three of the
events. Of the six favorites, Mallakwa,
Hurly Burly and La Goleta proved the
successful ones.
H. L. Frank, the wealthy Montana turf
man, furnished another favorite in the
live furlong scramble, in the richly bred
Bitter Root. The big colt found the dis
tance too short, and after getting away
from the p<jst slowly finished in third
place. The 30 to 1 chance, Tiny P, tip
toed out in the lead to the stretch, where
Clawson moved up with the second
choice. Lady Ashley, downing the out
sider with ease.
At his third attempt, Owner Frank was
more successful. The Inverness colt,
Mailakwa. was among the eleven start
ers in the four furlong spin for two-year
olds, and a raft of coin forced his odds
down from twos to 7to 5. Piggott took
no chances, and hustling the heavily
played one to the front, led all the way
ana won galloping from Faversham in
The seven furlong run, decided under
selling conditions, was somewhat in the
nature of a cakewalk for the favorito,
Hurly Burly, ridden by Clawson. ThÂ»
Clly made ail the running and won easily
by three lengths. In a hard drive Pig
gott, on San Mateo, took the place from
Klsmore by a nose. San Venado and
Morinel ran disappointingly.
In the mile selling run La Goleta hook
ed up with a bunch she outclassed bad
lj . and at odds of 3 to 5 had merely to
gallop to beat Chappie and Don Luis,
which pair finished second and third re
spectively.
The stable folks thought well of Flandes
in the last event, a six furlong sprint,
and backed him to down the even money
choice. Imp. Missioner. The "tip" went
the rounds and Flandes went to the post
a piping hot second choice. .Thorpe had
the leg up on the latter, and in a fierce
drive the last eighth of a mile, got the
decision from the favorite by a neck.
Formella ran around her field, getting
the show.

ltes yesterday, and but one of them â Mal
lakwaâmanaged to get to the wire In
front. The Montana turfman sent a big
commission into the ring on the latter.
Martillo opened up favorite for the
maiden two-year-old event, but receded
in the betting and ran a most disappoint
ing race. The winner, Mallakwa, on his
showing was well worth the support ac
corded him.
"Daggie" Smith, the owner of Torpedo,
did not think very highly of the gelding's
chances, and bet but $10 on him to show,
getting 15 to 1.
The finish for the place between San
Mateo and Elsmore in the fourth race was
a very close thing, and could have been
given to either horse without causing any
great amount of dissension.
San Venado will do to have a bet on
next time he starts. The colt was started
"short" yesterday, which, no doubt, ac
counted for the accommodating manners
of some of the layers of odds. He ran
under restraint to the head of the stretch
and then "blew up."
One fortunate speculator from the San
Francisco side managed to string $o three
ways on Torpedo, and created quite a sen
sation when cashing his tickets, the wise
ones looking on him as a. freak of nature.
Jockey Dick Clawson seems to be the
one to follow these days. Dick was again
on top yesterday with three winners. Pig
got rode in hard luck, getting past the
wire in front but once.

CALIFORNIA COMMANDERY
CALIFORNIA COMMANDER? en
tertained the guests at the Masonic
Festival last night, and right roy
ally it entertained. It was decided
long prior tb the opening of the festival
that California Commandery must take
it upon Itself to furnish the entertainment
for at least one night, and Mrs. J. F. Lo
gan Mrs. Gua Dorn and Mrs. Alfred Bat
kin the executive committee of the com
mandery. promptly responded and took
the matter in hand. The features of the
evening's entertainment were exhibition
drills by the drilll corps of California
Commandery No 1. Knights Templar, R.
P. Hurlbut commanding, and the Ladies
California Drill Corps.
The ladies' corps was beautifully dis
ciplined and prettily uniformed. Blue
suits chevroned with white and having
gaiters to match completed the uniform.
Shortly after 9 o'clock, to the tune of
"The Festival March," composed by G.
W. Bennett, leader of the fete band, the
corps made its appoarance. With the
precision of machinery the ladies
marched. Each carried a silken flag in
place of a saber or more formidable im
plement of war. and at each command a
wave of red. white and blue, unbroken
by any strangling hand, moved gayly
through the calcium-light tinted air. The
drill was not long, but it proved the pro
ficiency of the participants and their
superiority over the drill corps of the
Knights Templar. The various move
ments of the Knights in drill was little
less than perfect, but with the saber they
did not equal the ladies with their flags.
The drill of the rival corps concluded,
the members and friends of California
Coqjmandery were entertained at the
handsomely decorated booth of that com
mandery.
A multitude that crowded the big hall
from floor to gallery was present last
evening to witness the drilling and enjoy
the various features of the programme
Many who went to the festival to hear
General W. EL L. Barnes speak, however,
left disappointed, as the orator did not
respond to the call of his name. Why
General Barnes failed to make his ap
pearance was not known by the manage
ment, and it regretted, as did many
others, his absence. The music was se
lect and the march composed for Cali
fornia Commander}' night by Mr. Ben
nett called for considerable comment. The
selection is without doubt striking and
will live when the festival exists only as
a memory.
To-night will be the biggest night of
the festival. Besides the fact that it will
see the close of a successful fete inaug
urated in the cause of charityâ the most
laudable cause in Christendom â it will be
"ratfle night." Thousands of valuable
articles, everything: from a piano down
to a pincushion, will pass from the festi
val into now unknown hands. A Klon
dike outfit valued at $1000 Is one of the
most coveted prizes, but many more
equally valuable to him who prefers a
IN LINE FOR THE PATRIOTIC DRILL
BAD HALF DOLLARS.
An Italian Fish Peddler Working Off
a Remarkably Clever and Dan
gerous Counterfeit.
O. Delehiro, a fish and vegetable ped
dler, passed a counterfeit half dollar yes
terday on a woman who keeps a cigar
stand at the corner of Jackson and Mont
gomery streets. He bought two 5-cent
cigars and tendered a haif dollars in pay
ment, receiving 40 cents in change. Later
in the day he returned and repeated the
transaction. The woman objected to the
piece, because it was light weight, and

at 102 Clark street. When searched at
the station two bad half dollars were
found in his pockets and another in his

cept they were light, they having the ring
and color of silver coins. They are a
mixture of silver and some alloy and
would require an expert to distinguish
them from the genuine.

TO TRY "JOLLY'S" STRENGTH.
Two Hundred Men Will Have a Tug
of-War With an Elephant.
One of the most extraordinary contests
of strength ever given anywhere will be
pulled off at the Chutes to-morrow after
noon when "Jolly," the big elephant, will
engage in a tug of war with 200 men. It
will be a new experience for the men,
but an old one for "Jolly." Two years
ago he pulled against 150 firemen at the
Madison Square Gardens. New York, and
was awarded the decision, and the year
before that, at a policemen's fete in Re
gent's Park, he bested 100 of London's
strongest patrolmen. The tug-of-war will
be repeated Sunday evening.
For Alaska's Trade.
Since the affairs of the old Alaska Trade
Committee have been in the hands of
the State Board of Trade, Manager J. A.
Filcher has had several lively men in the
field soliciting subscriptions for carrying
on the work of advertising the fact that
this city is the best on the coast for out
lining for the gold fields of the north.
His men have met with very good suc
cess, thus enabling Mr. Filcher to send
to all parts of the country information
such as prospective Klondikers want.
For a time the canvassers were not as
successful as they are now. The reason
was that all whom they approached
stated that they would not give a cent
unless a certain storekeeper near the city
front also contributed to the work. They
held that he was getting the cream of
the trade and still not paying a cent.
THE SAIN" FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAT 14, 1898.
I set the prizes and with the close of the
festival they will spread to homes touched
by the seven winds.
Next Saturday anew supply of money
will be added to the fund of the associa
tion. The Baldwin Theater will give a
matinee and the total proceeds will go to
help build the home for the suffering
widows and orphans. The offer of the
management of the theater is a generous
one. Not one cent of the expense of pro
ducing | the entertainment, which is not
small, will have to be borne by the
Masons, and in the evening after the
spectators have left the theater the re
ceipts will be handed over to the commit
tee that is to see to the building of the
home. The Masons expect to realize a
large sum of money from this source, and
this added to the sum taken in at the
fete will without doubt be sufficient to
fulfill their object. "We could close our
doors to-night," said a prominent Mason
last evening, "and between $25,000 and $30,
000 will be in our coffers. When the fete
is closed and the curtain has rung down
at the Baldwin all that remains is to
complete the building, as we will have the
money with which to pay for it."
Owing to the fact that to-night Is the
closing night a special effort has been
made by the management to complete an
entertaining programme. A naval drill
and the pigeon dance are the features of
the evening, and as the bell tolls the dy-
I ing minutes of the merry fete ten thou
sand voices, or perhaps more, will sing
one song, and the days it lived will be
numbered with those of the dead past.

MISS RAYMOND IS TRUE.
Prefers a Black-Face Artist to a
Wealthy Stock Broker.
Rumor was busy last night in regard to
a forthcoming marriage between the
handsome, dashing vocalist. Miss I,izzie
Raymond, and Mr. Montgomery of Mont
gomery & Stone, the black face team.
Miss Raymond, who closes an engage
ment in this city to-morrow evening, was
asked about her marriage, and said:
"I am not married to Mr. Montgom
ery."
"Do you intend to marry him?"
"I certainly do, as I am engaged to
him," was the reply. "I shall soon go
East to marry him. He opens in St.
Louis Sunday evening. I told him when
he left here not to worry, as I would
surely keep my word, notwithstanding
the persistent offer of marriage from :%.
wealthy Boston stock broker, who I find
is rated 'way up in G' by Bradstreet. I
know that with Montgomery the course
of true love will run smooth, and hence it
is all off with the broker."
"What is the broker's name?"
"I shall not tell you, as I do not wish
to wound his generous heart. It's lovo
that I want, not money, and I know that
Montgomery loves me dearly."

ASSAULTED
BY THE MAN
SHE LOVED
Etta Murray, a Young
Woman, Danger
ously 111.
Attacked by Mike Valve
and Seriously In
jured.
Her Assailant, Fearing Arrest,
Quietly Leaves the
City.
THE POLICE ARE NOTIFIED
Threatened to Kill Her If She Told
Her Parents of His
Crime.
Etta Mm-ray, an attractive young
woman, Is lying- dangerous 111 at her
mother's home, 604 Third street. Last
Tuesday night, she claims, she was as
saulted by Mike Valve, a. young man
with whom she had kept company.
According to her story Valve entered
her home during the temporary ab
sence of her mother and assaulted her.
She screamed for help, but her alleged
assailant placed his hand over her
mouth and threatened to kill her if she
continued to make an outcry. After he
had accomplished his design he left the
house after threatening to return a.nd
make her a subject for the Coroner if
she informed her mother.
When the latter returned several
hours, later she found her daughter ly
ing on the floor in a semi-conscious
condition. She at once sent for a doc
tor, who after considerable trouble suc
ceeded in reviving the injured girl. Af
ter regaining consciousness she told her
mother what had transpired.
Mrs. Murray lost no time in notifying
the police, and two detectives were sent
to make an investigation. They ob
tained the story of the girl, and at
once started out to find her allege! as
sailant. They visited his residence on
Broadway but were unable to find him.
An examination of his room disclosed
that he had taken his clothes.
Last nlerht the detectives learned that
Valve, evidently fearing: arrest, had left
the city. He was traced to Stockton,
and Sheriff Cunningham of that place
was notified by telegraph to arrest him. â 
Cunningham, after making 1 an investi
gation, telegraphed back to Chief Lees
that Valve had left that city.
A description of him has been pent
to the various Sheriffs throughout the
country and every effort will be made
to arrest him.
Late last nigrht it was reported that
the frirl was in a dyinjr condition and
could not possibly recover. Her mother
is heartbroken over the condition of the
unfortunate girl and is determined to
prosecute Valve to the bitter end In
case he is arrested. She was aware that
he was in the habit of oallinc on her
dauerht^r. hut thinking that he intend
ed to make her his wife she offered no
objection. He evidently knew that
Mrs. Murray was absent when he en
tered her house Tuesday nleht. After
ealnine an entrance, it is claimed, he
struck his unsuspecting victim, felling
her to the floor, before accomplishing
his base dÂ» c iern.
The police are determined to make
Valve suffer for his heinous crime and
will do all In their power to apprehend
him.
KOSTER STAYED AWAY.
An Evening's Sport Spoiled by the
Mission Pugilist Not Appearing
to Fight Lynch.
About five hundred disappointed sport*
filled the gymnasium of the Excelsior
Athletic Club last night, watching two
wild-eyed colored "dubs" wave their
hands at each other until one fell to the
floor in a hypnotized condition.
The event that crowded the clubroom
was an eight-round go between Tom
Lynch of the Excelsiors and Ous Koster
of the Manhattan*, At the last moment
Koster "crawfished," as one sport put it,
and the go waa called off. To satisfy
the gore-loving followers of the squared
circle the management substituted Henry
Lewis and young Peter Jackson, two
dusky "dubs." As was expected, Lewis
went to the floor to save a beating, while
the crowd wondered why he stayed that
length of time. Jackson was a power
ful fellow, with as much knowledge of
boxing as a Spaniard has of fighting.
Lewis, on the other hand, had some
knowledge of the game, but is totally
devoid of courage. With two such men
in the ring the crowd simply lay back
and yawned, waiting for the bout to be
over. It came in the fourth round and
no onÂ© felt sorry.
The events that preceded the farce were
Interesting and partly made up for the
rank go. "Deacon" Jones and "Clown"
Wiley created merriment at the start by
their mode of sparring. Devlne and Mc-
Deavltt also boxed three laughable
rounds, while Jimmy Lawler and Jimmy
Rlelly, Craig and Lynch, O'Brien and
Kane boxed interesting rounds. Will Sul
livan contortioned and Mr. Casey warbled
the Wabash so realistically that the
spectators nearly drowned him with ap
plause. He then gave a pathetic reci
tation about an Indian who deserted his
love in the far West. His gestures were
a left lead for the stomach with right
hand in pocket: sometimes changing to
a right cross for variety. â¢ Casey was so
enraptured with his own voice that he
forgot his lines, and had to retire amid
tumultoua applause. Lynch and Ken
nedy then boxed four lively rounds.
In announcing the absence of Koster
President Kennedy charged Ale 6 Greg
gains with trying to put his club on the
"bum" because they were getting pros
perous. He defied the referee in the
Sharkey-Joffrios bout and all his "push"
to injure the Excelsiors, and then an
nounced another bout, which wilt tak*
place at the clubrooms in a few weeks.

Endeavorers and the War.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee of Golden Gate Union last night the
lookout committee reported that it had
arranged for a farewell service to be held
at the Presidio Sunday morning at 11
o'clock. Addresses will be made by vet
eran chaplains and music will be fur
nished by the Presidio band. It has also
been ascertained that the State Endeav

Bitten by a Spider.
Oliver Reese, living at 768 Greenwich
street, was bitten by a spider several
days ago. Ha paid no attention to the
bite until last night, when his left arm
began to swell. At the advice of a friend
he visited the Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Tormey after an examination, de
clared that he was suffering from blood
poisoning. It is not unlikely that the un
fortunate man will lose his arm as the
result of the deadly bite.
Reese told the doctor that he was en
gaged in making some repairs about his
home when the Insect bit him. He felt
a stinging pain In his arm, but thinking
it would pass away, he paid little atten
tion to It.
GORTER THROWN IN JAIL.
The Inventor of the Water Tower
Charged With Defrauding A. S.
Paree.
W. H. Gorther, the inventor of the
water tower that is in use in the Fire
Department, was arrested last night on
a warrant from Police Court 4 charging
him with a violation of the State law
relative to leaving the State with intent
to defraud his creditors.
The complaining witness is A. S. Paree,
a ciVil engineer. Some time ago Paree
sued Gorter for preparing the plans of
the water tower and was awarded $250 by
a jury in Judge Hunt's court. Gorter, it
is claimed, refused to pay the judgment,
and Paree. learning that he wast about
to leave for Alaska last night, visited
police headquarters and swore out a war
rant for his arrest. Gorter denied that he
owed Paree any money, and threatened
to make it interesting for him after his
case is disposed of.

Attorney-
MARTINEZ. May 13.â Charles R. Jones,
well known In Martinez, Crockett and

Brown has not seen man' nor money.
Cheaper Electric Power.
MARYSVILLE. May 13.â An experiment
concluded here by Dr. F. A. C. Perrine of
Stanford University utilizing the electri
cal power line of the Yuba Power Com
pany from its power house to Browns
Valley, a distance of ten miles, demon
strated that 36,000 volts may be transmit
ted over a copper wire, using glass insu
lation, against sixteen thousand, which
has been the maximum in power trans
mission heretofore. The result of the ex
periment will be to effect a saving of half
in the cost of wire in the construction of
electrical transmission plants in the fu
ture. As it is now the cost of wire is
about half the entire cost of the plant.
