CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aver. 16.â This was the first
day of the Democratic State Conven
tion, and It has also been a red letter
day in the lives of certain politicians
who hail from the metropolis.
The internal fires that have for
months stirred the Democratic party
and have threatened an eruption that
"Would disrupt the entire Democratic
organization in the Stat^ came very
â near the surface to-day, and for a time
it seemed as if the threatened catas
trophe could not be averted. As it was
there were grave mutterings and
.: rumblfngs. a great emission of oratori
cal smoke and a little flame that ;
scorched some of the gentlemen who
are mainly responsible for the condi
' -lions that now exist in the party.
As has always )>een stated in these ]
dispatches, the present Democraticcon- ,
>:Vention presents conditions peculiar to
.itself â conditions that have iilled the
hearts of the old-time war-horses of
.: the party with amazement, and which
' TV ill no doubt result in making a very
interesting chapter in the history of
the party. The aspirations of candi
dates are only a seconda-y considera
â¢ lion, and even at that are nassed over
with a notice so slight as to give the
, lie to the historic greed of politicians,
and particularly Democratic politicians, j
â¢for office.
: The subject of initial Interest has'
from the first been the contest between â 
ti.e two delegations, each claiming to (
" tepr.cs>*: ; racy of San Fran- |
:.c:sco.
' .Delegates fnm Siskivou to San
V Diego have been lined up by either fac
, tion, and it was confidently expected
that to-day would see the inauguration
'.on the floor of the convention of some
â¢ political pyrotechnics worthy of the
â¢ time-honored reputation of the unterri
;fie.d. The fireworks have been set, and
. that they were not touched off for the
: â¢amusement and gratification of some
;'â  hundreds of Sacramento's citizens of
â  both sexes who assembled at the pavil-
ion this afternoon to see the fun, was
d-ue only to a miscarriage of the origin
al plan of the programmers. As it was,
i-b.pth sides marshaled their forces and
prepared for the real contest that is
. scheduled to come off to-morrow morn-
ing, rain or shine.
Aside from the afternoon opening
session, which meant so little to the
uninitiated spectators and so much to
those who can see behind and beyond
the flimsy front of parliamentary Bhow,
the doings of the day were, no doubt,
as interesting and instructive to Demo
crats as they were satisfactory to the
good people of Sacramento, who have
given their time and their money to
make the arrangements for the conven
tion an unqualified success.
'â ' â¢ The arrival of the morning trains
. noticeably augmented the crowd of
politicians who came in Sunday and

tels and eating places and in the lob
bies the crowds of perspiring delegates.
candidates and out-of-datr-s were so
dense as to almost preclude passage
to and fro. Many of the delegations
that had arrived early on the ground
held caucuses in the hotel parlors and
In different meeting halls about the
city, and decided what action they
should take on the principal subjects
that will occupy the attention of the
â¢convention. The aggregate result of
:these caucuses was to show the truth
of what has already been predicted re
. garding the attitude of this convention
The San Francisco Call
concerning the fusion arrangement. It
is certain that the .fusionist agreement
that was entered Into between self-ap
pointed leaders of the Democratic party
and the managers of that memorable
gathering known as the Pinto-Populist
Convention will be ratified by the con
vention when the matter is formally
brought before it.
This is the wish of James G. Maguire
who is now without a rival in his candi
dacy for the gubernatorial nomination
I It being recognized that Maguire is
to be the standard-bearer of the party
during the coming campaign, it is only
natural that his desires regarding such
matters as he believes will have a
material effect upon the success of the
party's candidates at the polls should
be listened to and respected. He,
through his friends, having solicited
and received the gubernatorial nomina
tion at the hands of the aforesaid
Pinto-Populist Convention, is of course
anxious to see the fusion agreement
ratified. It is his wish, and in this
matter at least his wish is to be the
: law.
So it is that those delegates who
come to the convention with the idea
In view of opposing fusion on the broad
grounds of party pride find themselves
in a hopeles minorityâ hopeless, in
fact, that they have ceased to murmur
and will resign themselves to the in
evitable. ,it maybe that here and there
their voices will be raised in protest,;
but the result â â â yrih be the same. Ma
guire without an oppa"*" l * " - " 1 receive
the nomination for Governor, and from
this time on until the Bth day of next
November he will be the guiding spirit.
As has already. been intimated,, little
interest will be manifested in the dis
posal, of the few remaining offices that
the Populists have kindly allotted to
the share of the Democrats. The prin
cipal event of the day as far as the
gubernatorial nomination is concerned
was the withdrawal of ex-Senator J. H.
Seawell from the contest. Since 'he
made, the announcement some time ago
that he was a candidate for the place
at the head of the ticket, he has stead
fastly refused to entertain any proposi
tion for his withdrawal, claiming that
it was his desire to go before this con
vention as a candidate for the nomina
tion for Governor, and that if he could
not secure the nomination he had no
desire to seek for any other office with
in the gift of the people of the State.
This position he maintained until this
morning, when he succumbed to the
solicitation of . Maguire's friends and
made public the announcement that he
would not allow his name to be pre
sented to the convention as an aspirant
for the leading place on the ticket.
It was urged that it must be patent
to every one that the sentiment of the
great majority of tb'i Democratic
voters of the State was in favor of the
nomination of Magnire, and in persist
ing in seeking the nomination for him
self he was doing something that was
utterly contrary to the wishes of the
men of his own party. It was also sug
gested that his failure to withdraw
from the fight might possibly alienate
his friends and supporters from the
cause of the successful nominee, and
that by doing so he would be working
an injury to the party. It was oointed
out to him that while his desire to re
ceive the gubernatorial nomination
was apparently hopeless, he "ni^ht, if he
so wished, secure the nomination for
Attorney General or for Associate Jus
tice of the Supreme Court.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 16.â T0 the Editor of The Call: This is one of the largest and most representa
tive Democratic conventions I have seen in California, and I have been at most nomination State con
ventions since 1572. The personnel of the delegates is very high.
The outcome of this convention, in my Judgment, will be a union or fusion of the Democratic party
with the Silver Republicans and the People's party on Stabe, district and Congressional nominations. In
my Judgment, this convention's action will result in the presentation of strong candidates for office. I look
for the general success of the ticket.
Then? will be a change in the manner of selecting State Central Cpmmitteemen: also in the manner of
giving and voting proxies. This will make the State Central Committee more representative of the differ
ent localities of the State.
Not having any notion that I would be selected as chairman of the convention I had no list of com
mittees prepared, and consequently required each of the contending factions to submit to me a list of names.
From these, with additions, I made my appointments â my desire being to select strictly representative men,
having as little bias as possible in the controversy, and to allow the convention, upon a minority report â
whichever way it may be â to pass on the matter squarely. No matter how this committee may decide, it
is so constituted that there will be both a majority and minority report, as is understood by both sides.

averse to the opportunity of asking the
people to give him a seat on the Su

that he would become a candidate for

luctantly consented to withdraw his
name for the fight for the place at the

CALL HEADQUARTERS, Sacra- j
mento, Aug. 16.â Governor James H.
Budd holds the balance of power in
the DemocraJtJc State Convention and
"Whispering" Gavin McNab has gone
down to defeat.
The man who has for the past few
months held the reins of the Demo
cratic party and who has placed the
whip with a fine disregard of future
results, provided he could compass the
span of his political ambitions, has
been unhorsed in mid career. This was
the day of his Waterloo, and from this
time forward the name of McNab will
cease to be a bugaboo to Democratic
politicians.
The details of McNab's undoing: will
not require long in the tellin*. He
came to Sacramento twenty-four hours
ago armed with a pocketful of proxies
and the prestige of success in stealing
the control of the Democratic party of
San Francisco. With the aid of his
friends in the camp of the reformers,
together with his proxies and the
weight of the fusion agreement he has
succeeded in forcing upon the Demo
cratic party, he boasted of his ability
to capture the organization of the con
vention and run things to suit him
self. To-night he can look back on the
events of the day. marked at every step
by the wrecks of the projects he had
planned. He was forced to surrender
to the man who represent" the bette
element in the Democratic party, and
hi*; was not the hand that prepared the
phtn of the temporary organization. He
was forced to surrender one after an
other every point that he had claimed
for himself and his friends and to-mor
row he will sit in his seat in the con
vention hall a man practically without
power.
The exact method of his banishment,
and banishmnt it is to be, will not be
decided until to-morrow. But the main
fact cannot be changed by anything
within the power of the convention to
do. McNab's downfall began last night
when he failed to induce a majority
of the Los Angeles delegation to name
George S. Patton as the choice of the
southern delegation for the temporary
chairmanship, it having been previ
ously agreed that the choice of the del
egation would be considered the choice
of the convention. Patton is a McNab
man. He was prepared to follow the
dictates of the whispering boss in all
things where it would be necessary to
perfect the latter's title as sole owner
and dictator in chief of the California
Democracy.
Patton was opposed by Isidore Docfc
weiler, a man opposed to the methods j
of the hand-made reformer from San
Francisco. The fight was a bitter one
and was long-drawn out, but at the end
Dockweiler secured the votes of the
majority of the delegates and thus fur
nished the first setback to the McNab
forces â a setback that was to-day
turned into a rout.
The McNab forces having agreed to
abide by the decision of the majority
of the delegationâ an aereement
made at a time when they were confi
dent that they held control of that
bodyâ were placed in a position that
would have been awkward for honest
men. But with the reformers the so
lution appears to be an easy one. This
morning they informed. Mr. Dockweiler
that they would not abide by the
terms of the agreement, and they in
sisted that he resign his claims to the
right of being appointed temporary
chairman of the convention.
McNab further insisted that Mr.
PBICE FIVE CENTS.
Dockweiler resign in favor of Robert
M. Fitzgerald of Oakland, the man who
had first been slated for the chairman
ship, but who was turned down because
of a premature exposure of the scheme.
This Dockweiler refused to do, and de
clared that he would insist on his
rights and. if necessary, would appeal
to the convention. Th^ name of Charles
M. Casein of Santa Cruz was then pro
posed in place of that of Fitzgerald.
But Dockweiler still declined to enter
tain the proposition.
Even had he done so it is doubtful if
McNab would have consented to the
selection of Cassin, as that gentleman,
who was present at the conference,
emphatically declared that were ha
chairman he would not permit either
of these San Francisco delegations a
seat on the floor of the convention hall
until the right of one of the delegations
to be there had been finally determin
ed by the convention.
As this was not what the McNab
people desired they Joined Dockweiler
in striking Cassin's name off the list
of eligibles.
McNab was persistent and Dock
weiler firm, but the Los Angeles man
finally declared that he would surren
der his claim only on one condition,
and that was that an agreement should
be entered into by all parties, includ
ing James G. Maguire, that the chair
manship of the convertlcn be given to
Governor Budd.
Governor Budd has been one of the
bitterest opponents of the high handed
methods of the whispering boss, and
the proposals made by Dockweiler was
declared not to be acceptable. A dead
lock resulted, which continued until
long after the hour named for the call
ing of, the convention to order.
Finding that he was defeated on
every point and that he -would have to
choose between Governor Budd and Mr.
Dockweiler, he finally consented not to
oppose Governor Budd, provided Dock
weiler would step down and out.
This agreement was ratified by Judge
Maguire, and the conference broke up
and repaired to the convention hall,
where the delegates had been swelter
ing in the heat for an hour or more.
Governor Budd was placed in nomina
tion for temporary chairman and was
elected without a dissenting voice.
Here was a victory for the old-liners
and one that McNab confidently ex
pected would be turned to his discom
fiture in the appointment of a commit
tee on credentials made up of men who
were in favor of seating the Harney
delegation as against the delegation ap
pointed by the McNab committee of
one hundred. Events proved that in
this McNab erred. Governor Budd.
while opposed to the manner and meth
od by which the Committee of One
Hundred was brought into existence,
believed that it was his duty to allow
the convention to decide as to the merit
of the claims of the respective delega
tions rather than to take it on himself
to decide the matter by the appoint
ment of the common credentials com
mittee that would of a surety return a
report favoring the seating of the Har
ney delegation.
The Governor's views on this sub
ject are set forth over his own signa
ture in an article published in another

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 16.â ThtÂ» delegates began
to assemble at the Agricultural Pavil
ion an hour before the time appointed
for the meeting in convention. The
first view of the beautifully festooned
Interior of the pavilion was delightful
to the delegates and called forth ex
pressions of admiration. The tempera
ture of the atmosphere inside was
agreeable and very little complaint was
heard.
As one glanced about to see the pic
tures on the platform in the back
ground and study incidentally the
6tory of Democratic statesmen, one was
surprised if not stunned to observe
that the likeness of Grover Cleveland
was not there. George Washington,
quite as big as life, was there. Ste
phen M. White, as large as George
Washington and perhaps twice as
natural, flanked Â»*Â»* Father of Our
Countr> on the left, a. one faced the
audience. Next on the right of Wash
ington was a picture of Governor
Budd, and still further along to the
right near a draped national flag was
the portrait of Colonel William J.
Bryan. All the pictures were framed.
The hour of assembly, which imme
diately precedes the o-ening session of
a convention, is as dear to the politi
cian as the twilight hour is to the poet.
County delegations were reviewed by
old-timers and* comment made as to
the men who were foremost in political
gatherings in the years when the name
of lrwin, Hager, Haight, Farley, Lewis,
Lame, Howard and Pendergast added
luster to the record. It was noted that
John Boggs, W. W. Foote, M. F. Tar
pay and J. Marion Brooks still respond
ed to the rollcall of the faithful.
During the waiting, when nearly all
the delegates had occupied the places
.assigned to them, there arose in the San
Francisco group a form not unlike that
of the late Judge Campbell, and with
flowing beard that so closely resembled
the whiskers of the Judge that all were
at once reminded oÂ£ the bearded auto
crat of the Police Court of San Fran
cisco. The whiskers simply arose to
get the breeze from the electric fans
which were so beautifully eulogized in
Mayor Land's address of welcome to
the delegates.
A little commotion under the banner of
San Francisco attracted general notice.
Perhaps some of the rural delegates
fancied that Foote and McNab might
be again exchanging opinions; but all
prospect of anything so exciting van
ished when word went tound that the
Harney delegates wore moving from
the position immediately in front of
the chairman's desk to a side section of
the pavilion. This change of base was
made at the special request of the pa
vilion committee, and did not involve
the sacrifice of a single Democratic
principle.
At 2:50 p. m. Mr. Alford, chairman of
the Democratic State Central Commit
tee, gave the convention the glad rap
to order and made a brief speech, out
lining the purposes of the meeting.
After Mayor Land of Sacramento wel
comed the delegates the band played
the "Star Spangled Banner." The dele
gates arose in their places with some
reluctance and indecision. The exhi
bition of patriotism as manifested by
the scant applause was feeble indeed.
It was obviouÃ to all the onlookers that
many of the delegates here assembled
have not the slightest spark of national
patriotism and that the atory of the
flag is not to them an inspiring theme.
It was remarked in the lobby, "Walt
until next week and hear the Republi
can cheers for the flag when the 'Stai
Spangled Banner" is played by the
band."
D. W. Carmiehnel of Sacramento now
caught the gaze of the chairman. When
the Sacramentan produced something
in writing every one was eager to know
what that something was. It turned
out to be an announcement list of the
temporary officers, other than the
! chairman, offered by the citizens' com
j mittee of Sacramento. The list as fol
; lows was accepted by the convention:
Secretary, Edwin F. Smith; as
, sistants â E. I. Woodman, J. J. Car
! roll, P. A. Byrne, George Johnson,
1 sergeant-at-arms, Matt Coffey; as
sistants â John Studarns, George Ro
â  dovich, George Suydam, Fred O'Con
nell, Jack McÃea, James Axtay, John
] McLaughlin, F. Sheehan, Henry Be
cincio, Fred Leloy.
The chair then directed the secretary
i to call the- roll. The roll call" had not
progressed beyond two or three coun
ties, when C. C. Wright of Los An
geles moved that a further call of the
roll be suspended, as all the names
: would go to the committee on creden
tials. The motion prevailed.
Isidore Dockweiler of Los Angeles
i obtained recognition. When the words
j were spoken, announcing the re
cognition, the interest in the proceed
ings quickened. Efvery one- was alert
and eager to hear what the man from
â  the south, who had won such a signal
victory in the stormy caucus, had
jto say for himself. Interest in his
remarks was heightened by the knowl
j edge that he had been assailed in the
I San Francisco yellow journal as the
| tool and chattel of the Southern Pacific
j Company.
Delegates listened with rapt atten
j tion to his earnest and prompt refuta
j tion from the platform to every sen
tence of slander from the Hearstlings
! and cheered his manly sentiments to
the echo.
The paper that had assailed him was
j roundly hissed by the Democratic con
i vention, and before the session ended
' the Hearstlings in Sacramento were
I tumbling over one another to square
! the paper with Dockweiler and the con
i vention.
The closing words of Mr. Dockweiler's
I brief speech, placing Governor BurM in
i nomination for temporary chairman,
took many of the members by surprise,
but to others the announcement was
not unexpected.
When Chairman Alford uttered the
words, "Mr. Patton of Lob Angeles,"
the keenest interest and shouts were
heard, "Take the platform." Mr. Pat
ton was cheered again and again as
he walked from his place on the floor
of the convention to a position on the
platform alongside of the presiding of
ficer. Mr. Patton's manly tribute to
the personal and political integrity of
Mr. Dockweller was greeted with pro
longed cheers. The dressing down
which the yellow journal received for
asserting that Dockweiler was an in
strument of the Southern Pacific was
appreciated by the audience. Again,
as honest men and honest politics were
applauded, the Examiner was hissed
by the delegates.
The points in Mr. Patton's speech
which elicited demonstrations of ap
proval were the mentions of Maguire's
record as anti-monopolist and the allu
sions to the administration of Gover
nor Budd and the reference to the
Chicago platform. Governor Budd was
chosen with unanimity. The chair as
signed to Messrs. Patton and Dock
weller the agreeable duty of escorting
the temporary chairman to the plat
form. When the Governor came in
sight along with his escort the cor* 1
vention cheered heartily.
The Governor's speech accepting the
position was a model of brevity and
frankness, but the significant fact was
again noted in this that his ready vin
dication of Mr. Dockweiler, who had
been vilified and traduced by the Ex
aminer, evoked the earnest applause of
the convention. For the third time
during the afternoon session the out
cast yellow Journal of San Francisco
was rebuked by the hisseÃ of untram
meled delegations. On motion of M. F.
Tarpey of Alameda the chair was
authorized to appoint a committee of
fifteen on credentials. On motion of
Mr. Alford of Tulare the chair was di
| rected to appoint a committee of flf
! teen on permanent organization and
order of business. At the suggestion of
Mr. Leake of Yolo several motions to
adjourn were withdrawn and a recess
j of a half-hour declared.
The recess, however, was prolonged
until 5 o'clock. When Governor Budd
: again called the delegates to order he
; announced the ap^ of the
j committees as follows:
Credentialsâ F. A. Cutler, Del
i Norte, chairman; W. F. Prisk, Ne
i vada; C. C. Wright, Los Angeles; J.

The San Francisco fight came dan
gerously near getting on the floor of

I Eugene Deuprey was the author of this

by hie remarks. Major Harney also
spoke, but approached so near to the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 17, 1898,
CALL'S HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO.
Special Trains Will Carry the Paper to the Capital City
During Both Conventions.
Sacramento people were not surprised to see The Call on the streets
before 8 o'clock thss morning, because they have become accustomed to such
experiences when the circumstances demand. Realization of the fact that
the news is wanted, and wanted without delay, induce the putting on of
a special train. It is pleasant for delegates who have been up until midnight
to find that they can read at the breakfast table a full account of the pro
ceedings. They naturally look to The Call for the complete and accurate ac
count, and will not be disappointed. The special train will ,be con
tinued during the two conventions, and Sacramento will have the news as
early as the city in which the paper is publishedâ that is, as early as they
may be ready to read It.
danger line that he was interrupted on
points of order. McNab was not in
terrupted, but at the close of his re
marks he was jeered by some of the in
terior delegates*
While Major Harney was speaking a
deep sonorous tone rolled over the con
vention. It came from the direction of
the Amador delegation. Governor Budd
looked that way and simultaneously a
form rising from the mountain group
rolled out the words to assist recogni
tion, "Muldoon of Amador.." The name,
the time, the place and the tone all
tended to give special force to the epi
sode. The humor was soon caught and
the convention had a good laugh, in
which some of the rising wrath was
drowned.
One delegate from Alameda County,
who evidently came to the convention
to be soothed or inspired by oratory,
rose several times to implore the chair
man to call out R. M. Fitzgerald. No
special reason was given why Mr. Fitz
gerald should cast his eloquence into
the arena, but the Alameda man was
irrepressible. The dulcet tones of Deu
prey. the fervor of Ed Leake, the ring
ing cry of Harney were not to his lik
ing. He wanted Fitzgerald and Gov
ernor Budd promised that Fitzgerald
should have a chance. There is sure
to be one happy mortal on this sphere
when Fitzgerald speaks.
A resolution by Mr. Tarpey, supple
mented by a resolution by Mr. Heney,
against the use of proxies in the State
Central Committee, called out great ap
plause.
Mr. Alford moved that the chair ap
point a committee of seven on fusion.
A point of order against the considera
tion of the subject in advance of per
manent organization was sustained.
Recess was taken until 9 p. m.
The convention reassembled at 9
o'clock, but the evening session resulted
in little more than a few spiritless
speeches. Half the delegation remained
down town, knowing that nothing
would be accomplished until the com
mittees reported. The convention ad
journed to meet at 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, Sacramento,

far as I am concerned, I will set
an example, so far as I can possi
bly do so, by promising now that
so far as I am individually con
cerned, whatever the judgment
of this convention may be upon j
any proposition, that shall be my
judgment and my verdict, and I
hope that there will be no dis
senting from that proposition. I
now have the honor, gentlemen
of the convention, of introducing
to you the Mayor of Sacramento
â Mayor Land."
(Applause and cheers.)
Mayor Land took the platform and said:
"Mr. Chairman and Gentleman of the
Conventionâ lt affords me great pleasure j
to meet with you here to-day for tho first j
time in the history of my political life in |
Sacramento. The people of Sacramento |
to-day feel very proud in peeing such a (
body of representative people as are as
sembled here, because It docs us honor, j
We have done everything that we pns- j
sibly could do to make Sacramento as \
pleasant for you as possible. And I will
cay that at our meeting in San Francisco,
where the cltizenn of Sacramento city met
the Democratic committee, we were very
heartily received and were given every
ovation that was possible to make the
people feel as if they were at home. We
made promises to you gentlemen that if
you would come to our city we would ar
range for your entertainraect and com
fort. We promised you everything but
cool weather, but we promised to give you
electric fans here, which we have done, to
cool your sweltering brows. We want
you to go away feeling that we were your
friends and ' c want you to come again
and meet with us on future occasions.
"I wish to say to you as Mayor of Sac
ramento city that its citizens extend to
you their hearty greeting and bid you a
hearty and cordial welcome. During your
stay in the city I wish you to feel at home
and I extend to you the liberties of the
city."
The Chairmanâ The next thing in order
will be the nomination of officers to be the
temporary officers of this convention
af=ide from the temporary chairman, to
wit: The secretaries, etc.
Mr. Carmichael â Mr. Chairman, I offer
herewith a iiat o citizens which I nomi
nate as temporary officers of this conven
tion, other than temporary chairman.
The list, which is published elsewhere,
was handed in and the officers named
were elected by a vica voce vote.
The Chairmanâ The next thing in order
will be a roll call of the delegates of the
convention. The secretary will call the
roll.
After the call had been proceeded with a
few minutes it was moved and seconded
that further call be dispensed with. Car
ried.
The Chairmanâ Nominations for tem
purary chairman are now in order.

pride that we are able to point to
.ibe fact that in the administration
of Mr. Budd, whose nomination
I now desire to second, the De

â  .There being no further nominations for

vention. 1 have the honor of introducing
to you your temporary chairmanâ one
who needs no introduction to a California
audience an 1 especially a. Democratic au
dience. Governor James H. Budd. (Ap
plause and cheers.)
Governor Budd â I stayed
away from Sacramento until after
I had determined that the chair-
man. of this convention had been
decided on. But, arriving here
this morning, I ascertained that
the friends of the various candi
dates for office and candidates for
the chairmanship desired me to
act in this capacity. I have re
fused in the past to consent to my
name being used for this purpose.
I refused to-day â persistently re
fused â until my friend, Dock
weiler, the choice of the Los An
geles delegation, insisted that I
must serve. (Applause.)
I regret as much as any one
and more than many the unfortu
nate matters that have crept this
morning into the press of the
State, but I do not believe that
any paper in the State of Cali
fornia, or. any man within its
bounds, has ever in the past, will
now, or shall in the future, say
that Dockweiler is not as good
an anti-monopolist as George
Patton, Judge Maguire or the
Governor of this State. (Ap
plause.)
Nevertheless, in deference to
his wishes and the wishes of the
others, I have accepted this trust.
I will preside over you as im
partially as possible for one of my
temperament to preside, and I
now await your pleasure as to the
first business of the convention.
â  Motions are now in order.
Mr. Tarpey of Alamedaâ l just merely
wish to make a motion, Mr. Chairman.
Can I stand here?
ThÂ» Chairmanâ lf you wish to simply
make a m r tion you may stand there. If
you wish to show yourself, come forward.
Mr. Tarpeyâ l do not want to make any
Invidious comparisons where myself is
concerned, Mr. Chairman, and where a
handsome man such as yourself presides
over this body, I do not desire to place
myself in contact with you. (Applause and
laughter). I desire at this time to make a
motion that a committee of fifteen be ap
pointed upon credentialsâ to be appointed
by the chair. â . ,"'Yr":-u'

Mr. Patton of Los Angelesâ Mr. Chair

Mr. Foote of Alrmedaâ Mr. Chairman, I

The Chairâ State your point of order.
Mr. Foote â No committee upon platform

committee on credentials report who are
the proper members of this convention.

Mr. Knglishâ l understood t.ie chair to

after the committee *on credentials had
reported to find nut who were the members
of this convention.
The Cnalrâ That is correct.
Mr. Englishâ la it not the same In this
instance?
The Chairâ No. Because if we did not
adopt an order of business we would never
be able to hear from the committee on

urd<-r of business, which has to oome up
and be passed upon before the committee
on credentials.

of Tulare and it was carried by viva voce
vote.

"Oh. no.'")

tion take an adjournment of one hour.
The motion was seconded.
Mr. Leakeâ Mr. Chairman, a number of
delegates around me have stated that an
hour is too long a time, and we have al
ready wasted a good deal <'f time, and I
will make the motion that this convention
take a recess of half an hour to enable
th<- chairman to appoint the members of
th< Be two committees.
Mr. Foote of Alamedaâ l second the mo
tion. Then you can appoint your com
mittee and we will take an adjournment.

The Chairâ I have not got any slate as
yet. It is moved by the gentleman from
Alameda. Mr. McPike, seconded by Mr.
Leake of Yolo County, and Beconded by
the gentleman from Alameda, Mr. Poote,
that we take a recess for half an hour,
during which time the chairman will scan
the slates of the various parties and make
his choice. (Laughter.)
The motion was carried and the chair
man announced an adjournment for fcalf
an hour.
The convention was called to order at
5:10 o'clock and the following proceedings
were had:
The Chairmanâ As I did not have a pro

taken some little time to consider the va

Passing Enlivenment
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 16.â Having witnessed
the opening of the Democratic conven
tion, and watched it until recess, I am
privileged to make a few remarks
about it and to congratulate the people
who were not there.
It is truth that on the surface the
convention was not thrilling. The se
cret forces at work made no outward
showing. The creaking of the wires
could not be heard. Only results could
be observed, and these did not approacn
a stage of dramatic suggestion until
recess was almost at hand.
Then Deuprey threw a bomb, and a
little later apologized, saying practical
ly, that he did not know the old thing
was loaded. I suspect, however, that
he knew it all the time. As I write
at 7 o'clock there is a recess supposed
to last until 9, but I go ahead in the be
lief that the resumption of business will
be many hours beyond this time.
There may be an indefinite number
of remarks passed, but I do not expect
there will be any more formal proceed
ings until to-morrow. During the re
cess, committees are struggling; con
testants making pleas, and rival fac
tions striving to down each other.
They can't get to a conclusion in two
hours. Too many a burst of eloquence
is waiting to be turned loose. If there
is a resumption of convention business
to-night put me on record as nearly as
bad a prophet as those who are filling
the Examiner with that which is not
so. But this carries us away from the
convention.
A party is a big machine, and should
move smoothly. Judged by to-day's
work, the machine has slipped a cog.
The Pavilion was just comfortably
crowded. It was a blaze of patriotic
color. The electric fan blew cooling
breezes through the great hall, stirring
the whiskers of the delegates, rustling
the feathers of fair spectators and
making life seem worth living.
The banners swayed in the refreshing
current.
There were many ladles present. I
do not know why they were there, or
what induced them to stay, but am
glad they were there and that they
stayed. They supplied to the occasion
the element of beauty, and doubtless
they elevated the moral tone by sup
pressing the ready cuss words. Very
dainty they looked In white dresses and
airy hats. I thank them for having
been there.
As the hall was filling a band came
in. It was playing patriotic airs and
I got the first shock of the day. The
people paid no attention to the char
acter of the music. The band might
as well have played "Chippie, Get Your
Hair Cut." There was not a sound of
applause, not a handclap. Unheeded
was the "Yankee Doodle." The "Star
Spangled Banner" made no hit. There
was not a sign of approval at "Dixie."
What was the matter with the people
I cannot think. Possibly they were
thinking more of pie than of patriot
ism. This is ventured as a guess, for
I never before saw an assemblage of
American citizens which did not seem
in some measure touched by national
melodies, particularly since the war
has made doubly dear the "Red, White
and Blue."
The convention was called to order
by Chairman Alford, fifty minutes after
the time set. Mr. Alford asked that
there be no smoking. He then, said it
was a pleasure to call such a gathering
to order, adding that he would not
make a speech, whereat there were in
dications that the sense of pleasure
had become mutual. I suspect that the
one reason Alford did not make a
speech to be that he can't. Certainly
he did not approach near to essaying
one. He Is a large young man with
glasses. He is smooth shaved and, I
judge, tolerably smooth generally. He
said that the members of the Demo
cratic party dill not disagree on funda
mental questions, thus implying that
he did not regard the San Francisco
contest as fundamental, a position to
which he was not followed by all his
listeners. Alford won a feeble and per
functory applause, which might as well
have been withheld, but was typical of
the session.
There was no enthusiasm until the
delegates began to get hot-tempered;
and most of the time they were In good
humor, which was subduing in effect.
Mayor Land was introduced and wel
comed the delegates. He has undoubt
edly expected to do this in "well
chosen words" as is customary, but he
had partly forgotten what choice he
had made. Mr. Land is not an orator.
His Intentions were honorable and so
recognized. When he said: "We done
what was right," I for one, believed
him fully. Certainly the prodigal dis
play which brightened the interior o<
the great structure showed that Sacra
mento had neglected nothing and the
spirit of hospitality so manifest every
where needed no rounded periods to set
it forth.
The "Star-Spangled Banner" again.
The strains rose up to the radiant
canopy, echoed among the swaying
banners and at last the convention
noticed it. A lan arose, gesticulating
violently to his neighbors, and one by
one they got up and stood until the
sound had died away. There were
three cheers. It would be pleasing to
describe them as rousing, but it would
not be veracious. They were pitifully
weak. The whirr of the electric fan
sending comfortable waves across the
room almost drowned them, and it was
but a modest whirr.
I do not write this in a spirit of fault
finding, but to teach the Democrats to
be a little more enthusiastic. They
will flnd it a profitable political specu
lation. People are said to have been
benefited by whistling in a grave
yard. The analogy may be imperfect.
The first real speech of the day was
made by a distinguished-looking gen
tleman from Los Angeles, introduced
as Dockweiler. He is very dark, with
black beard and hair, a pallid yet
healthy countenance, suggesting a re
flned Svengali. Mr. Dockweiler's de
livery is ornate, and I opine that he
could, under the impetus of. circum
stances, rise to considerable heights of
oratory. He adverted feelingly to the
row in the delegation of which he is a
member and which had lost to him the
opportunity of becoming temporary
chairman of the convention. In specific
terms he resented the slander which
had branded him as a tool of the
Southern Pacific, and his charge that
Patton, his opponent, knew the charge
to be fajse, was so evidently sincere
that it won instant sympathy.
Dockweiler, freely relinquishing all
claims, nominated Governor Budd to
the temporary chairmanship.
The motion was seconded by Patton,
who, in so doing, freely acquitted his
rival of affiliation with the railroad.
It seemed to me a gracious and grace
ful Incident.
Patton seconded the nomination of
Budd, and of caurse there was no real
opposition â the one frantic "No" from
the rear being ascribed to some joker.
There had been cheers for both
speakers, and there were more when
the two were appointed a committee of
two to fetch the Governor to the chair.
From the celerity with which the er
rand was performed a suspicion arose
that Budd had suspected what was
going to happen and had generously re
frained from going into hiding. There
were more cheers when the Governor
came forward, but no such volume as
threatened the integrity of the walls.
The name of Maguire. which, I forgot
to say, was mentioned by Patton, had
excited a modest round of applause,
and the bouquets he tossed around
seemed to win approval.
The temporary chairman began his
address by expressing regret at the
news which had crept into the papers
of the State concerning Los Angeles.
I tell you that news does not creep into
the papers. It is projected into them
by design. He also stated clearly that
Dockweiler was free from any taint of
corporation control, the Governor being
thus the third prominent and respect
able gentleman to accuse the Examiner
of falsehood before the convention was
twenty minutes of age.
Then came a recess, which for the
dreariness of it will haunt me long. It
was due to the necessity for appoint
ing a committee on credentials, to in
clude fifteen delegates. The recess was
for half an hour. Men went out afar
to get sundry drinks. The women lin
gered. One delegate fell to peaceful
sleep. An hour passed. The delegate
awoke, looked about him and went to
sleep again. Three hours had gone by
before the Governor reappeared. Of
course, I do not understand the delay.
In fifteen seconds fifteen men might
have been named. lam told that wires
had to be pulled, and possibly some
were pulled so hard that there was
breakage, necessitating repairs.
But the Governor came back.
A buzzing as of political bees was
suddenly stilled. The chairman apolo
gized, stating that as the situation had
been thrust upon him as a surprise he
did not have a slate in his pocket. He
had done the best he could under the
circumstances; but I do not suppose
that everybody was pleased.
There was a second committee an
nounced, but I did not take down the
names of either, and they can be dis
covered by a glance at the news re
ports. They were both to meet in the
evening, and the prospects were for an
immediate adjournment of the conven
tion until to-morrow.
Here Grand Sachem Ruddick was in
vited to make an address. Tt was not
bo inspiriting as the recess had been,
but it was wholly proper and probably
necessary. T hope, however, that he
wiU not do so any more.
At this point there was the first smell
of gunpowder, and a battle seemed im
minent.
A motion was made by Tarpey, and
had a direct bearing upon the San
Francisco fight, the advocates of either
side meanwhile glaring at each other,
and a speech trembling on the tip of
more than one tongue. One or two of
these speeches got away.
Gavin MrNab added his rich Scotch
brogue and his paucity of thought to
the occasion.
Deuprey had made a motion that a
recess be taken until 9 o'clock.
Objection was made that the com
mittees in this brief time could not at
tend to their work. Gavin believed
they could. He was called down hard
by a gentleman from Yolo, who de
clared that Gavin himself would be be
fore the credential committee for a
longer time than an hour and a half.
Gavin had been cordially invited
from various parts of the house to "sit
down."
The Invitations were to the accom
paniment of hissep, which I took to
be in token of disapprobation. Gavin
cannot be wholly blamed for being of
fensive. There is a theory that God
made him. Therr were motions to "lay
on the table" a motion to rescind the
action by which adjournment had been
decided to be until 9 o'clock; there were
fingers raised to heaven and one or
two people invited, sotto voce, to start !
in the other direction.
Major Harney made a strong plea for |
an extension. There were efforts to j
stop him. He grew impassioned and
wouldn't stop. Delegates rose to points \
of order and sat down to taps of the â 
gavel, and Harney talked on. He was
out of ordep all the time, but nobody
cared much.
Deuprey got up to announce that he
had not been aware the gun was load- j
ed, but, of course, he had been aware
of it, not being new to politics.
And the 9 o'clockers, according to the I
records of the secretary, won the day.
or, rather, the hour. I don't think
they won much. When people started
out to dinner, Alford, down in the body
of the house, was trying to make a few
remarks, but his purpose was not dis
covered.
â¢ * *
This is later and additional to the re
marks above. The thins turned out as
predicted. Of course, the convention
could do nothing in the evening. The
credentials committee was not through.
It was at the Senate chamber, hearing
the San Francisco contest.
Dropping into the Capitol, I had the
pleasure of hearing McNab again. Har
ney had already spoken. It is but just
to say that McNab made a plausible
speech. He told without reserve that
he was a good man and an uncorrupti
ble. According to his statement, he is
so pure that nothing less benign than
the breath of heaven should ever touch
him. He related his struggles for the
elevation of Democracy. He extolled
Phelan as an angel of light shuddering
at all evil and responsible for all good.
The room was crowded, and there was
present a well-lunged Phelan push,
who, at each mention of that magic
name, burst into hosannahs. McNab
was occasionally Interrupted. When
he was detected in the asertion of un
truth he gave no sign of embarrass
ment, but took a new tack. He in
sulted men whom I considered his bet
ters, morally and intellectually, and I
hope for forgiveness when confessing
that my opinions were in no wise shak
en, lie talked for an hour, and if per
mitted would have been distributing
his conversational burrs yet.
Major Harney called him down from
some of his flights, but the thud did not
disturb his serenity. He had been

That Same Good Value
in $9.95 Suits Lasts â¢
Another Week.
Appreciating the fact that this particular line
of suits is proving one of the most popular offerings
we have ever called attention to, we continue it for
the rest of the week.
Stylish and perfectly tailored in Cassimere and
fancy Cheviots or Worsteds, and in the best selec-
tions of the popular colorings. The suits offered are
worth every cent of $15.00, $17.50 and $20.00. But
at the uniform price of $9.95, that they have been
reduced to, they should certainly prove a bargain,
and should tempt you.
. We have gathered together a limited number
of $4.00 and $4.50 Trousers and reduced them to
$2.45â a splendid bargain, any one of them. They
are of seasonable, handsome new patterned striped
worstedsâ guaranteed to fit youâ trousers that will
give you in wear many times their cost.
S.N.WOOD&CO.
718 Market Street, S. F. I
called down before and the process was
no surprise. As a finale, he declared
he would accept no compromise, but
would have his Democracy recognized
as the only genuine brand, or get out.
I omit detail, because there was too
much of it.
It must not be assumed that all was
quiet. Some of the committee were
j getting tired and all of them were hot.
Interruptions became so frequent that
an executive session was suggested.
The vote stood 7 to 7, leaving the de
| cision to the chairman, who voted ia
j the negative.
Then J. J. Dwyer came to the front.
He got so far as to say that the state
ment of McNab was a tissue of falsi
fications, when Wright stopped him.
There was a wrangle and a threat to
clear the lobby, heretofore made with
frequency and regarded as a bluff, but
it was carried out, so that there was an
executive session after all.
T<> this, at the moment I write, Dwyer
may be making a speech and probably
McXab's ears are tingling. The rep
resentatives of the two factions are
about the streets. They stand at bars
where Napa soda and other stimulants
are sold, and imbibe largely. There is
bad blood and there are likely to be
black eyes. The glorious cause of
Democracy is putting war paint on its
interior finish. I do not propose to
create fatigue by a long story, but any
body can gather that sweet peace is
not reigning particularly.
Mr Hearst's understudy is hopping
about like a cricket and all may yet
be well.
I noticed in the Examiner of this
morning a spirited picture showing the
headquarters of the papers. The arti
cle has invaded the realm of fiction in
a chase after the editor. The Examiner
headquarters here are in an old barber
shop, as lonesome as Goldsmith's "De
serted Village." At the time that pic
ture was made the headquarters pre
sented as much life as a morgue at
midnight. There were no rush of mes
sengers, no crowd of eager observers,
nobody. In fact the place was dark
and tenantless. "
Perhaps Dwyer can establish that
McNab has trifled with truth and that
the job cannot be as easy as it is to
show that the Examiner is devoting its
talents to the same end.
To-morrow's proceedings in conven
tion will partake of the nature of the
opposite of a love feast. There will be
consideration of the reports of the
credentfals committee. I would counsel
Mayor Land to have a squad of police
within whistle call.

GETTING TO
. THE FRONT
Continued from Third Page.
N. Conklln of San Diepro, L- J- Maddox of
Stanislaus. A. M. Seymour of Sacramento,
Ik N. Arnold of San Jose and W. J. Curtis
of San Bernardino. At 7 o'clock this
evening this committee will meet to pass
on credentials, and all desiring business
with them will see them at that hour.
Mr. Arnold of San Joseâ Mr. Chairman,
Will you please correct the Initials of
Arnold to D. H. Arnold.
The Chairmanâ l think I did.
Mr. Arnoldâ lt was D. N. Arnold.
The chairâ They turned you In as
George Arnold (laughter) and another
man put you down as I have you.
Mr. Tarpey of Alamedaâ l desire to pre
sent a resolution which I desired to have
read by the secretary and referred to the
committee on permanent organization and
order of business. I present it at this
time, sir, because some supersensltive
persons might imagine it was addressed
to somebody. It is not. sir. It Is ad
tnmed to what I consider to be proper
Democratic procedure and I present it
now so that any supersensitlve gentle- i
man- may not "Â»ink th,at I am firing at
him.
The secretary then read the resolution,
as follows:
The State Central Committee,
believing it to be for the best in
terest of the party, recommends
that such persons only be elected
State Central Committeemen as
are willing to accept its responsi
bilities and personally attend its
general meeting, thus curing the
growing evil of proxy representa
tion; and we further recommend
a discontinuance of the late prac
tice of enlarging the membership
.of the State Central Committee
by appointment.
The chairâ Why not now submit It to
the convention?
Mr. Tarpeyâ lt is a matter in my Judg
ment, sir, that Is properly submlssible to
the committee upon permanent organiza
tion and order of business.
. The chair â Very well; it will go there
then.
Mr. Henry of San Francisco â I desire
to submit at the same time an addition
to that resolution.
The secretary read the resolution, ac
follows:
Resolved, That hereafter no
voting by proxy shall be allowed,
nor shall it be legal in the State
Central Committee upon any
question involving or in any way
affecting the rights of any organ
ization of the party to act as the
legally constituted committee of
any county in the State.
The chairâ You move its reference to the
same committee?
Mr. Heeneyâ Yes. sir.
The chairâ lf there is no objection It Is
bo ordered.
Mr. Deuprey of San Francisco â Mr.
Chairman, I move you, sir, that when
this convention does adjourn it does ad
.journ to the hour of 9 o'clock this even
ing. My reason for making the motion
for that 'period Is that I believe we can
do more work between 9 p. m. and 1
a., m. than we can do all of to-morrow dur
ing the heat of the day. It seems to me
that by 9 p. m. these committees ought
to be ready to report, if I can get a sec
ond to that motion.
Motion seconded.
The motion was put by the chair and
carried.
Mr. E. B. Leake of Yoloâ Mr. Chair
man: At the request of a great many
delegates in this vicinity I desire to make
a motion to reconsider the motion just
adopted, which provides that this con
vention take a recess until 9 o'clock to
night. Now, it is a physical impossibility
for that committee on credentials to get
their report by 9 o'clock to-night, and as
a result this convention can do nothing
until that committee does report, and I
â will make a motion that we rescind that
resolution, if I can get a second to the
motion.
M.otipn seconded.
The chairâ lt io moved and seconded
that we reconsider the motion by winch
we resolved that when we take a recess
we do take such recess until 9 o'clock
this evening. The gentleman from San
Francisco, Mr. McNab, has the floor.
McNab from San Francisco â
"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen
of the Convention: It would ap
pear to me that in two hours any
discussion that could possibly
arise or have any possible merit
could be discussed. (Applause.)
"Every time that the slightest
friction in the Democracy of San
Francisco occurs, it is thought
necessary to go back to the days
of '49 and tell us all about every
Democrat who ever lived and
what he did. There ought to be
some time when that talk and
some time when the contests
should be considered terminated.
Mr. Leake of Yolo County â I
want to call the attention of the
delegates of this convention to
the fact that never in the history
of any convention in this State
has it been enabled to assemble
at the hour set. That committee
will meet to-night at 7 o'clock â
so the members of the committee
say. It will be half past 7 o'clock
before any business is transacted.
That is the history of all State
conventions which I have ever at
tended. Now I want to make
this further prediction, that the
gentlemen from San Francisco
will occupy more than one hour
and a half before that committee
to-night. We of the country are
tired of coming here and wash
ing the dirty linen of San Fran
cisco. And I tell the gentlemen
of this convention, I will venture
the prediction that that commit
tee will not be ready to report by
to-morrow morning. And it is a
waste of time â an absolute waste
of time â to call these people
back here to-night and let them
sit here hour after hour, waiting
for the report of that committee.
Now I want to say further that
the motion that I have made
upon this matter has no bearing
â absolutely no bearing whatever
â upon any contest that may be
made in this house, but the mo
rion is made for the purpose of
saving time. I know that these
members will be dragged out
here again at 9 o'clock, and we
will only sit here hour after hour
waiting for that committee that
will not be ready to report until
to-morrow morning, and for that
reason I have made this motion
to reconsider that resolution, and
I hope it will prevail.
Mr. Crittenden of San Luis
Obispo â Mr. Chairman: On this
question of adjournment I desire
to state that it is within the power
of that committee of credentials
to finish their work in two hours.
I am from the country, too, and
I say that you can limit the ques
tion of debate on that question
yourselves. You have not got to
listen to a man for an hour and a
half. Give him five minutes, or
give him ten. You have only got
to pass upon the question of the
members of this convention, and
you can do that in twenty min
utes. The only question presented
to this convention is as to the po
sition occupied by the delegation
from San Francisco. Now I say
to the gentlemen of this conven
tion, you can settle that in an
hour and a half if the members of
the committee on credentials will
limit the debate on these matters
to five or ten minutes. I move to
lay on the table the motion to
reconsider.
Motion was seconded.
The Chairmanâ The motion Is now to
lay on the table the motion to reconsider.
Mr. Vice of Sacramentoâ Mr. Chairman,
I would like to stateâ
A voice â The gentleman is out of order.
Mr. Vice of Sacramento â I would like to
be heard just a moment.
The Chairâ Very well. I will hear what
you have to say. This Is a Democratic
convention, and we never gag anybody.
Mr. Vice of Sacramento â I would like
to state that we were informed we would
only have a recess for thirty minutes, and
we waited for three hours, and therefore
the delegates from the country would like
to ask thiÃ convention to adjourn until 9
o'clock to-morrow morning.
Major Harney of San Fran
cisco â Mr. Chairman and Gen
tlemen of the Convention: I am
opposed to this convention ad
journing over to 9 o'clock this
evening. I am opposed to that
for the simple reason that a great
question of difference exists in
the city and county of San Fran
cisco as to which is the legal De
mocracy of that city and county.
As a representative of the Demo
cratic party of San Francisco, I

am here to ask at the hands of
this convention fair play, fair 1
treatment, a chance to be heard,
and then a fair decision. (Ap
plause and cries of "Good boy!")
Mr. Chairman, as a representa
tive of what I believe to be the
legal Democracy of the city and
county of San Francisco, we pro
pose to produce evidence to
prove beyond all question of a
doubt that there exists in the city j
and county of San Francisco a
conspiracy â
A delegate from Los Angelesâ l rise to a
point of order.
The Chairâ State your point of order.
Delegate from Los Angelesâ l make the j
point of order that the gentleman is not
addressing himself to the question before
the house.
The Chairâ The point of order is well ta
ken. Mr. Harney. you will have plenty of
time to discuss this mutter to-morrow.
Major Harneyâ Well, Mr. Chairman, I
will try to address myself to the question.
Mr. McPike of Alameda â At the time
this original motion was made and voted
upon by the house there was not a nega
tive voice. We all voted in the affirma
tive, and that includes Mr. Leake, and
therefore he cannot n-.ake a motion to re
consider.
The Chairâ But he voted the way the
motion was carried. If he had voted the
other way he could not.
Major Harney â Now, Mr.
Chairman, in talking upon this
motion it is almost impossible not
to refer to existing conditions in
the city and county of San Fran
cisco. I believe that I am ad
dressing this convention which is
composed of representatives of
the Democracy of this State. I
believe that each and every mem
ber of the convention has assem
bled here for the purpose of do
ing those things to help the
Democratic party of California
and to raise the standard of De
mocracy and place it upon the
pinnacle of success on the Bth of
next November. It is a fact that
it is absolutely impossible to se
cure success for the standard of
the Democracy without a good
round majority from the city and
county of San Francisco. There

fore, Mr. Chairman, the commit
tee on credentials this evening is
to meet for the purpose of hear
ing evidence in the case of the
San Francisco Democracy. I ap
peal to the members of the con
vention to give us a chance and
an opportunity of presenting all
the evidence we have. I appeal
to you, gentlemen of the conven
tion, as a Democrat, as one who
has voted for the Democratic
party so far as it was within my
power, to give us a fair chance, to
give us fair treatment, and I ask
in the name of the Democracy
that this convention adjourn un
til 9 o'clock to-morrow.
Mr. MuHnnn of Amartor-I rise to a
point of order.
The Chairâ Mr. Muldoon you are to be
heard. (Laughter).
Mr. Muldoonâ My point of order is this:
A motion to lay upon the table is not de
1 batable and 1 think tbe San Francisco
I delegation, if you will allow them to keep
I on talking, will keep us here so that we
i will not be able to get home in time to
vote.
The Chairâ Your point of order Is well
taken. I thought I would give them a lit
! tie airing now and there would be less for
the committee to hear. Major Harney,
the point of order is well taken, but I
will not gag you if you want to talk a
little while.
Major Harney â I do not be
lieve it is the purpose of this con
vention to gag any Democrat.
We have been gagged in the city
and county of San Francisco, and
I hope that this convention will
not follow out the practices
adopted on the part of a few in
the city of San Francisco. I do
ask of this convention, Mr. Chair
man, that it adjourn over until 9
o'clock to-morrow morning and
give the San Francisco delega
tion a fair chance to present the
evidence affecting the interests of
the San Francisco Democracy.
Mr. Wright of Los Angelesâ Mr. Chair
man and gentlemen of the cor vention, as
a member of that committee I think of
course that there will be accorded to the
contesting delegation frem San Francisco
n ripht to be heard to an extent which
shall satisfy each of them. I hope so.
But may it not be that the business of
that committee may be expedited to such
an extent that we would be ready to re-
POTI here at 9 o'clock, and if so, would
not It be best that we should come back
here and be able to expedite the business
of this convention? If it turns out, gen
tlemen of the convention, that we cannot
report you have not wasted any time. You
have simply walked up to this pavilion,
and it will do you good, I am sure, after
your supper, and if, perchanc*>. the report
of the committee is not ready you can
walk back again. [Murmurings.]
Mr. Deuprey of San Franciscoâ Major
Harney was permitted to speak In rela
tion to this subject matter, not involved
in the motion to lay upon the table, but
it reaches the proposition presented first,
which was adopted by this convention,
that we should meet at 9 o'clock. My ob
ject was not, under any circumstances, to
have any discussion that might be allow
ed by the committee on credentials to be
In any wise shortened, and I again say
to those who may represent a different
view than I do upon this Moor that if they
will only recognize that if there Is a re
port coming from mis committee on cre
dentials that report is to be passed upon
by this convention, then these gentlemen
will have an opportunity to air their elo
quence and give us their reasons if they
deem fit. But for Gods sake let us got
down to work. We came here for that
purpose and not to waste our time. [Ap
plause and cheers.]
The Chair â Gentlemen, we have all dis
cussed this sufficiently, and we will now
recognize that the point of order is well
taken.
Mr. Vice of Sacramentoâ l would like to
ask a question In regard to the vot*, or
the question to be voted upon.
The Chairâ l am going to state the prop
osition, but I will not state it until you sit
down. All you gf-ntlernen sit down. I un
derstand you want to hear Mr. Fitzgerald.
You will get a chance before you get
through with the convention. The gentle

ing. That motion was carried. Later the
gentleman from Yolo moved that we re
consider the motion by which we agreed
that when we adjourned we adjourn until
9 o'clock '.his evening. Pending that mo
tion, a motion to lay on the table was
made. The question now before this con
vention Is: Shall the motion to reconsider
fixing the hour at 9 o'clock be laid on the
table.
The motion was put and was carried by
a vive voce vote.
The Chairâ When .we take our recess, it
will be until 9 o'clock to-night, and if we
are not able to attend and transact any
business, if the delegations will send me
their orders, we will allow them to com
pete with the wind machine that has just
stopped.
Mr. Alfordâ Mr. Chairman, one of the
most important things that we have to
deal with In this convention is the matter
of perfecting a reunion between the re
form forces in this State for the purpose
of electing the next Governor of Califor
nia and all the ticket that we will nomi
nate here, and I move you rvow that a
committee of seven be appointed by the
Chair to consider the matter of fusion as
it exists to-day between the Democratic
party, the Populists and Silver Republi
can party.
The motion was seconded.
A delegate â Mr. Chairman, I risÂ» to a
point of order, that this committee can
not be appointed to consider the matter
of fusion until after we have organized as
a convention.
Mr. Alfordâ The fusion cannot take
place, Mr. Chairman, until the convention
adopts the report of the committee.
The Chairâ l made the same ruling upon
the motion to appoint a committee upon
platform and resolutions and held that
until the contesting delegations were seat
ed, or until the matter of credentials was
settled we were simply a temprorary or
ganization. I think the point of order is
well taken.
Mr. Alfordâ l simply wanted to expedite
matters.
The Chairâ l desire to do so myself. In
the meantime the committee on perma
nent organization will look into that mat
ter. The delegates from the First Con

Fresno Men Caucus and a Majority
Would Support His Men.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO Aug. 16.â Sacramento's dele
gation caucused at the State Capitol
this morning and unanimously decided
to support E. I. Woodman of the Sac
ramento Bee for State Printer, and
Will S. Green of Colusa for Treasurer.
The Harney-McNab fight was brought
up but the delegation took no vote on
the question, agreeing instead to defer
action until after the convention recess,
when another caucus was called.
The twenty delegates from Fresno
caucused at the Golden Eagle and
elected E. D. Edwards chairman and
W. D. Foote secretary. Charles K<xei
man was indorsed for State Treasurer.
There was considerable discussion over
the San Francisco contest, and a ma
jority of the delegation openly ex
pressed themselves as in favor of sup
porting the Harney delegation. ihe
sentiment of the caucus favored the
unit rule on the proposition, but no
definite action was taken.
The Shasta men elected Thomas
Dozier chairman of the delegation at
their meeting this morning.
No positive action was taken, but l
was the opinion among the delegates
that the best way of settling the Har
ney-McNab feud would be to seat botn
delegations, giving their members a
half vote each.

CHANCES
ARE GOOD
A Host Lined Up to
Boost Him for
Congress.
Hilborn's Friends life
Saying Nothing, but
Sawing Wood.
A STRONG PATRONAGE PUSH
Candidates Indulging in
Personalities to Win
Wavering Votes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 16.
If the appearance of the respective
headquarters of Messrs. Hllborn and
Metoalf to-day be any criterion of these
candidates" strength as evidenced by
numbers then Mr. Metcalf will win to
w's fight by fully 100 to 1. Ala
meda, however, is a deceptive county.
: :ally it i. a hypocritical county.
It has Been many Btrange primaries.
Many times "sure winners" before the
primary have bt'L-n encrusted in frost
when the votes have been tallied. In
stance? of this nature are very recent.
Two years atro every element of ma-
chine politics apparently was in favor
: .t'f Ju<!pe Prick. The street was for him.
.Even the county committee favored
him. Although he made a strong cam
.faigrr for a new man the county went
almost solid for Mr. Hilborn.
nditlona now. it must be admitted,
are considerably changed. Mr. Hil
born has caust-d much disappointment
: j n pei .rteri since his last eleo
' t! >n. Mr. Metcalf also, unlike Mr. Frfck.
â  â  did. not wait until a short time before
"the "ongrresslonal Convention to make
: - his campaign. With the aid of the most
;â  astu: U managers of this coun
ty, he has been steadily drawing
.â¢â  Ftrencih toward h-:? candidacy, until
now his friends claim five and possibly
â¢ all six of the Assembly districts in this
' â¢ county. This afternoon with few ex
ceptions every known .active politician
"â¢â¢â  Is. working tooth and nail for Metcalf.
â¢.His name is on every lip and every
street corner, and hi? headquarters re
semble a hive of buzzing bees.
Mr. Hilborn's headquarters on the
contrary are somewnat lonely, but so
they were two years ago, but not per
WHEN DELEGATES FROM FAR AND NEAR ARRIVED AT THE GOLDEN EAGLE
.haps quite so lonely as they were to-
During his terms in Congress Mr.
Hllborn has dispensed much patronage.
Many Of his supporters are in the Mint,
under the superintendence of Mr. Hil
born's former manage'- Frank Leach.
A large delegation from the money
making institution will be over here to
morrow to vote for the man who gave
them positions. Especially will this
(action work in the Fourth Ward,
v, here Mike Kelly, an employe of the
Mint, is said to control three hundred
votes. At last Saturday's primary
Kelly was for Pardee and ho delivered
his goo I faithfully. To-morrow he h;i.s
stated that he will show his gratitude
to Hilborn by being Just as faithful to
the Congressman.
During the past few days much per
sonality has been injected into the con
test. Mr. Hllborn rather unfortunately,
possibly, published a list of reasons and
arguments why he should be returned
to Congress. This gave the Metcalf
camp all the opportunity it wanted and
immediately the town was Hooded with
reasons and arguments why Mr. Hil
born should not be returned. Then Mr.
Hllborn In a public speech mentioned
something about his personal habits
and the Metcalf men at once had a re-.
ply to make.
This afternoon ten members of the
Republican Anti-Civil Service League,
including Colonel George \\ . Hogiet,
president of the Army and Navy Re
publican League, published a -state
ment, in which Mr. Hilborn is credited
with casting aspersions on the Presi
d tit of the United States. They de
clare that at a meeting of the league
in November of last year Mr. Hilborn
used the following language:
1 thought when I left Washington
that we had the President won over;
in fact, that he would modify the civil
service order extensively. ' Imagine,
then, my surprise when I saw a copy
of the paper with the President's new
ly promulgated order, indorsing, en
larging and clinching, as it were, the
order made by Cleveland. I want to
say to you, gentlemen, although I am
Borry to say it, yet 1 must say this:
Your President, Mr. McKinley, is a
weak-kneed sissy."
The signatures to the document are
those of W. S. O'Brien, George W. Ho
guet, Henry Menges, C. A. Fawcett, C.
E. Carlton, J. W. Osborn, William Tip
ton, William Duesler Jr., David M.
Briggs arid G. W\ C. de Jarley.
This afternoon a statement was in
circulation that County Clerk Jordan
was prepared to issue blank certificates
of registration, signed by him, that
could be used indiscriminately to-mor
row, and that this was. being done by
Mr. Jordan in the interests of Mr. Met
calf. The County Clerk has offered a
reward of $50 to any person obtaining
any such blank certificate having upon
it the seal of the County Clerk. In ad
dition to the reward of Mr. Jordan, an
other $50 was offered by E. Nusbaumer,
W. G. Henshaw and George W. Reed,
on behalf of Mr. Metcalf and for the
same purpose.
Mr. Metcalf's friends personally
called upon the Police Department to
see that sufficient officers be detailed
at every polling place in order that to
morrow's election be conducted quietly
and honestly. An address issued this
afternoon concludes:
"We call upon all good citizens of
this county to assiÃt us ifl having a
fair primary and an honest expression
of opinion as to the merit? of the two
Congressional candidates." This Is
signed by E. Nusbaumer, H. O. Trow

Metcalf. . Â_.,,
The local press is somewhat dividea
on the matter to be decided to-morrow.
The Tribune has been for some time
actively and openly making a Metcalf
campaign. The Enquirer yesterday is
sued an illustrated Hilborn nupplement,
"but it was credited to- another paper.
This afternoon the Tribune editorially
and locally Is strong for Metcalf, and
the Enquirer has not a word to say
editorially and is very conservative In
its local columns.
Two years ago, on the eve of the Con
gressional primary, a great sensation
was created by Senator Perkins, who
came out in strong support of Mr. Hil
born. There has been some fear that
some such move might be carried out
this time by some other agency, as
Senator Perkins some time ago assured
Metealf that he had no desire to take
any hand this year. This practical
withdrawal of Senator Perkins" in
dorsement from Mr. Hilborn hascaused
much talk. Both candidates have
adopted badges for to-morrow. The
Hilborn color being old gold and the

JUDGE SEAWELL WITHDRAWS HIS NAME
He Will Not Be a Candidate for the Nomination
for the Governorship, but Will Accept a
Supreme Judgeship.
Judge J. H. Seawell of Mendocino County to-day withdrew his candi
dacy for the nomination for Gov
ernor, and announced his inten
tion to seek the nomination for
Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. His reasons for bo doing
are set forth in the following
"Upon my arrival here I was
Informed that a majority of the
delegates seemed to have been
pledged to Judge Maguire. I could
not under any circumstance ac
cept an office from the convention
where a majority of the delegates
were pledged, regardless of meas
ures by which such pledges were
obtained. My candidacy would
simply be at this time a protest
against the nomination of Judge
Maguire without any hope of
nomination, therefore, upon con
sideration of all the conditions, I
derm it to be in the best interests
of Judge Maguire, as nominee of
the Democratic party, that I
should retire from the contest.
Many pf the unpledged delega
tions assured me of their contin
ued support and of their fealty,
but it appearing to be a foregone
conclusion that Judire Maeuire was the choice of the convention I reached
the conclusion that 1 would best subserve the interests of all parties by not
aj- usine any further contention Several delegations, including my own
county and others, urged me to retire and accept a nomination
ate Justice of the Supreme Court. I have indicated to them Â» *Â»Â» n S ne "
to enter upon a contest if they thought it advisable I unders and they
have made the announcement that I will be a candidate for the judgesh p.
This is the only position on the ticket I would accept Â§ other tn^^^ n ,? r -

ARRIVAL OF THE IROQUOI3.
Democratic Braves Meet a Rousing
Reception in the Capital City.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 16.â The Iroquois Club
of San Francisco was warmly greeted
on its arrival on the morning train. The
local Iroquois Club marched in a body
j to the depot to meet and welcome their
i fellow braves. A band was in attend-
I ance on each, and when the train pulled
into the depot the Sacramento braves
gave cheers for their guests while the
band played martial airs. After an ex
' change of greetings the Sacramento
I club members fell into line behind the
; band and acted as an escort guard to
' the San Franciscans. The visiting Iro-
I quois. some 100 in number, were round
j ly cheered as they marched f-~"n the
depot to Fireman's Hall on Eighth
street, between rJ and X streets, where
solid and liquid refreshments awaited
them. The members presented a very
striking and pretty picture as they
marched down X Ftreet with their
handsome badges pinned to their coat
lanels. Each member carried a small
! American flag.
The visiting Iroquois did not come
here to take a hand in any fight. They
ar-> on the convention ground to shout
and cheer for the success of the party.

The members of the Republican

i chairman T. D. Riordan presided, and
j immediately after the rollcall suggest-
I ed that the. report of the special com
mittee aDpointed to draft resolutions
on the death of the late chairman,
I Charles Man waring, be read. L. E.

! eulogized the late chairman and ex
! tended the sympathy of the members
; of the committee to the bereaved fam-
I ily. On motion of J. F. Ahearn the reso
lutions were adopted by a rising vote,
and on motion of Jesse E. Marks an
engrossed copy was ordered presented
to Mr. Manwaring's mother. A copy of
! similar resolutions adopted by the
: West End Republican Culb were read
i and ordered filed.
The committee then adjourned, to
meet Thursday evening at the head

NEWS OF THE CONVENTION.
AS its readers are aware, this paper will support
the Republican ticket. Therefore among its
rights is that of promoting the nomination of
the best and strong^t men. This it has done and
will continue to do. But it does not by this course
forfeit the privilege of giving all the news, and pre
senting it without bias. Its accounts of the Demo
cratic convention will be full and accurate, and those
of the Republican convention to' follow will be given
in a similar way.
Already there has been a clear demonstration of the
truth that a partisan joiirnal can at the same time be a
newspaper, untinged by prejudice, and that by being
so it will win respect and friends. During the prog
ress of the two conventions the public can depend
upon The Call for the most complete '.ports, and
that this statement will be accepted as a fact and not
an idle boast there is not the slightest doubt. The
record has been made, the precedent established, and
is being lived up to day by day.
When events of great current interest are being
treated it is known that the news will not only be
printed, but that in laying it before the public there
will be the least possible delay. For instance, a spe
cial train was run to Sacramento yesterday carrying
The Call, so that the hundreds of people gathered
there from all parts of the State might learn what
wa^ being done in politics and get the information
as early as they got their breakfasts.
Such has been and is the policy. It is a winning
policy. It is appreciated. The congratulations of
friends have been numerous, and these are also appre
ciated. They can depend on having a continual op
portunity to extend further congratulations. Enter
prise and accuracy have passed the experimental
stage.
WHISPERING McNAB'S SQUELCHING.
UJ HEN "Whispering" Gavin McNab went to
â¢ Sacramento he carried with him a notion that
lie was to run the Democratic convention and
the preliminaries. He seems to have thought that his
domination of his funny committee of one hundred
could be extended to embrace the entire party. So,
naturally enough, Gavin ran against a snag.
While it is true that many old-line Democrats, im
pelled by a of disgust due to McNab's course,
have stayed away, some of them are there with pre
cariously balanced chips on their shoulders. One of
these is W. W. Foote. When Foote and the whisper
ing boss got together the chip on the former's shoulder
tell with a suddenness which attracted much atten
tion. The attorney called Ga\lÂ»i a liar and applied to
him other qualifying terms usually indicated in polite
journals by a series of dashes.
There are bosses who would have resented this, but
the whispering variety is different. Me Nab said the
question was one to be settled in the convention. To
attempt to dictate the policy of the convention is
none of our intent, but it does seem that there are
matters of greater public importance to be considered
just now than as to whether McXab is a liar and the
other things on Foote's picturesque list. This ought
to be of personal interest to himself, and to settle it
is clearly his own affair. Until it shall have been set
tled he ought to take a rest from the arduous labor of
running the Democratic party.
To look at the matter seriously it really has bearing
on the situation. Me Nab is not popular. His meth
ods have given rise to distrust. He has been trying
to sneak into a Congressional nomination, and his
lack of frankness has not been well received. Those
whom his whispers have wooed into line are inclined
to rebel, anyhow, and now to have the. self-made boss
characterized as a liar and fail to disprove it adds to
their discontent.
There is such a possibility as being too fresh. Per
haps this is what ails the imported, self-made boss
who has the nerve to try to run a party, but lacks the
nerve to more than feebly protest when publicly de
nounced as a liar.
When Judge Cook wished that God might have
mercy on the soul of a murderer just sentenced the
murderer responded by expressing a similar wish for
the spiritual part of the Judge. An exchange of
courtesies is always pleasing to observe.
A man arrested for robbery proves to be the same

to get out of the racket.

ROTTfINZI'S INDEPENDENCE.
THE proceedings of the Board of Supervisors
with reference to the Mayor's veto of the light
ing contract awarded to the Gas and Electric
Company were notable from the fact that they pre
sented Dr. Rdtbuui with an opportunity to declare
| his independence of yellow journalism. For some
I time past the Examiner has evidently been trying to
effect an "advertising" contract with this corporation
similar to the one formerly entered into with the
Southern Pacific Company, under which it drew from
the railroad treasury $22,000. No other construction
can be placed upon its motives, for it has assaulted
the electric monopoly at all points and has resorted
to every device known to it for bossing the Super
visors.
When Mayor Phelan vetoed the lighting contract
the yellow sheet apparently thought that at last it had
the corporation in the door. It promptly counted
noses and found that if Dr. Rottanri voted to sustain'
the veto the contract would be defeated. It thereupon
publicly informed the versatile doctor that unless he
supported its efforts to secure an "advertising" con
tract from the Gas and Electric Company it would
send him down to history as a boodler, a knave and a
bribe-taker.
Dr. Rottanzi's reply to this is reported as follows:
"I did not intend to come here at all to-day to
vote either way, as I had important private business
that needed my attention. But when I found out that
this newspaper, the Examiner, was trying to boss me,
I came to vote as I pleased, which is against the dic
tation of that sheet! It is thoroughly rotten to the
core. Who appointed it a dictator over me, an honest
man? The association of the Examiner's name with
my pwn is a stench in my nostrils. Who is the manag
ing editor of the dirty sheet? I would not care to
compare him to myself. I am a gentleman! If he
tries in future to impugn my motives in any way he
must settle personally with me!"
We trust the doctor will not persist in his deter
mination to hold the editor of the yellow sheet per
sonally responsible; that would infract the law, and
really the editor is not worth any such trouble. But
it is to be hoped he will persist in maintaining his in
dependence.
Newspaper bossism differs only from saloon boss
ism in that the former is if anything the more corrupt.
Why should Dr. Rottanzi assist the yellow boodler
in getting an "advertising" contract out of the Gas
and Electric Company? Perhaps he could have con
scientiously voted to sustain the Mayor's veto; it
appears to us that many of the points made by the
Mayor against the contract were worthy of considera
tion, and it may be possible that it was the doctor's
duty to vote to sustain it. But not at the risk of aid
ing the blackmailing schemes of yellow boodlers.
The Examiner once made a contract with the South
ern Pacific Company to keep silent at the rate of $1000
a month for thirty months, or during two Legisla
tures and a political campaign. It drew $22,000 and
broke silence, whereupon the railroad repudiated the
contract. The yellow sheet did not sue for the bal
ance, but immediately began abusing the corpora
tion, which it has continued to do ever since.
OUR CLfHty OGAINST TURKEY.
NOW that the war with Spain is over it has been
suggested in the East that we employ our army
and navy while they are in fighting trim to col
lect a little claim that we have against the Sultan of
Turkey and which he has emphatically refused to pay.
I< is believed that if Dewey's fleet were brought up
through the Suez Canal and Watson's squadron were
sent from the West Indies to combine with it, and
a joint displaj' of the two were made within gunshot
of the Turkish forts, the Sultan would see the claim
in a new light and pay it without further controversy.
The claim grew out of the destruction of certain
property belonging to an American mission at Har
poot in Armenia during the insurrection in that coun
try in 1895. It appears that a number of buildings,
consisting of a girls' seminary, a theological school
and five" dwellings, all belonging to Americans and
erected and maintained under treaty agreements with
the Sultan's Government, were looted and burned by
a Turkish mob. A claim for damages was made by
our Minister at Constantinople at once, and the mat
ter dragged along until recently, when, according to
reports, formal notice was given by the Turks that
they would not pay.
The Philadelphia Telegraph makes the moral of the
situation clear by pointing out that last year Austria,
by a naval demonstration at Mersina, enforced the
payment of an indemnity with the twenty-four hours
that were given the Sultan to render redress for in
dignities heaped upon the Austrian Consul at that
port. From that incident it draws the conclusion that
a similar demonstration by an American fleet at any
Turkish port would be equally effective, and that our
claim would be settled without war.
The New York and Express, recalling the
fact that other nations also have claims against Tur
key, suggests that they would be willing to co-operate
with the United States in forcing the Sultan to meet
his obligations. While that may be true it certainly
would not be advisable for us to seek that co-opera
tion. Such a policy would necessarily involve us to
some extent in the entangling meshes of the diplo
macy of the concert of Europe, and in the end that
would be probably be worse than a war.
The Washington Post, after a general review of
Turkish methods of late, maintains that the claim will
never be paid until the Government at Constantinople
becomes convinced that further delay will be danger
ous. The fact that the menace of Austria brought an
immediate settlement, while other powers that have
relied on diplomacy are still waiting, justifies this
conclusion.
We certainly have no desire for further war, but, as
the Post very justly says: "National dignity would
not be more compromised by the absolute surrender
of a just claim than by everlastingly pottering about
it with a power which will pay it only on compul
sion."
New York wants to have a naval review, and there
doe"; not seem any good reason why San Francisco
shouldn't have one too after the Philippines have
ceased from troubling and the fleet of Dewey is at
rest.
Gentlemen who are afraid to become members of
the Philippine commission lest they do something to
harm their political chances are almost too timid to be
good citizens.
Augusti is said to have lost the opportunity of
going down in history as a hero. He lost it when he
was born with a white liver.
Augusti and Blanco seem to belong to the variety
of rats capable of recognizing the situation when on
board a sinking ship.
Rochefort advocates American extension, which
is probably as heavy a single blow as the scheme has
received.
If any of those Cubans object to peace there is every

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 17, 1898.
rROM the Salt Lake Herald we learn that the
Silver Republicans of Utah have closed the
State headquarters which they opened a few
I weeks ago with the avowed intention of making an
active campaign of education in the cause of free sil
ver. â¢ The movement, though begun with a mighty
flourish of trumpets, found no support. Around the
headquarters there gathered no army. As a conse
| quence the field and the campaign have been aban
doned, and the chiefs "folded their tents like the
Arabs and silently stole away."
What is thus recorded in Utah i 9 but a part of a
movement that is going on all over the country. Free
silver coinage was even at its best a delusion merely,
and when the attempt was made to organize a Repub
lican free silver party the folly was carried to theverge
of madness. In the excitement arising out of the hard
times of the Democratic panic years and the confu
sion of remedies suggested for the evils of that dis
tressing period, a good many men who were other
wise loyal to the Republican party were led to aban
don it by reason of their infection with the free silver
mania. They marched with the Bryanites and made
the campaign with some show of ardor as the allies of
free traders, fiatists and calamity howlers, but got
nothing for their service except defeat and disaster.
Since that foolish break with the party to which
tlity naturally belong by reason of their abiding faith
in its policies of protection, internal improvements
and reciprocity of commerce, they have had two years
in which to meditate. They have Been the hard times
pass away, the prosperity of the country revive, in
dustry recover its profits and labor its wages, with
the gold standard unshaken; and from these things
they have learned the folly of the whole free silver
scheme. Thus the rank and file of the misled faction
are returning to the Republican camp. The free sil
ver chiefs open headquarters in vain. They have no
longer any support.
Even if there could be consistently and logically
any such thing as a free silver Republican there would
be no place for him in the politics of to-day. The free
silver movement has collapsed even more completely
than the movement for free trade. The nation has
gone forward. New issues have arisen, and the great
parties of the country are rapidly aligning themselves
on new fields of controversy. A Silver Republican
this year is not only a misnomer, but an anachronism.
The leaders of the misguided faction in Utah have
done wisely in closing their headquarters, and if good
judgment remains they will abandon all their schemes
for a campaign of education. They have themselves
much to learn before they begin to teach others, and
the first lesson is that of recovering from a blunder.
They have made a bad break in the past and should
now redeem the fnture by zealous service in the cause
of the grand old party of protection and sound
money.
ONE of the most striking features of the finan
cial condition of the United States at this
time is the extreme disproportion between the
rates of interest in the money centers of the country
and in the outlying communities. In New York
money is almost begging for borrowers, while in the
South and to a considerable extent in the West hardly
enough can be obtained at fair rates to carry on the
industry and commerce of the people.
President Hepburn of the New York Bankers'
Association, in an address at the annual meeting of
the association, suggested as a remedy for this coun
dition of affairs the' enactment of a law permitting
the establishment of branch banks, so that the great
monetary institutions of the financial centers would
be in close touch with the country at large and able
to advance funds wherever needed.
Such a system, it seems clear, would go far toward
equalizing interest charge: . throughout the Union,
and thus place the business men of smaller cities on
something like an equal footing so far as money mat
ters are concerned with those of the greater cities.
As Mr. Hepburn pointed out. if such banks were in
operation the funds which the big banks in New
York are now holding in idleness or which are beg-
I ging for investment at ,5 per cent or an even less rate
of interest would be employed in the West and South
at better rates, and the welfare of all sections of the
country would be advanced.
The issue is one over which there has been much
controversy, and even among the more progressive
reformers of our banking laws there is by no means a
unanimity of opinion on the subject. It i> feared by
some the right to establish branches would enable
i the great banking houses of the cities to crowd out
the small bankers of the country at large. Whether
these fears are well founded or not, it is certain some
\ thing should be done to equalize interest rates and
I put all sections of the Union as near as possible upon
the same monetary plane. As Mr. Hepburn said:
"A proper remedy for the evils complained of by the
South and West is not to be found by waging war
upon existing banks, but by the establishment of
I more. They need competition and greater facilities
for exchange."
Another important banking problem dealt with in
the address is that of providing for a stricter enforce
ment of the laws regulating the administration of
banks. Some striking statistics were given by Mr.
Hepburn showing the shameful facility with which
"bank criminals," as he called them, obtain pardons.
Strangely enough the record of the Federal Govern
ment in this respect is worse than that of the States,
and it appears that the average term served by bank
criminals has been but 51 per cent of the average
sentence; executive clemency having wiped out 49
per cent of the penalty imposed by the court. Mr.
I Hepburn adds:
"From data obtained it appears that the greatest
degree of leniency is extended to the 'Napoleons of
finance,' who, in the furtherance of some scheme of
speculation or in the indulgence of a desire for fash
ionable and expensive living, appropriate the funds
intrusted to them for safe keeping. The social posi-
I tion, friends and influence which these stolen funds
enable them to obtain seem to avail in obtaining a
I modification of their sentence. Surely this class sin
1 against greater light, and it is difficult to see wherein
i they are entitled to greater leniency than the brutal
burglar."
Whatever differences of opinion may exist concern
| ing the proposal for equalizing interest rates there
: will be none with respect to the demand for a stricter
enforcement of the law guarding bank funds. A few
people may object to branch banks, but all people are
! in favor of honest bankers.

A VANISMING FACTION.
SOME BANKING PROBLEMS.
MR. WARDALL TO MR, CATOR,
To the Editor of The Call: About July 30 .there was published in The
Call an article which had been published in the Los Angeles Herald pur
porting to be signed by a Mr. Carlson, and E. M. Wardall as chairman of
the State Committee of the Populist party. As this article was in the
main a personal attack upon myself and G. W. Baker, because I favored a
straight Populist ticket at Sacramento, I wrote to Mr. Wardall, reminding
him that I had openly declared myself in favor of straight party action
long before the convention, and that Mr. Baker was properly at the con
vention and asked to be there by the Silver Republican Committee, of
which he was chairman. Mr. Wardall writes me under date of August 7,
1898, and upon the subject of the statement purporting to be signed by him
he says:
"Your letter of the sth is received. In reply will say I had nothing
whatever to do with writing or publishing that letter of personal abuse of
yourself and Mr. Baker (published In the Herald). I never have used
such methods in the past and see no reason why the present time calls for
personal attacks on individuals. I never saw the article until It was pointed
out to me in the paper."
The article referred to by Mr. Wardall is so personal as to require no
notice at my hands, further than to point out Mr. Wardall's denial that
he signed it. . THOMAS V. CATOR.

A PASS COST MORRISON CHAMPAGNE AND CIGARS.
Lewis Morrison is playing at the Alcazar on percentage. Outside of
the local press the free list has been entirely suspended. This was the
ironclad agreement entered into when that venerable -tar commenced -his
engagement, and to bind the same Morrison pledged the management
a bottle Oi champagne if he issued a free admission during his season at
the Alcazar. Now it happened that on this particular day during the early
part of last week Mr. Morrison rang for a messenger to send to the cos
turner's for two wigs which he was having altered. He informed Manager
Thall the nature of the errand and what o tell the boy when he came
as he would bÂ« at rehearsal. In the meantime another boy called with a
card signed S and asking for a pass for two. To issue it being against
the rules of the house genial Mark not wishing to abruptly refuse the
request said:
"You will have to get Mr. Morrison's O. K. first."
The boy left the office, caught a glimpse of Mr. Morrison just leaving the
theater and hastened to him. The sage actor thinking that he was the boy
who was to go on the errand said:
"Oh, you are the boy, are you?"
The boy, half confused at the remark, replied:
"Y-e-sâ s-i-râ but â that gentleman in the office there said I would have
to get your O. K. first."
"Oh, very well," replied Mr. Morrison, so taking his card from his
pocket wrote on the back: "O. K. for two" and hurried on.
The youngster cashed the card at the box office for two seats. When
the tickets were counted that night the card bearing Morrison's name "O.
K. for two" came up. Here was Manager Thau's chance. Stepping to the
telephone he rang up a well-known wholesale wine house and told them to
send down at once, C. O. D., charged t~> Lewis Morrison, a quart bottle
of "extra dry." The champagne was brought in haste with the bill as
requested. Thall paid the price, took the receipted bill and the O. X.d
card, inclosed the same in an envelope and sent word for Mr. Morrison to
drop in the office before he went home. Presently in he came. There were
several g'.asses setting on the desk and the bottle of champagne stand
ing by. \
"Well, well," said Mr. Morrison, "Haw comes this?"
"Oh," said Mark, "a friend sent it."
"Well." said Mr. Morris^i, "let me send for some cigars."
So the office boy was summoned and sent for a small box of choice
Havana cigars. Wine and the forthcoming play took up the best part of
an hour of chat and enjoyment. At leave-taking Mr. Thall cashed up
with him for the week. Mr. Morrison counted it over. It was short.
"I believe we have made a mistake," said the actor.
"Oh, that reminds me," said Manager Thall, Vith a droll wink. "Here
Is a little bill I paid for you."
It was some moments before Morrison could see where any laugh came
in. He acknowledged the joke a good one, though the pass cost him the
champa:-- and cigars. MORTIMER WOOD.

vastly different course, and one which

agreeable truth .about the nation or about
some detail of its management But it

HORSEPOWERâ J. E. D., City. Horse
power is a term in mechanics used in ex
pressing the force of a motive power. It
is based on the assumption that horses In
general perform a certain constant
amount of work in a specified timeâ an as
sumption evidently erroneous. The fun- .
damental unit of work is the foot poun 1 ,,
but in measuring: the work of a horse by
this unit the most celebrated engineers
differ widely. BÂ«>ulton and Watt, basinK
their calculation on the work of London
drayhorses working eight hours a day.
estimated it at 33.000 foot pounds per min
ute. D'Aubisson, taking the work done by
horses in whims at Freiberg, estimated
the work at 16,440 foot pounds, working
eight hours a day. Desagulier's estimate
was 44.000. Smeaton's 22,iX)0 and Tread
gold's 27,500 foot pounds. Seventeen thou
sand four hundred is thought to be about
correct. It matters little, however, which
is used, provided the same be always
used; and. accordingly, the original esti
mate of "Watt is still counted a horse
power. Such power is designated as nomi
nal, indicated and actual. Nominal is
adopted and referred to by manufactur
ers of steam-engines in order to express
the capacity of an engine, the elements
thereof being confined to dimensions of
stf-am cylinder and a conventional pres
sure of steam and speed of piston. Indi
cated designate? full capacity in the cyl
inder as developed in operaton and with
out any deduction for friction. Actual
refers to its actual power as developed
by its operation, involving elements of
mean presure upon piston, its velocity
and a just deduction for friction of op-^
eratloil of the engine. In calculating the
power of a steam-engine in terms of
Watts unit the general rule Is to
multiply together the pressure in pounds
on a square inch of the piston the area
<>f the piston in inches, the length of the
stroke per minute. The result divided Tu
33,000 will give the horsepower, but nnc
tenth of the whole must be deducted as
an allowance for friction.

DELEGATES
Los Angeles Members
Aggrieved by Burkes
Indorsement.
Were Not Aware That the Cau
cus Was About to Be Held
on That Matter.
CALL- HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 16.â A howl of indigna
tion 'arose from a large number of
numbers of the Los Angeles County
delegation to-day, when they learned
that at the caucus held In the Senate
ChJÃunber this morning W. R. Burke
"was indorsed for the nomination for a
member of the Board of Equalization
from, the Fourth District.
Manyof the aggrieved ones claim they
â¢were not aware that a meeting was
contemplated, while those who attended
the caucus state that a sufficient 'ioti
fleation was given them by Vice Chair
man C. C. Wright Monday evening.
It appears that on Monday night the
initial caucus of the delegation was
held In the Assembly Chamber for the j
purpose of agreeing on a choice for the
honor of temporary chairman of the
Democratic convention which was to
convene the following day. The pro
ceedings began early and continued
late, and when Candidates Dockweiler j
and Patton had lauded each other after
it was decided that the former had been
nominated, over half the delegates
sprang for the door with a view of re
tiring.
A large number -were out of the hear
ing of Chairman Wright when he or- j
dered the delegates back to their s^ats j
to listen Â»o a resolution offered by a
member. . Some returned and partici
pated in the debate that followed. An :
amendment followed the motion, and
in the midst of a harangue a second
motion, to adjourn was made. In the
confusion more members slipped out.
The hour being late, it was thought
best to postpone action until the tired
delegates could rest themselves in
sleep; If was then decided to meet at
18:30 o'clock in the morning, but the
talking was so loud that few heard or
learned the result of the motion.
Promptly at 10:30 this morning
a handful of delegates arrived. At
I>>:4s a few stragglers were added to
the number, but even then there was
no- quorum. Dr. R. W. Hill called I
twenty-three members to order. It was j
;theri determined by those present to j
. transact the business that brought j
.- them there.
â¢ Shirley C. Ward then introduced the j
following resolution, which was adopt- |
ed:
.' Resolved, That we recognize and as del
â¢ecn.tes from Los Angeles County Justly
take pride in the eminent attainments j
. .and learning of Judge W. W. Hutton of :
â  pur county. We recognize his great fit
ness for a position upon the bench of
' the Supreme Court of this State. We re- j
".:.gard !t, however, as of primary import
â¢ance In the pending political crisis that
â  ".ho step should be taken that might even I
lii the slightest degree Jeopardize the !
â  chances of the fusion movement in th? |
riming campaign, and as Judge Van
Dyke, Silver Republican, candidate upon i
the fusion ticket, is also from Los Angtâ \
lea County and has already received the â 
indorsement of the Populist convention j
for one of the two places to be filled uy>on |
the Supreme Bench at the coming elec
. tjon. and as the selection by the Demo- j
crats of Los Angeles County of Judge !
Hutton for the other remaining place |
upon the bench might be construed as ;
'. Inimical to the candidacy of Judge Van !
I>yk.- and prejudicial to the cause of fu- j
slon, we therefore refrain from submit- |
ting to the convention the name of
Judge Hutton as a candidate for the high
Office. We regret exceedingly that cxi
â  gencies of the occasion seem to render j
injudicious any attempt to nominate at i
this time Judffc Hutton for the Supreme
Bench. But we take this opportunity to
publish to tho people of tho State our !
entire confidence in Judgo Hutton's flt
. ness for the high honor in qupstlon, and
to. pledge ourselves as individuals to
.further Judge Hutton's Interests at all j
times In the future in that direction.
Earl Rogers then brought on a live
ly tilt by asking those present to in
dorse R. Y. MeÃride for State Printer. |
As the indorsement carried with it the j
81 votes of the delegation, some of the
.members demurred to taking action in
the matter, although favorable to hi 3
candidacy, until more members were
in attendance. A motion to table the
resolution was made and lost, and on
a vote being taken it was unanimously
agreed to give him the indorsement, as
it would aid him in gaining the covetod
. honor at the hands of the convention.
Major Burkes friends thought It an
â¢ I'portune moment to launch his name
upon the political ocean, and In a nr>
ment a proposition was offered to in
dorse his candidacy. The motion was
and carrie-l, although throe mem
-â hers emphasized the word "No" in vot
ing against the resolution. The cauf-us
then adjourned, and the news of its
action immediately spread among the j
.absent delegates. The indignant mem
bers expressed their disapproval on the
"snap Judgment," as they termed it.
The dissatisfied delegates will try and j
remedy the "action of the fellow mem- i
bers by asking for a reconsideration of I
the indorsement. A strong fight will
be made by the major's foes to down
him, but his friends propose to stand
by him: The delegation will hold an
executive caucus to-morrow morning
in the rooms of the Supreme Court li
brary.

ceedingly animated conference in the
rooms of th<? secretary of the State
Board of Agriculture in the Pavilion dur
ing the recess of the convention to en
ajble.Governor Budd to appoint theeom
mittees on credentials and order of
business. Besides the Governor, there
. were present, among others. Chairman
Alford, Frank Gould, Gavin McNab,
John r. Dunn. Major Harney, M. F.
Tarpey. W. W. Foote, Joseph Dwyer
and General Barrett.
Both factions were guarding their
Interests and naturally there was bound
to be more or less loud talk. Both in
sisted upon aiding the Governor in
making his selections. The real trouble
began when the Harney forces offered
M. F. Tarpey for chairman of the cre
dentials committee. There was a roar
from the McNab camp. Governor
Hudd was patient, however, and an
nounced that it was his determination
to appoint a non-partisan committee
so far as lay in his power. Foote
routed the idea of a non-partisan
committee.
He declared there were not fifteen
men in the convention who had not
. lined up on one side or the other.
Gould agreed to that, which was re-
markable as being the sole point upon
which the two factions are of one opin
ion. Then Governor Budd suggested
that each side submit the names of
five of their stanchest supporters and
he would select five non-partisans.
This was not satisfactory and then
somebody proposed that Harney and
McNab each submit nine names for the
Governor's consideration. This suited
Governor Budd, but he announced that
he would not be restricted in h.3 selec
tions to the two lists, but would go
outside for us many names as he
wanted.
Then the wrangle over Tarpey broke
out in earnest. McNab and Gould ob
jected to the Alamedan being upon the
committee at all on account of his ag
gressiveness against them, and they
appealed to Budd not to appoint him.
W. W. Foote invaded the enemy's
lines in the excitement attending his
declaration that Tarpey had fought the
McNab faction on every possible oc
sion and would continue to do so to
the end.
Turning to the Governor Foote de
clarer that Tarpey's name would head
Harney's list, and he demanded that he
be placed on the committee. Then Har
ney and McNab went to work on their
respective lists and the temperature
cooled off perceptibly, x oote, Tarpey,
Gould and others withdrew, and after
the two lists had been handed in Gov
ernor Budd was left alone to consider
them. Seven names on McNab's list
appear on the committee, while Tarpey,
who headed Harney's list and who
Foote demanded be placed on the com
mittee, was ignored.
SENATOR SEAWELL
OUT OF THE RACE
Continued from First Page.
fortunately for the interested specta
tor, convention declarations are fre
quently overdrawn to suit the occasion
of those who listen to them. In this
case it is paid that far from being pa
cified the feeling between the gentle
men and their respective friends is
more bitter than ever before. It is also
said that Whispering Gavin McNab,
who lost his first move in the deep
game he is playing when Dockweiler
defeated Patton in the Los Angeles
delegation for the privilege of becoming
the delegation's nominee for the posi
tion of temporary chairman of the con- J
ver.tion, is fanning the flame between
them for some purpose of his own. This
purpose will be made apparent when
Patton is made chairman of the com
mittee on platform, when such a com
mittee is appointed, after the perma
nent organization of the convention.
Patton has been slated for the chair
manship of this committee by McNab,
whose purpose for doing so is only too
apparent. The committee on platform
will have in charge the task of build
ing a platform that will conform in all
essential particulars with the Populist
platform to which it is required that
the Democratic nominee for Governor
shall subscribe. It is decreed that in
the event that the Democratic nominee j
for Governor does not subscribe to the I
platform as required he will not be
given the Populist nomination. This
latter contingency is not, from the Ma
guire standpoint, to be considered for a
moment. So it is that Mr. Patton and
his associates will be called upon to
perform the delicate task of making
the Democratic platform appear like a
Populist platform.
Something of what is expected of the j
convention may be gathered from the j
remarks of Chairman Alford of the j
State Central Committee when he called j
the conventftm to order this afternoon.
He said that he expected the convention
to recognize the great Democratic prin
ciple that the minority must be gov
erned by the will of the majority. It is
true that he made no reference to such
a condition as might be presented by a
majority that was actuated by impure
motives, but he may have thought that
this view of the case must be apparent
to all but the very slow minds among j
the 700 and odd delegates. Then, again,
he was just fresh from a conference at
the Golden Eagle Hotel, at which he
had been forced to surrender some of
his pet plansâ a surrender which forced j
him to see the installation of Governor
Budd as chairman of the convention, i
Hise side-partner and co-conspirator,
"Whispering" Gavin McNab, had also j
run up the white flag at the same time; j
but the humiliation of the "Whispering i
Boss" was not yet complete. He was
forced to sit in the convention hall and j
listen to the reading of a resolution in
troduced by M. F. Tarpey of Alameda,
which resolution, if adopted, as it is
reasonable to presume it will be, will
put an end to representation by proxy
in the State Central Committee.
Heretofore McNab's power on the
State Committee has been due in a
great measure to his ability to corral
the proxies of the members who reside
outside of San Francisco. With this
prop pulled from under him the whis
pering boss will cut no great figure in
the councils of the State Central Com
mittee than honest members who are
so deluded as to remain firm in the be
lief that it is their duty as citizens and
Democrats to accept a place in the
councils of the governing body of the
party.
While McNab is having contumely
heaped upon him Alford seems to have
reserved for himself some few but bar
ren honors. Chief among these is the
placing in nomination of the man
whom the Democrats believe will be
the next Governor of the State of Cali
fornia. It has finally been decided that
the chairman of the expiring State Cen
tral Committee will be the one to place
the name of James G. Maguire before
the convention. As Alford is a good
speaker he will no doubt do credit to
himself and to the gentleman whom he
nominates.
Senator White will second the nomi
nation, and the delegates to the con
vention will be treated to a class of
oratory that h*s found favor at the
national capital. Senator White and
Judge Maguire have been friends from
childhood, and some time ago the Sena
tor expressed the wish to occupy a
place on the floor of the convention
hall when he might thus have the op
portunity to express his regard for his
life-long friend And political associate.
His address and that of Chairman Al
ford will be the chief events of the day
on which nominations are made. Sen
ator White arrived *-->re this evening,
but as he was not feeling well sought
the quiet of his own apartments at the
Golden Eagle Hotel and sent word to
all callers that he was not able to see
any of them.

14 The selection of the State Central

large to be appointed by every guberna
torial nominee; two from each Congres
sional district, to be elected by the dele
gates to the Congressional convention in !
even numbered years; one from each As- .
sembly district comprising a county or j
less than a county, to be elected by the :
delegates to the first Democratic State j
convention held in even numbered years,
providing that any county forming a part
of an Assembly district shall be entitled
to a membership of the committee."
The members of the State General Com
mittee must be selected by the members
of each county or Assembly district or
Congressional district and reported to the
State convention before final adjourn
15Â° From the members of the executive
eommitt<=>e of the State Central Committee
there shall be appointed a sub-committee
of five persons, who shall perform the du
ties required by the provisions of an act
to promote the purity of elections by reg
ulating the conduct thereof, etc. Ap
proved February 23, 1893, and when said
committee is named the chairman and
secretary of this convention shall certify
to the same as required by law.
From the first it was apparent that the
members of the committee were deter
mined to prevent a recurrence of the fight
for the control of the San Francisco dele
gation that crops up in every Democratic
State Convention. All the members but
R. M. Fitzgerald were in attendance, and
during part of the session Governor Budd,
Judge Maguire and other party leaders
were there.
Before the convention settled down to
business Barcar opened against thÂ«; sys
tem of voting proxies in the State Central
Committee. He announced that for his
part he wanted some plan adopted for the
reorganization and control of that body if
SossTble. As long as the members from
an Francisco and the immediate vicinity
wore permitted to send o\>t letters to the
country delegates and secure their proxies
this trouble in the metropolis would recur.
Every time a Democratic State conven
tion met. Barcar declared, San Francisco
had a fight on hand for the control of her
delegation, and the Democrats of the
State at large were getting tired of this
constant washing of her dirty linen in
public. He declared the present contest
was directly due to the system of country
members by proxy, whereby a few were
enapled to appoint the committee of nine
which evolved a plan whereby the Demo
crats of San Francisco were denied tne
right to select their delegates to the State
convention. It was suggested that the
resolutions introduced in the convention
In the afternoon by Tarpey and Heney
were calculated to obviate that trouble
by abolishing proxies, but still it vas the
unanimous sentiment of those present
that the committee should present a pro
gramme to the convention for the reor
ganization of the State Central Com
mittee.
Governor Budd entered the room Just
as Dockweiler called the meeting to or
der. Just as the roll was called, R. W.
Hill moved to report to the convention,
making the temporary officers of the body
permanent. Budd asked that some one
else be named for permanent chairman
and asked that Judge Maguire be con
sulted on the subject. Budd's name was
included in the resolution, only to bo
taken down just before the committee
adjourned, and that of Cassin substi
tuted.
Chairman Dockweiler then took up the
two resolutions offered by Tarpey and
Heney and this precipitated a debate
that occupied the greater part of the
evening and resulted in the adoption of a
set of rules governing the State Central
Committee, which was embodied in that
section of the report relating to the re
organization of that body.
Barcar opened the engagement with a
fresh denunciation of the prevailing
methods and Camlnetti quickly rallied to
his support, when Dockweiler made the
remark that McNab had Informed him
that the Democrats could not hold an
honest primary in San Francisco.
Camlnetti sprang to his feet in a rage
and denounced the statement as a lie and
a slander. It waa the bosses, he assert
ed, who were responsible for the present
condition.
Ashe, McCarthy and others Joined In
the denunciation of McNab's methods
and the committee set resolutely to work
to provide for the reorganization of the
State Committee. The plan agreed upon
rendered It unnecessary to take action
on the two resolutions.
Just before the committee adjourned
Chairman Dockweiler announced that
Governor Budd requested that Mr. Cas
sin of Santa Cruz be made permanent
chairman.
He said It was in accordance with Judge
Maguire's wishes. Without discussing
the matter the committee took the action
requested. -<P

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 16.â
The fact that eight members
out of fifteen on the committee
on credentials will report in fa

the State Convention will have
no especial weight in my judg
ment before the convention Itself
to-morrow.
As an offset a minority report
will be submitted. The crntest
will be resumed on the floor of
the convention to-morrow and
the full facts brought forth. I
am loth to believe that the rep
resentatives of the Democratic
party o California will sanction
the attempt of a few men to pro
claim themselves the Demo
cratic party of San Francisco.
The management of local politi
cal organizations should as a
matter of right rest with the
voters of such local organization
and I am satisfied that the con

BREACH AMONG DEMOCRATS.
Split in Los Angeles Between Fusion
and Anti-Fusion Factions.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 16.â The turning
down of George S. Patton, the McNab-
Gould-Alford candidate for temporary
chairman of the State convention, caused
considerable excitement among the Demo
crats of this county to-day. It has re
sulted In a breach between the fusion and
anti-fusion factions of the party which it
will be Impossible to heal at this time.
Patton is a fire-eater, and once his ire is
aroused he will be out for revenge. This,
however, is not the first time he has met
his Waterloo on the field of politics, and
the wounds he received In 1896, when he
was defeated for the nomination for Con
gressman in the Sixth District, have not
yet healed. At that time he was opposed
by John W. Mitchell and his followers,
and the sensational passing of Mitchell
from the Democratic County Convention
held here last week and the seating of a
negro in his stead is said to have been
brought about solely for the purpose of
humiliating Mitchell in the eyes of the
people and to avenge Patton's defeat for
Congress.
There Is another feature connected with
j Pattons failure to hold the delegates
i from this county that Is giving: him much
concern. Patton ia again ambitious to
shine in the halls of Congress, and his
i first defeat at the hands of a Congrea
j slonal convention has not dampened his
I ardor nor caused him to lose any of his
! self-assurance. He is after the Demo
j cratic and fusion nomination for Con
; gress, and is eager to enter the field
against Water, the probable Republican
nominee, and Barlow, the nominee of the
! Populist party. His loss of the temporary'
; chairmanship of the convention Is, there
j fore, a sad blow to his ambition, as it
' shows his weakness in the delegation and
I points to the defeat of his desires.
The Republican County Central Com
mittee met at Foresters' Hall in this city
to-day, Bradner Lee presiding. The meet
ing was held for the purpose of making
provision for holding the county conven
tion and tc fix a time for the holding of
caucuses and primaries. The time for
holding the convention was at first fixed
I for September 5. H was afterward learn
i ed that the date named was a State holi
day especially set apart for the laboring
classes, so out of respect for the laboring
man the matter waa reconsidered and the
date fixed for September 12.
A strong effort was made to hold the
convention at Santa Monica, and as an
Inducement the people of that place had
subscribed $1000 to defray the expenses of
the convention if held at that place. The
offer was rejected and a committee ap
pointed to secure a hall in this city. The
caucuses are to be held Thursday. Sep
tember 8, and the primaries Saturday,
September 10.
As there will be 743 delegates In the con
vention it is expected that the entire
week will be consumed in doing the work
that 1b to come before it.
To-day the sad-eyed striker lingers
about the corridors of the Hollejjbeck
awaiting the return of him who maketh
the striker glad, but he cometh not, fir
his seat of conflict has been transferred
to the Palace Hotel at San Francisco.
With the departure of Henry T. Gage,
the Republican candidate for Governor,
on the 11:15 train to-day, his headquar
ters In the Hollrnbeck were deserted, and
the busy times of the last two weeks are
now a thing of the past. His lieuten
ants will, however, attend to the keeping
in line of such delegates as are suspect
ed of possessing a desire to break the
programme should a strong man from t.ie
ncrth be mentioned for Governor and an
assu-ance given that the United States
Senator wil be from the south. It will
require close watching on their fajTt to
keep some of the delegates from escap
ing, as they anticipate doing, and It will
rot be surprising to learn of a break at
any time. N. Blackstock of Ventura, Re
publican candidate for Railroad Commis
sioner in the Third District, Is milking
a strong canvass among the delegates
from this county. He speaks encour
agingly of the result of his work all
over the State. His opponent is F. M.
Mattison of Santa Cruz.
BUTTE MEN FOR* MAGUIRE.
Pledged Him Their Support in Cau-
cvs â Other Selections.
OALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 16.â The Butte County
delegates caucussed immediately after
arriving here this morning and elected
Senator A. F. Jones chairman. After a
spirited discussion lasting over an hour
they decided to adopt the unit rule.
The merits of the several candidates
were considered and on the first ballot
the entire delegation was pledged to
Maguire. It was also decided to sup
port Beamer for the State Board of
Equalization, La Rue for Railroad Com
missioner, De Vries for Congress, Green
for State Treasurer and Andrews for
Attorney General.
It was the sense of the caucus that no
definite action be taken one way or the
other in the matter of the contest from
San Francisco. It was thought advisa
ble to leave that fight open until after
the committee on credentials makes its
report. The unit rule will not be ap
plied on the ballot on that contest.
Some of the members are strongly in
clined towaru tne Harneyites.
JUDGE GRANT IN LINE.
Many Friends Press His Claims for
Nomination to the Supreme
Bench.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, Sacramento,
Aug. 16.â Among the gentlemen at thÂ«
convention is Judge W. H. Grant of Tolo.
The Judge is an aspirant for nomination
to the Supreme bench, and has many
friends on the floor. He is well-known
as the presiding officer at the trial of thÂ«
Southern Pacific strikers, and it was he
who passed sentence on Worden. The
Judge Is doing a little quiet work and
hlÂ» supporters affirm that there is no
body more directly in line for a stroke of
lightning.
We take pleaiiure In calling- attention to tho
establishment In buÃlneas of a new hay and
grain firm. Albert S. Evans, son of the late
Colonel Albert 8. Evans, who was well and
popularly known among the journalistic pro
fesston ft few years ago, has formed a co
partnership with Messrs. Bars and Kleen, who
nave already gained the confidence and es
teem of a host of friends and business ac
quaintances. The new firm will be known as
Harg Kleen A Evans, and their warehouse
and office Is located at 62* Seventh street, tele
phone South 831, and we are confident In pre
dicting a sound and successful business career
for them.
A ROW IN
THE SIXTH
Populists Declare That
Congressman Barlow
Must Retire.
Colonel J. R. Berry and C.
S. Patton Named as
Available Candidates.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 16.â There is a very
lively row going on in the Sixth Con
gressional District, and Congressman
Barlow, who was renominated by the
Populists under the terms of the fusion
agreement, will either have to be taken
off the ticket or suffer certain defeat.
Several of the Populists who were on
the fusion committee are up in arms
against him, and declare that he will
have to retire. They say that the let
ters written by him and introduced in
evidence in the Brooks suit have for
ever killed him politically.
They affirm that unless he withdraws
and allows the Democrats to nominate
a Congressman who will be satisfactory
to the Populists there is nothing more
certain than that the Sixth District will
go overwhelmingly Democratic. The
Populistsâ or at least several of the
most prominent â are complaining of
the way in which Barlow secured a re
nomination. vÂ» â  -dell, his private secre
tary, reported to the district delegates
that the renomlnation of Barlow was
part of the fusion programme.
That any such agreement was en
tered into is denied by several mem
bers of the fusion committee. They
admit that the district was conceded to
the Populists, but deny that it was part
of the programme that Barlow was to
be the nominee. George S. Patton, who
was turned down yesterday by the sup
porters of Isadore Dockweiler, and
Colonel John R. Berry of the Seventh
Volunteer Regiment have been sug
gested as available candidates to fill
the vacancy. Either of them would be
satisfactory to the people. Patton says
that under no circumstances would he
accept nomination in the event of Bar
low withdrawing.
Mr. Barlow met the committee of
Silver Republicans and Democrats who
waited upon him, and quite an ex
tended conference was held. The most
friendly feeling was exhibited by the
gentlemen who waited unon Mr. Bar
low. They gave him to understand that
they came to him not as enemies but to
make a statement. If after they had
been heard he still insisted that he was
justified in standing as the candidate
in the Sixth Congressional District they
would have nothing further to say.
After listening to the committee and
the statement as to why he was not a
strong candidate in the Sixth District,
Mr. Barlow replied that he could not
agree with the committee. He thought
that if anything he was stronger before
the people of his district than he was
two years ago. In any event, he said,
he was entitled to a renomrnation as a
vindication of his record. He claimed
that even if he was defeated this con
sideration should be shown to him. He
was firm and insistent in his determi
nation to remain in the field, and the
committee, being convinced that noth
ing could be done, left.
GAVIN SCORCHED
AND ROASTED
Continued From First Page.
been accorded seats on the floor of the
convention and a position on the tem
porary roll call, were allowed by the
Governor to retain this advantage, if
advantage it could be called. He then
appointed a committee on credentials
composed of fifteen members, eight of
whom were known to be McNab parti
sans, six Harney partisans and one
simply a Democrat.
This last was Judg Fletcher A. Cut
ter, formerly of Humboldt, now of Del
Norto. He was named as chairman
of the committee. At the time Gov
ernor Budd named the committee the
leaders of both factions were present
and the Governor there stated that It
â was his desire to do nothing that
would change the status of the parties,
and that it was his intention to- name
a committee which he knew in ad
vance would return to the convention
a majority and a minority report.
This, he said, would be the question
open for the convention to decide and
as the convention was the executive
body as well as the representative body
of the State Democracy, he believed
that this course was right and proper.
The committee met to-night and lis
tened to the claims of the respective
contestants. The entire evening was
consumed in the performance of this
duty. When the arguments were
closed the committee, as had been pre
dicted by the Governor, made out a ma
jority and minority report. The ma
jority report favored the seating of the
delegation of the committee of one hun
dred and was signed by eight of
the committeemen. The minority
report favored the seating of the
Harney delegation and was signed by
six of the committeemen. Chairman
Cutler refused to sign either report.
Both reports will be presented to the
convention to-morrow morning and
there the battle will be fought out on
the floor. McNab's followers claim to
have a majority of the delegation in
their favor and confidently predict the
acceptance of the majority report when
the question is put to vote. However
this may be it will not change in the
least the fact that was demonstrated
by McNab's failure to control the or
ganization of the convention. In this
he was defeated and his defeat was
as overwhelming as it will be lasting.
What the convention decides to do with
the contesting delegations from San
Francisco will be decided on the propo-
Bltlon of the nower of the Democratic
State Committee to take charge of the
government of the San Francisco
Democracy, and not upon any claims
that McNab may have set up to the
right of dictatorship.
If the convention decides that the
State Committee had this power, then
the majority report of the committee
on credentials will be accepted. If it
decides that It had not the power, then
the minority report will be accepted.
Late this evening Governor Budd
again made his hand felt In the pres
ent dispute between the factions in
the Democratic party. He appeared be
fore the committee on organization and
order of business, then in session in the
parlors of the Golden Eagle Hotel, and
asked that his name be taken off the
report of the committee then being pre
pared in the place*where the report rec
ommended to the convention that the
temporary officers of the convention
be made the permanent officers of the
convention.
The Governor declared that he would
decline to serve as permanent chair
man, for the reason that should he do
so he would then have to appoint a
committee on resolutions and platform,
which committee he exnected to return
to the convention a resolution com
mending his administration as Gov
ernor f the State of California. He
declined, he said, to be placed in so |
embarrassing a position, and he de
sired, therefore, that some one else be
selected to act as permanent chairman.
The committee declined 10 entertain
the Governor's request, and several
gentlemen prominent in the affairs of
the party were called in for a confer
ence. The Governor insisted on his po
sition, but said that if his request were
acceded to he would retain the position
of presiding officer until after the dis
pute between the consisting San Fran- j
clsco delegations was finally deter
mined by the convention.
This proposition proved acceptable
to Judge Maguire and at his solicita
tion and that of others the committee
on credentials consented to take Gov
ernor Budd's name from its report. Be- I
fore this was done, however, it was I
agreed that Charles M. Cassin should
be selected as the permanent chairman.
Governor Budd stated to-night that
he would not allow either the delega- i
tion of the committee of one hundred j
or the Harney delegation seats on the \
floor of theconvention hall until after the
convention itself had finally decided |
which of the two contestants was en
titled to the seats as the true and only i
representative body of the San Fran
cisco Democracy.
This decision will be a hard blow to
the McNab forces, as they had con
fidently expected to have a voice In the !
settlement of the dispute by reason ;
of the fadt that the names of their j
delegation had been placed on the tern- I
porary roll. This would have given |
â¢ them a solid block of 154 votes, a fact j
that would have very materially af
fected a final determination of the dis
pute.
So it Is that to-night every delegate
present here in Sacramento knows that
the erstwhile "Whispering Boss" has
been shorn of his power and that his ;
personality and his peculiar political
methods will ere long cease to be the
hope of political tricksters and mer
cenary office seekers.
A REPRESENTATIVE BODY.
James G. Maguire Praises the Make-
Up of the Convention.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 16.â Tfie convention in
its preliminary work has shown its en
tire freedom from the control of cor
porate and other private interests and
its earnest zeal for Democratic prin
ciples.
The unfortunate and false position in
which Mr. Dockweiler was placed by
the support of railroad representatives
and agentÃ in his candidacy for the
chairman of the convention was a most
trying ordeal for him, out of which it
must be said he has come not only hon
orably, but with his reputation for in
tegrity and moral stamina considera
bly increased.
It was a splendid test and proof of
the independence of the convention
that notwithstanding his high char
acter and the confidence reposed in
him personally a large majority of the
delegation would not at all consider
his candidacy because of the support
given him in his delegation by the
representatives of the Southern Pacific
Company.
It was well understood that Mr.
Dockweiler was as little subject to
railroad influence as his opponent, Mr.
Patton, and that the railroad company
did not support him because of its de
sire for his election but solely because
of its desire to defeat Patton. Yet it
was 500,.n manifest that even this neg
ative support rendered hi 3 candidacy
inexpedient before the convention.
This is but an illustration of the spirit
manifested by the convention in every
thing. It is apparently a truly repre
sentative body of what is popularly
called the "New Democracy."
The San Francisco contest has been
referred to a fair and strong commit
tee upon which both sides have been
given representation, and I am satisfied
that after a full and fair hearing the
convention will deal with the question
of the local organization of the Demo
cratic party in a manner that will give
general satisfaction to the Democrats
of San Francisco.
I do not care to discuss the proposed
platform of the convention. I have, of j
course, been consulted by leading mem
bers of the convention concerning
many of its proposed planks. As to the
new charter of the city and county of
San Francisco I think I am justified in
saying that the platform will declare
in favor of its ratification by the Legis
lature: that it will indorse the admin
istration of Governor Budd, and that
it will deal strongly with the question
of railroad monopoly and extortion is
certain. JAMES Q. MAGUIRE.

BARLOW IS
IN DANGER
Strained Relations Be
tween Populists and
Nathan Cole Jr.
He Says That the Congress
man Would Have to Explain
Too Mnch.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, . t. 16.â The question as to
whether or not Charles A. Barlow mall
receive the Democratic indorsement as
the candidate for Congress in the Sixth
District became a very important issue
this evening.
For a time it looked as though the
fusion programme was at stake and
that there was more than a possibility
that the arrangement fixed up in July
between the Silver Republicans and
Populists might be a labor lost.
When the Populist leaders, including
E. M. Wardell, Barlow's private sec
retary and chairman of the State Com
mittee heard of the effort that was be
ing put forth to secure Barlow's with
drawal, he became very angry and de-
I nounced the move and the Silver Re
i publicans and Democrats who were be
hind it in unqualified terms. He said
that the railroad company was behind
the move, and declared that Mr. Bar
low would remain in the race to the
i end with or without Democratic ap
| proval. He went so far as to state that
! if Barlow was not indorsed fusion on
{ the State ticket was at an end.
While Chairman Wardell is not the
I entire Populist party, still he has con
siderable influence in its ranks. A meet
ing of Populist State eommitteemen
. was called for 10 p. m. at the State
House Hotel.
Word was sent to Nathan Cole Jr.,
the Silver Republican member of the
fusion committee, to present himself
and show cause why he should not be
! censured for avowing sentiments an-
I tagonistic to the candidacy of Mr. Bar
low, and for that reason be debarred
from further association with Populist
I confreres.
Mr. Cole, in reply to this pointed in
vitation, sent back word that he did
not propose to put himself before any
Populist committee to explain any act
he had performed or any position he
had taken. Inasmuch as Mr. Cole was
a very important factor in running the
Populist State Convention that met
here July 12, the severing of pleasant
relations between himself and the Pop
ulist committee was rather remark
able.
Cole finally consented to confer with
the Populists, and at 10 p. m. presented
himself at the State House Hotel. The
meeting proceeded behind closed doors.
Before entering Mr. Cole made the
following statement of his position to
The Call:
"I am not personally antagonistic to
I Mr. Barlow's ambition. On the other
; hand I think that he has made the best
i Congressman our district has had dur
ing my fourteen years' residence in Los
Angeles. But I have thought for a year
past that some strong Democrat should
be gH'en the Congressional nomination
this year. The Populists have had two
members in the past six years. Mr.
Barlow's candidacy before the people
is also impaired. In a legal complica
tion arising between Mr. Barlow and
J. Marion Brooks some letters were
made. public which place Barlow in an
unfortunate light. He would be com
pelled to explain the letters and a cam
paign of explanation is seldom success
ful. For these reasons I have taken the
position I have with regard to Mr. Bar
low."
It was after midnight when the di
recting spirits of the Populist party
adjourned their conference with Mr.
Cole. At the break-up the announce
ment was made that the era of good
feeling between the Silver Republicans
and Populists had been resumed, and
differences as to Mr. Barlow's candi
dacy settled.
The entire situation with regard to
Barlow's pr>s; ects for an election was
reviewed. Mr. Barlow strongly urged
that^hls record was, in his opinion,
strong enough to carry him back to
Washington.
His Populist friends agreed with him,
and thereupon Mr. Cole waived his ob
jections to Barlow's remaining in the
fight, and announced that as Barlow
wished to make the race he would sup
port him for the nomination and at
the polls.
Thus closed an incident which for a
time threatened to overturn fusion, and
which had it proceeded much further,
would have thrown the combination
into indescribable disorder.

MENTO, Aug. 17. â Governor Budd, when

IRRESISTIBLE
CHARGE OF
AMERICANS
Losses on Botl) Sides Be
lieved to Y}ave Been
Heavy.
Report Tfyat the Insurgents tfave
MutiQied and Attached Mer
ritt's Troops.
MANILA, Aug. 13 (via Hong
kong, Aug. 16). â A little after 8
o'clock this morning Admiral
Dewey sent a messenger to Cap
tain General Augusti to demand
the surrender of the city. The
admiral gave the Spanish com
mander one hour in which to
comply with the demand, and
told him if the city was not sur
rendered by that time he would
bombard it.
General Augusti refused to
capitulate, and at 9:30 o'clock the
signal was set on the Olympia di
recting the squadron to open fire.
Almost instantly the guns of the
warships began to shell the town,
and their fire was kept up for two
hours. Then the American troops
ashore stormed the Spanish
trenches, sweeping all before
them.
The Colorado troops first
stormed the outer trenches and
drove the enemy back to their
second line of defenses. Then the
Americans swept the Spaniards
into the walled city, where the
commander, seeing further resist
ance useless, hoisted the white
flag and surrendered.
The losses on either side are
unknown, but it is feared they are
large. The Spanish intrenched
forces numbered 3000 men, while
the Americans attacking num
bered 10,000 men. The latter
were better armed, better trained
and better conditioned.
Foreign ships in Manila Bay
watched the bombardment with
close interest. The American
ships engaged were the Olympia,
Petrel, Raleigh, Hugh McCul
lough, Boston, Monterey,
Charleston and Baltimore.
The Spaniards say the Ameri
can fire mostly fell short. The
only effective fire was from a
small gunboat close to the shore
that was armed with quick-firing
guns. They also assert the Amer
icans lost heavily in storming the
defenses, owing to the con
struction of these intrenchments,
which the Spaniards commanded
from the heights, from which
they poured a galling fire on the
Americans.
The Spanish trenches extended
around Manila at a distance of
from two to four miles from the
walled city. The circle was ten
miles in circumference. It was
impossible to hold so long a line
against the American attack.
It is understood Admiral
Dewey and General Merritt is
sued orders to spare all but the
armed defenses, consequently the
town was little damaged.
There has been some street
fighting between the insurgents
and the Spanish in the outskirts,
..but good order is maintained
within the walled city.
When the white flag was
hoisted Captain General Augusti
jumped into a German launch
that was waiting for him and was
conveyed to the German cruiser
Kai serin Augusta, which sailed
EIGHT AMERICANS KILLED
AND FIFTY WOUNDED
HONGKONG, Aug. 16. â Advices received here to-day
stated that considering the heavy fire which they had been un
der, the American loss was slight.
Eight were killed and fifty wounded and all the ships escaped
injury. Rear Admiral Pewey has raised the blockade, the shops
have reopened and there is a great feeling of relief among the peo
ple of the city.
for Hongkong before the bom
bardment was concluded.
INSURGENTS FOUGHT
BESIDE THE AMERICANS
Spaniards Unable to Withstand the
Assault of the Allied
Forces.
LONDON, Aug. 17.â The Manila cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph,
telegraphing Saturday, says: "Nothing
could be more humane than the Ameri
cans' capture of the town of Manila.
General Merritt and Admiral Dewey's
plan was to spare every object but the
armed defenses and the trenches. Ap
parently the American losses were ex
tremely small. The Spanish entrench
ments varied in point of distance from
two to four miles from the center ot
Old Manila.
"Defending this long line of at least
ten miles were not over â and probably
under â 5000 Spanish regular troops,
volunteers and natives. About half that
number were in the hospital. The at
tacking force numbered from 10,000 to
20,000 natives and 10,000 Americans on
shore and the fleet.
"In every respect the advantage was
on the side of the attack. The Ameri
can field guns threw heavier metal and
had longer range than the Spanish; the
marksmanship of the United States
gunners was much superior to that of
the Spaniards and the men were
stronger and in better condition. The
Spaniards are a small race compared !
with their stalwart opponents, and
worn out by a hundred days' siege and
disappointment over the non-arrival of
the promised Spanish relief squadron,
they had lost heart. It was a hopeless
struggle.
"Looking over the bay, it was curious
to notice the foreign fleets arrange
themselves according to their sympa
thies. The English and Japanese were
near the Americans and the Germans
and French on the opposite sides of the
bay. north of the Pasig River. The
British cruiser Immortalite and her
consorts kept fairly near the Ameri
can line. The attacking squadron
formed in line between Malate and Old
Manila, with the Concord watching the
fort at the mouth of the Paslg. The
American fleet lay outside the break
water.
"The Olympia fired the first shot at
9:40, and a fairly continuous, but by no
means furious, cannonade was kept up
until 11:20. By that time Malate fort
was silenced and the American troops
then stormed the entrenchments. The
Spaniards who were in the earthworks
tell that the quick-firing guns of the
little gunboat Rapido, which lay close
to the shore, were far more terrible in
their effects than was the raking fire of
the ships.
"Resistance to the American attack
was impossible. The First Colorado
Regiment was the earliest to charge the
Spaniards, who retired to the second
line, but soon, outnumbered, they were
forced into the old city. A part of Ma
late suffered severely from the bom
bardment. The vaunted intramures
defenses were not tried.
"The Spanish commander, convinced
that further resistance was hopeless,
hoisted a white flag at 11:30, and the
order to cease firing was immediately
issued in the center of the town, but in
the outskirts street fighting continued
for some time afterward between the
rebels and Spaniards.
"The only fear felt in the city is in
regard to the conduct of the insurgents.
As I write this in the house of the Ger
man Consul a brisk fusillade is going
on between the combatants, and mus
ketry fire is rattling all around."
MANILA UNHARMED
BY AMERICAN FIRE
Spaniards Soon Forced to Evacuate
Their Southern Position at
Malata.
BERLIN, Aug. 16.â According to a
dispatch from Hongkong, the Ameri
cans, about noon on August 7, ex
pressed to the Spanish commander at
Manila an ultimatum, demanding the
surrender of the city and the Spanish
forces within forty-eight hours.
During the interval of grace the Ger
mans embarked all German subjects
and others under German protection.
The demand for surrender was re
peated on the afternoon of August 9,
but the Spaniards requested a delay
to enable them to obtain instructions
from Madrid, by way of Hongkong.
The request was refused.
A bombardment of the outer lines and
outer batteries by the American war
ships wa' begun a^out 10 o'clock on
the morning of August 13. The Span
iards were soon forced to evacuate their
southeastern position at Malate, and
the Americans, who advanced on land,
arrived soon after noon before the Old
Towrfl which they surrounded^ Manila
itself, despite the heavy fire, remained
completely unharmed.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, WEDNESDAY, AUCHTST 17, 1898.
CUBAN AND PORTO RICAN COMMISSIONS.
TaTASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â The President to-day appointed the
two commissions to adjust the evacuation of Cuba and
Porto Rico. They are as follows :
For Cubaâ Major General James F. Wade, Rear Admiral W. T.
Sampson and Major General Matthew C. Butler.
For Porto Ricoâ Major General John R. Brooke, Rear Ad
miral Winfield S. Schley, Brigadier General William W. Gordon.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â General William Gordon, one of the
Commissioners for Porto Rico and the only one of the six ap
pointees to the commissions who is not widely known, is a well-known
citizen of Savannah, Ga. He is the senior colonel of the Georgia
State militia, and served in the ranks of the Confederate army. He
is 61 years of age. He belongs to one of the wealthiest families of the
State, and is conspicuous socially there. He was largely indorsed
in the State for brigadier-general.
MUSTERING OUT
THE VOLUNTEERS
Great Army Soon Will
Disband.
CORBIN PREPARED ORDERS
THIRTY-FIVE -THOUSAND MEN
AFFECTED.
Within the Next Thirty Days This
Number Will Have Been In
creased to a Hundred
Thousand. â¢ ...
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â WASHINGTON. Aug. 16.â mus
tering out of the volunteer army prac
tically began at the War Department
to-day, and will be continued until the
army has been placed on a basis con
sistent with our present relations to the
nations of the earth.
Orders were prepared to-day for the j
mustering out of about 35,000 volun-
J teers, including twenty-five regiments
of infantry and about eight troops of
cavalry and five or six batteries of ar- j
I tillery. The details of the order have
| not yet been fully perfected, and the !
; officials confine themselves to general
] statements in regard thereto.
It was admitted that the First Regi- i
i ment of Vermont Volunteers, attached
to the Third Army Corps encamped at
Chickamauga, Ga., had been ordered to j
| proceed to Fort Ethan Allen, Vt. That j
â  post is the nearest one to the homes of !
the members of the regiment, and was
selected with a view to their mustering
out soon after they arrive there. Ad
jutant Gefteral Corbin said that a
similar course would be folowed in the
case of the other volunteer regiments
selected for mustering out. They I
! would, he said, be ordered to their State >
j capitals as soon as it could be done !
without danger to the interests of the j
Government and mustered out of the
j military service as rapidly as possible.
In response to a direct inquiry on the
subject, General Corbin said that this
course would be followed with the First j
Regiment District of Columbia Volun
i teer Infantry, which is now about to
I embark at Santiago for Montauk Point,
I L. I.
Unless there is a decided change in
I the present plans of the War Depart -
| ment, about 100,000 volunteers will be
| mustered out within the next thirty
days.
Formal anouncement of the purposes
of the department are being deferred
pending the receipt of certain desired
information from General Merritt, com
manding the military forces in the
Philippines. There is a large number of
volunteers In the Philippines, and it is
posible that it may be deemed advis
able to bring them home and. If neces
sary, replace them with regulars.
The proposed reduction of the army
to the extent of 100.000 men will still
leave a military force of about 116,000
m enâ regulars and volunteersâavail
able for all military purposes. It is be
lieved to be the purpose of the adminis
tration to maintain an army of 100,000
men until all the pending complications
with Spain are finally disposed of.
MORE TROOPS MAY BE
SENT TO MERRITT
Washington Awaiting Further Ad
vice as to the Reported Insur
gent Attack.
NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: It would not surprise officials
if the rumor current in Hongkong re
porting that the insurgents had at
tacked American troops in the trenches
should prove true. In the event that
General Merritt should find it neces
sary to subdue the rebels the War De
partment stands ready to reverse its
announced decision not to send addi
tional troops to the Philippines. In
view of the capture of Manila and the
consequent destruction of Spanish rule
on Luzon it is said in official circles
that it will be the duty of American
troops to pacify the islands. If the
insurgents have attacked the American
troops it will be necessary to destroy
the slight organization they may have
and to establish peace and order
throughout the islands.
CURIOUS ATTITUDE
OF THE GERMANS
Their Beticence at 'Hongkong Pro
vokes Comment and Suspicion as
to Their Real Object.
LONDON, Aug. 17.â The Hongkong
correspondent of the Times, comment
ing on the reticent of the officers and
crew of the I.aiserin Augusta, says:
"The curious attitude of the Germans
has provoked a deal. of feeling here and
some suspicion as to the real object of
their secretiveness. The practice hith
erto has been for cruisers leaving Ma
nila, of whatever nationality, to bring
the mails of every nationality repre
sented at Manila. The Kalrerln Au
gusta brought only German mail."
NATIVES SAID TO HAVE
ATTACKED AMERICANS
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HONGKONG, Aug. 16.â 1t Is rumored
here that the United States troops at
Manila have had trouble with the rebel
forces under General Agulnaldo, Ao
cording to one account the Insurgents,
upon whom various restrictions had
been placed by Major General Merritt,
mutinied at not being permitted to
have any share in the surrender of the
city. It is reported they attacked the
Americans in the trenches.
The officers of the German warship
Kaiserin Augusta are under instruc
tions to give no information about the
bombardment, but it is freely stated
that there was great loss of life on both
sides. Senor Jose Denavarro, the Span
ish Consul here, intimated officially to
day to the United States Consul. Mr.
Wildman. that Manila fell on Saturday.
Captain General Augusti is still silent
about events before his departure.
There is much indie-nation here at the
extraordinary conduct of the German
cruiser in not bringing over Any mails
from Manila except from German resi
dents. It is feared the steamer with
the peace proclamation, which was ex
pected to reach Manila this morning,
may not have arrived there until after
Rear Admiral Dewey sent cruisers to
hoist the United States flag at Iloilo
and Cebu.
With his family Governor General
Augusti left for home to-day on the
German mail steamer Prinz Heinrich.
There are a large number of steamers
here preparing to leave for Manila with
provisions.
DISPATCH-BOAT WITH
MESSAGES FROM DEWEY
Zaflro Beaches Hongkong With Ci-
pher Dispatches Regarding the
Bombardment.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â The State
Department late to-night received a
dispatch from Consul Wildman of
Hongkong, saying the American trans
port Zafiro was Just entering the har
bor. The Zafiro doubtless brings dis
patches from Almlral Dewey and Gen
eral Merritt with reference to the cap
ture of Manila. As these messages are
probably in cipher, their transmission
will be slow, and they are not expected
to reach here before to-morrow.
MADRID LEARNS OF
THE FALL OF MANILA
General Merritt Prevented the Incur-
gents Interfering With the
Capitulation.
MADRID, Aug. 16.â Senor Sagaata,
on leaving the Palace this afternoon,
denied that General Blanco and other
generals were opposing the Govern
ment's policy, as had been alleged. It
is now known from official sources that
the Government yesterday received in
formation that Manila capitulated on
Saturday after General Jaudemes had
taken over the command from General
Augusti and the latter had been
authorized to quit his post and to em
bark on a foreign warship for Hong
kong.
Manila apparently capitulated be
cause of lack of food the population
and garrison having Buffered the great
est privations.
General Merritt, it is reported here,
took the greatest precautions to pre
vent insurgents from interfering with
the capitulation of Manila or from ap
proaching the city. The Madrid press
fears that the surrender may affect
Spain's position in the negotiations for
the future government of the Philip
pines.
TWO INJECTED VESSELS.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18.â According to
reports received at the Marino Hospital
Service, two of the six vessels whlcti have
arrived at Montauk Point. Long Island,
with troops from Shaffer's army, were in
fected. One of these, the Grand Duchoss.
whoso arrival has just been reported to
the bureau, had four cases of yellow
fever aboard and a number of suspects.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Senator Cuehman K. Davis
of Minnesota, chairman of the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations of the Senate,
has definitely accepted an appointment
as one of the five representatives of
America on the joint commission to de
cide upon the future of the Philippines
and draw up a final treaty of peace be
tween the United States and Spain.
There are now two members of the
commission definitely decided upon,
Secretary Day having prevlousl- ac
cepted.
I was told to-night by a member of
the Cabinet that it would not be safe
to put any other names in the list, '"r
the reason that only these two mem
bers of the committee have yet been
definitely decided upon. Nothing defi
nite can be said of the appointment of
General Tracy, former Secretary of the
Navy. His name and the names of
several others are still under considera
tion. No Democratic member has yet
been decided upon. Senator Gorman's
name is still mentioned In administra
tion circles, but It is not believed that
he will be appointed.
Former Representative Tucker of
Virginia called at the White House to
day, and it is understood that the Pres
ident discussed the peace commission
with him. Mr. Tucker may be selected
as the Democratic member of the com
mission.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 16.âAuthori
tative announcement is made that Sen
ator Allison of lowa will not be a mem
ber of the Peace Commission. In a long
interview to-day a membership on the
commission was urged upon him by the
President. Senator Allison was not able
to accept on account of other important
It is understood President McKlnley
has tendered to Senator Gorman of
Maryland a place on the Peace Com
mission and thftt he has declined the
offer The President now, it is stated,
is looking about for another Demo
cratic Senator in place of Senator
Gorman, the President being desirous
of securing a Democrat from the upper
house of CongresÃ.

P DOCTOR BILLS,
Better Than Blood Purifiers
and Nerve Tonics
Is the New Remedy for Dyspep=
sia and Indigestion.
Better, Because Perfect Di-
gestion Makes Pure Blood
and Strong Nerves.
Some Interesting Facts Concern*
ing This Remarkable
â  ; Remedy.
â â¢â¢-.'â  *
NQT A SECRET PATENT MEDICINE.
; ' Whether we eat to live or live to eat, It
Is certain that the possession of a healthy
it'otnach and sound digestion go a long
: way toward making life desirable, suc-
cessful, 'enjoyable. Beauty in woman,
strength', mental capacity, endurance in
man, depend more upon vigorous digestion
than upon any other one thing.
The dyspeptic man is Irritable, uncer-
tain, fearful of the future. The dyspep-
tic woman is nervous, sallow, subject to
headaches and despondency.
And what is the cause of these com-
mon types of men and women? Simply.
Undigested food, nothing more nor lessÂ«.
The. appetite being capricious, not enougft I
food is eaten, and what is eaten, instead
of betrig properly digested, remains in the
stomach for hours, a sour, fi-rmentinK
mass, poisoning the blood, a source of ir-
ritation to everj- nerve and organ. No
wonder people suffer from poor blood,
. shattered nerves, headaches, palpitating
hearts. Irritable tempers and gloomy, dis-
â¢ contented feelings.
â¢ Now, what is the rational cure for th!Â»
common condition? Is it "blood puri-
â flers" and "nerve tonics"? By no means,
because they don't reach the seat of the
trouble. Go to the fountain head, th<Â»
â â¢â¢stomach, get that in good healthy work-
ing order, and pure blood, strong nervos>,
bright eyes, clear color will be the nat-
ural result.
â¢ Why not? Where does blood, nerve,
bone, sinew and flesh come from anyway,
â  If not from the stomach, the food we eat
ana digest.
To cure digestion, the one thing neces-
sary 'Is to give the stomach a rest or par-
tial rest, by the daily use for a time of
'..some remedy which will digest food.
There is a very excellent preparation of
this kind, not a marvelous secret patent
medicine, but a pleasant, harmless com-
â¢ bihation of vegetable essences, fruit salts,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal, sold by
druggists under the name of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, and nothing to equal Jt
has yet been produced in the whole cato-
â  : Fory Â°f patent medicines.
;- : Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is superior
â¢ to them all. because when these tablets
;Â«re nsÂ«><J you know what you are taking
.â¢â into your stomach. No secret Is made oi
'their, composition and physicians and j
. chemists know that one grain of the di-
gestive principle in Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will digest 3000 times its own
w.eight of wholesome food. Dr. Jennlson
â "recommends them highly, not only as a
cure for digestion, but also because they
Increase flesh by Increasing nutrition.
Dr. Harlandson says to increase flesh,
appetite and to secure healthy digestion
I .have found nothing so safe, so effectual
as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. Mr. Jas.
Benton of Rosston says: "I suffered five
.years with nervous dyspepsia and catarrh
of the stomach. Everything I at^ seemed
. to sour on my stomach: could not enjoy
a meal- for fear of the distress afterward.
My druggist advised Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and I can now eat anything 1
want, have gained in flesh and good splr-
â¢ Its and I know the tablets did it and 1
shall always keep them within reach."
.-â¢'â¢ Gne of. the most remarkable cures ever
made by these tablets was in the case ot
Mrs. Sarah Skeels of Lynnville, lowa,
'who had chronic dyspepsia for twenty-five
: years" and doctors pronounced her casÂ«
Incurable, yet she enthusiastically writes
that .the tablets completely and perma-
nently cured her.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets save doctors*
bill, because a full-sized package costing
. 50 Cents at any drug store will often do
more good for a weak stomach than fifty
.'dollars' worth of ordinary doctor's fees.

4 PROMINENT SAN FRANCISCAN,
Honored by High Official Position, Strongly In=
dorses a Well=Known Preparation.
All Californians know and admire the Hon. John T. Dare,
now United States Appraiser of this port. His experiences have
been varied, and he has been the recipient of many honors.
He came around the Horn in ISOI as officer of a ship, and, going
to Arizona, became noted on the frontier as a pony express rider,
afterward serving as a member of the Territorial Legislature.
Returning to San Francisco, he was admitted to the bar in 1874.
Later he visited Honolulu, became a member of the King's
Cabinet, and was appointed by King Kalakaua Attorney-
General of the Island Kingdom.
Two years later he returned to San Francisco, resumed the
practice of law, and acted as fiduciary agent for large con-
tractors engaged in railroad building.
In 1877 he represented Solano County in the Legislature.
He served a term in the District Attorney's office, and his splen-
did record as Prosecuting Attorney is conceded to be one of the
best and most successful in the history of the office.
Mr. Dare is a man of action, resolute and fertile in re-
sources. He has rendered valuable service to the Republican
party on the stump, and is widely known as a practical news-
paper writer.
The fact that Mr. Daro has been willing to make public the
great benefit derived from the use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
is a strong argument in favor of that widely advertised prepara-
tion. Here is what he has to say :
San Francisco, June 20, '98.
F. A Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich.
Dear Sirs â In view of the fact that I have been for
years a great sufferer from Dyspepsia and kindred stomach
troubles, I think it only a matter of justice to make public the
remarkable effect of your well-known remedy, Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets, for the cure of such maladies. While one year ago
it was practically an impossibility for me to eat anything but
select foods, I am happy to state that after three months' use of
the Tablets I find no difficulty in eating the heartiest meals of
any kind of food desired without disagreeable after effects.
You are at liberty to use my name in the exploitation of
your remedies, as I consider it is your due that those who are
benefited should make public the benefit so derived.
Yours very truly, JOHN T. DARE,
Appraiser of the Port of San Francisco.
FACTS WITH POINTS.
Every One of These Statements Ab-
solutely True.
Mr. A. W. Sharper, 61 Prospect street,
Indianapolis, Ind., says: "Gratitude
sons Interested Is more than one hun
dred.
"No suit against former Judge Hilton
or other holders of property left by Mr.
Stewart has yet been begun," he said,
"The appointment of a guardian for
heirs who are under age is but a pre
liminary step. We have been at work
for two years on thlÃ matter and have
worked out the Stewart ancestral tree
until we know every branch of it."
Mr. Hart said that he has a mass of
documents which satisfy him that his
clients have a genuine claim. He Raid
that he represented no illegitimate chil
dren and that the proceedings were be
gun in good faith.

CUBAN SHOT WHILE
STEALING SUPPLIES
Refuses to Obey a Command to Halt
and Ib Brought Down by
a Sentry.
SANTIAGO DX CUBA, Aug. 15.â(De
layed In transmission). â This morning a
Cuban was shot by a sentry who caught
him stealing commissary stores at the
dock. Yesterday it was discovered that
enough goods had been stolen to make
th*"cc carloads, which had been taken out
surreptitiously to the Cubans In the field.
The man undfÂ»r suspicion returned to the
wharf last night, evidently with the in
tention of continuing his thefts, but he
was warned off. Early this morning he
was again found there. When the sen
try challenged him he ran, refusing to
nli' y the order to halt. As he was likely
to escape the sentry fired and killed him.
The occurrence Is regretted by General
Wood, but the American officers think It
will have a salutary effect, as stores have
been stolen tob frequently for the prac
tice to be tolerated any longer.
ITALY IS SATISFIED.
Colombia Agree? to All Points in Her
Ultimatum.
ROME, Aug. 16.â Admiral Candiani, the
commander of the Italian squadron now
oft the Colombian coast, received on Aug
ust 14 a definite reply from the Govern
ment of Colombia agreeing to all three
points included In his ultimatum as to the
payment of the Cerruti claim, namely:
<r A formal and absolute recognition of
President Cleveland's award and under
taking to estop within eight months all
proceedings on the part of Cerruti's credi
tors and an Immediate money payment to
Italy as a guarantee of the full execution
of the award within the stipulated time."
This dispute is thus settled to Italy's
satisfaction.
Blanco Must Hold His Post.
MADRID, Aug. 16.â The Cabinet has
decided to order General Blanco and
all other Spanish commanders in the
Antilles to fill their respective posts un
til the evacuation is completed.
Mrs. Creede Is Nonsuited.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 15.â Judge Clark,
in the Superior Court here to-day, up
held the conrtact between Mrs. N. C.
well and have none but words of praise
for Stuart's Tablets.
Mrs. Sarah A. Skeels, Lynnville, Iowa:
"It has been six months since I took
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and am fully
cured. Have not had a particle of distress
or difficulty since. This Is in the face of
the fact that I had suffered from stom-
ach trouble for twenty-five years and was
pronounced incurable by the doctors."
James Newmestes, Eau Claire, Wis.,
says: "Two 50-cent packages of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets did me more good than
any remedy I had ever before tried. They
hit the spot with me, and I once more
have an appetite and can eat what I
please without fear of distress and bloat-
ing afterward."
Dr. Harlandson relates the case of Miss
Helen Sholos of Nashville, who was cured
of dyspepsia and gained 18 pounds in
weight after suffering from stomach trou-
ble for eight years. The doctor uses them
in all stomach troubles because they are
not a secret patent medicine, but contain
pure pepsin. Diastase, fruit acids and val-
uable digestives, which digest the food
whether the stomach works or not, gives
it the needed rest, and a cure is the nat-
ural result.
Dr. Jennison says nine-tenths of disease
is caused by indigestion and Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets is the safest and best cure,
because they are not a secret patent med-
icine, but contain the valuable digestive
principles needed by every weak stomach,
and a whole box would not hurt a child,
being absolutely harmless.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at 50 cents per package.
Send to Stuart Co.. Marshall. Mich., for

stomach troubles.
A GOOD COMPLEXION
Depends on Good Digestion.
This is almost an axiom, although us-
ually we are apt to think that cosmetics,
face powders, lotions, fancy soaps, etc.,
are the secret for securing a clear com-
plexion.
But all these are simply superficial as-
sistants. It is imposible to have a good
complexion unless the digestive organs
perform their work properly, unless the
Stomach by properly digesting the food
taken into It furnishes an abundance of
pure blood a good complexion is impos-
sible.
This is the reason so many ladles are
using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because
they promptly cure any stomach trouble,
and they have, found out that perfect
digestion means a. perfect complexion and
one that does not require cosmetics and
powders to enhance its beauty.
Many ladies diet themselves or deny
themselves man)' articles of food solely
In order to keep th^ir complexions clear.
When Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
used no siu-h dieting is necessary. Take,
these tablets and eat all the good, whole-
some food you want, and you need have,
no fear of Indigestion, nor the sallow, dull
complexion which nine women out of ten
have, solely because they are suffering
from some form of indigestion.
Bear In mind that beauty proceeds from
good health, good health results from per-
fect dlerestion, and we have advanced the
best argument to induce every man or
woman to give this splendid remedy a
trial.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
In drugstores, and costs but GO cents per
package. They are prepared by the
Stuart Chemical Co.. Marshall. Mich.
If there is any derangement of the
stomach or bowels they will remove It.
and the resultant effects are good diges-
tion, good health and a clear, bright com-
plexion. Ask your druggist for the tab-
lets and a free book on stomach diseast-s.
INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
Of an lowa Lady Who Was Cured of
Dyspepsia After Suffering for
Twenty-Five Years.
Mrs. Sarah A. Skeels, an estimable lady-
residing at Lynnvillo, Jasper County,
lowa, was for twenty-five years a sufferer
from Dyspepsia, and her complete restor-
ation to health is so remarkable' that :we
present the facts In the case for the bene-
fit of ' our readers,' many of whom have
doubtless suffered In the same manner
and will, therefore, be interested In learn-
ing how all stomach troubles may be
avoided and cured. > Mrs. Skeels says: I
used only one package oT Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets and I received such great
and unexpected benefit that I wish, to ex-
press my sincere gratitude. In fact, It haÂ«
been six months since I took the medi-
cine and I have, not had one particle of
distress or difficulty since. And allthis In
the face of the fact that the best* doctors
I consulted told me my case was incur-
able, as I had suffered .for twenty-five
years. I want half a dozen packages to
distribute among my friends here who are
very anxious to try this remedy. Yours
truly. MRS. SARAH A. SKEELS.
The reason . why Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are .so successful In -curing indi-
gestion and stomach troubles and the rea-
son why it never disappoints those who
need it and use it is because nothing is
claimed for it except what it will actu-
ally perform. It is not a cure-all, and no
such claims are made for it. â¢ It is pre-
pared for the sole purpose of curing
Dyspepsia and the various forms of indi-
gestion.
There is scarcely a patent medicine
made but what is claimed to cure dyspep-
sia as well as a hundred other troubles.
When, as a matter of fact, a remedy to
cure Dyspepsia must be prepared especi-
ally for that and nothing else; and among
all the remedies, patent nostrums, bitters,
etc., so extensively advertised you . will
find that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is
the only one advertised as a cure for dys-
pepsia and nothing else. The remedy is
prepared by the Stuart Co. of Marshall.
Mich., and for sale by all druggists at 50
'cents per package, and if you suffer from
any form of stomach derangement or
indigestion, a trial will not disappoint
you. .

the day after the crime and shot at Ponce
on August 4.

GOVERNMENT FOR
NEW POSSESSIONS
â¢
Framework Gradually
Being Evolved.
MILITARY TO BE IN CHARGE
WILL BE KEPT IN CONTROL FOR
A TIME.
Cubans at Santiago Not Disposed
to Accept the Conditions
Imposed by the
Armistice.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â Gradually
the framework of a government for the
civil administration of affairs in Cuba,
Porto Rico and such portions of the
Philippines as this Government controls
is being framed. The development of
this plan of internal administration oc
cupied much of the attention of the
Cabinet to-day, and later Secretary
Gage, Attorney General Griggs, Post
master General Smith and Acting Sec
retary of State Moore held a two hours'
conference at the State Department,
going over the tnfini f detail of estab
lishing a civil administration. General
Corbin was present part of the time.
At the outset the military authorities
will be in charge of all administrative
affairs in Cuba, Porto Rico and other
acquired possessions. But the military
forces can do little more than direct the
orderly execution of affairs. The car
rying On of postal communication, the
collection of customs, etc., are civil
functions which will be taken in hand
by the appropriate bureaus here, the
entire work being under the protection
of the military authorities. The result
of the conferences to-day will be made
known through the various depart
ments.
Already steps have been taken to
restore mail communication between
this country and Cuba, but the plans
itbw under consideration' are likely to
take In the question of handling mail
inside of Cuba, Porto Rico and other
points. A mail steamer will leave New
York to-morrow, carrying the first lot
of mail to Cuba which has left New
York since the war began.
The Spanish Government has been
quite solicitous as to the method of ad
ministering affairs in the Antilles on
account of the large Spanish interests
remaining there. The French Embas
sador has received a number of in
quiries in this line, and these have been
laid before the State Department. Af
ter the conference held here this after
noon M. Thiebaut of the French Em
bassy called and was made acquainted
with the general plan of this Govern
ment in restoring a stable administra
tion through the Spanish West Indies.
The French Embassador has also been
advised by the State Department of its
selection of military commissioners to
meet at Havana and San Juan. The
names of these commissioners have
been awaited at Madrid, as it is the
purpose there to appoint Spanish com
missioners of the same rank a* thoÃe
named by the United States.
The announcement of Admirals
Sampson and Schley as members of
the military commissions of Havana
and San Juan, respectively, will have
the effect of taking these officers from
their duty on shipboard for a time. The
Navy Department will relieve them
from their commands temporarily,
while the commissioners are in session.
In the absence of Admiral Sampson,
Captain Philip, who is the senior offi
cer, will probably be in temporary
command of the fleet.
The War Department did not make
public the dispatch from General Law
ton relative to the Cubans in Santiago,
but the order which General Corbin
sent to General Lawton indicates some
thing of its nature. General Lawton
reports that the Cubans do not seem
disposed to accept the conditions Im
posed by the armistice, and some trou
bles have occurred. Secretary Alger. in
speaking of the matter to-day, said that
it might as well be fully understood
that the United States would control
the surrendered territory, and it would
manage the affairs of that territory.
Those who remained within the juris
diction would have to obey the laws
and officers of the United States, as
General Lawton was Informed.
The War Department began the work
of mustering out the volunteers which
will not be needed in the service. The
order was prepared, but was not Is
sued, as It was deemed best to await
news from Manila before disbanding
any of the troops. It is expected that
the cavalry and artillery of the volun
teer force now in the United States will
be mustered out.
Reports of better conditions In the
various camps are being received, and
especially do flattering reports come
from Montauk Point, showing that the
soldiers are being well cared for there.
Preparations have being going for
ward for the movement of the troops
from the camps which were originally
established, in order to scatter them
about the country.
The first report concerning yellow
fever among the United States troops
in this country came from Key West
to-day. Surgeon General Sternberg be
lieves that It can be kept under control.
THANKED BY JAPAN.
Tokio Pleased at the Settlement of
the Immigration Claim.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â Minister
Sewall, at Hawaii, has informed the
State Department that Hawaii has paid
to Japan $75,C00 as indemnity for the re
fusal of the Hawaiian Government to
allow certain Japanese to land In Ha
waii at various times during the past
three years. Quite a complication
arose over the claim of Japan for a
larger amount about the time the new
treaty of annexation was negotiated,
but this payment no doubt clears it
all.
Mr. Sewall pays that the payment of
$75,000 referred t" was in full settle
ment of all Japanese claims, public and
private. He alÃo reports that the Jap
anese charge d'affaires at Honolulu ex
pressed thanks to the United States
Government for its Â«"ood offices In the
matter. The action of the Hawaiian
Government in payiner this indemnity
was based upon the recommendation of
the United States Government as ex
pressed by Minister Sewall, acting un
der instructions from the State Depart
ment at Washington. The administra
tion desired that the controversy be
tween Japan and Hawaii over the im
migration question should be settled be
fore the formal annexation of the is
lands to the territory of the United
States.

DEAL IN HIGH
SCHOOL DESKS
San Jose Board of Edu
cation in a Job.
HELP TO LOOT THE TREASURY
PAY FANCY PRICES TO FA
VOBITE FIRMS.
Much Lower Bids Are Completely-
Ignored â Agents Given No
Chance to Make Expla
nations.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Aug. 16.â The City Board
of Education took a hand in the loot
of the city treasury last night by pur
chasing 300 school desks for the new
High School at exorbitant figures. The
favored bidders were the L. Lion &
Sons Company and San Jose Furni
ture Company. From the former 150
"Beauty" desks were bought at $3 50
each, and the San Jose Furniture Com
pany sold the city 150 Haney desks at
$3 10 each.
There was no money in the fund to
make the purchase and they will be
paid for at the end of the year. Until
paid for the Board of Education has
agreed to pay $1 per year rent for each
desk.
All the trusteees, with the exception
of Wemple, voted for the proposition.
It was the evident intention to give
the Job to L.lon & Sons, but the mem
bers were afraid to be so bold and di
vided the business with the San Jose
Furniture Company.
The Board of Education held three
meetings yesterday, but it was not un
til last night that the deal was consum
matedâruthlessly voting away the peo
ple's money. The room* had the ap
pearance of a furniture factory, and
were almost filled with chairs, teach
ers' desks and school desks. The
firms of George H. Fuller & Co. of San
Francisco, L. .Lion & Sons, M. M. Haas
and the San Jose Furniture Company
were the competitors. Agents were
given no chance to explain then olds
before the board, which considered the
bids in executive session.
Last evening the matter was fixed up
and Trustees Graham, Kenyon, Lang
ford and O'Neil voted as stated above.
In doing so they ignored the lowest bid
ders. George H. Fuller & Co. offered
desks superior to those chosen at $2 72
each, the Haas Company had a bid in
at $3 45 and Lion & Scms offered a
cheaper desk at $2 50. The Trustees
picked out the most expensive desks,
with utter disregard to the expenditure
of city money. Lion & Sons' bid was ir
regular and not according to printed
notice, yet the board gave them the
contract.
City finances are low and there will be
a deficiency of from $6000 to $10,000 in the
School Department at the end of the
fiscal year. In taking Fuller & Co.'s
offer the Trustees could have saved the
city about $175 on the deal. Bids for
teachers' desks and chairs were thrown
out. These goods will be bought from
Licm & Sons at private sale and the
city will be the sufferer.
The Santa Clara Trustees last night
bought fifty Haney school desks for
their High School for $2 85 each. This
purchase is made to accommodate pu
pils from this city who are boycotting
the local High School because of the
dismissal of Professor L. R. Smith. The
Haney desk at $2 85 per desk is 25 cents
less than San Jose agreed to pay for the
same desk last night. Just why there
should be 25 cents less per desk in favor
of Santa Clara is hard to understand.
The city Board of Education will
probably be called upon to explain why
in choosing the desks the lowest bidders
were not considered. This is not the
first time San Jose has been robbed in
buying school desks. Some 200 "Beau
ty" school desks were bought from Lion
& Sans last year at $3 75. Bids were
called for to supply 100 desks at that
time,, but the old school board rejected
all the bids and purchased the goods
from the Lions. The bill amounted to
over $600, and in order to pay the bill
without violating the charter, they sub
divided it. The signing of these claims
was about the first official act of Mayor
Martin, who is an uncle of the Lions.

KLONDIKERS
WITH LITTLE
TREASURE
Many Return on the
National City.
GOLD WAS VERY SCARCE
THE STRATTON REPORTED LOST
WITH ALL HANDS.
She Started TJp the Yukon With a
X.T. Casey and Party on a Pros
pecting Trip â Hard Times
at St. Michael.
The steamr National City arrived
from St. Michael yesterday with sixty
. three passengrers all told. Of these
eighteen were the crew of the stern
wheel steamer James Eva which was
wrecked while being towed to St. Mi
chael by the National City. Of the
others, four were miners who went up
on the steamer, and not being able to
secure transportation to Dawson came
back to San Francisco. It is said that
. the other Klondikers brought down a
half million with them In gold dust, but
â¢ the owners of the National City say if
: they brought down $50,000 it was all
.they had. The most anybody had on
board in dust was $1500 and the lowest
. $100. â¢ . â¢ ly ,
â¢If the stories of some of the passen
â¢ gers are to be believed, and there seems
to be no reason why they should not,
"the richness of the Klondike country
has been much exaggerated in the past
and the area of paying claims in that
region Is a narrow one and much more
circumscribed than has ordinarily been
â  supposed.
Dr. H. H. Look, a physician of Sacra
mento, returned on the vessel after a
thorough inspection of the mining pos
sibilities in that section, and after an
exhaustive investigation has come to
-.the conclusion that there are but sixty
six paying claims and subdivides them
as follows: Bonanza, 30; El Dorado,
â¢ '30; Big Skookem he classes as a doubtful
â¢ creek; Little Skookem and Chief Gulch
he rates" as "no good"; French Gulch, 3
paying claims; El Dorado benches, be
ing the claims near the hilltops, and
the Bonanza benches are also classed
by the doctor as doubtful; Bear Creek
has no paying claims and Hunker
Creek only 3. He says that these
claims pay big. and he does not reckon
as paying claims such as those which
pay wages only. . "â '.
Albert F. Schulte. an Oakland . attor
ney, was also a passenger on the Na
tional City. He went to St. Michael
a year ago. He located no claims and
Is out just $1500 on his venture. He
. makes a more liberal estimate of the
number of paying claims and places
them at 104. He left Dawson on the !
27th of June, after enduring many
hardships in that, cold country, and
reached St. Michael on July 31. He
took passage on the National City on
August 2. About thirty-five of the
passengers were men who had located
claims and had done some mining* and
Mr. Schulte said that the total amount
of gold dust brought back by them
would not exceed $20,000 in value.
The richest man in the party, whose
name could not be ascertained, had
$2000 to show for three years of hard
ship. â  ; .
The rest of the passengers, to the
number of about forty, consisted of the
men rescued from the James Eva,
'which was lost two days from Dutch
Harbor. . They . were carried to St.
Michael and were given the privilege
of returning to San Francisco on the
. tickets that entitled them to passage
â¢ to Dawson. . Half of them availed
themselves of the privilege, while the
other half either pressed on or sold |
â¢ their tickets at a sacrifice, $35 being a j
â¢ top price for them. H. F. Bodine was ,
one of those who returned and claims
the loss of fourteen tons of freight and
is out just $3000. His is the ill-fated
party taken up by the Alaska Yukon
Transportation Company.
J. C. Brown, who also was a passen
ger on the National City, ' â¢ does not
â¢ think much of the ability of Captain
. C. Anderson, who navigated the vessel
to this port, and says that if it had not
been for the presence aboard of Cap
â¢ tain W. L. Lock the National City
would never have reached this port.
Captain Lock took out the Government
' boat Taku ' to the Yukon and there
' turned her over to the proper officials.
Mr. Brown said that when the National
City was two miles out of St. Michael
Captain Anderson ran her on a sandbar
in broad daylight. After losing twelve
hours on the bar he steered forty miles
out. of. his course, and lost it four times
between St. Michael and Unimak Pass,
and lost it again nve times after pass-
Ing that point. He sighted Point
Arena on August 15, and was within
ten miles of the heads at 8 p. m., the
weather being clear. In spite of the
advice of Captain Lock and the chief
engineer, he refused to enter port.
After wandering around outside until
9 a. m. of the, 16th he got his bearings
from the fog whistles on Point Reyes
and at last entered port to the Joy and
satisfaction of the passengers. Com
plaint was also made as to the discip
line on board ship, which was voted as
frightfully bad. ". Had the .vessel been
properly c- managed she would have
reached, here on Sunday last. ' \
A private letter ' from St. Michael,
dated. July 30, says that wind and rain
storms are preventing the departure of
the river steamers for Dawson. Up
to July 29 no vessels had arrived from
the Klondike, and the. river was falling
very fast. ; The writer says the steamer
T. C. ; Powers is about to leave with a
full cargo and a limited number of pas
sengers. \ It is feared that not enough
provisions will be got up to Dawson, as
the : river has : fallen considerably and
some well-known ?â¢â¢ channels have
shifted. :> ~-V';;;O. .%;'.:> , , â  â¢

A NEW AUXILIARY YACHT.
She Will Be Schooner Rigged and Fitted With a 25-
Horsepower Engine.
Dr. V. P. Buckley and Arthur Kanzee of Sausalito are to have the i.nest yacht In the bay. She is now almost
completed, and the only thing that is bothering her owners is her rig. She has an auxiliary screw, and the sails
have to be made to conform with the smokestack. The chances are. however, that she will be schooner rigged.
Some time ago Dr. Buckley sold his fast gasoline launch Satellite, but his love of the bay soon lured him back
to yachting. The keel of a fine boat to be 53 feet long, 15 feet broad and 7 feet deep was soon laid and an order for a
25-horsepower, nickel-plated, silver-dipped, direct-gear gasoline engine was given to the Union Gas Engine t-0"1
pany. The hull Is now completed, the engine In place, and as soon as the yacht is rigged she will be ready for her
trial trip. She is fitted throughout with electric lights, and has also a very powerful searchlight for such a small
craft. A 3S-lnch feathering screw will only be used when the yacht is becalmed.
Messrs. Buckley and Kanzee's new yacht will be just the thing for these waters. Around Sausallto, Belve
dere and Angel Island, where yachting centers, there are many calm streaks to be met with, and it is then that the
yachtsmen pray for an auxiliary engine. In Raccoon Straits the tide runs so fast that the yachts frequently can
not make headway against it, and then they have to come to anchor. Sometimes a gasoline launch tows them to
Sausalito or Belvedere and sometimes not.
In the latter case the yachtsmen have to go ashore in a sirjall boat, and in many instances leave the boat to take
care of Itself. In the case of the new yacht, however, her owners can go where they please, and should the wind
fall light they can unlimber the propeller and return home at a speed of eight knots an hour.
GOOD NEWS
COMES FROM
THE WHALERS
Some of the Impris
oned Fleet Escape,
OTHERS HAVE A GOOD CATCH.
THE ALEXANDER IS ALL RIGHT
WITH FIVE WHALES.
Captain Tilton of the Steam Whaler
Narwhal Reported Dead and
Buried at Port
Clarancs.
The whalers seem to be doing well
this year, to make up for their hard
luck in 18S6-97. All those that were
frozen in, and to which the relief expe
dition was sent by the Government,
have got out of the ice, with the ex
ception of the Belvedere. When the
ice began to form Captain Millard man
aged to work his vessel into a little
bay, where she was considered as safe
for the winter as if in San Francisco
harbor. That safety has proved her
undoing so far. for while the Fearless,
Jeanie, Newport, Rosario and Wan
derer have got out and are now at Port
Clarance, she is still fast in the ice
near Point Barrow.
Of the vessels that were imprisoned
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
tender Jeanie and the steam whaler
Feariess were supposed to be in the
worst position. They were out In the
open, and it w-as feared that when the
ice began to break up they would be
ground to pieces. Some of the others
were expected to share the fate of the
Jessie H. Freeman, which was nipped
in the ice and went down before Mate
Tilton left Point Barrow for San Fran
cisco. All of them are safe, however,
and only one death has so far been re
ported.
The steam whaler Alexander, Instead
of being wrecked, is reported all right
and to have taken five whales. The
bark John and Winthrop had taken one
sperm and two right whales, while the
bark Gayhead had the same number.
The steam whaler William Baylies had
taken six whales and the Jeanette
three, while the Karluk had five.
The only bad news is the reported
death of Captain J. A. Tilton of the
steam whaler Narwhal. The informa
tion all came in a letter received here
yesterday from John Taria, fourth mate
of the bark Gayhead. It was dated
at Port Clarance nearly two months
ago, and in it he said the ship's crew
was going next day to the funeral of
Captain Tilton of the Narwhal.
The friends of the captain in this city
are loth to believe the story and think
that In the hurry of writing Mate Taria
made a mistake. According to their
way of looking at it, the Narwhal was
to winter at the mouth of Mackenzie
River, and that she would not get out
of there until next month. They can
not, therefore, understand how the re
mains of Captain Tilton would be at
Port Clarance when the letter was
written. Ho ever, the tender Jeanie
was out of the ice, and as she would
come direct to San Francisco she
should be along at any time now. As
wrhales seem to be plentiful the other
vessels will do some hunting before
they come home. Everything seems
favorable for a good catch, and the
men who went north two years ago
may do well after all.

HE WANTS TO BURY HIMSELF.
Alfred Ferdinan Seeks to Enjoin
Chief Lees From. Interfering.
Albert Ferdinan. who follows the wave
of the dead to make a living, and periodi
cally buries himself alive, has applied to
the Superior Court for a writ of Injunction
to prevent the police from interfering
with his little performance. Ferdinan
arrived in the .city not long ago and im
mediately selected a vacant lot on Market
street, near Larkln. in which to dig a
grave and lie him down, that the gaping
multitudes might look down through a
plate-glass arrangement and see his feat
ures passive as death, while he lay hypno
tized and unconscious of his surroundings.
The grave was dug and all arrangements
for the interment of the living were made.
The performance was billed for last Sun
day afternoon, but when the hour arrived
the police interfered and Ferdinan re
mained above the earth to bewail his
fate. He secured the services of attor
neys, however, and yesterday the petition
for a writ was filed. A temporary in
junction was granted returnable before
Judge Seawell and It will In all probabil
ity bfe determined next Friday.

NO GOLD AT
KOTZEBUE SOUND
A Prospector Tells His
Experience.
TALES OF FINDS DENIED
THE GOLD REALLY CAME FROM
THE YUKON DISTRICT.
A Few Words of Warning to Men
Who Are Too Eager .to Rush
Anywhere for
Gold.
The following letter from Cy Mulkey,
dated at Port Clarence, July 6, will tend to
explode some of the stories about the
wonderful riches of the Kotzebuu Sound
district. It Is as follows:
All the reports of the discovery of gold
in Kotzebue Sound that are heard In San
Francisco are false. 1 have It from differ
ent sources, chiefly from Missionary Lopp
of Cape Prince of Wales, who tells me
that there have been men prospecting on
the Kowak River, who have not dlÃCov
ered any gold. He also says that his In
dian guides make light of the report of
discoveries of gold on the Kowak River,
and nay that the gold shown to Captain
Kagan and others was got from the Indi
ans on the Yukon River. I have also had
a talk with Captain Ragan regarding the
gold reported to have been obtained by
him from the natives of Kotzebue Sound.
He tells me that he did not get any gold
from the Indians, but that an Indian
showed him about $3 worth of gold dust
that he claimed to have taken out of a
small tributary of the Kowak River. Cap
tain Ragan wanted to buy the gold, but
the native offered to show him where he
got it for a rifle and some ammunition. I
also learned that the story regarding Mis
sionary Gambell of Lieutenant Lawrence
Island, who. It was reported, had got nug
gets from the natives as large as hickory
nuts Is positively denied by Mr. Gambell.
From what I have heard, and also fudg
ing by the general appearance of the
country. I would not think it very rich In
minerals, although I have not done any
prospecting there myself. I also visited a
point on the Siberian coast, and all I can
say about that country Is that the north
ern formation is mineral bearing. I also
went up the coast, through Bering Straits,
touching at different points. I then
crossed over to Cape Prince of Wales,
where I met Mr. Lopp and got the Infor
mation before related. My opinion is that
there has been no discovery of gold of any
importance made on any river emptying
into Kotzebue Sound. My advice to
friends and acquaintances Is to leave this
country alone until there Is something
more definite known of It. It was a very
rough trip and the climate is cold and
very disagreeable. A great portion of the
country is covered with snow and the
rain pours down constantly.

of the stomach. When he woke in the morning there would be a
gripping, a contraction, a tightness of the stomach, which, he said,
seemed to be clogged with a slimy, phlegm-like substance. Carlsbad
salts always did him some good, but now he uses a Ripans Tabule. He
only takes one when occasion requires, just one now and then. When
this man, his name is Spalding, was asked to describe the effect of the
Tabule on him, he said : "Why, it brightens me up. It has an effect
like dry air ; makes me feel something as I used to of a spring morning

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. '16.â There was a still fur- '
ther advance In the price of stocks all along
the line to-day, and a still further increase in .
the number of shares sold during the day.
The number of different stocks traded in was
also larger, reflecting the broadening interest
In the market. Buying orders from outside
sources were placed with commission houses j
more extensively to-day than on any day since !
the movement began. As was the case yester- ,
day this outside demand was taken advantage
oi to realize profits by the combination 01 large :
speculative interests which is all the time op- â 
crating on an enormous scale, shifting its ac- j
tivities from one stock or group of stocks to |
another. The Grangers showed the effect of .
realizing to-day and did not rise materially j
above yesterday's closing price at any time. I
So large were the offerings of these stocks dur- I
ing, the first hour of trading that the heavy j
outside demand proved insufficient to absorb j
them, and a. Sharp decline was the. result. Bur- ;
lington dropped over a point. Offerings on a
large scale were thereupon withheld, and the !
group maintained a firm tone at a lower level
except at intervals of profit taking. The bears
endeavored to take advantage of this move- i
mem by an onslaught upon Manhattan and
Sugar at the opening, hoping that the recent ]
persistent weakness of these two stocks would '
make them vulnerable in breaking prices. But j
th? bulls at the same time lifted the Northern
Pacific stocks a point each at the opening, |
and marked up Rubber preferred 4% points. i
The outside demand for stocks all through the ;
list was so active and varied as to lend ample I
support for continued profit taking by the bull
clique. The bears were soon routed and Man- !
â¢hattan and Sugar moved upward along with
.the" general list. Northern Pacific and the !
Union Pacific stocks sagged at intervals, but j
the former returned persistently to the open- ;
Ing high level. An Incident of the day was a I
notice on the tape of the loss of 1000 shares of
Union Pacific preferred in the name of Wil- ;
liam Rockefeller. Southern railroads and some i
of the Western roads showed notable strength â¢
and there was also marked activity and j
strength In a long list, of industrials. The close j
â was firm and active.
The demand for securities has apparently |
bÂ«Â»pn largely diverted to the stock market, and
bonds were comparatively dull to-day, but ]
prices were very well held. Total sales, $3,575.- i
000. United States threes when issued were He
lower bid. Government bonds were otherwise ;
unchanged. .' . - . â¢

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 16.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here continued firm to-day, the Im
provement being led by the continued boom
in Americans. The professional traders and
the rubllc here are undoubtedly taking a hand
In the rise though to-day the chief support
was from the Continent. Berlin again bought
Northern Pacific greedily. The market for
Americans is beginning to widen. but the
activity Is still confined to comparatively few
stocks, and the dealers complain that with the
exception of theee stocks there is considerable
difficulty in dealing freely. Prices closed
nearly at the best.
Apart from a further rise In Argentine and
Turkish stocks, the other stocks were feature
less. Spanish 4s were flat. Japan Is buying

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
; CHICAGO. Aug. 16.â Wheat got a weak start
j from Liverpool sending lower quotations, but â 
; there was a disposition during the first couple
j of hours to go slow on the selling side and take
j small profits on declines. The crowd during j
â  that time was evidently restrained from sell
! Ing freely by the fact that the increased move
; ment that country advices had been predicting
| for a day or two had not yet got beyond the j
i stage of probability. The speculative market !
! turned fearfully dull and there was no activity
lln the cash department of the business. The
! latter might have shown more Jlfe had stocks
\ been heavier, but people who had bids at from
I 6 to <C a bushel premium over September in
store for shipping parcels of No. 2 Kansas hard
; and No. 2 red winter could not get offers for
i anything like the quantity there were orders
1 for from the seaboard. Kansas City's general
i remark in annwer to bids from here ivas that ;
i cash wheat or spot or for August shipment |
; was scarce, as millers were paying better than \
i shipping rates for the moderate offerings from ;
; farmej-s. This had some little effect In harden- j
â  Ing the tone of the speculative market, but It
I apparently depended more upon prudential cor
| ering by shorts than buying for long account.
j September closed %c higher and December f4c
i lower to %c up.
I Great commission-house liquidation on the
, continued favorable weather and lower cables
depressed corn. September left off H<^%c down.
In spite of considerable buying of the Mas'
; future by the oatmeal trust oats put in the day
j following corn and prices barely held their own.
! September left off unchanged to %c lower.
i j Packers were sellers of provisions early in
; the session. The market was kept under the
i Influence of the yellow quarantine flag by allu
i sions in the news of the day to fever among
1 the troops coming to Montauk Point. Pork de

Orders that were taken for early delivery: can

Ing for a large Increase In business as a result;

SLASHED HIS TENTMATE'S THROAT.
James Meadors, a Quarrelsome Volunteer Soldier, Stabs Jonas
Uru, Severing Several Arteries,
SHORTLY after reveille at Camp
Barrett yesterday. Just as the
sun was making 1 its appearance
over the foothills to the east
ward, Jonas Ury and James X.
MeadorsÂ«.privates in Company C,
became involved in a personal quarrel.
As the outcome Ury lies dead in the
regimental hospital, while his assail
ant is confined In the Alameda (Jounty
Jail.
The quarrel between the men origi
nated some three weeks since over a
small sum of money which Ury bor
rowed from Meadors. This quarrel
broke out at intervals, but the mem
bers of the company did not look for a
serious outcome. Meadors has been
quarrelsome since he enlisted. He
boasted freely of the men he had killed
and of the desperate encounters In
which he had participated.
The men soon gave him the soubri
quet of "Mosquito Bill," by which
name he was generally known. He at
tacked Ury on several occasions, but,
at a word from officers in authority,
desisted. The men occupied tent num
ber thirteen in the street of Company
C. Their quarrel culminated yesterday
morning. According to Meadors, there
was a dispute regarding some damage
done in the tent, for which the other
men blamed Ury. They asked Mtadors
to settle the dispute and he fixed the
blame on Ury. The latter called "Bill"
a liar, and he was about to resent it
when rollcall sounded.
Meadors was in the front rank.
Ury, who was slightly removed from
him, menaced him and during the
"setting up" exercise. Instead of going
through the regular motions. Imitated
all the blows used by boxers. As the
men went to their tent Meadors heard
Ury say: "My muscles are all right;
I'll spot old Bill, good."
Meadors drew his knife, saying, "I
THORS' ELABORATE STUDIO.
j The "Well-Known Photographer : Now
Installed in the Phelan Building.
Louis Thors, the well-known photogra
'of the' most successful studios in the
of the most successful studios in the
city, has moved from, his old quarters
i On . Graiit avenue and .is now : installed
in a magnificent new home In the Phelan
building, directly over the old"Marceau
gallery.
The apartments, specially built after
original designs by Mr. Thors, are per
haps the most complete and the most
elaborate this side of the RockieH, or, in
fact, In the entire country- Everything
from the magnificent reception room
down to the minutest detail of the ad
â  joining rooms is perfect and far and be
| yond the Slightest fault.
On the lower or main floor of the new
gallery are sltlated the reception room,
directly connected with the street below
by a special elevator erected for the pur
pose; five dressing rooms, each provided
with every facility for which It has been
designed; two dark rooms, an office, an
artist's room, a finishing room, a fire
proof negative vault in which are stored
over 120,000 negatives, and a retouching
room. All of these apartments are spa
cious, and contain every requirement for
perfect work. The reception room is
probably the most elaborate of its kind
ever designed. It is over a hundred feet
square, twenty feet high, with an art
stained glass dome directly in the center
over twenty feet in diameter. The deco
rations consist of a magnificent contrast
of Egyptian red and black, the wall fres
coing being of the former tint, and the
heavy woodwork of the latter.
On the upper floor are situated the
print or fixing room, a tone room, a sil
ver room, a special room for producing
enlargements, and the main printing
room, which extends a distance of thirty
eight feet, being covered overhead en
tirely of glass.
One of the attractions of the new gal
lery will be the life-size autotype car
bons which Mr. Thors anticipates manu
facturing by a special process, the key
to which is now on its way from Eng
land. A special artist from London has
been engaged and will assume charge of
the new department.
It is anticipated that within a. few
weeks a number of these carbons
will be ready for exhibition in the show
windows at the entrance to the gallery,
826 Market street.

the new gallery that has been built as a
special attraction to the public- la the BtU"

won't stand any man to say that."
The heated conversation of the men
attracted the attention of Corporal Si
las, who entered the tent. In the back
was Ury with his rifle in hJs hand,
while just inside the flap stood Mea
dors with his stout pocket knife drawn.
The corporal caught and pinioned
Meador's arms. The latter shouted:
"Turn me loose, or I will cut myself
loose."
Before he could do any damage the
gun was taken from Ury by Corporal
Lundholm. and the officers thought the
incident was closed.
Ury, however, started for the tent of
Captain \Y. S. Barnes, saying he would
report Meadors for drawing a knife on
him. Meadors answered:
"Hold on a minute; I'll go up, too."
He approached Ury, who put out his
hand and pushed him away, where
upon Meadors shouted:
"I have taken too many of your lies,"
and rushed at him.
He had been holding his knife up his
sleeve, and as he said these words he
sprang upon Ury, driving hi.s knife
blade in below the left ear. The blow
was so severe that it severed the facial
arteries, the inner and outer jugular
and the carotid and parotid arteries.
The wounded man was caught by Pri
vates Willett Hopkins and Thomas
Doyle, who took him nearly fifty yards
before he fell of exhaustion.
Captain Reilly of Company I ren
dered him assistance, placing a towel
in the gaping wound, and sent for the
hospital litter. The injured man was
attended by Major F. W. Dudley, reg
imental surgeon, and Lieutenant Yost
and Lieutenant McGettigan. They held
out no hope for the ultimate recovery
of Ury- When they received him he
was pulseless, and, according to Dr.
Yost, hardly a cup of blood remained
in his body.

This room contains 1150 square feet, and
is large enough to take a group picture
of from sixty to a hundred persons.
The gallery will be completed and ready
for the public within the next two weeks,
although work has already commenced
and many orders filled.
THE CHARLES HANSEN SAFE.
The Schooner Reaches Kotzebue
Sound With All Well on Board.
General J. M. Gleaves, United States
Surveyor General, received a letter yes
terday from his brother, Dr. C. C.
Gleaves, president of the Kotzebue Com
mercial and Mining Company, dated July
22. Kotzebue Sound, reporting his safe ar
rival. Dr. Gleaves and several other well
known San Franciscans were on the
schooner Charles Hansen, which was re
ported to have been lost, nothing having
been heard from her for many days over
the time when she was due. A letter
from Kotzebue Sound, via Seattle, dated
July 14, was received here a few days ago,
and in It the loss of the schooner Charles
Hansen was spoken of as an assured fact.
General Gleaves was a happy man yes
terday upon the receipt of his brother's
letter. He not only had a brother on
board the Charles Hanson, but his son,
Charles, had also shipped on her when
she left St. Michael.
The news of the loss of the Charles
Hansen came from Redding, where rela
tives of some of the passengers live. The
contradiction as Is evidenced in Gleaves'
letter will be happy news to several well
known local families, who had relatives
on the vessel. Dr. C. C. Gleavos writes
that, owing to the wrecking of several of
the freight schooners, there will be a
scarcity of food in Kotzebtie Sound this
year and that much suffering will have to
be endured.
Wanted for Embezzlement.
R. B. Dallam of Arracs & Dallnm, 230
Front street, swore to a complaint in
fudge Joachimsen's court yesterday for
arrest of Ij. J. Knight, a clerk, on the
charge of embezzlement. The specific
Charge is for embezzling $5 40 on August
15, but the total amount is not yet known.
Knight, it is alleged, has been" going
around with fictitious orders authorizing
him to collect money for the firm.
Wanted to Gro to Jail.

Meadors was arrested by First Ser
geant Joshua B. Dickson. Captain
Barnes ordered him delivered to Lieu
tenant Drady, officer of the guard.
After a few mlnutÂ«3 he was turned
over to Sheriff White, the case being
one for the civil authorities.
The assailant is an illiterate man, 4S
years of age. He has a wife and five
children in Dean Springs, Arkansas.
He came here last April and worked
for a time for Joseph Peterson, near
Petaluma, where he enlisted. He has
shown no emotion since, the encounter.
Try is a native of New York. He
came here two years since and made
his home with David Ury, his uncle, at
San Leandro. He is 23 years of age
and highly spoken of by his compan-
ions.
Captain W. S. Barnes' training as
District Attorney proved useful to
him. He secured the statements of all
concerned in the affray and of all the
eye-witnesses. This he turned over to
Colonel Henshaw, who in turn handed
it to the District Attorney of Alameda
County.
Private Jonas Ury died at 10 o'clock
last night from the wound inflicted by
Private James Nathaniel Meadors.
Coroner Baldwin has taken charge of
the remains.
The murderer will not be informed of
the death of his comrade until to-day.
Ury is not his first victim Accord
ing to a statement made by the pris
oner to-day he shot and killed an
uncle named Moore in Crawford
County, Ark., on January 24, 1875. For
this he was tried and acquitted. He
has also been in another stabbing af

any form of sexual weakness resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele, or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and 6eems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures* all the .Ills and troubles that
come from years of misuse of the natural
functions and has been an absolute suc-
cess in all cases. A request to the State
Medical Institute, 193 First National Bank
Building, Fort Wayne, lnd., stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will be complied with. The institute
Is desirous of reaching that great class
of men who are unable to leave home to
bo treated and the free sample will en-
able them to see how easy it is to be
cured of sexual weakness when the
proper remedies are employed. The In-
stitute makes no restrictions. Any man
who writes will be sent a free sample,
carefully sealed In a plain package so
that Its recipient need have no fear of
embarrassment or publicity. Readers are I
requested to write without delay.

TENNESSEE REGIMENT'S RIOT.
An Act, Which, Approaching Lynch Law, Is Unparalleled in the
History of the United States Army, So Says
General Merriam.
Major General Merriam is very much exercised as well ns indignant
over the outrageous assault committed upon the negro, Dan Thomas,
hy the mob of Tennessee soldiers, and is determined that punishment
shall be meted out to the offenders as soon as they can oe identified and
apprehended. General Merriam yesterday afternoon said:
"Tliis unfortunate occurrence, coming In the midst of g-ood feeling and
genera! g-ood discipline of the troops furnished by th*Â» Southern States, is
exceedingly painful to me. That this Southern characteristic should crop
out In one of our large camps is deplorable.
"I am not sufficiently informed at present of the origin of the disturb
ance tn express an opinion upon the merits as to the beginning of the dis
pute or quarrel. That the disturbance, tin matter what the origin may
have been, should have c\ilmlr.ated in anything approaching lynch law in
the midst of a military command is a thing never before known in the his
tory of the X'nitr-d States army.
"I have taken steps to insure a most searching investigation into the
whole affair from the very beginning. I assure the public that no step in
my power shall bo wanting in the sifting of the case to the bottom and in
the bringing to the strictest account all the guilty parties who can be dis
covered. I shull do thlp in defense of Southern honor and character, as
well as in defense of the character and discipline of the army.
"Some of the leaders in this gross breach of discipline are already
identified and are under guard at the Presidio, where General Miller la
conducting the investigation.
"I wish to be distinctly understood as saying that so far as I am In
formed rowdyism is not a characteristic of the Southern soldiers, any
more than it is of soldiers from any other part of the country. In other
words, T consider thorn as amenable to discipline as any troops that we
have. This particular regiment l^is not been more difficult to manage and
instruct than others in the Â«_amp."
Colonel Smith of the Tennessee Regiment Asks a Suspension
of Public Opinion.
HKAPQT'ARTERS FIRST TENNESSEE VOLT'NTEER INFANTRY.
Camp Merriam. Presidio, Cal.. Aug. 16.â T0 the Public: The unfortunate
ocnirence of Monday morning, brought on by a few irresponsible men of
the First Tennessee Regiment, is sincerely regretted by all of its officers
as well as by the rank and file of the command, who have expressed in
unmeasured terms thf tr disapproval and Indignation of the conduct of the
men who instigated and who were primarily responsible for the outrage.
It ie a well known fact, and one that cannot be controverted, that - Jew
bad men in a regiment can bring disgrace upon the whole organization,
however well disciplined as a whole the regiment may be. and this is an oc
currence that is liable to happen with almost any organization o. troops,
however well disciplined, whether of regulars or volunteers. An instance
Is known to have happened at Vancouver in which troops of the regular
army were the actors, and where the results were more disastrous to the
victim of the mob.
An investigation of the matter is now In progress, and the public may
bp well assured that r.o effort will be spared to bring the guilty men to
justice. I hope, therefore, that judgment so far as this organization is
concerned will be suspended until that investigation has been completed.
Ac Tennesseeans we feel keenly as officers and men the odium brought upon
the good name of our State and organization by the Impulsive movement
created by three or four excited men; and while many of those who re
paired to the scene were in the excitement of the moment carried along by
the example of others, more through curiosity than anything else, it was
not In the mad spirit of a mob. Even those who were among the first on
the scene became at once obedient to their officers. The members of this
command can be relied upon at any time to disperse and quell a mob or
perform any other duty to which it may be assigned as well as any other
organization. Respectfully sumhitted,
W.M. C. SMITH, Colonel First Term. Vol. Iniantry.
TROOPS FOR THE YUKON
Soldiers for Duty on the River
Leave Saturday on the
Steamer Humboldt,
The Alaskan Exploration Company has
received the contract from the Govern
ment for transporting the soldiers from
San Francisco to the various designated
points on the Yukon River. There were
bids from Seattle. Tacoma and Portland
for the work, but the Alaska Exploration
Company was btst fitted to do the work
expeditlously. so the contract was let to it.
The Yukon River is falling rapidly so
it is necessary to get the soldiers away
at onre anO on a fast steamer. Tr-e Ex
ploration Company offered the bteanacr
lliiiT.cOld irom San Francisco and .heir
now river steamers from St. Michael to
points on the Yukon.
The Humboldt !s one of the fastest and
best appointed vessels sailing out of this
port and she has a better record for speed
than any other steamer on the Klondike
run. The soldiers are all to be aboard
n> xt Saturday and early in the afternoon
n start will be made. The company's
Bteamer Leelanaw, which left a few days
ago for St. Michael is to tow the re
mainder of the river boats which T. P. H.
AVhitelaw built at Dutch Harbor, to the
mouth of the Yukon, so that the troops
will not be delayed waiting for boats
when St. Michael is reached.
On the return trip the Humboldt will
bring all the gold hunters who want to
get back to civilization. It is satd that
the Humboidt Steamship Company is get
ting $700 a day for their vessel, and as
they got $Sf'O a day when she was run
ning to Dyea, Skaguay and St. Michael for
J.. A. Magee Jr.. she must be better than
a mine on Bonanza <"reek.

WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
The Head Camp of the Pacific Jurisdiction
to Meet in This City Next Week.
THE Head Camp of the Woodmen of the World, the fourth of the Pa
cific jurisdiction, is to he held in this city next week, commencing on
Monday, and the sessions are to be hold in Pioneer Hall. There will

the States of California, Nevada,
Oregon, Washington, Utah, Mon
tana, Colorado, Idaho and Wyo
ming, and these represent a mem
bership of 36.000. Of this number
more than 6000 are in the State of

membership in the jurisdiction
has increased nearly 17,000. Cali
fornia has 104 camps, twenty-two
of which were instituted since last
January, four of them being in
this city.
Among the many matters that
are to come up for legislation will
be a proposition to have triennial
sessions; to establish a reserve
fund; to provide a sick benefit
and an accident fund; to Increase
the number of classes that are
deemed hazardous; to Increase
the age at which candidates may
be admitted; to provide an educa
tional feature as a qualification
for membership; to discontinue
active work in cities of more than
200,000 Inhabitants, and the re
ducing or the total abolishment
of charter fees for new camps.
The board of head managers will arrive In Oakland to-morrow, and
will remain in session three days, supervising the accounts and looking
after the reports that are to be presented.
The delegates from Denver, Colo., will reach this city on next Friday.
The others will be here on the following day.
The indications at this time are that F. A. Falkenburg, the head con
sul, will be re-elected and that I. I. Boak of Oakland will be re-elected to
the board of head managers. Henry Remel of Pasadena and J. A. Mc-
Guffin from the northern part of the State will be California's candidates
for honors in the head camp.
The reception committee, consisting of J. L. Geary Jr. of Golden Gate
Camp, 11. G. Smith of Redwood Camp, C. N. Brown of Western Addition
Camp and W. W. Brackett of Mission Camp, all of this city, will have
charge of the entertainment of the officers of the head camp and the dele
gates.
The following is the programme that has been arranged for the week:
Monday evening, reception and ball at Native Sons' Hall. Wednesday
mornintâ Excursion from Pacific-street wharf to bay points on the Caro
line, for delegates and ladies only. Eveningâ Exemplification of the secret
work. Thursday eveningâ Banquet to the deleprates at the California
Hotel. Saturdayâ Alameda day; irrand reunion and picnic at San Lorenzo
Grove. Sundayâ For delegates only, trip to Golden Gate Park and Cliff
House in carriages.
THE SIXTH ENTERTAINED.
Reception to the California Vol
unteers by the Native Daugh-
ters' Red Cross.
The reception tendered last night by the
Native Daughters' Red Cross AJd to the
Sixth California Volunteers in Native
Sons' Hall was a great success. There
were present a large number df the offi
cers and men of the Sixth, who were wel
comed in a patriotic address by the sec
retary of the society, Miss Eliza D.
Keith. Her remarks. Callfornian to a
degree, contained beautiful sentiments
that were frequently and loudly applaud
ed. The response on behalf of the com
mand was by Major G. G. Grant. After
thanking the Native Daughters he said
with regret that the brave boys of the
Sixth were disappointed that "they did
not have an opportunity to do duty at the
front. He added that it was with pride
that he could say that there had not been
one disturbing element, not even a quar
rel, in the command. Then followed a
programme consisting of music, recita
tions and a drill by a c.orps of the Sixth,
after which there was a generous colla
tion for the soldiers and dancing.
Reception to Soldiers.
The Epworth League of the California
Street Methodist Church entertained the
Twentieth Regiment of Kansas Volun
teers last night. The musical and literary
programme and the supper which fol
lowed proved most enjoyable to the boys
in blue, who showed their appreciation "of
the kindness of the church society by ap
plauding the one and doing complete Jus
tice to the other. This is the fifth recep
tion which the Epworth League has held
for the benefit of the soldiers.
If a man looks up his family tree he's
sure to discover monkeys on some of
the branches.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 17, 1898.
A GLANCE AT
REAL ESTATE
Prospects Encouraging
for the Future.
MANY SALES NEGOTIATED
TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PAST
SIX MONTHS.
A Review of the Records, New Build
ing Contracts, Recent Sales and
General Realty
Notes.
Real estate is still slowly undergoing
the anticipated change which the brokers
generally prophesied for it at the close of
the summer season. Business in every
department is becoming brighter, and
sales, both large and small, increasing in
number.
During the past seven days many nego
tiations involving considerable value were
successfully made and a number planned
for the future. Among the large sales re
cently recorded was that of the property
situated on the corner of Mason street
and O'Farrell alley, which has changed
owners three times within the past two or
three months. It was sold by the firm of
A. M. Speck & Co. to ex-Superintendent of
Streets Ashworth for an estimated price
of $22,500.
Building seems to be continually on the
advance, and many contracts were let
during the past week. The record shows
a perceptible increuse in operations all
over the city, and the total number of
contracts recorded exceeds the weekly
records of the past three months by near
ly half. The number of mortgages during
the week was unusually large, and the to
tal amount of the pledge greater in value
than the record for the preceding week.
The number and value of the. real estate
transactions recorded during the first six
months of the present year, according to
Edward's Criterion, were 1207 sales,
amounting to $4,230,984.
The totals for previous years are sum

there were 275 C sales, amounting to $10,- |
302,5 x::; for the year 1596 there were SBM

SOLDIERS CAN'T REGISTER.
Volunteers From Tulare and
Los Angeles Counties Make
a Vain Attempt.
Registrar W. J. Biggy had several diffi
cult questions to decide during the closing
hours of registration of voters:
"I was approached by a delegation of
eight soldiers from Los Angeles who
wanted to vote here." said Mr. Blggy yes
terday. "They claimed that they pro
posed" to reside ninety days in San Fran
cisco and were therefore eligible for reg
istration. I ruled iigplnst them on the
ground thnt their stay was compulsory;
that they did not know how long they
would stay, not being free agents. They
were dissatisfied and said they would get
an attorney and take legal proceedings,
but I have heard nothing from them since.
Another perplexing question arose over
the attempt of Notary Greenblatt to reg
ister soldiers from Tulare County,. so that
they could send back their votes. There
were a number of young fellows who had
become of age since the last registration.
Greenblatt wanted me to supply him with
blank affidavits to take the depositions of
these soldiers, so that he could forward
the same to the Clerk of Tulare County. I
iisked him If he had received any author
ity from the Clerk there to act, and he re
plied that he had not. So I refused the
blanks, knowing of no law that permits
such a proceeding."^
War Incidents.
Orders were Issued last night for three
of the remaining companies of the New
York Regiment to board the transport
Alliance to-morrow at 11 o'clock. The
companies are F, G and 11. The steamer

General Merriam has telegraphed to the
War Department suggesting the advisa
bility of sending to Manila the troops that
were assigned to the Arizona, as these de
tachments have been designated to com
plete the regiments that have been for
warded. Should he receive an affirmative
reply the Arizona will sail at once with
the troops.

Post HoÃpital on Monday night of capil
lary bronchitis. His remains were taken
to Oakland yesterday by relatives, where
they will be Interred.
General Miller moved his headquarters
from Camp Merritt yesterday to the Pre
sidio. The presence of the general and the
fact that his headquarters is in the
midst of the camp will have the effect of
suppressing any further demonstration
upon the part of any of the soldiers of the
various regiments.
Battery A. Third Artillery, will sail on
tin Mumboldt on Friday or Saturday for
Si. Michael.
Again Charged With Bobbery.

CORBETT KILLS HIS WIFE AND THEN HIMSELF
A Terrible Tragedy
Ends Two Happy
Lives.
JEALOUSY WAS THE CAUSE
JIM, THE PUGILIST, FAINTED
WHEN TOLD THE NEWS.
The Old Pionser Used a Revolver
With Shocking aaid Fatal
Effect in His Hayes
Valley Home.
Jealousy, produced by the hallucina
tions of a disordered mind, caused Pat
rick J. Corbint, the Hayes Valley livery
etable keeper and father of Jim Cor
bett, the prizefighter, to send two re
volver bullets into the brain of his wife,
Catherine, and then turn the weapon
upon himself. Death came Instantly
and mercifully to the two old people
who had lived In happiness for near
half a century.
. The double tragedy occurred a few
minutes before 5 o'clock yesterday
morning at their home, at 51$ Hayes
street. It was a terrible shock to a
large family of sons and daughters,
now grown to man and woman hood,
and during the day dozens of friends
called to express their sympathies for
those afflicted.
Harry Corbett, one of tho sons, at
once sent word by wire to his brother,
James Corbett, who is now in New
York, preparing for his coming contest
with Kid McCoy. It has since been
learned that the son in the East fainted
â when he heard of the shocking tragedy
in his Western home, and tor an hour
the wires were kept busy answering
questions about how it all happened.
As stated, the man was out of his
mind when he committed the act. He
arose early, as he was accustomed to,
and after dressing, all but putting on
his coat, he placed the muzzle of a re
volver to the temple of his sleeping
â wife and pulled the trigger and a bul
let was sent into her brain. A second
shot was fired into her face below the
right eye and this also found lodgment
in the brain. Once more the savage
â  weapon barked and he, too, fell
dead, across the body of his wife, who
had not even moved in her bed. Four
chambers of the revolver were found
to be empty. When the fourth shot
was fired no one seems to know, for
only three muffled renorts were heard |
by the relatives in the house. Charles |
A. King, a son-in-law, rushed into the j
room and, seeing what had happened, j
placed the old man on the floor and |
went for a doctor, while Kate Corbett,
a daughter, ran for the priest. When
the man of God and the man of medi
cine arrive 1 it was too late, for life In
both victims of the tragedy had fled.
Death came so suddenly to the old lady
that she simply passed from one sleep
to another, and of him who did it it is
safe to say that his mind never cleared
' nor that he comprehended what hia

hand had committed. The Coroner was
notified and Deputy Hallet responded,
but he permitted the bodies to remain
at the house with the family.
Within the past week or ten days
many things have happened to con
vince the friends and family that Mr.
Corbett was not in his right mind at
times. A month ago Mrs. Corbett and
her daughter, Esther, went to Bartlett
Springs, as has been the custom of the
family for years. Two weeks ago
Esther returned and Kate took her mut
ing. Last Wednesday Mr. Corbett
joined his relatives at the springs and
he had not been there more than a day
before it was apparent that his mind
was not as it should be. As an in
stance, Jie became Intensely jealous of
his wife, who had passed her sixty
second year and whjase weight had
about reached the 300-pound mark. To
more than one he accused the flne old
lady of "winking at other men," and
when these thoughts were uppermost in
his mind he would wander away for
hours and refuse to have anything to
do with any of his family. His condi
tion became so bad that Mrs. Corbett
decided to take him back ,to their

be much improved while around the
house, but his friends noticed that he
acted strangely at tin
During Monday afternoon, while
standing in a cigar store, he was a
how he felt, to which he answered that
"I never felt better in my life and
still am badly troubled with sickness."
Late in the evening Dr. Robert J.
O'Connell of 731 Hayes? street called into
the stable in a friendly way, and before
he left the old man offered to give him
all of the money in the safe and in his
pockets, although there was no obliga
tion existing, saying ho had no us> for
it. A few minutes later Mr. Corbett
went upstairs, where his manner
changed at once, and he appeared as
rational as ever. For a time he sat
and read the papers and then went to
bed. accompanied by his wife. Charles
A. King and his wife occupied the old
couple's bedroom, the latter for the
time being occupying a room in the
rear of the dining-room. A little after
4 o'clock in the morning Mrs. Corbett
entered the apartments of the younger
couple, for she heard her grandson, the
four-months-old King, crying, and
finding nothing very serious she went
back to bed and all went to sleep again.
Less than an hour later the tragedy
was enacted.
"The strange part of the tragedy is
A LAND WHERE MURDER IS SUPREME
The Dagger and the Pistol the Chief Factors of Practical Politics in
Guatemala.
"On the nig;lit poor ITIr. HI eye r. the diamond merchant,
was so cruelly slain Ilicre wore live oilier murder** in thin
city. â¢ Ho you can obtain a Blight conception of what kind
of law and order, prevails* here, and \Â»ha< security there
is for human life." â Extract from a letter from Guatemala.
Owing presumably to press censorship very little is known of affairs politi
cal and criminal in Guatemala, but through private correspondence 4 some start
ling news such as given in the foregoing occasionally reaches the outside
world.
The letter referred to was written by a prominent business man of Guate
mala to a firm In this city. From his description of the social conditions that
exist there It is anything but a comfortable place to reside in. In the course
of his communication the writer says that these are campaign times, and that
the contest is a bitter one, assault and murder being common methods adopted
to promote the interests of the opposing leaders.
When the campaign opens up in earnest the rival contestants for power col
onize- the city with the ignorant find vicious Indians from the interior, some
thing after the fashion of the famous "lodging-house district" of the "Blind
White Devil" in San Francisco. These aborigines are in a constant state of in
toxication, owing to the generous supply of native firewater, and are ready for
any deed of violence or bloodshed.
If some political worker becomes too prominent, and one of the leaders fear 3
his influence, he is marked for extermination, and the knife or bludgeon of an
Indian does the Job.
For this reason men of any prominence even in business or professional life
fear to be on the streets after nightfall. However, this does not always save
them from assassination.
The writer of the letter gives an instance illustrating this fact. He had a
friend, a wealthy and well known German diamond merchant, who ooccupied
apartments fit a hotel of that city. Howas a quiet, inoffensive gentleman, who
took no Interest in political affairs, and attended strictly to his personal busl
riesa Speaking of this man's tragic and dreadful fate the correspondent says:
"I must tell you about my poor friend Meyer, the diamond merchant, who was
butchered here a few evenings since forpurposes of robbery. About 8 o'clock p.
m. I stf-pped into the. billiard hall adjoining the hotel and found Meyer playing
billiards with a well-dressed, gentlemanly looking native. They were having a
pleasant contest, and after watching the game awhile I retired to my sleeping
room. I remained awake for some time, and just as I was about going to sleep
.1 heard a blood-curdling: scream that I will never forget. When its source was
located poor Meyer was found lying in his room with his throat cut from ear
to ear, and despoiled of his personal jewelry, which included some valuable
gems.
"While the excitement was at its height the man with whom the merchant
had been playing billiards walked coolly along the corridor and down the stairs.
Some one on the upper floor called to the crowd below to stop the man. and
after a struggle he was taken. When his cloak was removed It was found that
the fellow's hands wore bathed in the fresh blood of the murdered diamond
merchant. It was afterward learned that the assassin and two others had In
veigled Meyer to his rooms on the pretext that they desired to purchase some
Jewels. The moment the door of his room was closed on him his doom was
Bealedj but he succeeded In crying out, and thus bringing about the capture of
his slayer.
"As an illustration of what 'police protection' means here, I will state that
the authorities immediately took charge of the dead man and his property, and
that when the German Consul investigated the ease he found that aside from
what the murderers had taken there was a tray containing $20,000 worth of
diamonds missing. The police disclaimed all knowledge of the whereabouts of
the property, but a strong protest to the President brought forth an order to
the Chief of Police that if all the valuables were not returned within two hours
his official head would drop. The property was promptly handed over to the
Consul.
"on the same night that poor Meyer was slain, there were five other mur
ders in this city. Assassination is so common that people seem to have be
come hardened to it. The trouble is that there is so much corruption In office
here that crimes against person or property are seldom punished. The natural
result is most shocking lawlessness. Extreme hard times have made the thieves
and cut-throats more desperate than usual, and daylight robberies of pedes
trians and places of business are alarmingly prevalent In the center of the city.
As financial conditions are not improving, it is Impossible to tell -That further
evils the times may lead to."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 17, 1898.
where father got that pistol," said
Frank Corbett. "He always had a hor
ror of firearms of all kinds and never
to my knowledge has he owned or had
such a weapon around the house. This
' is a brand new revolver and he must
j have purchased it yesterday. While I
' knew that he was acting a little queer
i I had no idea that he would ever got
jso serious as to do such a thing. In
! fact we all thought that the trip to the
I springs would do him good, but I fear
j that the heat there was too much for
j his head and brought on a condition
that completely upset his mind."
That the thought of self-destruction
was in old man Corbett' s mind is ap
j parent from the fact that on Monday
i he attempted to purchase some arsenic
iin a neighboring drugstore, but the
| clerk refused to sell him any, because
his reasons for asking for the poison
were not sufficient. He said that he
wished to kill some rats and that the
ordinary rat poison was of no account.
i When evening approached Mr. Corbett
evidently changed his mind about end
ing his life, for he called at the precinct
registration place around the corner
and had his name recorded among the
voters of Hayes valley, a thing that he
has not missed doing for the past thirty
years. In this act there was a little
Incident of more than passing note.
Jim Silver the clerk who registered
Mr. Corbett, 'had performed a similar
service for the father of John L. Sul
livan, the pugilist, many years ago.
''n that occasion the elder Sullivan's
name was the last to be placed on the
register and in this instance the name
of the father of the man who van
quished the then champion was the last
to go upon the register of Precfnct 6
of the Thirty -seventh District.
SHvey and Corbett spent some time
discussing the merits of the two fa
i.-v Ms pugilists and the probable result
of the coming contest of Jim with Kid
McCoy. The old man had apparently
no doubt as to the ability of his boy
Jim to whip any man in the ring, in
cluding Fitzsimmons. At the conclu
sion of the conversation Corbett re
turned to his stable and after the de
parture of Dr. O'Connell he remarked
to one of his employes that he had
just, registered and that it was the last
time he would ever register. Even
then in his demented condition he must
have contemplated some violent act.
This unhappy streak of insanity seems
to have come to him through his fam
ily, for one of his sisters, Margaret
Griffin, is now in the asylum at Napa,
wh^re she has been for several years.
This unfortunate woman also had peri-
ods when her intellect became over
clouded and she was seized with the
desire to do violent acts.
Those best acquainted with the Cor
betts say that a more affectionate fam
ily would be hard to find. The sons
consist of Harry, Frank, James, Joseph
and Joha, and the daughters of Esther,
Theresa, Mamie â¢nd Kate. Esther and
Kate are still single. It is generally
conceded that the mother's favorite
was Jim and even his entrance into the
prize ring did not make any difference
in the matter of her love for him, nor
of his love for her. Whenever he would
come home from any of his trips
abroad he took particular delight in
having his mother give a reception to
her friends. On those occasions he
would have her sing some of the sim
ple Irish ballads so dear tj those who
come from the old country. It has long
been the wish of the parents to have
Jim retire from the ring and he prom
ised to do so. The aged lady was look
ing forward to the time when her son
would enter into some mercantile pur
suit, for which his education had fitted
him.
P. J. Corbett was born in County
Mayo, Ireland, sixty-six years ago, and
he came to this country' when a young
man. He first went to the Southern
States, but not finding such an oppor
tunity as he wanted he and his wife
crime to California. Many years ag.r
he followed the milk business and had
a ranch near Twin Peaks, but he
gave this up and in time drove a hack.
Later he was a part owner in an under
taking business and afterward went
into the livery stable business In Hayes
valley, where he bought property and
made his home. Several years ago he
met with some reverses, but when his
son Jim came into fame as a pugilist
and made some money he helped the
old man out of his difficulties and since
then the elder Corbett has been doing
a prosperous business. The family as
serts that nothing in the shape of busi
ness could have worried him as he had
more than recovered from the losses of
former years.
Mrs. Corbett was always recognized
as the soul of human sympathy and
good humor. She was particularly ac
tive in church work and not a fair
was held but found Mrs. Corbett
among the first to give liberally of her
time and money. With the little ones
she was well loved, for it was her
pleasure to gather a lot of tots and till
them with candy and ice cream, some
times to the horror of nervous matn
mas. She was 62 years of age and wan
born in Dublin. She comes from a fam
ily well known in the old country'- The
unfortunate couple would have been
married forty years next November.
An inquest was held late yesterday
afternoon, but the testimony presented
before tho Coroner's Jury threw no
light upon the terrible double tragedy.
The jury returned a verdict to the ef-
feet that P. J. Corbett had killed him
self while temporarily Insane and that
Mrs. Corbett had come to her death at
the hands of her husband. Arrange
ments for the funeral have not yet been
made, but it is expected that the inter
ment will take place in Holy Cross
Cemetery.
The Pugilist Grief-Stricken.
NEW YORK. Aug. 16.â James J. Cor
bett was much shocked when he
learned of the death of his parents.
At first he refused to believe it, but
when the news was confirmed he broke
down and wept like a child. His train
ers, McVey and White, tried to console
him, but to no purpose. Corbett said
that his father must have become in
sane or he would not have committed
such a terrible deed. He could not ac
count for it In any other way. Both
his father and mother, he said, took a
deep interest in his affairs and keenly
felt his defeat by Fitzsimmons at Car
son. They both wanted him to retire
from the ring after that.
Corbett said that until he had re
ceived more definite information from
California he could pot say what his
future plans would te.
He will stop training for the present,
and the fight with McCoy at Buffalo on
September 10 may be postponed.
Corbett, after a consultation with his
friends, said that he received letters on
Saturday informing him that his
I fathers' mind had become unbalanced,
; and he therefore thought that while
j suffering mentally his father commlt
< ted the double crime. Corbet t said he
: had telegraphed to San Francirco and
i that he would leave for the coast this
evening if the bodies are held until he
} can arrive.
At present he could not say what
would be dune about his fight with Mc-
Coy. II" declared that if it was neces
! sary he would forfeit the $2500 he had
i up.
TWO CLAIMANTS TO
KLONDIKE NUGGETS.
CHAELES HOGUE LOST A SACK
ON THE STEAMER.
He Accuses Mrs. Zorn, a Lady Pas
senger, of Finding the Stuff and
"Holding It Out."
It is possible t.iat the courts may have
to decide the ownership of some gold dust
and nuggets brought from the Klondike
valued at $359. Mrs. Zorn arrived in the
city a few days ago with her three chil
dren from Dawson City. She left her hus
band there and is on her way to Los An
geles to visit friends. Charles Hogue, at
present stopping- at the Golden West Ho
tel, was ;i passenger on the same steamer
from Dawson city.
Hague had been working a mine with
some others and sold his share, receiving
$389 in gold dust and nuggets, which he
brought with him in a sack. He lost the
sack on the steamer and for some unex
plained reason suspected Mrs. Zorn of
having found it.
Mrs. Zorn yesterday took some gold dust
and nuggets to the mint to get it ex
changed for coin, and Hogue, who was
also there, asserted that ho recognized one
of the nuggets as his property, which Mrs.
Zorn indignantly denied.
Policeman Menihan was summoned and
Mrs. Zorn and her children were taken to
police headquarters, accompanied by
Hogue. The lady declared that the gold
dust and nuggets were given her by her
husband before leaving Dawson City, and
Hogue as stoutly asserted that one of the
nuggets was in the sack which he lost.
Detective Dillon, who took charge of the
ca so, advised Hogue to swear to a com
plaint for Mrs. Zorn's arrest, but he de
clined to go so far. Mrs. Zorn was al
lowed to go, but if Hogue should change
his mind this morning she, she says, can
easily be found.
BLACK RESIGNS OFFICE.
Judge Daly Succeeds Him as Assist-
ant District Attorney.
Alfred P. Black. Assistant District At
torney and prosecutor in Judge Wallace's
department of the Superior Court, has
resigned his office. His resignation was
handed in to John A. Hosmer, who, dur
ing the absence of William S. Barnes,
who is stationed with his regiment at
Camp Barrett. Oakland, is Acting Dis
trict Attorney. It was accepted and Mr.
Black's connection with the office was at
an end. Walter S. Hinkle has been ap
pointed to take Black's place, and Joseph
J Dunne will take the place vacated by
Mr. Hinkle in Department 11 of the Su
perior Court. No reason for the resigna
tion of Mr. B'.ack is given, but it is said
that he is seeking nomination on the Re
publican ticket for Superior Judge.
Mr. Black has proved one of the most
powerful prosecutors in the District At
torney's office.. His resignation will
doubtless prove a joy to the criminal
class, which he so mercilessly prosecuted
during his term of office.
To Test an Ola Fee Bill.
Charles E. Trower, as assignee of the
executors of some NS estates, filed suit
yesterday to recover $5400 from the city
and county. The sum sued for is the ag
gregate of amounts pnid to the County
Clerk by the executors of the various
estates "pursuant to the provisions* of
"an act to establish the fees of county,
township and other officers and of jurors
and witnesses in this State." It is al
leged that the net is unconstitutional and
suit is brought to recover the fees.
Ho for Manila.
Collector Jackson received a dispatch
from Washington yesterday as follows:
"Vessels may clear for Manila."
