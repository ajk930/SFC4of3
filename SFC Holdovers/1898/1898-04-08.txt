W'hÂ«Â»re the Fabu.ous Wealth
; -Early yesterday afternoon the
. schooner Vine called U through the
'.". h^ads and dropped anchor well up in
; tire bay. Her chains had hardly
. stopped rattling through the hawse j
. pipes? when six travel-worn passengers
; -.fumbled over the side Into a waiting
' Whitehall boat and made for the shore, j
; The utmost air of mystery surrounded i
them as they stepped up the stairs of
the landing, and without a word to any !
of the. inquisitive dock loungers they
smarted up town.
1 The. Vine sailed away from this port
about the middle of November last
bound, as her clearance papers stated; j
â yh a cruise-to Central American-- ports
and .the islands of the South Pacific
Ocean. At the time she left there .was
much mystery about her mission.
â¢ Stories were then current that she had i
â¢started out upon an expedition that j
; had for its end the location of a treas- j
ure, and a treasure of. such fabulous j
. "wealth as the weavers of fiction in the j
.-â wildest flights of imagination never
â ' : even dreamed of.
'...'. Their mission, undertaken with all
; |the secrecy that envelops expeditions
: Of its nature, was to find and dig for
; .the stolen gold and jewels of a proud
/â¢government, that for sixty years have
.Jain hidden upon a rock-bound island of
: .the Pacific.
â¢â¢/ : ,<P'eEpite the multitudes of obstacles
-.-.th.at..confronted them, the men of the
: party claim they were successful, that
'-â¢tja'e treasure of $18,000,000 was located,
â¢'â¢!a,nd in less than two years from now
-:';iJloi-5;00,000 of it will be divided between |
Willis Aumock and his wife. A. E. Gra- I
ljam, Edward Graham, Hugh Stewart
and Eugene R. Avers. These six per
sons claim they are the only people in
the world who hold the secret, and \
without their knowledge it will be im
possible for any one to carry away the
princely fortune that in 183S was stolen I
by the crew of the bark Mary Dea of !
Boston, Mass., from the Peruvian Gov- j
ernment and buried upon Cocos Island.
This is the story of the robbery as
they tell it:
In 1838 the bark Mary Dea, under the
command of Captain John Keaton,
palled from Boston for Callao. Peru.
The name of the first mate of the bark
was Thompson. At that time the Peru- j
vian Government was engaged in her j
bitter struggle with Chile, and the for
tunes of war were such that when the
Mary Dea arrived at Callao that city
was momentarily expecting an invasion
from the besieging forces of Chile.'
None of the warships of the former
Government happened to be in the har
bor at the time, and in order to save the
funds of the National treasury, the
church, plate and the wealth of many
private individuals, the Peruvian Gov
ernment sought the protection of the
United States flag, and Captain Keaton
was importuned for a goodly considera
tion to hide the treasure upon his ship
until the crisis had passed.
This he consented to do. and the im
mense, treasure, consisting of gold, sil
ver and diamonds was secretly brought !
: aboard the Mary Dea and stored away.
A guard was posted to keep watch over
It. The temptation was more than Cap
tain Keaton could withstand, so during
, : the silent watches of the night the
guard was overpowered and murdered.
- the anchor chain was slipped and the
: (uichor left behind, and the criminal
captain and his band of fellow thieves
' pet pail and got away undiscovered.
'"â¢They reached Cocos Island eighteen
-.days later and buried their treasure.
.1.. Maddened beyond the point of human
' endurance, and with their blood boiling
for revenge for the theft, that had been
perpetrated upon them, the Govern
;. ment officials of Peru as noon as they
â â â  could communicate with their warships
pent one of them to catch the Mary
Pea. The bark was overhauled three
days after leaving Cocoa Island, the
crew were killed, and Captain Keaton
and Mate Thompson were taken aboard
the warship to be carried back to Foru
to tell where they had buried the treas
ure or to puffer the penalty of death.
While the ship was returning to
Callao It was becalmed, and as fortune
would have it an American whaler was
also becalmed near It. For some
strange reason Keaton and Thompson
were allowed the liberty of the deck
and they saw and recognized the
American whaler. They managed one
night to slip past the guards and get
over the rail to the water. Then they
swam to the whaler and here fortune
fi^aln favored them. lyÂ»r before their
absence was discovered a breeze sprang â 
up and the American vessel spread her j
sails. When the sun rose she was out
of sight of the warship.
The two men gave assumed : names
The San Francisco Call
WILLIS AUMOCK, the Leader oF the Cocos Island
Treasure Hunters.
and told some weird story of capture
and harsh treatment to the captain of
the whaler. The officers of the Peru
vian warship when they missed their
prisoners supposed that tl.ey had at
tempted to swim to the other ship and
that they had been drowned in the at
tempt, and besides the whaler having
disappeared they did not know in which
direction to search for them.
After eighteen months spent at sea
Captain Keaton managed to get back
to Boston with his secret undivulged.
The chance of fortune had, however,
separated l}im from Thompson. Keaton
guarded his secret with a jealous
silence, and ten years after his return
to Boston he fitted out a ship to go and
bring back the treasure. The crew was
a mixed one, and they managed to get
wind of the purpose of the voyage and
mutinied, so the disappointed Keaton
was forced to return.
He was not to be outdone, however,
and five years later he associated with
him a Captain Bogue, and the two
again set sail for Cocos Island. They
landed there safely and found th#treas
ure, but such was its magnitude that
they were afraid to take It aboard for
fear the crew would learn of It. "Con
sequently they secreted about their per
sons $20,000 apiece in gold and diamonds
and started to return to Boston. When
the ship reached Panama Bogue by
accident fell overboard in twenty
fathoms of water and was drowned,
and that part of the ill-gotten treasure
that he had with him was lost.
Force of circumstances prevented
Keaton's ever again making another
attempt to recover the treasure, but be
fore he died he informed his son-in-law.
Young, of the secret he ha"d carried
with him all of his life and which had
only res-i iel in th* most bitter ,iis
:ippointments to him. Young was never
in a position nor had he the means to
attempt to search for gold.
Several years ago Willis Aumock met
Young in Mexico and they became
friends. This ripened into Intimacy,
and in a mutual exchange of confi
dences Young told Aumock of the hid
den treasure and offered for a sum, to
sell to him the secret of the spot where
it was buried. Aumock had heard of
the tr.-i'fwc, but had never pi .Â«."Â«. 1 any
faith in it. Young gave him indis
putable evidence that the treasure was
in exister.ee and that it could be found.
The bargain was consummated be
tween the two men. and Aumock paid
Young a large sum for it. He then
took Young to Boston with him, and on
September" 13, 1597. in the city of Pitts
burg, Aumnck'a home, the San Fran
cisco Mining Company was organized.
The members of the company left
Pittaburg September 13 in charge of
Aumuck and \v. M. draham. They
came to this city and remained here for
some time, preparing for the trip. The
schooner Vine, under the command of
Captain John E. Burns, was chartered
for $5500 and freight privileges which
amounted to $8800, and on November 13
the entire party set sail.
Mate Thompson, who had been vrlt'.i
Captain Keaton when they made the'r
escape from the Peruvian warshlo,
made his way to the Hawaiian Islandd,
where he subsequently lost his mind.
H<> is r.u.p;if f.ed to be alive to-*lÂ£./. It
was from him that Augustus Gessler
of Stockton is supposed to have get
the secret of the treasure also, and
about ten years ago he set sail for _"o
cÂ«>s Jshnid in the sloop Hays :â¢â¢Â»(?.. This
island belongs to the Government of
Costa Rica, and Inasmuch as the Peru
vian Government long ago abandoned
all claims to the treasure, believing
that It was lost forever, the former
Government claimed it.
Captain Gessler proposed to find the
hidden wealth if the Government of
Costa Rica would give him two-thirds
of it. This it agreed to do, but the
captain was unable to find it. He was.
however, made Military Governor of
the island by the Government in hopes
that he might some day unearth the
long lost millions, but so far he has
been unable to do so. He has, how
ever, remained upon the island, and
whenever fortune-seekers have come
to its shores to find the treasure he has
invariably specified that they, if sue
SAX FRAISI CISCO, FRIDAY, APRIL 8, I^9B-TWE^TY PAGES.
' cessful, must pay the Government of
Costa Rica its one-third and himself
an eighth of the remainder. Aumock
knew Gessler before he left San Fran
cisco, and when Gessler sailed he
laughed at what he supposed was a
wild goose chase.
Aumack and his party tell of many
indignities they suffered at the hands
lof Captain Burns. In describing the
voyage Aumock said: ,
"Captain Burns, the owner of the
Vine, made a good thing out of the trip.
He treated us in the most abominable
manner. He promised an abundance of
good, wholesome and substantial food.
but Instead we only got spoiled beef
and ham. We kicked, but It was no
good. My wife did her cooking In her

I could beg or borrow from the cook. She
I was refused hot water by the cook j
upon several occasions. When we had
been out two weeks Colonel Hugh !
â  Stewart asked for clean towels, and
â  was told by Burns that he got all he
I had paid for. He must have cleared
j nearly $5000 on the trip. He got his
money in advance. He himself had

I m*al. but he would give us none of it.
! On the return trip he abandoned the
I Vine at San Jose de Guatemala and re
' turned here by steamer, leaving the
'â  Vine in charge of the first officer, A. E.
| Krnall. It took us sixty-three days to
crawl up the coast to San Francisco.
"We reached Cocos Island on Janu

consisted of seven persons â all Ger
mans, two women, a baby and four
men. They were planting coffee and

but only four are under cultivation.
Gessler recognized me and asked me
what I had come there for and I told
him I was there to search for the treas
ure.
I found over two hundred holes where
former seekers of the treasure had dug
for it. I at once realized that even if I
found the treasure Gessler would
never let me bring it away, and even
if he had I would have been afraid to
take it aboard the ship. He watched
me very closely, but I managed without
his knowledge to satisfy myself as to
the exact location of the treasure, and
that it was there.
As soon as I had done this we ran
some false line* and dug two holes as
a blind to throw off Gessler. I know
from the location of the treasure that
he can nev.er find It, and that I and
my party are the only, ones who will
ever be able to do so.
"The Peruvian treasure Is burled in
one place, but there is upon the island
$30,000,000. The other was hidden
there by pirates who buried it in caves.
All the old landmarks have been oblit
erated by time, but still the location of
the treasure is known and it will be
found."
Willis Aumock and party will return
to Cocos Island as soon as the corning
rainy season is over, properly
equipped and armed, and in a perfectly
legal and legimate manner will treat
with the Government of Costa Rica for
their share in the treasure for the re
vealing of its whereabouts.
MISS CLARA BARTON

NEW YORK. April 7.â Stephen Bar

SPAIN WILL NOT YIELD
AND THE SITUATION HAS
GROWN VERY MUCH GRAVER
LONDON, April 7.â A
special dispatch from Madrid
says the Embassadors of
France, Germany, Russia
and Italy waited together
this evening upon Senor
Gullon, the Foreign Minis
ter, and presented a joint
note in the interest of peace.
Gullon, replying, declared,
according to the dispatch,
"that the members of the
Spanish Cabinet were unan
imous in considering that
Spain had reached the limit
of international policy in the
direction of conceding the
demands and allowing the
pretensions of the United
States."
MADRID, April 7. â The guards
around the United States Legation
were trebled to-day. General Wood
ford was at his desk at an early hour
and many Americans called to ask
about arrangements made for their
protection. The General said he
would remain here until directed to
apply for his passports or until they
are handed to him.
Inquiries show that General Wood
ford yesterday believed Spain would
accept the proposed armistice and
that orders to that effect would be
immediately promulgated in the of
ficial gazette. Other diplomats also
expected a satisfactory solution of
the crisis, but at the moment when
the Cabinet Council was convening
Minister of foreign Affairs Gullon
received the following letter from the
United States Minister:
"Having fruitlessly awaited since
noon yesterday for the decision of the
Spanish Government, it is my duty
to annour.cs <Â« you that I will still
await an+il niidnight. I oeg of you
to kindly communicate this decision
before midniglit, and I hope the de
cision may be couched in terms which
may prevent the sad consequences
that I should greatly regret, but
which I believe inevitable if things
continue in their present state."
The letter was sent as a private
communication. During to-day's
meeting of the Council Minister
Woodford sent in a note, in which he
declared tnat when he sent the con
fidential notes yesterday he had not
received a dispatch from President
McKinley announcing the postpone

THE AMERICAN LEGATION AT MADRID.
NEW YORK, April 7.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: War at any price. Curious
how the situation fluctuates. Last
night there was a big peace move on.
As a result of the developments here
to-day most everybody is talking war
again.
The President and his official ad
visers are looking graver and talk
ing seriously and almost hopelessly
of a peaceful outcome.
This effect is partly due to the com
bined action of the powers in soliciting
the reopening of negotiations with
Spain, but mainly to the failure to re
ceive news from Madrid announcing the
issuance of a proclamation by the
Queen-Regent declaring in favor of an
armistice along the lines of President
McKinley's demands, which were pre
viously refused by the Sagasta Min
istry.
As stated in the Herald this mornine.
Â»the President had been led to expect
that the Queen intended to issue such
proclamation, and information which
reached him yesterday was to the effect
that the formal proclamation was to be
published to-day. This expectation,
coupled with representations which it is
knowrr the combined powers would
make to-day, was one of the principal
reasons for delaying the President's
message.
The situation in Havana, as described
by Consul-General Lee, was only partly
responsible for holding back the mes
sage.
The failure of the Queen Regent's
proclamation to materialize has
caused the President to regret that
he did not let the message go to Con
gress yesterday.
He will hold back until Monday and
trust to fate for some peaceful solution
in the meantime, which does not now
secrri possible..
The exchange of notes between the
representatives of the six European
powers and the President has been the
great event of the day, but it has not
enhanced the chances for peace as far
as Washington is concerned. Briefly
the point in the joint note of the powers
was in the nature of a suggestion for re
opening negotiations with Spain.
The President deftly ignored the
suggestion, and conveyed in unmis
takable terms that if there were any
GENERAL LEE WILL LEAVE
HAVANA ON SATURDAY.
NEW YORK, April 7.â A Tampa special to the Herald
says: The Mas-iotte did not arrive from Havana to-night. It came
as far as Key West, and then returned to Havana to bring all n*
the American citizens away that are desirous of leaving. The Oli
vette left to-night Instead of last night, as had been reported, on
regular schedule time, and will proceed to Havana to escort Gen
eral Lee and the rest of the American citizens to this country on
Saturday morning. They will arrive here Sunday night. This is
supposed to be the last boat that will enter Havana harbor before
the President's message goes to Congress.
further negotiations they would have
to come from the other side and
would necessitate a yielding by
Spain to the demands which have
been made.
It cannot be learned whether the
powers will now join in an effort to
force Spain to comply with these de
mands, but I have high authority for
the statement that France, ItaJv and
Austria and also the Pope are exerting
their best efforts to induce the Queen-
Regent to issue the armistice proclama
tion which was promised yesterday.
The authorities appear to have no
further concern about the possible joint
action of the powers in opposition to
the President's intervention plan, which
it has been fully and finally determined
to put in force just as soon as Congress
carries out the recommendations of the
President, providing, of course, there
is no complete backdown on the part of
Spain between now and Monday.
It is perfectly well understood by
the President that Great Britain is
in entire sympathy with the deter
mination of the United States to put
an end to Spanish misrule in Cuba,
and without the assent of that
nation there is no reason to fear that
the majority of the other powers
would units in any active opposition
against the United States in the
event of war with Spain.
As to the view the administration
takes of the joint action of the powers
to-day, it can best be told in^this author
itative statement given me to-night:
" There will be no changes in the
recommendations of the President.
PRICE FIVE CEXTS.
SPAIN REJECTS
LEO'S MEDIATION.
BERLIN. April 7.â The Mad
rid correspondent of the Co
logne Gazette says: "The papers
of the American Consulate have
already been intrusted to the
care of the British Consulate. At
midnight the Pope mad<* fresh
confidential representations to
the Spanish Government and a
second Cabinet council was then
held. But the reply was to the
effect that the Pope's interven
tion had come too late, as a de
cision had already been arrived
at.
If anything, he will strengthen his
message. His recommendation is
for immediate intervention, and it is
his purpose to send his message to
Congress on Monday.
"If there is to be any further pressure
by the powers in the interests of peace
it will have to be upon S->ain and be
tween Spain and the insurgents. The
President's note is polite, but firm.
Since the rejection of the tender of
good offices made by the powers there
have been no new negotiations, and the
President does not intend to reopen
them on any basis short of complete
compliance with his demands, which
were previously rejected. When Min
ister Woodford asked President Mc-
Kinlcy what self-government meant he
replied it was independence from Span
ish misrule.

DID LEE ASK
FOR DELAY OF
THE MESSAGE?
A F^cn)arKable Statement Corrjes
prom a Correspondent Who

Copyrighted, ISSB, by Junei Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, April 7.â The Mascotte left this afternoon with eighty
passengers, a much lighter list than hod been exp< cted. Many were
anxious to go, but were unable to secure passports. Tho Mangrove
went out this evening carrying forty-six American cititena. The Yu
catan, six days out from New York, arrived this afternoon, having
put in at Palm Beach first to learn whether war had been declared.
Arrangements had been made for the Yucatan to stop at Key West,
carrying passengers anxious to land there, but trouble about passports
made this unnecessary and the Yucatan went on its way to Vera Crua,
carrying a very large passenger list for that port.
Word has been received here that the Olivette is at last on the
way to Havana, running under two-thirds steam, one boiler being
crippled. She will leave Saturday with not less than 300 passengers, the .
authorities promising to hurry passports.
Rumor has it that the American consulate will close on Saturday,
but General Lee refused to discuss the matter.
I asked Captain Cowles if he had received such instructions and
was told that it was impossible for him to discuss orders at this time.
One thing is certain, Lee has not asked the President to delay
his message.
He thinks ample time has already been given Americans to leave
the island. If there are new prospects of settling the difficulty by
arbitration Lee has not been so Informed. Discussing the matter to
day he sUid to me:
"I w. ; instructed several days ago to inform Americans that it
might be well for them to leave Havana. I have done so. That in
struction has not been withdrawn, so I am led to believe the admin
istration thinks the situation to be as critical as ever. The Spanish
authorities have treated me as they always do, with the greatest
courtesy. American consuls in all parts of the island are free to move
as pleases them and stories to the contrary are false."
This has been a religious holiday and has been strictly observed.
To-night the Vnlunteers' band is rendering sacred and patriotic music
in the Parque Central, which is crowded with people. The crowds
seem to understand the critical condition of affairs, but are perfectly
orderly.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, April 7.â The report was made to-day to' the
agents of the Boston Fruit Company that the company's fast steamer,
Brooklyn, which left here yesterday for Santiago de Cuba to take off
American citizens, had arrived at that port and had taken aboard
many citizens of the United States. I was told by the agents mat the
Erooklyn is expected to arrive at Port Antonio to-morrow.
Another steai. or owned by the company, the Beverly, is on the way
to Cienfuegos, where she will take passengers. She will go thence to
Key . est and from there to Boston. Both steamers were charterea by
Consul Dent, at this port, on special cable orders from the State De
partment in Washington.
I am also told that the Boston Fruit Company's entire fleet of eigh
teen fast vessels will be put at the service of the United States Gov
ernment at once and that the ships of the Atlas line which are here
will also be sent Spanish ports to take away American citizens.
view. The President will naturally in
corporate something in his message
about the note offered by the powers,
and his reply. The President knew yes
terday of the intention of the powers to
submit a note, and his reply was pre
pared last night and delivered this
morning. The ostensible reason for
withholding the message was, of course,
to prevent trouble in Havana, but the
President naturally desired to be cour
teous and hear from the powers."
The other view was given me by one
of the foreign representatives partici
pating in the international conference
at the White House to-day: "There
can be but one end to the rrtatter â
peace with honor. Evidently the Presi
dent was sincerely grateful for the prop
osition of the powers. It was not me
diation, nor can it properly be termed a
tender of good offices. It is solely an
appeal to the humanitarian instincts of
the President and people of the United
States. There will of course be further
communications with our Governments
as a result of the conference, and it is to
be hoped that negotiations will be re
opened between the United States and
Spain. All the President wants, as in
dicated in his statement, is the restora
tion of peace and order in Cuba, and
when this is accomplished it is all the
public sentiment the United States can
ask for.
"As to compelling the insurgents to
accept Spain's terms, it can be only done
morally â all the powers and the United
States giving their moral support to
Spain's efforts to suppress the insurrec
tion. If they refuse there can of course
be no forcible intervention, but the in
surgents will be treated as they deserve,
as outlaws and criminals.
"As to the plan of settlement, Spain
will be urged to grant the insurgents
the fullest autonomy, such as is enjoyed
by Australia, and the powers will pledge
themselves to cause her to carry out
this programme."
It is manifest that if the powers
cannot induce Spain to make any
further concession than those out
lined in this statement made to me
"by one of the representatives con
cerned in tha conference there is no
hope for peace.
It is true that President McKinley in
his message written to-night takes the
firm ground that there must be interven
tion to restore peace and order before
there can be recognition of indepen
dence. But it is equally true that his
demands upon Spain, hitherto rejected,
required the independence of Cuba from
Spain. Since the Queen-Regent is oow
erless to grant independences without
the action of the Cortes, it is not clear
to them how the Madrid authorities will
be able to make a proposition to sat
isfy either the President or the Ameri
can Congress, and in the opinion of al
most every one here to-night war is in
evitable.
That both houses of Congress are
now thoroughly satisfied to wait until
Monday before taking action is shown
by the fact that both have adjourned
over until that day, and even if Presi
dent McKinley should receive informa
tion to-morrow or Saturday that Con
sul-General Lee had succeeded in get
ting all the Americans out of Cuba, he
could not send in his message before
Monday.
There were no new developments of
importance in either House to-day. but
Representative Grosvenor'., speech in
the House and assurance that the ad
ministration was pursuing the most vig
orous policy tended to lessen much of
the friction among Republicans. No
further progress has been made toward
framing the resolutions which will be
reported from the Committee on For
eign Relations in the Senate and the
Committee on Foreign Affairs in the
House, and efforts which have been thus
far made to secure concert of action be
tween the two committees have not met
with success. There are to be further
conferences between the Republican
members of the two committees, how
ever, and it is possible that by Monday
they may have agreed upon the form
of the resolutions.
The question of whether or not the
present so-called republic of Cuba shall
be recognized is the bone of contention
in both committees.
Official information received here late
to-night gives the substance of the
Pope's proposals for the maintenance of
peace between the United States and
Cuba. If Spain will agree to grant an
armistice the Pope will use his efforts to
induce the United States to withdraw its
fleet from the vicinity of Cuba.
It had been expected by the represen
tatives of the several powers here that
the Queen-Regent would accept the
Pope's proposition.
Her failure to issue the decree ar
ranging for an armistice is regarded
as conclusive evidence by diplomats
that the Pope's negotiations have
failed in one important particular,
that regarding the withdrawal of the
American fleet, and it was this fail
ure which caused the Queen to de
cline to entertain the armistice pro
position.
From officials of the administration it
is learned that the President has been
advised, through Minister Woodford, of
what the Vatican has been doing, but
the President has firmly made up his
mind to recommend intervention to
Congress, and in view of the necessity
for carrying out this policy it follows
that Captain W. T. Sampson's squadron
must be within as short a distance of
Havana a? possible in order that the na
val plan of procedure may be executed
with the utmost dispatch. For this rea
son the President and his advisers think
that the fleet should remain at its pres
ent anchorage, and Minister Woodford
has probably been advised to this effect.
I have it from an official source to-night
that Minister Woodford has completed
all his arrangements for leaving Madrid
as soon as he is notified to do so.
HEARD SENOR
QUESADA'S STATEMENT.
A Member of the Cuban Junta Tells
of the Conditions on the
Island.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â The House
Committee on Foreign Affairs had
Senor Quesi.da of the Cuban Junta be
fore It an hour to-day. Queeada said
when he came out that the committee
had enjoined secrecy upon him.
He was asked as to the Covernment
of the republic of Cuba, vhich the
United States is requested to recog
nize, and members say he gave a full
and satisfactory statement. He de
scribed the territory in possession of
the insurgents, the government of
Puerte Principe and Santiago prov
inces. In the former province* he said
there were 250,000 people who acknowl
edged allegiance to the Cuban Govern
ment.
Four hundred thousand, he said had
been collected in taxes. The capital of
the republic had been twice dislodged
but it was in working order. He ex
plained the functions of the Govern
ment. If the United Stat j should In
tervene without recognizing the inde
pendence of the republic, he said. It
would be a virtual declaration of war
against the insurgents as well as the
Spaniards.
Mr. Quesada will appear before the
committee again to-morrow.

PEACE PARTY
IS ALL GONE
Mark Hanna Said to Be
the Only Surviving
Member.
One by One the Senators Have
Thrown Up Their
Hands.
Evan th* President I* Said to De-
Jlavo Now That War Ii
Certain. Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 7.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: Sena
tor Mark Hanna seems to be the only
surviving member of the peace party
in the Senate. One by one the advo
cates of peace at almost any cost have
deserted him and joined the war party.
Senators Aldrich, Allison, Spooner and
Platt of Connecticut were among the
very last to reach the conclusion that
war is inevitable. Senator Elkins
threw up his hands and declared that
he could withstand the logic of the sit
uation no longer, and he is now con
vinced for the first time that hostilities
are unavoidable and he is prepared to
accept the resolutions for action which
the President will set forth in his mes
sage. Senator Elkins says he is con
vinced that all further efforts in the
direction of peace will be futile.
The President was confronted by
these troublesome propositions. An out
right declaration of war by Congress,
and on the other hand an act recogniz
ing the independence of the so-called
republic of Cuba was proposed.
One of the friends of the administra
tion in Congress went to the President
and advised him of the sentiment pre
vailing in the House and Senate and
he felt himself impelled to take a
strong positive position In favor of in
tervention on lines that could be fully
justified in the eyes of the world.
In the opinion of Senator Elkins
nothing short of an intervention of
providence can prevent hostilities be
tween the two nations. Notwithstand
ing the conflicting opinion expressed by
certain Senators as to what the next
forty-eight hours will bring forth, the
President has assured all of his Sena
torial callers to-day that his message
is made up and no further negotiations
are pending between the United States
and Spain.
Nn concessions will be made, and no
proposition for concessions will be en
tertained, except it be that the Spanish
flag be lowered at Havana and the
Spanish forces withdrawn from the
island of Cuba.
SPAIN WILL
NOT YIELD

withdraws the statements made in
the previous note."
The excitement in Spain has reach
ed the boiling point, but there are no
demonstrations recorded anywhere
yet. All the steamship companies of
Valencia have offered all their vessels
as privateers and a number of ship
captains have called upon the naval
commander at Barcelona, asking for
letters of marque. Similar requests
nave been received from abroad, es
pecially from France.
The Heraldo's leading article ap
plauds the Government's conduct in
replying to General Woodford, whose
proceedings, the article says, are con
sidered extraordinarily brusque and
blamable. Briefly summed up, the
Heraldo's information points to the
fact that war is inevitable, but that
newspaper still attaches importance
to tha action of the Minister's powers
at Washington.
United States Minister Woodford
has issued the following statement to
the Spanish press:
"The Madrid newspapers of this
morning are filled with statements
concerning the American Minister
which are so inaccurate that he asks
the courtesy of the press to correct
them. He does this in the interest of
friendship and peace.
"The proprieties of his diplomatic
position forbid his making any state
ment with regard to his diplomatic
action with the Spanish Government.
But last September the Spanish For
eign Office received written permis
sion to publish the taxt of any offi-
cial correspondence which he should
have at any time with the Spanish
Government and this permission is
eriective to-day. The Spanish Gov
ernment is at complete liberty to
publish every word he has ever ad
dressed to the Foreign Office by let
ter, memorandum or statement.
"The second Secretary of the
American Legation has sailed for
New York to resume the practice of
his profession. He has resigned from
the diplomatic service. The American
Minister's wife left with her niece
for France Tuesday night. She is in
poor health and the excitement of the
past fortnight has compelled her to
seek rest. The daughter of the Min
ister remains with him at Madrid.
He has not given up his residence,
where he expects to reside so long
as he shall remain accredited to the
Spanish court.
"The American Minister has re
ceived nothing but courtesy from the
people of Madrid. He has never had
the slightest apprehension as to his
own personal safety or that of his
family. He is working for peace, and
despite all rumors to the contrary, he
still hopes peace will* be kept be
tween Spain and the United States
and that peace will soon be re-estab
lished in Cuba, based upon absolute
justice, with protection for the great
American interests in that island and
the maintenance of the honor of
Spain."
After the Cabinet council this af
ternoon it was stated that the advice
of the Pope had been favorably con
sidered.
SPAIN MUST
FREE CUBANS
The United States Will
Be Content "With
Nothing Less.
This Condition Is Perfectly
Understood at the
Vatican.
StUl tho Popa Continue to ChÂ«rlÂ«h
thÂ« Hope of at Peaoolul
Solution.
Bpeclal Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LONDON, April B.â The Rome cor
respondent of the Dally News says:
The Vatican received to-day a dis
patch from a personage whose name
cannot be mentioned, running thus;
"President McKinley says an armis
tice between Spain and the insurgents
must lead to the evacuation of Cuba."
From other Information that has ar
rived at the Vatican it appears that
Spain wishes to find a formula to save
the situation and that the United Stales
will avoid war only if the armistice
means that Spain is going to leave the
island and is ready to sign for evacua
tion.
Spain will deceive herself if she asks
an armistice from now until October,
namely, during the rainy season, only
because in this period It would be im
possible to continue operations against
the insurp nts. An armistice may
nominally bÂ» to send home sick soldiers,
but in reality it must signify evacua
tion. A free Cuba will only satisfy the
United States and it is in order that
Spain may make up her mind to the
loss of Cuba that President McKinley
delays his message.
All news received goes to conhrm the
belief that the United States cannot
and will not retire from this position.
Spain must give way if she wishes to
avoid war, having, besides her other
burdens, the Carlist and Republican
dangers to ward off.
The Pope's action continues to in
fluence Spain in this direction. The
latest telegrams to the Vatican say
that the President's message to Con
gress may be further delayed should
the negotiations on Monday next be
still pending on the lines of the evacua
tion of Cuba. If Spain yields the mes
sage will be conciliatory. If not it will
correspond to a declaration of war.
The foreign office asserts that the
false report from Madrid about the
Washington Government requesting the
mediation of the Pope has very much
embittered the American people, ren
dering even European collective action
difficult.
ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS
THINK WAR CERTAIN
Even the London Times Cannot See
How a Conflict Can Be
Averted.
LONDON, April 8. â The morning
papers' editorials on the Cuban situa
tion are all pessimistic, at the most
only hoping that the dslay until Mon
day will enable some peaceful influence
to work. The Times cannot see how
a conflict can be averted.
The Daily News points out that In
both America and Spain it is the peo
ple and not the rulers who desire war.
The special dispatches from the con
tinent to the morning papers likewise
record the same feeling of hopelessness
of avoiding a conflict Austrian Minis
ter Hengel-Muller yon Hengervar has
cabled from Washington to the Vienna
Government in a very unfavorable
tone.
According to a dispatch from Gib
raltar to the Daily Telegraph Spain
has contracted with certain firms for a
quantity of English coal for her fleet
at Cadiz at the fabulous price of 45
shillings a ton, owing to the Welsh
strike.
A dispatch from Berlin says the
Lokal Anzeiger publishes a conversa
tion with a director of the Hamburg-
American steamship line, who ex
pressed a belief that his company
wouiu reap large profits if war broke
out. He said he expected that German
vessels would get possessior. of the
bulk of the carrying trade now in the
hands of Americans, whose ships would
be exposed to t l - Â» danger of capture.

NEW YORK, April 7.â The report
that the Hamburg-American line had
intimated its willingness to sell the
Is rmannie, the Columbia and the
Fuerst Bismarck to the Government
was authoritatively confirmed here to
day.
The board has received instructions
to inspect the steamers upon their arri
val in this port. The Fuerst Bismarck
is due here on April 22; the Normannie
on May 13 and the Columbia on May 8.
It is general]- understood that the
Government is not willing to pay the
price asked for the St. Louis and St.
Paul of the subsidized American line,
and that the Fuerst Bismarck, the Nor
mannta or the Columbia could be
bought for much leÃs than either of the
American liners.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â lt was ad
mitted at the Navy Department that
the auxiliary board had instructions
to Inspect the Hamburg-American
liners, as well as those of the other
trans-Atlantic companies. The inspec
tion, however, was stated to be merely
in line with the general work of the
board to inspect all ships which might
be available lor naval use.

OmiQous Sigos of a Revolt if the
President attempts to De

NEW .YORK, April 7.â Washington special to the Herald says : It
"is. not believed to be possible ta-night that the President will delay In
his message beyond Monday, Should he do so there would be grave
danger of Congress taking the whole matter out of his hands. There
was no meeting to-day of the Republicans who have, been co-operating
to bring about speedy action, but the committee of nine appointed yes
terday to take full charge of the matter .was In session twice during the
day. Little was done further than to talk over the situation and to ar
range for conferences between now and Monday with the leading Re
publican Senators who believe there should be no delay beyond that
date. , : . 'â Wit. ':-â â â 
While there waa no open action looking to -It, some of the more
earnest of those who believe It 1b the duty of Congress to act at once,
e<ven though it may be necessary to break away from the administra
tion, busied themselves in obtaining Republican signatures to a pledge
to unite with the Democrats and overrule the Speaker, ot do anything
else that may be necessary to make action certain on Monday.
Representatives Lorlmer and Mann of Illinois are among the lead
ers in the movement. The names of those who have signed the pledge
will not be made public, but it is said that more than nfty names are
attached to it. Should this be true and should even half of these men
stand by their pledge, there will be action on Monday, as but twenty
four Republican votes combined with the full Democratic and Populist
strength of the House is needed to constitute a majority.
The Republican leaders of the House are fully aware of what is
going on and they are exerting all of their power to prevent the break
ing of their ranks and to have whatever action is taken supported by
the solid Republican vote of the House.
MORGAN IN
FIERY MOOD
Believes It Is Time for
This Country to
Strike.
Willing to Vote for a Declara
tion That Will Cause
War.
Some Sharp Talk in the Senate Over
a Proposition to Improve
Mobile Harbor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April
Some sharp war talk was indulged in
by the Senate to-day. When considera
tion of the sundry civil appropriation
| bill was resumed the question pending
j was an amendment by Pettus of Ala
| bama providing for such Improvement
j of the harbor at Mobile as would en
able war vessels to obtain coal and
other supplies there. Allison of lowa,
in charge of the bill, made a point of
order against the amendment. This
called out a bitter speech by Morgan
of Alabama, who charged the appro
[ priations committee with discriminat
ing against proper measures and
threatened to assist in dissolving the
; committee.
Allison replied with some spirit say
ing: "As to the threat implied by the
Senator from Alabama, if I know my
self, I do n.t crave the work that is
now imposed upon me by the Senate.
If the Senate wants to dissolve the
committee it may do so without delay."
Morgan followed with an argument
showing the necessity for the improve
ment proposed, saying that it would
open to the Government in case of war
the coal fields of the South and enable
it successfully to fight the monopoly
that had been formed to control the
coal supply of the country In the event
of war.
Continuing, Morgan said: "I do not
know, Mr. President, whether war is
coming or not. I have never myself
done anything that might involve this
country in war, but it seems to me
that sworn testimony now before the
Senate is sufficiently strong to com
pel us to strike in defense of ac honor
and dignity of the country and in
memory of our dead seamen shrouded
in the mud of Havana harbor. I am
willing to vote for a declaration that
may involve us - hostilities because I
believe that we have a just cause."
Allison had a telegram read from
Secretary Alger, saying that while he
was willing that the improvement
should be made, to be done within the
discretion of the Secretary of War,
he thought the outer bar should be left
for the present so as to prevent the
too ready ingress of foreign hostile
ships.
"It is better not," the Secretary's dis
patch read, "to open any deep harbors
that would admit warships. It would
make simply one more place to guard."
On this telegram the chair overruled
Allison's point of order and submitted
the question to the Senate whether the
amendment should be considered.
An aye and no vote was taken on this
proposition and resulted in the nega
tive, 19â32. The vote had the effect of
ruling the amendment out of order.
At 2 o'clock the bill was laid aside,
and Walthall of Mississippi presented
resolutions on the death of his late col
league, Senator James Z. George. Those
who paid tributes to the memory of
Senator George were: Walthall, Proc
tor of Vermont, Turpie of Indiana, Bate
of Tennessee, Teller of Colorado, Gray
of Delaware, Platt of Connecticut and
Money of Mississippi. At 4 o'clock, as
a further mark of respect, the Senate
adjourned till Monday.
SHIPPING CATTLE TO

cattle that the northern counties have
besieged the Governor's office with pro

The Governor, in recognition of the pos

Great Preparations on the
Fleet at Key
West
Sampson Receives Orders
Which He May Modify
at Any Time.
It Is Evident That There Is Some
Apprehension of Spain's
Torpedo Boats.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., April 7.âCondi
tions here have undergone a decided
change within the last twelve hours.
The latest news has aroused the belli
cose spirit to a greater degree than
ever. Naval men b'ieve that a con
flict is a question of a few days only,
and the long delay has merely increased
the ardor of thÂ« men, who were con
stantly in readiness for a call to quar
ters. The enthusiasm is especially
marked on board the flagship Isew
York. When the news was conveyed
there this afternoon Captain Sampson
maintained his customary reticence, but
the other officers -.-ere confident that it
meant hostilities.
The most significant development is
the orders just received from the Navy
Department on the plans of action.
These provide that in the event of a
blockade of Havana or Matanzas the
first line of battle nearest the shore
would be composed of torpedo-boats
and tugs, the second of cruisers,
such as the Marblehead, Detroit, Cin
cinnati and Nashville and the gunboat
Helena, and the third of the battleships
Indiana and lowa and the flagship
New York.
In case of an attack on the American
fleet by any small vessels these will be
engaged by the first two lines, the plan
being to afford the greatest protection
to the battle-ships from the torpedo
boats of the enemy. Should the attack
be made by a superior force, such as
the Vizcaya or the Almirante Oquendo,
the first two lines would retire, leaving
the attacking vessels to be engaged by
the battle-ships.
While it is accepted here as a fore
gone conclusion that this plan will be
executed, should necessity arise, it
comes from the department more as a
suggestion than as an order, and Cap
tain Sampson has full authority to vary
the plan or ignore it at will.
The receipt of the suggestions, how
ever, is taken as the best indication of
the approach of the long awaited con
flict.
The Mallory Line steamer Comal has
arrived from New York with a cargo
of provisions and 800 cases of ammuni
tion for the fleet, which have been in
process of transfer throughout the day
She brought also several six-pounders'
which will be mounted on the Man
grove. The latter is expected from Ha
vana to-night or to-morrow, and In the
event of war, will probably serve as a
dispatch boat. The cruiser Detroit re

The Spanish Minister of

His Opinion.
Says There Is No Threat c
a Ministerial Crisis in
Spain.
But the Government Has Already
Yielded Too Much to the
United Slates.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
MADRID, J rll 7.â Several of thÂ«
papers publish statements by General
Correro, Minister of War, apparently
authentic, in which he denies that the
Government is threatened? with a min
isterial crisis. He is represented as
saying that wh^n the dispute with the
United States entered the acute stage,
one Minister of the Cabinet council re
marked: "Gentlemen, since in accept
in- this post of honor we must be
unanimous, showing ourselves ready if
necessary to sacrifice our lives, we are
all resolved to stand firm in this atti
tude."
"As might be expected," said tMÂ«
Minister of War, "the answer "was
unanimous in the affirmative. Having
examined the Cuban Cabinet's mani
festo, I loyally informed my colleagues
that I could not sanction the expression
'Cuban nation' in relation to an arm
istice or certain other expressions, es
pecially 'suspension of hostilities'
which could n> t be employed without
dishonoring the army unless a petition
emanated from the insurgents. Senor
Moret, desiring to avoid a conflict, crit
icised the attitude of myself and other
Ministers, but our arguments convinced
him.
"A cable message -was immediately
dispatched to the Governor-General ot
Cuba to the effect that the Peninsular
Government accepted the manifesto as
an accomplished fact, but adhered en
tirely to the energetic note already
sent. Consequently there has been
nothing to warrant a crisis."
Referring to the possibility of a con
flict with the United States, General
Correro is represented as expressing a
hope that it may still be averted, "be
cause it is known that President Mc-
Kinley's message to the American Con
gress will refer neither to independence
nor to intervention."
General Correro added: "In thug
changing his attitude, President Mc-
Kinley responded doubtless to Spain's
determined conduct, and had we not
bowed our heads at the time we suf
fered our first humiliation we should
not find ourselves where we are to-day.
I am not one of those who blindly shout
'victory' should there be a rupture and
hostilities, but I believe that of the two
evils war is preferable to humiliation."

of the Charter Club candidates.
ding to the assertions made by
Mr. Felkner, the "gang" was to go to
the length of false swearing in
g to prevent the election of
San ford E. Smith. thr> candidate of the
New Charter dub for Mayor.
In the course of the remarks made
b) T. A. Carroll, chairman of the ad
immlttee, It was shown that
y for the entire New Charter
â¢t was assured. This conclu
!s drawn from the reports of the
si ra who h:ive been and are now
In the held making a house-to-house
iss of the voters on a thorough
and systematic plan.
"At the last meeting of the members
of the committee who have undertaken
the canvass of the precincts in behalf
of the New charter Club," said Mr.
â¢ 11. "reports were submitted. These
were very encouraging. Indeed, they
phowed a splendid line of work. They
Bhowed the work of 400 men devoted
entirely to ascertaining the probabili
ties of the election on next Monday.
I must say that I never saw a better
exhibit of work In this line. Almost
every precinct showed us close up with
our opponents, and In most precincts
the reports Bhowed that the candidates
of the New charter Club would get two
â¢ to one >f the other candidates.
"No precinct showed us more than a !
mere fraction behind our opponents. I
think these reports ought to encourage
us to rene rta on .Monday; to
bring our people together and show the
'gang' that the patriotic work of the
New Charter Club and th other organ
izations that are assisting us Is appre
ciated and understood by the people of
the community. We are going to win
this fight and win it good." [Applause]
>nel Hardy reported that on Sat
urday night a grand ratification meet
ing under the auspices of the New
Charter Club would be held at the cor
ner of First and San Carlos streets,
where able speakers will make ad
dresses.
O. O. Felkner made the address of the
evening. He l"-Â£r:m as follows:
"This Is the tlnre to look along the
line of the enemy to Bee what his plan
of battle is to be. I have a few things
that I want to say to you. and I hope
that every one here will make it his
particular business to hring this infor
mation to the knowledge of every one
ho knows."
He then sug-geated that every precau
tion be taken to inform the voters that
they were to vote for all five Council
and that they must not by any
mistake vote for more than fourteen
members of the appointing 1 board, as to
d'> the latter would Invalidate the bal

WHY WORKINGMEN
SHOULD JOIN THE
FIGHT AGAINST REA
SAN JOSE. April 2.â Representing, as this organization does, the- labor-
Ing class, and recognizing the fact that the consumer and more generally the
laboring people have to pay the greater proportion of the tnxes.we consider
It to our Interest Just as much as it Is to the Interest of the richer people to
help the cause of good government. It Is to the Interest of every decent,
honest and self-respecting resident of San Jose to change the existing state
of affairs.
Another reason why the workingmen should support the New Charter
Club as a whole is the fact that capital is driven away from this city by the
existing conditions, which have been brought about by the corrupt and ex
travagant rule of the "gang." I know of Instances where very wealthy
men have come here for the purpose of going Into business, but have left
without doing so. They told their friends they did not want to invest their
money in a place where they would not be able to do business without the
consent of the "gang." or without being under obligation to the local polit
ical boss.
As an organization composed mostly of men who work for wages or sal
aries, we consider it to be the duty of all working people to give their united
strength to the support of the New Charter Club ticket.
This is the first time that the people of this city have had the chance
to express themselves on a clear, well-defined issue involving good and eco
nomical government as against corrupt and extravagant rule. The mass of
the people of San Jose have been trying for years to overthrow the boss
and gang rule, but have always been misled by the real Issue being be
fogged. For this reason they have never before been able to accomplish
their purpose.
For the first time the real Issue Is now clearly presented to mem. They
are given the opportunity of voting for the New Charter Club ticket, prom
ising all that Is good in municipal administration, or for the People's Mu
nicipal ticket, representing all that is undesirable.
It has been reported around town by adherents of the "gang" that the
New Charter Club has ignored the other good government organizations. As
a fact, the representatives of our club appeared before the Charter Club and
submitted a list of names to be nominated. These representatives were
shown every consideration that could have been expected. As a result we
have Indorsed the straight Charter Club ticket and are heartily supporting
it. We shall not only vote for it. but our members are now out working
for It in the most energetic manner, and we are confident of Its success
from top to bottom. â¢
In our opinion the success of the New Charter Club ticket means the
honest administration of our municipal affairs and a low rate of taxation,
which will induce an Influx of capital and home-seekers, which we consider
necessary for the growth and progress of our city and the prosperity of the
laboring people.
As an organization we appeal to every worklngman and mechanic and to
every man who is in employment as a means of livelihood to support the
nominees of the New Charter Club in the coming election, and so free our
fair city from the Incubus of bossism and corruption.
Â® Â®
Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®@Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®Â®@
want to say that men do not begin to
plead 'Not guilty* unless they consider
they are accused. It does not neces
sarily follow because some persons
have" had to pay for their positions that
the Board of School Trustees are the
culprits. Bribery is difficult to trace.
Its ways are too devious. I say this:
That the Board of Trustees, being com
posed <>f sensible men, with sensible
advisers, know as well as we do that
they are safe in offering that reward.
"First, the receiver of the bribe dare
not tell it for the very reason that he
lays himself liable to imprisonment in
the penitentiary for fourteen years. In
the second place the giver of the bribe
dare not tell, because of the very same
reason, as he would be liable to pun
ishment under section 165 of the Penal
Code. I tell you this: That a man who
has hunted coons very long, knows
whether or not a coon has been along
the path, whether he sees the coon or
not. He knows its tracks. Any man
with intelligence, who has lived in this
community any length of time, must
know that there must have been some
thing radically wrong in the disposal
of public patronage.
"The methods that are being used by
our opponents are worthy only of the
demons of the nether regions. It has
come to my knowledge in a way that
justifies me in declaring to you to
night as a fact that a part of the plan
of the enemy will be to vote dead men
at the coming election by the use of
certain foreign elements under the lead
ership of a certain captain, an express
man <>f this city. This same express
man is reputed to have entered into a
compact with the ring to deliver the
goods on election day. This voting of
dead men will be attempted particular
ly in precincts Nos. 2. 15 and 16. This
same leader is to likewise spring a sur
prise; perhaps on the morning of elec
tion day on one of our candidates. He
is to secure and make public an af
fidavit that our candidate for Mayor,
Mr. Smith has entered into an agree
ment or made a proposal to this ex
pr-ssman that for the delivery of a
certain number of voters in favor of
Mr. Smith the latter will appoint this
expressman to the position of driver of
a water cart (cynical laughter). I want
to remind you that forewarned is fore
armed.
"Another thing that has come to my
attention is the report that the super
intendent of the power-house of the
First-street electric railway has agreed
with the 'gang' to deliver the solid
vote of his employes to the boss. A
certain ex-Supervisor is assiduously at
work among the German citizens of
this city. The plan is to appeal to
national prejudices, to national habits
and modes of thought. This certain
ex-Supervisor, being himself of that
nationality, is to use his utmost en
deavors to work against the candidates
of the organization on the ground that
this organization is made up of a lot
of preachers, cranks and fanatics, who
are in favor of depriving the citizens of
this community of their national civil
rights.
"Now. knowing that this is to be their
plan, let us work earnestly to establish
what is the fact; that this organization
! is made up of the soundest thinkers, the
broadest-minded citizens of this com
munity â of thoughtful men who have
not only the welfare of this community
at heart, but who would not for one
moment recognize the right of this or
any organization to deprive any citizen
of the rights guaranteed us by the laws
of the land. This organization is the
representation of right, truth, purity,
justice and gofld government striving
against corruption in high places,
place-seekers and spoilsmen. (Great
applause.)
"Again, there is one about whom I
speak very tenderly, because of the
fact that at this time hf is lying on a
bed of sickness. Yet justice to this
community, justice to this organiza
tion, justice to me and my friends de
mands that I make known a certain
fact It Is reported of Judge Spencer,
who I believe is posing, or at least al
lowing his name to be mentioned, as a
friend of the New Charter, that he has
given the 'ring' his assurance as a
learned jurist, in whom a large per
centage of the citizens of this com
munity have great confidence, that he
will tear the new charter Into frag
ments, no matter how they may fix it
up.
".Vow, do you want to let anybody be
deceived into voting for a man who has
declared his lack of confidence In the
new charterâ his belief that it is a rot
ten, sinking hulk; his belief, as he an
nounced in an argument made in court,
that It is the profundity of chaos? Do
you want to elect a man to a position
where it lies in his power to prevent
the operation of that charter with all
its beneficent Influences â a man who
attacks it as an enemy and attempts to
scuttle it like a Dirate would scuttle
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 1898.
on the high seas? Do you want the
citizens of this community to be de
ceived into voting for a man who has
thus expressed his opinion of the c har
ter which we want to see put into
force? No â a th ;sand times no.
"These are some of the surprises that
j will be sprung upon us. These are some
; of the unfair advantages that will be
; taken of us. These are some of the d -
â  ccits that will be attempted to be prac
ticed on the voters on ne:-. I Monday.
Let us, however, hone that. In spite of
, all this, every citizen will do his duty
on next Monday and wipe out boss rule
! and bury it beyond resurrection for
| ever." [Applause.]

CHARLESTON, W. Va., April 7.-Mar
garet Mather, the actress, played her last
death scene in the fourth act of "Cym
beline" in this city last night. She col
lapsed and was carried off the stage in
: an unconscious condition and never re
| gained consciousness. She died at 5 p.
,m. of convulsions caused by acute
! Brighfs disease. Miss Mather's parents
j live in Detroit. No arrangements nave
| been made for the funeral.
DETROIT, April ".-Margaret Mather,
as she was known on the stage, was
Margaret Flnlayson, and she was horn
in 1862. Her father, John Pinlayson, is
still living In Detroit. Margaret passed
her childhood among squalid surround
ings not tending in any way toward de
voting her attention to the stage. After
she left home, a half-grown girl, she en
gaged as dishwasher in the Russell
House. Having a chance some time later
to join a barn-storming troupe she avail
ed herself of it, with the result that in
1880, while in New York, she attracted
the attention of Manager James Hitt
who persuaded her to take a course In
a training school. After two years of
study In the part of Juliet she made her
debut in that character at McVicker's
Theater, Chicago, in 1882. Miss Mather
had been twice married, her first husband
being Emil Haberkorn, an orchestra
leader. She was divorced from him and
shortly after she married Gustav Pabst
the Milwaukee brewer. This marriage, too.'
was a failure, with the result of another
divorce. Her latest venture was a mag
nificent production of "'"ymbeline," under
the management of Bert C. Whitney of
Detroit.

SAX JOSE. April 7.â At its meeting
to-night the Charter Club passed the
following resolution:
"Re=o!ved. That as this is the last
meeting of the New Charter Club before
the day of election, and that the present
campaign as concerns the club as an or
ganized body is now closed, and partic
ularly since the club has no local press
to represent and assist and defend
it. therefore we make a final ap
peal to the people of San Jose
to faithfully work and vote for the can
didates indorsed by the New Charter
Club. This club and many of its mem
bers have been told of the false, slan
derous and villainous attacks by the ring
through its local paper and by malicious
rumor. Anticipating that these attacks
will continue, we ask the people to ig
nore all reports which may be made at
the last moment derogatory to the char
acters of the candidates or imputing to
them false, unjust and contemptible mo
tives or charging them with mean and
contempt ible utterances.
"The New Charter Club has indorsed
as its candidates men wel'. known in
public life, old-time residents and
highly respected citizens, against whom j
our opponents, the 'gang,' have not
dared to utter in public one word of
just reproach. If elected they will give I
you a just. fair, clean, honorable and :
efficient administration of public affairs. |
"Hearing in mind the late scandals .
and the many rumors and open charges
of corruption in the present city gov
ernment, we ask you to carefully con
sider the character of the various candi
dates, the manner of their selection and
the kind of people who are urging their
election. Our battle is to place honest, |
capable and fearless officials in charge of j
the public affairs of the city. Our battle
is your battle. Help us to win it!"

that port from China, notified Japan
and the latter country acquiesced in
the arrangement.
The attempts now in progress here to
bring pressure on the Japanese Gov

no popular backing, and the Marquis
Ito has declined to be influenced there

IMPROVEMENT IN
SUNSET VALLEY
Opening Up a Large Section of
San Francisco's Subur-
ban Area.
Much Accomplished for the Progress
of the Town by the
Sea.
Through the pluck of the Sunset v alley
Improvement Club, that portion of San
Francisco known as the Sunset district
has made rapid strides during the past
two years in bringing it into prominence
as a choice residence section of the city.
By constantly keeping its wants before'
the Supervisors and the others whose in
fluence was deemed necessary to advance
the interests of the valley, considerable
headway has been made in making the
place a choice residence district. There
will be in a short time two lines of elec
tric cars running into the center portion
of the settlement. The Market-street
Railway Company is now engaged in fill
ing in the deep hollow on the south side
of the old steamcar i.ouse. over which the
new electric cars will run in the course j
of a month. This line will take the place
of the steam cars that used to run to the
beach.
Since the Affiliated Colleges have been
located on the bluff of the hill east of the
valley a new age has dawned on the pro
gressive spirit of the people out there.
The principal cause which has kept this
section back is now about to be removed,
namely, the wani of proper sewerage.
This drawback is now a thing of the past,
as the much-talked-of sewer will soon be
completed. This has given an impetus to
a general line of progress, and as soon
as the main intercepting sewer is com
pleted to Fourteenth avenue the grading !
of Eighth. Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh !
avenues, and I. J and X streets will be j
undertaken. The executive committee of
the club will ask the Supervisors to de
clare Ninth avenue a boulevard from H
street to the San Miguel ra.ncho.
The Market-street Railway Company
has in contemplation the building of a
trolley line along Parnassus avenue and
J street, which ma;' be extended to the
Balboa boulevard and connect with the
Mission-street electric line.
Should this be done, it will somewhat
change the electric line which runs out
Frederick street, anc bring the proposed
line right In front of the Affiliated Col
leges door.
Next and following the sewer benefit
comes a promise from Engineer Scnussler
of the Spring Valley Water Company that
mains will soon be laid into the district
from the high-level reservoir on Claren
don Heights.
The improvement club, through its ex
ecutive committee, has been busy trying
to head off the locating of a pesthouse on
the Almshouse tract, and to this end it
has sent a petition to Senator Perkins,
asking him to endeavor to secure the per
mission of the Government to have a
portion of Angel Island set apart for the
San Francisco Pesthouse.
SUSPECTED OF BURGLARY.
B. J. McKnight Accused of Bobbing
a Geary-street Residence.
R. J. McKnight, doing business at 112S
Folsom street, was arrested last evening
on complaint of Robert Seldon Christie,
a prophet and life reader, and lodged in
the "tanks" on suspicion of breaking Into
Christie's.
Christie says he met the man about two
weeks ago, and that then McKnight fol
lowed him. He met McKnight again last
evening, and after speaking to him a
moment McKnight departed. When
Christie returned home he found the back
door of his house had been pried open
and various valuables had been stolen.
He had McKnight arrested at once.
San Bruno Boad Car Service.
The residents on the San Bruno road
are not satisfied with the "ghost" car
service given them by the Market-street
combine. The horse-cars which run on
this line make nfteen-m.nute trips from
Potrero avenue and Twenty-sixth street
out the road for about four miles. To
cover this distance it takes one hour
from the time the. car starts until the
end of the journey is reached. This delay
is occasioned by the cars having to wait
at the turn-outs along the line. As It is
now the people living 'along the San
Bruno road never think of coming into
the city after nightfall, as it is more
difficult to get back and forth to their
homes than it would bo to go to San Jose.
An electric line is urged for this road, as
the travel has increased livefold during
the past few years.

Grosvenor Tells of the
Bold Plot to Bolster
Cuban Bonds.
Representative Lentz of Ohio
Charges the President With
Standing in With Wall
Street and Is Rebuked.
Call Offlc^ Rlggs House,
Washington, April 7.
There was a scene of great excite
ment in the House late this afternoon !
during the c >nslderation of the bill for
the reorganization of the army. It was
caused by Lentz, an Ohio Democrat,
Who made a vicious assault on the ad- |
ministration, charging that the policy i
of delay was in the interest of stock j
Jobbers in Wall street. He alleged that j
"Wall street was in the possession of j
information that the message would not |
go in long before it was known at the j
Capitol and profited heavily by the ad- j
vance in the price of stocks which re- j
suited. He even charged that there
was n<"> warrant for the alarming state- ;
ments about the situation in Havana ;
which were given as justifying the de- j
lay <<f the message. Lentz's speech '
created a profound sensation and was '
met with an emphatic reply from Gen- â¢
eral Grosvenor, now regarded as the j
administration spokesman on the floor.
Grosvenor not only indignantly denied !
there was justification for the report, |
but held Lentz up to scorn for alleging [
corrupt motives against the President, i
Lentz disclaimed this, but the irate
friend of the President gave him no <
mercy. He was thoroughly aroused and
laid about him with a veritable blud- .
geon, charging that the Democrats
were seeking political advantage and ;
paying his respects to John J. McCook I
and others. Before he concluded he ex- j
pressed the opinion that war was as
certain as that we would live until
next week, unless it was averted by
Spain. The debate on the army bill
to-day developed more and more op
position. Hull tried to save the bill by ,
agreeing to strike out all its provisions,
even the three battalion formation fea- \
tures, but it was In the end recom- j
mittedâ l^o to 01.
Little evidence of excitement existed
when the House met at noon. The public
galleries were crowded, but yawning gaps
showed in the reserved department.
Hull, chairman of the Military Affairs
Committee, stated before the considera
tion of the army reorganization bill was
resumed, that, at the proper time, he
phnuiii move to strike out everything ex
cept the first two sections, providing for
t)i" three-battalion formation. The sec
ti'ii providing i""r the. expansion of the
rvuular army in time of war to 104,ijuo
would be stricken out.
Sulzer (L>.) of New York, who supported
th<> bill us it was proposed to modify it,
made- a vigorous pro-Cuba speech. If* Cu
ban independence were recognized, he de
flared. Cuba would be soon free. He de
clared that the majority in Congress anil
the President little understood the in
tense feeling among the people of tho
country over the Maine .affair and tho
delay in calling Spain to account.
"Oh for one day of Andrew Jackson in
the White House," he concluded. "lie
would nay, 'Onward the Beet, forward the
whole line, and let the battle cry be
"Cuba must be free.
Lewis (D.) of Washington vigorously
assailed the bill. He not only charged
that it was part of a programme to in
crease the regular .irrny in time of peace,
but he ueelared that the three-battalion
formation had proved a failure and had
been ho rharacterized by the commander
in-chief of the British army.
Lentz (L>.) of Ohio, in the course of his
remarks in opposition to the bill, de
clared that there would be no war; that
the "peace party," which was speculat
ing in stocks and bonds, would prevail
He said there was an irreconcilable dis
parity between the reasons given for the
lelay of the President's message and the
Dispatches from Havana. The "message
ad been postponed because Americans
could not get out of Havana, yet the
press dispatches said all was quiet in
Havana, and that General Lee said he had
pot been recalled. He denounced the tel
egrams other members were receiving
Urging them to stand by the President
*nd said they were dictated by financial'
freed.
Lentz referred to the note presented by
Ihe powers. He read from it the words
fcbout the hope for peace in the settle
ment of the existing differences with
ppam.
"We have no differences with Spain "
he cried. "We have 266 assassinated
Americans which Spain must account
lor." (Applause in the galleries.)
"Yesterday," Lentz said, "we had this
nouse^ Blled, the galleries overflowed and
the Capitol grounds were covered with
people, all expecting the President's mes
sage, which might lead to war. But
nnally. in the afternoon, came word that
I message had been received from Con
ful-Gf-neral Lee in Havana indicating
that ho wanted time, ami the mftsaara
ADVEBTISEMENTS.
People have no idea how
crude and cruel soap can be.
It takes off dirt. So far,
so good; but what else does
it do?
It cuts the skin and frets
the under-skin; makes red-
ness and roughness and
leads to worse. Not soap,
but the alkali in it.
Pears' Soap has no free al-
kali in it. It neither reddens
nor roughens the skin. It re-
sponds to water instantly ; washes
and rinses off in a twinkling; is
as gentle as strong; and the
after-effect is every way good.
All sorts of stores sell it, especially
druggists; all sorts of people use it.
was delayed on that account. Now. I
don't believe anybody had authority for
the statement from the administration or
any other official that justified the rumor
that prevailed here yesterday. The tele-
Kram by the Associated Press yesterday
stated that all was quiet in Havana, and
General Lee told a correspondent that he
had not been requested to leave. Other
newspapers have similar dispatches. If
these statements are true there was
nothing to justify the statement sent to
the Capitol yesterday. I say there will
be no war."
Continuing:, he charged that Congress
was being overwhelmed by telegrams.
"initiated by commercial greed," all of
which he declared emanated principally
from Wail street.
"It is the old question of the almighty
dollar," paid he. "It is me fall of stocks
the gentlemen who control the adminis
tration fear more than war. They care
nothing for the 2So assassinated sailors
who went down in Havana ..arbor; but
they care everything for it 9 cents plus one
cent. I say. my friends, that we owe an
apology to Judas Iscariot. I say he ought
to bo brought back and deified. If Judas
lived In this age he would not have gone
to the potter's field and hanged himself.
He would have, been sent to the United
States Senate in duo time, such a spec
ulator as he was." [Laughter and ap
plause on the Democratic side.]
Lenta proceeded to read from a New
York paper statements to the effect that
delay in sending the message helped stock
jobbers, and that they had had advance
information. He read from the various
stock reports to snow that stocks went
up all along the line when the news was
received that the message would not go
to Congress yesterday. He referred to
the note of the powers to the Government
and its response.
Lentz's remarks brought Grosvenor of
Ohio, generally regarued as the admin
istration's spokesman, to his feet with an
Indignant reply, in the course of which he
made some startling statements, which
caused a great sensation in the House.
"The gentleman from Ohio (Lentz)/'
said he. "hag predicated a long speech
here upon a statement of facts made by
himself. He declares that no message
came from General Lee yesterday; that
it was a fake report; that it was false,
given out for a corrupt purpose by the
President to affect the stock market. Ev
ery particle of this statement is, without
qualification, absolutely false. (Applause
on the Republican side.) I call upon the
distinguished gentleman from Kentucky
(Berry), a member of the Foreign Af
fairs Committee, to say whether I tell the
truth or not when I say that such a dis
patch was received from General Lee and
was read by him. There is the answer.
That is the character of the sort of as
saults that are being made on American
honor and the integrity of the President.
Not only did the dispatch come yes
terday, but it came the day before, and
appealed to the President of the United
States. I read 'the telegram, and there
are twenty men on this floor now who
read the telegram, both Democrats and
Republicans. It was read to the distin
guished members of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee of the Senate, and each
and every one of them, without qualifi
cation, coincided with the policy of the
President not to send the message in here
at that time. I say again that only a
most earnest and urgent protest came
, from General Lee. Is General Lee at one
lof the tickers? (Laughter on the Repub
i lican side.) Some men can ascribe cor
! nipt motives to other men; how they ever
became educated to the idea that all men
are corrupt, I leave to your imagination."
Lentzâ lf you knew this day before yes
terday, why did you let the House and
galleries fill up with people and sit here
and say nothing about it while Wall
street was speculating on it?
Grovesnorâ Wall street was not spec
ulating on it. That story was as false
as the other. I say that the President
Intended to disregard Lee's message of
Tuesday and had his message signed and
sealed, and ready to be transmitted to
both Houses, and yesterday morning,
when the final protest in the name of
humanity came, as I have said, it was
read before the committees of the two
Houses and without a dissenting voice
they advised the President against send
ing It here. Now let me answer another
proposition. He has made a garbled
statement here. He made a statement
that the representatives of the great
powers In this city have to-day called on
the President and asked him to delay. I
stated that that was false. I believe the
statement here in my hand, and there is
not one word said about the delay. What
the gentleman did not read is the re
sponse In which he put an end, without
qualification, to all suggestions of delay
or Interference in any way whatever.
Now, the gentleman is arraigning the
President of the United States: he Is
sending a message to the enemy, show
ing them that here in the midst of
this House is a man who will charge the
President of the United States with a
corrupt purpose, with a corrupt inten
tion, with attempting to stop the progress
of the great march of patriotism. There
is no word of delay in all the language
which has been used in this connection."
After a prolonged wrangle over the
question of an extension of time, Grosve
nor proceeded:
"I call the attention of the gentleman
and of the House," he continued, "to
the statement he made that this was an
other stock-jobbing performance, and
that there was another purpose of delay
in this declaration from the embassadors
of the great powers, so that Wall street
would run upward. I hold in my hand
the statement that Immediately upon the
publication of the statement in the city
of New York the market became very
weak and ran clear down upon every one
of the leading articles in the market. See
now easy It is to make a charge. Now
let me tell the gentleman something about
bonds. It is very easy to charge a Sen
ator. That Senator (meaning Hanna)
has made a statement, which I challenge
any man to deny, that never in his life.
i']? 1 only not this J ear but never in his
lire, did he buy a dollar of stock in Wall
street or anywhere else."
McMlllin-Can ho say the same thing
about votes? (Laughter and applause on
the Democratic side.)
Lentzâ l mentioned no Senator from any
Mate on the floor of this House. His
name was mentioned in one of the articles
Grosvenorâ Everybody knewâ the
gentleman say he did nOt intend to point
out Mark Hanna?
Lentzâ could everybody know?
Grosvenorâ Did you Intend It to mean
Mark Hanna? Be brave now. Answer
that. Did you mean Mark Hanna? â  .
Mark 57 Wha , t ' :1 T, akes >' ou th lnk I mean
Mark Hanna? (Laughter.)
Grosvenorâ You mentioned Mark Hanna
and the record will "show It. "anna
Len t J! - 1 wll i charge you with the re
sponsibility of accusing Mr. Hanna I
have not. [ I described a certain indivld-
Grosvenor-Oh, but the gentleman did
use the name. I have been baiting him to
say that.
Lentzâ l deny It. \

situation stands. This gentleman Is

the name of John J. McCook in one of his
raids this afternoon. Who is John J. Mc-
Cook? Whom does he represent? What
is he here for? How do he and the gen
tleman from Ohio stand with reference
to this? I will show you that they are
parties In a great conspiracy, one wit
tingly so, the other, I trust, ignorantly
so. Who is John J. McCook? He is the
legal representative of the Cuban Junta
of New York, behind which stands $400.
000,000, more or less, of bonds that can
be validated by the recognition of the mi
i dependence of Cuba by the United States
: and they will be destroyed by a policy
I that drives Spain out of Cuba in the in
terest of American people. (Applause.)
Lentzâ Was it not announced that this
same J. J. McCook was to be a member
of the President's Cabinet?
Grosvenorâ l have heard the gentleman
and myself were each and both of us to
be Governor of the State of Ohio, but we
I never got there. [Laughter.] I will tell
you who John J. McCook is. He repre
j sents an interest running up into the
I hundreds of millions of dollars, and if he
could pet the United States to make a
recognition of the independence of Cuba
and then fight to establish it by the
United States, at a cost of a thousand
million dollars, the holders of these bogus
bonds will realize $400,000,000 and collect
the money. That is where the bonds come
in. Let us take the other side. I was
told some time agoâ just before the time
that this trouble broke outâ l was told
that a party in the city of New York sold
short on the market to an extent that If
j the condition things were in prior to the
I breaking out of this Cuban trouble had
prevailed it would have absolutely ruined
him, although his estate Is a very wealthy
one. I have been told that from that day
to this any proposition to provoke Spain
to war, any motion that would cause war
in this country between Spain and the
United States has been promoted by that
gentleman, because the moment war is
declared the snort side of the market
will put a million dollars into his pocket.
Now, would the gentleman tell usâ. [Sev
eral gentlemen on the Democratic side:
"Who is it?]
Grosvenorâ Tell us how anybody can be
benefited by preventing war? How? I
mean any stockbroker, anybody who
holds any stocks? How can that happen
1 when prices are going up or down as each
' battle progresses and as each ship has to
| si 'render? Then is the time that stocks
rise and fall. And were I stock Rambling,
j which I thank God I am not, there would
j be no occasion more gratifying to my
I greed than war with the United States
and another country. Why is it that ev
j cry manufacturer of the United States
wants an end put to this war? Because
they want things to get back again to
i where they were before this agitation be
pan. Why is it that the Treasury of the
United States wants to put an end to this
; uncertainty? Because the revenues of the
I Government are being destroyed by this
excitement and uncertainty. Therefore it
is 'hat the President, backed up by his
Cabinet, and backed by the best judgment
of the House, and backed by the best judg
ment of the Senate, is proceeding as rap
id. as? possible to put an end to this war.
and yet the gentleman says that the
President has faltered. A charge no more
serious than he has preferred has brought
the head cf many a man to the block, a
charge men infamous than that could
not be borne by any man in this country,
to make it appear that the President has
used the power that Congress has given
Kin. tc operate the stock markets of hi-;
country. Prove that and you would have
a vacancy in the Presidency just as quick
as you can establish it. The charges
nave no truth.
Lentzâ l have ready said to you tha:
I deny that 1 said anything of the kind.
1 i.ever said that a telegram had not been |
sent.
Grosvenorâ administration set the
story afloat in the Interest of stock spec- !
ulation. Those are your exact words, as
the reporter's notes will show. You made
a charge that ought to condemn the
President of the United States to im
peachment and imprisonment. I, for one, j
nave felt that it was a terrible assault
upon the honor and integrity of Spain
what we did on yesterday, but it must
be remembered that there was put up :
on the one hand the choice of insult to I
Spain, solemnly delivered by the Presi- |
dent, an intimation to the whole world
that there was danger of murder to
American representatives in Cuba, or ;
there was put on the other side the dan
ger itself. We can have mere tragedy I
along this line until war comes to put i
the whole thing into the hands of trag
edy. Now. then, I will say that over
against the statement of the in- j
sult to Spain that was deliberately hurled
at her by the American people that the j
administration was compelled to put the
chances ff murder, not that the Govern- !
ment of Spain would do it, but the Gov- !
ernment was so powerless to maintain or- I
der that the ships of a friendly nation i
are unsafe in her ports and might be
overwhelmed by mobs and murder have |
taken place. Suppose the message would !
have gone to Congress yesterday, and ;
suppose that last night the blood of that
distinguished and chivalrous gentleman i
from Virginia had soaked the soil of i
Cuba? What would have been the ver- !
diet of the American people against the '
administration? If a man in the House :
so far forgetful of his dignity as an '
American citizen of the humblest charac- !
ter, intimates that the President has j
been juggling a thing like that, I will |
not answer for it.
Mr. Speaker, I did not suppose that in
this American Congress it was necessary
that I should make an explanation in or
der to* defend the President of the United
States from an insinuation like that. I am
glad the purpose of the opposition is now
fully and clearly disclosed. I am de
lighted that because of a little change in !
the programme, wholly unimportant
except as it strengthens the daily aug
menting powers of the United Statesâ a
change made under stress of circum
stances that would have controlled any
civilized nationâ l am delighted that the
gentleman from Ohio has given us notice
that every occurrence now and hereafter
is to be taken advantage of for party
purposes, and I am delighted that the
gentleman from Texas (Bailey) has two
or three times now, on each succeeding
day, pointed out with great delight that
there are differences of opinion on the
Republican side of the House. I suggest
to the gentleman that when he opens a
recruiting office to get volunteers to pass
under his banner to light the administra
tion, he had better make a contract for
the rent of his quarters from day to day,
as he will probably not need them very
long in the future. ,â¢ -_ i
Here comes a matter which the whole
world will say governed the administra
tion as it it ought to have been governed, !
and the world will be notified to-nlgnt
that the President has been assailed by
a distinguished representative on this
floor, his motives Impugned and his integ
rity censured, the whole action charged
as being instigated by criminal purposes, j

STOCKTON PEOPLE
HISS McKINLEY.
STOCKTON, April 7.â An In
cident which occurred here last
evening was the hissing of the
picture of President MeKinley,
displayed during a theatrical
performance. On the stage pic
tures of the Preside t and of
several leaders were being dis
played on the background of the
national colors. All cheered to
the echo till the picture of
MeKinley was shown, when the
gallery started to hiss, and it
was taken up downstairs. The
affair so angered a number pres
ent that they immediately left
the theater.
When it became known around
town denounced it as an
outrage, while others expressed
the opinion that ; was the peo
ple's privilege to criticise. Some
who have entirely disagreed
with President MeKinley in hi 3
attitude in the present difficulty
were outspoken in their anger
that an audience should be in
cited to manifest such disre
spect. Considerable :il feeling
was awakened by the incident.
and this is a body that boasts that it is
going to stand b" the administration.
".Now. gentlemen, let me tell you an
other thing. This war will be fought
under the banner of the Republican ad
ministration of this Government, or it
will never be fought at all. We may
differ about how it ought to be inaugu
rated, and honestly. Some of you may
have an opinion different from mine,
and I honor you for that. But when the
time comes the commander-in-chief of
the army uf the United States will com
mand the column that will crush the
power of Spain: or it never will be
crushed. Again, you will discover as you
go along that the enemy on the other
sideâ the oppositionâ are putting forward
matters of legal interestâ taking a posi
tion to-day that it did not take two years
ago. It is not yet two years since it was
proclaimed by the great Democratic law
yers of the Congress of the United
Mates that there was no power in the
.Congress of the United States to rec
ognize the independence of a foreign
country: labored arguments tilled the
<. ongressional Record to show that such
recognition was not within the yower of
Congress, but lay exclusively under the
constitution in the hands of the Presi
dent But. however that may be, when
wa f, '? declared the President of the
united states becomes at once vested by
the constitution with the power to con
clude treaties with foreign countries, and
ne is at all times the commander-in-chief
of the armies of the United States.
a i ave no more doubt." Grosvenor con
cluded, that we are going to have war
than I have that we will live till next
week. I may be mistaken. I pray to God
\*J . y '"' mistaken. But 1 believe,
Mr. Speaker, that we will go to war on a
declaration substantially of Congress. My
influence will be given for peace for what
ever it is worth. My influence will be.
given to avert war. but the time is up. in
my humble judgment, when we can avert
it, and if peace shall prevail it must come
trom the action of another country rath
er than our own. Our position is taken
and we cannot recede. But let the pol
icy of this Government be such that when
the tocsin of war shall have sounded all
of the civilized world will say 'America
is right. " (Great applause.)
After Grosvenor concluded his remarks
Bailey took the floor for a brief speech
in which he quoted several utterances of
Grosvenor to show that the Buckeye
statesman had shifted his position. He
first quoted from one of Grosvenor's
speeches of a week ago, in which he de
clared that the administration would
when the time came for action be for in
dependence and firmed intervention- two
days later he paid in an Interview, inde
pendence without armed intervention, and
now he said armed intervention without
independence.
Grosvenor caused some merriment on
the Democratic side when he said the
statements quoted were substantially in
the same direction.
Then, turning his attention to some of
Grosyenors remarks. Hniley indignantly
repelled the idea that if war came it was
to be a Republican war.
"It would be a war of the people of the
United States against Spanish tyranny in
Cuba," said he amid great applause.
After some further debate on the bill
Hull's motion to strike out all but the
first two sections was carried. The bill
was then carriedâ lSO to en.
The House then, at 5:50, adjourned till
Monday.
SHOT AND KILLED
THE TOWN TOUGH.
Joe Bacher of Santa Monica Defends
Himself by Shooting Daniel
B. Gray.
SANTA MONICA, April 7.â Daniel B.
Gray, a well known man about town and
considered a tough man to deal with when
drinking, got on a spree last evening,
tried to run the town and attacked a
number of people. He entered the racific
saloon, got into an altercation with Joe
Bacher, the proprietor, and attacked him
with a heavy cane, swearing to kill him.
He cornered Bacher, who drew a pistol

EUROPE'S
FORMAL
PROTEST
Representatives of the
Six Powers Call on
the President.
Nobody Believes the Step Will
Have Any Effect on the
Crisis One Way or
the Other.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â The repre
sentatives of the six great powers of
Europeâ Great Britain, France, Ger
many, Russia, Austria and Italyâ gave
official form at noon to-day to their
recent conference in the Interest of a
peaceful settlement of the Cuban situ
ation. Their procedure was unique in
! the United States, though doubtless a
1 familiar one in European courts. They
; called in a body at the White House,
! presented an address to President Mc-
Kinley in the blue parlor, received the
i reply and then proceeded to the State
Department, where with solemn punc
tiliousness they were received by As
sistant Secretary Day in the diplomatic
room. They were accompanied by their
secretaries. The ceremony was impres
sive.
The Embassadors and Ministers had
agreed upon a line of action at a meet
ing at the British Embassy Tuesday
' afternoon. Early there was evidence
| of great activity at the foreign estab-
I lishments, and while the customary se
j crecy was observed, yet no further ef
fort was made to question or deny the
I fact that the Embassadors had agreed
ion a concrete form of action. The ad
j ditional fact was made known for the
1 first time that Sir Julian Pauncefote
had communicated with the State De
! partment authorities last evening on
i this subject, and while the full form of
| the movement might not then have
i been made known, the United States
authorities were made aware of what
; was being done and of the further fact
j that an official presentation of the sub
i ject would be made at noon to-day.
This Government was undoubtedly
' made acquainted with the address to
be delivered and then, in the light of
it, prepared its reply. The fact de
veloped this morning that Russia had
joined the other five powers, Mr. de
Wollant, Charge a' Affaires, pending the
arrival of the new Russian Embassa
dor, Count Cassini, acting for the Czar.
The diplomatic officials met at the
British embassy shortly before noon
and then proceeded with their secre
taries to the White House and State
Department. The party was made up
of the following: The British Embas
sador, Sir Julian Pauncefote, dean of
the diplomatic corps; the French Em
bassador, M. Cambon, and M. Thie
bant, first secretary of embassy; the
German Embassador, Dr. yon Holle
ben, with Baron Spreck yon Steinburg,
first secretary of embassy; the Aus
trian Minister, Mr. Hegenmuller; the
Italian Charge d'Affaires, Count Vinci,
and the Russian Charge d'Affaires, Mr.
de Wollant.
Arriving at the White House they
were ushered into the blue room and
I there were received by President Mc
i Kinley. After a social exchange and
j mutual well-wishes the Embassadors,
Ministers and Charges, speaking
through Sir Julian Pauncefote, deliv
ered to tl.e President the following ad
dress:
Mr. President: We have been com
manded by the great powers of Europe
whom we represent here to-day to ap
proach your Excellency with a message
of friendship and peace at the present
critical juncture in the relations between
the United States and Spain and to con
vey to you the sentiments expressed in
the collective note, which I have the honor
to place in your hands.
The note of the powers is as follows:
The undersigned, representatives of
Germany, Austria - Hungary. France,
Great Britain, Italy and Russia, duly
authorized in that behalf, address In the
name of their respective Governments
a pressing appeal to the feelings of hu
manity and moderation of the President
and of the American people in their exist
ing differences with Spain. They ear
nestly hope that further negotiations will
lead to an agreement which, while secur
ing the maintenance of peace, will afford
all necessary guarantees for the re-estab
lishment of order in Cuba.
The powers do not doubt that the hu
manitarian and purely disinterested char
acter of this representation will be fully
recognized and appreciated by the Amer
ican nation.
President McKinley replied as fol
lows:
The Government of the United States
recognizes the good will which has
prompted the friendly communication of
the representatives of Germany, Austria-
Hungary, France, Great Britain. Italy
and Russia, as set forth in the address
of your excellencies, and shares the hope
therein expressed that the outcome of the
situation in Cuba may be the mainten
ance of peace between the United States
and Spain, affording the necessary guar
antees for the re-establishment of order
in the island, so terminating the chronic
condition of disturbance there which so
deeply injures the Interests and menaces
the tranquillity of the American nation
by the character and consequences of the
struggle thus kept up at our doors, besides
shocking its sentiments of humanity.
The Government of the United States
appreciates the humanitarian and disin
terested character of the communication
now made on behalf of tli powers named
and for its part is confident that equal
appreciation will be shown for its own
earnest and unselfish endeavors to ful till
a duty to humanity by ending a. situation
the Indefinite prolongation of which has
become insufferable.
The party then withdrew to the State
Department and repaired in a body xo
the diplomatic room, where they held
a conference with Judge Day, Assist
ant Secretary of State. Secretary Sher
man having gone home to lunch before
their arrival.
This conference took a wider range
and went considerably outside of the
address delivered to the President.
While the diplomats were at first re
ceived together, they soon separated
into groups, with the apparent purpose
of presenting the views of their several
Governments. The British Embassa
dor, the Austrian Minister and the Ital
ian Charge were the first to retire
corning away together. The Russian
Charge was the next to leave. The
German Embassador and his secretary
then had a private conference with
Judge Day. At its conclusion the
French Embassador and his secretary
t? turn Jl ad a conference with Judge
if y \ ,. Tnese conferences lasted for
about half an hour, the several dioio
matists leaving separately.
Shortly afterward Judge Day left the
State Department, declining to say
more than to refer inquirers to the Em
bassadors and the reply of the Presi
dent.
The action of the powers in present
ing the joint note to President McKin
ley was to have occurred yesterday,
but was deferred by delay at St. Peters
burg. It was not until 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon that the Russian Gov
ernment cabled its Charge instructions
similar to those already given to the
other representatives. At 7 o'clock last
night a meeting was held and the joint
note formally signed, it having been
prepared at the meeting at the British
embassy the night before. The note is
in French and bears the signature of
the representatives of the six powers.
The original note in French was pre
sented, and Sir Julian Pauncefote
stated to the President that it was
given to him in this language with the
signatures, as French is the diplomatic
language of the world. An English
translation not bearing the signatures
accompanied the original note, and it
was this English translation which Sir
Julian Pauncefote read. The Presi
dent's answer was not reduced to
French.
An inquiry at the several embassies
and legations show that the reply of
President McKinley has created a most
favorable impression among the Em
bassadors and Ministers. It was cabled
immediately to London, Paris and all
the other European capitals. The
declaration of the President that, In thf
interest of humanity, this warfare must
stop, and his indirect appeal to them
to exert their influence in the name of
humanity found a sympathetic reflec
tion in the sf-ntiments of all the Em
bassadors and other representatives.
THEY MUST RECRUIT
THE DIVISIONS.

- The most disastrous stampede of the j
season took place on Sunday night last.
A Swede, who could not talk English,
came into town and showed a sackful
of gold. It was known to some that he
had been prospecting on what was
known as Twelve Mile Creek. The
word go.t about quickly and a stampede I
started, although it was then late at
night. Men were aroused by their
friends from bed and started illy clad
for such a journey, and women who got
the tip left the dance halls to join in
the rush. Twelve Mile Creek is about
eight miles up the river, the trail cross-
Ing the river at Dawson. The stam
peders made the distance on a run.
â  Coming back they were very tired,
could not travel fast enough to keep
warm and very many were badly
frozen.
W. J. Landers is in the hospital with
ff-et badly frozen, and H. P. Anderson
of coma is laid up at the Klondike
Hotel, and beside him lies B. E. Sprague
of Seattle, also with badly frosted feet,
which he got by staying with Ander
son. Anderson undoubtedly owes his
life to Sprague, as he was chilled al
most into insensibility on the trail.
Sprague was compelled to beat and
urge him in every way to keep him
from lying down in the snow. When
Fprague was almost exhausted a couple
of men came along with a sled. They
had heard Sprague's cries and thought
there was a fight going on. They put
Anderson on the sled and hurried to
Dawson with all speed, Anderson
every now and again falling off the
Bled, at which times the men would
pound him and make him exert him
â  self to get up and climb on again. They
carried- him into the Klondike Hotel
when they arrived in town, and several
men worked for some hours reviving
the circulation. It is thought that he
will come out of it all right.
Sprague will be laid up for some time.
Landers . also was saved by the faith
fulness of his companion, who urged
him along the trail as Sprague had done
: to Anderson, but he was not relieved,
;as. he had been. It was quite dark, and
he lost the trail where it turned to
cross the iiver to Dawson. He floun
dered about in the snow for some time,
end then, in bewildered desperation,
set" up a cry for help. It was heard on
this side of the river by a friend, -who
â \ recognized his voice and ran out on the
ice answering. He found the two men, J
nn.fl. taking Landers on his back, car- j
ried: him into and laid him on the floor
, of -the Klondike Hotel Just as Ander
. .s%S, having been treated by Dr. Le
â .'."bT&.tjc, rose from it.
â ; .;;-<3n.e of the women gave out and had

Two Minnesota Men Lose Their
Lives While Journeying to the
Copper River Country.
SEATTLE, April 7.â The steamer Noyo. which reached port this af
ternoon from Copper River, brings news of terrible storms in the North
Pacific. She also reports two deaths, which occurred March 23 be
tween the third bench and the summit of Valdes Glazier. Graves carved
out of solid ice mark the last restin^place of the two men who were the
first to die as a result of the terrible trip across the glacier. L. R. Mur
fine of Sleepy Eye, Minn., met his death through the accidental dis
charge of a revolver. The weapon fell from his partner's belt and struck
their sled in such a way that it was discharged. The bullet inflicted a
wound from which Murfine almost immediately died. The other victim
was T. H. Opdal of Marshall, Minn. He had been exerting himself with
his partners in drawing their outfits across the glacier. He became
overheated on March 21 and allowed himself to cool off too suddenly. He
became seriously ill and two days later died. The money and personal
effects of the two men were taken in charge by Purser Baker of the
Noyo, who will forward them to th<^ widows.
John Hollo and Arthur Frees came back to Valdes with the effects
of the deceased. They reported that two parties had crossed Tasnuna

STEVE WADE MUST
PAY THE FINE
Arrest of the Man Who Fled
After Conviction in San
Jose.
Bondsmen Cause the Fugitive's Ar- I
rest and He Will Now Face
the Penalty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 7.â Steve Wade, who
was convicted of the seduction of Zelpha
Scott and who skipped while out on JSOOO
bail pending an appeal to the Supreme
Court, was arrested at San Diego to-da.y.
The arrest was made on a bench war
rant, issued in Judge Lorigan's court.
Nearly two ye.ars ago Wade was sen
tenced to pay a fine of $3000 or serve 750
days in the State's prison. An appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court and, pend
ing its decision, Wade was released on
$SOno bail, with his mother and John
Maloney as sureties. Six months ago the
Supreme Court affirmed the sentence, but
when the authorities began to look
around for Wade it was found he wnÂ«
gone. Later it was discovered that the
bond furnished to secure Wade's release
had been stolen. A duplicate copy of the
bond was substituted, and a suit began
against the bondsmen to collect the
amount. A delay of thirty days was
asked by the bondsmen in which to pro
duce Wade, and this time was up April 1.
Wade did not appear then, and another
continuance to April 15 was granted. At
torney J. H. Moore stated then that
Wade" was in San Diego, and would surely
be present at that time. This did pot
satisfy the court and the bench warrant
was issued, and the arrest was made to
day by Sheriff Jennings of that place.
Wade, who had been going under the
name of C. L. Martin, had just re
turned from a tour of Mexico, Deputy
Sheriff Tennant started after Wade this
afternoon. It is said Wade's fine will
now be paid.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 1898.
MME. LOUISE
LOCKED UP
Once Famous Singer in
Jail for Throwing
Acid.
Deserted Vocalism to Follow
a Hobby of Teaching
Dressmaking.
During a Quarrel With the Landlord
Over Rent She Hurled Muri
atic Acid.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 7.â ln the County
Jail awaiting trial on a serious offense
is a woman whose singing has thrilled
audiences in England, Europe and the j
United States. This personage is none
other than Mme. Louise, who is charg-
I ed with throwing muriatic acid in the
I face of E. F. Robinson, her landlord.
The woman's right name is Mme. Em
ily E. Lassangue, and a few months
ago she conducted a music studio at
Kohler & Chase Hall, 28 O'Farrell
street, San Francisco. To back her
statement of her ability as a singer she
produces press notices from the Lon
don Times, New York Herald and Paris
Figaro. These speak in the hie-hest
j praise of her voice and talent, and in
| dicate that Aline. Lassangue created
quite at furor while abroad.
Mme. Lassangue came to San Jose
about three months ago and opened
dressmaking parlors in the Ryland
block, under the name of Mme. Louise.
When she secured the rooms she paid i
$5 down, but had paid no more rent up j
to the time of her arre3t. In fact, all
her trouble arose over her refusal to
pay rent. After she had opened her
dressmaking school E. F. Robinson,
who is foreman of the Morrow ranch,
near Mount Hamilton, purchased the
lease of the rooms occupied by the
madam. He demanded his rent at the
end of the month, but Mme. Louise put
i him off. This she did the next month,
and then it became monotonous to the
landlord. He asked the woman to move,
but she refused. Then he offered her
a receipt for the two months' rent and
$30 in cash. It was while these terms
were being considered that Landlord
Robinson put in an appearance at the
roonis. A few words transpired be
tween them and then Mme. Lassangue
threw a glass of muriatic acid in Rob
inson's face. The latter threw up his
arms, and this act probably saved his
eyesight. As it was his hands and
wrists were badly burned and his fore
head received a few drops of the acid.
Mme. Lassangue was at once arrest
ed and held to answer for trial before
the Superior Court. Bail was fixed at
$3000, which the woman has been un
able to furnish.
Mme. Louise str.tes that dressmaking
has a fascination for her, and it was
this that led her to desert her vocal
calling. She says she is a natural-born
dressmaker, and that she thought a
change and rest woul I benefit her
health.
SWALLOWED ACID
WHILE DESPONDENT
Mrs. Tessie Levy Commits
Suicide to Cure Her
Troubles.
Separation From Her Children Was
the Cause of Her Kuan
V*tJJ~' : â  Act.
Mrs. Tessie Levy of 2218 Geary street,
while in a despondent mood yesterday
went to the home of her sister, Mrs. Jo
seph Dennis, at 257 ..iiiuki street, and
committed suicide by swallowing car
bolic acid.
She was divorced from her husband
about six montus ago, and her children,
a boy of five and a girl of three," were
taken from her and placed in a home at
Sixth and Minna streets, where she was
allowed to visit them twice a month.
Since the separation phe has been brood
ing over the absence of her babes.
She visited her ex-husband's home yes
terday and loudly demanded her boy's
picture. It was given to her. In her an
ger she used strong language, and was
only prevailed upon to leave when her
arrest was threatened. Mrs. Levy then
went to the Eagle pharmacy, 140 Third
street, and bought a bottle of carbolic
acid.
She then loft and walked up Third
street exhibiting the poison, and Charles
W. Wilson took it from her, but fooiishlv
returned it when she comulained. She
the- went to her sifter's house airl there
swallowed the deadly draught. Then she
ran screaming to the front door.
The woman was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, but she had swalloweci too
much of the liquid and died a few min
utes after her arrival there.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, April 2 (by steam
ship Victorian to Seattle, April 7).â
Jack O'Gara and Robert Insley, two old
and well-known residents of Juneau,
arrived here to-day on the Victorian,
eighteen days from Dawson. This time
beats the record.
They announce the most sensational
news that has come out of Dawson this
winter in regard to gold discoveries.
Skookum Creek is proving another bo
nanza, they say. Nothing like it was
ever known in the Yukon country be
fore. Mr. O'Gara says that bench
claims on Skookum and Little Skookum
creeks are proving as rich as the pay
streak in the bottom of the best creeks.
He says that nuggets of pure gold
ranging in value from $100 to $554 have
been dug out of the side hills of the two
Skookums, and the like of it was never
seen before. It runs in size from coarse
gold and flax-seed nuggets to chunks
of the yellow metal nearly as large as
a man's hand. All these creeks flow
down from a big m'o-untain called The
Dome of the County. It seems that the
gold has broken off or melted and run
down from this mountain in some cen
tury long gone by. These sidehill claims
were reported last fall, but they were
not supposed to be bo rich as they have
since proved to be.
Frank Berry, a brother of Clarence
Berry, has bought two claims on Lit
tle skookum. One of the biggest stam
pedes of the winter occurred from
Dawson upon the report of the richness
of these sidehill claims and much side
hill staking has since been done on all
the tributary creeks of the Klondike.
Another party, which left Dawson
March 4, reached Dyea March 29. This
is composed of G. E. Campbell of Seat
tle, who carried out dispatches from
The Call's Dawson correspondent; J.
G. Courtney of Seattle, and a Mr. Fry
of Portland. Or. They corroborate the
report of rich sidehill finds on the two
Skookum creeks.
Mr. Campbell said: "Some very
large nuggets wfcre found one of them
weighing $524 and some cents. Every
thing around there is staked clear to
the top of the mountain. This sidehill
ground has proved a big surprise.
Nothing like it was ever discovered in
the country before. It created a big
stampede, and they are still staking
out claims around there on the moun
tain sides." HAL HOFFMAN.

AT THE ROSE CARNIVAL
Miss Edna Rodden of San Rafael Is Chosen as
Queen for the Festivities in Marin's
Metropolis.
SAN RAFAEL, April 7.â The ladles' committee of the San Rafael Rose
Carnival has selected Miss Edna Rodden as the oueen to rule O?Â« festival.
Miss Rodden is the charming daughter of Judge George Rodden and odÂ» ot
the prettiest and most popular young ladies in San Rafael. The selection
of Miss Rodden is an honor of no small degree and -he has been chosen out
of a score of beautiful girls.
Miss Rodden is 21 years of age and is a sister of Dr. George Rodden
and a sister-in-jaw of Lou Carrlgan of San Francisco. She has lived in
San Rafael IJI her life and is in every sense a Marin County girl.
The committees in charge of the Rose Festival are actively at work
and the financial committee reports success. The North Pacific Coast road
and the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad have donated $260 each
toward the festival and many large private subscriptions have been received.
The plans for the arches and spans that will ornament the main street
have been completed and all the committees which have been appointed
are hard at work. The ladies are energetic and are determined that the
great fete shall be a success. Contracts have already been let by the
owners of many of the buildings on the main street for elaborate decora
tions. The carnival colors, orange, green and white, are seen on every side
and as the time for the festival draws near the interest increases. Friday
and Saturday, May 6 and 7, are the days selected.
TOO READY TO
USE HIS GUN
Deputy Constable Adams
of Mendota Wounds
J. L.. Eaden.
Fired Because His Victim Was
Stealing a Ride and Tried
to Get Away.
The Victim of the Reckless Officer
Was Beating His Way Back.
to Fresno.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April 7.â Deputy Constable
Adams of Mendota shot and most likely
mortally wounded Joseph L. Eaden
early this morning because the latter
ran when the officer attempted to place
him under arrest for stealing a ride on
a train. A 34-caliber ball entered the
back and came out over the heart.
Eaden was taken to the County Hos
pital, and was still alive at 9 o'clock
to-night, but bleeding internally and
not expected to live till morning.
Eaden was not a tramp, but well
known in this city, where he worked.
He was returning from Randsburg,
where he lost all the money he had.
Public sentiment is against the officer
| here, who is regarded as having acted
I too hastily with his pistol. He has not
been arrested, but if Eaden dies he will
be placed under arrest.
Eaden had been put off the train sev
eral times by the conductor, but slip
! ped on again. The conductor wired to
Mendota to have an officer present
when the train arrived. Deputy Con
stable Adams accordingly met the
train and called upon Eaden to surren
der. Instead of complying Eaden ran
away. Adams drew his revolver and
fired three times to frighten the fleeing
man.
The fourth shot took effect, although
the officer protests he did not aim to
hit the fugitive, but to shoot close to
scare him. It was with great difficulty
that Eaden told his story, every breath
being torture to him and speaking al
most impossible. Some time ago he
went to Randsburg. He worked for a
time there, but was defrauded out of
his wages, amounting to about $160.
Then he went to San Francisco. Soon
he found himself without money and
determined to come back to Fresno,
where he thought that friends could
get him work. He had n,ever beaten his
way before, but had to do it to get here.
He had never been under arrest and
did not want to be arrested.
Eaden is thirty-two years of age and
a native of Kentucky. He comes of
good family and has several brothers
living at that place. The conductor of
the train upon which he was riding has
sworn out a warrant charging Eaden
with vagrancy.
About a year ago Adams shot an In
dian, and the victim was confined in a
hospital five months. The officer saw
him committing a crime, and when he
would not surrender shot him. This
afternoon Assistant District Attorney
Jones and Court Reporter Gearheart
took a statement from Eaden at the
county hospital which will be used in
the prosecution of Adams should the
wounds prove fatal.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April 7.â Owing to the
drought and lack of snow in the moun
tains there has been a great deal of
trouble in this county between the irri
gation companies and farmers, whose
grain is rotting in the ground because
they are unable to get water on it, al
though they belong to irrigation dis
tricts and pay regular assessments for
water which this year they have been
unable to secure. As a rule there is no
complaint of this character, but this
is an exceptional year, and it is be
lieved before the season is over serious
trouble will result, and possibly blood
shed.
Several indignation meetings have
been held, but the angry farmers this
morning resorted to more drastic meas
ures. Over 160 indignant farmers
armed with shotguns went to a point
where the two divisions of Kings River
part, about seven miles above Center
yille, and began the work of putting in
two dams so that none of the water will
run into the lower division. That will
divert the water into the east division,
and the companies most affected by
that are the Fresno Irrigation Com
pany and the Lower Kings River Com-
pany.
The water will be diverted into the

ditch of the Alta Irrigation Company,
known as Ditch No. 76, which supplies
water to Reedley and a large portion of
Tulare County. The people have had
no water this year. They have at last
put threats into execution and are tak
ing the water by force.
They have a large nu-iber of horses
and scoop shovels and are fast accomÂ«
plishing their purpose. Unless some
thing is done there will be no water In
the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Com
pany's ditch within twenty-four hours.
Officers of the Fresno Canal and Irri
gation Company state that steps will
be taken immediately to prevent fur
ther lawlessness.
The Fresno Canal and Irrigation
Company and the Kings River Com
pany are not the only sufferers by di
verting the water from the lower divis
ion of Kings River, which supplies their
ditches, but farmers w T ho are depend
ent upon those companies for water
will naturally suffer, end hence will
most likely attempt to undo the work
of farmers whose lands are tributary
to the other division of the river.
If the Reedley "â mers succeed in
completing the building of dams be
fore being interfered with they will in
voke the courts to restrain any one
from removing the dams, and will thus
gain sufficient time to thoroughly irri
gate their lam". There was talk here
to-night of the Fresno Canal and Irri
gation Company sending a posse to
prevent the completion of the dams,
but up to 10 o'clock the officers had not
left. If such an attempt is made there
will surely be serious trouble, because
the farmers have -cached a pitch where
they will not give up without a strug
gle.

A BRIGHTENING PROSPECT.
W r HILE the recent rains have not been very
profuse, they have served to freshen the soil
over wide areas of the State and brighten the
prospects of a considerable number of rural indus
tries. The outlook, therefore, for those whose crops
were not destroyed by the frosts is decidedly better
than it was a short time ago, and we may now rea
sonably entertain a hope for fairly good returns for
the season.
It seems conceded that the peaches and apricots
of a large portion of the State are dead. The prune
growers, on the other hand, have been more fortu
nate. With the exception of localities where the
trees blossomed unusually early, the prunes have not
been seriously injured, and even where the effect of
the frosts was felt among the prunes it is believed
that the fruit destroyed win amount to no more than
a desirable thinning of the crop.
To the grazing and hay-raising portions of the
State the rain was of course a benefit of great value.
Every drop of it was precious. It carried hope and
the prospects of safety to the interests of many a
cattleman whose herds have long been living on short
rations. It enables them to hold out for a time, at
any rate, and may prove to be sufficient at least in
some localities to carry the stock along until arrange
ments can be made for removing them to better pas
tures.
It is still some time yet before the regular dry sea
son sets in. and there is a fair assumption that the
recent showers may be succeeded by others that will
be still more bountiful and beneficial. If this should
be so, the general orchard product of the State will
not be so far below the average as has been feared,
and our cattlemen may manage to pull through de
spite the refusal of our neighbors to permit Califor
nia stock to be taken to their States for pasture.
In California bad times are never altogether bad.
The dry winter may yet be followed by a spring
rainy enough to bring many of its diverse crdps to a
profitable fruition, so that when the yearly balance is
struck the State will make a showing not inferior
â to that of any other in the Union!
fIS WflS EXPECTED.
OF our Eastern exchanges the Philadelphia In
quirer is the first to come to us with the ex
pected editorial on the recent earthquake, and it
contains exactly what expectation was prepared for.
The Inquirer pronounces the California temblor to
be worse than the multitudinous storms that afflict
the East. It says: "We can guard against the light
ning and the floods, and, to some extent, meteorology
has been able to warn against the coming of the tor
nado or the cyclone. But an earthquake, as James
Whitcomb Riley has said in one of his dialect poems,
'would yank ye out'n yer grave.' "
Furthermore the Philadelphia critic will, have it
that the shock felt here was too great to have been
merely a local agitation. It says: "The fact that
there was also a huge tidal wave in the harbor of San
Francisco may suggest that there had been a serious
seismic disturbance or cataclysm in the Far East of
which we may yet hear."
It is in the expectation of hearing of such a cata
clysm that the East is now holding its ear to the
ground, and the expectation may not be wholly in
vain. A suggestion is as good as a news item to yel
low journals, and while the Inquirer would scorn to
perpetrate a fake itself, there is something more
than a chance that the idea of a serious seismic dis
turbance in tlfe remote Orient having been advanced
may prompt some saffron space writer to get up a
dispatch from the Emperor of China or the Ahkoond
of Swat announcing a shake-up in his kingdom that
transformed valleys into mountains and mountains
into holes in the ground.
The Inquirer concludes with the assertion that "the
people of California, who have been free from such
disturbances for quite a time, will now have their old
fears revived, and those of San Francisco will look
to the better and surer construction of their build
ing?."
After the references to the huge tidal wave and the
seismic cataclysm in the East such a conclu
sion is something of a mild anti-climax. How
ever, it will do. The Inquirer will please
take notice that Californians have revived no
old fears, nor have they originated any new ones.
Moreover,' they are well satisfied with the construc
tion of their buildings so far as private edifices are
concerned, and such desires as they have for better
and safer construction on- the part of public buildings
are due not so much to earthquakes as to boodle â
less to any possible seismic cataclysms in the Far
Hast than to the manipulation of Colonel Mazuma at
home.
SOMETHING TO INVESTIGATE.
THERE* is a Senate committee empowered to
investigate State institutions. It was appointed
for the purpose of determining whether the
funds for the maintenance of these institutions are
being properly applied or being wasted. The com
mittee will report at the next session of the Legisla
ture, and there are reasons for supposing that it will
have considerable to report. It has visited asylums of
every kind, reformatories and prisons. That all the
concerns it has looked into are faultlessly conducted
is not believed, and that shortages and mismanage
ment have been discovered will doubtless in time be
made known in the proper way.
But there is one State institution which should not
be overlooked, an institution which has been marked
by fraud, wastefulness and scandal; in which the money
voted by the people has been misapplied, the ac
cepted plans ignored for the benefit of contractors,
inferior material used at the price of good material,
and in which altogether the men entrusted with the
performance of a public duty have shamelessly be
trayed the public. It is true, they have Leen exposed,
but not by any person or persons having authority to
more than call attention to the manifest shortcom
ings. It is almost needless to add that reference is
had to the ferry depot.
To erect this building the State voted a large sum.
That the amount would be ample there was not the
slightest reason to doubt. No calculation was made
upon the circumstance that the Harbor Commission
ers might divert some of the money from the pre
scribed channels. It never entered the mind that
specifications were to be altered to suit bidders after
their bids had been accepted, and that instead of an
edifice sound and honest from the foundation to the
tower there was to be a structure a very monument
of fraud. The Call has shown conclusively that the
ferry depot is a false pretense, that in almost every
department it is a swindle, that the taxpayers have
been deliberately and systematically cheated. It has
laid bare the facts and has not Hesitated to name the
culprits.
But however much a paper may do to arouse sen
timent, it cannot apply the penalty. It can show how
the law has been outraged; it has no way of bring
ing the offenders to bar. If they are dead to shame
and the proper officials, clothed in the legal right,
do not arraign them, then is the effort of the paper
gone for naught. Therefore The Call suggests that
the investigating committee pay the depot a visit,
that they look over plans, make note of changes, the
influences producing them and of the sorry result.
Let them listen to President Colnon and Architect
Swain and weigh the words of the pair against the in
disputable record. Let them have experts to assist
them, so the suavity of the accused shall not mislead,
and if they shall not find the depot a rotten job, for
which the responsible parties ought at least be dis
missed in disgrace from the positions they have
abused, there is no merit in figures and no virtue in
immutable truth.
The committee having in store the performance
of this important duty includes General John H.
Dickinson of Marin, J. J. Boyce of Santa Barbara,
C. M. Simpson of Pasadena, E. \V. Chapman, and W.
F. Prisk of Nevada. Here are five well-Mown gentle
men, each having had some experience in public life,
each aware that there are serious derelictions subject
to correction by them. It should be the business of
every member of the committee to make individual
effort to ferret out the crimes of which evidence has
been laid before them, and which, unrebuked and un
punished, would be a lasting reproach to the State.
ANOTHER FALLACY EXPLODED.
DURING the campaign of 1806 there were two
assertions which the free silver advocates were
never weary of uttering. They declared over
and over again, through the press and on the stump,
that the price of wheat was inseparably allied with the
price of silver and that gold could never be depended
on to supply the nation with money in time of war.
Gold, they shouted, is a coward. When war comes
it flies the country. The slightest disturbance of
peaceful conditions, they maintained, would be suffi
cient to cause the withdrawal of gold from the ccharn r
nels of trade and send it into hoarding until peace
returned.
If events had been planned in advance by the sup
porters of sound money to refute these statements of
the silverites by the resistless logic of facts they could
not have been arranged to do so more opportunely
and potently- than has resulted from the natural evo
lution of our affairs. First came the rise of wheat,
accompanied by a continued fall in the price of silver,
and now comes a steady import of gold into the
United States during weeks of excitement caused by
the approach of what appears to be inevitable war.
Since the current movement of gold from Europe
and Australia to the United States began there has
already come into the country more than $40,000,000,
a sum far in excess of the entire amount imported
during the whole of the last calendar year, and the
movement has not yet reached its limit. So far from
flying the country because of the danger of war,
gold is coming in as if. it was expected to make a
profit out of it.
The importations have led to a large increase in
the proportion of gold paid into the treasury for
customs duties. They. have also led to an enlarged use
of gold as a circulating medium in the East. There
is in fact the very opposite of a gold stringency in
the money markets of the country. Some financial
authorities even look for an excessive amount of it.
and the Philadelphia Record recently stated that if
the New York holders of long bills of exchange on
London should continue the present practice of trans
mitting the bills to London for discount instead of
holding them for maturity, "gold would speedily be
come almost a drug in the domestic financial
market."
The free silver men may not adopt a new platform
and a new issue for the next Presidential campaign,
but if they do not they will certainly have to invent
a new set of assertions to carry on the old fight.
More murders of reconcentrados are reported from
Cuba. This is the sort of thing the Junta big guns
say they will endure rather than have the United
States intervene except upon terms the agitators may
prescribe. But, come to think of it, the Junta fel
lows have not been notably assassinated, nor is it of
record that they have missed many meals. Their
fortitude might be termed a false alarm.
Havana papers say this country seems determined
to "eat the pear," the evident assumption being that
we regard Cuba as fruit. As a matter of fact there is
no desire to possess Cuba; only a strong desire that
Spain shall not possess it. We are getting particular
as to the kind of neighbors we have.
It would be a patriotic act for the people to pause
long enough amid the clamor of war preparations to
ride Rubens of the Cuban Junta out of the country
on a rail.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 1898.
MONGERS OF DOUBTFUL NEWS.
IT is impossible not to have a feeling of contempt
for G. F. Tilton and the newly developed tribe of
avaricious mongers of doubtful news of which he
may be taken as a specimen. Tilton was an officer
of one of the whaling vessels ice-bound in the Arctic.
Concerning the fate of these there has been much
speculation and concern. At the instigation of the
press a relief expedition was sent in search of them,
and since this expedition disappeared on its errand of
mercy into the wilds of Alaska no word had come
from it, and none could reasonably have been ex
pected.
Tilton left his vessel and by an overland trip of
extraordinary length reached civilization. While
coming out he met the relief party, and had he not
done so^ would in all likelihood have perished by the
way. Yet Tilton will give no information as to the
condition of the whalers, will not tell whether he
left them in fear of starvation, whether the relief can
get to them in time to be of service, or how fared
the party he met. Before he will open his mouth he
wants a large sum of money. There could hardly be in
gratitude more base. Thousands of dollars had been
freely contributed by people who could have no self
ish interest in the hope of saving Tilton and his com
rades. A decent respect for the consideration shown
would have prompted Tilton to an opposite course.
He would have been glad to tell the world what he
knew of the Arctic prisoners and would have scorned
to place a price on his information. He is like the
messenger from a beleaguered city coming to the
friendly army and seeking there to be bribed.
The actions of Tilton have been such as to dis
credit any story he may rlow choose to tell. By as
suming the air of a man possessed of great and won
derful secrets he has directed against himself the sus
picion of being a faker. His arrival, unfortunately for
his hopes, was close to that of Jack Carr with a
bogus and silly Andree story it was sought to sell.
Nor is it forgotten that after a wreck along the north
ern coast not long ago a petty officer covered himself
with odium by refusing to tell who had been lost
and who saved unless the question was accompanied
by a fee. There are getting to be too many of the
Tilton variety. They constitute a nuisance, their
stories are apt to be hazy and they to have an ex
aggerated idea of the worth of them if true. There
is a cheerful probability that by his display of swin
ishness Tilton has lost the chance of getting even a
modest and appropriate price for his article. It is
supposed to be made up of his own history, and this
could not be of special worth.
WHITHER DO WE DRIFT?
I \ERSONS who keep track of current exposures
L^of political corruption cafcnot have failed to
notice that for a long time past an unaccount
able moral lethargy seems to have had possession of
the people. The Germans have a word which signi
fies "think lazy." The stolid indifference with which
many recent official disclosures have been received by
the masses must be attributable to some such mental
condition as that. Upon subjects of moral turpitude,
no matter how grave, the people appear to have be
come too tired to think.
During the past six months The Call has exposed
political corruption in half a dozen of the highest
places in the State. It has proved that the State
Prison Directors have for years been systematically
cheating the people in prison-made jute goods. It
has exposed a conspiracy to steal the water
works of Los Angeles. It has produced facts and fig
ures to show that the Harbor Commissioners have
defrauded the State in the construction of the new
ferry depot. It has uncovered frauds in street work
in this city, a water steal in Oakland, bribery in Sac
ramento and the embezzlement of public funds at
San Jose. Yet we have still to hear of a Grand Jury
finding an indictment or of a District Attorney pre
senting an information.
There must be some reason for this. It is impos
sible that the facts published by this journal are dis
credited by the officials entrusted with the adminis
tration of the law. In most cases they have been es
tablished by confession. Oakland's boodle Council
men do not deny that Colonel Mazuma persuaded
them to fix water rates, the San Jose Justices of the
Peace acknowledge their shortages, the water works
scandal crookedness of Los Angeles was openly ad
mitted, and the perpetrators of the street frauds of
this city are proud of their thievery. If Harbor Com
missioner Colnon is not amused by the record he has
made it is because he still cherishes regard for some
of his former friends.
Under normal conditions, at the present time the
jails of California ought to be full of political thieves.
Yet it appears that not a single one has even been in
dicted. What is the cause of all this? Have the yel
low papers with their poster type and brilliant ink so
blunted the understanding of the masses that they
are no longer able to distinguish the difference be
tween right and wrong? Or have the political "re
formers" howled so long and so loud that their sanity
has become a serious question? What is the matter
with the District Attorneys and trie grand juries?
The laws are plain and ample and brimful of penalties.
In some cases The Call has reproduced the statutes
and linked them to the crimes against which they are
directed. Yet the door of no jail has been opened
and the political thieves are everywhere laying their
plans for the coming campaign. Some of them will
undoubtedly soon be running for office.
All this is very strange. We confess our inability
to explain it. One interesting question only remains.
Whither is this public indifference to political crime
leading? Are we upon the verge of an era in which
robbing the people and stealing their taxes is to be
come a sign of good breeding and an evidence of
respectability?
It has come to light that the straw bondsmen de
tected in swearing falsely to the possession of prop
erty, and denounced mildly yesterday morning as de
serving to be in jail, are also on the bonds of some
body else. The decision of yesterday must be
amended. The fellows deserve to be in two jails.
Some of the Madrid correspondents have a won
derful command of language, but at this point their
ability ends. There is no way of ascertaining whether
they try to command an occasional fact, but if so the
fact is invariably guilty of insubordination.
Perhaps France may not release Dreyfus, as rumor
intimates to be possible, but in justice to herself she
ought to take him out of his cage. There is nothing
dignified in a nation's running the show business.
According to a dispatch from Paris the Spanish
Consulate at Washington has been wrecked. This
shows at least the wisdom of going away from home
to get news of a really startling character.
There can be no objection to the President's hoping
for peace. The only possible dissent must arise as to
the manner of securing it

evident from the rather knowing beam
in her eye. and that her grief at the loss
of her vanished half was excessive was
made evident by the length of the crepe
stringers that were attached to her chic
little bonnet and that hung nearly four
feet down her back. All went well with
the little lady until she reached the cor
ner of Market street and started to turn
into that thoroughfare, then her trouble
came along in the shape of a gust of wind,
which catching: her attestations of sor
row, whirled them around just as an old
gentleman was passing whose tall silk
hat they roped and pulled off his head.
The old gentleman said something to him
self which, though spoken sotto voce, was
evidently in the nature of a severe crit
icism of womankind In general and of
the pretty widow in particular. The
widow, overcome with embarrassment,
turned to make an apology, when the end
of her crepe struck a horse in the eye
and the animal started to beat an elec
tric car down Third street, pursued by
his driver, who In turn was chased by a
policeman with threats of capture and
subsequent incarceration for breaking the
law prohibiting bad language.
The lovely cause of all this disaster,
leaning against a post, watched with a
quiet smile the hurried departure of the
horse and the two-legged animals, and
when they had vanished in a cloud of
dust started to continue her way. Her
friend, the wind, however, had not fin
ished its joking. While she had remained
stationary it had been busily engaged in
wrapping the bonnet stringers around the
post. So, with the first step she took,
the dainty bit of head gear was yanked
from its golden pedestal and, falling to
the pavement, was pounced upon by a
stranger dog, who made off with his prize
at a gait that was considerably acceler
ated by the howls of the dozen or more
street gamins who had been attracted by
the scene with the horse, and who started
in wild and Joyous pursuit.
The widow waited for no new develop-

lamentations, receiving from the girl In

To the Editor of the San Francisco Call-
Dear Sir: Your accusations against the
State Board of Harbor*. Commissioners
have excited quite a lot of comment in
these parts, the people feeling that it is
a State matter and that they were more
or less foolish for voting State bonds for
Central Pacific improvements at the start,
and especially if they are to be swindled
in the use of the proceeds.
Might I not ask. Is there no officer of
the board who is supposed to possess suf
ficient ability, either in a mechanical or
intellectual way, to "check up"Â« the plans
and specifications and see that the State
is not robbed?
If such officer, or engineer, or super
intendent accepts material so entirely in

possess guilty knowledge? Tours truly,

Much surprise was expressed to
night when It was announced that the
Grand Jury had adjourned Indefinitely.
This Is taken to Indicate that the Jurors
d i not see any prospect at present of
being able to reach the truth of the many
pcandals tnat are being openly discussed.
It was reported that Chairman Crooks
may not call the jury together acaln un
til ready to discuss their nnal report.
William J. Dingee, president of the Oak
land Water company, was before the
Grand Jury this afternoon. The Investi
gation was confine- throughout the day
- to the water rate business and the
alleged circumstances attending the elec
tion of the present City Council and
Mayor.
The following was Mr. Dingee's exam
ination:
â¢ "Were you interested in the election of
ihe sent City Council?"
"I was. I helped to elect my friends."
' "Did you know tnat Mr. Woodward was
to be appointed when Mr. J?'ibush re
signed?"
"I did not know of his appointment till
It had taken place; neither did I discuss
ii with anybody, being In complete ignor
ance."
"How long after his appointment did
to see him?"
"1 triod t.j Bee him the minute I heard
of It. 1 have discussed water rates with
every member of the Council except Mr.
(Jirarri, and 1 do > consider him as re- '
Fpor.sible for much that he says and
does."
"Do you -vow Mr. Moffltt?"
"I do."
"What are your relulons with him?"
"Of a business an>. friendly nature."
"Would you tell us ihe nature of the
business relations?"
"I will. We are interested In enter
- involving many thousands of dol
lars, and naturally we work together for
cur mutual benefit."
"Do you know anything of Mr. Moffitt's
private affairs?"
"TeÂ§, I know that he has a private In
come of comfortable proportions, such as
oubt many of you Grand Jurors
â  BS."
"What is the nature of your friendship
for Mr. Moffltt?"
"We are the best of friends."
"In what way is Mr. Moffltt connected
â with the Oakland Water Company? Has
be been the political manager ior the cor
poration?"
"Mr. Moffitt has no technical connection
.. with the Oakland 'Water Company; he la â 
-. not on its payroll, he has never received
â¢ .a penny from the company and neither
. l.as ho ever been its political manager.
: "We have discussed many things together

â  .'He has never handled any money for the

.â â XEMngee regarding his anxiety to elect cer
â  i.iiii Coundlmen, and how far he had
".' fepne in showing the depth of his friend

â¢ As soon as he was asked his name, ad
: dress and other preliminary questions, the
District Attorney said, "Are you in th<>
employ of the Oakland Water Company?"
'. â  Mr. Moffltt's pencil at once started to
; . record the question on his pad of fools
cap. At this action of his some of the
Grand Jury protested and asked Mr.
Moffltt what he was doing.
â  " Mr. Moffltt said: "Gentlemen, It Is a
. notorious fact that within one hour of
â¢'.'. the adjournment of this Grand Jury
. everything that has transpired within
â this room is public property and is the
common talk of everybody on the street.
Friends of mine who have testified here
:..,liave been annoyed by seeing their testi
mo ny published in the newspapers in a
garbled and untruthful fashion and so
worded as to help the various political
â¢ Ideas of those who are responsible for
'â  their publication. I determined, there
fore, that when I came before this Grand
â¢ ; Jury I would myself keep a record of
. ' every Question and every answer that
transpired, so that in case of misrepre

public the whole truth in my own inter
. Â«sts and for my own protection If neces
sary."
"Do you Intend to carry out your idea,
Mr. Moffltt?" asked a juror.
. "I do," he replied.
Jerry Tyrrell, himself an old politician,
made a motion that Mr. Moffltt be ad
judged guilty of contempt of the- Grand
Jury. The motion was promptly second
ed, whereupon Foreman Crooks asked the
District Attorney if such a course as Mr.
â  Mollkt proposed to take were permis

Mr. Snook replied that he knew of no
law that would prevent a man from doing
such a thing, and he could not therefore
â  advise the jury that such a course was
Illegal.
â¢It was then proposed that Mr. MoflHt
be excused for fifteen minutes, and he

Mr. Moffltt replied that if it was not

PLANS OF THE NEW STEEL BRIDGE ACROSS THE HARBOR.
BOLD ATTACK ON
CLASSIC METHODS
Outbreak of a Smoldering
Controversy at the State
University.
Professor Flagg Denounces the Sys
tem of Markfc. and Examinations
In Vojue at Berkeley.
BERKELEY. April 7.â Associate Pro
fessor Isaac Flagg of the department of
classical philology at the State Univer
sity, in an article in the latest number of
the university magazine on Â±he Trans
lation Habit," makes a number of state
ments likely to startle his fellow mem
bers of the faculty. He denounces as
"detestable" tue system of marks and
examinations which is at present fol
lowed at Berkeley, and declares that ab
solute freedom from prescription is neces
sary for the attainment of scholarly
standards and enthusiasm.
Professor Flar- incidentally takes a
fling at the degree of bachelor oi arts, as
conferred at the University of California
at present. He declares it is based upon
an impossible theory, and that the mat
tf r is a mischief that will have to be rem
edied when the university comes to be
reorganized for academic freedom.
Professor Fiagg's criticism is not con
fined to the State University, but extends
to high schools and other educational in
stitutions all over the State. He char
acterizes the method of teaching the clas
sics at present in vogue as "a travesty
of true learning, accepted daily in our
schools and colleges, with fatuous com
placency, of students who have not read
that which they are required to trans
late."
He thus sums up the effect which the
"translation habit" has brought about:
"In the domain of scholarship transla
tion and grammatical analysis have been
converted into counterfeit adumbrations
Of the true arts of reading and writing."
"When the University of California
finally comes to be organized for aca
demic freedom, thrre is other mischief
that will need to be amended besides that
attendant upon an impossible theory of
the degree of bachelor of arts. In the is
suing of recommendations for teachers'
certificates covering specified branches
of learning, on the completion of a cer
tain number of courses therein, we are
confronted with a new form of prescrip
tion, which bids fair to outdo the old one
In its degrading and demoralizing effects.
Prescription, disguise it as you will, may
always be known by the shapes that fol
low In its train: the schoolboy spirit
whore the scholarly spirit ought to pre
vail, "lesson-bibbing" in the place of
spontaneous inauir- the impertinence of
graded marks of meritâ everything to fos
ter puerility and repress true manly and
womanly aspiration.
"Maria and examinations, viewed as in
centives to study, are uotestablo. Yet to
what higher motive is it possible to ap
p< ;.i with a body of students who are not
free moral agents, but the tools of an
arbitrary, complicated system of Inter
ference? Scholarly standards and enthu-
Biasm are attainable only under a nat
ural adjustment of relations, and this is
defeated by any scheme of prescription."
Professor Fiagg's views on the proper
method of teaching the classics are not
generally shared by his fellow Instruct
ors Professor Edward B. Clapp, the head
of the department of classical philology,
entertains views on the subject radically
different from those of bis associate.
Among graduate and undergraduate
Classical students there are two broadly
defli ed groups, each following, more or
less closely, the classical ideas and ideals
of the two professors
Whether Professor Clapp or his follow
ers will take up the gauntlet which Pro
fessor Flags hns boldly thrown down Is

The plans were forwarded to Washing

The plans have been carefully prepared

that time.
The now steel bridge will be 992 feet
long, and will be so constructed that
there will be two electric car tracks over j
It as well as two independent footways. ;
The total cost of the structure is esti- j
mated to be $92,000, and it has to have a
Space of 300 feet clear in the draw.
Owing to the nature of the foundation :
much of the work has to be done under j
water, and in addition to extensive pil- ]

will have to be some diversion of travel ]
at the point of the new bridge for some ;
months, as it will be necessary to remove
the old bridge at once so that work will
commence on the foundations. While j
these foundations are being built the ;
steel work for the superstructure will be j
manufactured and put together as much
as possible, so that the obstruction to j
travel will be as short as possible.
All the steel work will be made by Call- j

FRUIT TO BE
VERY SCARCE
Commission Men Doubtful of
Their Ability to Fill
Contracts.
Returned Agents From the East Are
Decidedly Disappointed at
the Prospect.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 7.
The commission merchants of this city
who entered into a contract with the
Southern Pacific to carry not less than
twenty-five tons of fruit per day from
the Sacramento River are now in an un
comfortable frame of mind. There is a
certainty that the fruit crop will be very
small, and the reports from up the river
show that it will be almost an impossi
bility for the commission men to fulfill
their contracts. The agents of commis
sion men have already sent down re
ports that the river orchard men will
not be able to send anything like the
usual supply, and some of the merchants
are going up the river to make personal
inquiry.
The opposition to the Eleventh-street
merchants, which was established at the
Adams wharves last summer, is rejoic
ing at the apparent discomfiture of the
Eleventh-street men. It charters its own
boats as it lias need for them, and
stands no chance of any loss on account
of the small crop, not having any con
tract to guarantee a certain amount of
freight.
Some of the best known growers of this
county went East several weeks ago and
found an unusual demand for California
fruits, and closed large orders at good
prices. On their return they discovered
that there is great danger of their not
being able to fulfill these contracts and
they now have agents out in all direc
tions buying up all the fruit available
and giving good prices. On the whole
the position of the fruit growers at this
time is not one to be envied.

COFFIN'S CASE
TO BE TRIED
The Defense Promises a
Big Political Sen
sation.
i
Alleged Pollution of Water Is
Allowed for Seven
Months.
The Suit Said to Be â  Conspiracy
Hatched by the Water
Companies.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. April 7.
William J. Dingee, Dr. George C.
Pardee, ex-Judge E. M. Gibson, ex-
Senator Frank J. Moffltt, Bobert
Knight, County Assessor Dalton, W.
H. T. Watkinson, Fred A. Campbell,
Daniel Doody, W. B. Beattie and F.
Prindle.
This imposing list of witnesses has been
s .nmoned to aprtear in a suit to-morrow
in Justice Cliffs court that is promised
to reveal more political secrets and inside
history of tiie scandal connected wltn iue
election of the present City Coi \c " and
Mayor than has yet come to light, even
through the lediuir of the street gossip i
oÂ» ihe Grand Jury. In conducting this ;
case there will be no ban of confidence I
or diffidence that necessarily exists in j
star chamber proceedings, for ex-Mayor !
M. C. Chapman will appear for the de- i
fendant, ami in law courts Mr. Chapman
does not mince his sentences or fall into j
the weakness of what Judge Greene calls '
"scattering. "
The suit is brought ostensibly on behalf
of the peoplo against a small rancher
named O. Ln.iin, who is charged with
maintaining: a nuisance and polluting the (
waters of one of the tributaries of Temes- i
cal^rcek, which is a puliMc water supply.
In reality, the suit is an evidence of the ;
bitter tight that prevailed between the >
two water companies last September, i
when it was filed. It has dragged along,
"the people ' apparently not being anx
ious to purify its water supply, and the i
defenso courteo'is.y acceding to all sug
gestions of continuances.
It will be the policy of the defense to
show that the suit was brought simply j
for the purpose of -sedition and for the i
further purpose â â ' making unpopular the j
character of the Contra Costa Company's
water, thus inforentially booming the
liquid of the rival company.
The defense intends in pursuance of this
line of combat to show that the parties ;
who brought the suit acted under the
orders of their superiors, the employes
of the Board of Heath, which board in |
turn was appointed by Mayor Thomas
for reasons which the defense will try
to prove, and that Mayor Thomas was
nominated by a convention which was
named by the now celebrated Commit
tee of Twenty-one, which was in turn
named by seven members of the Republi
can City Central Committee, who were
nominated by four men avowedly in the
interests of a water company.
After the filing of the complaint fifty
witnesses were taken out to the pcene of
the alleged pollution by the defense, and
all are prepared to testify that the sew
age from Coffin's barn is carried off and
was last September, in the opposite direc
tion to the bank sloping to the creek.
The water was sampled a quarter of a
mile below the alleged point of pollution
and declared to be absolutely clear and
healthful. The creek th*>n emptied itself
into a six-inch pipe, and to the surprise
of the explorers who followed the pipe
they found that it carried all the water
directly to Fcrnwood, Mr. W. J. Dingee's
palatial home. It is further stated and
evidence to this effect will be brought
forth that not a drop of the water es
caped the pipe, and consequently could
not possibly, even supposing that it were
polluted, connect with any public water
supply.
Last September, when the suit was
brought, the water companies were at
war, but since that time they have come
together and there is no longer any de
sire to show teeth at each other. This
accounts for the peculiar fact that for
seven months the public officials have
knowingly permitted, according to their
allegations, a public water supply to be
polluted and yet have passively asked for
and obtained continuances all this time.
Now Coffin is anxious to have the matter
cleared up, and to-morrow the prelimi
nary examination of this "high misde
meanor" will commence.

DAVIDSON ON ALASKA.
The Professor Emphasizes the Im-
portance of California's Gold
Fields.
BERKELET, April 7.â Professor George
Davidson delivered a lecture to a large
and appreciative audience at the uni
versity last evening on "The Physical
Features and Resources of Alaska." The
lecture was given under the auspices of
the Alameda County Miners' Associa
tion and was held in the physics lecture
room in South Hall, which was crowded
to its fullest capacity to accommodate
the crowd of university students and
visitors from Oakland and San Fran
cisco.
The lecture was Illustrated by a large
number of lantern slides. Professor S. B.
Christy, the dean of the college of mining
of the university, introduced the speaker.
Professor Davidson spoke briefly of the
geological and geographical features of
Alaska. He declared that no territory of
its extent presents such a variety of cli
matic conditions, and that few people
realize the wealth of its resources. Al
rondy, he declared, the value of the prod
ucts that have been taken from Alaska
has been many times greater than the
price paid for the Territory by the United
States.
Professor Davidson described the vari
ous trail routes to the Klondike, and pre
dicted that tin) Chllcoot Pass will come
to be the principal route if stock is to be
transported into the gold country.
In conclusion. Professor Davidson em
phasized the hardships which the Klon
diker will have to encounter, and remind
ed his hearers that the placers of Siski
you and Trinity offer a field almost as
promising and far less perilous than tne
Klondike.
Charles G. Yale followed Professor
Davidson with an Interesting . rcount of
experiences on a recent trip up the Yu
kon. He declared that the Yukon route
is by far the best one to take to the
Klondike.
Young Men Riot.
OAKLAND, April 7.â The meeting of the
Pulcifer wing of the Young Men's Re

and a squad of police had to clear the
hall. Owing to an alleged unparliamen
tary proceeding a year ago there are two
bodies claiming to be the Young Men's
League. A week ago about 300 met and
elected officers. This is called the Pardee
faction. To-night Harry Pulcifer, who
leads the Davis faction, called a meeting
and the whole of the rival league attend

ternal Hall. There were several fist
fights, and Captain Carson and Officers
Hynes and Williams drove the combat
ants out on the street and dispersed the
crowd. There was no business transact

ARE PLAYING
HIDE AND SEEK
Another Expedition to
Search for the "Island
of Gold."
Captain Moore and the British
Capitalists to Be Closely
Followed.
ThÂ« Schocnar Altalr Will Stnrt
Immediately in the Wake of
the Free Trade.
There is to be a race for thÂ« "Island
of Gold," for which the schooner Free
Trade has started out to search. H.
Talbot Watson and the other British
capitalists interested with him in the
venture are not to have it all their own
way, and the chances are that unless
good luck attends them, another party
of gold hunters will be In possession
when they reach the new El Dorado.
The schooner Atair is now receiving
a thorough overhauling and as soon as
all the repairs have been made and the
stores are aboard she will start out
in the wake of the Free Trade. Her
master and owners say she can sail a
knot and a half to the Free Trade's
one, so the latter's long start will not
be such a serious handicap in the long
run.
When the Free Trade was being fitted
out Captain Moore had for his first
officer Captain Charles Gilbert. Be
fore the sailing day came around the
two men quarreled and in consequence
Gilbert libeled the schooner for $70
wages due him. He got his money
and the Free Trade went to sea with
another first mate. Now Captain Gil
bert asserts that it was he who dis
covered the "Island of Gold" and that
Captain Moore has only the general
sailing directions and does not know
the exact location of the quartz ledges.
The exact latitude and longitude are
in his possession, however, and he can
go direct to the spot, while the Free
Trade will be sailed from pillar to post
in search of a will o' the wisp.
Captain Gilbert's story in effect is as
follows: A couple of years ago he
made a cruise to the canneries in the
ship St. Nicholas. While out on a
hunting expedition he ran across the
quartz ledges in question and at once
saw their value. He brought some of
the specimens to San Francisco and an
assay showed them to be very rich in
gold. Gilbert made another trip north
in the St. Nicholas and relocated his
treasure island. On his return to San
Francisco he met Captain Moore,
whom he had known for many years,
and told him about the quartz ledges.
"Moore broke faith with me," said
Captain Gilbert yesterday. "He want
ed all the information and then tried
to get away with everything in sight.
That was the reason I left the Free
Trade. Captain Moore knows the right
course to steer, but he does not know
the location of my find, and I don't
think he will ever find it. Anyhow,
the Altair can sail rings around the
Free Trade, so I will beat her up any
how."
At the back of the new venture are
A. P. Hotaling, the millionaire liquor
dealer, and ex-Judge Gordon, and they
are sending along with the expedition
C. Carroll, a mining expert. Captain
Gilbert will take along C. Holmes as
first officer, George Forrest second offi
cer and five seamen. They expect to be
gone about two months.
The schooner Hattie L Phillips is be
ing got ready for a trip to St. Michael
j with the party of hardy gold hunters
I who came out here from Gloucester,
! Mass., on her. When the schooner ar
i rived here the season was not far
| enough advanced to make the voyage
Ito the Yukon, so Captain Blackburn
accepted a charter and went north for
a load of lumber. The schooner got
back a couple of days ago, and her
j owners are now outfitting for a two
! years' stay in the frozen north. They
I are taking along a steam launch and
j six dories, and if possible will sell the
i schooner at St. Michael. If not the
: Phillips will be laid up until they re
turn from the gold fields, and then the
entire party will go back home in her.
The paddle steamer Tiger is now al
most ready for her voyage to St. Mi
chael and as soon as all the equipments
are aboard Dollard will be
ready to start at a moment's notice.
The inspectors of hulls and boilers tried
her under steam yesterday and found
everything in first-class order, and Ma
rine Superintendent Tabrett of the Ris
don Iron Works says the Tiger's en
gines and boilers are one of the best
jobs ever turned out of their shop.
Lightship No. 70 is in position on the
bar and the old whistling buoy has
disappeared. Yesterday No. 70, In com
mand of Captain Lowell, and the light
house tender Madrono, in command of
Captain Davis, went out over the bar,
and once her anchorage was reached it
did not take long to drop the big mush
room anchor and make everything
snug on the lichtship. The Madrono
then took up the whistling buoy and
returned to the city. Last night the
lightship's signals sounded for the first
time on the bar, and her masthead
lights served as beacons for ships en
tering and leaving port.
After considerable delay the steamer
Humboldt finally got away for Dyea
and Skaguay yesterday afternoon.
About 125 passengers went up on her
and about 150 more will join at Seat
tle. There was some delay over the
getting of the freight aboard, but as
soon as that was fixed up it did not
take the steamer long to get under
way. Max Kalish, agent of the vessel,
went up on her.

LAVATOR HAD
A BAD NIGHT
Finished Next to Last in
the Waterhouse Stake
at Oakland.
Broke Watches in Trials and
the Public in Actual
Racing.
Jockey Gouin Earned Applause for
Hie Piloting of May W â Four
Choices Downed.
The muchly-touted Lavator from the j
bonbon string of Walter Jennings had j
another "try" in the Waterhouse stake
at Oakland yesterday. On his first public
appearance he was played for a mild
"killing," and when the barrier was re
leased he forgot to po with the field.
Bli 'bar time horsemen that have held
clocks en the Salvator youngster have
tucked their timers nwny with the con
viction firmly Imbedded in their minds
that they wanted a bet on him when he
Started. Well, ho started yesterday, and
everybody strung their checks his way,
forcing the odd? down from 6 to 5 to 4 to
6. The distance was four and a half fur
longs, and Lavator fought it out with
Ocorona for last position. Olnyton got
him away well, hut the chestnut showed j
not a particle of speed from the outset. ;
Ollnthus, the brother to Piggs, ridden by
Henry Shields, and 5 to 1 in the betting,
collared Humidity when a short distance
had been covered, and won with ease.
Sevens, the bay fllly. carrying 120 pounds,
ran a surprising race, securing the middle
section of the prize after a drive, from
Humidity. , . ,
Favorites were in poor form again, tak
ing but two purses. Though the books
were hit hard on one or two races, the
layers of odds undoubtedly quit well
I on the day.
Candle Black locked a "moral for the
opening flve-furlong scramble. but
Thorp.' on Baticoy, an outsider, put up .
the most vigorous ride, and the favorite;
Was beaten a head.
The dash at four furlongs for maiden
two-year-olds was only a gallop for the
Baldwin entry Relna de Cuba, winch won
galloping from Zacatosa at odds of 4 to 1.
Rainer, backed from seven down to 13 to
5 favoritism, ran Into show.
Free I>ady. the even money choice for
the seven-furlong selling run. held her
field safe from the start, finishing at the
wire over two lengths before official, the
second choice. K<l Oartland was third.
When Jockey Gouin Landed May w win
ner of the six-furlong sprint, defeating
the odds on choice O'Connell and the
speedy Montgomery, he was the recipient
of a flattering ovation. The Eastern boy ;
rode an excellent race and was quite
worthy of all the noise bestowed. Thorpe,
on the favorite as usual, tri'-d to break
all existing records, and when challenged
by May \V in the stretch was all out,
proving easy prey for the mare, which
won cleverly in 1 : 14 1 -. Montgomery was
an indistinct third.
The final mile race went to the 5 to 2
favorite Twinkler. The latter came from
the rear, and after a Bevere tussle led
The Plutocrat out by a length in 1:42.
Mocorito, after cutting out a hot pace,
finished third-

mile and a <iuarter together. The former fin

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 1898.
LO YUEN AND GON SHEE.
An Elopement Which Is Stirring Up Chinatown.
There is great excitement among: the members of the Young Wo
tong of the Six Companies, in Chinatown, over the elopement or ab
duction of the wife of Tong Lum Dye, a shrimp fisher, who has a camp
in San Mateo County. Tong Lum Dye, who is a member of the Young
Wo Association, had his home on Stockton street and left his wife
there with her mother while he attended to his business at his fish
camp.
Some weeks ago Lo Yuen, a sewing machine worker, rented a
room on the floor with the family of Tong Lum Dye, and was not
long in acquainting himself with the circumstances surrounding the
shrimp fisher's family. He ingratiated himself with Gon Shee, the
wife, and her mother, and soon came to be looked upon as a friend in
whom every confidence could be placed.
Last Saturday Lo Yuen came to the house and told Gon Shee that
her husband had sent for her to come to his camp in San Mateo Coun
ty and bring with her money and jewelry. The woman made her prep
arations and took not only her own money, but that of her sister and
also the jewels of her relatives, with all the available money in the
house, making a total value of about $1000. The two left the house together
and from that time to this neither has been seen.
Investigation on the part of the husband and his friends revealed
the fact that the woman had purchased an American costume just
after leaving the house, and it is supposed that in this guise the pair
are living together somewhere in the city.
Yesterday a representative of the Young Wo Association went to
the City Hall and laid the matter before Chief Lees, and acting on his
advice, swore out a warrant for Lo Yuen on the charge of grand lar
ceny and kidnaping. It is the intention of the association to pros
ecute the pair to the fullest extent of the law, and in order that they
may be brought to justice the association has offered a reward of $100
for the arrest of Lo Yuen, or information that will lead to his arrest.
The elopement of a married woman is looked upon with particular
disfavor among the Chinese, and the energies of the tong will be di
rected toward avenging the wrong done to Tong Lum Dye, and while
American justice will be invoked to catch the offenders It is probable
that after the American courts get through with him he will have a
different reckoning with the inner circles of Chinese law which is
dealt out in Chinatown.

THE COURT IS
AFTER HOLLIDAY
Bench Warrant Issued
for the Arrest of an
Attorney.
Judge Joachimsen Declares His
Bonds of Two Thousand
Dollars Forfeited.
Conduct of Professional Sureties to
Bo Investigated by the
Grand Jury.
A. M. Holllday, an attorney, charged
â with a felony, has apparently fled from
the city, and yesterday morning Judge
Joachimsen declared his bonds forfeited
and issued a bench warrant for his ar
rest.
Holliday was arrested about ten days
ago on a warrant charging him with ob
taining money by false pretenses. The
complaining witness was N. J. Bailey, 132
Duncan street, who alleged that Holliday
had obtained from him in various sums
the total of over $1000. Bailey's mother
in-law is supposed to be one of the heirs
to a wealthy estate in England, and
through a lady friend he was induced to
employ Holliday to look after the case.
Holliday represented to Bailey that he
had a friend in London, England, named
W. E. Sterling, an attorney, who would
take charge of the case there, and by
means of "fake" telegrams from Ster
ling, who was a myth, he succeeded in
getting the money from Bailey till he
became suspicious and swore to the com
plaint for Holliday's arrest.
The charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses was withdrawn and Holliday
was charged with a felony in sending a
forged telegram. He was released on
$2')00 bonds, arid when the case was called
last Monday Holliday failed to appear in
court. He again tailed to appear Tues
day, Wednesday and yesterday, and then
Attorney Kelly, who represented Bailey,
asked that his bonds be declared for
feited.
Holliday's sureties are Thomas King,
764*2 Mission street, and Philip Reichert,
2646 Folsom street. The bond was ac
cepted by Justice of the Peace Groez
inger while he was presiding in Judge
Campbell's court and Bond Inspector
Newman drew Groezinger's attention to
the fact that both King and Reichert
were professional bondsmen and were on
a large number of bonds, but the justice
said he knew both men and they were all
right. They are the same two men who
attempted to qualify in the Cervantez
case in Judge Coffey's court, but Judge
Coffey refused to accept their bond.
The attention of the District Attorney
was called to the conduct of King and
Reichert, and he will take the matter
before the Grand Jury.

WORKS TO
DEFEND
THE CITY
Force of Men Engaged to
Strengthen the Interior
Line of Batteries.
Engineers of the Army Have the
Torpedo Material in Shape
for Use in the Harbor.
It comes to light now that large
forces of men recently engaged for
work under the direction of the army
engineers of the Pacific Division are
employed in building for the defense
of San Francisco new lines of interior
fortifications. The army will be pre
pared to firht at the heads with the
powerful twelve-inch batteries -at Fort
Point and Fort Baker (Lime Point),
and if through any chance of war one
or more hostile ironclads should man
age to pass the outer line of works the
fire of the interior batteries of Alca
traz, Angel Island and Gravelly Beach
would resist the further advance of the
enemy.
It was not disclosed until yesterday
â what work has been assigned to the
men recently employed. A heavy force
of workmen and fifteen teams are
â working at Angel Island. At Lime
Point remarkable activity prevails.
Colonel Charles R. Suter, division en
gineer, who has managed to conduct
the operations in his line with strict
secrecy, now admits that the workmen
at Lime Point are making emplace
ments for new batteries. At iirst it
was surmised that the military au
thorities, In emergency, intended to
supplement the 12-inch breech-ioading
rifles with 8-inch muzzle-loading con
verted rifles, but it is now definitely
ascertained that the plans contemplate
the immediate construction of emplace
ments for S-inch breech-loading rifles
and it is probable that several of the
new guns will be mounted on disap
pearing carriages.
Captain Blrkhimer's Batte^- L. of the
Third Artillery, now stationed at Lime
Point, has vacated the quarters belong
ing to the engineers and sought shelter
In tents. The wooden quarters are used
for the working parties. A regular
camp has been established and the
work of adding strength to the interior
line of works is going aheal with great
vlg-or.
The Lime Point reservation is one of
Jim McDonald goes east.
The Popular and Well-Known TJm-
piro a Member of the National
League Staff.
Jim McDonald, the popular baseball
umpire, left last night for the East, where
he will act as umpire in the National
League. His departure will be regretted
by every lover of baseball, as the quiet, .
dignified and impartia.l umpire has earned
their regard by his just decisions. He has
always enjoyed thy best of reputations in
his chosen sphere. In the many hundreds
of exciting contests in this city his deci
sions were never questioned by ball
player or spectator â something that Is un- ;
usual.
His Impartiality In baseball led many :
fight promoters to acquire his services as
referee, ajid, as in baseball, he gave .
universal satisfaction. It was disappoint- '
Ing for followers of pugilism to read in
The Call a few days ago that President
Young of tho National League had noti
fied him not to referee any more contests,
as they could always rely on McDonald
giving an honest decision.
Jim enjoys the distinction of being the '
only mail besides Kitzslmmons of putting
"Pompadour Jim" to sleep. He performed
the deed while attending school with Cor
bett In their yov.iger days, and even to
this day the future Congressman regards
McDonald with respect, as he is built on
tho same lines as the ex-champlon.

the most important owned by the
I'nited States. It extends from the
town limits of Sausalito to Point Bonita
and has a depth to the summit of the
hills. It is much larger than the Pre
sidio reservation and is destined to play
an important part in the defense of
San Francisco harbor.
The main battery on Lime Point is
480 feet above the level of the sea, and
is therefore classed as one of the
highest, if not the highest, in the
world. It is higher than the loftiest
battery of Gibraltar. Three 12-inch
breech-loading rifles mounted on bar
bette carriages are in position at the
highest fortified position of Lime Point.
Each gun has a seaward range of ten
miles, and can throw a steel projectile
of one thousand pounds weight that
distance.
In the division of duty Colonel Suter
has charge of the fortifications on the
north and south sides of the bay. which
territory embraces the batteries of
Fort Point, Fort Mason, the Presidio
proper and Lime Point. Major William
H. Heuer has charge of Angel Island,
Alcatraz and the torpedo station at
Goat Island.
The Intelligence comes from an au
thentic source that Major Heuer has
the torpedoes in readiness for immedi
ate use. The material stored at Goat
Island is not obsolete, hut is modern.
It was sent to Goat Island in 1893. Elec
trical apparatus for the submarine
mines has been secured and placed in
order. The shore connections or tor
pedo casemates have been established,
and the mines can therefore be planted
in the harbor whenever the hour of
danger arrives. The engineers do not
allow the public to know the inside
facts concerning the style of the sub
marine agencies or the methods of
manipulating: them. The location of
the torpedoes will be known only to
those who have the right to know.
Men of sound military judgment be
lieve that the War Department has
adopted a wise policy in strengthening
the interior line of works and putting
the torpedo system in readiness for im
mediate service.
SEQUEL TO A
PRIVATE DEAL
Raisch Loses a Contract
to Pave a Block on
Bush Street
A Story That Was Not Dis
closed at the Street Com
mittee Session.
A True Statement Under Oath Might
Have Been Very Em
barrassing.
The little contest between A. Raisch
and the Pacific Paving Company for
the privilege of paving with bituminous
rock under private contract Bush street
from Baker to Broderick was won by
the latter at the Street Committee
t meeting yesterday. Some interesting
facts were brought to light in the con
troversy. Shortly after the work was
projected one of Raisch's solicitors. In
his zeal to secure a majority of the
frontage for Raisch, forged the name
I of Antoine Borel to a petition for pri
| vate contract. Other signatures were
! obtained by fraud. It is said that the
] bona fide signatures obtained for the
Raisch contract represented only 254
: feet of the 825 feet frontage. The con
', tract price was 22 cents a square foot,
but private arrangements were made
on the side to do the work for certain
signers at a figure as low as 15 cents.
Raisch sought to get. at 18 cents, the
signatures obtained by the Pacific Pav
j ing Company. In time he obtained a
permit and threatened to go ahead with
1 the work. The Pacific Paving Com
; pany also decided to pave to the extent
of its frontage and obtained authority
; from the Street Committee to work un
der the permit granted to Raisch.
It seems that Raisch having agreed
with property owners Fitzgerald, Yen
, ker, Manning and Freeman to do their
work at a price below 1G cents sought
to compel the Pacific Paving Company
;to do the same work at that price. The
latter refused to go below 18 cents.
Raisch then went to the Street Super
intendent's office and got an order for
; the suspension of the work until the
; committee rendered a decision in the
premises.
Just before the committee met yes
| terday Raisch was told that he would
1 be compelled to make his statements
i concerning certain agreements under
â  oath to the committee, and that The
j Call's expert knew the inside facts
I concerning the arrangement to do the
j work for certain property owners at a
I figure less than 16 cents, while the con
; tract called for 22 cents. The story
1 goes that when Raisch reflected he de-
I cided to pay the Pacific Paving Com
: pany the difference between 15 and 18
; cents and allow the latter to do all the
work. When he was told that The
I Call was in possession of all the facts
; he decided to drop the contest in the
I committee. It is clear now that the
; original proposition under Raisch's
contract was to compel some of the
property owners to pay the top price,
I 22 cents, and allow a handsome rebate
I to others.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APUIL 8, 1898.
WILL ACT AS
CAPTAIN OF
THE PRISON
Nepotism Practiced in
the Police Depart
ment.
Chief Lees Provides for
His Nephew, Ser
geant Wolf.
Gives Him Captain Robinson's
Soft Job During the Lat
ter's Absence.
EXPERIENCE IS IGNORED.
The Selection Has Caused Consider
able Comment In Polloe
Circles.
For the next two weeks Sergeant Reu
ben Wolf, Chief Lees' nephew, wljl act as
captain of the cuy Prison. This fact was
announced last night by Chief Lees. In
explanation of the change, tne nead of
the Police Department said that Robin-
Bon had been granted a two weeks' leave
of absence, and that he intended to visit
his relatives in the East Just why Wolf
was selected to take his place was the
source of considerable comment at
police headquarters. Since his appoint
ment as a patrolman I^ees has been doing
all In his power to promote him. ArÂ°r a
hard struggle, he finally managed to make
him sergeant. Instead of assigning him
to some district, as Is always the case,
me Chief detailed him to act In conjunc
tion with Captalr -iouinson. His most la
borious work was to "look wise," as one
of his fellow-officers expressed it, and
smile benignly on the man in charge of
the prison. Robinson has been contem
plating a trip to the East for some time,
and the Chief, knowing this, had him
"school" his favored relative, so that he
could take his place during his absence.
Yesterday Wolf assumed the duties of
captain of the prison, much to the chagrin
of the men who have been acting as desk
sergeants for a long number of years
and who are manifestly more capable of
fulfilling the position than either Robin
son or Wolf.
Chief Lees, however, is determined to
provide for his pet relative, and it is
more than likely that he will endeavor
in the near future to advance him to the
rank of captain, if the other commis
sioners do not call a halt.
When asked last night why Robinson
was granted a leave ot absence. Lees
said:
"He is entitled to a vacation Just the
same as any other member of the de
partment, and instead of taking it when
his turn came he decided to wait until
the present time, so that he could visit
his relatives, who I believe live in the
East. I appreciated Wolf in his place as
I am thoroughly convinced that he is
competent to 1111 the position. The fact
that he is my nephew did not influence
me in the least, and I want that distinctly
understood. Rube is all right, and
don't you make any mistake about it. He
will be captain as long as Robinson is
gone, and if these other fellows continue
shooting off their mouths they will find
themselves before the commissioners for
violating a rule of the department. I am
running this department, and will do as
I please."
The Chief refused to discuss whether
or not he had Instructed Wolf to give
the prisoners a more liberal allowance of
bread than they received from Captain
Robinson.

Lecn Durand's Widow Telfs How He "Was Murdered.
Coroner Hawkins held an inquest yesterday morning on the body of
Leon Durand, who came to his death on April 3 from the effects of inju
ries received at the hands of John L. Carney.
Mrs. Cecelia Durand, the widow of the deceased, told the jury how Car
ney, who is the son of her landlord, came into her house in an intoxicated
condition and asked her for 10 cents -with which to get something to drink.
She offered him a dime with which to go for beer, but he objected and said
that he wanted whisky. He became very abusive after a while and made
a felonious assault upon her, forcibly seizing her and throwing her down
upon the floor twice. She screamed for her little boy to run and call his
father. The deceased came and threw Carney out of the house. Carney
returned in a few minutes with an iron bar in his hand and struck Durand
with it several times on the head, breaking his skull. Miles Lewis, a passer
by, witnessed the assault and corroborated the statements of the widow as
to the manner in which the injuries were inflicted.
The jury rendered a verdict to the effect that the deceased came to his
death from the injuries inflicted by Carney.
PHELAN CHECKS
TILTON'S SCHEME
Vetoes the Order Allow
ing $1400 for Sewer
Plans.
Already Paid $11,100 for Pre
paring Specifications for
the Work.
Tha Mayor Says Ho Can Hays the
Service Performed by a Com
petent Engineer for $300.
City anfl County Surveyor Tilton knows
a good thing when it comes his way, and
he is not averse to annexing it if he can
do so with propriety. His salary is small
âonly a paltry $500 a yearâ and it has
long been a source of wonder to those not
posted on the perquisites that fall to the
Surveyor's lot, how Mr. Tilton has been
content* to accept tha office term after
term, especially as the law requires that
he shall pay his assistants out of his own
pocket.
An incident of the meeting of the Street
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday shows how Mr. Tilton can af
ford Jo devote his time to city work, pay
his help and still have a little something
to the good.
Colonel Sullivan, Mayor Phelan's secre
tary, presented to the committee the
Mayor's veto of the order passed by the
board Monday authorizing Surveyor Til
ton to prepare plans for a sewer system
south of the park, and allowing him $1400
for the same. The Mayor gave as his rea
son for vetoing the order that the amount
was excessive, and stated that he had tho
word of a competent engineer that $300
would be a fair price for the work, which
would require about five days' time. Phe
lan called attention to the fact that Tilton
was paid $11,000 by the city less than a
year ago for devising the sewer system,
and that he had the specifications in hia
office now from which he could draw the
plans in short order. Furthermore, the
Mayor stated that the California Associa
tion of Civil Engineers had a regular
schedule of rates for such work, which
was 1 4-10 per cent of the cost of the
work for preparing plans and specifica
tions, and 4-10 of 1 per cent for the de
tails. The estimated cost of the work
contemplated was $60,000 at the outside,
and as the specifications were already
prepared, by allowing % of the 1 4-10 per
cent, together with the additional 4-10 of
1 per cent for details, would only bring
the cost of the work Tilton proposed to
do for $1400 up to $660.
Tilton's deputy, who was present, said
that his superior was the only person au
thorized to perform such work for the
city, -end intimated that unless the Sur
veyor's terms were acceded to the board
would have to get along without the
plans.
At Sullivan's request the committee de
ferred action on the veto for a week In or
der that the Mayor might have an ex
pert appear before the committee g and
give his opinion on the value of the work.
It may be of interest to the readers of

TALK OF PAVING
ANOTHER BLOCK
Market Street May Be
Bituminized to Golden
Gate Avenue.
Report of the Merchants' Asso
ciation Considered by the
Street Committee.
Proponed Blanket Contract for Repair
ing Accepted Streets for a Period
of Two Years.
The members of the Street Committee
of the Board of Supervisors announced
themselves yesterday as favoring the ex
tension of the bituminous pavement on
Market street to Golden Gate avenue.
The work now In contemplation provides
for bttumlnizing that thoroughfare from
Second to Fifth street, but at yester-
day's meeting Deputy Superintendent of
Streets Donovan appeared before the
committee and stated that his chief had
received a communication from President
King of the Merchants' Association, stat
ing that the association strongly favored
the paving of Market street with bitu-
men from the southeasterly line of Fifth
street to the southwesterly line of Sixth
street, which will extend the smooth
pavement to Golden Gate avenue. The
communication further recommended that
Fourth street, from Market to Mission,
also be paved with bitumen In view of the
fact that the Merchants' Association had
made a canvass of property owners in
the block and had received signatures
guaranteeing to pay half the cost of the
work. As Fourth street has been ac
cepted, the city will have to bear half
the cost. â 
The street committee received the re
port with decided favor and agreed to
recommend a resolution providing for the
work to the board. .
. The committee recommended the adop
tion of the proposal for bids for repair
ing and keeping in repair for a period of
two years all streets, crossings or por
tions of streets paved with bitumen. A
draft of the resolution, together with
specifications and a report from the
Street Department giving the total area
of streets and crossings now paved with i
bitumen at 13,185,849 square feet, was laid
before the committee, and after a few !
minor changes they were approved. The '
proposal provides that the contract shall i
extend for two years from â  the date , of .
award and all repairs must be maÂ£e 'in '
strict accordance with the specifications. :
All streets or portions of streets and
crossings paved with bitumen and accept
ed by , the city must be put In thorough
repair within three months. from the date
of the contract, in addition to such streets
as may be paved during the term of the !
contract' except such us: are covered by ;
a bond, and 'any abrasions or breaks that -,
may occur thereafter must be repaired
within forty-eight hours.
Bidders must state the specific sum for
which the entire work will be performed,
and -monthly payments will be made to !
the extent of. one twenty-fourth of the '
entire; amount. The specifications have
been, carefully prepared with the inten- ;

OFFICE DEPUTY MARSHALS
fudge Jaokaon of Weat Virginia Has
Decided In Their Favor, but His
Opinion Not Final.
There has been but little subsidence of
( the nutter caused by the announcement
i w in last Sunday's Issue of The Call that
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch had
accepted as his guide the opinion render- j
ed recently by United States : Circuit !
Judge Fltzpatrlck of New Jersey that I
deputies of internal revenue are not a j
part of the civil service system. In fact,
bo violent was the agitation in his office
the next day that Mr. Lynch walked into
â¢the main office, occupied by the clerks,
and made a little speech to them. In
â which he gave them the assurance that
clerks in the office of Collectors of In
ternal Revenue were not affected by the
. decision of Judge Fitzpatrick, that de
cision being applicable only to deputies.
'J -Since last Sunday Mr. Lynch has re
ceived a few applications for deputyships,
'some of the applications being from mem
bers of the Continental League, a sturdy
Republican organization and the pioneer
on this coast in the fight for the over
throw of the civil service system. At Its
meeting last Wednesday night the league
adopted resolutions reaffirming its devo
tion to the good old principle of rotation
In office and giving warning that it
would use the full force of its political!
Influence against any candidate for legis- i
lative office who would not give an un
qualified pledge to oppose the further ex
.tension and maintenance of the civil ser
vice system. In the person of the Conti
nental League Mr. Lynch has secured a
most powerful auxiliary. There can be
i â  no' doubt that plenty of good material
..will be available to fill all the vacancies
that the Collector may create in the ranks
of his division deputies. - . .
Other offices than that of the Collector
of Internal Revenue are threatened .by
the rotation-in-office invaders. One of
..these is the Deputy United States Mar
ehalship. Some time ago, shortly before
' Judge' Fitzpatrick rendered his now fa- I
.xnpus opinion. Judge Jackson of the Clr- ;
cuit Court of West Virginia enjoined !
â¢â United States Marshal Thompson from !
â¢removing Chief Office Deputy Priddle, '
who had been appointed by one of :
'â¢Thompson's predecessors. Priddie then
demanded salary, and on Marshal Thomp
i'Boti's refusal to sign the warrants Prid- i
V-dle entered suit against the United States ;
.â¢/to recover the salary due him under the
â "..decision of Judge Jackson.
.'â â  . In connection with this matter the fol- ',
â¢â¢ "lowing letter received by a Federal of- !
" lice holder in San Francisco from the
â¢Civil Service Department in Washington
â will be found of interest:
â¢'; The commission holds that while the exten
sion of the classified service to Include office
deputy marshals does not in any way extend
the term of office which may be provided for j
them by law, there is no law requiring a !
; marshal, on the other hand, to employ a new j
s Â«et of office deputies upon his assuming charge i
.. .of his office. If he does so, these positions â 
". being within the classified service, he must
take "eligibles" from the registers of the com

The commission is Informed that the case of

In his decision of June T. IS?7, the Comp
troller of the Treasury merely decided that the
term of office deputies ends with that of their
principal, except for the purposes named in
sections 759 and 790. Revised Statutes, and that
an office deputy marshal who continued to per
form duties as such under a marshal other
than the one who appointed him could not re
ceive compensation unless he were recommls
sloned and took a new oath.
In response to a resolution, introduced in the
Senate by Mr. Cullom, that heads of depart
ments be requested to inform the Senate what
positions in their respective departments, if
any. should, in their opinion. l>e token from
within the classified civil service, the late
Attorney-General made response that he con
sidered the position of office deputy marshal
improperly so included, and recommended that
It be taken out of the classified service. The
new Attorney-General has been reported to be
favorable to the retention of the position of
office deputy marshal in the classified service.
The letter and the favorable attitude of
the Attorney General of the United States,
taken in coniunction with the action of
Judge Jackson of West Virginia, make
the outlook somewhat brighter for office
deputy marshals, although they may
have no clearly defined and Incontestable
standing on the civil service platform.

The important business transacted at
the third session of the Grand Lodge of
the Ancient Order of United Workmen
yesterday was the election of grand
officers.
At the forenoon session the report of
the committee on extension was
adopted after all reference to the three
dollar bonus had been eliminated there
from.
Judge George H. Bahrs of the Super
ior Court of this city, who last year
was elected gTand overseer and was
promoted gTand foreman upon the
death of A. F. Mackay, was elected
grand master workman by acclamation.
In a few words he returned his
public as an artist, and not as a mere
infant prodigy, has resulted in the de
velopment of the natural talents with
which the little one is endowed.
In her brain everything finds musical
expression as naturally as other chil
dren embody their ideas in words. Her
compositions are quite natural, em
bodying in music the experience which
belongs to a strong, sunny young life
absolutely free from morbidness of any
kind.
Besides being able to master the diffi
cult compositions of such composers as
Mozart. Bach, Beethoven, Chopin,
Mendelssohn and Godard, she plays
many little compositions of her own,
the ideas which they express being like
herself, tender, pure and delicate.
There is, however, a great diversity
in her ideas, and her handling of
"Heimweh," concerto, and "Schmetter
ling," compositions of her own, show
unmistakable signs of genius.
Her phenomenal musical instinct al
ready responds to the requirements that
her brain will understand when she fs
more mature, and it fs intellectually as
well as musically satisfying to hear her
presentation of great composers. There
is nothing meaningless or maudlin in
Pr-loma's playing, her phrasing is
scholarly as well as artistic, and there
is no lack of vigor in her grasp of the
subject which she is trying to In
terpret. The little hands, that can
hardly stretch across the keyboard of
the piano, show no blurring or weak
ness in the execution of the most diffi

power to advance the order.
L. M. Manzer of this city and J. M.
Collins of Fresno were nominated for
grand foreman and the prize went to
Collins. J. Flint was elected grand
overseer.
The great contest of the day was the
election of a grand recorder to isuc
ceed D. S. Hirshberg. There were
placed in nomination Frank S. Poland
of Excelsior Lodge, who for twelve
years has been deputy grand master
workman; John Hoesch, recording sec
retary of Magnolia Lodge; J. M. Camp,
recording secretary of Valley Lodge;
J. Carr, and two others who were
nominated, but were dropped after the
first ballot.
There were necessary to a choice 183
votes. On the first ballot Poland re
ceived 135 votes, Hoesch 76, Camp 63,
Carr 55, other candidates 25. There
being no choice another ballot was ta
ken with the result that Poland re
ceived IS4 votes, Hoesch 76, Camp 47
and Carr 46. This gave Poland the of
fice by one more vote than was neces
sary and his election was loudly
cheered.
Sam Booth was nominated to succeed
himself as grand receiver, and he was
elected by acclamation.
Grand Medical Examiner Mayon was
nominated as his own successor, and
Dr. "W. P. Lawlor was nominated
against him. Before the ballot was
counted Dr. Lawlor withdrew and on
his motion the election of Dr. Mayon
was made unanimous.
Taylor Rogers, W. H. Jordan and
William Vinter were elected supreme
representatives, and C. F. Curry, Wil
liam Haukett and John Hoesch were
elected the finance committee.
C. S. Curtis was appointed grand
irside watchman, J. D. Nield grand out
side watchman and J. Popert grand
guide.
Mt. Hamilton Lodge of San Jose was
presented a silk banner for having ini
tiated the greatest number of candi
dates during the year. Past Supreme
Master Workman Jordan making the
presentation.
The grand officers were installed in
due form, after which there were a [
number of speeches of congratulation; I
then the Grand Lodge adjourned sine

The Degree of Honor.
The Grand Lodge of the Degree of i
Honor convened yesterday in Masonic
Hall, B. B. building. All the grand offl- !
cers were present, and the forty of the i
forty-five delegates were called to or
der by Grand Chief of Honor Mrs. N. I
J. Masters.
The superior chief of honor, Mrs. M. j
J. Steuart, entered the room and was <
accorded a seat to the right of the pre- j
siding officer.
' The reports of the several grand offi
cers were presented and referred to â¢
proper committees. These show that
the order has done exceedingly well
during the past year and that its pros
pects for the future are very bright.
The constitution of the Grand Lodge
of the Ancient Order of Workmen was
adopted as the constitution c.-f the j
Grand Lodge of the Degree of Honor,
so far as applicable.
During the afternoon, the fact that
Frank S. Poland, who is the husband of
Grand Recorder Mrs. Poland of the |
Degree of Honor, had been elected
grand recorder, vice Hirshberg. was
announced, and the announcement was
received with cheers loud and pro
longed.
Mrs. Evelyn F. Mayon will at the
election for grand officers, to be held
this forenoon, be chosen grand chief of
honor, this being promotion for her
from grand lady of honor. This is the
wife of Grand Medical Examiner Dr.
Mayon of Oakland, a member of Ivy â 
Lodge and a very enthusiastic worker
in the order.
Last evening Laurel Hall. In the Shiels i
building, was crowded to its limits by j
members of the order and of the Order j
of Workmen to witness the exemplifi- i
cation of the work of initiation by a j
team from Ivy Lodge of Oakland, the

"Please take the lead," says Chief

"Apres vous," says Coroner Hawkins
with his finest bow.
In the meantime a body lies in a
newly made gTave at Laurel Hill Ceme
tery that rumor says was put there
through the designs of an artful slayer.
Neither ofiicer desires to take the ini
tiative in ferreting out the causes that
made that fresh mound of earth in the
city of the dead.
Nearly two weeks ago Vidal Messa,
who was supposed to have considerable
property and money, was married to
Florentino Cervantes. The woman was
a notorious character on the Barbary
Coast and vulgar in the extreme. Cer
vantes was a young man of some re
finement. A week after the marriage
the woman was dead, and before the
body was cold the husband began a
scramble for the property the woman
left. The woman had long been a suf
ferer from asthma, but the illness that
preceded her death was only of a few
hours' duration. The body was rushed
to the grave, and by some means the
inquisitorial office of the Coroner was
avoided in the hurry to get at the prop
erty of the woman.
"I am waiting for Instructions from
Chief Lees," says Coroner Hawkins,
"before making an examination of the
body of Mrs. Vidal Cervantes, who died
about a week ago, and whose friends
believe her death was the result of a
crime. Detective Anthony, when he
notified me of the circumstances of her
death, asked me to wait until he should
complete his investigations as far as
he could then go before taking any
steps. I am still waiting."
"The Coroner knows his duty," says
Chief Lees. "He does not need to wait
for me to tell him to go ahead. The
Call has told him of many of the pecu
liar circumstances that give a mys
terious air to the death of the woman,
and it is his place and not mine to in

vestigate it. If a crime has been com
mitted in this case only the body and
the contents of the stomach can reveal
it, and he is the proper official to deter
mine that fact. He is a physician, and
he, by his professional knowledge,
could ascertain if the woman died other
than a natural death. It is his place
to ascertain that, and when he reports
to me then it is my time to act."
Coroner Hawkins says he has been
ready to go ahead with an investiga
tion ever since the case was called to
his attention. "The case was reported
to me," he said, "by Detective Anthony
about five days ago. The officer said
he was going to investigate it, and he
asked me to do nothing in the matter
until I heard from him. He gave the
impression that if anything was done
to arouse the suspicions of those whom
he suspected of committing a crime, if
one had been committed, it might inter
fere with his plan of probing the mys
tery. I promised to do nothing with the
body according to his request, but since
The Call gave publicity to the matter
I have been trying to get in communi
cation with Detective Anthony to find
out what I should do. I have so far
been unable to reach him."
"The certificate of death was not
presented to my office, though it should
have been, according to the law gov
erning such cases. Dr. Artigues was
called to attend her only a few hours
before she died."
Dr. Artigues, who attended the
woman, said he was called to prescribe
for the sick woman at about noon of
the day she died. He said he found the
patient suffering from asthma, and in
one of his prescriptions was a small
quantity of morphine. The patient was
directed to take that prescription every
i three hours until relieved. Each dose
as prescribed would only administer a
fifth of a grain of the morphine.
The directions were evidently not fol
lowed closely. The morphine was in
powder form, and the prescription when
it was filled called for ten powders.
| They were delivered to the woman less
> than twelve hours before she died. In
; that time eight of them were taken. If
! taken regularly that would mean a
! powder every hour and a half, or just
jas often again as was prescribed. In
', addition to the morphine in the pow
ders that were prescribed by the phy
sician the husband and the nurse of
the woman gave her several large doses
of a cherry pectoral, a patented medi
cine, that contained a large quantity
of opium. Between the two medicines
sufficient poison might have
been given the woman to cause death.
"I do not understand how it was that
the death certificate that I signed was
i not vised by the Coroner. I signed it
with the understanding that it was to
, go to that official, and I took the pre
! caution to write on the face of it that I
; had only attended the woman but a
i few hours before she died. At first I
refused to sign a certificate, but finally
agreed to do it, with the understanding
that the case should be reported to the
Coroner. Why it was not taken there
I do not know, nor can I tell how it was
passed by the Health Department with
; out some inquiries being made when I
was careful to call attention to the fact
that the woman had died without hav
ing the necessary medical attendance
as provided by law. I have no doubt
but that my diagnosis of the case was
right and that death was due to natural
causes, but at the same time the cir
currstance as told in The Call gives
good reason to believe that there might
be something wrong with the death r.J
the woman, and an investigation should
be reld."

Sec. 15. Said advertisement and no

person to put in a sham bid, or that
such other person shall refrain from
bidding: and has not in any manner

vantage against the City and County,
or any person interested in said Im
provement, for himself or any other
person. All bids shall be clearly and
distinctly written, without any era-sure

have power to relieve from or remit
such forfeiture.
Sec. IS. If at any time it shall be
found that the person to whom a con
tract has been awarded has, in
senting any bid or bids, colluded with
any other party or parties, for the pur
pose of preventing any other bid being
made, then the contract so awarded
shall be null and void, and the Board
shall advertise for a new contract for
said work.
Sec. 19. In the case of Improvement
of streets, the owners of the major part
of the frontage of lots and lands upon
the street whereon the work is to be

for said work, or, in the case of an
assessment district, the owners of a
major part of the superficial area em
braced in such district, or their agents,

that they are such owners, or the
agents of such owners, within ten days
after the first posting of notice of said
award, elect to take said work and en
ter into a written contract to do the
whole work at the price at which the

expense of the work and improvement
is to be assessed upon a district, im
mediately after the contractor has ful
filled his contract to the satisfaction
of the Board of Public Works, or to
the satisfaction of the Supervisors on
appeal, the Board of Public Works
shall proceed to estimate upon the
lands, lots, or portions of lots within
said assessment district, as shown by
the diagram provided for in section five
of this Chapter, the benefits arising
from such work, and to be received

Sec. 10. If at any time there shall be
any street work or improvement done,

before it passes a resolution of its in
tention to recommend the ordering of
said work or improvement, establish
by resolution a method by means of
which such assessment shall be made;
and on the completion of the work or
improvement to the satisfaction of said
Board, or to the satisfaction of the
Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex
pense thereof according to the jnethod

from and after the date of said record
inir of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons interested In paid
oast ;<sment shall be deemed to have no
tice r,t the contents of the record
tho:eof.
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall
be delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
until after the payment to the Board
of tho incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as

conti actor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re

jurfjrment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render suoh judg
ment, that any suit brought to foreclose
the lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, irregularity, or ille
gally, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to
any such assessment, or in the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with

final judgment, apply to the Board for
arolher assessment to be issued in con
formity to law; and the Board shall,
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make and deliver to
said applicant a new assessm3.nt, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots
of land set out therein for the period of
two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said lien as provided in this Chapter.
Should such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as
sessed, or their agents, if they can con
veniently be found, and demand pay
ment of the amount assessed to each.
If any payment be made, the contrac
tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same

of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons so assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is
stated as "unknown" upon the assess
ment, then said contractor or his as

behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return Indors
ed thereon, Bigned by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid In whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shall
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
I but no such payment so made after
I suit has been commenced shall operate,
i without the consent of the plaintiff in
I the action, as a complete discharge of
j the lien until the costs in the action
I shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
! ment upon the books of its office on
i the payment to It of the amount of the
j assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
! were Issued. If any contractor shall
j fail to return his warrant within the
j time and in the form provided in this
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon
which a return may be made "with the
same effect as if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
! all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate of seven

! and place of the hearing, briefly re
j ferring to the vvork contracted to be
done, or other subject of appeal, and
' to the acts, determinations or proceed
ings objected to or complained of, shall

tion direct the Board of Public Worka
I to correct the warrant, assessment or
diagram in any particular, or to make
and issue a new warrant, assessment
and diagram to conform to the deci
1 sions of the Supervisors in relation
thereto.
All the decisions and determinations
!of the Supervisors, upon notice and
| hearing as afrrresaid, shall be final and
' conclusive upon all persons entitled to
> appeal under the provisions of this
section, as to all errors, informalities
I and irregularities, which the Supervis
ors might have remedied and avoided;
and no assessment shall be held in
' valid, except upon appeal to the Su

' self, where the Board of Public Works
! has acquired Jurisdiction to make the
; same.
Sec. 15. At any time after the period
! of thirty-five days from the day of the
date of the warrant, or if an appeal
has been taken to the Supervisors, then,

lars in addition to the taxable costs,
as attorney's fees, but not any percent
age upon said recovery. When suit has
i been brought, after a personal demand

as attorney's fees in addition to all tax
i able costs, notwithstanding that the
â  suit may be settled or a tender be
| made before a recovery in said action,
i and he may have judgment therefor.
Said warrant, assessment and dia

such improvement requires the con
demnation of private property, and the
Board shall by resolution determine
that the improvement would be of pub
lic benefit, it shall make an estimate
of the expense of' such improvement,
and determine by resolution the district
which will be affected by, and should
be assessed for, the expense of such im
provement. No proceedings shall be
had upon the filing of such petition un
til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary
of the Board an amount of money
which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
the expense that may be incurred in
case the Supervisors shall not pass an
ordinance for said improvement.
Sec. 2. If within three months after
the passage of the resolution determin
ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district
who shall also be the owners of two
thirds of the superficial square feet of
the property included within said dis

said propertyâ including improvements
thereon â estimating said value accord
ing to the last preceding Assessment
Book of the City and County, shall
present to the Board a petition for said
Improvement, verified by their oaths
and describing the lands of which they
are the owners, and showing the
amount at which the same was as
sessed upon the last preceding Assess
ment Book of the City and County, and
stating that they are the owners and
in possession of the lands named in said
petition, the Board shall pass a reso
lution of its intention to recommend
such improvement to the Supervisors,
and shall in such resolution specify a
day upon which it will hear any ob
jections that may be made to such im
provement.

tention, the Board shall cause to be
prepared a map or diagram of the dis
trict affected by and to be assessed for
the expense of such improvement, upon
which shall be delineated the several
lots of land upon which said assess
ment is to be levied, and also the lots
of land which are to be taken for such
improvement, and showing the name of

riod of thirty days, non-judicial days
excepted, and shall also cause a copy

person whose name is delineated upon,

determine the sufficiency of any objec
tions which may have been filed.
Sec. 5. If the Board shall determine
that such objections are sufficient to
prevent a recommendation of the im
provement, it shall pass a resolution to
that effect, and no further proceedings
shall be had under said petition. If
no objections have been filed, or if the
Board shall determine that the objec
tions filed are insufficient, it may pass
a resolution recommending to the Su
pervisors said improvement, and in its
recommendation shall specially report
to the Supervisors whether in its opin
ion the land within the district speci
fied as affected by said improvement
will be benefited to the extent of the
expense of said improvement.
Sec. 6. If the Board shall pass a
resolution recommending said improve
ment, the Secretary shall forthwith,
transmit to the Clerk of the Supervis-
Qrs a copy of said resolution, together
with the petition, map, estimate of the
expense of said Improvement, and any
objections that may have been filed,
and the Supervisors shall at their first
regular, meeting thereafter, or at any
meeting to which said hearing may

rules herein prescribed, as to said Su
pervisors shall seem expedient. Upon
the passage of said ordinance the Clerk
of the Supervisors shall transmit a cer
tified copy thereof to the Board of Public
Works.
Sec. 7. Upon the receipt by the
Board of a certified copy of said ordi
nance the Board shall cause to be
made an accurate survey of the con
templated improvement, and a map
thereof, upon which shall be deline
ated each and every lot of land to be
taken or appropriated for the purposes
of the intended improvement, showing

each and every lot of land within the
district determined to be affected by,
and which is to be assessed for, the
cost and expense of said improvement.
After said survey and map are made,
the Board shall pass a resolution fix
ing a day on or after which it will pro
ceed to value the several lots of land
to be taken for the purpose of the in
tended improvement, and ascertain
and determine the damages and bene
fits which may result therefrom.
The Secretary of the Board shall
cause said resolution to be published
for a period of ten days before the day
fixed in said resolution for proceeding
to make said valuation.

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as tho
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
co&t of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal Indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as. herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition,
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors Bhall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter Into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
j late such a proposition for submission
| to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
i osition shall be so formulated and com
i pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
! of the Supervisors must, Immediately
j upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
I or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
i tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the .two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast in favor of both
1718
propositions shall not exceed one-half J
the total number of votes cast thereon, :
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section shall be so j
construed as to prohibit the Supervis- j
ors from responding to the aforesaid j
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission j
of propositions to the electors as afore- I
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same as. ;
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac- ;
quire the same in the manner herein- [
after provided. ...
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the city ;
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma- .
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms. \
In case, however, the cost of such (
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon,' and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the '
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con- â 
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which ,
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the .
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects ,
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es- !
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
Of the same, and that bonds of the City

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 7â The conviction Is evi
dently unaltered In Wall street that the delay
in presenting the President's message to Con
gress adds to the possibilities of a peaceful
solution of the Cuban question. The market
closed a shade lower to-day In the average
price. Individual losses were in almost all
classes confined to fractions and there is a
fair sprinkling of gains among leading stocks.
Only a small proportion of the sharp advance
was caused by the news that the message was
to be delayed until Monday. The professional
bears showed no disposition to renew their
short contracts. Neither was there any sign
of liquidation of long holdings until the only
buying In them was caused by some slight cov
ering of shorts and a very limited amount of
commercial buying.' The result was an almost
stagnant market. Th/Â»re was \no â¢ develop
ment to-day which awakened from its lethar
gic condition. That this dullness Is due to an
attitude of waiting was evident from the sud
den activity when It became known yesterday
that the President's message would be delayed
and wh.en it was supposed that the delay indi
cated probable concession by the Madrid Gov
ernment. The public impression on Wall street
la that the undertone of firmness in the mar
ket is due to some hidden motive, generally
supposed to be the expectation that Spain will
yield to pressure from the European powers
and from the Pope and will | concede the de
mands of the United States.
There was, however, a demonstration In yes
terday's late bulge that large offerings to real
ize are brought out by, any sharp advance in
prices. Professional operators on either side
are waiting for the definite development of the
situation. It Is thought possible that the â  li
quidation usually, incident to a war scare is
waiting for the expected heavy demand from
the large short Interest which undoubtedly ex
ists in the market. This short Interest Is wait
ing for an actual declaration of war to cover.
On thÂ« other hand there are those who hold
that actual war has already been sufficiently
discounted and that the firmness In the mar
ket is due to this cause. . , â¢ â¢ -. :- â â -
The situation .In the money market is felt
to be one fortified against even a severe shock.
Bonk reserves all over- the country have been
greatly strengthened. The gold reserve both of
the Government and the New York banks is
large unprecedentedly; so In the case of .the
latter and Is constantly growing. A large pro
portion of the payments at the customh ouse
are made In gold and ( the. clearing house bal
ances are In great part settled .in the same
metal There Is no immediate prospect of In
tcTTuft'lonal .exchanges turning against- the
United States and unless this .occurs there
ought to be gold, imports to replenish the
money market. To-day's advance in the Bank
of England rate did not check the engagements
of gold but nerved to shift the demand from
London -to Berlin. The rise In money In Lon
don resulted In â¢ a rise in the Berlin and Paris
rate of exchange on. London. 'Â»â¢â¢"â "â

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 7.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The j mar
kets opened firmer to-day on the better pros
pect of the Spanish situation. : While in view
of all the circumstances, Americans were bet
ter, but they were left alone, and of course will
not be traded -in 'luring the intervening holiday*
until Tuesday ! morning.' Spanish j '4s, * â  which
closed last night at 47Vs, opened to-day at BtH'i
and closed about 4Si4. . Americans, after a re
action at midday, closed neatly at the best. .
' The rise in the Bank of England rate is fully
justified by the figures of the weekly return.
Ordinarily the first bank return for the March
quarter shows a larce return of cash from
circulation,' but this tendency is checked for
the moment by the Easter holiday demands for
cash. The return Is the weakest for some
years. .

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 7.â A continuance of the
weakness which became so marked during yes
terday's session, marked the opening: in Wheat
to-day, July, which closed yesterday at 84%@
81c, ranging all the way from 84%e to 84Hc.
Nearly, everything was against the price at
the start. The Michigan crop report was, per
haps, the most important factor. : That report
gave the Wheat condition at 96, the highest
April figure since 1891. Liverpool showed a de
cline of about %d, and , Continental markets
were equally weak. The fear of damage to
winter Wheat by frosts which has hovered over
the market for several days was effectually dis
sipated â¢by I the higher temperatures now pre
vailing throughout the West. About the only
crumb of comfort the bulls were given were
the figures on the Northwest receipts, I which
showed a considerable failing oft. There waa
some scattered ; buying at. the start by local
shorts, and scalpers were satisfied , with small
profits, but . the majority of traders were on
the selling side. Liquidation by scared longs
was quite marked for a time. For nearly two
hours the course of the market was steadily
downward, â  varied occasionally by small farc
tlonal rallies as shorts came Into cover. About
11:30 o'clock the bad crop â â¢ reports ; from Cali
fornia which had been coming In all morning
began to have some effect on the market. The
condition there, as a result of the cold and
drouth, -was said to be very grave, I ' some re
ports placing the crop condition at not dyer 10
per cent. â¢â¢-â .â â¢
The : effects of these . reports , was somewhat
nullified by heavy i rains ;in -California during
the past forty-eight hours, but the decline was
stopped and an appearance of steadiness given
the market. â â â 'â  July had â  previously â¢ Bold as low
as S3%c, but it rallied to S3 T tiC and for the rest
of the session kept- close to that : price. -: Trad
ing became. excessively dull late In the session'
and the pit at times was _ not â¢ more than half
filled: . : Although the local , markets will be open
to-morrow, the closing of the Continental mar
kets over the Easter; holidays had a tendency
to narrow the trading : here, ' and It finally de
generated into a more narrow scalping trade-.
The close wu steady at BJ%o tor will/. '>'-
Corn was easy. Influenced by Wheat. May
closed 4c lower;
Trade In Oats was small, moderate offerings
being taken very slowly: May clesed ViS'/ic
lower.
Provisions were weak, partly with grain and
partly on lower hog prices. There was some
recovery near the close on covering. May pork
closed 7Vjc lower. May lard 74c lower and
May ribs 5c lower.

LIMA BEANS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, April 7.â The Journal of Com
merce says: Within the past week or ten days
there has been a sharp upward movement. In
the price of California dried Lima beans, both
on the coast and in this market, based on re
ports that a smaller acreage will be given to
Li mas this year and that the exceptionally dry
weather in California would, even In the event
that all of the ground heretofore devoted to
Ltmas were. to be utilized for that crop, pre
vent an output at all approaching in size that
of the past few years. In some quarters It is
fntimated that the reduction of acreage plant
ed In Limas is not so much due to unfavorable
weather conditions as to the fact that the sup
ply for several seasons has been greater than
the demand, notwithstanding the enlargement
of the export trade, and has necessitated sales
at a loss to producers. Stocks in New York
are now said to be In the hands of a few par
ties and it is rumored that they contemplate
forming a syndicate to absolutely control the
market in view of the fact that Interior buy
ers who have heretofore gone to the coast are
now seeking supplies hero, since this is the
cheaper market. Philadelphia parties, it is un
derstood, have been taking up everything- they
could find at a shade under quotations, and
are now believed to have control of a very
large proportion of the available supply of
si*ot goods in the East.

AMERICA'S VAST RESOURCES.
Some Idea of the almost unlimited
resources of this country may be ob
tained from the abundance In which
only six of its mineral products are
found, viz.: Coal, Iron, gold, copper, pe
troleum and silver. The figures giving
the total output of these mineral pro
ducts for the past year are not availa
ble, for the year 1896 the figures are
as follows: Coal, $209,982,718; iron, $87,
688.620; gold, $57,000,000; copper, $48 -
786,080; petroleum, $42,162,184, and silver,
$30,461,666. What country on the globe
can surpass the aggregate showing
which the foregoing figures present? Of
course some countries may fonre ahead
of the United States in the abundance
of some one or more particular mineral
products which they possess, but in the
aggregate they must necessarily fall
far short. But as yet, the mineral
wealth of the United States is only par
tially developed; the future alone can
reveal the contents of our hidden treas
ures. â Atlanta Constitution.

LOCKED IN
A FURNITURE
FACTORY
Peculiar Predicament
of Mrs. John
Kreling.
Made a Prisoner by Her
Determined Father
in-Law.
The Latter and His Son Arrest
ed for Using Vulgar
Language.
A POLICEMAN'S PLrGHT.
Albert Snyder Also Chnrged With
Assaulting the. Old
Man.
The relatives of John Kreling, who
died several years ago, seem determined
to parade the far ly skeleton in public.
Last night Martin Kreling and his son
William were arrested by Detectives
Fitzgerald and Graham and charged
With vulgar language. The complain
ing vitness is Albert Snyder, a friend
of Mrs. John Kreling. Synder also has
a charge of battery per. ling against
him in Judge Campbell's court.
The alleged offense against the Kre
lings was committed last Wednesday.
Thinking that her father-in-law in
tended to beat her out of the furniture
factory, which, she claims, belongs to
her, Mrs. Kreling, accompanied by her
father, started to take possession.
Fearing that Kreling would not hesi
tate to resort to violence, they decided
to enlist the sympathies of Policeman
flattery. Alter listening to their story
Slattery consented to "hold the fort"
with them. While he was admiring the
.furniture in the factory- Kreling Sr.
appeared cm the scene, and, finding the
door locked from the inside, he rapped
for admittance.
Failing to induce them to allow him
to enter, Kreling went to the nearest
hardware store and purchased a pad
lock. He then returned to the factory
and placed the lock on the door. The
noise attracted the attention of Police
man Slattery and he proceeded to in
vestigate. To his surprise he found the
door locked from the outside, and real
izing he was a prisoner he lustily blew
his whistle in the hope of attracting
the attention of one of his fellow offi
cers. Mrs. Kreling became furious
when she learned of the trick and
swore vengeance against her father-in- j
law.
While the trio were discussing their
predicament a lively battle was in pro
gress only a short distance away. The
participants were Kreling Sr., his son
William and Snyder. According to the
latter's statement the father and son
assailed him with vile epithets and
in retaliation he smote the old man on
the nose, knocking him into the street.
After the encounter Snyder walked
away and as he passed the furni<ure
factory he caught a glimpse of Mrs.
K rel ing's tear-stained face in one of the
windows.
"For God's sake, Albert," she plead
ed, "get us out of here. We are looKe.l
in and I fear that the poor policeman
who is with us may lose his place if he
is held a prisoner much longer."
Snyder lost no time in procuring a
crowbar, which he used in removing
the padlock. The trio were then re
leased, much to the relief of the police
man.
To-day the cases will be heard, and a
lively time is expected.
THE FIRST MURMUR.
Strikers Are Objecting to Methods
Used by the Typothetae.
While the position of the striking print
ers remains practically unchanged, the
first murmur of discontent from the strik
ers at the actions of the employers
was heard yesterday from President
Hawkcs. "We have hardly begun to do
any aggressive work as yet," he said.
"and have held back from doing so, as
there is a kind of unspoken agreement
to the effect that no efforts will be made
to permanently fill the positions vacated
by our men until next week, and we pre
fer to wait until that time before showing
our hand. There is one thing, however,
against which I think we have good rea
son to protest. This city, as everybody
knows, is full of idle ren of all callings.
The typothetae have brought men from
out of town to fill the strikers' places. A
short triaj showed many of these to be
hopelessly incompetent, and now we have
them coming to our headquarters penni
less, away from home and applying foi
assistance. They all tell the same tale.
They came to San Francisco in answer
to advertisi-ments for help, and being un
accustomed to the conditions existing in
a large office were turned out after a
brief trial. Now they apply to us for
enough money to take them out of the
city, but we have no funds set apart for
that purpose and must either assist them
out of our private purses in answer to the
appeal of Buffering humanity or turn
them away hungry and penniless to drift
about In a strange city. We think this ia
wrong. If the typothetae brin.es incompe
tent men here it should feel bound to aÂ«^
sist them to- a certain extent at least. \\H
have drawn but very little on the Strike
fund so far, in fact, up to date our .'x
penses have been something less than
$15. but as we expect to begin paying
Utrlke benefits next week, of course ouz
bills will be a little higher; but we have
abundant funds to draw from."
The employers feel fully a." confident of
ultimate success as the union men. "I
have twenty-live men at work." said
Walter N. Brunt yesterday afternoon,
"and am getting all my work out as us
ual. Some of the men I put on wen- in
competents and I was obliged to get rid
of thorn, but others are first-clasp m< n.
I had been sifting for yean to get good
workmen who were members of the
union, but now that they have left me be
cause I would not accede to their de
mands, I am ready to go through the sift
ing process over again. If any of tin- oW
hands are anxious to come back and theli
places are not already tilled, 1 am per
fectly willing to take them, but they
can't < xpeet ten Hours' pay for nine

HUNTINGTON HIS
OWN SUCCESSOR
Southern Pacific Directors Elect
Officers for the Ensuing
Year.
General Manager Kruttsehnitt Made
Fourth Vice- President, Other
â wise No Changes Occur.
The board of directors of the Southern
Pacific Company met yesterday to elect
officers, and, as was expected, the elec
tion resulted in the selection of C.
P. Huntington as president and the re
election of all the 'old officers to the po
sitions they have filled for the past year.
The only change in the whole executive
staff v.;is the appointment of General
Manager Julius Kruttsehnitt to the
fourth vice-presidency, which place was
left vacant by the death of A. N. Towne.
When the meeting was first called to
order T. E. Stillman occupied the chair
temporarily and E. C. Wright acted as
secretary. The first nomination was
Thomas H. Hubbard for president It was
made and seconded hy Charles Lathrop
and Russel J. Wilson, who represent the
Stanford interest, and who proposed the
name of Mr. Hubbard, not with the hope
that he would be elected, but to express
the antagonism of the Stanford faction to
Huntington. Then the name of C. P.
Huntingdon was placed before the board
and the matter was voted upon, with the
result that Huntington was elected by a
majority of seven. Nine of the directors
including George Crocker and C. B Green
who fills the place of Will Crocker while
that gentleman is absent, voted for Hunt
ington, and the only votes for Hubbard
were the two cast by the gentlemen who
proposed and seconded his nomination.
Following the election of the president
came the elections of thr> oth.-r officers
which resulted as follows: Thomas h'
Hubbard, first vice-president; George
Crocker, second vice-president; J c
Stubbs, third vice-president; Julius Krutt
sehnitt, fourth vice-president; N T
Smith, treasurer; E. C. Wright, secre
tary; F. H. Davis, assistant secretary
and treasurer in New York; Charles H.
Keddir.gton, assistant secretary and
treasurer in San Francisco, and C F
Krebs, assistant secretary in Kentucky
William Mohl was re-elected comptroller
iii New York and William Hood was re
elected chief engineer.
A resolution was passed continuing all
the minor officers in the positions they
r;t present occupy, and. after ratifying
the appointment of C. W. Beln, who"had
been appointed traffic manager of the
Atlantic system, the meeting adjourned
until next Thursday, when the regular
weekly meeting of the directors will be
held.

â¢ THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 1898.
MASONS TO HELP
THE HELPLESS
Plans for the Decoto Wid
ows' and Orphans'
Home.
Arrangements for the Big Fes
tival to Be Held In
May.
It Will Bo Their First Public Enter
tainmentâThe Reasons for
It All.
Among Masons, second only to the
question, "What will Congress do with
; Spain," is the subject of the coming
i festival in aid of the Decoto Home. It
has taken hold of the lodges like fire
â  in a box factory, and there is not one
! who does not filch at least an hour
â  from his own business to help the cause
, along, or failing a chance at that to
talk about it to every brother Mason
he meets.
For twenty years the question of
properly caring for the indigent
widows and orphans of Masons, and
also aged and infirm Masons, has been
agitated at every meeting of the Grand
, Lodge. Now, when the project is so
near completion, .Â».nd only the funds
which are sure to come from the festi
val are needed to open the doors, the
enthusiasm of aP those years seems to
have found a vent, and that the affair
will be a memorable success is as sure
as sunrise.
The project first took definite form
when the grand lodge of 1891 appointed
a board of nine trustees, with Past
Grand Master Edward Mevers Preston
as chairman, to select a site and pre
pare plans for the home so long talked
of. Out of about twenty offered the
board selected a site at Decoto â a tract
of 2(58 acres, three milea this side of
Niles, for which was paid $34,000. Plans
for a building to accommodate one hun
dred inmates were agreed upon and
during the session of the grand lodge
in 18% the corner stone was laid.
Since then over $15,000 has been spent
on the site and there is money enough
on hand to complete the home as orig
inally planned. But more Is needed, it
has been found, than a building to ac
commodate one hundred, and it is for
this reason and to assist in keeping it
j going that the festival has been
; planned.
The principles upon which the home
I will be run have been tested and found
i successful beyond expectations in nine
j States. One of the tenets of the Ma
; sonic creed is an injunction to care for
the widows and children of deceased
: members, and in this State it is being
j done by the various lodges. It has
! been found, however, that the best way
| is to establish lust such a home as is
being erected at Decoto. The home will
; be run by a board of trustees appoint
ed by the Grand Lodge, and candidates
for admission must be approved by the
board before being installed. The only
I general restriction is that they must be
i relatives of Masons in full standing.
In preparing for the co: ring celebra
! tion out of town lodges are talcing more
i than an active part, and their activity
is shown in applications for space on
the Pavilion Moor for booths and in do
nations of cash. Here in San Francisco,
since the tickets have been issued, a
! good Mason may be known by his
i bulging pockets, for every one of them
! carries bunches of the little paste
! boards, and the sales are no more ac
i tive than the salesmen. Before two
! more days are past the tickets will be
' on sale by all the prominent merchants.
Judge Carroll Cook is among those
with a scheme to help the festival and
I in this he represents Excelsior Lodge
No. 156, of which he is worshipful mas
| ter. The scheme is to have an Ameri-
I can booth, where the ladies in charge
j will all be dressed in the national colors
j and where everything American will be
j seen and some things will be sold.
i There will be a picture of George
Washington, for which the fa
ther of his country sat himself; a lock
of Andrew Jackson's hair and letters
he wrote; some of Washington's letters;
I battle flags; a clock which belonged to
j John Hancock; speeches by President
! McKinley â by phonograph if he can
i not be there himself, and a host of
I other things. The executive committee
In charge of the plans of Excelsior
Lodge is as follows: S. H., Dan
iels, chairman; Frank W. Sumner,
Wendell Easton, Robert Mitchell and
C. P. Overton. The present com
! mlttee consists of A. E. .Buckingham,
Dr. E. R. Bryant, C. H. Bryan, Wil
liam Cluff, John G. Conrad, E. B. Cut
ter, F. P. Deering, L. L. Dorr, W. A.
Halstead, J. K. C. Hobbs, Arthur W.
I Morse, Dr. John F. Morse, S. M. Short
! ridge, Theodore F. Smith, H. J. Owen,
F. H. Titus, A. H. Vail, Willis T. Per
kins, J. H. Suydam and Aaron Dowd.
Mrs. W. Frank Pierce, in charge of
renting floor space, says she has re-
I ceived so many applications that it is
i probable the entire Pavilion must be
ut*d, instead of only the lower floor,
as was at first intended.
So far the cit" merchants have do
nated nearly $12,000 worth of goods, to
be sold at the festival, and the lodges
are ordering tickets in a way to make
a second issue seem probable. Floor
space is at a premium, and when May
9 arrives the Masons will have nothing
to do but celebrate. This will be thdr
first public entertainment, and they are
determined to make it worthy of the
J order.
THE DEATH OF
THE SAVIOR
Good Friday Will Be Sol
emnly Commemor
ated To-Day.
Prayer Will Take the Place of
the Celebration of
Mass.
Special Services In the Protestant
Churchesâ The Jewish
Passover.
The church bells have ceased to ring;
the veiled statues and sacred effigies in
the churches nave assumed a presence of
somber silence, and a cloak of sorrow and
of devotion has been thrown over the
minds of Christendom. For this is the
day Christ, the Savior, gave up his life
in human sacrifice for those of the world
whom he calls his children.
The metal tongues in the steeples have
ceased to communicate their words of
welcome and admonition, and silence aflt!
devotion will mark the passing 01 Vood
Friday, the greatest and a'L vie same
time the most sorrowful event in the
Christian church.
Devotional services will take the place
of the solemnization of mass in che
Catholic churches during the morning,
and instead of the observance of vespers
and benediction, the evening services will
consist simply of the saying of the rosary
and a sermon upon the subject of "The
I'assion."
During the course of the afternoon the
sacred crucifix will remain placed upon a
cushion on the aftlV steps, immediately
in front and loading to the main aliar,
for the purpose of allowing the faithful
and the penitent the privilege of ktagng
the sacred wounds of fhe Savior in efTfjiy.
At nearly all the Catholic churched a
sermon on "The Passion" will be preached
this evening, and will constitute ihc
pnnlcpal religious evening instruction.
Holy Thursday was sbserved with sol
emn ceremony, and in nearly all the
churches solemn high mass was celebrai
ed in commemoration of the day. The
principal rite, however, was performed
within the walls of St. Mary's Cathedral
by the Archbishop, who, after ..ie celebra
tion of mass, consecrated the sacred oils
used in administering the various sacra
ments. The oils which upon this occasion
are consecrated are used for various pur
poses, and are of three kindsâ the oil of
the sick, Chrism and tne oil of the cate
chumens. These oils are used in the
ceremonies of baptism, as well as in the
preparation of baptismal water; in con
firmation; at ...e consecration of a
Bishop and likewise of churcnes, altars
and chalices and in the consecration of
church bells.
Archbishop Riordan acted as celebrant
of the mass which preceded the consecra
tion Of the oils, and was assisted by Rev.
C. A. Ranun as deacon and E. P. bemp
sey as sub-deacon. The Rev. J. McQuade
and father Mulligan acted as masters of
ceremony. Representatives from many of
the catholic churches in the city were in
attendance and occupied seats in the
sanctuary.
Special exercises will be held at the
first Lutheran Church, on Gough and
Octavia streets, in honor of Good Friday,
the morning service commencing at 11
o clock. The Rev. E. E. Nelander, D.D.,
the pastor, will deliver a sermon on the
subject of "Before the Cross. 1 '
The following music by the choir will
be included in the service: Solo, "O All
Ye Who Pass By the Way," Th. Dubois;
anthem, "Now From the Sixth Hour,"
Dudley Buck; anthem. "O Saving Vic
tim," Ch. Gounod; anthem, "For Us the
Christ Is Made a Victim Availing," Ch.
Gounod; solo, "By Jesus' Grave," John
Farmer.
Religious exercises in commemoration
of the day will also be held at St. Igna
tius Church. The music for the servicu
tins afternoon, called the "Three Hours
of Agony," will be of a selected nature
and of unusual merit. The introduction
to the "Stabat Mater" and "Pro Pecates,"
Rossini, will be rendered by the male
choir, assisted by the Ladies' Sodality.
While the Christians throughout the en
tire world are mourning the death of the
Savior the Jews likewise are fasting and
praying, but for another purposeâ the
sacred feast of the Passover. This cele
bration began last Tuesday evening and
wnl continue for eight days.
The celebration of the Passover is be
ing strictly adhered to in the Jewish
synagogues throughout the city. *The an
nual festival commenced at sunset Tues
day evening and will continue for eight
days. The annual Passover, or festival,
as it is called. Is symbolical of the deliver
ance of the Israelites from Egyptian
bondage, and is participated in by all or
thodox Jews. The last two of the eight
days will be set apart for prayer, wor
ship and thanksgiving. On these two
days, the most sacred in the Jewish cel
endar, labor and the pursuance of busi
ness are discontinued and the faithful as
semble either in their homes or the syn
agogue and devote their time in atoning
for the transgressions of the past yea.-.
All the culinary utensils, crockery,
china, glass and tableware are stored

in their stead during the entire festival.
Every crumb of bread was swept from
the Jewish home Wednesday morning and
preparations made for the spreading of
the annual Sedar feast.
The religious service in every orthodox
Jewish home Wednesday evening con
sisted of the reading of the narrative of
the Exodus, singing of the "Hagadah"
and recital of the hymns of Hilael, the
Jewish prophet.
During the Passover no bread but the
unleavened matzo is eaten and yester
day the first male child in every family

the first-born male rom the wrath of
God when the Egyptian first born were
slain.
