RUMORS OF THE

T^ONDQN, Jan. I.â The usml quiet of I
New : Year's day was disturbed yester
day afternoon by a' report- that Prince '
. Bismarck was ; dead. This rumor, so
emphatically made by th* Evening â¢
News and shouted .throughout Lbnd&h

great excitement in the newspaper

The actual source .of the report is
[not known, but the rumor was readily
j credited in view of the fact that the
ex-Chancellor has for the past fort
: night been failing. .. â¢
Inquiries made by both telegraph
and telephone have elicited the reas
suring statement that the Prince is
alive and there is no reason to believe
| that his condition is any worse to-day
I than it has been of late. A dispat< h
! from Hamburg says the rumor of Bte-
I rnank's death originated in Berlin and
â¢ was received in Hamburg with â eeptl
i clsm, which inquiry at Fridrichsruhe
proved to be justified. There is no
doubt that Prince Bismarck's health
has been rudely shaken in tha last
few days, owing to hiÂ« insomnia, which
is. due to .want of open air exercise and
the agony which he Buffefs r from the
gout. ';â ;-. .y: : ; ]' â  : - C''^ :/ /.

FOR KILLING
HIS MOTHER

LYNCHERS WERE READY.
Prepared to Execute the Murderer in
Case of Another Disagreement :
by the Jury.
SpÂ«ctal Diipatch to ThÂ« CmlL
LIBERTY. Mo., Jan. Iâ This after
noon the jury in the trial of William
Fnley for the murder of his sister and
mother, after being out two hours and
foTty minutes, returned a verdict of
murder in the first degree.
After the verdict had been read.
Judge Broaddus sentenced Foley to be
hanged Friday, February 8.
When Foley was brought into the
courtroom to hear his fate his face
was ashen; but his features wore the
sullen look that he had worn during
the latter part of the trial. An almost
imperceptible shake of the head was
Foley's only reply when asked if he
had anything to say why sentence
should not be passed upon him. Then
Judge Broaddus proceeded to deliver a
most scathing arraignment, while the
prisoner nervously wiped the perspira
tion from his brow.
! "At your first trial." said the Judge,
"I had. very grave doubts of your guilt,
f but -on: the secqrid. they were swept

Chinese Government Very Much
Alarmed at the Sudden Turn
Affairs Have Ta^en for
the Worse.
GERMANY'S
EMBASSADOR
MAY LEAVE
PEKING, Jan. I.â The
German missionaries at Tsao-
Chow, province of Shantung,
having reported to Baron
Heyking, the German Em
bassador at Peking, that the
commandant at China's gar
rison of the town had used
strong language to, or of
them, Baron Heyking at
once demanded that the com
mandant be dismissed, and
that a copy of the Tsung-Li-
Yamen's telegram of dis
missal be presented to him
by 6 o'clock Thursday even
ing. The Tsung-Li-Yamen
requested the Embassador
fci grant them until 8 o'clock.
Baron Heyking thereupon de
termined to leave Peking,
but is still h^re. The Gov
ernment is alarmed.
LONDON, Jan. 1. â It Is announced
at the Admiralty that H. M. S. Cen
turion, the flagship of the China sta
tion, and the Undaunted. Nareissius,
Pique, Rainbow, Daphne and Algerine
have arrived at Chemulpo, and the
Immortal and Iplrigenia at Port Ar
thur.
BERLIN, Jan. I.â Germany, in the
spring, will commence improving the
harbor of Kiaochau and will construct
docks and wharves and strengthen the
forts materially. Krupp ordnance of
large caliber has been ordered and dur
ing the winter a large quantity of mili
tary supplies will be sent to China.
Some of the best artillery and engineer
officers have volunteered to go to Kiao
chau.
In official circles it is not believed
Great Britain or any other power will
interfere with Germany's plans. It is
said the entente with Russia and
France is perfected, and that France
will soon force China to grant her fur
ther compensation on her southern
frontier. It is also learned from an ex
cellent source that there is no inten
tion on the part of either Kussia. Ger
many or France to place obstacles in
Great Britain's way if she feels in
clined to seize the present opportunity
of strengthening her position and inter
ests in China, from Shanghai south.
Bishop Anzer of South Shantung,
China, dined with the Emperor and
Empress at the new palace on Tuesday.
Baron yon Bulow, the minister for for
eign affairs, and Count yon Leyden,
the new minister of Japan, were pres
ent. On the following day the cor
respondent of the Associated Press had
an interview with the bishop, to whose
shrewd advice and detailed informa
tion regarding the whole province of
Shantung, in which Kiaochau is situ
ated, the German government owes
much. Bishop Anzer gave an interest
ing account of the occurrences of the
previous evening and of the audience
he was accorded by the Emperor in
November, and also told of his audi
ence with the Pope a fortnight ago.
The bishop, who has been thirty-four
years in China, and who is about to
return, said: "I am amazed at the
keen knowledge the Emperor dis
played regarding China, its resources
and government. Every question the
Emperor asked was pointed. There is
no dnubt Germany means to keep
Kiu'uhau and its contiguous territory;
and, if the right measures are taken it
will prove a most valuable possession,
even more valuable than Hongkong,
because its mineral wealth, coal and
iron, although needing a large amount
of capital to develop it, Is almost in
exhaustible."
The Emperor told the Bishop that
steps were under way to give thorough
German administration to the com
mercial advantages of Kiaochau. The
best expert judgment would be taken
on Â«very step proposed. Already meas
ures have been inaugurated to interest
private German capital. Three large
companies are forming in Berlin and
Cologne for this purpose, and the
Deutsche Bank is identified with sev
eral large plans in this direction.
Relative to his audience with the Pope
Bishop Anzer said his holiness highly j
PRICE FIVE CEXTS.
â - â¢ â  â 
approved of the energy shown by Ger
many in the gigantic task of opening
China and preparing her for the bles
sings of Christianity and civilization.
The Pope also expressed the opinion
that speedy penalty would be meted
out to China for the last mission mur
ders, which would "strike wholesome
terrors into the breast of its heathen
Government."
The Pope charged Bishop Anzer to'
convey his cordial greetings and wishes
to the Emperor, expressing the hope
that the further measures to be taken
by Germany in China would be
crowned with success, as Germany's
mission was arousing the sympathetic
interest of all Christendom.
His holiness touched on the question
of a German protectorate over the
Catholic missions in China, hitherto
considered to be in the hands of
France, and the Pope further inti
mated that instructions .had recently
been sent to the Bishops and higher
clergy of Germany to shape their con
duct in regard to the Chinese expedi
tion and the enlargement of the Ger
man navy, in consonance with the
views of the Vatican on these matters.
The Emperor decorated Bishop An
zer with the Order of the Red Eagle
and Regent Luitpold of Bavaria also
bestowed a decoration upon him.

Ready to Act, but Content to Wait and See
Whether Russia Will Keep Faith and

LONDON, Jan. I.â The Admiralty
to-day issued an official denial of in*,
reports that three of the Empress
steamers have been requisitioned by
the Admiralty, and also officially de
nied the statement that the naval re
serve of the China station had been
called out.
The ingenuity displayed in manu
facturing news from the far east is
remarkable. Five-sixths of the state
ments can be safely labeled guess
work. The British and Russian for
eign offices are as dumb as oysters,
and the German stream of conflicting
communications in the semi-official
press shows they do not know which
foot they are standing on. France is
apparently in the dark, while the
Mikudc has dissolved the Japanese
Diet, in order that opinions should not
be expressed. Under the circum
stances it is not strange that accurate
information is difficult to secure.
The known facts wholly corrobor
ated the statements cabled on Satur
day last that Great Britain is care
fully watching the situation, biding
her time, and will not fail to act
promptly and vigorously at the proper
l lonuTt.
It was pointed out In that dispatch
that in well-informed circles the scare
in the newspapers in regard to the
East was at least premature, and
that the members of the Government
were evidently sincere in disclaiming
the least alarm. This view of the
case was practically reiterated by the
Daily Graphic on Friday, which as
serted that there was every reason to
believe the Russians would adhere to
their pledge to evacuate Port Arthur
at the end of the winter, and that
therefore there was no grounds for
rornplaint on the part of Great Britain.
The Daily Graphic further pointed out
that the British Government did not
regard the occupation of Kiaochau by
the Germans as calling for action be
cause British interests were not
threatened. Both the foreign office
and the Admiralty, according to the
Daily Graphic, were agreed on this
point.
Evidently, apart from the question
of the Chinese loan, the Korean ques
tion i 3 more interesting for Great
Britain at the present moment than
the presence of the Russians and
Germans at Port Arthur and Kiao
ehau, principally liecause the Mar
quis of Salisbury sees in the attempt
to oust J. MeLeavy Brown, the Brit
ish Superintendent of Korean Cus
toms, a more serious scheme to over
throw Sir Robert Hart, the British
Director of the Chinese Imperial Mar
itime Customs, which has apparently
been nipped in the bud. The Cabi
net's existence would be short if it
permitted Russia to coerce the Tsung
li Yamen into dismissing the British
head of the Chinese Customs.
It is not known yet whether the
British Government will approve of the
arrangements arrived at, according to
a cable dispatch from Peking, by
which Mr. MeLeavy Brown and M.
Alexieff, the Russian agent in Korea,
will work the Korean customs together.
The British Ministers appear to be
somewhat distrustful, so the warships
of Great Britain which are at present
at Chemulpo, the port of Seoul, in or
der to give moral support to Mr.2
Brown, will remain there for the pres
ent.
At present there is keen interest in
commercial circles over the outcome of
the efforts of ltussia t-o. secure a Chi
nese loan i'!i the onerous terms at
tempted by the Pekinp correspondent
of the Times, who said the Chinese
Government refused to place the Likin
(internal revenue) under foreign con
trol as security for the loan proposed
by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
and asserted that urilesa the loan was
procurable without this coridition ar
rangements wdulcj forthwith be made
for a Russian guaranteed 4 per cent
loan of 100,000,000 taels, to be Issued at
93 net. The security for this loan
would be the land tax, which would re
main under Chinese administration
and China, in return, would give Rus
sia the monopoly of the railroads and
lines north of the Groat Wall, open a
port as a terminus of the. Siberian -
Railroad and would agree that a Rus
sian shouid succeed Sir Robert Hart
as director of the Chinese Imperial
Maritime Customs. The interest is in
creased by the equally strejiuous en
deavors of the British in China to keep
Russia from obtaining the loan and the
rich concessions which . it seems go
with it. It is improbable that the
British Government will see reason to
racede from its previous refusal to
guarantvf China financial support, al
though offend territorial concessions,
apparently showing that Great Brit
ain's. policy ;-s not territorial aggran
dizement,- but distinctly commercial. â 
A diplomat, talking over the alleged
desire of' Germany to arrive at an un
derstanding with Great Britain on the
far Eastern question, explains that the
change might be due to Germany's
dissatisfacttoi) with her allies. Her
faith in the Italian army has been
shaken by the defeats in Erythrea, and
the coilapse of the constitutional gov
ernment of Austria has made the ef
ficiency of. that empire In case of war
dbubtfuL ' : .
"In the meanwhile," the diplomat
continued, "Russia and France are al
lied, and Emperor William is anxious
to secure new friends. Therefore, fore
seeing the probability of an under
standing between Great Britain and
Japan, Emperor William i 3 determined
to array himself on their side. Hence
his seizures of a port already hypothe
cated to Russia, thereby proclaiming
rivalry with Russia and friendship
with Great Britain."
It is by no means clear that British
interests are seriously threatened at
the present moment, and she can prob
ably well afford to await until spring,
when, unless the normal conditions are
resumed, Cr. vat . l'.riiain will undoubt
edly take the steps necessary to pro
tect her interests and re-establish the
balance of power.
The Spectator publishes an interest
ing article on Japan's policy, in which
the writer resrards the Marquis Ito's
return to power and Japan's offer to
assist the officer^ at Peking in drilling
the Chinese army and her proposal to
consent to a postponement of the pay
ment of the war indemnity as possibly
foreshadowing a China-Japan alliance.
The financial barometer does not
show any trepidation, consols even im
proving. There is not the slightest
sign of the selling which always marks
real clouds on the political horizon and
th^r.- are signs of reaction in the long
continued depreciation in land. Farms
are selling and renting morr freely and
at higher prices. T6e -improvement is
attributed partly to the rise in the
price of wheat and partly to the cheap
ness of money. Capitalists are glad
even of the beggarly interest yielded
by land investments.
AMERICAN FLEET
IN CHINESE WATERS
TO BE STRENGTHENED.
It Is Said in Official Circles at Washington
That the Step Has No Particular Signifi-
cance at This Time.
WASHINGTON, Jar.. I,â lt is prob
able that the cruiser ulympiu will
shortly be replaced as the fiogÃhip oÂ£
the Chinese squadron by the battle
ship Oregon, now undergoing final re
pairs at Puget Sound. The Olympia
has been on the Chinese station for
about two years; and is said to require
considerable overhauling of her boilers
and machinery. Her relief by the
larger and more powerful warship
would have no more significance than
a natural desire to shnw a first-class
battle-ship of the United States navy
in waters never before visited by one.
In strengthening her naval forces in
China the United States would only be
following the example of the European
powers, and it is not at all improbable
that an emergency m;iy arise which
will render the services of a strong
naval force extremely desirable . and
advantageous to the large commercial
interests of the United States in that
quarter of the globe. It is believed at
the Navy Department that the change
recently ordered hi the command of the
Asiatic fleet has already occurred, and
that Commodore Dewey has relieved
' Admiral MeNair of the command of
that station. The new co.mmander-in
chief is well known in this vicinity
through his long, service on the Light
House Board and afterward as presi
dent of the Naval Inspection Board.
AMERICAN INTERESTS
TO BE SAFEGUARDED
BY NEW TREATIES.
What Will Follow if the Powers of Europe
Decide to Divide China Up Among
Themselves.
NEW YORK, Jan. I.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: "If China
is divided up among the powers, our
own history and the precedent we have
established with reference to Hawaii
will compel us to negotiate new treaties
with the several powers which take
Chinese territory."
This statement was made to me by
an official of the administration who
has discussed the Eastern situatii.-n
â with the President. As a result of
Cabinet discussion, it has been decided
that the United States will take no
part in the partitioning of China, ex
cept to see that Americans and their.
interests are not injured. The Ameri
can fleet in Asiatic waters will bt
ready to protect Americans and their
interests in case of necessity.
It is the commercial aspect of the
situation which the authorities an
watching with much anxiety. If th:
European governments take > possession
i*Â£ Chinese territory they will put ;:
force in such territory their ov.-a cue
turns and revenue laws, which will, o'
course, be mor stringent than those n
operation under the present coven:
ment of China.
In addition, it would be necessary fo.

coin < ded by officials of the; admlniÂ»tl-a
tion that the treaties existing, between
the United States and China would fall
to the ground in case of the collapse of
the Peking gov. rnment. In -'connection
with the Hav.aiian ((mtrovefsy, it hafl.
been argu^,} l.y Secretary. .Sheritian.
that all treaties between Japan and
Hawaii will cease to be binding upon
the accomplishniirnt of annexa-tiort, and
in support of this statement he quoted
this recog:ni7.f<l principle of interna
tional law: "Obligations of treaties,
even where some of their stipulations
are in their terms perpetual, expire In
case either of the contracting parties
loses its existence as an independent
state, or in case its internal constitu
tion is so changed as to render the
treaty inapplicable to the new condi
tion of things."
While the President has formulated
no definite plans, and will not , do bo
until the partition of China is an ac
complished fact, there is reason to be
lieve that once the dissolution af China
is decided upon negotiations will be
commenced with the powers taking ter
ritory, which will have as their object
the protection of American interests.
The United States is now negotiating
a commercial treaty with France which
shall apply to Tunis, ov-r which France
has established a protectorate, and it
has been lield by authorities that
treaties signed by Tunisian and Ameri
can statesmen years ago have become
void, as a result of the usurpation of
its administration in that country by
the French government. The same
contention applies to *"hina.

chance at a. Christmas dinner, be he j

did good. One fed all 'the newsboys,

charming and whole-souled, tactful
woman â an actress of talent â and fol
lowed by a retinue of assistants and
wagons of boys, she visited at the mid
night hour the dreary tenements of the
Kast Side, where there were misery
and hopelessness, and where the dawn
of the great festival was dreaded. Her
visits were unheralded. The sur
prise was absolute. Empty cupboards
were filled with food, ragged stockings
were filled with toys. Parents wept
with joy, and miserable little people
awoke and stared as they saw a Santa
Claus such as they had never heard of
dispensing candies and toys such as
they had wistfully longed for. Miss
Otis was overcome with the realiza
tion of the good she had done. She
is a very clever actress, who, by-the
by. says that she will never forget the
hospitality of California, - She visited
the coast some years ago with the
members of the New York Press Club.
Howard Gould gave a sumptuous
Christmas dinner to a small coterie of
friends. Katherine Ck-mmons, the
actress, who is a Californian, acted as
hostess, and the live journals have
amused themselves with a revival of
the old yarn that the young million
aire and the beautiful Thespian arÂ«
secretly married. Wipe men of the
world know better and wonder at the
tale.
A curious story is published this
morning â a case of "cherchez la
femme." The Khedive of Egypt has a
brotherâ Mahomet Aliâ who is the
heir apparent. There have' been re
ports recently that Mahomet Ali had
practically abdicated his rights by
some mysterious action. It is now
stated that the deed in question- is his
betrothal to an American heiressâ Miss
Lillie Wanamaker, daughter of John,
the great merchant of Philadelphia.
The story is told circumstantially. It
is probably- untrue, but makes good
reading nevertheless. Talking of. John
Wahamaker, commercial " circles in
this city cannot get over their surprise
that he has succeeded so well with his
New York! venture. .He- bought out the
old A, T. Stewart concern, .which had
gone to the. dogs' in a way, and in less
[ than two -years rebuilt it, so that to

At the conclusion of the judge's stern
Word*, Fol^y sank Mmp and helpless to
his chair, but grasped the armg of it
a niument later and sat up straight.
Major Woortson at once fiXed a motion
for a new trial, which was overruled.
Not one of Foley's witnesses or
frjends were near him at the trying
moment.
The crowd In the court room were
well pleased.- and grave vent to their
feelings by stamping of feat and ap
plause.
All the morning little groups of farm
ers gathered on the streets and it was
authoritatively stated that a mob had
been organized to hang Foley. had the
jury failed to do what the residents of
Clay County considered to be theh
duty.
Before the arguments began Foley
and his coasla sat at a table talking
and lauphinp, and he acted as if he
did not fear the result of the trial.
During the addresses by his attorneys*.
however, Foley and his sisters were al
most constantly in tears.
Foley's crime, the murder of his
mother, an aged woman, and his sis

brutal. They lived topother on their
farm four miles north of Liberty. The

he proposes to present the name of
Jephthah Gerrard, a silver Republican,
for Senator against Hanna. Including
the fusionists there- are sixty-two Re

in the House, a total of 109, with fifty

Governor Bushnell and the entire
State administration took an active
part in the caucuses to-night against
Senator Hanna, joining the Democr;tir
members and .those Republicans wV>
remained away from the caucus. Whfp
the- crowds around the opposition heaCi
quarters were jollifying it was learned
that six Democratic members of thti
House were also. absent from their
caucus to-night, which was secret. The
Republican caucuses were open to
members of the press. It is claimed
that these Democratic members are op
posed to voting for Republicans and
want to vote for Democratic candidates
for the legislative offices and Senator.
Under the law, if there is not a ma
jority of all after ten ballots, the ma
jority of a quorum will elect officers of

State Charles Kinney, a strong Hanna
man, presides. The Hanna men de
clare with confidence that Boxwell will
be the speaker. ;c; c

PARIS, Jan. l.^The old year has
seen out, apparently, the Panama scan
dal and what is hoped to have been the
worst phase of the DreyfuS-Esterhazy
affair.
In regard to the Dreyfus case, public
excitement has dwindled down consid
erably. The opinion is universal that
the investigation conducted by Com
mandant Ra vary has elicited no serious
charge against Count Esterhazy. It is
expected that, armed with a verdict
exonerating him, Count Esterhazy will
institute civil proceedings against
Mathieu Dreyfus, who, with his brother
Leon, is the subject of an inquiry by
Examining Magistrate Bertulus on
charges of having attempted. to corrupt
an official. Some time ago the asser
tion was made that Mathieu and Leon
Dreyfus had offered a heavy bribe to
the late Colonel Sandherr, who played
an important part in the pi'oceedings
of th<? court-martial, with a view to in
fluencing his attitude In regard to their
brother. This story was indignantly
contradicted by Mathieu Dreyfus, who
announced his intention of taking
steps for libel against a newspaper
which published the story and against
the widow of Colonel Sandherr. A
couple of days ' passed, however, and
Dreyfus took no move to start legal
proceedings. It was then surmised
that he had been really bluffing, and
this surmise is more than confirmed by
the news that Magistrate Bertulus has
begun an inquiry at the instance of
Commandant Ravary.
The annual pension of General .Bour
bakis widow has just been fixed at
$700. France, like the United States,
has its pension abused. This is an in
stance, and it is roundly denounced by
the papers as entirely inadequate in
the case of a widow of a genera} who
gloriously upheld the honor of France
through good and evil days. The Figaro
contrasts the smallness of this sum
with the large pensions received by the
widows of certain parliamentary civil
j officials.
No successor has yet been named to
Carvalho as manager of the Opera
Comique, but Albert Carrere, the pres
ent manager of the Theatres dv Gyro
nase and Dv Vaudeville, is bel&ved to
have the best chanceo.
Some weeks ago I cabled you of the
excitement produced by the arrest of
a large band of marauders who "oper
ated" chiefly in the neighborhood of
Xeuilly bridge. Subsequent investiga
tion revealed the existence of other
dangerous gangs, the last of whj. h is
now securely under lock and key. The
last band arrested numbered no less
than thirty-three, the eldest of whom is
not more than 21 years of age. Almost
innumerable crimes of robbery with
violence are attributed to the young
ruffians. The scene of their operations
was, as I stated, chiefly in the suburbs
near the river. In this connection jt is
pointed out that during the months of
May, June and July last no fewer than
fifty-three corpses were fished out of
the Seine. Of these it is believed that
by far the greater number have been
foully murdered.
According to the last report of the
Board of Trade there were in Britain
nearly 2,000,000 farm horses, about
10,000,000 cattle, more than 32,000,000
eep and something like 4,000,000 pigs.

is the weapon with which she conquers her
world. Almost every woman believes that
she possesses at least some one attractive
feature and strives to make the mostof that.
But mere regularity of feature is not the
most attractive form of beauty. . â  ,c, c '.-
Mankind is more influenced by the bright
glowing vitality of perfect health. A classic
cast of countenance will not make a woman
attractive and captivating, if she is pale,
thin, weak and nervous, or has a pimply
complexion or unwholesome breath.
These complaints are due to imperfect
nutrition. The digestive and blood-making
organs fail to extract the needed nourish-
ment from the food, and the liver is too slug-
gish to cleanse the blood of bilious impuri-
'< -s. The entire constitution becomes weak
and poisoned. c Â
i he only perfect antidote for this state of
things is Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis-
icoyery, it gives power to the digestive and
nutritive organs to make an abundance of

THE JUBILEE PARADE
JZ\ LL people who take an interest in the Golden
/ \ Jubilee and the mmmc exposition to follow
it expect San Francisco to make the grand
parade a feature of notable brilliancy and beauty. As
the pageant precedes the opening of the exposition
the fame of it sent abroad will have much effect in
forming first impressions concerning the exposition
itself, and for that reason, it for none other, the peo
ple of the city should see to it that the parade is
made imposing and impressive in every particular.
A pageant: of the kind required for the occasion
cannot be provided without money. The United
States is rapidly becoming a country of grand par
ades. Without counting the marvels accomplished
at New Orleans and St: Louis in affairs of this kind,
there are a whole host of parades presented to the
people every year. In California itself there are sev
eral of these annual pageants that have become nota
ble. The â  country; therefore, has a high standard by
which to judge of such : matters arid it is : not going
to be an easy task for San Francisco to achieve
something that will win applause as a genuine
triumph. : ;: : V :â â  \
Money for the grand parade is needed and should
be forthcoming without delay. The directors of the
enterprise are -compelled to work rapidly and decide
promptly what is to be. done. They have not the
ample time of a full year in which torriake prepara
tions, as is the case in annual parades in other cities.
The time at their disposal .is counted by days, not by
months, and prompt contributions are therefore es
sential to their work. :â ':â '.' '.,'-. .â 'â â :.'
The days ofthe jubilee*will be : virtually San Fraii
cisco and California, day? at the /exposition. The
pageant will be the special entertain merit we Are to
pruvide for those who accept out invitation to join
with us in the .celebration. Our civic patriotism is
at stake. : We must celebrate the great discovery and
open the exposition with a pageant that will a<id to
the prestige/ of . pur city. The managers should be
provided with.ajnple funds to tnake the display
gorgeous, golden and glorious, ; The time is short.
The enterprise is important. Make your contribu
tions liberal .and make them now:
Mr. Hearst seems to be much interested in the city
which he has so modestly enlarged, and under his
direction it appears to be thriving as well as could
be expected. Yet we can but wonder that the
swollen municipality should have gone to the trouble
â¢ of electing a Mayor. Possibly, however, Mr. Hearst
needs a few assistants. . . .
It is painful to observe that a Spokane divine who
had worn out his welcome was attacked in the church
: by the opposing faction, gagged and fired from the
sacred edirke. There is almost a touch of worldli
ncss about the incident.
Probably it was from knowing of the standing
order that any one hauling down the American flag
shall be shot on the spot rtiat the Mexicans selected
a spot out of range. ...
The Kaiser has been "inspiring" some editorial
again, but all this does is to arouse more curiosity
as to what has been umpiring the Kaiser.
SENATOR PERKINS AND ANNEXATION.
/V 4 UCH has been said and sung recently to keep
/ \ up the waning courage of the annexation
ists, but it is all nullified and vacated by the
very frank admissions of Senator Perkins. He de
clares the treaty foredoomed, though he supports it,
and is firm in his conviction that the joint resolu
tion plan is so rankly unconstitutional that it cannot
pass. Indeed, he is informed by several supporters of
the treaty that they will oppose the joint resolution.
It is imperative that this country take advantage of
the situation created in the East by the presence of
the European powers and their jealous contention
over the Chinese carcass. Their disposition and their
necessities make them all subject to our policy for
the independence and neutrality of Hawaii.
Senator Perkins knows clearly and approves every
reason against annexation, and he knows with equal
intelligence the reasons for the independence and
autonomy of that country. California would advance
to a very proud position in the Union if Senator Per
kins would prepare action for the Senate instructing
the President to proceed with a statement of our
policy toward Hawaii, giving notice to the world
that we abstain from aggrandizement there and that
like abstention is expected of the other nations, and
that any different policy on the part of any of them
will be regarded as unfriendly and intolerable.
Such action would be not only statesmanship of
the first order, but it would also regain our national
prestige as a people not only free but just, and would
secure for us just now the only honorable promi
nence we can possibly enjoy. While Europe stands
with a carving knife over China and the four powers
are disputing over the prospective spoils we may be
distinguished by appearing with no stolen birthright
in our possession.
If Senator Perkins could take the leadership in this
policy California would everywhere gain prestige
that would advance her interests and dignify her
people.
This State should not appear to always follow
Â«orae other lead. The position of Hawaii affects us
more than any other part of the Union. A majority
of our people oppose annexation. A very large ma
jority of them object to Senator Morgan's offensive
assumption of ownership or leadership of California.
Then let our Republican Senator lead and we can
assure him he will have the people at his back.
THE LOW OF CONTEMPT.
THE monograph upon the law of contempt con
tributed to the California reports the other day
by the Supreme Court makes a rich addition to
the literature of the subject. The opinion of Justice
Van Fleet and the concurring opinions of Chief Jus
tice Bcatty and Justice McFarland are not interesting
because they preserve the "liberty of the press" or
reaffirm the doctrines of "free speech." The liberty
of the press and the doctrines of free speech were al
ready firmly imbedded in our constitution and laws.
The decision is important mainly because it elabor
ates the law of contempt and places restrictions upon
the power of Superior Judges to punish editors who
criticise them.
The power of a court to punish summarily for as
saults upon its dignity is left unimpaired. Thus,
when a person swears at a Judge or otherwise inter
feres with the orderly proceedings of his court he
may be fined and imprisoned on the spot. The
theory is that an offense committed in the presence
of the court need not be the subject of inquiry. The
Judge having witnessed the contempt may punish it
at once without trial.
But when some one "roasts" a Judge from a dis
tance, as was done by the Sacramento Bee, there art
two courses open for the jurist. If the criticism is
an interference with the proceedings of the court, as
an attempt to influence a jury or intimidate a lawyer
would be, the Judge may summon the critic, take
testimony in the usual way and punish for contempt.
If it appears that the criticism was not an interfer
ence with the business of the court, but was, as in
Judge Catlin's case, an attack on the jurist person
filly, the law of contempt docs not apply. The Judge
in that event may cither sue for libel or club the
editor. Whether the alleged contempt was actually
an interference with the business of the court or a
personal attack on the Judge is a question of fact to
be determined from the evidence, subject to review
by the Supreme Court.
The mistake Committed by Judge Catlin consisted
in refusing to give Editor McClatchy a chance to
defend himself. In that respect his course was ty
rannical and inexcusable. The facts of the case in
dicate that the Bee's criticism was well founded and
that in upholding the attorney who launched the
attack on the paper Judge Catlin Rave way to his
temper. Probably he had been stung by the Bee on
another occasion and was still smarting. At all
events his conduct of the contempt proceeding from
beginning to end proved his utter want of a judicial
disposition.
The decision of the Supreme Court is a valuable
addition to the literature of contempt for the reason
that it lays down a rule of newspaper criticism be
yond which no editor need ever go. The press may
discipline the Judges so long as it does not interfere
with the proceedings of their courts. It may express
its opinion of decisions and comment upon testi
mony without fear of being hauled up and sent to
jail. The onh/ defense necessary in a prosecution for
contempt committed outside the hearing of the
court is a spirit of fairness and a disposition to stick
to the truth. To this extent the decision in the Mc-
Clatchy case improves the law of contempt. Amen
able to well founded and honest criticism, the Judges
will be more judicial, and with fine and imprisonment
hanging over them editors will be fairer and less dis
posed to get excited.
For the increase of diphtheria the Health Depart
ment blames the Board of Education. The latter
body refused to heed the warning of the former or to
close the schools that had been officially pronounced
dangerous. Perhaps the educators think that the
death of a few children is not so much to be con
sidered as the value of the little ones being able'to
employ their last gasps in naming the capital of Tim
buctoo or locating the realm of the Akoond of Swat.
This view can hardly be cailed humane, the opinion
s.tiU existing that a living child, even after missing
a term at school, may be a real comfort.
Three men detected in stealing sand have been dis

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1898.
THE UNIVERSITY COMPETITION.
THE issue of an invitation to the architects of
the world to co-operate in the preparation of a
permanent general plan of buildings and
grounds for the University of California serves to re
call public attention at the beginning of the new
year to the lofty hopes and noble purposes of the
trustees and friends of that institution.
It is most appropriate that the invitation should
be issued just at this time. It will be another reason
for the world to give consideration to California at
this period, when her prospects are most bright and
her attractions to home seekers and investors most
promising. The material advantages of the State
are set forth prominently in many ways at this junc
ture, and it is fortunate that the great plans of the
university are made knoA-n also in order that the
world may understand that California has aspirations
for learning and art as well as for wealth and busi
ness.
It is not worth while attempting to forecast the
results, likely to be obtained by the competition. It
is sufficient to know that no better plan could be de
vised to accomplish that at which the trustees aim
and what every patriotic Californian desires. From
an artistic contest in which so many eminent masters
take part it is a fair assumption we shall gain a group
of buildings sufficiently original in mass and detail
to constitute one of the notable architectural
triumphs of the world.
The terms under which the competition is to be
conducted are calculated to excite the emulation of
architects of all countries. They are fair to all com
petitors and promise rich rewards in the way of en
hanced reputation to all who are successful. The
contest will be particularly attractive to young men
of talent and ambition who are striving to win a
name for themselves and to demonstrate their ability
to compose edifices of more than ordinary dignity
and magnitude.
The grandeur of the idea involved In this plan for
arranging the permanent edifices of the university
is. in harmony with the greatness of the State. Cali
fornia is in many respects an empire within herself.
The possibilities of her destiny permit her to become
within a time comparatively short the leading com
monwealth of the Union and one of the most re
nowned regions of the world.
We have reason to aspire to a culture peculiarly
our own, distinct in tone if not different in nature
from that of any other land. The foundations of
that culture will be at the two universities that have
been already so well endowed. It is therefore fitting
that each of them should be magnificently housed,
and this is particularly true of that which bears the
name of the State. Great hopes go out with the in
vitations sent to the architects of the world, and
along with those hopes should go a resolve on the
part of Californians to make right use of the best
plans the world can give by living up to them and
hastening the completion of the edifices designed.
AMERICAN agriculturists are indebted to the
Orange Judd Company for the publication of
a treatise on the sugar industry which is both
valuable and opportune. The work was written by
the editor of the American Agriculturist, Herbert
.Vynck, assisted by Professor W. C. Stubbs, director
of the Louisiana sugar experiment station, and deals
exhaustively with the problems involved in the de
\elopment of the industry in the United States.
From statistics quoted in the book it appears that
it required every pound of wheat and flour exported
from the United States in the fiscal year of 1896 to
pay for the sugar imported. The barley, oats, rye,
fruits and nuts, hops, vegetable oils, oleomargarine,
butter and cheese, pork and hams that were exported
last year, all put together, represent in value only
two-thirds of the sugar imported.
While in order to buy sugar our farmers are thus
compelled to raise staple crops and sell them in com
petition with the same crops produced in cheap land
and cheap labor countries, their lands in many
States are as well if not better adapted to sugar pro
duction than those of any other people. An acre of
land in the West will yield a corn crop which, when
sold, brings a price equal to that of about 100 pounds
of sugar, but the same acre of land, according to Mr.
Myrick. when planted to sugar beets will produce
from 2000 to 3000 pounds of the best refined sugar in
the market.
By pursuing this blundering economic policy of
K.i owing cheap staples and exchanging them for im
ported sugar the country has lost and is losing
enormous sums every year. It appears that from
1880 to 1885, inclusive, the people of the United
States paid out for imported sugar almost $1,500,000.
000. If the imports of molasses were included and
the exports of saccharine deducted the figures would
show fully that amount.
One of the worst features of the business is the
rapidity with which the imports are increasing. Oui
imports from Europe in 1896 were five times as much
as during the preceding year. Almost as large was
the increase of the imports from the Orient. Mr.
Myrick says, however, that the worst and most in
excusable phase of the sugar situation is the unjust,
unfair, illegal and unbusinesslike competition of
sugar from the Hawaiian Islands, where contract
coolie labor is employed on terms with which no
American workingman can compete or should be re
quired to compete.
Fortunately the outlook for the future is bright.
The American people have begun to study the
problem and have discerned the folly of importing
sugar when they can produce it at home.. It requires
no long argument to prove to a man that lie is en
gaged in unprofitable business when he exchanges
for the value of 100 pounds of sugar the product of
an acre that would have yielded 2000 pounds.
We have only to give the American sugar producer
an adequate protection against the bounty supported
industry of Europe and the coolie industry of the
Orient and Hawaii to assure the production in this
country of all the sugar we need. By that work we
will accomplish a saving of $100,000,000 annually, and
at the same time by diversifying our rural products
add to the general welfare of agricultural industry.
Probably the man who says that ior $15,000 he will
produce in court the woman for whose murder
Luetgert is being tried is a plain but rather robust
liar. But while many arc able to compete with him
in this line if his story is untrue, lie is clear ahead in
the mean-tnan competition if there is veracity in him.
Without venturing a conjecture as to what Mr.
Mills said to "Major Winchell. it may be taken for
granted that it was nothing of the sort once said by
the Governor of North Carolina to the Governor of
South Carolina.

Last week I made a wholly futile
endeavor to say something about Hall
Caine's "Christian." The machine
which sets copy, not according to the
way It is written, but as it thinks it
should have been written, simply re
fused to permit this duty to be per

inner consciousness it brought a Jum

the book and the name of the author,
leaving the reader to guess what the
matter was. Just now, being engaged
in an effort to forget the book, that
I ever read it, and to lead a better life,
I refrain from trying to recall what
had been written. But the general ef

Without desiring to give a temper
ance lecture it may be possible to call
attention to three items in the paper
of the morning after Christmas. Each
of the three records the fact that a man
had been burned to death, and in each
instance the man was drunk. Perhaps
if all the trio were predestined to per
ish by flame it is as well that they
should have been in this condition. It
not only numbed their senses, but al
cohol being so Inflammable, caused
them to ignite more readily, burn with
a finer glow and get to a nerveless cinder
with the least delay. However, had
they remained sober there is a prob

Members of certain professions take
pride in a code of "ethics." This code
to the world outside is often a puzzle,
but to ask what it may be for is a
violation of something or other not
fully understood. The lay mind is sup
posed to be unable to approach it in
a spirit even of respectful inquiry, for
it is baffled at the threshold of pro
fessional entrenchment, and from with
in there comes no ray of light. A code
which binds to honor may be compre
hended of all men, but one which does
not do this must fail to excite universal
esteem. The mere possession of a sys
tem of ethics is no sign of virtue, for
thieves are thus so notably equipped
that the fact has passed into proverb.
Perhaps Attorney J. C. Campbell could
explain a subject now shrouded in
doubt. What is the ethical standard?
If a lawyer is bound to keep the secret
of a client, though the revelation would
be useful to the state, is he not equally
bound to keep the secret which comes
to him unaccompanied by a fee? Mr.
Campbell is a lawyer of standing an-1
experience. Doubtless his lips have of
ten been sealed concerning themes on
which the public eagerly sought infor
mation. Yet the tale told to him at
a lunch, a place where the tongue is
prone to looseness, was babbled about
and at last he made oath in court to
having heard it. It is true that his re
telling of a personal and private com
munication had an apparent tendency
to protect a criminal, but does this cir
cumstance, even appealing as it must
to the instinct of his calling, serve as
a valid excuse? I do not ch~rjre Mr.
Campbell with having done wrong. In
proper humility I seek knowledge. But
it is not too much to say that many a
man who is not hedged in by a wall
of "ethics" wouM have scorned the
thought of violating a confidence hast
ily and foolishly bestowed.
If the object of a long and expensive
trial is to determine the guilt or inno
cence of a prisoner my notion is that
the truth being known in advance robs
the occasion of usefulness and dignity,
reducing It to the level of a farce. It
seems to me there should be a short
cut in such cases, and that proceeding
ought not to occupy much more time
than required for the passing of sen
tence, or formulation of an honorable
discharge. It is true that no constitu
tional provision exists making this pos
sible, but thore is no proof that any
constitution yet devised is perfect. The
example of young Flannelly may be
taken as an illustration. Flannelly
killed his father and the officer who
undertook to arrest him for the crime
Tet there will be an elaborate trial, ap
peals, finally to the Supreme Court
And all for what? To keep a murderer
from a hanging he has earned twice
over. My position is strengthened by
the fact that not a lawyer in the world
will agree with me in it. .
The fact that Trinity is to have a new
rector is cheering in that It shows the
absence of the Rev. George Walk to be
more than temporary. I have been in
Trinity but onee â on that occasion be
ing one of twelve who were acting as
pail-bearers at the funeral of Kate
Field. Eight of the number were,
newspaper men. We were met at the
door by Walk, fully robed, but acting
the part of a drunken, blustering. bully,
with a perfection which bespoke long
practice. Something had occurred be
fore our arrival to awaken unpleasant
emotions within his savage breast.
What it was we did not know, nor
was Walk coherent enough to explain.
So we stood there in wonder while- he
heaped abuse alike upon the living and
their silent burden. We even refrained
from reply, fearing to rouse his wrath
to a more noisy indecency, and having
for the sanctuary a respect wholly
wanting on the part of the rector.
When he had finished his tirade, he
strode up the aisle, intoning the words
of the beautiful Bervice. but the voice
was the voice of a sinner who wanted
to swear, and his every footfall was
emphasis to an unseemly anger. Walk
deserved to have been knocked down
and stepped on, and though at least
eight gentlemen realized this they
forebore, not for the fellow's sake, but
because of the place and the presence
of the dead his wanton tongue as
sailed. For one I have remembered
Walk and have intended, when indig
nation had been so mellowed by time
as to permit the matter to be treated
dispassionately, to make a few re
marks about him.

Ths utility of the Coroner is a mat
ter to which thought is naturally di
rected by the faot that although he is
constantly rendering verdicts none of
them adds one whit to the sum of hu
man knowledge. When a man is found
dead in a room locked from the inside,
every' gas burner unlighted and turned
on. a note on the table explaining why
he intended to kill himself, the suppo
sition of suicide Is entirely safe. When
a murderer is executed the records of
the prison ought to be sufficient to
show how he died. It is true that if
carelessness on the part of a person
or corporation is shown the Coroner
sometimes makes bold to formulate a
"censure," the effect of which has
never been observed. No verdict for
damages was ever found on a Coro
ner's censure, and by reason of it no
corporation ever missed a dividend.
Whether th? death led to criminal or
civil action the part taken by the Cor
oner amounts to nothing, being abso
lutely ignored. The only thing accom
plished by this official, so far as I can
see, is to keep a mortuary record,
which could as well be kept by thÂ«
gentleman whose melancholy duty it is
to issue burial permits.

The question of annexing Hawaii
does not particularly concern those
who have an abiding faith that the
people of the United States after a
short but honest career do hot intend
to go into the business of larceny. If
they take territory to which, they have
no right they will be doing that whi-ch
others are doing at the expense of bet
ing known as robber nations. There
is this difference: The others are pre
pared to battle for what they want.
The annexationists observe that theft
has already been committed, and all
they have to do is to divide with the
original thief the plunder and the
guilt. It is not a noble scheme. I can
Bee no excuse for taking Hawaii which
does not with equal force apply to pick

ATTACKED HIS WIFE.
Arrest of T. J. Nyrjam After a Des
perate Struggle.
Policemen McSorley and O'Keefe had
a desperate struggle with a man last
night whom they had arrested for
drunkenness and disturbing the peace.
The prisoner's name is T. J. Nyham, a
stevedore, living at 427>Â£ Clementina
street. Nyham, who the police say is
a desperate character, went home in an
intoxicated condition, and picking up
a hatchet, threatened to kill his wife.
She ran from the house, and meeting
the police officers informed them of her
husband's conduct. Just them Nyham
emerged from the house armed with
a razor. The. officers seized him, and
after a desperate struggle, during
Which O'Keefe was severely kicked in
the left side, they succeeded in over
powering him. Nyham had a slight
Nalp wound, which was caused by be
ing struck over the head with a club
in the hands of one of the officers.
After the wound was dressed in the
Receiving Hospital he was taken to the
City Prison and locked up.
BRITISH SHIP KILMORY.
Many of the vessels in port were handsomel;' decorated yesterday in
honor of the new year. The Kilmory easily carried off the palm, however,
and much praise was bestowed upon the efforts of Captain Ferguson and his
men. Every yard and spar on the ship carried one or more bunches of holly.
ECONOMY ON
FERRY-BOATS
Three Crews to Handle
the Bay City andEnci
nal in Future.
The Men Will Now Have to
Stand a Watch of Forty-
Eight Hours.
Much Grumbling Over thÂ« Extra
Work and Many of the Hands
Will Kesign.
Trouble is browing among the mm
who man the ferry steamers Bay City
and Encinal an<l freight boat Thor
oughfare. Hitherto the Encinal and IJr.y
City have had two crews, one working
twenty-four hours and then being re
lieved by the second crew. In this
way they each worked twenty-four
hours and got twenty-four hours off.
Now the two steamers are to be work
ed with three crews, (me being wh.:t
is called "the swing crew." For in
stance, the crew of the Bay City will
work for forty-eight hours straight
and then the "swing crew" will take
over the boat for twenty-four hours.
At the end of that time the Bay City
men will go back to work and "the
swing crew" will go to the Encinal and
relieve her men for twenty-fcur hours.
At the end of that day "the swing
crew" will take its day off and will be
ready to relieve the Bay City men at
the end of their forty-eight hour
watch. In this way a crew is saved
which will be used in manning the
Thoroughfare.
The necessity for the change came
about in this way. When the Encinal
was refitted and made into a modern
boat, she had rails laid on her deck
and was used as a freight boat after
she was through with the passenger
business. While handling freight,
however, she was delayed so long at
Lombard street nearly every morning
that she could not get to Oakland in
time to make the 6:35 a. m. trip to
San Francisco. In consequence work
ingmen and others whose duties called
them to the city early had to wait for
the return of the Bay City on the 7:05
a. m. trip. This gave rise to endless
complaints and in consequence the
Thoroughfare was called out of retire
ment, fitted out for the narrow-gauge
route and goes into commission to-day.
In future th< Encinal and Bay City
will carry passengers only. The
changes among the crews of the tu<>
boats are likely to- be frequent as the
men assert that they will never be able
to stand a forty-eight hour watch as
a regular thing.
The ship Llewellyn J. Morse, that
put in here in distress while on her
way from Saji Diego for Puget Sound,
will have to go on the drydock. She
was strained in- the recent southeaster
and will have, to be caulked through
out.

When writing the Dootor, pUaso mention 'hiÂ» paoÂ«r
in honor of the new year. The Celtic
burn, at Union street wharf, and the
Orealla and Pyrenees, in the stream,
were artistically dressed with flags
and bunting, but the Kilmory, at the
m .1 wall, easily took the pride of place.
She did not lly many flags, but every
yard and mast carried one or more
bunchÂ«s nf holly. Captain Ferguson
sent his boys to the hills back of
Selby's for the evergreens, and they
brought back enough to deck the ship
from stem to stern and from deok to
truck. The Kilmory is a handsome
Bhip at any time, but yesterday she
was the observed of all observers.
Captain Ferguson is well known in
San Francisco, having been here at
different times in the Highland Home,
Gowanbank, City of Delhi and now
the Kilmory. The latter vessel Is a
sister ship to the Kilbrannan, which
w;is wrecked in Puget Sound several
years ago.
All the British ships were thrown
open to visitors yesterday, and the cap
tains remained aboard to receive New
callers The Inverneil, Lindfield.
Kilmory, Celticburn and Royal Forth
had numbers of people aboard through
out the day, and the officers and men
made all welcome. Early in the after
noon the government steamer McDow
ell went out to the British warships
with an invitation for the officers of
the I^eander and Virago to accept the
hospitality of General Shafter at Fort
Mason. The McDowell waited and car
ried them to the fort.
The bark Canada, that was put into
commission last week, after being laid
up for two years, had great difficulty
in securing a crew. Men are scarce,
and not only was union wages given
but an advance was paid before the
sailors would go aboard. The Canada
is to be fitted out with berths at Seat
tle and will go intt> the Klondike rush.
The steamer Alice Blanchard is on
her way here with the little tug Milton
in tow. The latter has been in use
on Coos Bay for some time, but she
is now to be fixed up for the spring
rush to the Klondike.
Had it not been for Captain Brockaw
of the tug Reliance three fishermen
would have lost their boats the other
day. One of the boats capsized and
the other two went to the assistance of
their comrade. Their boats nearly
swamped and all three were rapidly
drifting out to sea when the life-saving
boat put in an appearance. The drown

New Year's day at the Presidio mili

gen on the grounds than there has
been for many years except on special I
occasions. There were hundreds, erf I
promenaders moving from point, to |

grounds, admiring the officers' quar
ters, which have recently been embel
lished with coats of paint, and the
neat garden spots in front of them,
then taking an exterior view of the
model new barracks, which drew many
words of praise.
During the forenoon the officers from
this post went to Fort Mason to pay
their respects to Brigadier-General
Shafter at his home, and to wish him
a happy New Year." In the after
noon the Brigadier and members of his
staff visited the Presidio to pay calls
on officers and their families.
In the forenoon a team from Troop

A consumptive , patient, who made use of Ripans
Tabules, found his weight increased but was made anxious
because expectoration ceased, and feared on that account
that harm would result, but on consulting a physician he
learned that Ripans Tabules do not affect the conditions
of the lungs in arty material degree, but if they do so at
all they have.more tendency to favor expectoration rather -
than to suppress it. Consequently there is no reason why
a consumptive should discontinue the use of Ripans Tab-
ules because expectoration has ceased. Furthermore, in
lung troubles an increase in weight is the best indication
of improvement, and as the Tabules regulate the diges-
tion they increase nutrition and are doing the very service ;
required to produce best results. _-_

try conclusions at football, and with

PASAPEXA, Jan. I.â All Tasa
dena's residents, her numerous
visitors from every section of
the United States and large

enthusiastic tribute to that trinity
which, has made famous the State of
California throughout the civilized
world. It was a long-to-be-remem
bered day of sunshine, fruit and flow
ers.
The colors of the day, set apart for
the tournament of roses, were most
gloriously contributed by nature,
which was in one of her best holiday
moods. The b!u<? was found in the
unclouded dome <>f the heavens above
and the gold in the globes of luscious
fruit pendent from rho trees that lined
â both sides of the streets along the
larger portion of the route of the great
prize floral parade. The art of man
ttjeo vied, bitt feebly under the cireum
â¢stanrts, with nature, Blue and gold
draperies festooned nearly every
'building in the business portion of the
city, and many residencies were decked
with similar decorative materials,
badges ami rosettes dangled from the
/lapels of Goats and not a few ladies
â deigned to honor the day by display
ing it.< colors in the adornment of their
: gowns. Goodrsized banners of the
festal lines were also spread to the
cooling zephyrs that made the day
ideal.

I The parade started promptly at 11
o'clock and made an imposing appear
ance as it wound its way through the
broad avenues along the line of march,
crowded upon either side by rows upon

Fete.
rows of spectators, standing upon ve
hicles of all descriptions, thronging
stairways and even climbing telegraph
and telephone poles to catch a glimpse
of the pageant. Many of the private
houses along the line were gay with
blue and gold decorations, and the
morning was so summerlike that the
street costumes of all were suggestive
of midsummer.
The parade was headed by a platoon
of mounted police, preceded by a bugler
cr tournament herald, picturesquely
costumed in a white satin courier's
costume, and mounted on a white
steed decorated with saddle cloth of
white rosebuds and smilax, intertwined
about the animal's neck. The police
were in regular uniform, their steeds
simply decorated with wreaths of smi
lax. dotted with yellow daisies.
City Marshal J. S. Lacey acted as
chief of this division. The tournanent
officers followed, headed by General
Director M. S. Weight. These were
oicrht in number, and they were cos
tumed in white flannel trousers, black
coats and vests, light slouch hats and
v ack leggings, and were mounted on
prancing bays. The horses were dec
orated with saddle cloths, solid in rose
buds or geraniums of varying colors,
blue and prold an-d red sashes for the
riders, and the necks of the horses had
heavy collars of rosebuds. There were
four aids to the general director.
mounted and costumed as Mexican ea
pajleros, with silver trappings and
Mexican saddles on their horses. Their
floral decorations were yellow mari
golds, and acacia.
The Seventh Regiment band, in blue
Uniform, came next in line, discoursing
sweet music. The cavalry of Troop D,
Hi v. c. with Captain Howland in
command, followed, and looked mag
nificent in its distinctive dress uni
form, which consisted of white cork
helmets, yellow horsehair plumes,
United States regulation dress coats,
brass shoulder straps and yellow
aguellete. Thje float entered by Com
pany I, N. G. C, was a handsome en
try, representing the seal of California,
and was drawn by four bays, orna
mented in regimental colors. The body
of the float was draped in blue and
gold, with an abundance of green foli
age, amid which sat the Goddess of
Liberty, in symbolic costume. At one
side was massed fruit, at the other a
sleeping bear was placed, while on
each of the four corners of the float
soldiers were posed at "parade rest."
The floral decorations were holly ber
ries, vines and red geraniums in great
profusion.
One of the most interesting features
of the pageant followed â a pioneer
coach. This is the property of Cap
tain Banning, of Los Angeles, and is
an old-timer. It was drawn by four
grays and was greeted veith continued
applause. The floral decorations were
white eucalyptus blossoms and yellow
acacia. The occupants of the coach
were all pioneers of '73, '74 and '75, and
they carried aloft a handsome banner,
bearing the words "Pasadena Pio
neers."
The Americus Club, 150 strong, wear
ing its handsome costumes of white,
ornamented with yellow, fell next in
line, headed by a drum corps. Major
K. S. Bangham was in charg?, mounted
on a fine sorrel. The officers of the
club wore floral decorations of yellow
marguerites and smilax in sashes and
epaulets, while the privates wore
smilax sashes and button-hole bou
quets of yellow marguerites. The offi
cers were mounted.
The Knights of Pythias were out in
full force in their full dress uniform
and added to the impressiveness of the
spectacle. They were awarded first
prize for best company displayâ a
handsome banner.
The Catalina Island Band preceded
the entry made by the Ancient Order
Vnited Workmen, which was one of
the most elaborate of the day. As es
cort the Monrovia Drill Team accom
panied the handsome float and exe
cuted intricate maneuvers along the
route. An escort of 250 members of the
order followed on foot. The float was

drawn by four grays and was entirely
a floral entry, being a pyramid of roses
and geraniums, surmounted by the em
blem of the orderâ an immense floral
anchor and shield. This float \ron sec
ond prize, a handsome banner, as a
Boat, and second prize, also a banner,
as second best display by any society.
Throop Polytechnic Institute made a
fine entryâ a six-in-hand coach drawn
by handsome bays. The* coach was
covered by dark yellow marigolds, with
wheels of the same, and it was occu
pied by ten pretty maidens wearing
white gowns, white capes, black poke
bonnets with plumes and yellow acces
sories. Six mounted boy outriders ac
companied this entry, wearing pictur
esque white and black costumes. The
harness was covered with yellow satin
and the general effect was elegant.
This tM.ik lirst prize in the six-in-hand
class, and also for the best display out
side of the public schools.
Hotel Green entered one of the finest
of the displays, a six-in-hand coach
drawn by white horses with white
satin harness. The coach was cov
ered by white and scarlet carnations,
interwoven with masses of smilax giv
ing prominence to the hotel colors
scarlet and green. Twelve pretty
guests of the hotel occupied the coach,
wearing white gowns, white hats with
scarlet trimmings, and white parasols
with scarlet ribbons. This entry was
awarded second prize for six-in-hands
â a beautiful banner.
Pasadena High. School took third
prize in this class. It had a six-in- j
hand coach, covered by red and white '
geraniums, with the figures " '98" in |
white on a Mack ground of red on the !
dashboard, and "Happy New Year" in ;
the same* effect on the back of the
coach. These decorations were most
profuse and artistically arranged.
Twelve school girls in pretty costumes
of red and white occupied the coach.
In the equestrian division Miss Dob
lyns won the first prize and Miss Eliot j
second among the ladies; A. M. Lind- ;
sey first and Charles Winston second I
among the gentlemen. This division
included forty ladies and gentlemen, all '
well mounted, their horses more or
less elaborately decorated with roses,
pinks, geraniums, daisies and smilax.
In the public school class the first
prize was awarded to Pasadena. In
cluding all entries of public schools.
South Pasadena won second prize with
a magnificent float representing a pair
of stairs covered with white eucalyptus
blossoms, upon which were seated
pretty children in white costumes and
wearing wreaths of flowers.
The High School Glee Club made a
unique entryâ a float representing a \
negro cabin which was occupied by
the sixteen members of the club in
grotesque darky costume. The flow- I
ers used were in great variety and ar- j
ranged in a hit-or-miss fashion, in- '
dirative of the supposed tastes of the !
Southern negro. The club rendered
many gweet selections on the way.
This took first prize as a novelty.
The Garfield School's two-seated sur
rey was very pretty with its bevy of i
little girls in white muslin, daisy I
wreaths and huge ruffs of pink and i
green, from which their pretty heads
rose up like flowers.
The Columbia School was attractive
ly represented by a bevy of little girls
on a three-seated buckboard, all at
tired in white tarlatan, with white
parasols and white Normandy caps.
Both of these entries were accompa
nied by boy outriders mounted on bicy
cles and clad in picturesque white and
blue sailor costumes. This received
third prize in the two-horse division.
Washington School entered a pictur
esque float upon which was erected a j
Maypole, around which were grouped
a number of pretty little maids in
fluffy white Mayday dresses.
The Franklin School attracted gen
eral attention and was greeted with ap
plause all along the line. Under the
name of the Marguerite Club, thirty of
the boys and girls of the Franklin
School, between the ages of eight and I
12. were mounted on bicycles trimmed
with smilax and roses. The girls wore
white gowns with yellow sunflowers
perched on their heads in place of hats,
the boys white suits to correspond.
Very skillfully these little ones man
aged their wheels along the tedious
line of march, and their ie.wation.? of
pure daisies were not fairer .han their
bright, flower-like faces. They were
awarded first prize in the bicycle divi
sion â a handsome lamp.
The second prize in this class was
given the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation escort. The Young Men's
Christian Association entered a mag
nificent float representing the interior
of a gymnasium, which was very real
istic, and a fancy exhibition with
dumbbells and Indian clubs was given
en route by the members of the asso
ciation in gymnasium costume. This
received first prize among floats.
The Fire Department, with decor
ated engine, hose cart and hook and
ladder truck, all buried under masses
of smilax and geraniums, received hon
orable mention.
The foregoing description covers the
most important of the larger entries,
but an endless procession of double
and single rigs, pony carts, tandems
and bicyclists followed. The decora
tions were unique and varied, and in
many cases lavish. The prize winners
in the double team division were: B.
O. Kendall, for a handsome surrey dec
orated with yellow marigolds and yel
low satin trimmings and smilax; first
prize, a cut-glass pitcher and glasses.
Lincoln School second, cut-glass
water bottle; Columbian School third.
In the single horse division Mrs.
Dolph Bassett took first prize for an
elegant low phaeton completely hidden
under masses of red geraniums and
smilax, the wheels of which were a
solid mass of these bright blossoms.
The occupants of the carriage wore
white gowns and black hats and car
ried red parasols and accessories. Mrs.
John Showalter took second prize for
an open phaeton profusely ornamented
with red roses and gmilax. The ladies
wore white dresses with red acces
sories. H. Edmund Earle took third
prize for a trap decorated in pink ger
aniums and smilax, pink satin covering
the harness on a fine black horse. Two
young ladies wearing white dresses
and wide leghorn hats and carrying
white parasols trimmed with pink ac-
rompanied the two p?ntlemen in the
trap, who wore whit-> tennis suits.
Fourth prize was awarded to Thad
deus Lr> we Jr. for an open surrey pro
fusely decorated with smilax and pom
setta.
George Frost received first prize for
the prettiest single-pony rig; Miss
Gould and Miss Jessie M. Baker first
and secrmd prizes for pony carriages,
their pony weighing less than 500
pounds.
J. R. Hill was awarded first prize for
a novelty exhibit, which was a pack
burro decorated in absurd yet pictur
esque style, escorted by two fancy
burro riders in grotesque costumes.
Bicycle awards were given Earle
Weight and Haas, the round-the-world
rider who was present and entered the
pageant on a prettily decorated wheel.
The parade covered nearly two miles
and was an hour passing a given point.
The town was crowded with visitors
from abroad, and press representatives
from all over the State and elsewhere
were numerous. They were handsome
ly entertained by the local press com
mittee at dinner at Hotel Green.
Among the papers represented were
the New York Herald. Chicago Times-
Herald, San Francisco Call, New York
Independent, Portland Leader, Los
Angeles Times. Herald, Record and
Express, Buffalo Express, the Califor
nia Independent, Redlands Facts and
Hueneme Herald.
Concerts were given during the afcer
noon in Hotel Green Park and Car
melita grounds, which were listened to
by thousands on foot or in carriages.
Seats were improvised everywhere
along Orange Grove avenue, where
waÃ the greatest crowd, and at the
parks, in orange groves and elsewhere,
where visitors might wish to rest in the
shade of the dense pepper trees.
Shortly before 2 o'clock a large con
tingent left for Athletic park, where
the sports were held. These were prin
cipally amateur and largely of local in
terest. The entries were numerous for
each event, and the prizes offered not
of great intrinsic value, but the vast
crowds were greatly amused and greet
ed each event with boisterous enthus
iasm. The summary follows:

FROM POVERTY
TO A BARONETCY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. I.â Clarence
Danvers Davenport, a young English
man who has been leading a hand-to
mouth existence in Portland since Aug
ust, has become a baronet. He receiv
ed a cablegram to-day announcing the
death of his uncle, Sir Richard Dan
vers of Danvers Court, Lincolnshire,
England, and informing him that he
had succeeded to the estate and title.
Money for the trip to England was
telegraphed him by American agents
of the estate, and he left to-night to
take possession of his inheritance.
After years of abject poverty, during
which no one but himself knows how
he managed to live, the change will
be very acceptable.
Davenport drifted into Portland last
August. He had been in Chicago, San
Francisco and a number of other
American cities. He came to America
Eroaa Australia. He brought a little
money t'Â» Portland, but it was soon
gone, and, although possessed of a
fine education, a noble aversion to
earning his own living prevented him
from seeking or obtaining work. How
he managed to eke cut an existence
will probably always be a mystery.
His only acquaintance in Portland
when he came was Editor Miller, of
the Pacific Empire, whom he met in
Chicago several years ago. Bit by bit
Mr. Miller learned his story. He had
been born near his uncles home in
Lincolnshire. He left home when 18
and for a time endeavored to earn his
living by newspaper work in London.
Although several editors pronounced
his work promising, and Jerome K.
Jerome advised him to stick to writ
ing, none of them expressed any wil
lingness to employ him or purchase any
of his productions, and after a few
months' struggling he gave it up and
sailed, for Australia, and afterward
came to America. He was a youth of
elegant tastes and habits, but he was,
nevertheless, forced to live an exis
tence which he would have considered
too mean for the poorest peasant on
his uncle's estate.
Just after reaching here he learned
that the death of a cousin had left him
heir to his uncle's estate, but as the
baronet was a healthy old gentleman
Davenport had little expectation of
succeeding him for a good many years.
He was too proud to let his family
know of his poverty-stricken condition,
although he kept up a regular corres
pondence with a brother. His address
thus being in the possession of his fam
ily, there was no difficulty in reaching
him with the news that will change
his life from that of a beggar to- that
of a baronet.

Clever Ruse of a San

Obtain Spirits.
Guard Sent to a Drugstore With

Special Dispatch to The Call.

SAN RAFAEL. Jan. I.â There is no
trick too clever for a convict within
the walls of the State's penitentiary at
San Quentin to conceive and carry into
effect for the smuggling of opium or
liquor past the prison walls. A clever
scheme has just been thwarted at this
place, by which liquors and pure alco
hol have been taken to San Quentin
and given to convicts by persons con
nected with the penitentiary in an of
ficial capacity, but who were unaware
of their part in the Illicit transaction.
There is a convict whose name is
given as Adams, who has? after hav
ing been detected, shown up the meth
od, which for its simplicity commends
itself. The convict has on several-oc
casions sent prescriptions to San Raf
ael by guards, and these have been
returned by the guards, who believed
that they were simply bringing medi
cine to the prisoner. The "medicine"
has been whisky and other spirituous
liquors, and the convict has taken them
"medicinally."
Last Thursday one of the prison peo
ple came to San Rafael with a pre
scription to be filled. The man took it
to Inman's drug store. He had been
given it by the convict and did not
know what it called for. In fact the
prescriptio-n was written in Greek and
Inman found it necessary- to have it
translated, appealing to Professor Kerr
of the Mount Tamalpais Military Aca
demy. The professor readily made the
contents known and to his surprise it
read as follows:
"One quart of alcohol. Please label
bottle 'For rheumatism; apply at
once.' "
The convict's purpose was simply to
procure the liquor for. himself, and tht?
label was to act as a deceiving inscrip
tion for the guard, who imagined that
he was taking medicine insiead of a
j beverage that the rules of the peniten
tiary prohibit inside the walls. The
money accompanied the prescription.
BOW many times the- convict had
succeeded in obtaining. liquor may
never be known. The discovery of the
Gr a ek prescription. calling for pure al
cohoj will probably put a stop to the.
practice and "medicine" at the prison
will be carefully inspected. ..".â â â ".

GRAND JURY ONCE MORE
INDICTS C. L WES TLAKE.
Fixes the Shortage of Monterey County 's
Former Collector of Taxes at
Over $8000.
SALINAS, Jan. I.â The Grand Jury
created a sensation here last evening
by bringing in an additional indict
ment against ex-Tax Collector C. L.
Westlake. charging him with a shortr
age of 55237 14 on the assessment roll
of 1896-7. He had already been in^
dieted on five counts for alleged short
ages in the license department, on one
of which he was acquitted after a trial.
The Grand Jury severely scores.:
County Auditor George S. Miller for â¢
"negligence which is so clearly in vio
lation of the law" that it considers it
its duty to file an accusation against;,
him. Nothing has heretofore been
said calling into question Miller's abil
ity or integrity as an officer. The
jury found a shortage of $1018 05 in
Assessor Anderson's office, which, it al-. .
lowed that official to make good.
Judge Dorn issued a bench warrant
for the arrest of Westlake and fixed
bail bonds at $10,000. He is now in
custody on the former charges, not
having been able to furnish bail.

A WOMAN'S
jlfEÃllfe
Interesting Experience of Mrs.
Lounsbury of Olyri)pia,
Remarkable Results From the Use of the New Stomach
; : v : â  . Medicine.
The practice of publishing medio;il
testimonials is certainly not a new one
in fact, the subject is well nigh thread-
bare, the '-olunms of every paper 1-cing
full of them. Nevertheless, occasionally
â  cade appears of so interesting and
remarkable a cha'ra ler as to merit
special attention. Of such a character
is the experience of Mrs. E. L. Louns-
bury of Olympia, in far off "Wash-
ington, who now resides at No. 11l
pie Park, in that city.
Mrs. Lounsbury's trouble was an ag-
gravated case of stomach trouble. She
says: I was very weak, could not sit
up in bed more than an hour at a time,
no appetite, eating the juice of rare
beef. My husband would have to read
to me until 2 or 'â '. o'clock in the morn-
ing before sleep would come; my heart
was weak and troublesome, gas would
collect in my stomach so that a num-
ber of times during the day I would be-
come almost helpless.
â  I saw the new stomach remedy,
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets, advertised
in the Christian Herald of Detroit, and
even now. after taking but one box, I
urn a good advertisement for them. I
sleep good, have a good appetite, my
heart is better, my nerves stronger. I
am gaining strength so fast that yes-
terday 1 walked seven blocks.

BERLIN, Jan. I.â A number of Con
servative leaders of the Reichstag,
notably Baron yon Manteuffel, Baron
\ i n tftumm and Count yon Mirbach,
have declared their intentions o( with
drawing from active politics during the
coming spring. This Is mainly due to
the growing strength of agratianism
within the Conservative ranks and the
hostile attitude of that movement to
ward the Government.
Art circles have been shocked to
learn that Herr Paul Wallot, the de
signer of the new Reichstag building,
has been forced out of the central com
mittee for the erection of a Bismarck
monument facing the Reichstag. Herr
Wallot insisted that the proper dis
tance which should intervene between
the monument and the building w&s 120
meters, while the Emperor decided
that sixty meters would suffice. The
rest of the committee sided with the
Emperor's decision, thus administering
a direct snub to Herr Wallot.
The fact that Dr. yon Stein, the
Catholic with decidedly liberal tenden
cies, has been appointed by the Regent
of Bavaria to be Archbishop of Munich,
has created a great sensation in ultra
montane circles. The Vatican does not
approve of the appointment, and pro
tests have appeared in the whole of
the ultramontane press.
The German Foreign Office formally
denies that the reciprocity negotiations
between Germany and the United
States have failed, and the hope is ex
pressed that the negotiations will
eventually result In mutual advan
tages, although it is maintained that
there must be a willingness shown
upon the part of America as well as
'ienniny in order to arrive at an un
derstanding.

Herald in the Herald office, of a remarkable scientific achievement. It
W is nothing less than the actual and in every way practicable trans- y

W brought his instrument to New York that an absolutely impartial W
g test might be made of It. The test was made in this office under strict â

PORTLAND. Ore., Jan. I.â The Mult
nomah and Portland football elevens
vainly endeavored to cross each other's
lines to-day in one of the roughest
games ever seen in Portland. Although
neither side scored some of the best
playing that either team has ever done
was brought out, but the game was
chiefly conspicuous for its brutality.
Excitement ran high, and in the last
half over 1000 people crowded down on
the side lines, and a number of per
sonal encounters took place between
ardent partisans of the opposing teams.
Several times each side had a touch
down in sight, which was only averted
by grit and hard work. In the second
half Portland claimed a touchdown,
but it was not allowed by the referee.
Stickney of Multnomah punted, and
Patton. Portland's full back, caught
the ball and returned the kick. The
ball sailed over the head of Jordan,
Multnomah's half, and he made sev
eral futile grabs at it. Downs of Port
land got the sphere before Jordan could
fall on it, and sped toward Mult
nomah's goal, but was tackled and
downed by Connor just as he crossed
the line. Jordan's assertion that he did
not touch the ball was supported by
the officials. Downs' play was declared
off-side, and the ball was brought back,
to the intense disgust of Portland's
sympathizers.
Multnomah's interference was the
best that team has ever put up. Clag
gett, the quarter, and Jordan, half,
played the star game for her. For
Portland, Wilbur, Patton, Downs and
Hamilton did the best work.
SELMA, Jan. 1. â The Modesto foot

JOHANNESBURG'S VICTORY.
Defeats Randsburg's Brawny Men in a New
fear's Football Game.
RANDSBURG, Jan. I.â The game of
xootball between Randsburg and Jo
hannesburg to-day -was a most ex
citing contest. Twenty players from
each camp took part. The kick-off was
from the divide of Gold Hill and was
won by Randsburg. Just as the ball
was headed for Johannesburg, the ball
was fouled by one of the local players.
Captain Archer of the Johannesburg^
steadied his men and In five minutes
had the ball over the divide and flying
toward the goal, located three-quarters
of a mile away. In twenty minutes
it was landed in the heart of this
camp, when the real work commenced
in earnest. Never was a game fought
harder on the gridiron than this one.
For twenty-five minutes the ball was
kept in a space of 300 feet on Butte

ball was kept moving. In the end
Randsburg's players yielded to the su

ponents.

of To-Day.

Cites th* Recent Performance of

DÂ«viÂ» and Others.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Jan. IâJohn E.
Madden, â¢who has owned and trained
both trotters and throughbreds and
who hdÂ« been successful with bnth
breeds of horses, does not agrge with
Crit Davta, Oil Curry, Frank McWy.
Major Daingerneld. R. M. Anderson
and other old trotting horse trainers
that the thoroughbred is racking in
stamina and â¢â¢miuranre. He takes is
sue with "Iconoclast," the well-known
trotting horse writer, who has made
the statement of Messrs. Davis and
others the subject of lons articles, in
which he tries to show that the trotter
is going forward and the runner back
ward in the matter of stamina. Mr.
Madden to-day gave out the following
signed statement, which shows that he
knows something of both the trotter
and the thoroughbred, and that he can
tell why he thinks the latter superior
to the former as a stayer when going
at his top speed:
I have read the opinions of Major Dain
geiiieU, Trit L>a\i.~, "3amp" Wilson,
Frank licVey and others, and I Bavo
read the articles from "iconoclast ba*od
'on these opinions. To bÂ« canflld, I must
admit that nothing la tht.-e articles or In
my past anel present experience satisfies
mr that the trotting horse of tn-day has
proved himself to bÂ« the superior of the
thoroughbred in stamina and endurance
âthat is, if the definition of these terms
bfl ability to maintain a high rate of
.speed.
To begin with, it is an extremely diffi
cult comparison to draw. If a hanit-i-s
horse could trot or pace a mile in 1:40.
or 1:45, the task would be easier. Until
the harness horse <.m do this it will be
largely a matter of conjecture to draw a
just comparison between the two.
While the races of to-day are shorter,
it must be remembered that the average
speed of thtm Is faster than ever, and
eurely this is not an evidence of 'legen
eration. Years ago a mile in 1:40 was
considered almost wonderful,; to-day it is
nothing remarkable. Ornament won thÂ«
Twin City Handicap, one mile, in 1.-W,
and the last quarter in 25 3-j seconds, and.
finished so strong that Taral. his rider,
believed he could have made the last
quarter in Â£Â» â ecoodii. Electioneer got his
best racing son and daughter, Palo Altn
and Expressive, out of thoroughbred
mares. Atmore, half thoroughbred, go.
the fast two-year-old Rowena; 2:17. out
of a thoroughbred mare. Half-thorough
bred Whips sired Azote, 2:04?*, and Cob
web, the fast gildiiiK. capable of pulling
a wagon close to I!. 10.
Because the thoroughbred of the pres
ent day is not asked to go v distance is
not an evidence that he cannot do so.
A number of sprinters of to-day can
beat the record of old-time long-distance
runners. An an instance of this, only a
few days ago, in California, the horse
Buckwa, who was known only as a
sprinter, was asked to go a mile and a
half, and he beat the world's record for
the distance, winning easily by six
lengths.
1 could name a dozen horses that
started in sprinting races in 1896 and 1897
that could beat the two and four mile
records of old. It is my experience thai
in point of stamina the thoroughbred has
no equal-
WALCOTT IS AFTER McCOY.
Willing to Go Out of His Class to Fight the
Clenr "Kid."
NEW YORK. Jan. I.â A $5000 check
has been posted for a contest between
Joe Walcott and "Kid" McCoy, who
aspires to the middleweight champion
ship. The cherk was drawn by Tom
O'Rourk<\ manager of Walcott, and
the conditions are that the fight must
be made at the middleweight limitâ
158 pounds.
"Walcott is the welterweight cham
pion," said O'Rourke, "and wants to
be the middleweight champion also. I
don't suppose McCoy wants to fight;
I think he is looking out for the theat
rical end of the game rather than for
pugilistic glory. But we are ready.
We will fight McCoy in six weeks and
oo Rlad to do it. We don't care whore
the f.ght comes off, nor when it comes
off, but we prefer that it be inside of
six weeks rather than inside of six
months."

Copyright, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Jan. I.â The threatened
invasion of Matanzas by insurgents
has begun. Detachments of their cav
alry have been pouring into the prov
ince from Santa Clara. It is said that
about 4000 rebels have crossed Hana
bala River into Matanzas Province
within the last few days. The Span
iards are moving large bodies of troops
forward to try to check the advance of
the insurgents westward.
As Colonel Cepero, who commands
the extreme vanguard of the Cuban
forces, crossed into Havana territory,
after traversing all the province of
Matanzas, the objective point of the
new invasion is thought to be near
Havana City. Spanish troops sta
tioned near the capital report every
day two or more engagements. It is
reported that there will be a concen
tration of Cuban forces in the imme
diate neighborhood of Havana. The
authorities are moving large columns
of troops to cover strategic positions
near the city.
Many people assembled at the palace
to-day to witness the swearing-in of
Senor Rafael Montero, Marquis of
Montero, Senor Francisco Zayas and
Senor Laureano Rodriguez as Secre
taries of the Provisional Government.
Marshal Blanco, the Captain-Gen
eral, escorted by a number of his
Spanish officials, consular corps, army
and navy officers, politicians, etc.,
reached the throne room at 9 o'clock
a. m. A new Bible was open on the
table and upon it the secretaries took
the oath of fidelity to the Queen, the
monarchy and the Spanish Govern
ment, placing their right hands on the
Bible and kneeling as they repeated
the words required.
NKW YORK, Jan. I.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The New
York Chamber of Commerce will be
officially invited by the State Depart
ment to aid in collecting relief for suf
ferers in Cuba. The plan of the de
partment contemplates the designa
tion by the chamber of a member who
shall act as treasurer of a committee
of three and represent the business in
terests of the country. The depart
ment proposes to invite Louis Kiop
smlth of New York to act as a second
member of the committee and as a
representative of the religious element
of the country, and Miss Clara Barton
will represent the Red Cross Society.
Mr. Adee, Second Assistant Secretary
of State, was in consultation with Miss
Barton to-day in regard to the plan to
be pursued in the collection and dis
tribution of relief supplies. Mr. Adee
told me this afternoon that he was con
vinced that charitable persons of this
country would respond liberally to help
the suffering people of Cuba. Since the
publication of the President's procla
mation $7000 has been subscribed. It
is understood that General Lee has re
ceived several contributions by tele
graph, but no knowledge of their char
acter or value has been received.
It is hoped and believed that the New-
York Chamber of Commerce will ac
cept the invitation of the State De
partment. The chamber can aid
enormously if it will. There are many
trades organizations and business men
who will contribute when they know
that a safe channel has been provided
through which their gifts may be sent.
INJURED ON THE GRIDIRON.
Wheattand Football Player Receives a Fatal
Fracture of the Spins.
MARYS VI LLE, Jan. I.â During: the
last half of the football game played
here to-day between the Marysville
Athletic Club's eleven and a Wheat
land team, Clyde Manwell, who played
quarter back for the visitors, received
injuries that in the opinion of his phy
sicians will prove fatal. His spinal
column is fractured at about the fourth
vertebra, necessitating placing . the
neck and shoulders in a plaster paris
cast. He may live until morning.
When carried from the field he was
paralyzed from the neck down. He
was at the bottom of the heap in one
of the scrimmages.

Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SONOMA, Jan. I.â The funeral of
Sydney N. Johnson was held this aft
ernoon at 3:30 o'clock, the remains be
ing interred in Valley Cemetery. Rev.
C. E. Chase presided.
This morning the county undertaker
came down from Santa Rosa to take
charge of the remains, but sufficient
money was raised in town to give
Johnson a decent burial and spare him
the pauper's grave. The officials have
received no new light, but the news
paper reporters have been diligently at
work. To-day several citizens were
interviewed and some pointers which
may lead to his identity gained. Sev
eral months ago, when conversing with
a new-made friend, who will not allow
his name to be published and who was
interviewed to-day by The Call corre
spondent, Johnson spoke more freely
of himself than at any other time. He
said that at one time, not giving the
year, he was in Chihuahua. Mexico,
and that he was a guest of the Ameri
can Hotel in that place. He gave accu
rate descriptions <:f the buildings and
the streets, and was well informed on
the history of the place and could cor
rectly describe the surrounding coun
try. He evidently knew whereof he
spoke, and was, as he claimed, famil
iar with the place.
j Judging from this conversation with
I his new-made friend, twelve or four-
I teen years ago Johnson was in the vi
cinity of the Colorado Indian reserva
tion, situated on the Colorado River
I and lying in both California and Ari
', zona. He spoke of post settlers whose
I history was k-nown to the gentleman
, with whom he was conversing, but he
never spoke of his reasons for being in
that country. The purport of his con
versation led his friend to believe that
he was at some time connected witn
the army there.
Johnson said that he was acquainted
with Barney Farley, the well-known
' pugilistic trainer of San Francisco.
The name of Johnsons hatter was
neatly cut out of the silk lining of his
i hat. but to-day the name of John B.
I Stetson & Co., Philadelphia, was found
I stamped on the leather band on the in
side of the hat. The name 'â¢Green"
was also found written with a leqd
! pencil on the inside of his valise, . hut
it does not resemble the hand* writing.'
;on the hotel register. The Call cc>rre :
spondent learned to-day that Johnson
claimed to have had his clothes that
he wore made at O. W. Nordwell's,
218 Bush street, San Francisco. Last
June some ypurig men who. were visft
' ing here from San Francisco, but
whose names are not how known, re

years, awoke the residents of this city
and vicinity shortly after 5 .o'clock
this morning:. The shocks were of
about twenty-five seconds duration,
and the vibrations were from west to
east. No damage has been reported.

tossed about during the running like a
hay scow in a typhoon. Collins went
out and made the running until the
stretch was reached the second time,
and the real pinch commenced. Then
it was that the Corrigan duo moved
up. Below the paddock it looked as
though they would finish one-two.
Cash Sloan was now hard at work on
Marquise, and the mare responded
nobly to his asking. A hundred yards
from home the daughter of Miser was
on equal terms with Can't Dance, and
at the wire she won comparatively
easily by a head. Can't Dance was
second, a head before The Bachelor.
The Ingleside record for the distance,
3:34%, was reduced to 3:29%.
"Skeets" Martin will be kept out of
the saddle for some time by an acci
dent which happened to him in the
first race. With the leg up on Soniro
he was kicked by Elano, having a
good-sized gash cut in his leg.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry, Ed
die Jones, with Thorpe in the sad
dle, downed the even-money choice,

nearly dark when the race was run. |
and, as nobody saw the foul, it was ;
allowed. Under the new ruling' Jones |
was placed second instead of last. The
decision suited the western "push." as
they were all aboard Torsida.
The start in the opening event, a
six-furlong, selling sprint, vas delayed
some minutes owing to an accident to
H. Martin, who had the mount on So
niro. While the horses were lining up
I at the barrier Elano elevated his heels
and caught Martin on the fleshy part
of the right leg, cutting a deep gash.
He was replaced after* some delay by
Conley. Sir Richard and Chappie
headed the 11-to-5 favorite, Miss Ross,
for a piece when sent away. b\M
Thorpe soon sent her to the front, and
I she won cleverly from Soniro. The
poorly ridden Towanda, second choice,
was third.
Imp. Tripping, though made a 7-to-5
choice for the second evfnt run, a six
furlong sprint, plainly showed lack of
form, and, getting away non? too well
to a straggling start, finished third.
Traverser, second choice in the ring,
with Clawson up. led throughout and
won with nothing to spare from St.
Calatine in 1:14^.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1898.
The short course steeplechase looked
nothing more than a barefaced steal,
and these disreputable affairs should
find no place on the programme of any
legitimate racing organization. Six
started, one, the good-thing Reno, fin
ishing all by himself. Sliverado, the
second choice, was ridden by one jump,
and in like manner Captain Rees pass
ed another. Esperance finally finished
second, and Silverado turned back and
galloped over the course and eventu
ally took third money.
Misfortune overtook the black colt
Oscuro, the 8 to 5 favorite for the mile
and a furlong selling run, fifth on the
card. Apparently laboring from the
start, he broke down at the head of the
stretch. San Marco, the second choice,
with Thorpe up, headed Walter J as
the stretch was reached and stalling
off the challenge of the fast-coming
Little Cripple, a 20 to 1 shot, won by
over a length in 1:55%. Show honors
went to Walter J.
J. M. Murphy started in the new
year well by* taking the six furlong
sprint which followed, with George
Rose. The colt went to the post a 2 to
1 choice over a field of ten, and com-
ing game and true at the end downed
Barney Schreiber's Sorrow a head.
Highland Ball, away from the post
badly, made a fine run, finishing a
close third. Scotch Rose made the run
ning to the stretch, where she blew up,
as usual.
At a meeting held by the Board of
Stewards of the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club some few nights ago it was de
cided to bar all vicious horses from
starting. Win. Murray was notified
that Thornhiil would not be allowed to
face the barrier, and Elano will now
be added to the list no doubt after his
performance yesterday.
Barney Schreiber backed Marquise
all around the ring and is reported to
have won $5000 by her victory.
The little curtain lecture adminis
tered to Dick Clawson by the judges
evidently did the youngster good. He
is now riding in something like his old
time form.
It is .only a question of time when
the layers of odds will quit booking on
the jumping races. The money they
pay out is only purloined, and no one
will blame them.
THE OWL'S COMPANY.
A Joyous Feast at the Boherrjian
Clvb â Messages of Good Will
The Owl's invitation to the Christ
mas feast of the Bohemian Club on
new year's night announced that the
dinner wootd begin at 6:30 p. m. and
continue indefinitely. The banquet was
in the old, old fashion with much cheer
and little ceremony. The tables were
spread to accommodate 150, and that
number joined in the festivities of the
f^ast. The music, vocal and otherwise,
was inspiring, the speeches were
happy and not too long, and the de
portment of aspirants for the presi
dency of the club was above criticism.
Messages of good will by wire were
received from Henry Irving in London,
Hugo Toland in New York and Joseph
D. Redding and Lcruls Sloss Jr. at
Monte Carlo. In honor of the banquet
the house was nobly decorated.
OLD-TIME BURGLARS
Residence of Mrs. BurKe Robbed
Last Thursday Evening.
The residence of Mrs. Burke, at 1922
Franklin street was entered Thursday
evening by burglars. An entrance was
effected by prying open the front door.
A valuable silver toilet set was taken,
as well as several costly articles of
Jewelry.
The polire, who are hot on the trail
of the men, are of the opinion that
they are old hands at the business. It
is supposed they are the same men
who have made several big hauls in
that neighborhood within the past few
weeks.
An Uokoown Mar) Drowned.
The body of an unknown man, evident
ly that of a laborer, was found floating
in the bay off the "Devil's Hole." about
three-fourths of a mile from Hunter's
Point yesterday afternoon by a man
named John Hubacher. The man ap
pears to be about 50 years of age, is al
most entirely bald, has a dark mustache
streaked with gray, and was dressed in
dark-colored coat and trousers, with a
bluish-tinted shirt. A common drinking
glass and a piece of a caseknife weFe
found in the water near the body and
another caseknife and an awl were in
the trousers pockets. The man lay near
the foot of a steep bluff, and the sup
position is that he was digging pieces of
rock out of the bluff for assaying pur
pose's when he fell. The man had -been
in the water for about . two' days. On
the back of an advertising card the name
of Schmitt could be deciphered. In the
pn.kft. also, was a ticket of the French
laundry at 409 Fourth street, numbered
360.

HIS HOPE IS
FADING FAST
Durrant Seems to Believe
That Escape Is Im
possible.
â¢
He Spends His Time in Writ
ing, but No One Knows
What It Is.
Invitations for the Execution Have
Been Issued by the Warden
of the Prison.
Durrant, according to the state
ments of his guards, has at last real
ized that there is no escape from the
gallows. The condemned man several
times yesterday in his statements to
the three men who are watching him
in the death chamber said he would
in a few days solve the mystery of the
great beyond. The prisoner talked but
little to his guards during the day, but
when he would converse with them his
words were all of the life after the
grave.
He had no visitors except a few of
the prison officials, and he greeted each
of them by wishing them a happy new
year. He spent most of the day in
writing, and kept on turning out page
after page of manuscript until well
into the night. He has be^n writing
ever since he came into the prison, and
every Sunday when his father calls on
him a big bundle of manuscript is car
ried away. No one at the prison knows
what his writing is, but It Is befleved
to be a history of the celebrated mur
der case in which the doomed man is
the central feature. As he was writing
early to-night the strains of music
were carried on the still night air to
his cell. It was a serenade by a quar
tet of female prisoners who occupy
quarters not far from the big red
building where the murderer is waiting
for the march to the gallows. 'â¢Life Is
Ebbing Fast Away" was the song the
women sang, and its notes came faint
ly into the room wh-re the condemned
man sat.
He dropped his pen when he heard
it and sat with his chin on his breast
until the last words of the song died
away. Then he pushed his paper and
pens aside and, taking up his Bible,
gazed vacantly at the open leaves for
THE SHERIFF'S INVITATION.
nearly an hour. His thoughts were far
away from the verses before him.
Then he put the book away and for
some time he paced his cell before he
returned to his writing.
But while the prisoner slowly counts
the hours that separate him from the
day set for h'ia death his attorneys are
trying every legal quirk or quibble in
their efforts to delay the fatal day un
til they can find more legal points to
bring up before the court to ask for
more delay. It is all technicality now.
but there are lots of technicalities, and
there will be more before the sun rises
on the date of sentence.
The Supreme Court has denied the
application for a writ of supersedeas,
but that has not dampened the ardor
of counsel for Durrartt. They are used
to denials of motions and applications,
and they see in the denial only another
chance for technicalities; the result of
their efforts appear<-d yesterday after
noon when Mr. Hoardman applied for a
new kind of writ; this time it was a
writ of error, and on the denial of it, a
course which every one is sure will
follow, he will apply to the United
States Circuit Court for a writ of
habeas corpus. This, too, will be de
nied, and no one expects otherwise,. and
then there will come an appeal to the
United States Supreme Court for a
writ or an order or a citation or any
thing the judges shall be pleased to
give, so long as it stays the execution
until another date of sentence has
passed.
â¢It may be that' the judges of the
lower United : States courts will not en
tertain the motions of- the attorneys,
but that will be provided for by hav
ing a man at Washington who will at
price bring the matter to the atten
tion of the higher court and so have i
âº the case heard despite the refusal -of |
the - local judges to r-onsider it.
The writ of Buperse<leas just denied !
was based upon the general grou:id i
that Judge Bahrs had ho juriftdlcticm
in the case, and, therefore, had .not the ,
power to sentence Durfant to deatn.
I These points had already been passed ,
upon in the denial of the application
for a writ of probable cause, and noth
ing: but a denial was expected, but
there was a chance for a delay in it
and it served its purpose for a time.
The order denying the writ was signed
by Chief Justice Beatty, and Jus-ices
Temple, Garoutte and McFarland. The
denial of an application for such a
writ, under ordinary circumstances, is
cause for an appeal to the Federal Su
preme Court, and so it is thought that
the denial may result in another delay
by such an appeal.
Warden .Hale has issued 160 invita
tions to peace officers, physicians,
newspaper representatives and attor
neys who have prosecuted and de
fended Durrant to witness the appli
cation of the death penalty. The com
plete list of those who will receive the
cards was made out fully a week ago,
and the Warden says no additions will
be made to it.
For the past week every mail re
ceived at the prison has brought a big
batch of applications for cards giving
admission to the gallows room, and
every one of them has been refused.
Warden Hale says it will be useless for
any one to apply for the coveted cards,
as it will be his unpleasant duty to
deny them all.
The cards that were issued on the
last occasion when Durrant was so
near the gallows will not be honored
next Friday. The cards are small,
black-bordered paste-boards, the let
tering being done with a mimeograph.
ANOTHER CANCER CURED.
Interest being aroused by the strik
ing cures of Dr. Chamley, a reporter
visited Mrs. G. P. Lee, a pleasant lady,
at 329 Ellis street. She said:
"I suffered eight years from a deep
seated cancer of the breast, reaching to
theribs. After various treatments, with
out permanent benefit, I consulted Dr.
Chamley, 719 Market street. His treat
ment began November 24, and Christ
mas I was out and walked six blocks.
The cancer was removed without pain,
and when it dropped out the circum
ference of the opening was 22^ inches.
I am gaining strength rapidly." Mrs.
Lee can be seen at her residence any
evening.
A. J. Baird. 2716 McAllister street, a
well-known citizen, said:
"I was cured eight years ago by Dr.
Chamley. and I hope every sufferer
will obtain his services."
ANNUAL MINT COINAGE.
Uncle Sam Gives ai) flccour)t of
His Yearly Money-MaKing.
The December coinage at the San

ard dollars $430,000, half dollars $60,000,
quarter dollars $22,857, dimes $19,000; sil
ver. $551,857. Total for the month of De
cember, $4,129,357.
The total coinage for the year ending
December 31 is as follows:
Ix.uhle eagles $29 .405.000. eagles $2,347,500.
half e.-igles $1.771 .000; total gold, $33,522,500.
Standard dollars $5,825,000. half dollars

The coinage during the past year ex
ceeded that of the previous year by
$4,000,000, and this amount has been
only twice exceeded since the United
States Mint was established in San
Francisco.
The total number of pieces coined
during the year was: Gold, 2.059,000;
silver, 8,643,973; making a grand total
of pieces coined 10.702,973.
This increases the deposit In Uncle
Sam's vaults to a considerable sum.
In addition to these figures there is
about $4,000,000 of gold bullion awaiting
the coining process; this, as a matter
of course, will come into next year's
coinage.
SWINDLED THE MATRON
Mrs. Ford Robbed of Three Dollars
by a Scheming Strarjger.
The police are looking for an old man
who swindled Mrs. Ford, matron of
the Girls' Training Home at 514 How
ard street, out of $3. Last Thursday
the Bwlndler visited Mrs. Ford and said
he had a daughter who would arrive in
a few days from the interior. He
wanted her to take her under her pro
tecting wing and promised to pay
handsomely for her trouble.
After making arrangements for her
reception the stranger said that there
was $3 due on her baggage and asked
Mrs. FfÂ»rd to loan him that amount
until he cashed a check for $500, which
he showed her. The unsuspecting wo
man gave him the money and he prom
ised to call again on the fallowing day.
Since then he has not been seen. The
police, are convinced that he is the man
who recently swindled a number of wo
men by similar methods.
New Pulpit Dedicated.
. At the mid-day service in St. Stephen's
Episcopal Church yesterday the elegant
new pulpit presented by Mrs. George
Swarttiguer in memory of her father.

flffure three feet in height, representing
our Lord as the good shepherd* Rang.cd
around the top are figures representing
the four evangelistsâ Matthew, Mark.
Luke and John, each appropriately posed
and bearing a fitting emblem "of his
work .while on earth.
The s-ermon was preached by the rector.
Rev. Edgar J. Lion, and was especially
appropriate to the Now Year.

ELECTRICITY FOR
USE IN WARFARE
Several Novel Inventions Sub
nnitted by an Enthusiastic
Ohio Man.
Ona Is a Sword Connected With a
jy Battery and Another Is a Lassoe
of Pliant \Vire.
Specia! Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. Iâ A Washington
special to the Herald says: Brigadier-
General Flagler, chief of ordnance of
the army, is in receipt of several, very
novel war propositions from an en
thusiastic electrician, who hails from
Ohio. One of the applances is called,
by the inventor an electric sword. The
inventor observes in his letter that he
has not yet applied for patents,, pre
ferring to give the Government the ex- :
elusive use and control of. .his inven
tions. The sword is described as .being
an ordinary saber, but from, the blade
near the hilt runs an insulated "wire, 7 .
connected with a small battery, to bg ;
carried either in the cavalryman's
pocket or attached to his. saddle. A.
button to control the current is ptaiced
on the hilt of the sword. In action,
says the inventor, when the soldier is
in a position to strike an adversary. he
will press the button and if the weap
on should touch the sword or -body ;of :
his enemy the full . current will be .
communicated and "the enemy- would
be so stunned that he could be easily
dispatched.
Another scheme of the same inven
tor is a kind of lasso of pliant wire,
connected with a battery in the..pbeket
of a soldier, the controlling button be^.
ing placed just outside the box con
taining the battery, the insulated wire
being coiled closely about the -soldier's
arms. At the end of the wire is. to be
attached to a rod constructed of mate-.
rial which is a good conductor of elec
tricity. The primary design- of " this :
invention, the Ohio man ' says, is .'to â 
break up cavalry or infantry 'square's;.'"
In a rapid advance, the wire is to be
thrown in the midst .of the opposing
troops, the current being at the sairie !

LITTLE OLYMPIC
TEAM DEFEATED
Green C Eleven Won the Foot
ball Match at Recreation
Park.
The little lightweight Olympic foot
ball team (formerly Y. 11. C A.) was
outplayed and defeated yesterday aft
ernoon at Recreation Park by the
heavier Gre'-n C eleven, in a game
partly %vorthy of excitement only in the
: 1 half, when Green C, by fiercely
bucking the center, scored twice
Ht experienced opponents, who
would have been less vulnerable had
th. y practiced low tackling. The score
waÂ« 10 to 0.
In the first half the contest was fea
tbretaM and fairly even, little Evans
balancing by hie well placed kicks the
1 Rains by runs made by Green
â  icks.
With no score yat by either side
Jreen G pleased its following in the
pram! stand and on the field by be
coming very aggreÃHive as soon as the
second half opened. Once Olympic,
after being .bucked arid skirted for i,
continuous gain of eighty -yards, made
a remarkable- stand within the five
yard line and. there took the ball on
downs. Soon after a similar and al
most successful defense Was developed
at the critical moment. And the won
der was why such playing had not
been done before there remained but a.
feiv feet of territory to defend.
i The character of the play may be
Judged from the fact that there i were
in. the first half only fifty plays, where
in a match -without tedious delays pre
ceding each, play there should be : 100.
In the second half there were fuity
seven plays, where there, might have
been eighty! or ninety. In the first half
Green C executed thirty-six plays, in
cluding five kicks, and -gained sixty
yards by runs and 125 yards by kicks,
made two fumbles; Olympic executed
fourteen plays, including, four kicks,
and made fifty-five yards by runs and
100 yards .by kicks. In the â  second half
Green C executed forty plays, including
one kick, made one fumble and gained
170 yards by runs and : ; twenty-five
yards by kicks; Olympic executed sev
en plays, including three ; kicks, and
gained six yards by runs and 105 yards
by kicks. ; : - .
: Evans for Olympic and McXevin for
Green C were probably the most de- :
servedly noticeable players in the game.
Last year: these two teams played a
tie game. Yesterday's match, with the
exception of. a defeat by the Berkeley
freshmen this past season, was the
first and the most convincing reverse
that the lightweight team has had in
over four years, though, as yesterday,
it has almost always conceded consid
erable weight to opponents. 1 ' â¢â¢â  .- -â¢

Company H. yesterday afternoon -Was
awarded the championship of the
League of the Cross football tourna
ment, after defeating Company O's
representatives by a score of 26 to 0.
The deciding game was played at the
California L. iÃue grounds, Sixteenth
and Folsont streets, before a small but
enthusiastic crowd.
Company H won the contest by
clever all-round play, outclassing Com
pany O at every point of the game.
In the first half the winning team
scored three touchdowns, of which two
were converted ihto goats, making
sixteen points. In the second half D.
Ahearn got the ball on a fumble and
carried it fifteen yards to a touchdown.
Moreno kicked th- goal. After bring
ing the ball to within ten yards of O'a
line on the next kjekoff Moreno was
pushed over, scoring another touch
down, which he converted into a goal.
Erlenheim made the longest run of
the clayâ a 2">-yard dash through a
scattered field to a touchdown.
Stack, right end for Company O,
played the star game for his team. He
was in every play and was speedy in
getting down the field on kicks. Cap-*
tain Fanning of the, same team set a
good example for his men by playing
the hardest kind of football.
The view of the game for those in
the grand stand was spoiled by the
male contingent crowding on the field
close to the players.

THE SAX FRASTCIBCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1898.
SHORT ENDERS
GOT THE FLAG
Coursing at Ingleside Was
Hard on the Talent
Engaged.
Seven Out of Nineteen All-Aged
Favorites Lost Their
Chances.
Largest Crowd for Some firne-Re
sulta of the Run Downs in the
Two Events.
The talent had a hard time at Ingle-
Bide Coursing Park yesterday, seven,
out of the nineteen short-enders in the
run down of the All Age stake winning
the flag. The largest crowd that ever
attended a meeting at Ingleside on a
Saturday or holiday witnessed the
sport and the money went into the pool
boxes in liberal quantities.
The class of dogs entered in the two
stakes were unusually high owing to
the fact that the management had
added an extra amount to the entrance
money. In the main the contests were
close and the courses long and gruel
ing. There were dogs present from
Santa Clara, Sacramento, Port Costa
and from Colorado in addition to the
pick of the hounds owned in this city.
The troubles of the talent began in
the first race when Flashlight beat
Joybells, a warm favorite at 2 to 1. The
dose was repeated in the third race,
in the seventh, eighth, ninth and seven
teenth and came to a climax in the
eighteenth when Duke of Oak Grove,
a San Jose dog, beat speedy Granuale
when selling on the short end at 1 to 4.
Rusty Gold, winner of the second prize
at the recent Merced meeting, beat
Magnet, who Is credited with winning
more money in the parks that any
dog that has been running in the past
year.
There were two events on the card
and All Age stake of thirty-eight dogs
and a Puppy stake containing twenty
four candidates for money and honors.
The rundown was all that was accom
plished in either event and the ties and
finals will be run off to-day. ' Follow

Unsolicited, but lacking none the
less in fervency of statement, come
refutations frcm pationts at the City'
and County Hospital who have taken
umbrage at the statement of Dr. Buck
ley, made in a morning paper, to the
effect th.it ali who are taking Dr.
Hlrschfelder's oxytuberculin are being
â lowly poisoned. The answers to Dr.
Buckley's charges take the form of in
dividual letters to The Call, accom
panied by the statement that all are
undergoing the treatment voluntarily
and leave off taking it whenever they
feel so inclined. They embrace the op
portunity to take a general whack at
the hospital table fare with a ven
geance.
The names of the writers are David
Harrison, Thomas P. Larkin, Frederic
Tedtmeier, Edward Delee. F. D. Rob
erts and John P. Anderson. They all
express gratitude at the benefit they
have received from the medicine, and
, not only say they have come to !
Hlrschfelder's defense as a matter of
common gratitude, but strongly infer
their fear that the "unwarranted at
tacks" made on the physician may
lead to a cessation of their treatment '
by somebody or other interfering.
Tedtmeier states that he went to the
hospital, expecting to die, but im
proved immediately upon the lymph j
being injected into his system, and has
continued to improve until to-day he i
comes near being a well man.
Anderson asserts that on his arrival
at the institution he was so weak he
could hardly stand. At that time he
weighed 133 pounds, but has now in
cr-ased ir. wH S ht to 150 pounds, has
got rid df a severe cough and other i
symptoms of pulmonary disease and
"wants everybody to know it."
I-arkin asseverates that he was also
greatly reduced in weight and felt very
.l.s.ouraged but to-day has his normal
weight and feels like a new man after
undergoing the treatment.
Harrison believe, the article of Dr
Buckley to have been'venomous with
?Â£' te \. ?e? c Bays his condition was such ,'
that he had been advised before coming
here from Vallejo that there was nZ
hope left. "After three months' trear
ment, ' he writes. "I Mt so strong that
I thought I could pull through a hoa-
P l tal , J dlet -" He th'nks Dr. Buckley
should devote his time to improving
that same diet instead of making at
tacks on Hirschfelder.
Delee says he has undergone the
treatment for a month. Prior to that
time he could not walk a block without
being out of breath. He was losing in
weight, suffering from night sweats
and coughing continually: "To-day "
he writes, "all these distressing symp
toms have disappeared and I can
â 55"* "Â£" Â£ running up Uvo flints of
Roberts wants "no protection from
the public" in his. He Rays he went to
the hospital to die, as one lung was
gone and the other "a shred." Hirsch
felder. according to the writer, at first
refused treatment, on the ground that
he could not give a man new lungs
The patient insisted on treatment and
notwithstanding the fact that he suf
fered from a complication of other
diseases and had fallen from an
eighty-six-foot bridge, he claims to be
progressing rapidly on the road to ;
health.
Thus, it can be seen that whether or
not Dr. Kuhlman. the great polemist,
is to have opposition to his fight
against Hirschfelder in the County
Medical Society or not, the man tha"t
fell from a bridge and the others out at
the City and County Hospital are pre
pared to gird up tht-ir loins and go
forth to battle for oxytuberculin and
Hirschfelder. Backley or no Buckley.
Good Reports From Humboldt County.
A. H Buhne of Eureka is a recent ar
rival at the Grand. He is a pioneer steam
boal man of Humboldt Bay and is re-
IÂ»im>d a millionaire. Mr. Buhne is in
terested in many of the most important
enterprises of his county. He reports ex
cellent prospects in that locality for the
coming year. The weather has recently
bean exceptionally good, with sufficient
rain and no cold storms. There is a
scarcity of livestock, owing to the good
prices to be obtained for beef cattle.
The great dairy centers of Humboldt
County wore never in better condition
than at present, butter retailing at 2
cents a pound and the creameries run
ning at their full capacity. The ship
yards have all they can do and the rod
wood shingle factories, with daily in
creasing Eastern orders, are experiencing
the effects of business revival. The Gov
ernment Improvements In the harbor
have stood the test of storms, and ves
sels of all sorts can now enter the harbor
of Eureka in safety.

EXPLANATION. -
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig-
ures at station indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath.it. if any. the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow in Inches
and hundredth? during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, ,or dotted lines, equal i
temperature. . The wind "high" .means high j
barometic pressure and Is usually accompanied
With fair weather; "low" refers to low pres-
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. | "Lows" usually j
nrst appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the Interior and â  low
' along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, ruin Is probable:
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im-
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the, Cali-
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer aÂ»d colder weather in winter! The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result. . â¢

DEATH WAS
HER NEW
YEAR'S GIFT
Rosa Aston's Awful
Fall From a Two-
Story Window.
Only Yesterday Morning
in the Full Blush of
Health.
Was Making a Wounded Sis
ter's Bed at the Time of
the Accident.
MEDICAL AID AVAILED NOT
Circumstances Surrounding the Sad
Case â The Body at an
Undertaker*.
Only yesterday, aglow with strength
and happiness, hardly a care to mar
the peace of her mind; in the after
noon pale and silent, under the shadow
of the death anpel's wing. That is the
sad fate of Rosa Aston, who fell from
the second story window of the house
at 411 Tenth street yesterday after
noon and was instantly killed.
Rosa Aston was just 24 years old and
lived with her sister at 411 Tenth
street. Her sister is Mrs. James Grif
fin, who shot herself while in a fit of
despondency or temporary insanity
about a month ago.
Of late the woman has made good
strides on the way to recovery and the
dead girl had been in attendance upon
her. Yesterday she was going blithely
about the kitchen while engaged in
cooking a meal. About 3 p. m. she
went upstairs to make her sister's bed.
She had barely entered the room
when the sharp scream and the sound
of a thud, as of some heavy body
striking the pavement, startled the
people in the vicinity. They rushed to
the spot and there, the girl lay, the
blood oozing from her mouth and nos
trils.
Dr. James Frost was immediately
summoned, but arrived too late. The
girl was dead long ere he appeared on
the scene. The Coroner's oflire was at
once notified of the occurrence and
Deputy Hallett responded to the call.
What he discovered at the place of the
accident led him to waive certain priv
ileges and permit the body of the Kill
to be taken to an undertaking estab
lishment direct.
From all that can be learned the
death of the girl was purely acciden
tal. The bed on which Mrs. Griffin
lay was near an open window and the
window was very low. The girl proba
bly started to go round the bed and
for some reason or other leaned out of
the window and lost her balance. She
fell a distance of about twenty feet and
death must have followed almost in
stantly. Only an autopsy can disclose
the full extent of her injuries, but it
is believed that the girl's back was
broken by thÂ« fall.

STEAMER GENOA
STRIKES ON SEAL IS LA ND.
The Vessel Is Abandoned and the Crew
Leaves in Boats, Some of Which
Are Yet Missing.
HALIFAX, N. S., Jan. I.â The steam
er Genoa from Portland, Me., bound to
London, with 4M horses and a gen
eral cargo, struck on Seal Island this
morning during thick weather. She
floated immediately, and on the pumps
being sounded it was found that she
had fifteen feet of water in her hold.
The captain decided to abandon the
ship and all hands took to the boats.
The second officer, named Waltson,
and twenty-three of the crew, reached
Forbes Point, Woods Harbor, at non
to-day. The remainder of those on
board. Including Captain Baxter and
thirty-six others, headed for Seal Isl
and. Whether they have reached there
is not yet known, according to advices
received late to-night from Barrington,
as the weather and water are very
rough and it has been impossible to
communicate with Seal Island.
Unless Catain Baxter and the re
mainder of the crew, who steered for
Seal Island, have succeeded in reach
ing shore before this time it is feared
they will never do so. as a heavy gale
has been blowing almost constantly
since yesterday. They had, however,
as good a chance of saving themselves
as the men who have been heard from
and it is expected they are safe on
Seal Island.
TRIAL OF CONSTANT FOR
THE MURDER OF COSTRO.
'any Sensational Incidents, and Several
Former Police Officials Implicated
in the Crime.
Copyright, 1858, by James Gordon Bennett.
BUENOS AYRES. Jan. I.â The trial
of Bramanim Constant, son of the fam
ous Brizilian statesman, for the mur
der of General Gentil Costro, is under
way in Rio Janeiro, says the Herald's
correspondent of that city. There
have been m;my sensational incidents
in the trial thus far, and it has ap
peared that several men, formerly po
lice officials, were implicated in the
murder.
Traffic in Argentina has been prac
tically suspended, as a result of the
strike of engine drivers. There have
been several riots as a result of the
strike.
Dr. Sanarelli has been invited by
Brazilian physicians to lecture in San
Pablo on his discoveries regarding the
yellow fever.
DEVOTION OF MISS VOORHIES
TO JAMES B. HAGGIN.
Had She Been the Multi-Millionaire's Daugh
ter She Could Not Have Been
More Attentive.
LEXINGTON, Ky , Jan. I.â During
much of the past two years Mr. Hag
gin has been scarcely able to walk,
and at such times his first wife's niece,
now his bride, was very solicitous
about him. She waited on him like a
daughter, and when his meals were
pent up to his room she served them
to him. The devotion she showed to
h ; m was a matter of general comment
ai the hotels where they stayed in their
travels, and not a fow persons believed
thorn to be father and daughter. Dur
ing the long trips they took together in
his private car she is said to have been
fu/ly as attentive to him as she was in
the hotels, and when the report that
they were to be married gained circula
tion the last year there were a few who
did not believe it. The venerable miner
and turfman was a most devoted lover
and since the Ist of November he has
scarcely left his sweetheart's side for
as much as a day at a time.
BUILDING BURNED
AND OWNER MURDERED.
Remains Found in the Cellar Partly Burned
and With a Bullet Lodged in
the Skull.
WICHITA, Kan., Jan. I.â A special
to the Eagle from Kay Center, O. T.,
says: The residence of W. S. Carver,
one mile east of Kay Center, was
burned to the ground early this morn
ing. Carver's remains were found in
the cellar partly burned, with a bullet
lodged in his skull.
The Coroner is now "holding an in
quest. R. S. Sayer of Arkansas City
has been stopping with Carver and
building his house for him, having just
completed the building. The supposi
tion is that Carver was murdered.
Napa's Oldest Woman Dead.
NAPA, Jan. I.â The oldest woman in
Napa County passed to her reward
Thursday night. Sho was Mrs. J D T
Rockwell of this city; aged almost 91
years. Her life was that of a noble
woman and sincere Christian. Three
generations are represented in the
children left, twenty-nine being the
number of the last two generations.
A GREAT DAY
FOR THE POOR
Thousands Feasted With
out Charge by the Sal
vation Army.
The Mechanics' Pavilion Pre
sented an Animated
Scene.
Speeches, a Christmas Tree and Prayer
Helped to Make the Affair
a Success.
At the Mechanics' Pavilion last even
ing over 5000 of the city's poor were
fed by the Salvation Army. All day
yesterday an experienced man was
preparing the feast, by roasting whole
carcasses of mutton and beef in the
empty lot opposite the pavilion, and the
scene drew large crowds which were
held, partly by the unusual sight and
largely by the appetizing odor which
floated through the air. Coffee, bread
and butter helped to swell the bill of
fare and many a hungry, helpless mor
tal was sent from the building rejoic
ing at the fact that such an organiza
tion as the Salvation Army is allowed
to exist by the laws of God and man.
A sight was presented to visitors
never to be forgotten. As the feast
was spread, Commander Booth Tucker
entered the pavilion and the shout that
issued from thousands of throats
tingled, the blood of every individual
there, and thanks were given, some
silently and others aloud that a man
who works for the interests of his fel
l"\v beings was to be seen at such a
busy and eventful time.
The hall presented an animated ap
pearance. At one end a Christmas tree
brilliantly lighted was loaded with
tokens of the season for the children,
and the speakers' platform in close
proximity was decorated with the na
tional colors. At 8 o'clock Mayor
Phelan made an address of welcome.
He was followed by Commander Booth-
Tucker, who was received with an ova
tion and spoke amid rapt attention;
W. H. L. Barnes, who spoke on "Cali
fornia, the Land, of Promise;" George
H. Maxwell on the "New Emancipa
tion;" Frank McGowan on "Waste
Land and Waste Labor;" Professor E.
W. Hilgard and James H. Barry on
"Opportunityâ Not Alms."
Then the feast began. Lassies in
neat dress waited upon the hungry
and friendless visitor, and the appetiz
ing morsels disappeared as though be
fore a cyclone. Again and again the
empty plates were replenished, and
not until the last visitor had been
served did the labors of those in
charge cease. Then it was seen that
there was food in plenty left for
those who had eaten their fill but a
short time before.
As some who were religiously in
clined left the hall they praised the
Creator on bended knees for the meal
which had been prepared for them in
the hour of trials and tribulations.
Others left without a word, possibly
feeling their position, but not one was
there who departed with anything but
a smile of satisfaction upon his coun
tenance.
The remarks of George H. Maxwell
on the "New Emancipation" were at
tentively listened to, and his words
proved that he was thoroughly con
versant with the subject. He referred
to the deplorable state that men were
reduced to at times, although they
were willing and anxious to work, but
he thought that prosperity and happi
ness would dawn with the passing of
the new year. Among other things he
said:
"So long as the laboring classes of
this country continue to seek for re
lief from these conditions by creating
more opportunities to labor "in cities,
just so long will they continue to throw
themselves under the wheels of the car
of Juggernaut which is â  destroying
them, for in the end it is the poor who
will suffer rather than the rich by the
coming of 'The Man on Horseback'
whom fhe corruption of our cities will
bring, as sure as fate, unless their
overgrowth can be checked. There is
but one way in which this republic can
be prevented from following in the
footsteps of Rome, and that is by turn
ing back to the land the great masses
of the people who must labor to live,
and rooting them to the soil in rural
homes where each yeoman citizen, by
his own labor upon his own land, can
produce his own living directly from
the soil he tills, and where his hearth
stone may be the center around which
his children will grow up surrounded
with comfort and plenty and in the
pure air of the home life of the country
every man who must toil to live can
achieve absolute individual, Industrial
independence.
"For it is such â¢ ndividual, industrial
independence which should be the
end and aim of every laboring man's
efforts. It should be the pillar of
cloud by day and the pillar of fire by
night which should guMi his footsteps
until he shall have reached it as a
promised land. And every such ru
ral home, as our Secretary of Agri
culture said in his last annual report,
will be a sure safeguard of the Re
public.
"If we would accomplish this great re
sult, the whole people, and tht Govern
ment itself, if it is to continue to be a
Government of the people, by the peo
ple and for the people, must unite to
turn the tide of population from the
cities back to the country. And to do
this, we must do two things; first, we
must change the ideals of American
life. As a nation we are training our
children that the chief aim of life is
to get money. If we continue for an
other generation as we have in the
past we will by that time have canon
ized Jay Gould and forgotten Abraham
Lincoln. Instead of this every boy
should be taught that his aim should
be an honorable independence in a
home of his own upon the land."
AN EX-CONVICT CAPTURES

Frazer, the English Officer in Charge. Has a

THE DAY AND
THE WEATHER
Crowds and Sunshine
Welcome. the New
Year.
Punch Bowls Filled and Often
Emptied to Coining
Prosperity.
General Shatter Was the Only One at
Home-He Received Guests
â¢ at Fort Mason.
Bright and blithe as was the passing
of the old year, it was no more genial
than the birth of the new. Winter
seemed' to have retired for the time
being and the city woke to as fair a
day as she could well expect in the
midst of spring, and the crowds which
thronged her streets were of the dis
tinctively holiday order.
At all the clubs the best punch bowl,
well filled and often replenished, stood
on the sideboard, and the fragrance of
the Christmas evergreens lent their
memories of another holiday to add to
the air of hospitality over it all. There
were no special New Year's festivities
at any of the clubs, but there were egg
nog and sociability and the reception
rooms were gay with good wishes un
til a second day had marked the en
trance of '98.
At the theaters, for there were sev
eral matinees during the afternoon,
there was little room to spare, and it
seemed as if the old set that used to
spend its New Year's Day in calling on
its friends had substituted the play
for the parlor, and being entertained
for the art of entertaining others. It
was society that attended the mati
nees, at least that part of it which did
not pass the day out at the ocean
beach or on the driveways of the park
or away from town.
Among the special haunts of men
the punch bowl was also in evidence,
and sometimes it was multiplied by
two and by three in order to keep pace
with the demand for holiday cheer.
The "line" was a scene of the greatest
activity, and after the theaters had
poured their streams of humanity out
upon the sidewalks locomotion on
Market and Kearny streets became a
matter for serious consideration.
The home of Brigadier-General
Shatter, out at Fort Mason, was the
scene of a brilliant reception during
the afternoon, when the officers from
Benicia. Angel Island, Alcatraz and
the Presidio called to pay their re
spects to their commander. Com
mander Baird of the British torpedo
boat destroyer Virago and Captain
Fred F. Feger of the British cruiser
Leander were among those present.
All the officers were in full dress uni
form. Mrs. Shafter received the
guests as they arrived, and after a few
words of greeting they mingled to
gether and enjoyed a pleasant hour.
Among those who called were:
Colonel Miles, Colonel Busby, Captain
Starr. Captain Pettit. Captain Brant,
Captain Fister, Captain Gale, Captain
Rogers, Captain Thompson, Chaplain Mc-
Cumber of Angel Island, Lieutenant Craf
ton. Lieutenant Wilcox, Adjutant Benja
min. Lieutenant Bennett, Lieutenant
Raudiez, Lieutenant Erwln, Lieutenant
Benson, Captain Neill, Lieutenant Danes,
Captain Pratt, Lieutenant O'Hara, Cap
tain Potts, Captain Chester. Major Kin
zie. Colonel Williston. Lieutenant Ran
dolph, Captain Calift, Captain Hobbs,
Captain Berkhimer, Lieutenant Foster,
Lieutenant Skt-rritt, Lieutenant Wilson,
Lieutenant MeNair, Lieutenant England,
Lieutenant Woodward. Colonel Miller.
Lieutenant Colonel Middleton, Deputy
Surgeon General; Charles M. Gandy, as
sistant surgeon; Paul F. Straub, assist
ant surgeon; Colonel George H. Burton,
inspector general: Colonel Moore, Major
Field, Edwin O. Sarratt. Dr. Frick, Rob
ert S. Abernathy, Adjutant General Bab
cock. Paymaster John S. Witcher, H.
E. McVay, assistant surgeon, and John
D. Miley and Robert Noble, aides-de-camp
to General Shafter.
The Y. M. C. A. was open all day,
and from 2 In the afternoon until late
at night there was not an hour during
which there was not some form of en
tertainment In progress. Tnere was an
informal reception in thp parlors from
2 to 3:30, during which music, songs
and recitations helped to pass the time.
Then followed a game of basket ball
in the gymnasium, with tumbling and
springboard work by the association
athletes to add to the interest.
In the evening there was a concert
in the auditorium in which several
well-known local artists assisted, and
which drew an audience even larger
than that of the afternoon.
Outside the army what little remained
of the old custom of makingNew Year's
calls seemed to have died from inr.r?i
tion. Nobody was at home, and those
who are somebody spent the day at
their country seats, when provided
with such luxuries, and when not so
incumbered, they at least went away
from the family rooftree until the
evening shadows gathered. It was a
sociable day, however, if not a social
one, and even if there had been noth
ing beyond the good wishes, the gay
crowds and the truly Western sun

How the New Year Finds
Party Fealty in
Oakland.
Ruirioirs of Changes Are Now
Hovering Over the City
; / Hall.
Everything Mixed at a Time When
a Solid Front Is Most
Needed.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 31.
The advent of the New Year finds
Alameda County in a very mixed con-
. dition politically. The complications
Start at the City Hall and go clear
through the whole of the political or
;zatioris of the county. "
Everything appears to be twisted
and turned, and no one knows exactly
where he stands or why he stands or
\\ hat he stands upon. For reasons
which have never been explained a
system of dispensing patronage has
been maintained at the City Hall that
is subjecting the Republican party of
Oakland to ridicule from within and
without. With a Republican majority
in the Board of Works, and with hun
dreds of competent men in the party
capable of filling any municipal uHice,
men without a particle of claim on the
party in power have been retained to
: help /disrupt Republican organizations.
This, too, at a time when this city
stands more in need of a solid Repub
lican front than at any other time in
:'.- her history.
During the past tjr weeks what may
be called the' solidifying of the parti
sans of. Dr. PardÂ« â  and W. R. Davis
has been quietly taking place in a more
marked 'degree than during the past
three months,. : it- has been stated that
the present Gofitest between these two
men is agni-i! thing for the Republican
party; be.eii.-c.it will bring out every
party man : .a .thr county who will, at
the right ';'i. : i"me; vote for the man who
proves ;the. stronger. At the present
time th;re. would appear to be what
W.:R. Davis called yesterday many
â quadrennial Republicans" in this city.
They .are found every fourth year, but
in the â¢interval they fly around driven
by â â¢â¢v.e:'y..ln.>.-atli of political doctrine
that; rria.y l'f born of the hour. When
asked for .his - Mr. Davis, said
that. lie. had expressed them four years
â  ago .and th- y hal not altered a parti
: cle:. . ; He f, r ave his expression as fol-
Ivws: "The legitimate object of par
ities arid campaigns is to forward prin
i iples and.- to .'-secure, good administra
tii>n. No party or campaign can just
ify, its existence*- "n personal ground.
No: man: is in'iispensab'wr, no ordinary
ijian. is. of much Importance, even. It
is the < n-cspt-ratnrs. not the dissenters,
; . Oo- ..[ii-ratinn, and not dissension, which
.wlH'a.ccoJfililish what is best for the
. â â -;. : .c'it>' . ..\viVÂ»-iiÂ«-\ "<'r and however it is done.
. ..If docirintis or practices are to be op-
Siad let us confront them with co
strength, not with seceding
rival forces, each weakening the
Other. I believe in good government,
Â» so. 'do you, so do we all. Well, then,
to secure it shall we split up our num
bers, fall upr n each other and come out
worse than when we began? It is
suie-hTal to split up tiiose combined
s, .with which alone it can be
âfolly. Co-operation, v:
and unambitious, is th^ need and
watchword cf the hour. Sidelights are
V false lights, and side voices are false
voices. Let us stand together, stick
â¢ gether, think together, act together,
and: we can do something â do every-
thing. that- can be done at all for the
'; â '/'â  city of '.â¢ Oakland. If we split apart,
"."stay apart, vote apart and act apart,
;' we shall accomplish nothing for the
f ; lasting good of the city, which is the
y . only real point worth Words or worth
"/,; enthusiasm." ...
: . : . in referring to . these remarks Mr.
':/- Davis said that while he would not ap
l ply them : .in detail to present condi-
V; : tions he has no cause to alter one par
â  ticle of their sense or principle. It is
: ? now the .desire of the party that the
;^ whole of Great' : Oakland shall be a
â  ; . strong' Republican foothold in the im
portant State -and county campaign of
â¢V: â  IS9SÂ». At the present time the prospects
â¢v^are'that't)iere; will . bÂ« the usual dissat
isfaction and dissensioji, and that even
: : .many' of the .quadrennial . Republicans
ill have, been diven into side issues
because -'-of -"the- disloyalty of some who
;:r^.no\ViHi a measure responsible for
the party's welfare. - The matter dur
â¢ ing the past week -has.- been very thor
oughly discussed, and when the holi
days are over it is likely that there
â ' .will, be some important but not alto
gether 1 unexpected changes in the city
, : ..-..government. â ' . ; ' :;
,-v.' v The revocation of the appointment of
Judge . Wood to succeed Judge Allen
has 'more- significance than is apparent
; : : 'the;''surface. It shows plainly the
> beginning of a new order of things at
' the City Hall, the end of which can
7 hardly be seen at this time. The Mayor
r has frequently stated . that the reason
- good Republicans have not been put
â  into positions now held by the rem
nants of a. Populist administration has
â¢-: been. that eligible parties have not been
presented. He admits. now that there
."'. - are many eligible candidates and that
\':no valid reason exists why justifiable
changes should not be made.
." . . The coming of ' Frank Jordan back
â¢into the county fight has overthrown
â¢Â°" many plans and created new combi
nations and hostilities in that end of
the. political machine. The present
county government might be said to be
about equally divided between. Popu
; "lists and Republicans, and of course
.'a bitter fight will be made to recover
: the ground lost to the Republicans
four years ago. It was really recov
'*.-â¢ ered one year ago at the general elec
tion,: but the many tangles that have
taken place since then leave the pres
.â¢ '. ent condition of the party a matter of
:' -doubt. City Attorney Dow is being
.frequently, brought forward as a good
/â¢ candidate for District Attorney. Mr.
" Dow made a splendid record as a Coun
cilman. He has followed it up in the
.â¢-.â 'â office' of City Attorney, but if he would
â¢ ; : lay claim to further honors from the
party he will have to be more true to
...party doctrine and to the ideas ex
; pressed by William R. Davis than he
has been. Altogether 1898 opens up in
a very interesting manner for the poli
â¢ â¢ ticians on this side of the bay.

GASPIPE CANNON BLEW UP.
Berj Doyle Seriously Injured by a
New Year's Accident.
A LAMBDA. Jan. I.â A number of
young men were celebrating the ad
vi-nt of the New Year last night at
midnight In a vacant lot on San Jose
avenue, in the western part of tmvn,
Among them was Ben Doyle of 917
San Antonio avenue. He had impro
vised a cannon from a piece of gas
pipe and fired it off successfully sev
eral times. Finally he reloaded it,
touched the fuse and ran a few steps
away while it should explode. But for
some reason it did not go off and he
went back to see what was the trou
ble. He was leaning over the appa
ratus, when it suddenly exploded, the
pipe striking his left leg just below the
knee cap, inflicting a painful and se
rious wound. He was taken at once
to the Sanitarium on San Jose avenue
i and a physician summoned, \\hÂ« found
| that the leg was shattered and the
I tibia badly broken. It is hoped, how
ever, that it will be possible to save
ihe leg.

POLICE PROTECTION
FOR BERKELEY
North Berkeley Residents Deter
mined to Drive Out
Burglars.
Town Trustees Will Be Asked to Co
operate With the
Citizens.
I^ERKELEY, Jan I.â The citizens of
Berkeley are at last determined to seek
better protection from burglary and
robbery. Much talk has been occasion
ed by the large number of recent hold
ups and -burglaries of the need of bet
ter police service, but up to the present
time no suitable plan could be agreed
upon.
North Berkeley residents, however,
are aroused and are resolved that
something shall be done. Last Tues-
'lay night, at a meeting of the North
ii.-rkeley Improvement Club, a com
i; ittee composed of August L. Ott.
(halrman; Henry Lampe and Edward
Florence was appointed to draw up
some plan and report at the meeting
to be held next Tuesday night.
What they propose is that the town
employ watchmen in every ward in
Berkeley, the watchmen to be paid
partly by the town and partly by sub
scriptions of the citizens. They be
lieve that if this arrangement were to
be carried out Berkeley would soon be
rid of her tough characters.
.Mr. Florence, when seen to-day, said:
"The town should afford protection to
its citizens, but if they do not take
suitable action the citizens themselves
must do something. The committee has
not yet consulted with the Town Trus
teea, and we do not know what will ul
timately be done. Our policy will be
controlled by their action. If they re
fuse to enter upon any plan then we
will wortc by ourselves."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1898.
NEW YEAR'S
WELCOME
Salvation Army Extends
It to Many Hun
dreds.
Free Banquet Served to All
Who Needed a Helping
Hand.
The Tables Were Too Well Built to
Groan, but the Guests Made
Up for It.
Oakland Office San Franciso Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 1.
The most lively scene in this city
to-day was the banquet given to all
comers by the Salvation Army at their
large hall, Twelfth and Washington
streets.
If any one was hungry at 2 o'clock,
it was due either to laziness, indiffer
ence or sickness, for the Army lads
and lassies have spent the last two
weeks hunting up all likely guests, and
to-day they were on hand to minister
to their wants. There was no lack
of food, waitresses or guests, and the
hundreds that were banqueted fully
appreciated the occasion. It was a
crowd such as few people would be
lieve could be gut together in Oakland
at short notice. Long as were the
tables, they were not long enough t >
accommodate the guests at one situ;-^.
so those that hail blue tickets were
admitted first, and the others, who
to wait, were entertained around the
Ore in the meeting room until the first
batch of appetites had been appeased.
The only accident that occurred was
the breaking of a rhair, and this mis
hap furnished the tall secretary with
a baton to guide tho hungry mass as
it surged through the door.
Stall Captain and Mrs. Merry
weather were very much in evidence,
and while the raptaln looked after the
carving interests his busy wife hov
ered around the pie counter. Th<Â» din
ner was a great success, and proved
that in spite of progress and food
times and commercial revivals the
Savior of mankind prophesied only
too truly when In- said. "The poor ye
have with you alway."
FELL THROUGH GLASS
Strange Accident on Broadway for
Wf)ich No Author Can Be
pound.
OAKLAND, Jan. I.â Somebody must
be walking around with some very bad
cuts, or else that unseen guardian that
is supposed to hover around a human
being under certain conditions must
have been particularly alive to his re
sponsibility very early this morning.
Before the New Year was ten min
utes old, a large, heavy plate-glass in
a clothing store at Eleventh and
Broadway was broken in. The hole
made was big enough for a man to
walk through, but whoever caused it
made his escape before he could be
caught. It was not the burglar who
took the gold coin from a store window
on Washington street a few day." ago,
because there was no such temptation
in sight and nothing was taken. Just
before the crash a couple of men who
had evidently been breaking good reso
lutions, were seen near the window,
and there i? no doubt that one or both
of them fell against and through it.
No one applied at the Receiving Hos
pital for treatment, and it is a won
der to the police how such an accident
could have occurred without someone
being seriously injured.

men â scurf U.
The handsome trophy goes by de
fault to Company D. owing to the fact
that the companies in the Second Reg
iment failed to have five men shoot as
per order.
The regulation Springfield rifle was
uÂ«> il, and more than one boy will re
member the shoot from some gentle
kicks received from the guns.

KEEFE IN JAIL.
Charged With Brutally StrikjOO
Mis Daughter Maggie or>
the Street.
ALAMEDA, Jan. I.â Patrick Keefe.
whose troubles have been ventilated for
several weeks in the press, is in jail
again on the same old charge of cruel
ty to his children. This time it is an
aggravated case of assault on his eld
est daughter Maggie.
Maggie was taken at once to Mrs.
Prescott, of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children, and on
hÂ«*r advice she swore to a complaint
to-day charging her unnatural parent
with battery. He was arrested this
afternoon and locked up in the city
Jail.
ALLEGED LIQUOR LICENSE VIO
LATION.
ALAMEDA, Jan. Lâ lt is reported
that charges of violating the liquor
license ordinance are to be made
against Spies & Wanner, the keepers
of a Park-street saloon. That portion
of the law which they are said to have
violated is the inhibition of selling
liquor to a person already intoxicated.
The complainant is Mrs. Charles
Evans, whose husband was until re
cently an employe of the city electric
light works, but who was discharged
for getting drunk. Mrs. Evans has
been Investigating the case, and she
claims to have proof that her husband
was given seven or eight drinks of
liquor in Spies & Warmer's saloon
when ho was already in an intoxicated
condition. This will be made the basis
of a demand upon the trustees that
tlioir license be revoked. It is also
i- ported that Mrs. Evans will make
charges against still another saloon
keeper on the same grounds.
FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL.
ALAMEDA, Jan. I.â A very interest
ing and exciting game of English foot
ball was play^i this afternoon at the
West Alameda grounds between the
Vampires and the Oakland Associa
tion teams. The Vampires won by a
score of 3 to 1. The feature of this
game is that there is none of the
knock-down-and-drag-out business in
cidental to the game as usually played
in this country. But this did not de
tract from the interest in the game, as
testified by the enthusiasm manifested
by the large crowd of spectators pres
ent.
The San Francisco Midgets and the
Alameda Acme team played a game of
baseball at the Webster-street gorunds
this afternoon which resulted in a vic
tory for the Alameda boys by a score
of 10 to 2.
The Park Avenue baseball nine de
feated the Young Fresno nine on Fri
c'uy afternoon by a score of 9 to 0.
Daniel Burr defeated C. Baker on
Friday afternoon in a lawn tennis
tournament by a score of 18 to 16.
This is the largest score ever made at
tennis in this city.
The game of baseball between the
Encinals and a picked team from the
Stanford and Berkeley universities was
won by the first named club by a
score of 13 to 10.
PRESBYTERIANS REVENGED
Trje Congregational Baseball Team
Suffers Defeat in trje F^e

BERKELEY, Jan. The return
game of baseball between the Congre
gational and Presbyterian Churches j
was played this morning. At the end
Of the seventh inning, when game was
called, the score stood 34 to 8 In favor i
of the Presbyterians. Rev. Hatch of
the Congregational Church was not up
to his usual form, and his numerous
errors at first account largely, for the
big score of his opponents. The Pres
byterians were strengthened since
their Christmas game by the addition
of Frank Mighell, and "Diddy" Hoag,
the Varsity ..captain. The beautiful
fielding and heavy batting of these
men were the features of the game. A
third game â  will probably take place
on Washington's Birthday.
The teams lined up as follows:

KICKED TO DEATH BY A COLT.
OAKLAND. Jan. I.â Patrick Stokes.
onÂ»- of th<> oldest and best known ex
pressmen of Bast Oakland, was kicked
to death by a colt this afternoon.
After eating New Year's dinner with
his family Stokes went into the barn
to harness uj> a colt. The animal had
only been tak^n out a few times and
was known to be frisky, but just what
happened will never be known, for no
body saw the accident occur.
After the father had been gone about
ten minutes his son went out and
called to his father. Not receiving a
reply he went into the barn, where he
found his father lying unconscious on
the floor. Young Stokes could see that
his father was bleeding from the head
and at once called Dr. Sill. Stokes was
examined and it was found that he had
been kicked in the head. The jaw was
broken and the base of the skull frac
tured. He did not recover conscious
ness and died two hours later.
Patrick Stokes was 61 years of age
and has lived here many years. One
of his sons, Police Officer Stokes, died
about a year ago.

LOST HIS ROLL
OF GREENBACKS
William Looker, a Bucolic
Stranger, Robbed by
a Woman.
While He Visited Her Room
She Cleverly Relieves Him
of His Money.
Maggie Stevens and George Snow
Are Locked Up on
Suspicion.
William Looker, a recent arrival from
the East, was robbed of $500 in green
backs yesterday morning in a room in
a lc-dging-house on Grant avenue, near
Bush.
While celebrating the advent of the
new year, Looker met a young man
named George Snow, a horseman. They
visited the tenderloin district and had
a merry time. As they proceeded
along Grant avenue a woman who is
known by the name of Maggie Stevens
happened along. Snow, who seemed to
be on very friendly terms with her, In
troduced her to Looker. At her invi
tation he accompanied her to her room,
where they had several drinks. Looker
says that he had the roll of greenbacks
in his inside coat pocket, and when he
entered the room he took off the coat
and placed it on a chair. After a short
conversation with the woman he left
the room but returned in a few min
utes. He then put on his coat and
started to leave. As he emerged from
the rwim he thought of his money and
placed his hand in his coat pocket to
see if it was there.
To his great surprise the roll of
greenbacks was gone. Convinced that
the woman had robbed him, he at
once summoned a police officer.
The latter visited the room, but was
unable to find the woman. Snow ap
peared a few minutes later and was
placed under arrest. A short time after
he was locked up in the tanks in the
City Prison the woman entered her
room and was met by the policeman.
She indignantly denied that she had
robbed Looker and defied the officer to
arrest her.
Notwithstanding her protestations of
innocence she was also taken into cus
tody and escorted to the City Prison.
She was then turned over to Matron
Gilmore, who was instructed to search
her.
An examination of her clothing,
however, failed to bring to light the
missing greenbacks.
Last night Looker visited the City
Prison and positively identified the
woman as the one who had robbed
him. He said that after he entered
her room she advised him to take off
his coat, as she feared he would "catch
cold" after leaving her. He placed his
coat on a chair which the woman moved
close to the wall. Looker is convinced
that the woman worked the old-time
"panel game" on him. He intends to
swear to a complaint against the pair
to-day, charging them with grand lar
ceny.

The playing on the whole was far
above the average, particularly the
form displayed by the younger mem
bers of the club. The tennis dis
played throughout the tournament
was of such a character that it kept
the numerous spectators applauding
constantly. The form displayed by
Schmidt, who is only nine years of
age and the youngest in the club,
gives promise of a brilliant future in
this sport.
The coast champion, Geo. Whitney,
will play his brother. Robert N. Whit
ney, to-day in the championship
round.
The class winners of yesterday's
contests will meet this afternoon with
a handicap.

A NEW CYCLE
CENTURY RACER
Percy Dell Defeats a Dozen
Others in the Hundred
Mile Ride. â¢".. :
An Olympic Club Wheelman Again
Gains the Honor of the First
Ride of the Year.
The dawn of the New Year heralded
the rising of a new star in the cycle
racing firmament, who bids fair to
eclipse some of the old-time planets in
course of time.
At midnight Friday an even dozen
sturdy road riders mounted their
wheels at Ninth and Market street^
and set off for San Jose, thence back,
to Alameda, thereby completing a ride
of 100 miles, intent upon gaining the.
honor of accomplishing the first century
ride of the year. It is a habit that per
tains all over the United States,
whether weather conditions are favor- '..
able or not, and in New YorJt some
times as many as 100 men have started
on the trip each year. "â¢;/:â ' : ,
Ten of the men who started Friday/
night were on singles and two en'tan^:
dem. They were I. R. Lind, Imperial
Club; Harry Fowler, Bay City W.heei
men; Percy Dell, L. H. Smith, J..-H...
Nash, G. E. Kroetz and G. H. Ramsay,
Olympic Club "Wheelmen; SL Jiirge;
wetz and G. A. Wyman, Acme;.
Stevens, San Francisco Road Club, and
the Ward brothers, tandem team of
the California Club. Only five- qf- these
had previously announced their iriteji-j ..
tions of starting. The others, decided. v
to take the ride at the last minute.. ; ;.
Lind set a hot pace to the loot, of the
six-mile hill, and after that was hot
prominent to the fore. Nash, Wymarij
Smith and Fowler kept pretty well to* :
gether, Nash and Fowler being .the.
first to reach San Jose, at 3:2.5 o'clock
yesterday morning. Accidents; had
been numerous, and. the others were
strung out behind on the road. Nash
was kicked by a horse, but escaped Ste^
rious injury. Dell fell, Lind,.. /Wyrnart.
and Smith punctured their tires,; and;
Ramsay also had a fall. .:â¢ '. 'â 'â â â '.
The weather was so bitterly -G.o.W
that the men suffered :c6hsiderahly : ,
their feet in particular becoming namb. :
A brief stop was made in San Jose for
coffee, and they were off again -ito.c.Qm-.
plete the journey. .' â¢ ;
The roads were perfect on. the other
side of the bay, and with the ap^
proaching dawn better time. was. made,,
though they were all half dead with
the cold and very tired. â -.â  v- â¢â 
The Ward brothers picked up Dell
outside of San Jose and. paced .him
along, which advantage made it, easy,
for him to gain on the. others. Nash,
Fowler and Smith held together to the
finish, but could not overcome the :
lead. Dell finished strong at. 7;2d
o'clock, making his total time for the
100 miles 7 hours and 20 minute*. The
next bunchâ Nash, Fowler and Smith
âdid not get in until 8:25, over an :
hour behind them, and the others
straggled in at intervals thereafter-.
Dell is a new man to the cycle racers
and those who made the trip
kindly of him. His cheery disposition
and good nature helped to make the
ride less irksome, and none begrudged
him the honor when he finished ftfst,
even though tandem paced. He is.
looked to as being a prominent factor
in future road events, particularly
long-distance grinds like the. annual
25-mile road race. He is big and strong
and well fitted for the hard work: . . :.
If. a. Curtis of Alameda claims to
have beaten Dell's time, but thatv is
disputed by the other riders. .:. Curtis
reversed the course, starting . at .Ala
meda and finishing here, and claims to
have done it in 6 hours 38 minutes.
Those who started from here, however,
say that they passed Curtis going to
San Jose when they were then out 3
hours and 25 minutes. To. have finished
in 638 Curtis have had to c.njn
plete the 50-mile ride back to this city
in 3 hours 18 minutes, which is a prac
tical impossibility. The San Fran
! Cisco boys say 5:18 would be neater the
| mark.

Strange Story of a Plot to Kill the
Much Prosecuted Real Estate
Agent.
I
There is a great deal of interest in
commercial and real estate circles over
the promised revelations of James F.
Turner, who will be tried before Judge
Cook to-morrow on a charge of grand
larceny in connection with gigantic
real estate swindles. From the outset
of the many trials and charges against
him, Turner has denied that he is in
any way guilty of criminal conduct.
The defendant, who has been ac
cused of all the crimes in the list of
real estate frauds, was discharged in
one important case by the Supreme
Court, while the jury disagreed in the
first trial for burglary, a retrial of
which begins to-morrow.
The sensational feature of the pro
ceedings now pending is that the de
fendant insists on forcing his enemies
to show their hands and crowd him as
far as they intend to do at once. He
says he stands ready to prove those
who are prosecuting him have turned
heaven and earth to shift others'
crimes on him. He promises revela
tions that will put I'im in a different
light and make his prosecutors stir
themselves to show that they are in
nocent.
"I shall swear to warrants for the
arrest of an Italian barber named J.
P. Frenna at once," said Turner last
night. "I charge that he has threat
ened my life; that he has lain in wait
for me, insulted my brother and tried
in every way to put me in a false light.
I asked for EhC v arrant on Friday and
afterward chant' <1 my mind and de
cided to wait until to-morrow. '
It is alleged that the threat was
made a few weeks ago near the City
Hall, Just after Turner had defeated
part of an exorbitant claim made
against him by one Dement, a note
shaver.
Turner has been fighting the cases
for four years. Those most interested
against him are J. P. Frenna. a bar
ber; Jacob Bertz, proprietor of a res
taurant, and L. C. Meyginson, a for
mer partner of Turner in various
transactions affecting lands. Meggin
son is accused by Turner of forging a
note of $100,000 against William Mur
dock, a Colusa County rancher, whose
estate is now undergoing settlement.
Attorney Pillsbury and others are in
terested for the heirs in trying to show
that the note, purporting to have been
made for $100,000 in 1877, was originally
drawn for $100 and subsequently
raised. Turner promises to give some
evidence against Megginson which will
show that everything is not pure as
the driven snow in the folds of thÂ»
opposition. The chief evidence against
him is that of Megginson and his as
sociates.
"My chief contention regarding
Frenna, who accuses me of swindling
him," said the accused real estate
dealer, "is that he never had any such
sums as he claims I got or owed him,
for he was in th^ laundry business iv
1887 and failed, not having a dollar. He
opened a barber-shop on Polk street,
and five years laW claimed that I
owed him nearly $18,000. The truth is
he never had any mojiey until I made
it for him, and then he became an in
grate, as did the other two who are
now denouncing me so bitterly.
"I propose to make all these people
show their hands. I fear nothing that
they can do and I fee] that they are
afraid that the truth about themselves
will come to the surface."
If one-half of Turner's allegations
can be substantiated there will be a
great sensation before the famous land
trials are over. He says he has re
ferred capitalists with whom he has
lately been negotiating business mat
ters to every part of his history, and
that they have traced his movements
for twenty years and pronounced his
record as a clean one.
"This being the case," said he. "my
word ought to he taken for something,
and I tell you I can prove that there
are men, whom I cannot now name,
who have been plotting to ruin me and
get my money. In my prosperous
days I made good money and there are
those who know it. I charge that the
plots against me ware far-reaching,
and that murder was in the plans of
some of my enemies. I have evi
dence that, In October, 1894, certain
men bought hemp rope on Montgomery
THE COMING OF AN EVANGELIST.
MAJOR GEORGE A. HILTON.
Major George A. Hilton, the lay evangelist who has been holding such
successful meetings throughout the East, will arrive in this city some
time in the first part of this month. He 1s not unknown here, for he has
held more than one revival in San Francisco, and has led more than one
convert to the penitent form. Major Hilton is known all over the United
States as a prominent projector of charitable works, the most notable of
them all being the Central Union Mission of Washington, D. C. For the
past fifteen years he has given his entire time to the work of an evan
gelist. During this time he has averaged more than a meeting a day.
and has earned for himself a reputation as a teacher of the Bible that
has few equals. â¢In addition to his work as an evangelist he holds the
important positions of president of the National Gospel Mission Union
and field superintendent of the American Railway Literary Union, both
positions which require ability and energy of a high order.
The coming of Major Hilton is looked forward to with much interest
by the local churches, and though the date of his coming has not yet been
set, preparations for his welcome and for the giving of assistance in his
meetings are already under way.
street with which to hang me. They
had it arranged that I was to be in
vited to a certain place, whore the plot
compassed my life. I was to be bound,
gagged and killed. My property, part
of which was in other names in trust,
was to be divided. I have evidence to
this effect, and I yet hope to know the
names of those who put up the j'>i>s."
Tumor denies all allegations that he
fears the result of the trials pending
against him. He says he has been
maligned by enemies and ha? not until
lately been given any fair hearing by
the newspapers, which have often tried
and convicted and denounced him as a
swindler, simply because his enemies
have had him arrested.
DESERTED BY HIS WIFE.
F- C. Strickland, a Recent Arrival
From Kansas. AsKs trje Assist
ance of the Police.
F. C. Strickland, a recent arrival
from Kansas, who lives at 1911 Mission
street, has reported to the police that
his wife and family, consisting of two
children, both glris, have deserted him.
A few days ago It; left for Fresno to
find a house as h>? intended to settle
there. While there he received the un
welcome news that his wife had dis
appeared and taken the two children
with her. He hurried back to the city
and found that the information was
correct.
According to his story he and his
wife have been married for about ten
years. On July 1 he sent his wife and
children to this < ity while he remained
in Kansas to dispose of his business
interests there. He joined them here
on December 15 at 1911 Mission street,
where she had taken up a temporary
residence. She was to join him in
Fresno December 21. and when she
failed to make her appearance he went
to the postoffire and got a letter stat
ing that his wife had decided to aban
don him and that he would never see
her again. She had shipped the per
sonal property belonging to him to
Fresno.
From information obtained by the
police it is believed that the woman
and her children left for the Ea*t over
the southern route and Chief Lees has
written to different points in Southern
California to ascertain if she is located
there.

OFFICER SMITH
"PARALYZED"
Sergeant Conboy Finds a
Policeman Dead
Drunk.
To Be Suspended To-Day,
Pending Action by the Po
lice Commission.
Accused of Insulting a Woman,
Complaint Lodfjed by a
Saloon- Keeper.
His name is Smith. He is a police
man and his beat is on Howard street.
That Is sufficient to identify him.
He got drunk, dead drunkâ in the
language of the slums he was' simply
"paralyzed." In his maudlin show of
authority he insulted a woman by
claiming that she was soliciting, an<l
dragging h<..- into a saloon for identi
fication. This is chapter one of the
story.
Captain Spillane learned of the af
fair through Sergeant Conboy, who
discovered Smith in a saloon under the
potent influence of the bright red
liquor. Policeman Smith was sent
home and, according to the police, will
be suspended from the force to-day.
That is the end of the story up to date.
Next Wednesday evening the Police
Commission will meet. Smith's case
will be brought up for adjudication
and he will probably be dishonorably
dischargedâ "fired" would be a more
expressive term. In all probability
that will be the sequel.
It was 10 P. M. yesterday when Ser
geant Conboy learned by a telephonic
message from Phil. Ryan's saloon, on
Howard street, near Fifth, that Offlcer
Smith was there and drunk as a
"lord." conboy, as acting captain of
the Southern station in Captain Spil
lane's absence, at once sallied forth to
investigate. He found affairs as stated
and took Smith with him to head
quarters at the City Hall. When Cap
tain Spillano arrived the case was told
him and Smith was asked for his story.
He had to admit, that he had been
drunk and in n > condition to perform
his duty. As .egards the case of the
woman, hf claimed that he thought
from her actions she was soliciting and
told her tin * fie would place her under
arrest if she did not cease her con
duct.
"She told me." he said, with all the
gravity he could master, "that I was
in no condition to judge what anybody
was doing and that she would report
my case. Then I let her Â«ro."
Captain Spillane then sent the man
home and will suspend him to-day,
pending the investigation of the Police
Commission.
If the stories of witnesses are to be
believed Smith's conduct was a flag
rant violation of duty, as he is accused
of dragging the woman into the saloon
for identification. Nobody knew her,
and that was probably the reason why
she was released.
As tho woman immediately disap
peared her name could not be learned.
She has not made any complaint in
person, but will probably do so to-day.
As matters stand, however. Smith is
known to have been drunk whiie on
duty, and that will be a sufficiently
serious charge for him to meet with
out anything else.
MISS PULITZER`S DEATH.

L.ucille, eldest daughter of Mr. and

MICHAEL EASILY WINS
FROM THE FRENCHMAN.
Tay/ore Clearly No Match for the Midget
Bicycle Champion From
Wales.
NEW YORK, Jan. 1. â Men, women,
boys and girls thronged every avail
able inch of Madison Square Garden
to-night for the regular indoor bicycle
races which were held under the aus
pices of the American Cycle Racing
Association. The board track was ar
ranged so that the riders had to cover
ten laps to complete a mile, and the
measurement was vouched for by three
city surveyors. At 9 o'clock it was es
timated that 10,000 people were in the
big building and there were half as
many more clamoring for admittance
at the entrances.
The big event of the evening was the
Michael-Taylore race. Taylore won the
pole on the toss. The Frenchman's
gear was 94 and Michael's 106. The
riders got on the scratch line at 10:20.
Taylore rushed off and caught the
pacers on the first turn with Michael
two lengths behind. Taylore rode like
a whirlwind and at the end of the first
mile led Michael by a length.
In the first lap of the second mile
Michael forged ahead, and at the end
of the third, mile he was one lap to
the good. In the fourth mile Michael
gained a lap. and in the fifth he had
the same distance to his credit. Tay
lore was outclassed in the eighth mile,
and Michael passed him for the third
time. Taylore's saddle broke in the
twentieth mile and in exchanging
wheels he lost more ground, giving
Michael a clear lead of a mile all told.
The Midget gained another lap at
the close of the twenty-third mile.

and it is much more to their Inten

"'I am very much interested in the
United. States' commerce with China.
I do not see how our business \yill be
affected by the present crisis, unless,
indeed, Germany or France should oc
cupy large provinces and impose dis
criminating tariffs against foreign
goods. England has always adopted a
ire.- trade -Hey in China and her
colony, Hongkong, as a free .port has
become the distributing center for a
large part of China.
"The trade of the United States in
sheetings,' prints and domestic calicoes
generally has been developing hope
fully for some years past."'
"As the Country is gradually opened
up to civilization and the means of
transit improve s-.j does the market for
this class cf goods enlarge, and ex
perience has proved that the cotton
goods manufactured in the Eastern
States are more than' able to hold then
own against the -Manchester products.
Then there is a large .business -in kero
sere oil, lumber, etc., which is always
increasing.
"But the most notable business tri
umph achieved by the United States
was the contract for the supply of a
number of Baldwin engines for the
<'hine.se railways. Hitherto it has al
ways been supposed that America
could not compete with England in the
supply of locomotives; but this con
tract has decidedly changed traders'
opinions.
"1 do not see why the United States
need f>el troubled about, this mat
ter. Unless the Government radi
1 ally changes its policy and takes an
active part in foreign affairs it can d<>
hothing more to develop trade with
China than its own merchants are al
reufiy doing. And the fact that last
year th<- United States exported to
China $7,000,000 worth of goods shows
that already ;i great deal has been done
in that direction."

tell the t;il'- of how he and his wife ami
little children, together with another
missionary couple, escaped the frantic
rape of a maddened Canton mob.
In the midst of Chinatown you will

under happier circumstances, and with
th>- power of a civilized Government to
protect him. In his quiet little study
on Washington street he sits surround

in the incomprehensible Chinese char

he has devoted his life to the salvation
of their souls and holds himself amply

In modest tones, as If he were relat

teHs this story of his providential' es
cape"
"It was in 1883, just after the French
had invaded Tonquia and all the worst
passions of the Chinese were aroused.
1 was living at Canton, outside the Eu
ropean settlement or concession. in
flammatory placards denouncing for
eigners and declaring that the French
fleet was about to bombard Canton
had been distributed all over the city,
and urged on by its leaders the fanati
cal ni"b rose.
" 'Tongr kwei' (or Butcher the foreign
devils) was the watchword as th>
maddened people made a rush for the
prates of the concession. Tho guard
was MOOO beaten down, and in a few
minutes fifteen of the finest (Merchant
palace* in the quarter had been sacked
and were in flames.
"The whole thing; was so sudden that
we were cut off from the rest of the
English people, and though the Consul
sent word telling; us to make for the
boats and save our lives we were too
late to take refuge with the other for
eigners.
"There we were, entirely unprotect
ed, in the midst of the native quarter,
tht- Btreetfl tilled with a bloodthirsty,
infuriated mob, and it seemed as if
nothing could save us.
"Help came, however. One of our
Chinese Christians left his own t -
j>lo, and knowing our peril came to
seek us out. He abandoned his family
to every danger and risked his own
life by his action, but he was loyal.
1 I pointed this out to him and urged
him to save himself. "You are my
' teacher,' he replied simply; 'come, and
1 will save you."
"The noble fellow kept his word. We
I were smuggled over a wall and into
his hnuHf. and there from early morn
ing until dusk we lay concealed. Over
j and over again we were on the point
qt being discovered; the awful cries.
, 'Shat kwei!' and 'Tong kwei' rang all
around us, but the Chinese Chris
j tians managed to keep our retreat
undiscovered. Sixteen native mem
! hers of my church .stood guard
throughout the whole day and
threw the pursuers off the scent,
while they also kept up communica
tion between us and our friends in the
concession.
"Toward evening the Viceroy sent
ini-.ps to quell the riot, but this only
increased our danger, since the mob,
driven from the <â .. cession, with its
tempting opportunities for looting,
swarmed more thickly than ever in the
native quarter.
"At last. Just at nightfall. .1 steam
launch manned by Chiiuvse sailors,
managed to safely approach the place
where we lay hid. We were smug
gled aboard and saved. Later some
English and foreign gunboats came up
the river, and peace was restored.
"No. our home was not destroyed
after our escape. That is another re
markable feature of our escape. My
house and all that was in it was left
intact, through the devotion and read
iness of Hi > t 'bines'- OOOk,
"In the morning, when the riots be
gan, I told him to go, as he might en
iTansjfr his life by staying with me.
No, he would not go. All through that
day he kept the mob at bay, telling
them that I had left the place, and
that the property had been sold to
native Chinese.
â¢'The story would never have been
believed but for a singular coincidence.
A few months before, wishing to as
certain the value of the property, I
had put up a placard announcing that
the house was for sale by private
treaty. I had learned all that I
wished, and long since the placard had
been taken down, but luckily some of
the rioters remembered having seen
the announcement and they went
away satisfied that the house belonged
ti> one of their countrymen.
"Thus our lives and property were
saved, but the shock and stress of the
day proved too much for the American
missionary's wife who was. with us. I
shall never forget," concluded Mr.
Masters, with an earnest look in his
face, "that on this terrible day, when
it was sauve gui peut for Europeans,
my own countrymen deserted me. It
was only through the devotion of my
Chinese Christians that all our lives
were saved."
There are more than thirty American
missionary societies represented in
China and hundreds of missionaries
employed. Among the most important
Â«'f the societies are the Methodist, Pres
byterian.-American Board of Missions,
Episcopalian, Southern Baptist, South
ern Presbyterian, Christian Alliance,
etc. The Methodist Episcopalian Mis
sionary Society alone has a hundred
men and forty women scattered
throughout a vast territory. Scorning
the safe protection of the treaty ports,
where foreigners are tolerated, these
brave workers for Christ, men and wo
men, scatter themselves all over the
eoOatry, mbject U> constant abuse and
ridicule from the fanatical natives,
never knowing from day to day when
an outbreak may occur which will
sweep them out of existence before
European aid can arrive.
The great trouble is that the educated
Chinamen, the "literati." do not want

to be converted. Their own religion,
the Confucian, is, they argue, much
older than Christianity, and for all
practical purposes quite as good.
"What would you think." they say, "if
large parties of Chinese priests, sup
plied with funds from their own coun
try, should invade the United States
and set up joss houses in all the prin
cipal towns, endeavoring to induce
I every one to burn punks and worship
before their hideous idols?"'
Missionaries have been working
steadfastly in China since 1807, when
Morrison, the heroic pioneer, braved in
numerable dangers to establish the first
mission in Canton. And after the treaty
of Tientsin opened many of the ports
of China to foreigners, missionaries
from all parts of the world poured in.
From their own standpoint it is no
wonder that the "literati" are indig
nant. As these gentlemen, after pass
ing the most elaborate civil service ex
amination known, hold all the principal
official posts, it is easy for them to in
fluence the ignorant fanatical mob
whenever they may think it desirable.
Though there are sects in China, as
everywhere else, they are prepared to
sink all differences in their antagonism
to the hated "Yang Yen," the foreign
ers, or "Sea Men," who come from
strange parts to disturb their ancestral
worship. ConfucianiÃts, Buddhists,
Taoists, join hands when the cry of
"Shat kwei" (Death to the foreign dev
ils) is raised.
Missionaries attribute these massa
cres to the fact that the central Chi
nese administration at Peking has ab
solutely no control of the outlying
provinces. However sincere it may be
in its protestations of regret and how
ever willing it may be to make repara
tion for these awful, crimes, it cannot
control the doings of the provincial
< ;..\ t-rnors. The mobs rise too quickly,
communication in this undeveloped
country is too slow, and the mischief
is always done before aid can reach
the victims.
The devoted temerity of the mis
sionaries frequently does much to
bring about this lamentable result.
Men and women alike venture, in
spite of the warnings of Consuls, far
into the interior, away from the treaty
ports, where European protection alone
can avail. Sometimes, as with the
workers of the China Island mission,
native costume is adopted, with a
view to minimizing the risks and plac
ing the missionaries more on a footing
of equality with the natives.
The Chinese cannot understand the
freedom from sex restrictions which
characterizes the American woman.
Take a lady of the most perfect re
finement and breeding, dress her a la
Chinoise. set her down in a Chinese vil
lage, and the chances are that, in the
course of a day, she will commit a
hundred acts which the ignorant vil
lagers will regard as impolite, .if not
indelicate. It is even considered a
breach of morality for a wife to take
her husband's arm, and missionaries
living in the interior are compelled to
refrain from the most harmless trib- j
utes of affection toward their spouses !
while under the public gaze.
The Chinese word for religion is
"Kian." so the Roman Catholic faith
came to bo known as the "Tien Chu
Kian." Now "Chu" also means pig,
and "Kian" to squeak, so that the "Re
ligion of the Lord of Heaven" was
travestied into the "Religion of the
Squeaking Pig."
The Chinese pharmacopeia contains
many prescriptions compounded from
various parts of the human body. Thus
eyes taken from living people are sup
posed to be remarkably efficient in the
tn-.-itment of ocular disease, while the
flesh of an infant is held to possess
the most valuable tonic powers. When
the missionaries, with the aid of mod
ern drugs, succeeded in making many
wonderful cures it was an easy thing
to persuade the ignorant populace that
unholy acts were committed to obtain
these remedies. Was a child lost?
Then the missionaries were at once ac
cused of having kidnaped it. Dr.
Grelg in Manchuria once nearly for
feited his life because a little one hap
pened to stray after his carriage and
lose itÃelf. Only the opportune reap
pearance of the child saved him.

custom that the business of- a pawn-* 1

About 80 per cent of the pledges were
redeemed.
There is a great deal of poverty in
the city, and the mission seeks to re
lieve the wants of the poor by distrib
uting alms twice a month. On the Ist
and 15th of each month the old, lame,
crippled and feeble poor to the num
ber of 250 stand in a line in front of
the mission headquarters and receive
a coin which is equivalent to a quarter
of a cent. Though but a trifle, it e.n-
ables the recipient to purchase a meal,
which usually consists of a millet cake.
The "almsgiving days" are looked for
ward to by the poor with joy.
The way of the transgressor is par
ticularly hard in Kiaochau, for the
laws are stringent, and an infraction
of them is visited by speedy and se
vere punishment. Robbery is a capital .
offense. The culprit when caught is :
taken before the magistrate, tried, and
if proven guilty, taken out and be-,
headed. For crimes that are peculiarly
atrocious the Chinese have special
punishment. One of the ways in :
which they punish persons guilty of
an atrocious crime is to tie them up
and slice them to pieces.
The Presbyterian Medical Mission
numbers among its clientele 20,000 Chi
nese. The first years of the mission
work were very difficult, as the super
stitions of the Chinese had to be over
come before they would accept of med
icine or medical aid. At present tHe
Chinese prefer the foreign doctors to
those of their oivn race, and seek their
aid when the ills of the body assail
them. A few good cures had much to
do with this change, and there are
numbers of Chinese whose faith in the
medical missionaries is such that they
believe the power of the doctors does
not stop short of raising .the dead.18

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 2, 1898.
Story of a Gunner Who Deserted Rather
Thar; flttac^ His Native Place, and
tr;e Strarjge Consequences
That Followed.
THE Rock was a wall, and the wall
wus an island that hud one* been a
long promontory, like a batttemant,
jutting out hundreds of yards Into
the gulf. At one point it was iÂ»iÂ«rtÂ» <)
by an archway. Its sides were al
most sheer; its top was flat and
leveL Upon the sides there was no
verdure; upon the top centuries tad
made a preen fit-Id. The wild geese as
they flew north, myriad flocks of gulls*
gannetl and cormorants, and all man
ncr of fowl of the st;Â«, had builded upon
the top until it grew rich with grass and
shrub. The nations of the air sent their
legtoni here to bivouac. Th<- discord o."
a thousand languages might bo heard far
oat to sea or far in upon the land. Mil
lions of the feathered tUM swarmed
there; sometimes the air above was
darkened by cloada of them. " No fog bell
on a rock-bound coast might warn mari
ners more ominously than these battal
ions of adventurers on the Perce Hock.
No human being had ever mounted to
this eyrie nor Kated the bulwarks <<f
this feathered Eden. Three hundred feet
below shipbuilders might toll and fisher
men hover, but the lofty home of the
marauders of the air had not yet suf
fered the invasion of man. It was the
legend that this mighty palisade had
once been a bridge of rock stretched
across the gulf, builded by the gods of
the land who smote with granite urms
and drove back defeated the appalling
gods of the sea.
Generations of fishermen had looked
upon the yellowish, reddish limestone of
the Perce Rock with an adventuring eye,
l>ut it would seem that not even the tiny.
clinging hoof of a chamois or of a wild
K";it might find a foothold upon the
straight sides of it. Three hundred feet
was a long way to climb hand over h;m<l,
so for dentsriea the Perce Hock in the
wide St. Lawrence Gulf remained soli
tary and uneonquered.
Bat there came a day when man. the
spoiler, single-handed and alone, should
assail it.
This is the tale that is told of it: A
hundred years ago, when England was
fighting France, the i-'rcncii squadron,
fresh from destroying the fishing sta^ons
on the Islands of St. Pierre and Mique
lon, was lying off the coast of Gaspe,
near to this vast rock called Perce. Just
beyond, in llal Bale, was good shelter,
but because of the fishing posts at Perce,
where the commissariat could got fresh
fish and food, Richery, the French ad
miral, chose to lio in the tideway be
fore Perce Rock. The master gamier of
the admiral's ship waaÂ»a 7eraeyman, wl.o
being in St. Malo had been pressed into
the service. In vain he protested. There
wa* his Norman accent, his captors said;
that was evidence enough, and if be vraa
not a citizen of France he should be. for
French was his language. So he was
carried off in the Invincible, and with
her sailed the seas looking for a British
ship to fight.
His name was Antonio Robichon. and
he had owned a fishing brig called the
Charming Nancy, which tatted year after
year to this very port of Peree. hringim;
Jersey fishermen, and carrying away
again the dried rod to Europe. Wtal n
he was pressed into the French navy at
St. Malo, his brother, who was first mat.
of the Charming Nancy, took her on to
Gaspe on his brothers buataen just the
same as if the brother himself were sail
ing her.
Meanwhile Antonio was waiting in th>
tideway where he had come and gone Tor
ten years, seeing on the shore the fishing
posts of the great Comjuniper tea, and
danced with the Masters daughters.
As Antonio "leaned on his great gun,
looking out to the shore, the first day
the squadron arrived off Perce, he won
dered if the daughters were there now:
whether Minois, the youngestâ MinoiK
the madcap, Minois, the hunter, who shot
deer like a Mohicanâ was still there. It
was now two years since he had seen this
bay of Perce; she was seventeen then,
she was nineteen Minois Carnaval,
the Master's youngest daughter. An
toine had asked her for a kiss when he
bade her good-by last, and she had
laughed in his face; but he also remem
bered that she had waved her red 'ker
chief from the roof of the fishing-post a:i
the Charming Nancy sailed away, ami
that she remained on the roof as long
as the Charming Nancy could be seen.
Was she still there? And if she was.
what would she think of himâ a gunner
now on a French ship. He might be or
dered to bombard the very house where
she lived, might indeed fire the shot
which should kill her! She was French,
but she was Canadian, and her country
was now England. Two generations had
nearly passed since Canada had been
yielded up to the English, and in that
time Jersey Normans, more English than
the English, had chiefly occupied the dis
trict called Gaspe.
Antoine studied the matter hard, and
the more he thought of it the harder to
crack the nut seemed. His patriotism
was not of that sort which smiles at
martyrdom. He was of the easygoing
kind who do things because they are ex
pected to do them, from whom habit
By Gilbert Parker.
takes a load of responsibility. He was
â¢juite as well treated in this French ship
rs he would be in an English ship, and
he could be on easier terms with his
present comrades because he spoke Eng
lish badly; but these sailors could under
stand his language and he theirs. He
bad stubbornly resisted being pressed,
but be had been knocked on the headâ
and there was an end of it. What was
the good of being knocked on the head
again or being hung at the yard-arm if
one could help it? He was an expert
gunner, for he had served four years
with the artillery at Elizabeth Castle in
Jersey. When he was drafted in he nad
asked to become a gunner, and did such
excellent work against some Spanish
privateers that the admiral, delightedâ
for expert men were scarceâ pave him a
tfun. and presently, because of his great
skfl:. made him master gunner.
He grew fond of one great gun: he
called her "ma couzaine," for everything
i hat a Jersey man comes to love he calls
his cousin. His comrades, like himself,
did not have much concern with ques
tions of loyalty or patriotism. They were
ready to fight, but that was because it
was expected of them, and it would maki;
little difference to them whether it was
against the English or against the Turks,
W <vcn against another French ship.
Fighting was their trade, and they were
expected to figm the old Invincible in ac
tion for all that she was capable.
Yet Antoine had what was almost a
thrill when he yaw the British flag run
up on the posts of the Fishing Company
as they sailed into the bay. His heart,
t'">, thumped a little. Involuntarily he
looked up tii the French tricolor flying
over his head. It was curious that
there should be such a difference in two
pieces of linenâ or was it silk" N". it was
linen. Just a little different arrange
ment of color, and yet this flair on the
roof of the big fishing-shi -d seemed to
rouse his pulses to a heat.
"Man doux A*la vie! There is the fleg
of old Carnavai!" he said. 'Praps Mi
nois put it vp â that English f\^K'."
Whoever put It up there wai the Eng
lish Hag defiantly flying on the huts >f
the gn-at fishing-shed, amiâ yet! there
were the two old twenty-pounders train
ed on the French squadron.
"Oh, my good! Oh, mai grand <loux:"
said Antoine, with a low. rolling laugh;
"Oh, that is very dam funnee!"
The Bight of the British flag loosened
his tonprne ln English. It was undoubt
edly ridiculous, these two twent y-pound
eni 1 raining on :t whole fleet. Presently
there was more defianceâ a Jersey flag,
a Dice oblong piece of white linen with
two diagonal red s-.ripes; it was hoisted
en the hsiise of the Master.
"Oh my good!" said Antoine again: "it
will )>v. the old man and the three boys
next. What, what?â million thunders,
look at that."
He laughed uproariously, forgetful of
discipline, of everything save the sight of
old man Carnavai. his three sons, hnd
liis three daughters -marching with mus
kets from the house to the great shed.
AntolM heard a huigh behind him. He
looked round, then straightened himself
and stood at attention. It was Admiral
Richery, guffawing almost as loudly as
Antoine himself ha I done.
"That's n big splutter In a little pot.
gunner." paid he. 'Petticoats, too!" He
put bis telescope t< his eye. "And. son
icr, scarce 001 of their teens! The
Lord protect us. they are going to tight
my squadron!" He laughed again till the
tears came. "The ,'lory of Heaven, but
It is droll that! It is a farce au diable!
They have humor, these fisherfolk â eh,
gunner?"
"Old man Camay tl will fight just tho
same," answered Antoine, bridling up in
side.
"Oh, ho. you knuw these people, my
gunner?" said the .idmiral.
"These ten years, Excellency," answer
ed Antoine, "and l>y your leave, Excel
lency, I v.ill tell you how."
And, not waiting for permission (after
the manner of a Jerseyman), ho told, the
admiral the story of his old life, and of
his being pressed.
â¢Wry good." said the admiral coolly.
"you Jersey folk used to be Frenchmen;
now that you are a. Frenchman again,
you shall do something for the flag. You
s." that twenty-pounder yonder behind
tho wall" Very wel, dismount It. Then
we'll send in a ft-.iti of truce and parley
with 'old man Carnaval,' for his jests
an- worth attention and politeness.
There's a fellow at the gunâ no! he has
gone. Take good aim and dismount the
nun in one shot. Heady nowâ you have
a good range."
The whole matter went through An
toine's mind as the admiral spoke. If
he refused to fire hÂ« would be strung up
to the yarl-urrn, if he find and nu-st-.i
perhaps other runners wouil fire, and,
once starteu. they mignt MM the tbtt
inK-Pi'st. If lie l.red anu dismounted
the sun, the matter woiiid be only a jest,
for as such, so far, the admiral regarded
it. In dismounting the gun Â«-nd further
ing the jest, he would be sav'ng the
Carnavals, and helping Knglund too.
Well, to think that he must fire against
the place where he had got his living
these ten years! Why, he and Minois
had many a time sat gossiping on this
VÂ«ry Â«un that he was asked to dismount!
There was no time to weigh the matter
further; the admiral was frowning. So
Antoine smiled as though the business
was pleasing him. and prepared to fire.
lie cast away the tackle and breech
ings, took off the apron, pricked a car
tridge primed, bruised the priming, and
covered the vent. Then he took his
range steadily, quietly. There was a
brisk wind blowing from the southâ he
must allow for that: but the wind was
stopped somewhat in its course by the
Ferce Rock-he must allow for that He
knew the wail behind which it was, its
â¦ eSt J )art ~ he muHt take that Â«nto ac
count He had got what he thought was
the right elevation; the distance was
considerable, but he believed he could do
the business. He had a cool, some
what solid head, but his eye was quick
and well trained.
He was ready. Suddenly a girl ap
peared running round the corner of the
JUHdinp T , ma , klns straight for the gun.
It was M ' n Â° is! He himself had taught
uoTn~Â°?' tO fire that very * un - She was
Â»,oing to be gunner now. One of her
brothers was running toward the other
sun, a second was following her. An
imo^count' 1 - " c had nOt taken thl.

Antoine laid a hand on himself, as It
MnL ty I nerve in his body seemed
tingling his legs trembled, but his eye
was steady. He took the sight once more
coolly, then blew on the match The girl
was within thirty feet of the gUn " the
madcap Minois!
He blew on the match again and fired!
When the smoke cleared away he saw
that the gun was dismounted, and not
fifteen feet from it stood the girl as if
she had been turned into stone, lookingâ
looking dazedly at the gun.
He heard a laugh behind him. There
was the admiral walking away, his tele
scope under his arm. Presently Antoine
saw a boat lowered, even as one of the
20-pounders on the shore replied impu
dently to the shot he had fired. The offi
cers were laughing with the admiral and
pointing toward Antoine.
"A good shot," he heard the captain
say.
"Was it?" said Antoine to himself.
"Was it? Then it would be the last that
he would ever fire against the English.
The sight of that girl upon the short had
decided him. had quickened pome feeling
in him. He looked over the side and saw
the boat drawing away with the white
flag of truce In the hands of a midship
man. He wished he was in that boat: he
then could see Minois face to face. There
she was, talking to her father, and
stamping her foot. too. She had a tem
per, had Minois: Never mind, she was
the finest girl in all the world.
He would desert to-night. Noâ not de
s.-rt, that was not the word: he would
escape and go ashore to Minois! He
would go back to the English flag, no
matter what happened.
As he sponged the gun, his "ma cou
zaine." he madr his plans. Swish-swash,
the sponge staff ran in and out; he would
try to steal away at dog-watch. He
struck the sponge smartly on "ma eou
xaine's" muzzle, cleansing itâ he would
have to slide into the water liko a rat
and fwlm so softlyâ so softly! He reached
for a fresh cartridge and thrust it Into
the throat of "ma couzaine" an far as
he could reach, and as he laid the seam
downward, he said to himself "If they
see me, one minute I can hold my breath
under water; In one minute I can swim
a hundred yards: pood!" He lovingly
placed the wad to the cartridge, and. in
three strokes of the rammer, drove wad
and cartridge home with the precision
of a drill. It was a long swim to shore,
but if he got a fair start he thought he
could do It. As he unstopped the touch
hole and tried with the priming-wire
whether the cartridge vas home, he pic
tured to himself being challenged, per
haps by Minois. and his reply. Then ho
imagined how she would say. "Oh. my
good!" in true Jersey fashion, as he had
taught her. and thenâ well, then, he
hadn't got any further than that. Think
ing was hard work for Antoine.
By the time he had rammed homo wad
and shot, however, he had come upon a
fresh thought; and it stunned him. Tho
admiral would send a squad of men to
search for him. and if he wasn't found
they would probably bouioard the postâ
"swab the caboose," he said to himself.
As he put the apron carefully on "ma
cauzaine," he almost burst his head with
hard thinking No, It wouldn't
do to go to Perce village and take refuge
with the Carnavals.
And it wouiAn't do to make for t'.p
woods of the interior, for the old admiral
might take his revenge out of the post.
And no wonder, for. he said to himself
with a simple vanity, he, Antoine Robi
chon, was a fine gunner, and "ma couz
aine" would never behave so well with
any one else. "Ma couzaine" had been
ust .1 to playing ugly pranks at times,
especially If it was blowing fresh.
She had once torn her tackle out
of the ringbolt in the deck and had
killed more than one sailor in her mad
debauch of freedom. She had always be
haved well under his hand, and it seemed
to him that when he blew on the match
to fire her the muzzle gaped in a grin of
delight. Of course the fleet would be furi
ous at losing him, and "ma couzaine"
there, the biggest arun in the fleet, with
out her master. So they would pepper
the place if they did not find him. De
cidedly, he must not go to old man Carna
val's. No harm should come to Minois'
people that he could prevent. What was
he to do?
He leaned his nrms on the gun and
shook his head helplessly at the village;
then he turned his head away from the
land. All at once his look seemed to lose
itself in a long aisle of ever-widening,
ever-brightening arches till a vast wilder
ness of splendor swallowed it. It was a
hole in the wall, the archway piercing
the great rock. Its myriad inhabitants
shrieked and clattered and cried over
head. The shot from "ma couzaine" had
roused them, and they had risen up like a
cloud, and were scolding like a million
fishwives over this insult to their peace.
As he looked Antoine got a new Idea.
If he could get on the top of that mas
sive wall, not a hundred fleets could dis
lodge him, nor an army follow him. A
dozen stones would prevent that; one
musket could defeat any forlorn hope. He
would be the first nan that ever gay*
battle to a whole fleet. Besides, if he
took refuge on the rock there would be
no grudge against Perce village or the
Carnavals, and the admiral would not at
tack them.
There he had worked it out, and it was
now a question between him and the ad
miral and his fleet; the Carnavals were
out of it. There was the young sous-lieu
tenant now on the shore with his flag of
truce, talking to "ol" man Carnaval."
There was Minois not ten feet away, and
there was the young sous-lieutenant bow-
Ing and scraping to her. "Man doux d'la
vie, what did he mean by that?" reflected
Antoine. It was all right between old
man Carnaval and the sous-lieutenantâ
that was clear. There they were all
shaking hands now. It was surer than
ever that he, Antoine, must carry on a
campaign independent of the Carnavals.
If he didn't succeed, why then he would
be hanged to the yardarm or shot. But
if he stayed where he was on the Invin
cible, he was in just as much danger
from the British gun in battle.
"Ba su!" Antoine said to himself, the
only thing was to try and climb Perce
Rock. What a thing to tell if he did it
and came safe out of the scrape. It
would increase the worth of the Charming-
Xancy at least 50 per cent. Certainly he
must do it. He had pointed out to Minois
two years ago the spot where he thought
it could be done. Just at this particular
point the wall was not quite so steep, and
there were narrow ledges and lumps of
stone and natural steps and footholds
and little pinnacles which the fingÂ«rs
could grip and where a man might rest.
The weather had been scorching hot. too.
the rocks were dry as a bone and there
would be no danger of slipping.
Yes, he would try it in any case. He
would be deserter, patriot, adventurer,
gunner, master of the Charming Nancy
and Jersey man all in one. He woud need,
what? If he got to the top he would
need twine tor hauling up rope â the Car
navals would give him rope when the
time came. He would need stone and
flint, and he also had some matches. A
knife, a hammer and. one quiltâ he must
have the quilt for the nights, though he
well knew what the weight of it would
mean in climbing. Then there was food.
Well, perhaps he should starve to death
up there, but he would take what was
left of to-day's rations, of which he had
i;it,ti very Httle; there was about a
half-pound of biscuit, near half a pint
of peas, a half-pint of oatmeal and two
ounces of cheese. He could- live on that
for at least three days. He also had a
horn of good arrack. When that was
gone, well, he was taking chances! If
he died of thirst it was no worse than the
yardarm. The most important thing 1 was
;i few "hundred feet of fine strong twine,
and he knew there was as much as he
needed in the storeroom among the
cordage. He would get that at once and
conceal it, for it was the one thing he
could not do without.
There was the sous-lieutenant coming
back to the Invincible; he was waving
his hand toward Minois. It was all very
fine, he reflected, fretfully, to be a sous
lieutenant and wear a gold-handled
sword; but he, Antoine, would climb
Perce Rock, and the fleet and Minois and
the sous-lieutenant should see him do a
thing that had never before been done.
But how would Minois know who it
was perched on Perce Rock? He had not
thought of that. What signal was there"
There was none that he knew. Well, if
he got away safely from the Invincible
he would go to old mati Carnaval's, let
her know, and then go straight to the
Perce Rock. Though it would be moon
light, the path of ascent was on the south
side, out of the view of the fleet.
Very well; that settled it. He patted
"ma couzaine" tenderly. He was sorry
to leave her, but it had to be.
He was. however, a man of habit. The
rest of the day he did his duty as faith
fully as thoygh he expected to be at his
post the next morning. He gave the us
ual instructions to the gunsmith and art
morer: he inspected the small arms; ha
ebosc a man, as was his custom, for the
gunroom watch: and he ate his supper
phlegmatically when the hour came.
It was the last quarter of the moon and
the neap tide was running low, when An
toine let himself down softly into the
WSter. He had the blanket tied to hja
head, the food, matches and so on were
inside the blanket, and the twine was in
his pocket. He had not been seeo, and
he dropped away quietly astern. Another
ship lay in' his path, and he must be care
ful in passing her. He had got clear ol
the Invincible while tjj'e moon was par
tially obscured. Now, however, it was
shining, but not very brightly) He
came so near the other ship that ha
could see the watch, and he could smell
the hot tar and pitch which had been
used on the seams after calking. There
was no sea and very little wind, and the*
watch was not alert. He was so close, at
one moment that he could hear the
laughter of the young foremast men au
they turned in. He moved his arms very
gently, propelling himself chiefly by hia
legs. At las/ he was clear of the fleet.
Now it was a question of when his de
sertion would be discovered. ' All he ask
ed was two clear hours. By that time
the deed would be donÂ», ir he could climb,
the Perce Rock at all.
He touched bottom; he was so far safe.
He was on the Perce sands. His blanket
was scarcely wetted. He wrung the wa
ter out of his clothes, and ran softly up
the shore. Suddenly he was met by a cry
of "Halt" and a "Who goes .there?" and
he stopped short at the point of a bayo
net. He recognized the voice; it was old
man Carnaval's.
He said "Sh!" and gave his nameâ
Antoine Robkhon of the Charming
Nancy. The old man knew the voice. He
nearly dropped his musKet in surprise.
Antoine's tale of his misfortunes was
soon given, but he had not yet told of
his present plans when he heard a quick
footstep, and Minois was at her father's
side. Unlike the old man, she did drop
her musket, and -with an exclamation im
pulsively threw her arms round his neck
and kissed him on the. cheek.
"There!" she said, "that's for the cap
tain of the Charming Nancy, who's coma
in through a fleet of Frenchmen!" She
thought he had stolen into the harbor
with his little ship under the very nose
of the admiral and his squadron.
Ruefully Antoine had to tell her the
truth. She trembled with excitement at
the story of how he had been pressed at
St. Malo and all that came after until
this very day when he had dismounted
the gun not fifteen feet from where she
stood.
"Man alive!" she said; "it is you, An
tointâ it was you that dismounted that
gun and nearly killed me!"
"It v.as hard work not killing you," he
answered.
"Go along with Minois," said ol' man
Carnaval. "Moise is at the house; he'll
help you pet away into the woods."
That wus not Antoine's plan, but he
did not intend it for Carnaval's ears.
Time was short, his position was peril
ous. He offered no explanation to the Old
man, but hurried away with Minois, tell
ing her his purpose as he went. Sud
denly she stopped short.
"Antoine Robiihon," said she, "you're a
fool! You can't climb the Perce Rock.
No one has ever Uone it, and you mustn't
try; you'll be safe where Moise will hide
you. You shan't climb the rock â ah, no!
no!" She did not understand his reasons.
He pointed toward the Post.
"They wouldn't leave a stick standing
there if you hide me. No, I'm going to
the top of Perce, or break my neckâ
via!"
Here was a revelation! She had never
thought Antoine capable of so much
thinking. For a moment she could only
say, "Mon doux terrible! Mon doux terri
ble! Just think of thatâ to save us all
and to climb Perce Rock!"
Then his intention suddenly inspired
her. '
"Antoine," she said, clutching his arm,
"if you go to the top of Perce Rock, bo
will I!"
In spite of his anxiety he langhed.
"Ah, ba, all right!" he said, M but I
must get up first. Then I'll drop a cord
and you'll tie on a small rope if you've
got enough. You'll tie it round your
waist and come on, and then if you slip .
or get tired I'll hold you safe with- .the
rope. But see â but see," his voice drop
ped, "you can't stay tip there with me. all
alone, Minois â and besides, it wouldn't do ...
â the admiral'd be firing on you too!""' . â 
"I can't stay alone with you, 'nvpn,.\

have slapped his face. "I'd like to know,
why I can't. If you ever want â me to

"Then I'll go straight to t fie Bock ;

"If I get up," he said, "I'll .let the .siring :"â¢...'

girl, with a sudden change of -mood. "To

aYms round her. she pushed him away,
dashed the tears from her eyes, and bade
him go. .' â  â â 'â â '.'. â .
He had a new confidence, in his enter
prise. Hadn't Minois kissed him? Hadn't
she wiped the tears out of her eyes?
Hadn't she wanted to come with him to
the top of Perce Rock? She was the sort
of girl to be the wife of the master of the
Charming Nancy! Without doubt she
was. But if she came to Perce Rock, if
she got vp â well, he'd get up .: himself
.first, and then he'd .try and think out the
rest of it, but thinking was terribly, hard "
work. It was worse than flghting a ship
to leeward of the enemy.
The tide was now well out: the mooh
was shining very brightly. He reached
the point where, if the Rock was to be
scaled at all, the ascent must be made.
For a distance there was shelving where
a fair foothold might be had by a fear
less "man, with a steady head and sure
balance. After that came about a hun

AGAINST THE GOLDEN GATE
Sea Captains, Pilots and Lookouts Re
late the Stories of tr;e Most
Thrilling Shipwrecks
on thje Bar.
THOUGH there is a common belief that there is little
.i.-mjrer in following the calling of a pilot in the waters
adjacent to the Golden Gate it is well known that
sailors regard the San Francisco bar as one of the
most dangerous in the world when great storms are
raging.
Boarding incoming steamers and piloting ships in rough
â urather are two of the most dangerous services that the
can affords. Local history teems with the memory of
thrilling experiences, the distressing pictures of men swept
rb'.ard, of ships swamped by mountain Â»vaves, and of
.it vessels tossed like corks upon an angry sea and
â¢.â â¢. iiy beaten to mere flotsam and jetsam by the fury of
. ihi: ; storm.
..:.-' .Within the past twenty years San Francisco harbor has
rnished nearly a score of disasters of tne sea full of
; harrowing details.
line hears these stories in their simplicity and with a
. .fine salt flavor along the water-front, at the pilots' head
quarters, or at some of the local bars of the shore â between
drinks.
â¢'There are countless dangers in our business," said
Captain r.arber of the pilot association, a few days ago.
"In line weather all is well, but the danger Is beyond imag
ination when the seas are sweeping over the masts of
powerful ships, when the rait- .'.ll seems in favor of the
storm, and when the hearts of the hardy old Â»ea-dogs are
liHed with the fear that they will never see the shore
again."
Boarding an ocean steamer or a great sailing vessel is a
comparatively trifling feat when she lies broadside on, when
the water under her !â¢ â¢< is almost glassy ana the swell is
gentle. But in a cross sea. with the wind in every direc
tion, or when great breakers are dashing violently over her
decks a pilot takes hifi life in his hands, for he runs the
-k of being swept away or dashed into pulp against the
sides, of the ship when it "blows great guns." The great
iathans of th< leep often remain comparatively quiet
whiie the little yawls with pilots aboard are dashed vio-
ly with e\ â¢rj coming wave.
In the local story of wild nights on the bar there are
".nian> instan s of human lives snuffed out as if tney were
bits of pap* i devoured by an angry flame. The appeals of
drownii .-â â ' l iheir cries of terror have been voice
less amid the thunderous rebeDcwings of the deep, the
hurricam s have swept over them in the silence and mists
ly niiiht..- â and the record of their instant loss has
mpl< ted the story of their lives.
. . Scarcely less dangerous than the adventures of pilots
' th^ masters of tug boats. Though the dar;
a different character they have much in com
".. â  rnon. A foundering ship, like a drowning man, is likely
< arry d< \vn its rescuers in the vortex, or to lure them
;!âº:-! tb as rocks where tug boats and ships alike
dashed to atoms on the rocky shore. The experiences
of pilots and masters of tug boats are interesting, ard the
stories they tell of the wildest nights they ever experienced
on/the bar areÂ«as thrilling as those of the storm wrecked
Robinson Crusoe. Here are some of them:

and all en board, including sixteen

it was a scene never to be forgotten. No boat could have
survived beyond the heads. Just at this time an enormous
sea threw one of the lifeboats partly under and athwart
the bow of the tug and the keeper shouted, "Cut the tow
line."
When the storm was raging with the greatest violence
the bunker plates were lifted and the bunkers filled with
water, which came over the fire room floor and almost up
to the furnaces. Darkness crept on as the swelling ocean
rolled high and it was impossible to catch sight of men or
boat. It was by a supreme effort that the crew kept the
life boat oft' the rocky lee shore, toward which the fierce
tempest, the strong eddy and the heave of the sea were
driving her. At this moment, while making our way into
harbor to undergo repairs, we extended a line to the life
boat trying to save her crew.
One of the great difficulties of the night was the in
tense darkness, and the rain was so blinding that nothing
could be seen on the surging bosom of the tempestuous
sea. Whenever I think of the way the Elizabeth was
pounded to pieces, whenever I again recall the roaring
of the gale and the deep thunders of the sea I say to my
self that it is a wonder we were not all lost in the terrible
disaster which forever silenced seventeen lives and left
the Elizabeth a total wreck on a rocky shore.
The most tempestuous venture I ever experienced was
some years ago in the storm which nearly swamped the
ship Rons. I was piloting this
ship out of the heads and the pilot
l>'>at Lady Mine was following us
to take me off and back to shore.
Suddenly the gale became so
heavy that it would have blown
any man out of the water and
STORY OF CAPTAINI
G. E. WALLACE. ;
swamped any boat that might have been launched. The
ship plunged like a thing of life and shivered every time
she was struck by the mountainous seas. From my posi
tion in the pilot house I could see the spray dash over the
masthead of the Lady Mine. Captain Boyd, who was on
the pilot boat, says he could not see our ship at all and
he felt that those on the Lady Mine had all they could
do to keep from foundering in the mighty seas.
The fury of the storm increased from hour to hour and
gave no promise of abating till late in the night. We put
out to sea and the only way I got back to San Francisco
was to wait until the calm the next day, during whiÂ«'h the
pilot boat had no trouble taking me aboard. I have heard
a great many stories of gales, choppy seas and all that,
but I will match the furious breakers which dashed so
wildly over the masthead of the Lady Mine against any
thing I ever read in stories of the sea or heard told at
the hearthstones where old tars gather and narrate ex
periences of the deep.
Sandy Honk pilots have to contend with wind and ice
and frost and snow. We are exempt from these compara
tively harmless terrors, but we have some of the most
terrific southeaster? and southwesters that can be imag
ined. The trouble with our bar is that its extent is so vast
that the area of all American bars is insignificant in com
parison.
I think one of the worst disasters that ever came under
my observation was the wreck of the Galeb Curtis Â£>n the
11th of April, 1867. She foundered
on the bar and all were lost,
among them Captain John Shan
der, Aurelius Buckingham. Harry
Van Ness and seven others. This

was a terrific southeast storm.
The fury of the elements was p<>
great that nothing could withstand the wind. After the
storm had apparently reached its maximum the sea sud
denly grew heavier and the velocity <f the- v.?nd greater.
It was thus, amid the deafening roar of the waves and
the soughing violence of the veritable hurricane that the
Curtis and ;>.II on board went down despite everything th--y
could do. The memory of hat terrible catastrophe of the
sea is enough to give this coast a record, even If it has
the name of being a pacific region.
Some of the most interesting stories of the dangers of
the bar in stormy weather naturally come from the govern
ment observation stations, where Uncle Sam's eagle-eyed
marine \v;it<-hmen keep vigil during perilous as well as
calm weather. John Hyslop, one of the best known ob
servers on the coast, tills an interesting story of the wreck
of the wrecking schooner Samson, which was stranded
and destroyed by fire January 4, 1816, near Point Bonita,
at which time the crew of the Reliance, acting in con
junction with the Fort Point life saving station, braved
one of the worst seas ever witnessed in the vicinity of the
Golden Gate. â  Keeper Hyslop'i story is as follows:
It was during a midnight tempest which the govern
ment report says passed the mark among big storms. It

any storm of recent years.
When Lifeboat Keeper Hodgson
appealed for aid the tug Reliance
Kvely responded despite the dan
iÂ»us weather.
LOOKOUT HYSLOP'SI
STORY.
Shortly after tfie tteliance left
the Fort Point station with the lifeboat in tow the storm
proved so severe that neither tho master of the Reliance
nor the keeper of the station deemed it wise <>r incumbent
on them to venture further while darkness prevailed. Turn
ing back a little distance to await the approach of daylight,
they again steamed out, with a tremendous tempest raging
at their back and a lee shore of the most terrific character
ahead.
The schooner's boat containing the shipwrecked men
was so close in shore when discovered that not only cour
age but sound judgment and ex. client seamanship were
required to reach it and rescue the crew. This was all
accomplished amid the crashing of the elements and the
constant boarding of heavy seas. Keeper Hodgson took
his lifeboat in among the rocks close to the Samson, to
make sure that there were no others needing assistance.
Throughout all that tempestuous night it was all that
skillful officers and brave men could do to preserve their
own lives as well as those of the persons tney were out
to rescue.
The Samson was lost after a long and perilous record
in the vicinity of the wrecked steamship City of New York.
She had remained at anchor near the New York through
the stormy season, though the master of the Samson con
sidered the place unsafe, owing to the rocky bottom and
the high almost perpendicular cliffs abutting the shore
close by. On January 3 the wind, which had been light
from the southeast for two or three days, increased greatly,
with every prospect of growing stronger. The Samson,
though heavily anchored and also moored at the stern,
soon felt the force of the gale to such an extent that it
was considered advisable to let her swing free at her an
chor; early in the forenoon her stern moorings were cast
off. Between 10 and 11 o'clock she was tugging fiercely
at the single chain and rolling and pitching so violently
that a second anchor was let go. Up to this time the
crew seemed confident that they were not in much danger,
but an hour later the schooner began to drag her anchors,
and, as she was not provided with motive power, all hands
realized that they were in great peril and helpless. So
the signals of distress were set.
I shall never forget those signals. An old and well
whipped American ensign, two and a half by five feet,
was hoisted on the mainmast while a gray blanket and a
white sheet below it were shown on the whip of the der
rick, which stood forward of the foremast. These signals
were not seen, owing to the blinding rain, but a boat
was sent to appeal for aid. Signals were plven by the
lighthouse wharf siren and it was not long until the Re
liance was OB the scent;. With the descent of darkness
the storm grew heavier, but the crew of the Samson, in
stead of taking to their boats while they could, simply set
anchor lights and remained at the mercy of the gale. When
Captain Silovich arrived the storm was picking up the
tops of the seas, filling the air thick with spoon drift, and
the darkness was so intense that nothing could be dis
tinguished a ship's length ahead, while the tug had all
she could do to hold her own windward.
While all this was going on the gale ashore turned to a
hurricane. Lighthouse men had to crawl on their hands
and knees to avoid being blown over the bluff. With every
heave of the sea the doomed vessel dragged a little nearer
to the nxk-bound shore and at half past 3 her disheartened
crew set to work to get their boats afloat, the first one
launched b* ing a small yawl. Divers James Dolan and
George Baker got into the yawl, which at once broke adrift
and was swept leeward in the darkness, since which time
nothing has ever been heard of the men or the slightest
fragment of the yawl.
Wh-n daylight appeared the tup and the lifeboat began
the search for the schooner or her crew. Every eye swept
the expanse of waters, but the dense mists and blinding
sheets of rain were almost impenetrable to the vision
Finally bosk >f the crew were discerned in a boat near
the shi>r.\ fiercely battling to keep their boat away from
the rocks. They were almost worn out after their long
contest with the storm. It was plain to be seen that the
rescuers had a perilous undertaking, but it was equally
plain that unless they acted promptly the boat of the
crew would be dashed to pieces on the rocks and all aboard
drowned. The Reliance,
therefore, boldly drop
ped further inshore, and
th" lifeboat cast off
with the purpose of
drifting to the ship
wrecked men and tak
ing them in tow. Lines
were carefully thrown
at the moment when
the tup: was close
aboard and the eight
een men of the crew
were MKMfI without
mishap. Just after the
lifeboat cast anchor in
the vicinity of the ship
wrecked sailors a tre
mendous sea rush' 1 to
ward her and threat
ened to pitch her upon
the rocks, but the
fortunately stuod the
strain.
I have seen a great
many of the severest
storms that have ever
been witnessed on this
coast, and I am of the
opinion that some of the more
notable ones will rank in violence
and dangers to ships with any in
the world. This is because the bar
is targe and very shallow, being
but five fathoms for a great dis
tance.
TORY OF CAPTAIN
GEORGE. SCOTT.
One of the most violent tempests in local history \v;)s
that which destroyed the pilot boat Relief and her crew in
March, 1863. The pilots had got a^ay from the boat but
ihe crew was not able to escape. The moment of the
disaster was one of the most memorable in the nistory of
high seas out here. Billows were rolling as high as moun
tains, seas were breaking and the elements rrere ?trÂ«iiigely
at war. At the fatal moment a heavy s.-a lifted the Relief
almost out of the water and turned her overbaexward. That
Fettled it, and the whole disaster was over in a moment.
This occurred about six miles from tYie Cliff House on
one of the most dangerous places on the bar.
Another wild night was the time when the pilot boat
Commodore T. 11. Allen was cut in twain by th â¢â¢ U\? ship
Star William Wallace. This was many years ago. Oapt.iin
Fai ocr had a hard time getting away. It WBM n strange

followed the- next by sharp squalls and blinding rain.
Nobody was lost, but it was a most exciting event. T"ne
disaster occurred about 9 p. m., and there was very little
time for any delay. As soon as the officers saw that they
had been done for there was the quickest launching of
boats on record. It was as bad as the wrecks of the year
1559, when several big sehoc-jers were lost on
the rocky coast.
Then there was the strange experience of the
ship Bremen. It was about 1880 that she was
"driven ashore on the soy.th side of the F&ial
lones Islands and was a t<Â» al loss, though some
of the crew were saved. The escape of the cap
tain was one of the meat miraculous of all the
events one will hear a'/ong the water front when
tars tell tales of the sea. When the wreck was
driven ashore the certain was spry enough to
drop from the jib ty>om <>n to the rocks near
where the fog siren was located. It was at this
mo-ment that the. attendant of the fog signal
apparatus was r.bout to blow a Warring to th-
distressed sailors to show them where they
were. Just as the man was about to sound the
fog signal th'Â» captain of the wrecked ship ap
peared on a "huge rock in front of the station.

"Yi.'u needn't blow the thing now," shouted
the almost exhausted captain. "It's all over

REASONS WHY GEORGE VANDERBILT ABANDONED BILTMORE.
Royal Way in Which
the $10,000,000
Estate Was
Run
ACHELOR GEORGE VANDER
BBILT, millionaire grandson of
the commodore, and one of the
greatest matrimonial catches in
the country, has left his baro-
nial estate, Biltmore, in North
Carolina, and has gone off to India to
shoot tigers and kill time till the con
tractors finish mending the drinking
â water supply of his magnificent es
tablishment. It has cost this scion of
the Vanderbilts at least $10,000,000 to
develop this colossal estate up to hia
ideas of what a home should be, and
now the owner is going to take a rest
till the leaks in the Biltmore pipes are
patched.
Most people have only a befogged
idea of Biltmore. They know that it
is located somewhere in the Blue Ridge
Mountains, and that George Vander
bilt is reputed t" have spent a fortune
on it, but there their knowledge ends.
But such people as tn?se have never
seen Biltmore. They have never stood
on the rampedouce at Biltmore" House
and watched the sun come up over the
peaks of the Blue Ridg'- Mountains un
til it seemed to set the whole dome of
the sky on fire. They have never at
evening studied the wonderful changes
in the atmosphere as the sun sinks,
brilliantly coloring every cloud to a
bright copper hue. which changes
gradually through every warm shade,
red and pink and green, until at last
only the gray of night is left.
It was these beauties of the North
Carolina mountains that first attracted
the attention of George Vanderbilt. It
is related that the first time he came
to Asheville, which is the pretty little
town nearest to his estate, it was rain
ing, and he was so disgusted with the
general appearance of things that he
ordered his special car to be ready to
take him away the following morn
ing.
Fortunately for Asheville and the fu
ture of Biltmore, the weather cleared
during the night, and the next morn
ing George Vanderbilt, rising early,
was treated to the sight of one of those
glorious sunrises. Rt countermanded
the order with regard to his car and
concluded to stay the day out at least.
Standing on the piazza of the Bat
tery Park Hotel, he looked away to the
north and saw the peak of the Roan
Mountain, in Tennessee, a distance of
sixty miles. Southward was the grim
outline of Caesars Head, a mountain
in South Carolina, fifty miles away.
To the west, dim in that blue haze
which gives to this range of mountains
its name, was the Georgia line, ninety
miles away. To the east, standing
bare and bleak and reflecting from its
summit the sun's rays, that fell upon
its snows, was Mount Mitchell, the
highest peak east of the Rocky Moun
tains.
George Vanderbilt was charmed with
this view, as is every one else that seea
it. The plateau upon which Asheville
stands lies in the shallow cup of the
mountains as the bottom lies in a sau
cer. To the beauties of the mountain
scenery was added a climate that
seemed to tingle with health. The more
young Vanderbilt studied the situation
the more he became pleased with it.
He sent word to the railroad to side
track his special car until further or
ders, which were not given for six
weeks afterward.
In the meantime he rode and drove
through all the mountains of the neigh-
borhood. One day, when he had ridden
V to the top of a mountain and had stood
â  for a long time, delighted with the
â  ; view, the idea came to him that this
: would be a splendid place in which to
: establish a grand estate that would in
"â -." its proportions and equipment -.-ival
any of the great baronial possession*
; of the Old World. He conceived jthe
::.. scheme of building there, in the heart
. of those smoky peaks, a castle such
/.. as America had not known before. He
selected a site already occupied }>y a
. Southern millionaire and offered to
\ purchase it, but the Southerner would
: not sell.
Then young Vanderbilt decided to
'â â :â¢;!.. make a site for himself better than any
in the neighborhood. He bought a tract
. : of land on which was a high mountain.
FORT GUNNY BAGS, the former
home of the "Vigilance Commit
tee," is the present abode of
spices and such things. There
are two windows near the dusty
staircase, and from one of these
windows James P. Casey, who
stabbed James King of William, the
â editor of the Bulletin, was hanged.
At the same time the body of Charles
CoraÂ» who killed United States Mar
shal Richardson, swung from the other
window.
. ' On the day that Cora and Casey
were hanged the majority of the popu
lation had gathered along the streets
in front of the Unitarian church to
pay a slight tribute of respect to
James King of William. Pio
: neers say that just as the pall
bearers reached the first steps
the bell on the top of the Vigilance
Committee's building was heard to toll
distinctly thrice. Just what the Rev.
E. T. Gray and the officiating pall
bearers and mourners did is a matter
': . of some dispute, but that signal was
too well known to the citizens, and
â  : one and all made an earnest effort to
reach the little gray building which is
'. â¢ now a storage place for spices.
As they ran those who raised their
eyes to the second story saw the two
murderers swung out to their death.
Afterward, when the labors of the
"'Vigilance Committee" were no longer
needed and the guarding six-pounders
allowed outsiders to pass up the now
dust begrimed steps, and enter through
' ' the unseen door, the rooms were visited
â by thousands of people.: They were
. iecorated- with such relics as the ropes
with which Cora and Casey were
hanged, the razor with which "Yankee
Sullivan" committed suicide, the arms
taken from the Law and Order Com
pany, and the sword worn by John L.
Durkee, whose, membership in the com
mittee itself did not prevent his being
tried for piracy. . .
The Unitarian (jfcurch from which
James King of William was buried
still stands in its original place on
Stockton street, near Sacramento. It
a-jui dedicated to its sacred offices in
BILTMORE HOUSE, THE HOHE RESIDENCE, ON GEORGE VANDERBILTS $10,000,000 ESTATE IN THE NORTH
CAROLINA HOUNTAIN3.
Nature had not intended this mountain
for a building such as Vanderbilt
contemplated, and so George sat about
to correct the errors of nature. He
simply cut off the top of the mountain,
and with that part which was cut ft"
he built an addition to the part that
was left, making the site on which
Biltmore House now stands.
And before we go any further, it is
just as well to understand that in
speaking of this wonderful Vanderbilt
possession a distinction is made be
tween Biltmore and Biltmore House.
Biltmore is the whole estate. Biitmore
House is the castle.
The fact that George Vanderbilt had
undertaken to. alter the Blue Ridge
Mountains to suit his purpose in erect
ing a mansion at once called to him
the attention of the whole of Western
North Carolina. ' A man that could
move mountains must be a person of
importance, the natives argued.
There was something else about
George, however, that proved even
more attractive. It was the fact that
he didn't seem t<Â» care what anything
cost. Now, a man of that description
anywhere is always a mark for people
who have things to sell. He was a
special mark in North Carolina, The
first tract of land that George Van
derbilt bought there was known as the
old Patton plantation. The year before
this property came into Mr. Vander
bilt's possession it was offered in the
open market for $20,000. He paid $87,
500 in cash for it.
Just as soon as the terms of this sale
became known everybody in Buncombe
County wanted to sell George Vander
bilt real estate. He accommodated
many of them. He bought farm after
farm adjoining his property at prices
that made the farmers hilarious with
joy.
But this sort of acquisition was not
rapid enough for the young millionaire.
He wanted something big and he
wanted it quick. The highest point in
his immediate neighborhood was the
peak of Mount Pisgah. As there was
nothing too high for George he bought
Pisgah. In order to get the peak he
took with it what was known as the
Pisgah forest tract. It was real estate
belonging to the Cameron family, and
numbered 107,000 acres. The Camerons
had paid 35 cents an acre for it. George
paid $1 50 an acre. But this was only
a bagatelle to what the ultimate cost
proved to be. He had surveys made,
established new lines, marked new
boundaries and altogether made im
provements until the final cost to him
was something like $20 an acre.
At this time he seems to have had
some little touch of that spirit of hunt
ing that has led him away to India. He
established a great game preserve on
Mount Pisgah. and there built a hunt
ing lodge at the cost of $25,000. He
stocked the preserve with deer and
bear and game birds aod fish at a cost
corresponding to the rest of it. If
George ever killed anything on the Pis
gah preserve nobody In Asheville ever
heard of it. It is known that he went
a few times to the lodge, but it is not
TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE FAMOUS HOUSES OF PIONEER DAYS.
July. 1853, and after the Rev. K. T.
Gray resigned his post, it became the
church of Thomas Starr King. The
church where he once poured forth his
eloquence now bears a sign with the
inscription. "A. M. E. Church of Zion."
Chinatown boasts possession of what
remains of the first Baptist church ever
builded in San Francisco. The Rev. O.
C. Wheeler started in a tent in 1549. and
later was enabled \o build a very re
spectable looking building wherein to
worship. But the corner stone that was
laid with devout ceremony now holds
aloft a Chinese barber shop and the
walls that were dedicated to holy uses
now look upon strange sights in the
dens within and at the filth and
wretchedness without.
There is another church of the same
denomination on Mission street, a fash
ionable section some years later than
"49. Its walls have a leaden look and
its roof seems to shrink away from the
light of day, and it is struggling to
maintain its ancient dignity in the
present garb of a second-hand store. In
the place where the altar stood (al
though it seems an extravagant fancy)
there stands a pile of old and rusted
iron and dilapidated stoves. Along the
walls hang every conceivable article
that can be upheld by means of a peg
or nail. And high up the rafters are
hung with cobwebs and the walls are
covered with the dust of time.
There is a little worn church on How
ard street which bears its broken win
dows and neglected surroundings
bravely and tries to hide Its face
behind the sign of an athletic associa
tion. On Clay street, near Battery,
there is one that the first settlers in
Ban Francisco worshiped in and which
now shelters all sorts of furniture.
Another church which used to frown
religiously at a Sunday smile now
Btares calmly at the greenness of our
gracious park and supplies the Sun
day pleasure-seekers with cycles.
THE SAX FRANCISCO (ALL, SFNDAY, JAXIARY 2, 1898.
recorded that he ever fired a shotgun
there.
On the posts at Biltmore House are
marble figures of mythological crea
tures, half women ar.<l half lion?, that
were imported by George Vanderbilt
from Rome for the decorative purpose
that they serve. To the average visitor
permitted to drive through the Hilt more
estate, the rampe douce and the li"ii
ladies are the only objects at Biltmore
House that may be closely Inspected.
No stranger is peimitted to come within
a hundred yards of the house itself.
This was not always so. In the be
ginning George Vanderbilt very gener
ously permitted the general public to
wander about and study his house
closely from the outside. But the spirit
of vandalism which makes itself ap
parent in the conduct of most tourists
appeared here in such an aggravated
form that the house, the statuary and
all other objects that could be dipped
with hammers were attacked and de
faced until it became necessary tor the
preservation of his property to forbid
any one not Mr. Vanderbilt's own guest
to come within reaching distance of
his perishable property.
It required seven years to build Bilt
more House, and the cost of the struct
ure is estimated at |2,000,0 M. The in
terior <>f the house is far more inter
esting than the exterior. It has about
ninety rooms in all. Of the most of
these it is not necessary to go into any
description. The interesting features
are the library and the bathtub. Th-
latter is very large and of solid Italian
marble, and is round in shape like a
baptismal font.
The library is in height half that of
the whole house, while the length is the
breadth of the house â fully fifty feet.
It is finished in Circassian walnut, im
ported for the purpose from the shores
of the Red Sea. In one end r* an im
mense fireplace, over which â  stair runs
to the second tier of book shelves. The
ceiling is made of a tapestry brought
from an old European palace. The
shelves are filled with rare books. < >n.
of these is a copy of the first edition of
Bunyan's "Pilgrim Progress."
Leading from the library is George
Vanderbilt's "don." which is finished
like the larger room in the same <'ii
cassian walnut from th<- shonfl "f the
Red Sea, The door connecting th<' two
apartments is carved so as to repre
sent the life-size figure of a monk lift
ing his finger to his lips, the signal for
silence. It is in these two apartment?
that George Vandorbilt takes his
greatest joy in Biltmore House.
Another room that invites study is
known as the tapestry room, one side
of which is hung with fine old portieres
and the walls of which are devoted to
family portraits. Among these is an
excellent picture of himself and a splen
did portrait of his mother.
The latter occupies the place of honor
and illustrates in that occupation the
devotion of George Vanderbilt to one
who, through his life and till she died,
was more to him than all else.
On the corner of Waverly place and
Clay street is a plain two-story build
ing, and ChIMM occupy every square
inch of it. The lower portion is a mar
ket, with a wondrous display of pecu
liar fish and vegetables and Chinese
with ancient looks. No passer-by to
day would believe that this place was
the first postoffiee in San Francisco,
and the late* Captain of Police John
Short was the first Postmaster.
Afterward the office was re
moved to the northeast cor
ner of Kearny and Clay streets.
The offices of the stages that ran
from here to San Jose and Santa Crui
and Monterey were in the front ;if the
building and the single fare to Mon
terey by stage was $20. Formerly the
Law and Order party occupied this
same building, and it was also the first
building in the city to be graced by
the presence of a melodeon, and was
where Lottie Crabtree made her debut
in the Bella Union Theater and insured
her future success.
Within the environments of China
town there are twy other interesting
buildings whose complexion has con
siderably changed. On the northwest
corner of Jackson and Dupont streets
is the old Globe Hotel. At one time the
tourists occupied the roc/ms and paid
$3 a day for the privilege. Now the
place that afforded comfort for about
two hundred and fifty guests harbors
nearly a thousand Chinese, and it has
grown black in the face in the doing cf
it. And the awnings that once fluttered
gaily now, tattered and torn, wav â 
aloft Chinese signs and signals and
torn umbrellas and garments that aro
strange in the fashioning. And there
is a "melee of horns and hoafs and
heads" in windows and doors and
cracks and the odors that come from
the openings are staling.
Just above Stockton street, on Jack
son, Dr. Toland, the founder of Toland
College, built a home and built it
strong and true for himself and his
The pictures, the tapestries on cloth
"f gold, the antique portieres and the
other decorations of this room make it
exquisit<- in its effect.
Adjoining the libarary is the grand
banquet room of Biltmore House, it is
ninety feet long, forty feet wide, and
the hf-ight of the house itself. In one
end "f this magnificent chamber is an
organ loft, from which it was expected
thÂ»* master of Biltmore would pour
forth the music to which he is devoted,
and which he has always loved so well.
â¢Mi the walls of this banquet hall are
the flags of the thirteen original States
of the Union. In the end opposite the
organ loft is a grand fireplace, or rath
er three fireplaces in one. with a great
marble slab topping the three, and
bearing a superbly carved hunting
scene cut in the stone.
Then there is a wonderful stone spi
ral staircase that is s-lf-supporting,
the grand billiard room and the swim
ming pool in the basement, ami a doaen
other things of interest of the interior
of this remarkable house.
There is one feature, however, the
great winter garden, that should not be
omitted. Here th.- sunlight falls sharp
ly in the winter time, and the presence
of plants gives a suggestion of sum
mer. Into it every hall leads. It is the
grand central ending of all the corri
dors in Biltmore House.
Interesting as the interior of Bilt
more House is. and great as is the
mansion when one is in it, the aatate
itself so far dominates the house that
when one contemplates it as a whole
the house sinks into Insignificance
From the gates of Biltmore on the
east, in a straight line across the
mountains to Hominy Valley in the
wet, is a distance of thirty-five miles.
George Vanderbilt owns it all. What
the average width of his possessions is
\s-iy few peraona know, but the total
number of acres in the estate is one
hundred and twenty thousand.
But the most wonderful part of this
vast estate is th>' way it has been im
proved. In the first place, Vanderbilt
stiiM" <\ vast areas of his property of
all the undergrowth and shrubbery.
And when he had made bare these
mountains he began to take the shrubs
from other mountains and replant
them. F"r six years this sort of thing
been going on, under the direction
of an army of men that do nothing
els.-, and that are distinguished in their
occupation by a sort of green livery
which they always wear. The number
of trees and shrubs thus planted is al
most beyond estimate. There are mil
lions of than. Old and worn and bar
ren fields have been reclaimed and now
bristle with young pine, spruce and fir
trees. As one drives through this won
derful estate he encounters masses of
honeysuckle, redolent with perfume in
springtime, and now in winter time ly
ing red and yellow on the ground, like
a beautiful carpet. Vast tangles of wild
roses run along the roadsides and
clamber up the hills, while ferns and
ivy are on every hand, and rhododen
heirs forever. Like its fellows, it has
fallen into the possession of the
Chinese, and in the windows where Dr.
Toland's lace t urtains once hung
gracefully, the habiliments of the
graceless yellow man swing freely.
The old building, which stands di
rectly opposite the Postofnce on Bat
tery and Washington streets, was once
tor a short time practically the capitol
building of the State. When it was
Brat rected it had a large glass dome
on top. and was used as a Merchants'
ESxchange. In 18eo-61 the Sacramento
River Hooded,' and the legislators
sought a council chamber in this city.
The glass dome has been removed, and
nothing is the same excepting the side
walk in front of the building, which
was laid in the year 1854 by Colonel
Russ of N^w York simpiy as an ex
periment, and the experiment has
worn out i. early every walk that has
been laid since. It is stated in con
nection with this same sidewalk that
the patter of the footsteps of the plain,
ordinary, working citizens so disturbed
the legislators sitting within that the
bark of trees had to be laid all along
in front of the building to break the
sound.
Commercial street was a thorough
fare of considerable importance in the
early days when the water came up a
short way above Leidesdorff street,
and the 1200-foot wharf reached out to
the river and Panama steamers. On
the corner of Leidesdorff and Commer
cial streets â the northwest comer â
there stands the building formerly oc
cupied by the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company as its first home. At present
it shows a shrinking roof and a sway
ing veranda sign, where the ghosts of
knives and razors are flying franti
cally in the air, and a cafe.
On the south side of Commercial
street, just below Leidesdorff, a queer
looking building, now occupied as a
drons abound in jungles among the
pines and mountain oaks.
In addition to those transplantings,
which have been made on a scale that
is almost incredible, there are thou
sands of other plants that only a pro
fessional botanist would know the
names of. It is said that there is not
a specimen of -.ora in the world that
is not represented at Biltmore, either
on the estate or in the greenhouses.
And, by the way, these greenhouses
themselves are as fine as any in this
country. Mr. Vanderbilfs collection
of palms is probably the finest in the
world. He has one palm for which he
paid the sum of $20,000. The rest of
his collection shows the same spirit of
liberality, or, rather, disregard of cost.
One peculiarity of the Blue Ridge
Mountains is that there are no lakes
in them. George Vanderbilt recog
nized the error of nature in construct
ing a mountain range without lakes,
and he has remedied it to the extent
that he has built two magnificent arti
ficial lakes near Biltmore House. For
many miles he owns both sides of the
French Broad River, which flows
through his estate, and it is said quite
seriously in Abbeville that it is Mr.
Vanderbilt'a purpose to dam up this
stream and thereby make an immense
inland sea among the peaks of the
Blue Ridge, which shall be so great
that his brothers, Cornelius and Willie
K. and Fred, can float their magnifi
cent ocean yachts on its waters. N'nw
that Mr. Vanderbilt has gone away to
India, however, the people of Western
North Carolina are not so certain that
he will carry this enterprise to suc
cessful completion.
Winding through the valleys and
over Ihe mountains of Bi!tmorÂ« are
the finest macadamized roads to be
found in this country. They were laid
out by Frederick Law Olmstead, the
landscape architect of Central Park,
and they traverse the finest park in
the United States. It was Mr. Van
derbilt's intention to build fifty miles
of these roads. He has already built
thirty miles and the work is still go
ing on.
The religious temperament of George
Vanderbilt is illustrated by the erec
tion of a church at Biltmore station
on the Southern Railroad and on his
own property. Here are a rectory and
the offices of his estate.
Another interesting characteristic of
this many-sided young man is shown in
the elaborate preparations that he has
made for all kinds of farming. He has
a chicken farm, a dairy farm, a truck
farm, a nursery farm, and just the
plain, old. common farm on his estate.
Some idea of the way in which the
young millionaire farms may be gained
from the fact that he has accepted
plans for a $100,000 chicken-house. Re
cently, at a fair at Raleigh, N. C,
George took nearly all the prizes for
cattle and vegetables and he felt very
proud of the result. He raises the best
tomatoes, asparagus, celery, radishes
paper warehouse, was in the early fifties
a Chinese bazaar. It was kept by the
man who in later yeas became noto
rious as the wrecker of the Pioneer
Bank, and who also helped to build the
safe deposit vaults now in the building
at California and Montgomery streets.
Mr. Duncan had a periodical lottery of
Chinese goods, and as his was the
first enterprise of its kind here he mad.c
a fortune from it.
Further down Commercial street, on
the opposite side and near Battery, a
granite front building, sadly neglected
and filled to overflowing with the Chi
nese, is all that remains of Hendrick
son's Raliroad House, which in its time
was the finest restaurant San Fran
cisco knew. After the earthquake of
1858 the upper story had to be rebuilt,
but the lower story remains, apparent
ly as it was in the beginning. The
place was celebrated in its early days
for the paintings that covered its walls.
They were executed by two of Califor
nia's earliest and most famous artists,
Charles and Arthur Nahl. The most
ecstatic imagination could not conjure
up a picture on those same walls to
day. In fact, a ray of light does not
appear to have reached them for many
a year, and the spiders that live on
foul air weave their webs unmolested.
There were exciting times in the city
at the time of the receipt of the new 3
of the assassination of President Lin
coln. A mob attacked some of the
newpapers. L'Echo de Pacifiqre, the
News Letter, the Monitor and the Oc
cidental, edited by Zach Montgomery,
all received due attention, and then
the mob betook itself to the building
wherein was published the Democrat
ic Press, by Beriah Brown. The old
red brick building still stands at 553
Washington street, and just at this
time it is extensively decorated with
dead turkeys; but out of those uppers,
where the heads of Chinamen and the
and cucumbers to be found in Bun
combe County, and he sells them at a
price that represents about one-fifth
the cost of raising them. For instance:
Fresh cucumbers grown at Biltmore
are now sailing in Asheville at $1 a
dozen. They probably cost him $5 a
dozen to grow them.
Forestry has always been a fad with
George Vanderbilt. He has traveled all
over the world hunting for odd trees
to be planted at Biltmore. He estab
lished a school of forestry on his mag
nificent estate, and paid young men
from $40 to $60 a month, with board
and lodging free, to come here and
study.
George also went into the sawmill
business. When he was building Bilt
more House and making other im-
provements, such as the erection of
countless small structures for the use
of the workmen employed by him,
some TOO in number, he bought umber
from the local sawmill. It is said that
the sawmill people, having observed
that the whole of Western North Caro
lina was trying to pail the Vanderbilt
leg, took a clutch at it themselves.
Strange as it may seem in view of the
prices he paid far other things, George
thought that these lumber people were
trying to gouge him. Thereupon he
bought the whole sawmill outfit, float
ed his own logs down his own river
and went in for making everything
necessary for the wooden part of a
house. He also made all his own tiles
and brick, except those that were used
in the swimming pool, which were
porcelain coated and imported from
Leeds, Eng.
The same lavish expenditure . was
shown in his stables, which are al
most palaces and which were filled
with the finest thoroughbreds that
could be bought in Kentucky and Ten
nessee. George took special pride in
naming his horses himself, and here
occurred probably the oddest circum
stance in equine nomenclature. He
called on of his horses Hall Came and
named all the rest of them after the
title or the characters of Caine's nov
els. George's literary bent made itself
manifest even in his stable.
The dairy farm was equipped on the
same generous plan. He bought one
herd of Jersey cattle that cost him
$â¢30,000. He considered $4000 for a single
bull as nothing. George sells milk and
butter in the Asheviile market, but if
the Asheville people were to pay any
thing like what the product costs him
they would not have butter and milk
oftener than once a year.
George also took a lively interest in
the colored' people of Buncombe
County. He built them a place of
worship in Asheville of his own de
nomination, the Protestant Episcopal
church, and erected an institution for
young men of that race. Incidentally
he raised the rate of wages, which was
not as agreeable to the people of West
ern North Carolina as some other
lengths of pipes are plainly visibfe, the
mob threw all of Beriah Brown's typo
into the street and generally demol
ished things. When the mob left the
wreck of Beriah Brown's property it
betook itself to the home of the Placer
Times-Herald, on Sacramento street,
near Montgomery. Here, however, it
was met by the militia under McComb
and the police, headed by Martin J.
Burke, and was checked.
The tall, light building, which looks
solemnly down on the narrow street,
plainly betraying its own importance,
was the abode of the Alta-California,
while the Placer Times-Herald was no
more. Now an ordinary sign of "Pic
tures" is painted on the upper walls,
and below nothing more unusual or ex
citing is to be found than a very ordi
nary appearing saloon.
Speaking of saloons, on Washington
street there Ls the queerest little blue
building, with equally queer signs. It
began its long existence as the "Auc
tion Lunch." and was kept by Flood
& O'Brien long before the California
mining excitement made them 'bonan
za kings."
On the north side of Montgomery,
near Washington street, there is a
building where bread is now sold at
the rate of three loaves for 5 cents,
but la that same building it cost the
citizens of this same city 50 cents for
a shaveâ and the same price for a
shampoo; $1 was the price of a hair
cut, and likewise a bath; and 25 cent*
was the minimum for a bootblack.
The building still standing, and nun
berlng 320 Kearny street, was the orce
famous Eureka Minstrel Hall where, in
the days gone by, Billy Birch, Cha'iie

things that he did.
Adjoining Biltmore was a mountain
known locally as Busbee. George did
not care for Busbee. It wasn't nearly
as high as Pisgah, and there was noth
ing about it that was in any way dis
tinctive frOm the mountains that he
already owned. One day, however, he
learned that on. the top of Busbee was
a spring of very fine water, such as
may be found not infrequently in these
mountains. But this particular sjninp:
was so clear and so limpid and so
sweet that George coveted its waters.
He wanted the spring, and so he
bought the mountain.
He constructed a reservoir, pur up
the most elaborate pumping machin
ery and laid five miles of pipe, reach-
Ing from Mount Busbee to Biltmore
House. What the cost was may be
better imagined than told. He had al
ready everything that he could think
of, ard now he was going to have
Mount Busbee water in Biltmore
House. He did have it for a while, and
then he didn't, and that fact furnishes
the immediate cause for his, going to
India.
Last summer young Vanderbilt went
to Europe and took with him 1: Â° cousin
McXamee, who is the attorne> and
general manager of the Biltmore es
tate. While they were away part
of the foundation of Biltmore
House sank until the walls sagged, ami
the fine marbles used in decorating
were cracked. The man left in charue
of Biltmore House bacame alarmed
and sent to New York for the contrac
tor who erected the house to come on
and see what was the matter. The lat
ter responded post haste and made \' :
some remedial improvement. But it is;
still a question as to whether it will be : . .
temporary or permanent.
About two months ago Mr. Hamilton: .;:-
McKay Twombly, the most astute r-.f ;;
Vanderbilt brothers-in-law, took a niii . , .
down to Biltmore and carefully look
over the place, taking an inventory i
(_â¢%â¢â ! ything. .. '_
Now Mr. Twombly isn't a bit theor
etical. He is always practical and he
has no use for anything that doesn't ;_{
pay its way. Mr. Twombly has tried
fancy farming himself, but it didn't
pay, and Mr. Twombly very promptly. .
sold out and quit the game.
When he had examined the condition
at Biltmore and had seen that the ex
periment did not pay and never would
pay, he advised George Vanderbilt to i
give it up. George didn't like the adÂ» â¢-â¢..,
vice. He had made a paradise of a
desert and he wished to enjoy it. He ...-.
didn't care for the money that it cost
him. He was rich and could stand it... .
But as he was consoling himself with- . /'â ;.
the fact that he had what he wished- ": '.-.
for, even if it did cost him more than : .
other men, he called for a servant to
bring him a glass of water â water from .
the Busbee spring. The servant went,
but returned with an empty glass.
The master of Biltmore demanded to â . '~i
know why his order had not been obey-^ V "
cd. The servant replied that something 'â ;â /.
had happened to the water pipes or to
the machinery, and that no water could â 
be had. 'â .-. ':; â /.
Then George Vanderbilt stopped. The/ \
sunken foundation, the crackedv : .
marbles, the idle saw mill, the unprov. -;;
ductive dairy farm, the expensive f..r-i, : ,
estry school, the unprofitable , truck- W'
farm, and all the failures that his' â :
brother-in-law, Twombly, had point- d; ;
out came rushing in on him. He could
have stood all these, but he could n-op : :.
stand the climax. He had spent tert...;
millk-n dollars on Biltmore, and he .:f.
could not get a drink of water! : i
Can we wonder that he decided to go; 7

INGENIOUS TRICKS OF SHOPLIFTERS.
THERE is one variety of crime
â which . most certainly does not
nourish here. The professional
shop lifters, the bane of all re
tail stores in other large cities, are
almost unknown in San Francisco.
They are evidently not indigenous to
our climate, and the few representa
tives of this especial department of
nefarious industry who have visited
us have done so at rare intervals and
for brief seasons.
Our merchants do occasionally suffer
from the small depredations of dis
bonest persons, but almost all the
cases of shop lifting which occur in
our stoics arc the bungling work of
suddenly tempted persons who, trust
ing to the apparent preoccupation of
those around them, yield to an irre
sistible impulse to appropriate some
trifle which lies conveniently near and
is seemingly unprotected.
An instance of this kind of extem
poraneous thieving occurred in one of
our large Market-street Stores a day
or two since, when a jroung man of
previously excellent reputation, well
dressed and decorated with a genuine
diamond ring and cravat pin. with
over $15 in his pocket, and holding a
position paying him $100 a month, was
seen to deliberately steal a package of
lady's Eace powder and conceal it in
his overcoat pocket.
He had not been drinking and he
appeared to be perfectly sane, and his
only remark when he was forced to
acknowledge his guilt was that he
"didn't know why he took the thing,
but he did."
To this class, too. belong the here
tofore respectable and upright women
who suddenly horrify their friends and
disgrace their families by being
caught in the act of taking articles
which do not belong to them. There
is generally some small shadow of ex
cuse in the charitable mind for these 1
offenders, since the petty crime â petty
in all save its consequencesâ is usu
ally the result of S starvod life.
A woman who. has little money to
BfH nd. and perhaps many to spend
tli;<t little for. may have a longinc for
luxurious trifles of silk and lace and
ribbon which amounts almost to n
mania. To such a person the tempta
tion of tables and Counters nnd b.is
kets. full to overflowing of the things
rÂ»f which circumstances sternly de
prive her. is actually cruel, and the
wonder is not that fin occasional eirl
or woman takes advantage of what
seems to her an opportunity to s- -
cure some of the thing* which shr> so
hunerrily covets, but that so many
resist the temptation and preserve
their integrity in such surroundings.
Unhappily, the first theft if unde
tected emboldens the offender to make
further raids on the property of others.
Having eluded observation one., thf
feat seems easy and the results desira
ble, and the next pilfering is th^ out
come of plan and not of impulse. "Wo
men of this description are unpleasing

and their employes no little trouble, the
actual arrests made bearing but small
proportion to the number of cases

TWO men on the Eastern sea
h..;:nl haw planned to cross the
Atlantic Ocean In a novel man
ner â one will sail in a new four-
teen-foot boat and the other will
walk. Captain William C. Old
rieve of Boston has planned to
walk across the ocean next July.
He will begin his journey July
4, and be accompanied by Captain
William A. Andrews, famous by reason
of his voyages aenrss the Atlantic in a
small boat. It is nothing new for Cap
tain Oldrieve to promenade the waves.
That has been his pleasure and profit
these ten years. The seagoing shoes
of Mr. nidrieve are the most wonderful
part of the whole affair. At first
thought they seem as fabulous as the
si\ leagu< boots <>f fairy lore. Yet they
ait- simple enough u-ljen understood.
They are really a pair of cedar boxes
live t et long;, with tins on the bottom
and Bides. They are very light and
capable of sustaining 140 pounds, but
as i Hdrieve weighs only 130 they are
as good to him as a steamer's deck.
Into each of these wooden shoes the
water-walker's feet are thrust down
deep and a rubber garter-like affair is
fastened to his iÂ«-er. thus effectually
keepine out the water. Rubber boots
reaching to the thigh are also worn.
When thus equipped OMriere is able
to walk many miles and to trawl over
choppy seas, and even the heavy swell

I have perfect confidence of being
able tc walk a great part of the dis
tance across the Atlantic. I shall keep
an exaci record of the miles walked
each day. Qf course. I shall sleep and
take my meals <m board with Captain
AiMivws. But I shall stick to the
water-walking feat during most of my
waking hours. You see I want to make
a worlds record that shall never be
beaten. I am young and strong and in
the V 1V 1 -ry best of condition, and now is
the time for me to attempt this great
tiling, if I ever do. I have had it in
mind for years. "

and when it is lined and a slit is made

It is a sad commentary on warped
human nature to know that the harm
less and necessary baby is quite often
used to help defraud >^ur stores. The.
long cloak and skirts of an innocent
infant have been found to contain de
posits of ribbons, laces, gloves and
jewelry, placed there under a clerk's
very eyes during the processes of tuck
ing arid cuddling which are supposed
to be necessary to the well being of the
babe in arms.
There is one woman who went shop
ping during the last Christmastide ac
companied by a little child about 6
yean of mge. This child while her
mother was busy pricing articles in dif
ferent establishments made herself
eqaally busy in picking up whatever
( :inic .ronvi-inVntly to hand and placing
it for safekeeping und^r her coat. She
wsa caught doing this several times
and the property which she supposedly
t'M.k in infantile innocence of heart
w.is tnken away from her. But in each
OiMM it was found that she had boon
attracted not to toys but by things of
real value, and it was quite evident by
the bearing of ht?r companion that the
poor little thins -was actually "acting
under instructions" in the matter.
One young woman from the country
recently made the rounds of some of
th<> stores with a large telescope bas
ket, which she tilled to the brim with
stolen treasures before she was stopped
in her career. She also wore a golf
cape, and between the outside and the
lining she had a $10 ostrich feather boa.
besides a few other articles for luxur
ious feminine adornment.
The culprit last arrested wore a large
wide-mouthed canvas bap in place of
a bustle, but as she wore it on the out
side of her dress under her concealing
cape (the golf cape a^ain) and there
was a bottle of cologne and a number
of yards of ribbon in it. which she had
not pone through the formality of pay
ing for. the eccentricity seemed scarce
ly uardonable. She tried to explain
through Lawrence Rapids, on the Mer
rimae. In December, 1891. he walked
to Minot's Light from Boston, and
then started to walk back, a distance
of twenty miles, but a thk k fog having
set in- he lost his way and drifted in
Massachusetts Bay for twenty-seven
hours. He was picked up in an ex
hausted condition by the I'nited States
revenue cutter Hamlin.
In June. 1S!Â»2. he walked across the
Niagara River, three miles above the
falls. On one of the coldest days of
the winter in January, 1896. he again
walked from Boston' down the harbor
to Boston Light. Amid floating ice he
performed his nine-mile walk with
comparative ease.
Captain Oldrieve had the idea of
walking across the ocean forced upon
him. A few yean ago he gave an â¢x
hlbltlon of his water walking off Pablo
Beach, Fla. A squall came up and he
w.is driven out t<Â» sea.
A surf boat was manned and the crew
put out to his rescue, but the surf was
so high that the boat was capstsed.
The magic shoes of Captain oldriew
served bin to great purpose then. To
thus.' anxiously watching him from the
shore he Beemed to sup from the top
'â¢:' one \ aye to another, as if leaping
from one rock to another. In this bop,
skip and jump manner he came ashore
as deftly as if the whole performance
were a stage scene set for the occasion.
It was this successful experience that
first gave him the idea that he could
walk across the ocean.
His theory of midocean walking is to
slide down the side of a big swell and
wait for the next one to lift him up.
In this way. he says, it really requires
less exertion to walk on water far out
at sea than it does in a sheltered bay.
The hardest work of all. he says, is
to go in choppy water, as he did in the
Baal River. He thinks he will be able
to walk from 500 to 1000 miles of the
way across the Atlantic in a period of
forty to ninety days. As the course
taken will be in the path of steam
ships, he expects to speak many pass
ing vessels and send back letters writ
ten while walking in midocean to his
friends in Boston.
Captain William A. Andrews, who is
going to accompany Oldrieve in a
small boat, is a hardy, wiry man of 54.
He is about six feet in height and
weighs 180 pounds. He is inured to
hardship, and his greatest pleasure is
in doing something adventurous and
out of the ordinary. After having ac
complished his proposed trip he in
tends to exhibit the boat in which he
crosses the Atlantic at the Paris Ex
matters by asserting that although
she was dressed in her best she had
been engaged in washing, and taking
a fancy to go down town after she
had put her clothes out had inadvert
ently taken her clothespin bag. which
she always wore in that peculiar place,
"for convenience," along with her. And
as for the cologne and the ribbon she
was sure she "didn't know at all how
they came there, unless by magic."
But these women with a mania for
"unconsciously picking up things" in
stores are always ready with simple
excuses for their extraordinary con
duct.
LUCKY GUESS OF A LOVER.
With a gesture tÂ»prcâ lve of firm
resolution, as if the affair were quite
settled, the Countess Madeline pointed
to her lacquered Japanese cabinet that
shimmered in the lamplight and said,
very gravely:
"Open one of those three drawers,
Valentine, and be sure that you choose
the right one. Each drawer contains
an answer to the prayer which you
have addressed to me for the past six
months. If you open that which con
tains the Bjumrer 'Yes,' I will be yours
and will marry you as soon as you
please. But take care that you do not
get the wrong answer, for if you do
you will never see me again."
"Alas!" said Valentine, "there are
two chances to one against me. How
cruel you are, my darling!"
"Well." said the Countess, "if I
nnrry you I can at least lay the blame
on Fate."
The young man hesitated a long
time. His hand wandered from draw
er to drawer, not venturing to touch
any, and his heart sank with the fear
of choosing wrongly. At last he shut
his eyes and opened a drawer at
hazard.
oh. rapture! the little piece of pink
paper, when unfolded, disclosed to his
glad eyes the exquisite word "Yes." In
ecstasy he clasped the blushing Made
line in his arms and covered her face
with kisses. She could not deny him
now without a disgraceful violation of
her promise. But Madeline was an up
right person who always kept her
word, and so he was soon able to call
"her his wife.
Still, even amid the raptures of the
honeymoon, Valentine was not entirely
happy. At times a gloomy expression
appeared on his brow and in his eyes.
"Ungrateful man!" sighed Madeline,
"you are not yet satisfied. What is
the matter?"
"I am troubled about something."
"About what?"
"I owe my wife to chance, not to her
own inclination."
He remained pensive for a time,
while she looked smilingly at him.
Suddenly she broke into a merry
laugh.
"Stupid man!" she cried. "Don't you
see that I put the same answer in all
three drawers?"

"Every man has his specialty these
days," said Captain Andrews at his
pretty home in Cambridge, Mass., the
other day, "and my specialty is in
crossing the ocean in small boats. .
"I shall get across all ri^ht this time,

LITTLE BYRON GILBERT,
WHO HAS BEEN ADMIT
TED TO THE BAR.
BYRON GILBERT,
A Seven-Ytar-Old Boy Who Has Successfully Passed an Examination Before the
Kansas Supreme Court.
THE youngest lawyer in thp world .is Byron Howse Gilbert of Atchison,
Kan. At the tender age of T he has successfully passed a rigid examina
tion before the Supreme Court Justices, and is the proud possessor of ;r
certificate of admission to the bar, to take effect when he shall reach his ma
jority. The precious document, to which is attached an immense golden Seal,
is guarded with the most jealous care by the infantile barrister.
Little Byron is a son of Judge W. D. Gilbert, who astonished the learned
jurors the other day by leading the boy before the Judges of the Supreme
Court and requesting that he be examined for admission. They all took thÂ«
proposition as a joke, but Chief Justice Doster fired a simple question at him,
and he answered it so promptly and with such a confident air that the Justices
v ere startled.
By degrees more profound legal subjects were led up to. For about an
hour the boy withstood a cross -fire of the most technical and perplexing ques
tions from all three Supreme Judges. His ready and correct answers caused
the greatest surprise. Time after time did the Justices endeavor to trap the
boy lawyer, but every such effort was futile. Not only did the questions em
brace fundamental law, as treated by Blackstone and Coolly and as made by
the general trend of decisions, but they also covered the technique of the law
practice.
The boy was asked how he would handle different classes of cases, being
p.iven statements of facts. Either by intuition or actual knowledge he seemed
to readily or clearly grasp the case, and his idea regarding the proper mode
>.f procedure was in every instance concurred in, not only by the Judges but
by the lawyers present. His judgment, as well as his knowledge of law,
seemed infallible. By a unanimous court the boy lawyer was granted a certifi
cate of admission to the bar, which was duly drawn up by the clerk of the
court.

BOOKS OF THE YEAR
and their Authors
<TV/Â£S7rÂ£\ fÂ£ i Â° cast a retrospec

i^mm * nÂ£{ work that has been
I m^?\ done in literary fields
vtU as t</ during the past
Â«kÂ« Wi /^\ twelve months is to
Â£yk\ Â»jj (Q) court disappoint
Â§>& ~J**l *Â£^ ment and a feeling
fS Sal roi akin to gloom at the
f%j2 Â»,/ ' \jj/ paucity of what re-
AÂ« g| AÂ£z ally constitutes lit-
I^sl In \^t erature that has
yt/ tÂ£jli Â«^ found its way into
x~\ tÂ£a Cf\ print. We shall not
lil/' . yy*y be accused either of
undue pessimism or
ivviy^** \fir exaggeration when
we make the state
ment that the good books of the year
may be counted on the fingers of
two hands. Those that will live, that
will be accorded a permanent place in
bookdom, may be counted on the fin
gers of one; but they are the best â
entitled to rank as masterpieces; and
they will afford valuable material for
the writers and readers of future gen
erations. Nevertheless, with sorrow do
we say it, they resemble the righteous
in the biblical cityâ their number is
swallowed In the preponderating and
heterogeneous mass of that which is
trivial and worthless, in the "mixed
multitude" element of literature.
Admitting the truth of the postulate
that the reader of to-day desires of all
things to be amused, that he has little
leisure or inclination for aught else
than fiction, we shall first notice this
branch of the writer's craft. The out
put of good fiction for the year has
been small, and we are inclined to
award the palm in this class to Mr.
James Lane Allen's "The Choir Invisi
ble." This is a striking and powerful
story, the framework of which had
previously been exposed In a short
sketch by the same author entitled
"John Gray." Like Thoreau and Stev
enson and Blackmore. Mr. Allen has
done a great work in bringing us closer
to nature. His "Kentucky Cardinal"
was styled a perfect calendar of Na
ture's year, and the characterization is
true to an even greater extent of the
later book, which is as fully a story of
nature as of life. Mr. Allen's Gama
liel at whose feet he has sat with profit
to himself and delight to his readers is
unquestionably Mr. Thomas Hardy,
from whose pen we have had a notable
book this year. "The Well Beloved" Is a
gloomy story of a disillusionized seeker
after an ideal, but it is relieved by the
charming descriptions of scenery and
reflections on life and character which
place his writings above most of the
fiction of the day.
â .- > - -
The untimely death of George dv
Maurier lends a pathetic interest to
"The Martian," which appeared in
bound form, after running as a serial.
It has been claimed that the principle
"De Mortuis" should not apply to the
work of authors, and that literary me
rit should be judged apart from any
personal consideration. We find it im
possible to apply the principle in the
case of the creator of "Trilby." Let
the reader consider the position of this
able delineator of English draw
ing-room life whose energies were
bent toward success In one branch
of art and who suddenly ac
quired fame in another. His "Peter
Ibbetson" was received with coldness;
many had never heard of it. Then
with startling unanimity all the world
enthusiastically threw up its hat. And
over what? The story of a grisette
in the Quartier Latin! But. for a lit
erary dessert, it was a most delecta
ble dish, and assuredly a pronounced
success; was it therefore too much to
anticipate a strengthening of the popu
lar author's style in his later work?
Was it not reasonable to expect some
thing better than we received in "The
Martian"? For, apart from some ex
cellent pictures of schoolboy life in
France, the book can only be called
mediocre, and inferior to the tardily
recognized "Peter Ibbetson." It will
be readily understood that the canons
of good taste forbid further comment
on so painful a matter.
Kipling's "Captains Courageous" and
Stevenson's "St. Ives" have also made
their second bow to the public after a
debut In the magazines. The first
might be classed as a juvenile, a lfght.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JAXFARY 2, 1898.
airy and ephemeral composition, mainly
remarkable for clever word-painting in
pastel of the Orand Ranks fishermen.
It may safely be prophesied that Mas
ter Harvey Cheyne will not divide lau
rels with Private Terence Mulvaney.
Robert Louis Stevenson's "St. Ives"
suggests the author's farewell to his
loving public; it reads as if by some
strange, clairvoyant instinct, he knew
that this was to be his last story, and*
knowing this, had put as much as pos
sible of his own strongly marked per
sonality into the character of the hero.
T'pon A. T. Quiller-rouch was bestowed
the task of completing the book whose
writing was interrupted by the death
of Stevenson. The highest praise that
can be accorded "Q's" work is sum
med up in the assertion that it is well
nigh impossible to discern where the
work of the pupil dovetails into that of
the preceptor.
The year that has just closed has
marked the advent of but one or two
authors of promise. "Benjamin Swift 1
has come forward with his "Nancy
Noon," published first, we believe, in
England. This young writer has dem
onstrated the possibility of the Scotch
story, with the ripe, rich and mellow
kailyard flavor, but minus the dialect.
The shrewd philosophy and originality
of his progenitors is all there, and he
<an be assured of the support of a
large audience in his very apparent at
tempt to deal a vital blow at certain
much praised and little understood il
lustrators of the "hoot mon" theory.
There has also arisen in England a ri
val of Mr. W. Clarke Russell, in the
person of W. W. Jacobs. Whether this
gentleman, who is a clerk in the Lon
don pustofflce. has ever been to sea is
not known, but he is thoroughly ac
quainted with the ways of the modern
mariner 'from the deck up." and uses
his knowledge ably in "Many Car
goes."
With a passing reference to Ibsen's
"John Gabriel Borkman." a bitter
study in pessimism; to Anthony Hope"s
"Phroso," a good "shilling shocker."
and to Mr. Richard Harding Davis"
"Soldiers of Fortune," a nondescript
production which we decline to class
ify, we arrive at that subdivision of
story telling called by the Germans
"Tendenz-Fietion." the novel with a
purpose, the story with a moral. Writ
ers of this kind of literature have bt-t-n
busy the past twelve months. Early
in the year came Olive Schreiner with
her "Trooper Peter Halkett of Mash
onaland." Then our charming compat
riot, Mrs. Gertrude Atherton, with a
heroine rejoicing in the romantic j>ai -
mnymic. "Patience Sparhawk." Ed
ward Bellamy's "Equality" arrived
third, and Mrs. Sarah Grand a close
fourth with "The Beth Book. " The
reader was scarcely aroused from a
mournful contemplation of this array
of talent when lo! Hall Came appeared
on the scene packing his "Christian."
and the greatest of all these is "The
Christian."
Had Mr. Hall Came foreseen the
storm that would gather about his ears
as the result of the publication of his
book he might have hesitated in his
urgent instructions to his publishers.
He might have foreborne to inform the
newspaper men in London that 'Arry
had read the proofs of his 'Ampstead
'eath scene: that the Duke of Nocash
had performed a like service for him
in the matter of horse racing and note
brokers; that Dr. Sawbones had care
fully revised his admirable descrip
tions of the doings of hospital nurses
and internes, and that the eminent
danseuse. Miss Lottie Highkick, had
provided him with the latest wrinkles
in the matter of stage undress. But
no' With a flare and a blare of trum
pets "The Christian" was launch -d.
How was It received? In a in:::ir. ;
that befitted the trash of which
the book is composed. The L
Tirres contemptuously dismissed thti
work with live lines, sandwiched in be
twten foreign markets and horn?? rail*.
Other competent critics were equally
merc:le-*s, and one, also in a London
review, scathingly ref.-rrel to Hall
Came "the arch he prostitute of the
English language." This treatment
was deserved, for the work ie one of the
most astigmatic pictures of life that
we have ever pursued. Its characters
gather what little strength they pos
sess from the same source whence the
s-V.\ r-r rat derives its Vtcu>O9nÂ«Â«s, and
its herr is polluted by the foul touch of
Mr. i. dine's hand. From th? name of
the book which appears on the titl 3
page to the quotation from the Episco
pal marriage service which precedes
the word 'Finis." 'The Christian" is
a fraud and a sham, destined to ob
literate what fame the author had ac
quired in his previously issued works.
The impartial reader can satisfy him
self of the truth of our observations
by instituting a comparison between
the respective styles of Mr. Hall Came
and Mrs. Humphrey Ward, each of
whom endeavors to preach a sermon.
In the one is noticeable the striving for
effect, the appeal to the gallery, the
cheap manner melodramatic; in the
other a real lesson is imparted and
driven home with all the force that a
gentle character can lend to it. Pop
ular "The Christian" may be, but the
popularity will toe short lived because
it is gained by pandering to diseased
literary tastes.
Comes now Mrs. Gertrude Atherton
with "Patience Sparhawk and Her
Times," which, to quote from a letter
addressed by the lady to the writer of
these notes, purports to be "the truest
American novel that has ever ap
peared." But is it? What has Mrs.
Atherton attempted to show? That
New York society is slowly becoming a
replica of European high life? That
vapid inanities form the bulk of the
conversation of New York society
women? Granted that this is so, can
it be offered as sufficient excuse for a
500-page novel? We took occasion, on
the appearance of this book, to seri
ously condemn Mrs. Atherton for
having forsaAcen her legitimate birth
right, the field of California romantic
literature, for the mess of pottage of
fered by the devotees of the erotic
novel and of sensational journalism.
Then came a letter to The Call from
the lady herself, admitting that the
review was a fair one, but attempting
justification on the plea. "What is the
use of writing stories that no one will
read?" and asserting that Californians
themselves were indifferent to the work
of their native writers. We endeavored
to show that this was not the case, and
in reply gave it as our conviction that
until Mrs. Atherton returns to the
niche she formerly adorned she will
produce nothing wrrthy of note in a
literary way; and by this statement we
must abide.
The case of Mrs. Sarah Grand ex
hibits many points of similarity to that
of Gertrude Atherton. Mrs. Grand
labors under the misapprehension that
she has been placed upon this earth as
a crusader and that her mission :s to
reform all existing abuses, real or
imagined. She. too, adopts long-winded
methods of pleading her cause, and
her latest production, "The Beth
Book,' shows that much talent has
been wasted upon wheat that has been
thrashed and rethrashed. It would be
v. ell were the author of "The Heavenly
Twins" to quit didactics and devote
more attention to the study of child
life, in which direction she has proved
her ability.
The revival of interest in the origin
of American nationality has led to the
publication of a number >.f novels
based upon the study of the earlier
periods of our history. Some have lit
erary importance, while others that are
useful and meritorious have very slight
value as fiction. Dr. S. Weir Mitchells
"Hugh Wynne. Free Quaker," is, per
haps the most important book of this
kind that has so far appeared, and ob
jections to it have mainly been ad
vanced on the score of Its length. Much
good work may be looked for in future
from Dr. Mitchell.
In England, the star historical novel
has been "On the Face of the Waters."
by Mrs. Flora Annie Steel, who ha 3
performed the remarkable feat of con
veying a clear idea of the forces that
led to the Indian mutiny. Long resi
dence in India, combined with a most
attractive style of storytelling, com
mend Mrs. Steel's work to the reader,
while careful study assures a sub
stratum of truth in her novels. The
rapidly successive calls for extra edi
tions indicate to what extent Mrs.
Steel has enthroned herself in the af
fections of the public. A second Kip
ling she certainly is not, but no fault
will be found with her on this account.
Small as has been the output of good
fiction during the year, the voluml of
poetry has been even smaller. The
most notable contribution in the way
of verse has unquestionably been Rud
yard Kipling's Recessional." At once
an invocation and â¢ warning, its ma
jestic rhythm has met with apprecia
tion the world over. In the height of
the celebration of the sixtieth anni
versary of the Queen's reign, an event
unparalleled in the annals of history,
Kipling appears to have been moved by
the same spirit which animated Job
when he offered sacrifices after each of
the festivals of his sons, saying, "It
may be that my bom have sinned "
It was a lofty thought which actuated
Mr. Kipling, the real laureate of Eng
land, to pen the verse:
If. drunk with sight Of power, we loose
\Mld tongues that have not Thee in
awe â Â»
Such boastlnp? v tht> Gentiles use
Or lesser breeds wl hout the Law-
Lord God of Ili.sts. !,Â« W jth us yet
Lest we forgetâ tost we forget.
Solemn words, these, and pregnant
with meaning to a nation inclined to
put her trust "in reÂ« king tube and iron
shard." And it is singular that these
noble verses should have called forth
a response from another poet whose
"Year of Shame" was equally an ap
peal and a burnin? denunciation of
Britain's policy in the East, William
Watson saw fit to take up the chaU
lenge and incidentally to expound his
own peculiar theological doctrines.
"Lest we forget." said Kipling. And
the answer came, quick and sharp,
from the agnostic William Watson:
Best, by remembering God. say some,
We keep our high imperial lot.
Fortune, I fear, hath oftener come
When we forgotâ when we forgot!
A lovelier faith their happier crown.
But history laughs and weeps it down!
In the domain of history we have had
this year the second, third and fourth
volumes of Professor William Mllligan
Sloane's "Life of Napoleon Bonaparte,"
a work that is remarkable principally
for its perfectly impartial treatment of
its great subject. Professor Sloane re
gards the "Man of Destiny" as no ob
ject for hero worship, yet he defends
him from the attacks of prejudiced
writers.
The fourth volume of Justin Mc-
Carthy's "History of Our Own Times,"
bringing that notable work down to the
diamond jubilee. Is another valuable
contribution to history, as is the same
author's "Life of Gladstone," issued
several weeks ago. There have been
those who complained that Mr. McCar
thy permits his prejudices to influence
his writings, but this cannot be said of
the two works named. The well known
member for North Longford possesses
a remarkable faculty for giving in a
few lines a lifelike picture of a person
age, and his sketches of Parnell, Dis
raeli, Cardinal Manning, Tennyson,
Browning and Stevenson are really re
markable studies of these men. The
history of the Victorian era as it is
written by Justin McCarthy is worth
reading even by those who read for
entertainment only and we commend
his fourth volume and the "Life of
Gladstone" to any who desire a clear
exposition of the Irish question in all
its phases.
Works on travel have been few and
far between this year. Two large and
handsome volumes, yen- completely il
lustrated, contain that record of stren
uous endeavor, the journal of Nansen's
trip to the Pole â "Farthest North."
Here again the reader associates the
personality of the author with his work,
and regrets ill-advised action mani
fested in large advertising with its ac-
companiment of sordid statistics. Nan
sen's courage was put to a terrible test
in those three years which he spent in
the frozen regions, and he has received
ample recognition from learned socie
ties the world over on this account.
With these laurels the highest which
can be gained, he should be content.
The native dignity of his race should
prevent him from exploitation by cheap
commercial methods. Dr. Nansen has
fallen a victim to the prevalent craze,
and that in a way which is not to his
credit.
Turn we now to the most important
branch of literature, to that division
which treats of men and is therefore
possessed of the strongest human in
terest, biography. It is to this division
of belles lettre3 that our introductory
remarks most nearly apply, and one
feels almost compensated for disap
pointment in other directions by the
wealth of good matter that has poured
in from the three or four competent bi
"tnuphers whose wort* nas cast a ray
of light, across the path of the ha
rassed book reviewer. In point of or
der there is Captain Mahan's "Life of
Nelson." It seems strange that it
should have been left to an American
t" write a standard history of an alien
commander. Of course there are the
histories of Southey, of Nicholas and of
Russell, to name the three best, but
Captain Mahan is the only biographer
who has done justice to one of the
greatest characters in English naval
annals, his work at the same time be
ing free from the technicalities which
are ever a stumbling block to the lay
reador. Particularly worthy of admira
tion is his treatment of the unfortun
ate episode of Lady HamMton, which
has never received careful attention,
former historians being often blinded
by the prejudice acquired from con
temporary writers. The life of Nelson
as narrated by Captain Mahan will
without question take precedence over
all others, and it is gratifying to note
that this opinion is shared by every
competent crKic on both sides or the
water.
"With a word mentioning "The Let
ters of Benjamin Jowett," "The Mem
ories of Hawthorne.' hy his daughter,
Rose Hawthorne Lathrop; "The Ro
mance of Isabel, Lady Burton," and the
'Private Life of the Queen," all of
which hove received notice In the book
columns of The Call during the past
twelve months, we come to "Margaret
Ogilvy," J. M. Barrle's memoir of his
mother, which merits some comment,
and that of a not altogether flattering
character. Mr. Barrie has fallen into
the pit that opened to receive Forster
when the latter wrMe his "Life of
Charles Dickens." At that time it was
said that the proper title for the book
Fhould have been "The Life of Forster,
With Reminiscences of Charles Dick
ens. ' With equal force might it be
said that Mr. Barries book should have
been called "James M. Barrie as k son;
how he carried shawls and made beds
and scoured plates in his own home,
and went to London and wrote books
about his friends and relatives, and
the strange faces he 'made while writ
ing them; what he thought of things in
general, and himself in particular; with
full details of his daily habits and do
mestic life, and occasional glimpses of
his mother." If Mr. Barrie could have
suppressed the all too prominent ego in
his work, one could have pardoned the
questionable taste of issuing the book
at all.
The literary event of the year has
been the publication of the 'Life of
Tennyson" simultaneously in England
and in this country. We have pre
viously taken occasion to point out the
debt that is due to Hallam, the poets
son, for his uniform good taste and
judgment, for his correct sense of the
fitness of things, and for his regard not
only for effectiveness but for truth and
justice. Hallam Tennyson appears to
have completely recognized the aver
sion which Tennyson had for anything
that might savor of self-advertisement
or self-glorification, and has preferred
to let the life of Tennyson be told from
his letters and other written memoran
da. For this reason there is a certain
dÂ»Bjointedness in the work and some
obscurity in places. This, however, is
excusable when one remembers that
the facts of the book were compiled
from more than forty thousand letters,
a task requiring consummate tact.
The value of the "Memoir of Tenny
son" is enhanced by the fact that very
little authoritative matter was pub
lished regarding the poet during his
lifetime. His retiring habits made him
no mark for the omnipresent inter
viewer, and it was perhaps this charac
teristic which gave rise to the idea that
Tennyson was a dreaming sybarite, an
epicurean, averting his eyes from ,all
that was unpleasant, that failed to meet
with his approval. It was fortunate
that Lady Tennyson lived long enough
to correct the proofs of the memoir,
which was sent to press but a few
months after her death, and the book
will pass to posterity as the true record
of the life of a man whose verse was the
classical expression of the philosophic,
metaphysical and literary bias of his
century.
In bringing to a close this review of
the more important works that have
seen the light during the past twelve
months, we are impelled to a reitera
tion of the statement made in these
columns some weeks ago that the
giants of the pen are dead; that mod
ern literature finds its prototype in the
kodak: that our writers are photog
raphers of little obscure scenes that
few care for; that modern literature
has no heart, that there is no mighty
love in it. It would really appear as if
literature had become feminine; that
it is to-day written by women for
women. As we have pointed out, apart
from one or two notable works of
fit tlon and the same number of impor
tant biographies, there has been noth
ing issued in book form this year that
can really be classed under the head
of literature that will live.
And what we said at the beginning
of last year touching the non-appear
ance of the really great American
novel may be echoed at this writing.
We hold with Professor Harry Thurs
ton Peck that the great American
novel, for whose appearance every de
vout resident of these United States
should pray thrice daily, will not be a
novel constructed on hitherto unheard
of outlines, but one that is an active
delineation of the life that is lived in
this huge colossus of a country. We
appreciate the complicated difficulties
that beset an author who tries to limn
in a large way the life and attributes
of the American people, but we do not
yet despair of discovering the Ameri
can novelist who shall be truly great
who shall deal with no small, isolated
section of the country nor with the
petty acts of its inhabitants, but one
who will be entitled to that place in
the affections of American people that
Thackeray and Scott and Dickens and
Stevenson occupy in the hearts of our
trans-Atlantic cousins.
EMANUEL ELZAS.T is just about a quarter of a cen-
Itury ago, so we learn Ortun Mr.

X RAYS TURNED
ON THE CUPBOARD
THE latest and, perhaps, one of
the most useful applications of
the X ray is the examining of
food preparations for the pur
pose of ascertaining the presence
of adulteration.
;. Experiments having this end in view
:' have recently been made by Miss
| . Fleischman at her laboratory on Sutter
â  street and the results have been satis
: tory in the highest degree.. '.v~
â¢ In the scope of her experiments Miss
Fleischman has covered nearly all the
v manufactured food products on the
market and the- presence of foreign
â¢ substances has in every instance been
"; detected. With the staple articles of

.'; In making these examinations Miss
= Fleisc'hman proceeded :in exactly the
; same manner as in making radiographs

The articles to be examined were plac
ed on top of a sensitive plate and given
a brief exposure to the X raiys. The
plate was then developed and the print
from it "showed all the differentiation

From what is known of the action of
" the X ray there is no reason why this
should be otherwise. Most food pre

MADE MILLIONS IN A DECADE.
Arrived at the diamond fields, young
j Isaacs took the name previously adopt
ed by his brother Harry, and was
henceforth known tn thÂ» world as Bar
j ney Barnato. In tht>s.> young days he
dealt in anything which brought grist
to the mill, from wool, feathers, mealies
| and garden vegetables to diamonds.
! The Dutch farmers soon found they
| had a tough nut to crack in the
i new arrival. Bit by bit they came to
I see it was no good trying to get the
better of him. They began to respect
him instead, and when the day came
that Barney stood for Kimberley in
the Cape Parliament, the memory of
I his clear-headed, honest ways secured
I him the Dutch vote solid and placed
j him at the head of the poll. But it was
' by following the business of a kopje
: wallopper, already adopted by his
i brother Harry, that Barney owed his
introduction to immense wealth. A
kopje wallopper bought diamonds from
the sorting tables of the different
k<pjes (small hills) and turned them to
the best profit he could.
Just about this time Barney fell in
with Louis Cohen, and they com
i menced a brief partnership. Cohen had
j Â£100 as capital, Barnato sixty boxes of
cigars. Walking together near the dia
mond camps one day Barnato spied a
well situated office.
"Well, Lou," he said, "how would
that do for an office for the two of us?"
"It would cost too much," said Co
hen.
"Well, let's inquire what the rent
would be."
Cohen went in and found the place to
be a tiny, unfioored. corrugated iron
â  shanty about 8 feet by 6, and the rent
! a guinea a day.
"It is ridiculous to think we could
1 pay that," he said to Barnato.
"I do not know," replied Barney.
"The situation is good. Why not pay a
guinea a day if you can make thirty
shillings?"
The result was that they took the of
fice and divided it by a partition. Co-
I hen sat in the front box and bought
I and sold diamonds by day. while Bar
! ney went in for the outdoor work. Very
hard work it was, too, carried on un
; der the heat and glare of the South
African sun, to which he was not yet
. acclimatized.
At night they slept on the earthen
. floor at the back of the shop, with
just a blanket to cover them. Some-
I times Cohen must have pulled his
bles in certain spots, where the differ
ent minerals overlap, but it is possible
to detect each and every one with the
aid of a small magnifying glass.
In one of the experiments made by
Miss Fleischman a small heap of
ground coffee, known to be pure, was
placed beside a Bpoonftti of suspicious
coffee. To the eye and taste both of
these specimens were exactly alike.
Even a strong magnifying glass
showed nothing foreign. Both would
have passed anywhere for pure coffee.
But what a difference there was to
be seen in the radiograph. The pure
coffee stood out in clear, perfect grains
and appeared as a moderate gray on

partner's blanket off, for Barnato in
later days said to him:
"Lou, I will forgive you everything
we have ever differed about except
one."
"What is that?" asked Cohen.
â¢ Why, when we slept together in
that hut you used to pull the blankets
off me every now and then, and I
was too much afraid of you to tell you
of it."
During: the thirteen months which
Cohen and Barnato spent together
they had a very rough time of it. prac
ticing every economy andbecomingex
pert cooks. Sometimes the business
looked like collapsing, but defeat was
unknown to the energetic Barney.
He kept his eyes wide open instead.
One man, a diamond dealer in a
comparatively large way, was the
envy and despair of the youthful cou
ple. He drove round the camp with
an aged yellow pony, and had a first
class connection,
â¢We must get the old chap's cus
tomers somehow." said Barnato.
"Easier said than done," rejoined
his friend.
But Barnatos keen eye was fixed
on the man and his seedy-looking ani
mal. He noticed that the pony needed
no driving, arid that it stopped at Cer
tain places of its own accord. By and
by, as the dealer's wealth increased,
the white surface. The suspicious cof
fee was at once shown to be adulter
ated. It was filled with irregular dark
spots of different sizes. Where there
was any good coffee it was plainly in
dicated. Some of the dark spots could
be seen to be bits of grain and the
darkest ones were plainly chicory.
This was proven by making a radio
graph of some chicory on a plate by it
self and comparing the two images.
F..r some reason not easily explained
chicory offers great resistance to the
X rays. Or it may be that the chicory
used was adulterated before being put
into the coffee.
Tea is frequently treated with sul
phate of copper, to give it both weight
and color. But even this form of adul
teration is readily discernible by
means of the X ray. pp U re tea and
coppered tea of the same quality
placed side by side yielded two entirely
different pictures. The pure tea, be
ing simply a leaf of vegetable fiber,
freely permitted the X rays to pass
through, while the film of copper in
the adulterated tea offered strong re
sistance. The result showed only a
faint image of the pure tea and an al
most black image of the coppered tea.
Sugar is most commonly adulterated
with white sand. This is absolutely
Imperceptible to the naked eye. but in
a radiograph each grain shows black
and distinct. This is, perhaps, the
easiest of all the examinations to make
by means of the X ray. Other foreign

that he didn't care to see Irving in
"The Bells" at the Lyceum, having
already seen Barney Barnato at Kim
berley.
Three years after Barnato's arrival
he had amassed about Â£3000 and with
this he bought four claims well situ
ated for working in the Kimberley
mine. By this move he left off merely
dealing in diamonds and started dig
ging on his own account. From theso
claims he obtained the wonderful yield
of two to two and half cp.rats a ton.
Soon after Barney's purchase the yel
low ground, known to be diamondh'er
ous, gave out and revealed an under
stratum of dense blue rock, varying in
hardness, but apparently of great
thickness. The formation apneared to
be volcanic, but on examination no dia
monds seemed to be forthcoming.
There were many troubles incidental to
mining, and the combined circum
stances caused a number of men to sell
their claims for what they could get
or abandon them altogether. Some of
the miners even sarcastically remaiked
that should a few odd diamonds be
found they had been dropped by. them
during hurried sorting.
But Barney Barnato held on and
bought up all the interests he could get
hold of. He somehow anticipated E'ri
fessor Roentgen and his X-rays, and
managed with his eagle eye to see

THE AGE OF ANIMALS.
As far as naturalists have been able
to discover, the elephant lives to the
greatest age of any of the animals with
which we are familiar. It takes twen
ty-five to thirty years, and sometimes
longer, for elephants to complete their
growth. It is recorded that certain
specified animals have lived more than
150 years, but the statistics on sub
jects ot this' sort are necessarily in
complete and therefore unreliable.
The lion is supposed to live forty
years, although it is claimed that one
kept in the Tower of London attained
the age of 70 years. It Is not supposed
that he would have lived to that age
in his natural condition.
The horse is a short-lived animal, but
when carefully kept and allowed to
spend a great deal of its time in pas
ture, it has been known to live past
the age of 40 years. The trouble with
horses is that they are fed for hard
work, consequently their feet and their
digestion wear out. Eighteen to 24
years is a very high average age for
horses to attain.
Cows live eighteen or twenty years,
but they have very little value toward
the latter portion of this period, save in
exceptional cases.
down into the blue rock. "When experts
said "There are no diamonds" Barney
said "There are," and went on buying
and digging. In a very short time his
investment of Â£3000 was bringing in
Â£1800 a week.
In 1881 he launched his first ventureâ
the Bafrnato Diamond Mining Com
panyâwith a capital of Â£115,000. This
was but a step in the amalgamation of
ail the interests in the mine. Barnato
plainly saw what a saving could be ef
fected if all the claims were worked
as one whole, and for this end he
strove with might and main. He gave
the unheard of sum of Â£30,000 a claim
to one man, but the price brought him
not only the claims, but great notorie
ty and public confidence. He was nick
named in the district a "Diamond
King" â a name also shared by Cecil
Rhodes of the De Beers mme â and the
time was drawing near when these two
men, after being at cross purposes
with one another, were <o unite their
forces and control the diamond output
of the world.
In the early days of development,
when uncertainty as to the future of
the Rand existed, Barnato never lost
faith. "Wait, have confidence as I
have," was his advice. So in time of
depression he steadied the pulse of the
disheartened, buoyed up the weak and
held on his way. All his most rosy ex
pectations turned out to be correct,
and the gold output from the Rand rose
million after million as the few short
years passed by.
Barnato's success did not change his
good nature. He was blithe, merry,
good-humored, witty and bright to the
end. Among his peculiarities was that
of seldom carrying money about with
him. Many a time he would turn
around to his friends and say: "Oh,
lend me 5 shillings." "No, Barney, cer
tainly not," one and all would reply.
"Five pounds, with pleasure, if you
like."
His three forms of recreation were
boxing, horse-racing and theatricals.
His great love for acting brought him
into close sympathy with the profes
sion. On one occasion while he was
driving from Johannesburg he fell in
with two traveling companies, each
going in opposite directions. One was
under Lionel Brough's management.
Brough had with him certain props and
scenery which he could not sell at
SEAWEED AS THE
COMING DINNER DISH
'PHERE is a possibility that with
1 in the next year or so we will
have seaweed on our tables as a
regular article of diet. Not as a heavy
food, on which to do a big day's work,
however, but more as a relish as we
now use lettuce and radishes. That
seaweed is capable of being used as an
article of food we have only to go to
the Chinese for proof, for these people
have been eating the stuff for cen
turies.
Californians have always appreciated
the algae from the standpoint of the
beautiful. Most visitors to our coast
carry away an album with pressed sea
weeds. But now it is being regarded
Johannesburg. Barnato offered to put
them up to auction on the open veldt.
It was looked upon as an excellent bit
of fooling, and both companies turned
out to enjoy it. Barnato conducted the
sale in monologue, making the whole
thing more ridiculous by appealing to
the company to let him get a word in
edgeways. Then he immediately
knocked the lots down to himself at a
high figure. To the astonishment of
the gathering 1 , at the end of the sale,
he handed Brough the amount at
which he had bought the things, and
then gave them to the other company.
In 1595 he commenced to build a great
mansion in the most aristocratic thor
oughfare in London. He seems to
have regarded it with superstitious
dread, for passing by one day with a
friend, he remarked: "Yes, there it
is, but I don't think 1 sha'l ever live in
it. " A sadly prophetic utterance,
which in a moment of aberration Bar
nato put beyond all doubt.
It was work that killed the million
aire, not worry as to the future. He
said he had none. But he could not
find time to get through all his work,
and he could not bear to the end to let
one detail slip from his grasp: he must
know all that was going on. His health
broke down under the strain. "Why
don't you give up now, Barney; what
are an extra five millions to you?" a
friend said to him when the first signs
of ill health showed themselves. But
to give up his active life was like be
ing buried alive, besides, as he said,

seriously as a novel dainty for epi
cures. An analysis of the kelp shows
that the nutritious matter contained
is small, but the gelatinous, slightly
sharp flavor is said to be delicious
when one's palate becomes educated
to it. Like oysters and olives, which
delicate viands some \ people care for
naturally, some acquire the taste for,
after painful effort, and most people
have thrust upon them, the connois
seurs will have to educate the palatea
of the people before they can thor
oughly appreciate the seaweed.
Should the taste for this unique food
assume large proportions, California
could undoubtedly compete wifh Japan
in supplying the markets, as the Â«dible
variety grows in profusion here.
The Chinese dry the kelp, press it in
to thin round cakes, which are then
put into water and boiled. They be
come soft and expand so that when
ready to eat they are about three
times the size they were before boiling.
They are either eaten alone or served
in conjunction with chicken or meat. 1
Nor is China the only place where some
variety or the algae is used as a com
mon article of food. The Alaria Es
culenta, commonly called Bladder
locks, is regarded both in Scotland and
Ireland as a very toothsome dainty; it
is accorded the same degree of respect
that the French bestow upon frogs'
legs. It is usually eaten raw or plunged
in boiling water and then removed
immediately, serving it either hot or
cold.
While there seems every possibility
that the seaweed will be given a place
on our menus, it will never become a
staple article of food, owing to its indi
gestibility. Dr. William A. Setchell of
the University of California, who is
professor of botany and a well-known
contributor on seaweed subjects to
scientific journals, said that there was
not a single variety of seaweed that
contained eno-ugh nutritious substance
to make it highly valuable as a food,
but that if properly prepared the weed
might tickle the palate at the expense
of terrific labor on the part of the di
gestive organs. Professor Setchell has
just returned from collecting seaweeds
in the vicinity of Fort Ross. He was
accompanied on his tour of investiga
tion by C. P. Nott, assistant in the bot
any department. Together they suc
ceeded in securing eighty varieties,
among them the kind that is used in
the manufacture of iodine.
Professor Setchell recounted that the
Scotch lady with whom he and Mr.
Nott boarded at Fort Ross was ex
tremely fond of the Bladderlock va
riety, and was very anxious that they
should find some of it, as she had not
tasted any since she had left Scotland.
Perhaps the variety that will gain
the greatest hold on a certain portion
of the community is the Fucus vesicu
losus, which is said to be the most
efficient remedy for obesity. One au
thority on algae says that were this
variety used as the basis for an anti
fat remedy it would mean thousands
of dollars to the manufacturer and a
proportionate falling off in flesh among
those afflicted with a superabundance
of fatty tissue.
It is predicted that before long sea
weed will be put on bill of fares in the
principal restaurants here, alongside
the place of honor held by frogs' less,
Welsh rarebit and sparrows' tongues.

the same braid.
English sleeves are even smaller
than they appear in Paris, and a good
majority of evening gowns have the
merest excuse for a shoulder strap,
according to a letter from London.
When dowers are used fur the trim
ming of the gown it is a pretty fash
ion to use them for a covering to this
strap, and among other odd devices
that we see on evening gowns are
waistbands, both of fur and flowers.
Rather a bizarre appearance is given
to a gown of white satin by a Sock
of late butterflies in various sizes, ir
regularly arranged on the front and
sides of the skirt. The butterflies are
of black lace and colored stones are
cleverly Interwoven into the lace. In
stead of being entirely appliqued to
the gown some of the wings are stiff
ened so as to stand away from the
satin. The corsage is draped with
white tulle, held by more of these but
terflies, end the sleeves are of pheas
ant green velvet, this shade appear
ing in the embroidery on the butter
fly wings. Colored sleeves, whether of
velvet or tulle, are among the novel
ties of the season and are enthusi
astically accepted.
If a great variety of color is for
bidden Sn the hats themselves, the
pins with which they are fastened on
are not thus restricted. I saw a
green velvet hat the other day pinned
to the hair of the pretty wearer with
one hat pin set with amethyst, an
other of turquoise and one of moon
stones, to say nothing of the little
jeweled butterfly clasp that caught
the veil at the back and the gay-col
ored beetle that held it to the brim
in front.
One of the latest novelties in veils
I is one in a fine framework of horse
hair, lined with white or black tulle
and dotted with black velvet spots.
This is meant for damp-weather wear,
when an ordinary veil is liable to
! cockle up and stick to the face. Veils
j are not so much devoted now to
i beauty as utility. The white net veil
i that launders well is the best for gen
; eral outdoor use.
Hats with draped velvet crowns and
brims of astrakhan are the newest
wrinkle in millinery. One of wistaria
; blue velvet crown has brim of gray
astrakhan. This is English, and ex
ceedingly smart. A chinchilla toque
is a new thing, trimmed with two
shades of pomegranate, velvet and
clusters of dahlias. Another novelty
in toques is composed entirely of par
rot's plumage, aid wings in this fash
ion and exquisite shade of green.
Wide bracelets and necklaces that
clasp close around the throat, after
the fashion of the Duchess of Marl
borough's famous pearls, are really in
fashion, as lons predicted they would
be. Hut all not ..eing as fortunate as
the Duchess in j> isstsninp the real ar
ticle, strings .>f imitation pearls
fastened with silver clasps are worn
about the neck and wrists with even
ing gowns. But pearls are trying to
the complexion. Gold necklaces and
bracelets are more becoming, hence
are bound to be most In vogu>\
The violet is the flower of Â».he day.
Even the rose must stand aside in its
favor. The bigger the bunch the bet
ter â so far as f;t?hi<>n is concerned,
but not for the pocket book. As the
â¢ n advances so does the popu
larity and the price of the violet.
Bigger and bigger grow the Victor
ian bonnets, but only the very young
and slender girls take to them. This
is wise. The Victorian bonnet is only
at its best when screening a very l'a'r
fresh face about which little natural
bob curls may i luster. At a recent
wedding the maids wore Victorian
bonnets. One was of gray beavrr.
against which was laid plumes of pale
blue, cream, lace, pink poppies an.l
white satin ribbon.
Primrose and pale-cameo pink crepe
de chine Is being shown among the
n. \v things for debutantes' and brides
maid's frocks. Trimmed with pearl
and opal beaded passementeries, this
is like the robe of a fairy princess.
It may also be made very effective
in combination with brocaded fab
rics in delicate tints. Its most charm
ing effect is when combined with peau
de sole with draperies of silk net of
the same tint and bodice garnitures
of sprays of roses and cascades of
Venetian lace.
Many of the long Rernhardt sleeves
of gauze, turned out by the best mo
distes, have, I notice, invisible lin
ings of soft net. This gives more body
to the sleeve, and if the arm is de
fective in roundness it is improved by
the addition of the net. In trans
parent bodices built over the low silk
linings fashion makes the same pro
vision, the net tinder the shirring or
tucking holding the airy material nice
ly in place and at the same time pre
serving its transparency. One of the
prevailing fashions in full dress is the
wearing of very long wrinkled sleeves
with low cut or half-low bodices.
There is already a hint in the shops
<>f what will be worn as the spring
season comes on in tailor-made gowns.
Oxford suitings in tri-color melanges,
boodfl effects in French camel's hair,
India cashmere, genuine Scotch
cheviots. English serges and diago
nals, and creped cloth in dark and
medium light colors, and in spring
weight, are among the newest things
the shops are showing.
There are uncounted novelties in
sashes, and, although gay colors would

hardly be becoming worn by a fat or
short- waisted woman, they are charm
ing additions to the costume of a tall
or slender one.
A sash of plaid ribbon in which red
and white predominate is edged with
a zig-zag insertion of black lace and
ruffled with black chiffon.
Another is of bright canary-tinted
taffeta, having ruffles of lace applied at
intervals of about two inches from
the belt to the ends. The ruffles are
put on in curves and the ends are also
curved. The sash is attached to a
girdle of softly folded silk, which has
a spray of small bows resembling
leaves mounting from the waist to the
right shoulder.
A most effective sash is of black
satin ribbon, cut into, small, bias
stripes, with lace insertion. The girdle
is pointed at the sides and caught
down in front by a steel buckle.
Despite all that has been said to the
contrary, the hair is as much waved
as ever, the only difference being that
that the large wave is no longer consid
ered good form, a smaller and much
neator one having taken its place.
There is some talk of reviving the
Greek knot of some years back, and,
given a well-shaped head, few styles
are so becoming.

brought to the fashionable seaside resort
the old -fashioned element of a happy,
Santa Olausy Christmas. The children
are still puzzling, however, over the ques
tion, "How in the world could Santa
Claus tell which of the many chimneys
to come down?"

Here's the Latest Dance
That Has Just Come to Town
ANEW dance is coming to town.
The society girl is practicing the
quaint curtsey of the graceful
minuet and being taught to point cor
rectly her dainty slippered toe.
The new dance requires many of the
steps of the old-time minuet and is a
square dance. Newport was its birth
place, and it is called the Newport
lancers.
The dignified grace and the gliding
movements which characterize it are
a welcome change from the romping
dances of the past season. The dances
which are but little more than a whirl
and a rush are going out of fashion.
Even the popular two-step is being
danced to slower time.
This season's debutantes are show
ing a decided preference for conversa
tion. They object to the hurried word
whispered when half out of breath.
They prefer not to look flurried. They
want every stray hair of their pom
padour to stay where it is placed.
They don't wish to dance as if caught
in a whirlwind, but they do wish to
ci.py their great-grandmothers' man
ners â in the dance.
In many ways the new dance is like
the ordinary lancers, and can be
danced to the same music, only played
in slower time. There are five figures.
First figure: Heads cross over.Turn
partner with right hand. Cross with
sides to right twice to places. Sides
change places the first (third) time;
the second (fourth) time back to
places. Turn corner with right hand.
Partners salute: sides the same.
In the first figure in turning the cor
ner with right hand the minuet step
and the minuet pose are introduced.
Second figure: Heads ladies' half

BOYS AND GIRLS` PAGE
LITTLE NELLIE AND
THE SILVER PRINCE
Little Nellie had heard that after
noon that her papa had lost all his
money and that the farm would be
taken from him the next day.
So Nellie went out to talk to the oak
tree, her old friend, and tell all her
troubles. She heard a voice s.iy:
"fheer up. little girl."'
Sb shre looked around, but saw noth
ing except a big white lily that grew
near the path. The lily was shaking.
and no wonder, for out of it climbed
the queerest and prettiest little being
that ever was.
. He was dressed all in silver cloth,
but on his silver helmet and silver
coat of mail was a yellow stain which
..came from the pollen of the lily.
"The Silver Prince at your service."
said this little one, with a low bow,
taking off his hat to little Nellie, who
. looked puzzled and a little afraid.
"I â I don't understand," said little
Nellie, who now se?med to be fully
awake.
"Why," said the Silver Prince, who
was really a fairy, "that's easy
enough to understand. I'm the Silver
Prmce, and whatever I touch I can
turn into silver."
"I xvish you could help me," paid lit
tle Nellie.
"I'd very much like to help you, Nel
lie." said the Silver Prince, "but I've
lost my wand, whi-ch I need to make
things turn into silver, and I will not
be able to find it again until the. moon
is full. That will not be until to-mor
row night."
"That .will be too late, thon," an
swered Nellie. "YV'e must have the
money at noon to-morrow or we must
â¢all. go away from here. Papa has been
sick and could not earn any money
lately." !
The Stiver Prince thought a little.
"I. don't s.ee what I can do," he sail.
. "But if I had a. blue gentian and three
â¢ gpldenrod flowers and a tiger lily, all
â¢ picked' in the meadows, by a very small
\ gift perhaps I <ould do something. I
could try!" \ â 
Now it happened that Nellie know-
Just where to go to find these flowers.
AFTER MAKING A RAID ON THE PARK MUSEUM THE BUMPKINS AND THE GOAT HILL BAND ENGAGE IN A SHAM BATTLE.
She ran off as fast as she could and
came back with them in her hands.
There sat the Silver Prince, whist
line softly to himself a fairy tune and
thinking. He thought so hard th;it
Nellie had to speak three times before
he noticed her.
â¢'Oh, yes," he said, when he looked
up. "You put those flowers down
here one at a time with your left
hand, with your thumb pointed out
ward, and then shut your eyes, and
don't open them until I count forty
four. Then you can look."
Nellie shut her eyes after she had
put down the llowers, but she did so
want to peek through her lingers that
she was glad when the Silver Prince
said "Now, look."
A span of field mice, in harness,
Nellie saw, and they were drawing a
Joad â something white and shiny.
"It is my wand," said the Silver
Prince. "When 1 say certain magic
words it win nut only turn some things
to silver but do other great acts. See,
now, what it will do. The Fairy
King, who is fond of the flowers you
brought, has sent to me in return for
the flowers which I sent him by a
fairy, my wand, which he hadâ and
the whole did not take a minute. I
will bid you good-by, and go to the
Fairy King, but I will bring you good
news by and by."
So saying, the Silver Prince touched
the field mice with his wand, after
some magic words, and the mice turned
Into lovely little ponies. Then the
Prince, with his wand, turned a gpurd
shell into a chariot. He was a pretty
sight as > ,0 stepped into the chariot, his
armor all shining and a brave little
sword by his side. He gathered up the
reins, made another low bow to >.*â¢â !
lie, and in a minute was out of sight,
wand and all.
Then Nellie cried again and her tears
splashed the lily, but she felt happier
than sho had before. The Silver Prim*
had gone without turning anything
into silver, but she had his promise of
good news soon.
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUXDAY, JANUARY 2, 1898.
When would the news come?
"In the morning," said the lark.
"Morning," paid the robin.
Nellie slept very little that night. She
was astir the next morning almost be
fore the robin in the fig tree. She went
to where she had seen the Silver Prince.
He did not come. She waited and
waitedâ and then she thought that he
might have forgotten her. She went
to the house and sat in her mama's lap
and cried. Then she went around the
oM farm to say "a truly good-by."
She fÂ»ll ash-, p. being tired out, under
the oak tree, her hand touching the
white lily. It was noon when she
awoke. The man who was to take her
borne away had come. Her father
waked her to tell her that it was time
that they should go.
'"Let me carry my whito lily," coaxed
Nellie; "the man will not care for
that."
She picked the lily, but it was so
heavy that the stalk broke in her hand.
Then Nellie made a queer little noise
and fell upon her hands and knees and
began to pick up little balls of pure sil
ver.
"Silver," she exclaimed, joyfully, "sil
ver, my papa, dear. See! It is running
out of the lily more and more! And
now we can pick it up and save the
home!"
Does any little child need to be told
that the Silver Prince was there, al
though he could not be seen, and that,
just at the right moment, he had touch
ed Nellie's tears with his wand and
had turned them into silver?
WOULD PICKLE HER MAMMA.
A Memphis young lady who recently
studied in Germany tells a good story
of a young German lady who was
studying English and who used to
write letters in English to her parents.
One day the German lady handed a
letter to the Memphis lady, saying:
"Here is the letter which ] have writ
ten to my mother. I want you to read
it over and see if it is properly writ
ten."
The letter was all right except the
closing phrase, which was as follows:
"God pickle and keep you."
An investigation proved that the
young German woman in looking for a
synonym for "preserve" had come
across "pickle."
STORY OF
KITTY KAT.
Little Norman's one great treasure is
what he calls his "kitten cat." She
crawled under the back yard fence one
day to get away from some boys who
were throwing stones at her, and Nor
man's mother lei him "adopt'" her and
keep her for his own, and since that
time her life has been a happy one.
Norman's mother has taught him to
be kind \o all dumb animals, so his
kitty is never pulled around by the tail
nor held up by her legs nor squeezed
until she has only breath enough left
to <ry out with pain. Instead of this,
she is smoothed and patted and fed
|hnd given plenty of water as well as
milk to drink. And when Norman
wishes to play with her he has a cork
with a feather stuck in it. which is tied
on the end of a piece of twine, and this
he drags about and swings in the air,
and the kitten runs after it and jumps
up after it, and they both have fine
times.
Norman had had three birthdays, but
when his fourth came he felt that his
kitty kat ought to have one also.
"She ought to have a birthday the
same as I," he said to his mamma the
evening before the eventful day. And
his mamma promised that she should.
The next day when Norman got up
he was given a whole lot of new things
and plenty of goodies. And kitty kat
was not forgotten. There was a nice,
new collar for her and the prettiest
ribbon bow you ever saw.
Of course kitty kat enjoyed these
very much, but she would eat none of
the goodies that Norman had received.
This made him very sad. So he went
to the kitchen and told cook about it.
"I'll fix kitty kat all right." said the
cook, and she cut off a nice slice of
fresh steak that Norman took to Ma
pet. Kitty kat ate it. you may be sure,
and then they both had a lone: romp
together. Norman enjoyed it all and
told his mamma that it was the nicest
birthday h* ever had.

CRUISE OF THE CALIFORNIA.
[Synopsis of prpcciinsr chaptersâ The yacht
California, having r.^tr.-ated before a horde of
savages, on shore and in <anoes, in a lagoon,
on the coast of New Ouinea, is driven back
by night to the lagoon by a typhoon, and
Harry Ostend. secinc the savages" campflres
on the shore, determines to give the savages a
Hnal lesson.]
CHAPTER X.
Hardly had the California dropped
anrhor when Harry Ostend called the
six brave California boys and told
them of his plans. Tom was too badly
hurt to take part in any adventures.
The other five were impatient to do
some thing: to distinguish themselves.
"I am going to send out two boats,
with muffled oars," said Mr. Ostend,
"and each boat will have six men in it.
Sam will command one and 'Shorty'
will command the other. Binnie and
Ned will serve as lookouts and general
guides in the respective boats."
"And where are we going?" broke
out Sam, impatiently.
"Don't be impatient," said Mr. Os
tend, " and you shall know. You will
row quietly across the lagoon. Shorty's
boat will be beached about one mile
south and Sam's about one mile north
of the savages' campfires, without
noise. Along these two miles of beach
are scattered the war canoes of the
savages. The lookouts only will land
The crows will remain in the boats.
ready to take the lookouts on board
and to row away upon a minute's no
tice. The lookouts will be given oil
and gunpowder and fuses. They will
connect the canoes by the fuses and
oil them well. When all is ready the
fuses will be lighted and the oil and
gunpowder will do the rest."
"But," said Binnie, "the flash when
we light the fuses will startle the sav
ages and the light of the burning ca
noes will enable them to see, us and
they will swim out by the hundreds af
ter us."
"Yes," assented Harry- Ostend, "that
is just what will happen. Here is
where the captains of the two boats
will come in. As soon as they see the
flash of the fuses they will set afloat
these queer little boats. They have
sails. The wind will take them di
rectly toward the savages, and by the
time the savages reach the beach the
little boats will be at the beach with
their cargoes."
"Cargoes?"
"Yes. They are loaded with dyna
mite. They are my invention. The cap
tains will light these fuses and when
the lookouts are on board will row
away as fast as possible. They will
have time to get beyond the danger
line by quick work; but there must be
no bungling. Clear away the boats,
Mr. Detor."
Here was an adventure calling for
daring and coolness. The boys sprung
to their places in the boats. Simultan
eously Sam and Shorty gave the word
of command to their crews. Eight
oars dipped quietly in the dark and
heaving waters. Sam and Shorty held
the tiller lines firmly and the boats
re-entered the lagoon and began their
dangerous voyage. The crews were
ordered not to speak under- any cir
cumstance. They sped forward, slack
ening their speed only when they
neared the farther beach. Both boats
w. iv easily beached. Binnie and Ned
leaped lightly ashore. The boats were
backed off and held in readiness to
take the brave lads on board.
The war canoes were placed about
as Mr. Ostend had thought. Some few,
which were apart from the others,
wÂ« re speedily ruined with sharp au
gers, with which holes were bored in
the bottoms. The others the lookouts
smeared with oil and powder. But.
as Binnie and Ned went forward in
opposite directions, they found that
upon the largest two canoes the camp
fires of the savages cast their light.
So far all had gone well. But Bin
nie and Ned had now to roll along the
beach in the shadows of the big ca
noes, which belonged to the great
chiefs of the natives. Ned, with ready
auger, had bored his last canoe.
Suddenly from the darkness rose a
tall, dusky figure directly in front of
Binnie. It was the chief who had been
taken from the hulk at sea by Mr.
Ostend. Binnie was as quick as the
snvage. With ready H<>\\ match he
leaped to his fuse before the chief
could interfere. Along the fuse the fire
ran until it looked like a ribbon of fire.
At the same instant quick-witted Np<l
lighted his fuse and plunged into the
water.
A series of flashes followed and the
canoes burst into flames. Sam and
Shorty, teeing the yelling Mnragec
rushinp toward the beach, launched
the little dynamite boats. A little
later the air was rent with a series
of heavy explosions that sounded like
cannonading.
The dynamite boats had gone off.
The savages, frightened by the terrific
noises and the shocks, which had
thrown them on their faces, turned
back.
The crews of the boats were safe.
Xed was on Sam's boat, but where was
Binnie? He was not in either boat.
Where was he? Had he been killed in
the water by the dynamite boats? Was
he in the hands of the howling and
infuriated savages? From both boats
signal rockets sped up toward the mid
night sky â signals for help.
The California, outside of the lagoon,
sent skyward answering rockets. In
five minutes the California's flash
light was working and the opening
through the reef into the lagoon was
in sight and the yacht was carefully
piloted through.
Binnie was not dead. He was a cap
tive, and the savages at the instant
the signal rockets were fired from the
boats were discussing whether they
should put him to death.
Binnie might have escaped had he
not waited to fire his fuse. He saw
this clearly, but he was- too brave to
leave the duty undone that was his.
His work and Ned's was effective.
Hardly one of the entire proud fleet
of war canoes was left in condition to
float. The ruin was complete. But
amid the explosions Binnie was knock
ed down by a flying piece of wood.
Before he could rise the chief had him
in an iron embrace. Other savages
struck him. He was the target for
many blows, but he made no sound.
So brave was he that at that instant
the chief decided to save his life and
make him his son.
There were two great chiefs in the
camp. The one who was found at sea
was one. His name was Mah-Coh-
Gaaâ "the king of many villages." The
other was Ghoor-Ghee-Tee â "the
The California Sending Up Signal Rockets.
greatest of skull-hunters." He had al- I
ready 100 skulls of enemies killed in
battle. He wanted to add Binnie's
skull to the collection. Instantly a
great quarrel broke 'out between these
chiefs, when Mah-Coh-Gaa claimed
Binnie.
"He shall be mine," Ghoor-Ghee-Tee
said, smiting his breast with his
clenched fist. "Who tries to take him
from me will die by my ironwood war
club to-nijrht. "
"Die!" laughed Mah-Coh-Gaa. "he is
mine, and swift as the war eagle from
the storm cloud will fall my wrath on
him who opposes me."
The scene was a strange one. Close
to the water's edge the fleet of burn
ing canoes was sending up clouds of
sparks and volumes of smoke, and
about the ruins were hundreds of wail
ing and angry warriors. The light
brought into view the almost trackless
forests; the ocean with its white surf
beating upon the coral reef; the broad
lagoon upon which the searchlight of
the California was playing.
"Let the boy decide." said a hideous
old witch doctor, a bent and shriveled
woman, "who shall take his life."
This decision, which all the savages
approved by hoarse shouts, was made
known to Binnie.
F.rect and proudly stood the boy and
looked around fearlessly upon the mul
titudo of warriors who were waiting
anxiously for his death. He knew a
few word* of the savage dialect, which
had been taught to him by John La
tour.
"I will die," he said, "by the handi
of him who is the greatest warrior."
"Be it so," said the witch doctor
"the great chiefs shall battle to thÂ«
death, if they will, for the prizeâ
white boy."
The two chiefs bowed approval. The?
then were to duel, and at once, by the
light of . the Jiiskering torches, at the
scene of the burning war canoes and
under the very guns of the California.
The wily chiefs knew that the white
men would not fire upon them while
Binnie was alive among them and
might be killed by flying bullets.

WHAT SHE THOUGHT
"Oh, mamma, I'm not a bit sleepy,"
Was what my little girl said
When I told her it was "almost time"
For her to "go to bed."
"And mamma, just let me sit up
A little while â please do,
And to-morrow night I'll go to bed
Just when you want me to."
Ten minutes passed, and with a sigh
She closed her sleepy eyes.
And soon was sailing on Slumber sea.

That the inherent and almost uni

lustrated by an incident which oc
curred in the city of Bogota, United
States of Colombia. Like its sister
States, Colombia has passed through
the long and trying periods of Spanish
oppression, of revolution and of final
independence, so that even the children
of Spanish-American countries know
what the word liberty means.
In the suburbs of the capital of Co
lombia, the city of Bogota, is located
the Jesuit college of San Luis Gonzaga.
It is devoted almost entirely to the edu

direction of Senor Aurelia Martin Ca

One morning in the early part of Sep

breakfast, and, addressing their in

their morning rolls to the cause of lib

'We will go without them," said the
spokesman, "and let those poor fellows

"What poor fellows?" asked the in

"Why, the Cubans! the poor Cubans.

win to the drama. The Frawley Com
pany will occupy the Baldwin for a
i <>nsiderable part of the season. This
means that while the Frawleys are
with us all touring attractions of the
higher class will be shut out. We will
have to take our drama of the Fraw
leys or go without it. We must look
to the Frawley Company for the new
playsâ for, particularly, the new Eng
lish plays, such as were sent In other
days by the Frohmans.
And since it is my pleasure, as well
as business, to go to the play. I should
like to think of the coming stock sea-
son at the Baldwin as successful, be
cause of clean, discriminate perform
ances rather than because it offers
cheap prices and the only place in
; town where one may look to find the
: serious drama.
A Western manager needs no es
i pecial gift to enable him to journey to
New York and purchase the rights
I to new plays which have already won
distinction; but at this end of the line
j is required some one especially quaii
| fled to coach and cast these produc
tions. Is Mr. Frawley the man for the
work?
I do not wish to go on record as the
blighter of the coming crop of Fraw
! leys, nor to seem unfriendly to the lo
j cal monopoly, for whom I hope to
: chronicle many a comely enterprise;
! but the responsibilities of Messrs.
1 Friedlander, Gottlob & Marx for the
â¢ year 3898 are heavyâ and the heaviest
of them all is Mr. Frawley.

Many of us will miss Frank Worth

i Save us from snobbery; but in this age
of rush and brusquerie it is worth the
going to the play just to see a person
or two Who have the time and instinct
for fine manners. Where ten of our
actors can play the ancient king with
royal conviction, not more than one
can do as much by the modern gentle
man. Worthing has the air, the sim
i plicity, the appreciation of latter-day
! chivalryâ to say nothing of his being
the best all-round actor in the com
pan>\_He smoothed the Frawleys on
j their weakest point, deportment, and
jhe will be missed. I hope that some

lins"in its present shape appears to be
another mistake by Augustus Thomas,
the cleverest of American dramatists.
Thfre is no telling what the commer
cial fortunes of the play may be in the
hands of Stuart Robson and his ac
complished company, but I should
shrink from predicting for it success.
I saw "'The Jucklins" twice within the
past week, and with greater disap
pointment the second time. Some of
the lines are masterly, and often the
eharactersattain to ideal identity; and
the awkward virtues of shy men are
handled as only Thomas handles such
local phases; but the motive, plot and
construction are deadly. A strong
third act -vn ilts away to nothing, and
the last act is not only a banal anti
climax but it is in direct antithesis
to sane playwriting. It is a crude
and unreasonable surprise to the au
dience. If l>y â¢ single line in the last
act it be said that young Jucklin did
not kill the man, then where is the
sense of the three preceding acts
Whlcb ?ay that he did kil! him? Mr.
Thomas has forgotten that the vital
issues of a play must be inevitable
and duly presagedâ else how is the in
terest of a play to survive a second
sitting? Practically Mr. Thomas has
tried to write three acts of a sensible
play to no better purpose than that of
saying in the fourth "I was only fool
ing."
â¢ â¢ â¢
A dramatic contribution of d nn:!i r
oidei and one that laughs defiam at
the caviling critic is "At Gay Coney
Island," now playing at the Columbia.
It is the sleekest, quickest, snuggest,
funniest thing of its sort that I hare
seen in ages; and, strangely enough, it
is as clever in the writing as in the de
livery. So far as construction may be
applied to shows of this kind, "In Gay
Cc-ney Island" has got it. Not that
there is a plot to be worked out on legi
timate farcical lines â but each comic
climax, each specialty, falls int> '.h â¢â¢
general rush with a patness that is
really noble. If Matthews and Bulger
planned this work, they are wonders.
They are wonders anyway. Nothing
could be more effective than the calm,
assured monotone in which Mr.
Matthews voices the relentless songs
and jests of Dr. Aiken Payne, and the
genial, juicy temperament which Mr.
Bulger looses on Hi Price, the plum
ber. Miss Jane Whitbeck. too, is very
much to the good; especially in a dark,
razor-edged coon song called "My
Lore's a Gamblin' Man," which she
sings with the real squash-Colored in
sinuation. The piece would i,Â». even
better without the musical ro<w in the
second act.

Mr. Robson will devote the second
(and last) week of his engagement at
the Baldwin to a revival of Bronson
Howard's celebrated comedy. "The
Henrietta." One could enumerate the
many parts Mr. Robson has played in
past yearsâ all the way from the farc
ical to the Shakespeareanâ without
finding one so well adapted to his
unique personality as "Bertie the
Lamb." "The Henrietta" is a vivid
representation of bustling, contempor
ary human experience, full of the
spirit that actuates the men and
women we see about us to-day. It
has a clean moral tone that never dis
agreeably obtrudes itself, but rather
is suggested in a modest Indi
rect way through the illustrations of
wholesome life and innocent mirth.
Mr. Robaon's supporting company,
which does such splendid character
work in "The Jucklins," is said to be
equally happy in the more urban en
vironment of "The Henrietta." Mrs.
Robson has a brilliant opportunity in
the part of the Widow.
Willie Collier, the quaint comedian,
will appear In Dv Souchet's farce,
"The Man Cram Mexico," following the
engagement of Stuart Robson at the
Baldwin Theaiwf. Mr. Collier, it is
said, will be supported >>y a well-bal
anced company of comedians, includ
ing Louise Alien, Maclyn Arbuckle,
Dan Mason and Violet Rand. The
star is a favorite with theater-goers
here as elsewhere, and is remembered
in San Francisco in association with

record-breaker at the Columbia during
the past week, every seat in the house
having been occupied at each perform
ance, and great numbers having been
unable to gain admission. Much of the
music is new and taking and is accred
ited to the authorship of Maurice Levi,
musical director of the organization.
The management has provided good
scenic equipment for a musical comedy,
and the company contains several ca
pable entertainers in addition to a
well-dressed and well-drilled chorus
of pretty girls. Notable among the
specialists is Miss Jane Whitbeck, a
soubrette with a gift for darky songs,
and Miss Josie de Witt, with some
skill on the violin. The engagement
continues throughout the coming
week, including Sundays.
Following "At Gay Coney Island"
will come "Jolly Nellie McHenry" at
the Columbia Theater for an engage
ment limited to one week.
Alcazar.
Belaseo and Fyles" military drama,
"The (lirl I Left F.ehind Me," which
has played to crowded he-uses both at
matinees and evening performances for
the past two weeks at the Alcazar, will
run for another week. "Esmeralda" is
now in active rehearsal and will follow
the war drama, and "Forbidden Fruit,"
a three-act farce by Dion Boucicault,
will follow "Esmeralda." "Forbidden
Fruii" t.-llÂ« the story of two erring
husbands who, tired of the humdrum
of married life, so out for a good time
and v champagne supper with a couple
of actresses. They tell a tale of "press
ing: business" to their respective wives
and the wives grow suspicious. It is
only after long and untiring efforts
that the two men succeed in reaching
the scene of their festivities, with their
wives hot on the trail. Just as things

Morosco's.
"THe District Fair," a comedy-melo
drama, with sensational features, and
a great racing scene, will be the next
production at Morosco's, and the big
stage will be utilized to its full extent
for the production. All of the stock
company will be in the long cast, to
gether with several additions, among
which are a couple of handsome race
horses. The scene of the drama
opens in rugged New England, and
depicts farm-life, with the various
types of character that form interest
ing studiÂ«s in country life. Mr.
Pascoe has been cast for the part of
Arthur Graylock, a young man of the
period who has been drawn into
trouble by his own waywardness, aid
ed by the influence of Jacob Rentz
law, who induces him to risk his em
ployers' money on the races and then
manages matters so that he will lose,
and hoping thus to ruin him in the es
timation of Nellie Fielding, his affi
anced wife, to whose favor Rentzlaw
aspires. A complicated plot with in
teresting features carries the charac
ters through to a satisfactory finale.
The scenic features will be up t<f the
usual standard, and the comedy ele
ment will be more than usually inter
esting.
Orpheum.
The event on the bill at the Orpheum
for this week will be the comedy
sketch, "A New Year's Dream," pre
sented by the winsome Patrice, sup
ported by Alf Hampton and J. F.
Whitbeck. This comedy is said to be
full of funny situations and to afford
the trio the best display of its tal
ents. An acrobatic act by the Farnum
Bros, is said to be strong. Fred
Brown, coon singer and rag dancer,
and Kitty Mitchell, singing and danc
ing soubrette, will appear in new spec
ialties. The hold-overs will have sev
eral new acts, which, together with
the four new turns, should make the
Orpheum programme a strong one.
TiVoli.
The Tivoli holiday spectacle, "Moth
er Goose," or 'The Strange Advent
ures of Jack and Jill," has made a hit
with both the young and old, particu
larly the young, and will be continued
until further notice. Since the open
ing nights much cutting has been done
and many new songs, dances and sit
uations introduced. The cast includes
Edwin Stevens, Thos. C. Leary, Phil.
Branson, John J. Raffael, Robert Dun
bar. Florence Wolcott, Edith Hall,
Tillie Salinger, Oracle Gray, Jennie
Stockmeyer; also the six children â
the little Misses Claire Fex. Hazel
Callihan, Georgette Orr. and Masters
Jack Robertson, Arnold Grazier and
Arthur Fex. The three ballets under
the direction of Sig. Remonde are
much admired, and Oscar Fest'a
transformation is applauded nightly.
A second edition is in preparation.

with his books. One evening his wife,
who had been out for some hours, re
turned to find the house remarkably
quiet. She had left the children play
ing about, but now they were nowhere
to be seen. She asked what had be
come of them, and the professor ex
plained that, as they had made a good
deal of noise, he had put them to bed
without waiting for her or calling a
maid.
"I hope they gave you no trouble,"
she said.
"No." said the â  professor, "with the
exception of the one in the cot there.
He objected a good deal to my undress
ing him and putting him to bed."
The wife went to inspect the cot.

8000 YEARS OF TIME.
It may be consolation to reflect that
great Caesar was not fortunate in the
matter of timekeepers. A water clock
marked the flight of his imperial time.
It is interesting to note in the progress
of clock making from that crude state
wherewith Caesar was doubtless con
tent, to the highly complex and ap
parently perfect system now in use,
that the heavenly bodies were usually
represented. Those landmarks in the
history of clock making whose import
ance has led to their preservation,
either in chronicle or in fact, show this
comprehensiveness of effort.
The celebrated clock in the famous
cathedral at Strasburg describes the
motions of the planets. A clock pre
sented to Frederick II by Saladin in
the thirteenth century marked no*, only
the hours, but also the course of the
sun and moon and planets. A clock
made by an English abbot in the four
teenth century indicated in addition to
these the ebb and flood tides.
In the eighteenth century a German
who invented astronomical clocks con
ceived the still more comprehensive
idea" of measuring time in its whole ex
tent. A hand of universal history in
dicates principal epochs of history in
the Old Testament and the great events
of the future founded on the Apoc
alypse. Eight thousand years were em
braced in the revolutions. A century
hand marks the year of the century
and makes the circuit in 100 years.
This clock also represents the motions
of the planets, and they make their
revolutions in the same time and man
ner that they actually do in the
heavens.
The heavenly orbs alone were con
sulted for marking the passage of time
when ho other method was known. At
the same source to-day are regulated
these masterpieces of human ingenuity,
whose complex of precise mechanism
would have filled with wonder the
minds of the old monks of the middle
ages, who made these contrivances for
the marking of time a possibility.
SOME STRANGE VERDICTS.
In a certain case of death from intox
ication, the verdict was, "Death by
hanging around a rum shop."
At an Alnwick inquest, about twenty
years ago, an Irishman having been
killed by a heavy blow from the land
lord of a public house, the jury return
ed a verdict that the innkeeper had
struck over hard, which they brought
in as justifiable homicide.
At an inquest on a man killed in a
quarrel, in which it was stated that the
deceased was the aggressor, the ver
dict was, "We find the deceased, John
Regan, came to his death through call
ing Michael Doherty a thief. " and
from that unique but indisputable find
ing the jury would not budge.
A Coroner's jury in the Midland
counties, on a death through an ex
plosion, gave their written verdict,
"Blode to pieces bi the biler a-bustin'
an' killin' of him dead."
A jury at Warwickshire Quarter Ses
sions, through their foreman, said,
"We find the prisoner not guilty, but
we should like the court to reprimand
him," which was very near "Innocent,
but don't do it again."
An American Judge out West, ad
dressing a jury, said, "You ken go out
and find a verdict; if you can't find one
of your own, get the one the last jury
used." This they did, and returned
with a verdict of "Suicide in the ninth
degree."
Mrs. Tiars â Oh, I just hate washday.
I wish we never had to wear our
clothes more than once.
Mrs. Wheeler â Ah, that .'shows you're

MOST POWERFUL X RAY
EVER PRODUCED.
THERE has rocently been placed in the Lawronee scientific school of Harvard
College the Â»;ifatest X rr-.y machine in the world. It possesses thÂ»> Mtonfabtog
tlecti'c motive force of IJMjOVi volts. This voltage, if utilized upon an electric
railway, would be sufficient to keep 2400 cars constantly in motion for a single
â â 'â 'â  â  â  day.
:: :â¢. â¢ This great machineâ for sreat it is in size as well as forceâ is operated under
â  â¢â¢' the Bai#crÂ»'lslDn of Professor Trowbridge, director of Jefferson physical laboratory
â  ; - of Harvard, and one of the best known of modern electricians. Professor Trow
â â :.â -â¢â . bridge describes his machine as a modification of Plante's so-called rheostatic ma
.. chine, but it is far more practical and more powerful.
â ?;."-â â  . Sixty plates of glass which form condensers are the really essential part of the
.machine. These plates are charged In multitude by 10,000 storage cells, and are
:-".. : . discharged in series, giving intense disruptive discharges over four feet in length.
. Jiist imagine a stream of electric sparks four feet long, snapping, crackling, buzz
:-;â -â  -ing, in that s;ime weird, uncanny fashion in which the lightning sometimes plays
.... :for an instant along its zig-zag track from cloud to cloud. The length of the elec
.*â¢ trie spark is exactly proportional to the voltage lengths over one inch.
â¢ â¢ To those who have ever seen Â£JÂ» X ray machine in operation, the size of Pro
â  -'.fessor Trowbridge's giant can best be explained by advising them to compare the
.' ! electric disruptive charge with that of the ordinary machine. Perhaps the largest
X ray machine in the country next to that ownÂ»-d by Professor Trowbridge is the
. property of Professor W. J. Morton of New York. The distance between the posi
tive and negative poles in this machine is not more than a foot; it is over this dis
â¢ tanre that the disruptive electrical discharges pass from pole to pole. Imagine,
therefore, a machine where the positive and negative poles are four feet apart, and
some idea of the Immense superiority of Professor Trowbridge's machine wn be
â gained.
The X ray that this giant machine can make possible is more powerful than
.any of which Professor Roentgen ever talkedâ or dreamed, probably. It is l.<
'. lieved that through it and the developments resulting from its use a new era will
â  . ' dawn fo far as the availability of the X ray is concerned. Here is a light powerful
'â¢â¢â¢ enough to test the theories of the experts who have claimed that the possibilities
â¢.â¢ of the X ray are only limited by the degree of development.
Electricians who are studying the X ray problem in different cities of the
â  United States arc discussing the advisability of inviting Professor Trowbridge to
' â¢ carry out various proposed tests of the powers of the ray, with a view of settling
' forever the disputed question as to the effect of a tremendous increase of the pene
trating power. Mr. Edison is authority for the statement that the construction of
this machine can best be likened to the dawning of a new day In the world of
electricity.

Shelburne for some reason or other, he decided that he would make some sort of
a present to the place, and as a result presented the town authorities with the
machine.
That was in 1793, a little more than 100 years ago. and the people of Shelburne
thought themselves very fortunate indeed to become possessors or so modern an
aid in the fighting of flames. It was very handsomely painted, well built, of lasting
material, and for a long time it was the town's chief protection from fire. As the
>ears went on, however, genius began to produce fire-fighting apparatus that left
the poor old machine far away in the rear.
They are not quick to change nor to forget the old loves in Nova Scotia, but
about half a century ago it was decided that King George's gift was a trifle too an
cient, and that the safety of the townpeople demanded a more modern fire ma
chine. Like the famous old engine dov.n at Asbury Park, N. J., which Founder
Bradley bought for the little ones of the place, the old fire machine, when mus
tered out. became the plaything of the boys of Shelburneâ and their sisters, too,
for that matter.
It continued to serve this purpose for a number of years, but finally it was dis
mantled, the tub filled with earth and placed in the front yard of a resident of
Shelburne. where it served as a flower garden. For a very long time the flowers
grew thriftily in it during the summer, and the bulbs nestled close to the old
oaken surface during the winter months. At last, however, relic hunters dis
covered it, learned its history, withdrew it from mother earth's bosom, restored it
to fully as good a condition as it exhibited the day that his Britannic Â±
majesty bestowed it as an evidence of his good will upon the people of Shelburne/
and turned it over to the officials of the town, to be placed where every one could
see just how fire was fought in "ye olden time."
A glance at the ancient machine, as shown in the accompanying illustration,
gives the best opportunity for comparison between the old and new method* of
fighting lire that has been offered iv a long while

âapple sauce and cranberry sauce.
They, too, are kept warm by steam.
There is a steambox for steaming oys
ters; a grill big enough to broil a pig
or a lamb, under which glows a fire
of red hot charcoal; and a patent tur
key roaster, which performs mechani
cally the turning and basting of the
bird, which, in the bid days, absorbed
the time and attention of two or three
persons. There are steam tables in
the kitchen, as well as in the steam
room. It takes thirty servants to run
the kitchen and its appurtenances. The
head cook has a half dozen assistants.
There are two pastry cooks, and the
rare quality of their product is due in
large measure to the supervision of
Mrs. Tape, a New England woman,
whose ideas of pie are exalted, if one
may judge by the results of her cook
ing.
The nearest approach of the public to
a knowledge of the kitchen arrange
ments of th Senate is when one of the
three nimble attendants behind the
luncheon counter of the restaurant
shouts an order downstairs, <>r a paper
B jip | S Â»ing down on one of the
two dumb waiters. Everything which
reaches th dining room comes up in
one "f those dumb waiters. They are
kept going almost without ceasing
from noon to 3 o'clock every day.
"Noon to 'â '> o'clock" explains the pe
culiarity which is probably responsi
ble for the alleged unprofitableness of
Senate restaurant. There is no
. :.ist hour worth speaking of, and
hour. Very few persons eat
anything but luncheon at the Capitol.
The Senators breakfast at home and
dine at home; and besides they are not
the best patrons of the restaurant. Th>;
public breakfasts at a hotel and dines
at a hotel or a restaurant downtown.
Yet the Senate restaurant has to keep
as large a force of cooks and sculho:..-;
and waiters as though business con
tinued brisk through the whole day.
There are many frequenters of the
pie counter among the Senators. This
counter surrounds the dumb waiters,
ami is decorated with cold turkeys,
cold roast beef and salads, as well as
many kinds of pie. There are no seats
of any kind; you plant your chest or
your stomach â according to your
heightâ against the cold marble, and
one of the three colored attendants
hands out what you want. It is a
common sight for two or three Sena
tors to be standing at this counter,
with Senate pages and committee
clerks and messengers and Washing
ton correspondents on each side of
them, drinking big tumblers of milk
and eating pie. of this pie I have al
ready Bpoken, so it is not necessary to
explain why these Senators are there.
This and the oyster counter are in
the public restaurantâ a room divided
into two parts by large columns. Two
small doorways, one at each end of the
pie counter, lead to the rooms which
are sacred to "Senators only." These
rooms were once <.p-n to members of
the House, but the Senators complain
ed of the lack of privacy, and now if
you enter the inner sanctum it must be
as a guest of a member of the Senate.

the surroundings no more attractive

whole family at once.
BOYS WITH BIG BRAINS
A short time ag>> attention was di
i to a. b>y In Berlin who, al
th'iiich "iily two years old, could read
in a limst surprising manner. He had
commenced reading when a baby, and
Improved his education by spelling out
the si^ns, etc., while being wheeled
nl' ut the Streets in his baby car
riage. The "learned child of Lubeck"
was another of these precocious in
fants, but he is credited with having
such extraordinary talents that one
can almost be forgiven for doubting
the veracity of the chronicler.
The son of a Hungarian officer also
made very rapid strides in learning,
and when two years and five months
old was considered qualified for the
second form of the principal national
school at his native place. When just
under four he was the most proficient
of the pupils in reading the German,
Hungarian and Latin languages; and
he even made more startling progress
in music.
Tasso was another smart child, , for
he spoke plainly, it is said, when only
six months old. When seven years
old he understood Latin and Greek,
and even composed verses, and before
he was 12, when studying law, he had
completed his course of rhetoric,
poetry, logic and ethics.
Lopez de Vega was also fortunate
when a boy. At five he could read
Latin and Spanish fluently, and at 12
he was master of the Latin tongue
and of rhetoric, while at 15 he had
written several pastorals and a com
edy. He is stated to have produced
about ISOO comedies during his life, so
perhaps it was necessary to begin
when very young. Grotius was an
other good poet at the age of 8; at 15
accomplished in philosophy, mathe
matics and jurisprudence, and at 24
he was appointed advocate general of
Rotterdam.
Barretier at the age of nine was
masteT of five languages, while in his
eleventh year he made a translation
from the Hebrew to the French and
added notes such as would be ex
pected from a man of considerable
erudition. Gustavus Vasa was an
other boy of excellent brain power,
for at the age of 12 he was able to
speak and write Latin, French, Ger
man, Italian, Dutch and Swedish, and.
he also understood Polish and Rus
sian.
A large number of boys arc fond of
mathematics, but few make such ra
pid progress as did Lewis Ferrara.
When eighteen he was appointed a tu
tor in arithmetic, and he was then so
well versed in his trade that he was
able to hold his own in arguments with
the most learned mathematician of
the age. "When a boy in school he
had distinguished himself in the same
line. Pascal, at twelve, had complete
ly mastered Euclid's Elements without
any assistance, and- at sixteen he pub
lished a work on Conic Sections, which
Descartes was reluctant to believe had
been produced by a boy.
A French boy of five also showed up
so well in Latin, history, geography,
mathematics, etc., that the Academy of
Montpelier granted him "a most hon
orable certificate." The "Great Conde"
was another boy with brains, and he
made good use of them.* At eight he
understood Latin, and at eleven he
wrote a treatise on rhetoric. Three
years later he was thoroughly conver
sant with all military exercises.
In the world of music, too, we find
many instances of boys giving an ear
ly indication of a remarkable career.
Handel and Mozart each showed a lik
ing for music when young in years,
and soon made their mark. Handel
began composing a church service for
voices and instruments when only nine
years old, and before he was fifteen he
had composed three operas.
Mozart began the piano at three,
and at seven he taught himself the
violin. At nine years of age he visited
England, and when departing gave a
farewell concert at which all the sym
phonies were composed by himself. A
year or two ago attention was drawn
to a little Polish boy, who, at eight
years of age, could play from memory
no fewer than fourteen pieces from
such composers as Mozart, Bach, Cho
pin, Rubinstein and others.
Some remarkable preachers have also
started very early. The Abbe de
Ranee was a splendid Greek scholar
at twelve, and shortly afterwards was
appointed to an important benefice.
Bossuet preached before a brilliant
Parisian assembly at the age of fif
teen; and Fenelon. who afterwards be
came an archbishop, also preached an
extraordinary sermon at the same age.

WHIST
Dummy whist ;s seldom played nowa
days. The only code of Laws governing
this rtyle of game were framed by the
late John Loraine Baldwin in May. 1863.
They an- a part of what is called in this
country the English code of laws, found
in "Cavendish." When Dummy's hand
is dealt it is spread out face up on the
table before any card is played. Whether
he is the dealer or leader it makes no dif
ference; the hand must be spread out.
The Question has arisen. Should the
Dummy lead before exposing his hand?
Or, should Dummy be the dealer, should
the lead be made before seeing Dummy's
cards? The answer to all this is. No.!
Tlie Dummy's hand should be immedi
ately turned face np as soon as dealt and
played from In that way at any stage of
the game.
Philadelphia Versus Boston.
Some four weeks or so ago the Ameri
can Whist League challenge trophy was
played in Boston between the Philadel
phia Whist Club, represented by Mr. Mil
ton C. Work. E. A. Ballard, E. P. Mo
gridge. W. H. Watsonâ three of the old
Hamilton Club team, and the American
Whist Club, represented by their regular
four.
Milton C. Work, in a very interesting
comment on the play in the X. w York
Mail and Express, after speaking of the
slight difference ii. tic leads, says:
"There was one other slight innovation
Introduced by the Philadelphlans. They
used the rotary discard when unable to
follow suit on a trump lead made by the
partner, no other suit having been led.
"During the past few months I have
experimented to some extent with this
play, and while my experience is not as
yet sufficiently extensive to justify me
in urging it too strongly upon my read
ers, yet I can say that so far I have seen
it win quite a number of tricks without
having a loss scored against il: that 1

decided gainer, ;!â¢!<! before we are much
older will be accepted as conventional.
"Of course, it must be und. rstood that
I am referring to the adoption of the
rotary discard only when the partner has
opened trump as tin initial bad of the
hand, and no other suit has been led.
If a plain suit has been led, even for but
on^ round. I believe the use of the rotary
is unnecessary, as .< discard from weak
will point the strong suit just as
accurately, and it? extension beyond the
limit given seems to me sure to entail
confusion, misundi rstandings and loss."
The Rotary Discard
Hilton c. VVork in his whist writings
is usually magnanimous enough t<> give
credit to whom credit is due. In an
other part of his article he refers to the
rotary discard as an "old scheme." We
will state for the information of the
whist public that this new idea in dis
carding was first presented to the whist
world through the columns of Whist in

The stately bird here shown well main
tains its ancient and familiar tradi
tions. The long, graceful neck comes
back in sinuous curves that the plu
mage may be preened and pecked, and
the stiff little tail waggles in pleasur
able anticipation as the swan dives
beneath the surface of the supposed
lake. Finally, the bird sails out of the
di?k by the simple process of the shad
owgraphist inclining himself gradually
forward.
Illustrations represent respectively
Mr. Gladstone and Lord Salisbury. The
conservative leader looks somewhat
cynical, while the immortal Hermit <>f
Hawarden has a firm, purposeful ap
pearance As a matter of fact. M.
Trewey made his notes and sketches
for this portrait during Gladstone's
last speech in the Houseâ the Impaa
sirr.ed attack on the House of Lords.
Talking of these transforming 'fin
ger photos." there is a certain appro
priatenesa in the G. O. M. swiftly giv
ing place to I,ord Salisbury. Only, in
this case, one can see at a glance bow
it is all done; there is no diplomatic
concealment, every movement being
visible. Occasionally some little arti
cle or "property" is required to com
plete a portrait. In the case of the
Queen the artist s fingers are so taxed
to Com thf h^ad and face that there
are none left for the necessary crown,
therefore thf> regal emblem has to be
portrayed by means of a piece of cut
cardboard. In the Gladstone portrait,
the only "property" necessary is some
thing which will, indicate the peak of
ih" familiar collar, strange as it may
sound. Lord Salisbury figures without

ingenious fashion by the fingers of one
hand extended downward.
But the world is full of change, and
another turn of the artist's hand car
ries us away to femininity and vanity.
Consider for a moment another figure
which depicts a young person of little
refinement immersed in the mysteries
of the toilet. The properties here used
are: First, a piece of cut cardboard on
which coarse wool has been fastened:
second, a few hairpins; third, a pair of
curling tonys. and fourth, another piece
of cardboard which casts the shadow
of the mirror of a dressing table. The
lady's face and somewhat spare neck
are formed by the hands of the shad
owtrraphist. The pantomime gone
through is ama2ingly effective. The
lady is very much in earnest; evidently
it is a toilet with a purpose.
The hair is gradually curled, the
hairpins placed in position one by one.
so as to support an artificial dab of
wool, which represents, as we believe,
a "bun" unknown to confectioners.
Of course after you have once learned
the trick it is easy to invent figures of
your own; then you can create all sorts
of fun for your guests.
STORIES TOLD BY
STUART ROBSON
Stuart Robson. the comedian, is an
accomplished talker. Ho seasons his
talk with so many interesting reminis
cences that he is one of the pleasantest
companions <>n the American stage.
Speaking of the improved methods of
producing plays. Mr. Robeon gave
credit to Henry Irving as the foremost
educator of the public in that direction.
"There is no man for whom I have
a higher admiration," said he. "I re
member some years ago being at the
principal hotel in New Orleans. The
corridor was crowded with people,
when suddenly there entered a man
veil advanced in years, who wore a
long, old-fashioned cloak. Suddenly
every one present ranged along the
walls of the passage, and as the old
gentleman passed up every hat was
doffed and every head bowed. I knew
at once that it was that idol of the
Southerners, Jeff Davis. Only once
since have I seen any parallel to that:
It was in London, when I saw a tall,
thin figure walking along the Strand
with a peculiar springy stride. 1 saw
old men raise their hats and draw aside
to let him pass, and I felt proud myself,
for this reverence was paid to Henry
Irving as an actor â and I am an actor,
too."
"The recent outpouring of Grant
anecdotes," said Mr. Kobson. "has re
minded me of one which I do not think

years ago in a well-known manager's
j theater, out of New York. The first
act was over and we were chatting in
th> wings with our manager, when one
of the boys rushed in on the stage to
tell us that General Grant and his fam
ily were in one of the boxes. A flush
: of gratified pride mounted to the man
agerial face, followed by a look of
agonized doubt as he evidently reflect
i ed that perhaps the General had 'dead

him a box, Robson?' he asked me, and
on my replying in the negative, he pull
ied out a card from his pocket, and
} scribbling a line on it, told the boy to i
take it to the box office, and bring back
.an answer. The boy rushed off, his
head full of the General, and returned"
I in a few minutes with the same card,
which he handed to Mr. Manager. A
ghastly look crossed his dace as he*
read it, and without a word handed it
to me. The first line read in the rather
shaky managerial cattgraphy, 'DM

underneath appeared, 'No, but my son

"I have always found that a cosmo
politan people influence each other in
behalf of schools. The Germans, in
particular, are very jealous of their
privileges in the public schools, and
they place a very high estimate upon
the value of good teaching. But of
course there is always room for im
provement everywhere.
The following report on manual
training in the schools of Santa Bar
bara was read during the session of
the Round Table in the department of
manual training, over which James K.
Addicott of the San Jose Normal
School presided:
"Those who have read the report of
'Manual Training in Santa Barbara'
as it was presented at the Round
Table in 1896 during the meeting of the
State Teachers Association at San
Jose will remember that Miss Blake,
the generous woman who founded this
work six years ago, was still main
taining the school, with a very little
assistance from the public school
funds, although manual training was
virtually a part of the public school
system.
"11l health necessitating Miss Blakels
release from the responsibilities occa
sioned by her ownership of the school, !
a formal proposition was made by her I
throvgh the board of trustees that the j
running expenses of the school, in- |
eluding the salaries of two of th-
teachers, be assumed by the city â Miss
I.lake agreeing to be responsible for j
the salary of the principal, whom she
named for the ensuing two years. At
the expiration of this time she prom
ises to deed to the city the lot, the man

: ual training building and equipment,
valued at about $12,000, while she im-
I posed the condition that the same shall
I be used Solely lor manual training.
"The vote for the special tax of
$3000 for this purpose was carried al
most unanimously, and the people of
Santa Barbara (eel that manual train
ing, which has hitherto proved itself
BO valuable, is now a necessary and
firmly established institution. The
children, at all times full of interest,
now accept this work as their right,
: and the matter of attendance is never
questioned. Their fondness for the
work leads them to put forth their
best efforts, and rank in manual train
ing is included with their other studies
in the term's average.
"All the grade teachers, having
found manual training so great an aid
in their various fields, act in hearty
CO-operatlon with this 'special work,'
thus sweeping away the oft-repeated
objection that there is no time for this
i t.
"Working toward the end that there
shall be no break between the kinder
n and the higher grades, wh. re
manual training usually first iinds a
place, one Btep la advance has been
taken this year by the* introduction of
this work into the fifth grade. Then
are Simple models in the sewing
course for the girls, and for the hoys
the Sloy.l coarse in drawing, as well as
woodwork, arranged by Oustaf Larson
of the Stoyd Training School, Boston.
Owing to the number of classes to be
accommodated it is possible to give
the fifth-grade pupils only a one-hour
period weekly Inntoati of two hours, as
in th<- other grades, but the experiment
is proving most satisfactory.
"The present arrangement provides
for the girls" instruction in sewing dur
ing three school years â the fifth, sixth
and seventh grades â and in cooking
two years â in the eighth and ninth
gradesâ with Miss Etta P. Flagg In
charge of both departments. The
boys, beginning with the fifth grade.
hayÂ»- four consecutive years of training
in Sloyd, with the privilege of return
ing the fifth year if for any good rea
son they have been unable to complete
the course. The series of models
taught by Mr. Larson are adopted in
the course.
In addition to the public school work
there is a class in sloyd from the pri
vate schools paying tuition. Occa
sionally when opportunity affords
eighth grade and high school pirls art
admitted to the sloyd classes, three

"Four years apo," said Superintend
ent Job Wood of Monterey County. >.Â»â 
, adopted in our districts a set of
books for each grade of pupils to
choose from and take BOOK t<>
read. In doing this we at first sent
<>ut a large list of suitable books for
the tear hers to experiment with, and
later we had reports from various sec
tions at the next County Institute.
Then the books that the children
didn't like were rejected, and the list
of forty-five different books were scat
tered through the grades of the pri
mary and grammar school*. It was
only last year that we completed this
list and placed it in the course of study
throughout the county. In each grade,
beginning with the second, there were
eight or nine books for the children to
read at home, and later they were ex
amined on their reading by the teach
ers and marked accordingly. The
children have taken great interest in
the plan, and at the institute meeting
last fall it was reported that over 9000
books had been read during the whole
time by the various grades.
"It was satisfactorily proven that
children do enjoy standard literature
as much as adults. Scott, Dickens and
George Eliot were the favorite authors
in the grammar grades. In the pri
mary grades there is displayed a fond
ness for fairy tales, mythical lore and
stories of adventure.
"Our experience has shown conclu
sively that school children do appreci
ate a higher grade of literature than is
commonly supposed.

MINES AND MINING
Nevada County is taking hold of the
mining exposition in â  way that will
enable it to make the most of the un
paralleled opportunity to advertise its
mineral resources. The committee has
asked for 2""0 square feet of space and
will put in a magnificent and attractive
exhibit.
It will go further, however, and super
intend its own exhibit. There will be
constantly with the exhibit a competent
miner and geologist familiar with every
phase of the industry in the county, who
will be ready to cive any Interested in
quirer practical or scientific information
that m;iy he wanted. This is an exam
ple that every county should follow.
Each county exhibit should have as great
a display as possible of striking, curious
and otherwise Interesting things that will
attract popular attention. A small pro
portion Of the Visitors to the fair will
lif wise about mining, but it is not chiefly
to mining men that the exhibits should
appeal. Thousands who Know little or
nothing about mining are investing in
mines, or wanting 1 to do so. The end to
be reached is a popular understanding
of the greatness and possibilities of the
region. To ninety-nine out of a hundred
an immense block of low-grade ore will
be more effective as an advertisement
than a whole cabinet of small specimens
that would interest a mineralogist. Rel-
Ics, pit tares, collections, maps, graphic
illustYations of the total production of
a county and some of us gnat mines and
so on will make suck an exhibit a center
of attraction. A Complete and varied
collection illustrating the county's re
sources to mining nun. judicious descrip
tive information for distribution and an
Intelligent somebody to answer questions
wili help make up the most effective
agency within the reach of any mining
region to make known its wealth aim
â¢ i its development. Hundreds of
prospectors and thousands of investors
and others will in the future turn their
attention in new directions through what
they learn during the live weeks 01 the
mining fair.
At this time the pmsj ts are that at
least seven or eight counties will make
extensive and worthy saining displays.
but there should lie twenty of them A
great exhibit from Nevada County is as
sured, and most of the greal mines of
Grass Valley and Nevada City are ar
ranging to contribute ore><. The Califor
nia Exploration Company is actively
leading the enterprise in Calaveras
County, and with the co-opi ration of the
, miners gen. 'rally, promises one of the
most interesting displays that will be
made At a meeting in Auburn to-mor
row the participation of i'lucer County
will be considered, and the Supervisors
will be asked to appropriate $^00. The
newspapers of Biskiyou County are vig
orously agitating the proposition, and
Siskiyou will probably be In line. In
Hlumns the Supervisors have been asked
for $."-Â»'â  Amador. Xl 1> ...ad0. Tuol untie,
Kern. Uuttc ami Shasta promise exhibits,
but the prospects are somewhat indell
llite.
There Is gratifying and widespread Inter
est in the fair all over the State, but a
little more vim and organization seems
to be called for throughout the interior.
\ great many of the leading miners are
making daily inquiry at headquarters
and an cordially offering ores and col
lections. Jefferson Doolittle of Gold Run
offers to ship all the granite wanted for
the hydraulic mining apparatus, and
many "of the leading mine-owners have
offered large displays of rich ores if their
safety is assured. Perfect arrangeaaents
have'been made by Superintendent K. 11.
imin for the protection of all val
uable ores and nuggets, which will be
constantly guarded and locked in
at night." There is no doubt that there
will be a larger and richer collection of
gold ores at the fair than was ever gath
ered together at a similar display.
One of the important features of the
fair will be a State miners' day. with
addresses by eminent mining men and
others.

has been a greatly Increased turning to
the oil fields, and State Mineralogist A.
S. Cooper measures the increase of activ
ity as three times that of any year in
the past. The production for the year
will probably not show the amount of
prospecting for oil, the Investment in oil
lands and the preparation for develop
ment work are undoubtedly three times
w hat they were a year ago.
The oil bearing formations of the State
are distributed over practically the en
tin Coast Range and the development has
been but comparatively slight. There is
no doubt that there are fields as rich as
those of Los Angeles, Summerland and
Ventura County awaiting discovery or
that this State is destined to become X C
ond in oil production. The most notable
development of the year has been In the
Western part of Fresno County, where
good wells have been sunk and where
about 300 locations of oil claims have
made. The recent decision of the
S. . retary of the Interior restoring oil
to the list of mineral products governed
by the Federal mining law will do a
great deal for the industry. Field As
sistant W. I*. Watts has spent the entire
season in Southern California, where he
is unable to meet the crowding demands
for his expert opinions from people who
are prospecting properties. The discov
eries in Fresno County have helped stim
ulate the search in the counties south
of the bay, in all of which oil indications
are frequent, but in which production is
yet next to nothing. A number of wells
have been driven in the region of Half
moon Hay with encouraging results, and
prospecting is going on in Santa Cruz,
Monterey and San Benlto Counties. Last
week J. H. Means of the State Mining
Bureau went down to Sargents, in Santa
Clara County, to make some studies of
structural geology there for the benefit
of the Watson ville Oil Company. This
company has recently been prospecting
for oil in that corner of Santa Clara
County, and has driven two wells of
aboul 800 feet, finding a little oil. Now.
in accordance with Mr. Means' advice,
a well of 1200 feet will be driven in another
location. This is one of the many re
gions in which oil seepages are plenty
but in which no prospecting has ever
been done. It is likely that during the
year extensive prospecting will be
pushed ahead in Contra Costa County
and other places In the bay region rich
in indications but wholly undeveloped.
EARLY GUESSING THAT COLORA-
DO'S GOLD PRODUCT MAY BE
THE BIGGEST.
According to press dispatches Director
of the Mint Preston predicts that Colo
rado will lead California in gold produc
tion for WK, and that for the first time
in its history California will take second
place. It is expected that Colorado's
yield will be about 120,000,000, and Cali
fornia's somewhat less.
It may or may not turn out this way,
but it is much too early for anything
but the usual newspaper claims made
with big figures. Colorado will show a
\ cry large increase in its product, which
was about jia.ooo.ooo in isms, but its in
crease will be almost Wholly due to the
activity and development of one c;im|t
<'ripple Creek. The development of Crip
ple Creek mines and chiefly the working
Â«.f their low-grade ores by the aid of
improved processes, cheaper transporta
tion and Increased smelting capacity have
run the monthly product of this district
up to $1,000,000. the figures reached in No
vember and December. This is at the
rat" of Jl2.oOo.imX* a year, and it may be
increased dining 1866, for the ore produc
tion is now in excess of the capacity of
railroads and smelters to handle it.
California is not jealous of Colorado
because of the hitter's great Cripple
Creek, and will take it philosophically if
Colorado goes to the head of the cUUU
for one year. The increase of produc
tion in this State does not come from one
mining camp, or from a dozen only. It
comes, and will continue to come from
. very county in a rich gold-producing
region stretching continuously for a thou
sand miles.
Here new stamp mills are going up
everywhere from the Klamath to the
Colorado, thousands of prospectors are
scattered over mountain and desert from
Siskiyou to San Diego, and investments
and discoveries are as widespread, all of
which shows the room and the oppor
tunity the gold miner finds in California.
The immense amount of development
work which has been going on in the past
year <>r two all over the State will not
greatly increase the total output for an
other year or two. but the boom which
the industry is having promises a future
Increase of several million dollars from
present operations alone. The sjo.ooo.ihjo
mark is not very far ahead for Cali
fornia, and there is no dur.ger of its long
remaining in second place if it should
be placed there this year. The total out
put of this State for UH has been much
reduced by a scarcity of water in some
of the mother lode districts, where many
large mills were shut down for several
weeks for want of power. It is likely that
the product will exceed $18,000,000, and
may approach $20,000,000.
NOTES FROM THE FIELD.
Julian Sonntag. secretary of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, has received
from \V. S. Adams, editor of the Jerome
(Ariz.) Mining News, a request for the
constitution, reports, etc., of the associa
tion, and the information that an effort
is Ihmhk made to organize a similar asso
. in t ion for Arizona.

sociation have been received . from the
printers by Secretary- Julian Sbnntag who
has 1000 copies for free, distribution. The
pamphlet contains 185 pages, and f gives
the proceedings of the recent convention
in full. The report ..will interest any
California- miner. The committee re
ports, the addresses by President Neff
and others are given in full together with
the discussions.
There also appears in full the report
of "W. S. Keyes-of the committee of the
international gold mining convention on
the revision of the Federal mining laws.
Mr. Keyes' vigorous paper has already
caused considerable discussion and much â¢
hostile criticism, chiefly because of the
recommendation that the apex or ex
tralateral right law be done away with. â 
There is little prospect of any important
mining legislation proceeding from the â¢
present ' Congress. During the coming r '
year there will be extensive discussion
of mining-law revision. and something in
that line may be accomplished two or
three years hence.
The following spicy comment of the
Bodie Miner-Index might be applied with
slight changing to the average newspa
per report of a "rich strike" of ore run
ning "a thousand dolu-.rs to the ton,"
which is the usual figure:
"Louis Williams' White Mountain ven
ture was a monumental fizzle, as wÂ«
predicted. There was but a. narrow;
thread of ore, and that was on other
ground. It is singular how men Â«yn lie
about small things. The ore exhibited
here was worth at least $5000 per ton,
and the enthusiastic promoter assured
us that he had "two feet of it.' As Mr.
Williams describes the layout it would
be necessary to sink a thousand feet,
drift to Salt Lake and stope to the moon
to get a ton of ore."
It is authoritatively stated that the
big forty-stamp mill will be constructed
at Barstow and will be in operation dur
ing the winter. It is understood that
the railroad company has promised a.
tariff of $1 a ton on all ores from any
point within the district. This is giving"
an impetus to work all through that sec
tion. â San Bernardino Free Press.

â that would test him, that would be the

.There was no time to lose. While he
...'hung there a musket shot could pick
him off from below, and there was no
.telHng how <-oon his desertion would be
discovered. He hoped it would not be till
â  -morning. He started again. This was j
travail indeed. His rough fingers, his
toes, which were u\w st like horn, began
-to bleed. Once ct twice he swung quite I
clear of the wall, hanging by his fingers |
to catch a surer foothold to right or left,
and just getting it by an inch, or less, ,
sometimes. The strain and tension [
were terrible. His head appeared I
to swell and fill with blood; on !
. :tpp it hurt him so much that it j
: ;: seeroed to him it must burst. His neck
. -was aching horribly with the constant |
â¢ looking up, the skin of his knees was |
â ' gone, his ankles were bruised. But he I
must keep on till he got to the top, or
: until he fell.
â¢" â¢ He was fighting on in a kind of dream,
â¢: -which was quite apart from all usual
.'.feelings of this world. The earth itself
â '." seemed far away, and he was toiling
amfltig vastnesses, himself a giant with
':! immense frame and huge sprawling
limbs. It was like the dreams which '
:come in sleep, when the body is an elu
sive,' stupendous mass that falls into
-space after a confused struggle with im
rnen.sities. It was all mechanical, vague, ,
â almost numb â this effort to overcome a I
. mountain. Yet it was precise and hugely i
Expert, too; for though there was a
/â¢.'strange mist on the brain, the body felt
its;. way with a singular certainty, as :
â  ijiig-ht some molluscan dweller of the sea,
which is sensitive like a plant with in
. tuitipn like an animal. Yet sometimes it
seemed that this vast body overcoming .
thÂ« mountain would let go its hold and '
.slide away into the darkness of the !
depths. There was a strange, convulsive ;
.<hiver in every nerve.
..- : Gqd have mercy, the time was come
now !
â  .No, not yet. At the very instant when
'it seemed this panting flesh and blood I
would be shaken off by the granite force j
â¢repelling it, the fingers like great an
tennae touched horns of rock, jutting out !
from ledges, on the third escarpment of I
the' wall. Here was the last point of the !
â â¢second and worst stage of the journey.
Slowly, heavily the bofljr drew up to the j
' shelf of limestone, and crouched in an I
inert bundle. There it lay for a long !
time.
While the long minutes went by. a j
â¢voice kept calling up from belowâ call- |
ing, calling at fir.st eagerly, then anxi- j
ously, then with terror. By and by the
bundle of life stirred, took shape, raised J
perms of typhoid fever from the refuse
at the poap factories and packing
houses Into th-2 homes 'of the people of
San Francisco.
True, theie has been no epidemic of
â  such malady in the city, but just
: think what might occur in the future.
; When the fearful epidemic of Glasgow
â  is remembered, where hundreds died
j from typhoid fever contracted through
eating oysters, and when it is recalled
that Honolulu was almost depopulated
with cholera which started from eat
ing crabs, then will the work of Dr.
! Dockery be appreciated. It is not pres
i ent evils that are to be guarded against,
j but those that we know not of.
But there is a gleam of hope piercing
the cloud of gloom which now threat
ens the gourmets. There is but one
society of shrimps that is to be ta
booed. The crustaceans of the San
Bruno road have been designated as
"mushy." That ought to settle the
whole matter. A "mushy" shrimp has
no rights that a health officer is bound
to respect. They are not only mushy,
but they are also "white." Now a
white shrimp is something that in it
s.-li" carries its own condemnation.
When it is both white and mushy it
naturally follows that if it hasn't con
tracted disease the health officer is not
to blame for it.
Hereafter the crustaceans of San
Pablo Bay will have the proud dis
tinction of being the elite of shrimp so
ciety and the only ones that art- of
sufficient tone to mix in the midst "f
humanity. Just how the unwary
housewife is to know whether the
shrimps offered from the basket of the
peripatetic vendor really come from
the hallowed precincts of San Pablo or
from the condemned purlieus of Eftta
Bruno swamps is a question that has
not yet been definitely decided. Possi
bly ihe Health Department will utilize
Dr. Jordan** seal brand idea, and then
none but branded shrimps will be con
sidered as tit for polite society.
Dr. Morse of the Board of Health is
a gentleman of recognized erudition
and profound thought, and since he
coincides with the opinion of his learn
ed colleagues across the Atlantic
much consideration will be given to
th<> grave danger that has so long
threatened the citizens who tat
shrimps. Since the whole medical fra
ternity is a unit in this matter, and
Bay that germs of disease can be and
are carried by crustaceans as well as
mammals, it might be well if th"s
who are fond of the enticing salad
were to see to it that their shrimps
arc neither "white" nor "mushy."
ORPHANS MADE HAPPY.
The Inmates of the Maria K'P
Orphanage Had a Week, of Joy
ar)d Good Cheer.
Sister Anna, the matron of the Maria
Kip Orphanage out in the Richmond,
had a busy week of it with her little
totn. The hundred inmates, who look
upon the good Sister Anna as
their mother and their aH, were treat
ed to the usual Christmas dinner and
tree with its load of offerings in the
evening. As this was the first Christ
mas in the new home, the good Sister
Anna and her assistants almost outdid
themselves in making this festival an
impressive one on the minds of their
young wards. In this they were mrt
unappreciated as the innocent little
ones were filled with joy and gratitude
as they beheld an overloaded table
containing all the good things that can
be produced in California for a Christ
mas festival. This, with a kind and
maternal feeling on the part of the
gentle matron toward her innocent
little charges filled their baby hearts
full of thanks for Christmas and what
it brings to the Christian world.
The week following Christmas was
one long to be remembered by the in
mates of the Maria Kip Orphanage,
as they had been invited to the chutes,
to Sutro's, to the Cliff, to the park, and
itself, and was changed into a man
again, a thinking, conscious being, who
now understood the meaning of this
sound coming up from the carth â or was
it the sea?â below. It was a human
voice which had at last pierced the awful
exhaustion, the deadly labor, the peri!
and strife which had numbed the brain
of a man. while the body in its instinct
for existence still clung to the rocky
ledges. It had called the man back to
earthâ he was no longer a great animal.
and the rock a monster with skin and
scales of stone.
"Antoine! Antoine! Ah, Antoine!"
called the voice.
Now he knew. He answered down:
"All right! All right. Minois:"
"Are you at the top?"
"No. but the rest is easy."
"Hurry, hurry. Antoine: If they should
come before you reach the top!"
"I'll soon be there. Ah, but Minois, it
was awful!"
"Are you hurt, Antoine?"
"No, but my fingers are in rags. I am
going now, a bi'tot!"
"Antoine!"
" 'Sh! do not speak. I am starting."
There was a silence for what seemed
hours to the girl below. Foot by foot the
man climbed on, no less cautious be
cause the ascent was easier, for he had
become weaker. But he was on the
monster's neck now, and soon he should
set his heel on it â he was not to be
shaken off.
At last the victorious moment came.
Over a jutting ledge he drew himself up
by sheer strength and the rubber-like
grip of his lacerated fingers, body, legs,
knees, and now he lay flat and breathless
upon the ground.
How soft and cool it was! This was
long, sweet grass that touched his face,
which made a couch like down for the
battered, wearied body. Surely this
travail had been almost more than
mortal. And what was this vast flutter
ing over his head, this million-voiced
discord round him, like the buffetings
and cries of spirits who welcome another
to their torment? He raised his head
and laughed in triumph. These were the
cormorants, gulls and gannets on the
Perce Rock.
Antoine Robichon had done what man
had never done before him; he had done
it in the night, with only the moon to
lighten the monstrous labor of his in
credible adventure; he had accomplished
it without help of any mortal sort.
Legions of birds circled over him with
wild cries, so shrill and scolding that at
first he did not hear Minois' voice calling
up to him. At last, however, remember
ing, he leaned over the cliff and saw her
standing in the moonlight far below.
Her voice came up to him indistinctly
because of the clatter of the birdsâ"An
toine, Antoine!" She could not see him,
for this part of the rock was in shadow.
"Ah, ba, all right," he said, and tak
ing hold of one end of the twine he haÂ«l
brought, he let the roll fall. It dropped
almost at Minois' feet. Bho fastened the
rope she had got at the post to the end
of it, and called to Antoine. He drew it
up quickly. She had found no rope long
enough, so she had tied three together.
Antoine must splice them perfectly. Once
morf he let down the twine, and she
fastened it to his blanket. It was a
heavy strain on the twine, hut the
blanket and the food inclosed were got
M}> safely. She called for him to lower
again, and this time he hauled up to
bacco, tea, matches, needles, cotton, a
knife and a horn of rum. Now she called
for him to splice the ropes properly.
There was no time to do that, but he
tied them firmly together and let the
great coll down. This time was drawn
up a musket and ammunition and an
other blanket. Again it was let down,
and he dr#w up a crowbar, a handspike
and som? tin dishes, which rattled
against the side of the great rock de
risively. Again the rope went down, and
two bundles of sticks and faggots were
attached, with flint and steel, also a
small roll of coarse cotton and a bear
skin. Last of all came a small tent and
a bundle of woman's clothes.

A CONSUMPTIVE`S DESPAIR.
George O'Neil Ends Mis Life With a
Pistol Bullet.
"With the dread fangs of consumption
fastened upon him, George O'Neil, a
letter carrier, residing at 140 Sanchez
street, yesterday afternoon ended his
life with a pistol bullet.
o'Xeil has been suffering with con
sumption for a long time and as he
felt his life slowly ebbing away he
grew more and more despondent. Yes
terday afternoon he was alone in his
room, and at about 1 o'clock his sister
was startled by hearing a pistol shot
in the house. Suspecting what had
happened, she at once rushed into his
room and found him seated in a chair
in front of a looking-glass with a
smoking revolver in his hand. Dr.
Barnham was immediately summoned
but found the man past mortal aid,
and at once notified the Coroner.
Deputy Coroner J. LÂ«. McCormack
visited the house, but seeing that the
case was clearly suicide, did not re
move the body.
O'Neil was 28 years of age and un
married. He was well known in the
city and highly respected by all his
friends.
SANG IN AID OF
THE SUFFERERS
Children's Hospital Benefit at
the Tivoli a Pronounced
Success.
N early One Thousand Dollars Real
izedâKindness of Mrs. Kreling
and the Opera Company.
The Children's Hospital will profit
nearly $1000 as a result of the benefit
performance of "M<*her Goose" given
: day by the Tivoli Opera Com
pany at the well-known place of
amusement.
Recognizing the difficulties under
which charitable institutions often
labor to procure funds sufficient to
carry them along. Mrs. Ernestine Krel
ing, the proprietress of the Tivoli, re
cently consulted the members of her
company and as a result the benefit
was arranged, the singers entering
thoroughly into the spirit of the affair
and making every effort to render the
affair s success, artistically as well as
financially.
The public was more than usually
generous in its patronage and the big
opera house was full. The entire re
ceipts, including the income from the
flower and programme privileges, went
into the benefit fund, the result being
a donation of $973 to the hospital fund.
Treasurer Krause will forward a check
for that amount to the officials of the
institution to-morrow.
M is Last Journey.
John Donovan was discharÃed from the
AlmshoVM yesterday at his Â«.wn request,
and .1 short while afterward he was
found lifeless in a ditch on a road bark at
the Spring \ alley reservoir by some boyi
The body w;ts removed to the Morgue
The dead man was about Â«5 years old
and had evidently dropped in the ditrh
and expired of heart disease while on his
way into town. An autopsy will prob
ably settle the cause of death more de
finitely.
The rope did not come down again at
once.
"Antoine. Antoine!" called the girl.
He was untying the bundle of woman's
clothes and trying to make out what
they were by holding them up in the
moonlight. Suddenly he dropped them
with an exclamation of surprise.
"Oh my good!" he said. "Oh dame dv
ratable!"
"Antoine! Antoine! Antoine, mechant M
she called.
"'Sh. 'sh! Not such a row he an
swered.
"L.et down the rope; I'm coming up."
she said
"You can't get up," he answered.
"You'll help pull me vp â quick
rope!"
"My hands are bleeding."
"Ruzardâ black buzard:" she cried, an
grily. "You lied to me!"
"I'll let down your clothes to you " he
said.
"If you don't let down the rope I'll
climb up without it. and if I fall and
break my Deck it'll be your fault. Quick
for J'm going to start!"
This (tightened him. He tied the ropes
still more firmly together, made a loop
and let the coil drop slowly. The loop
fell into Minois' hands.
"Don't start yet," he called down. "11l
pull when It's all ready." He fell back
from the edge to a place in the grass
where, tying the rope round his body, he
could seat himself and brace his feet
against a ledge of rock. TJien he pulled
on the rope.
Minois began climbing, and Antoine
pulled steadily. Twice he felt the rope
suddenly jerk when she lost her footing,
but still it came in steadily, and he used
a nose of rock as a sort of winch. He
knew when she was more than one-third
of the way up by the great weight upon
the rope, by th<- more frequent jerking
When she slipped. Yet this was no labor
and monstrous struggle such as An
toine'fl climbingâ this was the scaling of
a conquered wall by the legions of the
victorious.
She was nearly two-thirds of the way
up when a cannon shot boomed out over
the water, frightening again the vast
covey* of birds, which shrieked and
honked till the air was a maelstrom of
cries. Then came another cannon shot.
Antoines desertion was discovered.
I'pon the other side of the rock boats
were putting out toward the shore. An
toine knew perfectly each movement as
well as if he were watching them. The
fight was begun between a single fisher
man and a fleet of French warships.
His strength, however, could not last
much longer. Every muscle of his body
had been strained and tortured, and even
this easier task tried him beyond endur
ance. His legs stiffened against the ledge
of the rock, the tension on his arms made
th<-m numbâ he wondered how near she
was to the top. Suddenly there was a
pause, and then a jerk. Love of God!
the rope was shooting through his fln-
X' ts, his logs were giving way. He gath
â¢ i.l himself together, and then with
teeth, hands, and body rigid with enor
mous effort, he pulled and pulled. He
could not see. A mist swam before his
â yes. Everything grew black; but he
pulled on and on!
Ho never know just when she reached
the top. But when the mist cleared away
from his eyes she was bending over him,
putting rum to his lips as he sat just
where he had stiffened with effort.
"What a cat I was!" she said. "What
a wildcat I was to <nake you haul me up!
I didn't know it was so bad. It was bad
for me. with the rope round meâ it must
have been awful for you, my poor
esmanusâ my poor scarecrow, Antoine!"
Scarecrow indeed he looked. His clothes
were nearly gone, his hair was tossed
and matted, his eyes were bloodshot, his
huge hands were like pieces of raw meat,
his feet were covered with blood.
"My poor scarecrow!" she said, and
she tenderly wiped the blood from his
face where his hands had touched it.
Meanwhile bugle calls of command came
to them, and in the first light of morning
they could see the Frenchmen and the

Carnavals hurrying to and fro.
When day came clear and bright it was
known that Minois. as well' as Antoine,
had vanished. Ol' man Caroaval was in
as great a rage as the French admiral,
who was as keen to hunt down one Jer
sey-Englishman as he had ever been to
attack an English fleetâ more so, per
haps. â 
Meanwhile the birds kept up a wild tur
moil ami shieking. Never before had any
one heard them so clamorous. More than
once ol' man Carnaval had looked at
Perce Rock curiously, but whenever the
thought Of it as a nfuge occurred to him
he put it away. No, it was Impossible.
No human being since the world began
ever stood on that mysterious, lonely and
impregnable place, sacred to the birds
and the Invisible dwellers of the air.
Yet what was that? His heart thumped
under his coat. There were two people
on the lofty Island wallâ a man and a
woman. He. caught the arm of the
French officer near him. "I,ook! look!"
ho -aid. The Officer raised his glass and
looked.
â¢'lts the gunner!" he cried, and hand
ed the glass to the old man.
"It's my Minois: 1 said Carnaval. after
a moment, in a hoarse voice. "But it's
not possibleâ it's not possible!" he added.
"Nobody was ever there. My God! look
at itâ look at ttV
Jt was a picture, indeed. A man and a
woman were outlined against the clear
air, putting up a lent as < -almly as if it
were on a lawn, thousands of birds
wheeling over their heads, with quer
ulous, fantastic iTiÂ»s.
A few moments later ol' man Carna
val was being rowed swiftly to the
French flagship, where the admiral him
self was swearing viciously as he looked
through his telescope. He had recognized
the gunner.
He had prepared to boml>ard the fishing
post and wipe it out of existence if Car
naval did not produce Antoine. Well,
here was Antoine produced and insult
ingly setting up a tent on this sheer
rock, "with some snippet of the devil,"
s.iid the admiral, and defying the whole
French fleet: He would set his gunners
to work. If he had as good a marksman
as Antoine himself the deserter should
drop at the lirst shotâ "death and the
devil take his Impudent face:"
He was Just about to give the order
when Carnaval was brought to him. The
old man's story amazed him beyond
measure.
"It is no man. then!" said the admiral,
when Carnaval had done, and an officer
had added that all sides of the rock pre-
Mmted an almost perpendicular face. "He
must be a damned fly to do it! And the
girlâ sacre mot: ho drew her up after
him! I'll have him down out of that,
though, or throw up my flag." he added,
and. turning fiercely, gave- his orders.
For hours the French ships bombaried
the lonely rock from the north. The
white tent was carried away, but the
cannon-balls flew over or merely bat
tered the solid rock, th^ shells were
thrown beyond, and no harm was done.
Ri't now and again the figure of Antoine
appeared, and a half-dozen times he took
aim coolly with h(rf musket at th.>
French soldiers on the shore. Twice his
shots took effect â one man was wounded
and one killed. Then whole companies
of marines returned a musketry fire at
him. to no purpose. At his ease he hid
himself in the long grass at the edge of
the cliff and picked off two more men.
Here was a ridiculous thing â one man
and a slip of a girl fighting and defying
a whole squadron! The smoke of battle
covered miles of the great gulf. Even
the sea birds shrieked in ridicule.
This went on for three days at inter
nals. With a fine chagrin the admiral
and his fleet saw a bright camp-fire
lighted on the rock, and knew that An
loine and his girl were cooking their
meals in peace. A flagstaff, too, was set
up, and a red petticoat waved defiantly
in the breeze. At last the admiral, who
had watched the business from the deck
of the Invincible, burst out laughing at
the absurd humor of the situation. He
sent for ol man Carnaval.
"I've had enough." said he. "How long
can he last up there?"
"He will have birds' ejfgrs in plenty;
there's wild berries, too. besides ground
rats and all them. If I know my girl,
too. there's rations gone aloft," and he
shook his head ruefully.
"They're not married, either," said the
admiral, maliciously.
The old man shook his head again,
sadly.
"A fleet of the French republic blushes
for such shamelessness!" said the ad
miral, with mock indignation on his rei
face and a twinkle of the eye. "Come,
I've had enough."
He gave orders to stop firing. When
the roar of cannon had ceased he said:
"Sacre moi! There never was a Wilder
jest, and I'll not spoil the joke. -He has
us on his toasting-fork. I shall give him
the honor of a flag of truce, and he must
come down. The scoundrel shall marry
your daughter, fisherman, or we'll know
the reason why." He was a fat. coarse,
high-living admiral, and his sensual lower
lip shook with laughter.
And so it was that a French fle^t sent
a flag of truce to the foot of Perce Rock,
and a French officer, calling up, gave the
word of honor of his admiral that An
toine should suffer nothing at the hands
of a court-martial and that he should be
treated as a prisoner of war.
"As a prisoner of war," quoth Antoine.
That meant that he was to be treated
like an Kngllsh belligerent and not like
a French deserter. He hemmed and
hawed, and backed and filled, ami made a
function of the business, and insisted on
this as a condition and that as a con
cession; but at last he accepted the
terms, though Minois stormed and said
that she would stay in spite of all. At
last she would go only on condition that
she also should he treated as a prisoner
In Antoine's company.
Antoine was easily able to make these
terms, and she was lowered by the rope.
Antoine then fastened the rope end to
one point of rock and then to another,
and himself descended and was conducted
with Minois to the admiral with al! the
honors of war.
There was no court-martial. After Ar>
toine had told the tale of the ascent at
the admiral's command, all the officers
standing near, his fate was pronounced
The admiral said:
"No one but an Englishman would be
fool enough to attempt such a thing, an.l
no one but a fool could have been lucky
enough to succeed. You have proved,
gunner, that you are no Frenchman."
"Then I am no deserter, Exeeflency,"
said Antotne.
"You are a fool: but even a fool can
get a woman to follow him. and so this
llyaway followed you. gunner. But w*
wlll have no more lewdness 'twixt heaven
and earth, and â "
"Minols flew at the admiral as thouph
tn s< ratch his eyes out, but Antoine heM
her back.
"And you are condemned, gunner, con
tinued the admiral, dryly, "to marry the
maid before sundown or be carried out
to sea a prisoner of war."
So saying, he laughed silently and bade
them begone to the wedding.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
And it was done as the admiral com
manded, and the fishing post of Perec
was saved to England and Antoine and
Minols sailed the sea in the Charm
ing Nancy for many a year.

People Who Vow

That any human being should be so

inconceivable thing, for of all human

very highly, and yet it is a well
known fact that there have been seve
ral cases of men and women who have
vowed on certain occasions never to
speak again and who have kept their
pledges rigidly.
Only a few weeks ago a man died in
one of the Western States of America
with the curious record of never hav
ing spoken a word for twenty-five
years. It occurred thus: One morning
he asked his wife to sign a certain
document in connection with some
property which he owned, but she, for
some reason or other, refused. The
man thereupon swore that he would
never speak to her again, and further
than that, would never utter a word to
any living sou! as long as he lived.
He kept his word to the letter. Every
direction which he had to give either
at home or in his office was done in
writing, and, as he was a man of inde
pendent income, his strange behavior
did not, of course, interfere with his
means of livelihood. At the end of
twenty-five years he died of gastric
fever, having maintained absolute si
lence during the quarter of a century
in question.
Another extraordinary case, equal in
eccentricity to the preceding one,
comes from France. Some years ago
great discontent arose in one of the
villages owing to certain harsh meas
ures being adopted by the local gov
ernment, and, after many meetings
held to protest against the same, a
young man, renowned for his elo
quence and talent, was deputed to ap
proach the authorities with a view to
persuading them to remove or modify
the tyrannical regulations. He entered
into his mission with great spirit, and
in due course discharged it, but with
out success.
When he returned to the villagers
and announced his failure, so far from
sympathizing: with him, they turned
on him in a body and denounced him
as a simpleton, saying that had he
managed the business properly success
must have attended his efforts. Mad
dened with his failure and heart
broken by the Ingratitude of the peo
ple, he swore that never again would
he use his lips for the purpose of
speech, since those lips when exerted
for the common good had but brought
upon him hatred and contumely.
The poor fellow, however, did not
have to exercise his abstinence from
speech for very long, as six months
later he was drowned while fording
a stream, but during that period he
was never heard to breathe a single
word.
Ladies are commonly supposed to be
so fond of using their tongues that it
will surprise many people to hear that
women also have taken vows to ab
stain from speech, but such is the
case.
A young lady residing in Northamp
ton was so disgusted with the brutality
of her husbana that she declared she
would never speak to him as long as
she lived, whereupon he brutally and
cynically remarked that perhaps it
would be as well if she never spoke to
any one, since he considered her voice
the most repulsive sound on earth.
Hearing this she burst into tears, but
said nothing, and from that moment
onward she never spoke, though every
means was tried by her husband to
make her break her resolution.
For ten years she remained in this
condition, and it was only on her
spouse's death that she. set aside her
strange purpose and returned to the
ways of ordinary mortals as regards
speech. It was then noticed by those
who knew her that her voice was per
fectly changed and that it had the
loud, monotonous intonation such as is
observed in the voices of deaf people.
Mrs. Hooley: "Could you give me
something to prevent my husband from
talking in his sleep?"
Doctor: "Give him a chance to say
something in the day time."
