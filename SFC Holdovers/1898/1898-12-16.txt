DUNNING AND MRS. BOTKIN.
PLANNING TO PROVE THE MOTIVE
OF THE MURDERS.
Sensational Incidents in the Trial of
the Accused Woman â Secrets of the
Victoria Hotelâ The Discovery
of Haas' Seal in Mrs. Bot
kin's Room.
HE prosecutors of Mrs. Cordelia Itotkln scored four lm-

Jj[ passed on and off the stand Mrs. Botkin shook: the hand

for the testimony that will be introduced to show that 3lrs.
Botkin wrote the address on the box of poisoned candy.
Everything- the prosecution possesses in reference to the
mailing of the package was given to the Jnry. The clerk who
passed the box from this city on its way to Dover was on the
stand and told why he remembered the incident. Then the offi
cers lor the State shifted the scene to the establishment of
Georg? Haas aud summoned every employe, from the highest
to the lowest, in every department, to show that the poison
found in the candy did not come from the confectioner's shop.
Again the scene was changed to the Victoria Hotel, where
Dunning and Mrs. lintkin lived for a time. This phase of the
Inquiry developed two important results. It wan shown that the
relations, between the accused woman and Dunning: were most
intimate and that Mrs. Botkin claimed to be distracted to the
point of desperation at her pnrtinsr from Dunning. This evi
dence is but preliminary to the testimony that will be given to
establish a motive for the murders of which Mrs. Botkin is
accused.
The proceedings of yesterday closed with the evidence that
a seal, used on the -wares of George Haas, -was fonud in the
room of Mrs. Botkin a few days after she left the Victoria
Hotel.
1% MOB of men and women fought

Cook. The Botkin case rivals
the Durrant trial in local interest. The
trial chamber is invariably crowded be.

i vanees, yet notwithstanding this Mrs.
Botkin was jubilant. Her whole man
ner changed. The day before she had
been reserved, fearful, fretful and al
most unnerved. Witnesses were point
! ing at her the accusing finger of identi
fication, and Mrs. Botkin evidently
: suffered under the ordeal. Yesterday
she was sprightly, laughing, almost in
; solent, in an air of confident defiance.
The prosecution had tried and failed
to connect her with the mailing of the
j package of poisoned sweets.
It was a point in favor of the defense
Rnd Mrs. Botkin was happy. She did
D'.t seem to- care that the prosecution
had laid the foundation for the evi
dence that will show the disgraceful
relationship that existed between her
and Dunning. She Beemed to be un

concerned at the fact that a stamp
bearing the name of George Haas had
been found in her room. She was happy,
and after the day was over she rushed
over to George Knight and gratefully
shf-ok him by the hand.
Everybody employed by George Haas
had been summoned as witnesses, and
when court opened most of them were
present. Candy makers, candy dippers,
ice cream makers, clerkÃ, managers,
"salesladies," janitors and the human
odds and ends of the confectioner's
store trooped on and off the stand to
show, each within his or her knowledge,
that the poison found in the candies did
not come from the store of George
Haas. Every possible question that
might affect this issue was asked.
George Haas himself was placed on
the witness stand and was compelled
to tell all he knows about his own busi
ness. During the ordeal he revealed
j secrets that may be of value to the
: lovers of confections. Mr. Haas testi
! fied that It was Impossible for the ar
senic to have come from his store or
factory, either by accident or design.
"Salesladies," agitated and fluttering,
i tripped on the witness stand and
swore that they did not poison the
candy and did not know anybody who
I did. Men and women employed in
i every department of the store told how
j scrupulously clean the place is and how
j careful is the conduct of each depart
| merit. No poison surely could have
come from the establishment of George
I Haas. Even the mice in the place are
| killed not by poison, but by cats.
Miss Sylvia Heney offered another
fact to her testimony by declaring that
the woman who bought the box of bon
bons from her on July 31 carried with
her, when she entered the store, a
small package. Knight at once saw
the significance and purpose of the
question.
"Could you tell whether or not the
parcel contained lump or powdered ar
senic?" he asked sarcastically.
The girl replied that she did not
know what the parcel contained.
While the store of Haas was under
consideration the proprietor declared
that he could not swear to an identi
fication of his own candy. He believed
the poisoned sweets to be of his manu
facture, but beyond that he could not
go.
During the morning session the
prosecution showed how, and approxi
mated when, the box of poisoned candy
was mailed from this city to Dover.
J. D. Dunnigan, a mailing clerk at
the ferry postal station, testified, al
though with apparent unwillingness,
that earl;/ in August he noticed a pack
age In the mall addressed to Mrs. John
P. Dunning. The similarity of this
name to his own attracted his atten
tion, and he remarked the incident.
He also told how the police sent a
dummy package, similar to the Doi
son bo*, to the ferry postal station.
The purpose of the police was to assist
the clerks in recalling, if possible, the
passage of the original package.
This information gave Knight an
other opportunity to insinuate against
police methods, and he accepted it
quickly. Postal Inspector Irwin testi
fied that it is impossible to tell from
the marks of cancellation at which
local postal station a package is
mailed, as all packages are canceled
at the ferry station. A letter carrier
who delivered mail to Mrs. Botkin was
called, but his testimony was material
only in laying the foundation for evi
dence on handwriting.
One of the most important witnesses
of the day was Mrs. Loretta Simpson,
who formerly conducted the Victoria
Hotel and enjoyed Mrs. Botkin as a
guest. Mrs. Simpson declared that
Dunning also lived at the house for a
short time while Mrs. Botkin was there.
The two were Inseparable companions.
They took their meala together, came
and went together and seemed to be on
terms of the closest intimacy. When
Dunning left for Cuba Mrs. Botkin de
clared that she was prostrated and dis
tracted. She said she was very fond of
Dunning and did not see how che could
endure her solitude when he was gone.
This testimony will have a very im
portant bearing on what will follow in
the case of the prosecution when the
State will attempt to show the motive
for the murders of which Mrs. Botkln
is accused. Others who know the af
fairs of Mrs. Botkin better than Mrs.
Simpson will take up the story where
she left it.
Mrs. Birdte Price, the present owner
of the Victoria Hotel, also proved yes
terday to be an important witness for
the State. She swore that on Sunday,
July 31, the day when it is claimed Mrs.
Botkin bought the candy, the accused
woman pleaded serious illness and had
her breakfast sent to her room. Later
in the day Mrs. Price saw Mrs. Botkin
on the stairs as Mrs. Botkin was re
turning ."rom what Mrs. Price thought
was a shopping tour. The landlady re
marked the incident as curious for a
double reason. She believed Mrs. Bot
kin to be confined to her room and she
thought it strange that a woman should
go shopping on Sunda^. Mrs. Botkin
carried several parcels, one of which, in
size, shape and color, resembled the
wrapped box of candy that was sent to
Dover.
W. C. Kosello was the medium by
which the prosecution introduced the
fact that in August, shortly after Mrs.
Botkin left the Victoria Hotel, a seal
used by George Haas was found in her
room. Rosello now occupies Mrs. Bot
kin's room. When he rented it he found
the paper seal on the floor and gave it
to W. W. Barnes, the clerk of the hotel.
It was then handed over to the police.
Barnes was pia^< d cm tne witness stand
and corroborated what Rosello nad
said. There \.'as a minor contradiction
in the story of the two men. Each de
clared that he urged the other to go to
the police. Knight made much of this
after a cross-examination of insult.
Upon the opening of court Judge Cook
said he would sustain the objection of the
defense in regard to the introduction as
evidence of the package of arsenic pur
chased at the Owl Drugstore by Chief of
Police Lees. The Judge said it did not
seem material to the case unless it was
from the identical bulk as that from
which the Botkin purchase was made.
D. F. C. Droge, manager for George
Haas & Son, was the first of the twenty
two â¢witnesses who were on the stand
during the day. He knew Bylvia Heney
and Kittle Dittner, the two candy girls
who were on the stand the previous day.
He was in the store the afternoon some
candy was sold to a woman resembling
Mrs. Botkin. He saw Miss Heney take an
empty box from the case and fill It, but
did not see any customer, although he
knew one was there. The girl used a box
without the firm name on it. The witness
identified the box and the candy and said
the latter was made by Haas, although
he is not a confectioner by trade. The
witness was mildly cross-examined by
Mr. Knight, the chief thing brought out
being that he was not in charge of the
making of candy but only in the sales
department.
He was succeeded by Henry J. Pape,
foreman. in the candy factory, a position
he has held for fourteen years. He testi
fied that he made all the candy and hand
led all the material used in the store. It
was his duty to make the mixture of
which chocolate creams are composed
and then they are turned over to girls,
who dip them in melted chocolate. To a
query he said he had never used arsenic
or any poison in the manufacture of
candy. In all his experience he had never
seen lumps such as the arsenic shown
him in any candy. He recognized those
candies in evidence as having been made
in the Haas store.
He was asked if a piece of chocolate
were opened with a knife If a foreign
substance could be inserted and leave no
outward signs. He replied in the affirma
tive, saying the aperture could be covered
by heating. The foundation for the
chocr ate drops was composed of cream
tartar, water and sugar.
Mr. Knight took up the cross-examina
tion by an extended inquiry as to the
cleanliness observed in handling the cop
per kettle in which the candy is made.
Dr. E. H. Woolsey, Who, With Bennett, Took the Skull From the Dead
Body of Lillian Brandes.
Mr. Knight was in quest of verdigris,
which the witness said he had seen on
the outside of the kettle., but never on
the inside. As it was admitted they never
made randy oxi the outside of the kettle.
Knight's search for information was not
productive of any great result. However,
he induced the witness to say that he
kept the Implements of his trade shining
brightly so that he might see hi? image
reflected in them each lime he pass.nl.
Later with the aid of Mr. Hosmer he cor
rected this and said the kettle was kept
clean of necessity, as it was used for
making so many different kinds of candy.
He told of glucose sometimes taking the
place of cream tartar, and sometimes con
densed milk was UM>d. The witness said
he identified the candies shown him as
being from Haas' store by the color of
the chocolate, the shape of the mold and
the manner in which they were dipped.
On being asked as to the coloring matter
used he said he never knew of it being
poisonous. The material from which
green is produced he had often placed in
his mouth without suffering any ill ef
fects. He had never known of any
"Rough on Rats" being kept about the
premises. In fact there were no rats
about â only some mice.
George W. Haas, proprietor of the
store which has jumped into such no
toriety, was the next witness. He at
onco identified the box that carried death
to Delaware as having been sold in his
btcre. The candy he said looked very
much ilke. his manufacture. He had never
heard of any poison In candy. Being ask_-d
as tc the number of employes he had he
replied that he did not care to sca f .?, as
it would give his competitors a chance to
Â«=st:rr>ate the amount of business no was
doing. Tie compromised Really by giving
a list, of his employes to the Prosecuting
Attorney. Mr. Knight merely u.sked
some questions as to the severity of i.he
competition between the l?ading candy
stores. Mr. Haas was also secretive :ik tc
where ht purchases the seals he placet
on his boxes, but finally he said he or
dered them 20,000 at a time from a firm in
London.
Mrs. Loretta Simpson, who owned the
Victoria Hotel. Hyde and California
streets, in April, was next on the stand.
She said: "I knew Mrs. Botkin as a j
lodger at the hotel while I kept it. I sold
out to Mrs. Birdie Price in April of this
year. I first met Mrs. Botkin in the lower
hall of the hotel last March. She came
twice, and then became a lodger, having
a room on the top floor, where she re- !
mained after I left. I also knew John P.
Dunning. He came with Mrs. Botkin to
engage a room, and stayed five days dur
ing March. He then left in response to
a telegram calling him to Cuba. After he
left Mrs. Botkin felt very badly. She
went to Oakland with him when he
started East, and was almost prostrated
when she came back to the hotel. She
told me how badly she felt at hla going :
to war where he might be killed. She
afterward told me that she felt badly
about It, as Bhe was very fond of him

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Streightif on University avenue, Berke
ley, and requested permission to ex
amine the remains as representatives
of the defense. Mr. Streightif is also
Deputy Coroner and he knew they
were entitled to this privilege, but the
body had been ready for such an ex
amination for several days, the autopsy
had been held and the, funeral had been
set for an early hour that afternoon.
Mr. Streightif could not deny their
request, but he did prptest against
their delaying the examination until the
last minute. Furthermore, he said, he
was just going to his luncheon and
wanted to lock up the place.
"Never mind that," said Woolsey,
"you can leave us here and we will ex
amine the body while you are gone."
Mr. Streightif did not like the idea,
but knowing both men and believing
them to be reputable members of their
profession, l.c finally consented to the
plan, though first exacting a promise
from both, on their honor, not to
tamper with the body in any manner.
When the autopsy was held the phy
sicians removed the top of the skull
and also the three membranes covering
the brain. On the adhesions of these
membranes hangs the main point upon
which the prosecution relies for the
conviction of Brandes. This section of
the head was inspected by Drs. Shan
non, Rowell, Eastman, Hoagland. Bu
teau. Whitworth and Payne. Nearly
all these doctors took part in the au
topsy and when it was concluded they
returned the piece of the skull to the
rest of the body.
Mr. Streightif lifted the body out of
the casket and placed it on the operat
ing table for the convenience of the
two men, and then left the place. When
he returned Woolsey had pone, leaving
Bennett there alone. It lacked but fif
teen minutes of the time set for the
funeral, and Streightif was anxious to
have the body ready for the last rites.
As he stooped to lift the remains back
into the casket he noticed that some
thing was wrong, and he asked Bennett
what they had done to the body. Ben-
i neit made an evasive reply and left the
room.
A hasty examination showed the
Deputy Coroner that the crown of the
skull, originally removed at the au
; topsy, but replaced and the scalp drawn
over, had been abstracted and a bun
gling attempt made to cover up their
horrible ; deed with the child's hair. It
was this disarrangement of the : hair
that made Streightif . suspicious.
As soon as the casket had been borne
away Streightlf called up Bennett by
telophone and charged him and Wool
i soy with the deed. Bennett 'acknowl-
I edged that thcv had taken the portion
of the skull, but advised Streightif not
to say anythlr.R about It. .
But Streightlf did not keep quietâ
! least he made it ;bo j uncomfortable for
i the pair that they pave him an order
! for the return of the erowxv which or
der ha new heldÂ«,
1 OTlie patter was nutuo known to ifco2
District Attorney subsequently, but a3
thf rehtovlng of a part of the body of
the murdered pirl might have precipi
tated un unpleasant proceeding: and
have reached the courts, nothing was
done.
And the purpose of the robbery -is
plain very plain, to the prosecution.
Th<> skull and membranes will be used
in an attempt to prove that all the
â¢Xpert testimony of the State is not in
conformity with the facts, and that the
blows on the head did not cause Lil
lian's death. The prunrcution has felt
Safe, as seven doctors in good standing:
had made a thorough examination of
the skull and were prepared to testify
to its condition, so that if by any
chance the bruised bones and mem
branes showing adhesions should be
broOght Into court and should not
npree with the expert testimony there
wt.^Jd be any amount of evidence to
support the theory that the srirl was
killed by bruises and that sho was sus
pended to the bedpost after death.
Much surprise has been expressed
that the defense did not have a repre
sentative present at the autopsy, but
that its representatives should prefer
t' ' go to the Morpue after the body had
beed subjected to the knives and s;i\va
of the physicians employed by the Dis
trict Attorney.
The possession of the skull is of vital
importance to the defense. If, when
it bo. brought into cuurt, the pathologi
cal conditions of the bones and mem
branes do not agree with the testi
mony of t lie doctors, the whole struc
ture of the prosecution may fall to the
ground. The State has already proved
that I-illian did not die by hanging,
and this fact depi nds upon the conten
tion of the prosecution that the girl
died from meningitis, caused by blows
on the head, and that thes.' blows were
intlieted by Urandes with his wife's
knowledge.
For nearly a week Attorney Bennett
has been surprising everybody by the
persistence with which he had
plied the medical witnesses with ques
tions relating to the adhesions of the
membranes to the brain of Lillian
Brandes, and the nature of the bruises.
Hour after hour the defense has asked
questions showing that he has been
exceedingly well coached in all the de
tails of the condition of Lillian's head
as it was found at the autopsy.
"The takinr- a' ay of the top of the
skull and the membranes is a most sig
niflcant incident." said one of the ex
perts in the case to-night. "The etise
really stands or falls upon the silent
tPFtimony of the girl's skull. It was
found that the membranes were in
tlamed to such an extent that there
were adhesions to the brain covering a
large surface. Dr. Buteau testified that
about nine inches of the surface of the
brain was attached to the membrane.
This, of course, produced meningitis,
and ultimately death. Between the two
tables of the skull, immediately over
the adhesions, free blood was found.
This could only have been caused by a
blow.
"There are blood vessels between the
tables of the skull and on Lillian's
head the force of the blows had burst ;
several and the free blood was very j
plain. Now, if the skuil should get into j
careless hands and should ever be
washed the blood would at once disap
pear, and even the membranes might
be removed from the condition In which
we founl them. This might even be
done unintentionally, but it would
caus-" the skull to present an appear
ance vastly different from that in which
it was at the time of death, and this
would form the basis for a very power- I
ful argument before thf Jury. For sev
eral days we have known that there
was a purpose ir all this cross-ex
amination, but 1 did not know until to- '
day what th>- secret was."
The defense certainly knows now
â¢what is the basis of the case for the
prosecution*. All the testimony that
has been put in has tended to prove
one pointâ that Mllian's life went out
as a result of blows on the head. This
proof depends entirely on the expert
conclusions derived from the patholog
ical conditions of the girl's head and
other organs. Should Dr. Woolsey as
sume charge of the medical end of the
defense a lively scientific fight will en
sue. Dr. Woolsey is a very experienced
surgeon, and his long connection with
railroad damage cases has made him
a practiced witneÃs.
Between some of tho doctors em
ployed by the District Attorney and Dr.
Woolsey there has been for years bit
ter professional rivalry, and Dr. Wool-
Fey is .always ready to pick up the
gauntlet for a scientific battle. It is
surmised that Attorney Bennett has
drawn much of !!;â¢â  surgical lore with
which he has astonished the court for
a \vo.->k from the storehouse of I>r.
Woolsey. Certain it is that there has
been a very careful and thorough foun
dation laid by the defense for holding
up its end in the trial In the Superior
Court.
Another explanation of why \Y. .
should interest himself in the case suf
ficiently to go to the length of robbing
the pnor child's coffin is the fact thnt
Bennett is a brother-in-law of his med
ical partner.^
There has been much other testimony
brought out by the defense that will
materially help its case if it should suc
ceed in showing that tho testimony cov
ering the skull is not borne out by the
actual condition nf the skull. It has
been testified that Lillian had but one
lung and the usefulness of that was
practically destroyed by pleurisy. This
would naturally produce a weak con
stitution and the defense has drawn

CALVIN S. BRICE
CALLED TO REST
Death Claims tfye Distinguished
Ex-Seoator and Noted Lawyer
of Ohio.
THE LATE EX-SENATOR CALVIN S. BRICE.
NEW YOIIK, Dec. 15.â Ex-Senator Calvin S. Brice died at 3:15
this afternoon in this city from pneumonia. Mr. Brice contracted a
cold a week ago to-day. On Friday last he vent down town to
his office returning home in a suffering condition, and on Saturday he
took to his bed. He grew steadily wor.se until to-day, when he died.
Calvin Stewart Brice was born in Denmark, Ohio, on the 17th of
September, 1845. He was a descendant of th - Maryland Brices. who
trace their lineage to the Brices or "Brycea" of Kinnaird, Scotland,
kinsmen of the yet more famous members of the once royal clan.
Mr. Brice'B father was a rominent Presbyterian clergyman, anu his
mother was Elizabeth Stewart of Carrollton, Md., like his father, a
descendant of a royal Scottish house. In his extreme youth Brice
attended the common Bchools, later entering Maine University at Ox
ford, Ohio. When fifteen years of age, the war having broken out,
he enlisted as a "three-months" man, and afterward re-enlisted. Still
lal r, being discharged, he organized Company E, 180 th Uhio Volun
teers, and before the close of the war had attained to the rank of
:>ant colonel. For a time he distinguished himself in the legal
profession, but later entered the railroad business and became one of
the most successful managers in the United States. Entering politics
he quickly achieved prominence in the Democracy, becoming chair
man of the national committee in ISS9. In January, 1890, he was
elected United States Senator from Ohio, to succeed Henry B. Payne.
Mr. Brice served six years in the Senate, being succeeded by
Joseph B. Foraker. In Washington he occupied the Corcoran House
and gave lavish entertainments which became world-wide. Since his
retire from the Senate he has been in Washington very little,
but occupying himself in most part with business affairs In New York!
Until the Democratic party adopted free silver as a cardinal princi
ple Mr. Brice was the leader in his party in Ohio, but after that he
did not take an active part in politics.
The announcement of Mr. Brice's death caused great regret in
the Senate as he was a favorite with nearly all, possessing a fund of
good humor, a good story-teller and universally popular with Sena
tors on both sides of the chamber. He was admired for his business
and political skill and for his abounding good humor, which never left
him on any occasion.
He was largely interested in railway enterprises, was ra t e( j a mil
lionaire and of late had been one of the chief members of a syndi
cate with large railroad and other concessions in China. He leaves
a widow and several grown chilldren.
from the prosecution many valuable
pointers along this line.

Atorneys Sawyer and Bennett, who are
conducting the defense of W. -v. Hrandes,
charged with murdering his da- ,hter. bad
a little disagreemeni to-day in Judge
Cliffs court winch relieved the monotony
uf the medical expert testimony.
Attorney Bennett was examining Dr. To
bin, a physician who witnessed the au
topsy, but who was not called to the
stand by the prosecution. The defense
called him to testify, but did not want
him to give evidence ms an expert. An ar
gument followed as to where the line
could be drawn. Unless he testified as an
t Xpert, Dr. Tobin said, he would be un
able to testify at all, because his only
knowledge that was derived from his abil
ity as a surgeon to draw conclusions and
opinions from pathological conditions.
Prosecuting Attorney Allen demanded
that the nature of Dr. Tobin's testimony
be decided at once. Attorney Bennett
made a suggestion that the witness talk
in an ordinary way and not in a scientific
manner. Attorney Sawyer said: "If it
please the court, I must obiect to the
manner in which my associate has put the
proposition." There was a little consulta
tion between the attorneys and a good
deal of head shaking, after which they
obtained permission to adjourn for tin
minutes, and after a consultation in the
Judge's chambers they agreed on the plan
of procedure.
Dr Tobin was asked to tell what he saw
in the murdered girl's head after it was
opened, to which lie replied: "1 saw the
inside of it." Attorney Bennett wanted to
know what he saw inside the head.
Dr. Tobin replied that he could only ex
plain in scientific lanaguage according to
his expert knowledge, and Attorney Allen
declared that us the defense claim that
their witness was nol giving expert testi
mony he could not appear us an expert.
Brandes' attorney then commenced to
cross examine their own witness, and this
\\;ii promptly Objected to and Attorney
Allen said that the witness had not shown
himself to he hostile or to be giving tes
timony contrary to the wishes of the de
fense,"and therefore he was entitled to be
protected from cross-cxnmiation by his
counsel. Judge dift held that the method
being pursued in regard to Dr. Tobin was
altogether illegal and Illogical md finally
lit was excused.
This morning Dr. Rowel!, who helped to
perform the autopsy on Lillian Brandes,
gave his testimony, which agreed with
that of the experts who have previously
testified. Tie was positive death was not
due to hanging, but that it was due to the
conditions proQuced by blows on the girl's
head; , ,
The prosecution concluded its case to
day, but the defense desired to put orr
one witness before submitting the issue,
'incy promised to have their witness in
court to-morrow, so an e^irly adjournment
was had this afternoon and at the morn
ing session to-morrow the case will be
concluded.

FATE OF JOHN E. FERRO
FROZEN TO DEATH NEAR THE
MEADOWS.
Hardships of the Trail Dethrone His
Reason and He Refuses the
Aid Proffered by a
Friend.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, Dec. 15.â Miners who
reached here from Skaguay by the
steamer Danube bring news of the
d< ath of one of Skaguay's best known
packers and merchants, John E. Ferro,
who was frozen to death on the snow
buried White Pass a few days before
that steamer left the gateway city.
Ferro, who was the first man to bring
out news of the Atlln Lake gold fields,
was on the way back from Bennett
when the fatality occurred. News of
his death was brought to Skaguay by
C. W. Emery, who accompanied Ferro
some of the way on his fatal trip.
Emery overtook Ferro just as he was
approaching Brooks Camp, and, seeing
how emaciated and exhausted he was,
gave him a horse. The two then con
tinued their journey together. When
they reached the Meadows, Emery sug
gested that they stop and have dinner.
F( CTO refused, saying he had no money,
but when Emery insisted he went in
and ate heartily. After dinner th>'\'
continued the journey to the north side
of the summit. Emery stopped here
for a few moments to speak with an
ingoing miner. Ferro went on, and
when Emery turned to look after him
he had disappeared.
Emery at once started in pursuit, but
could find no trace of the unfortunate
packer or the horse onttl some time
afterward, when he saw him standing
alone on a high point near Summit
Lake, fully a mile from the trail.
Emery immediately went to him. Be
fore he had conversed with him two
minutes he saw that the packer had
lost his reason. He talked insanely
and, despite all assertions to the con
trary, argued that he was still on the
trail. Asked as to what had become
of the horse. Ferro said he had tied his
blankets and gun on it and turned it
loose, because, he said, it would not fol
low the trail.
Ferro refused to proceed farther and
Emery left him and went to the near
est railway camp for assistance. Fear
ing Ferro might die before he returned,
he asked what message he was to send
to the packer's family.
"Tell my wife I froze to death," said
Ferro.
Emery hastened to the nearest camp
of the railway workers, and, accom
panied by five railroad men, hurried
back. They were too late, however, for
they founA the body of the dead packer
lying in the snow, with life extinct. He
had not been dead long, for the body
was still warm.
It is reported that at least twelve of
the railway employes have been frozen
t<> death, but no confirmation could be
obtained.

Who are in full sympathy and accord with

the least taint of suspicion appear that
the representatives of Southern Califor

posed in them.
"It is strange that the railroads are
neninst the canal, but it is a lamentable
truth that they are. Their methods of
work are not as ours will be. We have
i" contend with the allied powers winch
are behind corporate organization.
"The completion of the Nicaraguan ca
nal means much to the citrus and decid
uous fruit-growers of California, We
shall find plenty of workers who favor
this cause.'*

JOHN H. M'FARLAND
ENDS HIS OWN LIFE
Suicide of a Prominent Porterville
Business Man While Tempo
rarily Insane.
PORTERVILLE, Dec. 15.â John Henry
M< Farland of the firm of McFarland &
Son. dry poods merchants of this place,
committed suicide last night. His body
was found in the office at the rear of the
store by Charles Trager, one of his clerks,
at the hour of opening the store for the
day's business this morning. McFarland
had been drinking heavily for several
days, and it is supposed was laboring un
der temporary aberration of mind when
he committed the act. When found the
head was leaning over the desk and the
pistol WM siill clutched in his hand. The
bull entered the right ear and lodged in
the brain, death being instantaneous.
McFarland came to this city about nine
\( ars ,<Â£<> and was one of the leading
business men of the county. He was
owner of the Mount Whitney telephone
line, which he had lately put into first
class condition. His accounts are in ap
parently good condition. The Odd Fellows
will take charge of the funeral, which
will be held to-morrow.

Will Stand on Chicago Platforn)
Witt) a New Planl^ OpposiQg
Territorial Expansion.
NEW YORK, Dec. 15.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: Colonel William J. Bryan came to this city, I was
informed to-day, to consult leaders as to the future programme of
Democracy. It can be confidently stated that after many confer
ences held by him to-day with Senators and Representatives he con
siders himself in line with the prevailing views of party managers.
He claims that many Senators and Representatives agree with him
in his utterances printed yesterday morning. No significance is at
tached to the fact that Senator Jones did not call upon him, as his
failure to do so is ascribed to a death in the family of the Democratic
chairman.
Mr. Bryan remarked with emphasis to several of his callers that
the issues of 1900 would be those enunciated in the Chicago platform,
with another plank inserted opposing territorial expansion. This may
be relied upon as the policy mapped out to-day by Colonel Bryan
and most of the Democrats with whom he consulted. His plan now
is to remain in Washington for two or three days longer for further
conferences and then return to his home in Nebraska. It is not
Colonel Bryan's purpose now to engage in any occupation except that
of speaking and writing in favor of the Democratic plan. He pro
poses to keep these issues persistently before the people and together
with the leaders to perfect an organization which he thinks will
bring victory in 1900.
The suggestion of Gorman's name as a probable nominee of the
party is not relished by Mr. Bryan's friends. I was told by some of
those in conference with him to-day that no doubt is entertained of
Mr. Bryan's nomination, and that all the supposed opposition will
soon disappear. One of Mr. Bryan's friends said yesterday that it
was not improbable on his return to Nebraska he would buy a farm
and settle down as an agriculturist in connection with his political
and literary pursuits. I am informed he will be advised to do this
by some of his friends.

VANCOUVER, Dec. 15.-Corydon P.
Benton, an agent of the Hawaiian Gov
ernment, is in Vancouver. Ho recently
has been in Italy for the purpose of em
ploying Italian farm laborers to work on
the Hawaiian sugar plantations. Speak
ing of the labor problem in Hawaii Mr.
Benton said:
"It is the most difficult task the planters
have to deal with. To work the planta
tions properly it will be necessary to im
port fully 7000 laborers within the next
twelve months. I was sent to Italy sev
eral weeks ago by Hon. S. M. Damon, the
Minister of Finance at Honolulu, to em
ploy Italian farm laborers. My mission
was not very successful, the Italian Gov
ernment refusing to let Italians leave for
Hawaii in great numbers. Tne officials,
however, agreed to let eighteen go to the
islands, and should they be satisfied hun
dreds will follow them."

DR. SPONOGLE ON THE RACK
PLAIN QUESTIONS PUT TO THE

It Is Insinuated That He Circulated
Scandalous Stories to Injure
the First Assistant
Physician.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 15.â The investiga
tion into Bessie Bailey's death did not
end yesterday with the adoption of tlsÂ«
resolution that her demise resulted
from natural causes. To-day the Board
of Managers of Agnewa Asylum re
opened the case in secret session. This
was at the request of Dr. L.. i. Stock
ing, first assistant physician at the
asylum, who is not satisfied with the
outcome of yesterday's investigation.
The inquisition was only started and
will be resumed at a meeting of the
board next Monday.
The meeting of the board to-day was
to consider bids for supplies for the en
suing six months. Trustees Gould. Cur
now, Hale, White and L'pham were
present. Dr. Stocking went to each in
dividual member and demanded an In
vestigation. He said newspaper re
ports had coupled his name with Bes
sie Bailey's actions at the asylum, and
these insinuations and inuendoes had
done him an injustice.
After the bids were opened the board
adjourned to Dr. Sponogle's office, and
there, behind closed doors and drawn
blinds, with all the members sworn to
the greatest secrecy, the investigation
regarding Miss Bailey's death was re
opened. Sponogle and Stocking were
the only others present.
Stocking was first examined, and
told virtually the same story as yester
day. He gave a lucid explanation and
denial of the stories printed in the Ex
aminer reflecting on him. and his testi
mony made a good impression on tha
managers.
Dr. Sponogle was then put through
the "sweating" process. About the first
question propounded to him was by
Chairman Curnow, who asked:
"Dr. Sponogle, is it a fact that you
have been giving these sensational
stories to newspapers with a view to
injuring Dr. Stocking?"
Sponogle became uneasy. He
squirmed and hemmed and hawed and
proved himself an artful dodger in try
ing to evade the question. He finally re
covered himself Lufficientlv to make a
denial. Hale, Gould, White and Ud
ham questioned him along the same
line. He knew nothing about the stor
ies, and denied having given out any
information. Sponogle did not know
whether any of the attaches of the in
stitution had given out information.
The rest of his testimony was similar
to that of yesterday.
The board wanted to d*>lve furthtr
into the matter, but it was discovered
that all the attaches who saw any
thing of Bessie Bailey on the morning
of hfT departure were away. The at
tendants on the ward on that morning
and the coachman were off duty. This
caused some comment.
An adjournment was taken with the
understanding that tne case would be
brought up at the next meeting. On
Monday morning the board will meet
to award contracts, and the secret in
quiry will then be resumed.

CUSTOMS DISTRICT FOR
THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â Assistant Secretary Howell of the
Treasury Department was heard before the Committee of Ways and
Means to-day on the need of extending the tariff laws to Hawaii as
soon as possible. He read a letter from Harold Sewall, former
United States Minister there and now special agent of the Treas
ury, stating that this immediate extension of the laws was imperative
in order to prevent the irregular entry of goods to the United States
by way of Hawaii.
The committee agreed to the Immediate extension proposed and
Hawaii will be established as one of the customs districts with three
sub-ports of entry, viz: Hilo, Mahukona and Kahului. The collec
tor of customs will have headquarters at Honolulu and will receive
$4000 salary. Speedy action by the House will be secured.

After three cheers for McKinley had
! been given with a will, at the conclu
sion of his speech, General Wheeler
rose from his seat on the platform.
Then came such enthusiasm, such pan
demonium, as is seldom seen. For
three minutes the audience cheered and
veiled and waved their hats. Over and
over again the little Southern general
tried to begin his speech, and over and
over again he was compelled to wait for
the cheers to stop. Then the band
played -Dixie," and once more the
, crowd broke Into frantic cheers. Gen
! eral Wheeler eulogized the President
and expressed his pleasure at the re
i ception given to Mr. McKinley by
Georgia. , ~f:~ f : , ,
Lieutenant Hobson responded to loud
' calls with an Impassioned speech, in
| which he drew the attention of his
hearers not only to the bravery of the
' American soldiers and Bailors, but to
the chivalry and bravery of the enemy,
especially of Admiral Cervera.
The Presidential party drove back to
1 their hotel. On the way the carriage
in which were Generals Shatter and
Lawton was run into by a street car,
and the two distinguished officers were
: thrown to the street, but neither was
; hurt. A public reception at the Gov

j on account of the lateness of the Au
! ditorium affair.
In the beautifully decorated dining
room of the Klmball House to-night the
Atlanta Peace Jubilee, which brought
to this city the President of the United
States, several members of his Cabinet
and many distinguished figures of the
war with Spain, and resulted in the ut
terances by the executive which have
1 cemented hard and fast the bonds be
, tween the North and South, was
brought to a fitting close by an elabor
1 ate banquet. Covers were laid for 300.
: All the city's distinguished guests were
present and seated at the President s
i table. The Atlantans attending the
1 banquet were representative of the
city's wealth and business interests.
Many prominent men from all parts of
the South also graced the tables.
Hon. Clark Howell, editor of the At

An elaborate menu was discussed,
after which the speechmaking began.
| Hon. Clark Howell introduced the Pres
l ident. His speech was one of the best
of the eveninr He paid a tribute to
President McKinley's policy of appoint
ing Southern men and ex-Confederates
to high offices, which, he said, had
"broken forever the barrier that divides
North and South and stamped the in
dissoluble seal of understanding and
I fraternity upon the Union."
The President, as he arose, was the
| recipient of a hearty and spontaneous
i greeting. The cordiality with which he
' has been received on all occasions dur
ing his visit was nowhere more evident
J than at to-night's gathering. The ex
ecutive was compelled to stand and bow
some moments before those about the
tables would permit him to proceed.
The President responded to the toast
"Our Country." He began by a pleas
! ant reference to an earlier visit to ta*
city of Atlanta and spoke feelingly of
: his association then with Georgia's bril
liant editor, the late Henry Grady.
: Continuing the President said:
Four years have Rone since I last met
the people of Georgia in public assembly.
Much has happened In the Intervening
time. Tilt! nation has been at war, not
within its own shores, but with a foreign
power, a war waged not for revenge or
i aggrandizement but for our oppressed
! neighbors, for their freedom and amelior
ation. It was short but decisive. It re
: corded a succession of significant victories
'â  on land and sea. It gave new honors to
I American arms. It has brought new
problems to the republic, whose solution
will tax the genius of our people. United
: we will meet and solve them with iionor
;to ourselves and to the lasting beneli . of
all concerned. The war brought us to
' Re '-her; its settlement will keep us to
j gether %
Reunited! Glorious realization! n. cx
i presses the thought of my mind and the
long deferred consummation of my heart's
desire as I stand in this presence. It in-
I teri'rets the hearty demonstration here
witnessed and is the patriotic refrain of
â  all sections and of all lovers of the re
( public. Reunited! One country again and
one country forever! Proclaim it from
the press and the pulpit. Teach it In the
schools. Write it across the skies. The
world sees and feels it. It cheers every
heart, North and South, and brightens the
; life < f every American home. Let 1:0 t
h in:? ever strain it again. At peace with
; all the world and with each other, what
cÂ»'.n stand in the pathway of our progress
i and prosperity.
Hon. John D. Long, Secretary of the
: Navy, followed, responding to the
I toast, "The Navy."
Major General Shafter was heartily
! cheered when introduced by Mr. How

Army."
Hon. George R. Peck of Chicago was

"All talk about abandoning- the
well-understood and long-established

MISSIONARIES PUT TO DEATH
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE
MADE HOMELESS.
Three Bands of Yumantse's Rebels
Sacking Villages and Murder
ing Natives Friendly to
Foreigners.
Special r>israt<'h to The Call.
TACOMA, Dec. 15. â The steamship
Empress of India .brings news of a
massacre of Catholics and native Chris
tians by rebels of Szechuen province,
China, under the notorious outlaw,
Yumantse. This rebel and his follow
ers have rendered 20,000 native Chris
tians homeless in Central China and
taken over sixty lives, including those
of several European missionaries. Six
thousand Catholic refugees have
gathered in the city of Chungking from
the surrounding country. The value of
property already destroyed by the rebels
is reckoned at 5,000,000 taels. France is
making a claim for this amount in re
paration for the destruction of property
belonging to French missionaries.
The Yumantse rebellion has been in
progress nearly a year. Mandarins and
other authorities of Szechuen have main
tained their policy of doing nothing to
suppress him so persistently that Yu
mantse has now gathered an armed
force of 5000 men about him. These are
divided into three bands.
The first, under Yumantse's com
mand, appeared before the city of^Yu
inchuan late in October. The city's
gate was shut against him, whereupon
he demanded that two prominent
Catholic missionaries be given to him.
These were publicly beheaded outside
the city's gate. They were offered their
lives if they renounced their faith, but
had the courage to accept death rather
than apostacy.
His third band is raiding the valley
of Kialing River and has destroyed all
the Catholic buildings there.
The rebels maintain excellent discip
line, paying for everything they require
of the natives. They wear a uniform
with a character for "Avenge" upon it.
Their avowed object is to rid China of
foreigners and stamp out their religion.
Yumantse's men are still holding M.
Fleury, the French Catholic missionary,
for ransom. Once they delivered him
to the Chinese authorities on payment
of a large sum and the next day re
captured him. Now they demand a
larger amount. The telegraph line
from Chungking to Chengtu has been
cut and other depredations committed.
French pressure has become so- great
that the authorities of Szechuen are now
determined to end Yumantse's depre
dations. Instead of sending a large
armed force to capture him, however,
they have offered him an office, honors
and money as a bribe to disperse his
men and give up Fleury. Orders have
been issued to pay him 100,000 taels and
to retain 1000 of his men in the imperial
troops and give Yumantse himself a
military place if he agrees to their pro
posal. Business is so completely par
alyzed throughout Szechuen that foreign
business houses at Shanghai and Wu
chow are urging that a foreign mili
tary expedition be sent into that west
ern province to capture Yumantse and
restore order.
Dispatches from Canton report that
Viceroy Tan has received instructions
from Peking to purchase from the
Russo-Chinese Bank 500,000 Russian
Berdan army rifles, with accompanying
ammunition, for the arming of Chinese
troops throughout the empire. This
amo-unts to the unloading upon China
of a half-million obsolete rifles which
the Russian army cannot use. The
price dr-manded for the Berdans is five
taels per rifle and twelve taels per
thousand cartridges. It is announced
that the arming of the Chinese troops
in all Manchuria will commence imme
diately, the rifles having arrived. Last
August the Tsung li Yamen refused to
buy these rifles, but recent events have
induced the Empress Dowager to ac
quire them.

Postponement of the Vote on the Mo

of the Nicaragua
Canal Bill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â The urgent !
deficiency appropriation bill making '
provision for the army and navy for the j
next six -nli* displaced the Nicara- '
qua anal bill in the Senate to-day, pre
venting e-en the taking of a vote on the |
question of postponement until after
the holidays, as had been intended. The j
deficiency till -was passed after a
spirited discussion, turning principally
on the point of keeping the volunteer I
soldiers i . Ihe servie â¢.
The Senate, upon convening to-day de
cided to take a recess from 1:30 until 3:30 ,
o clock in order to permit Senators to at- i
tend the funeral of Mrs. Bright, wife of j
the : -at -arms.
Vest gave â¢' brief explanation, the pur- i
port of which was that he had received !
a letter from Attorney General Griggs j
denying that at a banquet in New York
he had, as quoted, expressed the opinion
that the legislation made for half-devel
oped colonies could not reasonably be ex
pected to meet â  'â â â¢ demands of the great
est nation in the world.
Morgan presented a memorial from the '
National Board of Trade favorable to i Â»c
construction of the Nicaraguan canal,
asking that it be printed in the Congres
sional Record. Allen objected, and Mor
an accepted the action of Allen as an ef- -
fort to obstruct legislation for the canal
and to prevent the country securing- in
formation on the subject. â ;
Allen n-sented this, saying he was fa
vorable to the canal on genera] princi-
Pies, though advocating Government own-

Without determining the mooted point
raised by Allen the Senate, at Hale 1 a re
quest, took up the urgent deficiency 'â 
appropriation bill. } :
Cockrell addressed the Senate in re
gard to the mustering out of the volun
teer soldiers a large majority of whom,
he said, wanted to be mustered out and
many of whom were making sacrifices by
remaining in the service. On the other
hand the officers, who were finding the
service more profitable than the private*
had in many cases refusefl to forward an-
Plications for discharge. He thought that
in such cases w.e War Department snould i
exercise some discretion in the interest of
the private and be more lenient with the
enlisted men. Cockrell said very few
soldiers would be required in Cuba and j
Porto ? COf or. for , that matter, in the
Philippines, where, he said, our footing I
was very Insecure. He said this country's
occupation there was most meager, and
described our attitude as that of stand
ing with one foot on the land and the
other on the bay, and that there was no i
probability of war In that direction
The Spaniards. Cockrell said, would :
soon be out of Cuba, and as the object 1
of the war was to get the Spaniards out
of that island there was no longer any
reason for maintaining a large force un
der arms.
Replying, Hale paid he had no doubt
that the run* and file of the army abroad
had a greaT desire to return home and
he expressed the opinion that they should i
be allowed to do so. He argued that
there, was no menace of war unless it was
with the Filipinos, and the only dan
ger there was in our attacking them. It
was true that the duty devolved upon the
Government of the. United States of main- '
taming peace and quiet in Cuba for the I
present until the Cubans could establish I
a Government of their own. He hoped
this would not be long. In response to I
questions from Allen. Hale expressed the '
opinion that affairs would soon take such
chape that the services of the volunteers
could be dispensed with.
Gorman said he had r.dvocated an
amendment to the hill which would pro
vide,, in explicit terms, for the reduction 1
of from 25,000 to 50.000 by July 1 next but i
owing to the representations of the army j
authorities he would reserve his amend
ment until the army bill should come be
for S â¢h. Senate, In this connection he
paid a high tribute to Adjutant General
< prbln, and then he proceeded to warn I
the country against the encroachments I
of the military element. Naturally the '
army officer wanted to preserve his own
importance and maintain his employment
but this was no reason why the private
citizen should not zealously guard his
own rights. He thought coaling stations
necessary for the extension of our trade
but announced himself as opposed to un
due expansion by means of conquest
Allison expressed sympathy with 'the
desire to have a large number of volun
teers mustered out. We had agreed to
maintain order in Cuba dur.ng the unset- I
tied period, and while he hoped this pe
riod would not long continue he, for one
would not consent to -- reduce our forces
as not be able to make good our pledges
Sewell said the War Department had
for the past several months been Rradu
ally weeding out soldiers for discharge
and that many thousands had thus been
relieved from this duty. He had no doubt
that even without legislation 50.000 men
would be released within the next six
months.
The urgent defiVeney bill was then
passed.
At the Instance of Harris the Senate
adopted a resolution calling upon the
President for information as to the status
of the report of the Nicaragua commis
sion.
The Senate then went into executive
session and at 5:03 p. m. aojourned until

of his wives to rule supreme. He charged
Congressman-elect Roberts of I.'tah with
being an avowed polygamlst. and assert

VOTES AGAINST EXPANSION
ALMOST UNANIMOUS IN ITS AN

Encroachment of Chinese in Califor
nia Cited as an Object Lesson

â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Dec. 15.â At its
annual convention to-day the Ameri
can Federation of Labor declared, by
an almost unanimous vote, against a
standing army In the United States,
which is in reality recognized as a pro
test against expansion, or "the spirit
of imperialism," as it was termed by
the delegates. This action was taken
after five hours of debate on every
phase of the question. At times many
of the speakers became eloquent in
their utterances and receivd unstinted
applause from the delegates.
The issue came .before the convention
through a resolution which grew out
of suggestions in President Samuel
Qompers' annual report. The debate
opened when the committee, of which
Henry Lloyd of Boston is chairman, of
fered this resolution:
Whereas. As a result of the recent war
with Spain a new and far-reaching policy
known as Imperialism or expansion Is
about to thrust s\pon us a large standing
army and an autocratic navy, this con
vention offers its protest, and calls upon
its officers to use all power to defeat it.
Samuel B. Donnelly of Now York,
president of the American Typograph
ical Union, was the first speaker and
practically the only delegate who in
any way defended the cause of expan
sion.
"Expansionists have always won,"
said he, in the course of his remarks,
"because it is in the interest of higher
civilization. Don't believe that the
65,000.000 people who do not belong to
trades unions in this country are go
ing to bow down to a system of im
perialism or pay homage to a crown. I
know I am in the minority here, but
if we adopt this policy against expan
sion I want to go further and declare
against this peace alliance with Great
Britain."
Andrew Furuseth, representative of
[ the Seamen's Union, characterized the
â  result that he though would follow cx
i pansion as similar to the importation
iof the negro to this country. He de
clared that the encroachment of the
! Chinese in California was an object les
j son for working people to consider in
: connect ion with expansion. He said
j the policy of governments possessing
i extended colonies was to civilize by
| force of arms. He thought the island
ers of the Pacific would enter into di-
I rect competition with American work-
I ing people very quickly if the expan
sion policy was adopted.
When a vote was finally taken the
I resolution was adopted with but three
or four dissenting votes.
Other work accomplished by the con
vention was the adoption of a resolu
1 tion to send an organizer into the
i Southern States during the coming
I year.
A resolution was adopted placing
the Federation on record In favor of
pending a representative of the Gov
ernment to the Peace Congress of Na
tions proposed by the Czar of Russia.
GENERAL BROOKE BEFORE
THE WAR INVESTIGATORS
Tells of Difficulties Encountered in
Equipping Men at Camp
Thomas.
I WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â Major General
John R. Brooke testified before the Wat
Investigation Commission to-day that
most of the volunteers at Camp Thomas
came supposedly with ten days' rations,
but this was the so-called field ration, and
at first they were hungry. This was
remedied by the commissary department
quite promptly. u -: ;; l
The volunteers were supplied with all
sorts of tentage, most of it antiquated,
their uniforms were old and their equip
ment in general was what had been ac
cumulated through the parsimonious pol
icy of the War Department throughout
the preceding twenty-five years. Some
were unarmed and some in their citizen's
clothing, with only one blanket.
The whole energies of the commanding
officer were bent on equipping this
heterogeneous mass of men, but the work
was necessarily slow. Early in June the
commanding general was ordered to send
eight of the best equipped regiments to
Tampa, and to do this it was necessary
i to strip some of the regiments to help out
others. Even with this expedient some
of the regiments left for Tampa poorly
| equipped. General Brooke noticed the
One Hundred and Fifty-seventh Indiana
Regiment, which left camp with its belts
tied together With strings. The War De
partment at this time had exhausted all
the canvas and tentage in the country.
Canteens, knives, forks, cups and the like
j were also short, and this condition, he
! said, continued practically up to the end
j of his administration at Camp Thomas.
Governor Beaver read a report from
I James Parker, sanitary inspector of the
I Twelfth New York Volunteers, detailing
1 an unprintable disgusting state of sani
tary affairs at Camp Thomas during Gen
eral Brooke's administration, and General
i Brooke was asked what he had to say
regarding It.
"I will say," he replied, "that it is not
only untrue, but if you will give me a
copy of that report I will see that that
young man goes before a court-martial
for those statements, unless he . is pro
tected in his testimony by this commis
sion."
SALE OF FIVE MILLION
GALLONS OF RED WINE
Big Deal Effected by the Managers

! meeting of the Wine-Makers' Corporation
was held here to-day. Henry J. Crocker
and \V. J. Hotchkiss. president and man
: ager respectively of the corporation, were
| present.
It was announced that a largo sale of
I wine had been made to an association of
i dealers in San Francisco, who purchased
j 5.000,000 gallons of red wine at prices rang
ing from 12V* cents to 15 cents a pallon.
The California Wine Association relin
quished its judgment of over $100,000 for !
about $10,000 cash. The corporation main- '
! tains its trade throughout the world. The '
< basis of the agn nient is that the dealers
and the wine-makers realize that harmony ,
I of interest will result In profit to all con- '
j cerned and place the wine industry of the !
State on a sounu basis. Under a Btrong â 
â  co-operation of the wine-growers and the '
I wine-makers. President Crocker an-
Bounced, the settled price of grapes wiU
be not less than $10 a ton, and fluctuations i
of the wine business will not extend to
; this branch. Money will be advanced to
i the full extent of the contract of 90 per
j cent of the growers' co-operation.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â The War
Department to-day made public the
formal order providing for tho military
government of Cuba. The notable
feature of the order is that Major Gen
eral Ludlow, who is designated as Mili
tary Governor of Havana city, while
nominally subordinate to the division
commander, General Brooke, is appar
ently charged to exercise all the civil
functions in that place, under the di
rect authority of the President. Gen
eral Lee's functions appear to be lim
ited to those of a strictly military char
acter, although it is said at the War
Department that he may be eventually
charged with all the duties, civil as
well military, of the Governor of a pro
vince. The text of the order is as fol
lows:
WAR DEPARTMENT,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 15.
By direction of the President, a division
to be known as the Division of Cuba, con
sisting of the geographical departments
and provinces of the island of Cuba, with
headquarters in the city of Havana, is
hereby created, under command of Major
General John R. Brooke, U. S. A., who,
in addition to the command of the troops
in the division, will exercise the authority
of Military Governor of the island.
Major General Fitzhugh Lee. U. S. V.,
commanding the Seventh Army Corps,
is assigned to the command of all the
troops in the province of Havana.
Malor General \V. A. Ludlow, IJ. S. V..
is designated as the Military Governor of
the city of Havana, and will report direct
to the division commander. He is charged
with nil that relates to the collection and
disbursement of the revenues of the. port
and city and its police, sanitation and
general government, under such regula
tions as may be prescribed by the Presi
dent. R. A. ALGER,
Secretary of War.
The commands of military depart
ments of the Division of Cuba, com
manded by General Brooke so far as
decided upon, are as follows:
Department of Pinar del RioâBriga
dier General O. W. Davis.
Department of Puerto PrincipeâGen
eral L. H. Carpenter.
Department of Santa Clara â G â Tal
Simon Snyder.
Department of Santiagoâ General
Leonard Wood.
This leaves the Provinces of Havana
and Matanzas unprovided for. These
commands probably will be left open
until the return of the President from
the South, but the probabilities are
strong that Major General Lee will be
assigned to the District of Havana and
Major General J. H. Wilson to the com
mand of the Department of Matanzas.
General Brooke, who has been in this
city in conference with the authorities
for several days past, will leave for
Cuba in ample time to be on hand when
the United States Government takes
formal possession of the Island on New
Year's day.

IN THE ISLANDS
Acquired as f a Result of

ROBERTS WRITES ON SUBJECT
SAYS EDIFICES DO NOT BELONG
TO THE CATHOLICS.
Suggests That the Property Forced
From the People by Spain
Should Be Suitably
Disposed Of.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â At a meet-
Ing of the National Christian Citizen
ship Convention a letter was read from
William Henry Roberts, a prominent
Presbyterian and secretary of the alli
ance of Reformed Churches, on the sub
ject of property in our newly-acquired
posessions. The letter says, in part:
Tn all these territories, acquired as a
result of the war with Spain, there were
largo properties which have been under
the control hitherto of the Roman Cath
olic church as the established church of
Spain and her colonies. These church
properties are claimed by the Roman
Catholic authorities, but, to a large ex
tent, with no show of right. There
doubtless are properties given by will or
direct personal donation under the con
trol of Roman Catholic church* authori
ties in Porto Rico and the Philippines,
but, in addition to such properties, there
are others, especially church edifices,
which were paid for out of the public
funds and maintained nt the expense of
the Spanish Government. The latter
properties are not those of the church
but of the people.
The ecclesiastical situation, therefore,
as it lies in many minds, is this- The
church property in Porto Rico and the
Philippines, being to a large extent the
property of the State, is not rightfully
the property of the Roman Catholic
church. The United States Government
therefore, should take possession of all'
church property, some one should care
fully determine what moiety o f It actu
ally belongs to the Roman Catholic
church, as such, and the Government
should retain the remainder under its
own control for the benefit of the peonies
of the new territories.
I would not advocate that the United
btates Government should take posses
slon of church property in the new ter
ritories, selling the same at public Â«-Ue
and placing the money In its own treas
ury-; but I do say that the people of this
new territory, in each of their cities ami
towns, should have an opportunity to de
tnrmine what use should be made of
th.-se church edifices. They were built
by money forced from the people by thl
oppressive methods of the Spanish Coy
ernment and they are moral! v and I
think, legally the property of" the In
habitants of these territories Let theâ¢
be a vote for instance, in each of th*
towns and parishes of Porto Rico at tÂ«

Sr>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, Dec. 15.â C. R. Eager,
president of the California Construc
tion Company, the contractors who are
to build the first two divisions of the
Monterey and Fresno Railroad, arrived
from San Francisco Tuesday night and
spent yesterday perfecting arrange
ments for an immediate beginning of
the construction of the railroad.
Mr. Eager was accompanied by A.
K. Whitton of San Jose, who is asso
ciated with the California Construction
Company in this contract. Quarters
for men and horses and offices for the
superintendents of the various depart
ments of the work were engaged and
facilities for landing and unloading
tools, lumber and machinery arranged
for.
The California Construction Company
has the contract to build and equip the
railroad from Monterey to Hollister and
to build an 1800-foot wharf at Monte
rey harbor. It will at once commence
work on the wharf. A large number
of piles are already on the ground, the
remainder and a very large lumber or
der being now en route from Puget
Sound. Pile drivers and other ma
chinery were shipped from San Fran-
Cisco to-day. Men and material for
treating the piles by a more improved
process arrived to-night and this part
of the work will be begun before the
close of the week.
Great activity is being caused here
by the work, and there is much en
thusiasm. Under the contract this
section of the railroad is to be com
pleted, equipped and delivered ready
for operation by June 15, 1599.
SALINAS, Dec. 15.â Work on the
construction of the Monterey and Fres
no Railroad will he commenced next
week. President Eager and Secretary
Whitton of the California Construction
Company pasped through Salinas for
Monterey, where two large two-story
houses have been engaged for work
men and several lots for the erection of
barns and sheds. Grading will be com
menced on January 3, and vigorously
prosecuted. Right-of-way has been ob
tained from all but a few who have
signified that they will give it when
the work has been started.
DUNNING AND
MRS, BOIKIN
Continued from First Page.
and felt lonesome at his leaving her.
While he was in the hotel they were al
ways together at all hours of the day and
night. They dined tog-ether. After Dun
ning left she spoke of him frequently and
sought all the information possible re
garding Cuba."
Mr. Knight commenced to question the
witness regarding her husband and as to
who was interested in the hotel with
her. He suddenly took another tack and
asked her If it was a reputable house: if
Mrp. Botkln had at all times conducted
herself as a lady, and if Dunning and her
self had separate apartments. To all of
these the witness replied in the affirma
tive. Then she was excused.
J. W. Erwin, a Postoffice inspector, suc
ceeded her. He Identified the "killer" or
canceling stamp used at Station D, foot
of Market street, as having been used to
cancel the stamps on the fateful package.
The stamps were canceled there, al
though the package might have been
mailed at some other station. He also
traced the deadly sweets on their jour
ney across the continent. The cancella
i tion shows neither date nor time.
J. D. Dunnigan, a mail clerk, proved an
. unwilling witness. He said that from the
start he tried to avoid being dragged into
the case. He testified to having noticed an
oblong box addressed "Mrs. John P. Dun
ning, Dover, Delaware." and the name
being similar to his own he examined
j the package carefully, and the circum
stances of seeing it were thus impressed
1 upon his memory.
To Mr. Knight he said he could not re
member any other package. Detective
1 McVey was the first person who spoke to
him about it. He went to the Postoffice in
company with Chief Lees, taking with
him an oblong box similar to that sent to
Delaware. He threw it on the table in the
mailAom and asked if any one could
: identify it. The witness kept out of the
way. "He did not want to g-et into the
case and did not want to go to Delaware
as this town was good enough for him "'
While the package was on the table he
did not go near it.
Knight asked, "Why?"
"Oh. because!" was the answer.
"Come, now," said Knight, "that's a
i woman's reason; give us a man's reason "
Knight also asked him to explain how
Chief Lees worked the gold brick game
on the clerks.
The witness said he finally was dragged
into the case against his will when De
tective McVey asked him dlrectlv as to
S any knowledge he had of the package
The witness ingenuously told how he had
given the detective attached to the Attor
ney General's office of Delaware what is
known in the language of the street as a
"steei."
"Sure it wasn't a cow?" said the ncr
sistent Knight. v
The witness was excused after telling
how the Delaware mail goes East in a
bag which contains the mail for several
small States.
There was a tremendous crush in the
corridor leading to the courtroom before
the opening of the afternoon session
Sheriff Whelan and a large staff of depu
ties handled the insistent crowd admira
bly and without friction.
Oscar A. Foster, a letter-carrier, was
the first witness. He testified to having
received an order for a change of address
from Mrs. Botkin. Mr. Knight submitted
this to the accused, and she acknowledged
having signed it.
Miss Heney was recalled and said she
had never seen the handkerchief or the
note that was found in the box of candy.
There was a small package wrapped in
paper on the counter when she wrapped
up the candy, and she had to push it
aside. It was not marked "poison."
There was a proee sion of candy girls
to and from the witness stand, until final
ly Mr. Knight called a halt. They were
all asked the same question, "i,d you
ever put any arsenic in candy at George
Haas' store?" They all replied, "No."
Mr. Knight finally said he worn; accept
it as having been proved that no poison
had been placed in the candy there,
whereupon the tide of femininity ceased
to flow to the witness chair.
Mrs. Birdie Price, landlady at Lie Vic
toria Hotel, was called. She knew lirs.
Botkin, who had a room at the hotel
wnen Mrs. Price purchased it. She re
mained there until August 4. with ex
ception of the period between July 27 and
30. The witness asked her where she
had been, but could not recall what an
swer she had received or any statement
she had made. Sne never knew Mrs.
Botkin to bleach any straw goods while
in the house. She met her on the stair
way between the hours of 3 and 4 o'clock
of the afternoon of July 31. She had
two or three packages wrapped in ordi
nary paper. She could not state the size,
but thought one of them was about the
size of a candy box.
The witness was surprised to see Mrs.
Botkin, as she had complained of being
ill that morning and had had her break
fast served in her room. She asked her
why the "Jap" was not permitted to got
her what she wanted, and she said she
had to do it herself. Mrs. Botkin finally
left the house on the afternoon of Aug
ust 4. She asked that her mall be sent
to Healdsburg.
To Mr. Knight the witness said she fixed I
the time of meeting Mrs. Botkin on the
stairs as being between 3 and 4 o'clock,
as she was downstairs to order dinner.
"U'hen Mrs. Botkin left she asked that her
room be rented only to transient lodgers,
as she wanted to come back to it again.
W. C. Rosello told of finding the piece
of seal supposed to have been on the
candy box. It was under the fringe of
a rug in the room. He was inspecting
the room at the time preliminary to rent
ing it.
Mr. Knig-ht took the witness in hand
and questioned him Bharply as to his oc
cupation. Ho said he was an advertising
solicitor and did odd jobs distributing ad
vertising matter. Lately he was doing
this for a downtown cafe. He showed
j one of his cards, which Mr. Knight handed '
j to his associate, Senator Frank McGowan.
i The latter found It contained an immoral
story, and Knight wanted to read it to
the Jury. Upon Mr. Hosmer's objection
Judge Cook would not permit it to ba
read aloud, but the Jurymen were allowed
to inspect it. The ladies In the courtroom
were preparing themselves to be properly
j shocked if the offensive document was
i read by Mr. Knight. He said his object
| in getting it before the jury was to show
I the kind of a man witness was. The witness
! said he saw the piece of seal glitter on the
j floor, picked it up and handed it to Mr.
Barnes, clerk of the hotel, who said: "I
guess I had better keep this. It may have
dropped off the box bought by Mrs. Bot-
I kin." The witness said he did not know
I any of the police officials and had never
j made a statement in the case before.
W. W. Barnes, clerk at the Victoria,
| testified to going to room 26 with Rosello
and of the finding of the seal. He contra
dicted Rosello as to the disposal of the
piece of seal. The former said Barnes
took it, while Barnes said Rosello asked
him to take it to the police.
Knight asked Barnes if his duties ag
I clerk of the hotel included washing the
i windows, cleaning the rooms and such
duties. He asked him if he knew the hus
band of Mjts. Price, the landlady. The
witness declined to answer on the ground
that it had{ nothing to do with this case.
Knight a*ked him, in surprise, "You
j don't inteno. to pass on the testimony, do
I you?" He !<lid not follow the matter up,
i apparently ror fear of prejudicing his case
before the .Jury.
The case will be continued this morning
at 10 o'clocft.

Mr?. Stanford, in her report, states that
all debts against the estate of the de
ceased millionaire have been fully paid,
satisfied and discharged by her, aggre
gating: the sum of $1,182,173 S2; that the
amount of legacies under the last will
an.i testament of Iceland Stanford was
15.115,000, all of which have been fully paid
and discharged. In conclusion the execu
trix states that "the administration of
the estate was greatly delayed and em
barrassed by reason of various litigation
ami principally by reason of the so-called
Government suit by the United States
against the estate to recover the sum of
H5.25.000 or thereabouts. All of the liti
gation has at last been finally determined
and disposed of in favor of the estate.
with the exception of the so-called in
heritance tax case, which is still pending
in the Supreme Court of this State."
Regarding the inheritance tax, Mrs.
Stanford, in her report, further states
that she is ready and willing and offers
to forthwith plnce in the Union Trust
Company of this city on special deposit
tho sum of $230,000 for the purpose of fully
paying and discharging the tax if it b*e
declared l*gal by the Supreme Court, and
if the tax be declared illegal, then Mrs.
Stanford asks that the money bÂ« dis
tributed to persons lawfully entitled
thereto.

IT LOOKS BLACK
FOR BLACKMAN
EVIDENCE AGAINST THE DIS
GRACED POLICEMAN.
His Case and That of Saloon-Keepei
Rood, His Alleged Accomplice,
Continued Till Tuesday.
Policeman Cassius Blackman and
Frank H. Rood, saloonkeeper on Valencia
street, were arraigned in Judge Mogan'a
court yesterday on the charge of grand
larceny. Blackman was represented by
Attorneys Wilson and Sweeney and Rood
by Attorney M. C. Hassett. The cases
were, by consent, continued till next Tues
day. Rood is out on $3000 bonds, and at
the request of Blackman's attorneys the
Judge reduced his bonds to $2000.
Blackman's arrest has caused a pro
found sensation throughout the depart
ment, as it is looked upon as a reflection
upon all those sworn to protect the lives
and property of citizens and visitors.
There is a hope that he will be able to
prove his Innocence, not particularly for
his own sake but for the esprit de corps
of the department. Captains Seymour
and Gillen. who have charge of the case,
are determined that he shall be punished,
if guilty, ami the proof they have ob
tained points that way.
Two additional witnesses cam" forward
yesterday and made statements to the po
lice. John Halm, 136 San Carlos avenue,
was the man that Cornelius Cronin. the
victim, thought was following him to rob
him. He went into Rood's saloon with
Cronin, Blackman and Special Officer
Murphy and saw Cronin count out his
money and give it to Rood at Blackman's
suggestion. He heard Cronin and Rood
mention the amount as $255.
The other witness is W. E. McNamee, 16
Dearborn street. He went into Rood's
saloon while Cronin, Blackman and Halm
were there. He saw Cronin count the
money, ten $20 gold pieces, a $10 gold piece,
a $5 gold piece and he thought 130 In
greenbacks, and hand it to Rood, who put
ft in a cigar box. He walked with the
others as far as Sixteenth street on their
way to the Valencia Hotel. Blackman
told him to say nothing about it. as re
porters might get onto the business.
It is nearly sixteen years since a mem
ber of the department was arrested for a
similar crime. Policeman Langtry was
then the culprit. He was caught steal
ing silks from a warehouse on the water
front He was sentenced to nine years
in State prison.

"At the time Miss Schaefer made those
assertions she was not in the employ of
the Red Cross," said the president, "and
our ladies are very much annoyed that
the young- woman should have given such
an interview, giving to it, ut> she does, the
impression that she is speaking- for the
society. Miss Schaefor became Pick as
soon as she reached Manila and has not
done any work since she has been there.
We pent her there and when she left she
did so of her own accord and without any
order or authorization from the society
here. Hence she voluntarily severed her
connection with the Red Cross the mo
ment that she turned her face homeward,
so the interviews from Honolulu must be
taken as those of a private Individual and
not of one of our employes. None of the
reports that we have received from our
employes at Manila give any such gloomy
accounts of the condition of the soldiers
there, and until we hear something: be

disposed to think that matters are as
serious as she would have the public be

By Joe Corbett.
The last time the Gilt Edges played
here it was announced previous to the
date set for the contest that "Jay 11
Hughes, Baltimore"s star twirler of last
season, was to pitch for the above named
team. As baseballdom is aware, Mr.
Hughes failed to put in an appearance,
and many of those who went to Recrea
tion Park purposely to see him came
away disappointed and in a few cases dis
satisfied.
Mr. Hughes, on seeing his cognomen in
the line-up, immediately telegraphed me
that he had not authorized any person to
use his name In connection with the pro
â  posed contest and did not intend to pitch.
The telegram, like the "pardon," came too
late. Mr. Hughes, however, has evidently
heard that the San Francisco public was
greatly disappointed in not seeing him
perform on the occasion In Question, and
writes the following letter in explana
tion, which 1 take great pleasure in pub
lishing:
Mr. Joe Corbett, Baseball Editor Callâ Friend
Joe: i would like to oner to you and to the
baseball-loving public of California, and par
ticularly (.â Â£ San Francisco, who have always
treated me so kindly and fairly In the past.
not an apology but a mere explanation of the
facts rt-garding my non-appearance with the
Gilt Edges against the Walauiivilles.
At the end of the National league season I
was completely worn out from the physical
and moral strain attendant upon a young
pitcher's lirst year In the great league, and felt
nappy at the promise of rest I had made my
self upon my return home to my friends In
Pacramento. 1 had found, however, that the
record ot my work had preceded me, and my
friends thought me better than I really felt
mjself. To satisfy their desire to see me work
1 consented to pitch one game, but informed
the Gilt Edge management that I needed rest
and would pitch no more this season.
I was, therefore, very much surprised to see
myself advertised to pitch agttmst the 'Watson
vUlea and inquired of the Oilt Edge manage
ment if they had sent in my name. They In
formed me that they had not. I Immediately
wired your paper and the Chronicle that my
name had been used by mistake, as I did not
feW that I waa in condition to do myself or my
old-time colleagues Justice. I did this merely
to set myself right before the San Francisco
public, thinking that perhaps some few of my
friends might go out to see me play.
I am at a loss to understand who is responsible
for advertising my name in the list of Gilt
Edge players, but feel certain that It was not
the Gilt Edge management.
I address you this now, as I have been In
formed that several of my San Francisco
friends were dissatisfied at not seeing me, and
to state positively that it was through no fault
of mine that they or the San Francisco public
may have felt themselves disappointed at my
non-appearance.
If you can find space for the above In your
muchly appreciated paper I will deem it an
especial favor. Believe me, yours' very truly,
JAY HUGHES.

linger the direction of the Pacific Coast
League few are as accomplished In the
many departments of the game as Mr.
McCarthy. Wt fielder for the Athletics".
This gentleman, since his return from the
Western League, has been playing some
beautiful ball and doing some really clever
all-around work at Recreation Park, but
owing to the fact that he possesses the art
of making easy plays out of those chances
which would be most difficult to the or
dinary fielder, he has been overlooked to
a certain extent by those who writ*? up
and patronize the games. Until last Sun
day's great game between the Athletics
and Watsonvilles McCarthy never ha.l
an opportunity to do anything really bril
liant; this because, as I said before, he
made difficult chances appear easy. But
ballplayers, like other folks, are generally
presented with an opportunity and Mc-
Carthy's came last Sunday. He was play
ing his usual positionâ left Held.
The Watsonvilles had two men on
bases and there were two out. If those
two men could cross the plate a game
would be decided, and the batsman stead
ied himself for the ordeal. A straight
ball came tearing over the heart of the
plate. The batsman with a mighty and
well directed swing met it squarely, and
far out in the direction of the left field
fence it sailed. For a second no one
thought of that ball being headed off in
its winning flight. It appeared as though
it would nit the fence on the fly, and
merely to watch its course I stood up
with the rest, when spinning along as
though propelled by some hidden power
could be seen the form of McCarthy go
ing like mad after the sphere. He seemed
to know the exact spot the ball would
strikeâ an art familiar only to the tjreat
fielderâ and as if by instinct turned and
captured the expected winning hit.
Immense applause greeted this perform
ance, and I will say that the San Fran
cisco rooters appreciate good work and
are not slow in displaying their pleas
ure. This is the first brilliant play Mc-
Carthy is credited with since joining the
Athletics. But it is not the first gTeat
play he has made. Many times he has
captured balls which, were it not for his
ability, would have been called brilliant
plays.
He is one of the few fielders who does
not cater to grand stand work, a trait to
bo admired in any man. Besides be
ing an excellent fielder, McCarthy is what
might be properly termed a "crackerjack"
base runner. His performances in this
department of the game have often won
him applause. In the Western League
his ability to pilfer the cushions was sec
ond to none, and back there In that
league, where many fine players roam, he
is considered a "star" of the first magni
tude.
The Frisco fans are a bit slow some
times in recognizing good work. Per
haps it is on account of the many poor
exhibitions that grace our diamonds, and

SCHOOL BOORD BOODLING.
THE suggestion that the coming Legislature
ought to pass a law providing that State Normal
schools, in addition to granting diplomas to
teachers, shall present each graduate with $400 with
which to buy an appointment is one that under ex
isting conditions requires some attention.
Certainly n berths in the School Department are
to be sold in the future as they have been in the past
some such statute as this will be necessary to place
educators upon an even footing. It is apparent that
a teacher graduated by the Normal schools who is
possessed of $400 has an advantage at present over
one not so equipped.
But will existing conditions continue indefinitely?
The Board of Education now in charge of school
affairs in this city has sold positions, loaded down
the payroll of the department, wasted the public
money on collusive contracts and bartered away the
property of the schools. It has been guilty of all
sorts of crimes in addition to trafficking in teachers'
certificates. But its career will end on January 2
next. Is it possible that the people of San Francisco
will stand a repetition of this history?
We are opposed to the passage of a law such as has
been suggested because we hope the people of this
city will never again suffer the affliction of a corrupt
and debased Board of Education. During a period of
twenty-five years there has been but one gang of
boodlers at all comparable with those now in charge
of the School Department. They comprised what was
known as the "tough old board." The new charter
abolishes elective School Directors, and Boards of
Edrcation which will be created after that instrument
goes into effect will be appointed by the Mayor. If
the Mayor ever places in power such debased
wretches as comprise the present Board of Educa
tion the people can take him out and hang him. As
things are the people can only hold themselves re
sponsible. They elected the School Board boodlers,
and all they can do is to hang them or hang them
selves.
On the whole it is better to live in hope than to
despair. The Normal schools are graduating too
many teachers, and it each one were provided with
$400 with which to purchase a position from a bood
ling School Board, we should soon be eaten up with
pedagogues â for we presume that every time that
amount was oit'ered it would be accepted and a posi
tion created.
While such a statute might equalize the situation of
Normal School graduates, it would in the end pro
duce financial anarchy for the taxpayers. We would,
however, regard with some favor a statute which
would make an appropriation for tar and feathers
with which to tre;it every miserable wretch who
boodles with the school funds.
LOST IN THE SHUFFLE.
A REPORT from Atlanta is to the effect that the
President stated while reviewing the troops in
that city. "I otdered a brigade sent to Atlanta,
and thought it was here."
When a general loses so much as a regiment he
is apt to obtain knowledge of the fact, and
here is the commander-in-chief of the army
losing a brigade and not being aware of the loss un
til he went to the spot where he supposed the brigade
to be. and found that the brigade was not on the
spot. Somebody had sent it away.
In civil life there prevails the idea that a brigade
is so large that to lose it is a matter of difficulty.
Perhaps if the President were to put detectives on the
track of his missing brigade he could corral it At
least if anybody happen to observe it cavorting
among the cotton-fields of the South, a notification
should be sent to the President. Possibly the brigade
has wandered so far that it has not heard about the
war being over, and it may do something rash.
We suggest that the Pasidcnt cause to be inserted
in the papers of Atlanta an advertisement something
like this: "Lost, strayed or stolenâ One brigade.
When last seen w^'.s wearing blue uniforms, carrying
weapons and giv**n to martial music. Any informa
tion leading to the discovery of the same will be
thankfully received by William McKinley."
The latest man to commit murder and ?ttempt
suicide hereabouts seems to have been embarrassed
by the fact that to blow out the quality of brains with
which he was equipped is not a particularly dangerous
operation.
Many people who do not favor the retention of the
Philippines on principle are worrying as to a safe
method of letting go, and probably Uncle Sam, in
contemplation of the problem, is acquiring new
wrinkles.

script, "Burn this letter."
THE VOLUE OF COMMERCIAL HONOR.
THE seizure of a large quantity of California
adulterated wine in Mexico is a very serious
matter.
The wine interest of this State has tens of millions
of dollars invested in it, and its prosperity requires a
wide market outside our own borders.
The shipper of the adulterated product from Los
Angeles should be held to a strict account for his
offense.
Navarro, the dealer in the City of Mexico, whose
goods were seized, says of the affair that he asso
ciated with a couple of young business men in Los
Angeles in the importation to Mexico of wines from
that locality. This implies a partnership, with the
Los Angeles members thereof engaged in shipping
to their partner in Mexico for the joint account and
profit of the firm. If this be so, there should be an in
quiry to ascertain whether this commercial partner
ship is responsible for the sophistication of the wine
in which it dealt, or whether it was made the victim
of the vintner or blender.
More than any other State in the Union. California
requires strict observance of commercial honor on
tiie part of those who deal in her characteristic
products. There is a profitable market for every
pound of our dried and canned fruits and for every
pint of our wines and brandies, provided they are sent
to the consumer in strictly first-class and wholesome
condition.
Our fruit products are largely luxuries, and in this
country and the countries with which we are in com
mercial touch there are enough consumers who want
them, and in good times and bad are able to pay a
first-class price for a first-class article, to take all that
we can send. In regard to our horticultural products,
there need seldom be a time of depression if our pro
ducers and dealers will bear this fact in mind. The
California vintage is old enough to be thoroughly un
derstood. There is no lack of experience in fermenta
tions, in their peculiarities produced by local causes:
nor is experience lacking as to the localities in the
State fitted for the growing of special classes of wine.
Asa wine country the State is spotted, just as all wine
regions are. The same quality of wine cannot be
grown everywhere from the same grape. Nor can
all kinds of wine, red and white, sweet and dry,
clarets, ports, Reislings and Sauternes, be grown in
the same vineyard, under common conditions. One
thing that cast suspicion upon our whole wine pro
duction was the attempt to do this.
It is now known that for first-class dry. red wines
of the Bordeaux type, which we call clarets, a .name
unknown in France, the cooler and moister climates,
near the coast and around the bay, must be sought,
and not the arid and hot localities in the interior val
leys and Southern California. The latter will pro
duct ports, sherries and the alcoholic wines, but not
claret. When an attempt is made to grow a wine in
a region not suited to it. its defects are overcome by
some form of sophistication, of adulteration.
The Viticultural Commission did a great work in
locating the various wines in the field suited to their
production, thereby removing the temptation to over
come the loss of a mislocation by adulteration. While
that commission was in existence it checked adultera
tion and spread abroad a fund of knowledge and a
spirit of commercial honor in the wine business.
It is not many years since salicylic acid was re
garded as an innocuous antiseptic agent in canned
fruits, and no doubt it was for a time largely used in
such fruits. It is known noV, however, that, taken
in food or drink, it produces diabetes and various dis
orders of the liver and kidneys. Instead of being a
harmless antiseptic it is a dangerous poison. Its
use as an adulterant of wine or cider is to arrest fer
mentation. The natural fermentations of dry wines
will continue tor three years. They are the means of
constant purification and preparation of the wine for
use by freeing it of organic matter. When they are
arrested by this adulterant they go to the consumer
charged with its poison, but carrying also the danger
ous organic matter which should be precipitated by
fermentation.
One cannot conceive of a viler dose than such wine.
The man who prepares and sends it to the consumer
is not only an enemy of the commerce of his State
and a destroyer of every vine in its vineyards, but he
is an assassin, aiming a deadly blow at human life
and killing people by the most sinister and dreadful
form in which disease can assail man.
There is on trial in this city a woman charged
with killing two people in a distant State by sending
to them arsenic through the mails in candy. If she
be guilty, she is less guilty than the men who are
killing their kind in distant communities and coun
tries by sending to them a worse and slower poison
in these adulterated wines through the channels of
commerce. The victims of arsenical poisoning had a
few hours of agony and entered upon peace. The vic
tims of salicylic wine enter upon months and some
times years of agony, enduring the misery of chronic
nephritis, finally to die in the convulsions of uremic
poisoning.
The authors of this commercial dishonor and
adulteration are guilty of a greater variety of crimes
than the arsenical poisoner. If she be guilty, her mo
tive was not sordid gain, but arose in human weak
ness and passion uncurbed.
But the wine adulterator kills for gain, to add to
his profits. While he is murdering scores of con
sumers to increase his wealth, he is impoverishing
scores of producers by casting the virulent shadow of
commercial dishonor upon the production which is
their means of living.
Along his track stalk the gaunt specters of disease
and poverty, his sin falls upon the innocent, and his
victims fill the madhouse, the poorhousc and the
charnel-house. He is a conspirator against the
health and happiness, the food and shelter, of human
ity, and should be marked for every man's detesta
tion and be made to feel the penalties of the out
rnged law.
Th|E MUNICIPAL LEAGUE.
WITH the organization of the League of Cali
fornia Municipalities a movement has been
started which, if wisely directed and pushed
forward with proper energy, will result in great bene
fit to the State. There are undoubtedly many ways in
which such an organization can be of service to the
general good, and particularly so to that of the
smaller municipalities.
The programme of work proposed by the organiza
tion is a comprehensive one, but in no respect does it
go beyond the rightful limits of the energies of such
an association. As set forth in the constitution the
purposes of the league are to promote a systematic
collection of information relating to municipal af
fairs: to foster the exchange of suggestions between
municipalities on matters of interest; to prepare and,
so far as possible, influence legislation necessary to
proper municipal administration and growth, and to
generally interest the public in and advocate all ideas
tending to bring the municipalities of California
abreast of the best municipalities of the country.
Conventions of the representatives of municipal
governments are common in the East. There exists
a great national association there under whose direc
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1898.
tion such conventions are held, and their annual
meetings are matters of considerable note owing to
the importance of the subjects discussed. These con
ventions, however, are too far away to be generally
attended by delegates from California cities and
towns. A local league is therefore a necessity of the
situation, and promises to prove as effective here as
the larger gatherings representing the great cities
beyond the Rockies.
It is significant that the first mover in the work of
organizing the California league is the Mayor of one
of the smallest of our municipalities, Mr. D. O.
Druffel of Santa Clara. It is in the smaller commu
nities that the need of co-operation for municipal
improvement is most strongly felt, and the movement
coming from that source is more likely to be strongly
backed up and supported by the cities and towns of
the interior than if it had been originated in San
Francisco.
McKINLEY f3T fTTLfINTA.
BY his speech at Atlanta President McKinley has
once more strikingly illustrated his happy
faculty of saying the right thing at the right
time and in the right way. With a simple appeal to a
sentiment sacred among Southerners, and one with
which the North can and does sympathize, he made
manifest the restored unity of the people of both
sections better than could have been done in any
other way by the utmost elaboration of studied
phrases.
Alter speaking of the loyalty of the South dis
played during the war with Spain and the cordial
recognition of that loyalty by the people of the
North, the President turned from the living to the
dead and spoke of the valor of the Confederate sol
dier, claiming the memory of the courage of the men
who followed Lee and Johnson as a precious pos
session of the history of the whole country. Then,
while his Southern audience listened with profound
emotion, he said:
"Every soldier's grave made during the unfortunate
Civil War is a tribute to American valor. And while,
when those graves were made, we differed widely
about the future of the Government, those differences
were long ago settled by the arbitrament of arms â
and the time has now come in the evolution of sen
timent and feeling under the providences of God
when, in the spirit of fraternity, we should share with
you in the care of the graves of the Confederate sol
diers."
It did not need the reports from Atlanta to tell us
that these words were greeted with an outburst of
loud and prolonged cheering. No sentiment is more
universal among men, nor more profoundly felt
by heroic peoples, than that of reverence for their
dead who died on the field of battle, ai.d when the
President* of the redeemed Union, a representative of
the victors in the great Civil War, spoke these noble
words of the Southern dead, it goes without saying
that the great heart of the South responded with
rapturous acclamations.
It has been the good fortune of President McKin
ley to be a peacemaker among his countrymen. lie
has allayed the antagonisms of politics that at one
time threatened to array labor against capital, the
debtor class against the creditor; he has removed
the bitterer irritations of political strife, has restored
prosperity to all forms of industry and by his readi
ness to accept Southern loyalty and to honor South
ern valor and military skill during the recent war he
has now established the mutual confidence of North
and South and reawakened a patriotism as clear and
ardent as that which animated the people of all sec
tions in the old days when they fought together for
the republic in 1776 and in 1812.
The occasion of the President's visit to Atlanta was
to attend a jubilee given in that city in celebration of
the victories of our arms during the war with Spain.
By his speech he has made it the occasion of a great
national rejoicing. The Northern man was in a
Southern city, but they were not alien to one another.
They had a common sentiment which bound them in
the strongest cords of harmony, and that sentiment
was a mutual love and reverence for the heroic dead
who illustrated American valor and fidelity to prin
ciple during the war that freed the slave and kept the
Union whole.
WHILE disclaiming the possession of any ac
curate statistics on the subject, the Boston
journal asserts that good reasons exist for be
lieving that the westward travel of tourists from the
Eastern States during the winter has now become
about equal to that which goes eastward to Europe
every summer. In other words, domestic travel
among the scenes of our own land has become as
fashionable as foreign travel.
It was not always so. At a time comparatively re
cent the Eastern man of means and culture felt that
he must go to Europe, but had no desire whatever to
see what he called "the wild and woolly West." Our
rich people went abroad to build up and support
European resorts, and our own romantic localities
were left unvisited and almost unknown. The change
that has come is beneficial all round and promises to
be permanent. Commenting upon it the Journal
says:
"With the exception of those who find unique at
tractions in the social or artistic companies of Lon
don and Paris and Rome, Americans spend the win
ter in their own country. This is better both for the
United States and for the people themselves. It has
resulted, on this hand, in the growth of luxurious
winter communities in the far West and in the
South. The balm of the climate of Florida and South
ern California has reached across the sea. On the other
hand, the result has been a rising interest in the almost
infinite resources of the land between the Atlantic
and the Pacific. Keeping in mind the vast riches yet
undeveloped, the steady improvement in means of
transportation and the ceaseless increase of popula
tion, we can see no end to this."
If our Boston contemporary is right in its esti
mate of the change in travel, both the East and the
West are to be congratulated. If the West gains by
having a large influx of Eastern tourists, the East also
gains by acquiring a better knowledge of the re
sources of our country. When these advantages are
fully understood the wise American will probably be
content to remain in his own land and quit being a
lounger in Europe.
Why a Kings County Judge should have gone to
the trouble to sentence a burglar to the penitentiary
for thirty days perhaps the Judge knows. About all
the execution of the sentence will amount to will be
a pleasant excursion and a free haircut.
Members of the School Board have once more been
accused of bribery, but they do not seem much wor
ried. There is nothing like being used to a thing.
Evidently Mr. Bryan exploded before the Exam
iner's justly celebrated National Policy had been
brought to his attention.
Alger seems to think that a soldier can stand al
most anything but a trip through San Francisco.

MORE RAIN COMING.
Indications Are ThÃt the Fall Will
Continue To-Night.
Although the skies have cleared and
: the rain is apparently over. Weather
Forecaster Hammon still has hopes that
there will be more before the week has
passed. Signs are in such a condition that
nothing can be told more than twenlv
' four hours ahead, yet the bureau is uufte
confident that rain will again begin to
i fall some time to-night.
The area of high pressure is still at
: Idaho Falls, but the barometer is still
steadily falling there. An area of low
pressure is central in the British posses
sions north of North Dakota. Another
small low area is central in Southern
California. This latter has moved to the
i southeastward and so caused the general
; rain throughout the State.
The weather has cleared behind the
â â  storm, but conditions are not favorable
to its continuing so. It is probable that
rain will again occur in Northern Cali
fornia by to-night.

WITHDREW FBOM THE BAZAAR
The Pavilion Charity Fair Said to Be
Tottering.
According to all accounts the Charity
Bazaar at the Mechanics' Pavilion is in
financial shoalwater.
At a meeting of the officers of the
several charity societies held on Wed
nesday evening it was practically
decided to withdraw their organizations,
but the final decision was left until yes
terday noon, when the word to quit was
passed along the line of the following or
ganizations: Children's Day Home, Eu
reka Boy?' Home, Children's Home-Find
ing Society, Francesca Relief Society,
Florence Crlttenden Home, San Fran
cisco Lying-in Hospital and Foundling
Society, Sisters of Mercy and Old La
dies' Home.
Secretary VTadham of the. Eureka so
i ciety states that the executive board
1 was dissatisfied with the manner in
1 which the bazaar was being con
[ ducted. Captain J. Ch. de St. Hu
j bert was the first manager, and he
failed to meet the bills as they became
1 due. He turned the bazaar over to Mr.
i Barley, who placed T. P. Robinson and
Samuel Loverioh in as managers. The
Litter have undertaken to convert the ba
j zaar into a fake institution, so V.'adham
| says, by Introducing a walking match or
something of the kind. The same author
ity states that the labor is not paid and
; bills are coming in at an alarming rate
: His society has not been able to get even
on the outlay necessary for representa
, tion.

WM. J. DUTTON, Vice President.
BERNARD FAYMONVILLE. Secretary.
Subscribed and sworn to before me this 15th
day of January. 1898. M. M. RHORER.
Deputy Insurance Commissioner.U. S. GRANT'S BID FOR
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT
Made an Offer to Resign One Year After His
Election to the United States
Senate.
Threatened to Make "Trouble" for the Party if His
Wishes Were Disregarded Respecting the
Selection of a Northern Man for
Governor.
N<m that it has been shown that one of I
7. S. Grant's first political acts after he
had acquired a residence in California was |
to lend his moral and financial support !
to the cause of Bryan and free silver the j
Republican members of the Legislature in J
this end of the State are united in saying ,
that he deserves little at the hands of !
the party and will receive less.
This feeling is accentuated by the fact
that at the recent election Grant and his \
managers in the extreme southern part
of the State knifed the Republican State
ticket in order to secure votes for his leg- !
islative candidates. So extensive were !
their transactions in trading votes to Ma- j
gulre in return for votes fur their legls- '
lative nominees that Gage ran about a '
thousand votes behind his ticket in San
Diego County alone. This would have
been sufficient to defeat the Republican
ticket had the result in other parts of the
State been as close as in the election of
two years ago, when Grant lent his ef- !
forts to promoting the cause of Bryan and
free silver.
That the trading of votes by Gran: was
deliberate and premeditated and w.is part
of a plan formed long prior to the election
is made evident by the threats uttered
by the young man and his p. iiticai man- !
Wilton J. Green, prior to the hold- !
invention at Sacra
mento. About the time the plan of giv- i
ing a southern man the Gubernatorial
nomination was being discussed Mr ;
If/I?? 1 vvll?v vll? i ted Makersiield in the Interest
â â  nal candidacy. He
f\t iv lir " :; - wl) spokesman
say to
in reporter relative to the talk
oi a bouthern man for Governor:
That is a scheme that originated in
the North, and it may as well be un
derstood once for all that the South
cannot have a Governor thrust upon
her. The South don't -want the Gov
ernorship and if the plan you name
should be carried out there will be
trouble. The South wants a man in
the Senate and if the Republican par
ty wants harmony it will not insist
in trying to force the Gubernatorial
nomination south of Tehachapi.
That was Mr. Grant's wav of thinking
prior to the holding of the State conven
tion. Note the result The Republican
party did Insist on naming- a Southern
max. for Governor. -Mr. Grant then car
ried out his threat to create "trouble"
by doing' his best to defeat that candi
date. Having failed to accomplish his
purpose; through no fault of his own. he
now comes forward and renews his claim
to recognition at the hands of the party
he has done his utmost to defeat at two
successive general electionsâ that is to
pay, during his term of residence ip. the
State. A fine record, surely, for a nan
who is still unfamiliar with the geography
of the State, whose legislators he is ap
parently seeking to corrupt with money
furnished by Eastern capitalists who
profit by legislation that is adverse to the
interests of California.
It may be of Interest to the legislators
who will soon be called upon to choose a
United States Senator to know a few of
the schemes this brilliant young man so
recently arrived from beyond the moun
tains has attempted to put into execution
in order to delude the general public and
secun for himself what he la pleased to
ca-1 his "ambition." Some time ago M:
Gram approached a gentleman who is
1 '.orninent in the councils of the Republi
c-m party and Fought his support. Tills
1* 'I.- proposition he made:
"I have an ambition to be United
States Senator. If you will lend your in
iiuence and support to secure my election
I will serve one year in Congress and
then resign in your favor."
The gentleman to whom the offer was
made replied that he -was not In the busi
ness of assisting unknown young men to
gratify personal ambitions at the expense
of the people of the State. He also said
much more to the same effect and Mr.
Grant was dismissed with the assurance
that he would do well to let "crooked"
politics alone II he wished to retain the
respect of decent men. If Mr. Grant has
a sufficient disregard for the truth to deny
the assertion that he made the above
mentioned proposition the name of the
gentleman will be given, as well as some
additional particulars regarding the in
terview.
Mr. Grant has been in the State but a
comparatively short time and he is totally
unacquainted with the needs of the peo
ple. While claiming to be a Republican
he has endeavored to defeat the men put
forward by the party as Its representa
tives and the representatives of Its prin
ciples. With such a recommendation he
comes forward with a political manager
and a horde of salaried strikers and de
mands the highest honor In the gift of the
party. There are other menâ good Repub
licans, who have spent the better part
of their lives in promoting the interests of
th<> State and advancing the principles of
the partyâ who have also signified their
desire to represent the State in the coun
cils of the nation's law-makers. They
know the needs tit the State as a mother
knows those of her children. Many of
them are comparatively poor men who

A FARCICAL PROCEEDING.
Judge Low. Dismisses the Assault to
Murder Case of Walter Nagle. .
Judge Low enacted the farce yesterday
of dismissing the, case of Walter Nagl â .
accused of assault to murder, on . - the
ground that there was not sufficient evi
dence to hold him. Nagle was charged,
along with John Bulger, with striking
Policeman C. M. Barnes on the head in
September last, inflicting a dangerous
wound. Both were arrested and the cases
were assigned to Judge Low's court.
Owing to persistent continuances, As
sistant District Attorney Dunne, who
watched the cases on behalf of Barnes,
took the matter before the Grand Jury a
i few days ago nun indictments were grant
!ed against Bulger and Nagle. They were
1 arrested on Superior Court warrants,' but
Nagle got out on bonds. â  Bulger is in the
County Jail, being unable to obtain
bonds, and Judge Low yesterday, after
disposing of Nagle's case, ordered the
Sheriff to bring Bulger into his court to
day, as he desired to dispose of his case
: also. He gives as a reason that he has

Jacob H. Neff Will Soon Settle Down
to the Task of Selecting
Senate Standing Com
mittees.
There was the usual throng of the ex
pectant in the corridors of the Palace
Hotel yesterday. Some of the callers ex
pected to see Jacob H. Neff, Lieutenant
Governor elect, and others were happy
to see Major Frank Mclaughlin. Mr.
Neff arrived in the city Wednesday even
ing, but will leave town for Colfax to-day.
He will return before many days go by
and settle down to the work of composing
the Senate standing committees or the
I chairmanships thereof.
Howard Wright, whose election to the
I position of Speaker of the Assembly is
assured, has not completed the standing
committees of that branch of the Legis
lature. He has received a good many
hints concerning the preferences of mem
bers, but has not yet perceived that there
is strife 1 for particular chairmanships.
There are four applicants for the first
place on the Ways and Means Commit
tee. The prospective Speaker is not ready
to announce the name of the chairman of
this committee.
11. Z. Osborne of the executive commit
tee of the Republican . State Committee
arrived in the city from Los Angeles yes
terday and had the pleasure of meeting
Major McLaughlin. Mr. Osborne - re
marks that his present visit is in the line
of official duty and has no bearing what
ever on politics or political patronage.
i Walter S. Parker and Frank P. Flint
of the executive committee â â¢ may arrive
', i rom Los Angeles:, to-day. Unfinished
business of the campaign may require the
attention of the committee. -
; Recruits are daily joining the army of
applicants for places under the new ad
ministration of State affairs. - The ad
'< jutant generalship is regarded as the first
j prize. There is talk that Governor Gage
i will follow the example of Eastern i Gov-
e rnors and class this appointment as one
I pertaining to the executive. Word comes
from Southern California that Captain
Cross is making a gallant tight for the
place. The ideal adjutant general is diffi
cult to find. He ought to be brave, yet
modest. He should be ; well educated and
polite. He should .know something of
modern military tactics and a good deal
about the ancient customs of military
courtesy. As the representative of the
: Governor at certain social and military
functions he should be able to make a
: speech creditable to the State and tho
: National Guard. He should introduce cor
i rect business methods in the office and
feel that it is not beneath his dignity to
do a little of the office work toward earn
! ing his salary- â 
There is a good crop of candidates for
the office of Commissioner of Labor Sta
tistics. The office has never accomplished
under any administration a particle of
good for the laboring men of this State,
and probably never will; but it is a good
thing for the holder, and the number will-
Ing to hold it is legion.
Attaches of the Legislature, under the
new law, are to hold statutory positions,
and it is said that selections will be made
in caucus of each branch of the Legis
lature. There are many applicants for
the clerical positions, although the com
pensation has been materially diminished.
It seems to be settled that Frank Brandon
will be chosen as secretary of the Senate
j and Major Kyle as chief clerk of the
! Assembly.

THE DRIFT OF INTEREST.
Henry Clew's New York circular says:
â The movement among the savings banks to
reduce their rate of interest on deposits nat
urally attracts attention as a factor bearing
upon* the value of securities. In recent years
their interest allowance has averaged 4 to 4%
per cent. It is now proposed to reduce the
rato to 3% per cent, which would represent a
cutting down of fully one-eighth, or 12% per
cent, in the interest earnings of these insti
tutions. The proposition is a marked evidence
of the tendency toward a decline in the earn
ings of capital, which has been long evident
in the inter. rate of the national banks, as
well as in real estate mortgages and new M
sues of railroad bonds. The significance of this
tendency to the stock market is very evident.
For, so far as the rate of interest is reduced,
the relative value of the principal is Increased;
and thus stocks having a fixed dividend rate
of Fay 4 or 5 per cent bring a higher price just
In proportion as the difference between their
rate and the current average interest rate
widens. Besides a reduction in th* Interest re
turn of any given Investment has a tendency
to Induce the holder to realize upon his se
curity and Invest in something that yields a
better result . and it so happens that railroad
stocks are the principal available resource for
making such reinvestments. Upon the same
principle we find the current demand for rail
road mortgages running largely upon a grade
of 4 per cent bonds selling at from 10 to 20
points below par. This drift of reinvestment
has already reached a point at which It must
tell favorably upon the value of stock issues,
and I look for its results in the future course
of the market."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, Dec. 15.â Many rtocks gained
about a point to-day and the market left off
strong, with a good buying movement In
progress. Perhaps the most potent influence in !
sentiment was the Government's foreign trade j
statement, showing exports for November of !
nearly J130,000,000, which was nearly J78.000.000
In excess of imports, and the excess of imports j
for the five months of the fiscal year were
above the enormous sum of $253,000,000. Then,
too, the strength of the craln markets to-day
seemÂ«-d to Indicate a continuance In the de
mand for our products. Alternating firmness |
and weakness rendered the market irregular |
during the forenoon. Subsequently the market |
shook off its hesitancy and became buoyant on
r^Tts that the Vanderbilt interest had pur- 1
chased the Chicago and Alton with a view to
merging it with the Michigan Central system
Michigan Central immediately rose five points
and Chicago and Alton three. Subsequently a
Vanderbilt official denied that such a deal had
been consummated. This, however, failed to
affpot the Vanderbilt stocks, which continued
upward to the close at .pbout the best prices.
The sustained strength of securities supposed
to be interested In the rumored deal aroused I
some comment among the traders. Lake Shore
dropped eight points. Sugar was very irregular I
and moved within a radius of two points
closing with a gain of 1%. Dcnvpr preferred
and Central Pacific were strong. Federal Steel
fharf-s were buoyant, the common rising 2%.
Activity diminished somewhat in the bond
market and profit taking arrested the improve
ment in some securities. The general tendency,
however, was decidedly upward. Total sales
$5,285,000.
United States 3s advanced % in the bid price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO.. Dec. 15.â Trade in wheat is rather
slow, though a good deal of firmness was
shown at the immediate opening. Liverpool
I displayed more steadiness than was expected
I after the late show of weakness in yesterday's
j market here, while the receipts at Minne
apolis and Duluth continued to fall off. But
the firmness disappeared almost before trading
got fairly started. Private continental cables
reported constantly Increasing stocks -in Rus
sian ports, with continued free offerings from
Russia. This was a source of much weakness j
here . yesterday and for a short time It had a
like effect to-day. The market continued rather
dull for about an hour and a half, but by 11
I o'clock trade had begun to broaden out very
1 materially and prices to advance with a rapid-
I ity that was somewhat astonishing and pleas-
I ing- to the bears. The big factor was the con
! dition of the Argentine crop, which cables re
ported very bad. Some estimates placed the
damage as high as 20 per cent. This brought
nearly all classes of buyers into the market.
There were many slight reactions caused by
profit taking, but the market was firm to the
end. May advanced l'/ic for tho day, closing
at 66%@6fc.
There was a big trade in corn, after which
It went on a rampage. The cables were higher
and receipts â  were moderate, â  but the market
was almost entirely a sympathetic one, follow
ing closely the fluctuations of wheat. May
closed %<a%c ,higher.
Oats 'followed wheat and corn. The market
was rather dull, almost up to noon, but became
quite active after that, the shorts and elevator
people being good buyers. May closed %&%c
higher.
Provisions vacillated between heavy hog re
ceipts and strong grain markets. A large busi
ness was done. The market was done early,
all products easing off under 'Â«â¢Â»<Â» general sell
ing, but firmed up later as the grain market
advanced, all the declines being recovered.
There was a. good deal of realizing at times.
At the close May pork was 2%c higher; May
lard ' a shade lower, ' and May ribs a shade
higher. rv, <Â,-,. ,

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK. Dec. 15.â The Journal of Com
merce pays: Although stocks of California
raisins are closely controlled on the spot and
held firmly up to quotations, the movement at
present does not seem to be up to the expecta
tions of sellers. Most of the larger buyers in
Eastern markets have covered their wants for
some time to come, and in the absence of any
important demand are indifferent as to the
future. On the other hand holders on the coast
who are trying to get better prices for their
remaining stocks are holding quotations firmly
up to the previous quotations. Whether they
will be able to maintain their prices depends
upon the strength of the Growers' Association.
The local trade, now that the bulk of the busi
ness has been done, does not seem to be much
impressed with the projects of growers. They
do not appear to fear that when it comes to the
matter of distributing goods next season the
association can afford to ignore them, and con
sequently they are not Inclined to do more than
await developments.

LIAM IN A DRIVE.
Red Glenn Hard Pressed at the Fin
ish by G. B. Morrisâ Favorites
Won and the Books Got
a Scorching.
The books suffered Fome fearful hard
knocka at Ingieside again yesterday. It
3 as if the talent couldn't go astray
and nearly every firm In the ring suffered
losses. Five winning favorites and
a second choice tell the tale. All of the
winners were hacked to a standstill and
found the muddy going just to 'heir lik
ing.
Much grumbling was indulged in over
the starting. Mr. well's work was
very uncertain and ragged; so much so.
In fact, as to almost stagnate the betting.
The veteran will have to Improve or the
public will cease to bet altogether.
One of the swagger plunges of the after
noon was made on Montgomery. Billy
Magraiie"s notorious mud lark made his
first start of the meeting in the fifth race,
at six furlongs, and was hammered down
to 9 to 10 favoritism. "Skeets" Martin
got him away to a flying start, and all
out at the end, he downed Ben Doran
three lengths in the very fast time of
1:14%. Joe Ullman and the balance of the
entries found the pace too warm.
The Montana youngster Silver Beaux
defeated a big collection of two-year-olds
in the opening live and a half furlong
scramble, going to the post a lukewarm
favorite. Bullman had the leg up, and at
the wire won somewhat easily from Rose
beau. Elizabeth R was third.
There were seven starters in the mile
and a quarter selling affair, with the
â mart money all going in on Red Glenn.
Purser's aged gelding was backed from
t to 5 to 4 to 5, and after making ail the
running, just lasted long enough to beat
the fast coming Q. B. Morris a neck.
prince Blazes disposed of the others for
show honors.
Yemen was a 1 to 3 chance to win
the six-furlong spin following, and there
â was nothing to it. The start was a bad
one, with the favorite and New Moon the
only ones to get away, and they finished
in that order. Highland Ball brought up i
a distant third.
To the flying start Jones on Ricardo get
probably be ascribed the defeat of
William. Schreiber's mud lark
was a pronounced favorite for the five
and a half furlong run next decided, and
carried a bundle of coin on his chances.
Ricardo was away to a flying start, and
in a hard drive at the finish led the fav
orite out a neck.
Th> of the day, a mile selling
arrangement, went to the favorite Myth,
which won all the way. Tom Calvert was
a handy second over Lodestar.
Track Notes.
Seventeen bookmakers chalked up odds.
Bernard (Kid) Weller claimed to be un
able to get his money on the horses he
â¢ I and cut in himself. He handled
:tmount of coin, but they
tor the talent.
Rlley Graiinan and Phil Howell con
cluded to take a rest on the ground. They
came bo badly mixed up for the firm last
drawing that Riley lost several pounds in

"With a blanket pinned around her
shoulders Merry Heart could not be in

turn of speed though during the actual
running, and if the filly cooled out well
will be hard to beat next time.
Bullman and Eddie Jones each piloted
two winners. The former is a wonder
fully improved rider.
For some minutes after the Ricardo-
Sweet William finish Barney Schreiber
was missed from his book. The genial
German was so Incensed at the start his
gelding received that he told both Kri
Corrigan and Starter Caldwell in very
plain terms what he thought of the situ
ation. It Is rumored that Bruenn will
soon be seen in the starter's box at Ingle

From Los Angeles to
Testify.
The Board of School Directors is ap
parently not to go scathless through Its
latest Grand Jury Investigation. Instead
of adjourning to-day, according to the
plan announced Tuesday, the Jury will
continue Its work and there ig promise
that results of a tangible nature are near
at hand. The Investigation is to be re
newed with Increased vigor and with new
witnesses and from one of these It Is
calculated facts will be obtainable that
will make wholesale indictment possible.
This sudden decision of the jury was ar
rived at yesterday when a number of the
members gathered at the City Hall for
a quiet consultation with Judge Belcher.
The fact developed that on the Sth of the
present month the indictment that has
stood for nearly a year against D. E.
Stanton, former teacher In the Business
Evening School, was quashed by Judge
Carroll Cook, leaving the absent peda
gogue free to return to this city without
the fear of the law. Stanton's address
has been In the hands of the jury ' for
some time past and as soon as it wns
learned that charges against him had
been withdrawn, a telegram was sent to
Los Angeles directing him to como to
this city as soon as possible.
It is known that Stanton is willing to
come and that he Is anxious to tell all
he knows of the School Board and its
many rascalities. With his evidence the
Jury is confident that something In the
way of results will yet come out of the
investigation that it had almost given up
in discouragement.
It was Stanton's ill-g-uarded tongue that
put Professor Kilpatrick in possession of
the sensational facts concerning the oper
ations of the board that he gave to the
public in February last. One of the least
among the charges was that Stanton had
paid $500 to a director for his position
as teacher at the Business School and
that $300 more had been demanded of him
in order that his job might be made
"solid." This and allegations equally as
startling Kilpatrick exposed and he lost
his position for doing so. Since that time
the courts have said that his mission was
a righteous one by ordering him rein
stated in his old school, and pending an
appeal to the Supreme Court taken by the
Directors he has been spt-nding his time in
relentlessly following every hint and clue
to BCbool jobbery. His testimony, backed
by that of Stanton, promises sensational
developments to say the least. The jury
will resume its investigation to-day and
it is expected that Stanton will be on
hand by to-morrow.

SCHOOL BOARD
PLOTS AGAINST
KILPATRICK
To Forestall Action of
New Directors.
SOME REAL SHARP JUGGLERY
WILL ABOLISH ONE SCHOOL TO
CREATE ANOTHER.
The Creation of Vice Principals Is a
Daily Occurrence â The Substi
tute List Being Cleared for
More Appointments,
The wrath of the School Directors
against Professor E. C. Kllpatrlck has not
spent itself since February last, when
that impolitic pedagogue sent them
sizzling across the grill and lost his job
for laying open to the eyes ot a public
inclined to be critical the inner workings
of that dubious body. The School Board
knife is again unsheathed, and again the
scheme is to try its temper in the Kll
patrick back. The present board has suc
ceeded in cutting him off from his liveli
hood for so long as it may be in office; it
now seeks to deprive him of the privilege
of making a living in future.
Up to February 9 of this year Kilpatrlck j
drew a salary- as principal of the Business |
Evening School on Bush street. On that i
date he was summarily fired for telling
things he knew of the jobbery just then
going on in the School Board. He brought
suit for reinstatement and the courts
pave him a decision, which was appealed
by the Directors to the Supreme Court,
where it is still pending.
A few flays ago it came to the cars of
one of the Directors that it Js the inten
tion of the incoming board to withdraw
the appeal now before the Supreme Court
and give Kilpatrick his old place and sal
ary. The result was a general roar, which
was confined to Secretary Welch's office.
It was presumption on the part of the \
â¢'green" Directors; the Waller dignity
would stand for no such reversion of
Waller edicts; it was an insult that no
Gallagher would remain speechless under.
Bantel thought so. too. Besides Kilpat
rick had "shot off his mouth," as another
prominent Director put it, and had no
right to longer eat at the crib, and the
question of the impromptu caucus was on
the prevention of the incoming board ex
ercising its own prerogatives. After a
good bit of debate and more hard plan
ning it was decided the only way to keep
Kilpatrick out was to abolish his position ;
and the school in which he held it, and I
either at the meeting to-night or at one j
to be called to-morrow a resolution will !
be introduced doing away with the Busi- i
ness Evening School and all positions
pertaining thereto.
At the next meeting, as the plan stands
now. a new school will be created, to be j
known as the Business High School. The i
resolution creating this institution will |
also provide for the appointment of a]
principal and vice principal.
The teachers for these positions are al- j
ready slated, and unless through the ac- I
tivity of the minority the plan misear- I
rics "G. H. Foulks, present acting princi- j
pal of the Business Evening School, will
be made the permanent head of the new ;
institution and Miss Ixniise E. Freese, \
now a teacher, will be promoted to the
vice princlpalshlp.
The Directors who have engineered this
clever scheme to manipulate Kilpatrick :
out of both school and position are confl
dent that they have enough votes to put |
it through, though by a motion to rccon- :
sider any action that may be taken the j
minority may succeed in so delaying the |
plan that Its consummation will not be i
possible under the present administra- |
tion.
The proposed plan of campaign against I
Kilpatrick is not, however, the only queer j
scheme on the tapis. One of the present !
board's favorite methods of paying- its I
obligations and making room in the ranks
tor more appointments is the creation of I
vice principal.ships. One of these is to I
go through to-day, when a resolution in- ';
troduced at Wednesday's meeting is to \
be passed. It provides that Miss Orr, a
favorite of the department, shall be ap
pointed to the position of vice principal
of the Denman Grammar School ut a sal
ary of $125 per month, and her appoint
ment is only one among many that are
in prospect. To-day, too, the work of i
cleaning up the substitute roll for thÂ« !
projected end of the year appointments
will be resumed and an influx of nice
new pedagogues will be imminent at al
most any meeting.

The man worked In an Ohio coal mine, and this is the story hÂ«
told : " For some years past I have been employed under mothei
earth, from one and a half to two miles from the mouth of the mine,
digging coal. The great distance under the hills makes it impossible
for me to get pure air, which is forced to us by the aid of great fans.
During breaks in machinery the air would become bad, causing first
great pains in my head, dizziness and fainting. This continued until
next was pains in stomach, indigestion and dyspepsia. Working hard
in the mines I natnrally was a hearty eater until at last I had dyspep*

The hearing: of serious charges against
â C. K. King, administrator of the estate
of John W. Smith, brought by Sadie Eliz
abeth Thompson and Lena I. Snodgrass,
heirs ami granddaughters of deceased,
,-was commenced to-day before Superior
Judge Ogden.
John W. Smith was a railroad magnate
vrho died intestate here on November 15,
1895, leaving an estate valued at $552,000,
his bonds In th>' California and Nevada
Rallroaii Company alone amounting to
5300,000; also twenty acres In this county.

2UOO acres In San Luis Obispo County, $1".
00o; Green Mountain mining property, $15.
000; besides land In Santa Barbara i ounty
and interests in Shenandoah Mining Com
pany of unknown value.
The petitioners, who seek the removal
of < '. X Ki:>K as administrator, allege ;i
conspiracy between King and Charles 11.
Smith, a son of ised, who resides
In Denver, Colo., and who testiiied thut he
was a resident ol this State at the time
lie nominated King as administrator.
"Kir.p has acted as the instrument of
Bald Charles 11. Smith." Bays the petition,
"and conspired with said Smith to ma.!!
iage the affairs of the .-state for the sole
Interest and benefit of Smith and to the
detriment of the other heirs-at-law of
John W. Smith'
It is further asserted that in September.
1896, King paid to Charles li. Smith (1274
on an illegitimate claim against th<
estate, again, that King by conniving
with Charles H. Smith paid to A. H,
McCarty niT" than $:M) tor lumber noi

that C. 11. Smith used undue influence
over his dying father to secure deeds to
the prejudii â¢ of the other heirs, the
daughters, Man M. <"iark. Marguerite <*.
Kir-' Laura VV. Porter and a son, Albert
B. Smith.
King occupied the witness stand dur
ing the afternoon and Attorney George K.
de Qolla, on behalf of petitioners, rigidly
examined him as to what he did with
moneys collected from rents ami other
Bources, and asked him to explain why
certain claims were paid.
King denied all allegations of conspir
acy, lie saiii that just before J. W. Smith
died he told him that he had given all
his mining interests to his son, yet King
admitted that, In the following December,
he had paid bills of â  accruing at
the mines with money taken out of the
â¦ state. Moreover, he had not mentioned
euch mining interests in the inventory.
The hearing will be continued to-morrow
end some interesting revelations are
.promised.

WIDE SPLIT IN
THE CAMP OF
REPUBLICANS
Barker Talks of the
Municipal League.
SAYS IT BARS PROGRESS
AUDITOR SNOW FAVORS AP-
POINTED DELEGATES.
The Seventh Ward Hopelessly Divid
ed Over the Question of Prima
ries â Young Men Oppose
Appointing.
Oakland Office San Francisco" Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 15.
It Is very evident tnat there is to be
considerable friction between the lead
ers of the Republican party and the Mu
nicipal League, which is composed almost
entirely of Republicans. The standing of
ilit' league i:i this campaign is onv of g< n
eral interest, ;ls it has departed from the
lines upon which it was originally laid
out. There is, however, the same per
sonnel to the. league as there was at its
birth, seven years ago, although since
that time many who have subsequently
held office are now prominent among its
leaders. The Republicans are divided upon
the method of obtaining delegates for a
convention. W. R. Davis Is opposed to the
plan of appointing delegates and gives the
following reasons for his opposition:
"There are two ideas I would like to ex
press. The first is about holding a- pri
mary flection and avoiding the appoint
ment of delegates to the convention. No
one authorized the appointment of dele
gates or the creation of a convention
in lieu of the action of the members of
the party. The appointment of delegates
by committees has always created dissat
isfaction and Is the forerunner of dissen
sion and defeat. The Republican party
.should nominate the best ticket which can
be selected from the membership of the
party. Men who are Republicans cannot
do any better outside of the party than in
It. They can do much bettor for the party
by expending their exertions within it for
the good of the party than by individual
or outside action.
"Some seem to expend their exertions
as Republicans to sustain the Republican
administration 41*00 miles distant, and an
other Republican administration 100 miles
distant, But do nothing to strengthen or
sustain a good, strong Republican admin
istration at Fourteenth and Washington
h reets, Oakland.
"A good Republican administration in
Oakland is just as creditable and ser
viceable as one at Sacramento and ont
at Washington. 1 believe in all throe of
them."
Timothy L. Barker, who was the Re
publican nominee for Mayor four years
ago, does not think that the Municipal
League is deserving of the support of the
Republican party.
"At present." said he to-day, "the city
government is run by a clique, with which
I will have nothing to do. They manage
the party for personal Interest, and there
is no chance for stanch old Republicans
to take a hand. I have no opinion as to
the best policy for the Republicans to
adopt during the coming campaign. The
Municipal League will draw from the
strength of the Republicans, and I will
not be surprised to see the Democrats
elect their ticket. The. Municipal League
has done nothing but impede the progress
of the city since it was organized. In
1533 Oakland was in a prosperous con
dition. Since the Municipal League took
hold of Its affairs it has steadily been on
the decline. It was through the agency
of its members that the water front suit
was made to cost $Ts.inm, while it should
not have cost more than $10,000. >f the
Municipal League members had done as
much inside the Republican party as tnej
has done outside they would have made a
grand success. As it Is, they may over
thtow the Republican vote and we may
have a Democratic Mayor."
Auditor Snow has created some surprise
by stating that he prefers an appointed
delegation. As Mr. Snow will certainly
I â â  a candidate for something nezl spring,
his opinion carries some significance. In
:'ii Interview he declares that at present
primaries can be greatly abused, and he
believes that rle Republicans will be bet
ter satisfied with an appointed conventloi
than with one elected at an unsatisfac
tory primary.
The stronghold of Republicanism In this
cityâ the Seventh Wardâ is divided on the
same question. The Seventh Ward Re
publican Club has already pronounced In
favor of appointing delegates to the Re
ijubllcan convention. As the Seventh
Ward already has its candidate? mapped
out. the appointment of delegates simply
means that the delegation would practi
cally he pledged to those candidates. The
Young Men's Republican Club of the Sev
enth Ward held a meeting to-night, and
pronounced in very positive language
against the appointive plan. They de
clare that if an attempt be made to ap
point delegates they will hold a primary
and fight the matter out ns was done six
years ago, when delegates were elected to
the National Conveiition and when prim
aries were declared to be the proper
method for the Republicans to follow in
the election of delegates.
GOLF SCORE QUESTIONED.
San Francisco Players Contend Tha*
the Match on the Oakland Links
Was "All Even."
In the match played last Saturday on
the Oakland golf links between teams of
eight players representing the San Fran
cisco and Oakland Golf clubs the Oakland
team was reported as winning by 2 holes.
In the first rou..d the score, of Oakland
â¢whs given as 8 up, and that of San Fran
clbco as 6 up. a difference of 2 holes In
f;ivr>r of Oakland. As both teams were ~t
up in the second round Oakland was de
clared to have, won by 2 holes. It has
since been learned, however, that one
bole, the eighth in the first round between
C. P. liubbard of Oakland and E. J. M.'-
Cutcheon of San Francisco, Is open to dis
cussion. The facts are these:
In approaching the hole C. P. Hubbard
overplayed and sent his ball into Lake
Merritt. At the suggestion of Melville, th<
Oakland club's professional, he lifted ins
ball out of the water and dropped it; it
roiled back, but not (.juite into the water:
he thon dropped a oal! again and played
on. with a penalty of only one stroke.
"When he dropped his ball lie had his face
toward the hazard. Proceeding with the
play, he holed out in fewer strokes than
his opponent, and scored the hole.
The rules affecting the question are Nos.
39 and 21 of the Rules of Golf as revised
by the Koyal and Ancient Golf Club of St.
Andrews, and adopted by the rnlted
States Golf Association. Rule 21 reads:
"If the ball lie or be lost In water, the
player may drop a ball under the penalty
â¢of one stroke." Rule 19 prescribes that
"when a ball is to be dropped the player
shall drop it. He shall front the hole,
stand erect behind the hazard, keep the
BDOt from which the ball was lined In a
fine between him and the hole, and drop
the ball behind him from his head, stand
ing as far behind the hazard as he may
please." To conform to these rules Mr.
Hubbard should have gone to the other
side of the arm of Lake Merritt. so as to
be "behind the hazard." and. facing tht
eighth hole, have dropped a ball behind
i him. This being almost Impracticable,
I the San Francisco players are of opinion
I that the only alternative was to give up
the hole. The loss of the hole would re
duce Hubbard's score 1, and raise Me-
Cutcnen's score l, thus making BfeCntch
en 3 up on the first round, and giving the
San Francisco team 8 holes on the first
round. This wouiu make the score "all
even."
The Oakland players, however, contend
! that on their links there is a ground rule
; thnt a ball on being rÂ»)aved into the lake
may be lifted out and dropped with a
penalty of one stroke, and that it is not
necessary for the player to place himself
behind trie hazard. They urge that spe
cial rules relating to the particular links
i take precedence of the general rules of
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALiL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1898.
golf, and that their player, Mr. Hubbard,
was quite entitled to play aB he did. A
letter setting forth the views of the San
Francisco club has been forwarded to P.
E. Bowles, vice captain of the Oakland
Golf Club, and an amicable adjustment of
the matter will doubtless be arrived at
shortly.
BAISED A ROUGH HOUSE.
Two Soldiers Try to Run the Orphe
um but Get the Worst of It.
Two soldiers who made an attempt to
run the Orpheum last night succeeded In
raising a very rough house for a
time. In the end they found that Special
Officer Butler owned a few shares in the
theater ana was Incidentally very handy
with his fists.
Shortly after the doors open<*d a man
; wearing Uncle Sam's blue and a large
I jag presented himself at the door with a
! 10-cent ticket. The doorkeeper, not being
: blind, discovered that the defender of his
country had been Imbibing too freely and
'. took up his ticket, returned the price and
i refused the "dough boy" admittance. This
! juoccluje did not please tue soldier, and
his objection became so violent that Of
| ficer Butler was called. The star on But
. ler's breast was not sufficient to Impress
1 the ebstieperous youth, but when he felt
| Butlers good right swing he wilted and
! went to the Central station without any
j further trouble.
Later in the evening, another soldier
| who had been recently discharged from
i the army became displeased with one of
the numbers on the programme and ex
pressed Ids displeasure with hoots and
hisses. Officer Butler was again sum
moned and after a short engagement suc
ceeded in taking the dramatic critic to
I the pafrol box. He turned his prisoner
over to Policeman Sylvester, who was
obliged to call Specials Smith and Mur-
Dhy to his assistance to quell the turbu
lent spirit of the ex-soldier. Both men
were charged with assault on an officer.

A TROUT THAT CAUSED
ENDLESS ANNOYANCE
ALTHOUGH CAUGHT OUT OF SEA-
SON, IT TASTED WELL
A Deputy Fish Commissioner and a
Liquor Merchant Who Got the
Wrong Tip and Went
Astray.
Dispenser Tom Ferguson had a visit
from a deputy fish commissioner recently,
and now he knows something about fish
laws and game fishes.
Ferguson, it appears, has been a target
for his sportively Inclined patrons for
some weeks past simply because he will
insist that he understands how to shoot
and fish, notwithstanding that Commo
dore John Con way has exhausted all of
his latent knowledge of pisciculture on
Ferguson in the endeavor to convince the
man that he knows not the first thing
about a gun or a fishing rod.
Conway takes much pleasure in teasing
the honorable liquor merchant, and as a
matter of fact Ferguson looks suspicious
ly on every movement the commodore
makes when he is within eye range;
but Conway "put it on" his old friend in
the most approved style last Monday, and
the story as told by Contractor Chris
Morehouse goes thusly:
Ferguson, although he knows not the first
thing about fishing. Is a fond lover of mountain
trout. By that I mean, of course, that every
trout looks the fame to Tom, and doubtless
they taste alike also. However. last Monday
morning Hilly FabÂ»r. the director general of
beverages and hot bean stew, received from
some of his country cousins a nice fat two
pound rainbow trout, which, although caught
out of season (presumably In tide water), made
delicious eating.
Bill, after feasting his bright, sparkling
eyes on the so-called speckiea beauty, con
signed It to the ice chest until such time as he
was ready to cast it to his palace on the hill.
When Ferguson put In an appearance at head
quarters Monday afternoon Conway and his
barytone laugh greeted him.
"Well, Tom," said "Weak-lunged" -John, "I
just wish that some of my country friends
would remember mo as well as they do you
occasionally."
"Why, what's the matter now?" queried
"Ferg" suspiciously.
"Oh that beautiful trout in the Ice chest that
was sent to you. I'd Just like to have it; guess
you are not much of a lover of tish. anyhow,
are you, Tom?" asked Conway, with a face
that was as cold and as straight as the bar
rels of a shotgun.
"Why, I don't know a thing about It, re
plied Ferguson. "Let's have a look at It."
Well, to make a long story short, Ferguson
was delighted when he saw the fish and Im
mediately dispatched a messenger to his house
to inform his good wife of the beautiful trout
he would present her with on his return home.
The rightful owner of the trout. Billy Fa
ber, decamped with his "mountain beauty"
after he had concluded his day' labor and
was enjoying happy moments over the pan
when Ferguson again visited the Ice chest in
finest of his royal prize.
Well, say. you should have been around
when Tom discovered his loss; talk of a blue,
smoky atmosphere and the Greek language; I
never" heard such a pow-wow. Some fellow
told Tom that his man Billy walked home with
the fish and without a moment's hesitation
â â¢Ferg." wrote out Billy's discharge and sent
i to him by Jack, the champion wheelman of
the smokehouse.
To make matters worse. Artful Curly dis
patched a messenger to the Fish Commission
er's office with a note which stated that
"rainbow trout out of season" were In pos
session of Tom Ferguson. The deputy who
visited "the man of barrels" heard Ferguson's
story, .but it was fortunate for Tom that Billy
Faber had already killed the evidence by hav
ing turned It over to the Inner man and there
by saved Ferguson from arrest and a possible
heavy fine. â :â â â â¢:"
The Joke was on Tom the next day when
Billy Faber put In an appearance, but as for
Commodore Conway, he Is on the black books
and there is no telling the amount of hard
medicine he will have to drink when he meets
poor old "Ferg" among the barrels.
FREE PASSAGE TO CHINA.
Clever Kuso to Be Sent Home at the
Expense of the United States.
Thp Chinese are at their old trick of
having the Government pay their passage
to China when they get tired of amassing
wealth in this country.
The latest phase of this confidence game
came to light last Wednesday.
On tho afternoon of that day Police
Judge Low telephoned to the Chinese Bu
reau the Information that hÂ«* had been in
formed that in a wash house on Bryant
street wns a Chinaman who had nHkCer
tlllcate of registration and who therefore
was illegally In the United States.
A Chinese Inspector was sent to the ad
dress given and the coolie was placed un
der arrest. About half an hour after his
arrest another Chinaman, fat. sleek and
well groomed, walked into the Chinese
Bureau and informed Chief Meredith that
he had arrived here a few days ago In
transit to Mexico and had recently smug
pled himself Into California across the
Mexican border. He was â willing to be de
ported at once. He also wa.s placed under
arrest and Collector Jackson notified of
the facts of the case. There was no
doubt that both men are entitled to re
main here and that they have destroyed
or concealed their certificates In the ex
portation that the Government will give
them a free passage to China.
Collector Jackson said yesterday that
there is a statute imposing a penalty of
or.c year's imprisonment upon any native
of China other than of American parent
age, who may be a laborer, found In this
country without a certificate. The stat
ute has never been enforced because It
was sought to avoid the expense of keep
ing the offenders in jail for a year, but
the Collector says that It la his Intention
to enforce it in cases like the present,
where Chinese, by concealing their certifi
cates, seek to obtain passage home to
China at the expanse of this Government.

MUNICIPALITIES
Second Day's Session
of New League.
ADDRESS BY MAYOR PHELAN
F. W. DORHMANN CRITICIZES
THE PRESENT SYSTEM.
Control or Ownership of Public Utili
ties and Adoption of Civil Ser
vice Favored â Convention
Adjourns Sine Die.
The second and last day's sesrton of the
new Lea-gue of California Municipalities,
in Pioneers' Hal!, was mainly devoted to
addresses on subjects relating to city gov
ernment. Mayor Phelan, president of the
league, presided at the mornln" session
and delivered an address, in which he
urged the necessity of concerted action by
the cities and towns throughout the State
to secure necessary legislation to enable
them to successfully carry out many con
templated reforms.
The speaker said that every writer on
political economy in this country, as well
as foreign visitors, uad remarked on the
conspicuous failures of the people of the
T'nlted States in the matter of municipal
governmentâ failures all the more con
spicuous on account of the progress made !
by us in all other branches of edr-qtion !
and business management. During the j
past few years matters had begun to im- j
prove. New "York had made wonderful
progress and he believed San Francisco's J
new charter was the nearest perfect of
any In America.
"The three things necessary to be ob- I
served," said the Mayor, "are civil ser- j
vice, home rule and efficient management j
of a city's affairs. Civil service will open ;
up a career for the young men as well as ,
assure better municipal administration. j
As things are now the mercnants of this i
city would not think of employing a man
who had graduated from the City Hall, j
That place is looked upon by them as a j
school of corruption, the reward of which j
is big wages and little to do."
In conclusion the Mayor said he hoped
to see the time when the city should own ;
and operate all nubile utilities. |
President F. W. Dohrmann of the Mer- i
chants' Association was present by mvi- ,
tation, and delivered a short address on
"Municipal Government." He attributed \
the failure to secure honest and efficient j
administration of city affairs in the muni- i
cipalities In this country to the constant i
changing and shifting about of officials. ;
There was no stability, and if a good man
was elected to an important office, as
soon as he became fairly accustomed to
his duties and was in a position to put his |
experience to practical use another elec
tion came along and he was displaced by ;
a man with less experience and probably
less honesty. He contrasted this system |
With that in vogue in European cities, |
where all executive municipal officers are
hired for their known ability to admin- j
ister the affairs of a city successfully.
Other speakers at the morning session !
were City Clerk L<amborn of Alameda and j
Joseph Hutchinson of Palo Alto. The lat- |
ter introduced a resolution, which was |
adopted, directing the judicial and legis
lative committee to take steps to secure
the passage of a bill through the Legisla- ;
ture requiring the distribution of all bills :
as fast as introduced to the municipal
authorities throughout the State.
Second Vice President W. H. Turner of ;
Merced presided at the afternoon session,
and the principal speaker was J. Richard :
Freud of the Merchants' Association. Mr.
Freud told of the work done by that body
In this city and gave a detailed and com
prehensive account of the methods em- i
ployed and the results obtained.
Joseph Britton of this city. D. J. Sulli
van Superintendent of Alameda Schools,
M Walsh of Petnluma and R. F. Robert
son of Los Gatos also addressed the meet
ing and the league then adjourned sine
die It is possible that the next meeting 'â 
will be held some timo in January In Sac
ramento, but this Is left to the judgment
Of the executive committee. About fifteen
delegates signed the membership roll, and
It is expected that many other cities will
join as soon as the purpose of the or
ganization Is fully understood.
To-day the delegates will be taken for a
drive through the park and nut to the !
Cliff House as the guests of Mayor Phe- ;
lan. They will start from Pioneer Hall at j
10 o'clock this morning. â  ' ;

WISE'S WORK
PLEASED THE
CUSTOM HOUSE
Major Moore Will Be
Investigated.
A ORAPHIC LETTER TO GAGE
THE SPECIAL AGENT DID NOT
LOOK FOR CRIME.
Sent Foss to Prison and Rode In
the Park on Sundays With
His Favorite Behind a
Team of Bays.
The dispatch from Washington relating I
the details of an Interview by The Call's j
correspondent with John H. Wise, ex-Col- I
lector of the Port of San Francisco, was
tbe sole topic of conversation in the Cus
tom House yesterday. It was conceded on
all sides that the ex-Collector had made a
strong case against Special Agent Moore, !
and that in all likelihood the official days
of the major are at an end bo far as ihia
Stnte is concerned.
Mr. Wises picturesque Callfornian way
of referring to the major's great failing
and his susceptibility to feminine charms
both in and out of office hours was ad
mired and flatteringly commented upon by
the Custom House clerks who have dab
bled in the mysteries of belles lettres.
Even Chauncey Milton St. John, who is a
fellow of the Geographical Society of Cal
ifornia and a student of nature in all her
phases, read the sentence over and over
again, but he declined to tell the reporters
what he thought of Mr. Wise as a litter
ateur.
It was the general opinion that the ex-
Collector was wise when he insisted that
Collector Jackson should investigate the
serious and scandalous charges made
against Major Moore by vomen of un
questioned veracity and unsullieu reputa
tion, whom the venerable major sought to
bend to his base purposes. Colonel Jack
son is a disinterested and unprejudiced
party. He is fearless In the discharge of |
his duties and would make a thorough
and unsmotherable Investigation, ana the
public as Wfll as the Secretary of the
Treasury would u&ve conlidence in his !
findings. When asked yesterday whether
he would be willing to undertake the task
U requested by the Secretary of the I
Treasury he said that , however distaste- j
ful the duty might be to him personally
he would cheerfully enter upon the lnves- :
tigation and would "probe it to the grass ,
rootB." There is no doubt that the Inves
tigation will not be lacking in inorough
ness and impartiality.
It is believed tnat the amorous major is
making an attempt to have the charges
investigated by nome other Special Agent
or Officer, as in that event he might oring
his political influence more or less sue- *
cessfully into play. Jn corroboratlon of ,
this impression, the fact is noted that the !
Examiner has had a special commlsioner
for the past two or three days sounding
Federal officials, principally Assistant .
Tnltt'd States Attorneys Woodworth and â¢
lianning, as to the law on the subject of
a change of venue in the matter. The
commissioner received cold comfort when
Informed that the ardent major was not
under the civil service system and that
the Secretary of the Treasury can dismiss i
him without any charges being made and ;
without notict^and that the courts would i
be powerless to interfere.
Whfn Wise was Collector of this port he
wrote a letter to Secretary Gage forcibly j
expressing his opinion of Moore. In that
letter which is Mr. Wise's masterpiece of
English composition, he told the Secretary
many stinging things about the Machla- :
velian Special Agent. The letter, among
other things, called attention to the fact i
that during the administration of Collec- |
tor Hager a great opium smuggling scan
dal was exposed in the newspapers and
that subordinate Government officials
were involved in allegations of oribery in
connection with the traffic.
"Although these grave charges were
public," wrote Mr. Wise, "he (Moore)
never made an effort to ascertain the
facts, but, on the contrary, was a con
stant visitor at the residence of the prin
cipal accused official and frequently dined
and was entertained there.
"On one occasion," continued Mr. AN Ise,
"he sent Assistant Special Agent DeWitt
C. Jackson to Los Angeles and San Diego
to look Into Federal matters at those
points. Mr. Jackson did his duty so well
that he was enabled in a short time to
furnish the major with the names of
persons engaged In smuggling. opium into
the country and of persons who were
making large sums of money by smug
gling Chinese men and women into Cali
fornia across the Mexican border. But
Moore paid no attention to the report of
his subordinate, having found the task of
traducing the characters of the highest
official* more congenial to his taste. He
has employed detectives, he has visited
jails and penitentiaries, he has promised
prisoners Immunity from prosecution and
he has appealed to the necessities of
women to drum up testimony against
officials who stand higher, morally and
socially, than he." "',-"â  Â . â
Mr Wise made a mistake in the follow
ing statement to The Call's correspondent
at Washington:
In the case . of the Chinese woman, Fong
Suev Won Moore and a woman from the
Mission were the parties responsible for her
release on the Plea thatj the poor woman
wanted to get back to China. Ha made these
representations, although he knew that she was
a procuress and therefore guilty of felony. He
thus secured her release before the Chinese
Bureau knew the facts. Collector Jack
son has exonerated Meredith. The Treasury
Doimrtment understands the case. Meredith 8
conduct was all right according to Colonel
Jackson.
The "woman from the Mission" men
tioned by Mr. Wise is Miss Cameron, ma
tron of the Presbyterian Chinese Home
Mission. Miss Cameron was the first per
son to warn Chief Meredith of the char
acter of Fong Suey AVon, and it was upon
Miss Cameron's representations that the
procuress was not allowed to go when her
certificate of registration was produced at
the mission on the evening of her arrest
during the Federal raid for the Omaha
women. The Chinawoman who .was al
lowed to go to China at Miss Cameron's
request was one of the witnesses against
Foiik Suey Won. but her testimony was
only hearsay, and would not be admissible
in court, and what she did hear was that
Font: Suev Won had purchased the wit
ness in China. Fong Suey could not be
punished in the United States for Inlying
slaves in China, and the witness was al
lowed to return to her native country
with the consent of United States Attor
ney Foote and. of Major Moore, who had
no use for her, she not understanding
'The Mrs. Elliott mentioned by Mr. Wise
as having been one of the gay major's
charmers was the dear friend of Fops,
one of the ring of opium smugglers who
was sent to the penitentiary a few years
ago through the major's efforts. This
left the field clear for a new affection, and
the major and Mrs. rilliott were often
seen on Sundays in Golden Gate Park
behind a spanking team of bays.
The following dispatch will be of inter
est to those who desire to see the conduct
of Inspector Moore investigated:
WASHINGTON. Doc. 15.â The Treasury
Department has decided to investigate the
conduct of Inspector Horace A. Moore of
San Francisco. This decision was reached
to-day. The only question now 1b as to
the manner in which such investigation
shall be conducted. Ex-Collector Wise
was desirous th;it Collector Jackson be
called upon to report, but the department
has reason to believe there Is some feeling
between Collector Jackson and Inspector
Moore growing out of the Meredith case.
Inspector Moore some time ago reported
that although the Chinese woman. Fong
Suey Won, had a certificate showing her
right to be In this country under the
terms of the Geary act. he had placed in
the possession of Chief Meredith of the
Chinese Bureau evidence showing that
she whs a prociress for bad women and
was therefore .iable to arrest on the
charge of felony.
The Treasury Department asked Col
lector Jackson to report the facts in this
case, and he sent a letter exonerating
Meredith and stating that Inspector
Moore and a woman from the Chinese
mission had gone together to the District
Attorney and represented that this "poor
woman," Suey, should be released, as she
wanted to get back to friends and rela
tives in China, and that upon Moore's rep
resentations, backed up by a woman from
the Chinese mission, she was released.
The treasury officials believe that these
respective statements of Collector Jack
son and Major Moore may have created
some feeling between them, and they pre
fer that the investigation of Moore's con
duct be made by some party known to be
thoroughly impartial. It is believed that
an inspector who has not become involved
in these affairs and who is unbiased will
be sent to San Francisco from soiiip other
State. Mr. Wise will remain here for
several days J
A STAKE AND MATCH RACE.
Greatest Coursing Card of the Season
Arranged for Ingleside Park.
Great will be the sport at Ingleslde
Coursing Park on Saturday and Sunday
and doubtless great will be the crowd in
attendance.
An eighty dog stake is an inducement ,
which should attract sportsmen from j
afar, and as the longtalls are all of the
highest of blood strains the coursing
should be particularly good.
Apart from the stake, lovers of the
grand old sport will have an opportunity
of seeing the two champion coursers of |
the State decide in a contest, best two .
in three courses, which is entitled to the
honor of b.-lng called the champion grey
hound of California. |
Tli dogs referred to are Lowe &
Thompson's Piitria and J. Deane's Moon
dyne The consideration is $500, and the
betting Is 10 to 8 In favor of Moondyne.

POLITICIAN AND WIFE.
Mym. Hecht's Ambition to Become a
Public Speaker Results Dis
astrously.
The suit recently instituted by Chris
tina Hecht, a female politician, for a di
vorce from her husband. Joseph A. Hecht,
was dismissed yesterday by Judge Heb
bard.
The Hechts w^re married In Bohemia in
IS6S and have four children. In nor com
plaint Mrs. Hecht alleges that her hus
band has failed to contribute to lier sup
port for the past thirty months and that
during that period he also treated her
with extreme cruelty. Hecht joined the
â  issues by tiling a cross-complaint in which
he charged his wife with cruelty and de
sertion. The case came up f"i* hearing
yesterday morning and Hecht testified
that his" wife's advent Into politics bad
broken up their home.
"After my wife took to attending lec
tures and making speeches on bf halt of
the Socialist Labor Party." he said, "she
had no time to cook for me and the chil
dren " A letter was produced showing that
Mrs Hecht had advised her husband to
sue for a divorce. She admitted having
written the letter and In consequence the
' suit was ordered dismissed. Mrs. Hecht
i was a candidate for School Director on
! the Socialist Labor ticket at the recent
election, and in conclusion it may be
i stated that she was defeated.

SIXTH BEGIMENT OUT.
The First Detachment of the New
York Troops Ordered Home
for Discharge.
Yesterday the Sixth California Regi
ment, United States Volunteers, after
mustering in months ago for active serv
ice was mustered out of a service that
was anything but active.' Like the Sev
enth, they waited in vain fnr the trans
ports that never came, and so they were
bidder to pack up and fro home.
The Sixth consisted of eight companies"
from the San Jnaquin Valley, under the
command of Lieutenant Colonel Johnston,
and during their enforced stay here they
conducted themselves in an orderly, sol
dierly manner, and though extremely de
sirous of going to the front, did not com- j
plain of the rather inglorious duty of
guarding the sleeping guns around the
Presidio. The members of the regiment
were paid off in full, discharged and fur
nished transportation home.
The first detachment of the New York
troops, including the companies which
lately returned from Honolulu, are now
homeward bound, having left for the l^m- i
pire State yesterday morning, t'pon the
arrival of the transport Scandia from the
Hawaiian Islands in a few days with the
rest of the New York companies thoy
will also be ordered home.

HEARD "A
VOICE THAT
IS STILL"
The Ferry- Boat Mys
tery Solved.
IDENTIFIED BY THE PARASOL
AGED MRS. ELIZABETH YOST'S
LIFE-SOKBOW.
Mourning for Her Dead Favorite
Daughter Susie the Sad Mother
Finally Committed
Suicide.
Worn from time's warfare, burdened
with llfe'B loneliness, hopeless in the
gloom of despondency and listening al
ways to the "sound of a voice that is
Still." EHzahf-th Yost, in the nipht of her
deepest desolation, ended 'he span of her
yean in suicide. These axe the last lines
of the pitiful story of the mysterious
â woman who disappeared from the dock
of the forry steamer Bay City last Tues
day evening. This is the record not of
youth in it* brightest day that found life
rot worth the living, but of a?e in its de
cllnlnp ruthlessly shortening: -ts few re
maining years ar.d hurling itself beyond
the limits of time.
Out among the marbled heaps of the j
Odd Fellows' Cemetery there is a grave
Wherein lies a beloved daughter, the fa- I
vorite in tho mother's heart of all her i
children, and doubly dear because dead. I
This girl died long ago, but over her
tomb a mother's form has knelt and a
ler'a tears have fallen. To the
rner's bou] came no time effacement
of her dlsconsolatlon, no comforting hope
in. Out of the grief of the
-flying years -was the heart's desire
to tie undreaming, unawakenlng in
hallowed .spot. Tben came the down
ward plunge in the night, the folding of
the waters over the place and earth sor
row had ended.
â iy yesterday morning Fred Tost of
J- 'â ;â¢ York street, accompanied by his
r Kate, called at the ferry and asked
parasol which had been left on
the neck of the Bay City when the woman
lumped overboard from that vessel on
lay night. They readily recognize. i
â I stated that the ferry-boat suicide
their mother. They wept bitterly as

Commendable Enterprise.
We are glad to learn that the Bald
win Jewelry Company open their new
store for business to-day at 844 and 846
Market street, opposite Fourth. This is
the well-known company that took such
good care of their patrons' property at
the time of the late fire, so that nothing
was even damaged but the store fit
tings, the valuable stock being re
moved before daylight from the burn
ing building across the street to 408
Parrott building, where the business
has been carried on the same as ever
without interruption since the fire. .
Work on the new stores was begun
soon after the fire and has been rushed,
no expense being spared in fitting them
up in an artistic manner, with new
showcases, the latest improved and
tested fire-proof safes, etc, for the pro
tection of valuables. Every effort has
been made to provide for the conveni
ence of patrons.
The store. No. 846, will be conducted
on the same plan as the well-known es
tablishment under the old Baldwin
Hotel, and will carry a full line of solid
gold watches, diamonds, precious
stones, etc, and no Imitation goods.
The adjoining store, No. 844, will be
conducted aa a first-class jewelry es
tablishment, carrying a full line of
stt-rling silverware, spoons, forks,
purses, combs, umbrellas and novelties
of all kinds. This will be one of the
moÃt popular places to buy holiday and
wedding presents. The public is cor
dially invited to call and inspect the
stock. Every visitor treated with the
same consideration whether a pur
chaser or not.

i Unusual Scene at the Tiburon Ferry
When Two Sheriff's Var
Drive Up Filled With
Unfortunates.
A scene enacted at the Tfhuron ferry
at 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon created
considerable excitement in that vicinity.
I Two Sheriff's vans drove up at that time,
both filled with feeble-minded people that
have been gathered from the various in
sane asylums in the State. Secretary
' John P. C;irrere of the State Board of
Lunacy Commissioners has been rounding
up the idiots, and the first consignment
j was sent to the Home for Feeble-Minded
at Eldridge, In Sonoma County. This is
in accordance with an order recently is
sued by the commission.
The patients must be sent to the county
from which they were first committed to
the insane asylum for recommitment to
the feeble-minded home. Secretary- Car
rere started with San Francisco, which
furnishes the most patients, on account
of Its size, and as a result L'kiah asylum
furnished one male and two females, Ag
news two males and two females, Napa
four males and one female and Stockton
three males, making a total of fifteen
committed from this county. They were
placed in the insane ward of the Keceiv
ing Hospital and taken before the In
sanity Commissioners yesterday morning.
Drs. Lustig and Rothers were kept busy
examining them, and Judge Carroll Cook
committed them to the home near Glen
Ellen.
In the party were also three from Ala
meda, two from Santa Clara and one from
San Joaquin. They were perfectly harm
less and tractable. The women were at
tended by seven lady attendants. Sheriff
Whelan wisely delegated Under Sheriff
William Clack to take charge of the
transfer, which was accomplished without
any untoward incident. Eight deputies
accompanied them, and handled their in
sane wards with great consideration. Sec
retary Carrere was a very busy man at
the departure of the 5:10 o'clock boat,
being anxious to have the proceedings go
off without a hitch.
"This transfer," he said, "will relieve
the pressure on the asylums where the
most dangerous people are kftpt. It is the
first time such a course has ever been
taken, and it is a wise precaution. There
is a great difference between the treat
ment for the feeble-minded and that for
the insane. Now that a home has been
provided for the poor unfortunates It is
proper that they should be taken there.
Dr. A. E. Osborne, superintendent of the
home at Eldridge, is a wise administrator
and thoroughly understands the treat
ment of feeble minds. While I do not
think that they can be cured, still it is
but just that they should be in a separate
institution.
"I will proceed to gather them from the
other counties, and I anticipate that the
next Legislature will make an appropria
tion for the enlargement of the premises
at Eldridge in order to accommodate
them all. The railroad people have very
kindly provided a special car, and so the
poor beings will be to themselves on the
trip. There are three boys In this lot, one
of whom has been in the Stockton asylum
for five years. Some were Insane when
first committed, but have npw become
idiots and are unable to help themselves,
it being necessary to feed them. One
woman has been In the Stockton asylum
for . thirty-two years, and her condition
Is pitiable. It will be some days before
all the feeble-minded are removed from
the Inferior asylums, but the work will bo
completed as soon as practicable."
Orpheum Symphony.
The largest audience of the season as
sembled at the Orpheum yesterday for
the third symphony concert. The pro
gramme contained Schumann's "Genove
va" overture; Beethoven's sixth sym
phony, "The Pastoral"; "Llcht-Elfen und
Reif-Reisen." a larphetto from one of
Haydn's string quartets, and "Une Nuit
sur le Mont Chauve," by Mousporgsky.
The performance of the symphony was
too rough to bring: out the beauties of this
great work. The best i>erfurmance of the
afternoon was a Hoffmann number
"Third Movement of Frithjof Symphony "
â which was repeated. The Haydn farghet
to was played with nice feeling and the
"Genoveva" overture wa-s fairly well
done. The Moussor<"sky number received
a spirited performance. At the fourth
concert, whicii takes place Thursday, De
cember 29, Tselialkowski's second sym
phony will be played.

A HOWLING NORTHER.

Jewett.
Strange things happen at sea, but the
strangest experience that ever occurred
in the life of an old salt was what hap
pened to Captain R. J. Dunham on the
last voyage of the steamer Weeott. It
was (luring the norther, and the wind was
howling through the steamer's rigging at
the rate of ninety miles an hour. Captain
Dunham was on the bridge, looking after
the safety of his vessel, when Purser A.
E. Dey came to him and said that the
only lady passenger on board was about
to be' confined. The captain turned tho
vessel over to the mate and went below.
With the assistance of the purser (they
are both married men. with large families)
he delivered the woman of a girl baby
that weighed a scant pound and a half
and measured six inches in length. The
mite was alive and hearty, and the cap
tain made a cradle for It out of a cigar
box.
The Weott sailed from San Francisco
for Yaqulna Bay on December 8 at 11 p.
m. Among the passengers was Mrs. G. W.
Whitf\ wife of an employe of Morton's
special delivery, and her two children,
one aged eight years and the other 4.
She was on her way to Corvallls to pay
her sister a visit, and was in good health
when the steamer left San Francisco.
"All went well," said Purser Dey, "until
we ran into the norther. Then it blew
great guns and we had a terrible time.
There were a lot of cases of kerosene
on deck, and It is lucky they were lashed
down. The wind came along and ripped
the tops off them as easily as you would
tear a piece of paper from the wall. It
wns during this war of the elements that
Mrs. White's baby was born. It was as
bright as a new dollar, and Its face was
not much larger than that coin. It had
black hair and eyes and was very pretty
as babies go. Of course, the mother had
no clothes for it, so we bundled it up in
cotton batting and put It to sleep in a
cigar box. Talk about your small babies!
Why, that cigar box was large enough
to cradle two babies the size of that one
At Corvallls we fixed the mother and
child up and sent them ashore."
The little mite that was born in a howl
ing norther on the bosom of the Pacific
Ocean is to be named Grace Dey Weeott
White, so if she lives to be old enough her
name will always remind her of where and
under what circumstances she came Into
the world.
Quite a fleet of ships put In an appear
ance yesterday. The British ship Was
dale got in from Antwerp, the Flintshire
from Swansea, the barks S. C. Allen and
Annie Johnson and the brig Lurllue from
the Hawaiian Islands, the French bark
Louis Pasteur from Swansea, and besides
these there were two barkentines and a
bark outside.
The Mail Company's steamer City of
Peking will not get away until the" 21st
inst. On her way here from China she
cracked her tall shaft, and an attempt
was made to repair it. This was found
impossible, so a new one had to be made
Hence the postponement of the sailing
date.
The remodeled steamer Crescent City
had her trial trip on the bay yesterday
and proved to be a wonderfully improved
vessel. She has had new boilers and a i
new high-pressure cylinder put in and I
her cabins remodeled. She Is now one of '
the finest vessels of her class on the
coast.
The Italian fishermen are back at their
old tricks again. Yesterday boatload after
boatload of coots were landed at Fisher
men's wharf, and after being plucked and
their heads taken off were sold to peddlers
who retailed them all over the city as
sprig. They catch them in their nets and
smother them. They are in consequence
unfit for food. The Health Officers will
stop the practice.
The schooners Beulah and W. F. Jewett
have made record-breaking runs up the
coast. They both left here on the 10th
inst., and the Beulah made the run to
Willapa Bay in three days, while the
Jewett went to Port Gamble in four days
The Jewett Is the vessel that made the
record-breaking run of ten days from
Unalaska to Grays Harbor.
The engines of the Japanese cruiser
Chitose were turned over yesterday To
day or to-morrow she will have a pre
liminary spin around the bay and some
time next week will go to the Santa Bar
bara channel for her official trial trip.
